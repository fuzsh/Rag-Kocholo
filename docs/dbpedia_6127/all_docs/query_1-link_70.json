I'm Terry Gross.\n\nOur show today is all about \"Hairspray,\" the original film and the new one.\n\n(Soundbite of \"Hairspray\")\n\nSingers: Do do do do do do do do\n\nUnidentified Actor: (Speaking) Hey there, teenage Baltimore! Don't change\n\nthat channel because it's time for the Corny Collins show, brought to you by\n\nUltraflex Hairspray!\n\nSingers: (Singing) Do do do do\n\nActor: (Singing) Oh, every afternoon when the clock strikes 4\n\nSingers: (Singing) Bop bee bop, bop bop bop bop bop bee bop\n\nActor: (Singing) A crazy bunch of kids pass through that door, yeah\n\nSingers (Singing) Bop bee bop, bop bop bop bop bop bee bop\n\nActor: (Singing) They throw of the coats and leave the squares behind\n\nAnd then they'll shake it, shake it, shake it\n\nLike they're losing their minds\n\nYou'll never see them frown\n\nBecause they're the nicest kids in town\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nGROSS: \"Hairspray\" is set in Baltimore in the early '60s when teenagers rush\n\nhome after school to watch the \"Corny Collins Dance Show,\" a local show that's\n\nlike \"American Bandstand,\" without the big stars. Tracy Turnblad is a fat\n\ngirl whose dream is to dance on the show, but being fat isn't cool. Later,\n\nwe'll hear a 1988 interview with John Waters about writing and directing the\n\noriginal \"Hairspray.\" His film was adapted into the hit Broadway musical that\n\nbecame the basis of the new film.\n\nMy guest, Adam Shankman, directed and choreographed the new \"Hairspray.\"\n\nBefore making \"Hairspray,\" Shankman choreographed music videos and films,\n\nincluding \"Boogie Nights\" and \"Stuck on You.\" In his new film \"Hairspray\"\n\nTracy is played by newcomer Nikki Blonsky. Her father is played by\n\nChristopher Walken. Her mother is played by John Travolta in drag and in a\n\nfat suit. In this scene, Tracy has just told her mother she wants to audition\n\nto dance on \"The Corny Collins Show.\" Her mother is ironing as she responds.\n\n(Soundbite of \"Hairspray\")\n\nMr. JOHN TRAVOLTA: (as Edna Turnblad) No one is auditioning for anything in\n\nthis household.\n\nMs. NIKKI BLONSKY: (as Tracy Turnblad) But why not? Why not?\n\nMr. TRAVOLTA: (as Edna Turnblad) Because dancing is not your future. One\n\nday you're going to own Edna's Occidental Laundry.\n\nMs. BLONSKY: (as Tracy Turnblad) I don't want to be a laundress. I want to\n\nbe famous.\n\nMr. TRAVOLTA: (as Edna Turnblad) Look, if you want to be famous, learn how\n\nto take blood out car upholstery. That's a skill you can take right to the\n\nbank.\n\nMr. CHRISTOPHER WALKEN: (as Wilbur Turnblad) Hey, hey, what's all this\n\nruckus in here?\n\nMr. TRAVOLTA: (As Edna Turnblad) Not a word.\n\nMs. BLONSKY: (as Tracy Turnblad) Daddy, tomorrow I'm auditioning to dance on\n\na TV show.\n\nMr. WALKEN: (as Wilbur Turnblad) You are?\n\nMr. TRAVOLTA: (as Edna Turnblad) No, she is not. First the hair, now this.\n\nMr. WALKEN: (as Wilbur Turnblad) But the--all this kids are batting up their\n\nhair now, honey.\n\nMr. TRAVOLTA: (as Edna Turnblad) You're no help.\n\nMs. BLONSKY: (as Tracy Turnblad) It's ratting, Daddy, and our first lady,\n\nJackie Kennedy does it.\n\nMr. TRAVOLTA: (as Edna Turnblad) I don't believe that.\n\nMs. BLONSKY: (as Tracy Turnblad) What do you mean, you don't believe that?\n\nMr. TRAVOLTA: (as Edna Turnblad) Uh-unh. I don't.\n\nMs. BLONSKY: (as Tracy Turnblad) How else would it look that way?\n\nMr. TRAVOLTA: (as Edna Turnblad) I believe that it is naturally stiff.\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nGROSS: Adam Shankman, welcome to FRESH AIR.\n\nNow you're good friends with the songwriters who did the songs for\n\n\"Hairspray,\" and you've said that you've seen the Broadway show about 20\n\ntimes.\n\nMr. ADAM SHANKMAN: Yeah. I have.\n\nGROSS: So, when you set out to make the movie and you already had the show so\n\nmuch in your head...\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Mm-hmm.\n\nGROSS: ...what did you do to kind of get rid of the show and start fresh with\n\nthe movie? Or maybe not? Maybe you felt like you should do what the show\n\ndid.\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Well, no. It was really interesting. When I got the\n\njob--this is going to sound so sad and lame, but I got John Waters' e-mail\n\naddress because that's where I needed to start. Because all roads of\n\n\"Hairspray\" lead back to John Waters. So I got his e-mail address, and I\n\nthink I basically typed in `Dear Mr. Waters, My name is Adam Shankman. You\n\ndon't know me, but I've been hired to direct and choreograph the new\n\nadaptation of \"Hairspray.\" I hope you don't mind.' And he e-mailed me back,\n\nlike, `Let's have lunch tomorrow' because I was in Baltimore producing a movie\n\nthere when I got the job.\n\nAnd we had lunch the next day and he said, de facto, `Don't do what I did.\n\nDon't do what the play did. You got to do your own thing.' And I really took\n\nthat very seriously and I thought, OK, great, this is--now, being given\n\npermission by God to go out and do my thing, you know, at least, the god of\n\n\"Hairspray.\"\n\nGROSS: Since \"Hairspray\" is a period piece set in the '60s about a TV dance\n\nshow...\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Mm-hmm.\n\nGROSS: ...the choreography had to be tied, at least the choreography that the\n\nteenagers do in the context of the dance show, had to be very '60s, so what\n\nare some of the things that you watched to get inspiration for the\n\nchoreography?\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Well, it's interesting. I mean, I've choreographed a lot of\n\nmaterial that sort of was from this period, and I happen to love it, and\n\nthere's a lot of different things that I drew inspiration from. You know, I'm\n\na huge fan--you're going to laugh--of like the whole Frankie Avalon and\n\nAnnette Funicello movies.\n\nGROSS: The beach movies?\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: The beach movies. And I've watched a lot of Elvis, but you\n\nknow, even going back to \"Bye Bye Birdie\" and, you know, the theatricalized\n\nversions of things from this era, you know. I've watched a lot of old\n\n\"American Bandstand,\" and then I watched \"Crazy Like Hullabaloo,\" which was\n\nall Michael Bennett choreography so it was all really odd and kind of fabulous\n\nand brilliant.\n\nBut where I started out as a visual base was, there was a great documentary\n\ncalled \"Shake, Rattle, and Roll,\" which was a documentary about \"The Buddy\n\nDean Show,\" which is the show that \"The Corny Collins Show\" in \"Hairspray\" is\n\nbased upon, and it was the show John Waters used to watch growing up and the\n\nkids that he knew in high school that this whole thing is based on. The\n\nwhole--you know, \"Hairspray\" started with an essay--or an article, I'm\n\nsorry--that John wrote, called \"The Nicest Kids in Town,\" and then it was\n\npublished and then he kind of blew it up and it became \"Hairspray.\" And it was\n\nall about the kids on the show.\n\nSo I watched that show, and it's really--the dancing is really dull, but it's\n\nthe little dances of the era, and they're mostly like little repetitive steps\n\nlike the \"Mashed Potato\" or \"The Pony,\" or, you know, twisting and stuff like\n\nthat. And so I basically sat there and keyed all of my choreography using\n\nthat as a base and then blowing it up to musical size.\n\nGROSS: One of the things in the story \"Hairspray\" is that, you know, \"The\n\nCorny Collins Dance Show\" is a very white show but once a week it's Negro\n\nDay...\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Once a month. Yeah.\n\nGROSS: Once a month, I'm sorry. It's Negro Day and all like the black kids\n\nwho are dancers get to be on the show, and there's a black host instead of\n\nCorny Collins. She's played by Queen Latifah in the movie. And so, what are\n\nsome of the differences between like the white choreography that you did and\n\nthe black choreography that you did?\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Well, one of my associate choreographers, Jamal Sims, who is\n\nAfrican-American, and his family had danced on a show like \"The Corny Collins\n\nShow,\" and I think like his mother and father, his aunts and uncles, and he\n\nwent over to their house, and he filmed them doing the dances that they were\n\ndoing. One's called \"The Hully Gully,\" \"The Fly,\" \"The Slop,\" and those had a\n\nlot of more soul. They had a lot more hip action. They were looser. The\n\nwhite kids dancing was very uptight. It was very tight in the core of your\n\nbody, it was very centered, whereas a lot of the African-American style stuff\n\nwas very loose. And I love that because it was all of the same era, but it in\n\nand of itself was actually different. So he filmed them doing that and\n\nthere's a number in the movie called \"Run and Tell That,\" which is literally\n\ntaking a bunch of those steps and linking them all together and then just kind\n\nof pushing the size of the steps a little bit bigger, but it's all authentic\n\nsteps, really, from the era.\n\nGROSS: Did you ever want to be on a teen dance show when you were growing up?\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Oh my god. I wanted to do it all, and my parents wouldn't let\n\nme, and it made me so upset. They kept saying, `You need, you know, you need\n\na solid education.' It was like, `Just let me be on a commercial, just for\n\nLucky Charms, anything, just please.' I would have killed, I would have\n\nkilled. My dad was producing TV a bit back then and there was a kid on \"The\n\nBrady Bunch\" named Robbie Rist, who played Oliver, cousin Oliver, and they--I\n\nknew Robbie and this girl Kim Richards who was on \"Escape from Witch\n\nMountain.\" They were these child actors that I knew that were kind of in my\n\nlife, and all I wanted was to be them. And my parents wouldn't let me, so it\n\nreally bummed me out. But I didn't actually start dancing until I was 18. I\n\nwas pretty old.\n\nGROSS: That's really old.\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Yeah. How sad is that? That's really old, to be 18 to start\n\ndancing. But it really is, in fact, if you're really training, but I was...\n\nGROSS: Well, particularly, because you can do splits and all of that. I\n\nmean...\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: I can still do that, but that's like a cheap parlor trick for\n\nme. I was a competitive gymnast when I was a kid...\n\nGROSS: Oh...\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: ...so my body has certain kind of facilities that...\n\nGROSS: Oh...\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: ...you know, allow me to still have that kind of flexibility,\n\nwhich is weird, when I think, even to me. But it's just the way my body's\n\nbuilt.\n\nGROSS: What were you dancing when you were in high school?\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: When I was 17 I graduated high school and I went--I moved to\n\nMinneapolis to the--and I joined a repertory theater company called The\n\nChildren's Theater Company in School and they do in repertory a lot of\n\noriginal shows, and most of them are musicals. And so I found myself in the\n\ncompany dancing a lot and suddenly getting lead roles as a dancer in them, but\n\nI still hadn't taken any classes. I just sort of had this natural ability.\n\nAnd then I decided that dancing was kind of mostly what I should be doing, and\n\nI auditioned for all of the big schools--NYU and Juilliard and North Carolina.\n\nAnd I actually got into all of them in the dance programs, including\n\nJuilliard, I got into having never taken a dance class in my life, which was\n\ncrazy. It was like \"Flashdance.\"\n\nGROSS: Oh!\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: It was ridiculous. Yeah.\n\nGROSS: Let me get back to \"Hairspray\" for a second.\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: Now, in \"Hairspray,\" I know that John Travolta was cast before you\n\nwere actually hired to direct and choreograph the film. Now...\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Mm-hmm.\n\nGROSS: ...in the original movie, the John Waters movie, the mother, you know,\n\nthe very heavy mother, Edna Turnblad, is played by Divine.\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Mm-hmm.\n\nGROSS: Now Divine was a nearly-300-pound man who was always the leading lady,\n\nwhile he was alive, in John Waters' movies. And in the stage version, the\n\nmother was played by Harvey Fierstein, who is not quite as overweight as\n\nDivine by any means, but you know, he can put on the weight, and he's very gay\n\nand very out. Whereas Travolta is a kind of, you know, fairly trim man who's\n\nstraight. How'd you feel about casting like a straight, you know, reasonably\n\ntrim man in the part?\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Well...\n\nGROSS: Because Travolta has to wear a lot of like prosthetics--his legs, his\n\nbody, his face. Yeah.\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Yeah, well, there's a few reasons. There's a few reasons for\n\nthat. In the tradition of \"Hairspray,\" which started with John, obviously,\n\ncasting Divine, it's one of my favorite things that Edna's played by a man\n\nbecause it's anarchistic. It's basically a lot of the point of it, that don't\n\njudge a book by its cover, you know, credo in the \"Hairspray\" kind of legacy.\n\nAnd I love that part of it because it's just--it's such a nose-thumb to the\n\nworld.\n\nAnd when they told me that they were talking to John, I strangely immediately\n\nunderstood, because knowing that they were wanting to make a big, commercial\n\nhit movie out of this, and it's a musical, what man are you going to go to\n\nthat's the biggest musical star that we have? And because of \"Grease\" and\n\n\"Saturday Night Fever,\" it is John Travolta. \"Grease\" is the highest-grossing\n\nmusical of all time at this point. And so, I thought, `Oh God, that makes\n\nsense.' And the thing that I loved about it was that I could know get Edna\n\ndancing because we haven't seen John Travolta dance for, I mean, really dance,\n\nsince \"Staying Alive\" actually, the sequel to \"Saturday Night Fever.\"\n\nGROSS: You don't need to go there.\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Yeah. But, you know--but he was dancing, and I thought this\n\nis fantastic. And then I started thinking about \"Fantasia,\" the cartoon of\n\n\"Fantasia,\" and those dancing hippos, and it was like, `this is awesome'\n\nbecause what it could be is like Edna, you know, dances as if she's\n\nweightless, and I just, I thought that was sort of thrilling...\n\nGROSS: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: ...just the possibilities of it. So I never went to sort of a\n\ndark place. I mean, the interesting thing is that, I think why people have a\n\nbit of a problem with it, if there is a problem with it, is because both\n\nHarvey and Divine, I think, were generally thought of, in their way, as like\n\ncharacter actors. Even though they played leads in what they did, they're\n\nstill not traditional leading men. John is a very traditional leading man and\n\nhas been so for a long time. Very on the testosterone-fueled part, but that\n\nalso makes it more fun. Once again, it plays with the anarchy of the piece.\n\nGROSS: Well, there's a great soft shoe in the movie between Travolta and...\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Christopher Walken...\n\nGROSS: Christopher Walken, who plays Edna's husband, and I love watching both\n\nTravolta dance and Christopher Walken dance. I love watching Christopher\n\nWalken move.\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Did you ever see \"Pennies from Heaven\"?\n\nGROSS: \"Pennies from Heaven\"--I love the scene in that.\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Oh, god, he's so amazing. That's what--why I really wanted\n\nChris so much because--besides the fact that he in himself is like a novelty\n\nshop to a certain extent. He's just such an unusual and individual, brilliant\n\nand interesting actor who makes what seem like crazy choices, and they all\n\nfall together in the most brilliant way. To have that kind of randomness out\n\nthere dancing. You get the two of them--I mean, sometimes I'd have to step\n\naway and go, `What the hell am I shooting?'\n\nGROSS: Can you talk a little bit about what you put together for the two of\n\nthem?\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: There's a number in \"Hairspray\" called \"Timeless to Me,\" which\n\nis a reaffirmation of Edna and Wilbur's love, and I love this so much because\n\nit's actually one of the only old-fashioned moments in \"Hairspray,\" and\n\nthe--you know, it's a love story, really, between the two characters, and I\n\ngot to really play with it, and there's all sorts of great lyrics about, you\n\nknow, that turn on each other like, `You're like a stinky old cheese, dear,\n\njust getting riper with age.' You know? `You're like a fatal disease, babe,\n\nand if there's no cure, just let this fever rage.' They're so connected in\n\ntheir eyes and in the way that they behave with each other, and it's so\n\ngenuine and loving and so when then they erupt into the dance, it's just, it's\n\nheaven.\n\nGROSS: Well, why don't we hear the song that Travolta and Christopher Walken\n\nsing in the movie version of \"Hairspray\"?\n\n(Soundbite of \"Timeless to Me\")\n\nMr. WALKEN: (as Wilbur Turnblad) (Singing) Styles keep a-changing\n\nThe world's re-arranging\n\nBut Edna, you're timeless to me\n\nHemlines are shorter\n\nA beer costs a quarter\n\nBut time cannot take what comes free\n\nYou're like a stinky old cheese, babe,\n\nJust getting riper with age\n\nYou're like a fatal disease, babe,\n\nBut there's no cure, so let this fever rage\n\nSome folks can't stand it\n\nSay time is a bandit\n\nBut I take the opposite view\n\n'Cause when I need a lift,\n\nTime brings a gift\n\nAnother day with you\n\nA twist or a waltz\n\nIt's all the same schmaltz\n\nWith just a change in the scenery\n\nYou'll never be old hat,\n\nThat's that\n\nYou're timeless to me\n\nMr. TRAVOLTA: (as Edna Turnblad) (Speaking) Oh, Wilbur, I love you\n\n(Singing) Fads kept a-fading\n\nCastro's invading\n\nBut, Wilbur, you're timeless to me\n\nHairdos are higher\n\nMine feels like barbed wire\n\nBut you say I'm chic as can be\n\nYou're like a rare vintage Ripple\n\nA vintage they'll never forget\n\nSo pour me a teeny-weeny triple\n\nAnd we can toast to the fact\n\nWe ain't dead yet\n\nI can't stop eating...\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nGROSS: That's John Travolta and Christopher Walken from the soundtrack of the\n\nnew movie \"Hairspray.\" We'll talk more with Adam Shankman, the director and\n\nchoreographer of the film, after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Announcements)\n\nGROSS: My guest is Adam Shankman. He directed and choreographed the new\n\nmovie musical \"Hairspray.\" My guest is Adam Shankman, and he choreographed and\n\ndirected the new film adaptation of \"Hairspray.\"\n\nWhat were the pop dances when you were coming of age?\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: When I was coming of age? Oh god. I think when I was coming\n\nof age, it was right when breakdancing was starting, you know, the electric\n\nboogaloo and all of that, and there was a movie called \"Breakin': Electric\n\nBoogaloo,\" which I loved and there was a great movie called \"Fast Forward\"\n\nabout, you know, the very beginnings of like pop-locking and all of that.\n\nThat was all really popular when I was a kid.\n\nGROSS: So did you breakdance?\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Oh, god, no, are you kidding? I would have--I'm like a skinny\n\nJew. Like, that would have looked horrible. I'm so not...\n\nGROSS: But you were a gymnast and stuff so you could have done some of that.\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: I'm so more like a little gymnast. I was so not tough, and\n\nyou know, those kids were so like tough and street, and I was so like fake\n\npreppy Jew.\n\nGROSS: Oh, so no electric boogaloo or anything?\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: No, there wasn't although I tried. You know, I sort of looked\n\nbetter doing the stuff that the girls were doing, like fan kicks and all of\n\nthat.\n\nGROSS: But wait a minute. Weren't you in Paula Abdul and Janet Jackson\n\nvideos?\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Yeah. I did dance for them. I had gotten out Juilliard. I\n\ndropped out and I went and I was doing a lot of threader dancing, because\n\nthat's really want I wanted to do. I wanted to be a chorus boy, and so I was\n\ndoing a lot of that, had ended up having kind of a bad relationship\n\nexperience, frankly, my first one, I was 21 or whatever, and moved back to Los\n\nAngeles. I'd been living in New York, and I thought I was going to stop\n\ndancing and I wanted to produce music videos. That was my big goal. And I\n\nhad a friend who was producing a Janet Jackson video, and she convinced me to\n\naudition, and I got in and then I did some work for her and I did the Oscars\n\nfor Paula Abdul and stuff like that. But that was something like, you know,\n\nlike I said, I was already dancing professionally at that point, so that was\n\njust a job, you know.\n\nGROSS: Describe for us what you had to do in the Janet Jackson video.\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Oh, tumble. I was doing so much gymnastics. My whole body\n\nwas like wracked with pain. I was like--we were on the Universal back lot and\n\nI--on Mexico Street, and I was tumbling down that stupid street for about\n\nseven and a half straight hours into the morning, and when I tell you I woke\n\nup and I could not move. Because it was cement and I was like barefoot...\n\nGROSS: Oh, geez.\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: It was the most brutal thing on the planet and I was just a\n\nlittle gymnast boy at that point.\n\nGROSS: What was the song?\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: \"Escapade.\" And then I went out and I danced and I also\n\ntumbled and danced on the American Music Awards for her, same song.\n\nGROSS: And for the Oscars?\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: For the Oscars, we were doing Paula Abdul. We were doing\n\n\"Under the Sea\" from \"The Little Mermaid,\" and I was like a Lycra-clad\n\nflipping pirate and did the crab dance and all of that. So, it was really\n\nfunny.\n\nGROSS: You ended up choreographing a lot of videos. Like, what are some of\n\nthe acts you choreographed for?\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Well, I did a pretty popular Whitney Houston video called \"I'm\n\nYour Baby Tonight.\" I did Tony! Toni! Tone! \"Feels Good.\" I did a song\n\ncalled \"The Jerk Out\" for The Time. I even sort of--well, I choreographed\n\nsomething--one of Herb Ritz's last videos. I worked with 'N Sync doing some\n\nCharlie Chaplin stuff for the video \"Gone.\" I did like giant rock videos,\n\nwhere girls were like on the top of giant scaffolding throwing themselves\n\naround. I mean, it was crazy, back in like the real heyday of like that kind\n\nof stuff. I worked a lot with Julien Temple, who was the director of\n\n\"Absolute Beginners.\" And he did the very famous Janet Jackson \"When I Think\n\nof You\" video where she goes through the town, and that was basically based on\n\nhis opening shot of \"Absolute Beginners.\"\n\nGROSS: Adam Shankman choreographed and directed the new movie \"Hairspray.\"\n\nHe'll be back in the second half of the show. I'm Terry Gross, and this is\n\nFRESH AIR.\n\n(Announcements)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with Adam Shankman, the\n\nchoreographer and director of the new movie \"Hairspray.\" Before directing\n\nmovies he choreographed music videos and films, including \"Boogie Nights\" and\n\n\"Stuck on You.\" He got his start dancing with Janet Jackson and Paula Abdul.\n\n\"Hairspray\" stars Nikki Blonsky and several other newcomers, along with James\n\nMarsden, Michelle Pfeiffer, Queen Latifah, Christopher Walken and John\n\nTravolta.\n\nNow, John Travolta is one of the stars of \"Hairspray.\" What impact did\n\n\"Saturday Night Fever\" have on you? You were, what, around 12 when it came\n\nout?\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Yeah. I was young when \"Saturday Night Fever\" came out, but\n\nit was literally one of my father's favorite movies and still is. And we saw\n\nit in the theaters a couple times, and I thought it was completely magical.\n\nBecause not only was I entranced by the music and the dancing and how the\n\nmusic was used and how it was all pop music being used as a musical form that\n\nincluded the dancing, but then to have the dramatic content of it was\n\nmind-blowing to me, even at that age, you know. But of course, I was like the\n\n10 year old that was sneaking into theaters to see \"All That Jazz\" when I was\n\n10. So, you know, I was a bit of an anomaly, but I was very impacted by\n\n\"Saturday Night Fever.\"\n\nGROSS: Now, one of the movies that you choreographed was \"Boogie Nights,\"\n\nwhich is...\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Mm-hmm.\n\nGROSS: ...such a great film. And there's a couple of, you know, like disco\n\nparty scenes in that...\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...and in one of the earlier scenes, the dancing is kind of clumsy.\n\nEverybody's a little self-conscious, and they're not like particularly good\n\ndancers. But in like a later scene, like after the main character, you know,\n\nDirk Diggler, the Mark Wahlberg character, after he's gotten more\n\nself-confident, he's doing a real Travolta thing.\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Yeah--no, it's definitely a tip of the hat to \"Saturday Night\n\nFever.\" In fact, I was friends with Lester Wilson, rest his soul, who\n\nchoreographed \"Saturday Night Fever.\"\n\nGROSS: Oh.\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: He was a great man and he had told me a story once that--I\n\ndon't know if it's true, but he told me the story--that the original step in\n\n\"Saturday Night Fever\" was not just the one hand going up. But it was two\n\nhands going up and then pointing down and two and up. And that Travolta\n\nsomehow ended up being more comfortable with the single hand. So after Lester\n\ndied and I was doing \"Boogie Nights,\" I said, `You know what? I'm going to\n\ngive Lester his original step back,' and I did the two fingers up and down\n\nthing.\n\nGROSS: Oh, God, that's so great.\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: So, you know, what's it like when you're choreographing--there's that\n\nscene, and then before that there's a scene where people are just kind of very\n\namateurishly dancing. Did you choreograph that, or did you just say to\n\neveryone--yeah...\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Well, what you do is you give them a sort of a step\n\nvocabulary. You show them a bunch of steps and then you don't polish them and\n\nyou kind of send them out on their own and you make sure that it's properly\n\nstaged and you work with the director to, you know, get the shape down with\n\nthe camera, and then, you know, you just hope that the actors understand who\n\ntheir characters are and what they're supposed to be doing, how they are.\n\nGROSS: What were some of the movie musicals or Broadway musicals that helped\n\ncreate like your fantasy life or your...\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: Yeah.\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Well, this is going to sound really, really odd, but the first\n\nmusical that I saw live was \"Promises, Promises,\" and Michael Bennett did that\n\nand it was based on Neil...\n\nGROSS: That's a Burt Bacharach musical.\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: It's a Bacharach musical that was based on the Neil Simon play\n\n\"The Apartment.\"\n\nGROSS: Mm-hmm.\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: And Jerry Orbach and Jill O'Hara were in it, and it was just\n\nfabulous to me. I could not believe how amazing it was, and I really grew up\n\non \"Sound of Music\" and \"West Side Story,\" \"My Fair Lady.\" The real--the\n\nclassics.\n\nGROSS: Speaking of \"West Side Story,\" I thought the opening shot of your\n\nmovie \"Hairspray\" was a shout-out to the opening shot of \"West Side Story\"\n\nbecause it's this aerial view over the city.\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Yeah, but it came through the clouds, so I comboed it with\n\n\"Sound of Music.\" it was \"Sound of Music\" into \"West Side Story.\" I have a lot\n\nof those in \"Hairspray.\" When she's on the garbage truck, that's like the\n\ntugboat from \"Funny Girl.\" And when I had her hair also like in \"Funny Girl\"\n\nat the end of \"Welcome to the `60s,\" and you know, there's a lot of shout-outs\n\nat the musicals. Somebody was talking about in \"Without Love\" when he's\n\nsinging into the picture, it's like \"You Made Me Love You,\" where Judy Garland\n\nis singing to Clark Gable and, you know. There's a lot of winks in this one.\n\nGROSS: Now, I could see like, when you're growing up, if\n\nyou're--particularly, you know, in previous decades like when you're growing\n\nup that adults or teachers might say to you, `Well, being gay is going to hold\n\nyou back from accomplishing this certain thing in life,' but when your goal is\n\nto do like musicals, like no one can really say, `You're gay, you'll never get\n\nyour crack at doing musicals.' Do you know what I'm saying?\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Truer words have never been spoken. But I had a very, very\n\nreverse experience of coming out, which was that my parents actually outed me\n\nto me. I was dating girls, and they--well, they were divorced at the time,\n\nand right before I left to move to Minneapolis to join the theater company,\n\nthey both individually kind of pulled me aside and said, `You know, by the\n\nway, you're gay and we love you.'\n\nAnd I was like, `What are you talking about? This isn't happening to me, what\n\nare you saying?' You know? I guess, it was kind of--because I wasn't doing\n\nanything with anybody. So it was just something they felt about me. And I\n\nthink that, how sweet as they were, they wanted me to be happy and that was of\n\nutmost importance to them and--I don't know. Listen, when I was three years\n\nold I had like a sexual identity crisis, and my parents put me with a doctor\n\nwho I guess tried to kind of reprogram me, and they felt like that was a big\n\nmistake. Because it kind of messed with my head and my self-esteem so that\n\nwas, I think, their loving way of saying, `It's all good.'\n\nGROSS: Your mother's a therapist, right?\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Yeah, and a good one, actually.\n\nGROSS: What kind of sexual identity crisis did you have at the age of three?\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: You know, I was three years old and I was running around\n\ndoing, you know, singing \"Sound of Music,\" wearing my dad's T-shirts and\n\nbelting them, and you know, so they had a waist, you know. And you know, when\n\nI was--instead of playing Tony, I was playing Maria, or actually, I was\n\nplaying Anita in \"West Side Story\" because she had the sexier songs. But I\n\nwas three! You know? It was--as sad as it sounds, it's true. But it\n\ngenuinely was a phase, but now I think for my parents in 1967--and they were\n\nreally young when they had me--I think it was just nerve-racking so they put\n\nme--they wanted--they put me with a therapist in a program at UCLA who was\n\njust supposed to kind of observe me, but what they didn't know was that he was\n\nactually trying to reprogram me, you know?\n\nGROSS: In your career as a choreographer, you've not only choreographed\n\ndances, but you've choreographed nondance movies...\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Mm.\n\nGROSS: ...where the choreography, I guess, is more about physical comedy.\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Yeah, yeah, like \"George of the Jungle,\" you're talking about?\n\nGROSS: Oh, I'm thinking specifically of \"Stuck on You,\" which is not\n\nnecessarily...\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Oh yeah in \"Stuck on You\"--no, \"Stuck on You\" there's a huge\n\ndance number at the end with Meryl Streep and...\n\nGROSS: Oh, that's true.\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: I was actually in it.\n\nGROSS: Oh, oh.\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: I played the like waiter on her left. I was like, `I'm not\n\ngoing to miss this opportunity. I'm dancing with Meryl Streep,' damn it!\n\nGROSS: OK.\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: I did that final number. But like in \"George of the Jungle\"\n\nthere are a couple little dance scenes, but I was on \"George of the Jungle\"\n\nfor like five months. I started dealing with wire work with Brendan Fraser\n\nand then doing rock climbing and trampoline work, gymnastics stuff. And then\n\nwhen the movie started, he decided that he wanted me there all the time,\n\nliterally just to watch the physicality of his performance, because I did a\n\nlot of those movies that were cartoons-to-movies. Like, I did \"Flintstones\"\n\nand \"Casper\" and \"George of the Jungle.\" And you know, it's like all sort of\n\nmaintaining the integrity of the movement vocabulary of the cartoon while\n\ngiving it life. It's a very funky business, but I did a lot of it.\n\nGROSS: You know, you were telling us earlier about the video that required\n\nyou tumbling for about seven hours on concrete...\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Oh, yeah.\n\nGROSS: Do you have any injuries that give you like recurring pain from all\n\nthe dancing...\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...that you've done over the years?\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Yeah. I have really bad pain in my left hip, like lower back\n\nstuff. It's totally chronic. And then, unbelievably, the month before I\n\nstarted to choreograph \"Hairspray,\" I was actually hanging out with some\n\nfriends and dancing around and I slipped on a spilled cocktail and I tore\n\nevery part of my knee.\n\nGROSS: Oh.\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: After all those years of dancing--LCL, MCL, ACL, and my MCL\n\nand LCL healed but I still don't have an ACL. And I choreographed all of\n\n\"Hairspray\" with one very injured knee.\n\nGROSS: Wow. You know, dancers amaze me because like, on the one hand, when\n\nyou're a dancer, you seem to like defy gravity and do all these things that\n\nnormal bodies were never meant to do. And at the same time, I know, dancers,\n\nlike you were just saying, end up with injuries and are walking around in\n\npain. Do you ever get angry with your body for hurting? You know, for being\n\nvulnerable?\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Yeah, yeah. I get really angry with my body for hurting\n\nbecause, you know, no one warns you about these things. I also wonder, could\n\nI have made it any different by stretching more or by not doing that stupid\n\nstunt. I remember when I was doing the Academy Awards, they were making me\n\nthrow, stupidly, this giant back lay-up flip that landed in a front splits,\n\nand I broke five of my toes...\n\nGROSS: Oh.\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Excuse me. I broke three of my toes doing it, and it was like\n\nthe first week of rehearsal. And so I went on with my toes taped and went on\n\nto do four more weeks of rehearsal and dance the entire show. And of course,\n\nnever even performed the trick. By the way, I would have performed it anyway\n\nbecause it's just what you do. Dancers are the most the-show-must-go-on\n\npeople out there. They are the least paid and the hardest workers, for sure.\n\nGROSS: Well, Adam Shankman, it's been great to talk with you. Thank you so\n\nmuch.\n\nMr. SHANKMAN: Thank you. It was an extraordinary pleasure to be here.\n\nGROSS: Adam Shankman choreographed and directed the new movie \"Hairspray.\"\n\nComing up, a 1988 interview with John Waters about writing and directing the\n\noriginal version of \"Hairspray.\" This is FRESH AIR.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nInterview: A 1988 interview with writer-director John Waters on\n\nthe movie \"Hairspray\"\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nThe new movie \"Hairspray,\" and the hit Broadway musical that it's adapted from\n\nowe it all to John Waters, one of the eccentric icons of the independent film\n\nworld. He wrote and directed the original 1988 movie \"Hairspray.\" It's set in\n\n1962 at the height of the teen dance show craze. The story revolves around a\n\nfat girl named Tracy Turnblad whose dream is to dance on the local TV dance\n\nshow. In the new movie musical version of \"Hairspray,\" Tracy's mother Edna is\n\nplayed by John Travolta in drag and a fat suit. In the original film, the\n\nmother was played by Divine, a 300-pound man who was often the leading lady in\n\nWaters' movies. In this scene from the original \"Hairspray,\" Divine, as Edna,\n\nis taking her daughter to Mr. Pinky's Hefty Hideaway House for Ample Women to\n\npick out some new clothes for the dance show.\n\n(Soundbite of \"Hairspray\")\n\nDIVINE: (as Edna Turnblad) Mr. Pinky, I'm Tracy's business manager, Edna\n\nTurnblad.\n\nMr. ALAN WENDL: (As Mr. Pinky): Well, it's a pleasure to meet the both of\n\nyou. Here we cater to the big-boned gals like yourself who are stylish and at\n\nthe same time frustrated by the lack of sizes in the department stores today.\n\nI saw you on TV. I want you to be my model.\n\nDIVINE: (as Edna Turnblad) Would she be paid for this?\n\nMr. WENDL: (As Mr. Pinky) One free outfit a month! You start tomorrow. I\n\nhope there's no diets in the works because I want to design your Miss Auto\n\nShow coronation gown myself.\n\nDIVINE: (as Edna Turnblad) Could you throw in a pair of complimentary\n\npettipants in the deal?\n\nMr. WENDL: (As Mr. Pinky) You drive a hard bargain, Miss Edna, and\n\nrightfully so. Pettipants, panty-girdle. You just let Tracy take her pick.\n\nDIVINE: (as Edna Turnblad) It's a deal. Thank you, Mr. Pinky.\n\nMr. WENDL: (As Mr. Pinky) Ha ha ha! I'm going to make you a star!\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nGROSS: I spoke with John Waters in 1988 when his film \"Hairspray\" was\n\nreleased. I asked him if \"The Corny Collins Show,\" the dance show in the\n\nfilm, was based on the Baltimore dance show he grew up watching, \"The Buddy\n\nDean Show.\"\n\nMr. JOHN WATERS: I watched all the teen dance shows, and so it's all of them\n\nsort of put together and pushed one step a little further, but it's not that\n\nexaggerated. Basically, the kids really did look like that then. The\n\nhairdos, all that, was part of it. It wasn't a rebel look. Your mother had\n\nthat hairdo, too.\n\nGROSS: I think a lot of us learned what it would be like to be a teenager by\n\nwatching the dance shows. Did you watch the dance shows a lot?\n\nMr. WATERS: Sure, you learned how to be a teenager from it. I mean, and\n\nthere were so many gimmick dancers that you had to--they only lasted about a\n\nweek in popularity, there were so many of them. So you had to watch these\n\nshows. It was like homework for the weekend, because everybody would do those\n\ndances, and if you didn't know how to do them that weekend, you didn't have\n\ntime because there was already a new one out.\n\nGROSS: You have every record and more, that I can remember, the novelty\n\nrecords of the Continental, the Fly...\n\nMr. WATERS: The Bug, the Roach...\n\nGROSS: The Bug, the Roach...\n\nMr. WATERS: The Shake a Tail Feather. The Madison. They're all real\n\ndances.\n\nGROSS: Well, I figured--well, first of all, why did you include so many of\n\nthe novelty dances in the movie?\n\nMr. WATERS: Well, because I love them and I wanted to bring them back. I\n\nwanted--the fact that that was sort of a forgotten period when every dance was\n\na gimmick dance. So I had all those records. They were my favorite records.\n\nI used to get them out late at night, after a few drinks, and put them on\n\nand...\n\nGROSS: And dance?\n\nMr. WATERS: ...sometimes even danced. So I picked those songs first and\n\nsort of wrote the movie around them. I wanted to include them.\n\nGROSS: Everybody in your movies, as you say, is usually really--they're\n\noutcasts and they're frequently--somewheres between odd and bizarre-looking.\n\nMr. WATERS: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: Now, what was your look when you were a teenager?\n\nMr. WATERS: I went through a different--at one period I was preppy because\n\nthat's how I grew up. But then I had bleached hair on the front and I used to\n\nwear--then I wanted to be a beatnik. It was hard to be a beatnik in suburban\n\nBaltimore, but I wanted to be one and I read all the books about them and\n\neverything. I read Life magazine about beatniks and I just really wanted to\n\nbe one. That's why I have the whole beatnik scene in the movie.\n\nGROSS: There's a great scene where Tracy...\n\nMr. WATERS: Yes.\n\nGROSS: ...and her boyfriend...\n\nMr. WATERS: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...go into--they're looking for a place to hide out, basically...\n\nMr. WATERS: Right.\n\nGROSS: They knock on the door. Everybody's turning them away, but these two\n\nbeatniks at the door that they knock on open the door let them in and the\n\nbeatniks are Ric Ocasek and Pia Zadora...\n\nMr. WATERS: Right.\n\nGROSS: And it's this great like beatnik scene in their pad. This scene is a\n\nwonderful confrontation between the bouffant hairdo ethic and the beatnik\n\nlong, black, straight hair ethic.\n\nMr. WATERS: The ironed hair. yeah.\n\nGROSS: The ironed hair.\n\nMr. WATERS: Which is not an exaggeration. Around '62 in Baltimore, all the\n\ngirls had those big hairdos, and then suddenly, a few of the really hip ones\n\nstarted doing their hair straight, and people panicked. And it was called\n\n\"Going Joe,\" meaning Joe College. And people would say, `I don't know.\n\nShould I be Joe? I can't decide. I don't know what to do.' It was major\n\nthing. And what happened then is the kids that did do the ironed hair\n\neventually became hippies. And the ones with the teased hair got married and\n\nbecame, probably, very middle class.\n\n(Soundbite of 1988 \"Hairspray\")\n\nMs. PIA ZADORA: (As Beatnik Chick) You look like a hair hopper to me. I\n\nmean, your hair is really uncool.\n\nMs. LESLIE ANN POWERS: (As Penny Pingleton) How do you get your hair so\n\nstraight and so flat?\n\nMs. ZADORA: (As Beatnik Chick) With an iron, man. I play my bongos, listen\n\nto Odetta and then I iron my hair. Dig?\n\nUnidentified Actor: (In character) I think we better get going now. The\n\ncoast looks clear.\n\nMs. ZADORA: (As Beatnik Chick) Let's do some reefer. We'll get high and\n\nI'll iron the chick's hair.\n\nMr. RIC OCASEK: (As Beatnik Cat) Reefer? Oh!\n\nMs. RICKI LAKE: (as Tracy Turnblad) What?\n\nMs. ZADORA: (As Beatnik Chick) Loco weed. When I'm high, I am Odetta.\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nGROSS: In the movie you call women will really large hairdos...\n\nMr. WATERS: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...hair hoppers.\n\nMr. WATERS: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: Is that a Baltimore expression?\n\nMr. WATERS: That's a Baltimore expression.\n\nGROSS: Yeah, I never--it's a great expression.\n\nMr. WATERS: Yeah. Men can be hair hoppers, too.\n\nGROSS: What kind of hair...\n\nMr. WATERS: A male hair hopper is, you know, greased back, and the\n\ncontinental look, it was called. With sports coat with a belt in the back and\n\npointy-toed shoes and that look. A hair hopper basically is someone that grew\n\nup without a lot of money, suddenly gets some, spends it wrongly, thinks they\n\nhave style, and don't.\n\nGROSS: Did you use real hairspray in the movie?\n\nMr. WATERS: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: In the opening scene, everybody's like spraying their hair, and the\n\nboys...\n\nMr. WATERS: That's real hairspray. Yeah. We used roughly 60 cases of\n\nhairspray in the movie and...\n\nGROSS: Oh!\n\nMr. WATERS: ...because there was 1100 extras. And when you worked on this\n\nmovie, you had to go--it was like going into the fashion army. The boys had\n\nto go in one trailer to get their hair cut, then go to the next thing and get\n\ntheir hair slicked back. The girls had to go in, get it teased. We had like\n\nChris Mason, who did all the hairdo, but then we had like backups. People\n\nthat would tease it, then she would come in and style it. You had to go\n\nthrough an assembly line. So a lot of the kids that were in it finally got so\n\nsick of combing it out that they would just leave it in and they would go out\n\nin Baltimore with those ridiculous hairdos and just figure, `too bad.' I can't\n\ndo--go through this hairdo torture another day. Let's just leave it in.\n\nGROSS: Your movie's set in 1962...\n\nMr. WATERS: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: And this is currently a period when there's actually a lot of\n\nnostalgia for 1962.\n\nMr. WATERS: No, there's a lot of nostalgia for the '60s. But '62 was almost\n\nthe '50s. There were no hippies. There were no drugs. Kennedy haven't even\n\nbeen shot. It was right before everything changed.\n\nGROSS: That's why you chose that year?\n\nMr. WATERS: Yeah. And so when people talk about the '60s, they talk about\n\ngirls dancing in cages with fringe or hippies or the student rebellion and all\n\nthat. This was way before any of that.\n\nGROSS: One of the big storylines in \"Hairspray\" is about the integration of\n\nthis...\n\nMr. WATERS: Right.\n\nGROSS: ...dance show.\n\nMr. WATERS: Right.\n\nGROSS: Because it's a white-only show so they have Negro Day once a month?\n\nMr. WATERS: Which they did. That's not an exaggeration. Shows did do that.\n\nGROSS: Was it really called that...\n\nMr. WATERS: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...in the show you watched in Baltimore?\n\nMr. WATERS: Yes. Yeah. And they had them on other shows too, and basically\n\nI felt that to ignore that fact would be really inauthentic. Maybe that's not\n\nthe correct word, but if Hollywood would have made this movie, they would have\n\nhad blacks on the show and just ignored the fact that none of the\n\nshows--\"Bandstand\" didn't have blacks on it either. None of them did then.\n\nAnd basically the problem was, all the music was black. All the dancing came\n\nfrom blacks. Black singers were on the show all the time as entertainers.\n\nBut they couldn't dance. And it wasn't because the kids didn't want it.\n\nTheir parents didn't want it.\n\nGROSS: One of the things I really loved in the movie is that the worst insult\n\nthat one girl can say about another is, `She's a whore.'\n\nMr. WATERS: Well they used to--didn't they? When I went to high school,\n\nthey always used to say that to the--`That girl's a whore.'\n\nGROSS: Except that girl's a \"whoo-ah.\" Yeah.\n\nMr. WATERS: Right. And you know, the girls that they said that about never\n\nwere.\n\nGROSS: Oh, of course. I mean, how many girls in my high school were really\n\nwhores?\n\nMr. WATERS: I know. I mean, they were charging money. There weren't too\n\nmany of that. But they never even slept with anybody. But if you got the\n\nreputation as a whore, it lasted, and they always used to say that with girls,\n\n`Oh, that girl, she's a whore.' You know? It was always, at least, when I\n\nwent to junior high, that was a very big insult.\n\nGROSS: Did you always want to know, like, what the real story was behind\n\nthat...\n\nMr. WATERS: I always hung around with the ones they thought were whores,\n\nactually.\n\nGROSS: We're listening back to a 1988 interview with John Waters about\n\nwriting and directing the original movie \"Hairspray.\" More after a break.\n\nThis is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Announcements)\n\nGROSS: Let's get back to our 1988 interview with John Waters about writing\n\nand directing the original film \"Hairspray.\" He told me he saw \"Hairspray\" as\n\na satire of two dreaded genres: the teen flick and the message movie. I\n\nasked him about pitching the movie to producers.\n\nMr. WATERS: I had a couple of movies I wanted to do and I knew that this one\n\nwas one obsession I had that was possibly palatable to movie executives. So I\n\nthought I'd better go with this one.\n\nGROSS: How did you pitch it to movie executives?\n\nMr. WATERS: I got up and did the dances in front of them...\n\nGROSS: Oh, you're kidding. That's great.\n\nMr. WATERS: ...for one thing, and they were so startled that they realized I\n\nwas serious about it. I played them the music. I got a development deal for\n\nit. It was done very conventionally.\n\nGROSS: Oh, that's not conventional, going and doing the dances...\n\nMr. WATERS: You ever been to a pitch session? I don't know. You got to\n\nsell the movie. You've got about 10 minutes.\n\nGROSS: Do you have a less-saleable version in your mind, like...\n\nMr. WATERS: No.\n\nGROSS: ...a really more--mm-hmm.\n\nMr. WATERS: I didn't calculate this to be, `Oh, this is going to be more\n\ncommercial.' I mean, I thought the subject matter had a chance to be\n\ncertainly, but it wasn't certainly--I didn't make a movie I didn't want to\n\nmake. I didn't cut anything out to go wider or anything like that. It just\n\ncame out this way, and it was an obsession. I mean, I thought it would be\n\ninappropriate to have sex and gore in this. Because that wasn't part of this\n\nwhole memory. I think it's still a John Waters movie but it's PG, which I\n\nthink it's great. I wish it was G, because that's the only way left that\n\npeople are surprised, and all my films have been based on surprise.\n\nGROSS: There are some regulars, people who have worked with you in many of\n\nyour movies who are featured in your new movie. Divine...\n\nMr. WATERS: Right.\n\nGROSS: ...is in it. Mink Stole is in it. But there are some new people who\n\nhave never been in your movies before...\n\nMr. WATERS: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...Like Tracy Lords.\n\nMr. WATERS: Well, well, we have Tracy, who is--Ricki Lake. Certainly Debbie\n\nHarry, who I'd worked with a little bit. She wrote part of the music for\n\n\"Polyester.\" Jerry Stiller, who plays Divine's husband. Sonny Bono, who plays\n\nsort of the villain in it.\n\nGROSS: Why were you so anxious to cast Sonny Bono...\n\nMr. WATERS: Oh, I always just liked Sonny Bono. I mean, you never say, no\n\ncasting agent ever says, `Get me a Sonny Bono type.' There's only one Sonny\n\nBono, and that's what I like, is actors that they're unique. And everybody\n\nknows who Sonny Bono is.\n\n(Soundbite of \"Hairspray\")\n\nMr. SONNY BONO: (as Franklin von Tussle) I had some new campaign fliers made\n\nup today, all for Daddy's little girl! I want you to hand those out at the\n\nhop tonight, to everyone, each and every one of those.\n\nMs. COLLEEN FITZPATRICK: (As Amber von Tussle): Oh, Daddy!\n\nMs. DEBBIE HARRY: (As Velma von Tussle) No lip from you, Miss Ingrate. This\n\ncampaign is costing us an arm and a leg.\n\nMr. BONO: (as Franklin von Tussle) New gowns. Hairdresser three times a\n\nweek. Why, your hairspray bill alone is enough to eat up all the profits from\n\nthe Tilt-a-Whirl.\n\nMs. HARRY: (As Velma von Tussle) You'll do as Daddy says or we'll send you\n\nto Catholic school where you belong, right, Franklin?\n\nMr. BONO: (as Franklin von Tussle) That's right!\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nGROSS: I'll bet a lot of real odd characters send you resumes all the time,\n\nfiguring like, `Well, I'm kind of freaky. Waters would really love me for his\n\nnext movie.'\n\nMr. WATERS: Yeah, but they're real wrong because the people that are freaky\n\nin real life generally make terrible actors. Good actors, actually, in real\n\nlife are shy and very quiet people a lot of the time.\n\nGROSS: Gee, why do you think that's true?\n\nMr. WATERS: I don't know. They come alive with a camera, where people that\n\nare always on in real life, as soon as the camera comes on, tend to be very\n\nstilted sometimes.\n\nGROSS: Hm. You cast Divine in a dual role.\n\nMr. WATERS: Yeah, well, Divine played a--he's played a man in my other\n\nfilms, too. In \"Female Trouble\" he's a dual role but in this he plays like, I\n\nthink kind of a lovable mom, Edna Turnblad, and then he also plays an evil\n\nstation manager who won't let blacks on the show. And we wanted to make him\n\ntotally unrecognizable. We have new teeth made for him...\n\nGROSS: No kidding?\n\nMr. WATERS: I mean, so that he even talks--his face is shaped different. He\n\ntalks differently because all the teeth are fake. So I liked him in it. I\n\nthought he looked like sort of scary almost as a man. It's his male\n\nimpersonation.\n\nGROSS: Divine makes such a sympathetic housewife.\n\nMr. WATERS: Yeah. And I don't think--I think it's really, so far, been very\n\nencouraging, that both the Variety review and the Hollywood Reporter review\n\nhad talked a lot about Divine and never mentioned that he was a man. It\n\ndidn't matter any more that Divine's a man, which I think is good because he's\n\nnot a transvestite. He doesn't wear those clothes when he's not making a\n\nmovie. You can't even call him a drag queen. What self-respecting drag queen\n\nwould allow himself to look as hideous as he looks at the beginning of\n\n\"Hairspray\"? So he's basically, he's a character actor.\n\nGROSS: There are a lot of teenagers in the movie. Were they familiar with\n\nyour early work? Did you want them to see...\n\nMr. WATERS: No. I didn't want them to see them, and I discouraged them from\n\nseeing them. And I actually just talked to two of them who rented them all\n\nthis week and saw it and they liked them, but that's because they got\n\ncomfortable with us and they knew everybody, and by the end--I think if they'd\n\nseen those films in the very beginning before we shot it, it might have\n\nfrightened some of them.\n\nGROSS: It might have changed their acting performance too...\n\nMr. WATERS: Yeah. yeah.\n\nGROSS: They might have thought that you wanted something...\n\nMr. WATERS: More hateful or more over the top. Yeah.\n\nGROSS: Yeah. Exactly, exactly. You wrote the movie, as well...\n\nMr. WATERS: Oh, yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...as well as directed it and co-produced it. So the actors are\n\nsaying your lines. How do you feel about actors improvising on your lines?\n\nMr. WATERS: I generally don't like it, because I shoot the exact script and\n\nit screws up people's timing if somebody throws in a line and they don't know\n\nthe next one's coming. If we do any improvisation, we do it in rehearsal...\n\nGROSS: Mm-hmm.\n\nMr. WATERS: ...when we realize that there's a dead point where somebody has\n\nto walk across the room or there's just dead silence. We'll work that out in\n\nimprov. Or when we do it the run-through before we do the take. But mostly I\n\ngive producers the script that I turn in. I film exactly that.\n\nGROSS: You shot the movie on location in Baltimore. There was a time in your\n\nearly film career when you'd have to shoot on the sly and run from the police.\n\nMr. WATERS: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: We did that once, in one shot, because this time we dealt with a city\n\nand we dealt with the state and we had permits. We had police closing the\n\nstreets and everything, which was amazing to me still that you could take over\n\na neighborhood and everybody just says `OK.' I mean, the police would wake up\n\npeople at 5 in the morning and say, `You have to move your car. They're\n\nmaking a movie,' and people wouldn't give a peep of not wanting to do it,\n\nwhich amazed me.\n\nBut one day we had to get a shot, and they told us we couldn't block the\n\nstreet off because it was rush hour, and we just went and did it anyway, and\n\nit was really fun, that hit and run. I hadn't done that in so long. It was\n\njust one little shot we had to get. We jumped out of the car, we set up real\n\nquick, and before anything could happen we got it and ran. But it was a great\n\nfeeling.\n\nMr. WATERS: OK, John Waters, thanks a lot.\n\nGROSS: Thank you.\n\nMr. WATERS: John Waters, recorded in 1988. He wrote and directed the\n\noriginal movie \"Hairspray,\" which was adapted into the hit Broadway show, and\n\nhas now been adapted into a movie musical directed by Adam Shankman, who we\n\nheard from earlier.\n\nYou can download podcasts of our show by going to our Web site,\n\nfreshair.npr.org.\n\n(Credits)\n\nGROSS: I'm Terry Gross. We'll close with music from the soundtrack of the\n\nnew film.\n\n(Soundbite of \"Hairspray\")\n\nUnidentified Singers: (Singing) Because you can't stop the beat!\n\nEver since you first saw the light\n\nEvery woman loves to shake it on a Saturday night\n\nAnd so we're going to shake...(unintelligible)...with all of my might\n\nCause you can't stop the..."
