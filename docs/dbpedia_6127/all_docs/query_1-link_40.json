        "text": "A spirited and enjoyable example of the growing film-to-musical-to-musical-film genre, Hairspray remains faithful to John Waters' 1988 original, which combined a fluffily camp parody of 1962 Baltimore with pointed pleas for tolerance. It was anti-fattist, anti-racist and pro all the loopy dance crazes crammed between the Twist and the Beatles' arrival (the \"stricken chicken\" is one; I don't believe it ever existed, but plenty of equally daft ones did).\n\nThe casting is true to Waters too: for the original film's Divine, Adam Shankman gives us a fatsuited John Travolta and for evil station boss Debbie Harry, we get the equally malignant and fun Michelle Pfeiffer. Typically of a movie full of cross-referencing in-jokes, this means you get a memory blast of Grease 2 as well as Grease, and isn't that the piano-straddling red dress Pfeiffer wore in The Fabulous Baker Boys that she's chosen to seduce Christopher Walken in? Hairspray's full of memory-twiggers like that as well as coming up with a soundtrack, all sung competently by the cast, that parodies its era far better than Dreamgirls did and stirs memories of the half-forgotten (Lesley Gore and Neil Sedaka) as much as more familiar Brill Building classics.\n\nIt also provides a sharp reminder of an era when blacks were marginalised, with a hair-care ad that promises: \"Every kink will be gone in a blink\" and with a \"Negro day\" allowing black dancers on to the teen dance TV show that obsesses our heroine, played beautifully by newcomer Nikki Blonsky.\n\nYoungsters likely to be drawn in by some more smart casting (Amanda Bynes and High School Musical's Zac Ephron) will be unaware how shockingly true this was in a country whose black music had to be covered by white musicians before the majority could hear it. Director Shankman doubles as choreographer, so the dance scenes are expert and it's hard to imagine the film achieving its purpose much better, though a trim here and there would have been beneficial. My main disappointment was that, although Travolta treads the boards nimbly through all that blubber, they missed a chance to let Walken rip. He's a trained hoofer who once, in King of New York, gave interracial dancing a good name. Along with a number of cameos from the original, Waters makes an early appearance. As a flasher."
