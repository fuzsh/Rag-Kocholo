But what’s different from even the last three years is just how widespread the media has become. Today’s teens spend an average of 10 hours and 45 minutes absorbing media in just one day, which includes the amount of time spent watching TV, listening to music, watching movies, reading magazines and using the internet. This is a generation that’s been raised watching reality TV – observing bodies transformed on Extreme Makeover; faces taken apart and pieced back together on I Want a Famous Face. They are, as Tina Fey puts it, bombarded by \"a laundry list of attributes women must have to qualify as beautiful.”\n\nJournal Entry: America The Beautiful By Darryl Roberts\n\n763 Words | 4 Pages\n\nEssentially, industries decrease people self-esteem in order to make money and sell their advertised products. Companies advertise the “perfect” body that even the models do not have because of edited images, all the while contradicting themselves saying “be yourself”, then promoting unrealistic standards. Roberts inductive thesis fell at the end of the film, stating that the promise of being beautiful leading to a better life, is propaganda and that women’s health is not as important as corporate profit. The primary appeal in this documentary is the appeal to authority.\n\nA Rhetorical Analysis Of Victoria's Secret\n\n948 Words | 4 Pages\n\nThe models in the advertisement are far from average American women. The models represent the “ideal” American doll with tall, long legs; a “naturally” tanned complexion; and a waist size under 26 inches. Many Americans resonate with and aspire to achieve this image of beauty—regardless of how infeasible it may be. Consequently, when the Victoria’s Secret models kickbox, rock climb, or run on the beach, the audience desires the same look when they work out. So, the next time that a young woman shops for some new workout clothes, she buys from Victoria’s Secret because she’ll be one step closer to looking like a VS\n\nHow Does Adversity Affect Horace's Character\n\n434 Words | 2 Pages\n\nIn the musical Hairspray, main character Tracy Turnblad questions whether it is righteous that blacks and white be separated on television. After auditioning and being cast onto The Corny Collins Show, a local teen dance television show, Tracy befriends Maybelle, the host of the monthly \"Negro Day\". Through this friendship, Tracy realizes that all humans deserve to be treated equally, and initiates a campaign for racial integration on television. Had Tracy remained at home with her prejudiced white family, and never been exposed to the blatant racial inequality behind the scenes of the show and its effect on the careers of its African American dancers, Tracey never would have realized the fault in the principle of “separate but equal.”. She would have remained narrow-minded, with a different set of values.\n\nEthos Pathos Logos In Miss Representation\n\n715 Words | 3 Pages\n\nOne of the interviewee, Ariella, a high school student expressed her emotion in the documentary: \"We see so much in the media that there so much negativity towards woman and their weight and how they look and it just a representation of the pressure we feel to confirm to men's ideals. There this concept of the perfect woman who look this certain way and because if a woman doesn't like this way they are scrutinized. \" The interviewee truly expresses her emotion during the interview thus creates a strong emotional mood for the documentary. Also the fact that a high school student is fully aware of this issue will truly appeal to the audience. The viewers will highly sympathize each interviewee since this experience is from their own personal experience.\n\nBarbie Dystopianis Duhamel Analysis\n\n805 Words | 4 Pages\n\nThis constant fixation on physical perfection has created unreasonable beauty standards for women, ones we cannot possibly achieve on our own.

A major point of this is the idea of excessive thinness for women, which the advertising industry is dominantly influencing how women need to meet this standard. Kilbourne argues that advertising and the media cause women to believe this is the only standard and we must meet it. A recent advertisement in Glamour magazine for Kashi cereal “GoLEAN Crunch”, is a great example of how women are represented and materialized in today’s society. This advertisement supports and contradicts Kilbourne’s argument that advertisers depict women as powerless, in-shape and perfectly beautified to meet the standard created by the media.\n\nHair Analysis Essay\n\n615 Words | 3 Pages\n\nHello ladies and gentlemen, my name is Sandy Doan.
