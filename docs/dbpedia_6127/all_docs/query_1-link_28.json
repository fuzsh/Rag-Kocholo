        "text": "Live TV musicals always promise to be extravaganzas, and Hairspray Live! kept that promise. Despite its moments of sound glitches (as all live productions inevitably contain) and the fact that we wish it leaned all the way into its themes at such a tense time in our country, it was a pretty solid rendition of one of the most timeless musicals (which is based on the cult John Waters film).\n\nOf course, when any “new” version of a musical or movie is made, we can’t help but compare it to its predecessors. What did they do differently? What did they change? What did they keep? Hairspray Live! is in a unique spot in that it’s actually the fourth incarnation of the story. And technically, there have been hundreds of versions of Hairspray, if you take into account all the National Tours, the London West End production, and countless community and regional theaters."
