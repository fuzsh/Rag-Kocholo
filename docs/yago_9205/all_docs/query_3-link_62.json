        "text": "Emilio Estefan has been instrumental in shaping, developing, and directing the careers of his superstar wife, Gloria, as well as Shakira, Ricky Martin, Marc Anthony, Jon Secada, Alejandro Fernandez, Thalia, Carlos Vives, and Jennifer López, among many others. His ability to connect with their talent, expression, and creativity has been vital in establishing a musical presence second to none. His resume includes over 30 Grammy nominations and 19 Grammy Awards.\n\nPresident Obama honored both Emilio and Gloria with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, presented to individuals who have made especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, to world peace, or to cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.\n\nON YOUR FEET!, the critically acclaimed Broadway musical based on the lives and music of Emilio and Gloria Estefan, opened on November 5, 2015. The Estefans are the executive producers of the show, a story of two people who—through an unwavering dedication to one another and their pursuit of the American dream—showcased their talent, their music, and their heritage to the world in a remarkable rise to global superstardom. The musical is set to Gloria’s chart-topping, worldwide smash hits with one new original song written by Gloria and their daughter Emily Estefan.\n\nEstefan is one of only a few people who produce events for both the general market and the Hispanic market. He has produced the Latin Grammys on CBS, the Hispanic Heritage Awards on NBC, and Nuestra Navidad on Univision, as well as high-profile musical productions on HBO and Showtime. He was tapped by President Barack Obama to the committee that will create the first National Museum of the American Latino.\n\nEstefan has not only proven that the Latin community at large is vital for the evolution of pop music, but he has been instrumental in breaking down barriers that limited its exposure and acceptance around the world. He has continually experimented and pushed the envelope of blending Latin, pop, and world rhythms that have created a unique style and personality. After more than a quarter of a century producing music for some of the biggest and brightest stars in the music business, Estefan has also put his focus on the television and movie industry. His main objective is to shatter the stereotypes that have been a part of the Latin community for decades in film and TV. In 2008, he produced and directed his first full-length documentary film, 90 Millas, based on the pioneers and history of Cuban music. The film received critical accolades after premiering in the Tribecca Film Festival, the Dubai Film Festival, and the Miami International Film Festival.\n\nEmilio and Gloria Estefan created The Gloria Estefan Foundation with the purpose of supporting various organizations with a specific vision of working toward research and a cure for spinal cord injuries and for various illnesses that affect children all over the world."
