        "text": "MEXICO CITY — Mexican actress Columba Dominguez, who worked with director Luis Bunuel during Mexico’s golden age of cinema, died at 85 on Wednesday of unknown causes.\n\nDominguez, recipient of a lifetime achievement award at Mexico’s Ariel Awards ceremony last year, appeared in more than 60 films and TV series throughout a career that spanned six decades. She is best known for the lead role in the Bunuel drama The River and Death and for Pueblerina, a romantic drama from renowned writer-director Emilio Fernandez.\n\nDominguez’s nephew Giuliano Molina, who made the announcement of the death via Twitter, posted a picture Wednesday of his aunt and Fernandez having drinks with Marilyn Monroe.\n\nDominguez was a second cousin of Babel screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga."
