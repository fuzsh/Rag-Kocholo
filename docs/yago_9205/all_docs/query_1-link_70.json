        "text": "Gabriel Figueroa is regarded as one of the most important Mexican cinematographers of the Twentieth century during the so-called Golden Age of Mexican cinema. From the 1930s through the early 1980s he helped to forge an evocative and enduring image of the country. In the 1930s Figueroa was part of a vibrant community of artists in Mexico working in many media, including the painters and printmakers Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco, and photographers Edward Weston and Manuel Álvarez Bravo who sought to convey the country’s transformation following the 1910–20 Mexican Revolution.\n\nThis group of screenprints were made from photographs (stills) from various of Figueroa's films."
