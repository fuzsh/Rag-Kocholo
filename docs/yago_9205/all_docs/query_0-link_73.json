Two slight tears in the image, visible from the verso. Image 32x 41.4cm. Sheet 35.7 x 45.6 cm. Grabado para la película pueblerina 1948 grabado en linóleo.Gracias al éxito de su colaboración con Emilio Fernández, los grabados de Leopoldo Méndez ilustraron películas posteriores, como Pueblerina (Emilio Fernández, 1948) y El rebozo de Soledad (Roberto Gavaldón, 1952).The establishment of the print collective known as the Taller de Gráfica Popular (Workshop of Popular Graphic Art, TGP) in Mexico City in 1937 best expresses the symbiosis between prints and politics that had developed in Mexico. Its founders, Leopoldo Méndez (1902?1969), Luis Arenal (1908/9?1985) and Pablo (Paul) O'Higgins (1904?1983), were committed communists who abandoned mural painting to concentrate on printmaking, - El Carrusel.
