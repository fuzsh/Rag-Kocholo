        "text": "Community Partners: Mexican Cultural Institute and CUNY Mexican Studies Institute\n\nFilm at Lincoln Center and the Locarno Film Festival announce “Spectacle Every Day: Mexican Popular Cinema,” a sweeping retrospective of Mexican cinema from the 1940s through the 1960s, to be presented at FLC from July 26 through August 8. With new restorations of many works rarely screened or some never before seen theatrically in the United States, and standout performances from the biggest screen stars of their day, this series offers New York audiences the rare opportunity to experience the breadth of this unique period of Mexican film history on the big screen.\n\nThe 1940s to the 1960s in México was a remarkably creative era, marked by influential filmmakers like Roberto Gavaldón and Emilio Fernández, and iconic screen figures such as María Félix and Cantinflas. This series delves into the rich and diverse films of this period, highlighting both well-known and lesser-recognized works. It explores a range of genres—from noir and comedy to melodrama, 3-D adventure, and horror—showcasing the era's impact on popular culture through grand productions set in vibrant settings like wrestling rings, cabarets, haciendas, and bustling cities.\n\nThe 1940s to the 1960s in México was a remarkably creative era, marked by influential filmmakers like Roberto Gavaldón and Emilio Fernández, and iconic screen figures such as María Félix and Cantinflas.

[1948], Wetbacks [1955], The Mind and the Crime [1961]) and Roberto Gavaldón (The Night Falls [1952], Autumn Days [1963]); the sex work melodrama Streetwalker (1951) from Matilde Landeta, one of the country's first female directors; and the first 3-D film produced in México, The Sword of Granada (1953).\n\n“Spectacle Every Day: Mexican Popular Cinema” is sponsored by MUBI, the global streaming service, production company and film distributor dedicated to elevating great cinema. Organized by Tyler Wilson and Cecilia Barrionuevo in partnership with the Locarno Film Festival and with support from Cinema Tropical. This program was selected from the retrospective curated by Olaf Möller and Roberto Turigliatto at the 2023 Locarno Film Festival."
