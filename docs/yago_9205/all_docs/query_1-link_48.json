The Gonzalez brothers, Ramiro andJulio, the richest men in the village greet him with hostility. Six years before, Julio had raped Paloma, Aurelio’s fiancée, in turn, wounded Julio with a gun shot and was sent to prison. Aurelio, however, is not interested in vengeance. He just wants to work his land in peace. Rejected by the villagers, Paloma lives outside of town with her son, Felipe. She is too ashamed to see Aurelio again. But they are in still in love with each other and Aurelio manages to marry her. They work hard together and manage to have a good harvest, but, unfortunately, the Gonzalez brothers are the only people who can afford to buy their crop. Aurelio manages to find another customer and, with part of his earnings, buys himself a gun. Aurelio’s difficulties lead him to decide to leave the village once and for all. On his way out, he meets up with the Gonzalez, with whom he exchanges gun shots. The Gonzalez brothers die and Aurelio continues on his way with his family."
