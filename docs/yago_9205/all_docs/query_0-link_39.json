        "text": "When Aurelio gets out of jail after a six year sentence for shooting his brother who had sexually abused his girlfriend Paloma, he returns to his village to find his mother dead and his house in ruins. His brothers Ramiro and Julio are the notables of the village and try to make out, in front of the good deputy R칩mulo, that he has escaped from prison. Aurelio only wants to farm his land in peace without taking his revenge. Despite this, Julio threatens him so that he will leave the town. To begin with, Paloma, who lives with her small son Felipe in an isolated shack, refuses him. Then, despite Julio taunts, Aurelio marries her, but only three detainees come to the wedding. As time goes by and by making a lot of sacrifices, the couple manage to reap a good harvest. But his brothers' ostracism is so intense that Aurelio buys a pistol. Since Julio wants to remain with Felipe, and R칩mulo suggests that the couple should go, Aurelio leaves with his family and kills his brothers."
