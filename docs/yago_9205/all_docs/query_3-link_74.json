        "meta_description": "Emilio Fernández received a degree and later a PhD in Biology from the University of Oviedo. He was a post-doctoral research fellow at Plymouth Marine Laboratory (UK) and the Rosenstiel School for Marine and Atmospheric Sciences of the University of Miami (USA) and at the Spanish Research Council (CSIC). He took a position as lecturer of Marine Ecology at the Faculty of Marine Science of the University of Vigo in 1995. Since 2011, he is full professor of Ecology at the same university. His research has been mainly focused on the study of biologically-mediated fluxes of matter and energy in marine systems in relation to environmental changes. During his already extended scientific career he made significant contributions in several research topics, namely: inorganic and organic carbon production by coccolithophorids, phytoplankton-mediated DOC production, coupling between phytoplankton production and physical fields and responses of microbial plankton to nutrient inputs of different nature. At present, he is interested in the assessment of the role of phytoplankton-bacteria interactions on the response of microbial communities to inputs of matter in the context of global change. His scientific interests broaden over the last six years when new research questions focused on the ecology of seagrass meadows, sustainable territorial planning or on the link between sustainable development and circular economy were addressed. PhD Thesis and scientific papers in JCR-indexed journals, some of them highly cited, were delivered in the three new research lines. Principal scientist of 18 research projects funded by regional, national and European agencies, his scientific record is summarized in more than 175 scientific papers, 134 of them published in journals included in the JCR index. His research has been highly cited (4820 cites; WoS H-index: 39). He was the Spanish representative in the Scientific Committee for Oceanographic Research from 1999-2005. He acted as manager of the Spanish National Plan for Marine Science and Technology from 1013 to 2018. He is currently collaborator of the CTM area of the Spanish State Research Agency and coordinates the Ecology and Biodiversity area of the Andalucian Agency for Research. Since 2009 to 2018 acted as Director of the International Campus of Excellence in marine sciences led by the University of Vigo. He also served in the Regional Government of Galicia from 2005 to 2009, when he was nominated as General Director of Sustainable Development, with competencies in environmental research and climate change policies. Except for that period, he has been the coordinator of the Biological Oceanography Research Group at the University of Vigo throughout most of his scientific career. His activity in the formation of young scientists is illustrated by the 15 PhD thesis supervised together with 26 Master’s degree thesis and 21 Graduate degree thesis. Most of the PhD students he supervised are currently in permanent or quasi-permanent scientific positions leading their own research or working as Research Technicians in research centers. One of them is currently professor of ecology (EM), three are senior lecturers (PS, ET, BM), one is assistant lecturer (ML), one recently obtained a Ramón y Cajal Post-Doctoral position (SM) or a distinguished researcher (MA), four of them are occupying research technical positions (PP, JG, MR), and one has just initiated his postdoctoral period (BS). All along his professional career he has been actively involved in teaching and dissemination of environmental and marine scientific knowledge. As a result, not only outreach activities were carried out but also dissemination articles were delivered and papers in JCR journals centered on environmental education were published.",
