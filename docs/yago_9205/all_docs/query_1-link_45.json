        "text": "Recipient of the 2013 Ariel de Oro—the equivalent of a lifetime achievement award—actress and singer Columba Dominguez (1929–2014) started with small roles alongside fellow damas de la pantalla María Elena Marqués (La Perla) and María Félix (Río Escondito) before her star-making turn as Paloma in Emilio Fernández’s final film to focus on village life. Entered into competition at the third-ever Cannes Film Festival, the film’s major platform helped launch Dominguez into international stardom, leading to opportunities in Europe, chances to work with world-renowned filmmakers such as Luis Buñuel, and a recording contract with RCA.\n\nDIRECTED/WRITTEN BY: Emilio Fernández. WITH: Columba Domínguez, Roberto Cañedo, Arturo Soto Rangel, Manuel Dondé. 1949. 111 min. Mexico. B&W. Spanish. DCP. Courtesy of Cineteca Nacional de Mexico.
