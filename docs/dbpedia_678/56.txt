Celebrate the diversity of Iranian cinema in this annual festival offering varying perspectives on the complexity of Persian life and culture.

No Men Allowed by Rambod Javan (Iran, 2011, 100 min.). Do opposites attract? Pariya believes if her strict headmaster Ms. Darabi finds loves, she’ll loosen the school’s strict rules. When Mr. Jebeli becomes the school’s first male teacher, Pariya decides to play matchmaker, but Ms. Darabi is looking for a win in the country’s chemistry competition, not a husband. Directed by one of Iran’s most popular TV comedy stars, No Entry for Men is a refreshing and hilarious take on the romantic comedy—a genre that’s popular in Iran, but rarely seen outside the country.
