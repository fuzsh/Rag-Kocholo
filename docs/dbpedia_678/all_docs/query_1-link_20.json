        "text": "Some actors in the history of cinema and television are masters of playing complementary roles. Walter Brennan, the late Parviz Fanizadeh, Jupshi and Parviz Poursamimi are among those who shine in their roles and make the actors of the main roles visible.\n\nAsghar Rahdari, an actor in comedy series, is also an actor who shines in his role as a man who can be a pimp and a restaurant cook in a thief and a police officer who creates his acting style - against Hooman Barghnavard and Behnam Tashkar Komadi - or world champion Be. The zealous man who, after his sister’s suicide, wants to put his right hand on his palm, or Firooz, the evil janitor, and the shrewd water of the Doctors' Building series, which dates back to Dr. Nima’s time. During his professional career, Heydari has collaborated with directors such as Reza Mir Karimi (Under the Moonlight), Mehran Modir in the series Grand Prix, Dot China, Nights of the Lambs, Man of the Thousand Faces, Mehdi Fakhimzadeh in the Breath and Fereydoun Jirani in the Star. We have talked with Heydari about his appearances in TV comedy works and his collaboration with comedy directors such as Mehran Modiri, Soroush Sehat, etc.\n\nCollaborate with most comedy greats on TV. Are you just interested in acting in comedy series?\n\nMost of our acting suggestions are in the field of comedy and comedy. Of course, in my career, there are many serious films and series such as Star, Under the Moonlight, Shout Silently, Co-Soul, Wife, Murder in Building 85, and so on. After playing in a few successful comedy series. The director’s and producer’s friends were kind enough to offer me more of these types of maps to play.\n\nMost audiences remember your games on TV more than movies.\n\nHowever, television is a popular medium, and acting on a large scale can be seen in all parts of the country. Playing in cinemas also has its own characteristics and sweets. Most Iranians watch TV, and watching TV is one of the entertainments of all walks of life, but the audience chooses to go to the movies to go to the movies, so the situation is different. I am also known as a TV actor due to my large number of appearances in television works, and I am happy about that.\n\nYou also played a different role with the young Rambod in the series Passengers.\n\nIn previous years, I was supposed to collaborate with the young Rambod, but this time it was not possible for any reason, such as being involved in projects and interfering with the work, and the last example of this was the film The Girl of Adam and the Son of Eve. Passengers had the opportunity to work with Rambod.\n\nFrom the beginning, you were supposed to play the role of a real estate agent.\n\nYes, most of the 90-episode work, such as writing and filming, is almost simultaneous, and it is played at the same time, and we notice feedback. Gradually, the role of this person in real estate transactions became more prominent. Friends are kind, and in most of the non-fiction I played, they gradually made the role bolder and longer. In Saeed Aga Khani’s standard sick series, which was aired on Eid TV, my role was again brief and concise at the beginning of writing the screenplay. After playing in several episodes and the charms of the criminal gang, these aspects of the script became more widespread.\n\nWhat do you believe in acting?\n\nThe style of play is determined by the type and gender of the role and the genre of the work. I’ve done most of the comedy I’ve played. In front of the comedian, I face the serious comedy that I play. I remember I created fun moments with Reza Shafieejam and Mehran Modiri in the series Point-to-Site series, and the complementary role in this kind of work is very important, and if it doesn’t work properly, the whole work will be challenged and jokes about the audience will not work. . As for my acting style, I try to use emotion and technique together, and the actor has to deal with both of these areas in order to be successful in his work.\n\nHow much did the presence of partners such as Hamid Lolaei and Rambod Javan in the series \"Passengers\" help you to present a better game?\n\nThe actors in the opposite role and their help in the process of good play are very effective and decisive. I have played with Hamid Lolaei in many series. In Charkhoneh, Thief, Police, and Rooster, I really collaborated effectively with Hamid Lolaei. Like a older brother, Lolaei helps the actors on the stage, including me, and his attention is focused on the actor’s role, and playing with Lolaei is a blessing for any actor. He is one of the best comedians and comedians on television. Apart from being a director, the young Rambod was also a playwright, and he is a capable actor in this field. The young man is really literate and has a good sense of humor, and he spends a lot of time and energy on his work.\n\nIn the series Barreh Nights, you played a different typical role as Dr. Jacoel.\n\nThe story of the Nights of the Lambs series is different from all the other series. Barreh nights were unexpectedly welcomed by the audience, and the streets were deserted during the broadcast, and everyone went to their homes to watch the series. My acting in this series also had good reflections among the people. In terms of characterization, in the story of the Nights of the Lambs series, all the people in the genre had some glass and had a secret life with them. Of course, in normal life, some people have such traits. On the nights of Barreh, this life was stealthy, and people were very interested in it. Usually, most of the managerial work is characterized by the fact that the engine of the story of the sex and characterization of the actors is formed slowly and slowly.\n\nFirooz Doctors Building seems to be one of your best games in 90-part work.\n\nI love Firooz very much, and from the very first day of my work, I became accustomed to this role. In my personal life, I am a warm, funny and funny person, and in friendly and family gatherings, no one can stand around me in this field, and I am a warm-hearted member of parliament, and I do not fail to make jokes. The screenplay of the Doctors' Building is one of the best texts written by Peyman Ghasemkhani, which processed the characters well and the overall atmosphere of the story was very accurate.\n\nWhich actor and director do you feel most comfortable with and joke with?\n\nI am very comfortable working with Saeed Aga Khani and we have a fun and attractive behind the scenes. I have been friends with Saeed for many years and he is a real human being and he never hurts anyone. Among the actors, while maintaining respect for Hamid Lolaei, I am very comfortable. You can’t be with him and not joke.\n\nDo you remember the TV shows you played?\n\nIn the doctors' building, Peyman and Ghasemkhani’s altar were joking about my independence, because they are both from Persepolis, and at that time Persepolis had lost a few games to Esteghlal, and I was harassing them. Both of them are writing a sequence in which I am from Persepolis and I am wearing a red dress. They took revenge on me and I had to turn my head and face red and put on Karim Bagheri’s red shirt and praise Persepolis and read Kerry and Kerry for the independents.\n\nI make ID cards for roles\n\nBusiness people and real estate consultants need to be smart and talkative. Usually, I gradually create the IDs for the roles I play, and then the character, the interaction with the director and the writer come together, and especially in the 90s every night than the night before. As a result, the game becomes more mature."
