        "text": "Rambod Javan began stage acting in 1991.\n\nThree years later, he came into the spotlight with a short role in 'The Spouses' (1995) and found fame after appearing in the series 'Green House' (1995).\n\nHe is more known as a comedic actor.\n\nIn 2002, he directed his first series, 'Lost', which was broadcast during the fasting month of Ramadan and was well-received by both viewers and critics.\n\nRambod made his film-directing debut with 'Spaghetti in 8 minutes' (2005) and received a Fajr International Film Festival Crystal Simorgh for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for 'Sinners' (2012).\n\nThe diverse roles he took on in 'Mummy 3' (1999) and 'A Place of Love' (2000) established him as a versatile actor.\n\nMany critics, however, believe 'Pink' (2003) was the apex of his acting career. He was nominated for a Fajr International Film Festival Crystal Simorgh for Best Actor for 'Pink'.\n\nRambod has appeared in many other series and movies, including 'Born Again' (1997), 'Help Me' (1997), 'The Magic Coat' (1998), 'Maxx' (2004), 'Souvenir from Abroad' (2006), 'The Music Box' (2007), 'Adam's Son, Eve's Daughter' (2009), 'No Men Allowed' (2009), 'The Lab' (2011), and 'Conditional Release' (2013).\n\nJavan appeared in an episode of the popular TV series, \"The Spouses.\" He also appeared in the television series, \"The Green House,\" playing the humorous character Farid Sabahi."
