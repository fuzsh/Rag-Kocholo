        "text": "The annual celebration of the Association of Critics and Writers of Iranian Theatre Forum honored theatre director, writer and actor Farhad Ayish, on Thursday (August 20) at Eivan-e-Shams Hall in Tehran.\n\nAyish who was venerated for a lifetime of artistic works received his prize from the veteran actor, Naser Malek-Motiee, at the 14th edition of the event, ISNA reported\n\nExplaining artistic creativity, Ayish said, “The solitude of the human being leads him to create art; in fact man tries to escape his ‘eternal loneliness’ by getting involved in art”.\n\nBorn in Tehran, Ayish, 63, studied directing and photography in the UK and the US. He directed and acted in a number of plays and films in English and Persian in Iran and abroad.\n\n“I feel invigorated tonight as I see that old and new faces are still keenly working to improve national theatre,” Malek-Motiee said.\n\nBorn in Tehran, Malek-Motiee, 85, has starred in numerous cinema and television shows. He was a popular star of Iranian cinema in the 1950s and 1960s, when he acted in over 50 movies.\n\nHe made his debut in cinema at 19. After seven years of acting in different movies and establishing himself, he started performing in plays.\n\nHe returned to cinema after a 30-year hiatus, with ‘Negar’s Role’ directed by Ali Atshani, which is due for release soon.\n\nComedy & Humor\n\nAnother veteran actor Nosratolah Vahdat, 90, said, “I have always wanted to laugh and make others laugh as I believe comedy, and satire and humor are the most popular forms of art”.\n\nHe said he never felt tired of acting in movies, and even now after 60 years in the field, “I am still eager to go on stage.”\n\nBorn in Isfahan, Vahdat is a comedian, actor, and director and his professional resume includes over 40 films in which he has either directed or acted. He has also appeared in three plays abroad.\n\nHis 1946 movie ‘Foreign Bride’ was the first Iranian film to win an award abroad and he donated the Golden Dolphin prize to the Cinema Museum in Tehran.\n\nMainly recognized for his cinematic works, he started his career, performing in plays when he was 18. He is known as one of the founders of theater in Isfahan.\n\nStill living in Isfahan, Vahdat is now busy writing his biography.\n\nAt the end of the ceremony the best of theatre in different categories in the last Iranian year (March 21, 2014-March 20, 2015) were awarded.\n\nThe comedy show ‘Khandevaneh’ was selected the best TV program of the year. Rambod Javan, producer and host of the show, received a commendation plaque. Javan was appreciated for promoting theatre and using theatre artists in his program.\n\nThree top plays and theatre groups, the best radio program, the best theatre critic and the best research book of the year were also awarded.\n\nActors Masoud Rayegan, Maedeh Tahmasbi, Sorush Sehat, musician Mohamad Sarir and voice-over actor Mohamad Bahrani were also present."
