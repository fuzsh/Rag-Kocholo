His father is a mechanical engineer and his mother a homemaker. He graduated in mechanical engineering from the Islamic Azad University, South. He has an older brother named Alireza who is a civil engineer and a sister named Atousa who is a German translator, and a younger brother Bardia who is an English translator. Reza Golzar is fluent in English and some Arabic as he was taught Arabic in both high school and pre university before entering music and cinema career. Reza is an established guitarist. He started his career in the entertainment industry as a guitar player in the first pop band in post-revolutionary Iran- Arian Band- which shot to fame for their catchy music and lyrics. They ended up touring many countries. Reza then started his acting career in his first film Sam and Narges by Iraj Ghaderi, who has since passed away. However, Sam and Narges screened after Reza's second attempt at acting in The Last Dinner by Fereydoun Jeyrani, who went on to film festivals and introduced Reza - who had a small role as a young student who falls in love with his university professor- to a larger audience. Since then, Mohammad Reza Golzar has been considered one of the biggest box office actors in Iran. His face has adorned many posters, magazine covers and billboards. He is a sportsman, especially skiing and volleyball, both of which he pursues religiously. He was the captain of the 'Stars Team' in Iran, a volleyball team consisted of stars who competed for charities. He left Arian Band and the Stars Team eventually due to his heavy schedule of filming.\n\nAmin Hayai is an Iranian actor. He has received various accolades, including two Crystal Simorgh, three Hafez Awards and an Iran's Film Critics and Writers Association Honorary Diploma, in addition to nomination for an Iran Cinema Celebration Award. He started acting in theater along with his education. After finishing high school, he entered military service, and also acted in the art center of air force army. In 1991 he acted in a theatrical show for kids with the directorship of Soraya Ghasemi. It took him long to get a main acting role in movies, and he was successful in his first movie Eve's Red Apple. He has also won the best male actor award in Fajr film festival for the film by Rasoul Sadr-Ameli, \"The Night\", in 2008. Hayai appeared in the film Woodpecker in 2018. Hayai also will appear in the film We Like You Miss Yaya which he filmed in 2017. He was awarded the Diploma Honorary for Best Actor for Blazing at the Fajr Film Festival in 2018. In 2019, he became a judge in the first Iranian Talent Show called Asre Jadid Produced by Ehsan Alikhani.\n\nAmir Jafari is an Iranian actor originally from Zanjan province.

In 2008 Modiri left IRIB to star and direct a home-entertainment series; a series which instead of broadcast is released on DVD on a weekly basis, entitled Ghahve-ye Talkh (Bitter Coffee). Although Ghahve-ye Talkh's delay in release put it in second place in terms of innovative media (another series, Ghalb-e Yakhi was released first, making it the first ever such program in Iran), but its sales surpassed its competitor by over double, a revelation which the industry and critics have linked directly with Modiri's popularity with his fans. In 2012, after Ghahve-ye Talkh was completed, Modiri signed on to play the lead role for his competition show, Ghalb-e Yakhi's 3rd Season. Modiri is a writer, director, actor and a recording artist.
