        "text": "Entertainment and Society Blog, Kodoom.com Editorial:\n\nThe recent trip to Canada by another popular Iranian TV host (Rambod Javan) and images of her pregnant (third) wife in Canada without Hijab (Islamic head cover mandated inside Iran) have stirred outrage inside Iran. Rambod Javan works for Iran's government-run state TV and has frequently stated, on air, his love for his homeland Islamic Iran yet he is now in Canada, like many other Persian celebrities, to have his wife deliver their newborn in Canada and receive Canadian citizenship! Javan's conservative as well as liberal critics in Iran now call him a hypocrite.\n\nBut Javan is not the first Iranian celebrity who has applied for residency or citizenship in the US or Canada. It is not difficult now to spot popular Iranian figures on the streets of cities like Los Angeles, Toronto and Vancouver. According to Cinema Press, Benyamin, Mahnaz Afshar, Reza Ghoochan Nejad, Mohammad Reza Golzar, Ronak Younesi, Mohsen Tanabandeh, Shila Khodadad, Sam Derakhshani are but a few of celebrities with residences outside Iran now.\n\nIn fact, some blogs and websites such as PersianUp now dedicate pages to images of Iranian actresses without Hijab when traveling or immigrating from Iran. Here are some examples:\n\nHananeh Shahshahani, a 29-year-old Iranian actress and musician before and after emigrating to the United States:\n\nIranian actress Baharak Saleh Nia is shown here before and after leaving Iran:\n\nAnother actress constantly under attack by conservatives in Iran because of her liberal feminist views about religion and Hijab is Mahnaz Afshar who is married to Yasin Ramin, businessman son of an influential political sentenced in May to seven years in jail, Fars news agency reported. Although moderate and reformist in political views, Yassin Ramin is the son of former culture minister Mohammad Ali Ramin, an ultraconservative who banned several publications in Iran under President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and held an international conference attended by holocaust deniers in Iran in 2006:\n\nOne of the most controversial women on Iranian TV has been Azadeh Namdari, a former host of a popular TV show in Iran whose divorce from another TV host and second marriage became controversial. On 25 July 2017, a video emerged showing Namdari drinking alcohol and without hijab while on vacation in Switzerland. The event drew a backlash on Iranian social media as she was an advocate of black chador (full Islamic body cover) and compulsory Islamic dress code in Iran:\n\nRelated to immigration:\n\nYoungest, Most Successful NBA Agent, is Proud of Persian Heritage\n\nRepublicans Delay US Citizenship Applications, Try to End Birthright Citizenship\n\nList of Iranian Americans and Canadians Running in 2018 Elections, Some Endorsed by Obama\n\nHard Honest Work Pays Off: Iranian Immigrant Develops Successful Organic Farms in Canada\n\nMidwife Offering Iranian Girls Fake Virginity Almost Deported from Canada Over Translation of Female Body Part!\n\nThe Story of a $1.5 Billion Iranian Start Up Formed by a Stanford Graduate\n\nLove of Iranian Girlfriend Costs Norwegian Minister from Anti-immigration Party His Job\n\nThe mass migration of world millionaires, to where?\n\nTrump Insults Immigrants to the US, Compares them to Trash\n\nDaughter of Iranian immigrants wins Green Party seat in New Zealand Parliament\n\nAustralia ignored pleas about Manus Island Iranian asylum seeker before his death\n\nFrench woman risks prison over helping refugee Iranian lover: I would give my life for him\n\nVideo: If World Leaders Were Refugees\n\nIranian Americans among Immigrants from 37 Nationalities Honored on Ellis Island\n\nIranian Dutch football star denied US visa, Calls Trump an idiot\n\nRelated to Hijab:\n\nIranian Pro Footballer and Vivacious Wife Defy Rules of The Game\n\nIranian Female Cyclist Makes History: Asian Bronze for Somayeh Yazdani\n\nA New Use for Augmented Reality: Virtual Catwalk in Iran Removes Face and Body of Women Models\n\nSultry Lebanese Actress Speaks Persian, Covers Up on Iranian TV But Also Speaks Against Bigotry\n\nThe Director of Persian Adaptation of Shakespeare's Play Was Arrested Because of this Video\n\nDaughter of Founding Father of Iran's Islamic Revolution Calls for an End to Theocracy and Mandatory Hijab\n\nVideo of Unprecedented Speech by Iranian Female MP Lashing Out at Clerics and Supreme Leader\n\nIranians appalled by forced TV confessions of a young girl found guilty of dancing!\n\nRadical militia assault deaf women because \"Sign language resembled dancing!\"\n\nIn Pictures: Fashionable actresses defy Hijab in Iran's Fajr Film Festival\n\nIran's Music Festival Disrupted When Chinese Female Musician Loses Head Scarf\n\nAnother Iranian Girl Sneaks Into A Football Stadium with Fake Beard and Mustache\n\nUrged by Iranian Fans and Football Star, Russian Model Covered Up for World Cup Draw\n\nThai Male Coach Wears Headscarf to Sneak Into Women's Match in Iran\n\nIranian women removing Hijab inside their car will receive warning text messages from Morality Police\n\nRelated to Women:\n\nDe Niro Opens Tribeca 2019; Festival Highlights Iranian Short & Cinema360\n\nThe Worldwide Release of Polaris, Starring Bahram Radan and Alicja Bachleda\n\nIranian Parliament Hears Women Victimized by Acid Attack, Approves Eye for an Eye Penalty\n\nIranian Female Cyclist Makes History: Asian Bronze for Somayeh Yazdani\n\nThis Charismatic US Army Major, Surfer, Vegetarian, Presidential Candidate is Against Militarism and War With Iran\n\nJoin Jennifer Lawrence to Help Take Back America: Our Political System is Broken (Video)\n\nTeam led by Iranian Professor in Florida Develops Sensors to Manage Parkinson's\n\nRep.
