Little does she know though that several of her students, led by the self-assured Paria, have a plan to get her to fall in love with him. 'No Men Allowed' is a hilarious, rollicking romcom, chock-full of witty dialogue and zany antics that will have you coming back time and time again!",

        "text": "no men allowed depicts feminists as masculine, aggressive, paranoid and “spinsters”. (one character literally says Mrs Darabi suffers from ترشیدگی).\n\nshe’s an extremist man hater who’s eventually cured by male attention she secretly craved all along. she ends up conforming to societal norms of femininity and wifehood which she had repressed against her female nature all her life in order to perform her extreme radical misandrist views.\n\nand the characters are abusive to the only fat character in the movie.\n\nthis movie is also probably the only Iranian comedy set at a school with the plot driven by teenagers which filled the Iranian teen comedy shaped hole in my heart and I wish there were more of it.\n\nwith everything said, no men allowed is a perfect comedy and a classic and I’ve modeled myself on Mrs Darabi and quote her daily. mother mothered."
