        "text": "British actor and comedian Sacha Baron Cohen was born in Hammersmith, London. He is the son of Daniella (Weiser), a movement instructor, and Gerald Baron Cohen, a clothing store owner. His father, born in England and raised in Wales, was of Eastern European Jewish descent, while his mother was born in Israel, to German Jewish parents. He was educated at a private school, Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School in Hertfordshire, and went on to read History at Christ's College, Cambridge. Baron Cohen had an interest in performing from an early age, forming a breakdancing group as a teenager and acting in amateur plays with a Jewish youth group. While at university he joined the Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club, and took part in such plays as \"Cyrano de Bergerac\" and \"Fiddler on the Roof\".\n\nUpon leaving University, Baron Cohen briefly worked as a model, before moving on to work as a host on a satellite TV station. In 1995, Channel 4 put out an open call for new presenters, and Baron Cohen sent in a tape featuring himself in character as an Albania TV reporter (an early prototype for Borat). He was hired and worked on various 'youth TV' projects before, in 1998, appearing in The 11 O'Clock Show (1998) which became a cult hit thanks to his character, Ali G. Ali G proved so popular that a spin-off show Da Ali G Show (2000) and film Ali G in da House (2002) where produced.\n\nAmerica soon beckoned with a stateside version of Da Ali G Show. Feature film work followed with Baron Cohen providing the voice of Julien in Madagascar (2005) and appearing as Jean Girard alongside Will Ferrell in Ricky Bobby - König der Rennfahrer (2006). He followed this with the smash-hit Borat: Kulturelle Lernung von Amerika um Benefiz für glorreiche Nation von Kasachstan zu machen (2006), for which he won a Golden Globe and was nominated for a writing Oscar. His other film work includes supporting roles in Sweeney Todd: Der teuflische Barbier aus der Fleet Street (2007) and Hugo Cabret (2011), and starring in the title roles of Brüno (2009), Der Diktator (2012), and Der Spion und sein Bruder (2016).\n\nPeter Dinklage is an American actor. Since his breakout role in Station Agent (2003), he has appeared in numerous films and theatre plays. Since 2011, Dinklage has portrayed Tyrion Lannister in the HBO series Game of Thrones: Das Lied von Eis und Feuer (2011). For this he won an Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series and a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Series, Miniseries or Television Film in 2011.\n\nPeter Hayden Dinklage was born in Morristown, New Jersey, to Diane (Hayden), an elementary school teacher, and John Carl Dinklage, an insurance salesman. He is of German, Irish, and English descent. In 1991, he received a degree in drama from Bennington College and began his career. His exquisite theatre work that expresses brilliantly the unique range of his acting qualities, includes remarkable performances full of profoundness, charisma, intelligence, sensation and insights in plays such as \"The Killing Act,\" \"Imperfect Love,\" Ivan Turgenev's \"A Month in the Country\" as well as the title roles in William Shakespeare's \"Richard III\" and in Anton Chekhov's \"Uncle Vanya.\"\n\nPeter Dinklage received acclaim for his first film, Living in Oblivion - Total abgedreht (1995), where he played an actor frustrated with the limited and caricatured roles offered to actors who have dwarfism. In 2003, he starred in Station Agent (2003), written and directed by Tom McCarthy. The movie received critical praise as well as Peter Dinklage's work including nominations such as for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role at the \"Screen Actors Guild\" and Best Male Lead at the \"Film Independent Spirit Awards.\" One of his next roles has been the one of Miles Finch, an acclaimed children's book author, in Buddy - Der Weihnachtself (2003). Find Me Guilty - Der Mafiaprozess (2006), the original English Sterben für Anfänger (2007), its American remake Sterben will gelernt sein (2010), Penelope (2006), Die Chroniken von Narnia - Prinz Kaspian von Narnia (2008) and X-Men: Zukunft ist Vergangenheit (2014) are also included in his brilliant work concerning feature films.\n\nHis fine work in television also includes shows such as Entourage (2004), Life as We Know It (2004), Nemesis: Der Angriff (2005) and Nip/Tuck: Schönheit hat ihren Preis (2003). In 2011, the primary role of Tyrion Lannister, a man of sharp wit and bright spirit, in Game of Thrones: Das Lied von Eis und Feuer (2011), was incarnated with unique greatness in Dinklage's unparalleled performance. The series is an adaptation of author George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, and his work has received widespread praise, also highlighted by his receiving of the Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series at The 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards (2011), The 67th Primetime Emmy Awards (2015), The 70th Primetime Emmy Awards (2018) and The 71st Primetime Emmy Awards (2019) as well as of the Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Series, Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television at [error].\n\nDinklage, among others, has also voiced Captain Gutt in Ice Age 4 - Voll verschoben (2012) and The Mighty Eagle in Angry Birds - Der Film (2016), starred in the comedy horror film Knights Of Badassdom (2013) while his tour-de-force interpretations as a multifarious \"chameleon\" of substantial mastery and artistic generosity also include film and TV gems such as Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017), Three Christs (2017) and I Think We're Alone Now (2018)."
