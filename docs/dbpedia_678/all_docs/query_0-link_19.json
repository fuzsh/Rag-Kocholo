        "text": "2008\n\n1 hr 53 mins\n\nDrama\n\nWatchlist\n\nA child in mourning reaches out to a force beyond this world in this psychological drama from Iran. Ali (Arsalan Ghasemi) is a twelve-year-old boy who hasn't been able to come to terms with the death of his mother. While the boy's father (Shahrokh Forutanian) and grandfather (Dariush Asadzadeh) look after him and try to offer comfort, Ali wants nothing more than to see his mother again. Ali's father is a doctor and the boy sometimes helps out at the pharmacy in a hospital where he works. While at the hospital, Ali becomes aware of a strange interloper named Maleki (Rambod Javan) who frequently visits the terminally ill patients. Ali comes to realize that Maleki is actually the spirit of death, who is there to guide the hopelessly ill to their place in the next world. Ali turns to Maleki and asks him if he could do something special and allow him to be reunited with his mother. Ja'beye Musighi (aka Music Box) was an official selection at the 2008 Fajr Film Festival, where it won a special prize for spiritually themed pictures."
