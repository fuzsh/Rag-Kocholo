His route was later called the maritime Silk Road and many merchants took that route to ship their merchandise to China.\n\nEzzatollah Entezami, Reza Kianian, Bahram Radan and Dariush Arjmand are among cast members of the play.\n\nRambod Javan’s comedy “Women Only” ranks third in the poll.\n\nIt narrates the story of a nonprofit school for girls whose manager is a 30-year woman that does not have any male teachers in the school. In a particular situation, she is obliged to let a male teacher to work in the school.\n\nAccording to ISNA, the film was warmly welcomed by audiences at the Milad Tower where journalists and critics watched the movie.\n\nIn an interview with Tehran-e Emrooz daily, Javan expressed his hope of winning an award at the festival for “Women Only”.\n\n“The Maritime Silk Road” was shown at the Asian Cinema Competition section. “Nader and Simin: A Separation” and “Women Only” were reviewed during the Iranian Competition section of the festival.\n\nThe Fajr International Film Festival is currently underway in Tehran’s movie theaters and will run until February 15."
