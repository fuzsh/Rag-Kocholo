        "text": "QUICK FACTS\n\nIntroIranian film director and screenwriterCountriesIranOccupationsFilm director Film producer ScreenwriterTypeFilm, Television, Stage and RadioGenderFemaleBirth3 April 1954 (Tehran, Central District, Tehran County, Tehran Province)Family\n\nChildren:Baran Kosari\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nRakhshān Bani-Etemad (Persian: رخشان بنی‌اعتماد‎‎, born April 3, 1954 in Tehran, Iran) is an internationally and critically acclaimed Iranian film director and screenwriter. She is widely considered as premier female director, and her films have been praised at international festivals as well as being remarkably popular with Iranian critics and audiences. Her title as “First Lady of Iranian Cinema” is not only a reference to her prominence as a filmmaker, but it also connotes her social role of merging politics and family in her work.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nRakhshan Bani-Etemad was born into a middle-class family. While her parents wanted her to pursue a career in teaching, Bani-Etemad demonstrated an interest in film from a young age. As a teenager, she had decided to study film. She received her Bachelor of Arts degree in film studies from the Dramatic Arts University in Tehran.\n\nCareer\n\nShortly after completing her degree, Bani-Etemad began working for the Iranian television network IRIB (Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting), where she began directing television documentary features. Her features are steeped in the social and economic problems of Iran.\n\nBani-Etemad did not receive immediate praise upon entering the film industry. Her early feature films were met by harsh criticism. However, she finally earned critical and popular success in 1991 with her film Nargess. She received the Best Director Award from the Fajr Film Festival, marking the first time in the history of the festival that a woman was awarded the Best Director prize. Since then, she has received numerous awards for her films, including a Bronze Leopard Award for her film The Blue-Veiled at the 1995 Locarno Film Festival.\n\nSince she began making films in 1978, she has come to exemplify her own unique style. Bani-Etemad’s films are considered socially and politically conscious social documentaries. She aims to reflect the realities of Iranian people’s daily life experiences. Her documentaries are centered on issues of poverty, criminality, divorce, polygamy, social norms, cultural taboos, women’s oppression, and cultural expectations.\n\nHer 2001 film Under the Skin of the City was entered into the 23rd Moscow International Film Festival where it won the Special Golden St.George. The following year she was a member of the jury at the 24th Moscow International Film Festival.\n\nWith her 2002 film Our Times, Bani-Etemad became the first female filmmaker to explicitly confront the Iran-Iraq war, placing her in an important role in Iranian film history. She has been known to challenge censorship codes to the very edge.\n\nBani-Etemad has reflected an interest and an attraction to strong female characters dealing with social issues. In her more recent films, she features female characters from lower classes and incomes who are struggling to make a living. Bani-E'temad highlights the strength and resilience of Iranian women as the hope for the future of the country. According to the filmmaker, despite the legal and cultural barriers and the economic hardships for lower income women, their strong nature is the admirable quality about women in Iran. In addition, her films focus on the complex relationships between mothers and their children. This stems from her own experience as a mother in Iran, but also from the Iranian woman's inability to tackle her life without considering her maternal role—a reality that is deeply engrained in Iranian patriarchal structure.\n\nDespite the predominance of strong female protagonists in her work, Bani-Etemad is not to be confused with feminist filmmaking. In fact, Bani-Etemad has explicitly rejected the label often applied to her by Western film festivals as a “feminist filmmaker.” She is more concerned in the universal struggle of society’s lower rungs, regardless of gender. In addition, she does not associate with the label due to the implications of the word “feminist,” which in Iran has a more negative connotation than in America. According to Bani-E'temad, as long as the understanding of the term remains in Iran, she will disassociate with the label.\n\nUnlike most other Iranian filmmakers who share a common style, such as using long takes and non-professional actors, Bani-Etemad has her own distinct style. Her approach to the subject matter of her films is more emotional and theatrical. She has admit to letting the subject matter and theme of her films determine the structure, technique, and casting.\n\nBani-Etemad is recognized for combining the tropes of fiction and documentary film into her unique style. It is hard for the filmmaker to separate the two, and she finds that documentary elements often come into play as she is doing the research and shooting of her films. Her unique style emerged from her passion for representing the reality of Iranian society as accurately as possible. In order to achieve authenticity and reflect reality, Bani-E'temad personally spends time living in the conditions of people she is reflecting in her own characters. She relies on experience rather than research to provide a realistic portrayal. With her knowledge of the contemporary social issues she tackles, the filmmaker lives with families similar to her own characters prior to production in order to understand their conditions. For her 2005 film Gilaneh, Bani-E'temad spent a year and a half living in the village of Espili, observing the day-to-day lives of a war-torn population still suffering the repercussions of war, fifteen years after the Iran-Iraq war. In the process of dramatizing reality, she applies documentary conventions to reflect reality intimately.\n\nIn conjunction with her documentary approach to fictional film, Bani-Etemad’s signature style consists of films that deal with social issues specific to Iran yet still maintain broad international appeal. She is recognized for reflecting the struggles of Iran’s lower classes, the plight of single women and single mothers in Iran, and complicated family relationships. She often examines the duality of human nature in familial and work spaces. To accommodate documentary conventions, her characters directly address the camera.\n\nHer upcoming film Tales has been selected to compete for the Golden Lion at the 71st Venice International Film Festival.\n\nLegacy\n\nWith a collection of films that combine absolute honesty with extraordinary subtlety, Bani-Etemad offers an analysis of the current cultural pressures shaping Iranian women's lives. She is widely recognized among Iranian audiences and critics as one of Iran's most prominent filmmakers, and has also enjoyed international popularity. She was awarded an Honorary Degree from SOAS in 2008.\n\nPersonal life\n\nShe is the wife of Iranian film producer Jahangir Kosari. Her daughter is Iranian actress Baran Kosari, who has worked with her mother throughout most of her films. Baran began acting from a young age, and she is now a professional actress. She has appeared in her mother's films, as well as the films of other Iranian filmmakers.\n\nHumanitarian Actions\n\nShe has donated her international prize for the movie Ghesseh-ha to build a shelter for homeless women. Previously she has also donated some of her awards to help disadvantaged women.\n\nFilmography (as a director)\n\nKharej az Mahdudeh (1986 - a.k.a. Off-Limits)\n\nZard-e Ghanari (1988 - a.k.a.

The Malek family originated from Jilu and eventually settled in the Assyrian Christian village of Geogtapa, in the Urmia region of northwestern Iran. Geogtapa was the largest Assyrian Christian village in the region and much of it belonged to the Malek-Yonan family with the oldest plot in the family graveyard dating back to 1100.\n\nMalek-Yonan's father, George Malek-Yonan (1924-2014), an international attorney in Iran, was personally responsible for negotiating and procuring a seat for the Assyrians as a recognized Christian minority in the Iranian Parliament, a huge accomplishment for a people who had been without a formal country since the fall of the Assyria.\n\nMalek-Yonan's mother, Lida Malek-Yonan (1928–2002) regarded as an activist and humanitarian, was equally influential in demanding recognition for Assyrian women in Iran by launching and presiding over the Assyrian Women's Organization which was the only officially recognized charter member of the Iranian Women's Association until the end of the Pahlavi dynasty.\n\nDuring the Assyrian genocide of 1914–1918, Malek-Yonan's grandparents left their ancestral homeland in Urmia, as part of the \"Great Exodus\" from Urmia in March 1918. The Malek-Yonan family fled to Mesopotamia where her father was born in Baghdad, while Malek-Yonan's maternal grandmother fled to Russia where her mother was born in Rostov. Years later, both families returned to Tehran where her parents met and were married.\n\nCareer\n\nMalek-Yonan is a classically trained pianist, composer, actress, director, writer, documentary filmmaker and activist. She began studying piano at the age of four and while still in her teens, competed in and won many national piano competitions in Iran and attended the Tehran Conservatory of Music. In 1972 after winning a national piano competition in Iran, she was invited by Queen Farah Pahlavi to play at a Command Performance.\n\nUpon receiving her L.C. degree in English from the University of Cambridge, she studied classical piano with Saul Joseph at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, and acting with Ray Reinhardt at the American Conservatory Theatre. A graduate of San Francisco State University with two degrees in Music, she won an invitation to study drama at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and the historic Pasadena Playhouse. Her plays have been produced and performed on stage. In 2008 Malek-Yonan’s one woman play, An Assyrian Exodus previewed in Hartford, Connecticut. The work is based on true family diaries written during the 1918 Great Exodus from Urmia, Iran. About the production, Janey Golani, of The Assyrian Starwrites, \"…presentations included those of Ms. Rosie Malek-Yonan which was filled with many emotional attendees who were struck by her performance of \"An Assyrian Exodus\" a dramatic staged reading based on Rosie's Family Diaries.\"\n\nReviewing Malek-Yonan's work as an actor and director, Martin Hernandez of LA Weekly writes, \"Superbly acted and directed...Director Rosie Malek-Yonan honed the works to perfection, even down to the fitting choice of songs for transitions and intermission.\" About her stage directing, Bruce Feld writes, \"Rosie Malek-Yonan has done an excellent job directing...top-of-the-line and what might have become a sketch in other hands becomes a poignant episode of universal import...exceptional direction.\". In another review, Feld wrote, \"Very well directed by Rosie Malek-Yonan...The material is very tricky, but Malek-Yonan handles it with requisite sensitivity, without in any way watering down the heavy conflict...Sparks ignite...\"\n\nMalek-Yonan made her television debut in 1983 on Aaron Spelling's television series, Dynasty, followed by a national commercial for AT&T where she spoke in Assyrian. She has since appeared in numerous notable television shows, films and plays, acting in a wide range of roles opposite many of Hollywood's leading actors. She has had recurring roles on Days of Our Lives, Chicago Hope, Beverly Hills, 90210, The Young and the Restless and in 2008 she joined the cast of ABC's General Hospital as Farah Mir. On Star Trek: Deep Space Nine she was Tekoa. She has guest starred on such shows as Generations, Seinfeld, Life and JAG. She played the role of Nuru Il-Ebrahimi, opposite Reese Witherspoon in New Line Cinema's Rendition, directed by Oscar-winning director Gavin Hood. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nIn 2015 Malek-Yonan joined the executive board of the Beverly Hills Film Festival as a consultant.\n\nHuman rights activism\n\nMalek-Yonan is an outspoken advocate of issues concerning her nation, in particular bringing attention to the Assyrian Genocide as well as the plight of today's Assyrians in the Middle-East since the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States and its Coalition Forces. She has candidly criticized the U.S. for failure to protect the Christians in Iraq since the beginning of the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. In an interview with The New York Times Malek-Yonan said, \"Anytime the Western countries go to war in the Middle East, it becomes a religious war…\" In the interview she also held Kurdish commanders in Iraq responsible for \"depriving the Christians of security in an effort to tilt the demographics in favor of Kurds. The expected result, she said, was an exodus of hundreds of thousands of Christians from Iraq. At least hundreds have been killed. One priest was quartered and beheaded.\"\n\nOn June 30, 2006, Rosie Malek-Yonan, was invited to testify on Capitol Hill before a Congressional Committee of the 109th Congress on religious freedom regarding the genocide, massacres and persecution of Assyrians in Iraq since the beginning of the 2003 Iraq War. Reading from her book, she compared the Assyrian Genocide of 1914-1918, as depicted in The Crimson Field, to the current plight of the indigenous Assyrian Christians in Iraq. Her 30-minute testimony and plea to the U.S. government, ultimately prompted Congressman Chris Smith (R-NJ) to travel to war-torn Iraq to witness matters for himself. While in Iraq, after meeting with local Assyrians, he turned in Malek-Yonan's in depth report to U.S. Officials in Iraq. One year later, a Congressional appropriations subcommittee voted to send $10 million to aid the Assyrians in Iraq. The complete archived transcript and webcast of the actual Congressional Testimony is available at the website of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nMonica Malek-Yonan's documentary film, My Assyrian Nation on the Edge, based on Rosie Malek-Yonan's Congressional Testimony was released September 2006 (ISBN 0-9771873-0-6) in English. The film is released in Europe with French, German, Swedish and Dutch subtitles (ISBN 978-0-9771873-31). The Australian Premiere was on 7 August 2008, at the Australian Parliament of New South Wales in Sydney.\n\nIn 2008, Malek-Yonan addressed the topics of genocide, world peace and in particular the Assyrian Genocide in statements presented at the British House of Lords on 12 March and on 24 April at the House of Commons of the United Kingdom.\n\nOn October 5, 2008, Malek-Yonan spoke on behalf of the Assyrian nation in Iraq at a Los Angeles rally held in front of the Federal Building to oppose the Iraq Election Law. She addressed the crowd of demonstrators and the media voicing her opposition at the removal of article 50 and its consequences for the minorities in Iraq in particular the Assyrians. \"Democracy in Iraq will fail if it does not treat all members of its society equally under the law.\" She went on to say, \"Assyrians have already paid a heavy price since the beginning of the Iraq War. The liberation of Iraqis must encompass all its citizens, including the Assyrians, and not just the Sunni, the Shi'ites and the Kurds.\n\nMalek-Yonan is frequently interviewed on television and radio programs worldwide giving her assessment of the current situation of the Assyrians in the Middle-East as well as discussing the topic of the hotly debated Assyrian Genocide.\n\nMalek-Yonan’s articles are published globally and translated into many languages. She is a public speaker and is often invited to lecture about the Assyrian Genocide. On 24 February 2007, Malek-Yonan was a keynote speaker at an open forum in Anaheim, California, discussing the persecution of the Copts and the plight of Christians in the Middle East. She has lectured at University of California, Berkeley, University of California, Merced, and Woodbury University among others.\n\nOn December 20, 2010, Malek-Yonan, was invited by the Simon Wiesenthal Center Museum of Tolerance to speak at a press conference to address the escalating crisis and the deadly attacks on the Assyrians in Iraq.
