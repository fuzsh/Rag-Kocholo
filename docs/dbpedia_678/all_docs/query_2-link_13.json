        "text": "The power of the moving image to connect people otherwise distanced by cultural, political and national divides has been embodied nowhere more profoundly over the last several decades than in the humanism, artistry and courage of Iranian filmmakers. UCLA Film & Television Archive has been presenting the best of their work in this annual survey for almost thirty years and it does so again this year with a renewed sense of purpose.\n\nOur current series includes films from new voices, current masters and a special tribute to one of contemporary cinema’s most influential and important artists, Abbas Kiarostami. Each, in their own way, reflects the complex realities of contemporary Iran and the Iranian diaspora, while their storytelling resonates beyond specific contexts to universal experiences that unite us all as viewers and human beings.\n\nThere has always been a vital need for such a cinema, and the Archive will always be a home for it and the artists who create it. It is anticipated that some filmmakers will appear in person, wherever possible, to discuss their work. Please check the UCLA Film and Television Archive website for updates on in-person guests, and to purchase tickets.\n\nSaturday, April, 28 – 7:30 pm\n\nNo Date, No Signature (Bedoune Tarikh, Bedoune Emza) (Iran, 2017)\n\nLos Angeles Premiere!\n\nA late night car accident involving a respected forensic doctor (Amir Agha’ee) and a working class family—that may have lead to the death of family’s youngest son—triggers a series of deceptions and revelations that come to consume everyone involved with questions of guilt and responsibility. Vahid Jalilvand (Wednesday, May 9) was named Best Director at the 2017 Fajr Film Festival for this tightly wound drama and Navid Mohammadzadeh won Best Supporting Actor for his gripping portrayal of the boy’s father.\n\nProduction: Noori Pictures\n\nDistribution: Distrib Films US\n\nDirector: Vahid Jalilvand\n\nScreenwriter: Ali Zarnegar, Vahid Jalilvand\n\nCinematographer: Peyman Shadmanfar\n\nEditor: Vahid Jalilvand, Sepehr Vakili\n\nMusic: Peyman Yazdanian\n\nCast: Navid Mohammadzadeh, Amir Agha’ee, Hediyeh Tehrani, Zakiyeh Behbahani, Sa’eed Dakh\n\nDCP, color, in Persian with English subtitles, 104 min.\n\nBuy Tickets\n\nSunday, April, 29 – 7:00 pm\n\nIsrafil (Iran, 2017)\n\nLos Angeles Premiere!\n\nDirector Ida Panahandeh (Nahid) brings a sensitive eye to the dynamics of a couple caught up in the throes of love and regret. Still in mourning after the death of her son, the widowed Mahi (Hedieh Tehrani) learns that her first love—who left town when their relationship sparked a scandal—has returned. Haunted by the past but longing for a new future, Mahi and Behrooz (Pejman Bazeghi) are drawn together again at the risk reopening old wounds.\n\nDistribution: Dreamlab Films\n\nProducer: Mastaneh Mohajer\n\nDirector: Ida Panahandeh\n\nScreenwriter: Arsalan Amiri, Ida Panahandeh\n\nCinematographer: Morteza Gheidi\n\nEditor: Hayedeh Safiyari\n\nMusic: Majid Pousti\n\nCast: Hedieh Tehrani, Pejman Bazeghi, Hoda Zeinolabedin, Merila Zarei, Pouria Rahimi Sam\n\nDCP, color, in Persian with English subtitles, 100 min.\n\nBuy Tickets\n\nFriday, May, 4 – 7:30 pm\n\nThe Home (Ev) (Iran, 2017)\n\nU.S. Premiere!\n\nWriter-director Asghar Yousefinejad knocks us off emotional balance right from the start of his debut feature with a grieving daughter’s explosive protests over the fate of her father’s corpse. Yousefinejad ratchets things up from there, confining the action to follow to the dead man’s home, where a parade of suddenly interested parties intervene, and what begins as a family drama, reveals itself as a sharp satire in which everyone’s motives become suspect. Winner of best film and best screenplay in the international competition at the Fajr Film Festival.\n\nDistribution: Iranian Independents\n\nDirector/Screenwriter: Asghar Yousefinejad\n\nCinematographer: Hamid Mehrafrouz\n\nEditor: Amir Etminan\n\nCast: Ramin Riazi, Mohadeseh Heyrat, Gholamreza Bagheri, Sedigheh Daryani\n\nDCP, color, in Azari with English subtitles, 78 min.\n\nBuy Tickets\n\nSaturday, May, 5 – 7:30 pm\n\nBOARDING PASS (Kart-e parvaz) (2018)\n\nWest Coast Premiere!\n\nIn-Person: Mehdi Rahmani\n\nLocked in a custody battle with her ex-husband over their young son and desperate for cash, Neda turns to smuggling heroin over the border as a way out. When a veteran drug mule, Mansour, sees Neda, pale and shaky, at the airport, he knows something has gone terribly wrong with her and reluctantly agrees to get her medical help. Thus begins a gripping race against time through Tehran’s criminal underground where everything has its price.\n\nDirector: Mehdi Rahmani\n\nProducer: Mehdi Rahmani, Bahman Kamyar\n\nScreenplay: Mir Arabi, Mehdi Rahmani, Babak Mirzakhani\n\nCinematography: Mohammad Rasouli\n\nEditor: Mohammadreza Muini\n\nMusic: Babak Mirzakhani\n\nCast: Mansour Shahbazi, Neda Jebraili, Mohammad-ali Najafi, Asghar Rafie Jam, Shirin Yazdanbakhsh.\n\nDCP, color, 88 min.\n\nSimulation (Tamaroz) (Iran, 2017)\n\nLos Angeles Premiere!\n\nWith a nod to Lars Von Trier’s Dogville (2003) and riding an emerging wave of formal experimentation among young Iranian filmmakers, actor-director Abed Abest, star of Shahram Mokri’s Fish & Cat (2013), plays compellingly with time and space in telling the story of a boys’ night out gone tragically wrong. Told in reverse chronological order and set entirely on a darkened soundstage with locations and props marked out in green screen material, Simulation delivers on its title to challenge our notions of truth and reality.\n\nDistribution: Iranian Independents\n\nDirector/Screenwriter: Abed Abest\n\nCinematographer: Hamid Khozouie Abyaneh\n\nEditor: Haydeh Safiyari\n\nMusic: Bamdad Afshar\n\nCast: Abed Abest, Shahrzad Seifi, Vahid Rad, Majid Yousefi\n\nDCP, color, in Persian with English subtitles, 85 min.\n\nBuy Tickets\n\nSunday, May, 6 – 7:00 pm\n\nGolden Time (Noghte Talaii) (Iran, 2017)\n\nA panoptic view of a society on the edge, Golden Time unfolds as a dozen vignettes of people who find themselves suddenly faced with stark turning points in their lives, by fate or the imposition of others. Each story is shot a single take, in a vehicle, at dusk with writer-director Pourya Kakavand exploring a wide array of scenarios and emotions—blackmail, betrayal, violence and other unsavory scenarios come into play—all set against the transitive glow of twilight.\n\nProducer: Hassan Fathi\n\nDirector: Pourya Kakavand\n\nScreenwriter: Pourya Kakavand\n\nCinematographer: Alireza Hodaie\n\nEditor: Pourya Kakavand\n\nMusic: Nima Ghahremani\n\nCast: Amirhosein Fathi, Houshang Golmakani, Arash Falahatpishe, Faeze Alavi, Faraz Sarabi\n\nDCP, color, in Persian with English subtitles, 115 min.\n\nBuy Tickets\n\nFriday, May, 11 – 7:30 pm\n\nBlockage (Sad-e mabar) (Iran, 2017)\n\nIn Person: Hamed Behdad\n\nA Tehran city official charged with policing illegal street vendors, Ghasem (Hamed Behdad) shakes them down for bribes instead. Fearing he’ll soon be fired for corruption, Ghasem desperately scrambles to set up another scam using his wife’s inheritance.

After an incident at the job where he works illegally, Valderrama skips town to Tehran where he falls into an underground economy of illegal street vendors, squatters and drug dealers. Director Abbas Amini plunges us into this fraught world and the plight of other kids like Valderrama without ever resorting to easy sympathy or answers.\n\nProducer: Majid Barzegar\n\nDirector: Abbas Amini\n\nScreenplay: Abbas Amini, Hossein Farokhzadeh\n\nCinematography: Ashkan Ashkani\n\nEditor: Majid Barzegar, Hamidreza Barzegar\n\nMusic: Mehran Ghaedipour\n\nCast: Hamed Alipour, Nafiseh Zare, Gity Ghasemi, Assadolah Monjazi\n\nDCP, color, in Persian with English subtitles, 91 min.\n\nBuy Tickets\n\nSaturday, May, 12 – 3:00 pm\n\nA Man of Integrity (Iran, 2017)\n\nReza (Reza Akhlaghirad), a goldfish farmer, and his wife, Hadis (Soudabeh Beizaee), a teacher, struggle to get by, in part because of Reza’s principled refusal to participate in the local culture of kickbacks and bribes. An outsider who relocated his family from Tehran, Reza becomes enmeshed in a violent battle of wills with thuggish officials in the pocket of an unnamed company. Winner of the Un Certain Regard prize at Cannes, writer-director Mohammad Rasoulof’s blistering depiction of corruption and injustice resonates well beyond the rural, small-town setting where its story unfolds.\n\nProducer: Mohammad Rasoulof\n\nDirector: Mohammad Rasoulof\n\nScreenwriter: Mohammad Rasoulof\n\nCinematographer: Ashkan Ashkani\n\nEditor: Mohammadreza Muini, Meysam Muini\n\nMusic: Peyman Yazdanian\n\nCast: Reza Akhlaghirad, Soudabeh Beizaee, Nasim Adabi, Misagh Zare, Zeinab Shabani\n\nDCP, color, in Persian with English subtitles, 117 min.\n\nBuy Tickets\n\nSaturday, May, 12 – 7:30 pm\n\n24 Frames (Iran, 2017)\n\nDirector Abbas Kiarostami’s final film, completed after his death under the supervision of his son Ahmad, is structured as a series of two dozen, beautifully composed, black-and-white still images—the frames of the title—that Kiarostami brings to animated life. Wintry scenes predominate with animals—birds, cows, sheep, a cat—the only living presence found throughout. Captivating and curious, it invites meditation, on the nature of the moving image, the transformative power of art, and the legacy of a life spent deeply, movingly engaged with both.\n\nDirector: Abbas Kiarostami\n\nDCP, color, in Persian with English subtitles, 114 min.\n\nBuy Tickets\n\nSunday, May 13 – 7:00 pm\n\n24 Frames (Iran, 2017)\n\nIn-person: Ahmad Kiarostami\n\nDirector Abbas Kiarostami’s final film, completed after his death under the supervision of his son Ahmad, is structured as a series of two dozen, beautifully composed, black-and-white still images—the frames of the title—that Kiarostami brings to animated life.

What follows is a powerful, moving story of difference and acceptance in a country largely perceived as ethnically, linguistically and culturally monolithic. Beyzaie’s sensitivity to the plight of the displaced and the trauma of war makes this timeless work as relevant now as ever.\n\nProducer: Ali Reza Zarrin\n\nDirector: Bahram Beyzaie\n\nScreenwriter: Bahram Beyzaie\n\nCinematographer: Firooz Malekzadeh\n\nEditor: Bahram Beizai\n\nProduction Design: Bahram Beizai, Iraj Raminfar\n\nCast: Susan Taslimi, Parviz Poorhosseini, Adnan Afravian\n\nHDCam, color, in Persian with English subtitles, 120 min."
