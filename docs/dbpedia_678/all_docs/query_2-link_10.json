        "text": "All Films\n\nNo Entry for Men (Vorood Aghayan Mamnoo)\n\nSpecial Screening - Doha Tribecca Film Festival 2012\n\nللترجمة العربية اضغط على\n\nSynopsis\n\nThe battle of the sexes has seen no greater playing field than one of the strictest all-girls’ schools in Tehran, where formidable headmistress Mrs Darabi rules with an iron fist. Her number one, non-negotiable regulation: no man must ever cross the threshold of her institution of academic excellence. However, when a teacher must take leave just as the school’s star science students are preparing for the international Chemistry Olympiad, Mrs Darabi’s only option is to hire a dedicated, if bumbling, male teacher. Once her golden rule is broken, Mrs Darabi’s dislike of men reaches a fever pitch, with results that will have audiences rolling in the aisles – and cheering for good old-fashioned romance. ‘No Entry for Men’ was wildly successful at the box-office in its native Iran and for good reason – this charming, gentle romantic comedy will appeal to young and old alike.\n\nAbout the Director\n\nBorn in Tehran in 1971, Rambod Javan is an actor and stage director who is a familiar figure on television in Iran. He has appeared in numerous popular Iranian movies and has directed three series for Iranian television. ‘Spaghetti in 8 Mins’ was his directorial debut for the cinema.\n\nCredits\n\nDirector\n\nRambod Javan\n\nScreenwriter\n\nPeyman Ghasemkhani\n\nProducer\n\nAli Sartipi, Manijeh Hekmat\n\nEditor\n\nMostafa Kherghehpoosh\n\nMusic\n\nHeydar Sajedi\n\nCinematographer\n\nDavood Amiri\n\nSales Company\n\nIranian Independents\n\nCast\n\nReza Attaran, Vishka Asayesh, Mani Haghighi, Pegah Ahangarani, Falamak Joneidi, Bahareh Rahnam\n\nContacts"
