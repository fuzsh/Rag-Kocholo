The story is about Mahi, a widow mourning the death of her only son. One day she bumps into Behrooz, who she had a crush on many years ago but now he is in love with another woman.\n\nAccording to the festival website, it is a “sensitive Iranian drama of thwarted romance and familial responsibility. Ida Panahandeh’s highly-anticipated second feature is a meticulously constructed reflection on lost love, loneliness and life choices, viewed through the prism of three intersecting lives. Panahandeh sensitively articulates the reasons why their young love was not allowed to flourish and brings into focus its long-term repercussions”.\n\nThe cast includes Merila Zarei, Hediyeh Tehrani, Pejman Bazeghi, Soheyla Razavi, Hoda Zeinolabedin and Ali Omrani among others. Its international sale is by DreamLab Films.\n\nLocal Releases\n\n‘Conditional Release’ and ‘Negar’ will be released locally in autumn.\n\nGharaee’s film is a social drama about Kamali, a middle age man who has been sentenced to 20 years in prison.

Now avoidance of any sort of punishable act, strife and affray is the biggest challenge in front of him.\n\nThe cast includes Amir Jafari, Shaqayeq Farahani, Leila Otadi, Amir Reza Delavari, Diba Zahedi and Ahmad Nikpour among others.\n\nReality vs. Fantasy\n\n‘Negar’ premiered in the 35th Fajr Film Festival and was nominated in eight categories but sufficed with one award.\n\nThe movie is centered on a young girl named Negar whose father is dead. The police have ruled it a suicide. He went bankrupt before committing suicide and lost everything, including his house. The new owner evicts Negar and her mother from their home. One night, Negar has a dream about her father in which he gives her clues about his real fate. Waking up, Negar is set to find the truth.\n\nIt is Javan’s fourth film in which he has experienced a new genre both in his resume and Iran cinema as well. He is best known as a comedy actor and host and his first three films as a director are all comedies; however, ‘Negar’ is a mix of drama, thriller and fantasy.\n\nNegar Javaherian (Javan’s wife), Mohammad Reza Foroutan, Mani Haqiqi, Ashkan Khatibi, Alireza Aqakhani, Afsaneh Baygan, Atila Pesyani and Alireza Shoja Nouri are in the cast."
