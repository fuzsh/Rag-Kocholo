Dedicating her life to her family, Manana has wanted to write a novel throughout her life but had to suppress her dream. When she finally decides to follow her passion, she is willing to risk everything, both spiritually and physically.\n\n\"It is a movie about restrictions; on moral codes we learn and patters causing suppression,\" Georgian director Ana Urushadze said about her first feature-length movie, which has been awarded at many festivals, including Best Movie at the Sarajevo Film Festival, Young Jury, the First Feature-Length Award at Locarno, Best Female Actress at the Asia Pacific Screen Awards and Best Cinematography at Gijon in 2017.

On her path to the top, ambitious, brave and witty Emmanuelle has to deal with the boys' club at work and her constantly complaining husband at home. Will the power of men who are willing to try whatever it takes to stop this hardworking ambitious woman and who are not afraid to turn into monsters be able to stop her? \"Number One,\" which premiered at Toronto Film Festival, is a corporate drama with an intricate plot touching on gender equality and hits the mark with actress Emmanuelle Davos in the lead role.\n\nThe Sounding\n\nSweeping the awards at the Brooklyn, Palm Beach and Arizona Film Festivals \"The Sounding\" focuses on Liv, who lives on a remote island off the coast of Maine and who after years of silence, starts talking in Shakespearian English. The neurologist brought to the island hospitalizes her to find a cure. However, instead of getting better, Liv turns into a rebel with a tendency for violence, taking the risk of remaining locked up for years. Director Catherine Eaton, who also stars in the movie, tells the story of otherness, which also references political clients. Written by Eaton and Irish playwright Bryan Delaney, \"The Sounding\" is an intriguing film at this year's festival.\n\nOf Skin and Men\n\nA woman who shakes the conservative yet Western social structure of Tunisia to the core, Amal is shocked by the sudden death of her husband who had a bright future as a photographer. Life takes her to places as a widow that she never dreamed or thought about. Yet, as an artist, she drives everyone mad with her daring and boldness and starts taking erotic photographs of men. Mocking concepts such as manhood, loyalty and vulgarity, \"Of Skin and Men,\" is an aesthetic movie with a female perspective. Tunisian-French actress Hafsia Herzi shines in her role as Amal in the film directed by Mehdi Ben Attia.\n\nMadeline's Madeline\n\n\"The emotions you are having are not your own, they are someone else's. You are not the cat - you are inside the cat.\"\n\nHow do we distinguish between mental illness and teenage tantrums, how do we separate the role from reality and where do we draw the lines of creativity? A teenager tries to continue her life with an illness that has captured her body and her mind, who is drowned by the love of her mother and who takes on a completely different character on the theater stage. Is she really Madeline when she is Madeline? Premiering at Sundance and starring Miranda July as the mother, \"Madeline's Madeline,\" which includes an extraordinary performance by Helena Howards as Madeline, is Josephine Decker's third feature-length film and one of the must-see movies at this year's festival.\n\nAva\n\nChildren play on a beach dotted with parasols amid the sound of the water, the blue sky and the sun's rays.

When she is thrown out of her apartment due to inadequate and biased laws, she has to abide by the laws of the streets and tries to look after her child while trying to preserve her honor against racism and biases, but she gets sucked into the dirt with every step. Argentinian director Anahi Berneri does not apply any moral or social filters and draws a realistic, clear and extraordinary portrait of social collapse in her country devoid of feelings. Sofia Gala Castiglione's acting is also very realistic and her interaction with her real son throughout the movie is exquisite. \"Alanis\" won the Best Movie Award at the Havana Film Festival and Best Director and Best Actress Awards at the San Sebastian Film Festival.\n\nBikini Moon\n\nMilcho Manchevski created a masterpiece with \"Before the Rain\" in 1994, and his latest movie that jumps from documentary to fiction and from fiction to documentary, \"Bikini Moon,\" follows a documentary team trying to turn a mentally-ill veterinarian into the subject of their documentary.
