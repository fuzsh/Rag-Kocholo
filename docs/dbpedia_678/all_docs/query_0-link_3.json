        "text": "Shahab Hosseini was born on February 3, 1974 in Tehran, Iran. He grew up in a family of six and was the oldest child. He earned his high school diploma in Biology. Once a psychology student at the University of Tehran, he dropped out with the intent of emigrating to Canada. Instead, he ended up as a radio host in Iran. This was followed by hosting \"Oxygen,\" a TV show for the youth audience, and some small acting roles in a few TV series of which \"After Rain\" (Pas Az Baran) was the first. His debut in cinema was in Rokhsareh (2002), performing alongside Mitra Hajjar. His acting career took off with his performance in movies such as Tahmineh Milani's Die fünfte Reaktion (2003) (Vakonesh-e-Panjom) and Superstar (2009). He won the Crystal Simorgh from Tehran's 27th Fajr International Film Festival for his performance as Kourosh in \"Superstar\". Two years later, he received the Diploma of Honor from Fajr Film Festival and the Silver Bear Award from the prestigious Berlin International Film Festival for his memorable role as the hot-tempered Hodjat in Asghar Farhadi's internationally critically acclaimed film, Nader und Simin - eine Trennung (2011). He has also received several nominations and awards from Iran's House of Cinema including Best Actor in a Lead Role for his performance in Asghar Fardadi's previous film, Alles über Elly (2009).\n\nNavid Mohammadzadeh is an Iranian actor. He has received various accolades, including two Crystal Simorghs, four Hafez Awards, three Iran Cinema Celebration Awards and four Iran's Film Critics and Writers Association Awards. In 2017, he won the Orizzonti Award for Best Actor at the 74th Venice International Film Festival for his performance in No Date, No Signature (2017). His performance in the movie I'm Not Angry (2012) was praised by critics, and for it, he was nominated for the Crystal Simorgh for Best Actor from the Fajr Film Festival. He has also won the Crystal Simorgh for the best supporting actor of the Fajr Film Festival twice in a row for his roles in Abed and Yak Roz and Without Date, Without Signature. His first experience was in a show was the Frog series. He is of Persian and Kurdish origin. He has an associate degree in civil engineering. On July 19, 2021, he officially announced his marriage to Fereshteh Hosseini via a post on his official Instagram account.\n\nShe is an Iranian actress and one of the most talented, rapidly fame growing celebrities among new generation stars of Iranian Cinema. Her fame is mainly due to her indispensable performance, outstanding face-acting and exceptional enunciation.\n\nBorn in 1985 Iran, Babol (Mazandaran province) upon being accepted in the university, course of Graphic Arts, she moved to Tehran. While studying university, she was offered an audition which led to her first appearance in a movie named \"A Man and a City\" (2007). This movie was not successful in both box office (indeed it did not get general presentation) and critic reviews.\n\nShe made her breakthrough by appearing in TV series \"Five Kilometres to Paradise\" (2011) and TV series Zamaneh (2012) alongside with some successful Telefilms such as \"The Pool\" (Estakhr, 2014). Then she starred in the home video network series \"Shahrzad\" (2015-16) in which she played a leading role and got her triumph.\n\nThe series succeeded by her appearance in first film director Saeed Roustayi's movie \"Life plus one day\" (2015) in which she played the main character then nominated and won the Crystal Simorgh for the best actress in the 34th International Fajr Film Festival.\n\nShe is also involved and interested in charity work and Animal rights. In 2013 she participated in a reading plays, giving away all the acquired money to Mahak, which is an organization that supports cancerous children. She also contributes to animal shelters from time to time.\n\nMehran Modiri is considered to be the leading artist in social satire in Iran. His various series which have been broadcast through IRIB have set records in terms of viewership (an estimated 85% viewership when he is on air), as well as make him a popular personality among masses. In 2008 Modiri left IRIB to star and direct a home-entertainment series; a series which instead of broadcast is released on DVD on a weekly basis, entitled Ghahve-ye Talkh (Bitter Coffee). Although Ghahve-ye Talkh's delay in release put it in second place in terms of innovative media (another series, Ghalb-e Yakhi was released first, making it the first ever such program in Iran), but its sales surpassed its competitor by over double, a revelation which the industry and critics have linked directly with Modiri's popularity with his fans. In 2012, after Ghahve-ye Talkh was completed, Modiri signed on to play the lead role for his competition show, Ghalb-e Yakhi's 3rd Season. Modiri is a writer, director, actor and a recording artist. He has performed in front of sold out audiences in Tehran, including a concert benefiting UNICEF. He was named the 20th most powerful person in Iran - and the only entertainer on the list- by Newsweek magazine in 2009.\n\nModiri is an avid reader, loves classical music and is very learned in philosophy, fine arts, classic literature and biology. He is divorced and has two children.\n\nShabnam Moghaddami is an Iranian actress and narrator known for her ability to depict characters with genuine depth and authenticity, breathing life into various facets of their personalities. Her performances have garnered her prestigious awards, including the Crystal Simorgh, Hafez Awards, and Association of Iranian Film Critics and Writers awards, cementing her status as an accomplished and acclaimed actress. Some of her notable film credits include Kissing the Moon-Like Face (2012), Emrooz (2014), Nafas (2016), Zapas (2016), Abad va yek rooz (2016), Aba jan (2017), Khejalat Nakesh (2018), andShabi Ke Mah Kamel Shod (2019).\n\nBorn on March 23, 1972, in Tehran, Moghaddami came from a family with a background in culture, art, and literature. Her early passion for acting led her to enroll in acting classes and some scattered experience in radio during high school. Despite pursuing a degree in Persian literature, her love for the craft persisted, and she eventually attended a screenwriting school of The Artistic Sect of the Islamic Republic and took courses at Amin Tarokh Acting School.\n\nMoghaddami's journey in acting began in the late-1990s, primarily focusing on theater. She has portrayed both leading and supporting roles in classical and modern plays. In 2006 and 2009, she was honored with the Best Actress title at the Third and Sixth Celebrations of Iran's Theater Forum, respectively. Alongside her theater career, Moghaddami has actively participated in radio programs as a presenter and actress, further enriching her dynamic career.\n\nShabnam Moghaddami's venture into the world of cinema began with her debut in Kamran Ghadakchian's film Zakhmi (1997) in 1997. Since then, she has appeared in numerous movies and TV series, but it was in 2013 that she gained widespread fame with the film Emrooz (2014). Departing from her usual cheerful demeanor, Moghaddami portrayed a stone-faced and sharp-tongued character with a suspicious attitude. Her compelling performance as an emotional caregiver, skillfully delivering hasty accusations, earned her the Best Supporting Actress award at the 32nd Fajr Film Festival. Two years later, she triumphed with the Best Supporting Actress award for both Nafas (2016) and Zapas (2016) at the 34th Fajr Film Festival. In Zapas (2016), she embodies a painfully shy woman who is unable to interact with men and avoids direct eye contact. while in Nafas (2016), she impressively embodies an eloquent traditional woman with an Isfahani accent, subtle hints, and bursts of anger that add depth to her character. Her expressive facial reactions, including scornful looks and narrowed eyes, highlight her attentiveness and readiness to respond.\n\nIn Abad va yek rooz (2016), she skillfully portrays a widow from a lower social class, grappling with the influence of dominant men in her family while striving for a better life. Conversely, in Khejalat Nakesh (2018), she shines as a rural woman deeply mindful of societal norms and her reputation in a traditional setting. Despite the character's insensibility under the pressure of shame, Moghaddami's acting prowess and self-created accent made this character endearing.\n\nMoghaddami's versatility extends to her ability to excel in comedic roles, breaking barriers and paving the way for a new generation of actresses in the comic genre. She is not confined to leading or supporting roles, dedicating herself to exploring the depth and complexity of each character she takes on.\n\nIn the series The Monster (2019), Moghaddami portrays a woman navigating the unexpected turns of her life due to her husband's ill-gotten wealth. Her portrayal showcases a lack of self-confidence and an ambivalent self-image, expressed through excessive talking and forced laughter to cope with the changes. In films like Zahr-e Mar (2019) and Oksidan (2017), she portrays cunning and seductive female characters with charm, deception, distraction, and confusion in their pursuit of goals. Her skillful acting and subtle humor make these characters reliable to the audience.\n\nAccording to critics, Shabnam Moghaddami's acting talent knows no bounds, as she fearlessly embraces diverse characters, age ranges, accents, and social backgrounds. Her authentic performances continue to captivate audiences and solidify her position as a prolific and respected actress in the industry."
