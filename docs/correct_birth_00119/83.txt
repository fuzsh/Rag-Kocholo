Junior career[]

Stakhovsky reached career-high world rankings of No. 28 in singles and No. 32 in doubles in 2003. In 2004, he had his best junior result, losing in the final of the U.S. Open to Andy Murray, beating Donald Young in the first round. In 2002, he beat Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals of Luxembourg, before losing to Dudi Sela in the final.[5]

Professional career[]

2004[]

Stakhovsky played his first ATP-level singles match in October in Moscow's Kremlin Cup. After beating Alejandro Falla in qualifying to reach the main draw, he lost to Nikolay Davydenko in the first round. He then reached the quarterfinals of a couple Challengers to finish the year ranked No. 335 in singles.

2005[]

Stakhovsky began 2005 where he left off, qualifying into the ATP stop in Qatar in January and losing to Hyung-Taik Lee in the first round. In February, he won his first ATP-level singles match, qualifying into the main draw, where he beat #100 Christophe Rochus and #29 Mario Ančić before losing to #37 Robin Söderling in the quarterfinals. He spent most of the rest of the year having moderate success at the Challenger level, but did qualify once more into an ATP tournament in Russia in October, reaching the 2nd round. He finished the year ranked #173 in singles.

In doubles, he won two Challenger tournaments, in Spain in July and Prague in November.

2006[]

Stakhovsky had a rough start to the year, losing in the first round of qualifying at three straight ATP stops. By May, his ranking had slipped back to #260 before he began making progress again on the Challenger circuit. Semifinal results at major Challengers in Spain and Istanbul in July got his ranking back to #181.

In October, he qualified into ATP main draws two weeks in a row, losing in the first round to #26 Richard Gasquet in France and beating #21 Dmitry Tursunov in the first round in Moscow before losing to #54 Arnaud Clément. That brought his singles ranking to a career high of #158.

Although he did win his 4th career doubles Challenger title in Ukraine in November, he had no further singles success and finished the year ranked #198 in singles.

2007[]

Stakhovsky was not as successful in 2007 in singles. He qualified twice into ATP main draws in January and February, but lost in the first round. He had more success in doubles, winning two more Challenger titles to get to a career high doubles ranking of #128 in August. But by October, his singles ranking had slipped to #294 before he began making progress on the Challenger circuit again. He reached his first Challenger singles final in a major tournament in Malaysia in his final tournament of 2007 to finish the year ranked #199 in singles.

2008: First ATP title[]

Stakhovsky began 2008 by failing to qualify into several ATP and Challenger tournaments, before qualifying and reaching the quarterfinals of a major Challenger in Poland in February, losing to #68 Simone Bolelli. He then entered the qualifications of the Zagreb tournament, losing in the final round to Slovenian Blaž Kavčič, but due to Michaël Llodra's withdrawal, he entered the main draw as a lucky loser. He went on to win the tournament, defeating top players along the way, including #2 seed Ivo Karlović in the first round, #8 seed Janko Tipsarević in the quarterfinals, Simone Bolelli in the semifinals, and #1 seed Ivan Ljubičić in the final.

2009: Second ATP title[]

This year has seen Stakhovsky match it with the best in a number of ATP World Tour events. In the season opener in Doha, Stakhovsky lost in the quarter-finals to #3 seed Andy Murray. In Zagreb, as defending champion, he once again made the quarter-finals, losing to Viktor Troicki. Stakhovsky played Andy Murray once more in the first round of the Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships and after being one set up and with a break in the second, he twisted his ankle whilst trying to volley. Unable to finish the match, Stakhovsky retired hurt.

As the leading player in the Ukrainian Davis Cup team, Stakhovsky defeated Chris Eaton on the opening day of the Europe/Africa Zone Playoff versus Great Britain in Scotland and partnered Sergei Bubka Jr. in closing out the tie by winning the doubles in five sets.

Stakhovsky won his maiden Grand Slam Singles and Doubles matches at Roland Garros. Stakhovsky qualified for the main draw with impressive performances in his three qualifying matches, coming from 1–4 down in the third set versus Rik de Voest to record an 8–6 victory. Playing Brian Dabul of Argentina in the first round of the Main Draw, Stakhovsky recorded a four set victory and set up a meeting with Novak Djoković, the 4th seed. In a match lasting two days due to poor light, Stakhovsky was comprehensively defeated by the 2007 and 2008 semi-finalist in three sets. Partnering James Cerretani in the doubles, the pair won their first round match before eventually losing to the eventual champions; Lukáš Dlouhý and Leander Paes.

Stakhovsky won his second ATP title in St. Petersburg after winning epic matches against former world number 1, two time Grand Slam champion and twice former St. Petersburg Open champion, Marat Safin (who was playing his last St. Petersburg Open) and he narrowly defeated Horacio Zeballos in the final.

2010: Top 40[]

Stakhovsky continued his good form in Davis Cup play with two victories in Ukraine's tie against Latvia in the 1st round Europe/Africa Zone 1 tie.[6] He also won his third career title, beating Janko Tipsarević in the final of the UNICEF Open – a tournament Stakhovsky did not receive a seeding for. At New Haven, he won his fourth career title with highlight wins over Tommy Robredo and Marcos Baghdatis, becoming the first Ukrainian to win two titles in a season since Andrei Medvedev in 1994.

At the 2010 US Open, after knocking out Australian Peter Luczak in the first round, Stakhovsky battled into the third round with a five-set win over American qualifier Ryan Harrison, coming back from triple match point down in a fifth-set tiebreaker to win a match marked by dramatic serve-and-volleying, rallies at net, and leaping overheads from both players. In the 3rd Round, Sergiy retired in the second set trailing Feliciano López with an infected toe.

Sergiy reached a career high ranking of no. 31 on 27 September 2010.[7] He ended the 2010 season ranked no. 46 and will begin 2011 at the Qatar Open in Doha.

2013: First top-10 win over Roger Federer and Wimbledon third round[]

He got his first top-10 win when he defeated seven-time winner and defending champion Roger Federer at Wimbledon in four sets in the second round, 6–7 (5), 7–6 (5), 7–5, 7–6 (5) to give Federer his earliest Grand Slam defeat since the 2003 French Open.[9] This ended Federer's run of 36 consecutive Grand Slams where he had reached at least the quarterfinals. Stakhovsky was ranked 116 at the time, and Federer was ranked 3. Stakhovsky subsequently lost to Jürgen Melzer in the third round, going down in four sets.
