        "text": "October 4, 1944\n\nI WAS called to general staff headquarters to attend a meeting of all members of the Serbian State Guard1 (Srpska Drzavna Straza). The hall was packed and among those present was Gen Stevan M Radovanovic, former commander of the Serbian gendarmerie and the SDS.\n\nI quickly learned why he was among us. The previous day, General (Milan) Nedic2 had released all officials, officers and guards from their obligations as the Serbian government had ceased to exist. Gen Borivoje Jonic, who was only too well aware of the high regard in which the SDS holds its old commander, asked Radovanovic to attend to tell us what was happening.\n\nSpeeches — given by both generals and Major Danilo Stojanovic (general staff) — informed us that from today we are under the direct orders of the Royal Yugoslav Army in the Homeland (Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Vojska u Otadzbini — JVuO)3.\n\nAfter various explanations and instructions we were effectively divided into three groups. The first is to go to Kragujevac with Lt Col Petar Stankovic, the second to Jagodina under my command, and the third to Krusevac under Major Slobodan L Trifkovic, commander of the SDS in Pozarevac. Each man was given six months’ pay.\n\nAs I was leaving, my good friend Lt Col Stojan Saks of the gendarmerie came over. We’ve known each other for years. In fact, since I was stationed in Subotica where he was gendarmerie commander. He put his arm round my shoulders and said: “Don’t leave Belgrade. I guarantee nothing will happen to you.” My reply was terse and to the point: “Stojan, I’ve sworn an oath and I intend to remain true to it.”\n\nWe parted without shaking hands but I gave him a look of contempt. This gentleman, who kowtows to the communists, and is possibly one of their agents, has high standing in the SDS as interpreter and liaison with the German high command.\n\nThroughout the meeting I weighed up the men present and saw many different looks on their faces. Basic fear was mixed with elation, stubborn defiance with a lack of stomach for the coming fight, clear suffering with a fear of the unknown, and strong faith with foreboding. But above all there were thoughts of blood, killing, imprisonment, persecution and the new concentration camps.\n\nAs I returned home in the early evening, Belgrade was gloomy. The sky was shut out by thick, black clouds and the wind scattered branches and twigs about the empty streets. It was a deeply moving scene. It seemed like a warning that a terrible fate awaits our beautiful city . . . that within a few days it will yet again feel the full fury of war, destruction and suffering.\n\nTired and preoccupied, I hurried home for the next day’s journey and great uncertainty. The situation is dreadful but there’s no way out. There’s only one path I can take and that’s the one of honour, suffering and sacrifice. Not for one single minute have I considered reneging on the vow I made, as so many others have, just to save my neck. My blood boiled so much at these thoughts that I refused to consider them. Instead, I concentrated on our own ideals, about the Ravna Gora4 movement, and about the way our conquering troops, led by King Peter and Cica5 (Draza Mihailovic), would make a glorious return to our villages.\n\nWhen I got home and explained what was happening, my sister-in-law, who is married to Milos Pajevic with whom I was at the military academy, tried to convince me to stay, just like Saks did, assuring me that nothing would happen. I believe she was a communist before the war.\n\nIt’s under this type of influence that I await the morning when I will leave my beloved Belgrade. It’s a city that reeks of blood and sacrifice as new suffering approaches. It makes me think back to the horrors she endured in the First World War, and in the second. In both she was set alight and crumbled in the blood of her people. Throughout her history she has been forced to endure much and to bear a heavy cross of suffering. Such is the strange fate of Belgrade.\n\nOctober 5\n\nI was at the muster point by 6am and I found Lt Col Miodrag Tojic and a corporal. We waited until 11am but no one came. We then took the train to Jagodina, arriving at 7pm.\n\nOctober 6\n\nWe learned that a company of SDG from Pozarevac district was cut off by the communists. It has been removed from the register.\n\nGen Radovanovic, Gen Jonic, Col Brana Zivkovic and some more men have arrived from Belgrade via Kragujevac. We immediately made contact with the JVuO commander for Serbia, who instructed us that all SDS units should combine to create a Serbian Shock Corps (Srpski Udarni Korpus) which would be led by Gen Radovanovic with Gen Jonic as his second-in-command.\n\nCapt Mandic was sent to Belgrade with orders for those officers who had remained in the city. They are to immediately report for duty or face execution. A number of officers answered the call including Lt Col Branko Malesevic. However, very few headquarters staff arrived. They chose the other option, to stay. They’ve deceived themselves that communism isn’t what it was in 1917 but they are badly misleading themselves if they genuinely believe the communists will respect the Geneva Convention and other international agreements. We have heard they were all rounded up except for their helpers and informers. No doubt they have been killed.\n\nOctober 7\n\nWe have been working to form the Serbian Shock Corps. All the units that made it to Jagodina are involved.\n\nOctober 8\n\nCol Zivkovic ordered me to be by the telephone at SDS district command. About 6pm we received a call from the commander of a rural police detachment in Sviljanic who told us the Red Army had arrived there. Sensing my disbelief, he said: “Here’s one of their officers who wants to talk to you.” Then there was a Russian voice saying: “Comrade, how many German troops do you have over there?” “100,000,” I replied. “We’ll be there soon to liberate you,” the Russian answered.\n\nI swore at him using the language I learned in 1916 from the Russian prisoners of war in my home town of Benkovac, Dalmatia, which was then in the Austrian empire. It’s strange how easily you learn such words and never forget them.\n\nI immediately gave the news to Col Zivkovic and then, on his orders, to Gen Radovanovic. I returned to HQ and stayed by the phone. About midnight it rang again. The caller did not identify himself but briefly stated: “The Romanian red cavalry has reached Lapovo and is heading for Jagodina and Velika Planina.” I immediately informed the officer commanding.\n\nOctober 9\n\nBecause the Soviets were so close, we were ordered to make for Rekovac. We set off about 2am and completed the withdrawal the same day. As we left Jagodina there was great alarm with people asking why we were leaving rather than staying to defend them. The town police came with us.\n\nIn the afternoon, Radovanovic and Jonic returned to Jagodina, and upon seeing how law and order had broken down to be replaced with looting and robbery ordered the police to go back and restore order along with a single SDS company from Morava district under the command of Major Milojevic.\n\nBefore we left, I tried to convince the prefect, Mr Boskovic, to come with us but my efforts were in vain. He insisted on staying.\n\nWhen we reached Rekovac we were met by the commander of the Belicka Brigade who made it plain he did not want us there. He changed his mind later when he saw our troops and was made aware of the true situation.\n\nOctober 11\n\nAt 7am we left for Kragujevac. On arrival we moved into accommodation in the workers’ colony at the army technical establishment.\n\nOctober 12\n\nIn the evening we arrived in Kraljevo and took up positions in the surrounding villages.\n\nOctober 13\n\nBy chance I came across the sister of my kum6 Nikola Dimitrovic who was married to a young Czech chemist in Serbia. When I called she was both surprised and delighted to see me and insisted I stay for a meal.\n\nOctober 14\n\nWe concentrated our forces in a more compact area. My 1st division was assigned to the villages of Smajla, Bukovica, Dragici and Veskovic. News arrived that the Partisans were trying to break into Serbia from Sandzak and Kosovo. There is fighting around Kopaonik and Toplica, and towards Zlatibor.\n\nI believe it’s important for me to point out that a large number of males — mainly youths —asked to join us. They were all prepared to fight but we have no uniforms, weapons or ammunition to give them.\n\nAlthough the Allies are providing Tito with a great deal of support there is nothing for us. Our only way of getting arms is acquire them from the Germans or seize them. As the Germans are withdrawing from Serbia it ought to be a straightforward process but they mistrust us deeply and fear we’ll attack them. So on the whole we’ve had nothing except from some smaller units.\n\nWhat weapons we have are grossly insufficient for such a huge body of men. That’s why we had to turn the youngsters away. No doubt the communists will take advantage of them.\n\nIn Kraljevo we added about 80 million dinars to our funds from the national bank. The money will make it easier to get things and will improve our standing among the people.\n\nOctober 16\n\nWe left Kraljevo and marched to Mataruska Banja where, at 6am, we took a train for Raska. On the way we received written orders from Lt Col Dragan Racic for an assault on Kraljevo. However, they arrived too late so we took no part in the action.\n\nMataruska Banja caused me to think back to the sweet days of my youth when, as a cadet at the lower school of the military academy, I camped at the Zica monastery and went into the town for refreshment. We also took part in exercises around the picturesque spa.\n\nWe reached Raska in the afternoon.\n\nOctober 17\n\nNews arrived that our corps should head to Skoplje7. According to information received from Col Pogacar, commander of the 3rd division from Kosovska Mitrovica, a delegation has arrived from the city under the leadership of Mr Cohadzic. They want to speak to us about maintaining order in Skoplje.\n\nWe accepted their request with great pleasure and orders were issued for us to depart. In the meantime, however, Col Pogacar informed us that communist Bulgarian troops had broken through the German line and were heading in the direction of Skoplje from Kumanovo. The orders were countermanded and we are now to head for Novi Pazar.\n\nOctober 18\n\nWe left Raska at 8am. When we reached Novi Pazar the town gave no suggestion we were in the middle of a war. The shops were filled with a wide variety of goods, especially tobacco. We used our stay there to buy horses, carts, saddles and anything else we could get.\n\nWhile in a café we heard a speech by our king in which he praised Tito, gave him official recognition, and congratulated him on his efforts to liberate Belgrade. Afterwards, to lift morale, Gen Radovanovic ordered the men to fall in, carried out an inspection and made a patriotic speech.\n\nIt was a timely decision because as well as the king’s speech, Tito had declared an amnesty for any members of nationalist units who were willing to lay down their arms and return home. This was bound to cause trouble and afterwards we became aware of the first signs of discontent.\n\nThe corps commander has been negotiating with the Arnaut8 leader Acif.\n\nIn Novi Pazar we found refugees from Montenegro and among them the family of Pavle Djurisic9. The commander was urged to head for Montenegro but the Albanians wouldn’t allow us to cross their territory and the plan collapsed. We are going to Sjenica instead.\n\nFrom Col Redic we have gathered intelligence about the Partisans, their deployment and strength. Redic knows a great deal about the opportunities in this area and he believes we can get into Sjenica without having to fight.\n\nAs a result of his information, it has been approved that Col Redic go with the 2nd division to take Sjenica supported by the Muslim leader, Imam Pacaris, and Montenegrin units under the command of Major Cimbaljevic.\n\nOctober 21/22\n\nThe 2nd division left Novi Pazar for Duga Poljana around midnight. They found Major Cimbaljevic in Brnica.\n\nOctober 22\n\nAround 6am the 2nd division attacked Sjenica and was met with stiff resistance from the communists. They held an important point ahead of the town — Crni Vrh (Black Peak). They were well dug-in and poured fire down on our troops as they tried to attack.\n\nImam Pacaris and Major Cimbaljevic withdrew taking our troops with them. The assault failed. We suffered casualties and morale was badly shaken.\n\nThe 1st division left for Duga Poljana along a route that was very scenic. Bad weather made the march along a difficult road even tougher. The rise to Postrmca begins from Bela Voda. The road then meanders steeply among the mountain ridges with more than ten steep curves. After you overcome the final rise, and the last curve near Duga Poljana, you reach a high plateau in whose embrace Sjenica lies.\n\nDuga Poljana is a village well fortified and surrounded by wire. There are minefields too. The fortifications remind me of those the Italians built after the First World War when they annexed our part of northern Dalmatia.\n\nWhen we arrived, we deployed in the surrounding area. The headquarters of my 1st division has been placed with the imam. News arrived that there is a large number of Partisans around Sjenica. They hold Tara and other villages.\n\nOctober 23\n\nThe 2nd division mounted another unsuccessful attack on Sjenica. Morale has fallen even further as a result, and so much so that a kind of panic has broken out. Col Redic has asked the corps commander that the officers take over the defence of Duga Poljana because morale in the ranks is so poor. The commander calmed him down so that at least his units remained in a state of readiness.\n\nOctober 24\n\nThe 2nd division — actually one part of it — was involved in fighting the Partisans this morning at Brzanska Kosa. During this time a plan was drawn up for a new assault, tomorrow, involving the full strength of the 1st and 2nd divisions. The 1st is to attack from the left of the road from Duga Poljana. Crni Vrh is in this sector. The 2nd division will attack from the right. Col Zivkovic will be in charge of the operation.\n\nWe’ve received information that the communists are fighting to gain time while they evacuate their wounded, their equipment and all the other items they have looted from Sjenica and the surrounding area.\n\nOctober 25\n\nThe 1st and 2nd divisions attacked Sjenica as planned. To make the assault easier it was necessary to take the fortified position on Crni Vrh. We had to neutralise the Breda machine gun that was sowing death among our men. By chance, a German unit came by and did the job for us using flak. That made things much easier and after a short battle we took Sjenica.\n\nThere were losses on both sides but it’s important to point out that that the communists killed a number of our troops they had taken prisoner. They left their bodies by the roadside so that we would see them. No doubt they wanted to show us the sort of punishment awaiting any of us who were captured. That’s their tactic — terror.\n\nThe communists’ attempts to unsettle us haven’t worked. In fact, they have only served to make us even more determined to keep to the path we have chosen. However, we also saw some desertions. These came as a result of the king’s speech and our first battle casualties.\n\nMajor Kazakovic left with his battalion, Capt Strahinja Jovovic with his company and, after Col Pogacar’s report, Capt Vulovic tricked us and fled from Raska taking 30 soldiers with him.\n\nAfter the fall of Sjenica, we saw the arrival of the remaining JVuO units that had been moving through Cacak and Ivanjica. From what their commanders said, they have also suffered hardships and losses.\n\nOctober 26/27\n\nWe have used our time in Sjenica to gather intelligence about the communists.\n\nOctober 28\n\nOn our way to Prijepolje we passed through Milosev Do. The road is difficult and many of the buildings alongside have been reduced to rubble. But we’ve managed to surmount all the obstacles.\n\nOctober 29\n\nAfter a short battle we entered Prijepolje. The town is deserted because the communists took everyone with them as they withdrew except for one or two older people.\n\nToday I was promoted chief of staff of the Serbian Shock Corps by Major Danilo Stojanovic of the general staff. Lt Col Miodrag Tojic has been appointed to my post as assistant to the commander of the 1st division.\n\nIn Prijepolje we encountered new problems that have presented us with great difficulties because of our lack of equipment and supplies. One is the blown bridge over the River Lim. From the left back, on Gradina hill, the communists are able to concentrate fire on the main road and at the point where the bridge should stand. We don’t have the weapons to retaliate.\n\nOctober 30\n\nThe corps commander convened a conference with Col Keserovic about further movements. The commander from Serbia was instructed to head for Visegrad because it’s impossible to build a crossing over the Lim.\n\nOctober 31\n\nAs part of our efforts to neutralise communist positions on Gradina hill it was decided to attack the town and take it. Major Vesic was put in charge of the operation and it was successfully carried out. During the night, the communists launched a mortar attack on Prijepolje but with little effect.\n\nMore talks were held about our future movements.\n\nNovember 1\n\nCapt Dimitrijevic was given the job of putting a bridge over the Lim but proved unable to do so. Then we learned that the near-by Germans were able to construct a crossing. We told them to help us or we would attack them. They agreed but it seems they need a bridge, too, to guard their flank.\n\nNovember 2\n\nThe 5th brigade of the 2nd division reached the left bank of the Lim by using rafts.\n\nNovember 3\n\nResting in Prijepolje. The Partisans launched a mortar attack during the night, firing about 15 rounds. Corps headquarters received orders to head for Pljevlja.\n\nNovember 4\n\nWork has begun on the bridge. Little by little troops are getting to the left bank by raft.\n\nNovember 5\n\nThe bridge is complete and useable. Both divisions have crossed the river.\n\nNovember 6\n\nThe day was spent getting the remainder of our forces across the Lim.\n\nDuring the fighting around the Stolac – Krusevlje position our forces suffered the following losses: the 1st division lost 12 NCOs and privates. The 2nd division lost one officer (Capt Sime Hadzic, commanding officer of the 5th battalion, 5th brigade), and four NCOs. Five men were wounded and five are missing.\n\nNovember 7\n\nCorps headquarters is in Prijepolje because the two divisions have combined their units under the command of Col Keserovic.\n\nToday the presidential election is taking place in the USA. We’re hoping it will result in a change of policy. Surely they will at least turn against the Russians and stop them advancing too far into Europe to keep them away from the Mediterranean? That makes sense and history tells us that it’s been British policy for centuries.\n\nOur dreams were quickly shattered. The US Air Force attacked Prijepolje and inflicted heavy casualties on us. The situation is clear — they consider us to be the enemy. The raid was carried out at Tito’s request like the bombing in Serbia.\n\nI lay on my back on a knoll above the road in Vakuf and watched the bombs fall on Prijepolje and then on the hills where our troops were sheltering. I had a clear view of how they came down. They cut through the air then exploded loudly spreading death. The blasts threw stones into the air causing more damage.\n\nI was lucky to be on the knoll. The worst I suffered was some grazing from the stones but in one ravine 300 of our men, women and children were buried alive.\n\nWhen the din stopped I became aware of Sgt Major Kravica. One of his arms had been torn off at the shoulder and he was screaming in agony. I quickly got him to the medics and, thank God, his life was saved. I am sure God will help him. Corps doctor Lt Col Zika Milovanovic certainly has his hands full.\n\nAt night the corps moved to Cadinje and I moved in with Miodragovic. Fate has decreed that I visit this place for a second time. I was here in 1941 and came across Gen Ilija Brasic, Gen Miodrag Damjanovic and Gen Milan Zelenik who were being held by the Germans. Just as then we are faced with so many difficult questions, ones to which we have no answers. The only thing of which we can be certain is that now, as then, there will be a great deal of suffering.\n\nNovember 8\n\nCorps HQ is still in Cadinje. Around noon the Americans bombed Prijepolje again.\n\nNovember 9/12\n\nNo special changes. We can hear fighting. The communists are attacking from the direction of Belo Polje but without success.\n\nNovember 13\n\nThe commander for Serbia has ordered Col Pogacar, commander of the 3rd division, to hurry up and join the other corps.\n\nNovember 14\n\nWe’ve heard from the commander of Serbia’s headquarters that the Allies have landed in Metkovica. Our troops, under the command of Gen Petar Zivkovic, have landed in Cavtat.\n\nNovember 15\n\nToday we moved from Cadinje to Pljevlja. The weather was terrible, thick clouds and rain, and the road was in terrible condition. Headquarters was established in the town, in the house of a poor Muslim. There are a lot of people in the house and three or four daughters in the harem. He gave us a friendly welcome but even so I felt I should be cautious and ordered a thorough search before we moved in. The address is 7 Drinska Street. 1st division HQ and the headquarters company are next door. The troops have been deployed.\n\nNovember 16-17\n\nStill in Pljevlja.\n\nROYAL Yugoslav Army Commemorative War Cross presented to Lt Col Petar Pavasovic in 1966 by King Peter II\n\nNovember 18\n\nI visited the monastery of the Holy Trinity which is very old and full of interesting monuments.\n\nAround 7pm we retired for some rest. Only Sgt Major Marko and myself remained awake. He asked me why I wasn’t asleep with the others and I said: “Marko, I have an awful feeling something’s going to happen tonight.” We continued to talk and then we heard gunfire, but far from Prijepolje towards Jabuka. I woke the commander who went to the window, listened for a while, told me it was only skirmishes involving the outpost units, and returned to bed. It was about 8pm.\n\nHowever, the situation deteriorated rapidly. The fighting spread and news came that the communists had been able to get into the town because the Toplica corps had withdrawn from Tvrdas. A group of about 30 Partisans had got past our sentries by putting royal cockades on their caps and passing themselves off as local Cetniks.\n\nThey had managed to take control of several important points including the mosque and church tower, from where they were sending down automatic fire, tracers and dumdum bullets. Our men were firing back.\n\nI urged the corps commander that HQ staff should ignore their orders to stay put and take on the Partisans too. He agreed, and as we moved out we came across Major Milenko Solaric’s battalion. As we continued a mortar fell near by. I was lightly grazed on the hand but my escort, Miloje O Joksimovic, was wounded in both feet.\n\nWe eventually reached Bogisevac. Orders were given that no one should open fire until the Partisans came within grenade-throwing range.\n\nNovember 19\n\nThe fight for Pljevlja went on through the night. Amid the chaos, some Cetniks deserted, leaving in the direction of Cajnice. When we shouted to them to stop they said they were broken and had to reorganise.\n\nWe deployed on both sides of the road. The 2nd brigade was on the right, commanded by Lt Col Sekulic, and the 1st brigade on the left, under Lt Col Dusan Dragovic. Further to the left was the 2nd division, while HQ troops were right on the road.\n\nJust before dawn the Partisans came up against Major Dusan Dinic’s battalion and were met with grenades and heavy automatic fire. They were forced back but as they retreated a heavy fog came down and they were able to get away. They left a lot of dead men behind.\n\nBy 6am it was all over and our first man into the town was Lt Ljubomir Grdanovic. He used the siren at the electricity sub-station to signal that the place was clear. Once in Pljevlja we found more casualties, communist and our own. Beside the dead men and animals there were burned-out buses and looted buildings.\n\nLt Onic, who was wounded earlier and hospitalised in Baraka, was hit again when a piece of shrapnel smashed through a wall.\n\nThanks to the bravery of the 1st and 2nd divisions the communists have been beaten and Pljevlja remains in our hands.\n\nWhen we got into the town we heard that Vojvoda10 Gordic was dead along with his 16-year-old son. According to what I was told, when Gordic heard the battle he rushed out of the house where he was spending the night and into an air-raid shelter. Inside, instead of finding his own troops, he found Partisans. They killed him, then broke into the house of the prefect, and killed him and Gordic’s son.\n\nI went with Gen Radovanovic to offer condolences to the prefect’s family. We found the prefect laid out in his ceremonial uniform.\n\nNovember 24\n\nIn Cajnice.\n\nNovember 25\n\nWe left Cajnice for Luka, about 3km away.\n\nNovember 26/30\n\nIn Luka.\n\nDecember 1\n\nWe left Cajnice for Gorazde. HQ staff departed about 8am, arriving two hours later. The town was packed with troops. We had to wait until the bridge over the Drina was repaired, and I could only marvel at the ingenuity of Kalabic’s men as they erected a suspension bridge. In Gorazde our future movements were revised.\n\nDecember 2\n\nWe left Gorazde for Ustikolina. I joined generals Radovanovic and Jonic in their car and we entered the village about 5km ahead of our troops. As we went in, the vehicle was surrounded by about 200 Muslims in Croat Domobran11 uniforms. It was very frightening.\n\nI got out of the car and asked them who they were. They said they were deserters from Pavelic’s12 forces. Eventually I was able to speak to an NCO who claimed to have seniority and I explained who we were, why we had come, and asked them to help us deploy in the surrounding villages. There was much to-ing and fro-ing but in the end we came to an agreement in which we promised them we would leave their women alone and take nothing by force.\n\nAs word got out that we were in Ustikolina, men arrived who recognised their former officers and NCOs among us. Some of the reunions were very touching. The Muslims gave us food and good billets and we were able to get good rest.\n\nLater, we received order no 100, issued yesterday, in which the supreme command ordered the formation of three armies and a Muslim corps. I gathered all the members of the Muslim unit and read it to them. They immediately removed their Croat badges and replaced them with royal ciphers they had made from cardboard. They then put themselves at our service. They were lightly armed.\n\nDecember 3/4\n\nStill in Ustikolina.\n\nDecember 5\n\nFollowing a river, HQ staff has reached Pavici. The road was so hard we were unable to meet our marching schedule.\n\nDecember 6\n\nWe have reached Hrenovica via Sofica, Bukovica and Turkovici. In Bukovica we attended the baptism of the daughter of Rade Vukasinovic. Gen Radovanovic was godfather. The priest gave a blessing in the name of St Nicholas, the patron saint of Vukasinovic’s family.\n\nRain began to fall, and wet weather makes it even more difficult to move through the Bosnian forests. Consequently, we asked the commander for Serbia if the troops could rest for two days. The bridges over the River Praca are down, too, and need repair.\n\nDecember 7\n\nHeadquarters staff left Hrenovica for Strana. No fighting today.\n\nDecember 8\n\nMoving again. From Strana we have gone to Plane via Djedovici. Yesterday, at 6am, the 3rd division was in action against the Romanska Partisan Brigade. We sustained casualties and Lt Petar Preradovic was killed. We buried him in Dedovici. Major Dusan Dinic was badly wounded and is in hospital.\n\nThe others killed are: Sgt Janko Djurdjevic, Sgt Dragoslav Ilija Markovic, Sgt Ivan Milan Stojkovic and Pte Dimitrije Zivojin Milosevic. There were wounded men too. However, communist losses were much worse.\n\nWe captured the Partisan archives, finding among them act no 343 issued on September 12, 1943. It was sent to all commanders and political commissars and stated\n\nBecause the Serb people are doing all they can to avoid joining communist ranks, it is necessary to burn and demolish Serb homes, especially those of the Cetniks and their collaborators. By doing so we will provoke the Cetniks into burning the homes of those who have joined us.\n\nThe burning of Serb homes should be carried out by Partisan fighters from neighbouring villages. That will tie them to us more firmly by making it impossible for them to desert to the Cetniks.\n\nBy burning Serb homes we will create a large number of homeless people from whom we will be able to fashion a proletariat of Serbs prepared to die for the communist party.\n\nWherever and whenever possible, the Ustase should be encouraged to burn Serb homes and to kill Serbs. Through Luburic, our Ustasa comrade, we will maintain links with Slavonia and move one of our main revolutionary formations, Ustase wearing the red star, to Bosnia, giving them the brief of undermining the Serbs by saying the Cetniks are Nazi collaborators.\n\nWherever possible we must fight the Cetniks in Muslim villages, shooting at them from Muslim houses. By doing so we will provoke the Cetniks to kill Muslims and burn their homes. We can then exploit this enmity to get the Muslims to join us in fighting the Serbs.\n\nWherever and whenever possible we must attack the Germans when they are near Serb villages. That way, the Germans will aim their retaliation at the Serbs and that will help our cause.\n\nDuring the battle, the Ustase attacked us from behind but they were quickly silenced.\n\nDecember 9\n\nFrom Djedovici we moved to Kosutica. The 3rd division helped the troops of Sinisa Pazarc in a battle with the Partisans near the village of Sejkovici. Later they were in action near Salica Kuca.\n\nCorps HQ is in a ruined mosque. We have lit a fire right in the middle of the building and the smoke is choking us. I’ve got an inflamed eye and my vision’s badly affected. I’m putting wet cloths on my eyes whenever I get the chance to lie down but we’re inundated with messengers from all points of the compass.\n\nDecember 10\n\nWe’re still in Kosutica. Our forces are deployed around Salica Kuca, Orlovic, Gajevi and Kratelj.\n\nDecember 11\n\nThree officers and 100 men have fled towards Sarajevo. We believe they have joined a Serbian Volunteer Corps unit. The officers, captains Baracki, Suput and Bosanac, are from the same unit as the wounded Major Dinic.\n\nDecember 12\n\nStill in Kosutica and everything remains the same. Nothing of importance has happened. We’ve got some food and it’s all been paid for.\n\nDecember 13\n\nDesertions continue. Major Alexander Stikic, Major Blagoje Milic and 280 men have left the corps and headed off towards Sarajevo. Capt Stojanovic was sent after them but was unable to catch them.\n\nToday is the slava13 of our king. Father Markovic took the service and afterwards gave a good speech. Generals Radovanovic and Jonic also spoke.\n\nFor us, today is very significant as we have made contact with the supreme command. Our Cica (Draza Mihailovic) is close by. Just knowing that has eased the pressure and we are all delighted. It has been decided that tomorrow, Gen Jonic, myself, and the commander of the 2nd division, Col Dragutin Redic, will visit. 5 Brigade will escort us under the command of Lt Col Dragutin V Cecevic.\n\nThe corps commander has instructed me to ask Cica if he will posthumously promote and decorate the officers who have been killed.\n\nDecember 14\n\nWe set off at 7am through Vrapci and Knezine to Kruscica where the supreme command is based. It was wonderful to see Cica again. As is our custom we kissed on both cheeks while shaking hands. I’ve known him since 1931 when we were together on a chemical warfare course in Krusevac. I have to say he’s changed a great deal. Time and hardship have combined with worries and the huge weight of responsibility to change his face. Even so, he was in good spirits.\n\nWe sat at a table and as we waited for Cica, Gen Jonic made several attempts to get me to leave the room so that he and Cica could talk alone. I refused. I know Jonic is a schemer and, no doubt, wanted to criticise Gen Radovanovic so that he could take over command.\n\nCica told me he couldn’t promote the dead but he could decorate them and asked that their service records be left with him.\n\nHe went on to tell us we had been abandoned by everyone. Even so, he believes the Allies will think again. He wants us to winter in the Majevica mountains, where there is plenty of food, to ready ourselves for renewed action in the spring.\n\nI have to say that he was very bitter in his feelings towards the Allies and their actions. But at the same time he had a fervent belief that they will eventually recognise their mistakes and turn to him again.\n\nWe left the supreme command pleased that we had seen Cica but I have to admit that the Allies’ actions have left me deeply worried. I never expected anything like this. But his deep faith in right’s ultimate victory has inspired me. I am sure that what is happening is only temporary and that we will not be forgotten by the great Allies — the warriors for freedom and democracy. It was in this frame of mind that I reached Vrapci where I spent the night.\n\nCica has ordered that the 1st division go to Kosutica to guard the supreme command. He’s told us that from now on we are under his direct command.\n\nDecember 15\n\nToday Cica met our troops in Vrapci and have a speech in which he outlined the tasks he has in store for the JVuO — similar to what he told us when we met him. Our soldiers were heading for Drapcic but, because of the meeting in Vrapci, we were unable to make it and corps HQ spent the night in Babine. We have received intelligence that there are around 40 local Partisans — former Cetniks — at Zaravici. At Drapcic I got some oatbread. It was sweet and satisfying.\n\nDecember 16\n\nAt around 2.30pm we arrived in Gurdici where I bought 3kg of cornflour for 400 dinars and 2kg of beans, so I should be all right for a few days.\n\nI’ve got hold of a Sarajevo newspaper for December 8 which says that around 10,000 of our children have been taken to Russia. It’s left me feeling extremely anxious about my family.\n\nDecember 17\n\nToday we reached Zivinice without any fighting. The Partisans withdrew before we came into contact with them.\n\nDecember 18\n\nWe’ve heard that the communists are taking livestock from the people. Their 20th shock brigade has withdrawn towards Vlasini under pressure from our forces.\n\nAround 6pm Capt Lazar Ristic and Capt Stojan (Stole) Mihailovic invited me to celebrate the eve of St Nicholas’s Day with them. They gave me fried liver and rakija (slivovic — plum brandy) and I stayed the night with them. It made me cast my mind back to the way we celebrated our baptismal name at home, from childhood to recent times.\n\nDecember 19\n\nNews has come through that Jagodina has fallen to nationalist forces.\n\nAt 7.30am around 30 of us who were celebrating St Nicholas’s Day got together to cut the cake. I then fasted until nightfall.\n\nAt 10am we set off for Turalici and Kljestani, where we arrived at 4pm. There was a short fight, two Partisans were killed, and we captured their archives.\n\nI stayed at the house of Mr A Lukic who served us with warm bread made from cornflour and with milk. Oh it was sweet. Lukic is a nationalist and was very open with us. He’s confident the king will return bringing freedom with him.\n\nDecember 20\n\nIn Kljestani.\n\nDecember 21\n\nAt 9am we crossed the Drinjaca river near Strmica. While we were doing so an enemy trojka appeared and opened fire on us. It was swiftly liquidated.\n\nThe mountain paths were steep and icebound, making progress very difficult.\n\nWe met up with 15 young Cetniks from the Dinarska Division who were heading for the supreme command. Among them was the brother of Marin Strude with whom I was at the military academy. My relative, Voja Pavasovic, asked permission to go with them. I agreed and wished him a safe journey. I hope we will soon meet again.\n\nDecember 22\n\nSnow. Day and night we’ve been fighting on the left bank of the Drinjaca. From intelligence received it seems we’ve reached an area where the Partisans are strong. No doubt we’ll have a lot of work to do in dealing with them.\n\nFrom Strmice we moved to Majdan, where I stayed in Pante Bozic’s house. The village is in a hollow, surrounded by high ridges. We’re well prepared for any surprises.\n\nDecember 23\n\nIt appears my fears of yesterday were well founded. Advancing as ordered, we broke through near Dzebar around 10am and immediately came under fire — towards our front and on the left flank. After a difficult battle the Partisans were forced towards Naseoci.\n\nAmong those killed were the commander of the 2nd division, his 19-year-old son, Ranko, and their escort. The men took the news of Col Redic’s death very badly. It took a great deal of effort to raise their morale and convince them to carry on.\n\nAfter this it was decided we change direction and turn towards Matijevici.\n\nDecember 24\n\nCold and foggy weather. At 7am we carried out the funerals of Col Redic, his son, their escort and a soldier who died of his wounds during the night. As ever, it was difficult for us to bury our heroes and leave them behind. Thank God we had a priest to take the service.\n\nAt 8am we set off via Podgaj to Lukavica. Around 11am we were in action near Markovaca and Gradina. Corps HQ was set up in Vrnojevici. The assaults on Gradina were unsuccessful. There are four pillboxes on top guarding the way to Tuzla.\n\nCaptured Partisans have told us they have reserves, some of which have been brought in from Serbia purely to fight us. Some of our soldiers found relatives among them and the reunions were very sad. These lads have been pressed into fighting, no doubt in the belief that we would refuse to retaliate against our own, or even that we might give ourselves up, allowing them to easily liquidate us. If so, they completely miscalculated. Our men fought courageously and with great determination.\n\nDecember 25\n\nWe are in Vrnojevici. According to a directive issued by the supreme command, we should have attacked Tuzla but, because of unforeseen circumstances, it wasn’t possible.\n\nAs I write these notes I can hear fighting towards Djurdjevic, which is being attacked by the Leskovac Brigade. The 2nd division has withdrawn to the left bank of the Gotusa river. Although the new commander was ordered not to open fire too early his subordinates failed to comply. They began firing from too long a distance, revealing their position, and allowing the Partisans to hit back with mortars. If they had waited until the communists had got close, the enemy wouldn’t have been able to use mortars because their own men would have been in the firing zone.\n\nWhen I realised the 2nd division was retreating, I deployed the HQ troops and the senior reserve as a precaution. I had our single remaining mortar round fired at a group of Partisans who could be clearly seen from our vantage point. We scored a direct hit and they fled.\n\nDuring the retreat, the new commander of the 2nd division, Col Voja Petrovic, was wounded on hill K535, while his chief of staff, Major Ljubisa Djordjevic, was wounded in the heel. We suffered five others wounded and five dead. Lt Col Petar Stankovic was ordered to take command of the division.\n\nWe’ve found ourselves in Srpska Brnica. We were harried by fire from Gradina, Brdo and Markovac. About 4pm our 1st division broke through from the direction of Zukic. We were under fire all night long without a break. It was easy for the communists because they had plenty of men and supplies while we were exhausted with only a limited supply of ammunition. But we withstood their assaults decisively and with courage.\n\nDecember 27\n\nWe left Srpska Brnica to attack Zivinice, which is about 10km south of Tuzla in the Sprec valley. The river flows north from Zivinice. To the south, running parallel with the road from Kladanj to Tuzla, via Stupani and Zivinice, is the river Gostelja. Also to the south is the Ockova which, about 10km south of Zivinice, turns sharply north east. The Gostelja flows into the Sprec, and the Ockova into the Gostelja in the immediate vicinity of Zivinice.\n\nToday’s mission was going smoothly until we broke through on the right bank of the Ockova. Fate decreed that we had to lose another brave officer, one of the company commanders, a man who showed great bravery and prowess in the battles with the communists around Belgrade. That man is Capt Vojin Garic. He perished in Alik, and was buried in Muslimanska Zivinica.\n\nWe broke through into the Muslimanska Zivinica area around 4.30pm on the right bank of the Oskova. I conducted a quick survey of the area with regard to our attack on Zivinice. In front of us is the Oskova valley. The river is deep, with steep banks, and is traversed by two bridges — one road, one railway. On the left bank there is a gentle spur which slopes from west to east, becoming part of a gradual fall towards the river Spreca.\n\nOn the west side, our left flank, the land climbs to around 600m in height, dominating the entire area. That’s the key to our deployment. Whoever holds that high ground is king. If the enemy takes it we’ll be in big trouble as they’ll be able to bring heavy fire down on us.\n\nAfter a short recce I drew up plans for the rest of today and tomorrow. As we have limited resources and don’t know what awaits us I’ve decided the best option is for one brigade to cross the Oskova to guard the bridge which is the key to the situation. The majority of the forces will stay on the right until tomorrow.\n\nIntelligence about the enemy, his strengths and deployment, will be gathered under cover of darkness.\n\nGen Radovanovic approved my plan with some minor adjustments. Unfortunately Gen Jonic didn’t and insisted that the attack on Zivinice should begin today. I disagreed with him and told him that what he was proposing was an adventure that could cost us dearly. He stubbornly refused to change his mind, accusing me of being a coward. Eventually, Gen Radovanovic gave in to him and we set off into the unknown or, as our people would say, like geese into fog.\n\nDuring our deployment, which was carried out very cautiously and in battle order, Lt Col Victor Mladenovic, commander of the South Moravska group of corps, arrived at HQ and told Gen Radovanovic his troops had entered Zivinice. He said the ringing of bells we had heard was a display of jubilation from the inhabitants who were delighted our forces had arrived.\n\nOur deployment continued and we found a tall forest in front of us.\n\nAbout half an hour later, Lt Col Mladenovic returned to tell his troops had not, in fact, been able to enter Zivinice. Partisans were defending the bridge with heavy machine guns and he had run out of mortar rounds.\n\nWhat I predicted now began to unfold. We were ordered to retreat and withdrew to the aforementioned spur which we easily found. However, because of the dark, we could take only the most basic defensive measures. We had the steep, sheer Ockova valley behind us — where there were only two bridges — and the unknown in front of us. Before we had time to do anything, before we could even feed the troops, we came under attack but defended ourselves successfully.\n\nDuring the assault, Gen Jonic arrived at HQ and started shouting, demanding to know why corps HQ was always in the front line and asking why more wasn’t being done to keep him safe. He insisted he should spend the night in a solidly constructed house. He claimed the one he was in had flimsy walls which bullets could easily penetrate.\n\nWhen Gen Radovanovic heard what Jonic was saying, he turned to me and said: “Pavasovic, go with the general and see what he wants.” Jonic and I went outside where the battle was in full flow, with bullets flying in all directions. In the midst of this mayhem, Jonic again demanded a well-built house and showed me the only one in the village. However, because it was being used to accommodate the wounded and some troops from our 1st division, I was unable to give it to him. I tried to explain but Jonic interrupted saying: “What do you want?” I replied: “Nothing. It’s you that wants the impossible.” And then we parted.\n\nI couldn’t help but think how cheerful Jonic had been when we set off for Zivinice and how, once his plan was adopted, had called over Lt Col Branko Malesevic and told him that as soon as we reached Zivinice he was to find him a hotel room and to start baking bread. I have to say Jonic never spoke of Gen Radovanovic. He only spoke of himself.\n\nIn this way the day came to a less than satisfactory end. Thank God we didn’t suffer heavy casualties. It appears the Partisans kept their distance because, in the main, we are seasoned soldiers with few recruits or volunteers. The Partisans were good at ambushing us but when it came to frontal combat they were poor. Eventually the fighting came to an end and an uneasy silence settled upon us.\n\nDecember 28\n\nToday began with more fighting. About 4.30am the Partisans attacked us but were repulsed with heavy casualties. They left about 28 dead while the worst we suffered was some wounded soldiers.\n\nAfterwards, one of Kalabic’s14 officers arrived — he was nicknamed Buca (chubby) — and he evacuated the 1st division’s wounded to his base.\n\nAround 10am, just as we were starting to rest and clean our weapons, a new assault began. The 3rd Partisan Brigade had been brought by train from Tuzla and attacked with some force. During the battle, I found myself on the left flank with the corps commander. It was in the afternoon, when the fighting was at its peak, that Svetislav Rakic came over and said: “Victor has fled.” Mladenovic had abandoned the high ground that was vital to our survival.\n\nGen Radovanovic couldn’t believe it. I intervened to ask Col Zivkovic to send one of his battalions to secure the position as quickly as possible. Cika Brana15 chose the brave Major “Bimbo” Anastasijevic who tore to the top of the hill with his heroes, saving us from certain disaster.\n\nAt the same time, a Partisan trojka appeared which had been behind the bridges. A company under the command of a Slovenian officer, whose name I have forgotten, was sent to deal with it and it was quickly liquidated, allowing us to withdraw. It’s against all our instincts to retreat but the enemy pressure is too heavy. Our intention is to get past his left flank under cover of darkness.\n\nThe Partisans have plenty of ammunition and automatic weapons. They’ve got massive firepower even if it isn’t always used to the best effect. We have also suffered many casualties, dead and wounded, and have no reserves to call upon.\n\nWe have found out from captured Partisans that the bells were rung in Zivinice as an emergency signal and reinforcements were immediately sent from Tuzla. We have also learned that if we had attacked Zivinice as planned, we would have blundered into a minefield.The Partisans threw new recruits at us, as well as troops they had ferried in from Serbia.\n\nWe finally left Muslimanska Zivinice for Hrvati, passing through Visca and Konji Planina. After an exhausting march we reached Hrvati and took stock of our casualties.\n\nDecember 29\n\nFrom Hrvati we moved to Pribitkovici. During the night, the 2nd division was attacked by Partisans in Srpska Trestenica where, among others, gendarmerie lieutenant colonels Alexander Mlakad and Scepan Jovanovic were killed. Responsibility for these deaths must rest with senior officers who failed to take the correct measures and, to make matters worse, sent people they thought were members of their families to get slivovic for them. In fact, these people were communist agents and spies who used the opportunity to inform near-by Partisan units about the movements of the 2nd division and 4th brigade. Once the communists received the information, they mounted an assault that cost us a great deal in terms of men and materiel.\n\nDecember 30\n\nWe moved from Pribitkovici to Kesten. Lt Col Zika Andric and Capt Petar Kalabic arrived during the night and relayed orders from the supreme command that we deploy around Kesten, Borik, Podemelovo Brdo and Tociljevo Brdo. On reaching Kesten it was decided that at 1pm the following day the 1st division would relieve the 2nd division. To our right are the forces of Sinisa Pazarc and Capt Kalabic’s Gorska Guard.\n\nDecember 31\n\nToday our wounded and sick should have been evacuated to hospital in Boljanic under the command of Col Vojislav Petrovic. The 1st division has deployed as agreed yesterday.\n\nPazarc’s units and the Gorska Guard have moved on without telling us, which has come as a huge shock. When I received the news I immediately passed it to the commander and advised that we follow them. He agreed and it was decided we go from Kesten to Pasini Konaci to Junozovic which is in the Ozren mountains, not far from Zavidovici. We left Kesten at 2pm.\n\nTired and hungry, frozen and ragged, we set off. Because the route was difficult, and unknown to us, we employed a Muslim as our guide. Darkness fell slowly and the sky above us, like the surrounding mountains, was grey. Snow fell steadily as our column of martyrs slowly made its way like a huge snake, sliding into the unknown along a frozen road. The only light came from their eyes but it was promptly swallowed up by the night.\n\nWe were on edge throughout the march because surprise lurked around every bend in the road. Yet the quiet of the night was broken only by the snorting of the horses, the occasional call of a bird, and the coughing and groans of our sick and wounded. From time there were shouts of “bandage”. Everyone and everything seemed to be against us.\n\nWe couldn’t see the river, but we could hear it. Yet even this sound was muted, much quieter than is normal with mountain rivers. It was as if even the river was finding it difficult to make its way through this dark, mysterious area.\n\n“What time is it?” I asked. “Half-past ten,” came the reply. “Are we far from our destination?” Out of the gloom someone shouted: “We’re making slow progress because the horses are exhausted. They can hardly walk and keep falling over.”\n\nThe freezing dark night generated dark feelings. It was hard for men to see each other’s faces. They knew officers only by the sound of their voices. Somewhere in the distance we could hear gunfire.\n\nAround 11pm the guide came to me and, in a trembling voice, admitted that he was lost. All kinds of thoughts swept through my mind. Was he a traitor? Were we in a communist trap? Should I have him shot? No . . . but he would suffer if he had tricked us.\n\nSaying nothing to Gen Radovanovic I took three soldiers, did my best to look left and right, and then, relying on my military instincts, moved to the left without halting the column. After we had gone about 300 metres, a voice broke through the night. “Halt. Who goes there?” We threw ourselves to the ground and I shouted back: “The army of King Peter II.” The reply came: “Leader, forward. The rest, stay where you are.” I slowly advanced, holding a grenade in my hand while straining my eyes to see where I was going and who was there.\n\nAll at once I became aware of a fortified position. Next to it was a tree stump around which were gathered some sentries, all in Croat Domobran uniforms. Their leader took me into a shelter, about ten metres square, in which was a group of soldiers. They were illuminated by an oil lamp standing on a table, and at the table sat their senior, a sergeant I think.\n\nAs soon as I appeared at the door, he said to me: “You’re Petar Pavasovic aren’t you?” I answered that I was and he stood up, came to me, and kissed my hand. I asked him how he knew me, and he replied: “I was one of your recruits and later a corporal in the 1st battery 2nd mountain division of the Adriatic artillery brigade in Sinj in 1925.” The soldiers in front of me were deserters from Pavelic’s cursed NDH16.\n\nI was genuinely touched by his warm welcome and clapped him on the back. I explained that we had been marching for almost 12 hours and that we were looking for Junozovic. I added that we had some sick and wounded and it was imperative for them to find some shelter to rest and gather what strength they could for the rigours of the following day.\n\nTo my great relief he told me Junozovic was in the valley beneath. He pointed to the village which was, in fact, quite close. He added: “I’m from Junozovic. I’ll go down there with you and help you settle your men.”\n\nThat’s how it was. We went into the village where he woke the head man who did all he could to help us. Thanks to these Muslims we spent the night with a roof over our heads and something to eat.\n\nAmong our sick was a 16-year-old girl who had attached herself to us. Her father, a colonel I believe, had been killed. She had pneumonia. We left her with my former corporal, giving him her family’s address. We also left a number of men and put their fate in God’s hands. It was up to him whether they would recover and find their way home. Those of us with enough strength would continue on our way.\n\nWhen we had settled in and put our defences in place, representatives of the various units visited HQ and told the commander that the men were exhausted and demoralised. Ammunition had run out, their weapons were in a poor state of repair and in many cases unusable. We had no medical supplies and there were strong communist forces around us being helped by the Ustase. We were in no condition to take them on.\n\nThey suggested we surrender to the Germans in Zavidovici and then to somehow get to Slovenia to join up with the strong forces we had there to continue the fight. Tired as he was, Gen Radovanovic listened carefully and, when they had finished, told them to rest and that we would discuss matters further the following day. He was depressed and anxious. Although he had fought in the Balkan Wars and the First World War he had never face a situation as tough as this one. Should we abandon the fight? If we did, would be traitors to the ideals for which we had fought?\n\nWhat would Cica say? All these thoughts were in the mind of Radovanovic — a veteran warrior, superb officer and hero.\n\nAs far as I can work out, those in the ranks who do not hold fast to Cica’s ideals have become disillusioned with the way things have gone and have spread doubt among the men, telling them to seek new paths. The troops are very receptive to such calls because they are at the limit of their endurance and without the means to make war.\n\nOur soldiers and the other nationalist forces are convinced we do not have the strength to cope with further attacks by the communists who are being supported by the Ustase and the Allies. They believe that this will extinguish the flame Draza lit at Ravna Gora in May, 1941. At that time the rest of the world marvelled at his bravery in throwing down the gauntlet to Hitler, whose military machine was at the peak of its power.\n\nMulling over these thoughts we await tomorrow.\n\n1945\n\nJanuary 1\n\nAfter long and sometime heated discussions it has been decided we give ourselves up to the Germans in Zavidovici. Men have been assigned to parley with them and negotiate terms.\n\nOne of the main conditions put to us was that we surrender our weapons. We refused as we are going into an area where the Ustase are dominant and the German garrison is too weak to protect us. Our terms were accepted and we are heading down into Zavidovici. But we have not yet decided we are giving up the fight. That will be discussed tomorrow at an officers’ meeting convened by Gen Radovanovic.\n\nJanuary 2\n\nThe meeting of senior officers took place in a large room in the area command building. Gen Radovanovic opened proceedings and explained the situation. He asked everyone present whether they wanted to stay or go to Slovenia.\n\nCol Brana Zivkovic — supported by myself and majors Lazar Janjic, Milos Mar Pavicevic, and Dragisa Jeftic — proposed we seek permission from Cica to go to Slovenia. If he refused it, we would stay put and follow his directives.\n\nMinutes of the meeting were taken by Capt Zivojin Magazinovic. All the feelings and proposals expressed are in the record. But we came to no definite conclusions. It was resolved that the officers go back to their units and see what their troops wanted to do — to go to Slovenia or return to Ozren. When the officers returned they said the overwhelming desire in the ranks was to go to Slovenia.\n\nAfter this, as per Col Zivkovic’s proposal, Gen Radovanovic wrote a letter to the supreme command. This should have been taken by Major Pavicevic but he needed a well-armed escort to get through and we couldn’t supply one. So it was resolved we head north without asking Cica.\n\nA few people refused to move, such as Father Vladimir M Marjanovic, Capt Vojislav R Karlikovic and some other NCOs and soldiers.\n\nJanuary 3\n\nI have begun to think about Gen Jonic and the other officers who were so adamant we let down Cica and leave. He turned his coat when he realised the men wanted to go to Slovenia.\n\nBuoyed by the support of Gen Ljudevit Pogacar, he stopped taking notice of Gen Radovanovic. He and Pogacar went to see the Germans — Jonic claiming to be commander of the SDS and Pogacar of the SGS (Srpska Granicna Straza)17. Knowing this, it wasn’t hard to work out who was behind the proposal that we give up the fight and head for Slovenia — it was Jonic and Pogacar.\n\nJonic’s wish to be commander had come true, but he wasn’t head of the Serbian Shock Corps, he was commanding the Serbian State Guard which had ceased to function on October 4, 1944. Jonic’s great desire to command has again been fulfilled.\n\nNow it’s clear he won’t be returning to Belgrade on Allied tanks he’s gone back to the Germans, and they have accepted him. He’s doing the old dance all over again. He’s received approval to go to Slavonski Brod with another ten officers. A real hero, he’s left the men in the lurch.\n\nJanuary 4\n\nGen Radovanovic, his sons Vojislav and Dragoslav, myself, plus another three officers, some NCOs and men who have stayed with us, left today for Slavonski Brod. So far, we have reached Globarica railway station where we are spending the night. Globarica is about 10km from Zavidovici. I’ve found one of my old soldiers, Marko Markanovic, who served under me in Sinj in 1928-9. He gave me some bacon and pogaca18. He’s been in the Croat Domobran.\n\nJanuary 5\n\nAt 3pm we moved on from Globarica but had to stop at Bradici because the line is damaged on the other side of Maglaj. We learned that the British bombed Belgrade on December 8 and 18.\n\nJanuary 6\n\nChristmas Eve19. My thoughts are all about home and my family. I’ve been thinking a lot about the old days. Many people have been celebrating here, in Cetnik territory.\n\nJanuary 7\n\nChristmas Day. I’m depressed and worried — not about the situation I’m in, but about my family. There are lots of stories about what the communists are doing to our loved ones. At 10am they told us we could continue via Maglaj, Doboj and Bosanski Brod to Slavonski Brod. But the journey is very slow.\n\nJanuary 8\n\nWe arrived in Doboj at 5am, and at Bosanki Brod at 10pm, where the Germans took us under guard to a hospital to spend the night. We found many Cetniks who had volunteered to work in Germany.\n\nOn the train, around 8pm, we heard a voice from an adjacent compartment say: “I’ve heard there is a Serb general here.” The door opened and an Ustasa appeared. He was wearing a leather coat and had a sub-machine gun on his shoulder. I couldn’t see any escort and he appeared to be on his own, but we were ready for any eventuality as we had guns and grenades.\n\nThe man went up to the general, saluted him, and then talked with him for about 20 minutes. In a way, he was apologising for what the Ustase had done. It seemed he knew their days were numbered. When the conversation was over, he saluted again and left. I have no idea of his rank or who he was. Perhaps he used to be one of our officers. We continued on a high state of alert. There was no way of knowing what surprises might be in store for us.\n\nJanuary 9\n\nBosanski Brod. At noon we were taken under guard to Bosanski Brod where we were given a little food. We were led to a hall where there were no beds, just straw on the floor. We were all mixed in together — officers, NCOs and men. The place is filthy.\n\nGen Jonic is in a hotel, and the others in his party are in a barracks. It’s all much better than the conditions we’re enduring. It’s terrible having to watch the old general suffer in the straw and dirt while his one-time helper is lording it in a hotel, enjoying the hospitality the Germans show to their loyal servants.\n\nMajor Danilo Stojanovic has told me he has replaced me as chief of staff of the Serbian Shock Corps and Gen Jonic is the commander.\n\nWe’ve learned that the Ustase caught and killed some of our men who had left on their own.\n\nJanuary 12\n\nWe’re still waiting to see what will happen. It seems the Croats want us transported to Slovenia across their territory.\n\nThe Domobran have brought in around 60 Partisans. These are men who were pressed into service against their will, and who gave themselves up. They have told us about events in Serbia and the execution of nationalists.\n\nOur former officers have visited the camp. They’ve been to see their friends. With them was the wife of Major Ante Vidakovic, a history teacher born in Pozarevac. In 1941 she became a Catholic and moved to Croatia with her husband.\n\nAnte used to celebrate St John’s Day and his kum was Gen Djordje Arandjelovic, then commander of the Potiska division, who was replaced by Gen Ilija Brasic. The woman told me Ante had died near Tuzla fighting the Cetniks.\n\nJanuary 13\n\nSlavonski Brod. We were told we’d be moving on today but not where we’d be going. We believe it’s to join up with our people in Slovenia.\n\nThe Germans took us to the station but we had to hand over all our weapons except for handguns. They were put in another carriage. The train was guarded by the Germans — two officers and one unit of men — who were under orders to fire on anyone who attacked us. “Even on the Ustase?” one of our men asked. The answer was yes.\n\nWe left for Zagreb at 10pm. As we passed through the station at Kapela Batrina the Ustase opened fire and shouted “down with King Peter”.\n\nI was reminded or when I went through Zagreb in 1924 when we were returning from a course in Maribor. The train was decorated with flags, greenery and officers’ cockades. At the station in Zagreb there were trains full of peasants who had been to a mass rally addressed by Stjepan Radic20. They heckled us but there was no violence. Even so, we weren’t allowed off the train.\n\nWe have heard that Capt Zika Radojcic has been killed by the Ustase and that staff officers Lokar and Klisanic have gone over to the Partisans. My classmate21 Ermin Rattan has become commander of a large Croat unit.\n\nJanuary 14\n\nNew Year’s Day. My thoughts have been focused on the good things in my life. My soul yearns and my heart aches — it’s engulfed in a pain that’s choking it as I pray to God that our troubles might be transformed into good fortune.\n\nWe’ve arrived in Brezice where we received hot food and a lace for the night. I was last here nine years ago when I was at the higher school of the military academy. Everything is taken up with memories, memories and more memories.\n\nJanuary 15\n\nArrived in Maribor. Hot food was ready for us, but because of an outbreak of typhus they didn’t allow us to eat it. We spent the night on the station. I took advantage of the dark to slip into a German carriage that was heated.\n\nI’ve got a feeling we’re going to leave Slovenia. It looks like we’ve been duped. Nobody’s telling us anything and everything’s shrouded in secrecy. I’m trying to convince myself that everything will turn out for the best.\n\nJanuary 16\n\nWe left Maribor for Graz where we arrived at 4pm. The journey was so hard and cold that two of our soldiers died. I’m desperate to have a wash and get rid of the bugs.\n\nVarious characteristics have become apparent on the journey — especially selfishness and unsociability on the part of some of our officers. It’s quite right what our people say: snow doesn’t fall to cover the hills but to show up animals’ tracks.\n\nOnce again I had to sleep standing up.\n\nI learned that Major Dragisa Lazarevic, commander of the 6th battalion had died of pneumonia in Zavidovici.\n\nJanuary 17\n\nAt 7am we left Graz for Vienna. The carriage was heated and the countryside was beautiful. Although Graz has been heavily bombed, a lot of the factories by the tracks are untouched. At 8pm we passed through Semering.\n\nIn Wiener Neustadt we got some food but also found out something we weren’t expecting. Our German guards were approached by two officers from the Todt22 organisation. They said that from now on, we would be in their charge. The feeling that we’ve been hoodwinked grows stronger. Gen Jonic has taken us to Germany instead of Slovenia and betrayed us to the Todt organisation.\n\nJanuary 18\n\nWe arrived in Vienna at 6am and were met at the station by a sanitary commission from the city council. We were immediately taken for a bath and all our belongings were disinfected. After that, the senior officers were put in various hotels while the NCOs and men were taken to a barracks.\n\nUnfortunately my group — there are 17 of us — were put in a transit hostel for European workers. There were so many comings and goings that we didn’t get a wink of sleep. Everyone else got decent hotel rooms. After breakfast we had to leave until dinner, then until tea, and so on.\n\nThose of us at the hostel are: Col Voja Petrovic, Lt Col Bozidar Nikolic, Lt Col Petar Stankovic, myself, Lt Col Branislav Djordjevic, Lt Col Branko Malesevic, Lt Col Andrija Jevremovic, Lt Col Dragutin Cecevic, Lt Col Mirko Stankovic, Major Lazar Janjic, Major Lazar Petrovic, Major Milutin Ristic, Major Bora Jovanovic, Major Sava Sivacki, Major Miodrag Djulakovic, Major Milenko Solaric, and Nenad, the son of Col Petrovic.\n\nGen Jonic and Gen Pogacar are in two of the most luxurious hotels. Jonic is in the Sacher, behind the opera.\n\nAbout 150 men have been taken to hospital with typhus. The address of our hotel is the Ilziger, Pelzgasse, 17-XV kvart.\n\nJanuary 19\n\nWe are still at the Hotel Ilzinger. The food is very meagre and the air raids are frequent. We are still waiting to see what will happen to us. We’ve heard various tales. Major Solaric says that before he got on the train at Slavonski Broad, Gen Jonic ordered him to make sure that Gen Radovanovic used another carriage as he did not want Radovanovic in his way. This incident perfectly illustrates Jonic’s character. He’s base, selfish and anti-social.\n\nJanuary 20\n\nWalking around Vienna I see that prices are at pre-war levels. Air raids are frequent. I dreamed of my family.\n\nJanuary 21\n\nWe received news that Major Dusan Dinic has died of his wounds.\n\nToday we exchanged our dinars for German marks at the Lander bank on Mariahilferstrasse. I noticed that Major Petar Martinovic exchanged around 900,000 dinars. When I asked him how he had acquired so much money, he told me he had won it gambling. So all the time we were in Bosnia, all he was doing was thinking about gambling.\n\nThere were other officers who exchanged large amounts of money. I didn’t have a penny but Lt Col Cecevic gave me 3,000 dinars as did Major Lazar Janjic, so I had 6,000 dinars to exchange into marks.\n\nIn Bosnia, I was one of six officers who carried a share of six million dinars in 1,000 dinar notes. This was done so that, if one of us was captured or killed, the full amount would not fall into enemy hands. When I arrived in Vienna I gave the money to the quartermaster, Lt Col Malesevic who, it would appear, gave it all to Gen Jonic.\n\nJanuary 22\n\nNews has come through that there are about 17,000 of our men in Ilirska Bistrica, that Vojvoda Djujic23 and Vojvoda Jevdjevic24 are with them, and that we will be sent there.\n\nVienna’s sudbanhof and the fifth district have been bombed.\n\nIt appears we have been left at the mercy of the Zbor sympathiser Sgt Nikic, who plays some major role in Vienna. We filled in some forms and I stated that it was my intention to join Vojvoda Djujic’s Dinarska Cetnik division.\n\nI don’t feel well. My head aches and I’m exhausted. Miroslav Radosavljevic from Zablace near Cacak is helping me. For that I thank him. My brother officers have no time for me. They’ve got more important tasks.\n\nI’ve learned the address of Dr Dusan Dohcevic, one of my wife’s relatives. He has helped me, as has his brother, Sime. They’ve given me clothes and food but what does it matter when I’m so ill?\n\nNews keeps arriving rom Yugoslavia. We’ve heard that Col Hudina and Major Alexei Nedeljkovic of the 51st class (military academy) have been executed in Belgrade.\n\nJanuary 23\n\nI’m so ill I can hardly move. There’s no warm room where I can rest and I’m dragging myself about the streets, freezing. At 4pm I went to see Dusan. We talked a lot. He advised me not to leave Vienna, but to stay with him and Sime. One night, a year or so ago, the two of them were picked up by the Germans but now they can go as they please.\n\nJanuary 24\n\nI’ve been ill all day and I’ve felt faint too. I’ve been out all day. They’re talking about moving us to various hotels. In fact, almost all my colleagues have found somewhere to stay. As I’m ill, I’ve been left in this cursed hostel. The healthy have taken care of themselves and nobody cares about the rest of us.\n\nI visited my classmate Radmilo Dragic at his hotel, the West End, Fugergasse, room 27.\n\nSolaric says Jonic has ordered him to get rubber stamps in German to help get the men moved from the school to better premises, to get clothes and underwear for the men, coupons for the officers, to distribute soap and cigarettes, and to get passports for the officers.\n\nJanuary 25\n\nThey still haven’t decided what to do with us. I feel much worse but nobody cares.\n\nJanuary 26\n\nI got up at 8am. I still don’t feel well and my temperature is high. Had my first shave for four days. I’ve spent the day sitting by the fire in a café, shivering. I wanted to lie down but there isn’t anywhere. I’ve been thinking about my family.\n\nJanuary 27\n\nMy health remains poor and my temperature is 103.1F. Saw Sime Dohcevic and he gave me some more food and clothing.\n\nMajor Solaric says Jonic has told him we’re staying in Vienna to become the nucleus of a future Yugoslav army. Jonic’s fantasy force is to consist of prisoners of war. When it is assembled we will attack Yugoslavia under Jonic’s command. Nice idea from a little general whose malice and imagination know no bounds. The poor man is in his hotel room, unseen.\n\nJanuary 28\n\nLife’s very tough. I’m alone and nobody cares. Everyone’s got more important things to do.\n\nJanuary 29\n\nToday has been the worst. I had to be out of the hotel from 8am to 7pm. I went to see Dragic and managed to rest a little.\n\nJanuary 30\n\nI visited Major Martinovic at the Hotel Fux. I met a Russian lady who asked me what was the matter. I replied that I hadn’t been well for days and had a high temperature. She immediately found me a room in the same hotel — no 49 — and brought a female Serb doctor who gave me some medicine.\n\nThe Russian woman is known as Madame Mirit — her pen name when she wrote for the women’s paper which used to be published in Belgrade. She put compresses on my head and brought my rags from the Ilzinger.\n\nJanuary 31\n\nMme Mirit took me to a basement room. She wrapped me in blankets and left me there until the evening.\n\nFebruary 1\n\nMme Mirit is looking after me and buying medicine for me.\n\nFebruary 2-5\n\nStill in bed in the hotel.\n\nFebruary 6\n\nCrisis. They called a German doctor who said I must go to hospital. I was taken to the 8th reserve hospital, Rez Kazaret Villa 2/XV, Savoyenstrasse. There, they gave me a haircut and shaved off all my bodily hair. They bathed me in a white liquid and massaged me with brushes. Afterwards, they put me in a long, white shirt and took me by lift to the top floor where there put me in bed in a room big enough to accommodate 20 to 30 patients. A nurse brought me some tea and I drank it before falling asleep.\n\nFebruary 7\n\nI slept well. My temperature has returned to normal but I’m exhausted.\n\nFebruary 8-10\n\nIn hospital.\n\nFebruary 11\n\nReceived an injection in my left leg.\n\nFebruary 12\n\nThey’ve given me pyjamas and some toiletries. I can now wash and look after myself.\n\nFebruary 13\n\nI’ve been moved into a room where there is a number of our officers: Major Anastasijevic, Capt Mihic, Capt Vranjesevic, Capt Markovic, Capt Stole Mihailovic, Lt Mrkalj, Lt Rajic, Lt Majdar, Dr Roth and a Russian, Dr Stojanov.\n\nThe poorliest man is Capt Nikola Markovic — Melezija. He is being treated by Dr Schmidt, who has spent a lot of time with him night and day. They’ve been feeding him through a vein and it looks like he’ll pull through.\n\nI’m getting better. My temperature is 98.6F but my pulse remains 60, which is worrying me a little. There’s a lot of bombing but they haven’t moved us out of our room and the nurses have stayed with us. However, they’ve taken patients from the upper floors and moved them nearer the ground.\n\nCapt Danilovic, who’s in another room here, has been to see me. He’s being taken out of Vienna to convalesce.\n\nFebruary 15\n\nI feel a lot better and my pulse is improving. Today it’s 84. I dreamed about my mother and my brother Nedeljko. More bombing.\n\nThe food is good: black coffee, three pieces of bread and butter, wine, apple juice, stewed plums, salami, moussaka, beetroot and soup with rice in. In the afternoon we had black coffee, bread and butter and cheese.\n\nNews has reached us that some people are leaving Vienna of their own accord. Among the first were Major Ristic and Major Solaric.\n\nFebruary 16\n\nI feel well and my appetite is good. The food is excellent and plentiful. We get fed at 8am, 10am, noon, 3pm, 4pm and 6pm. I’ve been told I’m being taken to a hotel 7km from Vienna to convalesce. No air raids.\n\nFebruary 17\n\nSlept well and feel well, and am waiting to be taken to the other hospital. Our menu today: 8am, black coffee with three pieces of bread; 10am, three pieces of bread and honey, butter, apple juice, stewed plums; noon, beef soup, beef, radishes, potatoes, rice pudding and a glass of red wine; 3pm, black coffee, three pieces of bread and two biscuits; 4pm, three pieces of bread and butter and salami; 6pm, some semolina with milk.\n\nReceived a visit from Lt Col Mirko Stankovic. He brought me 400 marks, my share of corps funds, then immediately sold me a pair of army boots for 200 marks. He was also selling cigarettes and other items.\n\nFebruary 18\n\nSnow. They say the Cossacks have taken Sabac and Kragujevac. Air-raid warning at 12.45pm.\n\nFebruary 19\n\nI’m still shaky on my feet. Temperature 98.6F. Pulse 80. Nikola Markovic continues to improve. We never thought he would survive.\n\nFebruary 20\n\nThey’re no longer bothering to take my temperature or pulse. I’ve been given Sympatol for my heart. Today we should have been transferred to a sanatorium but, instead, they’ve taken us to the hospital at the border guards’ barracks. I think it’s got that name because some of our border guards from the 3rd division have been there.\n\nThe place is awful. It’s filthy and infected. We’ve only got one blanket each. When our troops were leaving the hospital they couldn’t find their clothes so they’ve been brought here in their hospital outfits. They took those away when we arrived, leaving them naked.\n\nThere’s about 30 of us. I protested vehemently, screaming at a Todt member. He put me in contact with Gen Jonic, to whom I explained the situation. He told me to go back to that accursed transit point at the Hotel Ilzinger.\n\nFebruary 21\n\nI went to see Gen Jonic again. No sooner had I got through the door than he said: “Please don’t come close, you’ve been suffering from an infectious illness.” He wouldn’t even shake hands. He told me I was to be sent to Postojna and that I would be with Vojvoda Momcilo Djujic’s Dinarska Cetnik Division.\n\nFebruary 22\n\nThere’s talk that a number of regiments are to be formed. I’ve been told that Jonic has named me as commander of some sort of 1st regiment, even though I’ve said many times that I’m going to link up with the Dinarska Cetnik division.\n\nFebruary 23\n\nI’m in an air-raid shelter. It’s a huge, four-storey concrete construction. There’s an anti-aircraft battery on the roof. It’s full of people.\n\nI feel I have to mention the good works of Mme Ruth Mirit once again. She’s an educated Russian woman who once lived in Belgrade. I met her for the first time in the Hotel Fux when I was with Major Petar Martinovic.\n\nAs soon as she saw me she asked me what the matter was. When she realised I was ill she left the room, then returned after half an hour to tell me she had reserved room 49 for me. She took me there and put me in bed. Later she brought a lady doctor who examined me and prescribed medicines which Mme Mirit bought. She nursed me, continually putting compresses on my head. Every morning she took me to a basement room where she put me in a chair and wrapped me with blankets. In the evenings she took me back to my room.\n\nWhen my crisis occurred on February 6 she brought a German doctor who, as I have already described, sent me to the hospital where I stayed until February 20.\n\nI will never forget Mme Mirit. May God keep her and give her strength to survive these events into which fate has thrown us. It makes me remember the words of one of our poets: “We suffer until the end, when we will be worthy of the peace that must come.”\n\nCan we survive without God? I pray to him and will continue to do so because I have a deep belief in the return of freedom and the liberation of our people from the captivity in which they are lightly but securely held.\n\nHow long are we to stay in Vienna? I’ve been to see Gen Jonic again to urge him to do something to resolve the predicament into which he has placed us.\n\nFebruary 24\n\nI visited the command of the Serbian Volunteer Corps25 but saw nobody I knew. I ate dinner in the Hotel Piccolo. Because of the bombing there has been no water or bread for two days.\n\nFebruary 25\n\nNo water. Visited Major Dragic at his hotel and had a bit of a wash there.\n\nFebruary 26\n\nVisited the Serbian Volunteer Corps again, and again applied to join Djujic’s Dinarska Cetnik division. Went to see Gen Jonic again.\n\nFebruary 27\n\nWe’re getting very disturbing reports about the way the Partisans and the Red Army are treating our people. I keep asking myself why the Serbs have to suffer so much. Why are they continually persecuted?\n\nBut I’m not a pessimist. I still believe no one will ever be able to blot out the Serb sun, because in that sun lives the standard carried by the heroes of Kosovo26, the conquerors of Kumanovo27, and the present-day colossus, Gen Draza Mihailovic.\n\nI hate Vienna. The place grates on me. In my soul it makes me hark back to my childhood when I was a citizen of the black and yellow dragon28 whose head was here, in this city.\n\nIn my mind’s eye I can see visions of the persecution that took place during the First World War. I remember the attempts by Austria to make us Uniates29, and other sufferings and oppression inflicted on the Serbs.\n\nEven during this war, the main part of the German forces to have marched across my homeland came from Vienna and its surrounding districts. My heart has been torn to pieces. I’m starting to give up.\n\nFebruary 28\n\nNothing new. Bored, waiting, worrying and hoping.\n\nMarch 1\n\nThere was an air-raid warning as early as 9am. It was back to the shelter and we stayed there until 4pm. A false alarm.\n\nMarch 2\n\nAnother air-raid alert. Spent two hours in the shelter.\n\nMarch 3\n\nNo air-raid warnings. I had to eat without bread because I had no coupons.\n\nMarch 4\n\nSpent another two hours in the shelter but a false alarm.\n\nTook a look at the palaces of the emperors Franz Josef and Karl, city hall and the monuments to Maria Theresa and Goethe. I also visited the mausoleum of the Austro-Hungarian king-emperors which is beneath the Capuchin church. After 29 years I had the opportunity to see the body of Franz Josef.\n\nIn one part of the underground complex is a section featuring a catafalque which contains three coffins. In the middle, above the others, is Franz Josef’s coffin. It is covered with glass and you can see him in his parade uniform. On the left is his wife, the Empress Elisabeth, and on the right his son Rudolph who committed suicide.\n\nThe outing gave me a little rest from my anxieties.\n\nMarch 5\n\nReceived news that we are to leave for Slovenia this week. Air-raid warning at 11pm. Back to the shelter.\n\nMarch 6\n\nHeavy snow fell overnight, Received news that my good friend Dr Zivota Milovanovic had died in the bombing. He was always with his soldiers, caring for them like a young wife for her family. He shared in their privations and watched as they suffered. Often he wasn’t able to help because he didn’t have the medicines or supplies, but he was a hero. While others were spending their days in Vienna amusing themselves, he was caring for the sick and wounded.\n\nMarch 7\n\nIt’s been decided that we leave Vienna on the 9th at 6pm. They say the train carriages won’t have windows, which is disconcerting. It’s cold, too, and there are lots of low-flying aircraft – mosquitoes or ziskari as the people from Lika call them.\n\nI spend all my time thinking about my family. My heart longs for my beloved homeland. I have faith in the resilience of our race because, even though it’s rocked by hardships, war, troubles, sweat and sorrows, it remains strong.\n\nMarch 8\n\nWoke up with pains in my neck. No doubt I slept in the wrong position. There was an air-raid alert from 11am to 3pm. More time spent in that accursed bunker.\n\nMarch 9\n\nToday we should be setting off for Postojna. From what they’ve told us, the train should be leaving at 6.04pm. I’m all set to be at the station on time.\n\nI keep shivering and feeling cold. There’s clearly something else in store for me.\n\nMarch 10\n\nWe left Vienna two hours late at 8 o’clock last night. The carriages are windowless. We arrived in Bruck at 8am and should be leaving for Klagenfurt at 6pm.\n\nI’m not well. My temperature’s going up and I’m feeling faint.\n\nMarch 11\n\nArrived in Jesenice and they immediately herded us into a near-by tunnel, dug into the hillside, to shelter us from air raids. We were there from 8am to 5pm.\n\nI’m continually thirsty and keep drinking water, no doubt because of my high temperature.\n\nWe set off for Ljubljana at 5pm and arrived there at 11pm. The train for Postojna leaves at 3.25am tomorrow.\n\nArriving in Ljubljana reminded me of when I was there seven years ago as a member of technical commission no 3 tasked with fortifying our borders with Italy and Germany. Oh these memories. I’m unable to escape them and all they do is make me feel worse.\n\nReceived some tinned food.\n\nMarch 12\n\nAt 3.25 this morning we left Ljubljana and departed for Postojna. The carriages are warm and comfortable, but this journey has been the most difficult of all.\n\nSomewhere ahead of Vrhnika there was a ruined bridge and we had to change trains. To do so, we had to walk uphill for around 3km. I only just made it. All the fit men rushed off for the best places and those of us who are ill were left to fend for ourselves. If it hadn’t been for one of our workers, who was going to Postojna to join the Serbian Volunteer Corps, I would never have got to the second train. He virtually carried me. As a token of thanks I gave him my little bag of food.\n\nWe hadn’t gone more than a few kilometres and we had to board a third train. Then there was a mine on the line between Planina and Rakek and we had to wait until it was removed. As we did so, Mrs Nada Stanic, one of Vojvoda Djujic’s couriers, came into the carriage. I knew her from when she had visited Belgrade at the start of summer in 1944. She gave me the first news of my family. My brother Nedeljko has got married.\n\nI remember I gave her a 1:10,000 map of Tromedje and the surrounding area. I didn’t recognise her straight away but she knew me. I was huddled in a corner, wrapped in a blanket. She gave me a piece of chocolate and said she would take me to the Dinarska division’s hospital at Gorica where Dr Deze is in charge.\n\nArrived in Postojna at 11am and were greeted by Gen Kosta Musicki30. The senior officers were sent to the school of administration at Sveti Peter. I reported sick and the doctor told me I have flu. He sent me to the Volunteer hospital at Logatec.\n\nI was taken back to the station in a horse-drawn carriage. With me were two nurses who helped me on to the train and found me a place. We left at 5pm and reached Logatec an hour later. There was another carriage waiting and they took me to hospital. It is primitive but warm. As we arrived in Postojna it was hit by a number of bombs dropped by Allied planes.\n\nMarch 13\n\nI spent the night in the reception area. In the morning I was examined by Capt Barac, an old acquaintance of mine. He told me I have an inflamed right lung but added that he has no medicines. He then told the medics to take me to the room where Dr Bata died yesterday.\n\nThe room is about 3m by 5m and has a bunk bed. I was put in the lower bunk. The upper one is empty. Thanks to a small fire the room is warm. I am being looked after by two girl students.\n\nIn the afternoon Dr Barac cheered me up when he said he had found a drug — Eleudron. He told the nurses to give me two tablets every two hours for 28 hours. My spirits lifted at once.\n\nMarch 14 – 17\n\nI’m in bed and the days are going by. I can hardly breathe but I’m taking my medicine and slowly starting to feel better.\n\nMarch 18\n\nGot five eggs at a cost of 19 lira per egg.\n\nMarch 20\n\nThere was no wood until this evening so I had to lie in a cold room.\n\nMarch 21\n\nI’m getting better and the doctor has told me that in a couple of days’ time I’ll be able to get up between 11am and 1pm.\n\nWe keep hearing that Germany wants peace and I keep reading news that suggests things are improving for us. That’s making me feel better.\n\nThe Garibaldi division has retreated into Italy, Tito’s troops have had to leave Albania and the USA is beginning to show great interest in what’s happening in Romania.\n\nCapt Ristic brought me another ten eggs.\n\nMarch 22\n\nI’m feeling better and waiting for the doctor to give me permission to get up.\n\nBombs are being dropped somewhere near by and I can hear terrible explosions.\n\nI’ve read an article by Dimitrije Ljotic in which he says he believes Allied landings will take place soon in Istria.\n\nI’ve been allowed to get up. I spent about 30 minutes in the sun and watched Allied planes flying south, returning from their missions.\n\nMarch 23\n\nHad my first shave in 15 days. On the whole I feel well. I’ve been for a short walk.\n\nThe news is that the Germans and Domobrans have surrounded the Partisans near Gorica.\n\nWe can hear explosions and it sounds like an exchange of artillery fire is taking place somewhere in the distance.\n\nMarch 24\n\nThe USA is said to be showing an interest in the countries occupied by the Russians.\n\nI bought 250g of butter for which I paid 200 lira. That leaves me with about 200 lira from the 3,000 I had to begin with. Sgt Ceda Miskovic brought me five potatoes. We cooked them on the stove and chatted. About 3pm Postojna came under mortar and machine gun fire.\n\nMarch 25\n\nI feel well. It’s a fine day — real spring weather and the surrounding countryside looks beautiful bathed in sunshine and covered with flowers.\n\nAllied planes have been dropping leaflets urging the Germans to lay down their arms.\n\nMarch 26\n\nI’m feeling better. It’s cloudy and that only serves to make me feel more unsettled. There’s a big difference in the weather from yesterday.\n\nIt been decided that Istria should be cleared of Partisans.\n\nMarch 27\n\nMy pulse is between 69 and 74. My temperature is 98.24F. The regiment of Ljuba Jovanovic-Patak and Lt Col Sinisa Pazarac has arrived in Postojna.\n\nMarch 29\n\nMajor news! Draza, Ljotic and Gen Rupnik31 have reached an agreement. A Yugoslav army is to be formed under the command of Draza Mihailovic. They’re also working to form a government and to call back the king.\n\nMarch 30\n\nThe mosquitoes have been flying since early morning attacking anything that moves. I’ve been mulling over whether I should stay in Sempeter, recuperate a little and then join Djujic.\n\nMarch 31\n\nThe nurses tried to make some bread from barley flour. It didn’t really work, but it tasted good anyway. The doctor has told me I’ll be discharged on April 2. That news has cheered me up a lot.\n\nApril 2\n\nToday I should have gone to Postojna but there’s no transport. The railway line has been bombed and there are no carriages for us. We must wait until tomorrow. The mosquitoes remain active.\n\nI’m killing time by listening to the radio — Belgrade, London and Vienna. There’s talk of the fighting alongside Mihailovic. Some support him. The Archbishop of Canterbury (Geoffrey Fisher) has spoken about what the world should be like after the war.\n\nApril 3\n\nGot up at 4.15am to be ready to travel the 19km to Postojna. In Planina I met Bosko Nedic and his wife Gina. My place in Sveti Peter is terrible. There’s no water, no toilet and it’s cold. There’s nothing for sale in the village.\n\nApril 4\n\nToday I attended a sort of administrative school. It’s the idea of the Zbor people who want to make us into future local government functionaries. They’re re-educating us.\n\nI’m not staying here. These people aren’t for me.\n\nApril 5\n\nToday it’s six months since we left our hearths in beautiful Belgrade. Despite everything that’s happened, we still believe we’ll go back some day.\n\nI’m staying in an old building by the railway station which is, as I’ve said, lacking the basic amenities — running water and a toilet. Today we got some metal bedsteads and straw mattresses.\n\nWe visited Radovanj?, ten minutes from Sv Peter, where we were given lessons in a café. We were fed there too.\n\nA train carrying munitions was bombed at a near-by station and the explosions were colossal.\n\nThe only thing people are asking for in terms of food is sugar.\n\nFrom Sempeter you can see the snow-capped peaks of the Pivka mountains.\n\nApril 6\n\nIt’s four years since the Germans attacked Belgrade and invaded Yugoslavia. I can remember the bombing of Skoplje. As our house was badly damaged we sheltered in Dimitrije Dohcevic’s vineyard and spent the night there.\n\nI’ve received a record of the officers who died when the VIC prisoner-of-war camp in Osnabruck was bombed. I know some of them: Lt Col Voja Maksimovic, my commanding officer from my days with the 21st independent artillery division in Subotica; my classmate, Capt Dusan Tripkovic; and my friend Capt Mirko Baljaka (49th class) who was from Zadar.\n\nAltogether, 90 men died. May God have mercy on them.\n\nApril 7\n\nDuring the night the Germans brought a heavy battery to the railway station, not far from the building in which we’re staying.\n\nApril 8\n\nIt’s got colder and a strong wind is blowing. It’s being said that our families have been interned and are being made to work.\n\nWe’ve received another bombshell. It’s being said that Gen Petar Zivkovic and 20,000 men are to land at Dubrovnik.\n\nApril 9\n\nUp at 5am. We have moved to a new building in a small town/village. With me in my room are Lt Col Petar Stankovic, Lt Col Mija Tojic, and Major Zivodin Ivanovic. The room is comfortable and sunny.\n\nWe’ve heard Sinisa Pazarac is with the American 5th army, from where he contacted us.\n\nI’ve noticed a curious fact — there are men among us who don’t seem to care about their families. All they are looking for is fun and enjoyment. Strange men. Their feelings are stranger still.\n\nApril 10\n\nThe 2nd, 3rd and 4th regiments of the Serbian Volunteer Corps have today gone in search of Pavle Djurisic. These units are full of men from the Serbian Shock Corps of the Royal Yugoslav Army in the Homeland. Gen Jonic has failed to take care of our men and handed them to the SDK.\n\nApril 11\n\nNothing of importance.\n\nApril 12\n\nPlanes have been very active today. The Partisans attacked the Volunteers near Planina but I don’t know the outcome of the battle. It took place around 11am.\n\nApril 14\n\nMore aircraft. We’ve heard that there have been anti-Tito demonstrations in Rome and that a bomb was found in the building where Tito’s legation was staying.\n\nApril 15\n\nLast night, around 8, Major Stoja Matovic gave me the lovely news that my entire family had been killed in the bombing of Belgrade. He didn’t tell me how he came by this information which, in any case, I don’t believe.\n\nToday, 400 of our men have arrived in Postojna from Vienna. They made the journey largely on foot, another example of Gen Jonic’s good organisation. The Volunteer regiments that went to find Vojvoda Pavle Djurisic have been successful in battle, we are told.\n\nCol Brana Zivkovic is joining the Dinarska Cetnik division as an instructor and Col Branko Malesevic as quartermaster.\n\nApril 16\n\nIt’s a year since Belgrade was bombed by the RAF and the Americans.\n\nThe news is that the Volunteers have met up with the Croat Domobran near Susak, and that the 3rd Volunteer Regiment has received three air drops. The Dinarska division received two.\n\nApril 17\n\nPostojna was bombed and there was damage. I sent a letter to Vojvoda Djujic via Col Brana Zivkovic, notifying him that I would be coming to join him and the Dinarska Cetnik division.\n\nApril 18\n\nThe weather is terrible. It’s cold with strong winds. At 8am Allied planes bombed a German train in the station at Sv Peter. The resulting fire raged for two hours, punctuated by explosions that rocked the village. Postojna again came under machine gun fire.\n\nApril 19\n\nI went to Postojna for written orders allowing me to depart for Gorica, but I found no one. They had all gone to welcome Patriarch Gavrilo and Bishop Nikolai Velimirovic.\n\nApril 20\n\nThe Germans used their 220mm gun to fire towards Rijeka. It’s on rails and is hidden in a cave near the station at Sv Peter. It fired 21 shells. This morning Sv Peter was bombed and some empty barracks were flattened.\n\nApril 21\n\nAbout 400 Ustase were brought through Sv Peter, all of them disarmed by Djujic’s Cetniks.\n\nI again visited Postojna to get the orders allowing me to go to Gorica. I can’t wait to leave and I’m hoping I’ll find my brother Nedeljko there as he’s in the Dinarska Cetnik division. I’m also looking forward to meeting other men that I know.\n\nThe planes have been active. Looks like they’ve been searching for that German gun.\n\nApril 22\n\nThe gun was in action again tonight, firing in the same direction.\n\nApril 23\n\nAt 12.15 this morning I got on a train bound for Trieste, but we didn’t leave until 2.15. We reached Trieste at about 11.30am. We travelled well and weren’t attacked. With me was my classmate Radmilo Dragic. On arrival we were given room 17 in the Hotel Rasencio and food for two days.\n\nApril 24\n\nAir-raid alert from 2am to 5pm. We spent the time in a shelter carved into the hillside like a gallery.\n\nLooking at Trieste took me back 23 years as the streets and especially the dialect remind me of Zadar where I spent my childhood.\n\nI visited the offices of the Dinarska Cetnik division, and to my great surprise found that my classmate, Capt Kosta Kapetanovic, was in charge. It was so good to see him again. While I was with him, Gen Jonic suddenly appeared. He pretended to be pleased to see me, came over, and asked me to pass his regards to Vojvoda Djujic. He then praised Djujic’s division.\n\nEven from a distance this Jonic looked nothing like the one from Zavidovici, Slavonski Brod and Vienna. He’s become very humble. You might even say lost. He’s allowed the Serbian Shock Corps to fall apart, abandoned its men to their fate, and now spends his time alone in Trieste. Good God how men change. It’s true what they say, those who fly high fall low.\n\nI visited the hill of San Giusto. There is an old church there and, in front of it, a monument to the Italian soldiers who died in the First World War, and to Gen Armando Diaz, who is famous because he managed to repulse the Austrians in the Piave.\n\nI can remember the song they used to sing:\n\nIl Piave mormorava, Calmo e placido al passaggio, Del primi fanti il 24 Maggio. Ma il Piave mormoro! Ritorna lo straniero.\n\nThe Piave whispers, calm and placid as the first infantry crosses on May 24. But the Piave murmurs, the stranger will return.\n\nThe view from the top of the hill is spectacular. You can see Miramar Castle where the Archduke Franz Ferdinand — who was assassinated in Sarajevo on Vidovdan33 1914 — use to holiday.\n\nWe have received news that Dimitrije Ljotic has been killed in a car crash.\n\nAt dinnertime I was with my friend Lt Col Milovan Dj Popovic.\n\nThank God I am leaving for Gorica today. At 3.45pm I boarded a no 6 tram in the Via Miramare and headed into town. There were many soldiers, but even more civilians, all retreating from the communists and their crimes.\n\nI reported to the duty gendarme who took me into an office to issue my papers. In the meantime a car left for Gorica without me. I waited until 5.30pm when a lorry arrived which took me to Monfalcone, and on to Sagrado. There I saw the River Isonzo — where lances were broken in the First World War battle — for the first time.\n\nFrom Sagrado I travelled onward in some sort of luxury car and we reached Gorica at 7pm. From there I went on foot to the Dinarska Cetnik Division HQ which is at the village of Sempeter. My initial impressions are good. The place is much better than Sv Peter at Krs. It’s quiet. The fields are lush and the trees are in full bloom. I’ve been assigned accommodation at a field hospital.\n\nApril 26\n\nThe day is fine and sunny. I reported to the divisional HQ after breakfast. The vojvoda wasn’t there so I spoke to the chief of staff, my classmate, Capt Miodrag Kapetanovic. He has invited me to be chief of the operations, pending the vojvoda’s agreement.\n\nI’ve been given accommodation with Col Brana Zivkovic and Lt Col Branko Malesevic.\n\nApril 27\n\nI’m sitting in the divisional commander’s office, HQ having been moved to a building in a hollow north of Gorica. News has arrived that Mussolini has been captured.\n\nThere has been fighting near the River Vipava. According to reports, 120 Partisans have been killed and 60 taken prisoner.\n\nApril 28\n\nPalm Sunday. My thoughts go to the days of not so long ago when this was celebrated as a children’s day.\n\nApril 29\n\nThe vojvoda has returned but refuses to see me. He sent a message via Lt Jovica Ljubojevic that I should stay with Col Zivkovic.\n\nBesides Zivkovic and Malesevic I’ve also found Petko Lakovic and Lt Pavle Markovic of the gendarmerie. I’ve been visited by Capt Bogdan Drobac who is a very good officer and friend.\n\nWe’ve heard that the Allied assembly in San Francisco has refused to accept representatives of the Lublin government in Poland.\n\nThe Serbian Volunteer Corps has moved into the Vipava Valley.\n\nThere is much talk of German capitulation. Various stories are doing the rounds about communist advances in Istria.\n\nWe’re preparing to retreat to the Isonzo. We’re leaving at 11pm to spend the might in Mossa.\n\nI hoped I’d find my brother in Gorica but I’ve learned that"
