        "text": "IVAN LJUBICIC, the oldest and one of the wisest players, believes Andy Murray is still a long way behind Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer.\n\nThe 32 year-old Croatian, beaten by Murray on Friday, said: “He is fourth favourite so something tremendous has to happen for him to go through.\n\n“He just needs one breakthrough somewhere at some slam and he will definitely gain confidence and be a challenge for the top three. But at the moment these three guys are too far [ahead] for all of us.”\n\nLjubicic expects the pressure on Murray to keep on building through to tomorrow when he faces Richard Gasquet in the fourth round.\n\nThe Frenchman is back to his best after missing Wimbledon last year through injury and in 2009 when suspended for two and a half months after failing a drugs test.\n\n“Gasquet is going to be another big test and if Andy manages to get through that then he will probably start feeling he is playing for something big,” said Ljubicic.\n\n“So we’ll see, but it’s not even halfway. It’s still a long 10 days for him.”"
