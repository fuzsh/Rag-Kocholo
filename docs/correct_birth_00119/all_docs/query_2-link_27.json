        "text": "© by Darko Zubrinic, Zagreb (1995)\n\nThe earliest known description of a sporting event in Croatia is from the 16th century. It reffered to the 1593 regatta of seventy four (yes, 74) wooden fishing boats called falkusa, from the harbour of the town of Komiza on the island of Vis to the islet of Palagruza. It was the oldest known boat race in Europe. Falkusa is autochthonous Croatian boat of 9m of length, with the mast of equal size, in use from 11th or 12th century until the middle of the 20th century. A crew was composed of five rowers, and the marathon covered 42 miles, for which about five to fifteen hours of continuous and exhausting rowing was necessary, depending on weather conditions.\n\nFalkusa, autochthonous Croatian boat from the town of Komiza, island of Vis\n\nThe very start of the marathon of the armada was announced by a cannon from the Renaissance tower in the Komiza harbour early in the morning of 20th May. One can imagine the foam raised by 74 boats and 370 rows in the harbour! The description of this interesting event is kept in the Liber Comissiae in the parish of the town of Vis on the island of Vis. In 1998 falkusa was included into the UNESCO World Heritage List. See Prvi zapis o Palagurskoj regati (in Croatian), Gajeta Falkusa, Vis (in Polish), The Falkusa.\n\nA Croatian falkusa sailed from Komiza to Lisabon to be exhibited at EXPO'98, where Croatia was the greatest surprise.

(English edition in prepration)\n\nThe next earliest known description of a sporting event in Croatia is from the 18th century (1764). It referred to the regatta of two fishing boats representing the cities of Split and Makarska, from an islet near Milna on the island of Brac to the Split harbour. It was the Makarska boat that triumphed!\n\nOne of truly fascinating exploits in which Croatian mariners participated is related to ARCTIC EXPEDITION in 1872-1874, organized by the then Austrian-Hungarian Empire. The Croats at that time had the status of Kingdom within the Empire.\n\nThe first gymnastics textbook in Croatian language was published in Zagreb, 1879, by August Löffler (entitled Gimnastika za učitelje pučkih učiona i učiteljske pripravnike, 154 pp). Born in Czechia in 1832 (in Jindřichův Hradec), he arrived to Rakovac (now a part of the city of Karlovac) in 1870. He was one of the teachers of Nikola Tesla during his schooling in Croatia, at the Higher Real School in Rakovac (now Gymnasium in Karlovac).\n\nIn 1898, at the age of 27, Croatian explorer Mirko Seljan walked 2800 km from St. Petersburg (Russia) to Paris (France), in just 110 days. In this way, he earned the title Champion Globetrotter. However, the greatest Croatian globetrotter (and probably of entire History) was Josip (Joe, Joseph) Mikulec.\n\nThe first international football (soccer) match where Croatia participated with its national name had been held in 1907 (with Czechia). The Croatian Sporting Union was founded in Zagreb in 1909. In 1911 the Croatian representation participated under its flag (and with its national name) on the European championship in Torino. In 1912 Franjo Gregl was the European champion in bicycling.\n\nMarijan Matijevic in 1899, at the age of 21.\n\nMany thanks to Andreja Malovoz, Zupanja, for her kind help.\n\nOutstanding Croatian wrestler (\"Junak iz Like\" - Hero from Lika) was Marijan Matijevic (1878-1951). Matijevic traveled throughout the world to exhibit his extraordinary physical power (bending metal rods, stone breaking), including China and Japan. He is known to have surpassed Primo Carnera from Italy. Buried in the town of Zupanja near Danube. He is known for his numerous humanitarian public performances. Matijevic was enormously popular, which can be seen from thousands of articles published throughout the world in English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Arabian, Turkish, Chinese, Japanese and other languages. Once in the USA, when he was once introduced as an \"Austrian athlete\", he hastened to correct the announcer: \"Dear gentlemen, I am not Austrian, I am Croatian born in proud Lika...\".\n\nAmong plenty of his decorations and medals let us mention that the last Turkish sultan Abdul Hamid V decorated him in person in Ankara with the medal of the Great Turkish Star in 1904 (on the above photo, source lickisamson.blog.hr), as the winner of the World championship in wrestling in Constantinople.\n\nMarijan Matijević met Nikola Tesla in New York in 1921, and on that occasion he\n\nfinancially supported Tesla's experiments. Both Tesla and Matijević originate\n\nfrom the same part of Croatia, called Lika, north of the mountain of Velebit.\n\nReference\n\nStjepan Tomić: S Herkulom zlatna srca / Marijan Matijević - \"Junak iz Like\", Hrvatski crveni križ, Vinkovci 2003.

Since there were only nine of the Englishmen who came to Croatia several years before, they invited local boys to join them. In 1914, professional coaches from England came to Croatia. James Donelly and Arthur Gaskhell, who were the coaches in \"Gradjanski\" club in Zagreb that in 1936 defeated famous Liverpool with the result of 5:1, are certainly worth mentioning.\n\nThe oldest Croatian soccer club is Bačka, founded in Subotica in Bačka in 1901, playing in the then Croatian league. It is also the oldest soccer club in this part of Europe.\n\nBacska, i.e., Bačka football club in Subotica, founded in 1901.\n\nAs we can see, it was decorated by Croatian Coat of Arms.\n\nThis photo is appearing on the cover page of [Dražen Prčić] and on nogomet.lzmk.hr.\n\nNikola Matkovic (1864-1946), living in Subotica, was a very successful athlete in the then Austria-Hungary. When the Subotica Gymnastic Society (Suboticko gimnasticko drustvo) competed in Belgrade in 1900, they won the first prizes in all disciplines. Furthermore, the newspapers reported that \"...the Subotica sportsmen demonstrated in Belgrade the new game called Football, until then unknown in that city...\" One of Matkovic's pupils was Djuro Stantic, the world champion in walking on 75 km, in Berlin 1905.\n\nSee Ante Zomborovic: Nikola Matkovic prvi Hrvat-Bunjevac skolovani ucitelj tjelesnog odgoja, Suboticka Danica (nova), Kalendar za 2004, Subotica 2003, pp 192-194. Beginnings of soccer in Croatia by Croatian Football Federation.\n\nThe Documentary film \"Toronto Croatia - Great Croatian Story...\", from Screenwriter Hrvoje Hitrec, Director Jakov Sedlar and Producer Josip Pavicic captures and for the first time presents the great and unrepeatable Historical documentation. All important witnesses of these Historical accomplishments of Eusebio, Grnja, Bradvic, Bilic, Kenfelja, Ante Pavlovic, Simunic, Suker, Niko Kovac as well as Robert Iarusci, Bruce Thomas and Ante Pavelic testify to this unified and unique team. In 1976 Toronto Croatia won the Continental Championship with as many as 20 consecutive wins and became the champion of the North American League.\n\nPicture in possession of Dr. Ante Cuvalo, Chicago\n\nA detail on his breast: Croatian Coat of Arms\n\nCroatian adventurer Josip (Joseph) Mikulec set out to circumnavigate the globe on foot in the span of five years. With the start of this journey he became a perpetual wanderer. Mostly hiking, he traveled the world some 28 years and achieved a degree of fame for having collected more than 30,000 autographs of world-famous people. He was also called hyperpedestrian.\n\nAnother Croatian hyperpedestrian was Mate Šimunović (visiting about 70 countries), about who a very interesting monograph was published (in Croatian):\n\nStipe Božić i Drago Glamuzina (eds.): Mate Šimunović Ja, Mate Svjetski (Summary), Zagreb 2013.

The soccer club was a part of the Club Atletico Fiumano, and La Guardia served as American consul in Rijeka in 1904-1906. He was the greatest mayor in the history of New York.\n\nLaGuardia Airport in New York is named after him.

At the age of 20, he won the United States Championship for professional Black boxers, while the next year he won the Colored Championship of the World (light heavyweight). While he lived in Vienna, Austria, he met a woman of Croat descent, Roza, whom he married. The couple moved to Zagreb, Croatia in the early 1930s. There, he opened his boxing school in Ilica street. At the age of 33, he ended his career as boxer. He trained many young boxers in several boxing clubs in Zagreb, starting with boxing club Croatia, and later with clubs Herkules, Makabi and Radnik. After a while, he became a friend with a neighboring tavern owner. He gave him his warehouse in Preradovićeva as a training hall.\n\nJimmy Lyggett as a trainer of Croatian boxers in Zagreb. Source of the photo.\n\nWhen the Independent State of Croatia was formed, its Minister of Sports, Miško Zebić talked Lyggett into training the Croatian national boxing team. He prepared the Croatian team for the cancelled 1940 Olympics. Despite his race, Lyggett was not interfered with by the Axis allied government of Croatia.\n\nJimmy Lyggett on the right and Mijo Drvarić in the middle, champion of Croatia and ex Yu (in 1940).\n\nLyggett was an anti-Communist. Before the end of the war, his brother invited him to return to the US. Finally he accepted the invitation and convinced his wife to move to the US. In 1945, they set off for the US via Italy. They waited for months the ship that would take them to United States. His wife got ill and died in Milan. Broken, Lyggett returned to America alone. His death place and death date are unclear. Some sources say that he died in US in 1955. In Croatia, among his friends he had a nickname \"glista\" (worm). Source of this text and more information at Wikipedia (and in Croatian). A film about Jimmy Lyggetty has been shot by Oktavijan Miletić. See 2 min. video about Lyggett in Croatia. Many thanks to Mr Tomislav Nürnberger, Zagreb, for his kind information about Jimmy Lyggett.\n\nRudolph Matz (1901-1988), a famous cello player and music educator, professor at the University of Zagreb, was a top Croatian sportsman. As a sprinter he won the first place in the Prague in 1921, beating also German sprinters. He was a record holder in Croatia on 100 (for 11 years!), 200, 4x100, and 400 m. He stressed that the work of a music educator is similar to that of a trainer.\n\nLit. Zrinka Jelčić: Veliki opus vedrine / Rudolf Matz, Muzej Grada Zagreba, Zagreb 2017.\n\nFranjo Mihalic (1921) started his active sporting career in the period of the Independent State of Croatia (1941-1945), and after 1945 had to move to Belgrade, together with many other best Croatian sportsmen. He won a silver medal in Marathon at the Olympic Games in Melbourne (1956); he was the winner of the International races in Sao Paulo (1952, 1954), as well as Marathon races in Tokyo, Moscow, Boston, Athens, Cross de Nations in Paris (1950-1961).\n\nNikolina Sustic Stankovic of Croatia ultramarathon world champion in 2018 (100 km!)\n\nWe should remember also Fritzie Zivic (originally Zivchich, 1913-1984), known as The Croat Comet, famous welterweight boxer in the USA, who had 230 professional matches. In 1940 he won the title of the champion of the world having defeated \"unbeatable\" Henry Armstrong. Their rematch held in Madison Square Garden in 1941, where Fritzie managed to defend his title, was visited by 23,190 people (and 5,000 fans were reportedly denied access). This remains all-time highest Garden record for attendance. In 1993 entered the \"International Boxing Hall of Fame\".

He was the first dominant \"big man\" in NBA, known as the \"Gentle Giant\" (208 cm, or 6 feet 10 inches). He was also one of the most effective scorers of his time, averaging 22.6 points per game over his nine years long professional career, with the then record of 11,764 points. The Associated Press voted Mikan the greatest basketball player of the first half of the 20th century. When Mikan's LA Lakers came to Madison Square Garden, the marquee simply advertized \"Tonight George Mikan versus the Knicks!\". How basketball was played at that time, is indicated by the following: he lost four teeth (in his first professional game), had two broken legs, three broken fingers, broken wrist, broken nose and dozens of stitches. Even some NBA rules have been changed because of his superiority. George Mikan was named one of the NBA's 50 Greatest Players in 1996 (on the occasion of 50 years of NBA), played four NBA all-star games, and is in the Basketball Hall of Fame. For additional information see the Vladimir Novak web page.\n\nSandy Cecere, 2005: We have fond memories of George Mikan in my family. He was a towering man with a big heart, and a faith in God that carried him through many rough times. He needed a special car so that he could fit into it. When he came to visit at our house he had to duck to get into our house, and into our car, and garage. My father, a dear friend of George was 5'8 inches tall, and George was 6'7\" tall. When the two stood next to one another, they were the true mutt and Jeff. George was a man of great faith, and I know that Sam and George are in heaven practicing law together, and talking about their love of sports. I will always remember George Mikans smile and what a great friend he was to my dad. When my dad was dying, Dad didn't want to see anyone, but George didn't care, he came into the hospital to see his friend Sam, and I remember my father's eyes lighting up, and that my Dad felt good enough that day to have a long conversation with his friend George. In my family we were taught to always call our elders, Mr and Mrs., so I did. When I was in my 30's George told me to call him George. I told him I just didn't think I could do that. He laughed and made me!! His nickname for me was \"the favorite one\". I will always remember him.\n\nPerica Vlasic (1932-2004), a famous Croatian rower, was european champion in skiff in 1953 in Copenhagen. He could row for an unbelievable 58 strokes per minute. This brought him also the world title in skiff at the famous Henley Royal Regatta in London in 1954, and he was presented the gold cup by the English Queen in person, the patron of the regatta. It is funny that, to the amazement of other sportsmen, Vlasic came to the London town just a day before the competition, without his trainer, and without any boat. The boat was lended to him by an English trainer - God bless him.\n\nThe following few interesting lines are based on Sports in Zagreb:\n\nThe famed scientist (biologist) and table tennis player, Professor Zarko Dolinar (1920-2003), who captured eight gold medals at world championship competitions. Dr. Dolinar still holds an unusual world record. He is the only athlete in the world who was a world champion as well as a doctor of science. He was former World Doubles Champion and had a prestigious position of ITTF (International Table Tennis Federation) Sports Science Committee head. It is interesting that he taught John Lennon to play table tennis (information by Nenad Bach). In China he was invited to have dinner with president Mao Tse Tung, together with R. Nixon, president of the USA (information by Nenad Bach). Except of being university professor in Zagreb and in Basel, he also had the title of one of Croatian Righteous among the nations.\n\nStudents of Zagreb University founded the first sports society in Zagreb called \"HASK\" - the Croatian Academic Sports Club, already in 1903. It is little known that our eminent chemist and recipient of the Nobel Price for chemistry in 1975, Vladimir Prelog, was a \"HASK\" athlete and the first Croatian champion in the modern pentathlon in 1923!\n\nOn the background of this web-page is Nenad Bach's song Can We Go Higher?, or We Will Win (on a Wild World Web), accompanied by the sound of Croatian tamburitza (Blue Adriatic - Plavi Jadran, from San Francisco).\n\nFamous Croatian baseball players in the USA:\n\nRoger Maris (1934-1985), major league baseball player, was born in Hibbing, Minnesota the son of first generation Croatian Americans.

Even more interesting is that this record was unbeaten for as long as 13 years, see History for kids, Utah, USA. In 1985 the Long Beach City Council named a park in his memory, Gabelich Park (near San Pedro and Los Angeles).\n\nAmong the most outstanding Croatian sportsmen was Dragutin Surbek (table tennis), who had won hundreds of tournaments, from Tokyo and Beijing to Zagreb (37 medals from european and world championships!).

In 1974 he started his professional boxing career. and professional semi heavy-weight professional European champion in 1976, and professional World champion (WBC) in 1978. In his amateur career he had 310 matches with 13 defeats, while in 29 professional matches he had only 3 defeats.\n\nThe oldest Croatian swimming club Victoria was founded in 1908 in the city of Rijeka\n\n(more precisely, in Sušak). It served to high school students.\n\nVeljko Rogosic was named International Long Distance Swimming Federation World Champion four times between 1971 and 1974. He was the first one to have swam the distance of 200 km without interruption. From the town of Grado near Trieste in Italy to Riccone near Ancona he set the world record of 225 km in long distance swimming (during this swim he lost 16 kg).\n\nIn 1992 this outstanding sportsman entered the International Marathon Swimming Hall of Fame, Florida, USA. He was participant of the Homeland War during Greater-Serbian aggression on Croatia and one of the founders of Croatian Marine Corps. Recipient of the Medal of Homeland War from president Franjo Tudjman. His motto and message to young people is\n\nWITH SPORT AGAINST DRUGS\n\nRogosic swam La Manche (45 km) in 2004 at the age of 63! For this he needed 11 hours and 27 minutes. His name was written in the 'Gold book of La Manche' as the first Croatian and the oldest man to do so.\n\nIn the summer 2005 he swam almost 1,000 km along Croatian coast (from Savudrija to Rt Ostro in Konavle) in less than two months, at the age of 64! Also, this is the ultra-marathon swimming world record (880 km in 222 hours, in 57 etapes in less than 58 days).\n\nIn 2008 Rogosic swam 171 km marathon from Sicilia to Africa, and reached Africa's Cape Bon in Tunisia. He started the first marathon from Europe to Africa on his 67th birthday!\n\nDjurdjica Bjedov won the Olympic gold medal in 100 m brestroke swimming during the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, breaking the then Olympic record. She was the first Croatian sportswoman to win an Olympic medal. At the same olympiade Djurdjica also won silver medal in 200 m breaststroke.\n\nHelen Crlenkovich (1921-1955) was one of the most successful athletes in America and the world on the three-meter springboard and the ten-meter platform. She was an American-born Croatian lovingly known as \"Klinky.\" Her best sports years began in the late 1930's. She not only became the best American, but also the world springboard and platform diving champion. She was the first female to do a full-twisting 1 1/2 somersault and several other dives that were heretofore only achieved by men. Helen was chosen to represent America in the 1940 Olympic Games. All concerned felt that Helen would achieve two gold medals as a minimum. However, because of the onset of the Second World War, the games were cancelled. She was also honored by being inducted into the Helms Foundation Diving Hall of Fame in California. In September 2008, Helen received post-mortem recognition by the World Acrobatic Congress held in Las Vegas for her life achievements in swimming and diving. She died very young out of cancer. Her both parents are from Croatia: mother Anka Tomin is from Petrijevci, and father Adam from Banicevac. (Text by dr. Ante Chuvalo, Chicago).\n\nAn interesting note as regards Helen is the fact that her trainer, Phil Patterson, insistently urged this young Croatian-American woman to change her name to something that is \"more suitable.\" He told Helen that with a name like Crlenkovich, she will not achieve any hoped-for success. Nonetheless, Helen, just as insistently, rejected his suggestion because she was proud of her Croatian name and heritage. This fact speaks volumes as to the strength of her character.\n\nIn 1998, in the finals of the European Championship held in Sheffield, England, Milos Milosevic set the new world record in the 50 meter butterfly (23:30), thus beating the world record of the Russian swimmer Denis Pankratov, that many held unbeatable.\n\nMilos Milosevic, world record on 50m butterfly in 1998\n\nMilos is a native of Split, now living and training in Rijeka.\n\nEuropean champion in 2000 in backstroke swimming with 1:58.62 on 200m is Gordan Kozulj.\n\nMirna Jukic, Croatian swimmer in Austria (born in in the town of Vukovar, destroyed during the Greater Serbian aggression on Croatia), was elected the 2002 Sportswoman in Austria for her results in breaststroke swimming.\n\nDuje Draganja won the Olympic silver medal in men's 50m freestyle final, Athens, 2004.\n\nDuje Draganja breaking the world record in 2008 in Manchester.

His professional record is impressive: 79 wins (70 by knockouts), 15 loses, and 2 draws.\n\nExcept being a world class boxer, Chuvalo is known in Canada and in the USA as Anti-Drug Crusader. This engagement came as a result of a personal tragedy: he lost his two sons due to drug overdose, the third one committed suicide, and his wife committed suicide after that. Having remarried, he now tours Canada and the USA, accompanied with his remaining son Steven, giving lectures for pupils, students and parents, and trying to warn people about the danger of drugs.

It's impossible to hear the announcer and a wonder that the players can hear the signals from the referees. This year's event even had an appearance by Elvis. Elvis Fatovic that is.

The first Davis Cup match in Croatia was played in Zagreb in 1927. In the finals of the 1939 Davis Cup match for the European zone, held in Zagreb, the Croatian team defeated the representation of Germany. The players who brought this victory were Franjo Puncec and Dragutin Mitic. This was probably the gratest international success of Croatian sport in the first half of the 20th century. Besides the USA and Australia, by the end of 1930s Croatia had the strongest Davis Cup team in the world. See Povijest tenisa u Hrvatskoj, [PDF].\n\nDragutin Mitic (1917) was a distinguished Croatian tennis player. In 1938 Simone Mathieu (France) and Mitic became the Roland Garros mixed double champions. In 1939, playing with Franjo Puncec, he defeated the German Davis Cup team at the European zone finals in Zagreb. From 1954 until 1965 he worked as a tennis professional in Bogota, capital of Columbia. It is interesting that his photo appears on a Colombia stamp, see below.

Upon her arrival to the Zagreb airport she obtained 1256 roses and custard slices...\n\nIn 2002, at the Winter Olympic Games held in Salt Lake City in the USA, Janica Kostelic became the first Alpine skier to win as many as four Olympic medals at a single Game: three gold medals and one silver. This was a result of many years of painstaking work undertaken already at her tender age by her father Mr. Ante Kostelic and the whole family. As stated by Mr. Kostelic, this success would not have been possible without free Croatia.\n\nAnd Janica's brother, Ivica Kostelic, stunned everybody with his win in the 2001 World Cup slalom in Aspen, Colorado, USA, at the age of 22. He skied out of the 64th position in the first run, then was fastest in the second run to win in 1 minute, 38.81 seconds. It was the latest starting position for a slalom winner in World Cup history and third latest in any event. In December 2008 he secured his ninth career win at the Alta Badia slalom in Italy. Ivica is also known as the best blues and rock guitarist among skiers, and at the same time the best skier among blues and rock guitarists.\n\n1. Ivica Kostelic, Croatia, 1 minute, 38.81 seconds. 2. Giorgio Rocca, Italy, 1:38.93. 3. Mario Matt, Austria, 1:39.00.\n\nIn 2003 Ivica and Janica Kostelic both won the title of world champions in slalom. They became the first siblings to win gold medals in the same event at the world's.\n\nIn 2006 Janica won gold medals in combined event at the Olympic games in Torino, Italy, and silver medal in Super-G. With this achievement (four gold medals and two silver on two Olympic Games) she became\n\nthe most successful skier among women in the history of Olympic Games\n\nthe first alpine skier, male or female, to win four medals at one Olympics.\n\nthe first female alpine skier to win six Olympic medals.\n\nHer brother Ivica won silver olympic medal in men's Alpine skiing combined event.\n\nIn 2010 Ivica won two silver medals for Croatia at the Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver, Canada, one in slalom and another in combined. In 2011 he won a World Cup slalom race in Adelboden, Switzerland.\n\nThe life of the family of Kostelic is unique in the history of skiing sport (and may be in the history of sport in general). When Janica and Ivica were very young, they used to travel with their old Lada (Russian car), and also to sleep and eat in the car. At the same time other children stayed in a hotel, sleeping in their warm beds. Kostelic's were sleeping also in a small mountain tent, sometimes at the temperature reaching -20 degrees Celsius. They were not able to pay for their trainings, so they used to wake up at 4 o'clock in the morning, to wash their faces with snow, and train at dawn (free of charge) with their worn up gloves, while others were still sleeping or having breakfast.\n\nIvica and Janica at the Olympic games in Salt Lake City,\n\nUSA, 2002, photo by Getty Images\n\nIt is well known that skiing is the sport of the rich. When Kostelic's went back home from Austria, Germany, France or Switzerland, several times it happened to them that they had to sell their skies in order to be able to buy petrol for their Lada... And let us not forget, at that time the Greater Serbian aggression was raging throughout Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina (1990-1995). Mr. Ante Kostelic-Gips himself, father of Ivica and Janica, is an amazing Croatian sportsman and trainer, former handball player, working with his children on the long run. He remembers with deep gratitude an Austrian, Mr Willie Arnsteiner, wire-keeper, who donated them 100 Schillings daily during a critical period, and who predicted their great skiing future. At the age of 15 Janica had 22 consecutive wins at European competitions for children during one season. One day after the death of president Franjo Tudjman, Janica was skiing with mourning black armband. Young Kostelic's were raised in deep patriotism, and their sacrifices will always be remembered. Let us also mention a regular short ritual of Christian crossing immediately before every competition. It is amusing to see how \"objective\" European TV media strive to avoid this indicative and important detail.\n\nJanica with her three olympic gold medals\n\nSalt Lake City, USA, 2002\n\nAt the very end of 1999 Janica had a tragic fall: four of her ligaments on the knee out of five were broken. After a very difficult operation and reconstruction of her knee, she had a painstaking program of getting back to normal living. She was able not only to walk again, but also to win on European, World, and Olympic competitions in skiing.\n\nThe human story of Kostelic's is waiting to be written in all details, with a special emphasis on low blows of \"independent\" media. This story is much greater than the story about their sport successes. Ivica and Janica, like many others on this web page, would never have appeared without the advent of free Croatia.\n\nJanica Kostelic,\n\nwinning the 2006 Women Alpine Ski World Cup super-G race\n\nin Bad Kleinkircheheim (photo by Ruters/Calle Teornstroem)\n\nAcadémie des sports, Paris - Le palmarès 2005 ...

Namely, Ivica Kostelić lended him, upon Akira's request, his own pair of skis. On that occasion (World cup men's slalom in Wengen, Switzerland), Akira was placed the 2nd, and Ivica the 3rd.\n\nOtto Lang (1908-2006) founded the first ski school at Mount Rainier (a National Park in the USA) in 1937 and directed Sun Valley's ski school before and after World War II. Then he launched a successful career as a Hollywood filmmaker. He was born in 1908 in the small village of Zenica, Bosnia, to an Austrian father and Croatian mother. One of his best-known pupils was Gretchen Kunigk of Tacoma, who later won an Olympic gold medal for the United States in 1948 under her married name, Gretchen Fraser. \"He was an unbelievable human being,\" said skiing filmmaker and longtime friend Warren Miller. \"He is the last of the old Austrian ski instructors; it is the absolute end of an era.\" Miller also called Lang a \"Renaissance man.\"\n\nJakov Fak, biathlon athlet, wearing the Croatian national flag at the solemn opening of 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver, Canada.\n\nJakov Fak, biathlon athlet.

They were champions of Canada in the period of 1970-1974, and representatives of Canada in the Winter Olympic Games, Munich, 1972 (placed ninth). Sandra Bezic is known as one of the best figure skating choreographers in the world. For many years, Bezic served as producer, director, and choreographer of the touring show Stars on Ice. Sandra Bezic also worked on highly acclaimed \"Carmen on Ice.\" She designed programs for Olympic champions Brian Boitano and Kristi Yamaguchi, and wrote the book The Passion to Skate, which was made into a documentary. Bezic also choreographed the routines of figure skaters Kurt Browning, Josée Chouinard, and Katarina Witt for 1994 Olympics.\n\nEuropean champion Nikolay Pechalov (of Bulgarian origin) won Croatia's Olympic gold medal in weightlifting in men's 62 kilogram class in Sydney in 2000. He set an Olympic Games record of 150 kg in the snatch and lifted 175 kg in the clean and jerk for a combined total of 325 kg, an Olympic record. His principal sponsor was Goran Ivanisevic.\n\nDean Lukin is a famous weigthlifter in Australia. He has Croatian roots: his father Dinko Lukin, a famous tuna farmer in Australia, is from Croatia. In 1984, with the assistance of an Eastern European and USSR boycott of the Los Angeles Games, Dean Lukin won Australia's first weightlifting gold medal at an Olympic Games.\n\nHis win was in the Super Heavyweight category (approximatly 140 kg), and in fact he was the first ever in the history of the sport to do so (snatch 172.5 kg, clean & jerk 240 kg, total 412.5 kg). Dean, a full-time tuna fisherman and part-time weightlifter, had the honour to carry the Australian flag during the closing ceremony of the 1984 Olympic Games.\n\nDean Lukin 1982 Commonwealth Games, YouTube\n\nDean Lukin jerks 227.5kg 1983,YouTube\n\n1985 Dean Lukin 240.5kg Jerk, YouTube\n\nAna Srsen, photo from Hrvatski paraolimpijski odbor\n\nAna Srsen is a top Croatian paraolympic swimmer, very successfuly competing at interanational competitions for disabled.

He was the second European to do so after Messner. See Bozic's beautiful photos at Fotoklub Split. The Croatian Alpine Association (Hrvatski planinarski savez) is among the oldest in the world: it was founded in 1874, the same year as in France. Let us mention by the way that the oldest novel in the world about mountains is Planine (Mountains), written in Croatian by Petar Zoranic in 1536 and printed in Venice in 1569. It is also the oldest Croatian novel. Petar Zoranic, outstanding Croatian Renaissance writer, was born in Zadar in 1508.\n\nFour Croatian female alpinists climbed on Mt Everest (8850 m) in 2009, among them two sisters Darija and Iris Bostjancic, besides Milena Šijan and Ena Vrbek.

Thomas Hyde, an English orientalist from 17th century, travelled through Croatia, and mentioned that the correspondence chess had been played between Croatian and Venetian merchants in 1650, more precisely, beween the Dubrovnik and Venetian merchants. It is the oldest mention of the correspondence chess in history. This fact can be found in his book \"De ludis orientalibus\" (On Eastern Games), published in Latin in 1694.\n\nIn Croatia there are 162 registered players of correspondence chess (30 of them active). Until the advent of computers, chess moves were sent by snail mail, and sometimes one had to wait for a few months for a single move. It is not surprising that such a game could last for several years. Since 1990s the speed of the correspondence chess has been revolutionarized due to the possibilities of electronic communication, and its duration is comparable to that of the \"usual\" chess game. Information by the courtesy of dr. Zvonko Krecak, Croatian physicist, who is the president of the Croatian Correspondence Chess Association (Hrvatska udruga dopisnog saha) since 1987 (continuously till 2010 when these lines are written).\n\nOgnjen Cvitan, Croatian chess grandmaster, earned the International Master title by winning the 1981 World Junior Championship for competitors under the age of 20.\n\nIn Croatia there is a Chess Street, the only one in the world.

The article deals with the Chess Club in the Chess Street in the town of Ravna Gora in Croatia. He wrote: \"It is good that such a street exists, but it is a pity that the street is not in Russia.\"\n\nValentina Golubenko and Ivan Šaric won the titles of world youth chess champions for 2008 in the category up to 18 years, at the competition organized in Vietnam.

He played as a member of chess teams of Vukovar (in exile from 1991 to 1998) and Sarajevo. Upon his request, Gari Kasparov has been granted Croatian citizenship in February 2014.\n\nCroatia has no tradition in hockey. However, one of the greatest hockey players of today is Joe Sakic, Canadian Croat. His both parents are from Croatia (his father is from Imotski, and mother from Lika).
