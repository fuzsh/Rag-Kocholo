        "text": "MARCOS Baghdatis did not ride a rollercoaster yesterday like he did the day after he beat Andy Roddick. It is not that the man who has given this Australian Open a much-needed sense of joie de vivre has lost his appetite for fun. Just that, while some might still think of him as a sideshow attraction, the man from Cyprus is very serious about winning this Australian Open.\n\n\"I believe I can do it, I can finish the two weeks off,\" he says. \"That is my goal. I am here in the semis and I have two matches to go and I believe I can do it.\"\n\nSo having woken at midday yesterday after his five-set quarter-final victory over Ivan Ljubicic, the 20-year-old stayed out of the sight of the public that are now \"like flies coming on you\". He was back in bed by 4pm, hoping his body would get the rest it needed before taking on David Nalbandian. Then he had a light practice session last night.\n\n\"I'm focused on tomorrow's match,\" said Baghdatis. \"I have a chance to go even further so I don't want to waste it. I'm trying to stay in the tournament, trying to win.\"\n\nHaving caused a major boilover against Roddick, then gathered himself to cut down the seventh-seeded Ljubicic in five tough sets, this is the side of Baghdatis we have not seen. He left his small island home aged 14 to live and train in France with strangers.\n\n\"It is tough for a 14-year-old to leave his parents and country and go to a country he doesn't know and doesn't speak the language,\" he said.\n\n\"But the people I stayed with there in Paris, they were great to me, they showed me love. The academy was great, it was tough.\"\n\nFrom that experience, Baghdatis has gained something unusual in the often self-obsessed world of professional tennis — perspective.\n\n\"I learnt life early and I started taking responsibilities early.\" There were more life lessons last year when Baghdatis encountered \"personal problems\", something that momentarily halted the rise of player had been the top junior in the world and a former Australian junior champion. He chose not to elaborate, saying only: \"I had some downs like everyone in life. I went through a lot, but one more time I had my family around me and my coach.\"\n\nThis is the very serious side to the diminutive man with the bandy legs who entertains his legion of chanting fans with an array of eccentric strokes. \"I have the chance,\" he says. \"I just don't want to waste it.\"\n\nSo he is doing his best to block out the distractions which, his father Christos says, come not just from fans ringing his hotel begging for tickets, but from as far away as home where Baghdatis is yet to complete Cyprus' 26 months of compulsory military training. His father worries it could upset his son and believes the Cypriot government should guarantee he will not have to serve in the military until he is 35. \"But they are not willing to do that,\" he told the Cyprus News. \"He is constantly being given postponements from the Ministry of Defence regarding his draft. It is in itself a worry for our son.\"\n\nBaghdatis is less concerned. \"It is really difficult for them to come and ask me to go to the army today, so I'm not worried about that,\" he says.\n\n\"I'm just trying to be myself in the court, just try to have fun my way and just enjoy it my way. It seems that people like it, so I'm happy.\"\n\nAlthough he will again be the under-dog against Nalbandian, he has a 1-1 record against the Argentinian. \"I just go in the match and play my own tennis and try not to give easy points and try to be smart and take my chances,\" he says. \"If I do that, I have a big chance of winning.\" For a player whose previous best performance in five grand slams was reaching the fourth round here last year, a danger is to start thinking about the stakes.\n\nNot merely the chance to play in a grand slam final or the prizemoney — $1,220,000 for the Australian Open winner, $610,000 for the runner-up — also the massive boost to his career. But again, while other marvel over his endearing eccentricities, Baghdatis makes it clear he is here to do more than just entertain. \"A lot of people believe in me, my coach, my family,\" he says. \"So I believe.\""
