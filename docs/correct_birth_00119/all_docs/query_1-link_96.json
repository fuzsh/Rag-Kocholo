        "text": "Zagreb, Croatia, Mar 8: Ivan Ljubicic of Croatia has announced he will retire from tennis after the Monte Carlo Masters in April.\n\n“It's never an easy decision for any professional athlete to retire,” the 32-year-old told the ATP website. “I look forward to the next stage of my life. Tennis has given me so much and I want to continue to stay involved and contribute in some ways.”\n\nSince turning professional in 1998, Ljubicic has won 10 titles and reached a career-high ranking of No. 3 in May 2006. His biggest title win came at Indian Wells in 2010 when he beat Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Andy Roddick.\n\nFormer No. 1 Roger Federer paid tribute to the Bosnian-born Croat.\n\n“He's one of the most feared players on tour,” Federer told the ATP website. “It's sad seeing him go, but he's had a wonderful career and I can only congratulate him for that.”"
