        "text": "Roger Federer will probably remain one of the greatest tennis players in history even after his career ends, which he announced in an emotional speech on Twitter on September 15, 2022. After three years of injuries and surgeries, during which he worked hard to return to competitive form, he said he received a clear message from his body - he had reached his limit. At 41 years old and having played more than 1,500 matches in 24 years, he said it was now time to end his professional career. The Laver Cup in London in September 2022 was his last ATP tournament, although he will continue to play tennis in the future.\n\nHe played his last match together with his long-time rival Rafael Nadal in doubles. In this emotional match, it was almost incidental that Federer and Nadal lost 6:4, 6:7, 9:11 to the US Americans Jack Sock and Frances Tiafoe. Federer had decided not to play singles in the team event due to knee problems.\n\nRoger Federer led the tennis world rankings for 310 weeks in his career, 237 of them in a row. That remains a record to this day. Just one of many: He was the oldest player to top the list, Federer was the only player to win three Grand Slam titles in one season three times, he also has almost unbeatable records in many other areas of his sport, and he is and remains a serious opponent on the court - even for much younger opponents.\n\nBut Federer also shines off the court with his social commitment: since its establishment in 2003, the Roger Federer Foundation has supported educational projects in the region of southern Africa and in Switzerland. According to the foundation, by the end of 2020 it had already supported 1,750,000 children.\n\nRoger Federer was born in Switzerland on August 8, 1981. Together with his Swiss father, his South African mother and his sister, he grew up near Basel. He held his first tennis racket at the tender age of three. After an initially unspectacular career, he attended the TC Old Boys tennis school at the age of eight. Roger Federer achieved his first national successes at the age of 12. A few years later, he finally turned his back on schooling, focused fully on tennis and moved to the national training camp. During this time, Federer won seven Swiss junior titles.\n\nHis breakthrough came at the age of 17 at the Junior Australian Open, where the tennis pro made it to the semifinals. In the same year, he then won the singles and doubles at Wimbledon. These successes were his springboard into professional sports, where Federer made his debut on the ATP Tour in Gstaad, Switzerland, in 1998. In the very first year of his professional debut, Roger Federer made it into the top 100 of the world rankings. At the turn of the millennium, he topped the junior world rankings. After that, the tennis pro's career continued steeply. The Swiss won the US Open and the Wimbledon tournament five times in a row. From 2005 to 2007, Federer was named \"World Sportsman of the Year. Then, in 2004, he managed to break through to the top at number one tennis player in the world, where he remained for 310 weeks. Federer won the most Grand Slams (20) of all time and has 103 ATP victories to date.\n\nFederer has also been convincing at the Olympics. He has qualified for every Olympic Games since 2000, has been the Swiss flag bearer twice, and took home the gold medal in doubles in 2008 and the silver medal in singles in 2012. And the Games are also of great importance to Federer in his private life, as he met his future wife Mirka at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney. In Rio 2016, Federer had to sit out due to knee problems, as he did his participation in the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nFederer has been married to Swiss former tennis player Mirka Federer-Vavrinec since 2009. That same year, the couple became parents to twin daughters, and twin sons followed in 2014. But Federer not only has a heart for children in his private life. The Roger Federer Foundation, which supports the education of needy children in Switzerland and South Africa, has been in existence since 2003.\n\nEven if it is still completely open when Federer will retire from active tennis, the tennis great has in any case made excellent financial provisions. According to Forbes magazine, Roger Federer was not only the sportsman with the highest income in 2020, ahead of big soccer earners such as Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, but he also seems to have set himself up for a comfortable retirement with a broad portfolio of investments and shareholdings.\n\nFederer's entrepreneurial portfolio is diverse. Recently, for example, he invested in the Chilean food company NotCo, which specializes in alternative protein products, i.e. meat, milk and egg alternatives. He is in good company there as a backer: shortly after him, Amazon founder and richest man in the world Jeff Bezos and Formula 1 star Lewis Hamilton did the same and invested in the food company.\n\nWhen he joined On Running, he not only got his own shoe collection with \"The Roger,\" which also scores in terms of sustainability with vegan leather and reduced material consumption. The sports shoe manufacturer has recently been able to record rapid profits in the US market and is currently preparing for its IPO, from which Federer will also benefit with an investment of an estimated 50 million dollars.\n\nEven though it is not yet certain when Federer will end his active time on the tennis court, it is already clear that he will not be replaced by all his sponsors at the end: The major Swiss bank Kredite Suisse (CS), for example, has already signaled that it will stick with Federer as its advertising face and testimonial. He represents the ideal client for the bank, who uses its services in combination for both business and pleasure."
