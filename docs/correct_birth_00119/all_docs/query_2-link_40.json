Pay very close attention to that. Obey, and do what the priests and your parents tell you. Go often to holy Mass and receive Communion. Be very attentive these days. Some dishonest people will come to you, in numbers, in order to tempt you. Be careful of your statements. These days, I am expecting of you, a very special discipline. Do not move around anywhere, or often, and do not separate from one another.\"844 \"The most important thing is that you, the visionaries, remain united. Let peace be among you.

Pray each day for the Bishop.\"1050 \"Pray! It may seem strange to you that I always speak of prayer. And yet I say: pray! Why do you hesitate? In Holy Scripture, you have heard say: 'Do not worry about tomorrow, each day will have its own worries.' Then do not worry about the other days. Be content with prayer, I your Mother, will take care of the rest.\"1268 \"Dear children, I invite you to pray more, you and the entire parish, until the day of the anniversary.

Our Lady repeated:1360 \"Dear children! You have always prayed that I not abandon you. Now I ask of you, in turn, not to abandon me. Satan wants especially during these days to disperse you. For that, pray very much these days.\"1422 \"Dear children! You have always prayed that I not abandon you. Now I ask of you, in turn, not to abandon me.

Thank you for having responded to my call.\"1572 August 14, 1984 (Tuesday) This apparition was unexpected. Ivan was praying at home. After that he started to get ready to go to Church for the evening services. By surprise Our Lady appeared to him and told him to relate to the people: \"I would like the people to pray along with me these days. And to pray as much as possible! And to fast strictly on Wednesdays and Fridays, and every day to pray at least one Rosary: the joyful, sorrowful and glorious mysteries.\" Our Lady asked that we accept this message with a firm will. She especially requested this of the parishioners, and the faithful of the surrounding places.1576 August 30, 1984 \"Dear children! The cross was also in God's plan when you built it.

I am calling you to a more active prayer and attendance at Holy Mass. I wish your Mass to be an experience of God.
