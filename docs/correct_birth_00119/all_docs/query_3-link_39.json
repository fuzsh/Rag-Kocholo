        "text": "The BNP Paribas Open, a Masters Series 1000 Tournament held annually, has a rich and storied history.\n\nStaged at the Indian Wells Tennis Gardens, the setting is lushly picturesque with its 12 courts bathed in the warm California sun.\n\nThe tournament’s roots go back to 1976 with its name changing as often as its sponsors.\n\nThe popular tennis event, however, had its beginning at its current Indian Wells locale in 1987.\n\nBoris Becker won the inaugural men’s tournament at Indian Wells defeating Stefan Edberg in the final 6-4, 6-4, 7-5.\n\nSince that time this premiere tennis tournament has attracted the top players from the men’s and women’s field.\n\nFollowing upon the heels of the Australian Open, the one-two punch of Indian Wells and Miami, closes the early American hardcourt season, pressing the players toward the upcoming clay season.\n\nTo date, only three players in the tournament’s history have won the event more than twice–Americans Jimmy Connors, pre-Indian Wells, and Michael Chang who won the event in 1992 and then consecutively in 1996-1997.\n\nRoger Federer is the only player to have won the tournament consecutively three times from 2004-2006.\n\nThe question looming on the horizon remains–who will win the title in 2011? Perhaps one of the seasoned veterans will reclaim his spot at the top or will one of the new up-and-coming players demand the trophy on the final Sunday?\n\n2010 BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells – Winner Ivan Ljubicic\n\nWhen the Indian Wells Tournament got underway in 2010, the odds favoring Ivan Ljubicic to win this title were prohibitive––the longest of long shots according to the bookies!\n\nBut Ljubicic, ranked outside the top 20 but seeded No. 20 at the Indian Wells tournament, defied the odds and man-handled his opponents on his way through to the final.\n\nLjubicic defeated Ryan Harrison in the second round, Brian Dubul of Argentina in the third round, and Novak Djokovic, the No. 2 seed, in the fourth round 7-5, 6-3.\n\nLjubicic found himself facing and defeating Juan Monaco in the quarterfinals 4-6, 6-2,6-1. The Croat’s next top-ranked opponent would be the No. 3 seed Rafael Nadal in the semifinals. Ljubicic won saving a match point 3-6, 6-4, 7-6.\n\nIn the finals the Croat faced American Andy Roddick, the No. 7 seed, defeating him in a thrilling match 7-6, 7-6.\n\nLjubicic slew some tennis dragons on his way to the final where he finally celebrated winning his first ATP Masters Series 1000 title.\n\nThe final itself featured two of the top servers in the game and did not disappoint those assembled on Sunday afternoon watching these two duel it out.\n\nThe two finalists dodged bullets in the process, holding serve often against overwhelming odds. The joy of Ljubicic winning pleased and thrilled the assembled crowd as the 30-year-old celebrated.\n\n2009 BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells – Winner Rafael Nadal\n\nRafael Nadal came back strong in the California desert to capture his second BNP Paribas Open title at the 2009 Indian Wells tournament.\n\nThe Majorcan defeated Michael Berrer 6-2, 6-1 in the second round, Dmitry Tursunov 6-3, 6-3 in the third round, and the No. 14 seed David Nalbandian 3-6, 7-6, 6-0 in the fourth round.\n\nNadal had to fend off match points against him in the match with Nalbandian and felt fortunate to hang on for the win.\n\nAfter surviving that match, Nadal found himself facing the No. 6 seed Juan Martin del Potro. Energized, Nadal put the second Argentine in a row away 6-2, 6-4 in the quarterfinals.\n\nThat brought Nadal face to face with the No. 7 seed Andy Roddick whom he defeated 6-4, 7-6 in the semifinals.\n\nIn the finals the Majorcan met Scot Andy Murray, seeded No. 4, and literally blew him off the court 6-1, 6-2. The final on Sunday was played in very high winds which troubled the Scot immensely.\n\nMurray had met Roger Federer in his semifinal, upending the Swiss 6-3, 4-6, 6-1. But the Scot admitted he did not handle the windy conditions well, crediting Nadal with a solid win.\n\nAfter winning both the Australian Open in 2009 plus this Masters Series 1000 tournament in March, Nadal seemed well on his way to a dominating season of tennis.\n\nIt looked like that might happen all the way to French Open when Nadal was upset by Robin Soderling in the fourth round.\n\n2008 Pacific Life Open at Indian Wells – Winner Novak Djokovic\n\nThis tournament was known as the “Year of the Fish” because of the great run through the draw made by American Mardy Fish in 2008.\n\nPrior to this tournament, the slumping Fish considered giving up tennis but decided to give it one more try before hanging up his singles racket.\n\nThe astounding Fish made it to final to face Novak Djokovic and finally lost, ending his “Cinderella” run one match short at Indian Wells in 2008.\n\nDjokovic, who won the 2008 Pacific Life Open, defeated Andreas Seppi 6-3, 7-6 in the second round, Philipp Kohlschreiber 6-3, 6-2 in the third round, and the No. 16 seed Guillermo Canas in the fourth round.\n\nThe Serb went on to defeat Stanislav Wawrinka 7-6, 6-2 in the quarterfinals and the No. 2 seed Rafael Nadal in the semifinals.\n\nRanked at No. 98 in the world, Fish, remarkably, had run over Florian Mayer, Igor Andreev, Nikolay Davydenko, Lleyton Hewitt, David Nalbandian, and Roger Federer to find himself standing ready to do battle on the final Sunday of this premiere tennis tournament.\n\nIn the final, Fish made a contest of it by coming back to take the second set; but Djokovic took charge in the third set to win his first Pacific Life Open 6-2, 5-7, 6-3.\n\nRiding this victory after also winning the Australian Open earlier in the year, Djokovic seemed assured of a climb in the rankings.\n\n2007 Pacific Life Open at Indian Wells – Winner Rafael Nadal\n\nAfter winning this tournament three times in a row, the No. 1 seed Roger Federer lost in the second round of Indian Wells in 2007 to Guillermo Canas who got into the draw as a lucky loser.\n\nIt was a shock to Federer and to the tennis world who had grown accustomed to the Swiss dominating the Pacific Life Open in the California desert.\n\nThis opened the door for a new champion, and none other than No. 2 seed Rafael Nadal waltzed through.\n\nNadal had not found himself in the winner’s circle since he won the French Open on the grounds of Stade Roland Garros in 2006.\n\nOn his way to the Pacific Life Open final, Nadal slammed the door shut on Frenchman Arnaud Clement 6-3, 7-6 in the second round, Fernando Verdasco 6-4, 6-4 in the third round, and Juan Carlos Ferrero 6-1, 6-1 in the fourth round.\n\nNadal faced and defeated Juan Ignacio Chela 7-5, 7-5 in the quarterfinals and the No. 3 seed Andy Roddick 6-4, 6-3 in the semifinals.\n\nNadal’s opponent in the final was the No. 12 seed Novak Djokovic.\n\nThe Majorcan dispatched the Serb 6-2, 7-5 to win his first Pacific Life Open Masters at Indian Wells by totally overwhelming the 19-year old Serb.\n\nThe victory marked Nadal’s first win in nine months, ending a long title drought.\n\n2006 Pacific Life Open at Indian Wells – Winner Roger Federer\n\nRoger Federer won his third consecutive title at the Pacific Life Open on Sunday March 19, 2006.\n\nIn the final the Swiss scorched his opponent, James Blake, 7-5, 6-3, 6-0.\n\nThe American came out strong in the first set breaking Federer twice. But Federer came back strong, taking the first set––weakening Blake’s resolve to win after that.\n\nAfter breaking to lead 5-3 in the second set, Federer reeled off the next seven games as Blake’s resistance finally crumbled.\n\nThe 24-year-old Federer extended his 2006 record to 22-1, his sole loss coming against Spain’s Rafael Nadal in the Dubai final earlier this month.\n\nFederer’s road to the final included wins over Nicolas Massu 6-3, 7-6 in the second round and Oliver Rochus 3-6, 6-2, 7-5 in the third round.\n\nIn the fourth round Federer met and overcame Frenchman and No. 16 seed Richard Gasquet 6-3, 6-4.\n\nThe Swiss went on to defeat the No. 6 seed Ivan Ljubicic 6-2, 6-3 in the quarterfinals and Paradorn Srichaphan 6-2, 6-3 in the semifinals before meeting Blake.\n\nBlake had defeated Rafael Nadal in the semifinals 7-5, 6-3 to reach the finals but was powerless to defeat the Swiss on the hard courts at Indian Wells.\n\nCrowning Federer champion was becoming a habit for the people running this tournament in the California desert.\n\n2005 Pacific Life Open at Indian Wells – Winner Roger Federer\n\nThe No. 1 seed defeated the No. 2 seed in the finals of the Pacific Life Open.\n\nThe Swiss in reaching the final overcame American Mardy Fish 6-3, 6-3 in the second round, Gilles Muller 6-3, 6-2 in the third round and No. 13 seed Croat Ivan Ljubicic 7-6, 7-6 in the fourth round.\n\nIn the quarterfinals Federer met and defeated German Nicolas Kiefer 6-4, 6-1 before dispatching No. 14 seed Guillermo Canas 6-3, 6-1 in the semifinals.\n\nThen Federer met the Aussie Lleyton Hewitt in the final in a best three out of five format.\n\nHewitt had arrived in the final by dispatching the No. 3 seed Andy Roddick 7-6, 6-7, 7-6 in the semifinals after getting a walkover when Andre Agassi withdrew before their quarterfinal contest.\n\nFederer dominated Hewitt in the final 6-2, 6-4, 6-4 on the final Sunday of the event. He never allowed the Australian into the match.\n\nHewitt went for more than normal, trying to gain an advantage, but to no avail. While both accumulated 31 unforced errors, Federer countered his with 41 winners while Hewitt managed only 18.\n\nFederer never lost a set during the week and stood on the year with a 26-1 match record.\n\nFederer recorded his seventeenth straight final win which at the time was a tour record.\n\nIt was the Swiss’ second consecutive win at the Indian Wells Tournament.\n\n2004 Pacific Life Open at Indian Wells – Winner Roger Federer\n\nNo. 1 seed Roger Federer finally battled his way through to win his first title at the 2004 Pacific Life Open in Indian Wells.\n\nHis opponent in the final was Brit Tim Henman also hoping for his first Pacific Open championship.\n\nThe Swiss defeated Andrei Pavel 6-1, 6-1 in the second round, Fernando Gonzalez 6-3, 6-2 in the third round and American Mardy Fish 6-4, 6-1 in the fourth round.\n\nHenman got through Simon Larose of Canada, Alex Corretja of Spain, and Wayne Arthurs of Australian to work his way into the quarterfinals.\n\nIn the quarters Federer defeated Juan Ignacio Chela 6-2, 6-1 while Henman defeated the No. 3 seed Andy Roddick 6-7, 7-6, 6-3.\n\nBoth advanced to the semifinals where Federer dispatched Andre Agassi 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 and Henman disposed of Iraki Ladbadze.\n\nIn the finals Federer clamped down hard and never allowed Henman any margin for error.\n\nThe Swiss dominated on his own serve and pressed Henman to go for too much as the Brit tried to gain some advantage in the match.\n\nFederer broke Henman in the fourth game of the first set and closed it out without looking back.\n\nFederer secured breaks in the third and again in the ninth game of the second set to deny the Brit any hope of victory while the Swiss pounded home 12 winners, three aces and no double faults.\n\nThe win gave Federer his 14th career ATP title.\n\nIt was the Swiss’ first win over Henman and his first Pacific Life Open Masters Series trophy.\n\n2003 Pacific Life Open at Indian Wells – Winner Lleyton Hewitt\n\nAustralian Lleyton Hewitt, seeded No. 1, won the 2003 Pacific Life Masters Series Open at Indian Wells, but early on the Aussie had his hands full simply trying to advance to the next round.\n\nHewitt, who successfully defended the title he won last year, was nearly beaten in the first round of the tournament.\n\nThe Aussie fought off three match points against Younes El Aynaoui of Morocco before finally coming away victorious 4-6, 7-5, 6-2.\n\nHewitt was tested again in his third round match.\n\nThe Aussie needed three sets to dispatch Argentina’s Guillermo Coria 6-7, 6-4, 6-3.\n\nOnce Hewitt reached the quarterfinals, however, he began playing the type of tennis that propelled him to the number one spot and allowed him to win his last three matches without dropping a set.\n\nIn the final match, Hewitt rushed past Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil 6-1, 6-1.\n\nKuerten had defeated the No. 4 seed Roger Federer in the second round 7-5, 7-6 but offered Hewitt little resistance in the final.\n\nHewitt’s victory marked the 19th career title for the 22-year-old Australian, who improved his 2003 match record to 15-1.\n\n2002 Pacific Life Open at Indian Wells – Winner Lleyton Hewitt\n\nIn 2001 Lleyton Hewitt became the youngest player to be ranked No. 1 at the age of 20.\n\nHewitt managed to finish the 2001 season holding on to the No. 1 ranking aided by winning the U.S. Open in New York City.\n\nThe Aussie used his tenacity and his pinpoint accuracy to great advantage against the lingering serve and volley players on tour. No one out scrambled Hewitt on court.\n\nAt Indian Wells, Hewitt opened his campaign by defeating Carlos Moya 6-4, 6-4 in the first round.\n\nIn the second round the Aussie upended Andrei Pavel 4-6, 6-3, 6-0.\n\nJan-Michael Gambill was Hewitt’s victim in the third round and Thomas Enqvist his quarterfinal/fourth round conquest.\n\nIn the semifinals, Hewitt dispatched Pete Sampras 6-2, 6-4 and breezed past Tim Henman in the finals 6-1, 6-2.\n\nThe 21-year old Australian barely broke a sweat in a final that looked far too easy.\n\nSo far on the year Hewitt won two of the three tournaments he played in 2002. The Aussie had won 34 of his last 38 matches in total.\n\nHewitt would go on to dominate only one more year before he being overtaken by the Swiss Roger Federer.\n\n2001 Tennis Masters Series at Indian Wells – Winner Andre Agassi\n\nFor the thirtieth time in their long and storied rivalry, Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi met––this time in the finals of the Masters Series tournament at Indian Wells.\n\nSampras was the No. 3 seed and Agassi was seeded No. 4.\n\nSampras skirted by German David Prinosil, Frenchmen Fabrice Santoro and Sebastien Grosjean and Aussie Patrick Rafter before facing Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov in the semifinals.\n\nAgassi’s path led him through Moroccan Hicham Arazi, Germans Tommy Haas and Nicolas Kiefer, Ecuadorian Nicolas Lapentti before the American faced Aussie Lleyton Hewitt in the semifinals.\n\nAgassi defeated Sampras in straight sets able to overcome the Sampras serve and volley game with his accurate and penetrating groundstrokes 7-6, 7-5, 6-1.\n\nFor Agassi, it marked his first victory at Indian Wells after making the trip to the California desert 13 times.\n\nIn 1995 Sampras deprived Agassi of the Masters Series title as Sampras won his second championship at Indian Wells that year.\n\nSampras struggled to find the mark during this final and eventually succumbed to Agassi after failing to hold to capture the second set.\n\nDuring the match Sampras was charged with 49 unforced errors to 10 for Agassi.\n\nSampras would remain on tour only one more year, retiring after the 2002 U.S. Open but Agassi would continue his assault on the tennis courts of the world, remaining competitive, always pushing himself forward."
