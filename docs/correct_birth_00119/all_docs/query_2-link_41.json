        "text": "Petrova blasts Russian tennis authorities - Yahoo! Sport ~~~\n\nThe active verbs and the hyperbolic adjectives are flying in this article about Nadia Petrova. After I read the opening two sentences--\n\n\"World No. 8 Nadia Petrova launched a scathing attack on her home tennis federation, saying their contribution to the success enjoyed by the Russians mounted to 'mere words.'\n\n'The Russian tennis authorities can't claim any credit for the success many of the players are having on the professional circuit these days,' Petrova claimed.\n\n--I was hoping for some juicy personal attacks and specfic instances of malfeasance, but what follows is pretty tame. Athletes don't get the money for training expenses that they used to (seems like the tradeoff on that, which is keeping all the money you earn, isn't too bad) and it's really the girls' parents that are ultimately responsible for their success (that's the reality in every country in the world, not just Russia).\n\nShe goes on to bemoan the lack of camaraderie among the Russians on tour, but if she craves team spirit, perhaps tennis isn't the most appropriate sport. How about basketball or soccer? On second thought, she's not likely to have made nearly four million dollars before the age of 24 playing either of those team sports.\n\nTeen Prodigy Power Play:: heraldsun.news.com ~~~\n\nThirteen-year-old Bernard Tomic has made quite a splash this month in Australia by winning two ITF 18-and-under tournaments in New Zealand. The link to this story on Bob Larson's Tennis News asks \"Is This Federer's Successor?\" I think a more appropriate question would be \"Is This Donald Young's Successor?\" The companion story details IMG's interest, and the management company that signed Young at 14 looks like the frontrunner to represent Tomic. There are things that can prevent it of course, but I'm already on record as thinking Tomic has all the tools to be a great player. What I don't understand is the advantage to IMG in signing someone this young.\n\nMost contracts are three years in duration, meaning that just when a young signee is likely to show some bankable results, his or her contract expires, leaving the player free to negotiate with others. I believe something similar recently happened with Andy Murray. Speaking of whom, Murray has shown an ability to tune out the clamor of expectations emanating from Great Britain, but that's not a talent everyone has. Prodigies from all the formerly dominating world tennis powers (U.S.A, France, Australia and Great Britain) are latched onto as a country's best hope, with their wins and losses scrutinized way beyond their importance, until the hype becomes the reason people want to see them--not their tennis skills.\n\nDonald Young spent 2005 getting wild cards into ATP main draws and losing in the first round, which may have not been the wisest path to developing his game. He still is a story when he comes to town, but those towns are now Brownsville and Kissimmee not Indian Wells and Key Biscayne. Can IMG make anyone a better tennis player? Of course not. What they offer always needs to be weighed against that simple fact.\n\nThe family racket: Roddick crossroads--MySA.com ~~~\n\nA San Antonio columnist takes a look at Andy Roddick's newest coach, brother John, and what the two of them hope to gain from their new partnership.\n\nI spoke briefly to John in La Jolla at the Davis Cup, and he assured me that his academy will continue; he's hoping to hire his replacement by May or June. I told him how much I'd miss him on the junior tennis circuit; there was no question that he was a hands-on coach, willing to do the travel, the practice, the teaching and the parenting that elite junior tennis requires. And like every effective coach I've ever known, he was forthright-- unwilling to gloss over the truth when honesty was necessary to a player's improvement.\n\nI hope that John and Andy can fix whatever is broken in Andy's game and psyche right now--at 23, there's no reason to think his best tennis is behind him. (By the way, Andy had turned 21 by the time he won the U.S. Open in 2003--this article says he was 20). But when Andy's career is over, I expect John will be back coaching juniors. He has too much to contribute to stay away from the sport he loves.\n\nGeorgia Captures ITA Team Indoor National Championship:: georgiadogs.collegesports.com ~~~\n\nI spent several hours this weekend going through my digital photos, backing up my computer and trying to solve an ipod malfunction. Not very exciting stuff, but the fact that I could listen to the live webcast of the USTA/ITA Men's Indoor at radiotennis.com made it more fun than it sounds.\n\nKen Thomas, who IS radiotennis.com, never lacks for opinions, but he's so charming, you can only disagree with him, you can't dislike him. He said several times that he thought Illinois and Georgia were the best teams in the competition, and their 4-3 semifinal battle gives credence to that opinion. The only disappointment was that Ken had to leave to return to Southern California and his day job, so the singles of the Georgia/Illinois semifinal and the final between Georgia and Pepperdine were not webcast. (He'll be back at it this weekend though at the qualifying in Las Vegas for the Tennis Channel Open).\n\nWith as storied a program as Georgia's, it is a bit surprising that the Bulldogs had never won this National Indoor title before. They will be ranked number one when the new rankings come out Wednesday; current number one Florida lost twice in Seattle and will fall out of the top five. But as any college coach will tell you, the three months between now and the NCAAs is a very long time.\n\nMagic Murray claims maiden title:: BBC SPORT | Tennis ~~~\n\nWith all the press that Andy Murray's gotten since last year's Wimbledon, I've steered clear of posting stories about him, though I'll always have a soft spot, since he was the subject of my first article for a national publication. And winning an ATP title by beating Andy Roddick and Lleyton Hewitt in the semis and finals, which Murray just did this weekend, is downright astounding.\n\nPeter Bodo published an interesting post about Martina Hingis that uses the phrase tennis DNA, and although Joel Drucker, one of the very best tennis writers around, didn't much like the concept when I asked him about during the Davis Cup, I find it useful. When Murray was a junior, I heard many people express doubts about his chance to have a solid pro career because he didn't have a \"weapon.\" I confess that they had me looking at his game with those blinders on, and last year at this time, when he was losing early in South American futures events, there was no indication that he would be what the British public so desperately wanted--a new tennis hero.\n\nBut somehow Murray has managed to continue to build his game, learn from losses and ignore the unabating glare of the British media. How has he done it? How has he gone from losing in the French Junior Open last June, to winning an ATP event this February? I don't know, but I suspect it's tennis DNA.\n\nKing pins down Camille::Indiatimes - Sport~~~\n\nSince she lost in the final round of Australian Open qualifying last month, seventeen-year-old Vania King has been in Japan, Thailand and now India. She qualified to reach the main draw last week in Thailand and this week, with a 141 ranking, earned a spot in the main draw without having to hit a ball. She destroyed veteran Nicole Pratt 6-0, 6-1 in the second round, and in the quarterfinals dispatched Camille Pin, who had upset top seed and national heroine Sania Mirza in the previous round. This story, in very colorful language, (King's groundstrokes are described as \"solid as a bison's behind) details that win and the struggle she had in closing it out in two sets.\n\nSick for days, King retired in her semifinal match today against nemesis Mara Santangelo of Italy, the third seed, trailing 5-0, but I doubt it was an Henin-Hardenne situation. She also was playing doubles this week and forced to retire in Friday's semifinal after one set due to the same illness.\n\nAs disappointing as it must be for King to lose a chance at her first WTA final, she (and her father, apparently with her in India) must be very proud of her progress in the past six months. The sooner a player can free herself from the Futures treadmill the better, and King's willingness to travel outside the U.S. to do it has paid off for her.\n\nITA Men's Indoor Underway without Cardinal~~~\n\nLast year at this time, I was lucky enough to be in Chicago watching the Intercollegiate Tennis Association's Men's Team Indoor tournament. The Midtown Tennis Club was full of host Illinois' alumni and it was excellent preparation for my first NCAA trip a few months later.\n\nThis year the event is in Seattle, with the University of Washington as host, not a place I could drive to, so I'm watching via the internet. In the land of Microsoft, I guess it's not surprising that there's even streaming video of a court this year, although I'm finding it difficult to tell who is who and to keep track of the score. But try for yourself, the event's homepage is here.\n\nBeginning on Saturday, Ken Thomas of radiotennis.com will be doing play-by-play, so check out that option as well. I bumped into Ken at the Davis Cup in La Jolla, and he was excited about doing college tennis again, and with his opportunity to interview Torben Ulrich, a cult figure in hardcore tennis circles. For more information on the upcoming interview, click here.\n\nAmong the 16 college tennis teams competing for championship this weekend are perennial contenders Florida, Georgia, Illinois and defending NCAA champion UCLA. Notably absent is Stanford, currently ranked sixth in the country. Casey Angle, the ITA Communications director and all-around good guy, explained that Stanford is missing due to invitations being based on preseason rankings. The preseason rankings are mostly based on the previous year, and since Stanford finished outside the top 20, and lost Sam Warburg to graduation, they weren't considered top 12 material, which assures an invitation. Having already defeated UCLA and USC this year without fab freshman Matt Bruch, Stanford can use the snub as motivation to prepare for the NCAAs this spring--in Palo Alto.\n\nPeter Bodo's Tennis World Blog:: Will Play for Food ~~~\n\nI hope all zootennis.com readers also visit Peter Bodo's Tennisworld blog regularly, and not just because he's been my biggest high-profile supporter. Peter's funny, honest, self-assured, provocative and knowledgable. And if he can't get an answer, it's probably not worth knowing. (I guess you could call this post my valentine to Peter Bodo.)\n\nIn a conversation we had in Australia, he was intrigued by my offhand mention of junior Kim Couts being at the junior Open on her own, and he dug out this story, at once typical and unique. (And probably wrote the clever headline too). One of Peter's favorite lines is \"money quote\" and here is this story's:\n\nThis is what it takes to be in the hunt in junior tennis these days. You have to figure that this was a calculated risk on the Couts' part, because a lot of the top juniors from the U.S. and Europe pass on Australia because of the time and cost of getting there. That translates to an opportunity for players like Kim, who can improve their rankings and reputations by undertaking the trip. But, of course, it's risky.\n\nSay what you will about spoiled brats, silver spoons, or how tennis is a “sissy” sport. The reality is that for most youngsters, it takes an enormous amount of sacrifice to make it to the pros, and at least one of the things they give up they will never, ever be able to get back, no matter what: a typical childhood.\n\nWhether that experience is overrated or not is up to you to decide.\n\nRoddick cruises past Sabau to Clinch Davis Cup tie for U.S.~~~\n\n©Colette Lewis 2006\n\nLa Jolla--\n\nA low-octane Andy Roddick sliced through an overmatched Razvan Sabau of Romania 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 Sunday morning to secure the United States’ spot in the Davis Cup’s second round in April. The U.S. will host Chile, a first round winner over the Slovak Republic at a site to be determined.\n\nRoddick admitted his goal was to win in straight sets given his still undiagnosed illness on Friday. It wasn’t until Saturday evening when his appetite returned that “Operation Resuscitation” as he dubbed it, was deemed complete. But he still wasn’t interested in assessing his stamina.\n\n“I felt fine but I wasn’t wanting to test it too much and find out how deep I could go here,” Roddick said. “I felt horrible the other day after my match. I didn’t want to test those waters.”\n\nFortunately for Roddick, Sabau, the emergency substitute for injured Victor Hanescu, wasn’t ready to play the match of his life.\n\n“I wish I could have done more than I did because I saw that Roddick was not hundred percent,” said Sabau, 112th in the ATP rankings. “He was defensive and he stayed a very long distance behind the baseline. I was expecting him to attack me.”\n\nInstead Roddick began the match slicing to Sabau’s backhand, not giving the twenty-eight year old from Bucharest any chance to line up his best shot, the down-the-line backhand.\n\n“Early on I was doing some slices, wasn’t in a rush to finish points off as quickly,” Roddick said. “I wanted to see if he could create on an outdoor hard court.”\n\nRoddick got his answer- no- and he also benefited from nine double faults from Sabau, who has been nursing a sore elbow.\n\n“I am okay now…I played with pain for six months,” Sabau said. “Even though I was able to play, I couldn’t practice my serve, and I think as everybody could see today, my serve is not good at all. I try just to get the first serve in to be able to play the point, but it’s not enough against a player as good as Roddick.”\n\nCaptain Patrick McEnroe now begins the search for a grass court venue, a surface that Roddick publicly lobbied for when Bud Collins interviewed him on court after the match, and later in the post match press conference.\n\n“Grass is probably my best surface…..in the doubles I think it’s huge as well. So you know, as far as Xs and Os, I feel like a grass court would be the best surface for us.”\n\nA Davis Cup stalwart who has now clinched six ties for the U.S., Roddick’s wish may be McEnroe’s command. Even after Roddick’s disappointing loss on Friday and James Blake’s two wins, including a 6-1, 7-5 dead rubber win over Horia Tecau Sunday, McEnroe insisted that Roddick remains the keystone of the team.\n\n“He is a leader and he’s been around long enough and he’s won a lot of big matches for us,” McEnroe said. “I love his effort, his intensity. When he was vomiting on the court and was still able to somehow miraculously almost pull it out in the fifth set, I think that sort of set the tone for us for the year, to be honest, his type of effort.”\n\nThe entire team heads up the California coast to play in the SAP ATP event in San Jose, and the onboard conversation could turn to court surface for the Chile tie.\n\n“We’re all flying to San Jose,” Blake said. “We’ll probably talk about it a little bit on the plane and see what we think. I think with Andy and the Bryans wanting grass so adamantly, I think it makes sense for our choice.“\n\nIF that’s what the team decides, McEnroe promises to take up the cause.\n\n“If all the guys definitively tell me they prefer one thing over another, then I have to use my pull to make that happen.”\n\nBryans Give U.S. 2-1 Lead; Hanescu Retires and is Doubtful for Sunday~~\n\n©Colette Lewis 2006\n\nLa Jolla--\n\nSaturday is usually a short day in Davis Cup with only the often pivotal doubles match contested. But no one who made their way to the La Jolla Beach and Tennis Club on a cool and foggy morning expected to spend the afternoon watching the McEnroe brothers versus the Bryans in an exhibition match. That’s what they got however, when Romania’s Victor Hanescu was forced to retire with a ribcage ligament tear after thirty-three minutes and the Bryans leading the match 6-2, giving the U.S. a 2-1 lead heading into Sunday’s singles.\n\nAndrei Pavel, who had stunned Andy Roddick in Friday’s first singles match, was expected to play doubles with Hanescu, but in a concession to Pavel’s age and recovery time after a five-set, nearly four-hour marathon against Roddick, Horia Tecau was instead called on to partner Hanescu against the world’s top-ranked doubles team.\n\nIt was a baptism by fire for the twenty-one-year-old from Constanta, as the Bryans came out smoking. Every return was in play, no volley too tough, no position too precarious; it wasn’t until Hanescu served down 0-2 that the Romanians won a point, and although he held for 2-1 and Teacu took his next service game, Hanescu soon began clutching his back and two medical timeouts later, the match was over.\n\n“We obviously started strong, so we leave the match feeling good about ourselves,” Bob Bryan said. “We did our part.\"\n\n\"Obviously it would have been great to finish the match, but bottom line is we won,\" said U.S. Captain Patrick McEnroe. \"So we’re up 2-1 and feeling good about our chances tomorrow.\"\n\nHanescu’s status for Sunday’s singles match with Roddick is doubtful, pending the results of an MRI. As for Roddick, he was introduced with the U.S. team Saturday afternoon, but did not stay on the bench for the doubles and was still taking fluids and resting.\n\nAsked whether there was a chance Roddick wouldn’t play Sunday, McEnroe quickly dismissed that speculation. “Unless he wakes up in the morning and can’t walk,” said McEnroe. \"But, no, I don’t see that happening.”\n\n\"Andy is feeling better, his energy is pretty good,” McEnroe reported. \"His stomach was still a little big queasy earlier in the day. By the end of tonight and by tomorrow, he’ll be ready to go.”\n\nWith the sudden end to the day, it was the McEnroes to the rescue, as John hopped out of The Tennis Channel television booth and onto the court to join brother Pat in a pro set against the Bryans. John makes his return to ATP tour tennis on Wednesday in San Jose, teaming with Jonas Bjorkman in doubles, but he and Patrick presented no problem for the Bryans, who took the set 8-4. The majority of the 5200 spectators appreciated the opportunity to gauge for themselves McEnroe’s chances at a Navratilovan-like career renaissance in doubles, and went home happy with the tennis they saw and the U.S.A’s 2-1 lead.\n\nBlake Saves First Day for U.S. Davis Cup team ~~~\n\n©Colette Lewis 2006\n\nLa Jolla--\n\nThe pressure was squarely on James Blake's shoulders. After an ill Andy Roddick failed to finish off Andre Pavel of Romania in straight sets in Friday's first match, holding match point in the third set tiebreak but falling 6-4 in the fifth, a huge upset was looming. But Blake never gave opponent Victor Hanescu a glimmer of hope, and in the fading light of a cool and sun-splashed day, the American restored his team's confidence with a 6-4, 7-6 (5), 6-2 victory.\n\nAn appealing aspect of Davis Cup is the opportunity it provides for one player to help another, an aspect of sport that is often wanting in the individualism of tennis. It's doubtful that Andy Roddick would have continued to play in a standard ATP tournament in, as he phrased it, \"you pick the city\", when a stomach flu rendered him virtually inert in the match's final three sets. Vomiting during changeovers, he often didn't move for a ball, and he frequently seemed oblivious to his surroundings. But he refused to quit, knowing how much his teammates and his country relied on him. Down 5-1 in the fifth, he clawed his way back to 5-4, but on Pavel's third match point, Roddick finally succumbed, despite the spirited urging of the 4,000 plus spectators, who had devoted more than three and a half hours of mental and physical energy to the contest.\n\nLess than fifteen minutes later Blake was on the court, and though there were noticeably fewer fans and those remaining obviously disappointed and deflated, it didn't hamper Blake. Using his forehand and speed, he denied Hanescu any rhythm and the six-foot six-inch Romanian couldn't find a shot to go to when he needed it.\n\nIt was more than two hours after the match's completion that Roddick spoke with the press, and he seemed to have recovered sufficiently to both analyze the match and express his determination to play on Sunday. But now, the attention turns to the doubles, as on Saturday the world's top-ranked doubles team, Bob and Mike Bryan, try to erase the memory of their defeat at the hands of Croatia's Mario Ancic and Ivan Ljubicic in last year's first round tie in Carson, a loss that the U.S. couldn't overcome in singles on Sunday.\n\nDavis Cup High Performance Camp--Day Three ~~~\n\n©Colette Lewis 2006\n\nSan Diego CA\n\nHigh Performance coach Martin Van Daalen asked me today if I was enjoying myself, and I could only respond, honestly, that there was no place I'd rather be. The weather was ideal--a world away from the cold and snow of Michigan-- and I was watching six of the best fourteen and fifteen-year-olds in the country play tennis. When I turned the question on Martin, he agreed, saying, \"it's not hard to have fun when you're coaching guys like this.\"\n\nI also had the pleasure of spending most of the day with Peter Dopkin, the editor of my column at SMASH Magazine's website. (For the latest column, click here.) Down from LA to cover the Davis Cup, he was more than agreeable to seeing the Barnes Tennis Center, meeting Steve Bickham and his coaches, and also getting his first glimpse of the High Performance camp and personnel. When the boys broke for lunch, Peter and I found our way to funky Ocean Beach, where we had a great lunch, with the pier and the Pacific as the backdrop. It occurred to me that in the space of a month, I'd seen the Pacific Ocean from two continents' coasts--quite amazing really.\n\nThe High Performance afternoon session got serious--the six boys were split into two teams a la Davis Cup, and three singles matches were begun, although only one finished during the two hours allotted for them. The boys were berating themselves, line calls were disputed, and the competition, which will continue over the weekend, was paramount. All matches couldn't finish today because the High Performance \"stars\" as they were referred to in the poster for the event, were to attend a clinic at Balboa Tennis Club, where the ubiquitous Wayne Bryan was entertaining another set of budding San Diego tennis players. Rodney Harmon, the USTA's Director of Men's Tennis, was also on hand, and Wayne praised and roasted Harmon in equal measure during the festivities.\n\nI've heard Wayne's shtick more than several times now, but with his panache it just doesn't get old. I still laugh at his jokes and admire his energy and his communication skills, not to mention his love of the game. And the \"Circle of Fear\" was just as compelling for the six junior \"stars\" as it was for the less accomplished participants. The Davis Cup Cares Clinic was certainly not drudgery for anyone, and Wayne Bryan can take a lot of the credit for that.\n\nDavis Cup High Performance Camp--Day Two ~~~\n\n©Colette Lewis 2006\n\nSan Diego--\n\nA whirlwind of activity today for the six boys at the Davis Cup High Performance Camp, and I missed the \"wall-of-sand\" workout they started with at 7:00 this morning.\n\nI caught up with them at the Barnes Center, and coaches Van Daalen and Merklein had decided that in the matches, the server would start each game down 15-30. It certainly focused their attention quickly, giving a special urgency to winning the first point.\n\nAfter an hour and a half of play, it was time for sandwiches and a trip to the La Jolla Beach and Tennis Club, the site of the Davis Cup tie.\n\nIt was the boys' first opportunity to meet some of the team members, and under a cloudless blue sky, they witnessed a very close and spirited set of doubles between Bob and Mike Bryan and practice partners Jesse Witten and Phillip Simmonds. Captain Pat McEnroe was on the outside practice court too, observing and ballrunning. Todd Martin came by for a look, and Mardy Fish, still fighting a wrist injury, was never far from the action. James Blake and his older brother Thomas stopped over and met the boys and after the first set of doubles, McEnroe invited them to the stadium court, where the Bryans and Witten and Simmonds resumed their match.\n\nA couple of hours later, Van Daalen, Merklein and company were back at the Barnes Tennis Center, and the boys were preparing to entertain the early arrivals for the Bryan brothers clinic. Rhyne Williams and JT Sundling played singles on the Stadium court for a half hour, and then Devin Britton and Blake Davis took on Brad Klahn and Austin Krajicek in doubles until Wayne Bryan arrived to entertain the kids, who arrived in busloads.\n\nCoaches from Barnes, outfitted in red tees, served as focal points for the drills that papa Bryan has developed, and he could hardly have asked for a more enthusiastic and vocal group. When the twins arrived, they demonstrated skill drills and took on several different teams of youngsters, usually with the handicap of holding hands with each other or several young volunteers while they played the point. The highlight was the chest-bumping contest, where, in spite of Wayne's caution, two very young boys smacked each other so hard that they both tumbled to the court.\n\nAfter the exhibition, several hundred aspiring players were sent to individual courts to drill with Barnes staff, volunteers and older juniors. Kerry Blum and Steve Bickham are probably relieved that it's over, but they did a great job of organizing and staffing it. The Barnes Tennis Center should be very proud of the role they've played in this Davis Cup tie.\n\nDavis Cup High Performance Camp--Day One~~~\n\nI spent Tuesday finding out who and what makes up a Davis Cup camp for juniors.\n\nThe Scene: Barnes Tennis Center in San Diego, a non-profit public facility dedicated to junior tennis.\n\nThe Coaches: Martin Van Daalen, USTA High Performance coach for birth year 1991 and Mark Merklein, the HP coach for the 1990s, recently hired to replace David DiLucia, who is now coaching Lindsay Davenport, and Bobby Bernstein, the Administrator of Coaching Education for the USTA\n\nThe Players: Devin Britton, Blake Davis, Austin Krajicek, JT Sundling, Rhyne Williams, and Bradley Klahn with Alex Johnson, who trains at Barnes, filling in during the morning workouts, while Klahn attends school.\n\nI understand the day started with an hour-long early morning run on the beach (I missed that) and then a two-hour training session with drills. While I ran up to La Jolla to pick up my Davis Cup credentials (and watched the Bryan twins hit with USTA HP coach Jay Berger), they took a break, then returned mid-afternoon to play round-robin one-set matches. And while Bernstein was doing his instructive video analysis, mechanics weren't the only focus; Van Daalen and Bernstein were also seeking footage to demonstrate how the fourteen and fifteen-year-olds could improve their warm up habits and match demeanors.\n\nTomorrow is the Big Event for the Barnes Center--the Bryans will be there for a clinic, and Steve Bickham and his staff were busy getting the site ready for the expected crush of young tennis fans. The facility includes 25 courts, four of which are clay, and although juniors are the focus, adults are welcome too. I can't imagine how it could be improved upon; I just wish every city in the country could find a way to copy it.\n\nBollettieri bothered by U.S. flop 'Down Under':: HeraldTribune.com ~~~\n\nNick is never at a loss for words, and it would be difficult to write a column about him without mentioning once again how much better U.S. tennis was back in the heydey of his academy. Here's the latest update on that:\n\n\"To me, you have to come up with a program the way the academy was,\" Bollettieri said Tuesday. \"We had them at a young age and never ran out of ammunition. We should be concentrating on players who are 11, 12, 13 and 14 years of age.\"\n\nThere was a time when the best young Americans flocked to the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy. Agassi, Jim Courier, Aaron Krickstein and even Pete Sampras trained there at the same time. Pierce and, later, the Williams sisters trained there.\n\nThe academy, even back then, wasn't exclusively all-American. Monica Seles was a member of the academy. And, later, Tommy Haas.\n\nWhat they all had in common is that they trained there without paying. In 1987 there were 27 players with connections to Bollettieri in the main draw of the Australian Open. And all of them were on scholarship.\n\nBollettieri believes those who handle tennis in the U.S. should make certain that players have the best opportunity to work on their game without worrying about how to pay for the instruction.\n\nI don't get this. Isn't there still an academy with Nick's name on it? What is stopping him from going back to the way it was? Is this an admission that selling out to IMG was a mistake? I know the Academy still offers full scholarships and they have scores of talented young players training there. Granted the percentage of Americans may be smaller than it used to be, but welcome to the 21st century of tennis, the one where Croatia wins the Davis Cup and the top players in the game come from Switzerland and Belgium.\n\nAnd I know that Bollettieri is revered in the Sarasota/Bradenton area (they've just named a street after him), but this strikes me as a bit much:\n\nThe year's first Grand Slam tournament ended prematurely for the U.S. without any American-born player -- male or female -- reaching the semifinals.\n\nNick Bollettieri says that shouldn't happen. And wouldn't if he were running American tennis.\n\nOh really? Would anyone like to make a bet on that?\n\nUp and Downs Down Under~~~\n\n©Colette Lewis 2006\n\nThere were definitely highs and lows during my first trip to Australia. Here, in no particular order, are some of them.\n\nThe lows:\n\nDropping my camera in the toilet on the second day of the tournament\n\nNo U.S. boys or girls to watch in singles in the quarterfinals and beyond\n\nA 90 minute queue to get through customs to enter Australia after 30 hours of travel\n\nMissing the last tram (midnight) from Melbourne Park by a couple of minutes & having to find a way back to the hotel\n\nThe prevalence of instant coffee\n\nThe sausages—which smelled a lot better than they tasted\n\nTemperatures that went from 109 to 69 in the space of 24 hours\n\nIndoor tennis—whether from heat or rain, it just didn’t seem like tennis to me\n\nThe highs:\n\nAustralians—they couldn’t be more welcoming, hospitable or friendly\n\nSpending a beautiful summer day on an Australian beach\n\nLift—a carbonated lemonade\n\nClean, frequent, air-conditioned trams\n\nWatching Baghdatis vs. Nalbandian live\n\nMy husband watching Roddick vs. Baghdatis from Andy’s player box thanks to John Roddick’s generosity\n\nLearning from Pat McEnroe who would be on the Davis Cup team four days before it was announced publicly\n\nHearing Craig Tiley’s plans for Australian tennis development\n\nThe free fresh-squeezed juice if you had an American Express card\n\nThe free beer and wine every afternoon if you had media credentials\n\nDinner with James Blake and Xavier Malisse (well, they were in the same restaurant as we were)\n\nBreakfast with Rod Laver, Fred Stolle, Stan Smith and Jim Courier (well, they were on the same plane to LA as we were)\n\nGetting to know more junior tennis players and their games\n\nSpending a total of five minutes getting through customs in LA"
