        "text": "City in Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nThis article is about Banja Luka. Not to be confused with Banja Loka.\n\nCity\n\nBanja Luka (Serbian Cyrillic: Бања Лука, pronounced [bǎɲa lǔːka] ⓘ) or Banjaluka (Serbian Cyrillic: Бањалука, pronounced [baɲalǔːka]) is the second largest city in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the largest city of Republika Srpska, of which it is also the de facto capital.[2] Banja Luka is the traditional centre of the densely-forested Bosanska Krajina region of northwestern Bosnia. According to the 2013 census , the city proper has a population of 138,963, while its administrative area comprises a total of 185,042 inhabitants.\n\nThe city is home to the University of Banja Luka and University Clinical Center of the Republika Srpska, as well as numerous entity and state institutions for Republika Srpska and Bosnia and Herzegovina, respectively. The city lies on the Vrbas river and is well known in the countries of the former Yugoslavia for being full of tree-lined avenues, boulevards, gardens, and parks.[3] Banja Luka was designated European city of sport in 2018.\n\nName\n\n[edit]\n\nThe name Banja Luka was first mentioned in a document dated to 6 February 1494 by Ladislaus II of Hungary. The name is interpreted as the 'Ban's meadow', from the words ban (a medieval noble title), and luka ('valley' or 'meadow'). The identity of the ban and the meadow in question remains uncertain, and popular etymology combines the modern words banja ('bath' or 'spa'), or bajna ('marvelous') and luka ('port'). A different interpretation is suggested by the Hungarian name Lukácsbánya, in English 'Luke's Mine'. In modern usage, the name is pronounced and occasionally written as one word (Banjaluka).[4]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nOverview\n\n[edit]\n\nBanja Luka covers some 96.2 km2 (37.1 sq mi) of land in Bosnia and Herzegovina and is situated on both banks of the Vrbas in the Banja Luka valley, which is characteristically flat within the otherwise hilly region. Banja Luka's centre lies 163 m (534.78 ft) above sea level.\n\nThe source of the Vrbas River is about 90 km (56 mi) to the south at the Vranica mountain. Its tributaries—the Suturlija, the Crkvena, and the Vrbanja—flow into the Vrbas at various points in the city. A number of springs can be found nearby.\n\nThe area around Banja Luka is mostly woodland and acre fields, although there are many mountains further from the city, especially south from the city. The most notable of these mountains are Ponir (743 m), Osmača (950 m), Manjača (1,214 m), Čemernica (1,338 m), and Tisovac (1,173 m). These are all part of the Dinaric Alps mountain range.\n\nSettlements\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city of Banja Luka (aside from city proper) includes the following settlements:\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nBanja Luka has a moderate humid subtropical climate with mild winters, infrequent frosts, and warm summers. The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of 22.5 °C (72.5 °F). The coldest month of the year is January, when temperatures average around 1.3 °C (34.3 °F).\n\nThe annual precipitation for the city is about 1,047.5 mm (41 in). Banja Luka has an average of 104 rainy days a year.[5] Due to the city's relatively high latitude and inland location, it snows in Banja Luka almost every year during the winter period. Strong winds can come from the north and northeast. Sometimes, southern winds bring hot air from the Adriatic sea.\n\nHighest recorded temperature: 41.8 °C (107.2 °F) on 10 August 2017[6]\n\nLowest recorded temperature:−23.5 °C (−10.3 °F) on 15 January 2003[6]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nRoman times\n\n[edit]\n\nThe history of inhabitation of the area of Banja Luka dates back to ancient times. There is substantial evidence of Roman presence in the region during the first few centuries A.D., including the fort \"Kastel\" (Latin: Castra) in the centre of the city. The area comprising Banja Luka was entirely in the kingdom of Illyria and then a part of the Roman province of Illyricum, which split into provinces of Pannonia and Dalmatia of which Castra became a part. Ancient Illyrian maps call the settlement in Banja Luka's present day location as Ad Ladios,[7] a settlement located on the river Vrbas.\n\nMiddle Ages\n\n[edit]\n\nSlavs settled in the Balkans in the 6th century. Mediaeval fortresses in the vicinity of Banja Luka include Vrbas (1224), Župa Zemljanik (1287), Kotor Varoš (1323), Zvečaj (1404), and Bočac (1446). In one document written by king Vladislav II on 6 February 1494 Juraj Mikulasić was mentioned as castellan of Banja Luka. Below the town was a smaller settlement with one Catholic monastery.[8]\n\nOttoman rule\n\n[edit]\n\nBanja Luka fell to the Ottomans in 1527. It became the seat of the Sanjak of Bosnia some time prior to 1554, until 1580 when the Bosnia Eyalet was established. Bosnian beylerbeys were seated in Banja Luka until 1639.[11] Ferhad Pasha Sokolović, a relative of Grand Vizier Mehmed-pasha Sokolović, had upon his return to Bosnia in 1574, begun the building of over 200 buildings ranging from artisan and sales shops to wheat warehouses, baths and mosques. Among more important commissions were the Ferhadija and Arnaudija mosques during whose construction plumbing infrastructure was laid out, that served surrounding residential areas.[12] This stimulated the economic and urban development of Banja Luka, which soon became one of the leading commercial and political centres in Bosnia. It was also the central sanjak in the Bosnia Eyalet. In 1688, the city was burned down by the Austrian army, but it quickly recovered. Later periodic intrusions by the Austrian army stimulated military developments in Banja Luka, which made it into a strategic military centre. Orthodox churches and monasteries near Banja Luka were built in the 19th century.\n\nIn the 19th century, Sephardic Jews and Trappists migrated to the city and contributed to the early industrialization of the region by building mills, breweries, brick factories, textile factories, and other important structures.[13] The Trappist monastery built in the 19th century lent its name to the neighbourhood of Trappisti and has left a large legacy in the area through its Trappist cheese and its beer production.[14][15]\n\nIn 1835 and 1836, during Ottoman administration, numerous people from Banja Luka emigrated to Lešnica, Lipnica, and Loznica, the villages around Loznica, and to Šabac.[16]\n\nAustro-Hungarian rule\n\n[edit]\n\nDespite its leading position in the region, Banja Luka as a city was not modernised until Austro-Hungarian occupation in the late 19th century. Railroads, schools, factories, and infrastructure appeared, and were developed, which turned Banja Luka into a modern city.\n\nYugoslavia\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter World War I, the town became the capital of the Vrbas Banovina, a province of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The provincial capital owed its rapid progress to the first Ban Svetislav Milosavljević. During that time, the Banski dvor and its twin sister, the Administration building, the Serbian Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity, a theatre and a museum were built, the Grammar School was renovated, the Teachers College enlarged, a city bridge was built and the park renovated. 125 elementary schools were functioning in Banja Luka in 1930. The revolutionary ideas of the time were incubated by the \"Pelagić\" association and the Students' Club. Banja Luka naturally became the organisational centre of anti-fascist work in the region.\n\nWorld War II\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring World War II, Banja Luka was occupied by Axis troops and was included into the Independent State of Croatia, a Nazi puppet-state led by Pavelić's Ustaše. Most of Banja Luka's Serbs and Jews were deported to concentration camps such as Jasenovac and Stara Gradiška. The Jasenovac camp was one of the largest extermination camps in Europe, which was notorious for its high mortality rate and the barbaric practices which occurred in it.[17][18] On 7 February 1942, Ustaše paramilitaries, led by a Franciscan friar, Miroslav Filipović (aka Tomislav Filipović-Majstorović), killed more than 2,300 Serbs (among them 500 children) in Drakulić, Motike and Šargovac (a part of the Banja Luka municipality).[19]\n\nThe city's Cathedral of Christ the Saviour and Orthodox church of the Holy Trinity were totally demolished by the Ustaše, as was the Church of St. George in Petrićevac. The Bishop of Banja Luka, Platon Jovanović, was arrested by the Ustaše on 5 May 1941, and was tortured and killed. His body was thrown into the Vrbanja river.[20] The city was liberated by the Yugoslav Partisans on 22 April 1945.\n\n1969 earthquake\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: 1969 Banja Luka earthquake\n\nOn 26 and 27 October 1969, two devastating earthquakes (6.0 and 6.4 on the Richter scale) damaged many buildings in Banja Luka. Around 20 to 23 people were killed, and over a thousand injured.[21] A large building called Titanik in the centre of the town was razed to the ground, and the area was later turned into a central public square.[22][23] With contributions from all over Yugoslavia, Banja Luka was repaired and rebuilt. During this period a large Serb population moved to the city from the surrounding villages, and from more distant areas in Herzegovina.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Demographics of Banja Luka\n\nThe 2013 census in Bosnia indicated a population of 185,042, overwhelmingly Serbs.[24][25][26]\n\nPopulation\n\n[edit]\n\nPopulation of settlements – Banja Luka municipality 1879 1885 1895 1910 1921 1931 1948 1953 1961 1971 1981 1991 2013 Total 158,736 183,618 195,692 185,042 Agino Selo 1,106 429 Banja Luka 9,560 11,357 13,566 14,800 18,001 22,165 31,223 38,135 50,650 90,831 123,937 143,079 138,963 Barlovci 624 685 Bistrica 1,703 1,367 Bočac 1,685 836 Borkovići 976 585 Bronzani Majdan 1,019 590 Debeljaci 1,073 1,190 Dragočaj 2,578 2,273 Drakulić 319 1,262 Goleši 827 369 Jagare 1,269 1,291 Kmećani 458 205 Kola 2,241 1,212 Kola Donja 757 413 Krmine 980 546 Krupa na Vrbasu 1,858 1,199 Kuljani 1,207 4,126 Ljubačevo 663 453 Melina 1,260 739 Motike 2,009 2,475 Obrovac 1,046 469 Pavići 607 262 Pavlovac 1,522 1,825 Pervan Donji 672 261 Piskavica 3,798 2,617 Potkozarje [Ivanjska] 4,577 2,965 Prijakovci 576 832 Priječani 840 1,992 Prnjavor Mali 309 374 Radosavska 514 268 Ramići 1,035 1,739 Rekavice 2,679 2,105 Šargovac 1,313 3,014 Slavićka 985 682 Stričići 464 208 Verići 1,237 1,041 Zalužani 561 629\n\nEthnic composition\n\n[edit]\n\nEthnic composition – Banja Luka city [27] 2013 1991 1981 1971 1953 1948 1921 1910 Total 138,963 (100%) 143,079 (100%) 123,937 (100%) 90,831 (100%) 38,135 (100%) 31,223 (100%) 18,001 (100%) 14,800 (100%) Serbs 121,185 (87,2%) 70,155 (49,0%) 51,839 (41,8%) 41,297 (45,5%) 15,299 (40,1%) 10,861 (34,8%) 5,324 (29,6%) 3,694 (25,0%) Bosniaks 7,573 (5,5%) 27,689 (19,4%) 20,916 (16,9%) 23,411 (25,8%) 9,800 (25,7%) 9,951 (31,9%) 7,201 (40,0%) 6,588 (44,5%) Croats 4,205 (3,0%) 15,700 (11,0%) 16,314 (13,2%) 17,897 (19,7%) 10,810 (28,3%) 8,662 (24,6%) 4,718 (26,2%) 3,930 (26,6%) Unaffiliated 2,520 (1,8%) 2,226 (5,8%) 1,749 (5,6%) 672 (3,5%) 366 (2,5%) Jews 222 (1,5%) Others 1,418 (1,0%) 6,890 (4,8%) 2,570 (2,1%) 2,014 (2,2%) Yugoslavs 615 (0,4%) 22,645 (15,8%) 30,318 (24,5%) 4,606 (5,1%) Ukrainians 396 (0,3%) Montenegrins 321 (0,2%) 695 (0,6%) 600 (0,7%) Unknown 232 (0,2%) Slovenes 215 (0,2%) 456 (0,4%) 636 (0,7%) Roma 129 (0,09%) 499 (0,4%) 59 (0,07%) Macedonians 126 (0,09%) 172 (0,14%) 177 (0,2%) Albanians 28 (0,02%) 158 (0,13%) 134 (0,15%)\n\nEthnic composition – Banja Luka municipality 2013 1991 1981 1971 Total 185,042 (100%) 195,692 (100%) 183,618 (100%) 158,736 (100%) Serbs 165,750 (89,6%) 106,826 (54,6%) 93,389 (50,9%) 92,465 (58,3%) Bosniaks 7,681 (4,2%) 28,558 (14,6%) 21,726 (11,8%) 24,268 (15,3%) Croats 5,104 (2,8%) 29,026 (14,8%) 30,442 (16,6%) 33,371 (21,0%) Unaffiliated 2,733 (1,5%) Others 1,521 (0,8%) 7,626 (3,9%) 3,370 (1,8%) 2,275 (1,4%) Yugoslavs 648 (0,4%) 23,656 (12,1%) 32,624 (17,8%) 4,684 (3,0%) Ukrainians 413 (0,2%) Unknown 337 (0,2%) Montenegrins 335 (0,2%) 715 (0,4%) 612 (0,4%) Slovenes 230 (0,1%) 495 (0,3%) 685 (0,4%) Roma 132 (0,07%) 503 (0,3%) 59 (0,04%) Macedonians 130 (0,07%) 189 (0,1%) 178 (0,1%) Albanians 28 (0,02%) 165 (0,09%) 139 (0,09%)\n\n[28]\n\nGovernment\n\n[edit]\n\nBanja Luka plays an important role on different levels of Bosnia and Herzegovina's government structures. Banja Luka is the centre of the government for the Municipality of Banja Luka. A number of entity and state institutions are seated in the city. The Republika Srpska Government and the National Assembly are based in Banja Luka.[29]\n\nThe Bosnia and Herzegovina State Agencies based in the city include the Indirect Taxation Authority, the Deposit Insurance Agency as well as a branch of the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina (formerly the National Bank of Republika Srpska). Austria, Croatia, France, Germany, Serbia, the United Kingdom and the United States maintain diplomatic representation through consulates-general in Banja Luka.[30]\n\nAs of 2021, the mayor is Draško Stanivuković of the Party of Democratic Progress, elected in 2020.\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1981, Banja Luka's GDP per capita was 97% of the Yugoslav average.[31]\n\nAlthough the city itself was not directly affected by the Bosnian war in the early 1990s, its economy was. In this period Banja Luka fell behind the world in key areas such as technology, with socially owned technology firms such as SOUR Rudi Čajavec collapsing, resulting in a rather stagnant economy. However, in recent years, the financial services sector has gained in importance in the city. In 2002, the trading began on the newly established Banja Luka Stock Exchange. The number of companies listed, the trading volume and the number of investors have increased significantly. A number of big companies such as Telekom Srpske, Rafinerija ulja Modriča, Banjalučka Pivara and Vitaminka are all listed on the exchange and are traded regularly. Investors, apart from those from Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia, now include a number of investment funds from the EU, and from Norway, the United States, Japan and China.\n\nA number of financial services regulators, such as the Republika Srpska Securities Commission and the RS Banking Agency are headquartered in Banja Luka. This, along with the fact that some of the major banks in Bosnia, the Deposit Insurance Agency and the value-added tax (VAT) authority are all based in the city, has helped Banja Luka establish itself as a major financial centre of the country.[citation needed]\n\nEconomic summary\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following table gives a summary of total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2018):[32]\n\nActivity Total % Wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles 12,579 18% Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities 788 1% Transportation and storage 2,747 4% Real estate activities 318 0% Public administration and defense; compulsory social security 9,162 13% Professional, scientific and technical activities 3,900 6% Other service activities 1,968 3% Mining and quarrying 25 0% Manufacturing 8,972 13% Information and communication 3,567 5% Human health and social work activities 5,948 9% Financial and insurance activities 3,212 5% Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply 817 1% Education 5,301 8% Construction 3,241 5% Arts, entertainment and recreation 1,760 3% Agriculture, forestry and fishing 586 1% Administrative and support service activities 1,368 2% Accommodation and food services 3,564 5% Total 69,283 100%\n\nCulture\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Museum of Republika Srpska inherited the Ethnographic Museum established in 1930,[33][34] and broadened its setting with collections of archeology, history, art history and nature. The Museum of Modern Art of Republika Srpska, also called MSURS, the Museum of Contemporary Art, displays exhibitions of both domestic and worldwide artists.[35]\n\nBanja Luka is home to the National Theatre[36] and National Library,[37][38] both dating from the first half of the 20th century, and of numerous other theatres. The headquarters of the Archives of Republika Srpska is situated in the building known as Carska kuća or Imperial House, built around 1880. It has been in continuous public use longer than any other structure in Banja Luka.\n\nOne of the best-known cultural sites in Banja Luka is the cultural centre of \"Banski Dvor\" (Halls of the Ban), built in the 1930s as the residence for the Bans of the Vrbas Banovina.[39][40]\n\nThere is a number of Cultural Artistic Associations in the city. The oldest is CAA \"Pelagić\" (founded 1927), one of the oldest institutions of this kind in Bosnia and Herzegovina.[41]\n\nSport\n\n[edit]\n\nBanja Luka has one major football stadium and several indoor sports halls. The local handball, basketball and football teams bear the traditional name Borac (fighter). There are sixteen football clubs in the city,[42] with the most notable being Luka are Borac Banja Luka (2020–2021 season champions of Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina), BSK Banja Luka, and Omladinac Banja Luka (both in the First League of the Republika Srpska), FK Naprijed Banja Luka and FK Vrbas Banja Luka\n\nFK Borac Banja Luka is one of the most popular football club in the Republika Srpska. The club has won several major trophies in its history such as trophies as a champion of Mitropa Cup, Yugoslav Cup, Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bosnia and Herzegovina Football Cup, First League of the Republika Srpska, Republic Srpska Cup. The club has participated in UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League.[43]\n\nThe city has a long tradition of handball. RK Borac Banja Luka was the European Champion in 1976, the European Vice-Champion in 1975 and the winner of the IHF Cup in 1991.[44]\n\nThe local tennis tournament, \"Memorijal Trive Vujića\", has become professional and has been awarded ATP status in 2001, with the rank of a Challenger. The Banja Luka Challenger takes place in September each year. In 2006, the Davis Cup matches of the Europe/Africa Zone Group III took place in the city. In April 2023, Banja Luka was host to the 2023 Srpska Open tournament, as part of the 2023 ATP Tour.[45]\n\nSince 2015, the city hosts the Banjaluka Half-marathon.[46]\n\nIn 2005 and 2019 the European Championships in Rafting were held on the Vrbas river.[47][48]\n\nBanja Luka was designated European city of sport in 2018.[49]\n\nTransport\n\n[edit]\n\nPublic transportation within Banja Luka is exclusively operated by the bus services. 23 bus lines[50] stretch across the city, connecting the downtown to the rest of the city and its suburbs. The oldest bus link in the city is line No 1. Taxis are also readily available. The expressway E-661 (locally known as M-16) leads north to Croatia from Banja Luka by way of Gradiška, near the Bosnian/Croatian border. A wide range of bus services are available to most neighbouring and larger towns in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as to regional and European destinations such as Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Germany, France, Italy, Montenegro, The Netherlands, Serbia, Sweden, Switzerland and Slovakia.\n\nBanja Luka is a minor hub of the railway services of Željeznice Republike Srpske, which comprises one half of the railway network of Bosnia and Herzegovina.[51] Services operate to most northern Bosnian towns, and two modern air-conditioned 'Talgo' trains run to Sarajevo every day. However, services are relatively slow and infrequent compared with neighbouring countries.\n\nBanja Luka International Airport (IATA: BNX, ICAO: LQBK) is located 23 km (14 mi) north of Banja Luka. The airport is served by Air Serbia, which operates flights to Belgrade and summer charters to Antalya and Athens, while Ryanair operates flights to Bergamo, Berlin, Brussels, Gothenburg, Stockholm-Arlanda Airport, Memmingen, Frankfurt–Hahn and Vienna. There is also Banja Luka Zalužani Airfield, a small airstrip.\n\nPublic transport\n\n[edit]\n\nBanja Luka overwhelmingly relies on a network of buses for its public transport. The following bus lines exist in the city:[50]\n\n1 - Mađir - Ortopedija - Nova bolnica\n\n3 - Centar (Vodovod) - Vrbanja - Zeleni vir\n\n3B - Centar (Vodovod) - Debeljaci\n\n6 - Autobuska stanica - Lauš - Saračica\n\n7 - Lauš - Paprikovac - Centar - Obilićevo (TO Bema)\n\n8 - Autobuska stanica - Podgora\n\n9 - Česma - Centar - Desna novoselija\n\n9B - Česma - Medeno polje - Centar\n\n10 - Autobuska stanica - Obilićevo\n\n12 - Centar - Paprikovac (vidik)\n\n13 - Lazarevo - Obilićevo\n\n13A - Nova bolnica - Centar - Zalužani\n\n13B - Novo groblje - Lazarevo (Poslovna škola)\n\n13C - Centar - Tunjice - Zalužani\n\n13P - Obilićevo (Krfska ulica) - Petrićevac\n\n14 - Starčevica - Centar - Starčevica\n\n14B - Autobuska stanica - Borik - Starčevica\n\n17 - Obilićevo - Nova bolnica\n\n17A - Starčevica - Nova bolnica\n\n19 - Šargovac - Centar (Vidovdanska)\n\n20 - Autobuska stanica - Centar - Paprikovac (Ul. Ranka Šipke)\n\n39 - Drakulić (Vrtače) - Centar\n\n39A - Drakulić (avion) - Rakovačke bare - Centar\n\nIn addition to those, there are 34 suburban lines. A single-use bus ticket costs 2.3 convertible marks, while a day ticket that allows unlimited transfers costs 7.1 marks.[50] Pensioners and citizens older than 65 enjoy free transit.[52] The bus system faces several challenges, including the city government's debt to the private carriers[53] and the vehicles' advanced age.[54]\n\nInternational relations\n\n[edit]\n\nTwin towns – Sister cities\n\n[edit]\n\nBanja Luka is twinned with the following cities:[55]\n\nPartner cities\n\n[edit]\n\nNotable people\n\n[edit]\n\nGorica Aćimović, Serbian-Austrian handballer\n\nSrđan Babić, Serbian footballer, World U-20 champion\n\nMarijan Beneš, Serbian boxer and poet, European amateur and professional champion, Yugoslav Boxer of the 20th century[59]\n\nMladen Bojinović, Serbian handball player, World Championship bronze medalist\n\nNikola Ćaćić, Serbian tennis player\n\nSaša Čađo, Serbian basketball player, Olympic bronze medalist and European champion\n\nAdem Čejvan, Bosnian actor\n\nRadenko Dobraš (born 1968), Serbian basketball player\n\nNela Eržišnik, Croatian actress and comedian\n\nMuhamed Filipović, Bosnian academic, philosopher and writer\n\nSlađana Golić, Serbian basketball player, Olympic and World Championships silver medalist\n\nSrđan Grahovac, Serbian footballer\n\nAnton Josipović, Serbian boxer, Olympic champion\n\nBožidar Jović, Serbian handball player\n\nIvan Franjo Jukić, Bosnian writer\n\nNasiha Kapidžić-Hadžić, Bosnian writer and poet\n\nOsman Karabegović, politician\n\nMilorad Karalić, Serbian handball player, Olympic champion\n\nTomislav Knez, football player, Olympic champion and European Championship silver medalist\n\nAleksandar Knežević, Serbian handball player, European Championship bronze medalist\n\nPetar Kočić, Serbian writer\n\nFranjo Komarica, Roman Catholic Bishop of Banja Luka\n\nAbid Kovačević, retired footballer\n\nDJ Krmak, Serbian singer\n\nIvan Ljubičić, Croatian tennis player, World No. 3 and Olympic bronze medalist\n\nSaša Lošić, Serbian singer and composer\n\nDarko Maletić, Serbian footballer\n\nDraženko Mitrović, Serbian athlete, two-time Paralympic silver medalist and European champion\n\nIvan Merz, Catholic lay academic; beatified by Pope John Paul II\n\nZlatan Muslimović, Bosnian footballer\n\nMustafa Nadarević, actor\n\nRomana Panić, Serbian singer\n\nNikola Pejaković, Serbian actor and musician\n\nZlatko Saračević, Croatian handball player, Olympic and World champion\n\nMarija Šestić, Serbian singer\n\nVelimir Sombolac, Serbian football player and manager, Olympic champion\n\nNeven Subotić, Serbian footballer\n\nOgnjen Vranješ, Serbian footballer\n\nSrđan Vujmilović, photographer\n\nSredoje Zekanović, director of Bokserski klub Slavija Banja Luka, director of Yugoslavia national boxing team[60]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina portal"
