        "text": "The former champion Andy Roddick crashed out of the US Open in the second round – but did not go quietly as he ranted at the officials over a foot fault.\n\nRoddick was serving at 5-2 down in the third set against Serbia's Janko Tipsarevic when a line judge called the fault on what would have been an ace.\n\nThe ninth seed appeared to ask the female official if it was his right foot which caused the fault and was told it was, when in fact it was his left foot which touched the line. \"Not once in my career has my right foot gone in front of my left foot, never. That is unbelievable,\" Roddick complained. \"Why don't you get some umpires who know what they are doing? 1-800-rent-a-ref.\"\n\nThe 28-year-old's tirade went on for some time, although he stopped short of the infamous foul-mouthed outburst by Serena Williams which occurred during last year's semi-final against Kim Clijsters.\n\nHowever, he did tell the umpire Enrique Molina \"I think you and I both know that's ridiculous\", as he left the court to change his shorts after the fourth set. Tipsarevic won that set 6–3 and went on to seal a 3-6, 7-5, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) victory to book his place in the third round.\n\nRoddick admitted he had gone \"too far\" with his tirade, adding: \"I wasn't upset with the call, I just expect my umpires to know their left foot from the right foot. The stubbornness ... I let mine get in the way. I got called for two others after that and have no issue with it. In the moment I was just stupefied.\n\n\"It's the fact I couldn't get her to admit it wasn't the right foot which infuriated me, the lack of common sense was unbelievable to me. We have got to be able to have a test like 'Point to your right foot, point to your left foot, now call lines'.\n\n\"In hindsight did I let it go too far? Probably. It was probably a correctable mistake and I let it get to me more than I should have.\"\n\nHowever, Roddick refused to blame his defeat on the incident, which came just two days after he celebrated his 28th birthday with a comfortable victory in the first round. \"I was down 5-2 in the third set already, if anything it shifted the energy a little bit and after that I played OK,\" he added.\n\n\"It had zero impact in the match, it's not like I was up. I'm sure a lot's going to get written about it but the actual impact on the match was close to zero. At that point any change in energy was a good change for me. He [Tipsarevic] played great tonight. He played very high risk and executed for four sets. I kept telling myself this has to have an expiration date on it but unfortunately I needed another set for that. He deserved to win tonight.\"\n\nThe Wimbledon finalist Tomas Berdych also crashed out of the US Open, the Czech losing his first-round match against France's Michael Llodra.\n\nThe world No35 Llodra just missed out on being seeded for the main draw, but proved why he was a player many of the seeds wanted to avoid with a 7-6, 6-4, 6-4 victory.\n\nThe 30-year-old left-hander had lost in the first round in 22 of his previous 36 grand slam singles events, but drove the seventh seed Berdych to distraction with his serve-and-volley tactics.\n\n\"I don't know whether I played well or not,\" complained Berdych, who knocked out the defending champion Roger Federer in the quarter-finals at Wimbledon but lost in straight sets to Rafael Nadal in the final. \"I had no chance to play on my terms. I don't see what I could have done better or differently.\"\n\nLlodra will play Victor Hanescu in the second round after the unseeded Romanian beat Carlos Berlocq of Argentina 6-2, 6-4, 6-3.\n\nThe 15th seed Ivan Ljubicic of Croatia was beaten in four sets by 18-year-old American qualifier Ryan Harrison. \"The weather was my biggest enemy today,\" admitted the 31-year-old Ljubicic. \"Throughout my career I [have] struggled with the heat. Today was no different.\n\n\"I sweat a lot and I just feel really bad. I mean, I can't move. It gets to me really quickly actually. Already in the first set I was struggling with it. It's really a physical problem.\""
