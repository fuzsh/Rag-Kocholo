        "text": "Jannik Sinner reached the final as a wild card at the Next Gen ATP Finals in Milan after a four-set win over Miomir Kezmanovic in the semifinal. The world number 95 scored his third win this week after beating Frances Tiafoe and Mikael Ymer in the first two round robin matches. Despite a defeat against Ugo Humbert the 18-year-old Italian player finished at the top of the round-robin Group B.\n\nSinner’s win was the perfect birthday present for his coach Riccardo Piatti, who turned 61 on Friday.\n\n“The Milan crowd is unbelievable. Fans are fantastic. I wanted to give a present for Riccardo’s birthday. I hope that I will be able to offer him another present after the final. I didn’t feel so well at the beginning. Kezmanovic was playing very good and very aggressive. I have never had this kind of feeling, so I am happy. My next opponent Alex De Minaur played an unbelievable season. He is a very solid player. He has won three ATP tournaments. I will just try my best”, said Sinner.\n\nSinner is the rising star of Italian tennis and is the youngest player in the top 100 of the ATP Ranking. The player from Sesto Pusteria in Sudtyrol, who was born on 16th August 2001, became the youngest Italian player in history to win a Challenger tournament in Bergamo last February. He followed up with several ITF Futures tournaments in Trento and Santa Margherita di Pula and a second Challenger title in Lexington last August. He is one of the eleven players in the world to win at least two ATP Challengers before they turned 18.\n\n“Something changed in Bergamo. I played good there, I gained confidence and have kept going”, said Sinner.\n\nSinner started his sports career in skiing but chose tennis at the age of 13 and left home in 2014 to train in Bordighera. Jannik is grateful to his parents for allowing him to leave home as a child and pursue his dream. Jannik started playing tennis at the age of seven because his father really liked tennis. Jannik’s first idol growing up was Roger Federer. He credits Riccardo Piatti, Massimo Sartori (the coach of Andreas Seppi and a member of Sinner’s coaching team) and his first coach Heribert Mayr for helping him grow as a player.\n\nSinner started the year ranked world number 551 and made a huge step forward in his career under the guidance of Riccardo Piatti and Andrea Volpini at the Piatti Tennis Centre in Bordighera. Piatti previously coached Ivan Ljubicic, Milos Raonic, Richard Gasquet and Borna Coric and is now working with Maria Sharapova, who will train in Bordighera during the off-season to prepare for the 2020 season.\n\n“Jannik comes from a family with a great culture of work. His father serves as a chef in a chalet in Val Pusteria and his mother works as a waitress in the same place. His elder brother Mark works in Brunico. They have always supported their son’s choices. Jannik is the son every family would dream to have”, said Riccardo Piatti.\n\nSinner has made his first experience on the ATP Tour last April at the Hungarian Open in Budapest, where he notched his first ATP Tour level win over Mate Valkusz. One week later he reached his second career ATP Challenger final in Ostrava, before losing to Kamil Majchrzak in the title match.\n\nLast May Sinner scored his first ATP Masters 1000 win at the Internazionali BNL d’Italia in Rome beating Steve Johnson before losing to Stefanos Tsitsipas in the second round. Later this year he qualified for his first Grand Slam Main Draw by winning three matches at the US Open qualifying tournament. He lost to three-time Grand Slam champion Stan Wawrinka in four sets in the first round at Flushing Meadows.\n\nDuring the autumn indoor season Jannik became the youngest male tennis player in five years to reach the semifinal at an ATP Tour tournament in Antwerp after beating Gael Monfils. He then received another wild card to play in the main draw of the Erste Bank Open in Vienna, where he won his opening match against German veteran Phillip Kohlschreiber to break into the top 100 for the first time in his career.\n\n“I think I have improved everything. We are just improving day after day. That’s our main goal and the results will come. I have to commit myself to improve. In all matches the head is the only thing you can control. Many times you do not control your shots or the opponent, but the head is always with you. The victories give confidence. When I beat Monfils in Antwerp, I understood where I can go. The defeats serve to learn. Among my best matches, I put the loss in four sets against Stan Wawrinka in the first round of the US Open. It was a test to understand at what point I was and I played well”.\n\nThe main goals of the Next Gen Finals are to promote a new generation of tennis players and inspire young fans. Many young children are packing the stands of the Palalido Allianz Cloud creating a thrilling atmosphere inside the indoor arena in the heart of Milan. Sinner is aiming at becoming an inspiration for younger Italian players, who are dreaming to follow in the footsteps.\n\n“The young generation is growing and that’s important for tennis. I am trying my best. The younger guys in Italy are all improving a lot, so hopefully I am giving them a little bit of inspiration. I enjoy the spotlight. I think it’s something new. The fans are just trying to cheer for me. Sometimes guys as me are coming up and asking for photos or autographs. It’s strange but it feels good”,concluded Sinner.\n\nHolger Rune will have a second medical opinion on Monday before deciding if he is fit enough to play at the Olympic Games, according to his team.\n\nThe Danish world No.17 recently retired from his quarter-final match at the Hamburg Open due to a knee injury. The hope at the time was that his withdrawal would be just a precautionary measure ahead of the Olympics. However, he is also dealing with a second issue that appears to be more serious.\n\nAccording to TV 2 Sport, Rune has been struggling with a wrist issue and underwent a scan on Sunday which his mother Aneke says ‘doesn’t look promising.’ Aneke is also the manager of her son’s career. Rune’s Olympic dreams now rest on the outcome of a second medical expert that he will visit tomorrow who has a better understanding of the sport.\n\n“Unfortunately, it does not look promising after the first medical opinion after the review of the scan of the wrist,” Aneke Rune told TV 2 Sport.\n\n“We are waiting for two tennis-specific doctors who will give a second opinion tomorrow (Monday). Tennis wrists look different from regular wrists, so we’ll hold out hope for one more day.”\n\nRune is one of three Danish players entered into the Olympic tennis event along with Caroline Wozniacki and Clara Tauson. The country has only won one medal in tennis before which was at the 1912 Games when Sofie Castenschiold won silver in the women’s indoor singles event.\n\nSo far this season, the 21-year-old has won 27 matches on the Tour but is yet to claim a title. He reached the final of the Brisbane International and then the semi-finals of three more events. In the Grand Slams, he made it to the fourth round of the French Open and Wimbledon.\n\nIt is not known when a final decision regarding Rune’s participation in Paris will be made.\n\nNovak Djokovic has broken numerous records throughout his career but he still feels the pressure of trying to make history in the sport.\n\nThe world No.2 is through to his 10th Wimbledon final where he will play Carlos Alcaraz, who beat him at this stage of the tournament 12 months ago. There is plenty on the line for the Serbian who could equal Roger Federer’s record for most men’s titles won at SW19 and break the overall record for most major singles won in the sport if he triumphs over the Spaniard. Djokovic currently has 24 Grand Slam trophies to his name which is the same as Margaret Court, who won some of her titles before the Open Era started.\n\n“Obviously I’m aware that Roger [Federer] holds eight Wimbledons. I hold seven. History is on the line.” Djokovic said on Friday after beating Lorenzo Musetti.\n\n“Also, the 25th potential Grand Slam. Of course, it serves as a great motivation, but at the same time it’s also a lot of pressure and expectations.”\n\nComing into Wimbledon, there had been doubts over Djokovic’s form after he underwent surgery to treat a knee injury he suffered at the French Open. However, he has defied the odds to reach the final. His run has also seen him beat Alexi Popyrin and Holger Rune before getting a walkover in the quarter-finals from Alex de Minaur, who sustained an injury during the tournament. Then on Friday, he overcame a spirited Musetti in three sets.\n\nDespite the challenge, Djokovic has insisted that his expectations to do well are always high no matter what the situation is. During what has been a roller-coaster first six months of the season, he is yet to win a title this year or beat a player currently ranked in the top 10. Although he will achieve both of these if her beats Alcaraz on Sunday.\n\n“Every time I step out on the court now, even though I’m 37 and competing with the 21-year-olds, I still expect myself to win most of the matches, and people expect me to win, whatever, 99% of the matches that I play.” He said.\n\n“I always have to come out on the court and perform my best in order to still be at the level with Carlos [Alcaraz] or Jannik [Sinner] or Sascha [Zverev] or any of those guys, Daniil [Medvedev].\n\n“This year hasn’t been that successful for me. It’s probably the weakest results the first six months I’ve had in many years. That’s okay. I had to adapt and accept that and really try to find also way out from the injury that I had and kind of regroup.”\n\nDjokovic hopes that a Wimbledon win will help turn his season around like it has done in the past for him.\n\n“Wimbledon historically there’s been seasons where I wasn’t maybe playing at a desired level, but then I would win a Wimbledon title and then things would change.” He commented.\n\n“For example, that was the case in 2018 when I had elbow surgery earlier in the year, dropped my rankings out of top 20, losing in fourth round of Australian Open, I think it was quarters of Roland-Garros, and just not playing the tennis that I want to play. Then I won Wimbledon and then won US Open and then later on became No.1 very soon.”\n\nMeanwhile, 21-year-old Alcaraz is hoping to stop Djokovic in his tracks. Should he defend his title at Wimbledon, he would become the first player outside the Big Three to do so since Pete Sampras more than 20 years ago. He has won their only previous meeting on the grass but trails their head-to-head 3-2.\n\n“I’m sure he knows what he has to do to beat me,” said Alcaraz.\n\n“But I’m ready to take that challenge and I’m ready to do it well.”\n\nWhen the two players take to the court to play in the Wimbledon final, Djokovic will be 15 years and 348 days older than Alcaraz. Making it the largest age gap in a men’s Grand Slam final since the 1974 US Open. Whoever is victorious will receive £2,700,000 in prize money."
