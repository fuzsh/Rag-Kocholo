        "text": "Ivan Ljubicic has said his commitment to working with Roger Federer is ‘unquestionable’ as he confirms that he will leave coaching after their partnership ends.\n\nThe 41-year-old Croat, who has been a member of Federer’s team since 2016, has his sights set on working full-time in a new venture he has set up. He is the co-founder of the LJ Sports Group, which is an agency that focuses on ‘enabling professional athletes to focus solely on training and their performance on the field, while we take care of every other thing regarding their career.’ Among his clients are top 20 player Borna Coria and Marta Kostyuk.\n\n“Roger will be my last coaching job. My commitment to this project after Roger is absolute,” Ljubicic told Novi List.\n\n“But Roger and I go further, my work with him is unquestionable and there are no problems there.”\n\n“After his career, I can dedicate myself one hundred percent to what makes me happy. Then I will be able to help the players in a way that we judge to be the best. At the moment, as far as the coaching part of the job is concerned, it’s exclusively Roger. The rest is marketing and sponsorship,” he added.\n\nLjubicic will have some extra time to work on his company this year after Federer pulled the plug on his 2020 season following his second knee operation. The Swiss tennis star has only played in two tournaments this year with his most recent being back in January at the Australian Open. Despite his lengthy absence from the Tour, Federer will not be spiralling down the rankings thanks to a change in the rules due to the pandemic. A players ranking position are now based on their best 18 tournament performances over the past 22 months instead of 12.\n\nDespite the blip, Federer is determined to return to action at the start of next year when he will be 39-years-old. At present, he is the second oldest player in the top 200 on the ATP Tour after Ivo Karlovic. The last time Federer ended his season early was in 2016 where he returned to winning ways the following year by winning the Australian Open.\n\n“Everything is under control. We are planning the next season,” coach Ljubicic commented. “It is a wish and a dream for everything to be like in 2017, but it is clear that every situation is new. Anyway, we have one positive experience so we are all positive.”\n\nFederer currently holds the record for most Grand Slam titles at 20. Although it is possible that rival Rafael Nadal could surpass his tally in 2020 if he wins both the US Open and French Open. Meanwhile Novak Djokovic, who is the youngest of the Big Three, is closing in with 17 major titles to his name.\n\nRegardless of what happens to Federer’s Grand Slam record, Ljubicic believes too much focus is being placed on it. Saying the current world No.4 continues to play due to his love for the sport. Federer last won a Grand Slam at the 2018 Australian Open and has only managed to reach one final (Wimbledon 2019) since then.\n\n“Everyone is a little too focused on Grand Slam titles. They are the biggest tournaments in our sport, but they are not the only valuable thing,” he said.\n\n“We can measure everything with them, but we’re not all crazy about Grand Slams. What is the case with Federer is that he loves sports and will play as much as he can.’\n\n“We will do everything to get the result, but that is not the only reason why he still plays and wants to play. But it’s clear to me that there are people who can’t understand that.”\n\nDuring his playing career Ljubicic won 10 ATP titles and earned more than $10 million in prize money.\n\nHolger Rune will have a second medical opinion on Monday before deciding if he is fit enough to play at the Olympic Games, according to his team.\n\nThe Danish world No.17 recently retired from his quarter-final match at the Hamburg Open due to a knee injury. The hope at the time was that his withdrawal would be just a precautionary measure ahead of the Olympics. However, he is also dealing with a second issue that appears to be more serious.\n\nAccording to TV 2 Sport, Rune has been struggling with a wrist issue and underwent a scan on Sunday which his mother Aneke says ‘doesn’t look promising.’ Aneke is also the manager of her son’s career. Rune’s Olympic dreams now rest on the outcome of a second medical expert that he will visit tomorrow who has a better understanding of the sport.\n\n“Unfortunately, it does not look promising after the first medical opinion after the review of the scan of the wrist,” Aneke Rune told TV 2 Sport.\n\n“We are waiting for two tennis-specific doctors who will give a second opinion tomorrow (Monday). Tennis wrists look different from regular wrists, so we’ll hold out hope for one more day.”\n\nRune is one of three Danish players entered into the Olympic tennis event along with Caroline Wozniacki and Clara Tauson. The country has only won one medal in tennis before which was at the 1912 Games when Sofie Castenschiold won silver in the women’s indoor singles event.\n\nSo far this season, the 21-year-old has won 27 matches on the Tour but is yet to claim a title. He reached the final of the Brisbane International and then the semi-finals of three more events. In the Grand Slams, he made it to the fourth round of the French Open and Wimbledon.\n\nIt is not known when a final decision regarding Rune’s participation in Paris will be made.\n\nPoland’s top player on the ATP Tour is not giving up on his dream of winning a medal at the Olympic Games despite recently undergoing a medical procedure.\n\nWorld No.7 Hubert Hurkacz suffered a knee injury during his second round clash at Wimbledon against France’s Arthur Fils. In the fourth set tiebreak of their clash, Hurkacz dived for a shot but landed badly on his knee and required on-court medical attention. He then played two more points before retiring from the match.\n\nIn a social media post published on Wednesday, the 27-year-old confirmed he underwent a procedure on his knee earlier this week but didn’t provide any further details. Although Hurkacz has stated his intention to play at the upcoming Olympic Games in Paris, where the tennis event will be held on the clay at Roland Garros.\n\n“I had a knee procedure this Monday, but I’m feeling better already and my team and are dedicating extensive time each day to the rehab process.” He wrote on Instagram.\n\n“It’s a dream for every athlete to represent their country at the Olympics, and I want to make sure I am fully fit and ready before making the final decision to step on court. The aim is not only to participate, but to win a medal for my country.”\n\nSo far this season Hurkacz has won 34 out of 48 matches played on the Tour. He won the Estoril Open in April and was runner-up to Jannik Sinner in Halle.\n\nThe Olympic tennis event is scheduled to begin a week Saturday on July 27th. Poland is yet to win a medal in the event but expectations are high with women’s No.1 Iga Swiatek also taking part.\n\nNovak Djokovic has broken numerous records throughout his career but he still feels the pressure of trying to make history in the sport.\n\nThe world No.2 is through to his 10th Wimbledon final where he will play Carlos Alcaraz, who beat him at this stage of the tournament 12 months ago. There is plenty on the line for the Serbian who could equal Roger Federer’s record for most men’s titles won at SW19 and break the overall record for most major singles won in the sport if he triumphs over the Spaniard. Djokovic currently has 24 Grand Slam trophies to his name which is the same as Margaret Court, who won some of her titles before the Open Era started.\n\n“Obviously I’m aware that Roger [Federer] holds eight Wimbledons. I hold seven. History is on the line.” Djokovic said on Friday after beating Lorenzo Musetti.\n\n“Also, the 25th potential Grand Slam. Of course, it serves as a great motivation, but at the same time it’s also a lot of pressure and expectations.”\n\nComing into Wimbledon, there had been doubts over Djokovic’s form after he underwent surgery to treat a knee injury he suffered at the French Open. However, he has defied the odds to reach the final. His run has also seen him beat Alexi Popyrin and Holger Rune before getting a walkover in the quarter-finals from Alex de Minaur, who sustained an injury during the tournament. Then on Friday, he overcame a spirited Musetti in three sets.\n\nDespite the challenge, Djokovic has insisted that his expectations to do well are always high no matter what the situation is. During what has been a roller-coaster first six months of the season, he is yet to win a title this year or beat a player currently ranked in the top 10. Although he will achieve both of these if her beats Alcaraz on Sunday.\n\n“Every time I step out on the court now, even though I’m 37 and competing with the 21-year-olds, I still expect myself to win most of the matches, and people expect me to win, whatever, 99% of the matches that I play.” He said.\n\n“I always have to come out on the court and perform my best in order to still be at the level with Carlos [Alcaraz] or Jannik [Sinner] or Sascha [Zverev] or any of those guys, Daniil [Medvedev].\n\n“This year hasn’t been that successful for me. It’s probably the weakest results the first six months I’ve had in many years. That’s okay. I had to adapt and accept that and really try to find also way out from the injury that I had and kind of regroup.”\n\nDjokovic hopes that a Wimbledon win will help turn his season around like it has done in the past for him.\n\n“Wimbledon historically there’s been seasons where I wasn’t maybe playing at a desired level, but then I would win a Wimbledon title and then things would change.” He commented.\n\n“For example, that was the case in 2018 when I had elbow surgery earlier in the year, dropped my rankings out of top 20, losing in fourth round of Australian Open, I think it was quarters of Roland-Garros, and just not playing the tennis that I want to play. Then I won Wimbledon and then won US Open and then later on became No.1 very soon.”\n\nMeanwhile, 21-year-old Alcaraz is hoping to stop Djokovic in his tracks. Should he defend his title at Wimbledon, he would become the first player outside the Big Three to do so since Pete Sampras more than 20 years ago. He has won their only previous meeting on the grass but trails their head-to-head 3-2.\n\n“I’m sure he knows what he has to do to beat me,” said Alcaraz.\n\n“But I’m ready to take that challenge and I’m ready to do it well.”\n\nWhen the two players take to the court to play in the Wimbledon final, Djokovic will be 15 years and 348 days older than Alcaraz. Making it the largest age gap in a men’s Grand Slam final since the 1974 US Open. Whoever is victorious will receive £2,700,000 in prize money."
