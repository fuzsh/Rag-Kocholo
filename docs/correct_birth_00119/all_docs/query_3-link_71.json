        "text": "“Why does Roger continue to compete on the Tour? This is a question you must ask him,” the coach added.\n\n“I only try to make it work as hard as I can and I'm happy to have it so motivated.\n\n“He loves sports, even when he is not in the field: we watch it together, we play with the boys: I have two, a son and a daughter, he has four, in short, we don't get bored. I hope it will go on for a long time yet.”\n\nFederer has already streamlined his calendar to preserve his ageing body after over two decades on the tour.\n\nThe Basel-born star is currently preparing for the 2020 campaign with some warm-weather training in Dubai.\n\n“There is a lot of tennis and a lot of physical work, every day is a little different,” Ljubicic explained.\n\n“Now we are building the base, it is not as easy as when he had only one real 'off-season' and in the rest of the season he was sent, now he has to take many small little breaks.\n\n“This part of the season, for Roger, is therefore no different from April or summer, when it comes off for two or three weeks.\n\n“Work, work, work: I know that sometimes it seems that everything is easy, but without hard work there is no success.”"
