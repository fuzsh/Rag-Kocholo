        "text": "Our Lady's Messages\n\n1981-2024\n\nThe messages given by Our Lady in Medjugorje began on June 25, 1981, and continue to this day. The earliest messages from 1981-1983, recorded by the parish in Medjugorje (Information Center MIR Medjugorje, www.medjugorje.hr), were unfortunately confiscated and destroyed by the communists.\n\nThe 1981-1983 messages found here were obtained from the works of Fr. RenÃ© Laurentin, and Professor RenÃ© LeJeune. They were originally recorded in French, and translated into English by Juan Gonzales Jr., Ph.D. Although these messages have not been validated by the parish in Medjugorje, great care was taken in their recording, translation, and compilation.\n\nWe have also included messages compiled by Fr. Laurentin, and Prof. LeJeune from 1984-1986, which are in addition to the weekly messages recorded by the parish in Medjugorje during that same period.\n\nFor ease of reading, this is a fluid page. You can resize your browser window and the text will re-format.\n\nGo Top\n\nWednesday, June 24, 1981\n\nThe visionaries see a distant apparition of a young woman in a long grey dress holding a baby in her arms on the hill of Crnica (now known as Apparition Hill). The first time was in the afternoon, the second time towards 6:00pm.\n\nThursday, June 25, 1981\n\nThe date of the first apparition for the group of six visionaries, who see Our Lady nearby on the hill: Our Lady says: \"Praised be Jesus!\"\n\nIvanka: Where is my mother? (Her mother had died two months previously.) \"She is happy. She is with me.\"\n\nThe visionaries: Will you return tomorrow? The apparition answers with a nod of her head.\n\nMirjana: No one will believe us. They will say that we are crazy. Give us a sign! The apparition responds only with a smile. Mirjana believed she had received a sign. Her watch had changed time during the apparition.\n\n\"Goodbye, my angels. Go in the peace of God.\"\n\nFriday, June 26, 1981\n\nIn the presence of a crowd of 2,000 to 3,000 people, drawn there by the luminary signs coming from the hill of the apparitions, Vicka sprinkles the apparition with Holy Water and says: If you are the Gospa, stay with us, if not, go away. The apparition only smiles.\n\nIvanka: Why have you come here? What do you desire?\n\n\"I have come because there are many true believers here. I wish to be with you to convert and to reconcile the whole world.\"\n\nIvanka: Did my mother say anything?\n\n\"Obey your grandmother and help her because she is old.\"\n\nMirjana: How is my grandfather? (He had recently died.) \"He is well.\"\n\nThe visionaries, on a request from the crowd: Give us a sign which will prove your presence. \"Blessed are those who have not seen and who believe.\"\n\nMirjana: Who are you? \"I am the Most Blessed Virgin Mary.\"\n\nWhy are you appearing to us? We are not better than others.\n\n\"I do not necessarily choose the best.\"\n\nWill you come back? \"Yes, to the same place as yesterday.\"\n\nOn returning to the village after the apparition, Marija sees the Virgin again, in tears, near a cross with rainbow colors:\n\n\"Peace, Peace, Peace! Be reconciled! Only Peace. Make your peace with God and among yourselves. For that, it is necessary to believe, to pray, to fast, and to go to confession.\"\n\nSaturday, June 27, 1981\n\n\"Praised be Jesus!\"\n\nJakov: What do you expect of our Franciscans?\n\n\"Have them persevere in the faith and protect the faith of others.\"\n\nJakov and Mirjana: Leave us a sign because the people treat us as liars.\n\n\"My angels, do not be afraid of injustice. It has always existed.\"\n\nThe visionaries: How must we pray?\n\n\"Continue to recite 7 Our Father's and 7 Hail Mary's and Glory Be's, but also add the Creed. Goodbye, my angels. Go in the peace of God.\"\n\nTo Ivan, aside from the others: \"Be in peace and take courage.\"\n\n(Ivan said: What a beautiful smile when she left me.)\n\nSunday, June 28, 1981\n\nThe visionaries: What do you wish?\n\n\"That people believe and persevere in the faith.\"\n\nVicka: What do you expect from the priests?\n\n\"That they remain strong in the faith and that they help you.\"\n\nWhy don't you appear to everyone in church?\n\n\"Blessed are they who believe without having seen.\"\n\nWill you come back? \"Yes, to the same place.\"\n\nDo you prefer prayer or singing? \"Both, praying and singing.\"\n\nVicka: What do you wish from the crowd which has gathered here? The visionaries said this question received no response except for a glance filled with love, and Our Lady's smile. Then Our Lady disappeared. The visionaries prayed so that she might return because she had not said: Goodbye, my angels. During their song, You Are All Beautiful, she reappears.\n\nVicka: Dear Gospa, what do you expect of this people? She repeated the question three times and finally was given this answer:\n\n\"That those who do not see believe as those who see.\"\n\nVicka: Will you leave us a sign so that people believe that we are not liars or comedians? No other response, only a smile. \"Go in the peace of God\", She said, as she disappeared.\n\nMonday, June 29, 1981\n\nThe visionaries: Dear Gospa, are you happy to see so many people here today? \"More than happy.\" (She smiles, writes Vicka).\n\nHow long will you stay with us? \"As long as you will want me to, my angels.\"\n\nWhat do you expect of the people who have come in spite of the brambles and the heat? \"There is only one God, one faith. Let the people believe firmly and do not fear anything.\"\n\nWhat do you expect of us?\n\n\"That you have a solid faith and that you maintain confidence.\"\n\nWill we know how to endure persecutions, which will come to us because of you?\n\n\"You will be able to, my angels. Do not fear. You will be able to endure everything. You must believe and have confidence in me.\"\n\nHere Vicka writes a question from Dr. Darinka Glamuzina: May I touch Our Lady? She gives this response:\n\n\"There have always been Doubting Thomas's, but she can approach.\"\n\nVicka shows her where to stretch out her hand. Darinka tries to touch her. Our Lady disappears, and then reappears in her light.\n\nThe parents of a three-year-old child, Daniel Setka, who had suffered from septicemia since the fourth day of his birth, asked the visionaries to intercede for the handicapped child. Dear Gospa, is little Daniel going to speak some day? Cure him so that they all will believe us. These people love you very much, dear Gospa. Perform a miracle. Dear Gospa, say something. They repeated this petition and conveyed the response:\n\n\"Have them believe strongly in his cure. Go in the peace of God.\"\n\nThe Hidden Phase\n\n(Jun 30, 1981 To Dec 31, 1981)\n\nDuring this period, Our Lady appeared to the visionaries in hidden places, away from the police patrols that were trying to track them down.\n\nTuesday, June 30, 1981\n\nApparition at Cerno. Mirjana: Are you angry that we were not on the hill?\n\n\"That doesn't matter.\"\n\nWould you be angry if we would not return any longer to the hill, but we would wait in the church? \"Always at the same time. Go in the peace of God.\"\n\nOn that day, Mirjana thought that she understood that the Gospa would return for three more days, until Friday. But it was only her interpretation.\n\nThursday, July 2, 1981\n\nJakov: Dear Gospa, leave us a sign. The Virgin seemed to consent with a nod: \"Goodbye, my dear angels.\"\n\nSaturday, July 4, 1981\n\nThe visionaries believe the apparitions had ended, but Our Lady appeared to each one of them separately, where he or she was. No message was preserved...\n\nTuesday, July 21, 1981\n\n(Vicka's diary - 27th apparition, 6:30pm)\n\nJust like every day, we spoke with the Gospa. She arrived at 6:30pm, and greeted us: \"Praised be Jesus!\"\n\nThen we asked her if she would give us a sign. She said yes. Then we asked her how much longer she would still continue to visit us. The Blessed Virgin responded:\n\n\"My sweet angels, even if I were to leave the sign, many people will not believe. Many people will only come here and bow down. But people must be converted and do penance.\"\n\nThen we questioned her on the subject of the sick. For some, the Gospa said that they would be cured only if their faith was strong, and for others, no. Then she prepared to depart. Upon leaving, she said to us:\n\n\"Go in the peace of God.\"\n\nWednesday, July 22, 1981\n\n(Vicka's diary - 28th apparition, 6:30pm)\n\nOn arriving she said: \"Praise be Jesus Christ.\"\n\nAll of us questioned her on the subject of some sick people who had been recommended to us. Then we prayed with the Blessed Virgin. She only said the Our Father and Glory Be, and during the time that we said the Hail Mary, she was silent. The Gospa told us that:\n\n\"A good many people have been converted and among them some had not gone to Confession in 45 years, and now, they are going to Confession. Go in the peace of God.\"\n\nAs Our Lady was departing, a cross appeared in the sky.\n\nThursday, July 23, 1981\n\n(Vicka's diary - 29th apparition, 6:30pm)\n\nVicka only mentions the greeting from Our Lady: \"Praised be Jesus Christ...\"\n\nFriday, July 24, 1981\n\n(Vicka's diary - 30th apparition, 6:30pm)\n\nToday, also, we went to the place of the apparitions about 6:20pm, and while praying and singing, we waited for the Blessed Virgin. At exactly 6:30pm we saw the light which slowly approached. Then we saw the Blessed Virgin and heard her customary greeting. To our questions, relative to the majority of the sick, the Gospa answered quickly:\n\n\"Without faith, nothing is possible. All those who will believe firmly will be cured.\"\n\nSaturday, July 25, 1981\n\n(Vicka's diary - 31st apparition, 6:30pm)\n\nAfter the usual questions on the subject of the ill, the Gospa responded:\n\n\"God, help us all!\"\n\nMonday, July 27, 1981\n\n(Vicka's diary - 33rd apparition, 6:30pm)\n\nOnly four of us came because they put pressure on Ivan, Ivanka and Mirjana to go to Sarajevo. At 6:30pm exactly, the Gospa appeared. Vicka asked her about certain sick people, took some objects which had been given to her by some people, and approached Our Lady so that she could bless them. The Gospa made the Sign of the Cross and said:\n\n\"In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.\"\n\nThen we questioned her on the subject of the sign, and the Gospa answered:\n\n\"Await, it will not be for long. If I will leave you a sign, I will still appear to you.\"\n\nVicka asked if we would be able to see her again one more time this evening on the hill. The Gospa agreed and said:\n\n\"I will come at 11:15pm. Go in the peace of God.\"\n\nSaying this, she began to disappear and we saw in the heavens the heart and the cross. Our Lady said:\n\n\"My angels, I send you my Son, Jesus, Who was tortured for His faith, and yet He endured everything. You also, my angels, will endure everything.\"\n\nJesus had long hair, brown eyes, and a beard. We only saw His head. She said that we prayed and sang beautifully:\n\n\"It is beautiful to listen to you. Continue in this manner.\"\n\nIn conclusion she said: \"Don't be afraid for Jozo.\"\n\n(The pastor of the parish who had been threatened by the police).\n\nWednesday, July 29, 1981\n\n(Vicka's diary - 35th apparition, 6:30pm)\n\nToday we waited for the Blessed Virgin in Vicka's room. At exactly 6:30pm, the Gospa came and greeted us: \"Praised be Jesus!\"\n\nJakov was the first to question her on the subject of a person who was ill. The Blessed Virgin said: \"She will be cured. She must believe firmly...\"\n\nVicka asked Our Lady why she had not come the day before. The Blessed Virgin said something, and smiled, but no one heard it. Then Marija and Jakov asked her about certain sick people. We then took some religious articles, and the four of us approached Our Lady so that she would bless them. As Our Lady was blessing the articles our hands became very cold.\n\nJakov asked if we could embrace her. The Blessed Virgin said that we should approach, and embrace her. Then we asked her to leave us the sign. She said: \"Yes. Go in the peace of God.\"\n\nAs Our Lady began to disappear, on the ceiling, the Cross and the Heart were visible. The cross, the heart, and the sun are also mentioned by Vicka's diary in later apparitions.\n\nIn church we saw the Blessed Virgin a second time toward 8:00pm in the choir loft. While we were praying, the Blessed Virgin prayed with us.\n\nThursday, July 30, 1981\n\nWe did not go to the hill.\n\n(Vicka's diary contains no more observations until Aug 25)\n\nSometime In July 1981\n\n\"Carry out well your responsibilities and what the Church asks you to do...\"\n\nSunday, August 2, 1981\n\nMarija sees the Virgin in her room:\n\n\"All of you together go to the meadow at Gumno. A great battle is about to take place. A battle between my Son and satan. Human souls are at stake.\"\n\nThe visionaries, accompanied by about 40 local people, went to the prairie of Gumno, about 200 yards from Vicka's house. Our Lady said:\n\n\"Everyone here may touch me.\"\n\nAfter many people had touched her, a black stain appeared on her dress. Marija cried. Marinko invited the people who were present to go to Confession.\n\nBeginning of August 1981\n\nWhat do you wish that we do later? \"I would like for you to become priests and religious, but only if you yourselves, would want it. It is up to you to decide.\"\n\nThursday, August 6, 1981\n\n\"I am the Queen of Peace.\"\n\nFriday, August 7, 1981\n\nOn Mt. Krizevac, at 2:00am in the morning:\n\n\"That one do penance for sins.\"\n\nSaturday, August 8, 1981\n\n\"Do penance! Strengthen your faith through prayer and the sacraments.\"\n\nMonday, August 17, 1981\n\n\"Do not be afraid. I wish that you would be filled with joy and that the joy could be seen on your faces. I will protect Father Jozo.\"\n\n(Fr. Jozo was the pastor in Medjugorje who was imprisoned.)\n\nSaturday, August 22, 1981\n\n\"Father Jozo has nothing to fear. All that will pass.\"\n\nSunday, August 23, 1981\n\n\"Praised be Jesus! I have been with Ivan until now. Pray, my angels, for this people. My children, I give you strength. I will give you some of it always. When you need me, call me.\"\n\nMonday, August 24, 1981\n\nIn Vicka's diary, August 25th, she writes: Yesterday, Monday the 24th at 10:45am, Mirjana and I were at Ivan's house. We heard a commotion and we went out running. Outside, everybody was looking at the cross on Krizevac. At the spot of the cross, Mirjana, Jakov, Ivan and I saw the Blessed Virgin, and the people saw something like her statue, which then began to disappear, and the cross appeared again. Over the entire sky everyone saw, written in gold letters, the word \"MIR\" (which means peace in Croatian).\n\nVicka's diary then reports the apparition on August 25th. A little after Our Lady prayed for peace, a large inscription appeared on top of Krizevac... The word \"MIR\" was seen by the pastor and many persons from the village. The visionaries affirmed that the Blessed Virgin promised that there would still be many other signs as forerunners before the great sign in Medjugorje, and in other parts of the world.\n\nTuesday, August 25, 1981\n\nSome persons who were present asked the visionaries to request of the Blessed Virgin permission to touch her. Our Lady said: \"It is not necessary to touch me. Many are those who do not feel anything when they touch me.\"\n\nOur Lady also said that among those present, there was a spy (no other clarification was given).\n\nOn the matter of the sign:\n\n\"You do not have to become impatient for the day will come.\"\n\nWednesday, August 26, 1981\n\nToday, for the first time, we waited for the Blessed Virgin at the home of Zdenka Ivankovic. There were five of us, because Ivanka had not yet returned. The Blessed Virgin appeared and said: \"Praised be Jesus.\"\n\nShe said that tomorrow the people did not have to come, and thus we would be by ourselves. Then also:\n\n\"Do not give advice to anyone. I know what you feel and that will pass, also.\"\n\nThursday, August 27, 1981\n\nVicka: Marija and I came to Jakovs house today about 6:00pm. We helped Jakovs mother prepare supper. At 6:00pm the Blessed Virgin came toward us. I was outside when the Blessed Virgin Mary came. She said that they should not have to make one suffer so.\n\nWe asked her with respect to the sign, and she said:\n\n\"Very soon, I promise you.\"\n\nWe recommended certain sick people to Our Lady. She stayed with us for 15 minutes. Then we left for the home of Marinko Ivankovic in order to wait for the Blessed Virgin there. She came at 6:30pm. She told Ivan:\n\n\"Be strong and courageous.\"\n\nShe left, and the cross, the heart and the sun appeared.\n\nFriday, August 28, 1981\n\nAt the hour of the apparition, the visionaries wait in the room of Fr. Jozo, who is in prison. The Virgin does not appear. It is the second time that this has happened. They go to church and pray. She then appears to them:\n\n\"I was with Father Jozo. That is why I did not come. Do not trouble yourselves if I do not come. It suffices then to pray.\"\n\nToday, Ivan entered the seminary of Visoko:\n\n\"You are very tired. Rest, so that you can find strength. Go in the peace of God. Goodbye.\" (From Ivan's journal)\n\nSaturday, August 29, 1981\n\nJakov: Are you also appearing to Ivan in the seminary?\n\n\"Yes, just like to you.\"\n\nHow is Ivan Ivankovic? (Son of Pero, cousin of Vicka, and one of four men in Bijakovici who bear this name. He had been arrested by the police on Aug 12th, while on the hill of the apparitions, and was imprisoned.)\n\n\"He is well. He is enduring everything. All that will pass. Father Jozo sends you greetings.\"\n\nWhat is the news from our village?\n\n\"My angels, you are doing your penance well.\"\n\nWill you help us in our studies? \"God's help manifests itself everywhere.\"\n\n\"Go in the peace of God with the blessing of Jesus and mine. Goodbye.\"\n\n(From Ivan's journal.)\n\nIvanka: Will you leave us a sign soon? \"Again, a little patience.\"\n\nSunday, August 30, 1981\n\nVicka: At 6:20pm, we began to pray at the home of Marinko Ivankovic. The Virgin arrived and said: \"Praised be Jesus!\"\n\nVicka: People say that since they locked up Fr. Jozo in his cell, the doors unlock by themselves. Is that true? \"It is true, but no one believes it.\"\n\nIvanka: How is Mirjana? What are her feelings?\n\n\"Mirjana is sad because she is all alone. I will show her to you.\"\n\nSuddenly, we saw Mirjana's face. She was crying.\n\nDear Gospa, there are some young people who betray our faith.\n\n\"Yes, there are many.\"\n\nShe mentions some names.\n\nVicka asks the Virgin concerning a woman who wanted to leave her husband because he was making her suffer.\n\n\"Let her remain close to him and accept her suffering. Jesus, Himself, also suffered.\"\n\nOn the matter of a sick young boy:\n\n\"He is suffering from a very grave illness. Let his parents firmly believe, do penance, then the little boy will be cured.\"\n\nJakov asks her about the sign: \"Again, a little patience.\"\n\nIvan, who had been several days without an apparition: How will I do in this seminary? \"Be without fear. I am close to you everywhere and at all times.\"\n\nIvan's diary: Are the people pious in our village?\n\n\"Your village has become the most fervent parish in Hercegovina. A large number of people distinguish themselves through their piety and their faith.\"\n\nEnd of August 1981\n\nWhich is the best fasting? \"A fast on bread and water.\"\n\n\"I am the Queen of Peace.\"\n\nTuesday, September 1, 1981\n\nWill there be a Mass on Mt. Krizevac? \"Yes, my angels.\"\n\nJakov: Are the police setting up a trap around the church?\n\n\"There's nothing at all. Have the people pray and remain in church as long as possible. Go in the peace of God.\"\n\nThe cross, the heart, and the sun appeared.\n\nIvan's diary: I prayed with her so that Jesus might help me in my vocation. Then we recited the rosary. The Gospa smiled with kindness.\n\n\"Do not be afraid. I am close to you and I watch over you.\"\n\nWednesday, September 2, 1981\n\nConcerning a young man who hanged himself. Vicka: Why did he do that? \"Satan took hold of him. This young man should not have done that. The Devil tries to reign over the people. He takes everything into his hands, but the force of God is more powerful, and God will conquer.\"\n\nIvan's diary: How will things go for Anton, Dario, Miljenko, my friends in the seminary, and for me?\n\n\"You are, and you will always be my children. You have followed the path of Jesus. No one will stop you from propagating the faith in Jesus. One must believe strongly.\"\n\nThursday, September 3, 1981\n\nJakov: When will the sign which was announced come?\n\n\"Again, a little patience.\"\n\nFriday, September 4, 1981\n\nIvanka and Marija: Since we will be far away at school during the week, except on Saturdays and Sundays, what must we do?\n\n\"It is enough for you to pray. Come here Saturdays and Sundays. I will appear to all of you.\"\n\nTo Ivan in the seminary: \"The sign will be given at the end of the apparitions.\"\n\nIvan: When will that be? \"You are impatient, my angel. Go in the peace of God.\"\n\nSaturday, September 5, 1981\n\nIvan's diary: I was praying in the chapel. The Gospa came when I was reciting the Our Father.\n\n\"Praise be Jesus and Mary.\"\n\n(Our Lady was using a salutation of pious people in Croatia, probably with the desire to revive it.)\n\n\"Go in the peace of God, my angel. May the blessing of God accompany you. Amen. Goodbye.\"\n\nSunday, September 6, 1981\n\nIvan's diary: I was praying in the chapel. Suddenly there was a great light...\n\n\"Pray especially on Sunday, so that the great sign, the gift of God may come. Pray with fervor and a constancy so that God may have mercy on His great children. Go in peace, my angel. May the blessing of God accompany you. Amen. Goodbye.\"\n\nMonday, September 7, 1981\n\nIvan's diary: \"Be converted all of you who are still there. The sign will come when you will be converted.\"\n\nTuesday, September 8, 1981\n\nIvan's diary: \"I ask you only to pray with fervor. Prayer must become a part of your daily life, to permit the true faith to take roots.\"\n\nJakov wishes the Blessed Virgin a happy birthday. She answers:\n\n\"It is for me a beautiful day. With respect to you, persevere in the faith and in prayer. Do not be afraid. Remain in joy. It is my desire. Let joy appear on your faces. I will continue to protect Father Jozo.\"\n\nThursday, September 10, 1981\n\nIvan's diary: We prayed a lot. Prayers filled with joy and love, prayers of the heart. Then she says: \"Go in the peace of God, my angel. Amen. Goodbye.\"\n\nSunday, September 13, 1981\n\nIvan's diary: The students in the seminary prayed the Rosary after they had gone to Confession. The Virgin came near the image of Jesus and said: \"There is your Father, my angel. Go in the peace of God, my angels.\"\n\nChrist is our Brother, but in a sense, also our Father: In an apparition to Gemma Galgani, Jesus said, \"I am your Father. Your Mother, here she is.\" And He pointed out to Gemma the Blessed Virgin.\n\nMonday, September 14, 1981\n\nTo Vicka:\n\n\"Stay here so that Jakov will not be alone. Persevere (both of you) with patience. You will be rewarded.\" Our Lady also told Vicka that she had scolded Mirjana and Ivanka for a behavior which was not detailed.\n\nTuesday, September 15, 1981\n\n\"If this people are not converted very soon, bad things will happen to them.\"\n\nWednesday, September 16, 1981\n\n\"The militia will not stay here a long time. I will leave the sign. Be patient still. Don't pray for yourselves. You have been rewarded. Pray for others.\"\n\nThursday, September 17, 1981\n\nConcerning a sick person: \"He will die very soon.\"\n\nThen the Blessed Virgin encouraged the children:\n\n\"Persevere and you will be rewarded.\"\n\nSunday, September 20, 1981\n\nTo Vicka and Jakov:\n\n\"Do not relax in your prayers. I ask both of you to fast for a week on bread and water.\"\n\nWednesday, September 30, 1981\n\n\"Don't ask useless questions dictated by curiosity. The most important thing is to pray, my angels.\"\n\nThursday, October 1, 1981\n\nAre all religions the same?\n\n\"Members of all faiths are equal before God. God rules over each faith just like a sovereign over his kingdom. In the world, all religions are not the same because all people have not complied with the commandments of God. They reject and disparage them.\"\n\nAre all churches the same?\n\n\"In some, one prays to God more. In others, less. That depends on the priests who motivate others to pray. That also depends on the power which they have.\"\n\nWhy are there so many apparitions, which repeat themselves so many times? Why does the Blessed Virgin appear to children who do not follow the way of God? \"I appear to you often and in every place. To others, I appear from time to time and briefly. They do not follow yet, completely the way of God. They are not aware of the gift which He has made them, that no one deserves. With time, they also will come to follow the right way.\"\n\nTuesday, October 6, 1981\n\n\"The evening Mass must definitely be kept. The Mass of the sick must be celebrated on a specific day at a time which is most convenient. Father Tomislav must begin with the prayer group. It is very necessary. Have Father Tomislav pray with fervor.\"\n\nWednesday, October 7, 1981\n\nThe visionaries: Is there, outside of Jesus, other intermediaries between God and man, and if so, what is their role?\n\n\"There is only one mediator between God and man, and it is Jesus Christ.\"\n\nOn the request from Fr. Tomislav: Should we found a community here just like that of Saint Francis of Assisi?\n\n\"God has chosen Saint Francis as His elected one. It would be good to imitate his life. In the meantime, we must realize what God orders us to do.\"\n\nThursday, October 8, 1981\n\nMarija humbly reports that the Gospa had scolded her for having stayed (during Mass) with her religious instruction school mates, who asked her about the apparitions:\n\n\"You would have done better to attend Mass rather than to satisfy human curiosity.\"\n\nSaturday, October 10, 1981\n\n\"It is up to you to pray and to persevere. I have made promises to you; also be without anxiety. Faith will not know how to be alive without prayer... Pray more.\"\n\nSunday, October 11, 1981\n\nThe Virgin answers, as usual, questions on the subject of people who are sick or who have disappeared: \"Tomo Lovic (an old man) is dead.\"\n\nMonday, October 12, 1981\n\nWhere are the Kingdom of God and paradise? \"In Heaven.\"\n\nAre you the Mother of God? \"I am the Mother of God and the Queen of Peace.\"\n\nDid you go to Heaven before or after death? \"I went to Heaven before death.\"\n\nWhen will you leave us the sign?\n\n\"I will not yet leave the sign. I shall continue to appear. Father Jozo sends you greetings. He is experiencing difficulties, but he will resist, because he knows why he is suffering.\"\n\nSaturday, October 17, 1981\n\nQuestioned on the subject of the visible sign, Our Lady responds:\n\n\"It is mine to realize the promise. With respect to the faithful, have them pray and believe firmly.\"\n\nMonday, October 19, 1981\n\n\"Pray for Fr. Jozo and fast tomorrow on bread and water. Then you will fast for a whole week on bread and water. Pray, my angels. Now I will show you Fr. Jozo.\"\n\nThe visionaries have a vision of Fr. Jozo in prison. He tells them not to be afraid for him, and that everything was well.\n\nWith respect to Marinko who protected the visionaries:\n\n\"There are a few similar faithful. He is made a sufficient number of sacrifices for Jozo. He underwent many torments and sufferings. Continue, and do not let anyone take the faith away from you.\"\n\nTuesday, October 20, 1981\n\nVicka: Dear Gospa, have mercy on Fr. Jozo tomorrow during the trial. Paralyze someone; strike someone on the head. I know it is a sin to speak so, but what can we do? The Gospa smiles at my words, then she sings, Jesus Christ, in Your Name. When we finished the song with Our Lady she tells us: \"Go in the peace of God.\" Then she leaves.\n\nWednesday, October 21, 1981\n\nWith respect to Fr. Jozo who is awaiting sentence from the court. Vicka: Dear Gospa, I know that you do not have the spirit of vengeance, but try nevertheless to bring certain people to reason, so that they might judge impartially.\n\n\"Jozo looks well and he greets you warmly. Do not fear for Jozo. He is a saint, I have already told you.\"\n\nWill Jozo be condemned?\n\n\"Sentence will not be pronounced this evening. Do not be afraid, he will not be condemned to a severe punishment. Pray only, because Jozo asks from you prayer and perseverance. Do not be afraid because I am with you.\"\n\nThursday, October 22, 1981\n\n\"Jozo has been sentenced. Let us go to church to pray.\"\n\nWe were sad because of Jozo.\n\n\"You should rejoice!\"\n\nIs the whiteness of the cross a supernatural phenomenon?\n\n\"Yes, I confirm it.\"\n\nAfter many people saw the cross on Mt. Krizevac transform itself into a light, and then into a silhouette of Our Lady, she said:\n\n\"All of these signs are designed to strengthen your faith until I leave you the visible and permanent sign.\"\n\nSunday, October 25, 1981\n\nThree girls from Citluk are returning home after Mass and suddenly see a great light from which fifteen silhouettes, dressed in Franciscan frock, are seen. They go down on their knees, and begin to pray and cry. The Blessed Virgin was asked about this and said:\n\n\"It was a supernatural phenomenon. I was among the saints.\"\n\nMonday, October 26, 1981\n\nThe Blessed Virgin appeared smiling:\n\n\"Praise be Jesus. You are not to ask me any more questions on the subject of the sign. Do not be afraid, it will surely appear. I carry out my promises. As far as you are concerned, pray, persevere in prayer.\"\n\nWednesday, October 28, 1981\n\nWere you there at Krizevac yesterday for half an hour?\n\n\"Yes, didn't you see me?\"\n\nSeveral hundred people saw, at the site of the first apparition, a fire which burned without consuming anything. In the evening, Our Lady tells the visionaries: \"The fire seen by the faithful was of a supernatural character. It is one of the signs; a forerunner of the great sign.\"\n\nThursday, October 29, 1981\n\n\"You, my angels, be on your guard. There is enough mendacious news which people are spreading. Of course, I will show you my mercy. Be a little patient. Pray!\"\n\nFriday, October 30, 1981\n\n\"Praise be Jesus!\"\n\nJakov and Vicka: What was in the sealed envelope that they showed us at city hall? (Someone told them they would believe in the apparitions, if they could read what was in the sealed envelope.)\n\n\"Do not respond to anything. It is a bad trick which they are playing on you. They have already given so much false news. Do not believe them. Continue to pray and to suffer! I will make the power of love appear.\"\n\nShould one celebrate Christmas Mass in the evening or at Midnight?\n\n\"Have them celebrate it at midnight.\"\n\nTo the visionaries: \"Pray! Go in the peace of God!\"\n\nTo Ivanka: \"Pray more. The others are praying and suffering more than you.\"\n\nTo the visionaries:\n\n\"Tell the young people not to allow themselves to be distracted from the true way. Let them remain faithful to their religion.\"\n\nSaturday, October 31, 1981\n\nVicka's diary: Mirjana arrives from Sarajevo, where she is studying at a professional school, and where she has had daily apparitions. Vicka reports: The Gospa advises as an attentive mother would. She tells Mirjana twice who she must distrust, which persons to avoid, how to conduct herself with those who reproach her, and insult God. She also tells her to break a relationship with a girl who wanted to get her into drugs, and not to quarrel with anyone, and to answer a point when it is useful, or to remain silent and go on her way when that is better. She tells her also that Fr. Jozo will not spend more than four years in prison. She was happy because all five of us were together.\n\nOn the question of Danny Ljolje, the Gospa said:\n\n\"There is a lot of deception and erroneous information.\"\n\nThen Our Lady showed us a part of paradise. It was indescribably beautiful, with many people, particularly children. We were afraid. The Blessed Virgin told us not to be afraid.\n\n\"All those who are faithful to God will have that.\"\n\nIvanka saw her mother in paradise as well as another person who was of her acquaintance.\n\nOctober 1981\n\nRegarding the conflict between the Franciscans and the Bishop of Mostar in Hercegovina: \"It is going to find a solution. We must have patience and pray.\"\n\nIn response to a question posed by the visionaries: What will become of Poland? \"There will be great conflicts but in the end, the just will take over.\"\n\nWith respect to Russia:\n\n\"It is the people where God will be most glorified. The West has made civilization progress, but without God, as if they were their own creators.\"\n\nSunday, November 1, 1981\n\n\"Be persevering! Pray! Many people are beginning to convert.\"\n\nBeginning of November 1981\n\nThe Virgin appears with a picture of John Paul II in her hand. She embraces the picture:\n\n\"He is our father, and the father of all. It is necessary to pray for him.\"\n\nMonday, November 2, 1981\n\nWhy did you show us paradise the day before yesterday?\n\n\"I did it so that you could see the happiness which awaits those who love God.\"\n\nJesus appears to them crowned with thorns, and with injuries all over His body. The children are afraid.\n\n\"Do not be afraid. It is my Son. See how He has been martyred. In spite of all, He was joyful and He endured all with patience.\"\n\nJesus tells them:\n\n\"Look at me. How I have been injured and martyred. In spite of all, I have gained the victory. You also, my angels, be persevering in your faith and pray so that you may overcome.\"\n\nTuesday, November 3, 1981\n\nThe Virgin begins the song, Come, Come to Us Lord, and we continued it with her.\n\n\"I am often at Krizevac, at the foot of the cross, to pray there. Now I pray to my Son to forgive the world its sins. The world has begun to convert.\"\n\nShe smiles, and then leaves.\n\nFriday, November 6, 1981\n\nAfter twenty minutes, the Gospa disappears, and before us, Hell appears. Later she tells us:\n\n\"Do not be afraid! I have shown you Hell so that you may know the state of those who are there.\"\n\nSunday, November 8, 1981\n\nThe Blessed Virgin kisses an image of the Pope and says:\n\n\"It is your father, the spiritual father of all.\"\n\nThe visionaries have a vision of Fr. Jozo in prison. The Blessed Virgin tells them: \"Have you seen how our Fr. Jozo struggles for God?\"\n\nMonday, November 9, 1981\n\nJakov and I were alone in the room. We were speaking of the militia which passed by. The Virgin arrived:\n\n\"Do not be afraid of the militia. Do not provoke anybody. Be polite with everybody.\"\n\nTuesday, November 10, 1981\n\n\"Do not give in. Keep your faith. I will accompany you at every step.\"\n\nFriday, November 13, 1981\n\n\"Praise be Jesus!\"\n\nThe visionaries answer: Always Jesus and Mary.\n\nThen the Blessed Virgin shows us beautiful landscapes. The Baby Jesus was walking there but we were not able to recognize Him. She said:\n\n\"It is Jesus. On my arrival and when I depart always sing the song, Come, Come to us O Lord.\"\n\nThen she blessed us.\n\nSunday, November 15, 1981\n\nWe were in Fr. Jozo's room. The Gospa did not come. She appeared to us in the church after the prayers of 7 Our Father's, Hail Mary's, and Glory Be's. We asked her why she had not appeared. She answered that she had not appeared because someone had installed something there.\n\n\"The world is on the point of receiving great favors from me and from my Son. May the world keep a strong confidence.\"\n\nMonday, November 16, 1981\n\n\"The Devil is trying to conquer us. Do not permit him. Keep the faith, fast and pray. I will be with you at every step.\"\n\nTo Jakov and Vicka: \"Persevere with confidence in prayer and in faith...\"\n\nSunday, November 22, 1981\n\nWe asked the Blessed Virgin what the cross, the heart and the sun, seen during the apparition meant:\n\n\"These are the signs of salvation: The cross is a sign of mercy, just like the heart. The sun is the source of light, which enlightens us.\"\n\nA shining silhouette takes the place of the cross again on Krizevac. The visionaries ask Our Lady if it was she.\n\n\"Why do you ask me my angels? Have you not seen me? The world must find salvation while there is time. Let it pray with fervor. May it have the spirit of faith.\"\n\nMonday, November 23, 1981\n\nThe Gospa was all dressed in gold. Around her veil, and on her dress, everything shined and sparkled. It was indescribable. She was very, very beautiful.\n\n\"The people have begun to convert. Keep a solid faith. I need your prayers.\"\n\nThursday, November 26, 1981\n\nThis evening, the Blessed Virgin was smiling. We prayed and sang with her. We asked her questions about the sick.\n\n\"Have a strong faith, pray and fast and they will be cured. Be confident and rest in joy. Go in the peace of God. Be patient and pray for the cure. Goodbye, my dear angels.\"\n\nSaturday, November 28, 1981\n\nThere were five of us. Ivan was absent. Profound harmony reigned over us. The Virgin came at the moment when we began to say the Our Father. We conversed with her. Then she blessed religious objects. She looked at us with sweetness and said:\n\n\"Ah, it is so beautiful to see all of you together! Go in the peace of God, my angels. Goodbye.\"\n\nSunday, November 29, 1981\n\n\"It is necessary for the world to be saved while there is still time; for it to pray strongly and to have the spirit of faith.\"\n\nNovember 1981\n\n\"The Devil tries to impose his power on you. But you must remain strong and persevere in your faith. You must pray and fast. I will be always close to you.\"\n\nVicka: This warning concerns everybody.\n\nWednesday, December 2, 1981\n\nMarija, Vicka and Jakov: We asked the Blessed Virgin on the matter of a young man who had suddenly lost his memory and stopped learning. She said: \"It is necessary to hospitalize him.\"\n\nWe still questioned her. She did not respond to some of the questions.\n\n\"It is not necessary to ask questions on every subject.\"\n\nShe then greeted us as usual.\n\nThursday, December 3, 1981\n\n\"Pray, and persevere through prayer.\"\n\nSunday, December 6, 1981\n\n\"Be strong and persevering. My dear angels, go in the peace of God.\"\n\nMonday, December 7, 1981\n\n\"The people are converting. It is true, but not yet all.\"\n\nShe spoke while looking at the crowd.\n\nApparition at Jakovs home: The blessed Virgin prayed all the time with us. She then said: \"Pray and persist in prayers.\"\n\nOn the walls there was written in letters of gold \"MIR LJUDIMA\".\n\n(Peace to the people).\n\nTuesday, December 8, 1981 (Feast of the Immaculate Conception)\n\nResponding to a question from the visionaries with respect to their future:\n\n\"I would like for all of you to become priests and religious, but only if you desire it. You are free. It is up to you to choose. If you are experiencing difficulties or if you need something, come to me. If you do not have the strength to fast on bread and water, you can give up a number of things. It would be a good thing to give up television, because after seeing some programs, you are distracted and unable to pray. You can give up alcohol, cigarettes and other pleasures. You yourselves know what you have to do.\"\n\nOn this day of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, the Gospa was serious; she knelt down with arms extended while praying:\n\n\"My beloved Son, I beseech you to be willing to forgive the world its great sin through which it offends you.\"\n\nWednesday, December 9, 1981\n\nWhile we were saying our prayers, the Blessed Virgin intervened:\n\n\"Oh, My Son Jesus, forgive these sins, there are so many of them!\"\n\nThen we were all silent.\n\n\"Continue to pray, because that is the salvation of this people.\"\n\nFriday, December 11, 1981\n\nVicka: I recommend to the Gospa my parents who are in Germany.\n\n\"I promise to protect them. Everything will go well.\"\n\nSaturday, December 12, 1981\n\nAs vacation approached, which allowed the visionaries to be back together, the Blessed Virgin was happy:\n\n\"Very soon you will all be united. You will be able to have a good time together.\"\n\nWednesday, December 16, 1981\n\n\"Kneel down, my children, and pray. Persevere in prayer.\"\n\nJakov and Vicka: Every word of the Blessed Virgin invited us to be joyful.\n\nFriday, December 18, 1981\n\nThe Blessed Virgin did not respond to our questions. She sang, Jesus Christ, in Your Name. After the first verse, she said:\n\n\"Come on, sing more joyfully. Why are you so pensive?\"\n\nAfter the prayer, she began, Queen of the Holy Rosary, and she departed.\n\nMonday, December 21, 1981\n\n\"Be on your guard, my children. Prepare yourselves for difficult days. All kinds of people will come here.\"\n\nThursday, December 24, 1981\n\n\"Celebrate the days which are coming. Rejoice with my Son. Love your neighbor. May harmony reign among you.\"\n\nFriday, December 25, 1981\n\n\"Love one another, my children. You are brothers and sisters. Don't argue among yourselves.\"\n\nOur Lady then blesses them and leaves.\n\nAfter having had a vision of Jesus:\n\n\"Give glory to God, glorify Him and sing, my angels.\"\n\nWednesday, December 30, 1981\n\nIn response to some questions concerning the sick, Our Lady began praying with the Our Father, then the song, The Queen of the Holy Rosary, and then she departed.\n\nThursday, December 31, 1981\n\nIvan: How can one put priests, who do not believe in the apparitions, on the right track?\n\n\"It is necessary to tell them that, from the very beginning, I have been conveying the message of God to the world. It is a great pity not to believe in it. Faith is a vital element, but one cannot compel a person to believe. Faith is the foundation from which everything flows.\"\n\nIs it really you who appears at the foot of the Cross?\n\n\"Yes, it is true. Almost every day I am at the foot of the Cross. My Son carried the Cross. He has suffered on the Cross, and by it, He saved the world. Every day I pray to my Son to forgive the sins of the world.\"\n\nThe Apparitions in the Chapel\n\nOpposite the Sacristy\n\n(Jan-Feb 1982 To Apr 11, 1985)\n\nThe apparitions since July 1981, often taking place in the church where they occurred spontaneously toward the end of the Rosary, are transferred to the room serving as a storeroom. It is opposite the sacristy, and provided privacy from the curiosity of the pilgrims, and every provocation on part of the police. This room was cleaned and decorated. Subsequently, it has since been called, chapel of the apparitions. Before the end of February this transfer was definitive, except for rare occasions.\n\nMonday, January 11, 1982\n\n\"I invite you very specially to participate at Mass. Wait for me at church, that is the agreeable place.\"\n\nThursday, January 14, 1982\n\nAfter the prayers, the songs and the questions, Our Lady reprimanded two visionaries because of their behavior, and recommended to them not to behave in this manner again. In case of observation, the other visionaries did not understand what Our Lady told those she reprimanded, and observed only her expression and guessed what it was all about. Those whom she reprimanded say that at that moment, she was gentle and attentive in respect for them.\n\nMonday, January 18, 1982\n\nOn the matter of a sick person with heart problems:\n\n\"There is little hope for her. I will pray for her.\"\n\nAfter her departure, the children see the Cross, the heart and the sun, signs which they perceive from time to time.\n\nWednesday, January 20, 1982\n\nMust the children from Lzbicno meet us tomorrow? They say that you told them of this meeting. \"It is not necessary for you to meet them.\"\n\nThey want to transfer Fr. Tomislav from here. What must he do?\n\n\"If it is in God's design, that he depart, as has been the case with Fr. Jozo, have him abandon himself to the will of God. He must think very much, and you must pray for him.\"\n\nThursday, January 21, 1982\n\nThe visionaries: Why don't you leave a concrete sign, so that the priests are convinced, and that they be converted in order to be able to convert the others? \"The sign will appear at the desired time.\"\n\nWhy are there apparitions in different places in Hercegovina?\n\n\"My children, don't you see that the faith begins to extinguish itself, and that it is necessary to awaken the faith among men?\"\n\nWhat must we do so that peace may reign among the priests?\n\n\"Fast and pray!\"\n\nFriday, January 22, 1982\n\nIs the apparition at Lzbicno coming from God or from the devil?\n\n\"It is coming from God.\"\n\nTuesday, February 2, 1982\n\nWhen must one celebrate the feast of The Queen of Peace? The Blessed Virgin smiled as she answered:\n\n\"I would prefer that it take place June 25th. The faithful have come for the first time on that day, on the hill.\"\n\nMonday, February 8, 1982\n\nVicka: Jakov and I were in the sacristy. When we began to pray the Our Father, the Gospa arrived. It was five minutes after six. We questioned her on the matter of a person who was sick, emotionally:\n\n\"He must pray. I will help him within the limitation of my power.\"\n\nTo the Slovenes who were praying while she was with us:\n\n\"Persevere in prayer.\"\n\nThen she blessed some religious articles.\n\nTuesday, February 9, 1982\n\nAt the fourth Our Father, the Blessed Virgin arrived. We always ask questions with respect to the sick:\n\n\"Pray for all the sick. Believe firmly. I will come to help, according to that which is in my power I will ask my Son, Jesus, to help them. The most important thing, in the meantime, is a strong faith. Numerous sick persons think that it is sufficient to come here in order to be quickly healed. Some of them do not even believe in God, and even less, in the apparitions, and then they ask for help from the Gospa!\"\n\nWednesday, February 10, 1982\n\nVicka: Jakov and I were alone. Just as every evening, we prayed, conversed with the Blessed Virgin, and asked many questions. To them she responded: \"Pray, Pray! It is necessary to believe firmly, to go to confession regularly, and likewise receive Holy Communion. It is the only salvation.\"\n\nHer preferred prayer is the Creed. When we recite it, the Blessed Virgin does not cease to smile. I think that no one has seen her happier than during this prayer.\n\nThursday, February 11, 1982\n\nJust like every evening, except on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, Jakov and I are alone. The Blessed Virgin begins first of all to pray the Our Father, then the Glory Be. We recommend the sick and then present her questions: \"Pray my angels, persevere! Do not let the enemy take possession of you in anything. Be courageous. Go in the peace of God, my angels. Goodbye.\"\n\nFriday, February 12, 1982\n\n\"Be more calm, more poised. Do not take sides with other children. Be agreeable, well mannered, pious!\"\n\nWhen Our Lady prays, she joins her hands. When she speaks she opens them and raises them toward Heaven, her palms turned upwards.\n\nSaturday, February 13, 1982\n\nTo the seminarians who were present: \"Through prayer, one obtains everything.\"\n\nSunday, February 14, 1982\n\nThere are four of us today. When we are in a group, I feel a little happier and joyful in the presence of the Holy Virgin. The others agree:\n\n\"Be together like brothers and sisters. Do not argue. Satan exists! He seeks only to destroy. With regards to you, pray, and persevere in prayer. No one will be able to do anything against you.\"\n\nTuesday, February 16, 1982\n\nThe Blessed Virgin began, Jesus in Your Name. Since she has appeared to us she hasn't been sad. Whatever she says, her countenance is smiling and filled with serenity. Her joy attracts us. She wants us to be joyful, wanting nothing to deceive us, no intrigues, or inventive stories.\n\n\"Satan only says what he wants. He interferes in everything. You, my angels, be ready to endure everything. Here, many things will take place. Do not allow yourselves to be surprised by him.\"\n\nFriday, February 19, 1982\n\nWe asked if we could pray the Hail Mary. She said yes. And while we prayed, she looked at us with a smile, but without praying with us. Truly, her beauty is indescribable. Since I have seen Our Lady, I have been filled with joy. Whatever her words may be, what she has told me, I have always done it. I have obeyed. She makes attentive remarks, as a mother.\n\n\"Listen attentively at holy Mass. Be well mannered. Do not chatter during holy Mass.\"\n\nSunday, February 21, 1982\n\n\"Be together, and do not argue, do not be disorderly. My angels, I will make you attentive. I will guide you on a sure way.\"\n\nTuesday, February 23, 1982\n\nWhen we asked Our Lady, she did not answer, but began immediately to pray. When we asked her if such a person were alive, she said:\n\n\"Do not ask me any more questions! I know what there is in each sick person, or what there is in my power to help him. I will pray to my Son to put out His mercy on each one.\"\n\nThursday, February 25, 1982\n\n\"Be persevering and courageous. Do not fear anything. Pray, and do not pay attention to others.\"\n\nWe asked for news about Fr. Jozo: \"Do not fear for him.\"\n\nSunday, February 28, 1982\n\n\"Thank Tomislav very much, for he is guiding you very well.\" Then she smiles, and begins to say the Glory Be. \"Go in the peace of God, my angels!\"\n\nMonday, March 1, 1982\n\n\"All of you be happy, and may my blessing accompany you at each step.\"\n\nShe blessed many religious articles; she touched them with her hands.\n\nSince the Yugoslavian authorities demanded that they put an end to the prayer meetings for the young people, the Blessed Virgin was questioned, and responded:\n\n\"It is better to temporarily suspend prayer meetings and those of meditation because of the authorities. Take them up later, when it will be possible.\"\n\nTuesday, March 2, 1982\n\nA woman, who had come from Osijek, brought two large pictures of the Pope. The Blessed Virgin came at 6:00pm with her smile. I believed she was smiling at us; but it was because of the pictures on the table. She said:\n\n\"He is your father, my angels.\"\n\nThen she began the Our Father. On leaving she said:\n\n\"Open the door well, follow the Mass well! Go in the peace of God, my angels! If you suffer for a just cause, blessings will be still more abundant for you.\"\n\nThursday, March 4, 1982\n\nI asked questions with respect to a woman who had no children. She is not of our faith. Our Lady said:\n\n\"Let her believe firmly. God, who comes to help everyone, will likewise help her. Be patient, my angels, do not be afraid of anything. I am at your side and guard you. If you have any problems, whatever it be, call me. I will come immediately and help you in advising you on best resolving the difficulty. Go in peace, my angels. Goodbye.\"\n\nFriday, March 5, 1982\n\nI questioned the Blessed Virgin on the matter of an Italian, who was very sick, and about another man who acquired cancer. She responded:\n\n\"Tell them to pray and to put themselves in the hands of God. I too, will call on the mercy of my Son. I will do everything in my power to help them. But it will be necessary to believe completely. Without a strong faith, nothing is possible. Goodbye my angels.\"\n\nSunday, March 7, 1982\n\nThe Blessed Virgin said that she has been with Ivan at the Seminary in Visoko: \"He prays well; he is obedient. He follows my instructions.\"\n\nMonday, March 8, 1982\n\nConcerning a boy named Bora (age 16), from Metkovic, who disappeared for a week:\n\n\"He left because of many troubles. He himself, created some of the problems.\"\n\nTuesday, March 9, 1982\n\nOn the matter of a young man from Hadromilje, named Mladen, who disappeared from his home:\n\n\"He has serious problems. It is necessary to pray for him very much, my angels. The people are beginning to be converted. Prayer has been taken up again, in the homes, where people had no longer prayed.\"\n\nBeginning of April 1982\n\nMirjana: Do you wish the establishment of a special feast in your honor?\n\n\"I wish a feast for the Queen of Peace, on the 25th of June, anniversary of the first apparition.\"\n\nEaster Sunday, April 11, 1982\n\nIs it necessary to establish prayer groups, formed by Priests, Sisters and laity in the parish?\n\n\"It is necessary, but not only here. Communities of prayer are necessary in all parishes.\"\n\n(It does not mean just Charismatic Groups, as the polemists, who are adversaries of this movement, have indicated.)\n\nWednesday, April 21, 1982\n\nFr. Vlasic questioned the visionaries and said: They say that the Blessed Virgin continues to appear to them every day. The messages can be summarized thusly: Be patient! Everything is developing according to God's plan. His promises will be realized. May one continue to pray, to do penance, and to be converted.\n\nThursday, April 22, 1982\n\nAre the luminous signs at the cross on Krizevac natural, or do they come from God? What does the letter 'S' and the letter 'T', which appear on the cross mean? \"They are signs of God, and not of natural phenomena. 'S' and 'T' are signs of salvation.\"\n\nSaturday, April 24, 1982\n\nWhat must one do in order to have more cures?\n\n\"Pray! Pray and believe firmly. Say the prayers which have already been requested. (7 Our Father's, Hail Mary's, Glory Be's, and the Creed.) Do more penance.\"\n\nSunday, May 2, 1982\n\n\"I have come to call the world to conversion for the last time. Later, I will not appear any more on this earth.\"\n\nThursday, May 6, 1982\n\nMay we write on a piece of paper the date of the great sign, describe it, seal it, and put it in the archives? (as requested by the commission).\n\n\"No! I have entrusted that only to you. You will unveil it when I will tell you. Many persons will not believe you, I know, and you will suffer very much for it. But you will endure everything, and you will finally be the happiest.\"\n\nThursday, May 13, 1982\n\nAfter the attempt on the life of John Paul II:\n\n\"His enemies have wanted to kill him, but I protected him.\"\n\nSpring, 1982\n\nQuestion asked at the request of the pastor at Lzbicno, alleged place of other apparitions: Why are there so many signs in Hercegovina?\n\n\"It is God who gives them. My children, have you not observed that faith began to extinguish itself? There are many who do not come to church except through habit. It is necessary to awaken the faith. It is a gift from God.\"\n\nPeople are surprised that you are appearing in so many places:\n\n\"If it is necessary, I will appear in each home.\"\n\nWith respect to the little visionaries from Lzbicno, which is located 36 miles from Medjugorje: In 1982-83, 18 persons, mostly females, said they received apparitions. The visionaries from Medjugorje were said to have received kind words from those in Lzbicno, but the Blessed Virgin reminded them strongly, that they must not have any contact with these persons, nor invite them to Medjugorje.\n\n\"Did I not tell you not to come together with those children? I am your mother, you must obey me.\"\n\nFor Jakov, who was crying to see Vicka ill:\n\n\"The cross is necessary because of the sins of the world.\"\n\nWednesday, June 23, 1982 (Possibly a few days preceding)\n\nJust before the anniversary of June 24th, Vicka answered some questions asked by Fr. Tomislav Vlasic, who reported them in the parish Chronicle in June. Our Lady said:\n\n\"The most important thing is that you, the visionaries, remain united. Let peace be among you. Pay very close attention to that. Obey, and do what the priests and your parents tell you. Go often to holy Mass and receive Communion. Be very attentive these days. Some dishonest people will come to you, in numbers, in order to tempt you. Be careful of your statements. These days, I am expecting of you, a very special discipline. Do not move around anywhere, or often, and do not separate from one another.\"\n\n(Some of the visionaries understood that these words were directed specifically to them, and they began to cry).\n\n\"A number of those who have been very enthusiastic will cool off. But you, persist, and be proud of each of my words. Have the people pray very much. Have them pray more for salvation, and only for salvation. And let the people be converted so long as it is possible. There are many sins, vexations, curse words, lies and other bad things. Let them be converted, go to confession and receive Holy Communion. Let them not print books on the apparitions before the anniversary has passed, because that could have some undesirable consequences. You have asked me to keep in this parish good and faithful priests who will continue the work. Do not be afraid of anything. This grace will be given to you. From priests, I do not demand anything other than prayer, with perseverance, and preaching. May they be patient and wait for the promises of God.\"\n\nWith respect to a question from a theologian: Does the Holy Spirit have two natures? \"He has only one; the Divine nature.\"\n\nThe visionaries: They have said that these would be the last apparitions on earth? Is it true? \"These apparitions are the last in the world.\"\n\nAs far as I have understood, observes Fr. Tomislav Vlasic, her answer is not only given in Medjugorje, but also in other parts of the world.\n\nThursday, June 24 or Friday, June 25, 1982\n\nBefore the evening Mass, during the apparition, the Virgin told the priests, through the intermediary of the visionaries:\n\n\"Thank the people in my name for the prayers, the sacrifices and the penance. Have them persevere in prayer, fasting and conversion, and have them wait with patience the realization of my promise. Everything is unfolding according to God's plan.\"\n\nMonday, July 12, 1982\n\nWill there be a third world war? \"The third world war will not take place.\"\n\nWednesday, July 21, 1982\n\nTo the response conveyed by Fr. Tomislav Vlasic on Purgatory:\n\n\"There are many souls in Purgatory. There are also persons who have been consecrated to God: some priests, some religious. Pray for their intentions, at least 7 Our Father's, Hail Mary's and Glory Be's and the Creed. I recommend it to you. There is a large number of souls who have been in Purgatory for a long time because no one prays for them.\"\n\nA response to a question on fasting:\n\n\"The best fast is on bread and water. Through fasting and prayer, one can stop wars, one can suspend the laws of nature. Charity cannot replace fasting. Those who are not able to fast can sometime replace it with prayer, charity and a confession; but everyone, except the sick, must fast.\"\n\nSaturday, July 24, 1982\n\nAnswer to some questions which were asked:\n\n\"We go to Heaven in full conscience: that which we have now. At the moment of death, we are conscious of the separation of the body and the soul. It is false to teach people that we are re-born many times and that we pass to different bodies. One is born only once. The body, drawn from the earth, decomposes after death. It never comes back to life again. Man receives a transfigured body. Whoever has done very much evil during his life can go straight to Heaven if he confesses, is sorry for what he has done, and received Communion at the end of his life.\"\n\nSunday, July 25, 1982\n\nA response to questions asked regarding Hell:\n\n\"Today many persons go to Hell. God permits his children to suffer in Hell due to the fact that they have committed grave unpardonable sins. Those who are in Hell, no longer have a chance to know a better lot.\"\n\nResponse to questions regarding cures:\n\n\"For the cure of the sick, it is important to say the following prayers: the Creed, 7 Our Father's, Hail Mary's and Glory Be's, and to fast on bread and water. It is good to impose one's hands on the sick and to pray. It is good to anoint the sick with holy oil. All priests do not have the gift of healing. In order to revive this gift, the priest must pray with perseverance and believe firmly.\"\n\nFriday, August 6, 1982 (Feast of the Transfiguration)\n\nA response to questions which were asked concerning Confession:\n\n\"One must invite people to go to Confession each month, especially the first Saturday. Here I have not spoken about it yet. I have invited people to frequent Confession. I will give you yet some concrete messages for our time. Be patient because the time has not yet come. Do what I have told you. They are numerous who do not observe it. Monthly Confession will be a remedy for the Church in the West. One must convey this message to the West.\"\n\nThat night Our Lady gave a sign to a group of young people who prayed with Ivan Dragicevic. Two luminary signs descended on Krizevac and the church... This phenomenon was observed by Fr. Tomislav Vlasic near the church.\n\nSunday, August 15, 1982\n\nThe vision lasted about seven minutes. The Gospa entrusted a new secret to Vicka and Ivanka. The others visionaries saw that it was about a secret, but they did not understand anything.\n\nMonday, August 16, 1982\n\nNo special message. Our Lady only corrected the very resonant and very rapid prayer of the visionaries, and the people in church.\n\nMirjana says that at the time of the apparition, she sometimes sees heavenly persons: Jesus, Mary, and angels in three dimensions, and earthly persons in two dimensions.\n\nWednesday, August 18, 1982\n\nMirjana reports to Fr. Tomislav Vlasic what the Gospa has told her concerning the sick:\n\n\"Have them believe and pray; I cannot help those who do not pray and do not sacrifice. The sick, just like those who are in good health, must pray and fast for the sick. The more you believe firmly, the more you pray and fast for the same intention, the greater is the grace and the mercy of God.\"\n\nQuestion asked with regard to a marriage planned between a Catholic and an Orthodox:\n\n\"In my eyes and in the sight of God, everything is equal. But for you, it is not the same thing because you are divided. If it is possible, it is better if she were not to marry this man because she will suffer and her children also. She will be able to live and follow only with difficulty, the way of her faith.\"\n\nSunday, August 29, 1982\n\nWith reference to the critiques on the apparitions, which have divided the priests in Hercegovina:\n\n\"I have not desired your division. On the contrary, I desire that you be united. Do not ignore the fact that I am the Queen of Peace. If you desire a practical advice: I am the Mother who has come from the people; I cannot do anything without the help of God. I, too, must pray like you. It is because of that, that I can only say to you: Pray, fast, do penance and help the weak. I am sorry if my preceding answer was not agreeable to you. Perhaps you do not want to understand it.\"\n\nTuesday, August 31, 1982\n\n\"I do not dispose all graces. I receive from God what I obtain through prayer. God has placed His complete trust in me. I protect particularly, those who have been consecrated to me. The great sign has been granted. It will appear independently of the conversion of the people.\"\n\nEnd of August 1982\n\nIvan is on the hill of Bijakovici with his friends. The Virgin appears to him. \"Now, I am going to give you a sign in order to strengthen your faith.\"\n\nThey see two rays of light, one on the church, the other on the Cross at Krizevac.\n\nSaturday, September 4, 1982\n\n\"Jesus prefers that you address yourselves directly to Him rather than through an intermediary. In the meantime, if you wish to give yourselves completely to God and if you wish that I be your protector, then confide to me all your intentions, your fasts, and your sacrifices so that I can dispose of them according to the will of God.\"\n\nSunday, September 26, 1982\n\nFor a religious who had come from Rome:\n\n\"Have her strengthen the faith of those who have been entrusted to her.\"\n\nFor Fr. Faricy, and Fr. Forrest: \"They are on the good path, have them persist.\"\n\nFor Pope John Paul II:\n\n\"Have him consider himself the father of all mankind, and not only of Christians. Have him spread untiringly and with courage the message of peace and love among all mankind.\"\n\nFriday, October 1, 1982\n\n\"I am happy because you have begun to prepare the monthly feast of the sacrament of Reconciliation. That will be good for the whole world. Persevere in prayer. It is the true way which leads you toward my Son.\"\n\nThursday, November 4, 1982\n\nRegarding a vision seen by Andja from Mostar one evening during prayer; He saw 13 persons coming from the East, and another evening 6 persons:\n\n\"It is about a true vision. They were some souls of her close family from Purgatory. It is necessary to pray for them.\"\n\nSaturday, November 6, 1982\n\nFrightened by the eighth secret, Mirjana prayed to the Blessed Virgin to preserve humanity from this calamity:\n\n\"I have prayed; the punishment has been softened. Repeated prayers and fasting reduce punishments from God, but it is not possible to avoid entirely the chastisement. Go on the streets of the city, count those who glorify God and those who offend Him. God can no longer endure that.\"\n\nMonday, November 8, 1982\n\nFr. Tomislav has the visionaries ask Our Lady if it is necessary to write to the Bishop, and to priests, so that they can call the faithful to intensify their prayers, or if it is better to wait for other events:\n\n\"It is better to wait than to precipitate that.\"\n\nMonday, November 15, 1982\n\nJakov: Must Vicka take the prescribed medicines, or must she have herself admitted to a hospital in Zagreb? \"It is necessary to send Vicka to Zagreb.\"\n\nVicka refused to question the Blessed Mother on this subject. She said that she wanted to accept whatever God sent her.\n\nSaturday, December 18, 1982\n\nWith respect to the article from the Bishop of Mostar in the journal, Vijesnik, on the events of Medjugorje; Fr. Tomislav Vlasic had the visionaries ask: Must we respond to the Bishop in writing?\n\n\"Yes, respond!\"\n\nMonday, December 20, 1982\n\nWith respect to the same article (Dec. 18, 1982), the visionaries ask: Is it necessary to give the faithful of Mostar objective information concerning the case in Hercegovina? \"No!\"\n\nIs it better for the visionaries to pray with you, and for the pilgrims to ask their questions to the priests instead?\n\n\"Yes, it is better that the children pray with me, and that the pilgrims ask the priests and look for solutions with them. In the meanwhile I will continue to answer the questions which they ask me.\"\n\nThursday, December 23, 1982\n\nTo Mirjana: \"On Christmas I will appear to you for the last time.\"\n\n(On a daily basis)\n\nSaturday, December 25, 1982\n\nTo Mirjana after she had received the tenth secret:\n\n\"Now you will have to turn to God in faith like any other person. I will appear to you on the day of your birthday and when you will experience difficulties in life. Mirjana, I have chosen you, I have confided in you everything that is essential. I have also shown you many terrible things. You must now bear it all with courage. Think of Me, and think of the tears I must shed for that. You must remain courageous. You have quickly grasped the messages. You must also understand now that I have to go away. Be courageous.\"\n\nMonday, December 27, 1982\n\nToday the statue of the Queen of Peace was finished. It was sculptured by Vipotnik, a sculptor from Slovenia, and painted by Luka Stojaknac, and Florijan Mickovic, who wanted to maintain anonymity. This statue has been a source of grace for Luka, who is Orthodox.\n\nThe Visionaries ask: May we put the statue in church? \"Yes, you may!\"\n\nIt is this statue which had been venerated for a long time in the nave. It was removed from there on orders from the bishop on March 25th, 1985. It then found itself consigned to the small chapel of the apparitions.\n\nFriday, December 31, 1982\n\nOn Vicka's request, the Blessed Virgin gives this message for the New Year: \"Pray as much as possible and fast!\"\n\nIn the evening, to the visionaries:\n\n\"You must persevere in prayer and fasting. I wish that the New Year will be spent in prayer and penance. Persevere in prayer and in sacrifice, and I will protect you and will hear your prayers.\"\n\nSaturday, January 1, 1983\n\nIvanka: Are you still appearing to Mirjana?\n\n\"After Christmas, I am no longer appearing to her for the present.\"\n\nWednesday, January 5, 1983\n\nFr. Tomislav receives from the four visionaries present (Ivan, Jakov, Marija and Vicka), the following information: Marija has received 7 secrets, Vicka 8, Jakov, Ivanka and Ivan 9, and Mirjana 10. We do not know how long the apparitions will last, nor why she no longer appears to Mirjana after Christmas. The Gospa invites us constantly to prayer, to fasting, to conversion... She confirms her promises.\n\nQuestioned with respect to the time of the sign: Which month? Which year?, Ivan says: It is forecast.\n\nFriday, January 7, 1983\n\nOur Lady begins to tell her life to the visionaries. They are invited to write down her testimony. They will not be able to make it public until they have received her authorization.\n\nThis dictation of her life lasted for Jakov until April, for Ivanka until May 22nd, and for Marija until July 17th.\n\nMarija, who was still attending a school for hairdressers in Mostar, received only an abridged account on the days when she was in Medjugorje. For Vicka, it lasted until April 10th, 1985, and is a long account which filled three notebooks. Up to this day, the visionaries have not received authorization to reveal the contents.\n\nMonday, January 10, 1983\n\nConfidences from Mirjana to Fr. Tomislav Vlasic: During the 18 months that I saw the Gospa, a great intimacy was established between us. I felt her maternal love. I could ask her all kinds of questions. Thus I asked her why God was so merciless in sending sinners to Hell for eternity.\n\n\"Men who go to Hell no longer want to receive any benefit from God. They do not repent nor do they cease to swear and to blaspheme. They make up their mind to live in Hell and do not at all contemplate leaving it.\"\n\n(Man's refusal is an irreversible choice.)\n\nQuestioned on the subject of Purgatory, the Blessed Virgin says:\n\n\"There are different levels of which the lowest are close to Hell and the highest gradually draw near to Heaven. It is not on all souls day, but at Christmas, that the greatest numbers of souls leave Purgatory. There are in Purgatory, souls who pray ardently to God, but for whom no relative or friend prays for them on earth. God makes them benefit from the prayers of other people. It happens that God permits them to manifest themselves in different ways, close to their relatives on earth, in order to remind men of the existence of Purgatory, and to solicit their prayers close to God who is just, but good. The majority go to Purgatory. Many go to Hell. A small number go directly to Heaven.\"\n\nWednesday, January 12, 1983\n\nRegarding an American television team: Will they be able to finish without difficulties? \"There will be some difficulties, but it will be for the glory of God.\"\n\nThursday, April 21, 1983\n\n\"You (the visionaries), must behave well; be pious and set a good example for the faithful.\"\n\nJakov admits that the Blessed Virgin has made remarks to him several times concerning his conduct. She has taught him how to participate at Mass, to pray, and to behave around others.\n\nSunday, April 24, 1983\n\nMessage for an Italian doctor who is present:\n\n\"I bless him just as those who work with him at the hospital in Milan, for everything they are doing. Have them continue, and pray. I bless the sick of this hospital, just like the sick for whom you have prayed this evening, and those for whom you will pray.\"\n\nThursday, May 5, 1983\n\nWith respect to a sick person from Vienna: The doctor has diagnosed schizophrenia. Some priests think it is a question of diabolical possession.\n\n\"It is a diabolic possession. One can succeed only through prayer.\"\n\nWednesday, June 1, 1983\n\n\"Dear Children: I hoped that the world would begin to be converted on its own. Do now, everything you can, so that the world can be converted.\"\n\nThursday, June 2, 1983\n\n\"Read what has been written about Jesus. Meditate on it, and convey it to others.\"\n\nFriday, June 3, 1983\n\nFr. Vlasic has begun to form a prayer group requested by the Virgin on May 25th. Jakov, Vicka, and Ivanka: What do you expect of Fr. Tomislav? Has he begun well? \"Yes, it is good. Have him continue.\"\n\nWhat should one do so that people will not drive away from here the priests who work with faith and love?\n\n\"Pray and fast for this intention. I will tell you when the moment comes, what you must do.\"\n\nFr. Tomislav wants to call the parish to prayer and fasting, so that the church recognizes that the events here are supernatural. It is a good way?\n\n\"Yes, it is a good way. Have the parish pray for this gift. Have them pray also for the gift of the Holy Spirit so that all those who come here will feel the presence of God.\"\n\nSunday, June 12, 1983\n\nIvan: May the priests begin new work around the church or must they request authorization from the authorities?\n\n\"Do not begin the work until receiving permission from the authorities. Otherwise, someone will inform the latter and the works would be forbidden. Go, and kindly request the authorization. It will be given to you.\"\n\nTuesday, June 14, 1983\n\nIvan: What do you wish that the priests preach during the ten anniversary days of the first apparitions?\n\n\"Have them do what they think is best. It would be good to remind the faithful of the events which have been revealed here in relation to my coming... Have them remind them the reasons for my coming here.\"\n\nSpring 1983\n\n\"Hasten your conversion. Do not await the sign, which has been announced, for those who do not believe. It will be too late. You who believe, be converted and deepen your faith.\"\n\nFriday, June 24, 1983\n\n\"The sign will come, you must not worry about it. The only thing that I would want to tell you is to be converted. Make that known to all my children as quickly as possible. No pain, no suffering is too great to me in order to save you. I will pray to my Son not to punish the world; but I beseech you, be converted. You cannot imagine what is going to happen nor what the Eternal Father will send to earth. That is why you must be converted! Renounce everything. Do penance. Express my acknowledgement to all my children who have prayed and fasted. I carry all this to my Divine Son in order to obtain an alleviation of His justice against the sins of mankind. I thank the people who have prayed and fasted. Persevere and help me to convert the world.\"\n\nSunday, June 26, 1983\n\n\"Love your enemies. Pray for them and bless them.\"\n\nFriday, July 1, 1983 (Toward 11:00pm on Krizevac)\n\n\"I thank all those who have responded to my call. I bless all of you. I bless each of you. In these days, I ask you to pray for my intentions. Go in the peace of God.\"\n\nBeginning of July 1983\n\nConcerning the tensions within the diocese:\n\n\"Fast two days a week for the intentions of the Bishop, who bears a heavy responsibility. If there is a need to, I will ask for a third day. Pray each day for the Bishop.\"\n\nSaturday, August 6, 1983\n\nOn orders from the Bishop, Fr. Pervan, the parish priest put an end to the custom which called for the visionaries beginning the prayers of the Rosary and the 7 Our Father's, Hail Mary's and Glory Be's. Jakov questioned the Blessed Virgin on this subject:\n\n\"If it is so, then do not go against it so as not to provoke any quarrels. If it is possible, talk about it tomorrow among yourselves. All of you come to an agreement beforehand.\"\n\nFriday, August 12, 1983\n\nThis was an exceptionally long apparition (38 minutes). The Blessed Virgin gives the visionaries instructions to guide their lives which only concerned them:\n\n\"Pray more for your spiritual life. Do your utmost in this sense. Pray for your Bishop.\"\n\nMonday, August 15, 1983\n\nTo the young people who are returning to school:\n\n\"Be careful not to diminish the spirit of prayer. Satan is enraged against those who fast and those who are converted.\"\n\nTuesday, August 23, 1983\n\nWith respect to Fr. Emilien Tardif, the Canadian priest of the charismatic renewal:\n\n\"Have him announce my messages to the whole world. Let Jesus, only Jesus, be at the center of his efforts.\"\n\nThursday, August 25, 1983\n\nFr. Tardif, Fr. Raucourt, and Dr. Phillippe Madre have been arrested and expelled by the Yugoslavian authorities:\n\n\"Do not worry for them. Everything is in God's plan.\"\n\nMonday, August 29, 1983\n\nFor the intention of a group of young people before their departure on their pilgrimage to Brijeg:\n\n\"I wish that you pray throughout your trip, and that you glorify God. There, you will be able to meet other young people. Convey the messages which I have given you. Do not hesitate to speak to them about it. Some begin to pray and to fast just as they have been told, but they get tired very quickly, and thus loose the graces which they have acquired.\"\n\nMonday, September 5, 1983\n\nThe mother of Jakov (12 years old) dies. The Blessed Virgin consoles him and reveals to him: \"Your mother is with me in Heaven.\"\n\nMonday, September 12, 1983\n\n\"Pray. When I give you this message, do not be content to just listen to it. Increase your prayer and see how it makes you happy. All graces are at your disposal. All you have to do is to gain them. In order to do that, I tell you again Pray!\"\n\nFriday, September 16, 1983\n\n\"Pray, pray, pray! Do not be discouraged. Be in peace because God gives you the grace to defeat satan.\"\n\n\"In my messages, I recommend to everyone, and to the Holy Father in particular, to spread the message which I have received from my Son here at Medjugorje. I wish to entrust to the Pope, the word with which I came here: 'MIR', (peace in Croatian), which he must spread everywhere. And here is a message which is especially for him: That he bring together the Christian people, through his words and his preaching; that he spread particularly among the young people, the messages which he has received from the Father in his prayers, when God inspires him.\"\n\nMonday, September 26, 1983\n\n\"My Son suffers very much because the world is not converting. May the world be converted and make peace.\"\n\nThursday, September 29, 1983\n\nFor three priests from Liverpool:\n\n\"Preach my messages. Speak about the events at Medjugorje. Continue to increase your prayers.\"\n\nSometime in September 1983\n\n\"I have already said many times that the peace of the world is in a state of crisis. Become brothers among you, increase prayer and fasting in order to be saved.\"\n\nSaturday, October 15, 1983\n\nTo Jakov:\n\n\"My Son suffers very much because men do not want to be reconciled. They have not listened to me. Be converted, be reconciled.\"\n\nThursday, October 20, 1983\n\nFor the parish:\n\n\"Have all the families consecrate themselves to the Sacred Heart each day. I am very happy when the entire family meets to pray each morning for half an hour.\"\n\nFriday, October 21, 1983\n\n\"The important thing is to pray to the Holy Spirit, so that He may descend on you. When one has Him, one has everything. People make a mistake when they turn only to the saints to request something.\"\n\nAdvent 1983\n\n\"Begin by calling on the Holy Spirit each day. The most important thing is to pray to the Holy Spirit. When the Holy Spirit descends on earth, then everything becomes clear and everything is transformed.\"\n\nSaturday, November 26, 1983\n\nOur Lady only said: \"Prayer and fasting.\"\n\nWednesday, November 30, 1983\n\nTo Marija, for a priest:\n\n\"You must warn the Bishop very soon, and the Pope, with respect to the urgent and the great importance of the message for all humanity.\"\n\nThursday, December 1, 1983\n\n\"Thanks to all of you who have come here, so numerous during this year, in spite of snow, ice and bad weather, to pray to Jesus. Continue, hold on in your suffering. You know well that when a friend asks you for something, you give it to him. It is thus with Jesus. When you pray without ceasing, and you come in spite of your fatigue, He will give you all that you ask from Him. For that, pray.\"\n\nWednesday, December 14, 1983\n\n\"Pray and fast! I am asking you for prayer.\"\n\nThursday, December 15, 1983\n\n\"Fast on Thursday and Friday for the Bishop.\"\n\nFriday, December 16, 1983\n\n\"Pray and fast only!\"\n\nMonday, December 26, 1983\n\nTo a question from Fr. Laurentin, Ivan conveys this answer from Our Lady: \"Our Lady prays for that. May he who undertakes it, do it in prayer. It is there that he will find his inspiration.\"\n\nWednesday, December 28, 1983\n\n\"My children, understand that the most important thing in our lives is prayer.\"\n\nDecember 1983\n\n\"There are many Christians who are no longer faithful, because they do not pray anymore. Have them begin again to recite each day, at least, 7 Our Father's, 7 Hail Mary's, 7 Glory Be's, and the Creed. Above all, abstain from certain television programs. They represent a great peril for your families. After you have seen them, you cannot pray any more. Give up likewise, alcohol, cigarettes, and pleasure of this kind.\"\n\n\"The fasting which you are doing in eating fish, instead of meat, is not fasting but abstinence. The true fast consists in giving up all our sins, but one must also renounce himself and make the body participate in it.\"\n\n\"Monthly confession will be a remedy for the Church in the west. Whole sections of the Church could be cured, if the believers would go to confession once a month.\"\n\nSunday, January 1, 1984\n\n\"My children, pray! I say again, pray, because prayer is indispensable to life.\"\n\nBeginning of 1984\n\nFor the intention of the pilgrims:\n\n\"When you are in the room of the apparitions or at the church, you should not preoccupy yourself with taking pictures. You should rather use the time to pray to Jesus, especially in those moments of particular grace during the apparitions.\"\n\nMonday, January 2, 1984\n\n\"Why have you stopped saying the prayer to the Holy Spirit. I have asked you to pray always and at all times so that the Holy Spirit may descend over all of you. Begin again to pray for that.\"\n\nThe visionaries had stopped saying the prayer to the Holy Spirit thinking that it was said only until Christmas.\n\nTuesday, January 3, 1984\n\n\"My children, pray; I say it again, pray! Know that in your life the most important thing is prayer.\"\n\nWednesday, January 4, 1984\n\n\"Before all, pray! That, I do not cease to ask you for.\"\n\nSunday, January 8, 1984 (Feast of the Epiphany)\n\n\"My children, pray! I say it again, pray! I will say it to you again. Do not think that Jesus is going to manifest Himself again in the manger; friends, He is born again in your hearts.\"\n\nSunday, January 15, 1984\n\n\"I know that I speak to you very often about prayer, but know that there are many people in the world who do not pray; who do not even know what to say, in prayer.\"\n\nTuesday, January 17, 1984\n\n\"Pray and fast! I wish that in your hearts prayer and fasting flourish.\"\n\nWednesday, January 18, 1984\n\n\"I wish to engrave in every heart the sign of love. If you love all mankind, then there is peace in you. If you are at peace with all men, it is the kingdom of love.\"\n\nThursday, January 19, 1984\n\n\"Pray and fast, because without prayer you cannot do anything.\"\n\nSaturday, January 21, 1984\n\n\"Pray and fast. Do not give up on meditation. At home meditate at least half an hour.\"\n\nSunday, January 22, 1984\n\n\"Pray and fast. I permit all those who mortify themselves, to do it at the most three times a week. May they not prolong it.\"\n\nMonday, January 23, 1984\n\n\"Pray and fast. You have not understood well, what it means to pray: If you can understand that, I desire it very much.\"\n\nTuesday, January 24, 1984\n\n\"Pray very much. I desire to permeate you with prayer.\"\n\nWednesday, January 25, 1984\n\n\"Pray and fast. You need enthusiasm in your prayer. May you pray in meditation for a long time and fervently.\"\n\nThursday, January 26, 1984\n\n\"Thank you for adoring my Son in the Sacred Host. That touches me very much. With respect to you, pray! I desire to see you happy.\"\n\nFriday, January 27, 1984\n\n\"Pray and fast. I wish that you deepen and continue your life in prayer. Every morning say the prayer of consecration to the Heart of Mary. Do it in the family. Recite each morning the Angelus, 5 Our Father's, Hail Mary's, and Glory Be's in honor of the Holy Passion and a sixth one for our Holy Father, the Pope. Then say the Creed and the prayer to the Holy Spirit. And, if it is possible, it would be well to pray a Rosary.\"\n\nSaturday, January 28, 1984\n\n\"I wish that all of you pray, and that my heart extend to the whole world. I wish to be with you.\"\n\nSunday, January 29, 1984\n\n\"Pray and fast! I wish for you to purify your hearts. Purify them and open them to me.\"\n\nMonday, January 30, 1984\n\n\"Pray! I desire to purify your hearts. Pray It is indispensable, because God gives you the greatest graces when you pray.\"\n\nWednesday, February 1, 1984\n\n\"It is raining at this time, and you say: 'It is not reasonable to go to church in this slush. Why is it raining so much? Why doesn't the rain stop?' Do not ever speak like that. You have not ceased to pray so that God may send you rain which makes the earth rich. Then, do not turn against the blessing from God. Above all, thank him through prayer and fasting.\"\n\nThursday, February 2, 1984\n\n\"Pray, because I need many prayers. Be reconciled, because I desire reconciliation among you and more love for each other, like brothers. I wish that prayer, peace, and love bloom in you.\"\n\nSaturday, February 4, 1984\n\n\"Pray, because prayer is very necessary to you. With prayer, your body and soul will find peace. There are some young people who have consecrated themselves to me. But there are in the parish, some persons, who have not entirely given themselves. As soon as Mass has ended, they are in a hurry to leave the church. That is not good. That way they will never be able to give themselves completely It is not good for them to linger about the church. One must be pious and set a good example for others, in order to awaken in them the faith. It is necessary to pray as much as possible while offering your heart. They should consecrate themselves in order to become truly better.\"\n\nSunday, February 5, 1984\n\n\"Pray and fast. I desire to live in your hearts.\"\n\nMonday, February 6, 1984\n\n\"Pray, pray, I ask of you.\"\n\nThursday, February 9, 1984\n\n\"Pray, pray! How many persons have followed other beliefs or sects and have abandoned Jesus Christ. They create their own gods; they adore idols. How that hurts me! If they could be converted. Like the unbelievers, they are many. That will change only if you help me with your prayers.\"\n\nFriday, February 10, 1984\n\n\"Pray and fast! I desire humility from you. But you can become humble only through prayer and fasting.\"\n\nSaturday, February 11, 1984\n\n\"Open your hearts to me, I desire to bless them fully.\"\n\nSunday, February 12, 1984\n\n\"Pray and fast! I ask of you. Pray for the peace and humility of your hearts.\"\n\nTuesday, February 14, 1984\n\n\"Pray and fast! I desire to purify your hearts completely. I wish to make you happy.\"\n\nWednesday, February 15, 1984\n\nIn very cold weather and an icy wind:\n\n\"The wind is my sign. I will come in the wind. When the wind blows, know that I am with you. You have learned that the Cross represents Christ; it is a sign of Him. It is the same for the crucifix you have in your home. For me, it is not the same. When it is cold, you come to church, you want to offer everything to God. I am, then, with you. I am with you in the wind. Do not be afraid.\"\n\nFriday, February 17, 1984\n\n\"My children, pray! The world has been drawn into a great whirlpool. It does not know what it is doing. It does not realize in what sense it is sinking. It needs your prayers so that I can pull it out of this danger.\"\n\nMonday, February 20, 1984\n\n\"Pray and fast! I desire to purify you and to save you. For that, help me with your prayers.\"\n\nTuesday, February 21, 1984\n\n\"Pray and fast! I expect generosity and prayers from your hearts.\"\n\nThursday, February 23, 1984\n\n\"I hold all of you in my arms. You are mine. I need your prayers so that you may be mine. I desire to be all yours and for you to be all mine. I receive all your prayers. I receive them with joy.\"\n\nFriday, February 24, 1984\n\n\"Pray and fast! I desire to be with you always. I desire to stay in your hearts always and for you to stay in mine.\"\n\nSaturday, February 25, 1984\n\n\"Know that I love all of you. Know that you are all mine. To no one do I desire to give more than to you. Come to me all of you. Stay with me. I want to be your Mother. Come, I desire all of you.\"\n\nSunday, February 26, 1984\n\n\"Pray and fast! Know that I love you. I hold all of you on my knees.\"\n\nMonday, February 27, 1984\n\n\"Do not be tired. I desire to be with you.\"\n\nTuesday, February 28, 1984\n\n\"Pray and fast! Love everyone on earth, just as you love yourselves.\"\n\nWednesday, February 29, 1984\n\n\"Pray! It may seem strange to you that I always speak of prayer. And yet I say: pray! Why do you hesitate? In Holy Scripture, you have heard say: 'Do not worry about tomorrow, each day will have its own worries.' Then do not worry about the other days. Be content with prayer, I your Mother, will take care of the rest.\"\n\nThursday, March 1, 1984\n\n\"Dear children, today I ask you to read the Bible in your homes, every day. Put it in a very visible place in your home, that way it will encourage all to prayer. May each one find his way to fast; he who smokes, may abstain from smoking; he who drinks alcohol, have him not drink. Have each one give up something which is dear to him. May these recommendations be conveyed to the parish.\"\n\nLent 1984 (March 7 - April 22)\n\n\"Do not be afraid for yourselves, you are already saved. Pray rather for those who are in sin and who do not believe.\"\n\nWednesday, March 14, 1984\n\n\"Pray and fast so that the kingdom of God may come among you. Let my Son set you aglow with His fire.\"\n\nThursday, March 15, 1984\n\n\"Dear children, pray! All agitation comes from satan. Your prayer should lead to peace.\"\n\nMonday, March 19, 1984\n\n\"Dear children, sympathize with me! Pray, pray, pray!\"\n\nThursday, March 22, 1984\n\n\"Pray each day the Veni Creator Spiritus (Come Holy Spirit) and the Angelus. God has given each one the will to decide for himself. My wish is for all to be converted, but I do not want to force anyone.\"\n\nSunday, March 25, 1984 (Annunciation)\n\nThe 1,000th apparition in Medjugorje.\n\n\"Rejoice with me and with my angels because a part of my plan has already been realized. Many have been converted, but many do not want to be converted. Pray.\"\n\nAfter these words, the Blessed Virgin began to cry.\n\nWednesday, March 28, 1984\n\n\"Many persons come here out of curiosity and not as pilgrims.\"\n\nFriday, March 30, 1984\n\n\"I wish that your hearts would be united to mine, like my heart is united to that of my Son.\"\n\nSunday, April 8, 1984\n\n\"I ask you to pray for the conversion of everyone. For that, I need your prayers.\"\n\nEaster Sunday, April 22, 1984\n\n\"We all rejoice in Heaven. Rejoice with us.\"\n\nMonday, April 23, 1984\n\n\"There is no need to give more information to the people, they already know what they are supposed to do.\"\n\nTuesday, April 24, 1984\n\nWith sadness and with tears:\n\n\"So many people, after they have begun here to pray, to be converted, to fast, and do penitence, quickly forget when they return home, and return to their bad habits.\"\n\n\"The information suffices. People already know enough. Tell them this place is a place of prayer. Pray as much as you can, pray however you can, but pray more always. Each of you could pray even four hours a day. But I know that many do not understand because they think only of living for their work.\"\n\nFr. Tomislav Vlasic then had this conveyed to Our Lady: If I tell this to the people, then they will go away completely.\n\n\"Even you do not understand. It is hardly a sixth of your day.\"\n\nMonday, June 4, 1984\n\n\"Dear children, I am happy that you have begun to pray as I requested of you. Continue.\"\n\nSaturday, June 9, 1984 (Vigil of Pentecost)\n\n\"Tomorrow evening, pray to receive the spirit of truth. More particularly, you, members of this parish. The spirit of truth is indispensable to you in order to convey the messages, such as I give them to you, without adding or deleting whatever it may be. Pray, so that the Holy Spirit inspires you, a spirit of prayer, so that you may pray more. I your mother, find that you pray too little.\"\n\nWednesday, June 13, 1984\n\n\"Dear children, I invite you to pray more, you and the entire parish, until the day of the anniversary. Let your prayer become a sign of offering to God. Dear children, I know that you are all tired. You do not know how to offer yourselves to me. Offer yourselves completely to me these days.\"\n\nSaturday, June 23, 1984\n\n\"Dear children, I am very happy that there are so many people here this evening. Thank God alone.\"\n\nSunday, June 24, 1984 (Feast of Corpus Christi)\n\nThe third anniversary of the apparitions.\n\n\"My Children, I thank you for each sacrifice that you have made during these days. Be converted, forgive each other, fast, pray, pray, pray!\"\n\nMonday June 25, 1984\n\n\"Thank you for all your sacrifices.\"\n\nTuesday, June 26, 1984\n\n\"When I say pray, pray, pray, I do not want to say to only increase the number of hours of prayer, but also to reinforce the desire for prayer, and to be in contact with God. Place yourself permanently in a state of spirit bathed in prayer.\"\n\nThursday, July 5, 1984\n\n\"Always pray before your work and end it with prayer. If you do that, God will bless you and your work. These last days, you have prayed little and worked very much. Pray more. In prayer, you will find repose.\"\n\nMonday, July 16, 1984\n\n\"I pray for the priests and the parishioners, that no one may be troubled. I know the changes which will take place soon, (in the parish clergy). At the time of the changes, I will be there. Also, do not be afraid, there will be in the future, signs concerning sinners, unbelievers, alcoholics and young people. They will accept me again.\"\n\nFriday, July 20, 1984\n\nLate in the evening, on the hill of the apparitions:\n\n\"Open your hearts to me, come close. Say in a loud voice your intentions, and your prayers.\"\n\nThe Blessed Virgin paid close attention to the prayers of the visionaries. When they prayed for the Bishop of Mostar, her eyes were filled with tears. While crying, she tells them:\n\n\"You are my little flowers. Continue to pray, my task is lighter because of it.\"\n\nOur Lady disappeared into Heaven, still crying, after having blessed everyone with a crucifix.\n\nSunday, August 5, 1984\n\nThe celebration of the second millennium of Mary's birthday was preceded by three days of fasting and continuous prayer. Seventy priests heard confessions without rest; there were a great number of conversions.\n\n\"Never in my life have I cried with sorrow, as I have cried this evening with joy. Thank you!\"\n\nIn anticipation of this day Our Lady had said:\n\n\"The priest who will hear confession will have great joy on that day.\"\n\nDuring these 3 days of fasting and continuous prayer the visionaries say the Blessed Virgin was: Very Joyful. Our Lady repeated:\n\n\"I am very happy, continue, continue. Continue to pray and to fast.\"\n\nHer joy seemed to have reached a peak Sunday, August 5th. Like a flower when it blooms, and full of joy, Our Lady said:\n\n\"Continue, continue, open your hearts, ask God and I will ask for you.\"\n\nMonday, August 6, 1984\n\n\"Continue and make me happy each day.\"\n\nThursday, August 9, 1984\n\n\"Dear children, satan continues to hinder my plans. Pray, pray, pray! In prayer, abandon yourselves to God. Pray with the heart. Thank you for your response to my call.\"\n\nSaturday, August 25, 1984\n\nTo Mirjana:\n\n\"Wait for me September 13th, I will speak to you about the future.\"\n\nFriday, August 31, 1984\n\n\"I love very specially the Cross which you have providentially erected on Mount Krizevac. Go there more often and pray.\"\n\nSaturday, October 13, 1984\n\nFor the priests of the Marian Movement of Priests:\n\n\"A message to you and to all those who love me. Dear children, pray unceasingly and ask the Holy Spirit to inspire you always. In everything that you ask, in everything that you do, look only for the will of God. Live according to your convictions and respect others.\"\n\nSaturday, October 20, 1984\n\n\"When you pray, you must feel more. Prayer is a conversation with God. To pray means to listen to God. Prayer is useful for you because after prayer everything is clear. Prayer makes one know happiness. Prayer can teach you how to cry. Prayer can teach how to blossom. Prayer is not a joke. Prayer is a dialogue with God.\"\n\nWednesday, October 24, 1984\n\nAt 10:00pm in the evening at Krizevac:\n\n\"My dear children, I am so happy to see you pray. Pray with me so that God's plan may be realized, thanks to your prayers and to mine. Pray more, and more intensely.\"\n\nSometime in October 1984\n\n\"I would like to guide you spiritually, but I would not know how to help you, if you are not open. It suffices for you to think, for example, where you were with your thoughts yesterday during Mass. When you go to Mass, your trip from home to church should be a time of preparation for Mass. You should also receive Holy Communion with an open and pure heart; purity of heart and openness. Do not leave the church without an appropriate act of thanksgiving. I can help you only if you are accessible to my suggestions; I cannot help you if you are not open. The most important in spiritual life is to ask for the gift of the Holy Spirit. When the Holy Spirit comes, then peace will be established. When that occurs, everything changes around you. Things will change.\"\n\nMonday, December 17, 1984\n\nMessage conveyed by the visionaries to Monsignor Franic, Archbishop of Split, during a retreat which he was making in Medjugorje:\n\n\"You will have to suffer more.\"\n\nTuesday, December 25, 1984\n\nThe Virgin did not give a message, but she appeared holding the Child Jesus in her arms.\n\nWednesday, January 2, 1985\n\nAt 11:30pm at night at Krizevac, the Virgin appeared surrounded by five angels:\n\n\"I am very happy to have been able to come here for three years, thanks to the prayers of believers. Continue to pray thusly. A part of my plan has been realized. God blesses in a special way, all those who are here. You can return happily to your homes. You do not immediately understand the reasons. Offer your prayers of thanksgiving for next week.\"\n\nWednesday, January 9, 1985\n\n\"I thank the faithful for having come to church in very bad and cold weather.\"\n\nSometime in January or February 1985\n\nTo Vicka, at the time of a prayer meeting on the mountain:\n\n\"My dear children, satan is strong. He wishes, with all his strength, to destroy my plans. Pray only, and do not stop doing it. I will also pray to my Son, so that all the plans that I have begun will be realized. Be patient and persevere in prayer. Do not permit satan to take away your courage. He works very hard in the world. Be on your guard.\"\n\nSunday, February 3, 1985\n\n\"I wish for Father Slavko to stay here, for him to guide the life and to assemble all the news, so that when I leave there will be a complete image of everything that has happened here. I am also praying now for Slavko and for all those who work in this parish.\"\n\nSunday, February 17, 1985\n\n\"Pray, dear children, so that God's plan may be accomplished, and all the works of satan be changed in favor of the glory of God.\"\n\nMonday, February 25, 1985\n\n\"For next week, I invite you to say these words: 'I love God in everything'. With love, one obtains everything. You can receive many things, even the most impossible. The Lord wishes for all the parishes to surrender to Him, and I too, in Him. I desire it. Each evening, make your examination of conscience, but only to give thanks in acknowledgment for everything that His love offers us at Medjugorje.\"\n\nFebruary - March 1985\n\n\"Dear children! You have always prayed that I not abandon you. Now I ask of you, in turn, not to abandon me. Satan wants especially during these days to disperse you. For that, pray very much these days.\"\n\n\"Dear children, I came again to thank you. You have not yet understood what that means. To give joy to my heart. It is a very great thing. I ask you only to persevere in prayer. As long as you pray I will have words for you. Good-bye, I thank you dear children. My love for you is unlimited; be happy with me, because I am happy with you.\"\n\nSaturday, March 9, 1985\n\n\"You can receive a grace immediately, or in a month, or in ten years. I do not need a hundred or two hundred Our Father's. It is better to pray only one, but with a desire to encounter God. You should do everything out of love. Accept all annoyances, all difficulties, everything, with love. Dedicate yourselves to love.\"\n\nWednesday, March 13, 1985\n\nMessage addressed to Vicka, when a mistake by Ivan, who was frightened, caused a stir.\n\n\"Pray, pray, pray! It is only with prayer that you will be able to avoid Ivan's error. He should not have written. And after that had to clearly acknowledge it, so as not to plant any doubts.\"\n\nMonday, March 18, 1985\n\nTo Mirjana:\n\n\"The rosary is not an ornament for the home, as one often time limits himself to usin"
