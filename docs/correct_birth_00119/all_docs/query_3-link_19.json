        "text": "The newly proposed rule stated “It is not a fault if one only of the server’s feet do not touch the ground at the moment at which the service is delivered. He shall place both feet on the ground immediately before serving, and not take a running or a walking start.” (New York Times, June 7, 1903).\n\nHis serve is a nightmare for any player to face. No one on tour likes to look at his draw and see Karlovic standing in his path.\n\nUnfortunately, the serve is all that the big guy has. The rest of his game fails to live up to his serving potential.\n\nLong before the days of high-tech rackets, Roscoe Tanner was scorching the earth with serves that set many an opponent back on his heels wondering what just flew by.\n\nHe is the father of the lethal serve—plus he was a lefty, which gave him a further advantage because the serve came from an angle his opponents were not used to or ready for–an advantage Rafael Nadal has evolved into an art form.\n\nTanner’s February 1978 serve of 153 mph was the fastest recorded serve in tennis history until Andy Roddick broke it in September of 2004 with a serve of 155 mph.\n\nIn the '70s, clocking serves was not typically done, nor was it accomplished with the accuracy it is today. But every player knew of the sheer power of Tanner’s serve and dreaded meeting Roscoe in any round of any tournament.\n\nTanner had a very low toss which he completed with quick wrist action giving him enhanced racket speed on his serves. His entire serving motion is very compact giving opponents almost no time to react because the ball is upon them so quickly.\n\nBecker used a variation on the Eastern forehand grip while serving which was quite unusual––some called it an Aussie grip or a exaggerated continental grip. It made the German’s serve almost impossible to read.\n\nNo small amount of Becker’s power came because he was a big man and he tried to get every ounce of his body weight packed into his serve.\n\nHis second serve was not light weight either. He used a little backspin on his serve to keep it low. On grass it used to skip.\n\nFrom the time he burst onto the scene in 1985 until Becker stopped playing in the late 1990s, his serve was his primary weapon.\n\nYou have to be robotically consistent. The high toss allows for more topspin as well as more leeway over the net.\n\nSuffering from shoulder injury most of 1999 and 2000, Ivanisevic came back unseeded and ranked out of the top 100 to win Wimbledon in 2001, primarily on the strength of his unorthodox serve.\n\nThe explosion as Sampras hits the ball, carrying his body forward all add to the heaviness or weight of the Sampras serve - the best ever probably in the history of the game.\n\nDuring his career, Sampras served a career high 1011 aces in 1993 and in 1994 he served 994 aces to lead the tour in both those years."
