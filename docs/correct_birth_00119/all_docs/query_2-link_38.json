        "text": "The reward for winning - a place amongst the top 16 nations in the Davis Cup World Group - is a desirable prize in itself, but Murray also harbours an almost overwhelming desire to give Henman the send-off he feels the Englishman deserves.\n\nMurray will bear responsibility not just for playing well for his country but for his friend as well, not to mention the rest of his team and the 11,000-strong sell-out crowd who will be watching; but, as he pointed out yesterday, it is all part of the job description.\n\n\"I hope it's going to be an inspiration. I think naturally I'll put more pressure on myself to win than I might normally do because it's Tim's last match and I want to play well for him too, so that might be difficult. But all the best players play better when there's pressure on them and that's what I'm going to try and do,\" he said.\n\nMurray will be expected to beat Cilic to put the home team one point ahead in the best-of-five match tie, which would then allow Henman to play the able Croatian No.1 Ivan Ljubicic with a good deal less pressure. A 2-0 lead, or even 1-1, would set things up nicely for tomorrow's doubles which, at the moment, is scheduled to feature Murray and his brother Jamie - they would be making their Davis Cup debut as a team - against Ljubicic and Lovro Zovko.\n\nHaving a specialist doubles player in Jamie Murray on the team gives captain John Lloyd a number of options and he is likely to make use of the Davis Cup rule which allows him to change the doubles team up to an hour before the match's scheduled 1pm start.\n\nAndy Murray is then scheduled to take on Ljubicic in the first reverse singles match on Sunday before Henman plays Cilic in a fifth rubber which, if it decides the tie, could stretch his nerves - and every else's - to their very limits.\n\nCilic, 18, beat Henman on grass at Queen's Club in June and can boast a win over Murray, although it came on clay at the French Open juniors in 2005.\n\nLjubicic was instrumental in helping Croatia win the Davis Cup in 2005 and is therefore a known quantity, but his team's chances of winning depend on how Cilic will react to the emotionally charged circumstances, starting today against Murray.\n\nMurray should be positively calm by comparison."
