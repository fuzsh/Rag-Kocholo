        "text": "“This fascinating collection of essays by an impressive team of scholars will become required reading for anyone interested in the still insufficiently researched and understood topic of Tito's Yugoslavia.” (Marko Hoare, Associate Professor of Economics, Politics and History, Kings University London, England)\n\n“New data, documents and emergence of silenced stories forces us to constantly reconsider what we thought we knew about past events and developments. The disintegration of the Yugoslav state may never be fully understood in all its complexity. To understand it better we need to know more about the time before, during and after its demise. This is why this book is important, timely and necessary.” (IngerSkjelsbæk, University of Oslo and PRIO, Norway, author of “The Political Psychology of War Rape: Studies from Bosnia and Herzegovina” (2011))\n\nGorana Ognjenović is Research Fellow at the University in Oslo, Norway.
