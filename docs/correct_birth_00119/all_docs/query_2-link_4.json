        "text": "Nadal became the oldest man to win the French Open on Sunday, when he won his 14th title in Paris and 22nd overall Grand Slam just two days after his 36th birthday. One man who was quick to congratulate him was the coach of one of his biggest rivals Federer, as Ivan Ljubicic called on the tournament to honour the Spaniard.\n\nThe retired former world No 3 took to Twitter, saying: “Not many PLAYED 14 @rolandgarros tournaments. He won it 14 times. There is no word to describe this feat.” And the Croat admitted that the French Open’s current tribute to Nadal - a statue on the grounds - was “not enough” as he made a huge request.\n\n“Don't think good old Phillippe would mind if his court changes the name to Rafael Nadal - statue is not enough,” Ljubicic added, claiming the tournament’s main showcourt - Court Philippe-Chatrier - should instead bear the name of the 14-time champion.\n\nJUST IN: Coco Gauff sets out bold Wimbledon goal after French Open heartbreak\n\nThe world No 5 already has a court on the ATP Tour named after him - a rarity for an active player as it's an honour usually reserved for those who have ended their careers. The main ‘Pista Rafa Nadal’ showcourt at the Barcelona Open is named after the Spaniard, who is a 12-time champion at the ATP 500 tournament.\n\nMessages of congratulations for Nadal have been pouring in along with Ljubicic’s tweet, as the 36-year-old’s young compatriot Carlos Alcaraz wrote: “Simply amazing. CONGRATULATIONS.”\n\nDON'T MISS\n\nFrench Open boss to introduce five sets to women's game\n\nNadal shows elite status with small symbol in French Open final\n\nFrench Open champ Swiatek stunned as reporter asks 'make-up' question"
