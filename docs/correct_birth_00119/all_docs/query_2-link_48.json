        "text": "“I am greeting all of the Croatian pilgrims from my heart, and especially those from the parish of St. James of Medjugorje. Your pilgrimage to Rome is part of the preparation for the coming of the Lord. Therefore, in hope, be evangelisers of God’s love in your nation. Praised be Jesus and Mary!”\n\n​\n\nPope Benedict XVI, December 1, 2010, greeting Croatian pilgrims in Rome.\n\nDear children! Today I am carrying my Son Jesus to you, that you may be his peace and a reflection of the clarity and joy of Heaven. Pray, little children, to be open to receive peace because many hearts are closed to the call of the light which changes hearts. I am with you and am praying for you to open yourselves to receive the King of peace, who fills your hearts with warmth and blessing. Thank you for having responded to my call.\n\nDear children! This is a time of grace and prayer, a time of waiting and giving. God is giving himself to you that we may love him above everything. Therefore, little children, open your hearts and families, so that this waiting may become prayer and love and, especially, giving. I am with you, little children, and encourage you not to give up from what is good, because the fruits are seen and heard of afar. That is why the enemy is angry and uses everything to lead you away from prayer. Thank you for having responded to my call. (Medjugorje message, November 25, 2018)\n\nDear Children! The Most High has sent me to you to teach you prayer. Prayer opens hearts and gives hope, and faith is born and strengthened. Little children, with love I am calling you: return to God, because God is love and your hope. You do not have a future if you do not decide for God; and that is why I am with you to guide you to decide for conversion and life, and not for death. Thank you for having responded to my call.\n\nThis simple but powerful comment was passed on by Fr Slavko Barbaric:\n\n“I know many who have given up drink, drugs, strife and hate. A young Italian pilgrim told me:\n\n‘I used to take drugs but gave them up, as last summer a friend of mine went to Medjugorje with drugs in his hand and returned with the Rosary.’”\n\n“So you are a king then?” said Pilate. It is you who say it” answered Jesus. Yes, I am a king. I was born for this, I came into the world for this: to bear witness to the truth; and all who are on the side of truth listen to my voice.”\n\nJohn 18 : 37\n\nOur pilgrimage goes from death to life: the fullness of life! We are on a journey, on a pilgrimage toward the fullness of life, and that fullness of life is what illumines our journey! Therefore death stands behind us, not before us. Before us is the God of the living (…) Before us stands the final defeat of sin and death, the beginning of a new time of joy and of endless light. But already on this earth, in prayer, in the Sacraments, in fraternity, we encounter Jesus and his love, and thus we may already taste something of the risen life.\n\nPope Francis, 10 November 2013\n\nArmistice Day, also known as Veterans Day, is commemorated every year on November 11 to mark the armistice signed between the Allies of World War 1 and German at Compiègne, France, at 5:45am for the cessation of hostilities on the Western Front of World War 1, which took effect at eleven in the morning – the “eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month. (Wikipedia)\n\n​\n\nThe feast of St Martin of Tours is celebrated on this day also, and sometimes referred to as Martinmas or St Martin’s Day. The fourth century Roman soldier, who later became a bishop in Gaul, features in Botticelli’s famous Primavera painting.

The photo gives the impression it’s an aerial view of Apparition Hill, perhaps taken from a drone camera. But it’s not. It was taken from ground level, and close to the town centre.\n\n* 1 Corinthians 13 : 9\n\nDear children! Today I thank you for your prayers. All of you have helped me so that this war may end as soon as possible. I am close to you and I pray for each one of you and I beg you: pray, pray, pray. Only through prayer can we defeat evil and protect all that Satan wants to destroy in your lives. I am your Mother and I love you all equally, and I intercede for you before God. Thank you for having responded to my call.\n\nMedjugorje message, February 25, 1994\n\nDear children! Today I wish to call you to pray daily for souls in purgatory. For every soul prayer and grace is necessary to reach God and the love of God. By doing this, dear children, you obtain new intercessors who will help you in life to realise that all the earthly things are not important for you, that only Heaven is that for which it is necessary to strive. Therefore, dear children, pray without ceasing that you may be able to help yourselves and the others to whom your prayers will bring joy. Thank you for having responded to my call.\n\nMedjugorje message, November 06, 1986\n\nDear children! I invite you to prayer now when Satan is strong and wishes to make as many souls as possible his own. Pray, dear children, and have more trust in me because I am here in order to help you and to guide you on a new path toward a new life. Therefore, dear little children, listen and live what I tell you because it is important for you when I shall not be with you any longer that you remember my words and all that I told you. I call you to begin to change your life from the beginning and that you decide for conversion not with words but with your life. Thank you for having responded to my call.\n\nMedjugorje message, October 25, 1992\n\n“Everybody who does wrong hates the light and avoids it, for fear his actions should be exposed; but the man who lives by the truth comes out into the light, so that it may be plainly seen that what he does is done in God.” John 3 : 30-31\n\nJesus was speaking to the pharisee Nicodemus who came to Jesus under the cover of darkness but later demonstrated his good works and faith when he brought embalming spices and assisted Joseph of Arimathea with the burial of Jesus.\n\nDear children! The Most High permits me to be with you, and to be joy for you and the way in hope, because mankind has decided for death. That is why He sent me to keep instructing you that without God you do not have a future. Little children, be instruments of love for all those who have not come to know the God of love. Witness joyfully your faith and do not lose hope in a change of the human heart. I am with you and I am blessing you with my motherly blessing. Thank you for having responded to my call.\n\nSaint Pius V established this feast in 1573. The purpose was to thank God for the victory of Christians over the Turks at Lepanto—a victory attributed to the praying of the rosary. Clement XI extended the feast to the universal Church in 1716.\n\nThe development of the rosary has a long history. First a practice developed of praying 150 Our Fathers in imitation of the 150 Psalms. Then there was a parallel practice of praying 150 Hail Marys. Soon a mystery of Jesus’ life was attached to each Hail Mary. Though Mary’s giving of the rosary to Saint Dominic is recognised as a legend, the development of this prayer form owes much to the followers of Saint Dominic. One of them, Alan de la Roche, was known as “the apostle of the rosary”. He founded the first Confraternity of the Rosary in the 15th century. In the 16th century, the rosary was developed to its present form—with the 15 mysteries: joyful, sorrowful and glorious. In 2002, Pope John Paul II added the five Mysteries of Light to this devotion.\n\n​\n\nsource: Franciscan Media\n\nCroatia’s national football team coach Zlatko Dalic recently completed a 120-kilometre pilgrimage to Medjugorje ahead of the upcoming World Cup in Qatar next month. The 55-year-old coach walked from his hometown of Livno in Bosnia along with three friends.\n\n​\n\nAlong with a photo of himself praying in front of a statute of the Virgin Mary, Dalic posted a message on his Instagram account after completing his pilgrimage: “Three days – 120 kilometres. Thank you Mother of God for all the blessings! In you, Lord, I trust!.”\n\n“I’ve been a believer all my life… Faith gives me strength, I always have a rosary in my pocket and I pray before the match. I thank God for every day, because he gave me strength and faith, but also the opportunity to do something in my life,” he told a Catholic weekly Glas Koncila in 2017.\n\nDear children! Today, like never before, I invite you to prayer. Let your prayer be a prayer for peace. Satan is strong and desires to destroy not only human life, but also nature and the planet on which you live. Therefore, dear children, pray that through prayer you can protect yourselves with God’s blessing of peace. God has sent me among you so that I may help you. If you so wish, grasp for the rosary. Even the rosary alone can work miracles in the world and in your lives. I bless you and I remain with you for as long as it is God's will. Thank you for not betraying my presence here and I thank you because your response is serving the good and the peace. Medjugorje message, January 25, 1991\n\nDear children! Pray that the Holy Spirit may enlighten you that you be joyful seekers of God and witnesses of love without bounds. I am with you, little children, and, anew, I am calling all of you: take courage and bear witness to the good works that God is doing in and through you. Be joyful in God. Do good to your neighbour so that it will be good for you on earth and pray for peace, which is threatened because Satan wants war and peacelessness. Thank you for having responded to my call.\n\nThe cross is today the universal image of Christian belief. Countless generations of artists have turned it into a thing of beauty to be carried in procession or worn as jewelry. To the eyes of the first Christians, it had no beauty. It stood outside too many city walls, decorated only with decaying corpses, as a threat to anyone who defied Rome’s authority — including Christians who refused sacrifice to Roman gods. Although believers spoke of the cross as the instrument of salvation, it seldom appeared in Christian art unless disguised as an anchor or the Chi-Rho until after Constantine’s edict of toleration.\n\nsource: Franciscan Media\n\nThe feast of the Most Holy Name of Mary began in Spain in 1513 and in 1671 was extended to all of Spain and the Kingdom of Naples. In 1683, John Sobieski, king of Poland, brought an army to the outskirts of Vienna to stop the advance of Muslim armies loyal to Mohammed IV of Constantinople. After Sobieski entrusted himself to the Blessed Virgin Mary, he and his soldiers thoroughly defeated the Muslims. Pope Innocent XI extended this feast to the entire Church. source: Franciscan Media\n\nRemember, O most gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known that anyone who fled to your protection, implored your help, or sought your intercession was left unaided.\n\nInspired by this confidence, I fly unto you, O Virgin of virgins, my mother; to you do I come, before you I stand, sinful and sorrowful. O Mother of the Word Incarnate, despise not my petitions, but in thy mercy hear and answer me. Amen.\n\nMembers of the mountain rescue services in BiH were involved in three different rescue operations at Medjugorje last weekend involving pilgrims from Ireland, Slovakia and Ukraine. A 53-year-old Irish citizen was found unconscious on Križevac. Ten rescuers participated in the rescue, and with the help of their colleagues from Čapljina and Ljubuški, successfully treated and transported the injured woman, who was handed over to the Čitluk emergency medical service for further care. Female citizens from Ukraine and Slovakia were also rescued in two different actions on Apparition Hill. The person from Slovakia had sustained an ankle injury. After being immobilised, she was transported to the foothills where she received medical help in Čitluk. source: brotnjo.info\n\nDear children! God permits me to be with you and to lead you on the way of peace, so that through personal peace, you build peace in the world. I am with you and intercede for you before my Son Jesus, that he may give you a strong faith and hope in a better future, which I desire to build up with you. You be courageous and do not be afraid, because God is with you. Thank you for having responded to my call.\n\nRose of Lima (born Isabel Flores de Oliva; 20 April 1586 – 24 August 1617) was a member of the Third Order of Saint Dominic in Lima, Peru, who became known for both her life of severe penance and her care of the poverty stricken of the city through her own private efforts. Rose of Lima was born to a noble family and is the patron saint of embroidery, gardening and cultivation of blooming flowers. A lay member of the Dominican Order, she was declared a saint by the Catholic Church, being the first person born in the Americas to be canonised as such.\n\nsource: Wikipedia\n\nPope Pius XII established this feast in 1954, but the Blessed Virgin Mary’s queenship has roots in Scripture. At the Annunciation, Gabriel announced that Mary’s Son would receive the throne of David and rule forever. At the Visitation, Elizabeth calls Mary “mother of my Lord.” As in all the mysteries of Mary’s life, she is closely associated with Jesus: Her queenship is a share in Jesus’ kingship. We can also recall that in the Old Testament the mother of the king has great influence in court.\n\nIn the fourth century Saint Ephrem called Mary “Lady” and “Queen.” Later, Church fathers and doctors continued to use the title. Hymns of the 11th to 13th centuries address Mary as queen: “Hail, Holy Queen,” “Hail, Queen of Heaven,” “Queen of Heaven.” The Dominican rosary and the Franciscan crown as well as numerous invocations in Mary’s litany celebrate her queenship.\n\nThe feast is a logical follow-up to the Assumption, and is now celebrated on the octave day of that feast. In his 1954 encyclical To the Queen of Heaven, Pius XII points out that Mary deserves the title because she is Mother of God, because she is closely associated as the New Eve with Jesus’ redemptive work, because of her preeminent perfection, and because of her intercessory power.\n\nsource: franciscanmedia.com\n\nThrough towns and villages Jesus went teaching, making his way to Jerusalem. Someone said to him, “Sir, will there be only a few saved?” He said to them, “Try your best to enter by the narrow door, because I tell you, many will try to enter and will not succeed.”\n\n​\n\nLuke 13 : 22-24\n\nIt was not the most elegant start to the day. The sculpture was trundled down to the Herefordshire riverbank on a sack truck borrowed from a builder before being bolted and strapped to a makeshift catamaran constructed out of two canoes.\n\nBut after that, it was much more graceful and serene as the peculiar vessel was pushed off into the current, and craft and carving, Our Lady of the Waters and the Wye, began to meander downstream.\n\nThe idea of the project, conceived by the artist Philip Chatfield and Father Richard Williams, the parish priest of St Mary’s church in the Welsh town of Hay-on-Wye, is to raise awareness about the plight of the Wye, one of the most beautiful rivers in the west of Britain but suffering ”heartbreaking” amounts of pollution from industrial chicken factories along its banks.\n\n• Full story at theguardian.com\n\nOn the foundations of the old parish church in Medjugorje there is a votive chapel built in 1931, in thanksgiving for protection from storms. For a long time, the chapel served as an outdoor altar where Holy Mass was celebrated due to the danger of the parish church being demolished. On the initiative of Msgr Alda Cavallio, apostolic visitor with a special role for the parish of Medjugorje, and former pastor Fr Marinko Šakota, the vow chapel was renamed the Chapel of Life, where there is a statue of Our Lady, Queen of Peace with the child Jesus in her arms.\n\nSource: Radio Station Mir Medjugorje.

You be joyful witnesses of God’s word and love, and with hope in the heart which conquers every evil. Forgive those who inflict evil on you, and go on the way of holiness. I am leading you to my Son, for him to be the way, the truth and the life for you. Thank you for having responded to my call.\n\nLast week the Vatican backed the decision made in 2021 by Bishop Felix Genn of Münster to dissolve a lay association in his diocese, whose foundations are tied to the Marian apparitions in Medjugorje, and which was charged with alleged spiritual abuse.\n\nRecognised in 2004 by the German Diocese of Münster as a private association of believers under diocesan law, the “Totus Tuus New Evangelization” group has roots going back to the 1980s. Full report at this link.\n\nToday is the Feast of Our Lady of Carmel. The Italian Renaissance artist, Sandro Botticelli, referred to Our Lady of Carmel in several of his paintings. This detail from his painting known as the Madonna and Child with the Infant St John the Baptist is one example. It’s exhibited at the Barber Institute on the campus of the University of Birmingham, England.\n\nFr Marinko Šakota is no longer the pastor of the parish of St James the Apostle at Medjugorje. The new pastor, who was already serving at Medjugorje as a parish vicar, is Zvonimir Pavičić. A new arrival at Medjugorje to serve as a parish vicar is Ivan Hrkać. He replaces Mladen Herceg who has moved to the parish of St Anthony of Padua at Humac. Rental Galić has also moved on from Medjugorje.\n\nOther priests who served at Medjugorje in past years have also been transferred. Fr Svetozar Kraljević is now parish vicar at SS Peter and Paul in Mostar and replaces Fr Danko Perutina who is made pastor at the same parish.\n\nFr Petar Ljubičić who served as parish vicar in Vitina has been appointed to the same post at Humac.\n\nIn recent days, the project “Give Hope” took place in Medjugorje. It was the sixth occasion people from Medjugorje and Romania had opened their hearts, together with the project manager Luciano Omani who provided money for orphans from Romania to go on a free pilgrimage to Medjugorje. Parishioners from Medjugorje provided free food for the children and took care of accommodation.\n\nThis year, 41 children came to mark the 41st year of Our Lady’s apparitions. The children spent the past six days in prayer and fellowship, participating in the evening prayer programme, praying on Apparition Hill and Križevac. They also had spiritual renewal in the Franciscan Monastery of the Assumption of Mary on the island of Badija near Korčula.\n\nOn the last day of their pilgrimage, parish priest Fr Marinko Šakota, spoke words of encouragement to the chldren. He emphasised that despite the cross they have in their lives, they should not forget that they have a Mother who loves and accepts them as her own children.\n\nSource: Mateo Ivanković / Radio station Mir Međugorje"
