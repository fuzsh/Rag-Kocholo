        "text": "Alexander Mikhailovich Ovechkin (born September 17, 1985), often referred to as \"Ovi\" or \"the Great Eight\", is a Russian professional ice hockey winger and captain of the Washington Capitals of the National Hockey League (NHL). Prior to entering the league, Ovechkin played for Dynamo Moscow of the Russian Superleague for four seasons, from 2001 until 2005, and returned to play for them briefly during the 2012–13 NHL lockout. A highly touted prospect, Ovechkin was selected by the Capitals first overall in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft. With the 2004–05 NHL lockout cancelling the season, Ovechkin remained in Russia until 2005, joining the Capitals for the 2005–06 season. He won the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year, scoring 52 goals and 54 assists to lead all rookies with 106 points and finishing third overall in league scoring. Ovechkin has led the NHL in goal scoring (for which the Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy is awarded) an NHL record eight times. His first such title came in the 2007–08 season, when his 65 goals and 112 points also earned him the Art Ross Trophy for most points scored, the Hart Memorial Trophy for most valuable player, and the Lester B. Pearson Award for best player as voted on by the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA). Ovechkin would again win the Richard Trophy, Hart Trophy, and Pearson Award in 2009, and won the Ted Lindsay Award (the renamed Pearson Award) for a third consecutive year in 2010; this also marked the fifth straight year that he was named to the First All-Star Team. After some years of decreased scoring, Ovechkin reclaimed the goal scoring title in 2013, earning the Richard Trophy and his third Hart Trophy. He would repeat as the Richard Trophy winner in 2014, 2015, and 2016, scoring at least 50 goals each season and becoming only the third player to score 50 goals in seven different seasons. Ovechkin reached 600 career NHL goals in 2018 and is considered one of the greatest goal scorers in NHL history. In 2017, Ovechkin was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players of all-time. After ten playoff runs with the Washington Capitals, Ovechkin won his first Stanley Cup in 2018, as well as the Conn Smythe Trophy for most valuable player in the 2018 playoffs. Internationally, Ovechkin has represented Russia in multiple tournaments. His first IIHF tournament was the 2002 World U18 Championship. The following year he made his debut at the World Junior Championship, helping Russia win the gold medal. He played two more years at the World Juniors, as well as once more at the World U18 Championships. Ovechkin's first senior tournament was the 2004 World Championship, and he also played in the World Cup that year. Ovechkin has also played for Russia at the Winter Olympics in 2006, 2010, and 2014. Overall, Ovechkin has represented Russia at eleven World Championships and three Olympics in his career, winning the World Championship three times.\n\nJohn Ritter, born on September 17, 1948 in Burbank, California, was an American actor and comedian of extraordinary talent. His parents, Tex Ritter and Dorothy Fay, were both film stars, so it might seem as if Ritter was destined for a career in show business. Yet, he didn't take acting seriously until college where he studied drama at the University of Southern California under Nina Foch, earning his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1971. Ritter's career in entertainment launched with appearances in various stage productions and TV series, but his real breakthrough came in 1977 when he was cast as Jack Tripper in Three's Company. This role catapulted Ritter to stardom, showcasing his gift for comedic timing and physical humor. He received an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe for his performance on the show which aired for eight seasons. Following Three's Company, he continued to build a diverse career, performing in a wide range of roles in television, film, and theater. Off stage and screen, Ritter was known for his philanthropy and family values. He married actress Amy Yasbeck in 1999, with whom he had a daughter, Stella. Ritter also had three children from a previous marriage. Tragically, Ritter's life was cut short on September 11, 2003, due to an undiagnosed aortic dissection. Despite his untimely death, his legacy lives on through his extensive body of work, his contributions to charitable causes, and his influence on future generations of comedians and actors.\n\nAnne Bancroft, a name synonymous with the world of theater, film, and television, was born Anna Maria Louisa Italiano in the Bronx, New York City, in 1931. Her parents, Michael and Mildred Italiano, were children of Italian immigrants, and they instilled in young Bancroft a deep appreciation for her cultural heritage. Bancroft's journey into the performing arts began at an early age when she started attending the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York after graduating from Christopher Columbus High School. Bancroft's acting career spanned over half a century, during which she received numerous accolades and established herself as one of Hollywood's most versatile actresses. She won an Academy Award, two BAFTAs, two Golden Globes, and two Tony Awards, a testament to her talent and dedication. Despite her success in Hollywood, Bancroft never lost her love for the theater and often returned to Broadway, where she gave several memorable performances. Her role as Mrs. Robinson in the 1967 film The Graduate is arguably her most iconic, earning her an Academy Award nomination and forever cementing her place in cinematic history. Beyond her professional achievements, Bancroft led a rich personal life. In 1964, she married comedian and filmmaker Mel Brooks, a union that lasted until her untimely death in 2005. The couple had one son, Max Brooks, who became a successful author and screenwriter. Although Bancroft passed away from uterine cancer, her legacy lives on through her timeless performances, her contributions to the arts, and her unwavering commitment to her craft. The life and career of Anne Bancroft serve as a shining example of the power of passion, perseverance, and talent.\n\nKyle Chandler, an award-winning American actor, first graced television screens in the 1980s, steadily carving out a successful career in both television and film. Born on September 17, 1965, in Buffalo, New York, Chandler was drawn to acting from a young age. After graduating with a degree in drama from the University of Georgia, he moved to Los Angeles to pursue his dream. Chandler's breakthrough came with the role of Jeff Metcalf in the ABC drama Homefront, which ran from 1991 to 1993. But it was his portrayal of Coach Eric Taylor in NBC's critically acclaimed series Friday Night Lights that earned him widespread recognition and respect within the industry. His nuanced performance garnered him an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, solidifying his reputation as a powerhouse performer. He also made significant strides in the film industry, delivering notable performances in movies such as Argo, The Wolf of Wall Street, and Manchester by the Sea. Despite his celebrity status, Chandler remained down-to-earth and committed to his craft, carefully selecting roles that challenged him as an actor and resonated with audiences."
