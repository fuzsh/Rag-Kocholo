        "text": "The latest man to be on the business end of 21-year-old Milos Raonic's supersonic serve -- sometimes easier heard than seen -- was aging American pro James Blake. Not unreasonably, Blake lost their third-round U.S. Open match Saturday, 6-3, 6-0, 7-6 (3).\n\nRaonic surpassed the 140-mph mark in each set, with a top speed of 143. He served 29 aces, giving him 89 in his three Open matches. He allowed Blake a glimpse at only two break points -- both saved by Raonic -- through the first two sets. (Blake finally got one break in the third.)\n\nBlake, once as high as No. 4 in the rankings but now 115th at 32 after knee surgery, never had a chance against the young Canadian, seeded 15th here.\n\n\"Just makes for a day of not-so-much-fun tennis,\" Blake said. \"With that serve, it can take him a long way because that can take the racket out of another guy's hands, completely take the rhythm out of a match.\"\n\nRaonic, born in Montenegro, moved with his parents to Canada when he was 3 but \"never got on the ice\" in that hockey-mad nation.\n\n\"I'm from Montenegro,\" he said. \"I don't think you've ever heard of a hockey player from Montenegro, so my parents said, 'Try tennis.' \"\n\nThe cognoscenti already can envision Raonic, referred to as \"The Missile,\" as a future Grand Slam contender, with an opportunity to measure his progress Monday against No. 3 Andy Murray.\n\nrecommendedU.S. Open: Men's results\n\nIn other action featuring Americans on the Open's Day 6, 19-year-old Jack Sock was beaten by Spain's Nicolas Almagro, the No. 11 seed, 7-6 (3), 6-7 (4), 7-6 (2), 6-1, before a packed and boisterous Grandstand crowd.\n\n\"The energy from that crowd was unbelievable,\" Sock said. \"Great feeling.\""
