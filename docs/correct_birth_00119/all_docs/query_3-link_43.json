        "text": "It wasnât the most storybook ending, but Tomas Berdych will leave behind a legacy that includes a Grand Slam final, 13 ATP titles, and a career high ranking of No. 4.\n\nStruggling with injuries and a falling ranking, the Czech is set to announce his retirement from professional tennis on Saturday in London at the ATP Finals. Berdych will be remembered as one of the best ball-strikers to ever take the court, and one of the best players never to win a Grand Slam.\n\n2\n\nIn 2013, Berdych and his Czech team ran it back for a second consecutive Davis Cup Title. In 2018, Berdych called it quits for Davis Cup competition. âOne of the most beautiful tennis chapters is over,â he said. âIâm truly happy that I was part of the Czech team that has won Davis Cup two times.\""
