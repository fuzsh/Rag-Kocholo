        "text": "Yes. On Thursday, September 15, 2022, Roger Federer announced that he would be retiring from professional tennis due to his ongoing knee issues. Then aged 41, he played his final match at the 2022 Laver Cup on Friday September 23, 2022 at the O2 Arena in London.\n\nFederer partnered with rival and old friend Rafael Nadal and the duo went down to Team World’s Jack Sock and Frances Tiafoe 4-6, 7-6, 11-9.\n\nWhy did Roger Federer retire?\n\nFederer made his retirement announcement on social media with the letter, which he also read out in a video.\n\nHaving had two knee operations in 2020 – missing 13 months of the Tour – Federer returned to action in March 2021 but played only fleetingly up to Wimbledon. In August 2021, he announced he would need a third operation on his right knee and would be out for “several months”.\n\nOn November 17, 2021, in an interview with Swiss newspapers “Tribune de Geneve” and “24 heures”, Federer said he would not be back in time for the Australian Open and described himself as “incredibly unlikely” to play at Wimbledon in 2022. However, the 40-year-old had still harboured hopes that he could enjoy some big moments on the ATP Tour until his announcement.\n\n“The past three years have presented me with challenges in the form of injuries and surgeries,” Federer said in a statement on social media. “I’ve worked hard to return to full competitive form. But I also know my body’s capacities and limits, and its message to me lately has been clear.\n\n“I am 41 years old. I have played more than 1500 matches over 24 years. “Tennis has treated me more generously than I would ever have dreamt and now I must recognise when it’s time to end my competitive career.”\n\nHe signed off his career in an emotional farewell at London’s O2, which had almost all of his team-mates in tears as he thanked everyone for their part in his career.\n\nHas Roger Federer made a documentary about his retirement?\n\nYes. ‘Federer: Twelve Final Days’ will be released on Amazon Prime Video on June 20, 2024. It follows Federer over the course of the last 12 days of his professional tennis career and goes behind the scenes of the Laver Cup as he plays his final match.\n\nWhat WAS the INJURY THAT FORCED Roger Federer TO RETIRE?\n\nIn August 2021, Roger Federer announced that he would be having a third operation on his right knee. The operation went well but recovery will take longer than first thought. He remained hopeful until just after Wimbledon, 2022, when he received the results of another scan.\n\n“Then I also got a scan back which wasn’t what I wanted it to be,” he said at the Laver Cup In September 2022. “At some point you sit down and go, OK, we are at an intersection here, at a crossroad, and you have to take a turn. Which way is it?\n\n“I was not willing to go into the direction of let’s risk it all. I’m not ready for that.\n\nHow did Federer describe his decision to retire?\n\nAt a press conference at the Laver Cup, Federer explained why he had used the word “bittersweet” in his retirement letter.\n\n“The bitterness, you always want to play forever,” he said. “I love being out on court, I love playing against the guys, I love travelling. I never really felt like it was that hard for me to do, of winning, learn from losing, it was all perfect. I love my career from every angle. That’s the bitter part.\n\n“The sweet part was that I know everybody has to do it at one point. Everybody has to leave the game. It’s been a great, great journey. For that, I’m really grateful.”\n\nWhat is ROGER Federer’s best tournament?\n\nThe Swiss is beloved at Wimbledon, where he won eight career singles titles and amassed 105 lifetime wins against just 14 losses. The Swiss last won the title in 2017 and he last reached the final in 2019 where he fell in a dramatic five-set final to Novak Djokovic after holding two championship points.\n\nHow many Grand Slam titles has Federer won?\n\nFederer is in third position for the most Grand Slam singles titles won in men’s tennis history with 20. He has won eight at Wimbledon, six at the Australian Open, five at the US Open and one at Roland-Garros. Federer owns 368 Grand Slam singles victories in all.\n\nNovak Djokovic tops the men’s list with 24, while Rafael Nadal is second with 22.\n\nWhat did Roger Federer do at Wimbledon in 2021?\n\nAfter reaching the third round at Roland-Garros, Federer lost in the first round at Halle but despite not being at 100 percent, he made it all the way to the quarter-finals at Wimbledon, where he lost to Hubert Hurkacz of Poland in straight sets.\n\nHas Roger Federer turned 40?\n\nYes, the Swiss legend celebrated his 42nd birthday on August 8, 2023.\n\nWhen was Roger Federer born?\n\nFederer was born on August 8, 1981 in Basel, Switzerland. “I am very proud to be Swiss“, he says. He won the Davis Cup for Switzerland in 2014. He plays the Basel Open each year, a tournament where he was a ball kid during the 1990s.\n\nWhat is Federer’s nationality?\n\nFederer is Swiss. He was born and grew up in Swiss-German. He also has a South-African passport through his mother, Lynette Durand, who was born in Kempton Park.\n\nWho is Federer’s wife?\n\nOn April 11, 2009, Federer married Miroslava Vavrinec from Slovakia, better known as Mirka. She is a former pro tennis player (career-high No 76). Mirka met her future husband during the Sydney Olympics in 2000, where they took part for Switzerland. After retiring from pro sports in 2002, at only 24, because of a recurring foot injury, Mirka then became Federer’s career manager.\n\nWho was Roger Federer’s last coach?\n\nSince 2007, Federer was coached by Severin Luthi, the captain of the Switzerland team in Davis Cup, which they won together in 2014. Luthi was joined on Federer’s staff in 2016 by the Croat, Ivan Ljubicic, who followed Stefan Edberg, another former player who helped Federer from 2014 to 2015. “Fed” has also been coached by Tony Roche, José Higueras and Paul Annacone during his professional career, while Sven Groeneveld was instrumental in his junior days, as was his first coach, Annemarie Ruegg and the Australian, Peter Carter, who coached him as a teenager.\n\nWho are Federer’s parents?\n\nRobert Federer and Lynette Durand are his parents, both of them employees in a pharmaceutical company when they met, in 1970. His father is Swiss and his mother is South-African, with French and Dutch ancestry.\n\nWho is Federer’s agent?\n\nTony Godsick became his agent in 2005, when the Swiss signed with IMG. They left in 2013 to create together Team8. This management agency has famous sports clients including Juan Martin Del Potro, Coco Gauff and Alexander Zverev, as well as non-tennis sportsmen (like hockey goalkeeper Henrik Lundqvist). In 2017, the agency launched the Laver Cup, which is held every year between a team representing Europe and one from the Rest of the World, and organises “The Match in Africa”, a charity event.\n\nHow many children does Federer have?\n\nFederer has four children with his wife, Mirka. The couple have two sets of twins; two girls, Charlene Riva and Myla Rose, born on 24th July, 2009, and two boys, Leo and Lenny, born on 6th May, 2014. His four children attended Federer’s 19th Grand Slam title, at Wimbledon in 2017.\n\nWhy is Federer called the GOAT?\n\nFederer is considered by many as the GOAT (“Greatest Of All Time”), as much for all the silverware he accumulated, an objective criteria, as his game style, which is more subjective. The Swiss has won 20 Grand Slam titles (six at the Australian Open, one French Open, eight at Wimbledon and five at the US Open). Federer has won 103 ATP Tour titles and still holds the record for most titles at the season-ending ATP Finals, with six.\n\nWHAT ARE ROGER FEDERER’S HOBBIES?\n\nFederer is a big fan of all sports, but especially football and skiing. He is a supporter of Swiss football team FC Basel and has been a regular visitor to ski races in Switzerland over the years.\n\nFederer has also become more involved in fashion over the years, in part due to his friendship with Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue.
