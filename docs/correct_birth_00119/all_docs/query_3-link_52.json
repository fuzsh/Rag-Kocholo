        "text": "There is something about sports icons expressing themselves on the field of play. Whether it's their anger or overwhelming emotions, the very sight of athletes - who are often deemed supernatural for the unbelievable records in their respective sports - kneeling down, yelling their guts out before capturing the imagination of the crowd, makes them more relatable and arguably, more human.\n\nWhile it strengthens their bond with the fans, their humanly behaviour further helps the common man connect with them, making everyone realise that despite their unbelievable records, these supernatural athletes are just like them. They get angry, they cry and just like us all, they are full of emotions.\n\nOn Sunday, a similar picture came to the fore. A crying Roger Federer was a sight to see. With tears streaked across his face, the Swiss ace was choking, bumbling and quivering while addressing a jam-packed Rod Laver arena following his record 20th Grand Slam win.\n\nMost of those in his box were also blubbing, including his father, Robert, and his coach, Ivan Ljubicic. In the front row of the arena, there was great Rod Laver (now 79) taking a picture of Federer and these extraordinary scenes on his phone. It's safe to say that there wasn't a dry eye in the house.\n\n“I'm so happy. It's unbelievable,” said Federer, holding back tears during the presentation ceremony. “Of course, winning is an absolute dream come true — the fairytale continues for us, for me, after the great year I had last year, it's incredible,” he added.\n\nFederer has won a Grand Slam tournament on 20 separate occasions in the last 15 years, but never has the aftermath been as emotional as the one we witnessed at the Rod Laver arena. The fact that he has now become the first man ever to win 20 Grand Slams surely makes his recent triumph more memorable, but there was something special about this one. This was neither about records, nor glory, rather it seemed more personal.\n\nFor a man who was deemed dead and buried after his knee surgery in 2016, Federer marked a sensational return last year. His dream run - more of a second coming - began with an unlikely victory over his biggest nemesis, Rafael Nadal on the very same court in 2017.\n\nThe Spaniard had a particular hold over his Swiss counterpart and his narrative. But, in five closely-fought sets, with his backhand working like a charm again, Federer rose from the ashes. At 35, he was not supposed to win a Grand Slam - having not won one since his 2012 Wimbledon victory. He had gone for broke, only to come out with one of the most amazing triumphs of his career. And, as the saying goes, the rest is history.\n\nPlaying with a born-again radiance and lightness ever since, Federer met Nadal four times last season, beating him in every duel. But, despite owning 2017 as the year of his comeback, Federer wasn't expected to go any further with critics already doubting his hunger and fitness to successfully defend the Australian Open title this year.\n\nBut, Federer, as we all know, imagines perfection and delivers history. After scoring a comeback for the ages at the last Australian Open, Federer did imagine and eventually delivered history, yet again. Quashing the hopes of Marin Cilic who was eyeing revenge for his 2017 Wimbledon final defeat, Federer tirelessly battled the Croat in a five-set marathon before coming out on top with a 6-2, 6-7, 6-3, 3-6, 6-1 win.\n\n“I was just really happy, to be honest, that it was all done. I was so nervous all day. It was eating me up inside. All day I was thinking, 'How would I feel if I won it? How would I feel if I lost it? I'm so close, yet so far.' I think I was going through the whole match like this. I've had these moments in the past, but maybe never as extreme as tonight. Getting to 20 is obviously very, very special, no doubt,” Federer said.\n\nThe 36-year-old admitted that he had lost some sleep on the eve of his 30th Grand Slam final, but when the moment arrived, he was ready. On the other hand, Cilic, not quite. Having fought his way to the summit clash, Cilic seemed overwhelmed by the occasion as Federer polished off the first set in 24 minutes.\n\nThe Croat did step up in the second set to level the proceedings. But, Federer bounced back to win the third set. The see-saw battle continued in the fourth set before the 29-year-old made it 2-2 (in sets), promising an epic fifth set. However, contrary to popular perception, Federer weathered the storm and didn't allow Cilic to tip him over the edge.\n\nJust like last year's Wimbledon final, it was left to the hawk-eye to declare Federer the winner. Cilic did challenge an unreturned serve out wide, but the replays suggested that Federer's serve had caught a few millimetres of the line - a pinpoint accuracy FedEx is famous for.\n\nWatching the challenge on the screen, as soon as the ball was deemed in, the Rod Laver arena exploded into celebration as their hero burst into tears of joy. Against all odds and defying his age, Federer did it. The insatiable Swiss player notched up another envious record and matched Novak Djokovic and Roy Emerson with six Grand Slam triumphs in Australia.\n\n“When I start thinking about what I was going to say, every subject I touch actually is very meaningful and very emotional. Thanking your team, congratulating Marin, thanking the people, thanking the tournament. At the end it's like one big party.\n\nBut I hoped over time in the speech I would start to relax a little bit, but I couldn't. It was what it was. I wish it wasn't so sometimes. At the same time I'm happy I can show emotions and share it with the people. If I got emotional, it's because it was a full crowd again. No people in the stadium wouldn't make me emotional, I'll tell you that. This is for them really also,\" Federer said after the game.\n\nFor someone who will turn 37 in August - an age when most players are long retired, Federer has now won 25 of his 26 matches at the majors since hobbling off Wimbledon's hallowed centre court 18 months ago. And, after enduring a four-and-a-half-year title drought, Federer has remarkably netted three Grand Slams in 12 months.\n\nWhile his monumental feats undoubtedly make him an all-time great, Federer's genius to wow the crowd and his ability to make them a part of his remarkable journey makes him a great human being - an accomplishment reserved for a select few and worth more than any record."
