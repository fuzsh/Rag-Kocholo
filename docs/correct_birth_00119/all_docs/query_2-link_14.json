That would be in 2003 where up and coming star Andy Roddick defeated Spain’s Juan Carlos Ferrero at the U.S. Open. Shortly thereafter, we were introduced to the era of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. These two champions have simply dominated the sport since 2004, winning 25 of 31 Grand Slams, starting with the 2004 Australian Open. Out of those 31 Grand Slams, only five have featured American finalists. Roddick was a finalist in 2004, 2005 and 2009 at Wimbledon, as well as the 2006 U.S. Open. Andre Agassi was a finalist in the 2005 U.S. Open. All five finals losses came at the hands of Roger Federer.\n\nGoing into this year’s U.S. Open, there are no Americans who would be considered favorites to win the title, but that doesn’t mean we don’t have contenders with a shot. So, which American has the best chance to win our nation’s Grand Slam?\n\nLet’s first begin with tier one or the “top” Americans to look out for:\n\n►Mardy Fish: Ever since losing a significant amount of weight thanks to a healthy diet, Mardy Fish has seemed to resurrect his career. Fish has recently overtaken the number one American ranking from his buddy Andy Roddick, who had been carrying the U.S. on his shoulders for more than six years now. Fish is coming off his best career performance at Wimbledon, reaching the quarterfinals before losing to Rafael Nadal. Sadly though, Fish’s best result in a Grand Slam during his entire career has been a trip to the quarterfinals. Sorry “Fish Heads,” as Mardy likes to refer to his fans, don’t look for anything better then a quarterfinals appearance in this Slam.\n\n►Andy Roddick: For Andy Roddick, it must feel like a century ago since he won the 2003 U.S. Open. Since then, Roddick failed to live up to expectations, losing in each of the four Slam finals he’s reached since 2003. Andy was shocked in the second round by Feliciano Lopez at this year’s Wimbledon, which is why Andy will be my American favorite at this year’s Open. Roddick, who has been embarrassed in his recent Grand Slam performances is seeking redemption and looking to make one last splash in a Grand Slam before he calls it a career. Pending Roddick’s draw, I pick him as the top American hopeful at the U.S. Open.\n\nIn tier number two, I think there’s only one American who fits that category. That American would be John Isner.\n\n►John Isner: The 6”9 John who is coming off his second career ATP title in Newport, R.I. will hope to slay a few opponents and surpass his 2010 performance, when he lost in the third round. When on his game, Isner is a dangerous opponent and top players would prefer not to see him in their draw. However, Isner’s serve simply cannot carry him to a Grand Slam title.\n\nTier number three is a group of Americans who have slipped in the rankings, perhaps ones you’ve forgotten about. Without a fantastic draw, these Americans will have a tough road to glory:\n\n►Sam Querrey: We haven’t seen Sam Querrey since the AEGON Championships, a tune up tournament for Wimbledon. Querrey eventually withdrew from Wimbledon, citing an arm injury. Should Querrey even be healthy enough to compete at this year’s U.S. Open, he is no threat to anyone. Sam has won only one match in three Grand Slams this year, and lacks any major wins. His best win in 2011 was defeating Spain’s Fernando Verdasco. Don’t bank on Querrey making it past the second round should he play in the Open.\n\n►James Blake: Yes folks, James Blake is still playing tennis, and no … he is not retired. James has simply fallen in the rankings hence why you barely see him at the major tournaments. Currently ranked 91st in the world, Blake has struggled with his game in recent years, but is looking to make one more major run like he did when he reached the quarterfinals of the Open in 2005 and 2006. As much as I like Blake, I don’t see positive results for the \"J-Block\" at this year’s Open.\n\nLastly, who will be the American long shots to possibly make a name for themselves. At this year’s U.S. Open:\n\n►Ryan Harrison: Rookie American Ryan Harrison does have game and will look to put his game on display should he make the main draw of the U.S. Open, which he should. In 2010, he made the second round after upsetting former top five player Ivan Ljubicic in the first round. Harrison, though young, can still win a few matches in Flushing Meadows. Let’s hope for a good draw and a nice Cinderella story here.\n\n►Donald Young: Year after year, we wait for Donald Young to do something big. This year, Young upended Andy Murray for the biggest win of his life at Indian Wells. However, what we would like to see is Donald show us some game in the Grand Slams. Unfortunately, we haven’t seen that at all from the young American in his already seven-year career. Based on past experiences, don’t expect anything beyond the second round at best for Young.\n\n►Alex Bogomolov Jr.: Most fans aren’t too familiar with Alex Bogomolov Jr. as he’s never done well in the rankings. His career-high ranking in singles is where he currently strands in the rankings, 63rd in the world. However, Bogomolov Jr. has just come off his best Grand Slam performances at this year’s Wimbledon, making it to the third round before falling to Tomas Berdych. Unfortunately, the American hasn’t made it past the first round of the U.S. Open. This is the year I believe Bogomolov Jr. can make it out of round one and possibly equal his Wimbledon performance, if not better, pending his draw. Realistically, Bogomolov Jr. won’t make it out of week one, but he will be entertaining to watch with the way he’s been playing of late.\n\nContenders and Pretenders for the 2011 U.S. Open: The Men’s Side\n\nGoing into the U.S. Open, there will be players looking to continue to dominate, looking to repeat, and looking to break out. More than likely, a top 20 player will win the title as that’s the trend that has existed over the last 10 years. This year’s U.S. Open will be no different in my eyes. Let’s break down this year’s players to watch into three categories.\n\nThe no-brainers\n\n►Rafael Nadal is the defending champion at Flushing Meadows, and you can bet that he’ll be looking for revenge against Wimbledon champ Novak Djokovic whom he lost to in four sets in the Wimbledon final, which cost him his number one world ranking. Nadal, who defeated Djokovic in the finals of last year’s U.S. Open, has a great shot to repeat this year. Expect nothing less than a semifinals appearance from the now world number two.\n\n►Novak Djokovic, who is the new number one in the rankings, the hottest player on tour, and easily having the best year in his career, is an obvious pick for the later rounds of the Open. Already winning two of the three Grand Slams this year, Djokovic will be looking to capitalize at this year’s U.S. Open where he’s made the finals twice in his career, losing to Federer and Nadal. The number one-ranked Serbian should be seeded first at this year’s Open, therefore he should find himself in at least the semifinals this year again.\n\n►Roger Federer is suffering the biggest Grand Slam drought of his career, failing to win a major since the 2010 Australian Open. Since then, he’s reached only one Slam final, this year’s French Open where he lost to Nadal yet again. For Federer, it looks like the door may be starting to close with the emergence of Djokovic. However, I do not rule the Swiss maestro out, as he has always faired well at the U.S. Open. Each time he has lost on the hard courts of Flushing Meadows, he had his chances to win, but was simply outplayed in the end. Look for the five-time champion to make it to at least the semifinals.\n\n►Andy Murray, believe it or not, has made the semifinals or farther each Grand Slam in 2011. Murray faltered in the finals of the Australian Open to Djokovic, and the semifinals of the French Open and Wimbledon to Nadal. Out of the four no-brainers, Murray is the one I have the least confidence to go deep in the Open. It seems as if he just cannot break through on the big stage. Though he’s been extremely consistent in Grand Slams this year, I don’t see Murray making it past the semifinals should he make it there.\n\nThe contenders\n\n►Andy Roddick, the 2003 U.S. Open champion has always mentioned how much he enjoys playing on the hard courts of the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. Though his recent results in Grand Slams have been considered embarrassing for Roddick, I believe he is ready to redeem himself at this year’s Open. Roddick has won this Slam in the past, and has been to the finals in 2006, he knows what it takes. Though he’s slipped a bit in the rankings, the shot at redemption is what I’m banking on that will take Roddick into week number two.\n\n►Juan Martin del Potro, for those of you who don’t remember, won the U.S. Open in 2009 when he stunned Roger Federer in five sets. Since then, del Potro has struggled with injuries that have sidelined him for nearly a year. After looking to be fully recovered, del Potro is a big threat with his heavy strokes and massive presence. Look for the Argentinean to make it into the second week as well, possibly clashing with a big name like a Nadal or Federer in the quarters.\n\n►Jo-Wilfried Tsonga has been flying under the radar this year, but at this year’s Wimbledon, he did something that caught the eyes of every tennis fan in the world. Tsonga became the first player ever to beat Federer when down two sets to none in a Grand Slam. For this reason, along with his huge serve and forehand, Tsonga is a contender at this year’s Open. The fast hard courts suit his game well; therefore, Tsonga should find himself in week two as well.\n\n►Tomas Berdych is a player who can catch fire with every aspect of his game at any moment. Take, for example, last year’s Wimbledon where he dismissed the defending champion at the time, Roger Federer, with ease. Berdych painted lines every single point with winner after winner. Should Berdych start hitting his spots, he will be extremely dangerous and difficult to beat. Berdych was embarrassed in the first round of last year’s Open, but this year should be different for the big hitting Czech.\n\nThe pretenders\n\n►Robin Soderling, similar to Tomas Berdych, is another big hitter that, if he catches fire, watch out. His example of that type of hitting was evident at the 2009 French Open where he ran defending champion Rafael Nadal ragged. Soderling and Berdych could go either way, but in this case, I feel Sodeling is a pretender because he lacks the all-around game that Berdych has. If this were the French Open, then I would reverse the positions as I believe Soderling moves better on clay, but the U.S. Open is played on a hard court. The tall Swede will struggle.\n\n►David Ferrer will always be one to give you everything he has in the tank when playing a match. Unfortunately for Ferrer, he lacks the knockout punch in his arsenal to do any damage. The only thing he can do which can and has worked in the past, is run his opponents off the court. However, when Ferrer makes it into the later rounds of a Grand Slam, he is usually met by someone who possesses that killer shot, or the knockout blow. That’s why I don’t see the Spanish warrior making it past the quarterfinals of the Open.\n\n►Gael Monfils may be the most entertaining out of all the players listed thus far, no-brainers and contenders included. The young Frenchman is quite the show on-court, with his cat-like speed and heavy strokes. To go along with those weapons, he loves getting the crowd involved after the big points to help fuel his fire. The problem that Monfils runs into is that he lacks the ability to sustain his high-quality level of play for a best of five set match with the top players of the world; therefore, he is no threat to win a Grand Slam at this time.\n\n►Mardy Fish is now the top-ranked American in the world, surpassing Andy Roddick who was the top-ranked American for a number of years. Fish has been playing the best tennis of his life as of late. Reaching the quarterfinals of Wimbledon was his best performance ever at the grass court Slam. Coming into this year’s U.S. Open, I feel he can only carry that momentum so far before succumbing to defeat.\n\nThe Women’s Side: American Hopefuls for the 2011 U.S. Open Crown\n\nBy Monica Gorny\n\nAmerican youngster Christina McHale is moving up the rankings and making steady progress in her young professional career. She comes into the 2011 U.S. Open with a WTA ranking of 65, and hopes to make it further than her U.S. Open-best showing of making it to the second round in 2009. McHale has often been described as one of the most ambitious young players on tour, and chances are that she will look to prove herself on home soil at the 2011 U.S. Open.\n\nCurrently ranked number 88 on the WTA Tour, Vania King is another American hopeful at this year’s U.S. Open. King has had most of her career successes in the doubles field, where she is currently ranked number seven. Her best result in the U.S. Open singles draw is a third round appearance in 2009. Will King pleasantly surprise the American public in this year’s tournament?\n\nCoco Vandeweghe stormed into the U.S. Open limelight in 2008, where she won the girl’s singles title, and is currently ranked 99th on the WTA Tour. In her two showings at the Open, she did not manage to pass the first round. However, the New York native will be hungry to show her potential on her home turf and could cause some upsets along the way. American sweetheart Melanie Oudin had a terrific run at the U.S. Open in 2009 when she reached the quarterfinals. However, Oudin has not had a successful season thus far and has not managed to pass the first round at any of the previous Grand Slams. Will the 2011 U.S. Open serve to reignite her young career?\n\nTop Picks for the 2011 U.S. Open Women’s Title\n\nThe tennis world’s “sunshine girl,” Kim Clijsters, comes into the 2011 U.S. Open as the defending champion. The Belgian is currently in second place in the WTA rankings and has won the U.S. Open championship three times before. Clijsters was forced to withdraw from this year’s Wimbledon due to a foot injury; however, a speedy recovery is underway and indications are that the Belgian will be ready to defend her crown at this year’s Open, making her a real threat in the women’s draw.\n\nAmerican hopes for the 2011 U.S. Open crown will rest on the shoulders of Serena Williams, who is making a comeback to the tennis world after a difficult year of injuries, including a pulmonary embolism. Williams is a three-time U.S. Open champion, with her last victory on home soil coming in 2008. Due to her difficult season, Williams did not compete in last year’s tournament. A powerful serve and fiery groundstrokes, coupled with a home court advantage, makes Serena a notable favorite to hoist the tournament trophy.\n\nThe “old” Maria Sharapova is back and looks more determined than ever to make her presence felt once again on the WTA Tour. After suffering from shoulder injuries for the past two seasons, Sharapova made a startling comeback at this year’s Wimbledon where she reached the finals. The Russian is currently ranked number five in the world, but has been ranked as high as number one in the past. Her performance at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center is highlighted by her U.S. Open victory in 2006. Will Sharapova be able to continue her stellar play and add another Grand Slam title to her record?\n\nCzech young gun Petra Kvitova took the world by storm when she recently defeated a string of top-ranked players to take the Wimbledon crown. The Czech is currently ranked number seven on the WTA Tour, with her best result at the U.S. Open coming in 2009 when she reached the fourth round. With her aggression and ability to stay composed, Kvitova is a hot favorite to win this year’s Open championship.\n\nRounding out the favorites for the 2011 U.S. Open is Venus Williams who has won the tournament twice before. Like her sister Serena, Venus has not played much this season due to injuries. However, the American’s powerful serve and aggressive groundstrokes are perfectly suited for the hard courts, making her an undeniable threat and possible victor of the tournament.\n\nContenders The current world number one, Caroline Wozniacki has yet to win a Grand Slam title. However, her performance at the USTA Billie Jean National Tennis Center has been her strength in Grand Slam showings. The Dane reached the finals of the Open in 2009 and reached the semifinals last year. Is this the much-awaited year for a Wozniacki victory in the finals?\n\nAfter reaching last year’s final on the U.S. Open courts, Vera Zvonareva will look to repeat her successes at this year’s Open, and hopefully, one-up her 2010 performance. The number three-ranked Russian is one of the feistiest players on the WTA Tour and could pose a threat to the usual favorites in the women’s draw.\n\nNa Li’s performance has been at its peak during the clay court seasons of the past two years. The Chinese woman had her career highlight when she won this year’s French Open. At the U.S. Open, Li’s best run came in 2009 when she reached the quarterfinals. The current world number six has the game to takedown anyone on the tour, making her a strong contender at this year’s Open.\n\nGermany’s Sabine Lisicki has proven to be one of the world’s best with her performance throughout the grass court season this year. After winning the AEGON Classic, Lisicki went on to reach the semifinals of Wimbledon with her wildcard status. Her U.S. Open career has not been as impressive, with a second round showing being her best result. However, the German should not be taken lightly, as she has shown that she has the true heart of a champion.\n\nThe pretenders It’s hard to believe that Serbia’s Jelena Jankovic was ever ranked number one in the world with her performance over the past year. She failed to pass the fourth round at any of the Grand Slams of the 2011 season, and has not reached the quarterfinals at the U.S. Open for the last two years. It is doubtful that the current world number 15 will make a strong showing at this year’s Open.\n\nAussie doubles specialist Samantha Stosur has made tremendous progress in her singles career over the past few years. Last year can be considered the peak year of her career where she reached a career-high ranking of number six and was a finalist at the French Open. Stosur’s successes have mainly come on the slower clay, and her 2011 season has not been as promising thus far. Chances are that the Aussie will not fair well at this year’s Open.\n\nNot so long ago, the tennis world marveled at the steady progress that Serbia’s Ana Ivanovic exhibited on the WTA Tour. Within only one year, Ivanovic went from being ranked outside the top 20, to number one on the tour. However, Ivanovic’s 2009 season was nothing short of disastrous, as her ranking plummeted to outside the top 20 once again. Any hopes for an Ivanovic comeback at Wimbledon 2011 were dashed with her elimination in the third round. Clearly, the 2011 Open will not be the Serb’s time to shine.\n\nDespite being ranked in the top 20, Poland’s Agnieszka Radwanska has not had much success on the Grand Slam scene. Her greatest successes over the years have come on the grass courts of Wimbledon where she reached the quarterfinals twice. The U.S. Open has never been her strong point, and thus her prospects for a first U.S. Open title look gloomy.\n\nSo You Think You Know Everything About the U.S. Open?\n\n►The U.S. Open originated in 1881 in Newport, R.I.\n\n►A USTA competition ball must bounce 53 inches when dropped from 100 inches in order to be used in the tournament.\n\n►70,000 balls get used during the course of a U.S. Open tournament\n\n►$22,668,000 in total prize monies were awarded during the 2010 U.S. Open.
