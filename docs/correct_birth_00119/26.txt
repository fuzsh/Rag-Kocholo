One of the stars of 2005, Ivan Ljubicic enjoyed his best season by winning two titles from seven finals, breaking into Top 10 for first time and leading Croatia to its first Davis Cup final - against the Slovak Republic - in December.

Reached the Doha final in his first tournament of the season, before losing to Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis 7-6 (7-1) 6-4 6-7 (2-7) 6-2 in the Australian Open second round.

A semi-finalist in Milan, Ljubicic reached the Marseille, Rotterdam and Dubai finals in his next three tournaments.

In March, Ljubicic won all three points in Croatia's 3-2 first round Davis Cup victory over the United States at Los Angeles defeating Andy Roddick and Andre Agassi in the singles rubbers.

Won a Challenger tournament in Zagreb prior to Roland Garros, where the Croat made a first round exit to eventual finalist Argentine Mariano Puerta 7-5 7-5 6-2. Ljubicic also lost in the Wimbledon first round to Austrian Jurgen Melzer 6-4 6-4 6-4.

Uninspired on the North American hard courts, Ljubicic arrived at the U.S. Open low on confidence. He lost to France's Richard Gasquet 3-6 7-6 (8-6) 6-7 (7-9) 6-3 6-2 in the third round.

Victories over Mikhail Youzhny and Nikolay Davydenko in Croatia's Davis Cup semi-final win over Russia inspired the 26-year-old.

Ljubicic earned back-to-back titles in Metz and Vienna to move him into contention for a Masters Cup spot. He then lost in Madrid and Paris Masters finals for a regular season win-loss tally of 55-21.

Has a 9-0 record [6-0 in singles, 3-0 in doubles] in 2005 Davis Cup play.
