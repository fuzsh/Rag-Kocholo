        "text": "Site Planning Information\n\nIn January 2020, the BLM's Phoenix District published a final Environmental Assessment (EA) and Decision Record approving the Recreational Shooting Sports Project, clearing the way for the construction and operation of five recreational shooting sites on public lands near the Phoenix metro area.\n\nOn March 12, 2021 the BLM published in the Federal Register the final supplementary rules for this project. The rules became effective April 12, 2021.\n\nTo continue providing a quality recreational experience at current and future Phoenix-area recreational shooting sites, the Bureau of Land Management issued a draft business plan fee proposal for these sites, in addition to other BLM-managed recreation sites in Arizona. The BLM wants to hear from you about these draft business plans. The public comment period opened on May 13, 2024, and closed on June 26, 2024. To learn more, visit the Recreation Site Business Plans page on BLM.gov.\n\nRecreational Shooting Sports Project Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is the Recreational Shooting Sports Project?\n\nIn January 2020, the Bureau of Land Management approved the construction and operation of five recreational shooting sports sites within the Phoenix District. Construction of the Baldy Mountain site began in the fall of 2020 followed closely by the Box Canyon, Church Camp Road, and Saddleback Mountain sites. Narramore Road has been planned, but construction has yet to be funded.\n\nWhere are the sites?\n\nThree sites in the Hassayampa Field Office—Baldy Mountain, Church Camp Road, and Saddleback Mountain—are north of Phoenix off State Route 74 (Carefree Highway). Box Canyon is in Pinal County west of Maricopa. The planned Narramore Road site is in Maricopa County west of Arlington.\n\nWhat hours will the sites be open?\n\nOnce operational, the sites will be open for day-use only. Sites will open daily at 7 am. Closing time will vary throughout the year depending on the time of sunset. The sites will also be closed on Wednesdays for maintenance and cleaning.\n\nWill the sites close every year during fire season?\n\nPhoenix District staff will analyze conditions each year to determine if the developed shooting sites can stay open during fire season.\n\nWill I need to reserve a time to visit?\n\nNo, the sites are first-come, first-served. If a site is full, you may have to come back at another time.\n\nWill there be a fee for the sites?\n\nThe sites are intended to initially operate without fees. Should the BLM determine in the future that fees are needed to best manage the sites, we would develop a recreation business plan and engage the public for input before implementing any fees.\n\nAre the sites going to be staffed?\n\nStaff and volunteers may be present on occasion, though the sites are not planned to be staffed during all open hours.\n\nWhat facilities will be at the sites?\n\nSites will have varying levels of development.\n\nBaldy Mountain\n\nThere will be 100-, 200-, 300-, 400-, and 500-yard shooting lanes with fixed steel targets for long-range rifle shooting.\n\nBox Canyon\n\nThere will be 50-, 100-, 200-, and 300-yard shooting lanes with installed steel targets. There is also an area for sporting clay/skeet shooting. The site will also have toilets.\n\nChurch Camp Road\n\nThere will be 50-, 100-, and 200-yard shooting lanes with fixed steel targets for rifle and pistol shooting. The site will also have toilets and picnic tables.\n\nSaddleback Mountain\n\nThere will be 200-, 300-, 400-, 500-, and 700-yard shooting lanes with fixed steel targets for long-range rifle shooting.\n\nWhat rules will apply?\n\nSupplementary rules were published in the Federal Register on March 12, 2021. View the full Federal Register notice here.\n\nWhat safety tips do you recommend?\n\nYou are responsible for your own safety and the safety of others at the site. Shooting sites are self-service sites. Check out these tips for responsible target shooting from Tread Lightly!\n\nWhere can I get more information?\n\nLearn about the BLM’s planning efforts for the Recreational Shooting Sports Project at the National NEPA Register.
