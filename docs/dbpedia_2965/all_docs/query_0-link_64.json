        "text": "An argument between a husband and wife at their Long Grove home turned deadly when a struggle ensued over a gun and it went off, killing the wife Monday afternoon, police said.\n\nThe Lake County Sheriff’s Office responded around 12:20 p.m. Monday to a residence in the 5400 block of North Tall Oaks Drive in Long Grove for a report of a shooting.\n\nLake County Sheriff Spokesman Christopher Covelli said that a 47-year-old woman, identified as Barbara Bell Powers, was shot and killed. Deputies found the woman inside the home and paramedics pronounced her dead at the scene, Covelli said.\n\nCovelli said that Powers was married to a 51-year-old man and they both lived together at the home.\n\n“The two were involved in an argument and during the argument, the woman retrieved a firearm from an upstairs bedroom. The woman fired a shot at the man, which missed the man, but the round lodged into a wall,” Covelli said.\n\nA struggle ensued over the gun and a round discharged, fatally striking the woman, Covelli said.\n\nThe husband has been cooperative throughout the investigation and he was released from custody during the overnight hours, police said.\n\nThe shooting remains under investigation by the Lake County Sheriff’s Office."
