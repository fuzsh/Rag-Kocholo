However Extreme Spread must be used with care since it is frequently and easily abused.[2] As with all measures, the single best measurement is meaningless in isolation. The proper statistical estimator is an \"average\" (a.k.a., expected value) of the measurement.\n\nAnother consideration is that some measures, such as Extreme Spread, change value when there are more shots in a group. Measures that have such a dependency will be referred to here as variant measures. There are invariant measures, like Circular Error Probable or Mean Radius, for which the expected values do not change with the number of shots in a group. Instead having more shots only increases the confidence in the measure's value. Of course the experimental error of either type of measurement can also be decreased by increasing the sample size (i.e., shooting more groups).\n\nFurthermore, by first making assumptions about the inherent shot dispersion, then it is possible to use theoretical models to estimate measurements and their precision. The distributions are of two basic types: If the expected values and the expected precision factor for the measurements depend on distributions which have an explicit solution then the values can be calculated formulaically. If the values don't have a distribution with a closed form expression then they can be estimated via Monte Carlo approaches.\n\nExamples of the application of these methods and tools include:"
