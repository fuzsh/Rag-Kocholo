Acetic acid forms nitrous acid in reacting with nitrites in gunpowder residues.\n\nAction - The working mechanism of a firearm. May be broken down into action types as follow.\n\nAutomatic – A firearm design that feeds cartridges, fires, extracts and ejects cartridge cases as long as the trigger is fully depressed and there are cartridges in the feed system. Also called FULL AUTO and MACHINE GUN.\n\nBolt – A firearm in which the breech closure:\n\n(1) Is in line with the bore at all times.\n\n(2) Manually reciprocates to load, unload, and cock.\n\n(3) Is locked in place by breech bolt lugs and\n\nengaging abutments usually in the receiver. There are two principal types of bolt actions: the turn bolt and the straight pull.\n\nBox lock – A design in which the hammer and hammer springs are located within the frame and the trigger assembly in the lower tang. Generally found on double-barrel shotguns, such as Parker, Fox, Stevens, Winchester Models 21 and 24, etc.\n\nFalling block – A single shot lever action mechanism. The breechblock slides vertically or nearly vertically, when the lever is moved, to expose or lock the breech. Example: Ruger No. 1.\n\nHinged frame – A design wherein the barrel(s) is pivoted on the frame. When the action is open, the barrel may pivot up, down, or sideways for loading or unloading. When the action is closed, the breech of the barrel(s) swings against the standing breech. Opening is normally accomplished by movement of a top-, side-, or under-lever.\n\nLever – A design wherein the breech mechanism is cycled by an external lever generally below the receiver.\n\nMartini– A hammerless single shot rifle action, lever operated, in which the movement of the breechblock is entirely within the receiver and pivots at the rear.\n\nRevolver – A firearm, usually a handgun, with a cylinder having several chambers so arranged as to rotate around an axis and be discharged successively by the same firing mechanism.\n\nRolling block – A single shot action in which a breechblock and hammer each rotate about their separate transverse pins in the receiver. The two members are swung rearward, away from the barrel breech to load the mechanism, or extract a cartridge case. To fire a cartridge, the breechblock is closed and locking is accomplished by the falling hammer engaging an abutment on the breechblock. Example: Remington No. 4.\n\nSemiautomatic – A repeating firearm requiring a separate pull of the trigger for each shot fired, and which uses the energy of discharge to perform a portion of the operating or firing cycle (usually the loading portion).\n\nSidelock – A design in which the firing mechanism is attached to a sideplate rather than being integral with the frame.\n\nSlide – An action which features a movable forearm which is manually actuated in motion parallel to the barrel by the shooter. Forearm motion is transmitted to a breech bolt assembly which performs all the functions of the firing cycle assigned to it by the design. Also known as PUMP ACTION.\n\nTrap door – An action in which a top hinged breechblock pivots up and forward to open. Locking on this action is accomplished by a cam located at the rear of the breechblock that fits into a mating recess. Also known as a CAM LOCK.\n\nAction, turnbolt - A bolt action firearm on which it is necessary to rotate the bolt handle upwards for unlocking before it can be pulled to the rear. Similarly, it is necessary to rotate the bolt handle downward after closing to lock the firearm and enable the gun to be fired.\n\nAction marks - Abrasion or scratches placed on a cartridge case or bullet through the mechanical function of loading or unloading a cartrige or pistol.\n\nAdapters - See Subcaliber device\n\nAFTE Theory of Identification as it Relates to Toolmarks - 1. The theory of identification as it pertains to the comparison of toolmarks enables opinions of common origin to be made when the unique surface contours of two toolmarks are in \"sufficient agreement.\"\n\n2. This \"sufficient agreement\" is related to the significant duplication of random toolmarks as evidenced by the correspondence of a pattern or combination of patterns of surface contours. Significance is determined by the comparative examination of two or more sets of surface contour patterns comprised of individual peaks, ridges, and furrows. Specifically, the relative height or depth, width, curvature, and spatial relationship of the individual peaks, ridges, and furrows within one set of surface contours are defined and compared to the corresponding features in the second set of surface contours. Agreement is significant when it exceeds the best agreement demonstrated between toolmarks known to have been produced by the same tool. The statement that \"sufficient agreement\" exists between two toolmarks means that the likelihood another tool could have made the mark is so remote as to be considered a practical impossibility.\n\n3. Currently the interpretation of individualization/identification is subjective in nature, founded on scientific principles and based on the examiner's training and experience.\n\nAge hardening - Hardening with time by precipitation.\n\nAggregate ball - A variant of ball propellant seldom encountered today, formerly used as a shotshell propellant.

Imagine an office hole punch made to handle steel metal. In ammunition manufacture, the usable part of a blanking operation is the material removed from the hole, usually a disk.\n\nBlowback - 1. In firearms, an automatic or semiautomatic firearm design that directly utilizes the breech pressure exerted on the head of the cartridge case to actuate the mechanism.\n\n2. In ammunition, a leakage of gas rearward between the case and the chamber wall from the mouth of the case. See also Blowback, delayed\n\nBlowback, delayed - A system in which the breechblock is not locked but some mechanical delay is incorporated to ensure that the breechblock cannot move back with sufficient rapidity to allow the unsupported case to emerge from the chamber while the pressure is still high.

Some models share a common main objective.\n\nStriae - See Striations.\n\nStraightened - An operator aims the barrel at an optical pattern on a nearby wall. The pattern design is such that its reflection on the interior surface of the barrel reveals the straightness of the bore, relative to the long axis. If the reflection indicates that the bored hole is not concentric to the axis, the operator places the barrel in a large hand press and applies pressure to points on the barrel that will improve straightness.\n\nStrain gauge - A simple digital scale is designed to measure force (weight) in only one direction (such as the type normally used by firearm/toolmark examiners). Four strain gauges are fastened to a metal bar or beam inside the scale at points subject to the most deformation by any weight applied to the beam. Force (weight) is normally transmitted mechanically to the beam by placing an object on an external tray mounted on top of a post projecting through the body of the scale to the surface of the beam. The resulting deformation of the beam, however slight, causes a strain to the metal beam and is detected by the strain gauges.More weight produces more strain. Increased strain is detected by the strain gauges, causing a proportional change in the electrical resistance of the gauges. Because the current (amperage) used in the strain gauge is constant, changes in the resistance of the gauges determine the output voltage of the circuitry, which changes in proportion to the weight of the specimen. This output voltage in analog form is converted into a digital signal prior to being fed to the microprocessor, and emerges as information that illuminates the correct portions of the LCD numerical weight readout.\n\nStriated toolmarks - See Toolmark, striated.\n\nStriations (striae) - Contour variations, generally microscopic, on the surface of an object caused by a combination of force and motion where the motion is approximately parallel to the plane being marked.
