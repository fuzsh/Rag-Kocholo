Their main function is to kill or otherwise incapacitate. They come in numerous varieties for use in handguns, rifles, and machine guns. There is also special ammunition capable of penetrating armor, firing underwater, or firing \"silently\" at subsonic speeds. However, their designs are all basically the same. A typical cartridge consists of four components: the cartridge case, primer, propellant charge and bullet. When a gun trigger is pulled, the primer is struck, igniting the propellant. This causes a rapid expansion of gas, which forces the bullet forward and ejects the casing. Contrary to popular belief, guns are not loaded with bullets, but cartridges, and they fire bullets (since bullets are a more common term and the actual objects responsible for harm, they receive the recognition).\n\nWhile small in size (the most popular handgun bullet is 9 mm in diameter) bullets posses enough kinetic energy to cause serious damage. Using a kinematics formula, it is possible to determine the acceleration of a bullet when the muzzle velocity and barrel length of a gun are known.\n\nv2 = vo2 + 2as\n\nWhere\n\nv is the muzzle velocity\n\nvo is the initial velocity of the bullet, which is zero\n\na is the acceleration\n\ns is the barrel length\n\nSince acceleration is the desired value, the derived formula is this:\n\nWhen fired from a Beretta 92S, the standard issue US Army pistol, a 9 mm Parabellum bullet has a muzzle velocity of 335 m/s. With its 127 mm barrel length, the bullet's acceleration is calculated to be 4.4 × 105 m/s2.\n\nThe acceleration of a bullet depends largely on the gun from which it is fired, along with the intent of the user. Pistol bullets generally feature a lower acceleration than rifles or machine guns. Also, individuals involved with clandestine operations may use firearms with silencers, which suppress bullet speed and require special subsonic ammunition.\n\nRemember, guns don't kill people. Bullets do. To paraphrase Chris Rock in Bigger, Blacker and Uncut, if bullet prices were raised to $5,000 each, there would be a drastic decrease in murders [mp3].\n\nMichael Tse -- 2003"
