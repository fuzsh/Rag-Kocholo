        "text": "CHICAGO (WLS) -- A suburban father of four was shot to death inside a Family Dollar on the West Side on Friday afternoon, Chicago police said.\n\nPolice said the shooting happened in the Austin neighborhood's 5400 block of West Chicago Avenue just before 1:40 p.m.\n\nA 43-year-old man was inside the store when someone approached him before taking out a gun and opening fire, police said.\n\nPolice said the victim, shot in his body multiple times, was transported to Stroger Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\n\nThe Cook County Medical Examiner later identified the man as Loyce Wright. Relatives of the victim told ABC7 he was a security guard.\n\nThough he worked security Wright was never a tough guy, especially with his daughters.\n\n\"I'm telling the honest to God truth, that dude was awesome. He was such a good dad,\" said his daughter Sharice Wright.\n\n\"Everybody loved my dad. He was just such a great, a great guy. And he didn't have any haters,\" said daughter Shanice Wright.\n\nRelatives said Wright wore a vest, but it wasn't bulletproof.\n\n\"He trusted people. He loved people, and people loved him, and for some reason, he just thought he could change people with a hug,\" said sister Robin Wright.\n\nWright, who lived in Hanover Park, in addition to being a girl dad was a fitness buff who always had time for anyone. He'd worked security for about a year at the store, his family said, they worried about his safety.\n\n\"He never I think focused on the danger of it all, like we all did. You know, we were scared for him,\" Robin said.\n\n\"I'm going to miss my dad. I'm really going to miss my dad, and we need to do better as a community,\" said Sharice.\n\nThere is no one in custody and area detectives are investigating.\n\nOfficials did not immediately provide further information.\n\nA spokesperson for Family Dollar issued a statement about the fatal shooting:\n\n\"We are deeply saddened by the tragic incident that occurred at one of our Family Dollar stores in Chicago today. We are cooperating with local authorities as they investigate the crime. Out of respect for the family's privacy, no further comment will be offered at this time.\""
