        "text": "PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- A high school student who was killed early Saturday morning in Philadelphia was a person of interest in the murder of a 12-year-old boy, Action News has learned.\n\nThe teen, identified by police as 16-year-old Tysheer Shahe Hankinson from Upper Darby, was shot multiple times around 1:05 a.m. Saturday on the 5400 block of Poplar Street.\n\nHe was taken to an area hospital where he later died.\n\nAction News previously spoke with Hankinson with his face obscured earlier this year when he survived a shooting in West Philadelphia.\n\nAt that time, he was shot in the face on a SEPTA platform.\n\nOn Sunday, officials with the Upper Darby School District released the following statement on Hankinson's death:\n\n\"Today, I was informed by local law enforcement that an Upper Darby High School student, Tysheer Hankinson, was shot and killed in West Philadelphia early Saturday morning. I know some information has been reported by local news outlets as to the background of what may or may not have occurred. At this time, I can only report that there is an ongoing police investigation into what actually took place. Please join me in keeping all involved in your thoughts and prayers. We will have district resources available in our schools on Tuesday (September 5th) for our staff and students who may need to speak with someone from our pupil services team.\"\n\nSources told Action News that Hankinson was a person of interest in the killing of Hezekiah Bernard, whose body was found in a trash can on August 23.\n\nBernard was found by a sanitation worker on the 5500 block of Cherry Street.\n\nA vigil was held for the young boy on Friday night.\n\nSEE ALSO: 'That's a perfect kid you destroyed': Vigil held for 12-year-old boy found dead in trash can\n\n\"He was a baby. My only baby. My last baby,\" said Dolores Davis, who is Hezekiah Bernard's mother.\n\nAuthorities believe he was dead for one or two days by the time he was found.\n\nSources told Action News Bernard was not in the Department of Human Services care at the time. However, Bernard's mother said he was, and she has no idea what happened.\n\nLoved ones will gather again on Tuesday morning for Bernard's service at Francis Funeral Home.\n\nAnyone with information on the murder is asked to call police at 215-686-TIPS."
