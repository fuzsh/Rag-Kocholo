        "text": "TSC offers many opportunities for pistol shooters to learn and improve skills with precision shooting. Bullseye shooting is an excellent way for beginners to learn and practice safe shooting.\n\nBullseye pistol shooting follows a structured match with three stages/targets. The stages are slow, timed, and rapid. The Slow target is 10 shots over 10 minutes. The Timed stage is 5 shots over 20 seconds, fired twice. The Rapid state is 5 shots over 10 seconds, fired twice. Each target is worth 100 points and the match is worth 300 points.\n\nShooters use .22 Pistols with .22 standard velocity ammunition. Red dot style target scopes may be used or some shooters prefer to use open sights. Some matches include optional centerfire pistols for a greater challenge.\n\n900 matches: A 900 match consists of 9 stages (3 slow, 3 timed, and 3 rapid) and the targets add up to 900 points."
