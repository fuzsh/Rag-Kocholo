        "text": "Windsor police are hoping to identify five suspects following a report of possible gunshots from a vehicle in east Windsor.\n\nOn Monday at 10:30 p.m., officers responded to a report of possible shots fired at a business in the 5400 block of Tecumseh Road East, near Rivard Avenue.\n\nThrough investigation, officers learned that a vehicle with masked occupants parked outside the business around 9:30 p.m. and yelled obscenities at an individual before departing.\n\nThe vehicle returned approximately 45 minutes later, and two occupants tried to spray the victim with a noxious substance before once again leaving.\n\nPolice say the vehicle then returned a third time, at which point the driver drew an item that looked like a handgun and fired three shots toward the victim before fleeing the scene.\n\nNo injuries were reported as a result of this incident.\n\nAt this time, police say it is unclear whether the weapon was an actual firearm or a replica.\n\nThe suspect vehicle is described as a green Kia Soul with a licence plate ending in 831."
