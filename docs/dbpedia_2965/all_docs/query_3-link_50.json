        "text": "The main differences between rifles, shotguns, and handguns are their barrels, their intended targets, and the type of ammunition used.\n\nRifle\n\nThe rifle has a long barrel with rifling and thick walls to withstand high pressures. Rifling puts a spiral spin on a bullet fired from a rifle, increasing accuracy and distance.\n\nRifles are typically used for firing at stationary targets.\n\nThe bore of a rifle barrel is made for only one specific caliber of ammunition.\n\nShotgun\n\nThe shotgun has a long barrel and usually has a smooth bore to reduce friction. The barrelâ€™s walls are thinner due to reduced pressures. If a shotgun is designed to fire slugs, it might have a rifled barrel.\n\nShotguns are typically used for shooting at moving targets in the air.\n\nThe bore of a shotgun barrel is made for only one specific gauge of ammunition.\n\nHandgun\n\nThe handgun has a short barrel with rifling and thick walls to withstand high pressures. Because of the short barrel, extra care must be taken to control the muzzle of a handgun. Like the rifle, rifling in the handgun puts a spiral spin on a bullet when fired, increasing accuracy and distance.\n\nHandguns are typically used for firing at stationary targets.\n\nThe bore of a handgun barrel is usually made for only one specific caliber of ammunition.\n\nUnit 3 of 11\n\nTopic 7 of 11\n\nPage 1 of 8"
