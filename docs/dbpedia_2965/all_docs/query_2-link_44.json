Competitors must finish the stage within this set time frame, and scoring is based on the accuracy and number of targets hit within that fixed period. Penalties are awarded for extra shots, extra time, and extra hits. (It’s similar to Virginia Count but with a time limit.) For more details on course types, Click Here.\n\nGrain: Used to measure the weight of bullets and the size of a powder charge in a cartridge.\n\nHang Fire: When a round has a delayed discharge.\n\nHard-Cover Targets: Targets that do not incur penalties or points when you shoot them.\n\nHit Factor: A scoring method calculating the score per second based on the points earned from hits on targets divided by the time it takes to complete the stage. For additional information on Hit Factors, Click Here.\n\nIDPA: The International Defense Pistol Association. They focus on sport-based defensive pistol techniques and simulated self-defense scenarios.
