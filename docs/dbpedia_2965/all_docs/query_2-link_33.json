The trigger must be pressed for each successive shot. See Semi-Automatic.\n\nAUTOMATIC: Firearms that use the force of the explosion of the first shot to continuously unlock, extract, eject, reload, lock, and fire.

A common term for recoil is “kick.”\n\nRECOIL ENERGY: The force, measured in foot pounds or kilograms meters in the metric system, exerted rearward by a firearm when fired.\n\nRECOIL PAD: A cushion attached to the butt of a shotgun or rifle to help absorb recoil.\n\nRELOADING: Re-manufacturing fired ammunition.\n\nRELOADING DIES: Tools used in reloading ammunition, such as the resizing, decapping, seating, and crimping dies.\n\nRELOADING PRESS: A machine or device used in the reloading of ammunition.\n\nREST: A support for a gun while firing.\n\nRETICLE or RETICULE: A system of lines in the eyepiece of an optical instrument like a telescopic sight or scope. In a scope the reticle defines the line of sight for aiming. May also be referred to as crosshairs.\n\nREVOLVER: A handgun with a rotating cylinder that carries several rounds of ammunition, each round being in a chamber that comes into line with the barrel before the round is fired. There are two types of revolvers, which are defined by how the cylinder is rotated and the firearm is cocked:\n\n(a) DOUBLE ACTION revolvers may be hammer cocked by drawing the hammer manually to the rear (called single action tiring), or they may be trigger cocked by pressing the trigger to the rear thus rotating the cylinder, cocking. and releasing the hammer (called double action firing).\n\n(b) SINGLE ACTION revolvers may only be fired by hammer cocking, which rotates the cylinder, and by then pressing the trigger.\n\nRIB: A piece of metal attached to the uppermost part of the slide or barrel. Used to raise the sighting plane, improve appearance, reduce barrel vibration, cool the sighting plane (ventilated rib), or provide a raised surface on which to mount a sight.\n\nRICOCHET: The tendency of a bullet to skip, bounce, or fly off at an angle after striking an object or surface.\n\nRIFLED SLUG: A spiral grooved, single ball projectile used in shotgun ammunition.\n\nRIFLING: The spiral longitudinal grooves cut in the bore of a barrel. Identified as being in two parts, the GROOVES and LANDS (the raised appearing sections between the grooves). Rifling is used to impart spin to a projectile, thus stabilizing it in flight.\n\nRIM: The outer or extreme circumference on the head of a cartridge. Used for extracting or headspacing a cartridge.\n\nRIMFIRE: A cartridge design in which the priming mixture is placed in a fold in the head of the cartridge case, as in .22 Long Rifle ammunition.\n\nRIMLESS: A cartridge case design in which the case bears no rim about the head.\n\nS\n\nSAFETY: A mechanical device on a firearm that locks all or part of the firing mechanism in order to keep it from firing.\n\nSCOPE: Short for telescope or telescopic sight.\n\nSEAR: The part of the action of a firearm that engages the hammer or striker to hold it in a cocked position.\n\nSECTIONAL DENSITY: The weight of a bullet in grams, divided by its diameter.\n\nSEMIAUTOMATIC: A firearm that uses part of the force of the exploding cartridge to extract the empty case and chamber the next round, but requires a separate press on the trigger to fire each round.\n\nSHELL: A cartridge case.\n\nSHOT: The round projectiles used in the manufacture of shotgun ammunition.\n\nSHOTSHELL: Multiple projectile cartridge commonly used with shotguns. Shotshells may also be used in handguns and rifles.\n\nSIDE BY SIDE: A firearm with two barrels placed horizontal to each other. Usually a shotgun or double rifle.\n\nSIGHT: A device through which the target is viewed to give proper elevation and direction.\n\nSIGHT ALIGNMENT: When the front and rear sights are brought into correct adjustment with the shooter’s eye.\n\nSIGHT PICTURE: Seeing the sights in proper alignment with the target.\n\nSIGHT RADIUS: The distance from the front to the rear sight.\n\nSILENCER (SUPPRESSOR): A device fixed to the muzzle that baffles the propelling gases from each shot, thus lowering the volume. A suppressor rarely, if ever, renders the firearm soundless.\n\nSLACK: The amount of movement in a trigger mechanism before it engages the sear.\n\nSLING: A leather, web, or nylon strap used to help support a rifle during firing.\n\nSMOKELESS POWDER: A nitrocellulose base gunpowder sometimes compounded with nitroglycerin.\n\nSMOOTHBORE: A firearm with no rifling in the barrel, such as a shotgun or musket.\n\nSOLVENT: A liquid capable of dissolving powder residue and used in the cleaning of firearms.\n\nSPEED RELOAD: The action taken to replace the ammunition supply of an empty or partially loaded weapon as quickly as possible in order to maintain the ability to fire.\n\nSPITZER: A type of pointed bullet designed to give better stability during flight.\n\nSPOTTING SCOPE: A telescope used by shooters or hunters to check hits or locate game.\n\nSTIPPLING: The roughing of metal to improve gripping surfaces.\n\nSTOCK: The pieces of wood, fiberglass, plastic, or rubber attached to a firearm to allow it to be grasped and aimed.\n\nSWC (SEMI-WADCUTTER): A bullet with a flat ended nose section and a full caliber cutting shelf.\n\nT\n\nTACTICAL RELOAD: Reloading a firearm with a partially depleted ammunition supply in order to return it to full capacity while retaining the ammunition remaining.\n\nTAP-RACK-BANG: Immediate action taken when a stoppage has occurred in magazine fed weapons. The steps are TAP the magazine to insure it is seated, RACK the action to feed or replace a cartridge in the chamber, and, assuming it is appropriate, BANG means to fire the weapon.\n\nTARGET: The object at which the shooter is aiming.\n\nTARGET READING: Examining the group of shots on a target so as to analyze the shooting stance, sight alignment, sight picture, and trigger control.\n\nTRAJECTORY: The curve on the vertical plane traced by a bullet after firing.\n\nTRIGGER: The part of the gun that releases another mechanism and causes firing to occur when pressed.\n\nTRIGGER GUARD: The part of a firearm that helps prevent trigger damage or accidental firing.\n\nTRIGGER PRESS or TRIGGER CONTROL: Moving the trigger until the sear disengages, the hammer or striker goes forward, and the weapon fires, without disturbing the sight alignment or sight picture.\n\nTRIGGER PULL: (a) The amount of weight necessary to activate the trigger. (b) The length of travel during a trigger press.\n\nTRIGGER RESET: The action of holding the trigger to the rear after the sear breaks and during the cycling of the weapon, then releasing the trigger only to sear re-engagement.\n\nTRIGGER TAKE-UP: (Or slack) is any motion of the trigger backwards or towards you which does not engage the mainspring or cause the sear to move.\n\nTWIST: The distance in inches a bullet travels through the barrel to make one complete revolution. Expressed as a ratio such as 1:16, meaning one revolution in 16 inches.\n\nU\n\nUNLOAD: A range command given to remove all ammunition from the firearm, followed by visually inspecting to verify that the magazine and chamber are empty, followed by physically verifying the status of the gun by feeling into the action and chamber.\n\nW\n\nWAD: A material used in shot shells or in the loading of muzzleloading firearms to retain the powder or shot charge and to control gases.\n\nWC (WADCUTTER): A flat pointed bullet designed to cut a clean hole through a target.\n\nWEAVER STANCE: Developed by Jack Weaver, it is a two handed method used to aim and shoot a handgun. The Weaver Stance incorporates isometric tension to stabilize the firearm.\n\nWINDAGE: (a) Moving the windage adjustment of the sights of a firearm to compensate for wide shots caused by either wind or misalignment. (b) The lateral drift of a bullet in flight caused by wind.\n\nZ\n\nZERO: (a) To adjust the sight settings of a gun by calibrating the results of firing. (b) Aligning the sights so that the bullet will strike the target at the point of aim."
