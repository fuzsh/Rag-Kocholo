        "text": "A jury in New Mexico found the armorer of “Rust” guilty of involuntary manslaughter on Wednesday. She had loaded the gun that Alec Baldwin was rehearsing with on a film set in 2021 when it fired a live round and killed the movie’s cinematographer.\n\nThe trial of the armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, was the first time a trial jury weighed in on the Oct. 21, 2021, shooting on the set of the film “Rust,” which claimed the life of its cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins. A grand jury indicted Mr. Baldwin in January on a charge of involuntary manslaughter in the shooting; he has pleaded not guilty and is scheduled to be tried separately in July.\n\nNeither Ms. Gutierrez-Reed nor Mr. Baldwin testified at the trial, which began Feb. 22 at the First Judicial District Courthouse in Santa Fe, N.M., and lasted two weeks. The jury reached its verdict after two and a half hours of deliberations.\n\nMs. Gutierrez-Reed, 26, faces up to 18 months in prison.\n\nProsecutors said Ms. Gutierrez-Reed failed to properly check that the rounds she loaded into the .45-caliber revolver were all dummy rounds, which are inert cartridges used to resemble live rounds on camera but which cannot be fired.\n\n“The astonishing lack of diligence with regard to gun safety is without question a significant cause of the death of Halyna Hutchins,” the lead prosecutor in the case, Kari T. Morrissey, said during closing arguments on Wednesday.\n\nMs. Gutierrez-Reed’s lawyers argued that she had been made the “scapegoat” of a tragic accident. They blamed someone else for the appearance of live rounds on set and charged that the production cut corners on safety in an effort to reduce costs, including by overburdening Ms. Gutierrez-Reed with two jobs that prevented her from being able to focus fully on her weapons and ammunition duties.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
