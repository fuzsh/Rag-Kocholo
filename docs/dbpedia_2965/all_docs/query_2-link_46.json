        "text": "Pin point precision\n\nThere are two types of laser training devices on the market: LaserHIT HD and others. While other devices fire a laser beam for about 1/10 of a second when you pull the trigger, the laser strike can become unreliable if you move the gun. This can lead to developing the bad habit of holding the gun steady after the trigger is pulled, which negatively impacts your shooting performance during live fire.\n\nLaserHIT HD is different. Its laser cartridge fires an extremely short laser beam, nearly 100 times quicker than other devices, with a duration of nearly 1/1000 of a second. This results in a perfect laser dot on the target every time you pull the trigger, as well as longer battery life. With LaserHIT HD, you can move your gun as quickly as you like and receive reliable results every time.\n\nDon't be fooled by low-end laser cartridges. Make sure to ask the seller about the duration of the laser strike. Train with a reliable LaserHIT HD cartridge for the best results. Visit the page for more details.\n\nExtended long range (up to 1 mile)\n\nYou read it right, up to 1 mile. Not 5 yards, not 10 yards, but 1,760 yards. The target may not be visible with the naked eye. However, you can hunt it with your scoped rifle. Thanks to the LaserHIT app, LaserHIT HD cartridge, and scaled targets. You may ask: \"I will practice with a handgun.

This powerful software tool is like sniper-grade gear in your toolbox. Learn it once, and use it with all your firearms. Visit the page to get yours now.\n\nBasic FREE TARGET Practice\n\nThe Basic Firing Range setup is designed to start your training quickly. It is suitable for all kinds of firearms or laser training devices. Basic Setup will let you focus on shooting fundamentals while getting familiar with the system. You can practice with full-size or scaled targets in simulated distances up to 160 yards (approx. 150 meters) in your home environment. This Setup does not involve ballistic calculations. However, it supports an excellent exercise of target acquisition, breathing, and trigger control. Use single or multiple targets provided by LASERHIT or your targets in any size and shape. Visit the page for more details.\n\nAdvanced FREE TARGET Practice\n\nThe Advanced Firing Range setup is designed for experienced users. It is suitable for all kinds of firearms, from handguns to semi-auto or sniper rifles. Advanced setup lets you focus on shooting fundamentals with advanced instrumental measurements. You can practice with full-size or scaled targets in simulated firing range from point blank to extended long range of one mile in your home environment.
