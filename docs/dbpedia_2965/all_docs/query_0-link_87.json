        "text": "Short range micro control.\n\nAs a clarification. I have very limited experience with the game. It is on the \"over the shoulder/lemme try it\" basis. So I can be and I hope that I am missing something.\n\nBut.\n\nThe yearly years (1890th) combat is very... strange. And not in a good way.\n\nAI is endlessly turning away. Starting to lose the firefight at intermediate or long range? Turn away. Got into torpedo solution at the close range? Turn away. Player ship in the vicinity? Turn away. And I'm not talking about damaged rudder situation. This is just basic AI survival routine. In doubt? Turn.\n\nThat wouldn't be this mindblowingly boring if the guns worked. But they don't. From that I can tell my ships are trying to lay their guns continously but can't do it fast enough so nothing is shooting for the most part. And since its yearly years, accuracy is awful and letting AI ships make some distance is not very practical.\n\nHistorically, heavy and medium guns of this era were aimed predictively and not continously so the gunners would simply wait till target will move into place and fire then. While light guns were made to provide rapid fire against fast moving small targets or precise targeting against targets on board of larger ships all while under local control. So they shouldn't have any problems with engaging large ships while they are making turns.\n\nNothing of this works in the game.\n\nFirst problem are narrow firing arcs.\n\nAt least for the light guns. There are only limited number of gun positions capable of firing towards bow/aft. No fighting tops, no superstructure mounts, no extra bow/aft casemates.\n\nSecond problem is \"ship turning\" debuff for the light guns.\n\nAs Percy Scott proved in practice even crews of the 6 inch guns can be trained to compensate for the roll. What kind of problem prevents 2-3 inchers what were typically installed on the swindel to compensate for their ships turning on such a massive scale?\n\nRange: 300 yards\n\nBasic hit chance: 28,17\n\nCrew quality: -10\n\nFire control: 0\n\nTech level: -20\n\n***Ship turning: -50***\n\nUnder fire: -20\n\nSea state: -10\n\nLight guns short range bonus: + 10\n\nFinal hit chance: 8,84\n\nRange: 300 yards\n\nBasic ROF: 3,80\n\nAdjusted ROF: 2,99\n\nTech level ROF mod: -30\n\nCrew quality: -10\n\n***Firing ship turning: -60***\n\nUnder fire: -10\n\nFinal ROF: 0,94\n\nIt is worst than being under fire and rolling. Combined. Those are the guns to fire at the fast boats and engage large ships at the ramming ranges. How they possibly can be THIS bad at rotating while being on board of the large ship? Its absurdity.\n\nThird.\n\nEndless deliberate fire for the secondaries/tertiary even if they are light guns. It is 300 yards. This is exactly the time you go all out. At this range and against large ship no aiming adjusment is needed. At this point officer commands RAPID and everybody is trying to do their best.\n\nConstructive propositions.\n\n1. Widen some wing mounts arcs for the light guns or create several new mount points with wider arcs if its simplier. Or make a \"topworks mount\" checkbox or something like that to remove arc restriction at the cost of extra top weight.\n\n2. Remove \"own ship turning\" ROF and hit chance debuff for the light guns or make it around -10. Same goes for the \"target turning\" debuff. It shouldn't be a thing in the \"light guns short range bonus\" range. At longer ranges - yes, keep it.\n\n3. In captains mode there should be a \"rapid fire\" command. In admirals mode there should be \"fire rate at range\" setting in the doctrine menu. Or single \"rapid fire at given range\" option. It may be restricted to light guns only."
