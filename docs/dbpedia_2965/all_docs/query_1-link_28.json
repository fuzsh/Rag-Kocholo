It started with my own routines and their changes throughout time. It also has examples by other pistol shooters and coaches.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nRamon Suarez\n\nThese are a few of my own shooting routines (also known as shooting sequences and shot processes). I tweak them every once in a while, as my focus moves to new areas after others have been integrated and my understanding and feelings change.\n\n24/03/2020\n\nI’ve recently started the Build Your Brilliant Shooting Routine online course by UK Olympic mental coach Paul Hughes and discovered that my previous sequence is what he calls This Is How I Hit. Following his advice and my evolution I have changed my sequence to:\n\nFocus\n\nEngage\n\nHold\n\nI’m still playing around with this and thinking of expanding the last two points, which would give:\n\nFocus\n\nEngage smoothly\n\nHold steadily\n\n23/05/2020\n\nFor a few days now I’ve moved to a more abstract sequence that I find very helpful:\n\nEnergy\n\nBreathe tall\n\nBalance\n\nFocus\n\nTrust\n\nThose are the important things to focus on now that the little steps are integrated.\n\n19/11/2019\n\nThis is my current single breath shooting sequence:\n\nI decide that it is time to shoot, this changes my concentration and makes me have a different focus.\n\nTurn head towards target\n\nStretch arm into ready position and check arm feelings and sights without moving head, just lowering gaze, correct if needed (needed a lot).\n\nBalance check (am I moving too much? things look steady?).\n\nInhale and raise gun over target. I’m looking at the target with a lazy focus and feeling my arm.\n\nPause.\n\nMake sure sights are ok.\n\nCheck shoulder is not too up.\n\nHold breath and lower gun under control (not too fast, not too slow) looking at front sight, trying to keep wrist lock.\n\nAt end of bullseye reduce speed, take trigger stop and exhale slowly.\n\nFocus on front sight while going down from bullseye and try to reduce movement.\n\nConscious of initial trigger tension in hand and keep on augmenting it when arriving at zone (sometimes it feels too loose and I abort). If I feel it taking too long, I lower my arm and restart (most of the time).\n\nFollow through, recall feelings and where I think the shot went. I cannot recall the whole shot (almost nothing stays in memory).\n\nLower gun.\n\nCheck impact.\n\nWhen taking position:\n\nStart from right of the target, perpendicular, looking at target.\n\nLooking at target walk towards front until I see that I’m well aligned.\n\nCheck feet and place them right.\n\nTake gun barrel with left hand and place grip against web of right hand.\n\nLower back of hand\n\nStretch fingers\n\nMove fingers into position.\n\nRest held gun in table\n\nLook at target and do a few raises to validate position. I’m trying to be aware of where gun wants to go naturally so that it ends centered without me driving it to any side.\n\nPivot or move until position is good.\n\n10/1/2019\n\nMy new coach has told me to read my ISSF pistol shooting sequence for 15 shots in every training, so I have updated the one I had written following the advice of my previous coach. There are no big changes in the sequence itself, but changes in how I see it now.\n\nStart looking in front of me.\n\nInhale and towards the end turn head and look at top of target.\n\nWhile exhaling, raise gun to ready (directly, without adapting). Check that grip is good.\n\nCheck balance.\n\nWhile inhaling, raise gun to a bit over the black of the target.\n\nWhile exhaling, check that sights are good but looking at target.\n\nCheck balance.\n\nSmaller inhale.\n\nLower arm slowly while exhaling.\n\nStop at aiming zone. At the same time stop exhaling, change focus to top of front sight, reach trigger stop.\n\nWhen stability starts to be acquired launch shot release.\n\nAfter shot is released follow up for a few seconds.\n\nLower gun\n\nI keep it in a Google Keep note so that I can read it in my phone, but I’ve found that reading it in a piece of paper is more helpful.\n\nWhat’s yours like?\n\nJim Newsome\n\nThis is the example shoot process that pistol coach Jim Newsome sends for shooters to complete their first assessment:\n\nTake grip and settle into position.\n\nDeep stomach breath to clear mind and lower centre of gravity. Brief\n\nvisualisation of prefect sight picture and prefect trigger release.\n\nEmpty pause.\n\nRaise head to look at target, unfocused.\n\nBegin raise, inward chest breath through nose. Raise to height above\n\ntarget.\n\nExhale through mouth, lowering begins, taking up first stage as the pistol\n\ndescends\n\nContinuing exhale, pick up sights above target, follow down to aiming\n\narea loosely focused on sight picture or back of hand.\n\nSettle into area of aim, shoulders down.\n\nBegin to ‘laser focus’ in on foresight. Increase trigger pressure to point of\n\nshot release\n\n10.Continue to focus on foresight, reset to correct picture and call shot.\n\n11.Finish exhale, return gun to table.\n\nStatis’tir\n\nHere’s the routine by Statis’tir shared via Twitter:\n\nRelated\n\nPublished by ramonsuarez\n\nPistol shooter practicing mostly the Olympic & ISSF events, learning and sharing along the way. #10mairpistol #25mpistol #50mpistol #rfp #rapidfirepistol #issfpistol #olympicpistol View more posts"
