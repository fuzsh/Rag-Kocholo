        "text": "Long backcountry hunts require plenty of gear to get you through the hunt. This requires a larger pack as well. In a past article, I reviewed the Akek Alpha 3200 pack, and although it is a great pack, some hunts require a bigger pack to get the job done.\n\nAkek Climax 5400\n\nIn this review, I will go over the new Akek Climax 5400 pack which is the most recent pack that Akek has introduced. The name says it all, being a much larger pack boasting 5400 cubic inch capacity versus the 3200 cubic inch capacity of the Alpha 3200. Let’s look at the particulars of the new Climax, which still boasts many of the same great features. More pictures and information on this pack can also be viewed here on the Akek website.\n\nAkek Climax 5400 Features\n\nThree packing modes: compact, regular, and climax. In compact mode, the removable lid becomes a day pack for short day hikes or stalking. In regular mode, you don’t use the lid and fold the big bag for a smaller pack. In Climax mode, an internal foldout extends the pack’s height and carrying capacity.\n\nHigh-performance materials: 500D Cordura Nylon, YKK waterproof zippers, strong but lightweight carbon fiber frame.\n\nTop and Front Loading: Openings on top and front for intuitive accessibility, loading, and unloading.\n\nFour separate locations for water bladders (one in each side pocket, one in the lid, and a waterproof pocket between the pack and frame)\n\nFour accessory pockets included: Internal or external connecting points with locking strap buckles.\n\nInnovative lumbar pad: Add or remove padding for your liking.\n\nAdjustable padded hip belt system allows waist sizes from 28” to 47”. Along with the padded, adjustable shoulder straps and the lumbar pad.\n\nHip belt system with removable pockets to be used with MOLLE accessories.\n\nFour main locking strap buckles for quick adjustments.\n\nWaterproof bottom: The bottom 6” of the pack is waterproof, and a rain cover is included.\n\nQuick-release weapon system.\n\nMany quick detach buckles allow many options to mount accessories or move straps to optimal locations.\n\n5400 cubic inches of storage space and a load shelf between the pack and frame.\n\n150-pound load-carrying capability (if you are froggy enough to want to do it)\n\nFirst Look\n\nJust like with Akek’s earlier versions of packs, I was impressed with the way the pack is put together. The craftsmanship and attention to detail remain on point with this Climax 5400 pack. See it here. I really like the option of being able to use the pack in three different configurations as well. This would make it very versatile and allow me to take one pack on my various hunts and adjust its size for the type of hunt that I am on. The removable lid that doubles as a day pack is also a great option (shown below). The day pack is very minimalist and will not handle heavy weight, but it will work great for certain situations.\n\nVersatile Pack\n\nFor a pack of this robust capability and weighing in at just over 6 pounds, you get a lot of pack for the weight. The Climax 5400 has lots of options to use a hydration bladder with various locations to help you get it where you want it with easy access. You choose where it makes sense for your mobility and use of ease. The pack has built-in easy-access inner and outer pockets, which will streamline organization and storage. The main compartment can be accessed through the top or the sides, making it easy to get to your items. Every inch of the pack is usable to some degree, and the layout of the pack is great! The plethora of straps will not leave you trying to figure out how to secure your load and whatever you decide to strap to it.\n\nPack Modes\n\nWhen breaking down the pack, it was extremely easy to transform it into any of its three modes. Removing the day pack and folding/cinching down the top converts it to what they call the regular mode, but in all practicality, you essentially are just getting rid of the day pack and folding the top inside.\n\nOnce you remove the large bag and are down to the frame, you essentially have a pack with a load shelf and the option to add the day pack to the frame for added carrying capability. This is the compact mode.\n\nAdd it all together, and it is the Climax mode, which will give you way more options to get it loaded down with too much gear if you are not careful! So many options and room in the Climax mode.\n\nThere are many options to make the pack fit whatever hunt you may be on. With being able to carry 150 pounds, the minimalist feature of just the frame and the load shelf will come in handy if successful. You can also attach the bag back onto the frame on the outside of the load shelf for added room. The straps make it easy to attach this way.\n\nFrame\n\nThe carbon fiber frame is still used on this pack, and it has added adjustability with more locations to adjust the shoulder straps. Having a shorter torso, I had no problem adjusting the pack to fit me optimally and with comfort. The closed-cell shoulder and hip pads remain fully adjustable and easy to use while making adjustments.\n\nDedicated Spotter Pockets\n\nThe pack also has dual side pockets to allow for a large spotting scope or a small tripod—plenty of room to hold my 85mm Vortex spotter with ease. I also used these large compartments for other items when not taking the spotter.\n\nUse in the Field\n\nI first used this pack on an archery elk hunt and loaded it down with plenty of items to get me through a 5-day hunt. With a pack weight of nearly 80 pounds, I was sure I wasn’t missing anything and felt it would be a good test for the pack. The large compartment held most of my items well, and I didn’t have any issues running out of room. The problem I had was having too much room! I just kept packing unnecessary items into the pack because I had the room! I also realized that I could move the bag away from the frame and use the load shelf for more room if needed. Good thing I didn’t, as I didn’t want to add additional weight to the already heavy pack!\n\nComfort\n\nThe shoulder straps did a good job, and I ended the trip without any bruising or soreness. The hip pads again were great and comfortable as well. I was happy this pack was mostly quiet and only had minor noises while traveling. I really like that the bottom 6” of the pack is waterproof. This allowed me to set my pack down in wet areas and not have to worry about the contents of my pack getting wet. The added rain cover and having YKK water-resistant zippers increased the effectiveness of keeping my gear dry. This eased my mind, knowing that I could lean the pack against a tree while it was raining, and it would keep my contents dry.\n\nRifle and Bow Carrier\n\nThis pack also has the quick-release pull for rifle or bow like with the Alpha 3200. I did not use it this year but have in past models. It is a great option and remains a bonus of the pack. The adjustable butt holster allowed me to move it to the center to carry my bow in the center of the pack. I prefer to carry the bow this way to keep the weight centered and most protected. The straps were in great locations to secure my bow so as not to put added stress on the sights and rest.\n\nRemovable Day Pack\n\nOnce at camp and while going out on closer hunts, I used the removable day pack to carry essentials. It held a couple of bottles of water, snacks, and my knife along with a few other safety items. With shoulder straps that are not padded, you wouldn’t want to load it down a great deal, but it sufficed for short trips from camp and was a joy to use. After hiking in a great distance with lots of weight, it was a pleasure using this small day pack! A thing to consider is after getting an animal on the ground, if you have this small pack with you, you will have to take a trip back to get the bigger pack! That is what I had to do! You just never know when the moment of truth will happen!\n\nI loaded the pack down on this last trip with plenty of elk meat and the skull/antlers. It was no problem putting more weight in it than I wanted in the pack. I opted to use the internal compartment to haul the meat. The meat was cooled down, and I had no issues packing it out this way. When loaded with meat and the skull of a large bull, it did very well with no major complaints from me.\n\nImprovements Needed?\n\nI did notice when loaded down, I had a problem getting the pack to not bounce against the carbon frame. The load lifters were adjusted properly, and the pack was cinched tight to the frame, but I could not figure out where the movement was coming from. It could be how my internal items were packed, but I was sure everything was tight and secure. Perhaps the load lifters were not pulling enough weight up to remove the movement. More testing is to be done on my part to confirm. This would not have been an issue if I had used the load shelf rather than having all the weight inside the pack.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed using this pack on various hunts this year. To date it is my favorite pack that I have used for long backcountry hunts. The versatility is great, and it allows a wide variety of options to fit several different styles of hunts. I like having a pack that can be adjusted and broken down for various modes and situations.\n\nConclusion\n\nAt a price of $547, this pack is a tough one to beat! I would put it right up there as a contender with the much higher-priced packs on the market at a fraction of the cost. I don’t feel that I would have any major complaints. Order here."
