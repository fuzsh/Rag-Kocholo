        "text": "Handgun-Shooting Techniques\n\nThe pistol-shooting fundamentals of breath control, trigger squeeze, and follow through are almost identical to those in rifle firing. There are, however, some important differences to remember.\n\nThe first joint of the finger should take up trigger pressure, not the tip, as is often done with rifles.\n\nWhen a revolver is fired, powder flashing at the front of the cylinder can cause burns. Be sure to keep your fingers away from the front of the trigger area.\n\nThe slide and hammer of a semi-automatic gun can deliver a bruising blow when held too close to the body. All handguns should be fired at armâ€™s length.\n\nUnit 9 of 11\n\nTopic 4 of 5\n\nPage 4 of 4"
