        "text": "First of all, happy 248th birthday to the Marine Corps, and thank you to all you veterans! I know I’ve said this a thousand times in conversation, but the best years of my career were working with various military units, domestically and overseas. I had nothing but excellent experiences working with the military and I appreciate the opportunity I was given to do so.\n\nAfter my experience preparing for Prairiefire last year, I decided to test a few other guns and see what happened. First-shot fliers have been recognized for a long time now, but with the decrease in accuracy-based sports, fewer shooters see them. Many shooters cannot demonstrate the accuracy levels needed to reliably determine what their gun does, especially in professional circles. Given that many qualification courses start up close and move back, usually with loaded guns, even the better shooters will not normally see this issue. In Action Pistol, with its fairly demanding accuracy requirements, the gun stays loaded as the shooting gets further away, removing this issue in that competition as well.\n\nThe issue is not actually the first round fired, but rather the first hand-cycled round into the chamber. The best guess, as I’m not aware of any formal testing being done, is that the cartridge seats differently, and the gun locks up differently when loaded with hand pressure, rather than at the cyclic rate of the slide.\n\nMy HK P30Ls, worked on by LTT, do not exhibit this problem to a noticeable extent at 25 yards. At 50 yards, it becomes obvious, with a single round a few inches low and right of the main group, every time. In this picture, I shot two more handcycled rounds just to illustrate better.\n\nPrecision rifle shooters have long understood that the first round from a cold bore will likely go somewhere else. A cold clean bore will perform differently than a cold dirty bore. In many cases though, the first shot can be attributed to a cold shooter more than the gun. Dryfire before shooting can help with this issue. I think the above photo shows that it is the gun in this case.\n\nAll of my Glocks exhibit this issue, some worse than others. Some to a really unacceptable level – like 6-8″s off at 25 yards for the first shot. For units that use Glocks for more sensitive missions like hostage rescue, it really makes me wonder how much testing and evaluation went into that decision. Granted, a pistol shot on a classic “hostage taker” target doesn’t come along often, even less often beyond close range, but nonetheless, I would not want to depend on a gun that can’t put its first round where I want it. It’s probably not an issue at the distances they envision using a pistol. For me on a range though, it matters quite a bit. It also matters quite a bit when I’m hunting, whether for deer with a .45 pistol, or an opportunistic shot on a coyote coming in on our chickens. One of my LTT P30Ls is often used around the ranch because of its great accuracy.\n\nIf you have tested this out, I would love to hear about your experiences. Custom 1911s tend not to have an issue. My old classic Sigs did not have much issue at 25 and in. What are you shooting and do you know what it is doing?"
