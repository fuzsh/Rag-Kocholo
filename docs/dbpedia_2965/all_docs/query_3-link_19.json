        "text": "You may have heard of Newton's first law:\n\n\"Every body persists in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed on it.\"\n\nWe tend to rephrase this a little and say that a body in motion tends to stay in motion and a body at rest tends to stay at rest unless acted on by an external force.\n\nApplying Newton's First Law to Physical Objects\n\nImagine you are on a perfectly smooth speeding train, moving at a uniform speed (not accelerating or turning), in a car with no windows. You have no way of knowing how fast you are going (or if you are moving at all).\n\nIf you throw a ball straight up in the air, it will come straight back down whether the train is sitting still or going 1,000 mph (1,609 kph). Since you and the ball are already moving at the same speed as the train, the only forces acting on the ball are your hand and gravity. So the ball behaves exactly as it would if you were standing on the ground and not moving.\n\nWhat does this mean for our gun?\n\nIf the bullet leaves the gun at 1,000 mph, then the bullet will always move away from the gun at 1,000 mph (1,609 kph). If you go to the front of a train that is moving at 1,000 mph (1,609 kph) and shoot the gun forward, the bullet moves away from you and the train at 1,000 mph (1,609 kph), just as it would if the train was not in motion.\n\nBut relative to the ground, the bullet will travel at 2,000 mph (3,219 kph), the speed of the bullet plus the speed of the train. So if the bullet hits something on the ground, it will hit it going 2,000 mph.\n\nIf you shoot the bullet off the back of the train, the bullet will still be moving away from you and the gun at 1,000 mph, but now the speed of the train will subtract from the speed of the bullet. Relative to the ground, the bullet will not be moving at all, and it will drop straight to the ground.\n\nThe Physics of Sound Waves\n\nWhat's true for the average bullet, however, is not true of some other things that you might \"shoot\" from the front of the train. A great example is sound waves.\n\nIf you turn on the stereo in your living room, sound waves \"shoot out\" of the speaker at the speed of sound — something like 700 mph (1,127 kph). The waves propagate through the air at that fixed speed, and they can go no faster."
