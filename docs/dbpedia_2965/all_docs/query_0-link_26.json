        "text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. (KCTV/Gray News) - Federal prosecutors announced three men have been charged in connection with an illegal firearms trafficking investigation linked to the shooting that left one dead and dozens injured after the Kansas City Chiefs’ Super Bowl rally.\n\nFedo Antonia Manning, 22, Ronnel Dewayne Williams, Jr., 21, and Chaelyn Hendrick Groves, 19, all face felony charges in federal court. Federal prosecutors stated that three men were not among the shooters at Union Station, but rather were involved in the illegal purchasing and trafficking of some of the weapons used in the mass shooting.\n\nAccording to a criminal complaint, two of the firearms recovered in the shooting had been illegally trafficked. One person, Kansas City-area DJ Lisa Lopez-Galvan, was killed in the shooting, which took place on Feb. 14, shortly after the Chiefs ended their celebration rally. Twenty-two others were injured.\n\nAn ATF special agent stated in the court document that he believed 12 people showed firearms during the shooting, and at least six of them fired their weapons.\n\nOne of the recovered weapons, an Anderson Manufacturing, Model AM-15, .223 caliber pistol, was found along a wall with a backpack next to two other AR-15 style firearms with backpacks, the ATF agent testified.\n\nThe pistol had one live round in the chamber, 26 live rounds in the magazine, and was in the “fire” position. The magazine is capable of holding 30 live .223 caliber rounds of ammunition, the court document stated. The pistol could potentially have fired three or four rounds before it was discarded.\n\nIt was one of 33 similar firearms purchased by Manning, and was bought at a gun store in Missouri 556 days before the shooting, the court document stated.\n\nThe complaint alleged that Manning is not licensed to sell firearms, and in 15 cases, he transferred the guns to other people shortly after purchasing them himself.\n\nA second firearm recovered at the scene of the shooting was a Stag Arms, Model Stag-15, 300 caliber pistol. It had been purchased by Williams from a gun shop at the KCI Expo Center in November 2023. Williams was accused of buying the gun for Groves, who had accompanied him to the gun show but was not old enough to buy the weapon himself.\n\nThe two men were accused of lying to federal investigators about how the weapon was bought.\n\nManning is charged with conspiracy to traffic firearms, engaging in firearm sales without a license and making a false statement on an ATF form. Williams and Groves are both charged with conspiracy to make false statements in the acquisition of firearms, aiding and abetting and making false statements in the acquisition of a firearm and making a false statement to a federal agent.\n\nTwo adults, 23-year-old Lyndell Mays and 18-year-old Dominic Miller, have been charged with second-degree murder as well as two counts of unlawful use of a weapon and armed criminal action, according to Jackson County prosecutor Jean Peters Baker.\n\nTwo teenagers are also facing gun-related charges as well as resisting arrest in connection to the shooting."
