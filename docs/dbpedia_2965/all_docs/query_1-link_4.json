They could not make the shot under stress because they haven’t trained to use their pistol at anything beyond a comfortable handgun distance. Most officers believe that shooting a pistol beyond 25 yards is futile. What makes a difference in this situation is the officer being completely familiar with their weapons, well trained, and confident in their skills. Few agencies conduct training past 25 yards. But that does not mean that a pistol is ineffective beyond 75 feet. Every little mistake a shooter makes is magnified by the distance the bullet has to travel. An officer has to control his or her sight picture, sight alignment, and trigger press when the target is 150 feet or more away. A braced position is an amplifier of marksmanship. When firing from a solid brace, many experienced shooters can achieve accuracy levels almost up to their weapon’s potential. Cover is the overriding consideration during an extreme range shooting. Once an officer has cover, he or she needs to respond to the threat. The form of the cover will dictate the firing position. The best bet for accuracy is to be able to stand behind the cover and steady aim with a solid, flat surface. Making a long-range pistol shot under combat conditions requires proper aim and proper mechanics. An officer must concentrate on sights and squeeze the trigger. An officer must maintain a solid firing grip and be sure to follow through. At longer range the rate of fire cannot be maintained. To gain proficiency with a handgun at long range, an officer is going to have to practice. Unfortunately, many agencies have only 25-yard ranges. Using a reduced sized silhouette can help approximate the challenge of shooting at longer distances. To make a long-range shot, an officer must understand that a handgun bullet will drop at extreme range."
