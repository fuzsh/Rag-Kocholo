        "text": "Alright airgun geeks, I need your help with something. What is the equation to figure out how efficient an airgun is?\n\nI've been using this equation but I believe it only gives me how much energy is produced per CC.\n\nReservoir: 300cc\n\nTotal air used: 250b starting pressure – 150b ending pressure = 100b\n\nTotal air used x total reservoir: 100b x 300cc = 30,000\n\nProjectile: 25.4g @ 960fps for 47 shots\n\nAve energy per shot: 52fpe (70.5 joules)\n\nTotal energy: 70.5j x 47 shots = 3313j\n\nTotal air used x total reservoir / Total energy = Energy per CC\n\n30,000 / 3313 = 9 joules per CC\n\nTake for example another airgun with a larger reservoir, a smaller usable air range, lower shot count, and lower FPE. This results in more energy per CC.\n\nReservoir: 480cc\n\nTotal air used: 250b starting pressure – 180b ending pressure = 70b\n\nTotal air used x total reservoir: 70b x 480cc = 33,600\n\nProjectile: 25.4g @ 940fps for 40 shots\n\nAve energy per shot: 48fpe (65 joules)\n\nTotal energy: 65j x 40 shots = 2600j\n\nTotal air used x total reservoir / Total energy = Energy per CC\n\n33600 / 2600 = 12.9j per CC\n\nBut in my mind the 2nd airgun is less efficient because I'm getting less energy, less shots, less FPE, out of a larger air reservoir.\n\nThere must be a different equation to figure out \"efficiency\".\n\nWhat is backwards is your units - you are dividing the air usage by the total energy, so the answers are in cc-bars / joule . . . . so the second gun IS less efficient as it is using more air per unit of energy . . .\n\nYou could flip the equation around and then you would have an answer in energy per unit of air, and that might \"feel\" better as a lower number would be less efficient . . . .\n\nCan you copy, paste, and change the above to show that?\n\nIn your example can you define what 12.76 \"efficiency\" means? I understand it's (Pressure used * reservoir size / total FPE). What does 12.76 mean in layman's terms?\n\nIt's a measure of how much air is consumed to produce one foot*pound of energy. In that particular format of \"bar*cc/fpe\", a smaller number is better. Meaning the gun is using less air.\n\nI'm more in the habit of using fpe/ci instead. In this format, we're talking about how many foot*pounds of energy is being produced per unit of air consumed. So a bigger number is better which is a little more intuitive.\n\nWhenever doing math, we have to remember to \"follow the units.\" Efficiency can often be identified by most division equations with the word \"per\" in the description - such as Miles \"per\" Gallon: we measure the miles and the fuel used, and the result is an efficiency answer of MPG.\n\nWhen I said \"air per unit of energy\", the \"air\" means air usage (or consumption in this case) - that is the Bar-cc, or bars of air \"consumed\", and the unit of energy is either FPE or joule, depending on what you are using. Total consumption divided by total energy.\n\nOne thing that often trips people up is the difference between what we could call \"pure efficiency\" metrics, like MPG, as compared to \"pure consumption\" metrics, like Gallons per 100 Miles (or liters/100 km in Europe), for any \"efficiency metric\" on power or energy utilization. If we work in what I will call \"consumption space\" then we can directly compare performance: a vehicle that uses half the gallons to travel 100 miles than another vehicle is clearly twice as efficient; but in MPG space that relationship is reversed - so for a vehicle to be twice as efficient, it has to double the MPG, leading to diminishing and non-linear returns. For example a 10 MPG improvement on a vehicle that gets 20MPG will save twice the fuel that the same improvement is to a 40MPG vehicle, even though it is 10MPG on both, but a savings of 1 gallon per 100 miles is the same savings on both.\n\nI hope that helped, but \"efficiency\" can be complicated so you have to think through what is being divided by what . . . and what the answer means.\n\nIt's a measure of how much air is consumed to produce one foot*pound of energy. In that particular format of \"bar*cc/fpe\", a smaller number is better. Meaning the gun is using less air.\n\nI'm more in the habit of using fpe/ci instead. In this format, we're talking about how many foot*pounds of energy is being produced per unit of air consumed. So a bigger number is better which is a little more intuitive.\n\nNot up on the whole calculation above...but...\n\nThe correct term (in red above) would be Pound-Feet (or foot).\n\nFor...whatever it may be worth.\n\nMike\n\nAre these accurate descriptions:\n\nfpe/ci translates to FPE produced per 1 cc of air\n\nbar*cc/fpe translates to CC's of air consumed to produce 1 FPE\n\nAnd, can y'all share some of your results so I can gauge efficient and inefficient?\n\nbar*cc/fpe: how many cubic centimeters (cc) of air at standard atmospheric pressure (bar) it takes to produce 1 FPE\n\nfpe/ci: how many FPE is produced per cubic inch (ci) of air at standard atmospheric pressure\n\nI regard something like 1.3fpe/ci as being my basic expectation for most any PCP with a rifle-length barrel (say, 18 - 22\")...meaning without having to do much to mitigate hammer bounce. Frequently 1.5 - 1.7fpe/ci with some effort. And for the most part, a gun hovering around 1.0fpe/ci will not be tolerated.\n\nI agree with nervoustrig's guidance, but would add that one also needs to consider the \"class\" of power a gun is working in as that affects basic efficiency - for example, if you are tuning for very high power levels in a given caliber, that will likely \"hit\" efficiency some. For example, if If you take a .22 caliber gun that has the flexibility to tune in a range of say 20-50 FPE, a good tune at 25 FPE will almost certainly be more efficient than a good tune at 45 FPE. Kind of like comparing sports cars to small sedans - the small sedans are almost always going to be more fuel efficient than the sports cars, but that by itself does not make them better (just more efficient).\n\nRemember, efficiency is basically a ratio, and you can measure efficiency any way that works best for you. In my case, I measure all my guns and tunes with the standard efficiency values, but what I care about more is what I calculate as \"Pellets shot per minute of Shoebox runtime,\" since I use a Shoebox compressor to fill my tanks. My higher power guns/tunes run about 5 pellets per minute, and my \"most efficient\" gun is my 10 M pistol at 89 pellets per minute. Interestingly, the FPE/CI of the two extremes are not massively different, with the 45 FPE .22 caliber B-Rod at 1.1 and the 3.5 FPE .117 pistol at 1.3. I have other mid power .22s that are up in the 1.6 range . . ."
