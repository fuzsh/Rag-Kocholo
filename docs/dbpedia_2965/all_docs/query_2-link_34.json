        "text": "Collect the required information for the ammunition under consideration. You will need to know the bullet ​weight​, measured in grains, which is listed on the ammunition box. You must also know the ​velocity​ the bullet is moving at impact. Each ammunition manufacturer publishes ballistic tables for their ammunition. These tables will normally list the bullet velocity at the muzzle of the gun and at intervals of 100 yards out to the useful range of the ammunition (usually 300 yards or so). For distances between the listed increments, you must estimate.\n\nAmmunition manufacturers typically measure rifle bullet velocities using a 24-inch test barrel. As a rule of thumb, for every additional inch of barrel length beyond 24 inches, the velocity increases by 20 feet per second. Likewise, for every inch of barrel length below 24 inches, the velocity decreases by 20 feet per second. For example, if your rifle barrel is 20 inches long, then subtract 80 feet per second from the manufacturer's stated velocity. There is no such rule of thumb for pistol ammunition.\n\nYou also will need to know the bullet ​diameter​. Precise diameters can be found in tables published by ammunition manufacturers. Otherwise you can use the bullet caliber as an approximation. A 30-06 bullet has a diameter of 0.308 inches, but you could use 0.300 inches in your calculations without significantly compromising accuracy.\n\nCalculate the energy the bullet will deliver to the target on impact using the formula\n\nKE = \\frac{w_bv^2}{450,437}\n\nIn words, the bullet energy KE (in foot-pounds) is equal to the bullet weight (in grains) wb times the square of the bullet velocity v (in feet per minute) divided by 450,437.\n\nCalculate the ​Hornady Index of Terminal Standards (HITS)​ number using the formula\n\nHITS = \\frac{{w_b}^2v}{700,000\\times D^2}\n\nIn words, the HITS number is equal to the square of the bullet weight (in grains) times the velocity (in feet per second) divided by the square of the bullet diameter (in inches) divided by 700,000.\n\nNote that the HITS calculation method is meant to be an indicator of how severely a specific bullet might wound a live target, and today it is the most widely used calculation for this purpose. Other calculations used include the Optimal Game Weight (OGW) formula, the Taylor Knockout (TKO) formula, the Knockout Value (KOV) formula and the Lethality Index (LI) formula.\n\nHornady Manufacturing publishes tables of the HITS numbers for various types of ammunition, using a standardized range of 100 yards for rifle bullets and 50 yards for pistol bullets."
