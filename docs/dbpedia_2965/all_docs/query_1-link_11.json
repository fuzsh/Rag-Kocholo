        "text": "There are three standard sizes of shells, based upon their length: 2 3/4\", 3\", and 3 1/2\". The length determines the amount of powder, and the amount of ounces of shot can vary within the shell, based upon the size and number of shot pellets. A \"magnum\" load has slightly more powder and more pellets, so that the muzzle velocities are not greatly increased, but the total kinetic energy is greater because of the greater mass of pellets. A greater number of pellets increases the likelihood of hitting a target at longer ranges, because of the dispersal pattern of the pellets that increases with range. The amount of kinetic energy possessed by any individual pellet can vary, based upon multiple variables and interactions among the shot mass.\n\nThe size of pellets varies from large \"000\" to small \"9\". Larger pellets have more kinetic energy, but fewer pellets disperse rapidly and accuracy in hitting the target is an issue. Greater numbers of smaller pellets have a better chance of hitting the target, but each pellet has a small amount of kinetic energy. For example, a skeet shooter trying to hit the clay pigeon wants many smaller pellets capable of hitting the target at a shorter range, while a deer hunter wants larger pellets capable of inflicting greater damage at longer range.\n\nShot may be primarily composed of lead or steel, along with combinations of other metals. The main reason for use of steel shot is environmental, to reduce lead contamination, but steel has inferior ballistic qualities from an energy standpoint (less mass), but can be partially overcome by increasing powder loads and velocities.\n\nThe spread of the pellets as they leave the muzzle is determined by the \"choke\" or constriction of the barrel at the muzzle (from none to 0.04 inches). More choke means less spread. Full choke gives a 15 inch spread at 20 yards, while no choke gives a 30 inch spread at the same distance. (DeMuth et al, 1976) A \"sawed-off\" shotgun has a very short barrel (less than 18 inches) so that, not only can it be concealed more easily, but also it can spray the pellets out over a wide area, because there is no choke.\n\nRepresentative Shotgun Choke DesignationChoke (in thousandths of an inch)% Increase over Cylinder None0\"None Skeet0.005\"13% Modified0.020\"27% Full0.040\"35%\n\nKey: Increased choke, or constriction, correlates with a tighter pattern of pellet dispersion, and % increase over cylinder; cylinder = barrel caliber with no choke\n\nStandard birdshot sizes range from:\n\nShot Number (Size)Diameter (in inches)90.08 8.50.085 80.09 7.50.095 70.10 60.11 50.12 40.13 30.14 20.15 10.16 B0.17 BB0.18 BBB0.19 T0.20\n\nStandard buckshot sizes range from:\n\nShot Number (Size)Diameter (in inches)40.24 30.25 10.30 00.32 000.33 0000.36\n\nShotgun slugs can produce significant injury, because of the slug's size and mass. At close range, survival is rare. In treating shotgun injuries, it is necessary to remember that the plastic shell carrier and the wadding (which may not appear on radiographs) can also cause tissue damage and may need to be found and removed. (Gestring ML et al, 1996)\n\nShotgun shells can be loaded with a variety of objects as projectiles, ranging from rubber pellets to needle shaped metal \"flechettes\" to rock salt to pepper balls. These have a novelty aspect, but their usefulness is questionable. Some, such as the \"bean bag\" with a fabric bag containing shot, is purportedly \"less lethal\" have been utilized in law enforcement.\n\nWounding is a function of the type of shot, or pellets, used in the shotgun shell. Weight, in general, is a constant for a shell so that 1 ounce of shot would equal either 9 pellets of 'double O' buckshot or 410 pellets of #8 birdshot. A 00 or \"double ought\" pellet is essentially equivalent to a low velocity .38 handgun projectile.\n\nAt close range, the pellets essentially act as one mass, and a typical shell would give the mass of pellets a muzzle velocity of 1300 fps and KE of 2100 ft/lb. At close range (less than 4 feet) an entrance wound would be about 1 inch diameter, and the wound cavity would contain wadding. At intermediate range (4 to 12 feet) the entrance wound is up to 2 inches diameter, but the borders may show individual pellet markings. Wadding may be found near the surface of the wound. Beyond 12 feet, choke, barrel length, and pellet size determine the wounding.\n\nIf the energy is divided between the pellets, it can be seen that fewer, larger pellets will carry more KE, but the spread may carry them away from the target. Pellets, being spherical, are poor projectiles, and most small pellets will not penetrate skin after 80 yards. Thus, close range wounds are severe, but at even relatively short distances, wounding may be minimal. Range is the most important factor, and can be estimated in over half of cases, as can the shot size used. (Wilson, 1978) A rifled slug fired from a shotgun may have a range up to 800 yards. (Mattoo et al, 1974)\n\nThe Polyshok Impact Reactive Projectile (IRP) is a form of shotgun ammunition with a lead bead core encased within a single, plastic projectile. The lead core is designed to disintegrate on impact so that lead fragments are distributed over a small area. This reduces the likelihood of exit or collateral damage on missed shots. This projectile produces a single entrance wound, and both plastic and lead components can be found within the wound, regardless of the range of fire. The single entrance wound with limited area of tissue damage suggests a shotgun slug, while the small lead fragments within the wound suggest small size shot pellets, but together these findings are characteristic for the IRP (Nelson and Winston, 2007).\n\nRepresentative Shotgun Shells Shot TypePellet Size (dia. in inches)# of PelletsWeight (ounces)Velocity (muzzle) in fpsVelocity (50 yds) in fpsEnergy (muzzle) in ft-lbs per pelletEnergy (50 yds) in ft-lbs per pellet 7.50.095350112006103.971.02 80.090410112005903.370.82 90.080585112005552.380.51\n\nAir gun ballistics\n\nThese weapons, also known as \"BB\" (ball-bearing) guns, fire .177 or .22 round pellets at muzzle velocities of 200 to 900 fps. Though considered of low energy and relatively \"safe\" for children to use, they can cause severe injury, such as to the eye, and even to abdominal organs. The projectile can penetrate to a depth of 25 mm at a range of 1 meter and up to 15 mm at a range of 5 meters. (Grocock, et al) Air guns are usually never included in gun regulation. Homicide and suicide have been reported with air guns. (Cohle et al, 1987; DiMaio, 1975)"
