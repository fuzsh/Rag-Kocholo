        "text": "Training the Trainers\n\nA lesser-known part of the AMU’s mission might be the most important — they train thousands of soldiers in basic and advanced marksmanship, as well as U.S. Military Academy instructors and Army Cadet Command ROTC instructors.\n\n“Last year, we trained about 22,000 cadets from both programs,” said AMU Command Sgt. Maj. Jason Levy.\n\nThe unit’s soldiers really enjoy sharing their expertise.\n\n“Sharing the knowledge is the most rewarding thing out of all of it,” said Army Sgt. 1st Class Brandon Green, who won the Civilian Marksmanship Program National Championship in 2018 and got a perfect score in the President’s 100 rifle match. “You can win all the trophies that you can go out there and compete for, but knowing that you’re sharing knowledge that could save someone’s life really, really makes it rewarding.”\n\n“I will never turn down anybody that requests a clinic or needs help learning how to shoot,” said Army Sgt. 1st Class Adam Sokolowski, the first person to ever win three consecutive Bianchi Cup Opens — the National Rifle Association’s National Action Pistol Championship.\n\nGlobal Experts\n\nAnother important AMU mission: Acting as subject matter experts in weapons development.\n\n“There’s not a week that goes by where we don’t have an external agency asking for our opinion or to test ammunition and weapons. Every organization at [the Defense Department] is coming here to ask questions,” Levy said.\n\nThey’re experts whose knowledge directly feeds into the operating force.\n\n“From this organization, they developed the M21 and M24 sniper rifles, all the way up to the latest Army ammunition that they’ve chosen,” said the unit’s commander, Army Lt. Col. H.T. Lawrence, who admitted that before he joined the unit, he didn’t realize its significance. “All those [tests] and evaluations — all those items come through the AMU.”\n\n“If a competitive shooter sees that there’s a device or an item that could make him more lethal in competition and on the battlefield, we can design it here, we can produce it, test it and evaluate it, and then turn it over to the Army for full-scale production,” Levy said.\n\nHow do they advertise their skills and innovations to the American public? Through competition.\n\n“We have the ability to connect America’s Army to America’s people,” Levy said. “When they see us at competitions, they know that we’re there to win.”"
