        "text": "Software as a Service (SaaS) is one of the fastest growing industries today. Businesses are increasingly investing in SaaS solutions – so much so that nearly 73 percent of businesses will be purely running on SaaS applications by the end of 2020. However, customers stick to only those brands that offer an outstanding experience. Thus, focusing on customer experience has become inevitable for all SaaS founders, in order to acquire new customers and retain the existing ones. In-house IT and on-premise systems are no longer able to keep pace with today’s business and technology imperatives. Enterprises are looking to reduce capital investments on IT infrastructure, while becoming more agile and responsive. Developing, deploying and maintaining on-premise applications ties up budget and resources that could be invested in innovation."
