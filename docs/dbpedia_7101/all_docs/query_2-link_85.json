Cloud users may access the server resources using a computer, netbook, pad computer, smart phone, or other device. In cloud computing, applications are provided and managed by the cloud server and data is also stored remotely in the cloud configuration. Users do not download and install applications on their own device or computer; all processing and storage is maintained by the cloud server. The on-line services may be offered from a cloud provider or by a private organization.",

        "text": "What is Cloud Computing\n\nCloud computing refers to the use and access of multiple server-based computational resources via a digital network Internet connection using the World Wide Web, etc.). Cloud users may access the server resources using a computer, netbook, pad computer, smart phone, or other device. In cloud computing, applications are provided and managed by the cloud server and data is also stored remotely in the cloud configuration. Users do not download and install applications on their own device or computer; all processing and storage is maintained by the cloud server. The on-line services may be offered from a or by a private organization.\n\nHow it differs from the Client Server Model\n\nCloud computing differs from the classic client-server model by providing applications from a server that are executed and managed by a client’s web browser, with no installed client version of an application required. Centralization gives cloud service providers complete control over the versions of the browser-based applications provided to clients, which removes the need for version upgrades or license management on individual client computing devices.Any computer or web-friendly device connected to the Internet may access the same pool of computing power, applications, and files in a cloud-computing environment. Data is centrally stored, so the user does not need to carry a storage medium such as a DVD or thumb drive. Desktop applications that connect to internet-host email providers may be considered cloud applications, including web-based Gmail,Hotmail. Private companies may also make use of their own customized cloud email servers for their employees.\n\nWhat does a Cloud User Need\n\nA cloud user needs a client device such as a laptop or desktop computer, pad computer, smart phone, or other computing resource with a web browser (or other approved access route) to access a cloud system via the World Wide Web. Typically the user will log into the cloud at a service provider or private company, such as their employer. Cloud computing works on a client-server basis, using web browser protocols. The cloud provides server-based applications and all data services to the user, with output displayed on the client device.\n\nList of Cloud Computing Companies in India\n\nCloud Computing in India is also showing sharp growth due to inherent value created by this new technology paradigm.A number of small companies have started taking a lead in the space like Zenith,Wolf etc.Given that Cloud Computing is rapidly becoming pervasive in the entire IT area,most top Indian IT companies have also started rolling out cloud computing products.\n\n1) Zenith Infotech – is an international company serving IT Service Providers worldwide.
