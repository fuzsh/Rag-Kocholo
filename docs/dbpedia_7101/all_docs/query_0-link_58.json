        "text": "The objective of this paper is to study the impact of cloud computing on the modern education. Further, the study also attempts to answer whether the services of cloud computing are significant in the education sector. Education institutions are under increasing pressure to deliver more for less, and they need to find ways to offer rich, affordable services and tools. Both public and private institutions can use the cloud to deliver better services, even as they work with fewer resources. By sharing IT services in the cloud, your educational institution can outsource noncore services and better concentrate on offering students, teachers, faculty, and staff the essential tools to help them succeed."
