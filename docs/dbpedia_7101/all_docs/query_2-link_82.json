        "text": "The Google Cloud Platform Partner Program will provide \"our partners with the tools, training and resources they need to successfully address your business' IT needs,\" wrote Eric Morse, who is Google's head of sales and business development for the Google Cloud Platform, in a blog entry .\n\nGoogle will offer resources around its cloud offerings such as the Google Compute Engine, Google App Engine, Google BigQuery, and Google Cloud Storage. Google did not detail what specific tools, training and resources it would offer, nor what the qualifications are for becoming a partner.\n\nAs with most IT partnerships, however, Google partners expect the company to provide sales leads and give assistance as the partners pursue their own possible leads. Google could also provide early access and engineering expertise for new technologies.\n\nAccording to David Cope, chief marketing officer of Google technology partner CliQr, the partnership provides CliQr with \"the exposure and working relationship with Google's sales and marketing teams.\" Backed by Google Ventures, for switching and running virtual workloads across multiple cloud providers. Google admitted CliQr to the partner program after Google managers reviewed CliQr's technology."
