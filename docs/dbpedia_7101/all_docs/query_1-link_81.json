        "text": "Recently Minister of State for Finance Mr. Jayant Sinha has announced that Investors could form a group that could with certification by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) would gain a waiver from the angel tax. Sinha said the Sebi was empowered to waive the tax for defined groups. Angel investors can register as a collective and avail of the exemption if they meet required criteria.\n\nAn angel investor or angel (also known as a business angel or informal investor or angel funder) is an affluent individual who provides capital for a business start-up, usually in exchange for convertible debt or ownership equity. A small but increasing number of angel investors organize themselves into angel groups or angel networks to share research and pool their investment capital, as well as to provide advice to their portfolio companies. Angels typically invest their own funds, unlike venture capitalists who manage the pooled money of others in a professionally-managed fund. Although typically reflecting the investment judgment of an individual, the actual entity that provides the funding may be a trust, business, limited liability company, investment fund, or other vehicle. A Harvard report by William R. Kerr, Josh Lerner, and Antoinette Schoar provides evidence that angel-funded startup companies have historically been less likely to fail than companies that rely on other forms of initial financing.\n\nThere is no “set amount” for angel investors, and the range can go anywhere from a few thousand, to a few million dollars. In a large shift from 2009, in 2010 healthcare/medical accounted for the largest share of angel investments, with 30% of total angel investments (vs. 17% in 2009), followed by software (16% vs. 19% in 2007), biotech (15% vs. 8% in 2009), industrial/energy (8% vs. 17% in 2009), retail (5% vs. 8% in 2009) and IT services (5%).\n\nAngel investment scenario in India has seen a significant rise in past two years. Indian Angel Network (IAN) and Mumbai Angels are the largest networks in the country. Recently Infosys Ltd co-founder and former vice-chairman Kris Gopalakrishnan and angel investor Indian Angel Network (IAN) invested an undisclosed amount in Retailworx India Pvt. Ltd that sells fruits and vegetables on the streets using battery-operated carts under the FreshWorld brand. To address the early stage investment problem that many entrepreneurs face, LetsVenture (LetsVenture is an online platform that acts as a bridge between startups and investors and also facilitates angel and seed investments) has launched LetsIgnite, an angel summit, aiming to connect startups to the angel ecosystem. The first LetsIgnite summit is scheduled to be held on April 22.\n\nTop Angel Investors In India\n\nSUNIL KALRA: Sunil Kalra started his career in exports and later set up a leather apparel manufacturing unit which succeeded and gave him an opportunity to work with global designers.
