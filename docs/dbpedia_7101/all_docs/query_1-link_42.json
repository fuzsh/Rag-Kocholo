        "text": "The use of technology has become an intrinsic part of our lives and most of the economic activities now takes place electronically. Emerging at a fast pace, new technologies allow businesses to be more innovative and competitive. Many of these new technologies foster collaboration, not without creating conflicting needs. Companies must ensure that they use technology safely while engaging more stakeholders to be more competitive. As the Cloud computing gaining popularity, it is also carrying some concerns to the implementors. This paper focuses on the topics such as issues in Cloud Computing, risks related to the privacy and how we can ensure the confidentiality of data\n\nCloud computing is a rising paradigm for large scale infrastructures. Cloud computing is a technology that being hugely adopted by many organizations like Google, Microsoft , Facebook, Amazon so that the resources are available to multiple users at a time over the internet on demand at any place and any time. Cloud computing opens up a new world of opportunities for entrepreneurships for small company to large company, but with these opportunities there are numerous security challenges that need to be considered and addressed prior to migrating to a cloud computing .Security and privacy issues present a strong barrier for users to use Cloud Computing systems. sThe security problem of cloud computing is very important and it can prevent the quick development of cloud computing. We have discussed the related work done by different author in cloud security[10]. This paper discusses security issues necessities and challenges that cloud service providers (CSP)and user face in cloud atmosphere ,and we also assess how security, trust and privacy issues occur in the situation of cloud computing and discuss ways in which they may be addressed.\n\nThis paper focuses on analyzing security and privacy problems facing cloud computing. The major issue discussed in the research that of losing control of data by both the cloud service providers (CSPs) and cloud service users (CSOs). Cloud computing offers organizations an innovative business model to adopt IT services without having to incur massive investment costs. A general analysis of the cloud is provided including its various forms. The growth and development of cloud computing technology are hampered by the fears of losing control of sensitive data by corporations and individuals. Solutions regarding this problem are discussed, and an intensive elucidation of the optimal one is included.\n\nThe most technological trend in the IT world is cloud computing, and because of its youth, both its users and its manufacturers have certain concerns. Looking over its literature, we can observe that the primary issues are trust, privacy, and security. That makes a significant barrier for users to use. Hence, to determine whether cloud computing would be accepted, we decided to assess various issues, including security. In this article, the security paradigm was the central issue, focusing on privacy safeguards and the need for trustworthiness to implement cloud computing. As a by-product, we have suggested radical innovations for enhancing security, reducing risks, improving trust, and protecting consumers, which are crucial for the adoption of cloud computing.\n\nCloud computing is attracting great attention nowadays. The elastic nature of cloud makes it suitable for almost any type of organization. The major challenge faced by cloud users and providers are security concerns towards cloud services. These security issues acts as a barrier in the growth of cloud computing. The trust between provider and users is the most important factor to be considered for a cloud service and application. The notion of trust among the various cloud users is also essential to promote the reputation of various cloud providers and their offered services. Here we present an analysis of security issues in a cloud environment. Solution exists to a certain extent for various issues. There are trust based solutions available to provide security in various collaborative environments. Analysis of these solutions can be used to think about a trust based solution in a cloud computing environment.\n\nThe Cloud Computing concept offers dynamically scalable resources provisioned as a service over the Internet. Economic benefits are the main driver for the Cloud, since it promises the reduction of capital expenditure and operational expenditure. In order for this to become reality, however, there are still some challenges to be solved. Amongst these are security and trust issues, since the user’s data has to be released to the Cloud and thus leaves the protection sphere of the data owner. Most of the discussions on these topics are mainly driven by arguments related to organisational means. This paper focuses on various security issues arising from the usage of Cloud services and especially by the rapid development of Cloud computing arena. It also discusses basic security model followed by various High Level Security threats in the industry. https://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/"
