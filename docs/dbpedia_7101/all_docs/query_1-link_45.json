SAP Signavio is the first to bring all these components into a unified set of solutions, combining deep process analysis with the tools needed for process re-engineering or creating entirely new and innovative business processes. It covers business process design, benchmarking, gap analysis, improvement, and process change management. Today we learn about how SAP Signavio has the capability to make your process management even more intelligent, accessible - and alive. Let’s go.\n\nA process-driven business transformation supports organizations across all industries and dimensions to compare their status quo with target state and “as-implemented” versions of their business processes. You may gain an understanding of any variances in your systems, optimize the data collected in those systems, and pull it all together to reveal your story with the help of intuitive dashboards and investigative interfaces. By linking processes to operations, you can perform data-driven, end-to-end transformation initiatives based on conclusive proof. This way, you can unlock the information, visibility, and quantifiable numbers needed for continual growth and process excellence. All this is possible with SAP Signavio Process Intelligence.\n\nSAP Signavio Process Intelligence is an integral part of the SAP Signavio Process Transformation Suite. The solution covers the latest process mining capabilities at scale, supporting smarter business decision-making by providing powerful fact-based insights into potential risks and continuous enhancement opportunities. It therefore enables you to identify hidden business value in your processes and data. SAP Signavio Process Intelligence allows you to run highly granular process analysis for actionable enhancements, create smart diagnostics to test bottlenecks and simulations, evaluate process change alternatives considering best practices, optimize business processes for robotic process automation (RPA), hyper-automation, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) as well as derive precise customer behavior for improved customer journeys. In the context of RISE with SAP, the solution further boosts your S/4HANA transformation to the next level.\n\nIn short, SAP Signavio Collaboration Hub transforms the way your talents work together. It offers a holistic platform for harnessing the wisdom of the crowd to continuously innovate and optimize processes. This means it acts as a single source of process truth, providing you with live insights as well as giving your employees a company-wide and transparent meeting point to combine their work and expertise related to the business processes. With SAP Signavio Collaboration Hub, you can stay up to date with changes to your process models in real time and view any process content in a clear and simple way. It allows you to understand, track and manage joint projects and organize process content across the entire Signavio Business Transformation Suite, including SAP Signavio Process Intelligence, SAP Signavio Process Manager, SAP Signavio Journey Modeler, and SAP Signavio Process Governance. The Hub further drives initiatives across your enterprise by ensuring everyone is on the same page, streamlining presentations and providing easy-to-understand updates to all involved stakeholders. SAP Signavio Collaboration Hub can also be personalized. You can assign individuals to specific groups. These group-based entry points mean no more time wasted searching for the information relevant to the actual work. You may manage exactly how the Hub looks and feels across the workplace for specific user groups as well as curate your own newsfeed using subscriptions to the process models, conversations, or areas of work that are most relevant to them. By customizing the view of the Hub, you can structure your tasks for better clarity, and improve user satisfaction and productivity.\n\nWhile business leaders need to act fast in today’s fast-moving world, they require capabilities to better understand their critical business processes and to adjust and align all available resources across their organization – all in real time.
