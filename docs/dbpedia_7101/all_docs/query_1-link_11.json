        "text": "Developers and power users can now use Google Apps Script to push workflow tasks and data collected in workflows to their existing ERP systems and cloud applications.\n\nOrangeScape today announced it has added integration capability to Kissflow™, the most installed workflow creator app on the Google Apps marketplace™. Kissflow now synchronizes workflow tasks and form data collected in workflows to Google spreadsheets, automating your workflow with Apps script integration. Developers can use Google Apps Script in Google spreadsheets to integrate with their on-premise and cloud applications.\n\n“Building workflows on Kissflow is extremely simple. You don’t need even a line of code to get your workflows running on Kissflow. But, when it comes to integration, we have to be realistically simple. That’s why we chose Google Apps Script.” said Mani Doraisamy, Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer of OrangeScape. “Google Apps Script provides the right mix of simplicity and flexibility that is needed for integrating applications. With this feature, powers users and IT teams who are familiar with Excel macros and Google Apps Script can do integration easily.”\n\nThis integration capability opens up new possibilities and use cases for workflows in Kissflow. The Captain’s Armband Ltd, a premier sports memorabilia retailer in UK is one of the first companies to use Google Apps Script in the trusted tester program of Kissflow. They use Google workflows with their e-commerce system.\n\n“Kissflow Workflow is by far the easiest Workflow/Business Process Management tool that I have used. Coupled with the fact that it is designed as an integral part of the Google App Engine space, Kissflow allows us to fully harness and extend our capabilities on Google’s cloud based infrastructure.” said Robert France, Director of IT, The Captain’s Armband Ltd (UK). “The core workflow features are extended with data export functionality. This allows our business workflows that have been completed and approved to be instantly available within Google spreadsheets. This feature alone, allows process owners to design complex forms (using Excel like functions) containing approval structures and then work directly with the data that has been collected in the familiar environment of Google spreadsheets. This then allows further processing of the data by using Google Apps Script, where the data manipulation/visualization possibilities are endless.”\n\nPricing\n\nKissflow offers a pricing plan for businesses of all sizes and requirements.
