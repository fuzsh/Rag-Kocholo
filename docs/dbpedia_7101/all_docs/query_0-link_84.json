        "text": "Google may have a new option for cloud resellers, according to a recent CloudTweaks article. Google Apps have already been available through resellers via the software-as-a-service model, but not through platform- or infrastructure-as-a-service. The company's new Cloud Partner Program will change that by giving partners access to the Google App Engine and Compute Engine. According to the article, resellers will now be able to offer Google products across multiple layers of the cloud computing stack – a major step in challenging the current cloud storage and services market leader.\n\nA Google blog post highlighted the advantage of working with partners and identified two different partnerships that can be formed through the new program.\n\n\"This program provides our partners with the tools, training and resources they need to successfully address your business’ IT needs,\" the post stated. \"For example, Orangescape Technologies, one of our partners, integrated Google App Engine as part of their platform to help United Biscuits, a leading manufacturer of biscuits and snacks in Europe, migrate their legacy Lotus Notes applications to the cloud.\"\n\n1. Service Partners\n\nAccording to Google, service partners provide consulting and help with implementation on Google Cloud platforms. Organizations can leverage expertise from service partners to enhance business, mobile and social apps.\n\n2. Technology partners\n\nTechnology partners provide tools that can integrate with one of Google's solutions. The blog post listed three technology options to highlight the value technology partners can provide, including the Google Compute Engine, Google BigQuery and Google Cloud Storage.\n\n\"Cloud Storage technology partners have integrated Google Cloud Storage directly into their offerings to provide you with active archiving, backup and recovery, and primary storage solutions,\" the post stated."
