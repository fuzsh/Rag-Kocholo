        "text": "Is your company plagued by frequent miscommunication and disorganization? Delayed approvals, misplaced documents, poor accountability, and other obstacles hinder operational efficiency and customer service quality. Daily mishaps sometimes seem small but can come at a great cost. Lack of access to a consolidated internal document source — just one problem alone — can waste up to eight hours a work week per employee according to Workfront’s “State of Work Report.”\n\nA comprehensive solution to alleviate office chaos lies at your fingertips: business process management. With BPM, repetitive business processes are organized through standardized workflows on a centralized system, enabling consistent communication and collaboration for maximum efficiency. Strategic implementation of BPM has the potential to transform your company from the inside out. Here’s how.\n\nLess email headache\n\nApproximately 6.5 hours of an average American work week goes to email management, hardly anyone’s favorite way to spend their time on the job. BPM systems offer uniform communication channels for each workflow, ensuring forms are sent to the right person at the right time, every time. Notifications and reminders can prevent neglected tasks and irritating status inquiries.\n\nSimplified document management\n\nAPI integration allows seamless cohesion between BPM systems and email, calendars, accounting software, and more. Integrated systems decrease redundancy and provide easy access to data on smartphone apps when staff members are out of office. Within workflows, relevant team members can view and modify a single visible record and track changes. Since internal documents are consistently found on an organized, central system, those 6.5 hours a week wasted on document hunts can be used constructively.\n\nIncreased compliance\n\nFailure to comply with legal or regulatory standards is not only expensive, but it also tarnishes the brand name and disrupts client relations. When procedural tasks are fixed in assignment and sequence through automated workflow management, compliance improves, potentially saving millions of dollars in rework while boosting productivity.\n\nScalable processes\n\nThanks to cloud-based BPM tools, IT departments don’t have to worry about upgrading to another new system when more employees come on board or when data input skyrockets. Subscriptions can be easily expanded or contracted to include the appropriate number of users and applications can be opened or closed depending on business needs. Additionally, company expansion usually means more workers are required to manage the increasing amount of data in the IT and finance departments, but not when information is already being routed through automated workflows.\n\nBetter collaboration\n\nConstantly switching between work apps can be frustrating, but workflow management systems bring all communication onto one platform accessible on-the-go. Digital checklists and reminders keep team members on track, and monitoring capabilities identify bottlenecks for increased accountability and efficiency. As users get accustomed to BPM, they can begin to identify ways to improve workflows by modifying forms, permissions, or task sequence, and fine-tuning becomes a unified team effort.\n\nReduced errors\n\nRepetitive manual data entry always leads to occasional errors, but when data flows down a pre-chartered course and automatically populates integrated forms, error reduction potential is significant. As an organization grows, data integrity remains manageable on an automated BPM platform.\n\nReal-time tracking\n\nEffective BPMs provide a way to track process status from start to finish, enabling strategic analysis for improvement. If deadlines aren’t being met, managers can effectively evaluate the process. Did all parties have the necessary information to complete their task on time? Are additional resources needed? Does the project require more or less time than projected? Thanks to real-time tracking, process performance metrics are readily available.\n\nReliable reports\n\nMeasurable feedback and predictive analytics equip executives with an essential roadmap. Visual tools such as pie charts and bar graphs, accessible through an interactive user interface, make reports down-to-earth. By linking with other software, reports on overall operations, such as annual expenditures, can be rendered for evaluating performance. Exportable reports can be shared with departments, management, or stakeholders, generating better-informed decisions for the future.\n\nData security\n\nWith data breaches on the rise, security has become a hot topic. Web-based BPM systems include data encryption and use top-notch data centers around the world for maximum safeguarding. Sensitive information can be marked confidential and for management’s eyes only. When company data is in reliable hands, security anxieties are kept at bay.\n\nGain an edge\n\nC-suite executives who understand technology’s potential to raise the bar for response time in the current on-demand consumer market are streamlining internal operations through digital transformation using tools like BPM. Heightened efficiency will enable businesses to scoot past competitors as employees are empowered to spend more time innovating. Leveraging business process automation won’t just cut costs, it will help establish long-term success.\n\nIt’s that simple\n\nDon’t let the chaos of disorganization wreak havoc in the life of your business when a straightforward, low-cost solution is readily available. Your first workflow application can be up and running in less than 15 minutes without an IT expert, thanks to the latest low-code BPM platforms. Resolve multiple problems today with just a few clicks — yes, it’s that’s simple!"
