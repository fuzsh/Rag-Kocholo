What is Azure Cloud Service?\n\nBy creating a cloud service, you can deploy a multi-tier web application in Azure, defining multiple roles to distribute processing and allow flexible scaling of your application. An Azure cloud service consists of one or more web roles and/or worker roles, each with its own application files and configuration.\n\nAzure Websites and Virtual Machines also enable web applications on Azure. The main advantage of cloud services is the ability to support more complex multi-tier architectures.\n\n2. What is a cloud service role?\n\nA cloud service role is comprised of application files and a configuration. A cloud service can have two types of roles.\n\n3. What is the link to a resource?\n\nTo show your cloud service’s dependencies on other resources, such as an Azure SQL Database instance, you can “link” the resource to the cloud service. In the Preview Management Portal, you can view linked resources on the Linked Resources page, view their status on the dashboard, and scale a linked SQL Database instance along with the service roles on the Scale page. Linking a resource in this sense does not connect the resource to the application; you must configure the connections in the application code.\n\n4. What is scale of a cloud service?\n\nA cloud service is scaled out by increasing the number of role instances (virtual machines) deployed for a role. A cloud service is scaled in by decreasing role instances. In the Preview Management Portal, you can also scale a linked SQL Database instance, by changing the SQL Database edition and the maximum database size, when you scale your service roles.\n\n5. What is a web role?\n\nA web role provides a dedicated Internet Information Services (IIS) web-server used for hosting front-end web applications.\n\n6. What is a worker's role?\n\nApplications hosted within worker roles can run asynchronous, long-running, or perpetual tasks independent of user interaction or input.\n\n7. What is a role instance?\n\nA role instance is a virtual machine on which the application code and role configuration run. A role can have multiple instances, defined in the service configuration file.\n\n8. What is a guest operating system?\n\nThe guest operating system for a cloud service is the operating system installed on the role instances (virtual machines) on which your application code runs.\n\n[ Related Article: Benefits of Azure Automation ]\n\n9. What is a cloud service component?\n\nThree components are required in order to deploy an application as a cloud service in Azure:\n\n10. What are deployment environments?\n\nAzure offers two deployment environments for cloud services: a staging environment in which you can test your deployment before you promote it to the production environment. The two environments are distinguished only by the virtual IP addresses (VIPs) by which the cloud service is accessed.\n\nIn the staging environment, the cloud service’s globally unique identifier (GUID) identifies it in URLs (GUID.cloudapp.net). In the production environment, the URL is based on the friendlier DNS prefix assigned to the cloud service (for example, myservice.cloudapp.net).\n\n11. What is a service definition file?\n\nThe cloud service definition file (.csdef) defines the service model, including the number of roles.\n\n12. What is a service configuration file?\n\nThe cloud service configuration file (.cscfg) provides configuration settings for the cloud service and individual roles, including the number of role instances.\n\n13. What is a service package?\n\nThe service package (.cspkg) contains the application code and the service definition file.\n\n14. What is a cloud service deployment?\n\nA cloud service deployment is an instance of a cloud service deployed to the Azure staging or production environment. You can maintain deployments in both staging and production.\n\n[ Related Article: Azure Data Studio vs SSMS]\n\n15. What is Azure Diagnostics?\n\nAzure Diagnostics is the API that enables you to collect diagnostic data from applications running in Azure. Azure Diagnostics must be enabled for cloud service roles in order for verbose monitoring to be turned on.\n\n16. What is Azure Service Level Agreement (SLA)?\n\nThe Azure Compute SLA guarantees that, when you deploy two or more role instances for every role, access to your cloud service will be maintained at least 99.95 percent of the time. Also, detection and corrective action will be initiated 99.9 percent of the time when a role instance’s process is not running.\n\n17. What is Cloud Computing?\n\nCloud computing is the use of computing resources (hardware and software) that are delivered as a service over a network (typically the Internet).\n\n18. What is the Service Model in Cloud Computing?\n\nCloud computing providers offer their services according to three fundamental models: Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS) where IaaS is the most basic and each higher model abstracts from the details of the lower models.\n\nExamples of IaaS include Amazon CloudFormation (and underlying services such as Amazon EC2), Rackspace Cloud, Terremark, Windows Azure Virtual Machines, Google Compute Engine. and Joyent.\n\nExamples of PaaS include Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, Cloud Foundry, Heroku, Force.com, EngineYard, Mendix, Google App Engine, Windows Azure Compute, and OrangeScape.\n\nExamples of SaaS include Google Apps, Microsoft Office 365, and Onlive. Source from.\n\n19. What are the different cloud deployment models?\n\nCloud deployment models describe how cloud services are offered to users. The major deployment models associated with cloud computing are listed below:\n\nPublic cloud: Here, computing services are offered through third-party providers across the public internet and server.\n\nPrivate cloud: Here, computing services are offered either over the private internal network or the internet only to the selected users.\n\nHybrid cloud: Here, the cloud computing environment combines both public cloud and private cloud, allowing to share of data and applications between them.\n\nVisit here to learn Microsoft Azure Course in Hyderabad\n\n20. Explain traffic manager benefits in Azure?\n\nThe major benefits offered by the traffic manager in Azure are:\n\nDistribution of traffic based on several traffic-routing methods.\n\nContinuous monitoring of endpoint health and automatic failover when endpoints fail.\n\n21. What is a break-fix issue?\n\nIn Azure, break-fix issues are referred to as technical problems. It is an industry term used when “work involved in supporting a technology when it fails its normal course of action”.\n\n22. What is Azure Active Directory and how it is used?\n\nMicrosoft offers Azure active directory(Azure AD), a fully managed multi-tenant service that implements identity and access capabilities for applications running in Azure as well as applications operating in the on-premises environment. It is used for providing single sign-on and multi-factor authentication to help users from protecting attacks.\n\n[ Related Article: What is Azure Arc? ]\n\n23. What is an Availability Set?\n\nAvailability Set is a logical grouping capability majorly employed for separating VM sources from each other when they are deployed. They are used for building reliable cloud solutions.\n\nThe VMs placed in the Availability set are run across various physical servers, storage units, compute racks, and network switches in Azure. If any failure occurs, only VMs subset is affected, and the overall solution stays operational.\n\n24. What is the use of a Lookup transformation?\n\nLookup transformation is used for performing lookups by combining data in input columns with columns in the reference dataset. The reference table can be a new table or an existing table, view, or the SQL result query result.\n\n25. Name the web application types that can be deployed with Azure?\n\nThe web applications that can be deployed with Azure are ASP.Net, PHP, and WCF.\n\n26. Explain Azure Resource Manager?\n\nAzure Resource Manager is used for provisioning management and deployment services in Azure. The management layer is used for updating and deleting resources in Azure subscription. You can organize related resources in resource groups and deploy your resources with JSON templates.\n\n27. What is a Fault Domain?\n\nA Fault domain represents the group of the underlying hardware that shares a common power source and network switch. Every fault domain comprises some racks and each contains a virtual machine. When you create virtual machines within an availability set, your virtual machines are automatically distributed across the fault domains in the Azure platform.\n\n28. What are Update Domains?\n\nThe updated domain represents the group of the underlying hardware that can be rebooted or can withstand maintenance at the same time. When you create virtual machines within an availability set, your virtual machines are automatically distributed across the update domains by the Azure platform. This ensures that at least one instance of your applications always remains working when the Azure platform is under periodic maintenance.\n\n29. What is the difference between Azure Service Bus Queues and Storage Queues?\n\nTwo types of queue mechanisms are supported by Azure: Storage queues and Service Bus queues.\n\nStorage queues: These are part of the Azure storage infrastructure, features a simple REST-based GET/PUT/PEEK interface. Provides persistent and reliable messaging within and between services.\n\nService Bus queues: These are part of a broader Azure messaging infrastructure that helps to queue as well as publish/subscribe, and more advanced integration patterns.\n\n30. Explain Azure Service Fabric?\n\nAzure Service Fabric is a distributed platform designed by Microsoft to facilitate the development, deployment, and management of highly scalable and customizable applications. The applications created in this environment consist of detached microservices that communicate with each other through service application programming interfaces.\n\n31. Define the Azure Redis Cache?\n\nAzure Redis Cache is an open-source and in-memory Redis cache that helps web applications to fetch data from a backend data source into cache and server web pages from the cache to enhance the application performance. It provides a powerful and secure way to cache the application’s data in the Azure cloud.\n\n32. Explain the types of services you can build with the Service Fabric?\n\nMajorly, two types of services you can build on Service Fabric:\n\nStateless Services: No state is stored in the service. The longer-term state is stored in an external database. This is the typical application/data layer approach to build services.\n\nStateful Services: The state is stored in the service. Allows the state to persist without the need for an external database.\n\n33. What is the Windows Azure Platform?\n\nA collective name of Microsoft’s Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering which provides a programming platform, a deployment vehicle, and a runtime environment of cloud computing hosted in Microsoft data centers.\n\n34. What are the roles available in Windows Azure?\n\nAll three roles (web, worker, VM) are essentially Windows Server 2008. Web and Worker roles are nearly identical: With Web and Worker roles, the OS and related patches are taken care of for you; you build your app’s components without having to manage a VM\n\n35. What is the difference between the Windows Azure Platform and Windows Azure?\n\nThe former is Microsoft’s PaaS offering including Windows Azure, SQL Azure, and AppFabric; while the latter is part of the offering and Microsoft’s cloud OS.\n\n36. What are the three main components of the Windows Azure Platform?\n\nCompute.\n\nStorage.\n\nAppFabric.\n\nAzure Interview Questions for Experienced\n\n37. What is Windows Azure compute emulator?\n\nThe compute emulator is a local emulator of Windows Azure that you can use to build and test your application before deploying it to Windows Azure.\n\n38. What is the fabric?\n\nIn the Windows Azure cloud fabric is nothing but a combination of many virtualized instances which run the client application\n\nCheckout Microsoft Azure Course in Bangalore\n\n39. How many instances of a Role should be deployed to satisfy Azure SLA (service level agreement)? And what’s the benefit of Azure SLA?\n\nTWO. And if we do so, the role would have external connectivity at least 99.95% of the time.\n\n40. What are the options to manage the session state in Windows Azure?\n\nWindows Azure Caching\n\nSQL Azure\n\nAzure Table\n\n41. What is CSPack?\n\nIt is a command-line tool that generates a service package file (.cspkg) and prepares an application for deployment, either to Windows Azure or to the compute emulator.\n\n42. What is Csrun?\n\nIt is a command-line tool that deploys a packaged application to the Windows Azure compute emulator and manages the running service.\n\n43. What is the guest OS?\n\nIt is the operating system that runs on the virtual machine that hosts an instance of a role.\n\n[ Related Article: Learn Azure Key Vault ]\n\n44. How to programmatically scale-out Azure Worker Role instances?\n\nUsing AutoScaling Application Block\n\n45. What is the difference between Public Cloud and Private Cloud?\n\nA public cloud is used as a service via the Internet by the users, whereas a private cloud, as the name conveys is deployed within certain boundaries like firewall settings and is completely managed and monitored by the users working on it in an organization.\n\nAzure Administrator Interview Questions and Answers\n\n46. How to design applications to handle connection failure in Windows Azure?\n\nThe Transient Fault Handling Application Block supports various standard ways of generating the retry delay time interval, including fixed interval, incremental interval (the interval increases by a standard amount), and exponential back-off (the interval doubles with some random variation).\n\nstatic RetryPolicy policy = new RetryPolicy(5, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2), TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2)); policy.ExecuteAction(() => { try { string federationCmdText = @”USE FEDERATION Customer_Federation(ShardId =” + shardId + “) WITH RESET, FILTERING=ON”; customerEntity.Connection.Open(); customerEntity.ExecuteStoreCommand(federationCmdText); } catch (Exception e) { customerEntity.Connection.Close(); SqlConnection.ClearAllPools(); } });\n\n47. What is Windows Azure Diagnostics?\n\nWindows Azure Diagnostics enables you to collect diagnostic data from an application running in Windows Azure. You can use diagnostic data for debugging and troubleshooting, measuring performance, monitoring resource usage, traffic analysis and capacity planning, and auditing.\n\nHTTP://WWW.WINDOWSAZURE.COM/EN-US/DEVELOP/NET/COMMON-TASKS/DIAGNOSTICS/\n\n48. What is Blob?\n\nBLOB stands for Binary Large Object. Blob is a file of any type and size.\n\nThe Azure Blob Storage offers two types of blobs:\n\nBlock Blob\n\nPage Blob\n\nURL format: Blobs are addressable using the following URL format:\n\n49. What is the difference between Block Blob vs Page Blob?\n\nBlock blobs are comprised of blocks, each of which is identified by a block ID.\n\nYou create or modify a block blob by uploading a set of blocks and committing them by their block IDs.\n\nIf you are uploading a block blob that is no more than 64 MB in size, you can also upload it in its entirety with a single Put Blob operation. -Each block can be a maximum of 4 MB in size. The maximum size for a block blob in version 2009-09-19 is 200 GB or up to 50,000 blocks.\n\nPage blobs are a collection of pages. A page is a range of data that is identified by its offset from the start of the blob. To create a page blob, you initialize the page blob by calling Put Blob and specifying its maximum size.\n\n-The maximum size for a page blob is 1 TB. A page written to a page blob may be up to 1 TB in size.\n\nWhat to use block blobs for streaming video. “The application must provide random read/write access” which is supported by Page Blobs.\n\n50. What is the difference between Windows Azure Queues and Windows Azure Service Bus Queues?\n\nWindows Azure supports two types of queue mechanisms: Windows Azure Queues and Service Bus Queues.\n\nWindows Azure Queues, which are part of the Windows Azure storage infrastructure, feature a simple REST-based Get/Put/Peek interface, providing reliable, persistent messaging within and between services.\n\nService Bus Queues are part of a broader Windows Azure messaging infrastructure dead-letters queuing as well as publish/subscribe, Web service remoting, and integration patterns.\n\nHTTP://WCFPRO.WORDPRESS.COM/2010/12/06/COMMUNICATION-IN-WINDOWS-AZURE/ HTTP://MSDN.MICROSOFT.COM/EN-US/LIBRARY/WINDOWSAZURE/HH767287.ASPX\n\n51. What is the dead letter queue?\n\nMessages are placed on the dead-letter sub-queue by the messaging system in the following scenarios.\n\nWhen a message expires and dead-lettering for expired messages is set to true in a queue or subscription.\n\nWhen the max delivery count for a message is exceeded on a queue or subscription.\n\nWhen a filter evaluation exception occurs in a subscription and dead-lettering is enabled on filter evaluation exceptions.\n\n52. What are swap deployments?\n\nTo promote a deployment in the Azure staging environment to the production environment, you can “swap” the deployments by switching the VIPs by which the two deployments are accessed. After the deployment, the DNS name for the cloud service points to the deployment that had been in the staging environment.\n\n53. What is minimal vs. verbose monitoring?\n\nMinimal monitoring, which is configured by default for a cloud service, uses performance counters gathered from the host operating systems for role instances (virtual machines). Verbose monitoring gathers additional metrics based on performance data within the role instances to enable a closer analysis of issues that occur during application processing. For more information\n\n54. What are the instance sizes of Azure?\n\nWindows Azure will handle the load balancing for all of the instances that are created. The VM sizes are as follows:\n\nCompute Instance Size CPU Memory Instance Storage I/O Performance\n\nExtra Small 1.0 GHz 768 MB 20 GB Low\n\nSmall 1.6 GHz 1.75 GB 225 GB Moderate\n\nMedium 2 x 1.6 GHz 3.5 GB 490 GB High\n\nLarge 4 x 1.6 GHz 7 GB 1,000 GB High\n\nExtra-large 8 x 1.6 GHz 14 GB 2,040 GB High.\n\n55. What is table storage in Windows Azure?\n\nThe Windows Azure Table storage service stores large amounts of structured data.\n\nThe service is a NoSQL data store that accepts authenticated calls from inside and outside the Windows Azure cloud.\n\nWindows Azure tables are ideal for storing structured, non-relational data\n\nTable: A table is a collection of entities. Tables don’t enforce a schema on entities, which means a single table can contain entities that have different sets of properties. An account can contain many tables\n\nEntity: An entity is a set of properties, similar to a database row. An entity can be up to 1MB in size.\n\nProperties: A property is a name-value pair. Each entity can include up to 252 properties to store data. Each entity also has 3 system properties that specify a partition key, a row key, and a timestamp.\n\nEntities with the same partition key can be queried more quickly, and inserted/updated in atomic operations. An entity’s row key is its unique identifier within a partition.\n\nHope you liked Mindmajix's Azure Interview Questions"
