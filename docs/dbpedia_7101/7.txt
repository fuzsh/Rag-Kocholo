OrangeScape provides an ORM layer and transaction support for Google App Engine's scalable NoSQL database. It allows distributed teams to collaborate simultaneously on projects through a browser-based studio. OrangeScape also features a 'working with data' approach to building rules engines on the cloud. Data models use a "network-of-objects" structure that allows flexible access through relationships. The platform includes built-in version control and runs multiple stable versions of the studio concurrently.
