i don't believe in all that magic stuff, wizards, witches, goblins...but obviously some people do, for instance, the person who answered this question first. and im not saying if they really exist, i mean, its not bad if you think the exist or if you don't, there are just different opinions on the subject.

But, of course. Hobgoblins are native to the United Kingdom and their numbers were more densely concentrated around the Scottish moors until the late 17th century. At which point their population dispersed across wider Europe. In fact, all hobgoblins must make a pilgrimage to Scotland once every 6.438 years. Although, many people are unaware of their existence, hobgoblins routinely live among the homo sapiens of the relatively new kingdom; Earth. These creatures are often grossly misrepresented in current literature, song and film as they have no real resemblance to the current media image. They are giving creatures who work vigorously for little payment. Methods of payment are limited to food. Unlike the homo sapien creatures who will accept many/any form of payment (ie. monetary donations, food, lude sexual favors, chocolate, etc.). Hobgbolins exhibit an insuppressable desire to tease those around them. Their favorite means of which are practical jokes. If ever you should notice you are missing car keys you can be sure that it was the work of a residing hobgoblin. We hope that our response was informative and helped you and others to gain the appropriate respect and knowledge these mischevious characters deserve.
