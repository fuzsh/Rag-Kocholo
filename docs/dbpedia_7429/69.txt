Goblins are often depicted as small, monstrous creatures. They are similar to gremlins or trolls, and are mischievous at best, murderous at worst. Some movies about goblins go against the grain, and feature friendly, helpful characters rather than troublemakers.

In the Harry Potter franchise, goblins are in charge of the financial system, while in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, goblins are dangerous obstacles to a journey. Goblins are more like monsters in movies like The Ghoulies and Don't Be Afraid of the Dark.
