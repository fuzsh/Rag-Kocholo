        "text": "Peter Bradshaw\n\n2006 has had its share of great movie moments. Penélope Cruz singing her heart out in Volver. Borat politely bringing his neatly bagged-up faeces to the dinner table. Clive Owen fighting his way through an urban war zone in Bexhill-on-Sea in Alfonso Cuarón's Children of Men. But my mind comes back again and again to Michael Haneke's great film, Hidden, which was released this year, and is now out on DVD. A scalp-prickling, skin-crawling, politico-psychological nightmare, of which an actual nightmare is one of the choicest moments. Daniel Auteuil plays the self-satisfied TV arts intellectual whose life is poisoned when he anonymously receives creepy three-hour surveillance videos of the street outside his flat. He suspects his tormentor is an Algerian, mistreated by his parents on the family farm as a boy. He has a nightmare that this boy - his face in shadow - is coming towards him with a hatchet, and wakes up, hyperventilating with fear. Generally, even the classiest films stick to the cheesy convention that people waking from a nightmare do so by sitting bolt upright in bed. But Auteuil surfaces from his bad dream still lying down, sideways: wheezing and whinnying with shock as he realises that so far from vanishing, his nightmare has intensified in the waking state. It is almost incredible that the \"nightmare\" scenario still has the power to disturb, but this one does, because, like the rest of the movie, it is horribly and intimately real.\n\nPeter Bradshaw's top five films of 2006:\n\nBorat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (dir: Larry Charles)\n\nUnited 93 (dir: Paul Greengrass)\n\nLondon to Brighton (dir: Paul Andrew Williams)\n\nVolver (dir: Pedro Almodóvar)\n\nHidden (dir: Michael Haneke)\n\nDavid Thomson\n\nIt was making a film: at Telluride in Colorado, for a documentary Todd McCarthy is making about Pierre Rissient (the great French cineaste), I sat with Pierre and Bertrand Tavernier and we simply talked about movies to illustrate French and American perspectives. We sat in the open, as the day clouded over with the mountains behind us. The others were kind enough to speak in English. And as we talked - mostly about Michael Powell and John Ford - our disagreements only seemed to bring us closer together. Three men well past 60 in a Colorado field discussing films of yesterday as if they matter still and as if the argument is all we have against the dull new films we have to see.\n\nWe were trying to be historians, while wondering if 20 years from now any such conversation would occur. In the end, I suggested that George Bush was in so many ways Fordian, and that that was one reason why our world is in its present state. The films may pass away, but the history goes on, spurred by the ideas in the films, whether we like it or not.\n\nFilm of the year: 20,000 Streets Under the City\n\nSteve Rose\n\nPerhaps it's an insult to the industry, but the most memorable thing I've seen on film all year didn't involve a director, a script or even actors. It was a fight between two bears in Werner Herzog's documentary Grizzly Man. On a beautiful Alaskan beach, these huge animals wrestle and maul each other with terrifying ferocity for what feels like an eternity, to the extent that you wonder if they'll both survive. It's the type of thing you feel you shouldn't be watching, and it left me shaking and adrenalised as if I'd been in a fight myself. Violence in movies is always aestheticised, and in wildlife documentaries it's usually politely brief, but here we're confronted with unadulterated \"nature\", literally red in tooth and claw. For added discomfort, there's the knowledge that the cameraman, Timothy Treadwell, was later killed and eaten by bears just like these. Despite having seen what they can do, Treadwell, the film's subject, sentimentalised these bears to a ridiculous degree - at one point in the film he goes into raptures about finding a fresh, warm bear turd by a river. Herzog's narration stays respectfully silent during the fight, but elsewhere he sums it up: \"What haunts me, is that in all the faces of all the bears that Treadwell ever filmed, I discover no kinship, no understanding, no mercy. I see only the overwhelming indifference of nature.\"\n\nFilm of the year: I can't decide between Hidden, The Squid and the Whale, The Host and A Scanner Darkly. Do I have to pick one?\n\nAndrew Pulver\n\nI never thought Pete Doherty amounted to much until, last Christmas, he turned up in a TV documentary about Tony Hancock. I've been a longtime fan of the Lad himself - partly because he reminds me of my dad - and if I paid more attention to rock'n'rollers, I would have known that Doherty was as well: he spoke with a curiously poetic fondness for Hancock's rancid blusterings. Later in the year, recovering from a rather unpleasant operation and in need of a bit of cheering up, I dug out The Rebel, the happier of Hancock's two film vehicles. Chief among its many jewels is Nanette Newman, playing a blue-lipsticked space cadet of a beatnik, who visits Hancock in his Paris atelier. He greets her with a sarcastic mutter (\"Oh dear, look what's just got back from Ascot\") but is then subjected to her \"existentialist\" maunderings. A flummoxed Hancock then offers her a bit of cheese, uttering the immortal words: \"You do eat ... food?\" Now, that's comedy. The Rebel is 45 years old now, but it's still superb from beginning to end.\n\nFilm of the year: The Departed\n\nPhelim O'Neil\n\nIf there's one thing a prolonged exposure to current movies teaches us it's that film-makers have lost the knack of ending a story. Sure, all films finish, some even on time, but few can wrap things up with anything approaching satisfaction. The last Lord of the Rings movie trundled on for at least half an hour before anyone informed the cast that they'd long since run out of story. Fantasy films seem to fare worst, as if the producers believe that an audience that will buy ghosts, aliens, hobgoblins and whatnot will buy anything - such as Superman Returns having the Man of Steel going from being deathly allergic to Kryptonite to hurling a continent sized chunk of the stuff into space.\n\nA decent ending is just one of the many reasons for seeing Pan's Labyrinth. I'm not going to give it away - although you should've seen it by now - but it ends in a manner that completely suits what has gone on beforehand. It doesn't cheat or kowtow to the audience and contains much poetry, however brutal. Its impact has as much to do with what occurs onscreen as it has with realising that it's evidence of a director who actually knows what he's doing. An enjoyable film may have you wishing that it will never end, but a classic knows exactly how and when to wind things up.\n\nFilm of the year: Pan's Labyrinth\n\nXan Brooks\n\nI liked the bit in Borat where the cowgirl falls off her horse. That makes me sound like Homer Simpson, who once derailed a critics' jury by championing a home video called \"Man Gets Hit in Groin by Football\". It's just that I've weighed up all the other contenders and nothing comes close.\n\nTaken as a whole, the Borat movie could be frustrating. Too many staged gags, too much crude plot to string them around. But that rodeo scene was a work of genius, teetering on the brink of outright anarchy. Having cheered Borat's call for George Bush to \"drink the blood of every man, woman and child in Iraq\", the crowd turns ugly when he attempts a rewrite of The Star-Spangled Banner. At ringside, the blonde-haired cowgirl promptly loses control of her steed and topples backwards into the dirt, still poignantly clutching her flag. You could view this as a heaven-sent piece of slapstick, or as a visual metaphor for America's recent misadventures in the outside world. As Homer said of his football video: \"It works on so many levels.\""
