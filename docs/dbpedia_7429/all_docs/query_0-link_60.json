You should use the correct word.’\n\n‘Sorry about that. Are you finished playing with your cereal?’\n\n‘Yes.’\n\n‘Good. Let’s go.’\n\nDis- can shed light on a word’s history or etymology. You probably know the verb enthral in the sense captivate: to ‘make you so interested in or excited by something that you give it all your attention’. Adding the dis- prefix produces the rare word disenthral, a recent addition to our Open Dictionary. Disenthral means release – not from captivation but from captivity; it means ‘set free, liberate’. This is because enthral originally meant ‘hold in thrall’ quite literally – to enslave or hold captive – and disenthral contains and negates that earlier sense.\n\nDear Problem Lady:\n\nAll my life I’ve said “heighth.” I thought that’s what you said. Then today my friend said to me, “It’s ‘height,’ isn’t it? At least I think so.”\n\n“Oh. Yeah, I guess it is, now that I think about it,” I said casually.\n\n“I thought so,” she said.\n\nI wanted to kill myself.\n\nShe knew damned well it was “height,” and she finally couldn’t stand it anymore.\n\nI see the word clearly in my mind and it sure doesn’t have an h at the end of it. I’ve been obsessing for ten hours now. Forty-two years, I’ve said “heighth.” And I’m a horse trainer, can you guess how many times I’ve said “heighth” in my career? I’m so mortified I think I should go up to everyone I know and say, “Look, I know it’s really height, okay? I’m not stupid or anything.”\n\nBut then they’d think I was stupid and insane.\n\nShould I just find a way to inject “height” into every conversation I have for the rest of my life?\n\nAbby\n\nRead the rest of this entry »"
