        "text": "This film is a bit hard to explain as it is not a direct sequel to the original. Granted, McCreedy is back and references blowing up a movie studio, but all the other characters are back too, only they are not the same actors and their characters are the same but are not... It is almost a spoof of the original, but at the same time it is not. Let's just say that the film tries to be all meta and fails, just like the first failed at being a horror comedy, but I admire those brave hobgoblins who kept on smiling despite having to literally work with worse actors than before!\n\nThe story, well, a group of students comprised of people with similar features of characters from the original are taking a tour of a mental hospital for class. Daphne, army dude, and nerdy best friend are okay. Not sure how they managed to find someone even more skull faced than the original Daphne though. Kevin acts about the same, but looks nothing like the original and his girlfriend does not act, nor does she look anything like before. Well, they visit McCreedy who is also a different actor who talks of hobgoblins and this time they are like bloody Mary and sometimes not. Look, it is just a very inconsistent time to be had...\n\nSo, yes, sometimes the hobgoblins come when you say the name three times, sometimes they feed on fear, but if that were the case the nerdy guy was just horny. I guess trying to find rhyme and reason in a film like this is a bit stupid. Just know that the acting is worse here and the jokes are of the non-funny variety.\n\nSo Hobgoblins 2 actually thanks Mystery Science Theater in its closing credits which shows that show did bring light to more unknown movies and that at times the makers of said films appreciated the push their films got due to it. Rick Sloan has made other films, but the only two I know of is this, the first film and Blood Theater. I think Blood Theater is actually the best of the bunch, but that is not really saying much. However, do what you love I guess..."
