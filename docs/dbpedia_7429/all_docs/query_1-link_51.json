        "text": "There are bad movies. And then there are God's mistakes like Hobgoblins (above) — a movie so painfully inept that any sequel to it might disprove the existence of said deity.\n\nSadly for people of faith everywhere, Shout Factory has announced the release of Hobgoblins 2 on DVD. Set for release next Tuesday, it will befoul stores alongside the Hobgoblins Special 20th Anniversary Edition. Honestly, the only way a DVD of Hobgoblins could be a \"special edition\" would be if the movie isn't actually on the DVD.\n\nThe original steaming heap from the 1980s was a clumsy, cheap and cynical Gremlins rip-off. A prominent player on IMDB's Worst List, Hobgoblins might have vanished from our national shame if Mystery Science Theater 3000 hadn't lampooned it. In fact, the video above directly credits MST3K for making the sequel possible.\n\nIt's a sad day for Tom Servo and Crow.\n\nSee also:\n\nMST3K RSVPs for MIT, iTunes ASAP\n\nShout Factory Unleashes Zombies, Mummies in Next MST3K Set\n\nYouTuber Recycles Riffs to Make New MST3K\n\nMST3K Vets Talk Fan Faves From New DVD Set\n\nMystery Science Theater Celebrates 20 Movie-Mocking Years With New DVD Set\n\nThe Australian Breaker Who Broke the Internet\n\nIt’s been a week since Rachael Gunn, aka Raygun, competed in the breaking competition at the Paris Olympics.
