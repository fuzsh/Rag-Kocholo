        "text": "Post by spacechief on\n\nOK so we all know that every movie shown on MST3K is bad, but there are some that eclipse bad and land somewhere around putrid. What do you think are the 5 Worst Movies ever riffed by Mike, Joel, and the Bots? Also give your reason why it's the worst.\n\n5. The Wild Wild World of Batwoman. This movie is just annoying. If they're all crime fighters then why dont they fight crime? Is the movie a comedy or a drama? It's just awful.\n\n4. Invasion of the Neptune Men. The movie that made Prince of Space look like a sci-fi classic. I've never once in my life actually wanted to see a group of Japanese kids roasted except in this movie.\n\n3. Giant Spider Invasion. This movie is in Wisconsin. Anything else needed?\n\n2. \"Manos\" the Hands of Fate. The movie that was actually written, filmed, and produced in Hell. Or El Paso. Same thing.\n\n1. Hobgoblins. The acting is equal to Manos, the plot is a little behind it, but the real reason this movie is number one is that it was just plain vulgar. The message is portrayed so clearly in the end by one of the bots (cant remember which) \"So this movie's saying that Daphne's a slut and Amy wasn't fun until she was a slut too.\" I really wish Tom had killed Rick Sloane\n\nPost by beljah on\n\njorel said:\n\nMonster A Go-Go has to be the worst ever. Dear Lord, what a mess. (Great ep though)\n\nYeah, I'd have to say that is probably the absolute worst movie in all aspects.\n\nI'd like to add \"Future War\". It's pretty much inept at everything it attempts. \"Hobgoblins\" has already been mentioned, \"Merlin's Shop of Mystical Wonders\", and \"Red Zone Cuba\" round out my five.\n\nPost by doctorz on\n\nWell, they are all pretty bad. My picks would be:\n\nThe Projected Man and The Deadly Bees. I'm grouping them together because nobody can make a dreary, life sapping movie like the English.....Unless they are the Americans who made The Creeping Terror and Ring of Terror.....or the Mexicans who made The Robot Vs. The Aztec Mummy. Wait that last one is only one movie. Seemed like two.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nIf you think Manos is worse than Monster A-Go Go then you haven't seen Monster A-Go Go. Manos at least had interesting characters, nice costumes, and a Shining type moment at the end. Monster A-Go Go is so bad that i have to say some interesting things about Manos, just goes to show you how Monster A-Go Go is the winner here.\n\nPost by leez34 on\n\n1) \"Manos\" The Hands of Fate - mythically bad. Honestly so bad it's surreal, like it was made in some parallel reality.\n\n2) Monster A-Go-Go - just as bad as Manos, but for different reasons. The acting isn't as bad and the editing is much better, but the plot doesn't even come close to making sense. Manos gets the top spot just because it's so lovably bad.\n\n3) Hobgoblins - horrible, horrible, horrible. I wish there really were a hotline. Why can't I find this movie un-MSTed anywhere?\n\n4) The Wild Wild World of Batwoman - the conversation with the guy speaking \"Chinese\" was so offensive...\n\n5) Red Zone Cuba - note to amateur filmmakers: if you want to make a war movie, you may need more than ten people in your cast.\n\nOther notes: I kind of like Giant Spider Invasion, The Deadly Bees, and Santa Claus Conquers the Martians. Certainly not GOOD movies, but not nearly as technically inept as any listed above.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nleez34 said:\n\n2) Monster A-Go-Go - just as bad as Manos, but for different reasons.

As for \"no editing,\" I'm sure I don't know what you mean. There's no clapboard left in the film either."
