        "text": "Among followers of Spider-Man continuity, The Hobgoblin is a “cult character”. If you wish to understand the appeal of Green Goblin or Doctor Octopus, there’s the five or six stories you can dive right away and immediately get to the good stuff. In the case of The Hobgoblin, this is a character with a high barrier of entry, and who ultimately cannot be entirely understood in terms of the panels and balloons on the page. He’s “inside baseball”, industrial grade fan boilerplate, of whom there’s not a single story to latch on to but rather a string of issues spread across a span of time. The Hobgoblin helps illustrate questions about supervillain design, characterization, serialization consolidated over time, as well as the difficulties inherent in telling a “murder mystery” in a superhero serialized narrative.\n\nThe Hobgoblin arrived in Spider-Man continuity in the form of a murder mystery, but behind-the-scenes set off a spiral of mixed messages and office feuds which by now has overwhelmed any commentary the story in panels-and-balloons had. I have no desire to explore that here, what counts for me is the conception and characterization of Hobgoblin himself. My contention is that the problems of the Hobgoblin mystery, its unraveling, its ultimate failure was inherent to its foundations. It illustrates to the difficulties of doing a proper murder mystery in a superhero story in general, but specifically in Marvel and Spider-Man in particular.\n\nThe Hobgoblin is a character who made his debut in Amazing Spider-Man #238 (1982) and launched a story-arc that ended (initially) in Amazing Spider-Man #289 (1987). A coda was published in the 90s called Hobgoblin Lives (1998) that provided a conclusion to the story-arc more than a decade later. Written by Roger Stern and designed by John Romita Jr, the character has an enduring reputation in Spider-Man fandom of a certain vintage.\n\nBut before the Hobgoblin there was the Green Goblin.\n\nTHE GOBLIN SHAPED HOLE\n\nI’ve discussed the Green Goblin’s genesis and development before. For the purposes of this post, it’s worth emphasizing a few salient points.\n\nGreen Goblin was the single most frequently appearing villain in Lee-Ditko’s Spider-Man run.\n\nHe was the first villain to discover Spider-Man’s secret identity.\n\nHe was never caught nor defeated until his climactic struggle with Spider-Man in The Night Gwen Stacy Died.\n\nGreen Goblin was the arch-enemy of Spider-Man in being a physical match to Spider-Man, in serving a contrast to Peter Parker’s civilian identity, being cunning and resourceful enough to escape legal punishment which none of his other villains, including Doctor Octopus was able to achieve.\n\nThis fact is clarified in a panel from ASM#18 showing the other rogues reacting in resentment to Goblin’s triumph over humiliating Spider-Man in ASM#17.\n\nSo Goblin was clarified at the top of Peter Parker’s rogues well before the event that cemented his coronation: The Night Gwen Stacy Died, when he killed Gwen, the ostensible love interest of the hero. The nature of that story, the sudden escalation, shocking violence and sadistic glee of Goblin over the death of Gwen meant that he simply had to die and be off the table for good.\n\nBut that created a riddle: what’s a rogues gallery without its arch-nemesis?\n\nTHE PRETENDERS\n\nThe death of the Green Goblin at the end of ASM#122 created a fairly rare situation where the major villain was no longer a serialized threat in the continuity, and the Spider-Man Rogues Gallery in the 20year period of Norman’s “death” in comics was a fairly interesting landscape.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, Gerry Conway introduced a few new villains and threats, including some (like Hammerhead) he had developed a few issues before. Others like Tarantula generated staying power, while the Jackal served as a single-use villain before being buried until his ill-advised revival during the 2nd Clone Saga.\n\nThe “Bronze Age” of Spider-Man is generally characterized with lower-scale villains, characters like Stegron or Rocket Racer, or Hypno Hustler and so on. The use of these lower-scale villains many of whom were lacking in super-strength and so on, is that Spider-Man’s own super-strength and capacity was increasingly reduced to accommodate these smaller scale villains. And as a result, this period is generally lacking in action scenes and sequences of the kind we see in the Ditko and Romita Sr and the Conway eras.\n\nThe Death of the Green Goblin also did not lead to a corresponding elevation for Doctor Octopus or other classic Spider-Man rogues to take up the slack for Goblin. Doctor Octopus didn’t find his reputation enhanced or found ground conceded to him with Goblin’s death and disappearance. His most notable story was a famously cringe story where he tried to marry Aunt May to get access to a nuclear power plant she had suddenly inherited, only to be gatecrashed by Hammerhead. Fighting gang wars with a metal-plated lunkhead like Hammerhead didn’t spell out diabolical mastermind by any means. The same applied to the Vulture, Rhino, Mysterio and others.\n\nThe major new villain introduced in the aftermath of Goblin’s death was Black Cat/Felicia who quickly became a supporting character/love interest.\n\nComplicating all of this, is the successor Green Goblins that entered the fray.\n\nThe first and most famous Goblin successor is Harry Osborn. He became Green Goblin in Gerry Conway’s run in ASM#136.\n\nThe second is Harry Osborn’s psychiatrist Dr. Barton “Bart” Hamilton in ASM#167, who violated the ethics of his profession and hijacked his patient’s alter ego as a means of getting power. His reveal plays as a deadly literal pastiche of Scooby Doo, underscoring how random and forgettable he was.\n\nToday, Harry Osborn has established himself as the most famous of the Goblin “legacies” but it’s important to highlight how recent and contingent this element was.\n\nFor one thing Harry Osborn after becoming Green Goblin in Conway’s run lapsed back into civilian identity in Len Wein’s run and didn’t become a villain again for a full decade of comics publication history. The status Harry now enjoys is down to J. M. Dematteis’ landmark run on The Spectacular Spider-Man with Sal Buscema, which ran in the late-80s to early 90s. But until DeMatteis’ run, the average reader would remember Harry as Peter’s college friend who went through an awkward phase and then married Liz Allan and was mostly a banal supporting character. Harry was not even Best Man at Peter’s wedding (that was Flash Thompson). The Harry Osborn of the Raimi films and the Ultimate Comics and so on is largely a result of J. M. Dematteis’ tragic realization of his character.\n\nAs for Bart Hamilton, well he was also a Goblin. Not much to add beyond that.\n\nHowever him hijacking Harry’s identity signified that many readers had doubts about Harry being Green Goblin. It symbolized the lack of legitimacy that either pretender had. One could put on a Goblin mask, one could even have the last name of Osborn, but that was not enough to be accepted as a replacement to Norman Osborn or fill the Goblin-Shaped Hole left in the rogues gallery.\n\nCRITERIA OF SUITABILITY AND CREDIBILITY\n\nThere’s more to a villain than a costume, a gimmick, and a set of powers, as the saga of the two Goblin pretenders mentioned above confirms. Beyond simply filling the role of the costume, what matters is suitability for one, credibility for another. The ability of characters to perform as supervillains.\n\nNorman Osborn/Green Goblin was symbolic of an American mid-life crisis. That simply cannot be translated and substituted to his far younger son. When you see Norman fighting Peter, there’s a symbolic heft in a captain of industry going against a working-class scholarship guy. Something significantly reduced when you have a rich failson go against his roommate because girls are more turned on by him.\n\nNorman Osborn was an industrialist gifted in science and technology. The significant resources displayed by Green Goblin entirely makes sense. This does not apply to Harry Osborn who was established in the Lee-Ditko and Romita eras as lacking the scientific aptitude of Peter and the determination and follow-through of his father.\n\nIn addition to being a scientist and an older man, Norman was also a criminal mastermind and ruthless power player. Someone like Norman makes perfect sense as an underworld aspirant in the way that Harry Osborn, leave alone Bart Hamilton doesn’t.\n\nIn short when Harry Osborn became Green Goblin in Conway’s run and suddenly “leveled up” from failson tripping on LSD to effective Goblin successor, there was very little character connection to make that leap. It was simply a case of Harry taking the evil pills and being effective because he’s a bad guy and that automatically makes one productive. The character turn might have been done better over time but the problem remained that Harry Osborn lacked suitability and credibility. He was convincing as Peter’s tragic and troubled friend, which is how DeMatteis realized him, but he was not convincing as a lasting replacement for Goblin.\n\nIn general, the major problem with Spider-Man Rogues after the Lee-Ditko and Romita era, is the failure of most new villains to meet the criteria of suitability and credibility.\n\nLet me define that more specifically, by saying:\n\nA character is suitable as a supervillain when their personality/background/situation is illustrated by their turn to villainy. This turn need not be intentional, it might be accidental, but either case a basic character arc/dimension becomes sensible through their new aspect.\n\nA character is credible as a supervillain when their actions as a supervillain cohere with their background. It makes sense that they can do the things they can do.\n\nIn most cases, when we discuss these criteria we are talking about something consolidated over time rather than something inherent to the character’s foundation.\n\nThe Joker’s credibility and suitability wavered over a long period of time, and as discussed here, it was only with O’Neill/Adams that the character became legible in his current form as Batman’s ultimate enemy with every aspect of his gimmick, personality, and unpredictability linked together.\n\nIn the case of Spider-Man rogues, except for the Green Goblin and Lizard/Curt Connors, most of the classic rogues didn’t have their origins/motivations/backstory fleshed out until decades later. The Vulture didn’t get a backstory until the 1980s and Doctor Octopus didn’t get one till the 90s. The same applies to other villains.\n\nIn general the success of a supervillain’s visual design/concept precedes their narrative conception. Doctor Octopus was already an impressive and compelling physical threat and cool supervillain before the backstory of the 90s (a backstory that’s arguably proven more subtractive to his appeal, but that’s for another day). Same with many of the classic Ditko rogues and some of the villains afterwards (Kingpin, Rhino, Shocker) who’ve had some amount of staying power. At the same time, the nature of the design is not something that can be transferred and inhabited by a legacy.\n\nThere’s a weird alchemy that exists with a villain’s design and we can highlight this by looking at a failed villain.\n\nFAILED VILLAIN DESIGN 101: MILES WARREN/THE JACKAL\n\nDesignating The Jackal as a “failed villain” might be subjective but I think that a character who, having appeared in the mid-70s, subsequently spending 20 years missing in a vastly improved publication history, who was only ever adapted in a critically derided animated adaptation from 2018, — can be considered a failure (his civilian alter-ego Miles Warren did appear in a sinister supporting turn in Greg Weisman’s Spectacular Spider-Man) . The Jackal has always had an air or opprobrium to him as a character owing to his association in The 2nd Clone Saga of the 90s, and he’s rarely attracted any real attention outside Spider-Man comics readers who for the most part are not clamoring for greater representation on his behalf the way Superman fans are waiting patiently for Brainiac and Mr. Mxyzsptlk to take center stage after enduring 6 movies of the Luthor-Zod dyarchy.\n\nThe Jackal first appeared in Amazing Spider-Man#129 as a “mystery villain” in the vein of Green Goblin. Someone who sends The Punisher (also his first appearance) to assassinate Spider-Man. He appeared semi-regularly until the story now called “The First Clone Saga” (ASM#143-149). In the course of the climax of that story, Jackal was revealed as Dr. Miles Warren, a background character (i.e. college instructor at ESU for Peter’s class) who had merely occupied space but never developed any kind of personality in that time. Jackal also died in the course of that story and he remained dead until the 90s.\n\nThe problems with the Jackal are numerous:\n\nOn a basic fundamental level, the Jackal is a visually uninspired character. His character design as an ugly gremlin in a loincloth looks thoroughly out of place in Spider-Man. It looks like a woodland fantasy enemy rather than a mad scientist. Steve Ditko’s Spider-Man villain designs always had an element of science-fiction. Norman Osborn was the Green Goblin but he rode a glider and carried gadgets. The Lizard wore a labcoat, The Sandman was always a man-element hybrid, Electro likewise rocked a costume. The core Ditko design philosophy in his Spider-Man comics was science-fiction and there’s nothing science-fiction looking about Jackal on a visual level. If the character was called The Gremlin perhaps it might work, since gremlins are a modern folklore being credited with sabotaging planes during World War II, and Warren’s interference in Peter’s life has looser sense in that regard. Something both folkloric but tied to technology. Of course Gremlin sounds too much like Goblin as it is, but then again Batman has many rogues and sub-villains based on Alice in Wonderland (Mad Hatter, Tweedlee and Tweedledum, Humpty Dumpty).\n\nThe obvious point about Jackal that most anyone brings up is that he doesn’t actually look like a jackal at all. It’s not clear to me why Gerry Conway normally sharp on such matters (i.e. Hammerhead the gangster looks/moves exactly how you’d presume a human non-aquatic shark equivalent would look like) made him non-jackal looking with no thematic connection to Jackals on any conceivable level. There’s a great value in naming a character and the ability of characters to own their names and moniker is vital for their sustainability. Jackals are brown-haired animals to start with, and somehow a green-hued gremlin-looking being is called on to claim its totem.\n\nLeaving aside the unsuitability of the name and the visual design, there’s the gimmick. Jackal is associated with human cloning. When someone imagines human cloning, the setting involves science laboratories, secret underground bases, and incubation tubes of the kind we see in The Matrix. From first glancing at Jackal, he doesn’t exactly spell out cloning at all. In fact if one were to read his appearances in the Conway run, him being a cloning guy comes a bit out of nowhere. Compare this to Green Goblin or Doctor Octopus, before we know anything about their identities and backgrounds their “gimmicks” (i.e. glider bombing, mechanical arms mashing) make total sense.\n\nThen we have the mystery reveal that a background professor at Peter’s college was the villain all along. This mystery lands on the level of “the butler did it”, it’s unexpected but emotionally negligible. Warren never registered as a significant supporting character for his turn to villainy to raise stakes nor does it add any retrospective filter and nuance to his earlier appearances.\n\nAbove all, Miles Warren being the Jackal raises the major issue of credibility. To the extent human cloning is conceivable, it’s not believable that a career instructor at ESU would suddenly develop the process in a short interval after the death of a coed he had a decidedly inappropriate fixation on. The backstory that justified this claim, such as being randomly connected to the higher-profile High Evolutionary feels too random and forced. A character has been made effective and capable by authorial fiat without any of the scaffolding to make that leap.\n\nSo the Jackal is an example of a supervillain who fails to perform on any metric one can rate a villain, i.e. Visual Design/Suitability/Credibility. It’s not suitable for a Jackal to look like a Gremlin, or for it to be attached to the gimmick of human cloning, and it’s not credible that the secret identity behind Jackal be an ESU instructor who develops cloning out of a misplaced grief over the death of one of his students who he had a Humbert Humbert fixation on.\n\nThe Jackal is the weakest designed of Spider-Man villains. And it’s not surprising that he was left dead and missing for 20 years until his ill-advised revival in the 2nd Clone Saga. No attempt was made to serialize him or give him a legacy, nor was there any significant demand for him in the halcyon period of his 20 year absence which, not coincidentally, is Spider-Man’s most consistent and popular period in publication history.\n\nThe Jackal is an obvious failure, having never sustained any real popularity or fame. Less obvious by comparison is The Hobgoblin. The question over the Hobgoblin has never been about popularity because he was indeed a popular figure among Spider-Man readers of the mid-80s, and versions of him have appeared in other contexts. The issue with Hobgoblin has always been a question over execution rather than conception, whereas in the case of Jackal, there are few defenders against the weaknesses of the character’s conceptions.\n\nI’d like to argue that the Hobgoblin was in fact weak in conception and that the problems of the character were inherent to story decisions made by the writer/artist team who created him.\n\nA FOOLISH CONSISTENCY\n\nRoger Stern began writing Spider-Man first in the pages of The Spectacular Spider-Man before starting a run on The Amazing Spider-Man between 1981-1984.\n\nStern’s run on Spider-Man is considered one of the high points in the title’s publication history. It was a run of great versatility and variety in storytelling, something covered in my deep-dive on one of his quieter issues. The most immediately notable and striking aspects of Stern’s run on Amazing Spider-Man was the action in the comics took a huge spike in quality.\n\nBefore Stern, Spider-Man had become something of a wimp. The low-point was Marv Wolfman’s ASM#197 showing Kingpin, a putatively non-powered gangster manhandle a superhero with super-strength.\n\nStern sought to re-emphasise Spider-Man’s capability and he did that by having him fight villains outside his rogues gallery. Having Spider-Man fight, solo, villains like The Juggernaut, the Mad Thinker, Mr. Hyde who were Avengers/X-Men/Fantastic Four team villains immediately made him a more impressive solo superhero and brought attention to his incredible super-strength.\n\nFrank Miller once claimed, allegedly, that he “gave Batman his balls back” with Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, and while Stern isn’t as macho a type to make that claim, he deserves great credit to putting “the Man” back in Spider-Man by pitching him in increasingly tougher fights against villains outside his weight class, and driving up his super strength after it had been neglected since the Ditko years. The execution was similarly high with the two-part Juggernaut story – “Nothing Can Stop the Juggernaut” being one of the best and most intense fights in superhero comics ever rendered in panel and balloon. Stern generally avoided Spider-Man’s classic rogues gallery during his run with the exception of Adrian Toomes/The Vulture who Stern had a fondness for. Eventually, Stern set his sights on developing a new villain for Spider-Man, dubbed the Hobgoblin, who first made his appearance in Amazing Spider-Man #238.\n\nThe Hobgoblin like goblins derived from fairy tale motifs, and in an American context is immortalized in Ralph Waldo Emerson’s famous quote, “A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines.” One thing that can’t be denied about the Hobgoblin is that he definitely lacks consistency, foolish or otherwise.\n\nStern intended Hobgoblin to be a permanent replacement for Norman Osborn/Green Goblin identifying the weaknesses of earlier pretenders:\n\nAnd at the time, the Green Goblin – the real Green Goblin – was dead. Harry Osborn was never really the Green Goblin to me. Harry’d had a drug-induced psychotic episode and just thought he was the Goblin. He didn’t have the Goblin’s great strength. (That, alas, came later. Poor Harry.) Harry’s shrink, Bart Hamilton, was just another pretender. And I never considered a resurrection.\n\nThe Hobgoblin was my solution to the Goblin question. I’d introduce a new villain who had stolen some the Goblin’s gear and concocted a new identity.\n\nRoger Stern. Interview with George Khoury.\n\n[1]\n\nAs Stern says here, he felt that the Hobgoblin might earn credibility by being introduced and set up in a manner that echoed Green Goblin’s original introduction. Green Goblin was introduced with his identity unknown. Same with Hobgoblin. Green Goblin sought to control the criminal underworld. Hobgoblin likewise indulged in behind-the-scenes chicanery with his enemies. Green Goblin escaped justice, same with Hobgoblin.\n\nOf course, as is his won’t Stern introduced a major innovation.\n\nWhen Steve Ditko developed the Green Goblin mystery, it was never truly a mystery. There were no false leads, no red herrings, nor did Spider-Man/Peter play a great deal of time obsessing or worrying about the Green Goblin’s secret identity.\n\nWhen Stern wrote Hobgoblin, the young audience had grown up in a Post-Scooby Doo world (debuting in 1969), as well as many other popular mystery and crime movies of the intervening decade such as Chinatown, The Conversation, Blow-Up, so the Hobgoblin mystery had to have the texture of a true mystery, unearthing a web of connections, false directions, reasoned but incorrect suppositions and so on.\n\nCentral to Stern’s approach is to cast a net so wide that virtually anyone could be the Hobgoblin:\n\nI tried to throw in as many red herrings as I could. The only regular members of the Spider-Man cast who absolutely couldn’t have been the Hobgoblin in those first stories were Peter Parker himself and Joe Robertson – because Robbie had been shown with Pete while the mysterious figure who was to become the Hobgoblin was getting the ball rolling.\n\nI had people guessing everyone from J. Jonah Jameson (too out-of-character, but a surprisingly popular choice) to Willie Lumpkin, the FF’s mailman.\n\nRoger Stern. Interview with George Khoury.\n\n[1]\n\nThe result was that Spider-Man comics between 1983 to 1987, i.e. a full five-years was drawn into a spiral of a murder mystery whose wheels spun non-stop.\n\nMURDER MYSTERY PLOTS IN SUPERHERO COMICS\n\nSuperhero stories are often seen as the ultimate super-genre because it can seemingly accommodate all the other genres: humor, romance, drama, tragedy, horror, fantasy, science-fiction. Or at least that’s what its fans would like to believe.\n\nIn practice, there’s reasons to be skeptical because while superhero stories appropriate elements from other genres the end-effect is significantly altered and diluted.\n\nA superhero comic might include elements of horror but the true existential dread and despair one gets from watching Hereditary or Midsommar is impossible to achieve in a superhero story with an eternal non-stop continuity. At most horror elements in superhero stories is especially scary bad guys for the heroes to beat-up, or cool looking monsters and so on. Alan Moore’s Swamp Thing came closer than others but even there the existence of Swampy in the same universe as Superman and Batman cast some hard limits on the mood of the story.\n\nFantasy and Science-Fiction as genres are defined not only by its world building but by its consistently laid down rules. A superhero universe can never have consistently laid down rules because that’s a product of a single writer and visionary and not an eternal baton-passing continuity game. A Philip K. Dick or Tolkien story worked because it had their own rules rather than the rules of Tolkien crossing over into Dick and vice-versa. Whereas in Marvel, Asgard exists with Dr. Strange and Iron Man, the equivalent of Tolkien-esque High Fantasy crossing over into Lovecraft and Asimov-esque tech futurism.\n\nWhen we come to the detective or murder mystery genre, the problem becomes all the more stark in revealing the limitations of the superhero genre. Because the murder mystery is especially strict in its adherence to logic, clearly-established rules, internal consistency. No matter how the story ends, or the methods taken by the writers to reach the end, it must feel to the reader that the ending flows from the set-up, the readers ought to feel that the answer slipped them by through deft literary gamesmanship by the author but not because they’ve been cheated along the way.\n\nIn superhero stories by and large, most murder mysteries or mystery stories across the genre rarely follow this code of gamemanship, since most anything goes, twists are rarely driven by logic or narrative setup. To the extent there have been twists and murder mysteries in a superhero genre, it’s mostly been in standalone stories that have featured non-serialized one-shot characters, where the superhero basically works in the story as a moving POV rather than a character with anything directly at stake in the outcome. :\n\nThe Long Halloween is perhaps the most famous murder mystery in superhero comics over the last three decades. The story involves an anonymous mystery killer who kills people on holidays. Batman investigates the crime and the course of his investigation brings him into contact with other members of his rogues gallery. The machinations behind the murder mystery leads to Harvey Dent’s transformation into Two-Face. The Holiday Killer subplot is a vehicle to tell the meta-continuity story of how Gotham’s non-powered organized crime was replaced by supervillains.\n\nWatchmen by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons revolves around the death of Eddie Blake/Comedian investigated, initially, by Rorschach and NYPD in parallel to each other. The course of the investigation brings Rorschach into contact with former superhero colleagues, as well as a host of other random characters as well as looping backwards and forwards into a series of explanations.\n\nThe murder mystery with the most similarity to the Hobgoblin is perhaps Batman: Hush. You have a new villain machinating and manipulating behind the scenes, several red herrings, and the most prominent suspect was killed before being wrapped up in a manner that didn’t entirely play fair with what was established.\n\nOf the lot, Watchmen is, unsurprisingly, the best murder mystery. It has the obvious advantage in that it’s not dealing with established characters. If one read Watchmen cold (a bit hard now) one can well imagine that say Dan Dreiberg was the ‘mask killer’ around issue 4 or that Rorschach being unbalanced might have been the “masked killer” himself in a psychotic episode. The fact that Watchmen lacks thought balloons, and only selectively gives highly mediated insight into character’s thought processes might lead that on, in theory. The reveal that follows played fair: it’s logical, grounded, and entirely satisfying on re-reads.\n\nThis doesn’t apply at all to the two Batman mysteries, where given that the stories are grounded in established DC Comics lore, that means that the villain cannot be long-term characters such as Gordon, Alfred, Robin. Nor can one expect Bruce, even hypnotized against his will, to be made a killer. Nothing can happen that can damage the long-term viability of the significant serialized characters. So the focus shifts to a) Established Villains, B) Privileged new characters.\n\nOften times, the murder mystery is secondary. The Long Halloween is about the downfall of Harvey Dent and he’s essentially the protagonist of that story and the murder mystery becomes a secondary concern near the end, a fact confirmed by an incoherent late-act twist that tries to tie the murder mystery to Harvey’s story. The murder mystery is admittedly more central to Batman:Hush but even then the real appeal becomes the Bruce/Selina romance, the first instance in Post-Crisis continuity this plotline was properly incorporated and the Hush story’s moment-to-moment red herrings and asides (including a tease of Jason Todd’s resurrections) proved more long-lasting than the actual story’s denouement.\n\nMARVEL MURDER MYSTERIES\n\nI’ve focused on murder mysteries from examples published by DC Comics. In general, and this is purely my observation, I’ve found more examples of murder mystery stories in serial continuity among DC Comics stories than Marvel stories.\n\nThis has nothing to do with DC being Detective Comics of course. The fact is that the DC being cobbled together from standalone works which originated in separate siloed continuities (i.e. Batman and Superman were never conceived at the outset to exist in the same universe) means that individual titles have a density to it that allows one to tell standalone stories inside it.\n\nMarvel being famously created as a shared continuity means that it thrives on interactions, encounters, crossovers. As such while individual titles, and individual stories, have an integrity that can exist without any familiarity on readers part with wider happenings, the overall tendency is stories driven by character conflict rather than plot.\n\nTo the extent you have pure murder mysteries in Marvel, it’s on the order of standalone titles or selected story-arcs such as the Sin Eater in The Death of Jean DeWolff and even then that lacks a true murder mystery resolution i.e. the Detective actually solving the crime and unmasking the criminal. In that story Daredevil and Spider-Man stumble on to the secret randomly after seemingly capturing a red herring.\n\nThere’s no collating of data, no personal insight leading directly to the reveal unlike Dan Dreiberg guessing Veidt’s password in Watchmen #10. The revelation of Stan Carter, Spider-Man’s seeming ally as a serial killer is meant as a melodramatic trigger for Spider-Man and Daredevil’s character, but it’s not driven by any agency or intellectual insight from them into their situation. The great thrill of any murder mystery is always watching the character’s intellect at work, watching the gears turning and falling into place, and I have almost never come across a Marvel story in any title with that sensation.\n\nI can’t think of other pure examples of murder mysteries in Marvel Comics. The structure of the Marvel stories almost always ends on a big battle or conflict between villain and hero and to the extent there are twists and turns, it’s on the level of melodramatic triggers.\n\nIf one were to allegorize the different approaches between DC and Marvel to murder mysteries, one can say DC is Dan Dreiberg i.e. careful, intellectual, measured but in the process, maybe a bit boring and dry to follow. Whereas Marvel is Rorschach, stumbling in the dark making wild leaps and randomly causing a mess until they land themselves in the finale. The latter makes for more entertaining characterization (in the more neutral sense) while the former is closer to actual detective work.\n\nSo how does the Hobgoblin fit in this schema?\n\nTHE UNSEEN PROTAGONIST\n\nRe-reading the original Roger Stern Hobgoblin mystery (collected in a single TPB volume: Origin of the Hobgoblin featuring specific issues between ASM#238-251 alongside material from Stern’s The Spectacular Spider-Man) is fascinating for how it puts the finger on these problems outlined above, namely designing a supervillain rogue with suitability and credibility, and doing an effective murder mystery.\n\nThe most unusual thing about the Roger Stern Hobgoblin mystery is that the way the story is done the protagonist is in fact the Hobgoblin himself. We never see his face or know his name but we see the Hobgoblin in shadows and in secret. We as readers are privy to Hobgoblin’s goals and desires.\n\nIn the first few issues, Hobgoblin gains access to Green Goblin’s tech by discovering an old hideout through a criminal associate named Georgie Hill. then he designs a new costume and takes to gliding the skies. Hobgoblin then gets into a fight with Spider-Man and loses. He then plots to get access to the Goblin serum to gain Norman’s super-strength.\n\nIn effect, the protagonist of the Hobgoblin-centered stories is Hobgoblin, an unseen protagonist whose machinations, goals, drives, inner thoughts the reader is privy too. This gives a different texture to these stories than the original Green Goblin mystery. In those stories by Lee-Ditko, sure there were moments we were privy to Goblin with his face shaded, and we know his thought processes. But his inner drives and motivations were never so overly individualized as with Hobgoblin whose drive and yearning for power and triumphing over Spider-Man was something readers were asked to share every step of the way.\n\nThis individualization of Hobgoblin is more apparent in Stern’s run than in Defalco-Frenz’s follow-up where Hobgoblin(s) are not disproportionately given focus. The result of this kind of storytelling is that we as readers are made to identify with the machinations and manipulations of Hobgoblin more than with the hero, Spider-Man’s, attempt to stop him. We identify with the author’s cleverness at the expense of the narrative momentum.\n\nThe Hobgoblin is a villain we see grow into his role and slowly escalate along the way. We see him discover the Green Goblin’s hideout, his stash, and then design his costume, and then fight Spider-Man, manipulate villains and so on and so forth. The thrill of the stories that Stern wrote was the gradual escalation. Every new encounter between Spider-Man and Hobgoblin promised to up the stakes, Spider-Man won the first time with his super-strength, leading Hobgoblin to delay until he got the Goblin formula. The second time, a super-strong Hobgoblin wins. The time after that Spider-Man stops holding back and leads to an encounter the Hobgoblin barely survives.\n\nRoger Stern stepped down from writing Spider-Man before he resolved the Hobgoblin mystery. And most agree the Hobgoblin mystery lost its engine when he stepped down. In terms of specific story choices, the loss of that escalating tension and upping-the-ante by Defalco/Frenz contributed heavily to that. At the same time, said tension cannot be maintained forever. The escalation has a logical and proximate endpoint, spinning the wheels inevitably diluted the tension and the end result is that during the Defalco/Frenz run, the Hobgoblin mystery was something that happened in the background. The best issues of the run are standalone and non-serialized one or two-parters. Today ASM#259 is remembered for fully outlining Mary Jane’s backstory, but only by reading the actual comic do you realize that it’s sandwiched by serialized asides dealing with Hobgoblin’s shenanigans that is so far apart from the heart and soul of the comic.\n\nThe Hobgoblin had an interest when he was an unseen protagonist in Stern’s run. Less so, when that element was missing.\n\nTHE HOBGOBLIN DRAGNET\n\nRe-reading the Hobgoblin stories by Stern, it’s a bit baffling to me why this story is ranked as Stern’s “unfinished masterpiece” or his signature story when it’s so bereft of the strengths and virtues of Stern’s finest stories (Nothing Can Stop the Juggernaut, The Kid Who Collects Spider-Man, The Daydreamers). I don’t think Stern, in his ’80s ASM run at least, wrote a single bad issue so even the Hobgoblin stories have moments of interest, and technically are good issues. But when we talk of Roger Stern, we are talking about insightful humanistic characterization, believable and grounded action scenes, smart dialogue and the Hobgoblin stories are generally missing all of that. The baroque murder mystery trappings simply doesn’t suit the author’s strengths.\n\nThe essential problem with the Hobgoblin Mystery is that by making Hobgoblin the unseen protagonist, Spider-Man/Peter plays a largely reactive role in these stories.\n\nThe protagonist of the murder mystery is nominally the detective and that’s the case in the Batman mysteries and Watchmen, and also in The Death of Jean DeWolff. But Spider-Man is simply not playing the detective in The Hobgoblin Saga. He doesn’t investigate leads or pick apart threads. When Stern wrote his 90s salvage miniseries Hobgoblin Lives, he made Betty the investigator character while, Spider-Man’s wife Mary Jane Watson is the one who gives the “Eureka” moment that highlights the problem with the “Ned Leeds” twist at the tail end of the saga.\n\nThe Hobgoblin being the unseen agent/protagonist of the story means that the Hobgoblin Saga is largely concerned with Spider-Man “worldbuilding” so it’s about the fact that it was mentioned in the classic comics that Green Goblin built hideouts, built bases and had gadgets. So Stern tries to tap into that and build on that world-building and connections. And those details are quite fun to follow, since it was Stern who through the interlocutor of Hobgoblin, really established Norman Osborn’s genius-scientist credentials.\n\nThe main problem with a story revolving around worldbuilding is that it yields very little human interest. Since the story revolves around a currently dead supervillain and his legacy, its wrapped up in continuity, and plot happenings from older comics. There’s none of the humanistic and psychological insight you get in Stern’s best stories. The most interesting showing of the Hobgoblin is when he tries to blackmail important businessmen and other figures at the same Gentlemen’s Club that Norman and Jonah met during the Crime Master Saga. There’s interesting character elements such as Jonah revealing his involvement with the Scorpion rather than subscribe to the blackmail, Harry Osborn (in civilian mode) internalizing his guilt over his father’s actions in killing Gwen Stacy but again it’s tangential stuff around Hobgoblin that’s developing interest.\n\nThe Hobgoblin stories even during Stern’s run has the weaknesses of the murder mystery existing in the superhero story.\n\nThe mere fact that the Hobgoblin was an ongoing serialized story arc that could be picked up with intermediary stories in-between meant that you couldn’t do anything that could rupture or damage existing supporting characters. An actual murder story concentrated in a single 6-issue story would not have had to deal with this problem. But it’s an issue when the threads are scattered and picked up inside a holding pattern. Imagine a Sherlock Holmes story where in the middle of investigating one case, Holmes and Watson then decide to do a random mystery side-quest, and you’d get the idea.\n\nSo the solution to the Hobgoblin mystery by necessity had to involve entirely new characters who had to be introduced and spotlighted, and carefully foregrounded so that them being the villain is a surprise but not obvious.\n\nBELLADONNA OF SADNESS\n\nAt this late stage, it’s not much of a spoiler to note that Roderick Kingsley is the Hobgoblin, and was the designated culprit by Roger Stern.\n\nRoderick Kingsley appeared as a minor character in The Spectacular Spider-Man #43 (Vol. 1) published in 1980. Roger Stern worked on the satellite title before migrating to Amazing Spider-Man in 1981. The Hobgoblin first appeared in Amazing Spider-Man#238 in 1983, two years later.\n\nThe important thing to emphasize about the Hobgoblin:\n\nWhen Stern first created Hobgoblin, in his very first issue (#238), he did not write the character with Kingsley as the culprit in mind.\n\nWhen Stern first created Roderick Kingsley, it wasn’t done with the aim of him becoming a supervillain or a capable criminal eventually.\n\nRoderick Kingsley has enjoyed a cult in some corners of Spider-Man fandom. Part of this is out of the common fan sentimentality of Kingsley as Stern’s intended candidate as The Hobgoblin, and so he’s become a symbol of creator intent and a story straying from original intentions to disastrous results. Such an attitude isn’t unwarranted and ideally the Hobgoblin mystery would have worked better had Stern stayed on the title and Kingsley been unveiled in the 1980s itself. But sentimentality is no substitute for critical reading, nor is it a good way of evaluating whether Stern’s stories built the foundation for the reveal to work the way it did, or if Stern’s writing style was up to the challenge of making such a concept work?\n\nMy contention is that Roderick Kingsley while a better conceived character than Miles Warren/Jackal is nonetheless beset with the same problems of a lack of suitability and credibility. This is probably a controversial assertion given Mr. Kingsley’s greater, and to me inexplicable, popularity among Spider-Man fans but I feel confident about my reasons for stating so.\n\nThe first and foremost thing is that Kingsley in his debut issue doesn’t come across as an impressive figure. He’s a fashion designer who is targeted by a supervillain called Belladonna and her flunkies. Spider-Man decides to take an interest and he unearths the fact that Kingsley is a plagiarist who stole designs and drove a company out of business. Spider-Man saves Kingsley and the only hint we get of his future personality is when Kingsley mocks Spider-Man for interfering when he could have finagled out of this problem through legal chicanery. Spider-Man gets irritated enough, that he leaves him webbed out in the New York cold air, left in stocks, until the web thaws out.\n\nIn follow-up issues we learn a bit more about the villain Belladonna. Namely she’s a cunning supervillain who has a twin sister whose identity she hijacks and which she uses to throw off Spider-Man who investigates Belladonna’s secret identity. The Belladonna secret mystery ultimately doesn’t get solved though any direct investigation either. Kingsley shows up in the background in other issues in The Spectacular Spider-Man as a background character without any hint that he’s set up to be major villain.\n\nRe-reading these issues, it’s pretty clear that Belladonna is the “blueprint” for Hobgoblin. She’s the manipulative figure who uses her twin sister as a decoy to hide her identity and throw off the law and she gets undone when her intricate machinations get undone. A lot of the intricate shenanigans in the Hobgoblin stories play out on a small scale in these stories. We see Stern use elements of the mystery plot, the red herring, and bait and switch, which he repeated in a more baroque fashion in the course of his run.\n\nFASHION BEAST\n\nThe best supervillains have a thematic weight to them. The Joker for instance as a character riffs on stuff like the line between horror and comedy, showbusiness and crime, and so on. Poison Ivy has an eco-feminist theme, albeit played to varying degrees of efficiency over the years, Two Face represents the double side of the justice system and the nature of politics in the age of mass media. In general, Marvel Comics villains don’t quite have the same thematic connections, though it does exist in some cases. Someone like Magneto is obviously representative of the magnetic nature of charisma and ideology. Visually, Doom’s costume which combines the monk’s hood, with the knight’s armor, and the Renaissane Prince’s cape and clasps befits Europe’s medieval and feudal past combined with its scientific mastery and hegemony.\n\nSpider-Man villains as a rule waver in terms of thematic complexity and ideology. Since so much of the story is centered around Peter’s personal life and his supporting cast, the villains as a rule are not complex characters in general, and certainly never as complex as the hero and his supporting players. Thematically, Norman Osborn/Green Goblin is the densest of the rogues. Behind him, Kraven the Hunter only ever achieved complexity in one great story and nowhere else. The rest of the villains don’t have much to compare. An electrician called Max Dillon becoming Electro is a kind of plug-and-play metaphor, presuming that one’s job makes them a supervillain version of the job.\n\nIn the case of Roderick Kingsley and Belladonna, on paper, the original version had promise. Kingsley for instance typifies and represents the world of fashion, and certainly an evil plagiarist is a villain that comics publications could use more of.Instead, for reasons that don’t make sense to me, Stern chose to reinterpret Kingsley as a “mastermind” and “gangster” in complete opposition to how he was originally introduced.\n\nA number of Hobgoblin apologists have advanced the claim that the Hobgoblin outfit is better than Ditko’s original Green Goblin outfit. This is purely subjective, and one I disagree with. I will point out that the Hobgoblin outfit is a rip-off of Etrigan the Demon’s costume, which is also a ripoff in turn.\n\nThey have also applied a bit of cleverness to argue that Kingsley’s fashion design background reveals itself in his update of costume. Except, Kingsley was originally a plagiarist. He did not design anything but stole from his betters. At heart, he’s a person incapable of talent.\n\nWhen we first saw Kingsley, he was a reedy sleazebag who got humiliated by Spider-Man and nearly killed by Belladonna. It’s not beyond the realm of possibility that he could have evolved into a more capable villain. But the fact is no scaffolding was ever done to meaningfully set it up.\n\nWhen Kingsley, covered in shadows, shows up in the Hobgoblin’s debut issue he’s framed as a more impressive figure. He’s presented as an intimidating acquaintance of Georgie Hill, someone at home in the noir setting of back alleys. There’s no grounds for this change in how Kingsley originally appeared. Kingsley, who was afraid of being in the cold for 15mins outside winter season in his first appearance is suddenly a crimelord who can bomb partners in crime.\n\nThe main point Stern said in interviews and has Kingsley remark in-universe, is that Hobgoblin is an advance over Norman Osborn because he’s not insane. This attempt to present “insanity” in comic book terms has obvious weaknesses in its argument, and even then Kingsley’s actions as Hobgoblin do not register as the actions of a sane man. Decrying Norman Osborn for using his inventions for supervillainy while using his equipment to become another would be supervillain while also mimicking the original Ditko-era Goblin scheme of taking over the underworld doesn’t make too much sense. It’s a case of a villain ventriloquizing ideas more than representing it. Tell rather than show. Roderick as a cold-blooded amoral plagiarist who stabs everyone and everything in the back, victimizes his own brother, actually registers as more purely sociopathic than Norman, having a motiveless malignity about his criminal actions whereas Norman’s actions are metaphorical expressions of a mid-life crisis.\n\nHobgoblin’s true identity was originally designed by Stern to be a cipher, a blank that was filled in retroactively to be Kingsley because Stern felt that the character voice of the Hobgoblin was similar to to Kingsley’s. Textually, I can’t trace any similarities and I think Stern conflated Belladonna with Kingsley. It’s Belladonna who is remade into the Hobgoblin but with the hapless Kingsley taking her place as Hobgoblin. It’s a bit like watching someone make Ferris Boyle into Mr. Freeze in a new Batman cartoon, rather than the character who had the most thematic claim and fit to the role.\n\nMISSED CHANCES\n\nRe-reading the Hobgoblin Saga in both the Stern and Defalco eras and later runs is interesting but frustrating because the makings of an interesting story exist but don’t cohere together in both periods.\n\nStern stepped off the pedal and he only delivered outlines of his final issues for Defalco and Ron Frenz to doll up. As such, ASM#251 which has one of the greatest white knuckle action scenes, represents a true meeting of the minds. We see Hobgoblin drive one of Norman Osborn’s discarded prototypes, a “Battle-Van” that looks like a cross between the Ghostbusters ambulance and the Batmobile while Spider-Man chases him and lands on top. The fight between the two combatants is thrillingly done and this is the absolute high point of the Hobgoblin. It never gets as good as it does in this issue, all the way to the present.\n\nThe Defalco/Frenz run consolidates plot and story developments from Stern’s run while also incorporating the alien costume from Secret Wars 1984. The Hobgoblin, per Defalco and Frenz, wasn’t going to be Kingsley in their rendition but rather the alter ego of a new villain called The Rose, who is later revealed to be Kingpin’s son. Story-wise, Hobgoblin being an underworld princeling makes more sense with the Noir introduction of the character in ASM#238 than a plagiarist fashion designer. Still the Hobgoblin remained somewhat disconnected and vague. The delay of his mystery killed tension and urgency, and Spider-Man remained unconnected from the investigation. He wasn’t the detective protagonist but a mere onlooker in his own narrative. The mystery was waiting in line to be exhausted before Spider-Man could know the secret.\n\nRoderick Kingsley, or at least a version of him, existed as a supporting character but he now showed up as Mary Jane’s boss. Defalco/Frenz introduced the idea of Mary Jane being an entry level model where she worked for Kingsley’s label. In other words Kingsley finally managed a credible and organic connection with Peter Parker but that happened after Defalco/Frenz made the decision to no longer make him the Hobgoblin. A particularly interesting issue, Spectacular Spider-Man #116, written by Peter A. David, shows Peter overdue for his bills, only to find out that MJ covered him for the month using her check from Kingsley’s payroll. In other words, Kingsley unintentionally paid Spider-Man’s rent.\n\nKingsley might have been an effective supervillain, a fashion world Mysterio, if the decision wasn’t made to make him a successor to Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. The latter required a scaling up beyond his meager scale, boots too large for him. Even then it might have worked had the scaffolding established the links between the two versions. The later retcons that Kingsley had a twin brother Daniel, and that any appearance of Roderick as somewhat vulnerable is down to the twin in Roderick’s shoes, is plainly a steal from Belladonna, and even then is melodramatically cliche.\n\nHad the Hobgoblin threaded itself organically into Peter’s milieu, such as Mary Jane’s fashion work, it would have worked better. Instead, the character is tied up to underworld shenanigans which can never achieve any true value in a Spider-Man comic as opposed to the Noir flavored world of Daredevil, where the criminal underworld and its existence casts an appropriately serious mood that can never be truly sustained in the pages of Spider-Man for an extended period.\n\nIn the end it came to naught. Defalco/Frenz were fired unceremoniously and replaced by Jim Owsley/Christopher Priest for a brief run until he too was fired. The drama around that is worth exploring individually later since there are so many conflicitng accounts. What isn’t in dispute is that Owsley decided that the Hobgoblin was in fact Ned Leeds. He then decided to kill off Ned Leeds in a one-shot story Spider-Man V. Wolverine #1 and then ordered Peter A. David to wirte the conclusion of the Gang War storyline explainng that Ned Leeds was the Hobgoblin conveyed in flashback while Jason Macendale replaced him as a successor/legacy.\n\nThis is one of the all-time great botches in serial superhero storytelling.\n\nNo matter my feelings about the conceptualization and padding of the Hobgoblin story until then, the fact is that a five year long mystery cannot be resolved so anti-climatically. The Hobgoblin Saga spanned more years and issues than the 90s Clone Saga did and you can’t resolve a story of that scale with the culprit randomly murdered off the side pages.\n\nNed Leeds made less sense as the Hobgoblin than either Kingsley or Kingpin Jr. This was a character who dated back to the Steve Ditko run of two decades prior. To have him become a murdering gangster all of a sudden has no foundation anywhere. Furthermore, where’s the drama? Ned Leeds at this point was a peripheral figure in Peter’s life. Not as close a male friend as Flash or Harry, not as close to Peter among the Bugle cast as Robbie Robertson. Peter had no interest in Betty Brant at this point with his love triangle in the 80s pivoting between Mary Jane and Black Cat. What does Ned being the Hobgoblin add to the story, exactly?\n\nThe death of Ned Leeds was botched, the decision behind it as a resolution to a five year murder mystery plotline that left everyone (fans, readers, editors) plainly bored, is no excuse for poor execution and a poor reward to the investment of readers who followed the story until then. The only value for this plotline is apparently the actor Jacob Batalon campaigning to be Hobgoblin in the hope for better pay and residuals as an IP character. In the 90s, Roger Stern revived and resolved the long forgotten Hobgoblin mystery in his miniseries Hobgoblin Lives. The art by Ron Frenz is good and the character work is effective but it’s far from Stern’s best work and a signal of his artistic decline in the mid-to-late 90s. The revival of Norman Osborn as the Green Goblin rendered Hobgoblin’s original purpose moot and today the character exists as a kind of nostalgia token among fansites rather than as character of true value.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nI suspect some fans might take issue with the negative coloring towards Hobgoblin in this article. I feel that fans have gotten too comfortable explaining the happenings of the Marvel Universe without asking what’s at stake critically. When in fact the mangled, botched, and unresolved nature of the Hobgoblin mystery, more than anything, reveals how contingent so many happenings in continuity are. It was not inevitable for the Hobgoblin to exist, not inevitable for him to be any single identity, and indeed different writing teams differed which direction to take him in. There existed alternatives at every step of the way. The existence of these alternatives points to the weaknesses in the writing, in his very conception, in the plan to include a murder mystery in a continuity like the Marvel Universe where everything exists as fodder for something else. To pretend as if the Hobgoblin was inherently a unified character, that he’s a capable villain because the narrative asserts he is, is to me a critical folly.\n\nIdeally the Hobgoblin could have worked as the Marvel Universe’s own Zodiac killer. A threatening villain on the periphery that is unresolved. The problem is that in real life the Zodiac was never caught or meaningfully identified. In the Marvel Universe, or in any mainstream superhero comics universe, you can’t have an unsolved mystery. All you have are elements for later writers to play with. Perhaps the Hobgoblin as a future still.\n\nIn a lot of ways he makes sense as a a Miles Morales villain. Roderick Kingsley is even more obviously emblematic of white privilege than Norman Osborn is. Putting a failed Goblin legacy against a successful Spider-Man legacy has a lot of appeal. As a fashion designer who steals ideas from others, Kingsley represents “failing upwards” gatekeeping that can be used to shed light on the sweatshops and the appropriative nature of the fashion industry.\n\nREFERENCES"
