        "text": "#39 - Tenebrae (1982)\n\nMy wonderful wife got me the 4k set of my favorite Dario Argento film and giallo for Christmas last year, so I figured now would be a good time to finally crack it open. And good lord does the movie look just incredible in 4k. I noticed a lot of visual details this time around, the audio and visuals were crisp and clear, and that infamous \"spray\" scene towards the end just popped like I'd never seen before. Tenebrae is one of the very few horror films that I think is nearly flawless in execution. The style, visuals, music, story, pacing, etc. It all comes together so perfectly that I just can't get enough of it with a final act that stays with the viewer long afterwards. Tenebrae isn't a perfect film, but it's the one that I think represents Argento at his absolute best. 10 out of 10.\n\n#40 - City of the Living Dead (1980)\n\nAnother Lucio Fulci gore fest that is still effectively creepy, bizarre, and nonsensical which is just the way I like it. The gore scenes are some of the greatest in horror as Fulci attempts to push whatever gross out buttons the viewer has. Things are explained, but much like The Beyond, this film works far better as if it's thought of being trapped in an endless nightmare scenario with no rules and no expectations other than to sit back and let the gory fun wash all over you. 7 out of 10.\n\n#1 - Saw III (2006)\n\n#2 - Saw IV (2007)\n\n#3 - Saw X (2023) FTV\n\n#4 - Daughters of Darkness (1971) FTV\n\n#5 - Scream (1996)\n\n#6 - Scream 2 (1997) FTV\n\n#7 - Scream 3 (2000) FTV\n\n#8 - Scream 4 (2011) FTV\n\n#9 - Scream (2022) FTV\n\n#10 - Silver Bullet (1985)\n\n#11 - Scream VI (2023) FTV\n\n#12 - M3GAN (2022)\n\n#13 - New York Ripper (1982)\n\n#14 - Summer of 84 (2018) FTV\n\n#15 - Vamp (1986)\n\n#16 - Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey (2023) FTV\n\n#17 - Deadstream (2022)\n\n#18 - Phenomena (1985)\n\n#19 - Malignant (2021)\n\n#20 - An American Werewolf in Paris (1997) FTV\n\n#21 - V/H/S 85 (2023) FTV\n\n#22 - You'll Never Find Me (2023) FTV\n\n#23 - Sleep (2023) FTV\n\n#24 - Never Hike Alone (2017) FTV\n\n#25 - Never Hike Alone 2 (2023) FTV\n\n#26 - Vincent Must Die (2023) FTV\n\n#27 - I Will Never Leave You (2023) FTV\n\n#28 - It's A Wonderful Knife (2023) FTV\n\n#29 - Late Night With The Devil (2023) FTV\n\n#30 - When Evil Lurks (2023) FTV\n\n#31 - Suitable Flesh (2023) FTV\n\n#32 - Dog Soldiers (2002)\n\n#33 - Demons (1985)\n\n#34 - Deep Red (1975)\n\n#35 - Exorcist III (1990)\n\n#36 - The Church (1989)\n\n#37 - Demons 2 (1986)\n\n#38 - All Hallows Eve (2013) FTV\n\n#39 - Tenebrae (1982)\n\n#40 - City of the Living Dead (1980)\n\nSpooktober Batch #2.\n\n#11. The Babadook.\n\nWatched this one back when it came out and watched it during a \"bad horror movie\" evening with a bunch of friends, didn't know anything about the movie and didn't really get most of it. Re-watching it in the right setting this time and it's a damn good and effective movie. 8/10.\n\n#12 . Insidious Chapter 3\n\nBetter than Chapter 2 but that's not saying much, but still pretty enjoyable. 6/10.\n\n#13. Knock at the Cabin.\n\nDave Bautista is fantastic in this and gets to flex his acting cops but the movie is alright. 6.5/10.\n\n#14. Saw 3D\n\nWhile not good and some of the worst looking and acted Saw before X, I still applaud how they commited they are connecting everything. Hoffman is fun to watch. 5/10.\n\n#15. Evil Dead Rise.\n\nMan, the evil Dead series remains just great even with other people on the wheel, some fantastic directing and style in this. 8/10\n\n#16. Insidious The Last Key.\n\nA lot of nonsense that didn't make a lot of sense with a bunch of crineworthy dialogue. 6/10\n\n#17. Veronica.\n\nA spanish posession horror movie that used its budget accordingly, instead of using a bunch of cheap CGI they mainly stuck to effective creepy shadows and effects which made it work. Pretty good overal. 7/10.\n\n#18. Susperia 1977.\n\nWatched this one last year already but wanted to watch it again for the vibes and that Goblin music. 8/10.\n\n#19. The Outwaters.\n\nView: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TJnpWdoccM\n\n#20. Saw X.\n\nWasn't sure what I could expect but this was pretty great! Tobi Bel gets some more screentime, some really whacky places this film goes and the supporting cast's acting wasn't pulled form the street this time around, horrible wigs are back! Had a blast with this one. 8/10.\n\n#21. Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2022.\n\nKind of a Halloween reboot copy but still a fun watch. 7/10.\n\n#22. The Boogyman.\n\nWould have been a cool film if it wasn't \"we get babadook at home\". 6.5/10.\n\nLa Llorona (2019)\n\nHorror Marathon 2023 #24\n\nSome great sizzle in this slow-burn as it steadily draws you into the claustrophobic world of a genocidal Guatemalan dictator whose consequences are finally catching up with him; extremely patient dolly shots and skillful sound design expand and shrink the filmic landscape to varying designs, and the political narrative is really fresh for the genre. Ultimately though, La Llorona turns out to be just sizzle. It builds, and builds, and builds but never fully explores either its characters or its supernatural terror, ending just as things start going. And, honestly, for supernatural revenge torment for monumental injustice I'd say the general gets off pretty damn light.\n\n3/5\n\nWhen a Stranger Calls Back (1993)\n\nHorror Marathon 2023 #25\n\nThe opening act of this is pretty much a pitch perfect self contained exercise in suspense. It's a setup we've seen many times (itself a redux of the original When a Stranger Calls, which I have yet to see) where a babysitter is tormented in an increasingly dangerous situation, but director Fred Walton is so measured with slowly increasing the unease of the situation that even the ultimately expected outcome feels excruciating with its delayed outcome. Repeated shots like close-ups of a locked door, or branches scraping against a window are small touches that greatly add to the anxiety of the sequence as we mentally track potential vulnerabilities throughout the whole thing. You could turn this movie off after the first 20 or so minutes and have a perfect horror short.\n\nFortunately, the movie that follows is quite good too — surprisingly so given the pedigree. It never comes close to the same level of suspense as the opening, but it also doesn't try, since it shifts gears to be more of a combination procedural and fairly delicate examination of trauma by using the older cast members of the first film as anchors to support the young protagonist's current ordeal. Though there's no extended suspense sequence after the first act, there are still some very creepy moments as the unseen stalker plays abusive mind games with his victim, the movie gets much darker than you might expect which gives the danger some real menace, and it's quite atmospheric to boot.\n\nEventually the movie does falter a little by sidelining it protagonist, but even that leads to some very creepy scenes. The real stumbling block, however, unfortunately lies with the antagonist. He's eventually revealed to have a somewhat specious gimmick — it's fine, I think something a bit straighter would have served the material better but I can roll with a creepy pulp element here — but the climax ultimately completely (and I mean completely) shits the bed by stacking an additional gimmick on top of our bad guy that is so ridiculous and unintentionally hilarious that the climax of the film would feel more at home in It's Always Sunny than it does here. Truly the worst kind of own-goal a movie like this could make it's so flabbergastingly stupid. But hey, the rest of the movie is pretty damn good! Just maybe consider stopping it ten minutes before the end if you can handle the mood being irrevocably destroyed.\n\n3.5/5\n\nThe Exorcist III (1990)\n\nHorror Marathon 2023 #26\n\nI admire how bluntly The Exorcist III presents its themes. Early on George C. Scott's religiously conflicted detective Kinderman wonders how God can exist in the face of all the suffering in the world. The film then spends the next 90 or so minutes depicting, or more often (and to great effect) describing acts of incredibly horror and evil, rubbing Kinderman's face in increasingly personal assaults of supernatural degradation. Eventually the demon that occupies Father Karras asks Kinderman if he's helped with with his \"unbelief\". Kinderman's seething rejoinder sums it all up nicely:\n\n\"This I believe in... I believe in death. I believe in disease. I believe in injustice and inhumanity, torture and anger and hate... I believe in murder. I believe in pain. I believe in cruelty and infidelity. I believe in slime and stink and every crawling, putrid thing... every possible ugliness and corruption, you son of a bitch. I believe... in you.\"\n\nKinderman's questioning faith grabs hold of everything he's seen, of evil so monumental that he is forced to admit that there is a greater power at play. It's a belief that is framed through the negative space: the absence of good. It's enough to hold on to and in the opportune moment vanquish his foe and save the soul of his friend. I haven't quite made up my mind if the ending is bleak or uplifting. Like Blatty himself and the rest of the film it's conflicted.\n\nEvery time I watch this movie I appreciate it more. It's still easy to see some of the seams of studio meddling or plot points that don't quite come together, but the craft on display here is exceptional. Rather than Friedkin's documentary like naturalism in The Exorcist, Blatty's film is dreamlike and sepulchral, making atonal choices that enhance the strangeness and dread at every opportunity. Characters speak in florid monologues and pithy remarks but it works here, using them to reveal their innate humanity or evil. So much of the film is dialogue and it's as much of a battleground as any of the setpieces.\n\nBut those setpieces are incredibly effective, some of the best in the genre. The hospital hallway scene is rightfully regarded as the crown jewel, and contains perhaps the best jump scare in all of cinema, but just about all the sequences of horror are hugely effective. Blatty's patient setup with numerous still-life shots set the scene and the guttural and demonic soundscape feels like hell itself is scoring the film, and they all culminate in moments of strangeness that feel all the more sinister for the fact that they cut away before any actual violence is shown. At one point a carving of Christ opens its eyes in horror. Later a statue has its head cut off and replaced with what I think might actually be the Joker's head, and as ridiculous as it sounds it's really, really unsettling in practice. For my money The Exorcist III is unquestionably scarier than the original film, and as great as The Exorcist is, Blatty's oddity plays more to my tastes across the board.\n\n4.5/5\n\nPrevious Movie | Next Movie\n\nPlum's October Horror Marathon - 23rd - Movie 16\n\nScream (1996)\n\nHot damn was this good. I knew about the story. I knew about the fact that it was a parody. I even knew who the killer was. But none of that got in the way of what was one of the most well-written, hilarious, and genuinely riveting horror-comedies I've ever seen. This is parody in top-form, the definition of the rule \"you must first become a master at your craft before you can break the rules.\" In a way, I'm a bit disappointed that I got this before the other Craven film on my list, Elm Street, because even though I know that is a classic, I'm not sure if it can actually live up to this.\n\nSo after that gushing praise, what is so good about this? It's likely been written and said many times before, but the sheer expertise in writing, form and even acting on display here is impeccable. This film takes what is, at heart, an incredibly corny script - one with enough lampshading to fill a DIY store and enough references to fill a Family Guy episode - and heightens it by taking it just seriously enough that it never turns back into actual schlock. Similarly, it's a mean film, yet never a mean-spirited film. Always knowing where exactly to stop and where not to go when it\n\nIt also has some of the most brilliant horror-comedy performances. Courtney Cox and Matthew Lillard, known by me exclusively as their roles as Monica & Shaggy respectively, managed to make me completely forget about those by presenting such fun character-work that's as convincing as it is fun. Neve Campbell's protagonist is truly iconic as well with amazing range. Then there's the myriad of smaller parts, all played perfectly to create a cast of oxymoronic cliches-turned-unique.\n\nWhilst, personally, I didn't feel that being spoiled hurt this film that much, I do think that being unspoiled is a better option, so here's some more thoughts:\n\n...that third act was just perfect. Simply, absolutely perfect. Taking place in a party gone off the rails, the film brilliantly weaves different perspectives and meta-narrative elements throughout. Whilst presenting itself as a typical horror movie massacre, it never fails to surprise. Elements such as the '30 second delay' live video-feed to the diegetic Halloween soundtrack are masterful bits of detail. It, like the rest of the film, is perfectly paced; never lulling you into a sense of false security or horror fatigue.\n\nRegarding the killers, even knowing that Shaggy was one of them (I'd forgotten that the boyfriend was though, which did help), the genuinely amazing performances on display from them both made for a genuinely nerve-wracking final confrontation. Yet, it's one tinged with brilliant satire and some deep cuts into parody. They're as comedic as they are pathetic as they are dangerous, a bit that I can't imagine many other writer-director-actor combinations could have done so well.\n\nOh, and:\n\n\"I thought you were dead.\"\n\n\"I probably should be.\"\n\nIs the funniest thing I've heard in a film all year. Genuinely, it's rare for a comedy to have me burst into laughter, but that had me roaring.\n\nAnd to add on to all that... even the poster itself is far more clever than I thought as, really, it's a lie. Nothing about that poster actually represents the textual reality of the film; it, in fact, deeply misrepresents the characters it shows. Yet, despite that, it that simultaneously represents everything that makes the movie so unique. The subversion of expectations of what a horror should be, whilst keeping to what a horror should be. So is it actually a lie? Yes. But no. Does it matter?\n\nSo, yeah. Whilst 'The Fly', my other favourite of the month, was unique in how tragic and deeply humanist it was, Scream is unique in another way; in being a practically perfect meta-textual and deeply clever parody of a beloved genre.\n\n5/5\n\n31+2 — A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge\n\n(rewatch)\n\nBizarrely enough, this was my first Nightmare movie. I only originally knew about the first one because Simpsons. And I think this one is actually underrated as horror movies go. Yes, it's a sequel to an all-time great, difficult to live up to. But it still holds up quite well in the genre, in my opinion.\n\nI think, more than anything else, it's let down by the opening dream sequence (or all of the dream sequences). They couldn't just ape the original, sure, but what they came up with wasn't scary. It was too much, too many effects, too weird. Plus, Jesse in the initial dream seems nothing like Jesse the character. In the dream, he's like some sort of frightened nerd. The character, on the other hand, whilst he slowly unravels as the movie progresses, is anything but the nerd we see in the beginning. He's fit, athletic, he can dance, he makes friends easily, and he's about to land the absolute best girlfriend in all of horror.\n\nSeriously though, she's doing the research, she's cleaning his room, she's open-minded, she's listening when everyone else thinks he's nuts and she's truly trying to help. Also to get in his pants just a little. But mostly help. She rules.\n\nAnyway, the true first nightmare in this movie is 80s-era high school gym class. Nope nope nope.\n\nI think this achieves some true moments of horror, and Freddy is particularly sinister here. Makeup and creature effects are on-point, particularly during a very gnarly transformation scene. Bonus dude at the party who actually tries to talk Freddy down, nice try bro.\n\nI feel like this also took some influence from The Shining. A couple of music choices, and a particular panning shot of the school gym evoke this feeling.\n\n-Insert obligatory mention of homoerotic subtext here-\n\n31+1 Castle Freak (1995)\n\n(first watch)\n\nIt was between this or a Freddy rewatch…I chose this. I had to immediately look up the production details because this, from the maker of Re-Animator, looked especially cheap and low quality. Made for a tiny budget, direct-to-video in the 90s. Okay then, that explains it. Kind of distracting though.\n\nThe brief moment with the blind daughter learning Italian by repeating sentences describing the colors of various objects was actually kind of heartbreaking. This girl is just trying to live her best life with the shit hand she's been dealt, and nobody around her gets it.\n\nThe cat's crying in this movie was confusing, as we have a new kitten, and I couldn't tell if it was him or the TV. Pretty cat, though, we have an orange girl (we were told this is rare), looks just like him. Oh. Oh no.\n\nI'm actually surprised—impressed, even—at the family drama at work here. Yes, there is a \"castle freak\" to contend with, gore, mutilation, so much wrong and fucked up shit. But there's also a family working through grief and tragedy. While the daughter discovers something real in the castle and nobody believes her (a typical trope), the father is genuinely delusional, unable to cope with his trauma.\n\nThis was a fucked up, but fun watch. Definitely a horror movie by Stuart Gordon.\n\nTwo thoughts:\n\nThis clearly inspired Alien Resurrection, right?\n\nAlso, when it comes to believing that the titular freak exists, or not---that is, when it's a question of evidence--there's something everyone is forgetting. I'll let Dennis explain."
