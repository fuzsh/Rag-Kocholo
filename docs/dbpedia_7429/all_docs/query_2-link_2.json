        "text": "Hobgoblins is a 1988 low-budget horror-comedy B-movie directed, written, and produced by Rick Sloane, who also served as cinematographer and editor. The film is often seen as a rip-off of Gremlins and earned infamy after it was shown on Mystery Science Theater 3000. It has since been often regarded as one of the worst films ever made.\n\nPlot[]\n\nA young security guard must track down diminutive aliens who kill people even as they make their fantasies come true.\n\nCast[]\n\nTom Bartlett as Kevin\n\nPaige Sullivan as Amy\n\nSteven Boggs as Kyle\n\nKelley Palmer as Daphne\n\nBilly Frank as Nick\n\nTamara Clatterbuck as Fantazia\n\nDuane Whitaker as Roadrash\n\nJeffrey Culver as McCreedy\n\nKevin Kildow as Dennis\n\nKari French as Pixie\n\nDaran Norris as Club Scum M.C\n\nJames Mayberry as Sergeant Parker\n\nKen Abraham as Thug\n\nDon Barrett as Comstock\n\nDavid Teague as Lowlife\n\nHome media[]\n\nFirst released on VHS in early 1988.\n\nThe MST3K version of the film was released by Rhino Home Video as part of the Collection, Volume 8 DVD set.\n\nThe original Hobgoblins cast members reunited for the MicroWerks DVD of Hobgoblins and Hobgoblins 2, released June 23, 2009. The 20th Anniversary interviews are given by Tom Bartlett (Kevin), Kelley Palmer (Daphne), Steven Boggs (Kyle), Billy Frank (Nick), Tami Clatterbuck (Fantazia), Daran Norris (Club Scum MC), Kenneth J. Hall (creator of the original Hobgoblin puppets), and Rick Sloane (writer/director).\n\nInfluence[]\n\nHobgoblins is perhaps best known for being shown on episode #907 of Mystery Science Theater 3000. MST3K writer Paul Chaplin later commented on Hobgoblins, saying, \"It shoots right to the top of the list of the worst movies we've ever done.\" Rick Sloane in fact submitted Hobgoblins to the MST3K team himself, and enjoyed the episode enough that he based the theme song to Hobgoblins 2 on a song Mike and the Bots sing during the episode.\n\nTaglines[]\n\nBe careful what you wish for... You just might get it!\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe hobgoblin puppets were operated by a woman who had just been released from a mental hospital.\n\nRick Sloane didn't see the puppets for the hobgoblins until the night prior to the first day of shooting.\n\nSteven Boggs wore his own pink shorts in the movie.\n\nOnly the eyes for the hobgoblins were going to be seen in an earlier draft of the script.\n\nRick Sloane initially planned on making a sequel in 1990 and had even written a screenplay for said sequel.\n\nThe location used for Club Scum was a club in West Los Angeles called The Music Machine.\n\nJohn Carradine was approached to play the old man who owns the movie studio, but his agent asked for too much money.\n\nThe location for the film studio was a parking lot that was deserted at night."
