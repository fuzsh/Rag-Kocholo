        "text": "M-11\n\n[edit]\n\nM-11 is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.\n\nOriginally known as the Human Robot, the character was named \"M-11\" in the 2006 to 2007 Agents of Atlas miniseries as an allusion to its first appearance in Menace #11 from Atlas Comics (Marvel Comics' 1950s predecessor).[1] In an alternate reality from mainstream Earth, a scientist's newly created robot is programmed by the scientist's greedy business manager to murder the scientist. The incomplete robot, however, continues through with his directive to \"kill the man in the room\", and kills the business manager when the man enters. The robot then leaves the house, programmed to \"kill the man in the room\" but ultimately falls off a pier into the sea and short-circuits.[2]\n\nM-11 in other media\n\n[edit]\n\nM-11 appears in Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2 via the \"Agents of Atlas\" DLC pack.[3]\n\nMaa-Gor\n\n[edit]\n\nMaa-Gor is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.\n\nA member of a tribe of Man-Apes from Savage Land.[4] After losing a battle with Ka-Zar, he walks into the mystic mist surrounding Savage Land, which transform him into a superhuman with increased intelligence, and he renames himself Man-God. Later, he returns to the mist and encounters an alien machine which he realize is responsible for his powers. The machine then split him into two; a blue logic part and a red emotional part. The blue is killed by the red, but the machine interacts and fuse them again, turning him into his old Man-Ape self.[5]\n\nGideon Mace\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Gideon Mace\n\nJeffrey Mace\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Jeffrey Mace\n\nJason Macendale\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Jason Macendale\n\nJason Philip Macendale Jr. ([6]) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character first appears in Machine Man #19 (Feb. 1981), created by writer Tom DeFalco and artist Steve Ditko.[7] From 1987 to 1997, Macendale initially wielded only the Hobgoblin identity and weaponry but the 1988–89 Inferno crossover writer Gerry Conway had Macendale imbued with demonic powers by N'astirh. In addition to power over hellfire and increased strength and speed to far greater than the original Hobgoblin, these powers also disfigure Macendale so that his head is even more grotesque than the Hobgoblin mask, and ultimately alters his mind so that he was deluded into thinking that his appearance is normal. Macendale eventually succeeds in purging himself of his demonic powers and was later revamped again with cybernetic implants. The character was killed off in Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives #1 to make room for Roderick Kingsley to take back the Hobgoblin mantle. Writer Roger Stern recounted being initially uncertain of how to resolve the situation of there being two Hobgoblins:\n\nMach-VI\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Abner Jenkins\n\nMachete\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Machete (comics)\n\nMachine Man\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Machine Man\n\nMachine Teen\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Machine Teen\n\nMachinesmith\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Machinesmith\n\nAl MacKenzie\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Al MacKenzie\n\nMoira MacTaggart\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Moira MacTaggart\n\nMad Dog\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Mad Dog (Marvel Comics)\n\nMad Dog Rassitano\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Mad Dog Rassitano\n\nMad Jim Jaspers\n\n[edit]\n\nSir James \"Mad Jim\" Jaspers is a character in American comic books seen in Marvel Comics. He was created by David Thorpe and Alan Davis for Marvel UK. He is a powerful supervillain who was the archenemy of Captain Britain and Excalibur as well as a few other heroes as well as the main antagonist of the Excalibur series.\n\nIn the reality of Earth-238,[8] James Jaspers, a British politician waged a political war on mutants. He had been elected into office as a member of the English Parliament because of his anti mutant and anti super heroes stance and politics, however Jaspers was a mutant himself with powerful reality-warping abilities. His political façade and motivations for the elimination of his fellow mutants and superheroes was essentially to ensure his supremacy. Jaspers seemed a gifted politician and adapt at swaying popular public opinion, with lines such as \"if they were honest they wouldn't wear masks\" but whether he was always mad, or descended into madness with the advent of his mutant reality warping powers, Jaspers had lost his sanity. Jaspers of Earth-238 was so determined to rid his world of mutants, he began to move beyond drumming up anti-mutant sentiment and constructed an incredibly powerful adaptive cybernetic construct known simply as the Fury to hunt and eliminate all superpowered beings.\n\nJaspers had also formed an advanced technological equipped military task force charged with eliminating super powered beings, this group known as the Status Crew. Typically the Status Crew would round up powered beings to be held in concentration camps with their extermination there not long after. The Fury would deal with bigger threats. It would take less than two years for super powered beings to be on the verge of extinction. The Fury had been programmed by Jaspers to allow Jaspers to live as the sole powered being.\n\nUnmatched in power by any other being, any potential threats ruthlessly destroyed by the Fury, Jaspers adopted the persona of Mad Jim Jaspers, a bank robber and crook paying homage to the Mad Hatter from Alice in Wonderland as well as continuing the Lewis Carroll book theme with his own bank robbing crew, the Crazy Gang. It was around this time that the Omniversal Guardian Merlyn aware of not just this reality's version of Jaspers danger to the multiverse, but the Jim Jaspers of the 616 reality who Merlyn realized possessed even greater reality warping power. Merlyn would teleport one of the few remaining super heroes of Earth-238, Captain UK Linda McQuillan, to the 616 designated reality. Importantly he would also do so whilst she was being observed by the deadly cybiote the Fury. The Earth of 238 would fall into disarray due to the mad machinations and reality warping of Jaspers. It had become known as a crooked earth. Of similar concern was that the Jaspers of 616 had begun his political ascension, a worrying sign of things to come.[9]\n\nUpon returning to mainstream reality/616, Captain Britain found that another Sir James Jaspers was leading an anti-superhero campaign, with the aid of Henry Peter Gyrich and Sebastian Shaw, members of the Hellfire Club.\n\nJaspers managed to win a landslide general election victory on his anti-superhero platform and became Prime Minister of Britain. Events began to mirror those of Earth-238 and Jaspers unleashed the force of the Jaspers Warp upon London, causing much chaos and devastation. However, Jaspers found himself under attack from the reality-hopping Fury, and the two engage in a large-scale reality-warping battle in which Jaspers was ultimately killed by the Fury, who teleported him outside the universe, where he would have no reality to control and thus be rendered powerless.\n\nMad Stinker\n\n[edit]\n\nMad Stinker is an anthropomorphic skunk and animal version of Mad Thinker.[volume & issue needed]\n\nMad Thinker\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Mad Thinker\n\nMadame Hydra\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Madame Hydra\n\nMadame Masque\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Madame Masque\n\nMadame Menace\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Sunset Bain\n\nMadame Monstrosity\n\n[edit]\n\nMadame Monstrosity (Melodia Stillwell) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. She is a geneticist and mother of Farley Stillwell, Harlan Stillwell, and Shannon Stillwell who created the animal-like Humanimals by splicing human test subjects with animals. Her \"Farm\" is located somewhere in Westchester County, New York. Additionally, she claims that her work was used to create Lizard, Morbius, the Living Vampire, and Rhino.[10]\n\nTwo of her test subjects included the children Bailey Briggs and Eli Hartman, who she respectively transformed into a spider and elephant/rhino hybrid.[11] After Bailey escapes her captivity, she attempts to recapture him, creates a clone of him named Boy-Spider, and fully transforms her husband Jeremy into an owl before transforming herself into a chimera and being captured by the High Evolutionary, who plans to experiment on her.[a] Most of her test subjects are returned to normal, but Eli, Boy-Spider, and Jeremy's transformations prove to be irreversible, so they choose to live on the Farm with Bailey's mother Tabitha.[16]\n\nMadame Sanctity\n\n[edit]\n\nMadame Sanctity (Tanya Trask) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by Scott Lobdell, Jeph Loeb and Gene Ha. She first appeared in Askani'Son #1 (January 1996), though her true identity was revealed in Uncanny X-Men #-1 (July 1997).\n\nShe's a member of the Askani and as such, her story ties into that of Rachel Summers and Cable. Madame Sanctity was originally Tanya Trask, daughter of Bolivar Trask, the creator of the Sentinels. Like her brother Larry, Tanya was a mutant, though she possessed time travelling powers, as well as telepathic and psychokinetic abilities. When these manifested, Tanya was lost in the timestream, until being pulled into the Askani future by Rachel Summers. Tanya became a member of Rachel's Askani Sisterhood and took on the alias Sanctity.\n\nMadame Web\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Madame Web\n\nMadcap\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Madcap (comics)\n\nArtie Maddicks\n\n[edit]\n\nArthur \"Artie\" Maddicks is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He first appeared in X-Factor #2 (March 1986), and was created by Bob Layton and Jackson Guice.\n\nThe mutant son of Dr Carl Maddicks, Artie's mutation gives him a lumpy pink form with no nose, large round eyes, and renders him mute.[17] As a ward of X-Factor, Artie is a member of the \"X-Terminators\".[18]\n\nWhen X-Factor splits their wards between two boarding schools, Artie attends St. Simons. During the Inferno, Artie is abducted by the demon N'Astirh. Before he is rescued, Artie witnesses at least two murders.[19] After helping to foil a mutant kidnapping plot,[20] Artie gains an unofficial grandmother in Ida Fassbender, a nervous but kindly woman who lives near St. Simons.[21]\n\nGene Nation disrupts the school with another kidnapping scheme, this time successful. Artie then becomes a ward of the Massachusetts Academy.[22] When Black Tom Cassidy attacks the school, Man-Thing saves Artie and his friends.[23] As a group, they have several adventures.[24]\n\nArtie loses his mutant powers after \"M-Day\".[25] Artie moves to the Baxter Building where he gets a special helmet made by Valeria Richards. It allows him to communicate by creating images in the air – he remains mute due to the deformity caused by his mutations. Joining Artie is his long time friend Leech.[26] Later, the original Fantastic Four leave our reality for what they assume to be four minutes. Weeks pass instead. This possibility had been planned for and the Foundation children are watched over by a trusted roster of replacement members.[27] The Future Foundation help re-create the multi-verse after the events of the Secret War. For the Foundation, five years have passed, while a much smaller amount of time has passed at home. Artie has spent all this time with Reed and Sue Richards and the many fellow students of the Foundation.[28]\n\nArtie Maddicks in other media\n\n[edit]\n\nArtie Maddicks appears in X2, portrayed by Bryce Hodgson. This version sports a forked tongue and is a student at Xavier's school.\n\nMadman\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Madman (Marvel Comics)\n\nMadness\n\n[edit]\n\nMadness is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.\n\nCorwin Jones is a war veteran who was discharged from the military where he contracted an unknown illness.

After that was done, Drake had Corwin merge with the Symbiote samples where they combined to form a new gestalt symbiote called Madness who has seven heads.[29]\n\nMaelstrom\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Maelstrom (comics)\n\nMaestro\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Maestro (comics)\n\nMaggott\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Maggott\n\nMagician\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Magician (Marvel Comics)\n\nMagik\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Magik (Illyana Rasputina)\n\nMagique\n\n[edit]\n\nFirst appearanceThe X-Men #107 (October 1977)Created byChris Claremont and Dave CockrumSpeciesShi'arTeamsImperial GuardAbilitiesAbility to create realistic illusionsAliasesMagic\n\nMagique, originally known as Magic, is a Shi'ar warrior and member of the Imperial Guard. The character, created by Chris Claremont and Dave Cockrum, first appeared in The Uncanny X-Men #107 (October 1977). Magique has the ability to create realistic illusions. Like many original members of the Imperial Guard, Magique is the analog of a character from DC Comics' Legion of Super-Heroes: in her case Princess Projectra.[30]\n\nAlong with Gladiator, Mentor, and Quasar (later known as Neutron), Magic was one of the founding members of the Imperial Guard, brought together centuries earlier by T'korr, Majestor of the Shi'ar Empire, for the purpose of stopping Rook'shir, who has been driven insane by the malevolent force known as the Dark Phoenix, and was laying waste to the galaxy.[31]\n\nMagic and the Guard first clash with the X-Men and Starjammers, on behalf of D'Ken and Davan Shakari, over the fate of the Shi'ar Princess Lilandra Neramani.[32] After the battle, Lilandra takes over as Majestrix, and the Guard swears allegiance to her.[33]\n\nAfter Lilandra's sister Deathbird stages a coup and becomes the new Shi'ar Empress, the Guard comes into conflict with a rogue Space Knight named Pulsar (not the Imperial Guard member Impulse, who later changes his name to Pulsar) and an alien named Tyreseus. After a large conflict which also involves Rom and other Space Knights — which leads to the deaths four Guardsman — Pulsar and Tyreseus are defeated.[34]\n\nSome time later, Empress Deathbird sends the Imperial Guard to Earth to battle the combined forces of the Starjammers and the superhero team Excalibur, so that she can claim the power of the Phoenix Force for herself. The Guard are forced to retreat when Deathbird realizes the Starjammers are led by Lilandra.[35] (Some time later War Skrulls impersonating Charles Xavier and the Starjammers depose Deathbird and restore Lilandra to the throne. Deathbird cedes the empire back to Lilandra as she has grown bored of the bureaucracy.)[36]\n\nNow named Magique, the character takes part in \"Operation: Galactic Storm,\" which details an intergalactic war between the Shi'ar and the Kree. Magique and the Imperial Guard steal the original Captain Marvel's Nega-Bands from the dead hero's tomb.[37] Using Kree artifacts, including the Bands, the Sh'iar create a massive super weapon, the \"Nega-Bomb.\" Ultimately, the Nega-Bomb device is successfully detonated, devastating the Kree Empire, with billions dying instantaneously (98% of the Kree population).[38] The Shi'ar annex the remnants of the Kree Empire, with Deathbird becoming viceroy of the Kree territories.[39]\n\nAt the beginning of the \"War of Kings\" event, Magique is part of the Imperial Guard faction that attacks Ronan the Accuser on his wedding day.[40] The Guard also slaughters many new Nova Corps recruits.[41] Magique leads a squad of Imperial Guards to Knowhere, base of the Guardians, tracking Adam Warlock. However, Adam has begun turning into his dark counterpart, the Magus, and tricks Magique's troops into killing her.[42]\n\nSome years later, she is replaced by a member of the Subguardians in Guardians of the Galaxy (vol. 5) #1.[43]\n\nMagma\n\n[edit]\n\nMagma is the name of two fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.\n\nJonathan Darque\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Magma (Jonathan Darque)\n\nAmara Aquilla\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Magma (comics)\n\nMagneto\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Magneto (Marvel Comics)\n\nMagnir\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Enchanters Three\n\nMagnum\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Elementals (Marvel Comics)\n\nMagnus the Sorcerer\n\n[edit]\n\nMagnus the Sorcerer is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

Magnus grew up in the 6th century AD, in the time of King Arthur. Turned down as an apprentice by Merlin, he became the student, and eventually lover, of Morgan le Fay. In the 20th century, the centuries-old sorcerer could possess the bodies of the living. Magnus' spirit took possession of Jonathan Drew and aided the High Evolutionary in organizing the Knights of Wundagore.[44]\n\nMagsquito\n\n[edit]\n\nMagsquito is an anthropomorphic mosquito from Earth-8311.\n\nMaha Yogi\n\n[edit]\n\nComics character\n\nMaha YogiPublication informationPublisherMarvel ComicsFirst appearanceJourney into Mystery #96 (September 1963)Created byStan Lee (writer)\n\nJack Kirby (artist)In-story informationNotable aliasesMad Merlin, The Warlock, the Maha Yogi\n\nMaha Yogi is a fictional character in the Marvel Universe. He first appeared in Journey into Mystery #96 (September 1963), and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.\n\nYogi was apparently born 10,000 years ago in what is now Central Europe. He apparently was a savage that came to possess some portion of the same Bloodgem that Ulysses Bloodstone would later possess, which gave him immortality and eternal youth. He later came to Britain during the time of Camelot, and impersonated the real Merlin while he was away. The Eternal Sersi exposed the impostor, and the real Merlin placed him in suspended animation.[45]\n\nThe false Merlin was revived in modern times, still posing as Merlin, and battled and was defeated by Thor, after which he went back into the coffin.[46] He later became a professional criminal and took the name Warlock, organizing a band of armored mercenaries. He abducted Marvel Girl, battled the original X-Men, and was rendered comatose by Professor X.[47]\n\nLater, as the mentalist Maha Yogi, he attempted to create an army of mind-slaves. He fought and was defeated by the Beast and Iceman.[48] The Maha Yogi then became the chairman of Merlin Industries. With Mongu, the Maha Yogi plotted world conquest, but was defeated by the Hulk and Doctor Druid. During his encounter with the Hulk, his fragment of the Bloodgem was destroyed and he rapidly aged into helplessness.[49] Some time later, the Maha Yogi was revealed to have been created by the Caretakers of Arcturus and to have turned against them.[50] He later appeared alive with his youth apparently restored by unknown means.[51]\n\nAs a result of mutation induced by the Caretakers of Arcturus, the Maha Yogi had the psionic abilities to control the minds of others, create illusions, project psionic force bolts, levitate objects as large as a building, teleport himself, create force fields and alter his own appearance. His psionic powers have a limited range.\n\nThanks to his possession of a fragment of the Bloodstone, the Maha Yogi is virtually immortal, and has a physically malleable body.\n\nHe has attempted to use true magic, performing a ritual to summon the demon known as Grendel's Mother.[52]\n\nMahkizmo\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Mahkizmo\n\nBrett Mahoney\n\n[edit]\n\nComics character\n\nBrett MahoneyPublication informationPublisherMarvel ComicsFirst appearanceMarvel Comics Presents vol. 2 #1 (Nov. 2007)Created byMarc Guggenheim\n\nDave WilkinsIn-story informationSpeciesHumanTeam affiliationsNYPDPartnershipsStacy DolanSupporting character ofX-Men\n\nDaredevil\n\nDetective Brett Mahoney is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is a strictly loyal police detective who finds himself involved in the activities of superhumans. The character, created by Marc Guggenheim and Dave Wilkins, first appeared in Marvel Comics Presents vol. 2 #1 (Nov. 2007).\n\nBrett Mahoney is the partner of Stacy Dolan. In his first appearance they were investigating the death of a John Doe. The only clue they had was from a witness who described an unusual being later identified by Reed Richards as Uatu the Watcher.[53] After learning that the John Doe is an extraterrestrial and that deceased spy Yelena Belova are somehow involved, Mahoney and Dolan later discover that the crime is related to a Muslim named Jaafar Yoosuf who Dolan arrested earlier for \"buying\" superpowers. They break into Yoosuf's apartment, but he is absent.[54] When Dolan is accused of killing the John Doe, as evidenced by security footage showing her committing the crime, Mahoney simply tells her to remain silent as he is aware that something is wrong.[55] Mahoney is visited by an escaped Dolan who fakes her death and leaves a book for him to read telling him the truth about what happened.[56]\n\nMahoney is hired by Old Man Logan and Storm to examine the body of a dead mutant. He concludes that he was killed by a special bullet and that other mutants were killed the same way.[57] Afterwards, Mahoney and the NYPD arrest the culprit X-Cutioner.[58]\n\nBrett Mahoney in other media\n\n[edit]\n\nBrett Mahoney appears in media set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), portrayed by Royce Johnson.\n\nBrett makes his debut in the first season of Daredevil. This version is a sergeant at the 15th Precinct, who has had a friendly rivalry with Foggy Nelson since they were four. Foggy regularly bribes Brett into giving Nelson & Murdock client referrals by giving him cigars for his mother Bess.[59] However, he is not above sympathy, as he summons Matt, Karen and Foggy to the morgue to identify Elena Cardenas' body after Fisk has her killed.[60] After Detective Christian Blake is shot on Fisk's orders, Brett is assigned to stand guard outside Blake's hospital room and is present when Blake's partner Carl Hoffman is blackmailed by Fisk into poisoning Blake to keep him from talking.[61] After Fisk kills Ben Urich, Matt and Foggy turn to Brett for assistance in taking down Fisk, as he is one of the few cops in the precinct not on Fisk's payroll. Matt tracks down and saves Hoffman just as he is about to be killed by Fisk's cops, and has him turn himself over to Brett to be booked into custody. Following Fisk's attempt to escape while being escorted to jail, Brett is responsible for recapturing Fisk and taking him back into custody.[62]\n\nBrett makes a cameo appearance in the first season of Jessica Jones, when Kilgrave walks into the 15th precinct and orders the cops to all point guns at each other or themselves. Brett in particular is forced to point his gun at Oscar Clemons' head.[63]\n\nBrett has an expanded role in the second season of Daredevil. He is first introduced when Matt and Foggy encounter him at the scene of a Kitchen Irish massacre committed by Frank Castle and give him information on Grotto. Brett cautions Matt and Foggy to turn over Grotto to the NYPD and walk away so they are not caught in the crossfire.[64] Brett later guards Grotto after Castle tries to kill him and Karen at the hospital.[65] Later on, in \"Penny and Dime,\" Brett rolls up on Matt after he rescues Frank from the Kitchen Irish, and almost arrests Matt until Matt persuades him to take the credit for Frank's arrest to bolster public confidence in the NYPD.[66] The publicity of the arrest earns Brett a transfer to the Detective Bureau, much to Matt, Karen and Foggy's surprise when they find Brett has been placed in charge of the security detail guarding Frank while he recovers in the hospital before his arraignment.[67] A few episodes later, when Matt discovers that the Hand are harvesting human blood, he seeks out Brett and shows him the blood farm.[68] Brett puts Karen under police protection when her investigation into Frank's background leads her to be targeted by the Blacksmith, the man responsible for the death of Frank's family. She slips out of protective custody, but after witnessing Frank brutally kill two of the Blacksmith's men at a diner, Karen returns to give Brett information about where the heroin is being transferred.[69] In the season 2 finale, members of the Hand working for Nobu rough up Brett and force him to give them files on people saved by Daredevil, among them Karen and Turk Barrett, so they can kidnap them as bait.[70]\n\nBrett makes a cameo appearance in The Punisher episode \"Virtue of the Vicious\", as he collects interviews from Karen, Dinah Madani, Billy Russo, and Senator Stan Ori over the events of Lewis Wilson's attempt to assassinate Karen and Senator Ori as well as any information about Frank's presence.[71]\n\nBrett has a recurring appearance in the second season of The Punisher, where he leads the NYPD's investigation into Billy Russo's escape from custody.[72] Throughout the investigation, he has several run-ins with Madani, who is conducting her own investigation into Russo.[73][74][75]\n\nIn the third season of Daredevil, Foggy is encouraged by his girlfriend Marci Stahl to run for district attorney against Blake Tower to protest Fisk's release from prison. Knowing the NYPD still dislikes Fisk, he goes to a union hall where Brett and several other officers are congregating. Although Foggy is initially greeted with jeers, he is able to use Brett's support to convince the cops in attendance to throw their support behind his campaign.[76] Later in the season, Dex attacks Matt's church on Fisk's orders in an attempt to kill Karen to avenge her murder of James Wesley. Brett is among the cops who handle the crime scene investigation. With Matt and Karen stuck in the church basement, Matt is forced to call on Foggy to get them out. With help from Ray Nadeem, Foggy and Brett agree to have Karen \"arrested\" so that she will not be killed by the corrupt FBI agents in Fisk's pocket.[77] Brett later agrees to take in Nadeem's family after Fisk attempts to have them killed. He also provides Matt and Nadeem with a police escort to transport Nadeem to the courthouse so he can testify before a grand jury. Hitmen working for Fisk ambush the convoy and attempt to kill Nadeem, but he and Matt manage to fight off the assassins.[78] After Nadeem is murdered by Dex on Vanessa's orders, Foggy realizes Matt is likely going to go after Fisk at his wedding with the intention of killing him, so pays Brett a visit to warn him. Brett provides additional security at the Presidential Hotel, who are there when Dex is provoked by Matt into attacking Fisk's wedding for the death of Julie Barnes. After Matt defeats Dex and Fisk, Brett and the officers under his command arrive to take Fisk back to prison. When Fisk asks to say goodbye to Vanessa, Brett refuses to grant him the courtesy.[79]\n\nMahr Vehl\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Mahr Vehl\n\nMainframe\n\n[edit]\n\nMainframe is the name of three fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.\n\nEarth-691 version\n\n[edit]\n\nComics character\n\nMainframePublication informationPublisherMarvel ComicsFirst appearanceAmazing Adventures #38 (September 1976) (cameo)\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy #5 (October 1990) (full appearance)Created byJim ValentinoIn-story informationAlter egoMain FrameSpeciesAndroidTeam affiliationsGuardians of the Galaxy (Earth-691)Notable aliasesVision (Earth-691)AbilitiesN/A\n\nThe Earth-691 version of Mainframe is a future counterpart of Vision that is featured in the title Guardians of the Galaxy.

This is how Tandy Bowen and Tyrone Johnson came into contact with Dr. Marshall; the two runaways were injected with D-Lite, which had been fatal to others, and survived the ordeal while also becoming unintentionally empowered.[155] Another of his subjects, an unnamed human-smuggler, was injected with D-Lite by Dr. Marshall who waited to see what happened. After the two runaways break open a window and escape, the human-smuggler made a run for it, too. D-Lite had elicit side-effects on him as well, which later resulted in the crime lord Mister Negative.[156] Cloak and Dagger tracked down the people behind the experimention while Spider-Man intervened, trying to stop the former two from killing people.

A superhero martial artist, he is associated with Daredevil, and first appeared in Daredevil vol. 2 #112. He was created by Ed Brubaker and Michael Lark.\n\nThe man who would be known in the modern age only as Master Izo was a member of the organization The Hand hundreds of years ago in Feudal Japan. Following the death of its founder, Kagenobu Yoshioka, and its transformation from a samurai alliance into a ninja cult in service to a demon, Izo chose to leave. At this time he put out his eyes, which enabled him to see the world, he claimed, as Yoshioka had (and as Daredevil later would).[163]\n\nIzo would later found The Chaste, a rival martial arts association situated atop a sheer cliff known as the Wall. However, his unhindered nature eventually led his students to vote him out, disgusted with his drinking and gambling. Stick took his place as the leader of the Chaste. Izo was revealed to have been present shortly after the accident which gave Matt Murdock his superhuman senses, and reported this information anonymously to Stick. Later still, he became the trainer of the future supervillain and Hand assassin Lady Bullseye, who he promised would one day become the Hand's leader.[163] He is mentioned a number of times in the Book of the Iron Fist.[164]\n\nMuch later, following the death of the Skrull posing as Hand leader Elektra, Izo journeyed to New York City, where the four remaining ninja-lords of the Hand were assembling to forcibly induct Daredevil as the new leader. Izo intervened to assist Daredevil in driving them off, which led them to switch their focus to the Kingpin. Izo's purpose was in fact to manoeuvre Daredevil into taking the position, as a means of reforming the Hand away from its corrupted state. He was also revealed to have placed Black Tarantula within the Hand as a mole, unbeknownst to Daredevil. Ultimately, Daredevil accepted the position, and ordered that the Kingpin and Lady Bullseye be banished. Her erstwhile ally's treachery exposed, Lady Bullseye vowed to kill Izo, who told her to \"get in line.\"[165][163] Subsequently, Izo fakes his own murder at the hands of Daredevil to trick the Hand into accepting Daredevil as their leader.[166] He later shows up in Shadowland to reveal to the heroes involved in the battle against Daredevil and the Hand to explain his discovery that Matt Murdock had been possessed by the Beast.[167]\n\nMaster Izo is a formidable martial artist, one of the finest anywhere in the world, including being able to wield two katana at once. He has considerable stamina, enabling him to traverse the city by jumping on rooftops. Despite (or rather, as a result of) being blind, he has superhuman-radar senses, much as Daredevil does. He also evidently possesses some form of immortality or at least life-extending capability, as he is now somewhere in the area of 500 years old.\n\nMaster Khan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Master Khan\n\nMaster Man\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Master Man\n\nMaster Menace\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Master Menace\n\nMastermind Excello\n\n[edit]\n\nMastermind Excello is the name of two fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.\n\nEarl Everett\n\n[edit]\n\nMastermind Excello (Earl Everett[168]) is an American comic book character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

He was once the most famous bull fighter of Spain. However, his cruelty and brutality towards the bulls made the crowd hate him. When a riot broke loose during one of his performances, Manuel had to be rushed to the hospital. After his recovery, he swore revenge upon all mankind. From that moment on, he vanished from sight, starting to make evil schemes. Matador primarily crossed paths with Daredevil and fought him on numerous occasions. He even joined the Emissaries of Evil and teamed up with characters such as Electro, Gladiator, Leap-Frog, and Stilt-Man. He later ironically teamed up with Man-Bull.

A mutant, Hamill attended the Xavier Institute before its closing. While at the institute, Hamill was the field leader of the Paragons training squad.\n\nPublication history\n\n[edit]\n\nThe character, created by Nunzio DeFilippis and Christina Weir, first appeared in New Mutants Vol. 2 #7. DeFilippis revealed that while he and Weir created the character, he was based on a background mutant from New X-Men: Academy X, #7. \"We saw a cool bit of artwork in the background of a panel (I think it was Carlo Barberi who first drew him) and thought for a few seconds about a name, codename, and power set.\"[177]\n\nFictional character biography\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile spending time in his home town park, Ben Hamill suddenly manifested his mutant powers. Unable to control his powers, Ben set flame to the town's park.\n\nAfter the manifestation of his powers, Ben was enrolled in the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters. While at the school, he chose the codename Match, where he was present at Xavier's special assembly head by the headmaster Charles Xavier to inform the student body of an explosion that happened the night before caused by Magma who'd been awoken from a coma by Josh and Julian's involvement. Xavier preached about heroism being more than being brave.[178] Match would later attend Parent's Week at Xavier's, although it is unknown if his parents for the week he seem to enjoy himself during the festive time.[179] While in class with Karma, he was asked along with his classmates if they'd seen Josh, who was unknowingly out on a date with Rahne Sinclair.[180]\n\nAfter enrolling at the institute, Hamill was assigned to the Paragons training squad under the tutelage of Rahne Sinclair.[181] Though hot-tempered (even voted \"Shortest Temper\"[182]), Hamill is a natural leader, and consequently, was named as the field leader for his squad.[183] As a part of the field squads games, the Paragons participated in a Danger Room session where they had to fight a Hulk construct. After the exercise, the New Mutants squad tried the same simulation and beat the record set by the Paragons' exercise. During a team meeting with Rahne, Ben and his teammates expressed their dismay at the New Mutants squad having had beat their time. Rahne then gave them a much needed a pep talk, trying to remind them that they would have save a lot of lives if the session had been real.[184] Soon after, Cyclops and Emma Frost revealed that Sinclair had been in a romantic relationship with a student, Josh Foley, who was abruptly departed from the school, leaving the Paragons without an advisor. Ultimately, former New Mutant, Magma stepped in to become the Paragons' mentor.[183]\n\nBen is still viewed as such by his former teammates after the dissolution of the squad system.[185] Following the events of House of M, only 27 of the school's students retained their powers. All squads were dissolved, and the remaining students were merged into one group. Ben and his fellow former Paragons Trance, Wolf Cub, and Pixie were revealed to be among the handful of still-powered Xavier students.[186]\n\nMatch, along with several of his fellow students, is sucked down into the realm of Limbo. When attacked by demons, he quickly joins the fight, killing several demons while trying to protect Pixie and Blindfold.[187] Ben participates in the final fight against Belasco and is returned to the school after Belasco is defeated.[188][189][190][191]\n\nBen relocates to San Francisco along with the other X-Men.[192] He reappears putting out fires started by rioting over Proposition X, an anti-mutant reproductive legislation being pushed by the anti-mutant organization \"Humanity Now!\"[193] After the riots subside, the Dark X-Men along with Norman Osborn declare a citywide curfew for all citizens prohibiting public activity after dark. In Avalanche's bar, Match, along with fellow student Hellion and other mutants angrily decide to cause a scene after curfew hours for all the world to see as a warning against the \"fascism\" of the Dark X-Men. As Match spreads fire throughout Union Square, the Dark X-Men come to arrest the troublemaking mutants.[194] After a battle, they are taken into custody by the Dark X-Men.[195] Eventually, Match and the other imprisoned mutants are freed by the X-Force and teleported to the island of Utopia.[196]\n\nBen's abilities are pyrokinesis, enabling him to produce and manipulate flame. In addition, he is seemingly immune to fire and high temperatures. As a side effect of his powers, Ben's head remains constantly aflame, though it appears that he can control the extent of the flaming; during a Danger Room session, he is able to maintain some level of stealth by lowering the intensity of his head flame. Ben's body is always glowing, and emits heat, however it is not hot enough to burn his clothing. The flame on his head is also not as hot as normal fire and as such, it does not burn what it touches. This was confirmed by his creators, Nunzio DeFilippis and Christina Weir.\n\nMatch in other media\n\n[edit]\n\nMatch makes a cameo appearance in Dark Phoenix, portrayed by Lamar Johnson.[177]\n\nMathemaniac\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Mathemanic\n\nTaki Matsuya\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Taki Matsuya\n\nMatthew Plunder\n\n[edit]\n\nMatthew Plunder is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

He escaped into the jungle, but after meeting up with Skaar, was captured by those working for the Designer, when Skaar deemed it more important to save his people than Matthew. He was placed inside the wormhole on the Savage Land and was rescued along with all the other trapped souls by Skaar. He then joined the army that was formed and was seen alive after the Designer was defeated.[197]\n\nA much older Matthew saved the life of Valeria Richards with his Pterosaur Dax after she was dropped by one of the Swamp Men's Terror Birds in midair. After straightening out the situation with the alien Prah'd'gul, Valeria played small talk with Matthew about his age progression through a time traveling incident and flirted with him as they went their separate ways.[198]\n\nMauler\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Mauler (comics)\n\nMaverick\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: David North (character)\n\nRobert Maverick\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Robert Maverick\n\nEbony Maw\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Ebony Maw\n\nMax\n\n[edit]\n\nMaxam\n\n[edit]\n\nMaxam is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. was created by Jim Starlin and Tom Raney, and first appeared in Warlock and the Infinity Watch #12 (January 1993).\n\nMaxam first appeared in a vision of Gamora,[volume & issue needed] then wielder of the Infinity Gem of time, wherein Maxam murdered Adam Warlock.[volume & issue needed] He later appeared on the island of the Infinity Watch with no memory of his past.[volume & issue needed] Eventually it was revealed that Maxam was from an alternate future earth where the majority of humanity had been wiped out by the Universal Church of Truth, an organization ruled by the future evil self of Adam Warlock known as the Magus.

The character of detective Brigid O'Reilly first appeared in Cloak and Dagger #1 (Oct. 1983) and was created by Bill Mantlo and Rick Leonardi.[199] She subsequently appeared in issues #2-4 (Nov. 1983-Jan. 1984) of the same series, and issues #1-5 (July 1985 – March 1986) of the second Cloak and Dagger series. In Cloak and Dagger vol. 2 #5 (March 1986), Brigid underwent a drastic transformation and became known as Mayhem. The character subsequently appeared, as Mayhem, in Cloak and Dagger #6–9 (May–Nov. 1986), Strange Tales #13–15 (April–June 1988), #19 (Oct. 1988), The Mutant Misadventures of Cloak and Dagger #1–2 (Oct. Dec. 1988), #5–6 (June, Aug. 1989), #8 (Nov. 1989), #10–18 (Feb. 1990 – June 1991), Web of Spider-Man Annual #9 (1993) and #10 (1994). Mayhem received an entry in The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition #8. However, some of the color plates were reversed in that issue; those pages, including Mayhem, were re-printed correctly in issue #9.\n\nBrigid O'Reilly was originally a police detective in Manhattan when she learned that Cloak and Dagger were attacking criminals in her precinct. She at first wanted to bring the pair to justice,[200] but she eventually learned to trust the young crime-fighters.[201] Later, she took a squad of police officers to investigate a warehouse belonging to the same pharmaceutical company that was behind Cloak's and Dagger's powers. Some corrupt policemen, led by Roger Falcone, exposed the other police officers to a gas to asphyxiate them. With her dying breath, Brigid swore vengeance on Falcone. As Brigid lay dying, Cloak and Dagger found her, and though were too late to save the other police, Cloak surrounded her and Dagger with darkness, while Dagger tried to revive her with light. When this appeared not to work, the pair abandoned her body to search for those responsible.[202]\n\nThough O'Reilly died, she was reborn as Mayhem. In this new form, Mayhem helped Cloak and Dagger find and fight the corrupt police. She then killed Falcone as promised.[203] She then became a vigilante, showing no mercy to the drug dealers and other criminals she pursues. Brigid was considered as a \"potential recruit\" for the Initiative program, according to Civil War: Battle Damage Report.[204]\n\nMayhem exudes a green, venomous gas from her pores. If this gas enters another person's bloodstream, it paralyzes the person for a varying amount of time. Mayhem attacks people by raking their skin with her talon-like fingernails so that the gas will enter their bloodstreams. The gas can also act like a truth serum, forcing a victim of Mayhem to tell her the truth. Dagger's \"light-knives\" dissipate upon contact with this gas. Mayhem can levitate herself and fly.\n\nMayhem in other media\n\n[edit]\n\nBrigid O'Reilly appears in the live-action Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) television series Marvel's Cloak & Dagger, portrayed by Emma Lahana.[205] Introduced in the first season, this version is a detective who formerly worked in Harlem before moving to New Orleans.[206] She grows suspicious of her partner, corrupt police officer James Connors, which she later confirms afterward with help from Tandy Bowen.[207] O'Reilly soon allies with Tyrone Johnson, who wants to avenge his brother's death at the hands of Connors.[208] They succeed in getting Connors to admit his guilt and see him arrested. However, O'Reilly discovers her boyfriend was murdered.[209] Additionally, Connors is released on suspension and proceeds to beat her in front of other officers to reinforce her outcast status among them.[210] O'Reilly joins forces with Johnson to stop a dark energy called the Terror from being released by the Roxxon company, but is shot by Connors, exposed to the Terror's energy, and falls into a swamp, though she later re-emerges with glowing green eyes.[211] In the second season, it is revealed that this O'Reilly, later named Mayhem, is a physical copy of the original with all of her memories and knowledge. However, Mayhem is a ruthless vigilante with no compunction about murder. In the opening episodes, Mayhem proceeds to kill a number of New Orleans underworld figures, and later assumes O'Reilly's identity to take a criminal investigation into her own hands. In the meantime, Johnson finds O'Reilly tied up at home, then teleports them to Bowen, who is at a crime scene with Mayhem.[212] Following this, Mayhem searches for Connors, killing his partner in the process. While examining O'Reilly, Roxxon environmentalist Mina Hess theorizes and later proves the former was split between two forms, with O'Reilly representing her fear and Mayhem her aggression. Amidst a criminal investigation into a prostitution ring, Mayhem attacks and nearly kills a criminal gang before Johnson uses his powers to send her to the Darkforce Dimension.[213] Bowen follows Mayhem, unwittingly depriving Johnson of his powers. Together, Mayhem and Bowen find evidence of Connors' presence and endeavor to leave the Dimension, but Bowen accidentally exits the Dimension with Connors, leaving Mayhem behind. Mayhem later finds Andre Deschaine's metaphysical record store and destroys his records, which held his victims' despair; freeing Johnson from Deschaine's spell and allowing him to rescue Bowen from Deschaine's prostitution ring.[214] After ending up in the Loa Dimension, O'Reilly encounters Mayhem, and the two agree to allow the latter to take control on certain occasions. Once they leave, they are fused back together.[215] Mayhem later defends Johnson's friend Evita from forces that threatened to foil Johnson and Bowen's mission to stop Deschaine and O'Reilly leaves Connors' dead body for her fellow police officers to see.[216]\n\nKenny McFarlane\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Kenny McFarlane\n\nTiny McKeever\n\n[edit]\n\nTiny McKeever is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.\n\nMegan McLaren\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\nMegan McLaren at the Comic Book DB (archived from the original)\n\nMegan McLaren is a fictional character in Marvel Comics.

The character is most commonly depicted as an enemy of Spider-Man. Her first appearance as Lily Hollister is in The Amazing Spider-Man #545, and her first appearance as Menace is in The Amazing Spider-Man #550 which is the start of the second story arc in the \"Brand New Day\" overarching storyline that followed the events of \"One More Day\".[250]\n\nDaughter of District Attorney William \"Bill\" Hollister, socialite Lily Hollister was dating Harry Osborn. Lily found a hidden door in Harry Osborn's closet and found an old journal of his.[251] She uncovered the location of one of Norman Osborn's secret rooms in the journal. When she had first gone in, she found all of the Goblin's equipment along with some experiments. After accidentally knocking over some experimental Goblin chemicals, she absorbed them into her skin, and was now able to transform into her \"Menace\" form at will. Stealing a weapons cache of the original Green Goblin, Norman Osborn, Menace was later hunted down by Jackpot. During her search, she met Spider-Man and reluctantly accepted his help. Menace attacked a council meeting and kidnapped councilwoman Lisa Parfrey, with Spider-Man and Jackpot working together to try and stop her. Menace's glider slammed into the rescued councilwoman, killing her, and Menace escaped the crime scene, but not before accusing Spider-Man of being responsible for the woman's death.[252]\n\nMenace later tried to threaten Bill Hollister, her father and one of the candidates for the election, into dropping out of the race for mayor while she continued supporting him in her public identity. She was sabotaging his campaign for his own good against Randall Crowne, his opponent, and began destroying her fathers advertisements. She also broke into their home and tried to threaten him into backing out of the running. Menace then proceeded to threaten the supposedly 'redeemed' Norman Osborn who had come to town when her actions inadvertently revealed that Crowne had been operating an illegal sweatshop in the city and Crowne asked him for help. Menace recreated Osborn's original death by ramming him with her glider, however, Osborn survived the attack and Menace spared him, after accusing Osborn of being a fool for devoting all his time and assets to Spider-Man's destruction. During the Skrull Invasion, Lily and Harry Osborn were attacked on the street, after getting away from Harry and changing into Menace she killed one of the invading Skrulls, and then set her sights on Jackpot, believing her to be \"Spider-Man's girlfriend\". Their fight took her into the path of one of the Skrulls, with Menace's glider exploding on contact. Menace survived, though badly injured, and limped away from the scene.[253]\n\nWhen Menace attacked a Hollister Rally, she managed to badly beat Spider-Man (who had earlier been shot through the arm) and claimed a \"citizen's arrest\" to the arriving police. Menace then flew into the Hollister party headquarters, and changed back into Lily Hollister, just before Harry walked in on her. She revealed to Harry that she was Menace. She then told Harry that she accepted his earlier marriage proposal.[254] On Election Day, Menace attacked two police officers for arresting her former friend Carlie Cooper for a crime she didn't commit, then attacked Spider-Man when he appeared. Menace was about to finish him until Harry, as the Green Goblin, appeared and shot Menace with a serum, with Spider-Man giving her the full injection. This caused Menace to change back into Lily and was seen in a live broadcast, with her father watching in shock and in tears of this revelation. A few days after the event, with Bill Hollister as the new Mayor of New York, Lily was now in prison and was visited by Norman Osborn, who discovered the engagement ring given to her by Harry and welcomed her to the family.[254]\n\nShe is later seen released from prison and approaches Harry in her Menace form, telling him that she's \"moved on\". Harry believes that she has started a relationship with Norman and warns her that she will be disposed of once Norman's done with her.[255]\n\nDuring the Dark Reign storyline, Lily reappears in her Menace form to Harry Osborn in The Amazing Spider-Man #595 threatening Harry's life at first, but then showing Harry that she is pregnant. After this, Harry calls Norman Osborn to inform him that he will be accepting his invitation to work for the Dark Avengers, which highly upsets Peter Parker. Harry's real reason for joining is to steal a cure for the serum to use on Lily and the baby so they can be healthy.\n\nHowever, she pushes him away and reveals that it was all a ruse to make Harry become American Son so he could be used to die in a tragedy to engender sympathy and support for Norman. She also shows a new goblin form, with a decidedly more feminine figure, large full horns, and a green complexion. Lily reveals to Harry that Norman is actually the father of the baby.[256] She then goes to work for Norman's Dark Avengers in an unknown capacity.[257] After Norman's fall from power, Lily is on the run from the law.

Word of her child's safety (but not the paternity) gets back to Lily, who is relieved. She runs away because she feels she is unfit to raise the child.[260] Spider-Man later tests Harry's blood, revealing that he is in fact the father, and leaves the child in his care.[261]\n\nAs part of the Marvel NOW! event, Menace returns showing her allegiance to the Goblin King as part of his underground Goblin Nation when it comes to preparing for the fight against Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus' mind in Spider-Man's body).

Menace then gives the Goblin King the journal revealing the secret about Superior Spider-Man.[263] During the Green Goblin's takeover of Manhattan, the real Spider-Man returns and defeats the Goblin Nation. In the process, he uses an antidote for the Goblin Serum on Menace, turning her back to a normal human.[264]\n\nDuring the AXIS storyline, Phil Urich tries to free Lily Hollister from police custody, blowing up the police car in which she was being transferred. Lily's body drops into the river and can't be found by the police or Urich. Lily has survived the explosion and lives on the streets with no memory of who she was. She finds one of Roderick Kingsley's (who was now in the business of reinventing people into superheroes) ads in a newspaper, and goes to his base.[265] Over the next month, Roderick Kingsley turns Lily into the Queen Cat, a Black Cat-like heroine.
