        "text": "In 1909, at the Emsdale Colliery in Yorkshire, England, miners cut coal from deep, underground seams and shovel it into rail carts harnessed to “pit ponies.” A miner gives Flash, one of the ponies, a bite to eat from his lunch bucket. Two under-age brothers, Dave and Tommy Sadler, take care of the ponies under the watchful eye of Bert, the man in charge of the underground stables. Their stepfather, miner Luke Armstrong, tells Bert to hide the boys quickly because the foreman, Sam Carter, is coming through right behind him with the new manager, Mr. Sandman. Bert explains to Sandman that the ponies are indispensable, and that Flash is the best worker in the mine, with fourteen years of experience, but Sandman remarks that Flash must be “past his best now.” Later, when Sandman sees Bert pay the brothers a few coins, he tells him the boys are too young to be in the mine, and Bert replies that he lets Dave and Tommy earn a little money because their father died in the mine. At dinner, Dave, the older brother, is resentful of his stepfather, Luke, because he feels the man is partly responsible for their father’s death. However, the boys' mother, Violet Armstrong, defends her new husband. Meanwhile, Sandman tells his young daughter, Alice, over supper that changes he is bringing to the mine will replace the ponies. The next day, when Alice tries to fly a kite in the nearby hills, Dave and Tommy rescue it from a tree. Alice tell the boys she is new to the village and waiting for her governess to arrive, because as the daughter of the superintendent she cannot go to school with the miners’ children. She is intrigued when the brothers mention the underground ponies and wants to meet them. Meanwhile, owner Lord Harrogate tells Sandman he is unhappy with the Emsdale Colliery because it loses money, and Sandman counters that he is already introducing new machinery that will replace the ponies and make the mine profitable. When the new machines arrive the next day, along with men to install them, Dave, Tommy, and Alice watch from a nearby hill. Then Alice disguises herself as a boy, with a cap pulled over her face, and accompanies Dave down the elevator into the mine, where she meets Flash and the other ponies. Alice tells Dave her father is removing the ponies from the mine, but they will live in fields where they can frolic in the sunshine. Meanwhile, Alice’s stuffy governess, Miss Coutts, arrives and tells Mrs. Sandman it is time to “get Alice back into ladylike ways.” That night, Alice wakes up and asks Miss Coutts what will happen to the ponies if they are removed from the mine. The governess guesses they will go to the slaughterhouse. The next morning, Alice challenges her father, and when he admits the ponies will be slaughtered because they cannot fend for themselves above ground, Alice leaves the table. At the colliery, the miners and the men laying cable for the new equipment get in each other’s way, sparking an argument that ends with Sandman sending the miners home. When Alice tells Dave and Tommy the ponies will be killed, they decide to save them. Alice sneaks into her father’s office and steals a map of the mine tunnels, which leads them to an old engine house that is no longer working because it serviced the now-closed tunnel where the boys’ father and four other miners were killed. When the children realize the “winding engine” that runs the elevator needs to be fixed, Alice asks her father to teach her about how mine machinery works. Miss Coutts objects to Alice studying such a vulgar subject, but Mr. Sandman wants Alice to learn about “the world around her” and gives her an engineering book that covers winding engines. Alice and the brothers attempt to rebuild the motor, and when they cannot go any further, stablemaster Bert stumbles upon them and helps to get the machine running. Alice borrows a roll of crochet thread from Miss Coutts so that Dave will not get lost in the tunnels, and he unspools it as he moves through the dark until he hears a pony’s whinny and sees Flash hauling a cart of coal. Returning to the others, Dave leads them to an abandoned stable nearby where they can hide the ponies. At dinner, Luke tells Dave that tomorrow is the last day for the ponies, so he will get permission from Sam Carter to let the boys see them before they are taken away. Alice goes to bed and, after getting a goodnight kiss from her mother, sneaks off to the engine house to join the boys. When miners hear noises coming from the closed-up mine, Bert discourages their investigation by saying hobgoblins are loose. As the ponies’ harnesses are released from the coal carts at the end of the shift and they run toward their underground stalls, Dave and Tommy lead them to the old tunnel. One by one, with Bert’s help, the children load the ponies on the lift, take them up, and lead them in the moonlight to the abandoned stables. Meanwhile, Sandman discovers that Alice is not in bed, and at that moment, Sam and Luke knock on his door to tell him the ponies are missing. Along with Miss Coutts, the men go to the abandoned stables and find the children tending the ponies. Alice begs her father to spare them, but he sends her home with her governess. The next morning, as the ponies are led to a train that will carry them to a slaughterhouse, the miners, led by Luke, refuse to work or let the ponies be loaded, because they have “served the company well” and do not deserve to be killed. Luke tells his fellow miners that if the company is so eager to slaughter the ponies, what does it have in store for the miners? They strike, demanding that the ponies be returned to the pit. That evening, Violet tells Luke she is concerned that the union will not support their strike and the miners will lose everything. The company store hangs a “no credit” sign on the door. When Dave, tending to Flash, asks Bert why the ponies act so strangely, the old man says coal dust has blinded them, but since they knew the dark tunnels so well, they did not realize their blindness until they were brought up, and now they are helpless. Sandman visits Lord Harrogate’s manor to plead the miners’ case, but the owner says if the miners strike, he will close the mine and use the land for something more profitable. Over Luke’s protests, the miners vote to go back into the pit, but later, moments before Lord Harrogate arrives, an explosion rocks the colliery. Eight men, including Luke, are trapped in a tunnel, and since the area is filled with methane mixed with coal dust, the tunnel is dangerous and the men have no more than forty-eight hours of air. Also, their rescuers cannot use flames in the highly explosive area. Dave suggests they go down to the abandoned tunnel and reach them from that direction, using Flash as their guide. Mrs. Sandman and Alice join the miners and their families as they rush toward the old engine house. Luke, Sam, Sandman, and another miner named Ginger take Flash down the elevator and follow him to a place in the coal face where they tap a signal to the trapped miners, who dig through and escape, but Flash, having done his job, automatically returns to his old stall. As soon as everyone reaches safety above, Dave asks, “Where’s Flash?” Moments later, the mine blows up. Lord Harrogate asks why the children are crying even though all the miners are safe, and Sam explains that the ponies “mean something here.” As Dave cries over Flash’s death, Luke joins him and says he misses Dave’s father like Dave misses Flash. The next day, Lord Harrogate hosts a picnic for all the miners at his manor and donates a nearby field in Flash’s honor where the pit ponies can live out their lives in comfort and safety."
