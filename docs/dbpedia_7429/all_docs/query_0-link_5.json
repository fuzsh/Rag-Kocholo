        "text": "907: Hobgoblins\n\nby Wyn Hilty\n\nI’m very afraid.\n\nA possible reference to the line “Be afraid. Be very afraid,” which was spoken by Geena Davis in the 1986 horror film The Fly, a loose remake of the 1958 film of the same name. The line became a tagline for the film, was used extensively in its marketing, and has since become so firmly embedded in popular culture that many people know the line but don’t know its origin.\n\nHas he got Pringles in his shoes?\n\nPringles are a brand of potato chips developed by Procter & Gamble in 1967 and now owned by Kellogg’s. Unlike other chips, which involve slices of actual potatoes and come in bags, Pringles are machine-made: compressed potato residue and wheat starch chips sold neatly stacked in cylindrical cardboard tubes.\n\nThe true story of Neil Peart.\n\nNeil Peart (1952-2020) was the drummer and primary lyricist for the Canadian rock band Rush.

Breaking In is a 1989 movie starring Burt Reynolds as a professional thief.\n\nYup, I used to be Robert Frost, you know.\n\nRobert Frost (1874-1963) was an American poet known for his evocation of the New England countryside in poems like “Stopping By Woods on a Snowy Evening.”\n\nI’d love to get out of the rat race and guard a U-Store-It for a while.\n\nU-Store-It is a chain of self-storage facilities, one of the largest in the country; it boasts somewhere around 37,000 locations nationwide.\n\nOkay, then, I say dress in hot pants from now on.\n\nAlso known as “short shorts,” hot pants are very short (two inches or less inseam) and very tight, emphasizing the butt and highlighting the thighs. They were introduced in the mid-1960s and had faded by the early 1970s. A denim version experienced a brief revival in the late 1970s thanks to the character of Daisy Duke (played by Catherine Bach) on the TV series The Dukes of Hazzard (CBS, 1978-1985); they are still known as “Daisy Dukes.”\n\nOkay, so, what, now he becomes a Jedi Knight? Why am I sitting here?\n\nThe Jedi Knights were the order of mystical warriors in the Star Wars films by George Lucas; one of the main plot threads involved the young Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) training to become a Jedi Knight.\n\nIt’s a secret blow comb storehouse.\n\nBlow combs are a type of hair dryer that incorporate a comb into the design.\n\nI need another Yoo-hoo!\n\nYoo-hoo is a chocolate-flavored drink popular among the kiddie set.\n\nOh, Burgess Meredith’s in there reading.\n\nA reference to the Twilight Zone episode “Time Enough at Last,” in which a bookish bank clerk, played by Meredith, takes his lunch break in the vault and emerges to find himself the only survivor of a nuclear holocaust. He realizes that at last he has all the time he could ever want to read, until (spoiler alert) he ironically breaks his glasses.\n\nMaybe the Great Carnac answers are stored in there.\n\nCarnac the Magnificent was a character played by host Johnny Carson during his run on the Tonight Show. Carnac was a mind-reader with an enormous turban, who would magically divine the answers to questions written inside sealed envelopes.\n\nThis poor guy was edged out of every decent role by Grant Goodeve.\n\nGrant Goodeve is an actor best known for playing the oldest son on the TV series Eight Is Enough; he has also appeared on Northern Exposure and acted as the host for several TV series.

The theme song, performed by John Parr, became a huge radio hit.\n\nHey, it’s Carl Lewis! Oh, no. –It’s the old guy.\n\nCarl Lewis is a renowned track and field star who won nine Olympic gold medals over twelve years, the first in 1984 and the last in 1996.

Often known as just “The Dells,” the place became divided in 1908 into the Upper and Lower Dells when Kilbourn Dam was constructed on the Wisconsin River. The Dells is home to numerous waterparks, go carts, miniature golf courses, regular golf courses, and a host of other icons of wholesome family fun. “Ever been to The Dells? Let’s ride the ducks” came in at #7 in The Fifty Most Obscure References in The Amazing Colossal Episode Guide, referring to The Dells as “that paradise of water playlands, that miniature golf hot-bed…” The Tommy Bartlett Show, a water-skiing stunt exhibition founded in 1952, was one of the Dells’ main attractions; the show closed in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n[Sung.] Paige Sullivan ...\n\nA reference to the song \"Hymn for a Sunday Evening\" from the musical Bye Bye Birdie.

Backy?\n\nWacky tobacky is a slang term for marijuana.\n\nKari French! I bet she loves that dressing.\n\nFrench dressing is a type of salad dressing.

Pollard.\n\nClint Howard, brother of actor/director Ron Howard, got his start as a child actor and has since appeared in such films as Apollo 13 (1995) and Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997). Michael J. Pollard (born Michael J. Pollack Jr., 1939-2019) was an American actor whose best-known role is that of C.W. Moss in the 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde. With his nerdy, almost elfin appearance, he played more than 100 character parts in films and TV shows. Deep trivia: Canadian actor Michael J. Fox’s actual middle name is Andrew; to avoid having his name sound like “a fox” or the Canadian “eh?”, he changed it to Michael J. Fox in a tribute to Michael J.

The company also sells soil, weed killers, and other gardening products.\n\nThis movie’s making me nostalgic for the film Gymkata.\n\nIn 1985, world champion gymnast Kurt Thomas made an enjoyably bad movie called Gymkata, in which he goes to a country called Parmistan and wrestles a bunch of ninjas and fights off zombies armed with pitchforks so the American military can put in a missile base. Fortunately, the country has a lot of gymnastic equipment lying around that he can use to defeat the bad guys.\n\nDid you know that Nick went on to play Pong in his underwear while drinking beer?\n\nPong was one of the first, if not the first, video games.

The campaign was marked by bizarre incidents—at one point Perot dropped out of the race because he claimed his rivals planned to embarrass his daughter by pasting her head on photos of someone else’s naked body—and voters’ initial enthusiasm quickly waned.

In 1991, for example, Ted Kennedy and his nephew William Kennedy Smith were caught up in allegations that Smith raped a woman at their Palm Beach estate after meeting her in a local bar; Smith was eventually acquitted of all charges.\n\nRed-hot, uncensored Jami Gertz.\n\nJami Gertz is an actress who came to fame in the mid-1980s in such films as Less Than Zero and Sixteen Candles; her best-known role is as the half-vampire girlfriend in the 1987 film The Lost Boys.\n\nJust as long as Demi Moore doesn’t come out and start shaking her saline bags.\n\nDemi Moore is an actress, a member of the Brat Pack in the 1980s who later became known largely for her willingness to pop her top in such films as Disclosure (1994) and Striptease (1996).\n\nThey brought in David Mamet to punch up the dialogue.\n\nDavid Mamet is a playwright known for his stylized, staccato dialogue in such plays as Glengarry Glen Ross and Speed-the-Plow.\n\nStill, you could make a case that this is a better film than Road House.\n\nRoad House is a 1989 movie starring Patrick Swayze as a bouncer in a dive bar; it was one of the writers’ favorites.\n\nStand by for spit take.

A typical Pepe Le Pew cartoon has a hapless black and white cat somehow getting a white stripe painted/dyed down her back, and then being mistaken for a skunk by the amorous Pepe, who proceeds to woo her in a most vigorous and insistent manner. When Pepe was created, he was seen as a parody of the “French lover” stereotype (and in fact was based on the character Pepe Le Moke, played with panache by Charles Boyer in the 1938 film Algiers).
