        "text": "“This movie defies logic.”\n\n— Ian Jane, ROCK! SHOP! POP!\n\nHOBGOBLINS eat GREMLINS, GHOULIES, and CRITTERS for breakfast! Kevin just got hired to be the assistant night watchman at an old film vault. Warned to stay out of a mysterious chamber, the rookie guard can't help but satisfy his curiosity and unwittingly unleashes the Hobgoblins — furry aliens who grant people wishes only to kill them in the process! As the body count rises, Kevin and his pals track down the creatures before they wreak even more havoc on the city. An outrageous horror-comedy from filmmaker Rick Sloane (BLOOD THEATRE), HOBGOBLINS is a sleazy, neon-soaked riff on the “li’l beasties” wave of the 1980s that’s built for maximum fun."
