I haven't seen Hobgoblins 1 and I get the feeling this is a sequel in name only, because I was not lost for a second. These gremlins show up and feed on people's fear.\n\nI think the middle could have been cut some, and the ending given a little more shoulder room, but I found this to be an enjoyable B movie.\n\nAlso, poor Nurse Boobs didn't get to have boring MC's whoopie stick vulcanized…\n\nThose zany Hobgoblins are back! Its Hobgoblins 2: How the Dang Heck Did We get a Sequel Why Does Anyone Need to see our Cheap Floppy puppet Bodies Again?? Answer...I do! I need to see those floppy puppety bodies!\n\nI watched this for two reasons...the first: to see just how absurd and mind boggling a sequel to the low tier puppetploitation trashterpiece Hobgoblins could actually be. THAT TAKES PLACE 21 YEARS AFTER THE FIRST MOVIE And two: I needed to see if they actually fly their dang spaceship as promised on the cover of the first film but completely fraud its viewers by showing no such thing!\n\nSo basically you say Hobgoblins three times and they appear...a bunch of goofy…\n\nHobgoblin 2 (2009) is a movie I recently watched on Tubi. The storyline follows McCreedy from the first film locked up in an asylumn for his hobgoblins claim from 10 years ago. When another outbreak occurs that resemble his stories authorities may need his help to stop the hobgoblins.\n\nThis movie is directed by Rick Sloane (Blood Theatre) and stars Josh Mills (Death House), Chanel Ryan (BASEketball), Dan Glenn (Castle), Matthew Mahaney (Eraser) and Karen Knotts (Vice Academy 5).\n\nThis is a movie that doesn't take itself seriously in any way. This is more a comedy than horror. The comedic content is even more miss than hit than the first one. I will say the nurse in this is an…"
