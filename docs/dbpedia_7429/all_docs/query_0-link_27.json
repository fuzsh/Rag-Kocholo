        "text": "Post by thwhtguardian on\n\nCCF Movie Club!\n\nAugust's Theme: I can't drive 55\n\nFilms that feature iconic cars\n\nA few years ago, spinning out of the popular comic reading club shaxper created an event where CCF users chronicled their movie viewing with an added twist that each month would have its own unique theme. With October just around the corner I thought it would be fun to restart that old concept with the tried an true theme of Monster Mash!\n\nFor those who didn't participate during the last iteration, or members who have joined since the last iteration of the club disbanded the rules are simple:\n\n1) Create a starting post where you'll list the films you watch each month in something approaching the below format:\n\nOctober: Monster Mash\n\nThe Wolfman(1941, Universal)\n\nThe Exorcist (1973, WB)\n\nMonth:2\n\nTotal: 2\n\n2) You don't have to stop with a list, once the entries have all began feel free to discuss the films you've watched, favorite scenes or even full fledged reviews if you'd like.\n\n3) At the end of the month the user with the most films viewed(who didn't originate the theme) can either choose the next month's theme or choose a fellow poster to pick a theme.\n\n4) Most importantly, have fun! Watch as many or as few movies as you'd like or even none at all; there's no wrong way to play.\n\nPast topics and Winners:\n\nOctober: Monster Mash!(Winner:Shaxper)\n\nNovember: I'm Kind of a Big Deal(Winner: Brutalis)\n\nDecember: Tis the Season(Winner: Prince Hal)\n\nJanuary: Books to Film(Winner: Thwhtguardian)\n\nFebruary: Mystery From Outer-Space!(Winner:Brutalis)\n\nMarch: Laughter is the Best Medicine(Winner: Berkley)\n\nApril: European Cinema(Winner: Shaxper)\n\nMay: Journey into Mysteries(Winner: brutalis)\n\nJune: Dynamic Duos: (Winner: Shaxper)\n\nJuly: Adaptaions(Winner: Brutalis!)\n\nAugust: I Can't Drive 55(Winner: TBA)\n\nPost by thwhtguardian on\n\nHere we go again!

Already preparing myself as just bought the Universal Monster's Dracula and Creature from the Black Lagoon DVD collector sets this weekend. Bought Frankenstein, Mummy and Wolfman last year. Have several horror DVD's purchased after the Halloween season last year for marked down prices so I have plenty fear-fests to enjoy this season!\n\nDracula (1931, Universal)\n\nThe Thing From Another World\n\nBlack Scorpion\n\nSon of Dr. Jeckyll\n\nThe Mummy (Karloff)\n\nThe Blob (McQueen)\n\nGodzilla vs Destroyah\n\nCurse of the Undead\n\nReturn of the Vampire\n\nAbbott and Costello meet Frankenstein\n\nKong of Skull Island\n\nGodzilla, King of the Monsters (2019)\n\nKing Kong Vs Godzilla (Toho)\n\nHalloween (2018)\n\nThe Ghoul (Karloff)\n\nWerewolf, The Beast Among Us.\n\nHalloween original\n\nProm Night 1, 2, 4\n\nDracula. Spanish version (1931)\n\nThe Mummy's Hand\n\nBeetlejuice\n\nThe Frightner's\n\nScooby Doo on Zombie Island\n\nScooby Doo Returns to Zombie Island\n\nScooby Doo and the Curse of the 13th Ghost\n\nDisney's Ichabod Crane and the Legend of Sleepy Hollow.\n\nGargoyles (1972) Cornel Wilde, Bernie Casey\n\nJaws\n\nDeep Blue Sea\n\nThe Meg\n\nLeviathan\n\nDeep Star Six\n\nDracula Palance version\n\nDracula Langella version\n\nSlayer\n\nThe Mummy's Ghost\n\nAbominable Dr. Phibes\n\nReturn of Dr. Phibes\n\nTerror Train\n\nKiss Meets the Phanton\n\nFright Night\n\nTotal for month: 41\n\nSpecial Mention: 2 DVD Discs of Rod Serling's Night Gallery Season 2. One Piece Anime: the storyline where Brook the Skeleton joins up with the crew and go to Zombie Island to retrieve Brook's shadow and we see zombie creations galore along with a giant spider monkey that is wild and we have crazy wild Pirates versus Zombie fights!!!\n\nWatched Season 1 DVD's of American Gods. Including this just as watched within special mentions as it truly has many horror aspects to be found within the show and it keeps that dark tone throughout. Gonna go the same with the DVD's of Doom Patrol season 1 as it too has a dark and bloody attitude and treats the dysfunctional/handicapped heroes and villains as somewhat horrific examples of humanity.\n\nThe 2 weeks leading into Halloween I spent each morning having breakfast while watching an episode of Filmation's Sabrina the Teen Age Witch alternating with Groovie Ghoolies for some light cheer to begin the work days.\n\nHalloween night besides a pair of movies, I had to watch 2 episodes of 13 Ghosts of Scooby Doo. It's just NOT Halloween without the Doo!\n\nMonthly movie Total: 41\n\nNOVEMBER: I'm Kind of a Big Deal.\n\nThe Adventures of Robin Hood (1938)\n\nTreasure of the Sierra Madre (1948)\n\nWarner Bros Home Entertainment Academy Awards Animation Collection\n\nThe Quiet Man (1952)\n\nCrossfire (1947)\n\nMonthly movie Total: 5\n\nDecember: \"Tis the Season\n\nChristmas Cupid Arrow (2018)\n\nA Star for Christmas (2012)\n\nWhite Christmas (1954)\n\nChristmas at the Palace (2018)\n\nA Princess for Christmas (2011)\n\nDeck the Halls (2006)\n\nChristmas on the Range\n\nThe Santa Clause\n\nA Christmas Carol (1999)\n\nHoliday Inn (1954)\n\nFinding Father Christmas\n\nEngaging Father Christmas\n\nChristmas Carol.

Usually I'm fully in the camp of less is more when it comes to monsters on film, believing that the suggestion of a shadowy menace is much more effective than a full frontal gore fest...but here Nyby takes it to an extreme to where it's not even hinted, it all pretty much happens off screen and we're just told about it. Maybe if we never actually did see the creature that method would work, because I think the terrible creature effects(if you can even call rubbery nailed hands and a bathing cap creature effects) coupled with stoic reactions and descriptions of his menace make you notice that the creature isn't all that scary than if you never actually saw him first hand.\n\nStill there are a few creepy bits, the infant seedling army growing in the green house was effectively creepy and I did love the concept of a plant based alien life form. In the end, while definitely not my favorite horror movie and definitely not one I'd revisit all that often I think it was worth watching if only for the tension at the start.\n\nGrade:C\n\nPost by thwhtguardian on\n\nThe VVitch\n\n2015, A24\n\nSince first viewing this film by Robert Eggers two years back it has quickly become one of my all time favorite horror films. It's such a tense, thought provoking film that's just steeped in atmosphere and mood which is everything that draws me to the genre as a whole. From the very start when we first glimpse the deep woods after English settler William and his family are banished from the Plymouth Colony you just can't shake the sense of foreboding of that one, dead, white tree among the dark evergreens. It's wild and mysterious and the discordant notes that Mark Korven brings to the sound track when ever the characters look to the woods just adds to their unnerving nature. There are no jump scares here, or buckets of gore or even scary creatures, only a sense of dread that slowly builds in the pit of your stomach and spreads up along your spine to the nape of your neck that's created solely by play of shadows and light and the emotions of this puritanical family as they struggle against the wilds and themselves. Don't get me wrong, there are witches at the end and a demonic goat but it's everything that happens before then that leaves you feeling apprehensive.\n\nGrade:A+\n\nPost by brutalis on\n\nI started off with Dracula since it was showing on Svengoolie Saturday night. Sven and Universal go together like peanut butter and chocolate! It really struck me during this viewing of what an idiot Harker is portrayed as in this movie. Something I hadn't really noticed before is how much this 1931 Dracula would be right at home during the silent film era and that so much of the movies atmosphere and mood is done with lighting and \"over acting\" by everyone. Also it is interesting that none of the vampires are ever shown with fang like teeth and Lugosi never really does anything physically as Dracula and his menace comes from his ability to \"seem\" dangerous is more about his performance and those glaring mesmerizing eyes of his.\n\nComing up for viewing this week will be more black and white goodness in Them! and The Thing from Another World.\n\nPost by thwhtguardian on\n\nI started off with Dracula since it was showing on Svengoolie Saturday night.
