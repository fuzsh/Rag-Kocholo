        "text": "Introduction\n\nPeople forget that what made Hobgoblin cool was the mystery\n\nSigh.\n\nOkay, I’m gonna try and not let this run too long. Let’s see how than pans out shall we...(SPOILERS: I failed).\n\nI first heard this argument (or something akin to it) from Dan Slott back in 2007/2008 (well I heard it in 2012 but he said it in 2007/2008) and thought it was asinine back then. I have no idea if he was just lying or changed his mind about that given how he is now using Roderick Kingsley or if the fact that he has his own Goblin mystery (I’m not really following it so I’m not going to discuss how it pans/has panned out) is an affirmation of that belief.\n\nRegardless I’ve seen other fans, even ones I agree with on most things, argue that really Hobgoblin was ALL ABOUT the mystery and that there wasn’t much to him beyond that/he was cool because of it/he’s not really that good without that mystery.\n\nThis is just plain not true and I’m gonna prove it.\n\nIdentity Mysteries in Spider-Man suck!\n\nThe first thing to do before we dive into dissecting that statement is take a look at other examples in Spider-Man where there is a villain/character who’s identity is a mystery. If nothing else this provides good food for thought and context for our further discussions.\n\nThe fact of the matter is not only has the idea of having a Goblin themed mystery in Spider-Man been done to death by this point (it lost its charm at the very latest in the late 1990s with Green Goblin V) but let’s face it, NONE of the Goblin mysteries have ever been all that well handled or satisfactory.\n\nThe original Green Goblin mystery was, in terms of mystery writing, not that well handled given that there weren’t really any major suspects, at least not ones pointed out in the book itself. In fact the only genuine major suspect was Norman Osborn himself and he was only NAMED 2 issues before the reveal. Up until then he’d been a random background character that no one thought to suspect of being the Goblin because that isn’t how you handle a mystery.\n\nThe Bart Hamilton mystery was actually better handled but is kinda let down by the fact that Hamilton wasn’t a very good Goblin.\n\nThe original Hobgoblin mystery was friggin awesome but went on for too long and ended unsatisfactorily with the reveal of Ned Leeds (who was killed off panel and never confronted Peter of the truth).\n\nThe ‘mystery’ (if you can call it that) of the identity of Hobgoblin II (or III I suppose...or even IV technically) was revealed as Jason Macendale in the same issue it was set up in, i.e. ASM #289.\n\nGreen Goblin IV’s mystery was a subplot which played out over exactly two issues before being revealed as a character whom we’d never seen before: Phil Urich. It wasn’t a mystery it was a backdoor pilot (to a very good series but that’s beside the point).\n\nThe Green Goblin V mystery WAS interesting but was undermined by its utterly vile ending.\n\nWe’re still waiting to find out who the Hobgoblin from Nick Fury’s Secret War was and I don’t think even Bendis cares given that was set up over 10 years ago without much fanfare (and not in a Spider-Man comic).\n\nI’m not going to count the Grey Goblin at all because that was a mystery that involved Goblins but the dude didn’t BECOME a Goblin until we’d gotten all the answers. In fact it only became a Goblin related story WHEN we discovered Norman was involved in it\n\nEven though it’s BND and therefore not canon, the Menace storyline was actually not handled all that much worse than some of these other stories but it simply sucks by virtue of Menace/Lily Hollister herself being a crappy character. Ughh...\n\nThe Phil Urich Hobgoblin mystery doesn’t count all that much not only because it didn’t last all that long but because it wasn’t much of a mystery within the context of the stories themselves. It was more or less a mystery due to Marvel’s promotion tactics telling us we’re getting a new Hobgoblin\n\nI equally wouldn’t count the fact that the Hobgoblin who died in Slott’s run was actually Daniel Kingsley since more people were just assuming it was Roderick until the Danger Zone arc. Also its Post-OMD continuity so f*** that.\n\nEssentially NONE of the Goblin mysteries have been all that good. Hell MOST of the “Who is this character?” mysteries in Spider-Man have been unsatisfactory. The Stacy twins, F.A.C.A.D.E., Mad Jack, Mysterio II, Rose II, Blood Rose, Kaine (just because it was sooooo obvious), etc, etc. Hell, even the celebrated master Planner Trilogy blows the reveal of Doc Ock waaaaaay too early on.\n\nArguably the best examples of this type of story in Spider-Man were the reveals of the first Rose, Gaunt, the shadowy mastermind behind the Clone Saga, the third Rose, and best of all, the Jackal.\n\nWhilst the identity of the first Rose was changed against the wishes of his creator (Tom DeFalco) and revealed nonchalantly having it be Richard Fisk not only made a kind of sense but Fisk junior was also an interesting character considering his desire to take over the gangs in order to undo his father’s work yet he’s ultimately corrupted by that mission.\n\nThe third Rose being revealed as Jacob Conover was...well it was a good mystery in that the reveal had gravitas and the set up and clues were all there. I don’t think many people actually cared though. I think even DeFalco himself has claimed when he created the Rose the man under the mask wasn’t what he cared about all that much.\n\nWith Gaunt the reveal made sense but let’s face it how many people remembered this one random dude from ASM #37 or that root duplicate of him in a random issue of Spec?\n\nWith Norman it was a shocking reveal which made sense but was alas controversial and needed a lot of exposition.\n\nThe Jackal though was perfectly handled. The clues were there, the motivation was great and the reveal was shocking.\n\nCharacters should never be all about the mystery behind them\n\nThe line of thought in the statement at the top is...dumb.\n\nIt’s inherently dumb.\n\nIt’s dumb when you apply it to Hobgoblin. It’s dumb when you apply it to the Rose. And it’s dumb when you apply it to most characters whose identities are a mystery. It’s equating that the mystery is all that there is to those characters and once it’s revealed they not only become less interesting but that they’re basically done as characters.\n\nIt’s kind of the same mentality which has more or less led to us having how many different iterations of Ronin now? Ronin as a character is...actually he isn’t a character he’s a costume, an identity.\n\nWho is Ronin?\n\nThat’s basically the driving force of that ‘character’. Which is funny to me because a criticism Marvel has more than once levelled against DC went something like:\n\nWe don’t have costumes we have character development\n\nBecause as we all know Dick Grayson, Jason Todd, Tim Drake, Stephanie Brown and Damian Wayne are all basically interchangeable as characters and none of them, actually DEVELOPED whilst in the Robin identity right (huh....‘Ronin’ and ‘Robin’...).\n\nWe’ve then got to deal with the basic fact that it’s poor storytelling in long fiction like Spider-Man to invest everything into any kind of mystery to the point where once the reveal is done there is nothing left but to move on, or even worse to just do another mystery. Or worse still just do another mystery about the same character like Ronin. When you define a character wholly by the mystery surrounding them you’re setting yourself up for a fall unless you’re writing in the mystery genre (like an Agatha Christie story, but Spider-Man is in the super hero genre) or finite fiction (like a movie or novel, which also doesn’t apply to Spider-Man).\n\nTo give you an example of this, one of the more notable mysteries in geekdom from recent years was the mystery behind River Song, the on and off companion/love interest of the Doctor in ‘Doctor Who’. In 2008 she was introduced as a character from the Doctor’s future who had a personal connection to him. She dies at the end of the story but because this is a time travel show she reappears again in the 2010 episodes where her appearances once more tease out, but never give away, who she really is. The big truth ultimately came to light in the 2011 episodes ‘A Good Man Goes to War’ and ‘The Wedding of River Song’ which respectively revealed that River Song was the daughter of the Doctor’s companions Amy Pond and Rory Williams and that she was also in fact the Doctor’s wife. She then reappeared in a 2012 episode where there was little-to-no mystery about her and there are rumours of her reappearing again at a later date. She remains a fan favourite character.\n\nTo paraphrase the creator of River Song, Steven Moffat, one of the worst things to do with a mystery is to just reveal it and then have the audience go “Oh so that’s the answer”. You want your reveal to mean something going forward.\n\nTo give you another example perhaps closer to home, in the seminal story ‘Origin’ writer Paul Jenkins essentially resolved one of the most long standing mysteries in all of super hero comics: the origin of Wolverine. For years the history of the man named Logan had been shrouded in mystery. It was in fact a massive part of his character since he’d routinely go out to seek the truth about his past and encounter threats from it. So integral was Wolverine’s shadowy origins that the fact that he HAS a mysterious hidden past shows up in literally every single major media adaptation of Wolverine ever, including the ones which have been made AFTER his shadowy past was revealed.\n\nSo for a character that mysterious, for whom his mysterious past was THAT important surely Wolverine as a character would become less interesting and less popular right? Well he hasn’t. The opposite was probably true as Wolverine grew in popularity following the ‘Origin’ storyline. Despite the readers finally having the answers they’d been wondering about for 20-30 years, they still liked Wolverine and that was because as big a deal as the mystery was to his character it wasn’t all there was to him and he continues to thrive as a character over 10 years after ‘Origin’ was published. Indeed the reveal of the mystery added to his character and helped develop him further.\n\nWith all this in mind it would’ve been utterly stupid to basically set up the Hobgoblin and have him be all about the mystery of his identity because if that was what happened, then yeah once the mystery is over the character should’ve been retired. I’ll go into this a bit more later on, but that was NOT what was intended with the character. The character of the Hobgoblin was created by Roger Stern to replace the Green Goblin/Norman Osborn. He was never intended to be a finite character that’d be used up and disposed of once the mystery around him was resolved and as we’ll discuss later he clearly had qualities that’d assure he’d stick around.\n\nThe same thing can be said in fact of Norman Osborn himself. Neither Norman nor the Green Goblin character disappeared following the reveal and explanation of his identity in ASM #39-40. The story and reveal had ramifications since it meant that Norman was now a supporting character and a ticking time bomb for Peter since he knew at any moment Norman could become a villain again. Worse than that, a villain who knew his secret identity. But complicating matters further was the fact that were he to become a villain again then Peter would be placed in a moral dilemma since he’d be battling his friend’s father.\n\nBut it went beyond that. Because we know knew Norman, knew his back story, knew how clever and power mad he was since he became the Goblin, and got to see so much of him as a supporting character (especially through his relationship with Harry), Norman transcended the boundaries of the mystery which spawned him. He was a fully fleshed out character. The mystery generated a buzz about him but it was his personality which carried him through and immortalised him.\n\nI don’t think the majority of people who read Norman Osborn centric stories today feel that he’s just not that cool without the mystery or even primarily think about him in terms of that mystery. They think of him at worst as the guy who killed Gwen Stacy or at best the arch nemesis of Spider-Man. The initial mystery surrounding him is incidental, essentially just a footnote in Norman’s history. Something similar happened/should’ve happened with Roddy.\n\nHobgoblin was always popular\n\nLet’s now focus upon the character of the Hobgoblin more specifically.\n\nLike I mentioned above, that mystery (which allegedly mainly made Hobby cool) ran on for far too long, so to a large extent interest in the mystery was hampered before the big reveal. And the reveal in question suuuuuuuuuuuuuucked, which compromised the mystery overall (until they fixed it later on).\n\nAnd yet people still liked the Hobgoblin and still even after he ‘died’ regarded him as a popular villain (which considering he was derivative of another villain was impressive). To give you an idea of how popular and beloved Hobgoblin was, it was still a big deal in the 1980s/1990s whenever his crappy loser of a replacement Jason Macendale (a decent B or C-list villain unfortunately elevated above his station) showed up. For example, although it’s partially due to the Todd McFarlane art, ASM #312 is a fan favourite for many people because it’s the Green Goblin (well Harry) fighting the Hobgoblin (well Jason Macendale).\n\nHobgoblin’s popularity was such that essentially Marvel could trade off the name alone even though the character at the time was pathetic and, oh yeah, there wasn’t any mystery about him!\n\nSpeaking of Mister Macendale...\n\nJason Macendale\n\nI’m speculating here but perhaps people’s opinions about the mystery making Hobgoblin cool is influenced by what happened after the reveal. Maybe their line of thinking boils down to:\n\nHobgoblin was cool. But after we discovered who he was he was less cool. Therefore the mystery is what made him cool.\n\nIf that’s their mentality well...then that line of reasoning is inherently flawed for a lot of reasons. Let’s ignore how it sounds sadly similar to the whole “Spider-Man wasn’t as good after the marriage so it was Mary Jane’s/the marriage’s fault derp derp derp derp”, and instead focus upon two key reasons this argument doesn’t make sense.\n\nThe first one is that the Hobgoblin wasn’t the Hobgoblin. He was a different character altogether, so obviously he wasn’t going to be the same as before, even if the new Hobgoblin hadn’t been a loser. The second more relevant reason was that, for a lot of Macendale’s tenure as Hobgoblin, it was the early-mid 1990s.\n\nFor various reasons (mainly the speculator boom and later bust), during the 1990s a mentality of:\n\nQuantity over quality. Style over substance.\n\ndominated the comic book industry and thus led to bad writing, ill conceived ideas and the general compromising of various characters and franchises. Hobgoblin, like Spider-Man himself, was just one of many victims of this. And bear in mind I say all this as someone who grew up in the 1990s and honestly feels that decade of comics in far too over criticised (whilst the 2000s by contrast is not criticised enough but that’s another debate).\n\nThe Hobgoblin identity was already popular by the time the topes of the 1990s began to take hold and under these tropes and mentalities it inevitably lead to him popping up far more times than he should have (especially given how thin Macendale’s character was to begin with) thus leading to the character being seriously over exposed. What’s worse when he did show up, the focus was rarely about the quality of the stories, it was about the ‘cool’ artwork telling the stories or worse it was about seeing Hobgoblin and Spider-Man in ‘cool fights’ or doing ‘cool things’ that’d be stylish.\n\nHis appearances weren’t often all that character driven, or at least not driven by his character (I know he isn’t the leading man but he needed to have weight of his own). Exacerbating the situation sometimes when stories were driven by Macendale’s character, it was it either led to stupid developments (like Macendale becoming a demon because he got beat up by Harry Osborn) or it worked against Macendale.\n\nWhat I mean is, often a lot of good character driven writing highlights the main traits of the character in question. However the character in question was Jason Macendale and (at least in his Hobgoblin identity) his primary character trait was the fact that he was a f***ing loser, so essentially we got more than one story which pointed out how pathetic Macendale was. Want an example of a story like that? Try Amazing Spider-Man #289, i.e. Jason Macendale’s very first appearance as the Hobgoblin!\n\nWhen you debut a new villain that you want the audience to take seriously, the thing to not do is make them look like a joke.\n\nMaybe being a loser is a good and endearing character trait unto itself for some characters, but not when you’re supposed to be an A-list super villain and Spider-Man’s resident Goblin adversary. The role of the Goblin themed villain is an important one in Spider-Man’s rogue’s gallery. It comes with a lot of legacy and history behind it dating all the way back to ASM #14. Spider-Man SHOULD have a Goblin themed villain and they SHOULD be a tough customer or a big deal to Spider-Man in some kind of personal way. Yet Peter rarely mentioned how Macendale was responsible for the death of his friend Ned Leeds who was also his other friend’s ex-husband).\n\nAt best Macendale as Hobgoblin was essentially important to Spider-Man just because he was trading off the reputation of the real Hobgoblin (who himself was trading a bit off the reputation of the Green Goblin so Macendale was a third hand Goblin). At worst he was just a guy with a glider and pumpkin bombs Spider-Man punched occasionally.\n\nSo yeah...Hobgoblin did suck after the mystery was resolved. But it was because the man under the mask was no longer the same character and the character he actually was, sucked hard.\n\nHobgoblin and Me\n\nBut let’s get back to the real Hobgoblin.\n\nI’m sorry to do this because it is obviously not that objective but...I’m actually first hand evidence of how the argument that the mystery is what made Hobgoblin cool doesn’t hold up. Kindly bear with me because I need to take a trip on the nostalgia train to explain this.\n\nMy history with the Hobgoblin dates back to the 1994 Spider-Man cartoon where the Hobgoblin was a recurring villain (and also showed up before Green Goblin...whoops).\n\nIn that show Hobgoblin’s identity was a mystery but I didn’t know that when I began watching. For me as a little kid I never even thought about who was under the mask, he was just ‘the Hobgoblin’. Maybe I assumed we knew his identity but I’d just missed out or he was like the Shocker and we didn’t know who he was but it didn’t actually matter. Then Jason Phillips Macendale was introduced into the show as Felicia Hardy’s boyfriend who later became her fiancé. I had never read a Spider-Man comic by the time I saw all this play out (which was after its original airing, even in the UK where I’m from) so to me Macendale was just some rich dude dating Felicia.\n\nIn the episode ‘Goblin War’ I first became aware that actually the Hobgoblin’s identity was a mystery...and it didn’t really register with me. The idea of the episode was basically that the Kingpin was working with Hobgoblin and wanted to know his secret identity. Norman Osborn knew the truth thus Kingpin pressured Osborn to reveal it. At the end of the episode we discover that Macendale (who was still a loser in that show, albeit not as much) was the Hobgoblin and he was basically never seen again until the last two episodes of the show (but that was an alternate universe version of him so whatever).\n\nFor me as a kid though, the fact that Hobgoblin’s identity was a secret was almost an afterthought, it was not as important as the other stuff going on in that episode like Norman becoming the Green Goblin again, or Felicia and Spider-Man’s relationship.\n\nFor years after that I basically went around thinking Hobgoblin was Jason Macendale (if I could even remember the name) and that was that. It was a bit of trivia for me. It remained that way when I finally began reading Spider-Man comics but the Hobgoblin was pushed to the back of my mind as I learned more and more about the Green Goblins and the Osborns. Hobgoblin became trivial to me because he was just ‘that other Goblin’, and obviously I never knew about his convoluted comic book history.\n\nMy first comic book story with Hobgoblin in it was ‘Goblins at the Gate’ where Hobgoblin was this dude called Roderick Kingsley and he was in jail for some reason.\n\nI read the story and enjoyed it but it was mostly due to the fact that I was getting a Green Goblin and another Goblin on the same page together; how cool! But I never got much of a sense about Roderick Kingsley’s character, I just remember he was pretty much Norman’s whipping dog in the story and then retired on an island somewhere. I might also have vaguely been confused for a second about how this Kingsley guy didn’t look like the person from the TV show.\n\nTo give you a clue about how little I cared about his identity in either the show or the comic I assumed that his name on the show (it’d been awhile since I’d seen it) WAS Roderick Kingsley! Thus when I re-watched the show I was baffled that Hobgoblin didn’t look like the guy in the comics and he also didn’t have the same name (I think I chalked it up to the show screwing up).\n\nFor years after that Hobgoblin just remained that ethereal ‘other Goblin’ that I didn’t think about all that much. For me he was just kinda ‘there’. I didn’t have many emotions about him one way or the other. I just got a little bit annoyed whenever people mistakenly assumed Harry was the Hobgoblin because he wasn’t and I’m a hard ass for accuracy.\n\nThe only time he ever came off as at all relevant for me was when I read ‘Amazing Spider-Girl’ and he was a villain in that but even then for me he was nothing more than a villain filling the Goblin quota in Mayday’s rogue’s gallery. She’s a Parker thus needed a Goblin themed villain and with Normie Osborn reformed she didn’t have one. I vaguely recall thinking it was kind of clever to use an established Goblin rather than just use Fury the Goblin Queen because a distaff counterpart villain for another distaff counterpart hero is a bit lazy (although I like Fury for the record).\n\nThat’s how meaningless Hobgoblin’s identity and the mystery surrounding it was to me...\n\nThen just a few years ago I read the ‘Origin of the Hobgoblin’ trade paperback. I’d bought it and the ‘Hobgoblin Lives’ trade (which also reprinted ‘Goblins at the Gate’) on a whim but they languished in my room for a good long while.\n\nNow remember, apart from being utterly indifferent to the Hobgoblin character, I already KNEW Roderick Kingsley was the Hobgoblin going into these stories. And if I’d forgotten, the trade even gave me a massive clue by reprinting Roderick Kingsley’s very first appearances in Roger Stern’s ‘Spectacular Spider-Man’ run.\n\nAfter the ‘Origin of the Hobgoblin’ trade, I then read ‘Hobgoblin Lives’, ‘Goblins at the Gate’ as well as all of Roderick Kingsley’s appearances in the first volume of Spider-Girl (which I read after I read Amazing Spider-Girl). In Spider-Girl they also very clearly showed readers that Roderick Kingsley was the Hobgoblin, there wasn’t any attempt at secrecy. So there was categorically no way in Hell that the Hobgoblin mystery was ever a proper mystery to me. I knew the answers before and during the reading of all those stories.\n\nSo with all that I’ve said in mind, if the mystery was genuinely what made the Hobgoblin cool, if it was genuinely even just a big part of what made him cool, to the point where without the mystery he’s just less cool/interesting and essentially a useless character...why did I love those Hobgoblin stories?\n\nWhy did he become one of my top five favourite Spider-Man villains ever almost overnight?\n\nNo, seriously. Dan Slott, Steve Wacker, and everyone else who’s ever believed that the mystery was the main draw about Hobgoblin, why don’t you just try and answer my question?\n\nWhy did I love those stories and the Hobgoblin character, even though Norman Osborn (closely followed by Harry) are my absolute favourite Spider-Man villains and they’re the preeminent Goblin villains in Spider-Man’s rogue’s gallery? Surely Hobgoblin should be dull or uninteresting or just kinda ‘meh’ to me as a character if I knew who he was, and more than that I also know he’s derivative of at least one (arguably two, or even three if you count Bart Hamilton) other villains?\n\nOne could argue that maybe I like Hobgoblin just because I like seeing Goblin weapons, aesthetics and imagery in Spider-Man? Well in thinking about it, perhaps that’s partially true. But honestly...I just love Roddy’s character.\n\nHe’s bad ass (the dude was a novice but could hold his own against an experienced heavy hitter like Spidey).\n\nHe’s cold and calculating.\n\nHe’s smart and manipulative.\n\nHe’s ruthless, yet charming.\n\nHe’s well spoken yet cruel (but not sadistic/evil like Norman).\n\nAnd most of all in his right mind. I adore Norman and how bat$*** insane he is but Kingsley offers something different.\n\nThough there are aspects of him which are similar to Norman (the wealth, seeking to rule the gangs) he is very much his own man. And you get all that from him during Stern’s run when you don’t know who he is!\n\nHobgoblin’s merits outside the mystery\n\nWhen you think about it the fact that you get all those traits about Hobgoblin in Stern’s run makes a lot of sense. Stern was trying to create a character who could replace Norman Osborn as the resident Goblin. In attempting that goal, the idea that Stern (one of the greatest Spider-Scribes of all time) would be so short sighted as to make Hobgoblin’s character so thin that there was little to him beyond the mystery insulting.\n\nLook, I’m not going to deny that the Hobgoblin without the mystery wouldn’t have gotten people as excited or interested as they were. But at the same time, the idea that the mystery was all there was to the character or that in removing it you’ve compromised the character and made him ‘uncool’ is inherently asinine. The mystery was there to homage the original Green Goblin mystery and generate a buzz but when the dust settled, Stern intended Hobgoblin to stick around.\n\nIn addition to all those things I said about him above (him being a bad ass, cold, calculating, etc) in learning about Hobgoblin’s history I not only completely changed my mind on the character to the point where I now adore him, but I also now appreciate him in ways that I don’t appreciate Norman.\n\nFor instance I think he is in a way an extrapolation and improvement upon the Ditko era Green Goblin. He’s invested in gang land activity but it was played off in a more interesting way. Norman has kind of moved beyond that and is now the single driving negative force in Spider-Man’s life. Whilst Hobgoblin has made things personal for Spider-Man in many ways, he’s not on Norman or Harry’s level in that regard. He doesn’t know nor should he ever know that Peter is Spider-Man (which isn’t a bad thing).\n\nHe’s the Gangland Goblin Spider-Man can just fight and struggle with, kind of like Doctor Octopus. He’s basically the villain archetype Norman fulfilled before he switched his archetype in ASM #39 and became more invested in a personal blood feud with Peter. That was a good direction for Norman but it left that archetype of a Gangster Goblin just kind of lying there for a long time until Kingsley picked it up and excelled at it.\n\nHobgoblin also has distinct relationships with Peter’s supporting cast which Norman and Harry don’t. When Norman shows up things might get personal in regards to Flash because of ‘A Death in the Family’, but honestly Hobgoblin is also a big deal for Flash since he was heavily responsible for taking Flash to rock bottom by framing him. Whilst Norman has little to do with Betty Brant or Ned Leeds, Roddy helped contribute to destroying the Leeds’ marriage (though it was mainly Betty’s fault). Plus he got Ned killed and tarnished his name (which helped send Betty off the deep end). He’s personal bad news for the Osborns as he threatened Harry, Liz and the unborn Normie Osborn.\n\nHe also was kinda of an associate of Mary Jane’s for a long time and has more history with both Richard Fisk/the Rose as well as the Kingpin. These are all connections and relationships Norman doesn’t have and afford us different storytelling opportunities.\n\nThis isn’t even going into his potential in Spider-Girl. In the 1980s Hobgoblin was a novice yet still posed a major threat to an experienced hero like Spider-Man who’d been active for almost 10 years by that point. In Spider-Girl Hobgoblin has built upon the skills he displayed as a novice and has about 15-20 of experience behind him, making him far more dangerous than he was when he was first battling Spider-Man.\n\nSo, not only would Hobgoblin in Spider-Girl be a more dangerous villain generally, but he’s especially deadly for Mayday Parker. Again, as a novice he almost killed an experienced Spider-Man. As a more experienced veteran fighter he’s now fighting an inexperienced girl who’s only got at best two years of experience under her belt (and she’s not even as strong physically as her dad!). Essentially when Hobgoblin first fought Spider-Man Spidey struggled but was more than capable of winning. When Hobgoblin fights Spider-Girl, Mayday is doing everything she can to stay alive because of how outmatched she is so the stakes are even higher for her than for her dad.\n\nPlus it’s a more unique dynamic to have this teenage girl fight this middle aged man and to see them really go at each other. Neither one has any delusions about gender roles or thier different ages. They each just see one another as thier respective nemesis and do thier best to beat them. Had Spider-Girl’s series lasted longer her battles with Hobgoblin could’ve really showcased her growth since (as a young hero) she’d only get better and better with experience.\n\nAnother merit of Hobgoblin back in the 616 universe is the simple fact that by having two Goblins you can afford to be a bit experimental with one of them. Since Norman is so entrenched as Spider-Man’s arch villain and so linked with him it’d be harder and arguably rather detrimental to take him in directions too far removed from what he’s traditionally been. But with Roddy, you don’t have that problem (indeed he actually hasn’t actually been developed too much so there is plenty of room for him to grow).\n\nYou can take Roddy and do things with him as a Goblin you wouldn’t dare do with Norman and by doing that you thereby circumvent the actual main reason for why Kingsley was not seen for as long as he was. It wasn’t that without the mystery Hobgoblin wasn’t cool, it was because with Norman around it was harder to find a role for him as a Spider-Man villain. But his distinct relationships and persona to Norman enable him to stand out on his own and because Norman is there filling the main Goblin quota, Roddy can go off and do stuff Norman probably wouldn’t do.\n\nLet’s have Kingsley fight some non-Spider-Man villains.\n\nNow that Flash is Venom and has the power to get some payback let’s see a Hobgoblin/Agent Venom grudge match. If symbiotes hate fire and loud noises, surely a perfect obstacle for them would be pumpkin bombs which go boom and burn stuff?\n\nAnd if all else fails make him the resident Goblin villain for Kaine’s Scarlet Spider. C’mon Marvel you’ve got one character that riffs on Spider-Man by being more nuts and is also a legacy hero and you’ve got another character that riffs on Green Goblin by being less nuts and is also a legacy villain. This should be obvious!!!!\n\nConclusion\n\nSo, in conclusion:\n\nWas the mystery what made Hobgoblin cool?\n\nWas it a big part of what made him cool to the point where he was uninteresting without it?\n\nWas the lack of mystery a reason for his decline?\n\nIs there no role for him now that Norman is around?\n\nTo all the above: No."
