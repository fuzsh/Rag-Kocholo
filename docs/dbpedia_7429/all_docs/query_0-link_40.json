        "text": "A creature with many different looks\n\nIndeed, Pouk was a typical medieval term for the devil. For example, Langland once called Hell \"Pouk's Pinfold.\" And the Phouka was sometimes pictured as a frightening creature with the head of an ass. Truly a devil to behold. The Welsh Pwca also did not match our modern conception of dainty tinkerbell fairies. According to Louise Imogen Guiney, a peasant drew the Pwca as \"a queer little figure, long and grotesque, and looked something like a chicken half out of his shell\".\n\nAs a shape-shifter, Puck has had many appearances over the years. He's been in the form of animals, like how the Phouka can become a horse, eagle or ass. He's been a rough, hairy creature in many versions. One Irish story has him as an old man. He's been pictured like a brownie or a hobbit. In a 1785 painting by William Blake , he looks like Pan from Greek mythology. In a 1841 painting by Richard Dadd , Puck looks like an innocent child. And a modern cartoon show portrays him as a silver-haired elf.\n\nMaking mischief\n\nPuck used his shape-shifting to make mischief. For example, the Phouka would turn into a horse and lead people on a wild ride, sometimes dumping them in water. The Welsh Pwca would lead travels with a lantern and then blow it out when they were at the edge of a cliff. Being misled by a Puck (sometimes the legends speak of Pucks, Pookas and Robin Goodfellows in the plural) was known in the Midlands as being \"pouk-ledden.\"\n\nThat's a lot like the phrase Pixy-led, which described a similar action on the part of the Somerset faeries known as pixies. Some believe the term Pixy is derived from Puck. Yet another expression for being lost is \"Robin Goodfellow has been with you tonight.\" There's a reference to this at least as early as 1531.\n\nThe goblin named Robin\n\nRobin Goodfellow is one of the faeries known as hobgoblins or just hobs. Hob is a short form for the name Robin or Robert (\"the goblin named Robin\".) Robin itself was a medieval nickname for the devil. Robin Goodfellow was not only famous for shape-shifting and misleading travellers. He was also a helpful domestic sprite much like the brownies. He would clean houses and such in exchange for some cream or milk. If offered new clothes, he'd stop cleaning. There are stories of the Phouka and Pwca doing similar deeds.\n\nIronically, Reginald Scot wrote in 1584 that belief in Robin Goodfellow was not as strong as it had been a century earlier. In fact, Robin was about to get some big breaks in Renaissance show business.\n\nA Midsummer Night's Dream\n\nThe play is set in ancient Athens - although an Athens that closely resemble's Shakespeare's England - around the time of Duke Theseus's wedding to Hippolyta, the conquered queen of the Amazons.\n\nAn Athenian maid Hermia loves a youth named Lysander, but her father Egeus (and Theseus as well) demand that she marry another young Athenian named Demetrius. Lysander and Hermia sneak out of the city, telling only one person, their friend Helena.\n\nBut Demetrius used to love Helena, and Helena still loves him. So, to win back his love, Helena tells Demetrius where Hermia and Lysander have gone. Demetrius follows them into the woods, and Helena follows Demetrius.\n\nHowever, the woods outside Athens are inhabited by fairies. Oberon, king of the fairies, is feuding with his fairy queen Titania.\n\nOberon commands his servant Puck to obtain a magical flower that has the power to make anyone fall in love -- part of his plan to humiliate Titania. Puck transforms a local Athenian weaver and wannabe actor Nick Bottom, giving him the head of an ass. And it's this transformed Bottom that Titania first sees after being bewitched.\n\nThe fairy king sees Demetrius reject Helena, and he decides to intervene. He tells Puck to apply some of the love juice to the young Athenian's eyes. But Oberon fails to specify which Athenian. Puck douses Lysander instead, who then falls in love with Helena.\n\nWackiness ensues. Oberon wonders if was truly negligence on Puck's part \"or committâst thy knaveries willfully.\" Puck insists it was a mistake, but also delights in the chaos. He declares \"Lord, what fools these mortals be!\"\n\nEventually all is set right. Oberon and Titania reconcile. Demetrius announces his love for Helena, leaving Hermia free to marry Lysander.\n\nOh, and Puck removes the donkey's head from Bottom. Bottom joins his working class chums (\"the rude mechancials\") and they perform a play for the now triple wedding feast -- a comically bad play, which delights the guests.\n\nOnce all the other characters have left, Puck turns to us. He basically tells the audience the Elizabethan equivalent of \"Relax, kids, it's only a movie.\" He assures the audience if they didn't like the show he'll make it up to them soon, and concludes by asking for applause.\n\nThe ballads of Robin Goodfellow\n\nRobin Goodfellow appeared in more plays around 1600. And there were many 17th century broadside ballads about him. Click here to see two of these ballads. In these ballads, Robin Goodfellow is the son of Oberon, the fairy king, and a mortal woman. He pulls pranks, shape-shifts into various animals and the foolish fire known as the Will O' The Wisp, gets into trouble and does the kind of thing described in Shakespeare's play.\n\nRobin's trademark laugh is \"Ho Ho Ho!\" One 1628 ballad song may have written by Shakespeare's drinking buddy, the great Jacobean (in the reign of James I, the king after Elizabeth I) playwright Ben Jonson.\n\nAnd Ben Jonson certainly knew his tricksters. The Puck-Hairy or Robin-Goodfellow is a character in his unfinished Robin Hood play, The Sad Shepherd.\n\nRobin Goodfellow and Robin Hood\n\nThere may be a connection between Robin Hood and Robin Goodfellow. Many Pagans feel Robin Hood was originally a faerie or Pagan God. I think that case is overstated, as there is little magic in the earliest Robin Hood tales. But still, the two Robins have some things in common.\n\nBoth had a penchant for giving travellers a hard time. Puck was a shape-shifter, and Robin Hood a master of disguise. And Gillian Edwards notes that the Goodfellow in Robin Goodfellow's name could either mean a boon companion or thief. \"If you were one of Hood's archers and looked upon him as a boon companion, or the Sheriff of Nottingham and pursued him as a thief, you might consider him equally well-named Robin Goodfellow.\"\n\nSince the Robin Goodfellow ballads appear later than the Robin Hood ones, it's possible that the faerie may have taken his name from the outlaw -- not the other way around. (For more information on Robin Hood, please visit my Robin Hood website .)\n\nPuck in pop culture\n\nPuck continues to pop up in popular culture. For example, the six-foot tall invisible rabbit in the classic Jimmy Stewart film Harvey is said to be a Pooka. Of course, there are several movie and television versions of A Midsummer Night's Dream. A 14-year old Mickey Rooney was a youthful Puck, a wild child, in the 1935 film. Stanley Tucci played a much-older, somewhat wearier Puck in the 1999 film.\n\nStage versions of A Midsummer Night's Dream abound. Peter Brook's 1970 staging for the Royal Shakespeare Company, set in a sparse white box of a stage is considered a landmark in 20th century theatre. Paul Kane played Puck in the original run of Brook's Dream, and he relied on circus tricks for his fairy magic.\n\nThe play is a popular one for LGBTQ+ interpretations and Puck is often either openly LGBTQ+ or queer-coded. For example, Puck kisses Oberon in the 1996 RSC film and Oberon plants a firm kiss on Puck in the 2013 stage production from Shakespeare's Globe.\n\nAlpha Flight's Puck\n\nOne of the stranger Pucks has been Eugene Milton Judd aka Puck, a member of the Canadian superhero team Alpha Flight. This gruff yet good-natured former mercenary is named for both the Shakespearean imp and the hockey puck. (According to a letter in an early issue of Alpha Flight there may be a Shakespeare connection, although his creator writer/artist John Byrne maintains the hockey puck is the main influence.)\n\nJudd's acrobat stunts fit both types of Pucks. But whoever could ever see the Puck of legend with the boxer's cauliflower ear that the Marvel Comics' Puck has?\n\nIn 2004, Marvel briefly featured another Puck, the teenaged half-Japanese daughter of the original. Also, Hobgoblin is the name of another Marvel Comics character, one of Spider-Man's foes.\n\nThat issue by writer Neil Gaiman and artist Charles Vess was the first and only comic book to win the World Fantasy Award for Best Short Story. It was much deserved, and Puck made further appearances in the comic series -- most notably in The Kindly Ones story arc.\n\nAnd that trickster's appearances aren't limited to North American comics. The magazine Puck (from 1920-1936 by Amalgamated Press) featured a trio of tiny tricksters, Puck, Pot and Pan by Joe Hardman.\n\nIn the Korean comics - called manhwa or manwha, similar to Japanese manga - of the 1990s and 21st century, our rascal faerie appears again, well sort of. In the North American translations of Faeries' Landing by You Hyun (published by Tokyopop), the impish antlered and donkey-eared, sex-driven young man from Avalon who started the trouble is named Goodfellow. The European faerie references apparently come from adapting the original and similar Korean concepts to terms that would be more familiar to Western audiences.\n\nPuck on Gargoyles\n\nPuck is also a recurring character in the Disney cartoon Gargoyles. The role is voiced by Brent Spiner (Data on Star Trek: The Next Generation) with the appropriate wit and sarcasm.\n\nThis Puck also has a secret identity for most of the series as the corporate bad guy's faithful servant, voiced superbly by Jeff Bennett. As Puck observes of all the parts a trickster has played, never before has he been the straight man.\n\nThe Disney Puck has a surprisingly large fan following. When I first wrote this article, there were many websites dedicated to the trickster and his matter-of-fact alter ego, Owen. Some of them are churches. A church to Puck? I wonder what the Puritans would have thought.\n\nA Hobgoblin's legacy\n\nConcerning Hobbits -- and Harry: Dob, like Hob and Robin, was a short-form of Robert. So, Dobby the House-Elf from J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels takes his name from the hobgoblin-related legends as well. He certainly has some of the features of legendary hobs and hobgoblins.\n\nAnd if we are speaking of hobs, what about J.R.R. Tolkien's most famous creations -- hobbits? Undoubtedly, the Bagginses, Gamgees, Tooks and Brandybucks from Tolkien's 20th century novels (and 21st century films), The Hobbit and The Lord of Rings, must be distant cousins of the hobgoblin.\n\n(The older Bilbo Baggins in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings movies is played by Ian Holm who appeared on stage and film as Puck in variation productions of A Midsummer Night's Drean - you can read about one of them here.)\n\nPuck or Robin Goodfellow has had a long and colourful past. And judging from his recent appearances, he has a long and colourful future ahead of him too."
