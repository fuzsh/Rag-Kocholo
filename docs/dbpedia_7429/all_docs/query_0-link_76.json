        "text": "513: The Brain That Wouldn't Die\n\nby Wyn Hilty\n\n[Imitating.] He's not a gaffer, he's a G-A-F-er.\n\nAn imitation of beloved American actor Henry Fonda (1905-1982), who appeared in a series of commercials in the early 1970s for GAF (General Aniline & Film) products, makers of the popular View-Master line of 3-D transparency viewers. One of those commercials also featured Jodie Foster's acting debut. (Thanks to Sampo for this reference.)\n\nKinda looks like a Jenny Holzer piece to me.\n\nJenny Holzer is an American conceptual artist whose works have appeared in the Guggenheim Museum and the Hamburger Kunsthalle in Germany. She is known for projecting provocative images and phrases in public spaces.\n\nBut for Joseph Green there would come another film.\n\nAn imitation of a typically cheesy, overly dramatic announcer in any number of documentaries produced by NFL Films: “But for Vince Lombardi and the Green Bay Packers … there would come another day …”\n\nJust a normal Tuesday for Cher.\n\nCher (b. Cherilyn Sarkisian LaPiere) is a singer and actress who has appeared on various television shows and in films. She first rose to fame as the co-host of a series of TV variety shows with her then-husband, Sonny Bono. Over the years she has been the subject of outlandish rumors about the plastic surgery she has had done, thanks to her seemingly eternal youth. In 1988 a French gossip column published a rumor, which spread out of control, that she had had ribs removed to make her look thinner. Cher sued the publication and was examined by physicians, who confirmed that she had had her nose, breasts, and teeth worked on, but not her ribs.\n\nBreathe, stupid, breathe!\n\nAn imitation of Louie the parrot from the Looney Tunes animated short Dough Ray Me-ow, said to the dimwitted choking cat Heathcliff.\n\nWell, I’m gonna go get my Eggo out of the toaster oven. Anybody want one?\n\nEggo is a brand of frozen waffles that can be heated up in the toaster. They are manufactured by Kellogg’s. When they were introduced in 1953 they were called Froffles, a combination of \"frozen\" and \"waffles.\"\n\n“The corpse is yours.” Go in peace.\n\n“Go in peace” is a phrase that appears at the end of the Catholic (and other Christian sects) liturgy; the priest says it at the end of Mass to dismiss the congregation.\n\nGeez, this man had love in his tummy!\n\nA reference to the 1968 song “Yummy, Yummy, Yummy” by the band Ohio Express. Sample lyrics: “Yummy, yummy, yummy, I got love in my tummy/And I feel like a-lovin’ you.”\n\nLicense plate, a boot, tricycle wheel—this man was a bottom feeder!\n\nA reference to the “shark autopsy” scene in the 1975 film Jaws, in which oceanographer Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) cuts open a suspected man-eating shark and the contents of its stomach spill out, including a Louisiana license plate. Actual dialogue:\n\nChief Brody: He didn’t eat a car, did he?\n\nHooper: No (laughs), a tiger shark’s like a garbage can, it’ll eat anything. Someone probably threw that in a river.\n\n[Imitating.] Nothin' up my sleeve.\n\nAn imitation of Bullwinkle the Moose from his classic ‘60s animated TV show. In a series of short cartoons that ran before commercial breaks, Bullwinkle was performing magic, promising to pull a rabbit out of his hat. A lion, a tiger, and a bear appeared, but no rabbit.\n\nBzzt.\n\nOperation is a classic board game in which players use tweezers to remove “organs” from the “patient.” Brush the sensors on the side of the cavity and a buzzer sounds, ending your turn.\n\nHe’s only mostly dead!\n\nA line from the classic 1987 movie The Princess Bride, when Miracle Max (played by Billy Crystal) is diagnosing the unconscious Westley (Cary Elwes).\n\nIt's Gnip Gnop.\n\nGnip Gnop, or \"ping pong\" spelled backwards, was a table-top game released during the 1970s. (Thanks to Thomas Lakeman for this reference.)\n\n[Imitating.] Luke, join me or you’ll star in Corvette Summer.\n\nAn imitation of Darth Vader, a major villain with an assisted breathing machanism, in the Star Wars franchise. “Luke” is hero Luke Skywalker. The actor who played Luke, Mark Hamill, starred in a low-budget movie called Corvette Summer the year after the first Star Wars movie was originally released.\n\nBasting stitch.\n\nIn sewing, a basting stitch is a temporary, easily removed stitch.\n\nHey, you’re not my dad—you’re Hitler!\n\nAdolf Hitler (1889-1945), along with his toothbrush mustache, was the dictator of Germany during World War II (1939-1945).\n\nYou know, they’re doctors, but they do puppet shows, too. –Oh, Judy!\n\nJudy is the leading lady in the classic puppet show Punch & Judy. She is Punch’s wife, and is generally beaten to death during the course of the play.\n\nHumpty-backed camels …\n\nA line from “The Unicorn,” a song written by poet Shel Silverstein that became very popular in 1968 after it was recorded by the Irish Rovers. Lyrics: “There was green alligators and long-necked geese/Some humpty-backed camels and some chimpanzees/Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born/The loveliest of all was the unicorn.”\n\nTo boldly go where no man ...\n\nA line from the opening narration to the television series Star Trek, which aired from 1966 to 1969. The introduction, voiced by series star William Shatner, went like this: “To explore strange new worlds; to seek out new life, and new civilizations; to boldly go where no man has gone before.”\n\nI'll call them SnapTite limbs.\n\nSnapTite Build and Play models, made by the Revell company, are a line of easy to assemble plastic models of cars, aircraft, and spacecraft, many of which are models of vehicles from popular movie and TV franchises, such as Star Wars or Scooby-Doo.\n\nAnd I don’t want you reanimating anything, young man.\n\n“Herbert West—Reanimator” is a 1922 horror short story by H.P. Lovecraft. A 1985 horror/comedy film adaptation, titled Re-Animator, was followed by two sequels.\n\nYou taste like Vince Edwards.\n\nVince Edwards (1928-1996) was an actor best known for playing the title role on the television series Ben Casey, which aired from 1961-1966. He also appeared in a number of films and released six albums.\n\nSylvia Plath, R.N.\n\nSylvia Plath (1932-1963) was an American poet and novelist whose works generally dealt with themes of alienation, destruction, and death. Her most famous work was the semi-autobiographical novel The Bell Jar (1963), the story of a suicidal young woman’s mental breakdown. Plath suffered from severe depression and was hospitalized during college. She killed herself in 1963.\n\nCould you pee in the bell jar, please?\n\nSee previous note on Sylvia Plath.\n\nThe long, long trailer!\n\nThe Long, Long Trailer is a 1954 film starring Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz as a couple on their honeymoon in a trailer.\n\nSid and Nancy, American style.\n\nSid Vicious (born John Simon Ritchie; 1957-1979) was an English punk musician, bass player, and singer for the influential group The Sex Pistols. He was engaged in a mutually self-destructive relationship with Nancy Spungen (1958-1978). On October 12, 1978, Vicious claimed he woke up from a drug-induced blackout to find Spungen’s dead body in their shared apartment, killed by a single stab wound, courtesy of a knife owned by Vicious. He was arrested and charged with the murder, but before he could be tried he died of a drug overdose, which some believe was deliberate suicide. The story was told in the 1986 film Sid and Nancy, which starred Gary Oldman as Vicious and Chloe Webb as Spungen. Love, American Style was a show that aired from 1969-1974, which consisted of anywhere up to four short vignettes about love with various celebrity guest stars. Produced by Aaron Spelling, the series often used pieces of unused pilot scripts for the vignettes. On two occasions, discarded-pilots-turned-vignettes became full-on series: Wait Till Your Father Gets Home and Happy Days.\n\nChukkas to the floor—hurry!\n\nChukkas are men’s ankle-length leather boots introduced in the late 1940s. The name for the boots likely comes from the game of polo, in which a “chukka” was a period of play.\n\nNick Mancuso is Stingray.\n\nNick Mancuso is an actor who has appeared in dozens of films and television series. He starred in the short-lived TV series Stingray in 1985, playing Ray, a mysterious man who dresses in black, drives a Stingray, and helps people with their personal problems.\n\nA sign left by ancient astronauts.\n\nThe term “ancient astronauts” was coined by author Erich Von Daniken in his popular tome Chariots of the Gods?, in which he postulated that the pyramids of Egypt and other ancient monuments were built with extraterrestrial assistance. The ancient astronaut/architect theme was hammered hard in the TV series In Search Of … (syndication, 1977-1982), which was narrated by Leonard Nimoy.\n\nYou’ll enjoy the tight suspension of the Mercury Comet.\n\nThe Mercury Comet was a Ford model from 1960-77, similar to the Falcon or the Maverick.\n\nI think I’ll have a Papa Burger—you?\n\nThe Papa Burger is a mainstay menu item at A&W fast food restaurants in the United States. It features two beef patties, two slices of American cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, onions and \"A&W Papa Sauce.\" A&W used to also offer Mama, Baby, and Teen burger models, but those have been dropped from the menu. At A&W restaurants in Canada, however, the burger family still thrives, including the Grandpa Burger and the Cheddar Bacon Uncle Burger.\n\nMan, I want a pair of those chukkas.\n\nSee above note on chukkas.\n\nHoney, can we stop at Grandma [garbled]? Can we stop at The Turk’s Inn? Can we stop at The Big Steer? Can we stop at Cranberry Cove?\n\nThe Turk’s Inn was a classic, kitschy Midwestern Supper Club/steakhouse/Middle Eastern restaurant in Hayward, Wisconsin that was in business for 80 years before closing its doors in 2013. A couple of native Minnesotans bought as much of the décor, furniture (including a large curving bar) and signage as possible, and recreated The Turk’s Inn in the Brooklyn neighborhood of New York City in 2019. The Big Steer Restaurant and Lounge was a family diner at a truck stop in Northfield, Minnesota; it closed in 2019. Cranberry Cove may be a reference to a former resort outside Eagle River, Wisconsin. (Thanks to Krista Hiner for the Big Steer reference.)\n\nIs he chasing James Dean?\n\nJames Dean (1931-1955) was an iconic young film actor and teen heartthrob who made his reputation playing bad boys and delinquents, as in his archetypal role in Rebel Without a Cause. He assured himself of film immortality by dying young in a car accident outside Cholame, California.\n\n[Road sign: “Winding Road.”] Wow, that was my prom theme.\n\n“The Long and Winding Road” is a 1970 ballad written by Paul McCartney that appears on the Beatles’ album Let It Be. Over the years, the song became a popular theme for proms and graduation ceremonies. It was produced by the famed and troubled Phil Spector, who added his trademark “Wall of Sound” to it, including lush orchestration. McCartney was so infuriated by this he included “The Long and Winding Road” as one of his six reasons for legally dissolving The Beatles the following year. Sample lyrics: “The long and winding road/That leads to your door/Will never disappear/I've seen that road before.”\n\nWhat’s this? Our fanatical physician and his fickle fiancee? Speeding to their country cottage?\n\nAn imitation of the announcer from the 1966 TV series Batman, starring Adam West. The announcer, who was voiced by executive producer William Dozier, led into commercial breaks with similarly portentous phrases.\n\nMrs. Webb, you're doing very well, Careful now, Mrs. Webb. Stay—you're over the center line, Mrs. Webb!\n\nFrom reader Mike Dumas: “This is from a classic standup comedy routine by Bob Newhart, in which he plays a harried driving instructor. It was featured on his chart-topping 1961 album The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart.”\n\nWe now join Barefoot in the Park, already in progress.\n\nBarefoot in the Park is a Neil Simon play, written in 1963, about two newlyweds who move into their first apartment after the honeymoon. In 1967 it was made into a film starring Robert Redford and Jane Fonda.\n\nLook out, look out, look out! [Sung.] Leader of the pack ...\n\n“Leader of the Pack” is a 1964 pop song written by George \"Shadow Morton, Jeff Barry, and Ellie Greenwich, that became a #1 hit for The Shangri-Las. The song was a mix of spoken word and sung lyrics, telling the story of a girl witnessing and mourning the death of her motorcycle-riding boyfriend.\n\nDiarrhea is like a storm raging inside you.\n\nA paraphrase of a line from an old Pepto-Bismol ad: \"Sometimes, diarrhea can feel like a storm raging in your body.\" The ad used the voiceover over a rumble of thunder (to dramatize intestinal discomfort).\n\nWell, he shouldn’t have eaten at Jack in the Box.\n\nJack in the Box is an American chain of fast food restaurants. In 1993, hundreds of people, mostly in the Northwest, became ill after they were exposed to the E. coli bacteria in tainted hamburger meat sold at the restaurant; several children died. The resulting outcry almost destroyed the company, but it's since bounced back.\n\nHi, I’m William Proxmire. How you doing? Put ‘er there.\n\nWilliam Proxmire (1915-2005) was a Democratic senator from Wisconsin who served in Congress for 32 years before retiring in 1989. He was best known for creating the Golden Fleece Award, which he used to highlight wasteful government spending.\n\n[Imitating.] Oh, thank you, God. Thank you so bloody much!\n\nThis is a line from the classic British TV comedy Fawlty Towers (BBC2, 1975 & 1979), frequently spoken by the ever-frustrated hotel owner Basil Fawlty, played by John Cleese.\n\nRiggins is at the 20 … He’s at the 10 … No one will catch him.\n\nA reference to former Washington Redskins running back John Riggins, who played for the team from 1976-1986, except for a brief hiatus in 1980 due to a contract dispute. He was voted MVP of Super Bowl XVII in 1983, the Redskins' first Super Bowl championship, when he ran 43 yards for a touchdown to take the lead in the fourth quarter.\n\nHe’s either gonna win the Nobel Prize or the Heisman Trophy.\n\nThe Nobel Prize is actually six prizes (physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, economics, and peace) awarded annually for the greatest intellectual achievements of that year. The fund for the prizes was established in 1895 by Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite. The Heisman Trophy is awarded every year to the outstanding college football player, as determined by a poll of sportswriters; it is named after player and coach John Heisman.\n\nHey, it’s Johnny Tremain.\n\nJohnny Tremain is the eponymous hero of the children’s book by Esther Forbes. The novel tells the story of a young boy during the Revolutionary War, whose hand is deformed in an accident.\n\nOkay, pencils down. How much did you risk? Oooh ...\n\nRiffing on the award winning TV game show Jeopardy!, which has aired on various networks or syndication since 1964, with various hosts, the best known being Alex Trebek, who hosted from 1984 until his death in 2020. The gameplay involves contestants standing at lecturns, who use light pens to write down wagers and/or answers, which appear on screens mounted on their lecturns.\n\nThis will give my Pinot Noir the tawny nose I've been looking for.\n\nPinot Noir is a varietal of red wine grape that originated in the Burgundy region of France, and is now grown around the world, generally in cooler climates. In the parlance of wine tasting, “nose” simply means how a wine smells.\n\nSo is it honey he’s putting in the KC Masterpiece sauce?\n\nKC Masterpiece sauce is a barbecue sauce available in grocery stores around the country; it was invented by a Kansas City psychiatrist named Rich Davis.\n\nDude, he’s wiring his lab for quad! –Pro Logic.\n\nQuadraphonic sound was an early version of surround sound. Introduced commercially in 1970, quadraphonic systems used four speakers instead of the usual two used in stereo sound systems, and were meant to play recordings mixed specifically for quadraphonic systems. Various attempts were made to broadcast quadraphonic audio over FM radio stations in the 1970s as well. Plagued by technical problems and compatibility issues, quadraphonic sound was a commercial failure, but it laid the groundwork for the 5.1 surround-sound systems that are widely used in home theaters today. Pro Logic is a surround-sound system developed by Dolby for home theaters.\n\nMan, I am tearing through the Brawny.\n\nBrawny is a brand of paper towels manufactured by Georgia-Pacific; it has a hunky lumberjack mascot on the wrapper.\n\nI bet he’s gonna turn her into Mrs. Olson!\n\n“Mrs. Olson” was a pitchwoman for Folger’s coffee in commercials that aired during the 1960s and 1970s. She was played by actress Virginia Christine.\n\n[Sung.] Maxwell House jingle.\n\nDespite the previous Folger’s reference, this is an old ad jingle for Maxwell House coffee from the 1950s. It was a peppy, musical interpretation of the sound made by old fashioned coffee percolators, and the commercials showed percolators bubbling away.\n\nOh—you put the lime in the coconut and drink it all up! –Hmm. You say doctor.\n\nA paraphrase of Harry Nilsson’s song “Coconut.” Actual lyrics: “She put de lime in de coconut, she drank 'em bot' up/She put de lime in de coconut, she call the doctor, woke 'im up/And said 'Doctor, ain't there nothin' I can take?'”\n\nIt’s Darkman.\n\nDarkman was a 1990 film starring Liam Neeson as a scientist whose face is destroyed in a lab explosion and must don masks made of synthetic skin.\n\nDone! Now time to make my own Baileys.\n\nBaileys Irish Cream is a liqueur made from cream, cocoa, and Irish whiskey.\n\nThis is the most complicated beer bong I’ve ever seen.\n\nA beer bong is a device that enables a drinker to swallow a vast quantity of beer very quickly. There are a number of variants, but a beer bong generally consists of a funnel and a length of flexible tubing. Gravity plays a role. Beer bongs have long found a home at college campus parties.\n\nAn American in vitro.\n\nThis is a variant on An American in Paris, a 1951 movie musical starring Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron that was inspired by the George Gershwin composition by the same name.\n\nThey saved Sister Bertrille’s brain.\n\nSister Bertrille, played by Sally Field, was the “flying nun” in the TV series of the same name, which ran from 1967-1970. The phrase is a parody of the terrible 1968 TV movie They Saved Hitler’s Brain.\n\nBoss, you’ve broken the goofy meter again.\n\nAn imitation of Max, the chauffeur/butler/etc. of the Harts on the ABC mystery series Hart to Hart. He was played by Lionel Stander.\n\nShe talks like Clutch Cargo. –Clutch.\n\nClutch Cargo was a 1959 animated TV series that attempted to eliminate the time and expense of drawing lip movements by simply filming the voice actors’ lips through a megaphone and superimposing them onto the animated characters, with truly bizarre results.\n\n“Transplant her to what?” Larry Storch.\n\nAmerican actor Larry Storch (1923-2022) was best known for playing Corporal Agarn in the TV comedy series F Troop (ABC, 1965-1967) and as a voiceover artist in dozens of cartoons.\n\n“She had a heart, and a brain.” And da noive.\n\nIn the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy and her companions sing wistfully together about how they wish they had, in turn: a brain, a heart, a home, with the Cowardly Lion lastly wishing for \"the noive,” or nerve (bravery).\n\nC’mere—I’ve got a great idea for a practical joke. Put her neck in water.\n\nAn age-old prank, popular with adolescents at slumber parties or summer camp, involves placing a sleeping person’s hand in a bowl of warm water, supposedly making them wet the bed.

While he enjoyed professional and critical success, he was perennially hounded by the tax man and had a serious drinking problem, which led his marriage into difficulties. Legend has it that he died after a particularly heavy drinking binge, but in reality pneumonia got him in the end.\n\n[Moulin Rouge.] Hey, he walked all the way to Paris. The Moulin Rouge, which is the name of the sleazy cabaret in this film, was originally a French cabaret hall.

Today’s special is Salisbury steak and German potato salad.\n\nPossibly an imitation of vaudeville and early film sex symbol Mae West (1893-1980), who kept her blonde hair piled high and favored lots of feathery boas. A staple of school lunchrooms everywhere, Salisbury steak is made from minced beef formed into the shape of a steak, served with gravy or brown sauce.

Her work is disturbing, not least because it is impossible to tell whether the photographer is sympathetic or condescending toward her subjects. Arbus committed suicide in 1971.\n\nA night on the town in Escanaba, Michigan.\n\nEscanaba is a city on the upper peninsula of Michigan, population about 12,000.\n\nJojo was a man who thought he was a woman.\n\nThis is a paraphrase of a line from the 1969 Beatles song “Get Back.” The actual lyrics: “Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner/But he knew it couldn’t last.”\n\n[Imitating.] The spokesmodel competition!\n\nOn the 1980s TV talent show Star Search, hosted by Ed McMahon (imitated here), one of the categories contestants could compete in for a $100,000 prize was “Spokesmodel.”\n\nRocky Graziano!\n\nRocky Graziano (1919-1990) became the world middleweight boxing champion in 1947.

Let’s go!\n\nSnuff films, an urban legend, are purportedly movies in which one or more persons are actually killed on film. The legend dates back to a film called Snuff, released in 1976, which tacked an ending of an actress supposedly being killed onto a 1971 horror film called Slaughter; producer Allan Shackleton attempted to arouse interest in the cheaply made film by implying that the deaths in it were real. People everywhere bought into the hype, although the legal system forced Shackleton to add a disclaimer to the film stating that no one had been harmed during the making of the movie. By that point, however, the legend had taken on a life of its own. Even today, anti-pornography crusaders cite snuff films as the ultimate example of male oppression and exploitation of women, despite a total lack of evidence for their existence.\n\nWait for me! [Laughter.]\n\nAn imitation of 1970s game show mainstay Charles Nelson Reilly (1931-2007).\n\nUm, Mr. Graziano, can I have your autograph?\n\nSee previous note on Rocky Graziano.\n\n[Sung.] I’m getting sentimental over you ...\n\nFrom the song of the same name, written by George Bassman and Ned Washington and recorded by Tommy Dorsey in 1935.

This is a paraphrase of the Monty Python sketch “Wink Wink, Nudge Nudge,” in which a man in a pub torments a respectable chap with endless strings of innuendo. Sample lines:\n\nMan: Evening, squire!\n\nSquire: (stiffly) Good evening.\n\nMan: Is, uh, ... Is your wife a goer, eh? Know whatahmean, know whatahmean, nudge nudge, know whatahmean, say no more?\n\nSquire: I, uh, I beg your pardon?\n\nMan: Your, uh, your wife, does she go, eh, does she go, eh?\n\nSquire: (flustered) Well, she sometimes “goes,” yes.\n\nMan: Oiii bet she does, I bet she does, say no more, say no more, knowwhatahmean, nudge nudge?\n\nMeanwhile, at Kurt Cobain’s house ...\n\nKurt Cobain (1967-1994) was the lead guitarist and singer for the Seattle grunge rock band Nirvana, widely acknowledged as one of the most influential musical groups of the 1990s.

It is considered by many as one of the greatest fights of all time.\n\n“You’re all alike.” [Elvis imitation.] Well, thankyouverymuch. An imitation of singer and cultural icon Elvis Presley (1935-1977). “Thank you very much” was a phrase Elvis frequently used, usually at the end of a song while applause thundered. He often said it very quickly with the words all tumbled together. This, of course, led to it being used in impressions of him for decades.\n\n“I still hate all men.” Except Donny Most. –He's funny.\n\nDonny Most (or Don Most, as he’s now known) played Ralph Malph on the television sitcom Happy Days, which aired from 1974-1984.\n\n“I trusted a man once. All the way!” A Jet!\n\nA riff on “Jet Song” from the 1957 Broadway musical and 1961 movie West Side Story. The relevant lyrics by Stephen Sondheim: “When you’re a Jet/You’re a Jet all the way/From your first cigarette/To your last dyin’ day.”\n\n“How can I forget?!” You’re no man to me, mister!\n\nA paraphrase of a line from the Star Trek episode “Who Mourns for Adonais?” Kirk’s actual line: “If you want to play god and call yourself Apollo, that’s your business. But you’re no god to us, mister!”\n\nThat’s the last time I get in a car with Monty Clift, I’ll tell you that.\n\nIn a widely publicized incident, actor Montgomery Clift (1920-1966), who appeared in such films as A Place in the Sun and From Here to Eternity, ran his car into a telephone pole after leaving a party at Elizabeth Taylor’s house in 1956. He was badly injured and had to undergo reconstructive surgery on his face before he could resume his film career.\n\n[Sung.] There’s a place for us ...\n\nA line from the song “Somewhere,” from the Leonard Bernstein musical West Side Story. Sample lyrics: “There’s a place for us/Somewhere a place for us/Peace and quiet and open air/Wait for us/Somewhere.”\n\nI just thought of a funny Carrot Top bit I saw.\n\nCarrot Top (real name Scott Thompson) is a prop comic known for his wild, curly, clown-red hair, and for a series of AT&T television commercials. Since 2005 he’s had a headlining show at the Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas.\n\n“I've been knocked around so many times.” What’s one more? “I’ve lost count.” She must have lived with Ike Turner. Ike Turner 1931-2007), along with his wife Tina, performed a popular R&B act in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 1975 Tina divorced Ike and launched a stunningly successful solo career. Years later she wrote about the violent abuse she endured during their marriage.\n\nAnd I believe in Crystal Light.\n\nCrystal Light is a low-calorie drink mix, similar to Kool-Aid. The line is part of a marketing slogan used during the 1980s: “I believe in Crystal Light 'cause I believe in me.”\n\nThe calls are coming from inside the house!\n\nA classic urban legend dating back to the early 1960s has a teenage babysitter taunted by repeated calls from a madman; when she reports the calls to the phone company, the operator traces the call and tells her frantically to get out of the house: “The calls are coming from inside the house!” The 1979 movie When a Stranger Calls is based on this tale.\n\n“Again! Hit it again!” [Chanted.] Harder, harder! –Hit it again, harder!\n\n“Hit ’em again, harder, harder, harder” is a popular football chant that got its start at the University of Wisconsin thanks to the popularity of fullback Pat Harder, who played there in 1941 and 1942. His achievements included a 17-7 win over the national champion Ohio State Buckeyes, a game in which Harder scored all 17 points. His college career was interrupted by World War II, when Harder enlisted in the Marines in 1943. When he left the military in 1946 he went pro, joining the Chicago Cardinals and then the Detroit Lions.\n\n“A head without a body.” Is like a day without sunshine.\n\n\"A day without orange juice is like a day without sunshine\" was a marketing tagline/jingle for Florida orange juice, delivered by Miss America runner-up and super-Christian Anita Bryant in the late 1960s and 1970s. The extremely successful ad series came to an end when Bryant became embroiled in a controversial hate campaign against gays, who she famously warned were out to “recruit our children.” Her excesses led to a boycott of Florida OJ, and the growers dropped her as their spokesperson. (Thanks to Dean Dierschow for this reference.)\n\nAll I need is a kimchi pot.\n\nKimchi is a traditional Korean dish composed of fermented sliced vegetables—usually cabbage—and seasonings. Part of the tradition is to ferment and store kimchi in a clay pot, which is kept buried underground to keep it out of summer heat and winter cold.\n\n“A mere head in search of a body.” Is that a Pirandello play? –I think so.\n\nSix Characters in Search of an Author is a 1921 play by Italian writer Luigi Pirandello. An absurdist metafictional play, it centers on six fictional characters interrupting a rehearsal for a play and begging the director to help them finish their story. At its premiere Pirandello had to flee the theater through a side door to avoid the unruly crowd, but later audiences were much more appreciative.\n\n“I? Imagine?” [Sung.] All the people living in …\n\nA line from the 1971 John Lennon song \"Imagine,\" which was his biggest solo hit. Lyrics: \"Imagine there's no heaven/It's easy if you try/No hell below us/Above us only sky/Imagine all the people living for today ...\"\n\nHe feeds it Science Diet.\n\nScience Diet is a brand of specialized pet food produced today by Colgate-Palmolive. It was created in the 1960s by veterinarian Mark Morris for a seeing-eye dog with kidney disease.\n\nYou know, I keep expecting Ruth Buzzi to poke her head through there. –That would be terrifying.\n\nComedian Ruth Buzzi was a regular on Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In, a sketch comedy series that ran from 1968-1973. Her most famous role on the show was Gladys Ormphby, a hairnet-sporting spinster with a lethal handbag. One of the regular features on Laugh-In was the “joke wall,” a wall with small windows cut into it. At the end of the show, the cast members would swing open the doors that covered the windows and tell quick one-liners and jokes through the openings.\n\nOh, no, White Fang, no! –Ellu ellu ellu ellu. –Please, not the custard pie, no!\n\nOn The Soupy Sales Show (see above note), White Fang was “the biggest and meanest dog in the USA.” You never saw all of White Fang, though, just a huge paw that came in from one side of the screen. Fang spoke in growls and grunts, which Soupy was somehow able to translate into English. The custard pie in the face was Soupy's specialty—he once estimated he had been the recipient of twenty thousand pies over the course of his career—and Fang was often the one throwing them when Soupy did or said something pie-worthy.\n\nOh, it’s Boog Powell!\n\nBoog Powell was a great first baseman for the Baltimore Orioles from 1961-1974. He stood 6’4” and weighed 230, and he was a slugger, logging many seasons with more than thirty home runs.\n\nI guess you’d call that a farewell to arms.\n\nA Farewell to Arms is a 1929 novel by Ernest Hemingway about an American expatriate serving in the ambulance corps of the Italian Army in World War I, and his love affair with an English nurse. The book, Hemingway's second novel (after The Sun Also Rises), was a best-seller, and established his reputation as a modern American novelist.\n\nLooks like the Father Knows Best house. –Except for the blood. –Bud … Princess … help me …\n\nFather Knows Best was originally a radio show that later made the jump to television; the TV version aired from 1954-1960. It starred Robert Young as family man Jim Anderson and Jane Wyatt as his wife Margaret. Elinor Donahue, Billy Gray, and Lauren Chapin played the three children: Betty (also known as “Princess”), Bud, and Kathy. The house was located on the Columbia Ranch; it was originally built to serve as the house in the “Blondie” serials; later it was the Wilson house in Dennis the Menace and Major Nelson's home in I Dream of Jeannie as well as the Anderson home in Father Knows Best.\n\nNow he’s gonna write “Piggy” on the wall with his stub.\n\nOn the night of August 9, 1969, Los Angeles was rocked by a string of seven horrific murders, among them a young actress named Sharon Tate, who at the time was eight months pregnant by her husband, director Roman Polanski. The murders were committed by members of the “Manson Family,” a counterculture group living on the Spahn Ranch and led by the charismatic Charles Manson, apparently because they were hoping to start a race war. As part of their attempt to \"stage\" the scene of the crime, one of the killers wrote the word “pig” on the front door of Tate's house in the young woman's blood. (A couple of weeks earlier, members of the family had killed an acquaintance after failing to extort money from him and, in a similar scene, had written “Political piggy” in his blood.) Ultimately, five members of the “family” were convicted of the crimes, including Manson. They were sentenced to death, but the following year the sentences were commuted to life in prison. Susan Atkins died in 2009, Manson in 2017 at age 83; the others are still behind bars.\n\nMitchell!\n\nA reference to Show 512, Mitchell, and star Joe Don Baker's drunken, heedless approach to police work in that movie.\n\nThis jacket was a Burberry, I’ll have you know.\n\nBurberry is a British high-end fashion house founded in 1856, most famous for its iconic trench coat, although it also makes a complete line of clothing, accessories such as scarves and umbrellas, and even its own fragrance.\n\nGeez, Edmund Kean didn’t have death scenes like this.\n\nEdmund Kean (1787-1833) was an English Shakespearean actor in the early 19th century, widely considered one of the greatest actors of his day. He played all the great Shakespearean heroes—Hamlet, Othello, Richard III, King Lear—as well as more contemporary roles. Kean restored the original tragic ending to King Lear, which for centuries had been saddled with an artificial happy ending that saw the villains punished and Cordelia happily married off to Edgar. Kean's tempestuous personal life—lawsuits brought by cuckolded husbands, performances spoiled by drunkenness—did nothing to dim his fans' adoration. He collapsed into his son's arms during a performance of Othello in March 1833 (his son, also an actor, was playing Iago) and died a few weeks later. There have been several plays written about Kean's life, including one by Jean-Paul Sartre and another by Alexandre Dumas.\n\nWomen without bodies who hate men without arms, and the men … you know.\n\nA reference to the venerable self-help book Men Who Hate Women & the Women Who Love Them by Susan Forward and Joan Torres.\n\nThe Ropers: the final episode.\n\nHelen and Stanley Roper (Audra Lindley and Norman Fell) were the suspicious landlords on the TV sitcom Three’s Company. In 1979 the Ropers got their own TV series, which ran for two seasons.\n\n“I’ll be right back.” With a Milwaukee Sawzall.\n\nThe Sawzall is a brand name for a reciprocating saw, or an electric saw that cuts in a back-and-forth motion. It is manufactured by the Milwaukee Electric Tool Corporation, founded in 1924 and headquartered in Brookfield, Wisconsin.\n\n[Cuban accent.] Lucy, I’m home—Lucy, oh my God!\n\nAn imitation of Desi Arnaz (1917-1986), a musician and actor who played Ricky Ricardo on I Love Lucy, the iconic 1951-1957 sitcom. Arnaz and Lucille Ball were married on the show and in real life (until they divorced in 1960, anyway).\n\n[Sung.] You don’t bring me torsos …\n\nRiffing on the song “You Don’t Bring Me Flowers,” which was a monster hit for Neil Diamond and Barbra Streisand in 1978. The song was originally written (by Neil Diamond with Alan and Marilyn Bergman) in a shorter form as the theme song for the failed sitcom All That Glitters, but wound up not being used when the show went in another direction. Diamond and Streisand originally recorded the song separately, but a Nashville radio station program director spliced the two versions together as a going-away present for his wife (the two had recently divorced). The combined version proved to be a hit, and Streisand and Diamond agreed to record an official version, which promptly leapt to the top of the charts. The song lyrics tell the story of a couple who have drifted apart.\n\nWhat, did Van Cliburn just walk in?\n\nVan Cliburn (1934-2013) was a virtuoso American pianist. In 1958 he won the first ever International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow, at the height of the Cold War, a feat that was so celebrated that on his return to New York he was honored with a ticker tape parade.\n\n[Sung.] I’m gonna fly in a beau...[Spoken.] Hey, 5th Dimension, how appropriate.\n\nI believe Crow is singing a line from the 5th Dimension song “Up, Up and Away,” but he didn’t get the words right and he can’t carry a tune, so I can’t be a hundred percent sure.\n\nFrom Hollywood’s Pantages Theatre!\n\nThe Hollywood Pantages Theatre is an Art Deco theater in Hollywood, located at the corner of Hollywood & Vine. It was built in 1930 and originally showed movies and held live vaudeville shows. Starting in 1977 it closed down the movie side of its business and became a live theater venue, hosting music shows and stage shows. Well-known performances have included Les Miserables, Wicked, and The Lion King. The riff follows a drum roll, which is probably a reference to the fact that from 1950-1960, the Pantages hosted the Academy Awards—including the first televised ceremony in 1953.\n\nTime for Sleaze Through the Night, here on KPORN.\n\nMusic Through the Night is a late-night classical music program broadcast on many NPR affiliate radio stations.\n\nAh love this place!\n\nA tagline from Burger King TV ads that aired in the early 1990s; they featured MTV personality Dan Cortese, and a flurry of fast-edit movement just before he says the line.\n\n“You put something in my drink!” Oh, honey, it’s just Snapple.\n\nSnapple is a brand of bottled teas and juices. They were introduced in 1972 and are now available in eighty countries around the world.\n\nWas it grenadine? I love grenadine!\n\nGrenadine is a tart/sweet syrup with a dark red color used in mixing alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. It was originally made by mixing pomegranate juice, sugar, and water, but commercial grenadine is commonly made with artificial flavors. Drinks made with grenadine include the Tequila Sunrise (tequila, orange juice, and grenadine) and the Shirley Temple (ginger ale, orange juice, and grenadine).\n\nThere’s a good grab souvenir for some lucky fan.\n\nAn imitation of Harry Caray (1914-1998), longtime sports announcer. He spent 25 years with the St. Louis Cardinals, eleven with the Chicago White Sox, and then sixteen with the Chicago Cubs.\n\nIt’s your new body! [Cheers.]\n\nAn imitation of game show announcers, particularly on The Price Is Right, when the stage doors would part and reveal “A new car!”\n\nWell, enough yappin’. I’d better get at it.\n\nA riff on the opening of the 1984 “mockumentary” This Is Spinal Tap, in which “documentary filmmaker” Marty DeBergi (played by director Rob Reiner) concludes his introductory remarks with “But hey, enough of my yakkin’; whaddaya say? Let’s boogie!”\n\nFirst, how 'bout a Pop-Tart, huh?\n\nPop-Tarts are a brand of ready-made pastries that you heat in the toaster. They are manufactured by Kellogg’s. They were created when, in 1963, Post unveiled their premade pastries called Country Squares. Post wasn’t ready to mass-produce theirs, but Kellogg’s managed to develop and crank out Pop-Tarts just six months later in 1964. In the early 1990s, several house fires were caused by Pop-Tarts being left in the toaster too long. Pop-Tarts boxes actually carry flammability warnings.\n\nI put a Libbyland dinner in here. It saves time.\n\nLibbyland TV dinners were frozen dinners aimed at kids that were sold from 1971-1976. Their mascot was Libby the Kid (Billy the Kid spelled backwards ... sort of), who outwitted Mean Gene to deliver tasty frozen food to kids around the country in his TV commercials. The meals had cutesy names, like “Safari Supper” and “Pirate Picnic,” while the cuisine leaned heavily on kiddie standards like hot dogs, fish sticks, and burgers. The packaging included puzzles for kids to solve while they ate, reminiscent of kids’ menus in family-friendly restaurants, and under the food in each section of the divided tray was embossed a friendly smiling character, to reward the child for cleaning his or her plate.\n\nI’ve got some Wart-X here. I hope it works on the whole head.\n\nWart-X is an OTC wart removal treatment.\n\nMicrowave Brenda Vaccaro.\n\nBrenda Vaccaro is a Broadway and film actress who has appeared in such films as Midnight Cowboy (1969), Airport ’77, and Zorro the Gay Blade (1981).\n\nSuper-Skrull gonna jump out and bite me?\n\nSuper-Skrull is a supervillain in the Marvel comics universe, usually found attempting to thwart the Fantastic Four. There are multiple Super-Skrulls, all hailing from the Skrull homeworld; the original, whose real name is Kl’rt, had all the powers of the Fantastic Four, plus shapeshifting and hypnosis. The character first appeared in Fantastic Four #18, in 1963.\n\nPatty Hearst.\n\nPatty Hearst is the granddaughter of tycoon publisher William Randolph Hearst. She was kidnapped and brainwashed by a militant guerrilla group, the Symbionese Liberation Army, and adopted the new name of “Tania.” After she helped the group rob a bank at gunpoint, she was arrested and charged with bank robbery. Despite testimony that she was a victim of brainwashing, she was convicted and sentenced to 35 years in prison; President Jimmy Carter later commuted the sentence and she was released after 22 months. A poster for the 1988 film Patty Hearst, about the heiress’s kidnapping, showed the actress’s head with the title across her mouth like a strip of tape.\n\n[Three thumps.] Point! Of! Law!\n\nAn imitation of the opening of “Point of Law,” a legal radio segment hosted by Charlie Boone that aired for more than fifty years on Minneapolis radio station WCCO, from 1952 until Boone retired in 2010.\n\nYou have a kind face.\n\nPossibly a reference to the 1980 David Lynch film The Elephant Man. There is no such exact line in the film, although John Merrick (John Hurt) frequently refers to various characters as being “kind” and at one point says “You have been so kind to me.” The voice used here sounds similar to the strange, slurred speech Hurt adopted for the character.\n\nOh, geez, I should have used stronger bolts. Pat Summerall, you betrayed me!\n\nGeorge Allen “Pat” Summerall (1930-2013) was a football player in the NFL in the 1950s and later did color commentary for CBS Sports and for a few years on Fox. For many, many years he shilled on commercials for the hardware chain True Value, with the catch phrase “Tell ’em Pat Summerall sent you”—hence the riff about the faulty bolts. (Thanks to Kenneth Morgan and Brian Sweat for this reference.)\n\nEw, Boo Radley.\n\nBoo Radley is the recluse the children are obsessed with in the novel To Kill a Mockingbird, written by Harper Lee in 1960. He emerges from his house at the very end to save the kids from a knife-wielding man bent on revenge.\n\nDoes this bug you? Does this bug you?\n\nAn often-used MST3K catchphrase and a possible reference to something U2 lead singer Bono said in the 1988 concert film Rattle and Hum: “Am I bugging you? I don’t mean to bug ya.” Or it's just a reference to the timeless sibling torment of almost, but not quite, touching, tickling, or punching another sibling, and when a complaint is made, saying \"What? I'm not touching you!\"\n\nMarble. Edges light quickly.\n\n“Edges light quickly” is an old advertising slogan for Kingsford, a brand of charcoal that has been around since the 1920s.\n\nThat is one bad McNugget. Ewww.\n\nChicken McNuggets are fried chicken bits served at McDonald’s fast food restaurants. They come in four shapes: bell, ball, bowtie, and boot."
