        "text": "I remember this making for a pretty good MST3K episode. I always loved when they would watch (at the time) recent stuff. That seemed to be a Mike thing, whereas Joel was more of a classic B-movie guy. Not a hard and fast rule by any means but just a trend I noticed as a kid. Personally, I started watching in the mid/late 90s and so I'm always gonna be a Mike guy. Huge respect to Joel, and I love a lot of his episodes, but at the end of the day Mike's my guy. I hope the internet's cooled down about this in the 23 years since I first logged on.

I read that in college. I've been to college. Ummmmm\n\nI really want to shoutout an I'm sorry/I'm wrong to MST3K...not like, because I like the show any more than I did last week because to be perfectly honest, I have the entire internet to give me trash movie suggestions. Sorry if that offends 'older people' or whatever but there's only so many times millennials can apologize for being born.\n\n(Sorry the apology to MST3K is coming.) Because although I have the entire internet, what I thought was a simple search 'Hobgoblins movie band' (because I forgot…"
