        "text": "After Deadline examines questions of grammar, usage and style encountered by writers and editors of The Times.\n\nIt is adapted from a weekly newsroom critique overseen by Philip B. Corbett, the deputy news editor who is also in charge of The Times’s style manual. The goal is not to chastise, but to point out recurring problems and suggest solutions.\n\nSince many writers wrestle with similar troubles, we think these observations might interest general readers, too.\n\nSome Rules That Aren’t\n\nReaders of After Deadline are not shy about describing their own usage peeves. They frequently find fault with elements of Times style, and they’re quite willing to offer constructive criticism of my prose as well.\n\nA few points of usage have prompted recurring questions. I thought I’d take a moment to explain my view on a handful of these points — not to shut off the debate, but to keep it going.\n\nNone: Singular or Plural?\n\nMany readers of The Times and After Deadline insist that “none” should be used only with a singular verb. They argue that “none” means “not one,” and so is inherently singular.\n\nBut most authorities, including The Times’s stylebook, disagree. Here’s our entry:\n\nnone. Despite a widespread assumption that it stands for not one, the word has been construed as a plural (not any) in most contexts for centuries. H. W. Fowler’s Dictionary of Modern English Usage (1926) endorsed the plural use. Make none plural except when emphasizing the idea of not one or no one — and then consider using those phrases instead.\n\nBeginning With “But” (or “And”)\n\nAnother pet peeve of some After Deadline commenters is the use of “but” or “and” to begin a sentence — as in the third sentence of the previous section. Obviously, I don’t share their aversion.\n\nIt shouldn’t be overdone, but using coordinating conjunctions this way can provide a handy and very efficient transition. “But” is certainly preferable in many cases to the stilted “however,” and “and” is simpler than “in addition” or similar phrases.\n\nI’d put this objection in the category of “Miss Thistlebottom’s hobgoblins.” That’s how the former Times language guru Theodore M. Bernstein described overly fastidious rules and usage myths a grade-school English teacher might invoke to keep her pupils’ prose on a very narrow path. (Familiar examples include “Never split an infinitive” and “Never end a sentence with a preposition.”)\n\n“Since” and “Because”\n\nI’ve been surprised at the number of readers who take me to task for this sentence in the standing introduction to After Deadline: “Since many writers wrestle with similar troubles, we think these observations might interest general readers, too.”\n\nThese correspondents say the sentence should begin with “because”; they insist that “since” should be used only in a temporal sense, never with a causal meaning.\n\nI don’t see any basis for this objection. As a preposition, “since” always has a temporal sense (“since last summer”). But every reference work I’ve consulted agrees that as a conjunction, the word can carry either sense. The only caveat is to avoid situations where the meaning might be ambiguous: “Since he quit the club, we haven’t invited him to any outings.”\n\nData: Singular or Plural?\n\nYes.\n\nThat is, The Times’s style manual allows “data” to be construed as either singular or plural.\n\nI gather that some faithful After Deadline readers find this permissiveness hard to stomach. Still, many of these Latin plurals ending in “a” seem to make a slow transition to singular use in English. “Agenda” has made the switch completely (not to mention “opera”). On the other hand, our stylebook continues to insist on “media” as plural — “The news media have followed the story intently” — though it is used more and more as a singular elsewhere.\n\n“Data” seems to be to be midway in the transition process, and our treatment of it reflects that status. Here’s our stylebook entry:\n\ndata is acceptable as a singular term for information: The data was persuasive. In its traditional sense, meaning a collection of facts and figures, the noun can still be plural: They tabulate the data, which arrive from bookstores nationwide. (In this sense, the singular is datum, a word both stilted and deservedly obscure.)\n\nI’m not a linguist or a lexicographer, but I suspect that one factor influencing the plural or singular use of such words is whether the original Latinate singular is still in common use. No one refers to a single entry on a to-do list as an “agendum.” On the other hand, “medium” is still routinely used to describe, say, television as opposed to print, which argues for continuing to use “media” as a plural.\n\n“Datum” is still used occasionally in technical contexts, but seldom elsewhere. As it fades, it leaves room for “data” as a singular — however much the traditionalists wince.\n\nRead previous After Deadline posts »"
