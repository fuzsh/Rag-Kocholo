        "text": "Night of the Lepus\n\nLock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\n\nhavent thought of Night of the Lepus in years......love Lock Stock and Two Smoking barrels!\n\nRory Breaker: What did you shoot him with, an air rifle?\n\nWinston: Look, we grow weed. We're not mercenaries.\n\nRory Breaker: You don't say.\n\n\"Hatchet\" Harry: You must be Eddie, J.D.'s son.\n\nEddie: Yeah. You must be Harry. Sorry, didn't know your father.\n\n\"Hatchet\" Harry: Never mind son, you just might meet him if you carry on like that.\n\nSoap: Rory Breaker? That psychotic black dwarf with an Afro?\n\nTom: That would be the same man, yes.\n\nBig Chris: All right, son: roll them guns up, count the money, and put your seat belt on.\n\nSoap: A minute ago this was the safest job in the world. Now it's turning into a bad day in Bosnia.\n\nEddie: They're armed.\n\nSoap: What was that? Armed? What do you mean armed? Armed with what?\n\nEddie: Err, bad breath, colorful language, feather duster... what do you think they're gonna be armed with? Guns, you tit!\n\nthere are a whole lot better ones but they arent suitable for this forum :grin:\n\nMore!\n\nWOW!\n\nNice list you've all got going there! I have seen half or more of them, and it is nice to see\n\nthat others have also appreciated their unique qualities!\n\nIt's hard to think of something not already listed.... I apologize if someone already mentioned these:\n\nI might add Time Bandits, Something Wicked this way Comes, and one more mainstream: American Beauty.\n\nFor a bit more Camp/bizarre, I would add Time Bandits, Mars Attacks & Brazil.\n\n(Perhaps easier to follow than Naked Lunch was!...well, Brazil is a bit wacked too tho!)\n\nFor barely stupid fun, Killer Clowns from Outerspace.\n\nMy All-Time Favorite has to be Forbidden Planet!\n\nA great movie of Matrix quality, but only for its underlying phylisophical concept. :devil:\n\nIt is a movie (unlike most) that would actually benefit by being remade!\n\n[As the Matrix (original movie) is based on the premise that the world around us is not simply the \"concrete reality\" we perceive that it is. (an idea which some philosophies and \"off-mainstream religious beliefs\" have followed since eons ago) ]\n\nForbidden Planet isn't \"great\" by any means, but I like movies that are a bit \"Perceptive\",\n\nas the first Matrix and the first Star Wars movies were.\n\nI would have to say those types of movies are the ones I like best for more than just pure entertainment (ie: Lord of the Rings/Harry Potter/Stardust),\n\nwhich are GREAT entertainment,\n\nbut I also love when a movie presents some philosophy that touches revealingly on life itself.\n\nWell, I do hope others have more input, as I am jotting down some other movies I've NOT seen before, and might just want to see!\n\nNice thread! Better than I thought it would be! (I passed over looking at it for a while, for lack of time and such.)\n\nTake care all!\n\nPaul\n\nGrowin' Old!\n\nFrom the \"So bad its brilliant\" file..\n\nThe Warriors..\n\nCAN...YOU...DIG...IT...\n\nNumber 1 movie I thought I would love, but hated:\n\nHitchikers Guide to the Galaxy..\n\ntotally sucked..biggest movie disappointment of probably my entire life..\n\nNumber 1 movie I thought I would hate, but loved.\n\nTank Girl..\n\nI was expecting to hate the movie, because I loved Tank Girl in her original form..\n\nI was a huge fan, had every issue..and thought the movie would be bad..\n\nbut it was ok..\n\nIf you are a Tank Girl fan, you have to check out Gorillaz:\n\nhttp://www.gorillaz.com\n\nI like them mostly just for the Jamie Hewlett animation, but the music isnt bad either!\n\nthe videos are very fun..\n\nScot\n\nYes, David Cronenberg's Naked Lunch was rather unfortunately an amalgamation of most of William Burroughs' writing and didnt really follow the book Naked Lunch much at all. Most of that stuff never happened in any Burroughs book. I still like it, a lot, but maybe it should not have been given the name Naked Lunch. I wish someone would do all Burroughs' books as film verbatim. The studio who did would probably be locked down and \"silenced\" with flamethrowers by the religious right after the first few though...\n\nI thought Tank Girl would be lame too but i was surprised as well. C'mon Ice Tea as a six foot rat man? How good could that be!? lol!\n\nwell, Brazil is a bit wacked too tho!)\n\nAh yes Brazil was great. And you remind me of 2 other great oddball movies:\n\nCity of Lost Children\n\nDelicatessen\n\nFor barely stupid fun, Killer Clowns from Outerspace.\n\nBarely stupid fun describes it perfectly\n\nNumber 1 movie I thought I would love, but hated:\n\nHitchikers Guide to the Galaxy..\n\ntotally sucked..biggest movie disappointment of probably my entire life..\n\nCould not agree with you more, the new one totally sucked. If you can get your hands on the BBC one it is not half bad, pretty much follows the books (up to \"So Long...\" which had not been published when it was made so...)\n\nDude, not even. The Carpenter one was awesome.\n\nBecause I am feeling generous I will let you live...\n\nI'm surprised the other two in the trilogy weren't mentioned alongside Brazil: Timebandits & Baron Munchausen\n\nDelicatessen as mentioned and anything else by Jean-Pierre Jeunet is definitely weird... even Amelie & especially City of Lost Children\n\nEdward Scissorhands was mentioned, but obviously anything by Tim Burton is definitely weird too! Kinda old now, but I still love Beetlejuice! And Nightmare before Christmas is a classic, too much singing but still way cool.\n\nFantastic Planet is an artsy & weird movie, Yellow Submarine is kinda weird too I would say. On the subject of artsy & weird animation, works by Yuri Norstein are must-see. Tale of Tales is certainly \"huh?\"\n\nFor TV series The Prisoner is pretty weird too. Especially that big white blob!!\n\nI'd forgotten about Apocalypse Now, it's such a marathon of a movie! 2 VHS tapes!\n\nIf you liked Spinal Tap check out Mighty Wind, it's the Tap guys doing a 60's folk music mockumentary as The Folksmen. I just got my copy on DVD today (don't have to watch the partly taped over copy I have on VHS with commercial interruptions) been digging the geeky tunes and all the extra scenes. I was raised by hippies so I have a soft spot for this music, other people my age seem to find it intolerable! lol!\n\nAnd if you liked \"Mighty Wind\" and \"Spinal Tap\" then you should check out Fear of a Black Hat which is to hip hop what the former two are to folk music and metal."
