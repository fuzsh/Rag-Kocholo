        "text": "SALT LAKE CITY â€” Al Jefferson did not practice this morning with the Utah Jazz.\n\nThe Jazz center was experiencing a sore left hamstring, so he only stretched but did not go through Utah's only practice session of the day.\n\nBig Al's availability for Saturday night's intrasquad scrimmage is unknown.\n\nUtah also went without free-agent acquisition Josh Howard. The small forward is expected to arrive in Salt Lake City tonight and hook up with the team at Saturday morning's practice after taking a deal-sealing physical.\n\nPoint guard Jamaal Tinsley, however, did practice again and is on the mend after missing three practices this week due to stomach flu. The veteran, who is trying to revive his NBA career, tried to practice through his illness when it initially hit him earlier this week, but was advised against it by the Jazz training staff.\n\n\"It was pretty bad,\" Tinsley said. \"(I'm) trying to just get over it right now, trying to get my legs back under me.\"\n\nJazz coach Tyrone Corbin credited Tinsley for playing well in this camp and for trying to, well, gut it out under tough circumstances.\n\n\"He understands the sense of urgency for him, and how hard he wants to show his best basketball and he's done that,\" Corbin said. \"He's played well, showed himself well, it's unfortunate he got sick.\"\n\nTinsley is battling with former Jazz player Keith McLeod and Villanova product Scottie Reynolds for a possible third point guard position on Utah's roster."
