        "text": "ROY — Lyle Smith, a longtime friend and neighbor of mine who's a very knowledgeable sports fan, came up with an interesting idea a few days ago.\n\nSmith posed this question: What if you took 12 to 15 former Utah Jazz players who were on NBA playoff rosters this year and put ’em up against the current Jazz roster?\n\nWho'd win that matchup? Hmmmm …\n\nPicture this: A possible ex-Jazz-players starting lineup of Deron Williams, Wesley Matthews, Paul Millsap, Marvin Williams and Enes Kanter, backed up by Devin Harris, Kyle Korver, DeMarre Carroll, Kris Humphries and Al Jefferson. And down on the end of the bench, there are veteran pros like Mo Williams, Randy Foye, C.J. Miles, Richard Jefferson and either Brandon Rush, Ian Clark, Jeremy Evans or Bryce Cotton — take your pick.\n\n\"Get Jerry Sloan to coach ’em,\" Smith said of the former Jazz players, \"and I think the older guys would sweep a series from (Quin) Snyder and the young'uns.\"\n\nVery possibly.\n\nMillsap averaged 17.1 points, 9 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game this season for Atlanta, which has reached the Eastern Conference semifinals, while Deron Williams (14.1 ppg, 5.8 apg), Matthews (12.5 ppg), Kanter (12.7 ppg, 8.1 rpg) and Marvin Williams (11.7 ppg, 6.4 rpg) all averaged double-digit scoring for their respective playoff teams this season.\n\nSure, the current Jazz team's likely starting lineup of Dante' Exum (assuming he's fully recovered from last year's devastating knee injury), Rodney Hood, Gordon Hayward, Derrick Favors and Rudy Gobert might have some advantages in a couple of places.\n\nBut let's face it, those younger guys would certainly have their hands full with Deron Williams and Matthews, who both now play for Dallas, and Millsap and Kanter, who have all shown their ability to rub it in Utah's face at times since leaving here.\n\nOf course Kanter complained and whined his way right out of Utah — and into a huge contract with the Oklahoma City Thunder. And a few years back, it appeared highly unlikely that Deron Williams was going to stay with the Jazz when he became a free agent, so the Jazz dealt him away and got Favors and Harris in return.\n\nWith Al Jefferson (12 ppg, 6.4 rpg in Charlotte), Carroll (11 ppg and 4.7 rpg in limited playing time with Toronto due to injuries) and either Korver (9.2 ppg, 3.3 rpg in Atlanta) or Miles (11.8 ppg in Indiana) as the first four ex-Jazz guys off the bench, this team definitely wouldn't have any trouble putting points on the scoreboard.\n\nSo, some people would rightfully ask, why did the Jazz either let all those former, highly productive players leave via free agency or trade them away?\n\nThe answer, of course, is money.\n\nUtah's team payroll for this past season was a shade under $65 million, well under the NBA salary cap of $70 million for all of its players.\n\nThe ex-Jazzmen's \"starting five\" of Millsap ($19 million), Kanter ($16.4 million), Matthews ($16.4 million), Marvin Williams ($7 million) and Deron Williams (an under-market-value $5.5 million) made roughly $64.3 million this year — nearly as much as Utah's entire team payroll.\n\nThrow in some pretty high-priced guys like Al Jefferson ($13.8 million), Carroll ($13.5 million) and Korver ($5.7 million), and you'll quickly find several million reasons why the Jazz simply couldn't hang on to all of those former Utah players over the years.\n\nYep, it's just too expensive.\n\nIn fact, if you add up last season's salaries for the top 15 former Jazz guys on this year's playoff rosters, it comes in at over $120 million — almost double what Utah's total team salary was in 2015-16.\n\nAs to a matchup between Jazz players past and present, I'm not gonna say the current roster would get demolished. Maybe their defense could find a way to contain those older players. Then again, maybe not.\n\nMillsap's the one guy on that list that they probably wish was still here, because he's blossomed as an All-Star performer ever since leaving Utah. But the Jazz front office chose to let him leave so Favors could play more, learn and flourish.\n\nBut Jazz fans will have to sit back and wait to see if general manager Dennis Lindsey's roster rebuild finally begins to bear fruit and reaches the playoffs in the near future — or if those former Jazz guys continue to thrive in other places while the team in Utah remains on the outside of the postseason picture, frustrated and looking on with envy while many of their old teammates get to participate in the playoff party while the current Jazz roster sits home without an invite."
