        "text": "Al Jefferson Biography\n\nAl Jefferson was one of the most productive NBA big men of his era. He may have had his best season in 2014, lifting the Charlotte Bobcats, to the playoffs. Jefferson averaged 21.8 points and 10.8 rebounds per game on the way to All-NBA Third Team honors. Prior to his time in Charlotte, he spent three seasons each with the Boston Celtics, Minnesota Timberwolves, and Utah Jazz. Each season with the Jazz, Jefferson finished top ten in the league in double doubles. In the 2006-07 season, he had his breakout with the Celtics, finishing with averages of 16 points and 11 rebounds per game. That allowed him to be one of the main trade chips to Minnesota in a deal that would net Boston future Hall of Famer Kevin Garnett. The Celtics originally selected Jefferson out of high school with the 15th overall pick of the 2004 NBA Draft.\n\nBook Al Jefferson for your Next Event\n\nDisclaimer: AthleteSpeakers assists companies seeking to hire talent like Al Jefferson for speaking engagements, virtual meetings, appearances, product endorsements, and business sanctions.
