        "text": "The NBA announced the reserves for this year’s All-Star Game on Thursday night, filling out the 12-man rosters for the Eastern and Western Conference entries in next month’s midseason showcase in Toronto.\n\nBut while that announcement means 24 players will get the honor of playing in the game, there are plenty of talented players who missed out on the opportunity — including some who have never been there at all for one reason or another, despite being very deserving of the honor.\n\nIn an attempt to make up for this slight, we here at The Washington Post are going to bestow them with a different honor: being named to the Mike Conley Nonstars, a collection of players who have deserved to be named to the game but haven’t gotten the chance, a group that is named after Mike Conley, a terrific player that has failed to be an all-star in his career only because of playing in the Western Conference during a historic run of floor generals.\n\nSubscribe to the Posting Up podcast on iTunes\n\nNow, there are two ground rules. First, any player who is still in his first four seasons in the NBA — the length of a rookie contract for anyone taken in the first round — is ineligible to make the squad. While guys like Washington’s Bradley Beal, Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo and Minnesota’s Andrew Wiggins are all examples of talented players that haven’t been all-stars yet, the goal here is to honor players that have spent several years missing out on the honor, as opposed to those still establishing themselves in the NBA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe’re also going to operate by slightly different rules than the regular all-star team. Instead of going with guards and frontcourt as the two groups of players, the roster is going to be created using a slightly different formula, one that better fits with the way the league is trending: point guards, wings, and big men.\n\nWith that, on to the selections:\n\nStarting five\n\nPoint Guard\n\nMike Conley, Memphis Grizzlies\n\nThere is no better place to begin this team than the player it was named after, as Conley has had only arguably the best crop of point guards in NBA history keeping him from becoming an all-star at some point in his career. Here are the point guards that have been named to the Western Conference all-star team since Conley entered the league in 2007: Chris Paul, Steve Nash, Chauncey Billups, Tony Parker, Deron Williams, Jason Kidd, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry and Damian Lillard. Conley could’ve easily made it several times but never got the nod — though he’ll at least get the honor of being named as captain of the Nonstars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWings\n\nJ.J. Redick, Los Angeles Clippers\n\nRedick’s career is a testament to hard work and improvement; over the course of his nine-plus seasons he’s developed from being a bit player in Orlando into a borderline all-star in Los Angeles. It wouldn’t be shocking if, under the right circumstances, Redick sneaks onto a future all-star team like Kyle Korver did last year if he keeps shooting three’s like he currently is; Redick hit 43.7 percent last year, and is hitting a nuclear 48.5 percent from behind the arc on 5.6 attempts per game.\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers are at a crossroads\n\nGordon Hayward, Utah Jazz\n\nWhile the Jazz have tried to establish themselves as a threat in the West again post-Jerry Sloan, Hayward has quietly turned into one of the better wing players in the entire league. Many people questioned why Hayward was getting multiple max contract offers in free agency two years ago, but he’s more than lived up to the expectations that came with getting them. Utah is a point guard away from being a playoff team out West, and Hayward’s improvement is a big reason why.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBig men\n\nSerge Ibaka, Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nIt will likely come as a surprise to many that Ibaka — the third member of the Thunder’s Big Three alongside Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook — hasn’t been an all-star yet, but he, like Conley, has suffered from a numbers crunch. It also doesn’t help that Ibaka’s game is built around his defense and his strong mid-range shooting game, meaning his game is one that is hard to quantify with statistics.\n\nThe Warriors and Spurs are spectacular, but the Thunder say don’t count them out yet\n\nDeAndre Jordan, Los Angeles Clippers\n\nSo much of the talk about DeAndre Jordan centers around what he doesn’t do, namely hit his free throws. But let’s look at what he does do for a second: three straight years averaging a double-double with at least two blocks per game, including averaging a ridiculous 15 rebounds per game last season, and he’s also having his second straight season shooting over 70 percent from the field. Plus he’s durable, having only missed three games over the past six years. This is an easy call.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReserves\n\nGoran Dragic, Miami Heat\n\nDragic came into his own in his second stint in Phoenix, becoming one of the league’s most fun players to watch by leading the Suns on a never-ending series of fast breaks. Now in Miami, it’s hard to see him putting up the kind of numbers necessary to make an all-star team in the future (given how much Dwyane Wade also has the ball), which may mean that he’s missed his window to be selected. But that doesn’t make Dragic any less deserving in our eyes.\n\nThe Heat have plenty of talent, but still have to figure out how to utilize it\n\nNicolas Batum, Charlotte Hornets\n\nThe focus in Portland was always on guys like LaMarcus Aldridge, Brandon Roy and Damian Lillard, but Batum has long been a versatile player at both ends. After being injured last year in his final season with the Trail Blazers, Batum has bounced back in a big way with the Hornets, averaging 14.9 points, 6.4 rebounds and 5.3 assists, and he’s going to get richly compensated as a free agent this summer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJamal Crawford, Los Angeles Clippers\n\nThis is more of a career achievement award than one based on current performance, but Crawford has long been one of the more entertaining players in the entire league. Crawford has averaged at least 17 points in a season seven different times in his career and has become one of the preeminent bench players in the NBA, twice being named the league’s Sixth Man of the Year as well as finishing second and third in other seasons.\n\nPosting Up podcast: Dan Woike on the Los Angeles Clippers\n\nRudy Gay, Sacramento Kings\n\nWe all know the criticisms of Gay’s game — he’s an inefficient player, he dribbles too much, his defense could be better. But he’s also a guy with a career average of 18.5 points per game and has had a better than average player efficiency rating every year of his career since his rookie year. He deserves a spot on this team.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWes Matthews, Dallas Mavericks\n\nLike Batum, Matthews was always an overlooked piece on the Portland teams of the past few years. But people who follow the league closely know Matthews, at least prior to tearing his Achilles tendon last season, is one of the top two-way wing players in the NBA. A bulldog of a defender and a top notch 3-point shooter, Matthews is the kind of guy every coach would love to have.\n\nAs Mavericks refuse to fade, Dirk Nowitzki just wants to have fun\n\nDerrick Favors, Utah Jazz\n\nIt feels like Favors being the third pick in the 2010 NBA Draft by the then New Jersey Nets was a million years ago. But like Hayward, Favors has used his time outside the spotlight in Utah to develop into a terrific player at both ends. He has improved his scoring output in each of his six seasons, and is one of the best defensive power forwards in the NBA. Unlike many players on this list, he’s still young enough — he doesn’t turn 25 until July — that future all-star trips still seem like a possibility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAndrew Bogut, Golden State Warriors\n\nChoosing the center to backup Jordan was an excruciating choice between Bogut and Al Jefferson, who bring very different things to the table. In the end, though, the nod went to Bogut, both because he’s having a better season this year and because his defensive ability helped drive Golden State to a championship last year and to a 42-4 record so far this season. Bogut’s overall offensive game may have never recovered from a gruesome elbow injury back in 2010, but he remains one of the best passing big men in the NBA."
