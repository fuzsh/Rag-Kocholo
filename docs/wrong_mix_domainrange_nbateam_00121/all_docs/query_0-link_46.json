        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. — The short-handed Charlotte Hornets are still without a defensive identity as they struggle through a tough stretch of their season _ one that continues with a four-game west coast road swing after Saturday’s 109-90 loss against the Oklahoma City Thunder at Time Warner Cable Arena.\n\n“It takes focus, it takes being locked in,” said point guard Kemba Walker, whose 32 points weren’t enough to keep the Hornets close to the Thunder (24-10). “We’re missing a lot of things that are really hurting us. We’ve got to fix it and fix it really fast.”\n\nIn losing for a sixth time in eight games, the Hornets (17-16) again allowed an opponent to get off to a fast start. This time, the Thunder jumped to an early 16-point lead and shot 52.6 percent in the first half (50 percent from 3-point range). It was too much to overcome, although the Hornets cut a 12-point halftime deficit to two points early in the third quarter.\n\n“The reality is, since Christmas, we’ve just really lost our way defensively,” said Hornets coach Steve Clifford, whose team opens the road trip against the Golden State Warriors on Monday. “Our energy level is good. It’s just our defense and rebounding. When we start to get our defense going again, then we’ll win again. You can’t be giving up 109 a night and play well consistently.”\n\nThe Hornets played without forward Nicolas Batum (toe) and center Al Jefferson (knee). Backup center Spencer Hawes (who missed the previous three games with lower back pain) didn’t play, but was available had he been needed. Guard Jeremy Lin, who missed two games with an ankle injury, returned and scored 12 points.\n\nThree who mattered\n\n_Kevin Durant: Thunder’s star forward scored 29 points on 8-of-13 shooting and added 11 rebounds.\n\n_Kemba Walker: With Jefferson and Batum out _ now both at the same time _ Walker continues to carry the scoring load for Charlotte. It was his fifth 30-plus point game of the season, a career high.\n\n_Russell Westbrook: So-so numbers for him, his 16 points were 10 below his average and seven assists below his 9.4 average.\n\nObservations\n\n_Oklahoma City center Serge Ibaka scored 10 points in the first half _ on 10-for-10 shooting from the free-throw line.\n\n_Thunder guard Anthony Morrow, a Charlotte Latin product, entered the game averaging 5.6 points and 1.1 rebounds. Morrow really helped Oklahoma City in the first half, coming off the bench to hit two 3-pointers. He finished with 12 points, making 4-of-8 3-pointers.\n\n_Defense was again optional for the Hornets in the first half. The Thunder shot 52.6 percent and made 50 percent of its 3-pointers.\n\n_The Thunder blocked 15 shots, a season high for a Hornets opponent."
