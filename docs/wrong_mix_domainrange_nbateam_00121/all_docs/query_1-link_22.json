        "text": "Enes Kanter wasn’t nervous, but more in awe. There were teammates double his age on that bench, some even older. So he never imagined he’d actually get in the game.\n\nKanter had been with Fenerbahçe’s junior team since he was 14. He was tall and skilled and really beginning to develop. By 15, he was a major prospect. At 16, he got called up to the senior team to provide an extra body in practice.\n\nOmer Asik and Semih Erden made up Fenerbahçe’s star-studded frontline. Both were 22 at the time and soon to move on to the NBA. But during that 2008-09 season, both got hurt. So Kanter was promoted to the bench for games. And then the replacements got in foul trouble. So Kanter was suddenly in the action, becoming the youngest player in Euroleague history.\n\n“I wasn’t even ready,” he recalled. “I was shocked.”\n\nKanter played four games that season, scoring eight points in 31 total minutes. “I had a dunk,” he still proudly remembers.\n\nAt the time, it was a dream scenario for a Turkish prospect — the equivalent of a 16-year-old U.S. player training and then playing with the Boston Celtics.\n\nBut looking back, that early glory was just the seed that spawned an extended basketball nightmare for Kanter, a six-year spiral from which he’s still recovering.\n\n“It’s been so frustrating,” he shakes his head, thinking back now.\n\nThese days, Kanter looks like the happiest guy in Oklahoma City. Even as his injury-plagued team finishes up a disappointing season, Kanter can’t stop smiling.\n\nHe towel-waves from the bench after Mitch McGary jumpers in mop-up time. He mauls Anthony Morrow in celebration after a three against the hapless Kings. He searches out Russell Westbrook high-fives like a kid chasing Halloween candy. Kanter scores a lot and smiles more.\n\n“There was a resurrection,” Kanter’s good friend Mevlüt Hilmi Çinar says of his arrival in OKC. “He came back to life.”\n\n“I just,” Kanter giggled when asked of his unbridled joy. “I just can’t explain it.”\n\nBut his complicated, controversial path to Oklahoma City can.\n\nFollowing that 2008-09 season, Fenerbahçe offered Kanter a $6 million deal, quite generous for a then 16-year-old. But he turned it down.\n\nEnes’ father, Mehmet Kanter, is a man who values education above all else. Though he lived in Turkey his entire childhood, Enes was born in Switzerland because, at the time, Mehmet was there getting his master’s degree. These days, Mehmet is a genetics professor in Istanbul. “He’s a dedicated academic in Turkey, well-respected in his field,” Çinar said.\n\nHe didn’t let Enes play basketball in his younger years. “I didn’t want my son to get overly tall,” Mehmet explained through email. But there was no stopping it. Enes’ height shot past Mehmet’s, a former volleyball player who stands a sturdy 6-foot-5. “Education, education,” Enes said of his early activities. “Then one day I beat him one-on-one.” And Enes’ future professional destiny became clear.\n\nMehmet moved the family from Van on the far eastern side of Turkey to Ankara, the capital city a 16-hour drive to the west. Enes was enrolled at Samanyolu, a prestigious and competitive school with high tuition. He first started playing organized basketball there. A few years later, he’d become so good he joined Fenerbahçe, a well-followed club team in Istanbul, the world’s sixth-most populated city, with more than triple the people that live in Los Angeles.\n\nWhen he joined the senior team, education took a clear back seat. He’d still go to class, but only when practices or games didn’t conflict. This was big-time professional athletics. But Enes was only 16 and Mehmet still wanted him to get a proper education. That’s why they turned down that $6 million deal that would have kept him with Fenerbahçe long-term and stripped his amateur status. The next step was clear.\n\n“Our decision for Enes to go to America was largely rooted from the fact that education and a basketball career do not generally go along well in Turkey,” Mehmet explained.\n\nBut it was a decision that Fenerbahçe didn’t take well. This was the best prospect in their country, the future of their team, and he was leaving.\n\nThey pleaded with Mehmet to change his mind. They used scare tactics on Enes as a last-ditch effort, pulling him into the office and showing him case studies of Turkish prospects who went to the states and flamed out because they “didn’t get proper basketball training.”\n\n“I was so depressed because I just didn’t want to be there and everybody was pressuring me,” Enes said.\n\nBut the decision was final. Mehmet couldn’t be swayed. So Enes went to the club to break the news. One veteran player, over the age of 30, was so mad he took off his shoe and threw it at Enes. “Then he just yelled at me: ‘How can you do this before telling me?’”\n\nBut Enes figured the end game was worth it. His desired future lied ahead. But the problem was, his past followed him there.\n\nEnes arrived at well-known Findlay Prep in Las Vegas for his last year before college. He was there three weeks before having to part ways because future opponents refused to play against him. They perceived Kanter as a professional. Oak Hill Academy in Virginia, Kevin Durant’s former school, turned him down because its coach Steve Smith said a former player — current Pistons guard Brandon Jennings — told him he faced Kanter in a Euroleague game.\n\nKanter moved across country to Mountain State in West Virginia. But he faced the same problem there. A New York Times article quoted Fenerbahçe’s management saying Kanter received upwards of $100,000 during his time with the club, scaring schools off. He was forced to leave Mountain State.\n\nHis third U.S. stop — Stoneridge Prep in Simi Valley, Calif. — finally provided a temporary home. He spent six months there. But it was far removed from the bright lights in Turkey.\n\nFenerbahçe packs an average of 11,000 people in its arena for home games. Stoneridge didn’t even have its own gym. They practiced at a local 24/7 public workout center. “We were about to practice and some random guy would come in and start shooting at the rim,” Enes explained.\n\nHe averaged 30 points that season, but the competition was weak. He estimated they played two or three games that actually challenged him.\n\n“I had just come from a pro team where I was staying in my own room, flying places, everything was crazy,” he said. “It was so much frustration. I’d go into the classroom and there would be spiders on the walls.”\n\nBut NCAA dreams provided a light at the end of the tunnel. Despite eligibility concerns, he remained a big-time prospect. “I still had hope of playing,” Kanter said. He eventually landed at Kentucky as John Calipari’s prize recruit of the 2010 class.\n\nThe Wildcats’ rabid fanbase embraced him. This, finally, was why he came to the United States.\n\nKanter’s long-term dreams were to be in the NBA. But both Enes and his father figured leaving home would also help him personally. Enes wanted to learn the English language and get immersed in American culture. In Lexington, he did.\n\nKanter has become a WWE fanatic. His favorite wrestler is The Undertaker. During UK’s yearly Big Blue Madness, he walked through fog during his introduction, wearing a Cowboy hat (the Undertaker’s trademark) to a raucous ovation. His nickname at Kentucky became The UnderKanter.\n\nAs he fought for his college eligibility, the campus started up a “Free Enes” movement. “This slogan was written on hills, bridges, pubs, T-shirts, shoes,” his father Mehmet remembers.\n\nBut the NCAA isn’t easily swayed. As his freshman season began, Enes was allowed to practice with the team, but not play. He was ineligible, but his appeal was still being heard. Enes was flying back and forth to Chicago for lengthy meetings with the NCAA. His father flew in from Turkey to help explain the situation.\n\nThe issue in question was the compensation Enes received during his time with Fenerbahçe. He’d never signed a contract, but as a member of the senior team, he’d had some expenses paid for — housing, transportation, food, etc. Enes’ camp argued that it was no different than a U.S. prospect getting tuition and board taken care of at a prep school.\n\nBut the involvement of Fenerbahçe’s spurned management complicated matters. They were giving the NCAA bank statements, paperwork, basically anything they felt would help the case against Enes. “At that time, they were still Facebooking me messages to get back to Fenerbahçe because one of their guys was hurt,” Enes says, shaking his head. “It was a crazy situation.”\n\nThis, of course, came in the wake of the Cam Newton scandal. With no other options, the Kanters tried to use the same defense that kept the Auburn quarterback eligible. “They let Cam Newton play and he said his dad took the money,” Enes said. But to no avail.\n\nAt the same time 27-year-old Brandon Weeden was quarterbacking Oklahoma State to new heights — after getting paid for five seasons of minor league baseball — 18-year-old Enes Kanter, the youngest player on an extremely young Kentucky team, was ruled permanently ineligible.\n\n“We even asked them: Can I sit out the first year and play the second year?” Kanter said. “Nope.”\n\nEnes turned down that $6 million contract overseas — in basically a polar opposite move than the one made by Brandon Jennings and, most recently, U.S. prospect Emmanuel Mudiay — to come play in America for free. But the NCAA ruled he’d received $33,000 more in expenses than was necessary. “Can you imagine?” Enes said, still in disbelief.\n\n“That’s something that’s definitely still sour with him,” current teammate and friend Steve Novak said. “With the billion dollar television deal (the NCAA has) and the $7.5 billion they’ve made in ad revenues just from airing the tournament, for that entity to be hurting kids’ futures based on small amounts of money being earned? I don’t really understand how it happens. Guys like Enes just play basketball and do it the way they do it where he’s from and it’s held against him here.”\n\nEarlier than he would have liked, Enes was forced to enter the NBA Draft. But he was still considered a lottery pick. And after impressing in workouts, many figured he’d go top five.\n\nCleveland had the first pick, Minnesota had the second. He flew out to both cities for a workout. But Utah had the third pick, and Enes didn’t want to go there.\n\nIt wasn’t anything against the Jazz organization, but rather the logjam of big men it already had in tow. Al Jefferson and Paul Millsap were the established starters. Turkish legend Mehmet Okur was the veteran backup. Derrick Favors, a young talent, had arrived the year before.\n\n“They told me to come to Utah for draft practices. I didn’t go to Utah,” he said. “They came to Chicago. And you know how players meet in hotel rooms team to team. I didn’t meet with Utah.”\n\nEnes was open about his desire to avoid that situation. He hadn’t played competitive basketball in two years. He couldn’t stomach a third straight season of relative inactiveness.\n\n“I was so rusty,” he said. “I needed some minutes.”\n\nUtah took Kanter anyway. The Jazz liked his talent. It made sense. But they had no way of relaying that message. The NBA lockout had hit. “No contact at all with the Jazz,” he said. Enes’ stay in basketball exile would last even longer.\n\nWhen it finally lifted, Enes got some burn with the Jazz. But not enough for his liking. He averaged 13.2 minutes per game his rookie season and 15.4 his second year.\n\n“I still feel like I wasted my time because I couldn’t play many minutes,” Enes said.\n\nBy his third season, Jefferson and Millsap were gone and Enes was getting the court time he coveted. But his relationship with Utah never fully mended. There was a certain distrust of organizations that was hard for him to overcome. He got a ruthless introduction to the business side of sports during his dealings with Fenerbahçe and the NCAA. The Jazz’s decision to draft Enes against his wishes, while understandable, may have made the relationship immediately irreparable.\n\nEven though he’s long been in the public eye, Enes is still very young in age (22) and mind. He’s a huge Spongebob fan. Watches it all the time. “He really helped my English,” Enes says of the Nickelodeon cartoon character, sounding more like he’s referring to a friend. Enes has only had his driver’s license for a year. And he hates driving, opting to let Novak control his car whenever possible. “He thinks the highway exits are like deathtraps,” Novak says.\n\n“I still don’t want to drive around these roads,” Enes says of OKC. “Because the exits are so curvy, I’m scared to drive. (Steve) is teaching me though.”\n\nWhile in Utah — and during his recent return — he made his share of immature comments. He let the lack of playing time and outside criticism get to him. He hasn’t handled everything professionally.\n\n“I just remember when I was that age how much more immature I was as a person and player,” Novak said, noting that he didn’t enter the league until he was 23. “Those (the Utah days) were like his college years.”\n\nA few days before the recent trade deadline, he publicly demanded a trade. It was another comment that didn’t sit well with the Jazz faithful. But it was a split that seemed necessary for both sides.\n\nRight before the deadline, Kanter was shipped to OKC in a trade that’s worked out for all parties. Utah freed up some time for the emerging Rudy Gobert and is playing its best basketball of the season. The Thunder secured an offensive center unlike any that’s come through here.\n\nAnd Enes finally got the fresh start he’s been searching for since making the decision to come to America six years ago. “I felt like this kid was reborn,” Çinar, his close friend, said. “He’s a different Enes.”\n\nThis offseason, he’ll be a restricted free agent likely to secure $10-plus million on the open market. But the Thunder maintains his rights and can match any offer. OKC’s front office has said it plans on retaining him. Which is fine with Enes.\n\n“I hope so,” he said, when asked of his desire to be with the Thunder long term. “It’s an amazing place. I don’t know how to explain it.”\n\nBut his complicated path here does that for him."
