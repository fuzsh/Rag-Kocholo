        "text": "PORTLAND, Ore. — Damian Lillard and LaMarcus Aldridge each poured in 29 points to lead the Portland Trail Blazers to a 115-112 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday night. Aldridge also grabbed a game-high 16 rebounds and Arron Afflalo added 18 points off the bench for the Blazers, who were coming off a win over the Spurs on Wednesday. Russell Westbrook continued his hot play of late, recording his third straight triple-double and fifth of the season. He finished with 40 points, 13 rebounds and 11 assists and became the first player since LeBron James in March of 2009 to notch three consecutive triple-doubles. Mitch McGary scored a career-high 20 points with nine rebounds and Serge Ibaka added 14 points in Oklahoma City’s second straight loss.\n\nSan Antonio 107, Sacramento 96\n\nSACRAMENTO — Kawhi Leonard and Tony Parker both broke out of slumps as the San Antonio Spurs snapped a four-game skid with a 107-96 victory over the Sacramento Kings on Friday. The Spurs needed a late push to knock off a Kings team that was without All-Star forward DeMarcus Cousins and starting point guard Darren Collison. They received 17 points from Leonard - his highest point total in three weeks — and 19 from Parker, who scored just nine over his previous three games. Manu Ginobili chipped in with 16 points off the bench for the Spurs, who improved to 3-5 on their nine-game road trip. Ben McLemore led the Kings with 21 points, Ray McCallum added 20 and Rudy Gay had 16 in defeat.\n\nHouston 102, Brooklyn 98\n\nHOUSTON — Terrence Jones had a season-high 26 points and pulled down 12 rebounds to lead the Houston Rockets in a 102-98 win over the Brooklyn Nets on Friday. Trevor Ariza had 20 points and five rebounds while James Harden added 15 points and 12 assists for the Rockets, who have won four straight. Deron Williams and Mason Plumlee each scored 15 points for the Nets, who are 2-5 on an eight-game road trip.\n\nUtah 104, Denver 82\n\nDENVER — Derrick Favors scored 21 points and pulled down 10 rebounds to lead the Utah Jazz to a 104-82 rout of the struggling Denver Nuggets. Trey Burke chipped in 19 points off the bench and Gordon Hayward scored 15 for the hot-shooting Jazz. Rodney Hood had 14 points in a reserve role for Utah, which shot 57.4 percent from the field. The Jazz won for the fifth time in seven tries and dealt Denver its fifth consecutive defeat. Will Barton scored 22 and Kenneth Faried added 12 points and eight boards, both off the bench, for Denver. Danilo Gallinari had 13 points in the Nuggets’ 18th loss in 20 games.\n\nLA Clippers 97, Memphis 79\n\nMEMPHIS — Chris Paul scored 11 of his 19 points in the fourth quarter as he and the Los Angeles Clippers avenged their loss to the Memphis Grizzlies earlier this week with a 97-79 win on Friday. Paul turned the ball over in the closing seconds to seal Memphis’ win on Monday, but the All-Star point guard, who also dished out 13 assists, made amends with a stellar fourth-quarter performance. Los Angeles, which had dropped two straight coming in, outscored the Grizzlies in the second half 56-38 and saw five players finish in double figures. DeAndre Jordan finished with 15 points and 22 rebounds, Jamal Crawford added 19 points off the bench and J.J. Redick netted 18 for the victors. Zach Randolph led Memphis with 20 points and 10 boards, while Mike Conley scored just four on 2-of-11 shooting in the Grizzlies’ second straight loss.\n\nLA Lakers 101, Milwaukee 93\n\nLOS ANGELES — Wayne Ellington scored all 14 of his points in the fourth quarter, and the Los Angeles Lakers rallied from a double-digit deficit in the final period for a 101-93 win over the Milwaukee Bucks. It’s only the 16th win all season for the injury-plagued Lakers, but this is their third in a row, matching the season-best stretch from Dec. 9-14. Ellington went 6-of-7 from the field in the last quarter to help the Lakers erase a 76-65 deficit. Jordan Clarkson scored 16, while Jeremy Lin and Jordan Hill each had 14 points. Ersan Ilyasova had 17 points and 12 rebounds for the Bucks, who have lost three of their last four games.\n\nIndiana 93, Cleveland 86\n\nINDIANAPOLIS — George Hill recorded his first career triple-double with 15 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds in the Indiana Pacers’ 93-86 win over the short-handed Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday. Rodney Stuckey added 19 points for the Pacers, who have won 10 straight at home against Cleveland. C.J. Miles and David West tallied 13 and 12 points, respectively. J.R. Smith made four 3-pointers en route to 21 points for the Cavaliers, who played without All-Stars LeBron James (rest) and Kyrie Irving (strained left shoulder). Kevin Love contributed 17 points, 10 rebounds, two steals and two blocks for Cleveland, which had a four-game winning streak snapped.\n\nPhiladelphia 89, Washington 81\n\nPHILADELPHIA — Nerlens Noel scored 14 points and added 13 rebounds and three blocks to help the Philadelphia 76ers top the Washington Wizards, 89-81, on Friday. With a balanced attack, the Sixers were able to snap their five-game losing streak. Robert Covington scored 13 and Jason Richardson netted 12 with four 3-pointers. Washington lost its sixth straight and continued its descent down the Eastern Conference standings. John Wall scored 21 points on 26 field-goal attempts with 11 assists, and Otto Porter contributed 19 points.\n\nAtlanta 95, Orlando 88\n\nATLANTA — Jeff Teague scored all 17 of his points in the second half and added seven assists, and the Eastern Conference-leading Atlanta Hawks surged in the second half for a 95-88 win over the Orlando Magic. Paul Millsap totaled 20 points and Al Horford chipped in 17 points with 13 rebounds for the Hawks, who posted their third consecutive victory. Nikola Vucevic had 21 points and 15 boards to pace Orlando, which has lost back-to-back contests since winning three in a row. Victor Oladipo scored 19, Tobias Harris netted 15, and Channing Frye totaled 10 points in defeat.\n\nBoston 106, Charlotte 98\n\nBOSTON — Trailing by as many as 16 points in the third quarter, the Boston Celtics staged a comeback to beat the Charlotte Hornets 106-98 on Friday. Isaiah Thomas led that comeback by scoring 21 of his 28 points in the second half to give the Celtics their third straight win. The Celtics got 19 points from Avery Bradley, but Boston’s bench carried much of the scoring load with a combined 60 points. In addition to Thomas’ effort, Jonas Jerebko netted 16 points and Jae Crowder contributed 14. Charlotte lost for the sixth time in seven tries despite 31 points from Mo Williams. Every Hornets starter reached double figures, with Al Jefferson and Gerald Henderson each adding 14 points, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist scoring 12 with 11 rebounds and Cody Zeller netting 11.\n\nNew York 121, Detroit 115 (2-OT)\n\nAUBURN HILLS, Mich. — For the Detroit Pistons to contend for an Eastern Conference playoff spot, they would seemingly need to beat up on teams like the NBA-worst New York Knicks. Especially at home, and especially when leading by 18 at one point. That did not happen Friday, as the Knicks rallied and won in double overtime 121-115 to steal a game that featured 14 lead changes and 15 ties. Langston Galloway forced the first OT with a 3- pointer, Shane Larkin scored nine of his 16 points in the second OT and Andrea Bargnani finished with 25 points and 12 rebounds as the Knicks snapped an eight-game skid in unlikely fashion. Greg Monroe led Detroit with 28 points and added 13 rebounds, but he missed a key free throw late in the first OT. Andre Drummond also recorded a double-double with 21 points and 15 boards, but the Pistons ended a five-game homestand (2-3) on a sour note.\n\nGolden State 113, Toronto 89\n\nTORONTO — Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry both bounced back from a rough shooting night to lead the Golden State Warriors in a 113-89 thrashing of the Toronto Raptors on Friday night. Thompson contributed 25 points with five assists and Curry totaled 22 points with five dimes in the win. The Splash Brothers combined for 31 points on 10- of-30 shooting in Thursday’s loss to LeBron James and the red-hot Cleveland Cavaliers. The two were much more efficient on Friday, teaming up to shoot 17-of-31 against the nonexistent Toronto defense. Draymond Green added 17 points with nine rebounds for Golden State, which has split each of the four games on its current six-game road trip. Terrence Ross led the Raptors with 18 points and DeMar DeRozan chipped in 14 on 4-of-16 shooting. Toronto starting point guard Kyle Lowry scored four points on 1-of-7 shooting and did not record an assist in under 19 minutes. The Raptors have lost four straight games after a four-game winning streak.\n\nChicago 96, Minnesota 89\n\nCHICAGO — Jimmy Butler had 28 points and 12 rebounds to lead Chicago past the Minnesota Timberwolves, 96-89, on the same day the Bulls received good news about Derrick Rose’s latest knee surgery. Rose is expected to only miss 4-to-6 weeks after having surgery Friday to repair a medial meniscus tear in his right knee. Mike Dunleavy added 21 points, eight rebounds and two blocks for the Bulls, who bounced back from Wednesday’s 98-86 loss to Charlotte Hornets. Joakim Noah contributed 11 points, 12 boards and eight assists. Chicago forward Pau Gasol sat out with an illness and Taj Gibson left in the first quarter with a left ankle injury. Kevin Martin ended with 18 points for the Timberwolves, who fell to 5-23 on the road this season. Ricky Rubio had 15 points and 10 assists, Nikola Pekovic recorded 12 points and 11 rebounds and Andrew Wiggins scored 14 points.\n\nNew Orleans 104, Miami 102\n\nNEW ORLEANS — Alexis Ajinca scored 24 points with eight rebounds and three blocks in place of an injured Anthony Davis to help the New Orleans Pelicans defeat the Miami Heat 104-102 on Friday night. Eric Gordon registered 20 points with eight assists, while Tyreke Evans contributed 19 points and 11 assists for the Pelicans, who have won four straight. Luol Deng and Goran Dragic went for 22 and 20 points, respectively, in the loss. Dwyane Wade totaled 11 points on 4-of-16 shooting to go along with eight assists."
