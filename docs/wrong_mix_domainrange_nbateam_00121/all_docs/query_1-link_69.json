        "text": "\"I just know they needed more of a physical presence. DJ called me and said we need some to come in and do all the little things – set screens, rebound, play defense and score if I have to score.\n\n\"I am just here to contribute as much as I can while I'm here.\"\n\nChristmas is arguably the Auckland club's most notable signing, having played more games in the NBA than any Breaker besides Awvee Storey, who played at the club in the late 2000s, and insists he isn't here to try and rejuvenate his NBA career.\n\n\"I don't look at it that way,\" the 36th pick (Minnesota Timberwolves) in the 2015 NBA draft said. \"I just want to come here and play and have fun and see what happens.\n\n\"This is just another chapter in the story. I have been through a lot already – ups and downs. I just want to come here, play my game and see what happens.\"\n\nHe admits his NBA experience will help him however.\n\n\"It will help me a lot – I played against and with a lot of great players – Al Jefferson, Myles Turner and Zach Randolph.\n\n\"You learn a great deal doing that.\"\n\nChristmas brings more of a physical threat to the centre position that Alex Pledger and Rob Loe have manned so far this season.\n\n\"I like to be physical, play defense, set hard screens for my teammates to get open, try block shots and just finish around the basket,\" Christmas said.\n\nHaving arrived in New Zealand on Monday, Christmas is trying to acclimate ahead of his club debut against the Illawarra Hawks on Saturday night.\n\nIf his first media interview is anything to go by, he will need a crash course on New Zealand culture.\n\n\"I didn't know that much – I knew that Steve Irwin was from out here,\" he replied when asked what he knew of New Zealand.\n\n\"I do know Steven Adams – I played against him in college,\" Christmas laughed when told Irwin was from Australia.\n\n\"He is a great player and I've heard he's a big deal out here.\""
