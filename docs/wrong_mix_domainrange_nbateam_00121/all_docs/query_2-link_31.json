We did a fair deal for Al and us.”\n\nSweetening the deal for Utah is the traded player exception the club gets from the NBA, a provision that allows the Jazz to absorb Jefferson’s $13 million salary next season despite being over the salary cap.\n\nSaying goodbye to Jefferson, the Wolves’ leading scorer last season (17.1 points) and No. 2 rebounder (9.3), cuts the last link to the Kevin Garnett trade in 2007 that former Wolves general manager Kevin McHale negotiated with the Boston Celtics.\n\nJefferson, 25, was the last remaining player of the five former Celtics who came to Minnesota in a deal that generated dramatic change for the franchise. The other four — Ryan Gomes, Sebastian Telfair, Theo Ratliff and Gerald Green — have moved on. Jefferson and Gomes had the longest tenures with the Wolves, surviving three losing seasons.\n\n“Al recognized it might be a couple more years before we contend,” Kahn said. “He wants to win, and I understood where he was coming from.”\n\nAs the key component in the Garnett deal, which also gave the Wolves two first-round picks, there was hope that Jefferson would establish himself in Minnesota, particularly after the 6-foot-10 center-forward averaged 21.0 points and 11.3 rebounds in his first season with the Wolves. But coaching changes, injuries and personal problems kept the six-year veteran from building on his impressive start with the Wolves.\n\nJefferson’s productivity dropped last season after he struggled to recover from major surgery on his left knee that kept him out of the final 32 games of the 2008-09 season. He suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament and battled Achilles’ tendinitis at the start of last season. Jefferson missed two games in November because of the death of his grandmother and two in April because of a family member’s illness.\n\nThe low point of the season for Jefferson came in the early-morning hours of Feb. 28 when he was arrested for driving under the influence near downtown Minneapolis. Jefferson pleaded guilty to the fourth-degree misdemeanor. He was fined $300 and sentenced to two years’ probation and 40 hours of community service. The Wolves suspended Jefferson for two games without pay.\n\nIn addition to the off-court troubles, Jefferson spent most of the season trying to adapt to coach Kurt Rambis’ triangle offense. Rambis was Jefferson’s third coach in his three-season run with the Wolves. Jefferson also played for McHale and Randy Wittman.\n\nJefferson became expendable when the Wolves re-signed free-agent center Darko Milicic. Before the June 24 draft, Kahn indicated that if the Serbia-Montenegro native re-signed with the Wolves, he would look into trading Jefferson, who had been the subject of trade rumors since January. The Wolves also signed Serbian native Nikola Pekovic and acquired two-year veteran Michael Beasley from Miami to help revitalize a front line that returns Kevin Love.\n\nThe upgraded front line led Kahn to tell Koufos’ agent that he would consider trading him “if the opportunity presented itself.” Koufos, a first-round pick of Utah from Ohio State in 2008, appeared in only 36 games last season, averaging 1.5 points and 1.3 rebounds.\n\nKahn said he had “nothing to report” on the possibility of Milwaukee free-agent point guard Luke Ridnour joining the Wolves. Reports surfaced that the Wolves were prepared to offer Ridnour a four-year deal worth $16 million.\n\nOriginally Published: July 12, 2010 at 11:01 p.m."
