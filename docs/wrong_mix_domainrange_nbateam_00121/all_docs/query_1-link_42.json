        "text": "Friday’s game: Suns (0-1) at Thunder (1-0)\n\nTip-off: 5 p.m.\n\nTV/Radio: FSAZ/KMVP-FM 98.7\n\nToday’s game-day Orange Slices:\n\n* With Jared Dudley and Leandro Barbosa back on the Suns this season, they at least have players who have won at Oklahoma City in a Phoenix uniform.\n\nOtherwise, the Suns’ memories of playing at Oklahoma City have been about departing Chespapeake Energy Arena disappointed.\n\nThe Suns have lost 10 consecutive visits to Oklahoma City. Worse, the schedule usually sets them up as a foil. For four of the past five years, the Suns have been the visiting team for the Thunder’s traditional New Year’s Eve game, which former Suns coach Jeff Hornacek called “a tradition that needs to end.”\n\nMORE: Suns coverage from azcentral sports\n\nGET THE SUNS APP: iPhone | Android\n\nThe Suns might be worse off for not having that Dec. 31 trip. They are the visiting team for Oklahoma City’s home opener on Friday night, when the post-Kevin Durant era surely will have Loud City sounding like the inside of a jet engine.\n\n“I’m looking forward to it,” Suns guard Devin Booker said. “The NBA’s back. I know the Thunder has some of the best fans in the NBA. I played here last year and I know it’s hectic. I’m looking forward to it. Those are environments, when I was growing up watching games, that I wanted to play in.”\n\nOklahoma City has won seven consecutive home openers, went 32-9 at home last season and has a home winning percentage of .760 since the 2009-10 season.\n\n* The Thunder have added Victor Oladipo and rookie Domantas Sabonis to the starting lineup and Ersan Ilyasova to its bench but the home debut of this team is clearly about it becoming Russell Westbrook’s team in the absence of Durant.\n\nWestbrook posted 32 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists with only two turnovers in a season-opening win at Philadelphia on Wednesday. The Suns would like to make Westbrook a volume shooter.\n\n“I think what you see more than ever is the entire team has kind of taken on his personality,” said Suns coach Earl Watson, who has known Westbrook since he was a kid and worked with the fellow UCLA Bruin in the summers. “I think before they were well-balanced with KD’s personality and Russ’ personality but now it’s completely Russ. They’re active. They’re aggressive. They play hard. They play with passion. They play with toughness. That’s all Russ’ personality traits.”\n\nWestbrook had 18 triple-doubles last season, equaling the most since Magic Johnson in 1981-82.\n\n“I don’t think any great players in the league can stop him one-on-one so it’s a team thing,” Booker said. “You have to load up on him, slow him down in transition and things like that. The thing is, you have to slow down other guys too.\n\nMORE: Suns hurt by bench defense, icy Brandon Knight\n\n* Oklahoma City has a rarity – a standout reserve big man. Enes Kanter was one of the best sixth men in the NBA last season, making 57.6 percent of his shots and leading all reserves with 8.1 rebounds per game.\n\n“Very good at the low box,” said Watson, a Utah teammate with Kanter for three seasons. “You just have to play him physical. He’s an aggressive post-up player. He plays out of the post. He’s a unique scorer. He learned a lot under Al Jefferson when we were in Utah, using a lot of his footwork in the post.”\n\n* Booker played 24 ½ minutes Wednesday night, partly because of five fouls. Defense is the most important growth area for him this season.\n\nSuns 2016-17 roster: How much each player makes\n\nAl McCoy to be inducted into Suns Ring of Honor\n\n“I was trying to be real aggressive defensively,” said Booker, who still led the Suns with 18 points. “I just have to play more fundamental defense, more sound. In the first game of the season, everybody’s on their toes. The refs are on their toes. I expect that. I’ve got to slow down from there.”\n\n* Watson has emphasized to his team to “be who we are” between Wednesday’s 113-94 loss to Sacramento and Friday night’s game.\n\n“We’ve got to get into our mentality first,” Watson said. “It’s so important. I say this time and time again: when a team loses, it’s not because they execute their personality traits, their activity and their offense. It’s because they failed to execute somewhere along the line, where the guys don’t buy into the role, the guys are not playing with passion and purpose or they’re not playing the way they’re supposed to be as far as style of play.”\n\n* Cole Mickelson’s Stone Cole Fact o’ the Day: Dragan Bender’s two 3-pointers in Wednesday night’s game made him the only Suns player to make multiple 3s in his first career game besides Michael Finley and Trevor Ruffin.\n\n* The last word goes to Booker on his brief scuffle Wednesday night with fellow Kentucky Wildcat and current Sacramento center DeMarcus Cousins: “We’re brothers. It’s all love. We’re both competitors. I tried to get through a screen. He pushed me a little. I pushed him back. Nothing more than that. People will blow it up. We both went to Kentucky but it’s nothing more than that. We talked about it and we laughed it off so it’s not a big deal to me.”\n\nProjected starting lineups\n\nC: Tyson Chandler … Steven Adams\n\nPF: Jared Dudley … Domantas Sabonis\n\nSF: T.J. Warren … Andre Roberson\n\nSG: Devin Booker …. Victor Oladipo\n\nPG: Eric Bledsoe … Russell Westbrook\n\nKey Thunder reserves: Ersan Ilyasova, Kyle Singler, Enes Kanter, Semaj Christon and Alex Abrines.\n\nKey Thunder injuries: Cameron Payne is out with a foot fracture."
