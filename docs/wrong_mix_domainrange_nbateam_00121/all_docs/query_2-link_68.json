        "text": "Al Jefferson was warming up at the east-end basket of the Garden when Kendrick Perkins walked to midcourt, smiled and made fun of his nose.\n\nLater, the Utah center was walking by as Doc Rivers was holding his early press conference in the hallway outside the Celtics dressing room.\n\n“That Al Jefferson is the ugliest .Ã¢â‚¬â€°.Ã¢â‚¬â€°.,” said Rivers, letting his sentence trail off into laughter.\n\nYes, Big Al was “home.”\n\nHe arrived in Boston from Prentiss (Miss.) High in 2004, and spent his first three NBA seasons in green and white, averaging 16 points and 11 rebounds in his last season. He then made Celts fans happy by being the key bait that hooked Kevin Garnett from Minnesota.\n\nAlmost everywhere he turned last night, he saw familiar faces and greeted the owners warmly.\n\n“It’s always going to be a great thing — different in a good way — coming back to where I first started,” said Jefferson, who went on to score seven points on 1-for-11 shooting in Utah’s 110-86 loss. “This is the team that gave me my first job in the NBA, and for that I will always have the utmost respect for this team.”\n\nJefferson has stayed in touch with Perkins and Rivers, taking advice from the latter and offering help for the former when the C’s center underwent ACL surgery — which he went through two years ago.\n\n“We’re like two brothers, man,” Jefferson said. “It’s always going to be that way. I spent a lot of time with him this summer when he first had his surgery. I was up here in Boston with him, just letting him know what he was about to see and what he was about to go through. It’s a long road, a long process, and to see him out there running now and saying he’s not that far away from being on the court, it’s a blessing.\n\nThe two were tight from the start.\n\n“He was the guy that came out of high school the year before me, so he kind of helped me like I helped him this year,” Jefferson said. “He kind of helped me, letting me know what’s going to happen in the NBA and the transition from high school to the NBA. And we competed against each other. We competed all the time in practice. You would think at times we hated each other, but it’s just how it is in the court.\n\n“I hate that he’s not playing tonight, because that’s something I love to do, play against him. Then after the game it’s all love.”\n\nAnd Jefferson loves playing for the Jazz after going through rebuilding situations with the Celtics and Timberwolves.\n\n“It’s a wonderful feeling,” he said. “The only thing about it now is when we do lose a game, it hurts a lot, lot more now. It sticks with me. You would think I’d be used to losing games, but now we’re winning games. When we do lose one it feels a lot worse.”"
