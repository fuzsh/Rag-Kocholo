        "text": "Al Jefferson's 12th season has been up and down. He's making well over half his field goal attempts, but his minutes are lower, and he isn't scoring quite like he used to.\n\nHe's almost 31 years old, so the days of throwing it to him in the post and getting out of the way are almost over. Now, he and his teammates need to fight extra hard before the catch to give Jefferson the ball much closer to the basket.\n\nOr, as was relayed to the Charlotte Observer, his \"sweet spot\":\n\nJefferson is still one of the best low-post scorers in the world, but Charlotte needs to do a better job masking its desire to feed him down low. It's a work in progress that's steadily getting better."
