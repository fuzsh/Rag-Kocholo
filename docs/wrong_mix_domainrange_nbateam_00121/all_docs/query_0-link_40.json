        "text": "Charlotte Bobcats at Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nTime: 7 PM ET, Mar 2, 2014\n\nSpread: OKC -10\n\nTotal: 204.5\n\nBetting odds courtesy of 5dimes\n\nThe Charlotte Bobcats are 27-31 and situated 7th in the Eastern Conference playoff picture. The Cats are 12-17 on the road and will travel to face the 44-15 Oklahoma City Thunder in a game NBA oddsmakers are favoring the Thunder by 10 points.\n\nCharlotte fell 92-82 to the San Antonio Spurs Friday night (Feb 28). Al Jefferson hit 10-of-21 from the floor en route to 20 points and seven rebounds, and four other Bobcats reached double figures, but it wasn’t enough to overcome the Spurs, even without Tony Parker in the lineup. The Bobcats hit just 36.7 percent from the floor and 3-of-17 from three-point range.\n\nCharlotte ranks 4th in the NBA in team defense, surrendering just 96.7 points per game, but the Bobcats are woeful offensively, scoring just 95 points per game. The team is four games under .500 and has a negative point differential, -1.7. The Cats are in need of another big scorer because Michael Kidd-Gilchrist is still lingering offensively. Outside of Jefferson and Kemba Walker, the team lacks explosive scoring options.\n\nThe Thunder rank 5th in the NBA in scoring (104.9 points per game) and 8th in the NBA in defense (98.6 points per game allowed), and are owners of the best record in the Western Conference. The Thunder defeated Memphis 113-107 Friday night behind 37 points from Kevin Durant. Durant is having his best season as a pro, with averages of 31.6 points, 7.7 rebounds and 5.6 assists per game.\n\nRussell Westbrook is back from injury, and the Thunder are gearing up to make a Finals run, since last season’s effort was thwarted by a Westbrook injury. Reggie Jackson has emerged in his second year as a very valuable guard and is fourth on the team in scoring with 13.4 points per game in addition to dishing out 4.2 assists per game.\n\nCHA Trends: 4-0 ATS in last 4 following SU Loss; UNDER 4-0-1 in last 5 road games vs teams with winning home records; 6-1 ATS in last 7 following ATS loss\n\nOKC Trends: OVER 5-0 in last 5 home games vs teams with losing road records; 0-3-1 ATS in last 4 home games; 0-4-1 ATS in last 5 overall.\n\nHead-to-head: Bobcats 0-5-1 ATS in last 6 in OKC; UNDER 6-1-1 in last 8 in OKC; Bobcats 1-5 ATS in last 6 meetings."
