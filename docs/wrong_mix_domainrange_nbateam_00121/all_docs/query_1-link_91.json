        "text": "Some breaking news coming out of the NFL as San Francisco 49ers wide receiver, Brandon Aiyuk, has officially requested a trade. This news is coming out the same day as the team’s rookies report for training camp. Here is a look at what could happen, and what has led to this moment.\n\nBrandon Aiyuk Requests Trade\n\nAccording to Mike Garafolo on X, Aiyuk officially requested a trade on Tuesday, July 16th. These contract negotiations have been going on for quite some time, and now as training camp is beginning, Aiyuk has officially made his request.\n\nThese negotiations have been loud across social media. Spanning from reports of what the 49ers have offered Aiyuk to the receiver posting that the team no longer wants him, this has been an ongoing issue. Negotiations have now halted, even with the team meeting with Aiyuk in person for meetings. One of the known contract offers from the team was for around $26 million per year.\n\nThe other receivers up for an extension have already signed their extensions such as DeVonta Smith and Amon-Ra St. Brown. These are the two that Aiyuk was projected to have a similar contract. Star wide receiver, Justin Jefferson then signed his extension, resetting the market for the position. With that, and the 49ers having multiple players with big contracts on the team, a deal has not been close to done with Aiyuk.\n\nWhat Could Happen Next?\n\nNow that the trade request is in, it is time to discuss what is next. If he is traded, where does he go? Two teams have been big names in the trade market for the wide receiver and that is the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Washington Commanders. The Steelers could use a player like Aiyuk, and would likely be willing to trade for him. Aiyuk would then have either Russell Wilson or potentially Justin Fields as his quarterback.\n\nThe wide receiver has also remained close to Washington’s rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels. Aiyuk has been open about his connection with the young quarterback. Daniels was the player on the phone with Aiyuk when he said the 49ers do not want him. He also reportedly went with Aiyuk to his meeting with the 49ers. Washington is a big team to watch. It should also be noted that the Commanders’ current General Manager is Adam Peters. Peters was the Assistant General Manager for the 49ers before taking the job with Washington. The connection could make Washington the place to be. Aiyuk has made it clear he can see himself with them.\n\nAccording to Josina Anderson on X, the New England Patriots are one of the teams to have reached out to the 49ers regarding a trade. There are also sleeper teams to watch here. The Los Angeles Chargers need a receiver to help Justin Herbert. The Las Vegas Raiders have been in the news lately too. There is the potential that they trade Davante Adams to the New York Jets. If this happens, the Raiders are a team to watch. It is safe to say the 49ers do have teams that will be willing to trade for Aiyuk. Of course, the team will need the cap space to be able to give Aiyuk the contract that he wants.\n\nIf a trade does occur, the 49ers will likely want a player to be involved in the trade, as they would want an immediate return, not just a draft pick for next year.\n\nChance he Stays?\n\nIt should be made clear that the San Francisco 49ers do not have any intentions of trading Aiyuk. In the request, Aiyuk has been clear he wants to be paid or traded, and the 49ers do not wish to trade him but also do not want to give him the money he wants.\n\nIt is unlikely the 49ers will trade him for just a 2025 draft pick, as that will not help them this year. So yes, there is a chance that Aiyuk will be with the 49ers in 2024, as he is under contract and set to make $14 million this year.\n\nIn 2022, Deebo Samuel did request a trade and he ended up signing his extension in late July. Scenarios are always different, but it does show at least fans that just because a player requests a trade, it does not mean it will happen. Kicker Robbie Gould also requested a trade to get his extension with the team in the past. Last year, Nick Bosa did not sign his extension until September 6th. Deebo Samuel the year before that was on July 31st.\n\nFor now, this trade request just solidifies that Aiyuk is unhappy with the negotiations, and will not participate in training camp. Aiyuk’s trade request is now official, and what happens next is still to be seen."
