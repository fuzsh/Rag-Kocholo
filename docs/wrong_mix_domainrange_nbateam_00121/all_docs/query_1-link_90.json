        "text": "The NBA Draft arrives Thursday, and Monday starts the free agent period, when teams can start negotiating with players who are not under contract.\n\nSeems like the best time to study exactly what each Western Conference roster looks like, in terms of salary commitments for the 2013-14 season, decisions to be made and who’s available via free agency.\n\nHere are the 15 teams in the Western Conference and how their rosters set up prior to the draft.\n\nFirst, a glossary.\n\nPlayer option: means a player is under contract but can opt out of the contract and become a free agent.\n\nTeam option: means a player is under contract, but the team can opt out of the contract, allowing the player to become a free agent. I’ve also included non-guaranteed contracts in this category.\n\nRestricted free agent: means a player can be signed to an “offer sheet” by another team, but his current team reserves the right to match the offer and keep the player.\n\nA few things to remember. The projected luxury tax threshold is $71.6 million. Most teams will try to stay under that total for its payroll. The projected payroll cap is $58.5 million; teams paying more than that in salary are limited in how they can acquire players.\n\nAlso, the salary commitment does not include team options, player options or restricted free agents.\n\nAnd finally, the salary listed for restricted free agents is the amount the team must offer on a one-year contract to retain the right to match a contract offered by another franchise.\n\nTHUNDER\n\n2013-14 commitments: $64.8M.\n\nUnder contract: Kevin Durant ($18.8M), Russell Westbrook ($14.7M), Serge Ibaka ($12.3M), Kendrick Perkins ($8.5M), Thabo Sefolosha ($3.9M), Nick Collison ($2.6M), Jeremy Lamb ($2.1M), Reggie Jackson ($1.3M), Perry Jones ($1.1M).\n\nTeam option: Hasheem Thabeet ($1.2M), Daniel Orton ($0.9M), DeAndre Liggins ($0.8M).\n\nUnrestricted free agent: Kevin Martin, Ronnie Brewer, Derek Fisher.\n\nOutlook: The Thunder has few holes in its roster. And it’s a good thing. There isn’t much room for acquisition.\n\nSPURS\n\n2013-14 commitments: $32.9M\n\nUnder contract: Tony Parker ($12.5M), Tim Duncan ($10.4M), Danny Green ($3.8M), Kawhi Leonard ($2M), Nando De Colo ($1.5M), Cory Joseph ($1.2M), Aron Baynes ($0.8M).\n\nTeam option: Matt Bonner ($3.9M).\n\nRestricted free agent: Tiago Splitter ($4.9M), Gary Neal ($1.1M).\n\nPlayer option: Boris Diaw ($4.7M), Patty Mills ($1.1M).\n\nUnrestricted free agent: Manu Ginobili, DeJuan Blair, Tracy McGrady.\n\nOutlook: Excellent. San Antonio has the core of its team accounted for, with plenty of cap space. The Spurs have all kinds of options.\n\nNUGGETS\n\n2013-14 commitments: $72.6M\n\nUnder contract: Ty Lawson ($10.8M), JaVale McGee ($10.8M), Danilo Gallinari ($10.1M), Wilson Chandler ($6.3M), Andre Miller ($5.0M), Kosta Koufos ($3.0M), Anthony Randolph ($1.8M), Evan Fournier ($1.4M), Kenneth Faried ($1.4M), Jordan Hamilton ($1.4M).\n\nPlayer option: Andre Iguodala ($16.2M).\n\nRestricted free agent: Timofey Mozgov ($3.9M), Julyan Stone ($1.1M).\n\nTeam option: Quincy Miller ($0.8M).\n\nUnrestricted free agent: Corey Brewer.\n\nOutlook:Denver actually will have some wiggle room – and will need it, since Igoudala says he will opt out of his contract, even though he will be hard-pressed to get that kind of money elsewhere.\n\nCLIPPERS\n\n2013-14 commitments: $45.3M\n\nUnder contract: Blake Griffin ($16.4M), DeAndre Jordan ($11.0M), Caron Butler ($8.0M), Jamal Crawford ($5.2M), Eric Bledsoe ($2.6M).\n\nTeam option: Willie Green ($1.4M), DaJuan Summers ($0.9M), Maalik Wayns ($0.8M).\n\nUnrestricted free agents: Chris Paul, Lamar Odom, Chauncey Billups, Ronny Turiaf, Ryan Hollins, Matt Barnes.\n\nOutlook: Until Doc Rivers jumped on board as coach, the Clippers’ future seemed dicey. But the addition of Rivers figures to entice Paul to re-sign with the Clips, which would round this roster into shape.\n\nGRIZZLIES\n\n2013-14 commitments: $57.9M\n\nUnder contract: Zach Randolph ($17.8M), Marc Gasol ($14.9M), Mike Conley ($8.2M), Tayshaun Prince ($7.2M), Darrell Arthur ($3.2M), Ed Davis ($3.2M), Quincy Pondexter ($2.2M), Tony Wroten ($1.2M), Donte Greene ($1.0M).\n\nRestricted free agent: Austin Daye ($4.1M), Jon Leuer ($1.0M).\n\nPlayer option: Jerryd Bayless ($3.1M).\n\nTeam option: Willie Reed ($0.8M).\n\nUnrestricted free agent: Tony Allen, Keyon Dooling.\n\nOutlook:Memphis has the core of its team set, with a little room left to spend. It sure would like to keep Allen.\n\nWARRIORS\n\n2013-14 commitments: $44.9M\n\nUnder contract: Andrew Bogut ($14.0M), David Lee ($13.9M), Steph Curry ($9.9M), Harrison Barnes ($2.9M), Klay Thompson ($2.3M), Festus Ezeli ($1.1M), Draymond Green ($0.9M).\n\nTeam option: Dwayne Jones ($1.1M), Kent Bazemore ($0.8M), Scott Machado ($0.8M).\n\nPlayer option: Richard Jefferson ($11.0M), Andris Biedrins ($9.0M), Carl Landry ($4.0M), Brandon Rush ($4.0M).\n\nUnrestricted free agent: Jarrett Jack.\n\nOutlook: Difficult. If Jefferson, Biedrins, Rush and Landry stay on board – and only Landry might be marketable elsewhere – then the Warriors are into the luxury tax.\n\nLAKERS\n\n2013-14 commitments: $68.1M\n\nUnder contract:Kobe Bryant ($30.4M), Pau Gasol ($19.3M), Steve Nash ($9.3M), Steve Blake ($4.0M), Jordan Hill ($3.5M).\n\nPlayer option: Metta World Peace ($7.7M).\n\nTeam option: Chris Duhon ($3.9M), Jodie Meeks ($1.6M).\n\nRestricted free agent: Devin Ebanks ($1.3M), Darius Morris ($1.2M), Andrew Goudelock ($1.0M), Robert Sacre ($1.0M).\n\nUnrestricted free agents: Dwight Howard, Antawn Jamison, Earl Clark.\n\nOutlook: Good thing money is no object. Because the Lakers are in a world of hurt.\n\nROCKETS\n\n2013-14 commitments: $39.3M\n\nUnder contract: James Harden ($13.7M), Omer Asik ($8.4M), Jeremy Lin ($8.4M), Thomas Robinson ($3.5M), Royce White ($1.7M), Terrence Jones ($1.5M), Donatas Motiejunas ($1.4M).\n\nTeam option: Francisco Garcia ($6.4M), Carlos Delfino ($3.0M), Aaron Brooks ($2.5M), Chandler Parsons ($0.9M), Greg Smith ($0.9M), James Anderson ($0.9M), Patrick Beverley ($0.8M), Tim Ohlbrecht ($0.8M).\n\nOutlook: Crazy summer. The Rockets have the option on eight players.\n\nJAZZ\n\n2013-14 commitments: $17.8M\n\nUnder contract: Derrick Favors ($6.0M), Enes Kanter ($4.5M), Gordon Hayward ($3.5M), Alec Burks ($2.2M), Jeremy Evans ($1.7M).\n\nTeam option: Kevin Murphy ($0.8M).\n\nPlayer option: Marvin Williams ($7.5M).\n\nUnrestricted free agent: Al Jefferson, Mo Williams, Paul Millsap, Randy Foye, Earl Watson, Jamaal Tinsley, DeMarre Carroll, Travis Leslie.\n\nOutlook: Most salary room in the West. But can the Jazz find some takers?\n\nMAVERICKS\n\n2013-14 commitments: $27.9M\n\nUnder contract: Dirk Nowitzki ($22.7M), Vince Carter ($3.2M), Jared Cunningham ($1.2M), Jae Crowder ($0.8M).\n\nPlayer option: Shawn Marion ($9.3M), O.J. Mayo ($4.2M).\n\nRestricted free agent: Darren Collison ($3.3M), Rodrigue Beaubois ($3.2M).\n\nTeam option: Josh Akognon ($0.8M).\n\nUnrestricted free agents: Chris Kaman, Anthony Morrow, Elton Brand, Brandan Wright, Mike James, Bernard James.\n\nOutlook: Dismal.\n\nBLAZERS\n\n2013-14 commitments: $43.2M\n\nUnder contract: LaMarcus Aldridge ($14.6M), Nicolas Batum ($11.2M), Wesley Matthews ($6.9M), Damian Lillard ($3.2M), Joel Freeland ($2.9M), Meyers Leonard ($2.2M), Victor Claver ($1.3M), Will Barton ($0.8M).\n\nTeam option: Aleksandar Pavlovic ($1.4M).\n\nRestricted free agent: Eric Maynor ($3.4M).\n\nUnrestricted free agent: JJ Hickson, Luke Babbitt, Elliot Williams, Nolan Smith.\n\nOutlook: Portland had a solid starting lineup but a weak bench in 2012-13. With already $60 million dedicated to salary next season, depth doesn’t figure to get much better.\n\nTIMBERWOLVES\n\n2013-14 commitments: $37.7M\n\nUnder contract: Kevin Love ($14.7M), Derrick Williams ($5.0M), J.J. Barea ($4.7M), Luke Ridnour ($4.3M), Ricky Rubio ($4.0M), Alexey Shved ($3.1M), Malcolm Lee ($0.9M), Chris Johnson ($0.9M).\n\nPlayer option: Andrei Kirilenko ($10.2M).\n\nRestricted free agent: Nikola Pekovic ($6.0M).\n\nTeam option: Greg Stiemsma ($2.7M), Dante Cunningham ($2.2M), Mickael Gelabale ($0.9M).\n\nUnrestricted free agent: Chase Budinger, Chris Johnson.\n\nOutlook:Minnesota has some money to spend and will need it to keep Pekovic.\n\nKINGS\n\n2013-14 commitments: $42.0M\n\nUnder contract: Marcus Thornton ($8.1M), John Salmons ($7.6m), Chuck Hayes ($5.7M), Jason Thompson ($5.6M), DeMarcus Cousins ($4.9M), Patrick Patterson ($3.1M), Travis Outlaw ($3.0M), Jimmer Fredette ($2.4M), Isaiah Thomas ($0.9M).\n\nRestricted free agent: Tyreke Evans ($6.9M), James Johnson ($4.0M), Toney Douglas ($3.1M).\n\nUnrestricted free agent: Cole Aldrich.\n\nOutlook:Sacramento’s plan seemed to be focused on keeping the team in town, not doing something with it.\n\nPELICANS\n\n2013-14 commitments: $34.0M\n\nUnder contract: Eric Gordon ($14.3M), Ryan Anderson ($8.3M), Anthony Davis ($5.4M), Austin Rivers ($2.4M), Greivis Vasquez ($2.2M).\n\nTeam option: Robin Lopez ($5.1M), Jason Smith ($2.5M), Lance Thomas ($0.9M), Terrel Harris ($0.9M), Darius Miller ($0.8M), Brian Roberts ($0.8M).\n\nUnrestricted free agent: Al-Farouq Aminu, Xavier Henry, Roger Mason, Louis Amundson, Terrel Harris.\n\nOutlook: Money to burn.\n\nSUNS\n\n2013-14 commitments: $44.4M\n\nUnder contract: Marcin Gortat ($7.7M), Goran Dragic ($7.5M), Channing Frye ($6.4M), Michael Beasley ($6.0M), Luis Scola ($4.5M), Jared Dudley ($4.3M), Markieff Morris ($2.1M), Marcus Morris ($2.0M), Kendall Marshall ($2.0M).\n\nTeam option: Shannon Brown ($3.5M), Hamed Haddadi ($1.4M), PJ Tucker ($0.9M).\n\nRestricted free agent: Diante Garrett ($1.0M).\n\nUnrestricted free agents: Wesley Johnson, Jermaine O’Neal."
