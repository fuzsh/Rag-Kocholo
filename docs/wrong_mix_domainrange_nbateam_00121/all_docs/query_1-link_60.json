        "text": "The NBA is ever changing. From a tough, physical, grinded out style to the pace & space version of basketball we see today, the NBA always seems to be evolving. Now point guards need to score. And shooting guards need to be playmakers. Different positions entail varied skill sets, but what of our beloved big man?\n\nThe “Traditional” Big Man\n\n“Feed the big man!” A line that’s been stressed time and time again when a team has a dominant post threat. Well…not so much anymore.\n\nWhether you’re a fan of it or not, you know the post game is a dying art in the NBA. Some people love the old school style of banging bodies in the post to get points the hard way, and some people love the shooting that’s taken over the NBA.\n\nHakeem Olajuwon, Shaquille O’ Neal, Wilt Chamberlain, some of the biggest NBA legends were dominant down low. But even in the modern era, just 10 years ago, we saw players like Tim Duncan, Dwight Howard, Zach Randolph dominate with their back to the basket for years.\n\nIt was a different time, shooting wasn’t a prerequisite, it was actually frowned upon. If you weren’t tough & physical you were viewed as “soft.” There was perhaps nothing more valuable than being a 7’0” 250 lbs guy who dished out a brutal beating each night. Oh, how times have changed.\n\nA Dying Breed\n\nWe’ve entered that “pace & space” era in the NBA. Behind teams like Golden State that value versatile small ball lineups that can flat out shoot, the NBA has transitioned into a new age.\n\nNBA scouts used to put such value on size, but now with this new style of basketball, teams put such a high emphasis on athleticism and versatility. Shooting is at a premium right now. If you can shoot, you can earn a role on an NBA roster.\n\nUnfortunately for guys like Al Jefferson, a lack of shooting and athleticism doomed their career. Jefferson was a hefty 290 lbs. Albeit a talented player, Jefferson moved slowly up and down the court, a total liability in transition. Although Jefferson often dabbled around 20.0 PPG and 10 RPG, Jefferson simply couldn’t fit in the modern day NBA.\n\nWith teams playing such good help defense, it becomes tough to go 1 on 1 in the post and just dominate. With small lineups that are so versatile on defense, it’s not a viable playstyle anymore. Even the NBA realizes “Centers” are a dying breed, they removed the position from the All-Star game 6 years ago.\n\nThe “New” Big Man\n\nSo what exactly is the “new” big man? Popular to contrary belief, it’s not just a big man that can shoot the three ball.\n\nOf course, shooting is a big plus for any big man nowadays. If you can shoot you can drag the opposing rim protector away from the basket which opens up valued spacing for your team.\n\nBut it’s not just spacing that is required, athleticism is perhaps more important. We see a plethora of big men that can’t shoot. DeAndre Jordan, Andre Drummond, Steven Adams to name a few.\n\nThe difference is those big men can run the floor, they won’t get left behind in transition and they get easy points on the fastbreak. They play elite defense and are fantastic in the P&R game. Perhaps most important, they swallow rebounds like it’s nobody’s business.\n\nThe “modern-day big men” are often just rim runners who set strong picks and finish well near the rim. They don’t need a post game if they have one, they often are asked not to use it.\n\nWe see the likes of someone like Clint Capela who shoots 64.5 FG%. Capela is an elite shot blocker who excels in the P&R game. He’s a great rebounder who gets all his points from put backs or as the “roller.” He has no post game, and he doesn’t need one.\n\nWe see plays exactly like this from today’s big men. Capela sets the pick for Harden and rolls to the basket. Harden gets near the basket and throws up the lob to Capela who grabs it and slams it down. That P&R is a staple part of Capela’s offense that represents what modern day bigs are.\n\nWe don’t see many traditional, physical 5s anymore. We usually see the rim runners who play strong defense. Stretch 4s are at a premium, teams will take out their bigger PFs in exchange for a guy who can nail the three ball. Teams will even just put a small forward at that position in a small NBA.\n\nAs time goes on we see big men and their ability to pass being put to good use. In the old days, it wasn’t really an issue. If you were a big man who could pass, your playmaking ability would only be used to pass out of double teams.\n\nNowadays we see the passing ability of big men used more effectively. Teams will often set big men in the high post and run dribble handoffs or backdoor cuts around those guys. Teams run a ton offense through their big men to get their guards and forwards better shots.\n\nHere we see Nikola Jokic, the best passing big in the NBA run the offense from the top of the key. Emmanuel Mudiay sees the Dallas defender too high on him so he makes a timely backdoor cut straight for the basket. Jokic sees this and hits the cutting Mudiay for a layup.\n\nBig men today are increasingly used in the passing game, their skill sets are being put to good use, but it’s more than just in the half court.\n\nThe concept of the point forward has so often associated with small forwards like LeBron James and Kevin Durant, do-it-all players who are adept at handling the ball. But as time has gone on more and more big men have picked up the trait.\n\nDraymond Green is perhaps the NBA’s best point forward. In this play, he rips down the rebound and immediately pushes the ball in transition using his speed. He gets down the court and uses his playmaking ability to find a wide open Livingston for an easy basket.\n\nHaving a point forward is so vital in today’s NBA. The fact that your big man can get a rebound instead of a guard waiting for a pass lets the whole team run down in transition and get easy baskets.\n\nPerhaps the most important element in today’s NBA is defensive versatility. We once again see the importance of Draymond Green. The Warriors switch on every defensive matchup. Generally having a big man cover a guard is a mismatch every time, but with Green’s ability to cover positions 1–5 there is no drop off with this defensive system.\n\nNBA coaches have started employing smaller lineups with big men that are able to cover opposing guards. At the least, those big men need to play strong P&R defense if they hope to earn minutes. There’s a reason we see Mo Bamba, the 7’0” 220 lbs skinny big man go so early, his lack of muscle is not crucial as his athleticism and shooting ability.\n\nIs The Post Game Dead?\n\nSo it might seem like every point we’re going for is that big men are banned from posting up, but that would make no sense. Posting up is still a talent that is tough to guard 1 on 1. The art of “posting up” has evolved into more of a “face up” game.\n\nThe face-up game is nothing new for the NBA, but nowadays we more often see big men set up 10–15 ft away from the basket and use a combination of their jump shot, dribble drive, and post moves to score baskets.\n\nHere we see Karl-Anthony Towns set up on the baseline isolated 1 on 1. Notice how teams can’t double him because he faced up, he would easily find his teammates. Towns is covered by Joel Embiid, one of the best defenders in the NBA. Towns drives towards the basket and when he gets double teamed he comes into a sort of “semi-post” where he uses fantastic footwork and a sweet up & under move to score the basket.\n\nWe still see big men in the traditional post up like in this play where Embiid uses a series of nice moves to get to the basket. Nowadays players will still set up in the low post, but we don’t see the deliberate banging of bodies using 5 seconds to get closer to the basket. We see big men carve out space before they get the ball and if they’re near the basket they use finesse to whip around their defender and get quick baskets.\n\nThe bigger aspect with the post game that we see today is more of that face up where big men will drive from 10–15 ft out using their athleticism and craftiness to get baskets. With the new age of big men typically being of that mold, it’s a style that works out.\n\nMaking The Transition\n\nIn an age where a new breed of big men have come in and stole the spotlight, we forget about the many big men that have transitioned their game to fit this new era. Al Horford, Marc Gasol, and Brook Lopez would have been out of the league years ago if they couldn’t evolve their game.\n\nThese big men have become more versatile by adding the three-pointer to their arsenal, a simple fix that kept them in the league. Gasol was a traditional big man that banged down in the post, the modern era was not welcoming to him, but developing his shot aided his playmaking ability which opened up passing lanes for his team.\n\nSomeone like Al Horford developed a shot keeping him as one of the most valuable all-around big men in the game. His ability to shoot helped his team ten folds, his improved handles allowed him to operate as the point forward for the pass-centric Boston Celtics.\n\nThen there’s the group of players that would not be considered obsolete in this day & age, but developed their game for the better. The aforementioned Andre Drummond, for example, developed a nice post hook a few years ago, but stopped working on his post moves and fixed up his handles to work on his face-up game, which is much improved this year.\n\nDrummond’s teammate, Blake Griffin was once upon a time just a low post banger with no jump shot. Now he’s a premier jump shooter who has the handles and playmaking ability of a guard. He can post you up, stretch you out, or just drive from the perimeter.\n\nAnthony Davis developed a three and turned into a full-fledged point forward. DeMarcus Cousins did the same. All the elite big men have taken the necessary steps to improve their skill sets to fit the modern NBA. There’s no point perfecting the post hook when the face up is more important. These big men know that, and they’ve embraced the change.\n\nDoes “Pace & Space” Work?\n\nIn the NBA today, teams love to employ lineups with 4 or 5 guys that can hit the three ball, it gives much more versatility. But is that a model that has worked for basketball?\n\nLooking at the numbers from almost 20 years ago, FGA rose by 8.1 per game. The pace in the NBA today is evident, teams are taking 8.5 more shots per 48 minutes. With teams putting an emphasis on getting into transition, we see a spike in shot attempts just about every year.\n\nPerhaps the more mind-boggling stat, measuring from 18 years ago 3PA has spiked by a whopping 27.5. NBA teams have clearly put a priority on shooting a lot of threes, better spacing is the key to opening up the whole floor.\n\nIn the end, the stat that tells the whole story is the one you see in the PPG column. A 15.3 PPG rise since 2000 tells you all you need to know. The shooting, the spacing has opened up the entire floor for those ball dominant players who aim to get in the lane. Since his days in Miami, LeBron James has played with lineups filled with elite shooters, teams that allow him to be the best version of himself.\n\nThat versatility of having your big man be able to shoot and/or run the floor opens up the offense to new heights. The “pace & space” era has made the NBA one of the most entertaining things to watch on any given night.\n\nHas Anyone Tried To Bring It Back?\n\nThe post game is a dying art, but it’s not dead yet. The past few years many players have come into the NBA with their biggest asset being their low post game.\n\nJahlil Okafor is a prime example of that. The 6’11” 275 lbs big man came into the league in 2015 as the no. 3 overall pick from Duke. Okafor was nasty in the post, he averaged 17.5 PPG and 7.0 RPG as a rookie.\n\nDespite the offensive production, Okafor was a huge liability on defense. And more than that Okafor was unathletic, he was not able to fit into the mold of the modern NBA. So naturally, Okafor saw his minutes and desirability slowly diminish as he now sits on the end of teams’ benches hoping to transform his body to fit today’s NBA.\n\nDeAndre Ayton is an interesting case. The 7’1” 250 lbs big man has a pure NBA ready body. One of the many traits that got him drafted no. 1 overall to the Phoenix Suns. Ayton has the low post game of someone like Okafor, but he has an ultra reliable mid-range shot and A+ athleticism to go along with it.\n\nIn a league where the post-game is diminishing, Ayton seems to routinely dominate down low, yet the Suns are hesitant to put him down there. Some people call it bad coaches, others say it’s adapting to the times.\n\nThere’s a line between misusing talent and fitting a team’s system. It’s each coach’s responsibility to figure out where exactly that line starts and ends. Big men will always be big, but their roles have changed, who knows what we’ll see in another 20 years."
