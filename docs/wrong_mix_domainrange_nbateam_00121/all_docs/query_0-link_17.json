        "text": "Obviously, Durant is one of the greatest players of all time. Williams explained that Brown having his name mentioned as the potential centerpiece in a deal for Durant just shows how great the Celtics star is. “It kind of shows how valuable he is. The fact that, top-10 player in the world, you’re the focal point. It’s one of those things, I remember, back in the day with Al Jefferson and KG [Kevin Garnett]. It’s one of those things where you’re like, ‘oh dang, Al Jefferson.’ It’s not even like a difference,” said Williams.\n\nJustin Kubatko: Gordon Hayward last night: ✅ 30 PTS ✅ 7 REB ✅ 13-16 FG The only player in @Charlotte Hornets history to record a higher FG% in a 30-point game is Al Jefferson (83.3%). With their 109-98 win, the Hornets ended a 16-game losing streak versus the Sixers. pic.twitter.com/vgLcWsZq0h"
