        "text": "Jefferson Capital has always been willing to offer creative solutions that meet our current business needs. We have closed multiple transactions with them and fully expect that to continue. We recently went onsite to audit their policies and procedures, and they passed with flying colors.\n\nAuto Finance Originator Corporate Finance Manager\n\nJefferson Capital was our preferred buyer due to their solid reputation. Because they were new to our portfolio, their pricing was slightly short of our expectations. But we allowed them the opportunity to gain experience at their price and after just a few months, they were able to increase their pricing. We ultimately entered into a long-term forward flow.\n\nCredit Card Originator Portfolio Manager\n\nJefferson Capital is our partner of choice. We trust them to provide a competitive price and a solid compliance program. We have been business partners for many, many years and that will continue. We like their transparency in day to day communications.\n\nRetail Installment Lender Director of Recovery\n\nFor us, customer experience is everything and it is essential to growing our platform. By partnering with Jefferson Capital, we were able to do business with an experienced debt buyer, and more importantly protect and grow our brand.\n\nFinTech Lender Director of Collections\n\nAfter several years of experience with Jefferson Capital, seeing first-hand their excellent consumer support, and obtaining market best pricing, it was very easy for us to decide to continue our relationship with them.\n\nTelecommunications Provider Debt Sales Manager\n\nWe hadn't sold accounts in several years. We appreciated Jefferson Capital's patience throughout the process. They were able to get us up to speed on current debt sale practices and meet our pricing expectations. We partnered with them because of their strong track record of compliance and ability to meet our customer care expectations.\n\nEnergy Utility Director of Collections\n\nOur business strategy was to outsource 100% of our recovery servicing. We had never considered selling before. Jefferson Capital offered a solution that gave us immediate economics through a debt sale. Their competitive price, combined with our confidence in their compliance and privacy program, made this an excellent choice for us.\n\nHealthcare Finance Company Accounts Receivable Manager"
