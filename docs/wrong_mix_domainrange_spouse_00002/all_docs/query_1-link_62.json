MT\n\nCANNES FILM FESTIVAL | 12 â 23 MAY 2020\n\nIn his series on underrated British directors, Alan Price looks at two films from English filmmaker Daniel Birt (1907-55) who started his career in the cutting room with Channel Crossing (1933) and went on to make thrillers and TV fare before his early death at 47.\n\nOn consulting Brian McFarlaneâs âThe Encyclopedia of British Filmâ (2003) I found this entry for Daniel Birt: âIt seems unlikely that anyone will try to elevate Oxford-educated Daniel Birt to auteur status but one of his films is striking enough to deserve attention.â\n\nThat film is The Three Weird Sisters (1948), a fascinating semi-Gothic melodrama and quasi critique of capitalism, set in rural Wales. But thereâs another Birt film worthy of attention: his remarkable drama No Room at the Inn (also 1948) about child evacuees of the Second World War in Northern England.\n\nLike McFarlane I would hesitate to call Daniel Birt an auteur, but who knows for sure? Many of his films are hard to see (From 1935 to 1956 he directed just under ten films.) The invaluable TV channel Talking Pictures has recently screened Inn. Perhaps other Birt films will materialise so we can judge him better? Heâs certainly a subject for further research.\n\nWhatâs also distinctive about these two films is that they were co-written by Dylan Thomas. The Welsh poet was employed to re-write dialogue and change scenes; though maybe not paid to criticise, even scorn Welsh identity, local bureaucracy and insert a fairy-tale element into one of the stories. A case for complete authorship on these collaborations begins to throw up an interesting debate between writer and director.\n\nThe Three Weird Sisters (A deliberate nod here to the three witches in Macbeth) depicts three old fashioned and elderly women (played by Nancy Price, Mary Clare and Mary Merrall) living in a decrepit mansion near a disused mining village in Wales. The former mine collapses and destroys some property. The concerned sisters wish to rebuild the houses but have no money to do so. They call on Owen (Raymond Lovell) their local businessman brother to help them. On arriving at his sistersâ place Owen refuses financial aid. The sisters then devise a plot to kill him through poisoning his drink. It fails, so they continue on him whilst also attempting to murder Owenâs secretary Claire (Nova Pilbeam) the heir to his fortune.\n\nThe plot indicates some obvious shaky melodramatics yet The Three Weird Sisters keeps shifting tone: from a socialist condemnation of the wealthy, a horror comedy, a thriller and a romance between the secretary and the local doctor. On top of this are the machinations of the sisters, controlled by the blind Gertrude, needing to preserve their family name and traditions whatever the cost. Birt and Thomasâs switching from the creepy, the romantic and the political meshes quite well, giving the film an odd originality, while Birtâs visual style often reveals a deft eye for detail and imagery â numerous shots of the sisters on a rickety staircase, as unpredictable as themselves, hold your attention.\n\nThe filmâs political rant is a denunciation of the Welsh nation and an attack on the inequality of a political system that exploited the village for coal, and then deserted it. One strange but memorable scene is worth describing; Nova Pilbeam flees the house to inform the local police of the sistersâ intentions. On receiving short shrift from the local constabulary she leaves to find Mabli Hughes (Hugh Griffiths) an out-of-work miner. Heâs seated on a little hill near the neglected mine, addressing a group of four dogs, as if to rouse the workers against the system. âHere in Cumblast all social evils are condensed and crystallised. This one village may be regarded as the hub, the nucleus of a microcosm, of all Pluto-democratic, inevitable inequality.â Thatâs quite a hyperbolic mouthful and not the kind of dialogue youâd normally expect to find in a British film of the late 1940s. Understandably the secretary considers the minerâs speech to be sincere (if half-crazy) and quickly realises heâs reluctant to help her.\n\nAlthough Dylan Thomasâs script is frequently perversely opinionated, it becomes the glue that holds the film together: best realised in the determined character of the secretary and Nova Pilbeam brings great conviction to her role. Itâs the best written and least stereotyped part in The Three Weird Sisters. Sheâs feisty in her attempt to bring some common sense and order amidst the gothic strains of the filmâs plot. Like her performance, when a young girl, in Hitchcockâs first version of The Man Who Knew Too Much (1932) Pilbeam may appear on the surface to be âover-sweetâ and too posh but underneath the surface charm sheâs a no-nonsense woman, confident and focused. Nova isnât going to be put down by incompetent men and dangerous women (nearly all the female characters in The Three Weird Sisters and No Room at the Inn are more strongly realised than the men.)\n\nA sense of the Gothic also infiltrates No Room at the Inn set in the early months of 1940. We witness atmospheric blitzed streets by the railway bridge next to a rundown house thatâs definitely on the wrong side of the tracks: all lorded over by Mrs Agatha Voray (Freda Jackson) doing her damn best not to properly look after three young girl evacuees. The children live in squalor and suffer mental and physical abuse under the care of this coarse woman who invites men (local councillors and shopkeepers) for casual sex and bit of cash to bolster her shopping allowance of ration coupons.\n\nNo Room at the Inn was adapted from a play that opened in 1945 at the Embassy Theatre in Swiss Cottage, London. Like the film it was very successful, causing The Daily Express in 1946 to devote considerable space to the plight of orphaned children in unchecked private homes. You could argue that by the time the film version appeared in 1948 public attention was drawn to a social problem in the manner that television did much later with Ken Loachâs Cathy Come Home (1966), exposing a nationwide housing crisis.\n\nThe character of the schoolteacher Judith Drave (Joy Shelton) is remarkable, for we have â like the secretary of The Three Weird Sisters â a force for truth-seeking that refuses to be silenced. A powerfully written and acted moment occurs when Miss Drave, who has complained about Mrs Vrangâs behaviour, is asked to give evidence at a town councillorsâ meeting. They dislike Ms Draveâs assertive manner. When Mrs.Voray has her right to reply she adopts the manner of a humble woman struggling to do her best during wartime restrictions. The schoolteacher sees right through her performance. But the council members (half of whom have flirted with Voray) believe her account of things over the teacherâs. I love Dylan Thomasâs writing here. His social concern is angrily targeted at bureaucratic corruption and ineptitude. And itâs much better integrated into the plot than the politics of The Three Weird Sisters.\n\nLike The Three Weird Sisters there are fascinating if disconcerting alterations of tone â such as the beautifully written bedtime story scene in the room of the young girl evacuees. Norma Bates (yes, not Norman, though the film has its moments of Hitchcockian darkness) who is played by Joan Dowling, re-interprets the Cinderella story in a ripe, savagely Cockney manner. She comforts the children who are desperate to escape the mean house and its mean housekeeper. Itâs a spellbinding moment of Dylan Thomas poetics: a joyful spin on Cinderella, beautifully shot and executed. And its lyricism is made more poignant by intercutting with Mrs Voray in the pub getting drunk with the sailor father of one of the evacuees.\n\nNo Room at the Inn often seems prescient of much later British films about master and slave relationships between adults and children. It recalls Jack Claytonâs woefully neglected Our Motherâs House (1967) and Andrew Birkinâs adaptation of Ian McEwanâs novel The Cement Garden (1993). They all contain seedy and claustrophobic forces about to explode into violent revenge. Without divulging the ending of No room at the Inn I can reveal that â for the film version â Dylan Thomas was supposed to have radically changed the circumstances surrounding Mrs.Vorayâs demise. And the filmâs final 15 minutes turn remarkably dark and intense, avoiding histrionics, as the story inevitably descends into pathos, suspense and horror. Thereâs a scary What Ever Happened to Baby Jane moment when Mrs Voray, cheated by a would-be lover, returns home drunk and furious; ascends the stairs to attack the children, looking a for a moment like a demented Bette Davis.\n\nNeither of these two films is without flaws. The ending of No Room at the Inn is too abrupt â though the story is told in one extended flashback, I felt it should have returned to its opening scenes where a now adult Norma is caught shoplifting: while Hermoine Baddeley, playing Vorayâs accomplice, Mrs Waters, gives a truly terrible and grating performance. As for The Three Weird Sisters I found some of the humour, centring on grumpy brother Owenâs health, to be overplayed and though the film admirably attempts to wriggle out of its obvious âold dark house territoryâ it doesnât quite succeed.\n\nYet putting these reservations to one side what still impressed me, on a second viewing, were many of the performances. Freda Jackson brings a full-blooded intensity to the role of the selfish and uncaring Aggie Voray. She was a sensation in the play and thatâs why they made a film version which launched her considerable career on stage and in the cinema. Jackson probably became a role model for actors portraying more authentic working class women. I wonder if Pat Phoenix (Elsie Tanner) of Coronation Street was influenced by her? As for all of the child actors in No Room at the Inn well theyâre brilliant â especially Joan Dowling whoâs street-wise confidence cannot hide her emotional damage. She deserved a prize but unfortunately the BAFTAs didnât begin until 1954.\n\nThis is notable British Cinema of 1948. And these two strange and atypical productions struck me as remarkably individual for their time. Whether it was Daniel Birt or Dylan Thomas who was most responsible for their power Iâll leave you to decide. Neither film is on DVD. You can see No Room at the Inn on âTalking Picturesâ (should be up for another screening soon.) As for The Three Weird Sisters, that can only be found as a rough, but still watchable copy, on YouTube. Alan Price.\n\nNOW ON TALKING PICTURES | JUNE 2020\n\nDresden 1918, Robert Siodmak left his upper-middle class, orthodox Jewish home in this epicentre of European modern art, to join a theatre touring company. He was 18, and this was the first of many radical changes that would see him becoming a pioneer of film noir, and directing 56 feature films fraught with (anti)heroes who are morose, malevolent, violent and generally downbeat (spoilers).\n\nRobert Siodmak began his film career in 1925, translating inter-titles. Later he learnt the editing business with Harry Piel. In 1927/28 he worked under Kurt (Curtis) Bernhardt (Das letzte Fort) and Alfred Lind. But MENSCHEN AM SONNTAG (1929/30) (left) would transform his professional life forever. Together with Edgar G. Ulmer, he would direct a semi-documentary, social realist portrait that pictured ordinary Berliners, far away from the expensive âIllusionsfilmeâ (escapist films) of the UFA. The idea was the brainchild of Robertâs younger brother Curt (born in Kracow), who would become a screen-writer and director of Horror/SF films, and follow his brother and Ulmer to Hollywood â along with the rest of the team: Billy Wilder, Eugen SchÃ¼fftan, Fred Zinnemann and Rochus Gliese (later art director for Murnauâs Sunrise). Robert Siodmak, Ulmer and Giese would also be part of the âRemigrantsâ, film makers, who would return to Germany after 1945.\n\nMENSCHEN AM SONNTAG was filmed on a succession of Sundays in 1929. Subtitled âa film without actorsâ â which is misleading, since the actors â non-professionals â co-wrote and co-produced the film, had already returned to their day jobs when the film was premiered in 1930. The five main protagonists spend a weekend near a lake in a Berlin suburb: Wolfgang (a wine seller) and Christl (a mannequin) meet for the first time at the Bahnhof Zoo by accident on Saturday morning, Christl had been stood up. On the same evening, Erwin (a taxi driver) and his girl friend Annie have a violent quarrel, tearing up each otherâs photos. As a result, Erwin and his friend Wolfgang travel with Christl on the following Sunday to the Nicolas Lake. And here on the âbeachâ Wolfgang meets Brigitte (a vinyl record sales assistant), the four spend the day together; intercut with images of the forlorn âstay-at-homeâ Annie. The final scene returns the quartet to the heart of the metropolis: four million waiting for another Sunday. MENSCHEN AM SONNTAG is a chronicle; a document shot against the narrative UFA style of the day. There is no story, just interaction. Even in the complex narratives of his films Noir, Siodmak would always be the bystander, the person who observes much more than directs.\n\nINQUEST (VORUNTERSUCHUNG), Robert Siodmakâs third feature film as a director, produced in 1931, is his first âKriminalfilmâ (thriller). The student Fritz Bernt (Gustaf FrÃ¶hlich), has a three year-long affair with the prostitute Erna â he also receives money from her. After falling in love with his friend Walterâs sister, Fritz wants to leave Erna. Out of cowardice, he sends Walter to her flat to break the news. But Walter sleeps with Ernaâs flatmate and goes for a drink afterwards. When Ernaâs body is found the next morning, Fritz is the main suspect. In charge of the inquest is Dr. Bienert (Albert Bassermann), who happens to be Walterâs father. The denouement is a surprise. In many ways, INQUEST is a âStrassenfilmâ, Kracauerâs definition of films where the middle-class protagonist is in love with a sexy prostitute, but goes home to roost, marrying a bourgeois girl of his own class. Some of the main scenes of the film are shot in the staircase of the house where Erna lives, the shadowy lighting clearly foreshadowing Siodmakâs Noir period. Sexuality is the enemy of bourgeois society here, and Bassermannâs Dr. Bienert is a blustering patriarch, who would sacrifice anyone to save his son.\n\nTHE BURNING SECRET (BRENNENDES GEHEIMNIS) is based on a novel by Stefan Zweig. Shot in 1932, it was to be Siodmakâs last German film for 23 years. In a Swiss Sanatorium, the twelve-year old Edgar (H.J. Schaufuss) is bored, and pleased to befriend Baron Von Haller (Willi Forst), a racing driver. But he does not know that Von Haller is using him to get close to his mother (Hilde Wagner). Soon Edgar gets suspicious, the two adults always want to be alone. He surprises them in flagrante and runs home to his father, although he does not give his secret away. When his mother arrives, he looks at her knowingly, but stays âmumâ. Siodmak has sharpened the edges of this coming-of-age story, the novel concentrating more on romantic and psychological aspects. There is real violence between Edgar and Von Haller, and the lovemaking of the adulterous couple, which Edgar interrupts, is more vicious than affectionate. When the film was premiered in March 1933, Siodmak was already living in Paris, and Goebbels denounced the film as un-German, not surprisingly, since both the author of the novel and the director of the film were Jews living abroad in exile.\n\nWhen Siodmak shot MOLLENARD (1937) in France, it would be the penultimate of his French-set features. (In 1938, he would finish âUltimatumâ for the fatally ill Robert Wiene; and in the same year he is credited with âartistic supervisionâ for Vendetta, directed by Georges Kelber). MOLLENARD (HATRED) is the nearest to a film Noir so far: it is a fight to the death between Captain Mollenard (Harry Baur) and his wife Mathide (Gabrielle Dorziat). Captain Mollenard is a gun runner in Shanghai, he is shown as a hero, a good friend to his crew. When he returns to Dunkirk and his wife and two children, illness renders him powerless to his vitriolic wife, who tries to turn the children against him. Mollenard attempts to use his strength to re-conquer his wife, but fails, unlike during his days in Shanghai. The son takes the side of his mother, the daughter tries to drown herself, but Mollenard saves her. In the end, his crew carries the dying man out of the house, he would end his life where he was most happy â at sea. MOLLENARD is a contrast between utopia and dystopia for the main protagonist: the sea, where he is free (to commit crimes), and the bourgeois home, where he is a prisoner of conventions. He is unable to survive in this which cold, emotionless prison. MOLLENARD is seen as his greatest film in France, a dramatic version of Noir.\n\nPIÃGES (1939) was Siodmakâs last French film before emigrating to the USA â and his greatest box-office success of this period. Whilst most of Siodmakâs French films featured fellow emigrÃ©s in front and behind the camera, PIÃGES only has the co-author, Ernst Neubach, as a fellow emigrÃ©â the DOP, Ted Pahle, was American, and the star, Maurice Chevalier, already an legend was very much a Frenchman: Siodmak had established himself. (A fact, which would count for nothing at the start of his US career.) PIÃGES is the story of a serial killer who murders eleven women in the music-hall world of Paris. The police, whose main suspect is the night-club-owner and womaniser Fleury (Chevalier), chooses Arienne (the debutant Marie Dea), to lure the murderer into the open. But Arienne falls in love with Fleuryâs associate BrÃ©montiÃ¨re, only to find out that he is the murderer. In the end the gutsy Arienne (Dea is a subtle antithesis to the French heroines of this period) has to risk her lift to save her husband Fleuryâs. There are more than a few clues to the later âPhantom Ladyâ in PIÃGES. Eric von Stroheim is brilliant as a mad fashion czar who has lost his fortune and adoring women.\n\nSON OF DRACULA (1943) was already Robert Siodmakâs seventh film in Hollywood, his first for Universal. Scripted by his brother Curt, SON OF DRACULA was a great risk for Robert, it was his first outing in the classical Horror genre, not to mention the great âDracula traditionâ started by Ted Browning in 1931. The film is set in the bayous of Louisianna, where Katherine Caldwell has inherited the plantation âDark Oaksâ from her father, who died suddenly under mysterious circumstances. She gives a party, and entertains Count Alucard (Lon Chaney jr.) an acquaintance from her travels in central Europe. She discards her fiancÃ©e Frank and marries Alucard. Frank shoots the count, but the bullet passes through him, killing Katherine. In prison, Katherine visits him as a bat, turning into her human form (a first in film history), and asking Frank to kill Alucard, so they can live together forever as vampires. Frank grants her wish, but also burns her in her coffin. SON OF DRACULA is pure gothic horror, but suffered from Lon Chaney jr. being miscast in a role created by Bela Lugosi as his Alter Ego. Strongest are the scenes in the bayous, where the evil still lurks after the death of Katherine and Alucard: everything seems toxic, the spell of the vampire lives on.\n\nCOBRA WOMAN (1943) was Robert Siodmakâs first film in colour, shot in widescreen Technicolor. Its star, Maria Montez, an aristocrat from the Dominican Republic, whose real name was Maria Africa Garcia Vidal de Santo Silas, would later gain cult status after her early death at the age of 39 from a heart attack in her bathtub in Paris. Maria plays Tollea, who is whisked away just before her wedding to Ramu, to her birth island where her evil twin sister Naja (also played by Montez) holds sway. Ramu and his helper Kado follow her, but Tollea has decided to sacrifice her love for Ramu to become the new ruler of the island, so as to prevent an eruption of the volcano provoked by Najaâs sins. COBRA WOMAN is pure camp, Siodmak said âit was nonsense, but funâ.\n\nIn 1943 Siodmak was on a roll: he would make four film that year, and PHANTOM LADY (1943) was also the most important of his American period to date: the first of a quartet, which would form with The Spiral Staircase, The Killers and Criss Cross, the classic Noir films of their creator.\n\nPHANTOM LADY is based on a novel by Cornell Woolrich (William Irish), a prolific writer, whose novels and short stories were the basis for twenty films Noir of the classic period. They also provided the basis for Nouvelle Vague fare. Pivotal in Woolrichâs novels is the race against time. Scott Henderson, an engineer, is accused of murdering his wife. He proclaims his innocence, but is sentenced to death. His secretary Carol âKansasâ Richman (Ella Raines) is convinced he is not a murderer, and together with inspector Burges, she sets out to find the real culprit. Hendersonâs alibi is a woman with a flamboyant hat, he meets in a bar, and spends the evening with, while his wife was murdered â but they promised not to reveal their identities. The mystery woman is illusive and when Carol tries to unravel her identity, the barman, who to denies having seen her at all, is run over by a car shortly after interviewed by Richman. Another witness, a drummer (Elisha Cook. Jr.), is also murdered, before Richman corners Franchot Tone, an artist, and Richmanâs best friend as the murderer: he had an affair with Richmanâs wife. German expressionism and Siodmakâs customary near documentary style dominate: New York is a bed of intrigue, where shadows lurk and footsteps signal danger. The majority of scenes could be watched without dialogue, particularly Cookâs drummer solo, which fits in well with the impressionist dÃ©cor. With PHANTOM LADY, Robert Siodmak had found his (sub)genre.\n\nCHRISTMAS HOLIDAY (1944), based on a novel by Somerset Maugham, has a most misleading title and is perhaps Siodmakâs most exotic film Noir. Lt. Mason, on Christmas leave, is delayed in New Orleans, where he meets the singer Jackie Lamont (Deanna Durham) who tells him her real name is Abigail Manette, and that her husband Robert (Gene Kelly) is in jail for murdering his bookie. In a long flashback, we see Robertâs mother trying to cover up her sonâs crime. After Jackie leaves Mason, she is confronted in a roadhouse by Robert who has escaped from jail. Before he can shoot her, a policemanâs bullet kills him. Like âPhantom Ladyâ, CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY is photographed again by Woody Bredell, New Orleans is a tropical, outlandish setting and the film has much more the feel of a French film-noir than an American. Siodmak uses Wagnerâs âLiebestodâ to frame the love story of the doomed couple.\n\nTHE SUSPECT (1944) is one of Siodmakâs less convincing Noirs. Philip Marshall (Charles Laughton), a sedentary middle-aged man, is driven out by his heartless wife Cora, and falls in love with the much younger Mary (Ella Raines). Philip becomes a different person, and thrives with his new love. But Cora finds out about the couple and threatens Philip with disclosure, which would have ruined him professionally. He kills first Cora, then his neighbour Gilbert Simmons, who blackmails him. Inspector Huxley has no proof against him, and Philip could start a new life with his young wife in Canada, but he decides to stay and give himself up, just as Huxley had predicted. Shot entirely in a studio, THE SUSPECT lacks suspense, and is only remarkable for Laughtonâs brilliant performance.\n\nTHE STRANGE AFFAIR OF UNCLE HARRY (1945) features a semi-incestuous relationship between brother and sister: John âHarryâ Quincy (George Sanders) lives a quiet life in New Hampshire with his sisters Lettie (Geraldine Fitzgerald) and Hester. When he meets the fashion designer Deborah Brown (Ella Raines), he falls in love with her. Lettie is jeaulous, and feigns a heart attack. Harry wants to murder her, but Hester drinks the poison intended for Lettie, who is convicted for Hesterâs murder, but does not give away the real culprit, since she knows that her death will prevent Harry from marrying Deborah. To mollify The âMPAA code agencyâ, Siodmak found a new ending: Harry wakes up at, having only dreamt the events; producer Joan Harrison resigned from the project in protest. Lettie is a psychopath in the vein of the murderer in Phantom Lady and Olivia de Havillandâs murderous twin in The Dark Mirror. But there is more ambiguity to the narrative than is obvious at first sight: there is a vey clear resemblance between Lettie and Deborah â they might have been exchangeable for Harry. THE STRANGE AFFAIR OF UNCLE HARRY is one of the darkest Noirs, because all is played out on the background of a very respectable family, in small town America.\n\nTHE SPIRAL STAIRCASE (1945) is Siodmakâs most famous Noir, a classic because of its old-dark-house setting and the woman-in-peril theme. In a small town in New England, handicapped women are being murdered. Helen (Dorothy McGuire) is watching a silent movie in town, where a lame woman is strangled. Helen then hurries home, to look after the family matriarch Mrs. Warren (Ethel Barrymore), who is bedridden. Since Helen is mute, she is in mortal danger: the killer lives in the house. When Helen finds the body of Blanche, who was engaged to Albert Warren (George Brent), after having left his half-brother Steve, Helen suspects Stephen and locks him in the cellar; then she tries to phone Dr. Parry, but she cannot communicate. Too late she finds out that Albert is the killer, who chases her up the spiral staircase, but his mother gets up and shoots him, causing Helen, who lost her voice after witnessing the traumatic death of her parents, to cry out loud. Very little of the background to the narrative has been mentioned: the theme being eugenics, a concept the late President Theodore Roosevelt was very keen on. Albert Warren has taken this concept a step further; he kills âweak and imperfectâ humans because he believes his father would be proud of him. Like T. Roosevelt, Albertâs father was a big-game hunter. In his motherâs bedroom is a poster with a Teddy Roosevelt lookalike and the initials âTRâ above an elephantâs tusk. Considering the Nazi Euthanasia programmes, this aspect of THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE has often been neglected by critics.\n\nTHE DARK MIRROR (1946) reflects Hollywoodâs interest in Freud. Two identical sisters, Terry and Ruth Collins, both played by Olivia de Havilland, are suspected of murder, when one of the womenâs suitors is found dead. Inspector Stevenson is fascinated by the two woman, but would not have solved the crime without the help of Dr. Elliot, a psychoanalyst. He finds out that whilst Ruth is a very adjusted and loving person, Terry is just her opposite: a ruthless psychopath, who fabricates clues, to make Ruth look like the murderess, whilst at the same time is planning to kill her sister, before Dr. Elliot is able to expose her. Siodmak deals with the âDoppelgÃ¤ngerâ theme, which was explored as early as in the silent film era of expressionism, by using Freudian theory to explain the perversity of the âevilâ sister: rejection, confusion and lastly alienation let her spin out of control, allowing only âherselfâ to survive. Unlike in The Spiral Staircase, the interior is totally unthreatening, which makes Terryâs murderous lust even more terrifying.\n\nTIME OUT OF MIND (1946/7) is more melodrama than Noir. Chris Fortune (Robert Hutton), the son of a heartless and ambitious shipping tycoon, falls in love with the servant girl Kate (Phyllis Calvert). But in 19th century New England, this was not the social norm. Kate encourages Chris to marry a lady of his class, who turns out to be a beast and drives Chris more into alcohol dependency. Chris fancies himself as a composer, but only Kate believes in his talent. The Noir aspect is the family constellation: Chris is obviously weak, and his overbearing father (Leo G. Carroll) rules over his life. More to the point, Chrisâs sister Rissa (Ella Raines) seemingly protects her younger brother, but is in reality totally obsessed by him. She represents the semi-incestuous theme running, not only through Siodmakâs, noir films.\n\nCRISS CROSS (1949) is perhaps Siodmakâs most personal Noir. Reworking elements of The Killers â and casting Burt Lancaster again in the role of the obsessed lover -, CRISS CROSS is the story of an âamour fouâ, its emotional intensity on par with Tourneurâs classic Out of the Past. Steve Thompson (Lancaster) is still in love with his ex wife Anna (Yvonne De Carlo), who now lives with the gangster Slim Dundee (Dan Duryea). But when the two of them meet in a bar, the whole things starts up again. Dundee surprises them, Thompson comes up with an excuse: he needs Dundeeâs help for an armed car robbery. But Dundee is suspicious: he and his gang kill Thompsonâs partner and wound him after the robbery. When Anna goes missing with the money, Dundee suspects the couple have double-crossed him. Dundee has Thompson abducted, but Thompson bribes his captors and finds Anna. She is terrified by the thought that Dundee will find them and wants to abandon the wounded Steve, but Dundee arrives and shoots them both, before running towards the police. The final scene, when Annaâs and Steveâs bodies fall literally into each other, bullets flying as the police sirenâs grow louder, is the apotheosis of everything thatâs gone on since the scene in the bar. From then on, in true Noir fashion, all is told in flashbacks and voice-over narration. Anna is the quintessential Noir heroine, telling Steve: âAll those things which have happened weâll forget it. You see, I make you forget it. After itâs done, after itâs all over and we are safe, it will be just you and me. The way it shouldâve been all along from the startâ. CRISS CROSS is my personal favourite: dark, expressionistic, melancholic and wonderfully doomed.\n\nTHE GREAT SINNER (1948/9) is an awkward mixture of high literature and low-brow melodrama. Based partly on Dostoyevskyâs novel âThe Gamblerâ and some autobiographical details of this author, Siodmak struggles to bring this expensive âA-pictureâ to life. The stars Gregory Peck (Fedya) and Ava Gardener (Pauline Ostrovsky) â in the first of three collaborations â do their best, but Christopher Isherwoodâs script is a hotchpotch of the sensational and sentimental, tragic events unfold fast and furiously, logic and characterisation falling by the wayside. Told in a long flash-back, Pauline receives a manuscript from the dying writer Fedya, in which he tells the story of their first meeting in 1860 in Wiesbaden. Then, Fedya met Pauline on a train journey from Paris to Moscow, but follows her to the casino in Wiesbaden, to study the effects of gambling on the whole Ostrovsky clan. When Pitard, a gambler and friend of Pauline, steals Fedyaâs money, the latter tries to save Pitard from his fate, and gives him the money so he can leave the city. But Pitard loses in the casino and shoots himself. Strangely enough, Fedya, who has fallen in love with Pauline, also becomes addicted to gambling â but telling himself, that he wants to win the money, so that Paulineâs father can pay back his debts to the casino owner Armand, and thus free Pauline from the engagement to the ruthless tycoon. But after some early success, Fedya looses heavily, tries to in vain to pawn a religious medal, which belongs to Pauline; finally, he wants to commit suicide, before he looses consciousness. Recovered, he finishes his novel and Pauline forgives him. In spite of a strong supporting cast including Ethel Barrymore, Melvin Douglas, Agnes Moorehead and Walter Huston, THE GREAT SINNER flopped at the box-office, having cost 20 m Dollar in todayâs money, it lost 8 m Dollar. Siodmak, according to Gregory Peck, did not enjoy the responsibility of the big budget production, âhe looked like a nervous wreckâ.\n\nWith THE FILE ON THELMA JORDON (1949) Siodmak returned to the safe ground of Noir films. Thelma (Barbara Stanwyck) is unhappily married to Tony Laredo (Richard Rober), but is attracted to his animalistic sex-appeal. When she discusses burglaries at her wealthy auntâs house, where she also lives, with assistant district attorney Cleve Marshall (Wendell Correy), the two fall in love. When the aunt is killed, and a necklace stolen, Thelma is the main suspect, because Tony has been away to Chicago. Thelma is put on trial, and Cleve pays her lawyer and plans the trial strategy with him, even though he has learned about Thelmaâs past, and is convinced that she is the murderer. The auntâs butler has seen a stranger at the crime scene, but did not recognise him. Thelma, who knows that the person is Cleve, does not give his name away. She is aquitted and wants to leave town with Tony, when Cleve confronts them. Tony beats Cleve up and the couple flee, but Thelma causes an accident on purpose, in which both are killed â but not before she has confessed to the murder. In spite of this, Cleveâs career and marriage is ruined. THE FILE ON THELMA JORDON is a neat reversal on Double Indemnity, which also starred Stanwyck as the Queen of all femme fatales. But here, Thelma and Cleve really love each other, and Thelma pays for her crime with her life, and Cleve will be ostracised by society for a long time. Whilst Wilderâs couple was evil from the beginning, Siodmak gives his lovers a much more human touch. THE FILE ON THELMA JORDON was Robert Siodmakâs last American Film Noir. He would later direct two more films, which are in certain ways close to the subgenre; but he would never again achieve the greatness of his American Film Noir cycle, even his directing output would run to another 18 films.\n\nIn the THE CRIMSON PIRATE (1951/2) Siodmak was reunited with Burt Lancaster, who also produced the film. Set in the late 18th century in the Caribbean, Captain Vallo (Lancaster), is a pirate, who tries to make money from selling weapons to the rebels on the island of Cobra, lead by El Libre (Frederick Leicester). On the island, Vallo falls in love with El Libreâs daughter Conseuela (Eva Bartok). Later he has to rescue her father, and support the revolution â even against the wishes of his fellow pirates, who do not see the reason for such a good deed â since it is totally unprofitable! In a stormy finale with tanks, TNT, machine guns and an outstanding colourful airship, our hero, now in drag, wins the revolution and Consuleaâs heart. What is most surprising is the humour and lightheartedness of the production. Everything is told tongue-in-cheek, the action scenes are overwhelming and Lancaster (the ex-circus acrobat) dominates the film with his stunts. It seems hardly credible Robert Siodmak, creator of gloom and doom, dark shadows and even darker hearts, would be responsible for such an uplifting and hilarious spectacle, 15 years before Louis Malleâs equally enchanting âViva Maria!â. Ken Adam, the future âBondâ production designer, earned one of his first credits for this film.\n\nIt will never be absolutely clear why Robert Siodmak decided to leave Hollywood after he finished THE CRIMSON PIRATE, to work again in Germany (with a one-film stop in France, so as to repeat his journey of the thirties backwards). In the USA, he was offered a lucrative six-film deal and had shown with his last film, that he could now also handle big productions successfully. There are rumours of pending HUAC hearings, because of his friendship with Charles Spencer Chaplin, but Siodmak himself never mentioned these as a reason for the return to his homeland. Rather like Fritz Lang and Edgar Ulmer, it can only be assumed that âHeimwehâ was the reason for Siodmakâs return. True, he lived in Ascona, Switzerland, but he worked nearly exclusively in Germany. What he, and other âRemigrantsâ did not reckon with, was the political and cultural climate in the Federal Republic of Germany. When these directors had left Germany, the Nazis had just started the transformation of the country. But in the early fifties, the democracy of the country was not chosen, but forced on the population by the Allies. Old Nazis were still in many powerful positions, and the majority of the population still grieved, full of self-pity, about their defeat. The Third Reich, and particularly the Holocaust, were more or less Taboo, both in daily life and in all cultural referenced. The film industry also suffered from the lack of a new beginning; even Veit Harlan, director of Jud SÃ¼ss, was allowed to restart his career. It is no co-incidence that neither Lang or Ulmer produced anything notable after their return.\n\nThe same can be said for Robert Siodmak, with one exception: THE DEVIL STRIKES AT NIGHT (NACHTS WENN DER TEUFEL KAM), which he directed in 1957 was, deservedly, nominated for the âOscarâ as âBest foreign filmâ. Set during WWII in Hamburg, the film tells the story of the serial killer Bruno LÃ¼dke (Mario Adorf). When caught by inspector Kersten (Claus Holm), the latterâs superior, the Gestapo Officer Rossdorf (Hannes Messmer) points out that another man had already been âconvictedâ: Willi Keun (Wolfgang Peters), a small-time party member, had âbeen shot whilst escapingâ â without informing the population about the murders, since just a monstrous criminal did not fit in with ruling ideology of the Aryan supremacy. Both, police man and Gestapo officer, now have the difficult task to start to convince the authorities that a German serial killer was on the loose for over a decade. Both will be sent to the Eastern front, to cover up the case. The film is based on real events, Bruno LÃ¼dke (1908-1944) was mentally retarded, but may have confessed to more murders than he actually committed â to clear up unsolved murder cases. Siodmak re-creates the atmosphere of his best Noir films: the city is darkened, the image dissolves from an omniscient perspective to a particular one â particularly in the scene where LÃ¼dke is caught in the headlights of a car. Fear and excitement permeate like a black stain throughout. Kestenâs obsession with the case create a fragmented world, where the images seem to splinter. Chaos rules, and nobody seems to be safe: the hunt for LÃ¼dke, which frames the film, is shown like a haunting parable on the destructive nature of the 3rd Reich. Unfortunately, Siodmak fell short of this standard in the other 12 films directed in West Germany between 1955 and 1969.\n\nIn 1959 Siodmak worked in the Elstree-Borehamwood studios, to direct THE ROUGH AND THE SMOOTH, based on the novel by Robin Maugham. Robert Cecil Romer, 2nd Viscount Maugham, nephew of Somerset Maugham, was the enfant terrible of his family. Socialist and self-confessed homosexual, he was a very underrated novelist: The Servant, filmed in 1963 by Joseph Loosey, with Dirk Bogarde in the title role, is one of the classics of British post-WWII cinema. THE ROUGH AND THE SMOOTH shows similarities: Mike Thompson (Tony Britton), an archeologist, is engaged to Margaret (Natasha Parry), the daughter of his boss, who finances his work. Mike feels trapped in a loveless relationship, and falls for Ila Hansen (Nadja Tiller), a young and attractive woman. But she has a secret: not only is she in cahoots with the tough gangster Reg Barker (William Bendix), but there is a third man in her life, who has a hold over her. After Barker commits suicide, driven by Hansenâs demands, the latter tries also to blackmail Mike and Margaret. The ending is quiet original. There are very dark undertones, particularly for the late 50s, when Ila comments: âI donât cry much, I have been hurt a lotâ. THE ROUGH AND THE SMOOTH is a subversive film considering the context of its period. The camera pans over stultified Britain of the last 50s, where there seems to be no middle-ground between boring respectability and outright perversion. When the two worlds collide, the conflict is fought on both sides with grim, violent determination. With THE ROUGH AND THE SMOOTH, Siodmak, would, for the last time, come close to his American Noir films, for which he was called âPrince of the Shadowsâ: referring not only to the quality of the images, but also to a society, where, to quote Brecht, âwe are only aware of the ones in the light, the ones in the shadows, we donât seeâ. Robert Siodmak made sure that the ones in the shadows played the major roles in his Films Noir career.

World Premiere\n\nSUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL | 23 JANUARY â 2 FEBRUARY 2020\n\nSometimes I ask myself whatâs missing. Whatâs missing now is the dreams and enjoyment of my childhood, the sense of wonderâ\n\nWhen Robert Redford was growing up in small-town California it was wartime and there was no television back then, only radio. âThe first movie I saw was a Walt Disney. The dream was to be able to walk to a neighbourhood theatre to see it on the big screen â I could hardly wait for the weekend. What I miss with all these screening services and advanced technology is the time when you would walk into that cinema, into the darkness with all the energy of all these people around you, and the magic was seeing things on the big screenâ.\n\nTalking during the âMarrakech Conversations withâ series at this yearâs 18th edition, Redford looks frail but contemplative as he casts his mind back to his first cinema memories. âThe idea of being an actor was the sense of freedom, the freedom to act someone else. And if you were paying attention you would notice certain types of people. And you could embody these people and bring that forward as an art form. And acting is very much an art formâ.\n\nDuring his fifty years in the business, Redford has always tried to look forward, only looking back if it helped in the story telling. One of his favourite authors is Scott Fitzgerald and he had the pleasure in 1974 to be a part of that story with his film version of The Great Gatsby where he plays the Jay Gatsby in love with Mia Farrowâs Daisy. Thereâs a great line where Nick Carraway notices Gatsbyâs great love of the past, when heâs discussing with Daisy after the big party. And she says: âGatsby you canât repeat the past. And Gatsby answers: âof course you canâ.\n\nRedford was a voracious reader as a young man. The writers that influenced him were Scott Fitzgerald and Hemingway â âwhen he wasnât being too machoâ â and J D Salinger. Many of the films he went on to direct look at the past of America. But he says: âWhen I think about my country, itâs hard not to be critical because during the war when I was about five years old, I remember the energy, when everyone was getting together for the greater good (to fight Fascism in Nazi Germany). We all came together in unison, in an act that would bind us together in something that was going to be good for our country. I didnât really understand what that was, but it just felt good. That was my memory of the Second World War, that and the memory of going to the movie theatre, particularly if it was something by Walt Disneyâ. We are now in dark times and I think itâs pretty obvious to anyone reading the news that thereâs a dark wind blowing through all the countries. And in America I see so many of our liberties threatenedâ.\n\nThe most important piece of advice he can give to young actors nowadays is to âpay attentionâ. â You often hear the phrase: âGod is in the detailsâ, if thatâs true then I myself should also be paying more attention. And so when Iâm walking in my place in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Iâm often so busy thinking ahead, that I donât notice what is actually in front of me. And so Iâd think the best advice it to see what youâve actually got in front of youâ.\n\nRedford finds it sad when a lot of good directors donât get attention. âSome directors work is very one-dimensional, itâs good but itâs always the same group of people, the same themesâ One director who he feels was very side-lined was George Ray Hill. âhe was all over the map, if you look at his biography, and Iâm sad not many people have, he rises up to the top. If you think about Butch Cassidy, and you look at The Sting, heâs never really got much credit. It makes me kinda sad.â\n\nWhen he was getting ready to make Butch Cassidy Redford had just come out of a comedy on the stage in New York. He was about 28 0r 29 and Paul Newman was the confirmed star of the film, all set to play The Sundance Kid, and Redford Butch Cassidy in account of his previous comedy role. But the part that interested him was actually The Sundance Kid. So he explained this to Ray Hill when they met in a bar in New Yorkâs Third Avenue. He wanted to play the Kid based on his own experience and his sensibility of feeling like an outlaw for most of his life. Ray Hill knew Paul Newman very well, and he knew he was much more like Butch Cassidy â he was an upbeat guy. George Ray Hill appreciated the situation and turned it all around. Newman and Redford became close friends. At the time Paul Newman was highly considered, he was 42 whereas Redford was only 29. The studio didnât really want Redford in the film and Ray Hill did. So finally Newman decided to support Redford and as a result he was always grateful to him. âPaul was always a cool guy, chewing gum and smoking cigarettes and he suited the part of Butch Cassidy, but what many critics missed was that in our following film The Sting the roles were completely reversed. In Butch Cassidy I played the cool guy, and he played the happy go lucky guy. In The Sting he was the cool guy and I was the happy go lucky guy. No oneâs picked that up.â\n\nWhen asked what he thought about Sydney Pollackâs maxim that âeverything is political, even loveâ Redford raises a laugh. âWell youâll have to ask Sydney about that, but you canât because heâs deadâ. Redford enjoyed a close friendship with Sydney Pollack. The two developed a mutual trust because they had both been actors, although Pollack worked best when he was in control. The relationship drifted apart when âPollack realised he could not just be a director, he could be a mogul in control of a studio, and he started to drift out of that zone, and I donât think he was entirely happy but it had a lot to do with growing up in a Mid Western town and from under-privilege. He was aiming very high and I think he saw his way forward as being in control of everythingâ.\n\nIn Sydney Pollackâs political thriller Three Days of the Condor (1975) Redford plays a CIA character who is trying and get to the truth when he finds all his co-workers dead on returning to his office. His character Turner asks: âWho can we trust to get to the truth? Thereâs a story to telling the truth. But is it a true story?. Iâm not so sureâ. Nowadays itâs getting more difficult to get the truth everywhere in the worldâ. You have to trust your faith and your instincts. But you donât really know. Who can you really trust?. Three Days ends with a question, rather than an answer. And thatâs very relevant still today. Originally adapted from James Gradyâs book Six Days of the Condor, when asked why the film had been renamed Three Days of the Condor he replies: âit was about budgetâ. Also cutting down the time frame, tightened the tension.\n\nIn The Company You Keep (2012) trust and the search for the truth are also central themes. The bottom line here is again: âWho can you really trust to give you the truth. Someone isnât telling the truth and you have to find out who and why?\n\nRedford claims to be very focused on being socially conscious. And by this he means being aware of whatâs going on on the political front. He very much believes in questioning the truth and firmly relies on good journalism to do so â The New York Times is a trusted source â as a way of providing a counterbalance to politicians and leaders who are often spinning their own story. Being socially aware for him is all about questioning the truth and whatâs out there. In The Company he plays a character who firmly questions the truth and is prepared to be flexible in that goal, whereas his co-star Julie Christie plays a radical who actually hides from the truth hoping it will change. Their feisty dynamic provides the dramatic grist a story about investigative journalism set during the 1970s.\n\nSo what does freedom mean to Robert Redford? When scoping it out he comes up with the counterintuitive position that freedom often fails to offer a better alternative. âif you take the position that you have to get away from anything youâre given, you might be losing something really valuableâ. Thereâs a great deal of dramatic potential to be mined from seeking the truth. And this premise has driven many of his films as a director.\n\nIn Lions for Lambs (2007) Redford explores the aftermath of Afghanistan through three stories involving those affected. One is an angry young student played by Andrew Garfield. âAre young people more self-centred and less engaged politically than the older generation were in their day? Redford ponders: âMany of them are angry. But if you assume â as Andy Garfieldâs character did that being sceptical or convinced that everything is corrupt is a very one note position, but it doesnât actually make it the truth. The truth is actually more complicated than that: Being radical is actually being very narrow-minded. Life is not just one dimensionâ. And the tension between Garfieldâs narrow-minded character and the professor mines that dramatic tension through the movie.â\n\nAlthough Redford describes himself as being more political during the Vietnam war years, he then became more self-absorbed when he got back to his acting career. But the art form of directing makes a worthy subject of politics and he started to re-engage when he started making films. âArt in a broad sense is a useful way to criticise society and maintain a balance between the power base. Art provides another point of view to correct extremes and pioneer a way forward for the truthâ.\n\nWhen Redford saw a documentary made by D A Pennebaker, known for his cinema verite approach to filmmaking, this inspired him in directing his own films. âThey went inside their subject matter with the camera, rather than simply observing it from the outside, bringing some real dramatic tension to the formâ. And so this was the approach Redford adopted when he started filming. When asked if he finds it easier to direct or act, Redford claims it all comes down to control. Also working as an artist sketching people he met on his travels in Europe helped tremendously to shape his filmmaking projects. âAt that time there was a great deal of anger towards America and so I ceased to engage with people and used my sketchbook as a companion and to storyboard ideas and âget in the picture. being on the outside looking in and also on the insideâ.\n\nRobert Redford has now started to move back into sketching and drawing and away from filmmaking, but makes an acute observation on his change of direction:. âThe trouble with retiring is that you should never announce it, otherwise people start saying â Oh could you just do this, or could you just do that â you should just retireâ. However he is still working on a project which was has been in development for a few years. âItâs called 109 East Palace â and itâs about an address in New Mexico where the atomic bomb was developed, and Oppenheimer was behind it. So I thought it was just such a great story, about the inventor of the atomic bomb. But because he was a Communist and this was the McCarthy era during the 1950s, everything was very extreme and right wing. Although Oppenheimer was a hero, they (the authorities) went after him. What interests me is how quickly things can change because of the political climateâ. Heâs still deciding how he wants to approach the endeavour. âI believe in risk, and I believe that not taking a risk is a risk. Itâs the only thing that pushes you forward. Because you donât know where that going to lead you. Otherwise you will become stagnant. But itâs important to study the reasons why you want to pursue the risky strategyâ. He also enjoys a challenge playing a character who is not popular and whose point of view is isolated from the mainstream âbecause it involves really committing to the role, and seeing it forward successfully. If you are going to play a part, you really have to inhabit that character, and itâs a risk because you can get lost.â\n\nRobert Redford has never considered himself a Hollywood actor. âI grew up in Los Angeles, I didnât grow up in Hollywood and Iâve never had that much regard for Hollywood. I wanted to be a serious actor and that started in New York in the theatre and I wanted to see where that led, and it led me back to Los Angeles as a filmmakerâ.\n\nWhen he decided to set up Sundance his goal was very simple: âCelebrating people who donât get celebrated. Celebrating people who are either being ignored or undiscovered. Who deserve to be discovered. When I started Sundance back in the 1980s there were hundreds of independent films but they had no traction, there was no real category. It was still just mainstream films. Because I was in the mainstream I was very tuned into the idea of being independent. I was in the studio system but there was a whole world out there and I wanted to give it a chance. I wanted to support independent film with this non-profit institute called Sundance to support the stories and talent out there. â\n\nRobert Redford CONVERSATIONS WITH | MARRAKECH FILM FESTIVAL 2019\n\nThe London Korean Film Festival (LKFF 18th-24th November 2019) this highlights the historic milestone of 100-years of Korean cinema along with an exciting mix of UK and International premieres, guests and events across a diverse set of strands.\n\nKorean cinema continues to prove its worth on the international stage. This year alone has seen Bong Joon-ho win the Palme DâOr with Parasite at the Cannes Film Festival and Lee Chang-dongâs Burning (2018) released to critical acclaim in UK cinemas, while Train to Busan (Yeon Sang-ho, 2016), The Handmaiden (Park Chan-wook, 2016) and Little Forest (Lim Soon-rye, 2018) have all found recent success. Now, with 2019 marking the centenary of Korean cinema, the LKFF will shine a light into the past to offer insight into the full and fascinating history of a groundbreaking national cinema that has lead up to the acclaimed hits of today.\n\nThis celebration of Koreaâs cinematic history opens with classic melodrama The Seashore Village (1965) a story of a young woman, Hae-soon, living in a village heavily populated by those who have lost their husbands at sea. A vivid portrait of the hardships faced by the women of the village and their methods of coping through sisterly comradeship and an understanding of the natural world around them, the film features striking monochrome cinematography. Courtesy of veteran director Kim Soo-yong, now in his 90s, who made his film debut in 1958 with A Henpecked Husband and went on to make over 100 films in a long and distinguished career, the revered filmmaker will be present on opening night to discuss The Seashore Village, his life in film and 100 years of Korean cinema.\n\nContinuing the festivalâs championing of new independent cinema, the LKFF will hold its Closing Gala on 14th November Scattered Night (2019, above). Told through the eyes of two young children who must wait as their parents go through a disruptive divorce. Minimalist and sober in style, the film offers an intimate and heart-breaking childâs eye view of a family is disarray.\n\nOther classics due to screen are Yun Yong-gyuâs touching melodrama A Hometown in Heart (1949) which follows an orphaned young monk as he traverses temple life while longing for the return of his mother. Moving into the 1950s. Lee Kang-cheonâs Piagol (1955) finds a group of communist fighters waging war among mountain villages under the harsh leadership of a zealous commander. With its nuanced depiction of communists the controversial film was originally banned for a perceived pro-communist message. From legendary director Shin Sang-ok (who would later be kidnapped and forced to make films for the North Korean leader Kim Jong-il) comes The Flower in Hell (1958), set against the back-drop of occupied post-war Korea. Disaster befalls the lives of prostitute Sonya as she schemes to find a new life for herself by seducing the younger brother of her hustler boyfriend Young-sik who makes money by stealing from the US military.\n\nThe Korean Film Archive has made a huge database of classic films available on its YouTube channel with English subtitles. They have put together a list of some of the most influential and important films from each decade and we have pleasure in sharing these with a credit to the organisation\n\nThe 1930s\n\nSweet Dream (Lullaby of Death) (ë¯¸ëª½ â ì£½ìì ìì¥ê° | 1936 | Yang Ju-Nam)\n\nOne of the few lost films from the Japanese colonial era (1910-45) that has been rediscovered in recent years tells the story of Ae-sun, the vain wife of a middle-class man who has no interest in looking after her family and is chased out by her husband, only to find out her lover is not the prosperous entrepreneur she thought he was but a poor student and criminal.\n\nThe 1940s\n\nTuition (ììë£ | 1940 | Choi In-Gyu)\n\nA film based on the memoir of a fourth-grade student who received the grand prize in a writing contest sponsored by the Gyeongseong Daily. A boy, whose parents sell brass spoons on the street while his grandmother is sick in bed, struggles to find money for his tuition.\n\nSpring of the Korean Peninsula (ë°ëì ë´ | 1941 | Lee Byung-Il)\n\nA young filmmaker and his crew struggle to bring the famous Korean story of Chunghyang to the big screen. The film allows a fascinating insight into the complexities of filmmaking in Korea in the 1940s, and via posters on the studio walls indicates the wide variety of film influences, from German expressionism to Hollywood dramas, that Korean directors in this period had.\n\nA Hometown of the Heart (ë§ìì ê³ í¥ | 1949 | Yoon Yong-Kyu)\n\nA touching yet subtly presented story of a boy in a Buddhist temple hoping to find his mother. One of the few surviving works from the politically turbulent period of the late 1940s, just before the outbreak of the Korean War (1950-53).\n\nA Hometown of the Heart (1949) â Image Â© LKFF Website\n\nThe 1950s\n\nPiagol (í¼ìê³¨ | 1955 | Lee Kang-Cheon)\n\nThis decade saw the first major attempt in cinema to confront the recent war and its ideological divisions. Piagol focuses on partisan Communist fighters based in the South who, hiding in the mountains, continued to fight on behalf of the North.\n\nMadame Freedom (ìì ë¶ì¸ | 1956 | Han Hyeong-Mo)\n\nFilms of the 1950s confronted some of the key issues facing Korean society as it rebuilt itself anew. Like Madame Freedom, an adaptation of the decadeâs most scandalous serial novel, many centred on women who symbolised the tension between collapsing traditional values and the influence of Western capitalism. The box-office success of this film encouraged a renewed flow of investment into a film industry hit hard by the war.\n\nThe Flower in Hell (ì§ì¥í | 1958 | Shin Sang-Ok)\n\nInspired by both Italian Neorealism and Hollywood genre films, The Flower In Hell paints a hard-edged portrait of a broken city where the only way to get ahead was to break the law.\n\nThe Flower in Hell (1958) â Image Â© LKFF Website\n\nThe 1960s\n\nAimless Bullet (ì¤ë°í | 1961 | Yoo Hyeon-Mok)\n\nFilmmakers took advantage of weakened censorship in the 1960s to introduce more pointed social criticism into their films. This certainly applies to Aimless Bullet, a searing depiction of the economic wasteland of post-war Seoul whose brooding pessimism and superlative filmmaking helped establish it as an all-time classic.\n\nA Woman Judge (ì¬íì¬ | 1962 | Hong Eun-Won)\n\nâI will defend her to the end!â Heo Jin-suk, the titular protagonist of Hong Eun-wonâs first film â and only the second Korean feature by a woman director â is defending her mother-in-law who has confessed to murder, but she could be speaking for all womenâs rights.\n\nThe Seashore Village (ê°¯ë§ì | 1965 | Kim Su-Yong)\n\nIntroduced at the Opening Gala of last yearâs LKFF, The Seashore Village follows the story of a beautiful fishing village home to a community of widows who have lost their loved ones at sea. This was one of the earliest successful munye (literary adaptation) films, a genre which would come to define much of South Korean cinema during the 1960s.\n\nThe Seashore Village (1965) â Image Â© LKFF Website\n\nThe 1970s\n\nWoman of Fire (íë | 1971 | Kim Ki-Young)\n\nWoman of Fire (recommended by film critic Anton Bitel) sees Kim Ki-Young remake his stunning classic The Housemaid (1960) with an energy and passion that would come to define Korean cinema of the 1970s. Focusing on the role women play within the home, the film follows a composer and his wife, whose lives are thrown into turmoil by the introduction of a new housemaid.\n\nHometown of Stars (ë³ë¤ì ê³ í¥ | 1974 | Lee Jang-Ho)\n\nLee Jang-hoâs sensational debut introduced his sardonic experimental style and focus on socially relevant cinema, through the story of a woman who turns to alcoholism after suffering a torrent of emotional and physical abuse from men.\n\nThe March of Fools (ë°ë³´ë¤ì íì§ | 1975 | Ha Gil-Jong)\n\nHa Gil-jongâs penultimate film starts off as a bawdy comedy, as two drunk students try to get laid with varying degrees of success. Slowly the tone becomes melancholy as they consider their destinies in a repressive society where they feel out of place.\n\nTicket (1986) â Image Â© LKFF Website\n\nThe 1980s\n\nPeople of the Slum (ê¼¬ë°©ëë¤ ì¬ëë¤ | 1982 | Bae Chang-Ho)\n\nA shantytown south of Seoul has collected poor people and misfits from all over the country into its twisting alleyways. Myeong-suk is known as âblack gloveâ: she wears that glove on a hand severely burnt while saving her baby boy from a horrible injury. For his debut film Bae planted a love triangle inside a Korean neo-realist setting where poverty pokes sharp elbows into the basic decency of ordinary people. The filmâs success launched him into a career as the most popular director of the 1980s.\n\nTicket (í°ì¼ | 1986 | Im Kwon-Taek)\n\nMin Ji-sok (Kim Ji-mee) is the no-nonsense owner of a cafe in the tough port town of Sokcho. Her âgirlsâ serve more than tea or coffee, if a male customer purchases the right ticket. Against the background of the womenâs sorrows and moments of happiness, we learn the story of how Ji-sok herself ended up in dead-end Sokcho.\n\nThe Age of Success (ì±ê³µìë | 1988 | Jang Seon-Woo)\n\nA year after the release of Oliver Stoneâs Wall Street (1987) with its sardonic credo of âgreed is goodâ, director Jang Seon-Woo unveiled what looks three decades on like the Korean response â a vivid, madcap comedy of corporate intrigue and naked self-advancement.\n\nNorth Korean Partisan in South Korea (1990) â Image Â© LKFF Website\n\nThe 1990s\n\nNorth Korean Partisan in South Korea (ë¨ë¶êµ° | 1990 | Chung Ji-Young)\n\nDirector Chung Ji-Young captures a previously rarely seen aspect of the Korean War, focusing on the North Korean side of the conflict. Based on the experiences of real-life war correspondent Lee Tae, the film illuminates the struggles of the men and women, soldiers and civilians fighting for survival in the conflict â portrayed as inherently human, whichever side theyâre on.\n\nSeopyonje (ìí¸ì  | 1993 | Im Kwon-Taek)\n\nThis musical drama tells the story of a family of p"
