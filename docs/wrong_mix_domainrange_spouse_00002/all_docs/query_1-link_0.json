        "text": "Basketball Legend Shaquille O'Neal may be a tiny bit nervous as he considered reading his ex-wife's memoir. On Wednesday, Shaq's former spouse, Shaunie Henderson, revealed that her upcoming book, titled \"UNDEFEATED: Changing the Rules and Winning on My Own Terms,\" will be published this May. Shortly after Henderson made this announcement, O'Neal posted the book's cover on his Instagram account and jokingly said, \"Uh oh naaa I'm just playing,\" along with a congratulatory message in the caption.\n\nSimilar Topic:Cheslie Kryst's Mother Reveals Her Late Daughter's Book Titled 'By The Time You Read This: The Space Between Cheslie's Smile and Mental Illness'\n\nHenderson and O'Neal tied the knot in 2002 and have four children together (Shareef, Shaqir, Amirah, and Me'arah). O'Neal has a stepson named Myles from Henderson's previous relationship, as well as a daughter named Taahirah, born of his past romance with Arnetta Yardbourgh.\n\nThroughout their relationship, which took off in the late 1990s, but ended in 2009 when Henderson filed for separation, the couple grappled with issues of infidelity. O'Neal openly confessed to these struggles in his 2011 memoir, \"Shaq Uncut: My Story.\"\n\nHenderson spoke exclusively to PEOPLE that throughout her life, she has always harbored a fear of revealing too much information about her personal relationships while being in the public eye. She had a strong desire not to undermine someone else's story, even if it was intertwined with her own. However, as she matures and gains more experience in the entertainment industry, she has come to realize that people often have misconceptions about her true self.\n\nSource: Yahoo"
