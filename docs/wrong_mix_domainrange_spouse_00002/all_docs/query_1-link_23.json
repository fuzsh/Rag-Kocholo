        "text": "Effects of surgically and gastrically implanted radio transmitters on growth and feeding behavior of juvenile chinook salmon\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nAdams, N.S.; Rondorf, D.W.; Evans, S.D.; Kelly, J.E.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nWe examined the effects of surgically and gastrically implanted radio transmitters (representing 2.3-5.5% of body weight) on the growth and feeding behavior of 192 juvenile chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (114-159 mm in fork length). Throughout the 54-d study, the 48 fish with transmitters in their stomachs (gastric fish) consistently grew more slowly than fish with surgically implanted transmitters (surgery fish), fish with surgery but no implanted transmitter (sham-surgery fish), or fish exposed only to handling (control fish). Growth rates of surgery fish were also slightly impaired at day 21, but by day 54 they were growing at rates comparable with those of control fish. Despite differences in growth, overall health was similar among all test fish. However, movement of the transmitter antenna caused abrasions at the corner of the mouth in all gastric fish, whereas only 22% of the surgery fish had inflammation around the antenna exit wound. Feeding activity was similar among groups, but gastric fish exhibited a coughing behavior and appeared to have difficulty retaining swallowed food. Because growth and feeding behavior were less affected by the presence of surgically implanted transmitters than by gastric implants, we recommend surgically implanting transmitters for biotelemetry studies of juvenile chinook salmon between 114 and 159 mm fork length.\n\nImplanting radio transmitters in wintering canvasbacks\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nOlsen, Glenn H.; Dein, F. Joshua; Haramis, G. Michael; Jorde, Dennis G.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nTo conduct telemetry studies of wintering canvasbacks (Aythya valisineria) on Chesapeake Bay [Maryland, USA], we needed to devise a suitable method of radio transmitter attachment. We describe as aseptic, intraabdominal surgical technique, using the inhalation anesthetic isoflurane, to implant 20-g radio transmitters in free-ranging canvasbacks. We evaluated the technique over 3 winters (1987-89), when an annual average of 83 female canvasbacks received implant surgery during a 9-day period in mid-December. Of 253 ducks, 248 (98%) were implanted successfully, and 200 (80.65) completed the 70-day study until early March. No mortality or abnormal behavior from surgery was identified post-release.\n\nAssessment of gaseous CO2 and AQUI-S as anesthetics when surgically implanting radio transmitters into cutthroat trout\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSanderson, T.B.; Hubert, W.A.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nTricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222) and CO2 are anesthetics that can be legally used in fisheries work in the United States, but they are limited in their field applications. A mandatory 21-d withdrawal period is required for fish exposed to MS-222. Carbon dioxide is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but it is a \"low regulatory priority drug\" that can be used legally for fish anesthesia. However, stressful induction and lengthy recovery times have been associated with CO2. AQUI-S is a clove oil derivative that has the potential to become an approved anesthetic without the limitations of MS-222 or CO2. We compared the efficacy of CO2 with that of AQUI-S when surgically implanting radio transmitters into cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii. A 20% survival rate was observed when CO2 was used in combination with silk sutures, but a 100% survival rate was observed when CO2 was used in combination with surgical staples to shorten the duration of the surgical procedure. A 100% survival rate was observed when AQUI-S was used in combination with either silk sutures or surgical staples. Carbon dioxide in combination with surgical staples seemed to provide a reasonable option when surgically implanting radio transmitters into cutthroat trout, but AQUI-S may be the preferred anesthesia because high pH and dissolved oxygen levels and low free-CO2 concentrations are maintained during surgical procedures.\n\nTechnique for implanting radio transmitters subcutaneously in day-old ducklings\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nKorschgen, C.E.; Kenow, K.P.; Green, W.L.; Samuel, M.D.; Sileo, L.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nWe developed and evaluated a surgical procedure for implanting radio transmitters in 1-d-old Canvasback (Aythya valisineria) ducklings. Transmitters (1.5 g) were implanted subcutaneously on the back of ducklings while under a general anesthetic, isoflurane, within a few hours of hatching. Evaluations indicate that the procedure is a reliable method for radio-marking ducklings.\n\nSnake mortality associated with late season radio-transmitter implantation\n\nTreesearch\n\nD. Craig Rudolph; Shirley J. Burgdorf; Richard R. Schaefer; Richard N. Conner; Robert T. Zappalorth\n\n1998-01-01\n\nRadio-telemetry is an increasingly used procedure to obtain data on the biology of free-living snakes (Reinert 1992, 1994). In Texas and Louisiana we have been using the surgical technique of Weatherhead and Anderka (1984) to implant transmitters in timber rattlesnakes (Crotalus horridus) and Louisiana pine snakes (Pituophis melanoleucus...\n\nEffects of implanted radio transmitters with percutaneous antennas on the behavior of Canada Geese\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nHupp, Jerry W.; Ruhl, G.A.; Pearce, John M.; Mulcahy, Daniel M.; Tomeo, M.A.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nWe examined whether surgically-implanted radio transmitters with percutaneous antennas affected behavior of Lesser Canada Geese (Branta canadensis parvipes) in Anchorage, Alaska. We implanted either a 26-g VHF radio transmitter or a larger VHF radio that was the same mass (35 g) and shape as a satellite transmitter in the coelom of adult females captured during molt in 2000. A control group of females was marked with leg bands. We simultaneously observed behavior of radio-marked and control females from 4-62 d following capture. We observed no differences in the proportion of time birds in different treatments allocated among grazing, resting, comfort, walking, and alert behavior. Females in different treatments spent a similar proportion of time in the water. Implantation of radio transmitters did not affect the frequency of agonistic interactions. We conclude that coelomic radio transmitters with percutaneous antennas had minimal effects on the behavior of Canada Geese.\n\nNonlethal gill biopsy does not affect juvenile chinook salmon implanted with radio transmitters\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nMartinelli-Liedtke, T. L.; Shively, R.S.; Holmberg, G.S.; Sheer, M.B.; Schrock, R.M.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nUsing gastric and surgical transmitter implantation, we compared radio-tagged juvenile chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (T(O)) with tagged fish also having a gill biopsy (T(B)) to determine biopsy effects on fish implanted with radio transmitters. We found no evidence during the 21-d period to suggest that a gill biopsy reduced survival, growth, or gross condition of the tagged-biopsy group, regardless of transmitter implantation technique. We recorded 100% survival of all treatment groups. Relative growth rates of T(O) and T(B) fish did not differ significantly. Leukocrit and lysozyme levels were not significantly different among groups, suggesting that no signs of infection were present. Our findings suggest that small chinook salmon can tolerate the combination of transmitter implantation and gill biopsy without compromising condition relative to fish receiving only the transmitter. We believe a gill biopsy can be used in field telemetry studies, especially when physiological data are needed in addition to behavioral data.\n\nSurgical and immediate postrelease mortality of harlequin ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) implanted with abdominal radio transmitters with percutaneous antennae\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nMulcahy, Daniel M.; Esler, Daniel N.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nRadiotelemetry is an essential tool in the study of free-ranging bird populations, and a variety of transmitter-attachment methods have been developed. A promising new method is abdominal implantation of a transmitter with a percutaneous antenna. Researchers using this technique should be concerned about and aware of mortality during surgery and during the immediate postrelease period (the 14-day period following surgery). Of 307 radio-implant surgeries performed between 1995 and 1997 in harlequin ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus), 7 (2.3%) deaths were documented during surgery or anesthetic recovery. Of 295 birds released with implanted radios, 10 (3.4%) died during the immediate postrelease period. Modifications to anesthetic procedures used in the 204 surgeries performed in 1996 and 1997 reduced mortality to 1.5% during surgery and 1.5% during the immediate postrelease period. Anesthetic modifications included intubation of all birds, placement of birds on an elevated platform that allowed the head to rest at a level lower than the body during surgery, placement of a heated water blanket under the birds during surgery, monitoring of body temperature, and use of electrocardiogram and Doppler ultrasound to monitor heart rates and arrhythmias. Low levels of mortality associated with abdominal implantation of radio transmitters may be unavoidable, but mortality can be minimized with adjustments to anesthetic technique.\n\nReliability of computer designed surgical guides in six implant rehabilitations with two years follow-up.\n\nPubMed\n\nGiordano, Mauro; Ausiello, Pietro; Martorelli, Massimo; Sorrentino, Roberto\n\n2012-09-01\n\nTo evaluate the reliability and accuracy of computer-designed surgical guides in osseointegrated oral implant rehabilitation. Six implant rehabilitations, with a total of 17 implants, were completed with computer-designed surgical guides, performed with the master model developed by muco-compressive and muco-static impressions. In the first case, the surgical guide had exclusively mucosal support, in the second case exclusively dental support. For all six cases computer-aided surgical planning was performed by virtual analyses with 3D models obtained by dental scan DICOM data. The accuracy and stability of implant osseointegration over two years post surgery was then evaluated with clinical and radiographic examinations. Radiographic examination, performed with digital acquisitions (RVG - Radio Video graph) and parallel techniques, allowed two-dimensional feedback with a margin of linear error of 10%. Implant osseointegration was recorded for all the examined rehabilitations. During the clinical and radiographic post-surgical assessments, over the following two years, the peri-implant bone level was found to be stable and without appearance of any complications. The margin of error recorded between pre-operative positions assigned by virtual analysis and the post-surgical digital radiographic observations was as low as 0.2mm. Computer-guided implant surgery can be very effective in oral rehabilitations, providing an opportunity for the surgeon: (a) to avoid the necessity of muco-periosteal detachments and then (b) to perform minimally invasive interventions, whenever appropriate, with a flapless approach.

The transmitter weighed 1.3 g in air (0.9 g in water) and comprised, on average, 6% of the body weight of the fish (in air). Individuals were randomly assigned to an experimental group (control, surgical or gastric) and a sampling period (day 5 or day 21). Relative growth rate was expressed as% body weight gained/day. General condition was assessed by necropsy. Physiological response variables included hematocrit, leucocrit and plasma protein concentration. The mean relative growth rates of control, surgical and gastric fish were not significantly different at day 5. By day 21, the gastric group had a significantly lower relative growth rate (1.3%) as compared to the surgical group (1.8%) and the control group (1.9%) (P = 0.0001). Mean hematocrit values were significantly lower in the surgical (41.8%) and gastric (42.2%) groups as compared to controls (47.3%) at day 5 (P = 0.01), but all were within normal range for salmonids. No significant differences in hematocrit values were detected at day 21. Leucocrit values for all groups were ??? 1% in 99% of the fish. Both tagged groups had significantly lower mean plasma protein levels as compared to controls at day 5 (P = 0.001) and day 21 (P = 0.0001). At day 21 the gastric group (64.4 g 100 m1-1) had significantly lower mean plasma protein levels than the surgical group (68.8 g 100 ml-1) (P = 0.0001). Necropsies showed decreasing condition of gastrically tagged fish over time, and increasing condition of surgical fish. Paired releases of surgically and gastrically implanted yearling chinook salmon in the lower Columbia River in spring, 1996 revealed few significant differences in migration behavior through two reservoirs. We conclude that gastrically implanted fish show decreased growth and\n\nSurgical Tooth Implants, Combat and Field.\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1984-07-15\n\nand identify by block number) --- This Annual Report summarizes progress to date on a long-term implant study of a serrated ceramic dental implant...upper two parts of the implant, post and core and crown, are conventional metaT materials.

Birds were captured during wing molt (late August to mid-September) in 1995-1997. Of 44 Harlequin Ducks implanted with radios and recaptured, 7 (16%) had lost their transmitters and 5 (11%) had radios in the process of extruding. Most (11 of 12) extrusions and losses occurred in birds implanted with radios in 1996 and recaptured in 1997. We suggest that transmitter extrusions and losses were due largely to changes in transmitter design made between 1095 and 1996. Transmitters implanted in 1996 were cylindrical rather than spherical, had a flat end with an abrupt edge, and the lower portion of the antenna was reinforced. Radio losses occurred after the 7-mo monitoring period and caused no apparent harm to the birds. Investigators using implanted radios with percutaneous antennas for long-term projects should be aware of the potential for radio extrusion and should minimize the problem by using transmitters that have no sharp edges and that are wide, rather than narrow.\n\nImplant decontamination with phosphoric acid during surgical peri-implantitis treatment: a RCT.\n\nPubMed\n\nHentenaar, Diederik F M; De Waal, Yvonne C M; Strooker, Hans; Meijer, Henny J A; Van Winkelhoff, Arie-Jan; Raghoebar, Gerry M\n\n2017-12-01\n\nPeri-implantitis is known as an infectious disease that affects the peri-implant soft and hard tissue. Today, scientific literature provides very little evidence for an effective intervention protocol for treatment of peri-implantitis. The aim of the present randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the microbiological and clinical effectiveness of phosphoric acid as a decontaminating agent of the implant surface during surgical peri-implantitis treatment. Peri-implantitis lesions were treated with resective surgical treatment aimed at peri-implant granulation tissue removal, bone recontouring, and pocket elimination. Fifty-three implant surfaces in 28 patients were mechanically cleaned and treated with either 35% phosphoric etching gel (test group) or sterile saline (control group). Microbiological samples were obtained during surgery; clinical parameters were recorded at baseline and at 3Â months after treatment. Data were analyzed using multi-variable linear regression analysis and multilevel statistics. Significant immediate reductions in total anaerobic bacterial counts on the implant surface were found in both groups. Immediate reduction was greater when phosphoric acid was used. The difference in log-transformed mean anaerobic counts between both procedures was not statistical significant (pâ=â0.108), but there were significantly less culture-positive implants after the decontamination procedure in the phosphoric acid group (pâ=â0.042). At 3Â months post-surgery, 75% of the implants in the control group and 63.3% of the implants in the test group showed disease resolution. However, no significant differences in clinical and microbiological outcomes between both groups were found. The application of 35% phosphoric acid after mechanical debridement is superior to mechanical debridement combined with sterile saline rinsing for decontamination of the implant surface during surgical peri-implantitis treatment. However, phosphoric acid as implant surface\n\nCorrosion and fatigue of surgical implants\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLisagor, W. B.\n\n1975-01-01\n\nImplants for the treatment of femoral fractures, mechanisms leading to the failure or degradation of such structures, and current perspectives on surgical implants are discussed. Under the first heading, general usage, materials and procedures, environmental conditions, and laboratory analyses of implants after service are considered. Corrosion, crevice corrosion, stress corrosion cracking, intergranular corrosion, pitting corrosion, fatigue, and corrosion fatigue are the principal degradation mechanisms described. The need for improvement in the reliability of implants is emphasized.\n\nExpansion of a Predoctoral Surgical Implant Selective for Dental Students.\n\nPubMed\n\nSeitz, Stefanie D; Zimmermann, Richard L; Hendricson, William D\n\n2016-03-01\n\nHistorically, predoctoral dental education programs have focused on the restoration of implants in the clinical environment; however, given the increase in dental implant therapy being performed by general dentists, the need to incorporate surgical implant training is becoming evident. This article describes a predoctoral surgical implant selective at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio and its evolution across five years to include emerging techniques and technology to enhance students' understanding of dental implant therapy, both surgical and restorative. From virtual implant planning and guided surgery to intra-oral scanning of implants for custom abutments and restorations, students obtained first-hand experiences with a wide spectrum of aspects of implant therapy. The results of anonymous surveys completed by 2014-15 students before and after the year-long selective regarding their impression of the program are also discussed.\n\nReliability of implant surgical guides based on soft-tissue models.\n\nPubMed\n\nManey, Pooja; Simmons, David E; Palaiologou, Archontia; Kee, Edwin\n\n2012-12-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of implant surgical guides fabricated on diagnostic casts. Guides were fabricated with radiopaque rods representing implant positions. Cone beam computerized tomograms were taken with guides in place. Accuracy was evaluated using software to simulate implant placement. Twenty-two sites (47%) were considered accurate (13 of 24 maxillary and 9 of 23 mandibular sites). Soft-tissue models do not always provide sufficient accuracy for fabricating implant surgical guides.\n\nDevelopment of the implant surgical technique and assessment rating system\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPark, Jung-Chul; Hwang, Ji-Wan; Lee, Jung-Seok; Jung, Ui-Won; Choi, Seong-Ho; Cho, Kyoo-Sung; Chai, Jung-Kiu\n\n2012-01-01\n\nPurpose There has been no attempt to establish an objective implant surgical evaluation protocol to assess residents' surgical competence and improve their surgical outcomes. The present study presents a newly developed assessment and rating system and simulation model that can assist the teaching staffs to evaluate the surgical events and surgical skills of residents objectively. Methods Articles published in peer-reviewed English journals were selected using several scientific databases and subsequently reviewed regarding surgical competence and assessment tools. Particularly, medical journals reporting rating and evaluation protocols for various types of medical surgeries were thoroughly analyzed. Based on these studies, an implant surgical technique assessment and rating system (iSTAR) has been developed. Also, a specialized dental typodont was developed for the valid and reliable assessment of surgery. Results The iSTAR consists of two parts including surgical information and task-specific checklists. Specialized simulation model was subsequently produced and can be used in combination with iSTAR. Conclusions The assessment and rating system provided may serve as a reference guide for teaching staffs to evaluate the residents' implant surgical techniques. PMID:22413071\n\nReliability of implant placement with stereolithographic surgical guides generated from computed tomography: clinical data from 94 implants.\n\nPubMed\n\nErsoy, Ahmet Ersan; Turkyilmaz, Ilser; Ozan, Oguz; McGlumphy, Edwin A\n\n2008-08-01\n\nDental implant placement requires precise planning with regard to anatomic limitations and restorative goals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the match between the positions and axes of the planned and placed implants using stereolithographic (SLA) surgical guides. Ninety-four implants were placed using SLA surgical guides generated from computed tomography (CT) between 2005 and 2006. Radiographic templates were used for all subjects during CT imaging. After obtaining three-dimensional CT images, each implant was virtually placed on the CT images. SLA surgical guides, fabricated using an SLA machine with a laser beam to polymerize the liquid photo-polymerized resin, were used during implant placement. A new CT scan was taken for each subject following implant placement. Special software was used to fuse the images of the planned and placed implants, and the locations and axes were compared. Compared to the planned implants, the placed implants showed angular deviation of 4.9 degrees+/-2.36 degrees, whereas the mean linear deviation was 1.22+/-0.85 mm at the implant neck and 1.51+/-1 mm at the implant apex. Compared to the implant planning, the angular deviation and linear deviation at the neck and apex of the placed maxillary implants were 5.31 degrees+/-0.36 degrees, 1.04+/-0.56 mm, and 1.57+/-0.97 mm, respectively, whereas corresponding figures for placed mandibular implants were 4.44 degrees+/-0.31 degrees, 1.42+/-1.05 mm, and 1.44+/-1.03 mm, respectively. SLA surgical guides using CT data may be reliable in implant placement and make flapless implant placement possible.\n\nSuccessful implantation of an abdominal aortic blood pressure transducer and radio-telemetry transmitter in guinea pigs - Anaesthesia, analgesic management and surgical methods, and their influence on hemodynamic parameters and body temperature.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchmitz, Sabrina; Henke, Julia; Tacke, Sabine; Guth, Brian\n\n2016-01-01\n\nGuinea pigs (GPs) are a valuable cardiovascular pharmacology model. Implantation of a radio-telemetry system into GPs is, however, challenging and has been associated with a high failure rate in the past. We provide information on a novel procedure for implanting telemetry devices into GPs and we have measured the hemodynamics (arterial blood pressure, BP and heart rate, HR) and core body temperature (BT) in the 24h after surgery. Male Hartley GPs (Crl:HA, 350-400g, 6.5weeks, n=16) were implanted with a radio transmitter abdominally and were then monitored continuously (HR, BP and BT) for 24h after surgery. 13 of 16 GPs (81%) survived the surgery. Surgery duration was 94min (min) (range: 76-112min) and anaesthesia duration was 131min (range: 107-158min). GPs lost body weight until 2days after surgery and then regained weight. Mean arterial BP increased from 33.7mmHg directly after surgery to 59.1mmHg after 24h. HR increased from 206bpm directly after surgery to 286bpm at 8h and fell to 251bpm at 24h after implantation. BT was 36Â°C directly after surgery, fell to 35.4Â°C until regaining of the righting reflex and then stabilized at 38.5Â°C after 24h. A high survival rate in telemetered GPs is possible. We achieved this through a procedure with minimal stress through habituation and planning, continuous warming during anaesthesia, an optimal anaesthetic and analgesic management, efficient surgical techniques and vitamin C supplementation.

A Systematic Review\n\nPubMed Central\n\nShadid, Rola Muhammed; Sadaqah, Nasrin Rushdi; Othman, Sahar Abdo\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground. A number of surgical techniques for implant site preparation have been advocated to enhance the implant of primary and secondary stability. However, there is insufficient scientific evidence to support the association between the surgical technique and implant stability. Purpose. This review aimed to investigate the influence of different surgical techniques including the undersized drilling, the osteotome, the piezosurgery, the flapless procedure, and the bone stimulation by low-level laser therapy on the primary and/or secondary stability of dental implants. Materials and methods. A search of PubMed, Cochrane Library, and grey literature was performed. The inclusion criteria comprised observational clinical studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in patients who received dental implants for rehabilitation, studies that evaluated the association between the surgical technique and the implant primary and/or secondary stability. The articles selected were carefully read and classified as low, moderate, and high methodological quality and data of interest were tabulated. Results. Eight clinical studies were included then they were classified as moderate or high methodological quality and control of bias. Conclusions. There is a weak evidence suggesting that any of previously mentioned surgical techniques could influence the primary and/or secondary implant stability. PMID:25126094\n\nInfective endocarditis following Melody valve implantation: comparison with a surgical cohort.\n\nPubMed\n\nO'Donnell, Clare; Holloway, Rhonda; Tilton, Elizabeth; Stirling, John; Finucane, Kirsten; Wilson, Nigel\n\n2017-03-01\n\nInfective endocarditis has been reported post Melody percutaneous pulmonary valve implant; the incidence and risk factors, however, remain poorly defined. We identified four cases of endocarditis from our first 25 Melody implants. Our aim was to examine these cases in the context of postulated risk factors and directly compare endocarditis rates with local surgical valves. We conducted a retrospective review of patients post Melody percutaneous pulmonary valve implant in New Zealand (October, 2009-May, 2015) and also reviewed the incidence of endocarditis in New Zealand among patients who have undergone surgical pulmonary valve implants. In total, 25 patients underwent Melody implantation at a median age of 18 years. At a median follow-up of 2.9 years, most were well with low valve gradient (median 27 mmHg) and only mild regurgitation. Two patients presented with life-threatening endocarditis and obstructive vegetations at 14 and 26 months post implant, respectively. Two additional patients presented with subacute endocarditis at 5.5 years post implant. From 2009 to May, 2015, 178 surgical pulmonic bioprostheses, largely Hancock valves and homografts, were used at our institution. At a median follow-up of 2.9 years, four patients (2%) had developed endocarditis in this group compared with 4/25 (16%) in the Melody group (p=0.0089). Three surgical valves have been replaced. The Melody valve offers a good alternative to surgical conduit replacement in selected patients. Many patients have excellent outcomes in the medium term. Endocarditis, however, can occur and if associated with obstruction can be life threatening. The risk for endocarditis in the Melody group was higher in comparison with that in a contemporaneous surgical pulmonary implant cohort.\n\nReliability of implant placement after virtual planning of implant positions using cone beam CT data and surgical (guide) templates.\n\nPubMed\n\nNickenig, Hans-Joachim; Eitner, Stephan\n\n2007-01-01\n\nWe assessed the reliability of implant placement after virtual planning of implant positions using cone-beam CT data and surgical guide templates. A total of 102 patients (250 implants, 55.4% mandibular; mean patient age, 40.4 years) who had undergone implant treatment therapy in an armed forces dental clinic (Cologne, Germany) between July 1, 2005 and December 1, 2005. They were treated with a system that allows transfer of virtual planning to surgical guide templates. Only in eight cases the surgical guides were not used because a delayed implant placement was necessary. In four posterior mandibular cases, handling was limited because of reduced interocclusal distance, requiring 50% shortening of the drill guides. The predictability of implant size was high: only one implant was changed to a smaller diameter (because of insufficient bone). In all cases, critical anatomical structures were protected and no complications were detected in postoperative panoramic radiographs. In 58.1% (147) of the 250 implants, a flapless surgery plan was realized. Implant placement after virtual planning of implant positions using cone beam CT data and surgical templates can be reliable for preoperative assessment of implant size, position, and anatomical complications. It is also indicative of cases amenable to flapless surgery.\n\nSurgical Tooth Implants, Combat and Field.\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1977-11-01\n\nassisted by Mr. Larry G.

A stereolithographic surgical guide for epoxy resin mandibles with three edentulous molar sites was produced using a computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacture (CAD/CAM) system. Two surgeons with and two surgeons without implant surgery experience placed implants in a model either using or not using the CAD/CAM surgical guide. Four groups were created: inexperienced surgeon without the guide (group 1); experienced surgeon without the guide (group 2); inexperienced surgeon with the guide (group 3); and experienced surgeon with the guide (group 4). Planned implants and placed implants were superimposed using digital software, and deviation parameters were calculated. There were no significant differences in any of the deviation parameters between the groups when using the surgical guide. With respect to the implant sites, there were no significant differences among the groups in any parameter. Use of the CAD/CAM surgical guide reduced discrepancies among operators performing implant surgery regardless of their level of experience. Whether or not the guide was used, differences in the anterior-posterior implant site in the molar area did not affect the accuracy of implant placement.\n\nDoes wearing a surgical facemask or N95-respirator impair radio communication?\n\nPubMed\n\nThomas, Frank; Allen, Craig; Butts, William; Rhoades, Carol; Brandon, Cynthia; Handrahan, Diana L\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThis study evaluated the impact wearing a surgical facemask or N95 air purifying respirator (N95) has on radio reception. We compared the ability of a flight crewmember and a layperson sitting in a Bell 407 crew compartment and a dispatcher sitting in a communication center to accurately record 20 randomized aviation terms transmitted over the radio by a helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) pilot wearing a surgical facemask and six different N95s with and without the aircraft engine operating. With the aircraft engine off, all terms (100% accuracy) were correctly identified, regardless of the absence or presence of the surgical facemask or N95 studied. With the aircraft engine on, the surgical facemask (3M-1826) and two N95 respirators (3M-1860, Safe Life Corp-150) maintained 100% accuracy. Remaining N95 accuracy was as follows: 3M-8511 and Kimberly-Clark PFR95 (98%), Inoyel-3212 (97%), and 3M-1870 (93%). In general, despite wearing a facemask, radio reception accuracy is high (>90%). However, aircraft engine noise and N95 type do appear to adversely affect the accuracy of radio reception. All HEMS pilots and crewmembers should be aware of these radio reception findings when using an N95 respirator during transport. A brief review of the surgical facemask and N95 effectiveness to prevent viral respiratory infections is provided. Copyright Â© 2011 Air Medical Journal Associates. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In the iliac crest of eight goats, 48 cylindrical-screw-type implants with a diameter of 4.2Â mm (Dyna(Â®) ; Bergen op Zoom, the Netherlands) were installed, using three different surgical techniques: (i) 5% undersized, using a final drill diameter of 4Â mm; (ii) 15% undersized, using a final drill diameter of 3.6Â mm; and (iii) 25% undersized, using a final drill diameter of 3.2Â mm. Peak insertion torque values were measured by a Digital(Â®) (MARK-10 Corporation, New York, NY, USA) torque gauge instrument during placement. At 3Â weeks after implantation, removal torque was measured. Histomorphometrically, the peri-implant bone volume was measured in three zones; the inner zone (0-500Â Î¼m), the middle zone (500-1000Â Î¼m) and the outer zone (1000-1500Â Î¼m). Evaluation of the obtained data demonstrated no statistically significant difference between different surgical techniques regarding removal torque values. With respect to the percentage peri-implant bone volume (%BV), also no significant difference could be observed between all three applied surgical techniques for both the inner, middle and outer zone. However, irrespective of the surgical technique, it was noticed that the %BV was significantly higher for the inner zone as compared to middle and outer zone (PÂ <Â 0.05) around the implant. At 3Â weeks after implant installation, independent of the used undersized surgical technique, the %BV in the inner zone (0-500Â Î¼m) peri-implant area was improved due to both condensation of the surrounding bone as also the translocation of host bone particles along the implant surface. Surprisingly, no mechanical beneficial effect of the 25% undersized surgical technique could be observed as compared to the 5% or 15% undersized surgical technique to improve primary or secondary implant stability.

While in the past, the use of this device was reserved to glaucoma refractory to multiple filtration surgical procedures, up-to-date mounting experience has encouraged its use also as a primary surgery for selected cases. Implantation of Ahmed glaucoma valve can be challenging for the surgeon, especially in patients who already underwent previous multiple surgeries. Several tips have to be acquired by the surgeon, and a long learning curve is always needed. Although the valve mechanism embedded in the Ahmed glaucoma valve decreases the risk of postoperative hypotony-related complications, it does not avoid the need of a careful follow-up. Complications related to this type of surgery include early and late postoperative hypotony, excessive capsule fibrosis around the plate, erosion of the tube or plate edge, and very rarely infection.

To determine 10-year surgical outcomes and implant success of three narrow diameter implants in edentulous maxillae with conventional loading. Forty participants with mandibular two-implant overdentures were randomly allocated for surgery for maxillary overdentures. Using osteotomes, three implants of similar systems were placed with a one-stage procedure and 12-week loading with splinted and unsplinted prosthodontic designs. Marginal bone and stability measurements were done at surgery, 12 weeks, 1-, 2-, 5-, 7-, 10 years. One hundred seventeen implants were placed in 39 participants, with 35 being seen at 1 year; 29 at 2 years; 28 at 5 years; 26 at 7 years; and 23 (59%) at 10 years. Marginal bone loss was 1.35âmm between surgery and 12 weeks; 0.36âmm between 12 weeks and 1 year; 0.48 mm between 1 and 5 years; and 0.22 mm between 5 and 10 years. Implant stability quotients were 56.05, 57.54, 60.88, 58.80, 61.17 at surgery, 12 weeks, 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years. Four-field tables by implant showed success rates of 82% at 1 year; 69.2% at 2 years; 66.7% at 5 years; 61.5% at 7 years; 51.3% at 10 years. Data showed no differences between surgical technique, systems, or prosthodontic designs. Surgical placement with osteotomes of three narrow diameter implants for maxillary overdentures, opposing mandibular two-implant overdentures, is an acceptable approach, subject to strict patient selection. Implant success is independent of prosthodontic design.

This study is a retrospective review of the clinical histories of 23 patients who had undergone a second AGV implantation after a failed initial implantation. Age, sex, prior surgery, glaucoma type, number of medications, intraocular pressure (IOP), visual acuity, and surgical complications were analyzed. Surgical success was defined as IOP maintained below 21 mm Hg, with at least a 20% overall reduction in IOP, regardless of the use of IOP-lowering medications. Following the implantation of a second AGV, the mean IOP decreased from 39.3 to 18.5 mm Hg (52.9% reduction, P<0.001). The mean number of postoperative IOP-lowering medications administered decreased from 2.8 to 1.7 after the second AGV implantation (P<0.001). The cumulative probability of success for the procedure was 87% after 1 year and 52% after 3 years. Three patients (13.0%) experienced bullous keratopathy after the second AGV implantation. None of the patients showed any evidence of diplopia or ocular movement limitation as a result of the presence of 2 AGVs in the same eye. Prior trabeculectomy was found to be a significant risk factor for failure (P=0.027). A second AGV implantation can be a good choice of surgical treatment when the first AGV has failed to control IOP.\n\nSimple surgical approach with high-frequency radio-wave electrosurgery for conjunctivochalasis.\n\nPubMed\n\nYoum, Dong Ju; Kim, Joon Mo; Choi, Chul Young\n\n2010-11-01\n\nTo introduce a new simple surgical approach with high-frequency radio-wave electrosurgery to reduce conjunctivochalasis (CCh). Prospective, noncomparative, interventional case series analysis. Twelve patients (20 eyes) with CCh were recruited from the outpatient service of the Department of Ophthalmology, Kangbuk Samsung Hospital, Seoul, Korea. On the inferior bulbar conjunctiva, subconjunctival coagulation was performed with a fine-needle electrode using a high-frequency radio-wave electrosurgical unit (Ellman Surgitron; Ellman International, Inc., Hewlett, NY) in coagulation mode. Conjunctivochalasis grade; epiphora and dry eye symptoms (the Ocular Surface Disease Index [OSDI]; Allergan Inc., Irvine, CA, holds the copyright); and intraoperative and postoperative complications. Eighteen eyes (90%) recovered a smooth, wet, and noninflamed conjunctival surface within 1 month and remained stable for a follow-up period of 3 months. At 3 months postoperatively, 18 eyes (90%) had grade 0 CCh. There was a statistically significant decrease of the OSDI score at 3 months postoperatively (P < 0.001). A surgical approach with high-frequency radio-wave electrosurgery produced a significant reduction in CCh and an improvement in symptoms. Radio-wave surgical techniques represent a favorable alternative to surgical treatment of CCh. The author(s) have no proprietary or commercial interest in any materials discussed in this article.

Challenges include wireless transmission of sufficient power to the implanted device to ensure reliable operation for decades without replacement, minimizing tissue heating, and adequate reliable communications bandwidth. Overcoming these challenges is essential for the development of implantable closed loop system for the treatment of disorders ranging from epilepsy, incontinence, stroke and spinal cord injury. We discuss the development of the wireless power, communication and control for a Radio-Frequency Identification Sensor (RFIDS) system with targeted power range for a 700 mV, 30 to 40 uA load attained at -2 dBm.\n\nSurgical implantation of temperature-sensitive transmitters and data-loggers to record body temperature in koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus).\n\nPubMed\n\nAdam, D; Johnston, S D; Beard, L; Nicholson, V; Lisle, A; Gaughan, J; Larkin, R; Theilemann, P; Mckinnon, A; Ellis, W\n\n2016-01-01\n\nUnder predicted climate change scenarios, koala distribution in Australia is expected to be adversely affected. Recent studies have attempted to identify suitable habitat, based on models of bioclimatic regions, but to more accurately reflect the thermal tolerance and behavioural adaptations of the various regional populations, the koala's response to periods of heat stress will need to be investigated at the individual animal level. To explore the safety and suitability of temperature-sensitive intra-abdominal implants for monitoring core body temperature in the koala. A temperature-sensitive radio transmitter and thermal iButton data-logger, waxed together as a package, were surgically implanted into the abdominal cavity of four captive koalas. In one animal the implant was tethered and in the other three, it was left free-floating. After 3Â months, the implants were removed and all four koalas recovered without complications. The tethering of the package in the one koala resulted in minor inflammation and adhesion, so this practice was subsequently abandoned. The free-floating deployments were complication-free and revealed a diurnal body temperature rhythm, with daily ranges of 0.4-2.8Â°C. The minimum recorded body temperature was 34.2Â°C and the maximum was 37.7Â°C. The difference in the readings obtained from the transmitters and iButtons never exceeded 0.3Â°C. The suitability of the surgical approach was confirmed, from both the animal welfare and data collection points of view.

Thirty patients (79 implants) with peri-implantitis were treated with resective surgical treatment consisting of apically re-positioned flap, bone re-contouring and surface debridement and decontamination. Patients were randomly allocated to decontamination with 0.12% CHXÂ +Â 0.05% CPC (test-group) or a placebo-solution (without CHX/CPC, placebo-group). Microbiological parameters were recorded during surgery; clinical and radiographical parameters were recorded before (pre-) treatment (baseline), and at 3, 6 and 12Â months after treatment. Nine implants in two patients in the placebo-group were lost due to severe persisting peri-implantitis. Both decontamination procedures resulted in significant reductions of bacterial load on the implant surface, but the test-group showed a significantly greater reduction than the placebo-group (log 4.21Â Â±Â 1.89 versus log 2.77Â Â±Â 2.12, pÂ =Â 0.006). Multilevel analysis showed no differences between both groups in the effect of the intervention on bleeding, suppuration, probing pocket depth and radiographical bone loss over time. Implant surface decontamination with 0.12% CHXÂ +Â 0.05% CPC in resective surgical treatment of peri-implantitis leads to a greater immediate suppression of anaerobic bacteria on the implant surface than a placebo-solution, but does not lead to superior clinical results. The long-term microbiological effect remains unknown.

This work is focused on critical analysis of outcomes of these surgical procedures and recommendation prescription for their uses in application pelvic surgery. There was made analysis of published outcomes and experience with MI use in POP surgical treatment. OUTCOMES were analysed separately for each pelvic bottom section. Main criteria were surgical complications and treatment effectivity based on objective measurable parameters and subjective patients evaluation. There are formalized suitable indications and conditions for individual pelvic bottom sections for safe MI use in reconstructive POP surgery. On the basis of objective data authors also define specific situations when MI use doesn't bring any benefit and it is not recommended. Mesh implants have their definite place in POP surgical treatment. Implants with right indication and right surgical technique in comparison with classic surgical procedures have significantly lower recurrence risk with comparable or higher surgical complication rate.\n\nStereoscopic Analysis of Silicone Breast Implant Shells Damaged by Surgical Instruments.\n\nPubMed\n\nRapp, Derek A; Neaman, Keith C; Hammond, Dennis C\n\n2015-07-01\n\nIatrogenic shell injury during the implantation and explantation of silicone gel breast implants may lead to eventual device failure. Identification of the patterns of injury caused by surgical instruments is important when attempting to characterize the cause of shell rupture. Understanding the true causes of device failure may help with its prevention. The purpose of this study was to microscopically characterize patterns of shell injury induced by various surgical instruments. Textured and smooth silicone gel implants were intentionally damaged with a variety of surgical instruments. Various scalpels and surgical scissors ranging in fineness were used to create full-thickness injuries in the implant shell. Optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy were then used to image the injured area to determine patterns of injury. Full-thickness striations across the thickness of the shell could be seen with damage caused by scissors. The density of these striations correlated directly with the fineness of scissors used. No striations were seen with injuries caused by scalpels. Striations were only observed in injuries caused by scissors and suture needles. Striation density correlated with the coarseness of the cutting edge. No such striations were seen in shells damaged by a scalpel even when the angle of approach was changed. This difference can be of assistance in distinguishing between scissors versus scalpel injury of an implant shell.\n\nGlobal Convergence on the Bioethics of Surgical Implants\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMonlezun, Dominique J.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe increasing globalization of mankind with pluralistic belief systems necessitates physicians by virtue of their profession to partner with bioethics for soundly applying emerging knowledge and technologies for the best use of the patient.

Radio or acoustic technology can be used, depending on the study design and the environmental conditions in the study area. A broad definition of telemetry also includes the use of Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags, either separately or with a radio or acoustic transmitter. To use telemetry, fish must be equipped with a transmitter. Although there are several attachment procedures available, surgical implantation of transmitters in the abdominal cavity is recognized as the best technique for long-term telemetry studies in general (Stasko and Pincock, 1977; Winter, 1996; Jepsen, 2003), and specifically for juvenile salmonids, Oncorhynchus spp. (Adams and others, 1998a, 1998b; Martinelli and others, 1998; Hall and others, 2009). Studies that use telemetry assume that the processes by which the animals are captured, handled, and tagged, as well as the act of carrying the transmitter, will have minimal effect on their behavior and performance. This assumption, commonly stated as a lack of transmitter effects, must be valid if telemetry studies are to describe accurately the movements and behavior of an entire population of interest, rather than the subset of that population that carries transmitters. This document describes a standard operating procedure (SOP) for surgical implantation of radio or acoustic transmitters in juvenile salmonids. The procedures were developed from a broad base of published information, laboratory experiments, and practical experience in tagging thousands of fish for numerous studies of juvenile salmon movements near Columbia River and Snake River hydroelectric dams. Staff from the Western Fisheries Research Center's Columbia River Research Laboratory (CRRL) frequently have used telemetry studies to evaluate new structures or operations at hydroelectric dams in the Columbia River Basin, and these evaluations typically\n\n[Retrieval and failure analysis of surgical implants in Brazil: the need for proper regulation].\n\nPubMed\n\nAzevedo, Cesar R de Farias; Hippert, Eduardo\n\n2002-01-01\n\nThis paper summarizes several cases of metallurgical failure analysis of surgical implants conducted at the Laboratory of Failure Analysis, Instituto de Pesquisas TecnolÃ³gicas (IPT), in Brazil. Failures with two stainless steel femoral compression plates, one stainless steel femoral nail plate, one Ti-6Al-4V alloy maxillary reconstruction plate, and five Nitinol wires were investigated. The results showed that the implants were not in accordance with ISO standards and presented evidence of corrosion-assisted fracture. Furthermore, some of the implants presented manufacturing/processing defects which also contributed to their premature failure. Implantation of materials that are not biocompatible may cause several types of adverse effects in the human body and lead to premature implant failure. A review of prevailing health legislation is needed in Brazil, along with the adoption of regulatory mechanisms to assure the quality of surgical implants on the market, providing for compulsory procedures in the reporting and investigation of surgical implants which have failed in service.\n\nAccurate pre-surgical determination for self-drilling miniscrew implant placement using surgical guides and cone-beam computed tomography.\n\nPubMed\n\nMiyazawa, Ken; Kawaguchi, Misuzu; Tabuchi, Masako; Goto, Shigemi\n\n2010-12-01\n\nMiniscrew implants have proven to be effective in providing absolute orthodontic anchorage. However, as self-drilling miniscrew implants have become more popular, a problem has emerged, i.e. root contact, which can lead to perforation and other root injuries. To avoid possible root damage, a surgical guide was fabricated and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) was used to incorporate guide tubes drilled in accordance with the planned direction of the implants. Eighteen patients (5 males and 13 females; mean age 23.8 years; minimum 10.7, maximum 45.5) were included in the study. Forty-four self-drilling miniscrew implants (diameter 1.6, and length 8 mm) were placed in interradicular bone using a surgical guide procedure, the majority in the maxillary molar area. To determine the success rates, statistical analysis was undertaken using Fisher's exact probability test. CBCT images of post-surgical self-drilling miniscrew implant placement showed no root contact (0/44). However, based on CBCT evaluation, it was necessary to change the location or angle of 52.3 per cent (23/44) of the guide tubes prior to surgery in order to obtain optimal placement. If orthodontic force could be applied to the screw until completion of orthodontic treatment, screw anchorage was recorded as successful. The total success rate of all miniscrews was 90.9 per cent (40/44). Orthodontic self-drilling miniscrew implants must be inserted carefully, particularly in the case of blind placement, since even guide tubes made on casts frequently require repositioning to avoid the roots of the teeth. The use of surgical guides, fabricated using CBCT images, appears to be a promising technique for placement of orthodontic self-drilling miniscrew implants adjacent to the dental roots and maxillary sinuses.\n\nCombustion Synthesis of Ca3(PO4)2 Net-Shape Surgical Implants\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAyers, Reed A.; Castillo, Martin; Gottoli, Guglielmo; Moore, John J.; Simske, Steven J.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nSelf-propagating high-temperature combustion synthesis (SHS) is the basis of a method of making components of porous tricalcium phosphate [Ca3(PO4)2] and related compounds in net sizes and shapes for use as surgical implants that are compatible with bone.

Financial data from 3,973 hip, knee, and shoulder arthroplasties performed at a physician owned orthopedic hospital was retrospectively reviewed over a two-year period. A wasted implant financial report was posted starting the second year of the study. Each surgeon's performance could be identified by his peers. After posting of the financial report, 1.11% of all hip and knee arthroplasty cases had a waste event compared to 1.50% during the control year. Shoulder arthroplasty waste events occurred twice as often than that observed in hip and knee arthroplasty during the study period. A decrease in waste events was observed but was not statistically significant (p = 0.30). Posting a non-blinded wasted implant data sheet was associated with a reduction in the number of wasted orthopedic surgical implants in this series, although the reduction was not statistically significant.\n\nSurgically Induced Scleral Necrosis in a Patient With Rheumatoid Arthritis After AGV Implantation.\n\nPubMed\n\nKumar, Suresh; Ichhpujani, Parul; Thakur, Sahil\n\n2018-03-01\n\nSurgically induced scleral necrosis (SINS) is a rare entity that has till date not been reported in a patient of glaucoma undergoing Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV) implantation. We present a case of primary open-angle glaucoma who underwent AGV implantation followed by development of scleral necrosis, involving both the scleral patch graft and host sclera. After failure of surgical and medical management, AGV had to be explanted. The patient was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and had to be treated with steroids and azathioprine for the same. SINS is a potentially disastrous complication of ocular surgery that can occur in patients with systemic diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and requires aggressive management to salvage the eye. SINS can occur with AGV implantation. Treatment may require aggressive medical and surgical intervention. It is imperative to evaluate patients for systemic illness before planning an AGV implant.\n\nImplanting inequality: empirical evidence of social and ethical risks of implantable radio-frequency identification (RFID) devices.\n\nPubMed\n\nMonahan, Torin; Fisher, Jill A\n\n2010-10-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to assess empirically the social and ethical risks associated with implantable radio-frequency identification (RFID) devices. Qualitative research included observational studies in twenty-three U.S. hospitals that have implemented new patient identification systems and eighty semi-structured interviews about the social and ethical implications of new patient identification systems, including RFID implants. The study identified three primary social and ethical risks associated with RFID implants: (i) unfair prioritization of patients based on their participation in the system, (ii) diminished trust of patients by care providers, and (iii) endangerment of patients who misunderstand the capabilities of the systems. RFID implants may aggravate inequalities in access to care without any clear health benefits. This research underscores the importance of critically evaluating new healthcare technologies from the perspective of both normative ethics and empirical ethics.\n\nStudy of breast implant rupture: MRI versus surgical findings.\n\nPubMed\n\nVestito, A; Mangieri, F F; Ancona, A; Minervini, C; Perchinunno, V; Rinaldi, S\n\n2012-09-01\n\nThis study evaluated the role of breast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the selective study breast implant integrity. We retrospectively analysed the signs of breast implant rupture observed at breast MR examinations of 157 implants and determined the sensitivity and specificity of the technique in diagnosing implant rupture by comparing MR data with findings at surgical explantation. The linguine and the salad-oil signs were statistically the most significant signs for diagnosing intracapsular rupture; the presence of siliconomas/seromas outside the capsule and/or in the axillary lymph nodes calls for immediate explantation. In agreement with previous reports, we found a close correlation between imaging signs and findings at explantation. Breast MR imaging can be considered the gold standard in the study of breast implants.\n\nEvaluation of intensity of artefacts in CBCT by radio-opacity of composite simulation models of implants in vitro\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKuusisto, N; Vallittu, P K; Lassila, L V J\n\n2015-01-01\n\nObjectives: The aim was to compare the intensity of artefacts in CBCT images caused by different percentages of radio-opacifying material in composite simulation models of implants. Titanium and zirconia models of implants were used as a reference for the evaluation of the intensity of artefacts. Methods: Seven different percentages of radio-opacifying BaAlSiO2 fillers were added to composite resin to fabricate seven step wedges and simulation models of implants. Titanium and zirconia simulation models of implants were also fabricated. Aluminium step wedge was used as a reference for the measurement of grey values in intraoral radiographs. Step wedges were exposed with a Planmeca Intra X-ray machine (Planmeca Oy, Helsinki, Finland). All composite, titanium and zirconia simulation models of implants were exposed with a SCANORAÂ® 3D dental X-ray machine (Soredex, Tuusula, Finland). Images and grey values were analysed with ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). To demonstrate possible artefacts between all the simulation models of implants, the images were also visually compared with each other using ImageJ software. Results: Artefacts were clearly present in CBCT images caused by titanium and zirconia and when the composite material consisted at least 20% BaAlSiO2. The intensity of artefacts increased when the radio-opacity of the composite material increased. Conclusions: Materials containing less radio-opacity produce less pronounced artefacts. The cut-off point for artefacts is at 20% radio-opaque filling material in composite material.

Achieving the goal of ideal implant position may be affected by case selection, prosthodontically driven treatment planning, site preparation, surgeon's experience and use of a surgical guide. The combined effect of surgical guide design, surgeon's experience, and size of the edentulous area on the accuracy of implant placement was evaluated in a simulated clinical setting. Twenty-one volunteers were recruited to participate in the study. They were divided evenly into 3 groups (novice, intermediate, and experienced). Each surgeon placed implants in single and double sites using 4 different surgical guide designs (no guide, tube, channel, and guided) and written instructions describing the ideal implant positions. A definitive typodont was constructed that had 3 implants in prosthetically determined ideal positions of single and double sites. The position and angulation of implants placed by the surgeons in the duplicate typodonts was measured using a computerized coordinate measuring machine and compared to the definitive typodont. The mean absolute positional error for all guides was 0.273, 0.340, 0.197 mm in mesial-distal, buccal-lingual, vertical positions, respectively, with an overall range of 0.00 to 1.81 mm. The mean absolute angle error for all guides was 1.61Â° and 2.39Â° in the mesial-distal and buccal-lingual angulations, respectively, with an overall range of 0.01Â° to 9.7Â°. Surgical guide design had a statistically significant effect on the accuracy of implant placement regardless of the surgeon's experience level. Experienced surgeons had significantly less error in buccal-lingual angulation. The size of the edentulous sites was found to affect both implant angle and position significantly. The magnitude of error in position and angulation caused by surgical guide design, surgeon's experience, and site size reported in this study are possibly not large enough to be clinically\n\nRehabilitation with 4 zygomatic implants with a new surgical protocol using ultrasonic technique.\n\nPubMed\n\nMozzati, Marco; Mortellaro, Carmen; Arata, Valentina; Gallesio, Giorgia; Previgliano, Valter\n\n2015-05-01\n\nWhen the residual bone crest cannot allow the placement of standard implants, the treatment for complete arch rehabilitation of severely atrophic maxillae can be performed with 4 zygomatic implants (ZIs) and immediate function with predictable results in terms of aesthetics, function, and comfort for the patient. However, even if ZIs' rehabilitations showed a good success rate, this surgery is difficult and need a skillful operator. Complications in this kind of rehabilitation are not uncommon; the main difficulties can be related to the reduced surgical visibility and instrument control in a critical anatomic area. All the surgical protocols described in the literature used drilling techniques. Furthermore, the use of ultrasonic instruments in implant surgery compared with drilling instruments have shown advantages in many aspects of surgical procedures, tissues management, enhancement of control, surgical visualization, and healing. The aim of this study was to report on the preliminary experience using ultrasound technique for ZIs surgery in terms of safety and technical improvement. Ten consecutive patients with severely atrophic maxilla have been treated with 4 ZIs and immediate complete arch acrylic resin provisional prostheses. The patients were followed up from 30 to 32 months evaluating implant success, prosthetic success, and patient satisfaction with a questionnaire. No implants were lost during the study period, with a 100% implant and prosthetic success rate. Within the limitations of this preliminary study, these data indicate that ultrasonic implant site preparation for ZIs can be a good alternative to the drilling technique and an improvement for the surgeon.\n\nMeasurement of bovine body and scrotal temperature using implanted temperature sensitive radio transmitters, data loggers and infrared thermography\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWallage, A. L.; Gaughan, J. B.; Lisle, A. T.; Beard, L.; Collins, C. W.; Johnston, S. D.\n\n2017-07-01\n\nSynchronous and continuous measurement of body (BT) and scrotal temperature (ST) without adverse welfare or behavioural interference is essential for understanding thermoregulation of the bull testis. This study compared three technologies for their efficacy for long-term measurement of the relationship between BT and ST by means of (1) temperature sensitive radio transmitters (RT), (2) data loggers (DL) and (3) infrared imaging (IRI). After an initial pilot study on two bulls to establish a surgical protocol, RTs and DLs were implanted into the flank and mid-scrotum of six Wagyu bulls for between 29 and 49 days. RT frequencies were scanned every 15 min, whilst DLs logged every 30 min. Infrared imaging of the body (flank) and scrotum of each bull was recorded hourly for one 24-h period and compared to RT and DL data. After a series of subsequent heat stress studies, bulls were castrated and testicular tissue samples processed for evidence of histopathology. Radio transmitters were less reliable than DLs; RTs lost >11 % of data, whilst 11 of the 12 DLs had 0 % data loss. IRI was only interpretable in 35.8 % of images recorded. Pearson correlations between DL and RT were strong for both BT ( r > 0.94, P < 0.001) and ST ( r > 0.80, P < 0.001). Surgery produced temporary minor inflammation and scrotal hematoma in two animals post-surgery. Whilst scar tissue was observed at all surgical sutured sites when bulls were castrated, there was no evidence of testicular adhesion and normal active spermatogenesis was observed in six of the eight implanted testicles. There was no significant correlation of IRI with either DL or RT. We conclude that DLs provided to be a reliable continuous source of data for synchronous measurement of BT and ST.\n\nComparison of migration rate and survival between radio-tagged and PIT-tagged migrant yearling chinook salmon in the Snake and Columbia rivers\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nHockersmith, E.E.; Muir, W.D.; Smith, S.G.; Sandford, B.P.; Perry, R.W.; Adams, N.S.; Rondorf, D.W.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nA study was conducted to compare the travel times, detection probabilities, and survival of migrant hatchery-reared yearling chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha tagged with either gastrically or surgically implanted sham radio tags (with an imbedded passive integrated transponder [PIT] tag) with those of their cohorts tagged only with PIT tags in the Snake and Columbia rivers. Juvenile chinook salmon with gastrically implanted radio tags migrated significantly faster than either surgically radio-tagged or PIT-tagged fish, while migration rates were similar among surgically radio-tagged and PIT-tagged fish. The probabilities of PIT tag detection at downstream dams varied by less than 5% and were not significantly different among the three groups. Survival was similar among treatments for median travel times of less than approximately 6 d (migration distance of 106 km). However, for both gastrically and surgically radio-tagged fish, survival was significantly less than for PIT-tagged fish, for which median travel times exceeded approximately 10 d (migration distance of 225 km). The results of this study support the use of radio tags to estimate the survival of juvenile chinook salmon having a median fork length of approximately 150 mm (range, 127-285 mm) and a median travel time of migration of less than approximately 6 d.\n\nAccuracy of implant surgery with surgical guide by inexperienced clinicians: an in vitro study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTanaka, Hideaki; Sasaki, Masanori; Ichimaru, Eiji; Naito, Yasushi; Matsushita, Yasuyuki; Koyano, Kiyoshi; Nakamura, Seiji\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAbstract Implant surgery with surgical guide has been introduced with a concept of position improvement. The surgery might be considered as easy even for inexperienced clinician because of step simplicity. However, there are residual risks, resulting in postoperative complications. The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of implant surgery with surgical guide by inexperienced clinicians in in vitro. After preoperative computed tomographies (CTs) of five artificial models of unilateral freeâend edentulism with scan templates, five surgical guides were established from templates. Following virtual planning, 10 implants were placed in the 45 and 47 regions by five residents without any placement experiences. All drillings and placements were performed using surgical guides. After postoperative CTs, inaccurate verifications between virtual and actual positions of implants were carried out, by overlaying of pre/postoperative CT data. The angle displacement of implant axis in the 47 region was significantly larger than that in the 45 region (Pâ=â0.031). The 3D offset of implant base in the 47 region was significantly larger than that in the 45 region (Pâ=â0.002). For distal/apical directions, displacements of base in the 47 region were significantly larger than those in the 45 region (Pâ=â0.004 and Pâ=â0.003, respectively). The 3D offset of implant tip in the 47 region was significantly larger than that in the 45 region (Pâ=â0.003). For distal/apical directions, displacements of tip in the 47 region were significantly larger than those in the 45 region (Pâ=â0.002 and Pâ=â0.003, respectively). Within limitations of this in vitro study, data for accuracy of implant surgery with surgical guide would be informative for further studies, because in vitro studies should be substantially made to avoid unnecessary burden of patients, in advance of retro/prospective studies. A comparison of the accuracy in this in vitro model between by\n\nPost-Surgical Clinical Monitoring of Soft Tissue Wound Healing in Periodontal and Implant Surgery\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPippi, Roberto\n\n2017-01-01\n\nClinical features of surgical soft tissue wound healing in dentistry have been rarely discussed in the international literature. The aim of the present paper is to highlight both the main clinical findings of surgical wound healing, especially in periodontal and implant dentistry, and the wound healing monitoring procedures which should be followed. Wound inspection after careful food and plaque debridement is the essential part of wound healing monitoring. Periodontal and peri-implant probing should be performed only after tissue healing has been completed and not on a weekly basis in peri-implant tissue monitoring. Telephone follow-up and patient self-assessment scales can also be used the days following surgery to monitor the most common surgical complications such as pain, swelling, bleeding, and bruising. Wound healing monitoring is an important concern in all surgical procedures since it allows to identify signs or/and symptoms possibly related to surgical complications.

A successful esthetic implant reconstruction is predicated on two fundamental components: the reproduction of the natural tooth characteristics on the implant crown and the establishment of soft tissue housing that will simulate a healthy periodontium. In order for an implant to optimally rehabilitate esthetics, the peri-implant soft tissues must be preserved and/or augmented by means of periodontal surgical procedures. Clinicians who practice implant dentistry should strive to achieve an esthetically successful outcome beyond just osseointegration. Knowledge of a variety of available techniques and proper treatment planning enables the clinician to meet the ever-increasing esthetic demands as requested by patients. The purpose of this paper is to enhance the implant surgeon's rationale and techniques beyond that of simply placing a functional restoration in an edentulous site to a level whereby an implant-supported restoration is placed in reconstructed soft tissue, so the site is indiscernible from a natural tooth.

H.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nThe customary presentation of surgical procedures to patients in the United States consists of discussions on alternative treatment methods, risks of the procedure(s) under consideration, and potential benefits for the patient. Because the contents of the normal speech signal have not been defined in a way that permits a surgeon systematically to provide alternative auditory signals to a deaf patient, the burden is placed on the surgeon to make an arbitrary selection of candidates and available devices for cochlear prosthetic implantation. In an attempt to obtain some information regarding the ability of a deaf patient to use electrical signals to detect and understand speech, the Good Samaritan Hospital and Neurological Sciences Institute cochlear implant team has routinely performed tympanotomies using local anesthesia and has positioned temporary electrodes onto the round windows of implant candidates. The purpose of this paper is to review our experience with this procedure and to provide some observations that may be useful in a comprehensive preoperative evaluation for totally deaf patients who are being considered for cochlear implantation.\n\nAccuracy of a cone beam computed tomography-guided surgical stent for orthodontic mini-implant placement.\n\nPubMed\n\nYu, Jae-Jung; Kim, Gyu-Tae; Choi, Yong-Suk; Hwang, Eui-Hwan; Paek, Janghyun; Kim, Seong-Hun; Huang, John C\n\n2012-03-01\n\nTo validate the accuracy of a cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT)-guided surgical stent for orthodontic mini-implant (OMI) placement by quantitatively evaluating the difference between CBCT-prescribed and actual position of mini-implants in preoperative and postoperative CBCT images. A surgical stent was fabricated using Teflon-Perfluoroalkoxy, which has appropriate biological x-ray attenuation properties. Polyvinylsiloxane impression material was used to secure the custom-made surgical stent onto swine mandibles. CBCT scanning was done with the stent in place to virtually plan mini-implants using a three-dimensional (3D) software program. An appropriate insertion point was determined using 3D reconstruction data, and the vertical and horizontal angulations were determined using four prescribed angles. A custom-designed surveyor was used to drill a guide hole within the surgical stent as prescribed on the CBCT images for insertion of 32 OMIs. The mandibles with a surgical stent in place were rescanned with CBCT to measure the deviations between the virtual planning data and surgical results. The difference between the prescribed and actual vertical angle was 1.01 Â± 7.25, and the horizontal difference was 1.16 Â± 6.08. The correlation coefficient confirms that there was no intrarater variability in either the horizontal (R â=â .97) or vertical (R â=â .74) vectors. The surgical stent in this study guides mini-implants to the prescribed position as planned in CBCT. Since the statistical difference was not significant, the surgical stent can be considered to be an accurate guide tool for mini-implant placement in clinical use.\n\nNoncardiac Surgical Procedures After Left Ventricular Assist Device Implantation.\n\nPubMed\n\nTaghavi, Sharven; Jayarajan, Senthil N; Ambur, Vishnu; Mangi, Abeel A; Chan, Elaine; Dauer, Elizabeth; Sjoholm, Lars O; Pathak, Abhijit; Santora, Thomas A; Goldberg, Amy J; Rappold, Joseph F\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAs left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are increasingly used for patients with end-stage heart failure, the need for noncardiac surgical procedures (NCSs) in these patients will continue to rise. We examined the various types of NCS required and its outcomes in LVAD patients requiring NCS. The National Inpatient Sample Database was examined for all patients implanted with an LVAD from 2007 to 2010. Patients requiring NCS after LVAD implantation were compared to all other patients receiving an LVAD. There were 1,397 patients undergoing LVAD implantation. Of these, 298 (21.3%) required 459 NCS after LVAD implantation. There were 153 (33.3%) general surgery procedures, with abdominal/bowel procedures (n = 76, 16.6%) being most common. Thoracic (n = 141, 30.7%) and vascular (n = 140, 30.5%) procedures were also common. Patients requiring NCS developed more wound infections (9.1 vs. 4.6%, p = 0.004), greater bleeding complications (44.0 vs. 24.8%, p < 0.001) and were more likely to develop any complication (87.2 vs. 82.0%, p = 0.001). On multivariate analysis, the requirement of NCSs (odds ratio: 1.45, 95% confidence interval: 0.95-2.20, p = 0.08) was not associated with mortality. Noncardiac surgical procedures are commonly required after LVAD implantation, and the incidence of complications after NCS is high. This suggests that patients undergoing even low-risk NCS should be cared at centers with treating surgeons and LVAD specialists.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging metallic artifact of commonly encountered surgical implants and foreign material.\n\nPubMed\n\nSutherland-Smith, James; Tilley, Brenda\n\n2012-01-01\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) artifacts secondary to metallic implants and foreign bodies are well described. Herein, we provide quantitative data from veterinary implants including total hip arthroplasty implants, cranial cruciate repair implants, surgical screws, a skin staple, ligation clips, an identification microchip, ameroid constrictor, and potential foreign bodies including air gun and BB projectiles and a sewing needle. The objects were scanned in a gelatin phantom with plastic grid using standardized T2-weighted turbo-spin echo (TSE), T1-weighted spin echo, and T2*-weighted gradient recalled echo (GRE) image acquisitions at 1.5 T. Maximum linear dimensions and areas of signal voiding and grid distortion were calculated using a DICOM workstation for each sequence and object. Artifact severity was similar between the T2-weighted TSE and T1-weighted images, while the T2*-weighted images were most susceptible to artifact. Metal type influenced artifact size with the largest artifacts arising from steel objects followed by surgical stainless steel, titanium, and lead. For animals with metallic surgical implants or foreign bodies, the quantification of the artifact size will help guide clinicians on the viability of MRI.

The purpose of this study was to quantify the amount of unintentional energy (electromagnetic interference [EMI]) transferred to an implanted cardiac defibrillator by common surgical energy-based devices. A transvenous cardiac defibrillator was implanted in an anesthetized pig. The primary outcome measure was the average maximum EMI occurring on the implanted cardiac device during activations of multiple different surgical energy-based devices. The EMI transferred to the implanted cardiac device is as follows: traditional bipolar 30Â W .01 Â± .004Â mV, advanced bipolar .004 Â± .003 mV, ultrasonic shears .01 Â± .004 mV, monopolar Bovie 30 W coagulation .50 Â± .20 mV, monopolar Bovie 30 W blend .92 Â± .63 mV, monopolar instrument without dispersive electrode .21 Â± .07 mV, plasma energy 3.48 Â± .78 mV, and argon beam coagulator 2.58 Â± .34 mV. Surgeons can minimize EMI on implanted cardiac defibrillators by preferentially utilizing bipolar and ultrasonic devices. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Our previous report showed that partial regeneration of a traumatic brain lesion is achieved by implantation of collagen glycosaminoglycan (CGM). Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) may play an important role in neurogenesis but there is currently a lack of studies displaying the relationship between the stimulation of MMPs and neurogenesis after collagen glycosaminoglycan implantation following surgical brain trauma. The present study was carried out to further examine the expression of MMP2 and MMP9 after implantation of collagen glycosaminoglycan (CGM) following surgical brain trauma. Using the animal model of surgically induced brain lesion, we implanted CGM into the surgical trauma. Rats were thus divided into three groups: (1) sham operation group: craniotomy only; (2) lesion (L) group: craniotomy + surgical trauma lesion; (3) lesion + CGM (L + CGM) group: CGM implanted following craniotomy and surgical trauma lesion. Cells positive for SOX2 (marker of proliferating neural progenitor cells) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP2 and MMP9) in the lesion boundary zone were assayed and analyzed by immunofluorescence and ELISA commercial kits, respectively. Our results demonstrated that following implantation of CGM after surgical brain trauma, significant increases in MMP2 + /SOX2 + cells and MMP9 + /SOX2 + cells were seen within the lesion boundary zone in the L + CGM group. Tissue protein concentrations of MMP2 and MMP9 also increased after CGM scaffold implantation. These findings suggest that implantation of a CGM scaffold alone after surgical brain trauma can enhance the expression of MMP2 and MMP9 accompanied by neurogenesis.\n\nClinical, surgical, and electrical factors impacting residual hearing in cochlear implant surgery.\n\nPubMed\n\nEshraghi, Adrien A; Ahmed, Jamal; Krysiak, Eric; Ila, Kadri; Ashman, Peter; Telischi, Fred F; Angeli, Simon; Prentiss, Sandra; Martinez, Diane; Valendia, Sandra\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThis study recommends using soft surgical principal and round window insertion to protect residual hearing with favorable anatomical exposure. Further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of the electrical stimulation on the organ of corti and hearing. The objective of this study is to analyze various factors that impact on preservation of residual hearing post-implantation. A retrospective study was performed to analyze loss of residual hearing in a cohort of 225 patients implanted in a large academic center. Sixty-four patients met the inclusion criteria. The impact of age at implantation, gender, etiology of hearing loss, cochleostomy vs round window insertion, partial vs full insertion, and effect of initial stimulation were analyzed using appropriate statistical analysis. The overall hearing preservation rate for all implanted patients was 64%. Loss of residual hearing was significantly more observed in cases of cochleostomy and/or non-soft surgical techniques. No correlation was observed with age at implantation, gender, side of implant, device manufacturer, and presence of pre-lingual deafness vs post-lingual, full or partial electrode insertion. In addition, there was a small but significant decrease in hearing between pre-stimulation and post-stimulation audiograms at 6000 Hz.\n\nImplant decontamination with 2% chlorhexidine during surgical peri-implantitis treatment: a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nde Waal, Y C M; Raghoebar, G M; Meijer, H J A; Winkel, E G; van Winkelhoff, A J\n\n2015-09-01\n\nThe objective of this randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was to evaluate the clinical, radiographic, and microbiological effects of implant surface decontamination with a 2% chlorhexidine (CHX) solution in comparison with a 0.12% chlorhexidineÂ +Â 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) solution during resective surgical peri-implantitis treatment. Forty-four patients (108 implants) with peri-implantitis were treated with resective surgical treatment consisting of bone re-contouring, surface debridement and chemical decontamination, and apically repositioned flap. Patients were randomly allocated to decontamination with a 2% CHX solution (test group) or 0.12% CHXÂ +Â 0.05% CPC (control group). Clinical and radiographic parameters were recorded before treatment (baseline), and at 3, 6, and 12Â months after treatment. Microbiological parameters were recorded during surgery. Multilevel analysis showed no significant differences in bleeding, suppuration, probing pocket depth, and radiographic bone loss between control and test group over three follow-up measurements (3, 6, and 12Â months) from baseline. Both decontamination procedures resulted in significant reductions in anaerobic bacterial counts on the implant surface, but no significant difference was noted between control and test group (mean log 3.37Â Â±Â 2.34 vs. 3.65Â Â±Â 2.87, PÂ =Â 0.99). The use of a 2% CHX solution for implant surface decontamination during resective peri-implantitis therapy does not lead to improved clinical, radiographic, or microbiological results compared with a 0.12% CHXÂ +Â 0.05% CPC solution. Overall, the additional use of CHX reduces anaerobic bacterial load on the implant surface better than mechanical debridement alone, but does not seem to enhance clinical treatment outcomes (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01852253).

A qualitative study design was chosen and 38 semi-structured telephone and face-to-face interviews were conducted with 34 patients at different stages of implant treatment. The interviews were transcribed verbatim; the data collection and coding process followed the principles of thematic analysis, which was facilitated through the use of NVivo10. Patients anticipated that surgery would be painful and unpleasant but were prepared to accept this temporary discomfort for the expected benefits of implant treatment. However, a key finding was that patients felt they had overestimated the trauma of surgery but underestimated the discomfort and difficulties of the healing phase. A number of difficulties were also identified with the TIP phase following implant surgery. Existing research has tended to focus on the longer term benefits of dental implant treatment. This qualitative study has investigated in-depth patients' perceptions of dental implant surgery, including their experiences related to sedation, and of transitional implant restoration. While patients felt their concerns were overestimated in relation to the implant surgery, they experienced greater morbidity than they expected in the healing phase. Recommendations are made for relatively small changes in care provision which might improve the overall patient experience. Partial dentate patients treated with a fixed transitional prosthesis experienced advantages more quickly than patients with an overdenture. Â© 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

A retrospective case series was assembled from ADNIV patients in which there was fibrotic encapsulation of a fluocinolone acetonide implant. CAPN5 genotypes and surgical repair techniques were reviewed. Two eyes of two ADNIV patients developed a fibrotic capsule over the fluocinolone acetonide implant. Both patients had Stage IV disease. Patient A had a c.731T > C mutation in the CAPN5 gene and patient B had a c.728G > T mutation. The fibrotic membrane was surgically excised and the implant function was restored. The exuberant fibrotic response in later stages of ADNIV may be resistant to local immunosuppression with steroids. Surgical excision of fibrotic membranes over FA implants can reestablish local steroid delivery in cases of severe proliferative vitreoretinopathy.\n\nNon-photorealistic rendering of virtual implant models for computer-assisted fluoroscopy-based surgical procedures\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZheng, Guoyan\n\n2007-03-01\n\nSurgical navigation systems visualize the positions and orientations of surgical instruments and implants as graphical overlays onto a medical image of the operated anatomy on a computer monitor. The orthopaedic surgical navigation systems could be categorized according to the image modalities that are used for the visualization of surgical action. In the so-called CT-based systems or 'surgeon-defined anatomy' based systems, where a 3D volume or surface representation of the operated anatomy could be constructed from the preoperatively acquired tomographic data or through intraoperatively digitized anatomy landmarks, a photorealistic rendering of the surgical action has been identified to greatly improve usability of these navigation systems. However, this may not hold true when the virtual representation of surgical instruments and implants is superimposed onto 2D projection images in a fluoroscopy-based navigation system due to the so-called image occlusion problem. Image occlusion occurs when the field of view of the fluoroscopic image is occupied by the virtual representation of surgical implants or instruments. In these situations, the surgeon may miss part of the image details, even if transparency"
