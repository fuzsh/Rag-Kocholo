Five days after she disappeared, her body washed up in a duffel bag about 200 yards away from the entrance of the Pensacola Naval Air Station in Florida. NCIS agents take viewers inside the investigation into what happened to Watkins in NCIS: THE CASES THEY CAN’T FORGET: “Death of a Dream,” to be broadcast at 9:00 PM.\n\nWorking with the Pensacola Police Department, NCIS agents were able to link pieces of circumstantial evidence together to arrest Watkins’ boyfriend at the time, Zachary Littleton, a Navy police officer. He was later convicted of murdering her and was sentenced to life in prison.\n\nIn his first TV interview, Littleton says investigators got it all wrong – and he admits he lied to them and was with Watkins the night she disappeared.\n\n“I don’t know what happened to Samira,” Littleton says.\n\n“They sentenced me to life in prison. Natural life. In the state of Florida, there’s no parole – life is life,” Littleton says. “I did not kill Samira Watkins.”\n\n“Death of a Dream” features interviews with the agents who painstakingly and methodically tied the evidence together and with Littleton, who explains for the first time what he says happened on the night he and Watkins were last together.\n\nAt 10:00 PM, NCIS agents take viewers inside a cold case murder of 10-year-old Tammy Welch that haunted the agency for three decades, and they look at the separate murder of Ricky Wiltrout, in the third season finale, “Never Forget.”\n\nOn August 27, 1984, Tammy Welch and her sister, Jennifer, were outside playing in an apartment courtyard the day their family was moving to Navy housing in Jacksonville, Fla. Jennifer went inside to talk with her mother, leaving Tammy alone outside. When she went back out 30 minutes later, Tammy was face down in the grass, dead. She had been brutally strangled and assaulted.\n\n“Investigating cases in which children are victims are probably one of the most difficult types of investigations an NCIS agent will come across,” says Gregory Ford, executive assistant director of NCIS Criminal Investigations. “The Tammy Welch case was every parent’s worst nightmare.”\n\nNCIS agents were called in immediately after Welch was killed. Days turned into months, months into years, with no new leads. The case turned cold, and the identity of Tammy’s killer would remain a mystery. But in 1999, NCIS’ newly formed cold-case team reopened the case, determined to solve it for Tammy’s family. The agents traveled across the county seeking DNA from more than a dozen potential suspects. It wasn’t until 2012 that agents got their first break when a partial DNA profile from the child’s former neighbor, James Jackson, was linked to the crime scene through advanced forensic testing.\n\nBut would it be enough to convict Jackson of first-degree murder? NCIS agents would need hard evidence, and what they found was a bizarre tattoo on Jackson’s back with the victim’s name and the year of her murder. It was, they say, a confession written in ink.\n\nNCIS: THE CASES THEY CAN’T FORGET is in its third season and is hosted by Rocky Carroll. The series features a slate of the biggest cases handled by the real-life Naval Criminal Investigative Service. These are the kinds of challenging investigations that have inspired cases on CBS Entertainment’s successful primetime series NCIS, broadcast television’s #1 drama, as well as NCIS: LOS ANGELES and NCIS: NEW ORLEANS. The previous name of the series was 48 HOURS: NCIS.\n\nCBS MILLION DOLLAR MILE, Saturday, July 6 Show More\n\nA FORMER WOMEN’S COLLEGE BASKETBALL PLAYER GETS A FAST BREAK AGAINST “THE HARVARD HAMMER,” A TRACK ALL AMERICAN ATHLETE, ON “MILLION DOLLAR MILE,” SATURDAY, JULY 6\n\n“The Elite of the Elite” – A former women’s college basketball player gets a fast break against “The Harvard Hammer,” a medical student who holds an All American title.

Blake was eventually acquitted and the murder was never solved. Now 18 years after the murder, Blake speaks to “20/20,” shedding light on the case and reflecting on his past, storied acting career, relationship with Bonny and life now. “20/20” airs Friday, July 5 (9:00 – 11:00 p.m. EDT), on ABC.\n\n“20/20” features interviews with key players in the case, including Thomas Mesereau, legendary Los Angeles defense attorney who represented Blake; actors Elliott Gould and Gavin MacLeod, Blake’s Hollywood contemporaries; Margerry Bakley, Bonny’s sister; Eric Dubin, Bakley family lawyer and Bobby Stefanow, friend of Bonny’s. The documentary dives into footage from the ABC News archives, including the memorable jailhouse interview with Blake and ABC News anchor Barbara Walters, seen by more than 12 million viewers. The documentary also takes a closer look at Bonny and her romantic pursuit of numerous famous men, including Jerry Lee Lewis and Christian Brando, son of actor Marlon Brando.\n\nOn May 4, 2001, Bonny and Blake had dinner at Vitello’s in Studio City, California. After returning to their car, which was parked around the corner from the restaurant, Blake claims he realized he accidentally left his gun behind in the restaurant. While he went to retrieve it, Bonny remained in the car. When Blake returned, he says he found her shot in the head. Blake was immediately a suspect, and after an almost year-long investigation, he was arrested and charged with her murder after two retired stuntmen claimed that Blake had attempted to hire them as hit men to kill his wife.\n\nThe gun that killed Bonny could not be traced and there was no gunshot residue found on Blake’s hands following the murder. The prosecution tried to argue that Blake conspired to kill Bonny because he was angry at her and didn’t want her in their child’s life. In 2005, Blake was found not guilty. Bonny’s children filed a civil suit against Blake, in which he was found liable for her wrongful death and ordered to pay them $30 million, which was later cut in half by an appeals court and then settled for an undisclosed amount.

It is a case that has hung over Bonham, Texas, since she was killed, one where police had a couple of initial suspects, but no arrests, and is one of the coldest investigations in Fannin County, Texas. Harris was just 28 when she went missing. Initially, police reached out to two men in her life. Both denied seeing her the night she disappeared. Now, more than 17 years after Harris was found dead, floating in a river, a former Marine and a filmmaker think they can find her killer. Will they be able to solve a cold case that has haunted her small Texas town since Mother’s Day 2002?\n\n48 HOURS: “Operation Murder” – 10:00 PM Preview\n\nPeter Van Sant and 48 HOURS investigate the alleged murder-for-hire plot launched by two Houston doctors and their relationship with a former U.S. Army soldier who pretended to take a hit job, in an encore of “Operation Murder” to be broadcast Saturday, July 6 (10:00 PM). Valerie McDaniel, a veterinarian, and Leon Jacob, a surgeon, quickly fell in love and even talked of marriage. Jacob was an up-and-coming doctor. She was newly single after getting a divorce from her ex-husband, Marion “Mack” McDaniel. The McDaniels were in the midst of an ugly custody battle, while Jacob was facing felony charges for stalking an ex-girlfriend. If found guilty on those charges, it could have upended his medical career. Houston Police say that’s when Jacob sought the help of Moataz Azzeh, someone he thought was a hit man to eliminate the problems. “Operation Murder” explores the case and the elaborate sting operation the Houston Police department undertook, which included staging the deaths of the intended targets.\n\nThe CW Whose Line Is It Anyway? – Sunday, June 30 Show More\n\n“Carmen Electra” – (9:00-9:30 p.m. ET) (TV-14, DL) (HDTV)\n\nGUARDING COMEDY – WITH GUEST STAR APPEARANCE BY CARMEN ELECTRA – Hosted by comedian Aisha Tyler, cast members Ryan Stiles, Wayne Brady and Colin Mochrie, along with guest comedian Brad Sherwood, put their comedic skills to the test through a series of spontaneous improv games that are prompted only by random ideas supplied by the studio audience.
