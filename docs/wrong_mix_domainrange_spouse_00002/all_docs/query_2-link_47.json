What do you think their “woke” movie would look like? Probably like this, where the N-word is replaced by horrific rape and Mexican jokes. This proto-edgelord movie was looked at as such a good time romp that it was considered the perfect vehicle to transition from the hit network show ER to the big screen. What a simpler time… From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) d. Robert Rodriguez w. Robert Kurtzman (story), Quentin Tarantino (screenplay) Starring: Harvey Keitel George Clooney Juliette Lewis Quentin Tarantino Salma Hayek Cheech Marin Danny Trejo Tom Savini Fred Williamson On the run from a bank robbery that left several police officers dead, Seth Gecko (George Clooney) and his paranoid, loose-cannon brother, Richard (Quentin Tarantino), hightail it to the Mexican border.

This might say more about where our heads are at right now than about this beloved comedy. Napoleon Dynamite (2004) d. Jared Hess w. Jared Hess, Jerusha Hess Starring: Jon Heder Efren Ramirez Jon Gries Aaron Ruell Diedrich Bader Tina Majorino Sandy Martin In small-town Preston, Idaho, awkward teen Napoleon Dynamite has trouble fitting in.

Handsome, chiseled leading man Bob Hoskins soldiers on in spite of the bleeding ulcer all that booze gave him, and Christopher Lloyd goes to eleven with his unhinged, terrifying performance. Did hentai exist before this movie? Because it sure as hell did after it. Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) d.

The pseudo-philosophy of this movie seems deeper than it is because it’s endlessly reflected in all the glass buildings of Michael Mann’s uber-masculine vision. Sure, it may be pretentious, but that’s the point, and if you’ve got a problem with that, I will take you down, because we ain’t exactly doin’ thrill-seeker podcasts with “Born to Lose” tattoos on our chests. Heat (1995) d. Michael Mann Starring: Al Pacino Robert De Niro Val Kilmer Jon Voight Tom Sizemore Natalie Portman Ashley Judd Kevin Gage Hank Azaria Danny Trejo Henry Rollins AND Xander Berkeley as RALPH!

Meanwhile, Lieutenant Hanna (Al Pacino) attempts to track down McCauley as he deals with the chaos in his own life, including the infidelity of his wife (Diane Venora) and the mental health of his stepdaughter (Natalie Portman). McCauley and Hanna discover a mutual respect, even as they try to thwart each other's plans.

Steve, a sentient walking issue of Pitchfork, schools Ryan on the infinite subgenres of hip hop while Ryan, to no one’s surprise, gets a little weepy at touching father-son relationships.

Does Steve’s complete lack of interest in professional sports bring this episode to a screeching halt? Yes. Can you tell who’s writing these summaries yet? Probably. Any Given Sunday (1999) d.

The cultural divide proves too much for Ryan in this wild, fantastic, hallucinatory Kung Fu epic of many names. The story is incomprehensible, the fights are nonsensical, but Steve still finds it defensible, while Ryan finds the editing reprehensible. There’s no reason for this rhyme. Kung Fu Cult Master (1993) d. Jing Wong, Sammo Kam-Bo Hung Starring: Jet Li Man Cheung Chingmy Yau Set during the Yuen Dynasty, many sects compete for possession of the two golden swords which contain the secret to dominance of the world of martial arts. The first faction, led by Shaolin, consists of Shaolin, Wu Tang, Ngo Mai, Kun Lun, Hung Tung and Wah Shan. The second is the Ming Sect, otherwise known as the Fire Sect or Evil Sect, led by branch leaders Queen of Purple Dragon, King of White Eagle, King of Gold Lion and King of Green Bat. A student of Wu Tang, befriends Gold Lion and marries the daughter of White Eagle. He is killed for the secret of the location of the missing sword. His infant son witnesses this and vows revenge on the heads of the sect. Unfortunately he has a jinx which prevents him from learning martial arts.
