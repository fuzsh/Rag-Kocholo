        "text": "The lineup for the 2018 BFI London Film Festival has been announced, and the public box office is open. The 12-day festival will show over 225 feature-length films from all over the globe â so here are some of the best weâve seen from this yearâs international festival circuit.\n\nWILD LIFE (2018)\n\nA teenage boy experiences the breakdown of his parentsâ marriage in Paul Danoâs crisp coming of age family drama, set in 1960s Montana, and based on Richard Fordâs novel. Although once or twice veering into melodrama, actor turned filmmaker Dano maintains impressive control over his sleek and very lucid first film which is anchored by three masterful performances, and sees a young family disintegrate after the husband loses his job. WILDLIFE has a great deal in common with Retribution Road (2008), with its similar counterpoint of aspirational hope for a couple starting out on their life in a new town â in this case Great Falls, Montana. But here the perspective is very different â in Wildlife, the entire experience is seen from the unique perspective of a pubescent boy, Joe, played thoughtfully by young Australian actor Ed Oxenbould (The Visit).\n\nWOMAN AT WAR (2018) â SACD Winner, Cannes Film Festival 2018\n\nBenedict Erlingssonâs follow-up to Of Horses and Men is a lively, often funny eco-warrior drama that follows a single woman taking on the state of Iceland with surprising results. Lead actress Haldora Geirhardsdottir has an athletic schedule, running and hiding in the countryside, with helicopters and drones circling overhead. With a magnificent twist at the end, Woman at War doesnât pull its punches: There are shades of Aki Kaurismaki, the dead pan humour taking away some of the tension of the countryside hunt for Halla. And Erlingsson makes a refreshing break from tradition in the super hero genre by casting a middle-aged woman, who is also super-fit, in the central role.\n\nTHE FAVOURITE (2018) Best Actress, Olivia Colman, Venice 2018.\n\nThe Favourite is going to be a firm favourite with mainstream audiences and cineastes alike. This latest arthouse drama is his first to be written by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara who bring their English sensibilities to this quixotic Baroque satire that distills the essence of Kubrick, Greenaway and MoliÃ¨re in an irreverent and ravishingly witty metaphor for womenâs treachery. Set around 1710 during the final moments of Queen Annesâs reign it presents an artful female centric view of courtly life seen from the unique perspective of three remarkable women while on the battlefields England is at war with the French. Despite its period setting The Favourite coins a world with exactly the same credentials as that of Brexit and Trump.\n\nSUNSET â FIPRESCI Prize Venice 2018\n\nLaszlo Nemes follows his Oscar-winning triumph Son Of Saul with another fraught and achingly romantic fragment of the past again captured through his voyeuristic camera that traces the febrile events leading up to the shooting of Emperor Franz Ferdinand that changed the world forever Set in Budapest between 1913 and the outbreak of the First World War, Sunset reveals a labyrinth of enigma, intrigue, hostility, greed and lust as the central character played by Juli Jakab (Son of Saul) guides us through scenes of ravishing elegance and cataclysmic violence. What seems utter chaos gradually becomes more clear as the spiderweb is infiltrated. Nemes pays homage to the late Gabor Body whose Narcissus and Psyche, are the obvious touchstones to Sunset. On an historical level, Mathias Erdelyâs images conjure up the fin-de-siÃ¨cle fragility in the same way as Gaborâs masterpieces.\n\nBORDER â Winner, Un Certain Regard, Cannes 2018\n\nBORDER is one of those bracingly original films. Melding fantasy and folklore while teetering on the edge of Gothic horror, it manages to be cleverly convincing and unbelievably weird at the same time. Fraught with undercurrents of sexual identity and self-realisation this gruesome rites of passage fable is another fabulous story with enduring appeal for the arthouse crowd and diehard fans of low key horror. Based on a short story by Let the Right One In creator John Ajvide Lindqvist it is Ali Abbasiâs follow up to Shelley and his first film with writing partner Isabella Ekloff. Abbasi masterfully manages the subtle strands of his storyline while keeping the tension taut and a mischievous humour bubbling under the surface.\n\nDOGMAN Best Actor, Marcello Forte, Cannes 2018 | Palm Dog Winner 2018\n\nMatteo Garroneâs terrific revenge thriller returns to the filmmakerâs own stamping ground of Caserta with a richly thematic and compulsive exploration of male rivalry and belonging in a downtrodden, criminal-infested, football-playing community scratching a living in a seaside backwater. Life has always been tough in this neck of the woods, infested by gangland influences: it is a terrain that Garrone knows and describes well in his 2008 feature Gomorrah. A brutal brotherhood controls this bleak coastal wilderness where everyone relies on each other to survive. Dogman a gritty and violent film and often unbearably so, but there are moments of heart-rending tenderness â between his Marcello and his doggy dependants â where tears will certainly well up. Fonte won Best Award at Cannes for his skilful portrayal that switches subtly from sad loner to daring desperado.\n\nMADELINEâS MADELINE\n\nJosephine Deckerâs inventive, impressionistic dramas â Butter on the Latch (2013) /Though Wast Mild and Lovely (2014) are an acquired taste but one that marks her out as a distinctive female voice on the American indie circuit. And here she is at Sundance again with a multi-layered mother and daughter tale that is probably her best feature so far. With a stunning central performance from newcomer Helena Howard and a dash of cinematic chutzpah that sends this soaring, Madelineâs Madeline is a thing of beauty â intoxicating to watch, compellingly chaotic with a potently emotional storyline.\n\nMUSEUM â Best Script Berlinale 2018\n\nAlonso Ruizpalaciosâ follow-up to his punchy debut GuÃ«ros, sees two wayward young Mexicans from Satellite City robbing the local archeological museum of its Mayan treasures â simply out of boredom. MUSEUM is an offbeat but strangely captivating drama that gradually gets more entertaining, although it never quite feels completely satisfying, despite some stunningly inventive sequences and three convincing performances from Gael Garcia Bernal, Simon Russell Beale and Alfredo Castro (The Club). Itâs largely down to local Mexican incompetence that these two amateurish dudes (Bernal/Ortizgris) get away with their heist in the first place. But what starts as a so-so domestic drama with the same aesthetic as No!, slowly starts to sizzle with suspense as the director deftly manages the filmâs tonal shifts to surprise and even delight us â this is a film that deserves a watch for its sheer wakiness and inventive chutzpah.\n\nIN FABRIC\n\nImpeccable red talons slide a flick knife across a box to reveal its contours, a beautiful silky dress that can kill. Peter Stricklandâs latest, highly-anticipated oddball feature again stars Sidse Babett Knudsen (The Duke of Burgundy) in a haunting ghost story that follows the fate of this bedevilled garment as it passes from owner to owner, with tragic consequences against the backdrop of the winter sales in a busy department store. This is a gem of a giallo with Stricklandâs signature soundscape dominating, just as it did in Berberian Sound Studio.\n\nTHE WILD PEAR TREE â Palme dâOr, Cannes 2018\n\nNuri Bilge Ceylanâs long-awaited follow-up to Winter Sleep melds his classic themes of family, fate and self-realisation into a leisurely and immersive 3-hour narrative that won him the Palme dâOr at this yearâs Cannes. This is a sumptuous, visual treat to savour but youâll never actually see a pear tree.\n\nTHEYâLL LOVE ME WHEN IâM DEAD (2018)\n\nThere should be a sub-genre dedicated to films about the multi-talented force that was Orson Welles. Here Morgan Neville (Best of Enemies) has his turn with a focus on the final fifteen years of the director Welles as he pins his Hollywood comeback on a film called The Other Side of the Wind, a film within a film sees an ageing director trying to complete his final oeuvre. Wellesâ film starring John Huston and Peter Bogdanovich was a hotchpotch of brilliance and tedium, in equal parts. Nevilleâs doc offers new insight into the creative legend with clarity and charismatic flourishes that would make Welles turn in his graveâ¦with approval.

Having spent over a year in gestation at a cost of nearly $2 million before finally hitting cinemas long after the craze for âall-talking, all-singing, all-dancingâ big screen musicals had run its course, despite also being all-colour it was a cataclysmic box office flop when it opened in the spring of 1930. It would have brought Universal to its knees but for the success of All Quiet on the Western Front, released three days earlier; although it was popular enough abroad to break even eventually.\n\nBut KING OF JAZZ has enjoyed the last laugh. It exists! And people are still watching it!! This vast, sprawling folly is one of the very few musicals shot entirely in early two-colour Technicolor to have actually survived in colour, has now been restored to something like its original form â and there has never been anything else quite like it!\n\nThe Technicolor process in those days was limited to just two primary colours, and sometimes looks almost like sepia; and the strange combination of brick red and sea green does occasionally become a little wearing. The âRhapsody in Blueâ sequence, for example, proved a nightmare to shoot; both because of the intense heat from the lights required (which caused the varnish on the violins to peel and the wood in the pianos to warp) and because despite everyoneâs best efforts the Technicolor process as it then existed simply could not manage the colour blue. They eventually had to settle for a Rhapsody in Turquoise. For the magnificent job that he did with the limited palette at his disposal, art director Herman Rosse was rewarded with the first ever Academy Award to go to a Technicolor feature.\n\nThe blue eyes of the young Bing Crosby â then one of a trio under contact to Whiteman called The Rhythm Boys â show up vividly in his close-ups, however. Starting with the opening credits (under which the Young Groaner can be heard singing âMusic Hath Charmsâ), he occasionally saunters in and out of the proceedings; although his big solo number âThe Song of the Dawnâ went to John Boles because Bing was in the slammer for a drink-driving offence when it was being filmed.\n\nFrom the very start the audience is put on notice that they are in store for something unprecedented when we are treated to an animated prologue by Walter Lantz featuring Whiteman himself in what was the first cartoon ever to be made in Technicolor. The makers evidently threw in any bright idea that took their fancy, starting with the introduction of the members of Whitemanâs band by having them climb out in miniature from a valise brought on to the set by Whiteman, following by a magnificently coloured sequence in which they present themselves by playing individual tunes with their instruments. Of the many visual jolts the film supplies the most startling may well be when a very convincing miniature of New York is suddenly invaded by King Kong-sized chorus girls; not to mention Whiteman himself apparently performing an energetic Charleston. As a further bonus much of the choreography and camera angles of the chorus girls (who perform their first routine sitting down) are obviously pre-Code; ditto Marion Stattler being flung about in a very short skirt and frilly knickers to the strains of âRagamuffin Romeoâ sung by the elfin Jeanie Lang. The comic quickies too include a remarkable array of jokes about drunkenness, adultery; and other details like a chorus sheet that pops up in Hebrew wouldnât have been a feature of the more whitebread Hollywood product later in the decade. (Another comic skit â âAll Noisy on the Eastern Frontâ â plugs that springâs concurrent blockbuster from Universal).\n\nThe pace of the film actually picks up as it progresses, and of the big production numbers themselves, âHappy Feetâ is easily the liveliest and most engaging; with Al Normanâs rubber legs flopping around like those of the cartoon Whiteman did in the prologue. The grand finale, âThe Melting Pot of Musicâ, on the other hand, goes way over the top in its extravagance and exposes Andersonâs theatrical background by repeatedly shooting the participants as if on a stage (the original director, Paul Fejos would probably have made better use of the famous camera crane he created for the film Broadway).\n\nAnd then thereâs the complete lack of black faces from the final line up. We see bagpipes, Irish harps and Viennese waltzes â but nothing from Africa. Throughout King of Jazz Africaâs contribution to jazz is almost totally ignored, yet there are JUST sufficient acknowledgments of the existence of black people to suggest that the film is attempting to introduce them into the film, but is doing so almost subliminally to avoid offending sensibilities south of the Mason-Dixon line. The only black face we see in the entire film is of a pretty little black girl we see sitting on Whitemanâs lap at the conclusion of the number âA Bench in the Parkâ. Later on Whiteman informs us that âJazz was born in the African jungle, to the beating of the voodoo drum,â and the âRhapsody in Blueâ sequence begins with the gleaming, dramatically lit physique of black dancer Jacques Cartier dressed as an African chieftain beating that very drum. Less remarked upon is the choice of Africa as the setting for the opening sequence; as if making discreet acknowledgement of the input from that continent by beginning the film there. RICHARD CHATTEN\n\nTHE BFI LONDON FILM FESTIVAL 5-16 OCTOBER 2016\n\nStephen Mayne caught up with Mya Taylor and Sean Baker during the UK Premiere of TANGERINE at this BFI London Film Festival\n\nCapturing the moment is exciting but it comes at a price. That much is evident when I walk into the room at the Mayfair Hotel to meet Sean Baker and Mya Taylor, director/writer and co-star respectively of breakout US indie hit Tangerine. Mya, elegant despite the strain of endless media engagements is commenting on her schedule for the day: â23 interviews, 2 photos shoots and 3 Q&As right?â She turns to Sean, a slender figure dressed in black, for confirmation. Heâs on his way out as he answers: âI donât know but suddenly my bladder is about to burst. Can you start and Iâll be right back?â\n\nWith TANGERINE making its bow at the 59th London Film Festival in the evening, Iâm the 15th journalist wheeled in front of them already and its only lunchtime. They bear me graciously, even if Mya only acquiesces to Seanâs brief absence on the proviso I donât ask any dull questions along the lines of how she met him. Incidentally, he discovered her at an LGBT centre around the corner from the notorious Red Light district of the Santa Monica and Highland intersection presented in the film. Not that I asked of course!\n\nFrom the streets of LA, she now faces different challenges. Having to work through the same repetitive questions clearly takes a toll for a start. âJournalists ask the same shit over and over and over. Like I just answered this shit, itâs in magazines. Why donât you just read about it and put it in your interview.â She can turn on the charm when she needs to though. âActually, you English people are so much cleverer with your questions. You guys are smarter than Americans.â\n\nThe furore around TANGERINE is both a surprise and somehow expected given the growing prominence of transgender issues in the mainstream media this year. The film follows two transgender prostitutes, played by Mya and Kitana Kiki Rodriquez, as they wander the streets of LA on Christmas Eve dealing with a collection of quirky characters during the course of the day. Shot on iPhones with a hyper-real feel and an impressive soundtrack, itâs high tempo, energetic madness that proves utterly irresistible. Donât just take my word for it. Magnolia Pictures who snapped up world distribution rights at Sundance in January are even planning an Oscar push for Mya and Kitana, which would make them the first transgender actresses to receive nominations if all goes to plan.\n\nAcademy award glamour is a far cry from the world presented in the film, as Mya knows only too well after moving to LA at 18. âI used to be in that world. I couldnât do much with my life even though I was trying. And now Iâm an actress and known everywhere and Iâm in a totally different life.â She sounds amazed but it has been kind of amazing. Sheâs also clear her past is a way of life sheâs happy to leave behind. âItâs something you want to be away from, I guess because itâs so miserable. There was a time when I was homeless and I had to sleep inside menâs sex clubs. Thereâs a risk of a man trying to touch you and have sex with you. Youâre trying to sleep and thereâs loud music playing and people having sex everywhere. Itâs nasty.â\n\nSleeping inside sex clubs isnât even the worst option. âThere was one time that I slept behind a dumpster because I didnât want to be bothered. I thought the police would probably come if I was on the sidewalk. But it was so uncomfortable that other times Iâd stay up all night and walk around and sleep inside the youth centre the next day. Iâd get like four or five hours of sleep a day.â\n\nAt the mention of youth centres, I wonder whether there are more options now available to help people stuck in Myaâs former situation. The answer is mixed. Mya feels LA offers the most help of anywhere sheâs been, but youth centres donât address all the problems. âThink about this; if Iâm up all night and I go to the centre the next day to sleep, my whole day is gone right there. You canât accomplish anything because youâre trying to sleep. Itâs the same cycle every day for a lot of the transgender girls.â Even when they can find somewhere to catch up on sleep, discrimination is never far away. âWhen transgender girls do actually go interview for jobs they get turned down because theyâre trans. I just went to get my ID changed to say my gender is female. It will be finalised next August [weâre in October 2015 now]. Letâs say I go to an interview and have to give them my documentation. If they see Iâm trans I wonât get hired. Thatâs just how it has been. Whether youâre pretty or passable, if that information isnât changed, or if they just know youâre trans, you wonât get hired. The best thing to try and do is live stealth so nobody knows.â\n\nThere is hope that change is coming at last. Sean seems upbeat over what heâs seen. The 44 year old filmmaker, a stalwart of the indie scene after four previous features and a gloriously odd puppet sitcom Greg the Bunny threw himself into Myaâs old world when developing TANGERINE and still keeps tabs on it. He seems excited that the LGBT centre where he first discovered her now has a department dedicated to transgender people. âI think theyâre doing a whole employment thing. It seems with the recent awareness that existing foundations are putting targets in place to help trans people.â\n\nThis awareness is partly why TANGERINE has drawn such notice. Aside from being rather good, itâs currently riding a wave of interest in transgender issues. But will it last or are we witnessing a well-meaning flash in the pan? Mya is unequivocal. âItâs the start of something. This something isnât going to fade.â Seanâs equally adamant. âItâs a movement not a fad. All I know is when I started hearing the general public talking about trans issues and the fact that in the US the most generic mainstream poppy radio stations are talking about it, you know itâs broken into the mainstream. Itâs an issue that has reached this point in the zeitgeist where itâs on everybodyâs minds. When we set down this road two and a half years ago it must have been brewing. I thought we were the only ones thinking about it but thatâs obviously not true.â\n\nSean credits three major events in the US that have helped to turn the tide. âYou have Obama using the word transgender in a presidential address, you have Laverne Cox [star of Orange is the New Black] on the cover of Time, and you have Caitlyn [Jenner], the biggest celebrity to go through a transition publicly.â\n\nWith all this in mind, I ask what they expected when they set out on the film in 2013. Surely the excitement generated by TANGERINE must have come as a surprise. For Sean he just saw it as a chance to make another film following the release of Starlet, his fourth feature, in 2012. âI couldnât get funding for a bigger film and was desperate to make another movie right away. I remember Mark [Duplass, executive producer of TANGERINE and established director /actor in his own right] had offered me this micro-budget thing if I wanted. It was a real step back as usually you want to increase your budget and this was less than half my previous film. It was when we got the thumbs up from Mark and started doing our research that we took it seriously hoping it would be a recognised indie that would travel the world. Getting to Cannes, Venice or Berlin, thatâs the whole goal for me anyway.â\n\nFor Mya, considering where she came from and where she now is, itâs been so much more. Barring a one-off appearance as a zombie in a small TV series in 2010 this is her acting debut. From the LA of TANGERINE sheâs sitting in London just days after Magnoliaâs Oscar push announcement. Tired as she is, sheâs clearly having a ball. âItâs my first time in London and I love it. I want to move here and get a house. I think Iâm going to buy Buckingham Palace.â A note of realism does creep in. âThat place is priceless though; I donât even think Donald Trump could afford it.â I doubt she would want to be responsible for kicking the Queen out anyway. After a constitutional detour we establish Her Majestyâs ceremonial role much to Myaâs amusement. âSo the Queen just happens to be very rich and luxurious and gorgeous at an old age? I love her.â\n\nAs for whatâs next, who knows. Mya is certainly very sanguine about it. âI donât really put too much expectation on my future; I just go with the flow. Thatâs all I have to say.â Very much in keeping with the film really.\n\nTANGERINE IS ON GENERAL RELEASE FROM 13 NOVEMBER NATIONWIDE\n\nALEX BARRETT MET UP WITH FRENCH PROVOCATEUR CATHERINE BREILLAT TO TALK ABOUT HER LATEST FILM ABUSE OF WEAKNESS WHICH STARS ISABELLE HUPPERT.\n\nIsabelle Huppert plays Maud, a film director who suffers a vicious brain haemorrhage. The stroke leaves Maud partly paralysed, but when she forms a friendship with the con-man she hopes to cast in her next film, questions arise as to who is abusing whose weakness â and who it is who is really in control. For Breillat herself, who underwent a similar situation in her own life, there are no easy answers. âAbuse of Weaknessâ is a legal term, and although the law may declare Maud a victim, Maud herself may see things differently.\n\nAs Breillat explains: âShe loves spending time with him. She loves it every time they behave like adolescents. Itâs a part of the relationshipâ¦an abuse of weakness [can be] pleasantâ. But Maud, despite her inner strength, is physically fragile â something she doesnât want to accept. Itâs a sad truth that Breillat herself also has to deal with: âWhen I am alone in my flat and I have to wake up, when I first stand up and find my balance, itâs very complicated and dangerous for me. I need concentration. I never get used to it. I cannot, because if I was to really understand it, Iâd have to just sit and be quietâ.\n\nSo perhaps, then, Maudâs relationship with con-man Vilko Piran (played by rapper and actor Kool Shen) is in part a bid to escape herself, to forget her own weakness. On set, a director is all powerful, and perhaps Maud forgets that her ability to control what goes on around her may not extend to real life. For Breillat, itâs certainly significant that Maud views Vilko not as an ex-con, but as an actor. âEvery director has to be interested with an actorâ, she says. One senses that perhaps the mistake Maud makes is to relent when Vilko insists she sees him regularly before the shoot â something Breillat is normally against. âEven with Isabelle, who I know very very wellâ¦ when I asked her to play the role, I just gave her the script. I had dinner with her and my producer, and then nothing. I never talked with her. I have no desire before [the shoot]. The first time I saw her was for the costume fittingâ.\n\nIf Maud had done the same with Vilko, then perhaps his gentle extortion of Maudâs money could have been avoided. But actors, for directors, are alluring â an object, even, of desire. For Breillat, though, they are also tools: âItâs the same for me as a violinist who needs a Stradivariusâ¦Itâs a strange relationship. Itâs not that you deny them as a human person, but thatâs not that what you need for your movie. You need the fantasy of Kool Shen, not what they are. Thatâs why I donât want to see them before, because I have to dream and not to have too much material life with themâ. Here again, perhaps, is an insight into Maud: she sees the fantasy of Vilko, and his presence in front of her somehow never counters her imagination of him. Directors are, after all, fantasists who spend as much time in a world of their own making as they do in concrete reality.\n\nBut in making the film, Breillat is also confronting her own past â even if sheâs keen to point out that this isnât a biopic. For Breillat, Maud is not a transposition of herself, and Huppert ânever accepted to interpretâ her, as it would be âmiserable and without interestâ. As she explains: â[The audience] donât care how I am. I have no interest for them. No interest. They want to see a storyâ. Such an approach allowed Breillat to take an objective stance towards the character, and yet, for all this, the making of the film remained an emotional experience: âI can speak of Maud. I can direct Maud. But I cannot see [the film], impossible. Then I cry. But on the set I donât cry. For the actors, it was more emotional than if it was strict fictionâ¦ but the most important emotion is the emotion of the shot for the filmâ. As this implies, it wasnât the truthful recreation of the past that Breillat was seeking, but the emotional truth of the given moment happening on screen: âIf I have emotion as a spectator, I donât care if it was my emotion when I was in this situation or not. Because, in fact, I cannot ever remember and understand what was my real emotion in this situationâ¦I am a director and my only thought is for my filmâ.\n\nABUSE OF WEAKNESS PREVIEWED AT THE BFI LONDON FILM FESTIVAL 2013\n\nROMANCE (1999) IS NOW OUT ON DVD FROM SECOND SIGHT FILMS\n\nAt this yearâs LONDON FILM FESTIVAL Alice Rohrwacher presents her Cannes-award-winning drama THE WONDERS. Sister Alba Rohrwacher, joins her as star of both THE WONDERS and HUNGRY HEARTS, that won her Best Actress at Venice Film Festival. Other Venice winners, Directors Saverio Costanzo (HUNGRY HEARTS) and Ivano De Matteo (THE DINNER) will also grace the Red Carpet for the festival.\n\nLEOPARDI (Il Giovane Favoloso) by Mario Martone\n\nMario Martone (Amore Molesto) takes on the crippled 18th Century literarary genius, Giacome Leopardi, in this ambitious but rather worthy biopic. Sumptuously set in the verdant countryside of Tuscany and The Marche it stars Elio Germano (A Magnificent Haunting) as the lonely poet and child prodigy who struggles to break into fashionable circles despite a disciplinarian father and poor health. Leopardi did not score heavily on the romantic front, unlike Lord Byron, who, despite his club foot, enjoyed a great deal of erotic attention from the opposite sex; Ippolita di Majoâs screenplay dabbles with some of his female fantasies in the shape of a young illiterate girl who dies early on and a ravishing Florentine countess, played superbly by Anna Mouglalis who lights up this otherwise rather dry biopic with her charm and elegance. Sadly she falls for his more good-looking and glamorous friend Antonio Ranieri (Michele Rondino). The only aborted action he has between the sheets is with a Naples prostitute, but this episode ends cruelly in humiliation. As the drama progresses to Rome and Naples, it opens out visually with some magnificent landscapes of southern Italy and further opportunities to discover Leopardiâs moving poetry and learn about his ideas as a philosopher. This is an ambitious and watchable film and Elio Germano gives a strong and convincing performance as a tortured artist wracked with pain and mental anguish who was wiser of the human condition than his elders gave him credit for: âPeople are ridiculous only when they try or seem to be that which they are notâ.\n\nBLACK SOULS (Anime Nere) by Francesco Munzi\n\nDubbed as the new Gomorrah in some circles, Francesco Munziâs mafia family drama purrs with tension, taking the brutal Mafioso world to the rustic villages of the Calabrian foothills at the southern tip of Italy. This is the heartland of the ândrangheta, the biggest and furthest-reaching mafia group in Italy, far stronger than the Comorrah and the Sicilian mafia, but more secretive and rarely infiltrated by outsiders. Itâs because the group is made up of family units that the ândrangheta are so tight, but it also means that entrance to the group for descendants is tacitly obligatory. If you donât want âinâ, youâre asking for trouble. Thatâs the case with Luciano (Fabrizio Ferracane), a farmer whose brothers are long-standing members of the Carbone clan; he instead tends to his farmland of goats on the slopes of the Apennine Mountains. His son Leo (Giuseppe Fumo), however, is eager to join a group where heâll gain respect, and in an age where Italian youngsters are frequently downtrodden by unemployment, this is something he is eager to commit to. His uncle Luigi (Marco Leonardi), a drug dealer who travels Europe, takes Leo under his wing, but after an altercation between Leo and a rival clan, events spiral to take the apparently peaceful town to gang war.\n\nThis is a slower, more composed film than Gomorrah, and doesnât have that filmâs electric socio-political edge. Instead, it works as a family drama that simmers with personal tragedy and works up to a powerful, gripping finale. Sumptuously filmed in the village of Africo, often said to be the home of the ândrangheta, and with the peninsulaâs craggy dialect, it convinces as a place where the state, the police, and perhaps conventional morality have trouble accessing. Among a cast of non-actors and professionals, Fumo, plucked from hundreds of local kids, is remarkable in his debut role as Leo, saying little but carrying a primordial terror with every retort at his disillusioned father. Munziâs script, co-written with Fabrizio Ruggirello, starts the film in Amsterdam and Milan, and perhaps could have done with setting the film more tightly in the insular ândrangheta communities. Here it feels like thereâs no escape, where every aspect of life is dominated by the mafia. The organisation helps local politicians gain election, bars and shops have to obtain âprotectionâ by one of the clans, and respect to members is non-negotiable. But that blinkered view of the world is also this familyâs downfall, as the cracks in the foundations make the whole house fall down.\n\nTHE WONDERS (Le Meraviglie) by Alice Rohrwacher â GRAND PRIX, CANNES 2014\n\nThe follow up to her acclaimed debut Corpo Celeste, The Wonders, 33-year-old Alice Rohrwacher, won the Grand Prix at Cannes this year. Set in her native Italy, the film explores the impact of a stranger upon a dysfunctionally hermetic family living in the Umbrian countryside where they cultivate delicious wild honey from their native bees. As with Corpo Celeste, the film focuses on a young girlâs coming of age. This delicate and gently tragic coming of age tale is told with tenderness and respect to the traditions of a country where communities still live from the land, threatened by the ever-increasing presence of âHeath and Safetyâ. A magical narrative with some touching performances from Alba Rohrwacher and a star turn from Monica Bellucci.\n\nHUNGRY HEARTS by Saverio Costanzo\n\nBEST ACTRESS AND BEST ACTOR, VENICE 2014\n\nSeverio Costanzoâs Venice âBest Actor and Actressâ winner, Jude (Adam Driver) and Mina (Alba Rohrwacher) proved divisive amongst criticsâ circles. Itâs a weird and quirky drama thatâs not quite a thriller but feels it ought to be. It centres on a couple who remain cloistered in their apartment after the birth of the baby boy. Mina, who has been anorexic during the pregnancy, is also germo-phobic and does not want to leave, or take the baby outside. Well cast in the role, Rohrwacher, makes for a subtely unhinged Mina while American, Adam Driverâs, feels somewhat out of place as Jude. With the help of a social worker, he more or less kidnaps his son, who goes to live with his mother (Maxwell) in the countryside outside New York. But Mina does not give up, she tries to regain custody of her son, and after Jude hits her, she manages to regain custody. The desperate grandmother can only think of a very radical solution. Half way through the film, the fish-eye lense is introduced, turning the narrative even more into a real life horror story. Mina is a frail and emaciated creature, just skin and bones, a fanatical gleam in her eyes. Jude is geeky and ambivalent â for much of the film, he tries to mediate between Mina and reality. His mother is made of much sterner stuff, and does not fall for Minaâs passive-aggressive schemes. However harsh the denouement appears, itâs clear that somebody had to make a stand â and Jude was much too feeble to be this person. Despite a weak script with gaping potholes, the superb cast handle the action masterfully. Not a film for the faint-hearted, but a convincing story of ordinary madness\n\nTHE DINNER (I Nostri Ragazzi) by Ivano De Matteo,\n\nAnother Venice Film Festival Winner, THE DINNER is very much a family-focused drama. Two brothers, Massimo (Gassman), a doctor and Paolo (Cascio), a glib lawyer, meet regularly with their wives, whilst their teenage children Benedetta and Michele go to parties together. The adults actually despise each other: Massimo is self-congratulatory, looking down on his more down-to-earth brother and trying to bend the law in favour of his clients. No love is lost between the women either: Massimoâs wife Clara (Mezzogiorno), a practical hands-on woman, finds the fashion-conscious Sofia (Bobulova) rather trivial, despite her responsibility for Benedetta, whose mother died very young.\n\nBut of the blue, the parents find out that their kids have killed a homeless woman, apparently just for fun. All but Paolo, want to cover up the crime so as not to destroy their future. But when Paolo insists on handing the pair over to the police, Massimo reacts with violence. Ivano de Matteo delivers a moral, character-driven fable, with some unexpected twists. These are, by no means, the people we thought they were to begin with: Massimo starts out as the moral apostle, doing good in his profession, full of love for mankind (apart from his brother and his wife). Paolo is only interested in success, the means do not matter to him. But when it comes to the crunch, he is the only one to ask for justice â the other man wants to cover up for the children. Nowadays, over-protection of kids in the middle classes is the norm; parents buy (or cheat) to get their âmini-meâsâ a good place in life (this author being no exception); trying to resolve all problems for them; making them dependent on the older generation; often forgetting to teach responsibility and self-reliance. Sure, the outcome is not often so cruel as in this fictional case, but the root of Benedetta and Micheleâs coldness lies in their own upbringing. The cast is brilliant, the camera vividly tracks the protagonists in a concrete jungle, or in their work places. The adults seem always on the run; the teenagers indolent. A very gloomy but perceptive indictment on a social class who, on superficial appearances, seems to have everything.\n\nTHE LONDON FILM FESTIVAL RUNS FROM 9-19 OCTOBER 2014\n\nOn a cold, wet afternoon last October, Alex Barrett sat down with HÃ©lÃ¨ne Cattet and Bruno Forzani to discuss The Strange Colour of Your Bodyâs Tears, on the day of its UK premiere at the London Film Festival.\n\nAB: I was hoping we could begin with you describing The Strange Colour of Your Bodyâs Tears in your own words.\n\nBF: For us, itâs like a cinematic experience. We have written the script so that each time you see the movie, you discover new things. There are different layers. We were very influenced in the writing by Satoshi Kon, the Japanese director who made The Perfect Blue. He has [also] inspired blockbusters in America like Inception. You know, itâs a dreamlike narrative. So the film is, for the first or second viewing, a cinematic experience, like a rollercoaster of images and sound, something very visceral. And after the screening maybe there are some things in your head which you begin to construct and begin to link. And thatâs how you see it for the second, the third, or fourth time, each time seeing different things. And at the end maybe you will find all the keys. Itâs a bit like David Lynch movies, you know? The first time you see them, you are fascinated by them, you donât get it all but you have seen strong visions, strong visuals and sounds, and after maybe three or four viewings it becomes clear.\n\nAB: In The Strange Colour of Your Bodyâs Tears, and also in your first film Amer, there seems to be a real focus on eyes and on ears. I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about what those organs symbolise for you?\n\nBF: Ah, you have seen the ears? Most people see the eyes but not the ears.\n\nHC: They are the organs of perception, and in the movie you are in the perception of the character.\n\nBF: Amer and Strange Colour are not linear storytelling, but circular storytelling. There are lots of circular elements. Itâs all about point of view, because we want a lot of ambiguity. An image can say something more than the first look at it [tells you]. Itâs all the philosophy of giallo, in fact, and of Blowup, of Antonioni. Itâs all about eyes and point of view. We work a lot on close ups and we are very intimate. We try to enter in the intimacy of the character, so we have a lot of the eyes and ears soâ¦\n\nHC: But not only eyes or earsâ¦\n\nBF: Chins!\n\nHC: Everything. But the eye has a lot of meanings, because it can be voyeurism, it can tell about intrusion, the other lifeâ¦\n\nBF: Desire.\n\nHC: Yes. Each time you give it another meaning.\n\nAB: Itâs interesting that you say people pick up on the eyes but not the ears, because I think that your films are very auditory. They have a lot going on with the soundtrack, as well as with the visuals. I felt â and maybe this is what you were getting at â that by showing us these eyes and ears you were trying to say to the viewer âyou need to look and you need to listenâ. And by using the close ups, you fracture the screen space, meaning that the viewer has to work harder to piece things together. Would you agree with that?\n\nBF: Yes.\n\nAB: Would you like to comment further?\n\nBF: Personally, I love the close ups because it breaks the space. And you can introduce that dreamlike atmosphere because the space is totally exploded. And you explore the body as architecture. When you are in close up itâs like the body is very giant and itâs like the gigantism of the houses we shoot in.\n\nHC: Yeah, with the close ups, we want the audience to feel the madness of the character. The close ups erase the space around him.\n\nBF: You donât have anything to hold onto. And as the film is about loss, about someone who is losing his mind, we want the audience to be lost. So the close up approach is a good one I think.\n\nAB: I think that the use of giallo aesthetic has been discussed a lot within your work, but Iâve read that for your very first short film, it was Bruno who brought in the giallo aesthetic, and that HÃ©lÃ¨ne came in with the aesthetic of Chris Marker. I was hoping you could talk about this a little bit, and Iâm particularly interested to hear you talk about the influence of Chris Marker on your work.\n\nHC: When we began to make short movies we had no money, but we wanted the texture of 35mm grain. So we shot in still frames, like La jetÃ©e. It inspired us to have narration and to have a special effect with no money.\n\nBF: And with that element of the photography, we talk about the body as an object of desire. It permits us to refine the body, to make it an object.\n\nAB: I think the pixilation reminded me more of Jan Svankmajer, and I was wondering what kind of influence surrealism has had on your work? Thereâs an image towards the end of Amer, a close up of Marie Bosâ eyes and the sweat on her face, which reminded me of a Man Ray photograph. So I was interested in whether surrealism, and people like Jan Svankmajer â and actually, also the avant-garde and people like Kenneth Anger and Maya Deren â whether these people are influences, or whether these are just things Iâm reading into your work which isnât intentional?\n\nBF: We try to work a lot with our subconscious, so the surrealism comes easier. In Belgium there is a big tradition of surrealism. You have Magritte, and we have some early twenties movies, early surrealists. And we try to go back to this culture, which has a little bit disappeared because the Belgium cinema is very realistic. For Amer, there was some stuff from BuÃ±uel, not the eye but the hands that come out from the belly. We love it when you donât know if itâs a dream or reality. And, it was on purpose to take the surreal approach. Kenneth Anger is more [an influence] on the style and the aesthetic, the form. And the fetishistic approach to certain stuff, like in the detectiveâs little story about the button [in Strange Colour], you have all the texture of the dress, which reminds me of one of Angerâs shorts [Puce Moment], which focused on the texture of the dress of a Hollywood actress. For Maya Deren, itâs more the dreamlike universe, like in Meshes of the Afternoon which is like a dream. Someone in a loop, you know?\n\nAB: Which reminded me very much of the loop sequence in The Strange Colour of Your Bodyâs Tears.\n\nHC: Yes.\n\nAB: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the way your directing relationship works? Often people who work in duos say that one works with the visuals and one works with the actors. But I was wondering about how you two do it?\n\nHC: When we are writing itâs just like tennis. I make a version, he corrects it and gives me another version, which I correct. Then, when we are preparing the movie, we are discussing and fighting a lot, trying to agree on everything. Because itâs the time to get on the same wavelength. So then, when we are on the set, normally we are okay. We donât lose time and we donât fight in front of the crew. The more difficult part is the preparation and the writing.\n\nBF: And the end of the movie, when we have to finalise the sound and the editing, because itâs very subjective, itâs very sensual. And we are very different. Itâs like colours. Maybe she prefers blue and I prefer red. And we have to find a balance between our two subjectivities to do something very subjective.\n\nHC: But on the set we are making everything together.\n\nAB: I read that for Amer you filmed everything first on a digital camera, with you two playing all the parts. Did you do the same for The Strange Colour of Your Bodyâs Tears?\n\nHC: Yes.\n\nAB: So could you maybe talk to me a little about that process? Do you edit that material? Are you making the whole film in digital? How does that process work for you two?\n\nBF: In fact, for this one we didnât have the time to do it all. There are two storyboards. The first one is before we have seen the real locations, so we do an abstract storyboard in our head. And for some sequences itâs easy because itâs on a bed or something like that, so itâs no problem. And after, when we discover the locations and we choose which house weâre going to shoot in, we redo all the storyboards. Because we have seven houses to make one house we do all the editing to see if it all fits, if all the different locations fit together. So we have all the editing ready. And after [the shoot], when we arrive at the editing we review that map, if you want. So the biggest parts [of the edit] are to choose the good shots of the actors, and the rhythm.\n\nAB: Iâve always wondered if shooting a digital test version first takes the fun out of the shoot, because youâve thought it through so much in advance. Have you found this? I mean, when you come to the set are you just repeating what youâve already done, or is it still an organic process?\n\nHC: Itâs impossible to repeat the same thing, because itâs really a rough draft. Itâs only the two of us. Itâs ridiculous. Totally. [Laughs]. But when you do that youâre more prepared if there is something which happens. And you can improve the shot, because you know what you want. Maybe you can have another idea with the light, with the actor, and youâre not stressed â itâs okay, because you know what you want really precisely.\n\nBF: We shoot a lot. But we use it all in the editing. And as we have a lot of shots, we have to be very prepared because we do more shots than the normal film. We have been for The Strange Colourâ¦ in houses, or in various locations, which are very labyrinthine. They are so big that you canât know in a minute what you are going to shoot, because itâs so intense. So we spend three days in the location watching all the points of view and thinking what would be the best for the storytelling for the movie, and how we are going to shoot? We wonât have the time to do that on the set because we have to be very fast.\n\nHC: Yeah, to shoot in that kind of location, itâs not sensible to come in and improvise.\n\nBF: Itâs expensive to shoot in houses like that, so you have toâ¦ you have eight hours and you have to do 45 shots, so you have to be like an army [laughs].\n\nAB: Before you made Amer, you trained by making a number of shorts. I read on the DVD of Amer that in 2004 you went off to Madagascar to make a very different type of film, which then fell apart for reasons beyond your control. I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about that project, and speculate on whether, if that film had been finished, the films youâve made since might have been very different?\n\nBF: Well, we went to Madagascar and it was just after ourâ¦We had made four shorts in a universe like Amer and Colour, and we wanted to do something different: more sensual, more about time. We love Abbas Kiarostami, and [we wanted to do] something totally different. In Madagascar there was a specialâ¦ the time was very special. It was very long and not like when you live in the city, where you are really stressed. The people who work are waiting a lot and it was about a driver, about a guy who was working as a chauffeur, who was always waiting waiting waiting. It was shot on the still frame, black and white. And we began the two day shoot, and there had been like a storm or something like that\n\nHC: There was a cycloneâ¦\n\nBF: A cyclone which sucked away all the location we were supposed to shoot, so it was like carnage, chaos. And the guy who was acting in it left, and we never saw him again. And so maybe it could have been a turn in what we have done now. But yes, it was something totally different. But just after that we made a short film, called Santos Palace, and it was more in that [giallo] mood.\n\nAB: And do you think your next film will be giallo, or something different?\n\nBF: We have a third part for Amer and Colour, but we donât think weâre going to do that now. We have to wait, take a breath, because it was eleven years that film, so itâs been a big part of our lives, so we have to take a breath. And at the end our collaboration was like Possession, you know, Zulawski? [Laughs] So we have to reconnect artistically on something that doesnât come from us, and after weâll go back to that giallo universe.\n\nAB: Thank you very much.\n\nBF: Youâre welcome.\n\nTHE STRANGE COLOUR OF YOUR BODYâS TEARS IS ON GENERAL RELEASE FROM 11 APRIL 2014\n\nDirector Andrey Gryazev is the filmmaker behind the underground hit Tomorrow, charting the ideology and activity of the Russian movement and phenomenon known simply as âVoinaâ (War). The film competed for The Sutherland Prize at London Film Festival 2012 and Andrew Rajan met him to talk about this ground-breaking first feature.\n\nAT: Did you hear about the recent defacing of Rothkoâs painting âSeagramâ at the Tate Modern by Russian Vladimir Umanets? What is your take on it?\n\nAG Yes. Itâs not art, it is terrorism. It doesnât offer anything but destruction. There is no art behind it.\n\nAT: What films do you aspire to make, in an ideal world?\n\nAG One of the last films I saw, but I donât see many as I am so busy, but I really liked Four Months, Three Weeks, Two Days.\n\nAT: I liked this film very much; it is very darkâ¦\n\nAG It is truthful. I like directors that come from a documentary background. They know what to film: not something made up, but something taken from real life. I donât like fake. Documentary makers see the real issues that have arisen, not something thatâs just made up. Some events in real life happen very quickly and documentary makers are able to remember these and recreate these moments, whilst still adding their own sensibilities to it.\n\nAT: What drew you to make this film- do you sympathise with the Voina movement?\n\nAG I just took it as it was. I didnât judge it one way or the other as I was making it. My inner evaluation of the whole issue only came after I had filmed it. I re-lived all that had happened later, as an outside observer, as a neutral, in the edit suite.\n\nBefore making this film I have made short and medium length documentary films. They had very acute social issues- to all of them. They also had one character, the Government as a common theme. So in my next film, I wanted to find characters other than the Government, who would still be equal in depth and be able to have a conversation with the Governmentâ¦ So these new characters (in Tomorrow) have their own opinions, which I cannot affect or edit, as they are valid for these people. I cannot deny the fact that they have these feelings; that they act in the way that they do.\n\nI cannot criticise them one way or the other, they have their right to make a statement, one way or the other. I didnât have to be so much a director when capturing the shots, more just an activist, I cannot reshape the performances as they happen, as that would no longer be honest documenting, but when it came to the edit, then I wear the directors hatâ¦ and be a filmmaker.\n\nAT: Since you started filming them, presumably, you have raised their profile worldwide; how much of an impact do you feel your work has had?\n\nAG The performances that is depicted in the film, when they overturned the Police car, it was on the internet and on all the TV channels and in the film as well. It was everywhere. That has been my impact on their developmentâ¦\n\nWith the international development, I was only involved in the videoing, but there is someone else doing the written work that accompanies the captions for the YouTube videos. But I was responsible for the caption âif you help the child, you help the countryâ.\n\nI also came up with the concept of the childâs ball under the car, which made it a news item, rather than purely an act of criminality. For me, it was interesting to put it forward in a narrative way. All the video in the film and on the Internet was primarily shot for this film though, not the other way round.\n\nAT To make this film, it needed to be a symbiotic relationshipâ¦\n\nAG It was indeed very much a symbiotic relationship, as you sayâ¦ I was doing my own indie film, without showing what had been captured, or what I had been up to.\n\nBut they were in turn getting everything they needed from my footage; so, I would do their EPK (Electronic Press Kit), their trailer, so that they could put that up on the Internet, for their publicity purposes. In turn, I was able to use everything and anything I filmed, for Tomorrow.\n\nAT Before you turned up, was there any footage of the Voina movement?\n\nAG They had a documentary maker of their own; temp workers, but it was so hard to find them. They were really afraid to shoot anything serious and anything they did film was poorly lit, shot on bad cameras and they even sometimes forgot to press record! [Laughter]\n\nSoâ¦ what is next for Voina?\n\nAG Their next step is clearly depicted in the filmâ¦ the highest radicalism possible. The dead-end of terrorism, of extremismâ¦ a very dead end. Actually, it is not possible to do anythingâ¦ after I stopped filming themâ¦ it is not really possible to do anything- further. As an example, they set fire to a huge Police Prisoner Transporter, so if you follow that analogy through, the next thing will be to blow something up, but right now they are not doing anything.\n\nBecause in todayâs society, things are very changed, things are happening in a completely different way. You donât have the same boundaries as existed when I made this film, you have to come out and appeal to the simple people out there andâ¦ appeal to them in a language that they understand in order to create change.\n\nAT: Are Voina happy with how the film has been received?\n\nBefore the film started screening in the festivals, I taped Voina watching the film and their reaction to the film. They liked the film and they laughed in the same places as any public audience.\n\nHowever, they fight against everythingâ¦ that is who they are, so itâs not to their advantage to be seen to be talking about the film in a positive way; the film destroys their myth.For this reason, they are acting against the film and they are also suing the President of the Berlin Film Festival; Voina decided they want to forbid the film being shown.\n\nAT Because of the profits? They donât want the film to be making a profit?\n\nAG Noâ¦ at first they started saying they have never seen it, that they didnât know it was being made, then that they didnât know the director. Then, that all the archive footage belonged to them and I had stolen itâ¦ that it was their own personal video footage.\n\nAT Fantastic. Because it was criminal?\n\nAG No. There is nothing criminal in the film; to prove it has actually happened.\n\nI mean, anyone investigating has to come to me first, as I own the copyright and ask if it indeed actually happened, but no one has come to me. The Police. No one.\n\nAT So why are they distancing themselves from the film?\n\nAG That is their own PR, their own publicity.\n\nAnd some journalists have asked, âhonestly, is that your own combined PR trick, that you came up with together?â Because itâs so perfect, it must have been made up.\n\nBut as the owner of all copyright, in order to forbid the film, they only need to ask me, to sue me, but they havenât- only the Berlinale President. And against me, they would lose in court and be left with nothing. And this is why it is in their advantage to sue the Berlinale President, but in this entire past year, they have never written to me asking me not to show it.\n\nAT Andrey, what is next for you?\n\nAG I am now working on a narrative script, which is based on a documentary. But with the kind of topic I have in mind, I know I will never find the funding I need in Russia, this is why I am now preoccupied in finding other, new sources of finance. So, Roskino which is supporting the film here unofficiallyâ¦ they are helping him to find finance.\n\nAT. I liked Tomorrow. I felt it to be one of the most important films in the festival.\n\nAG. Thank you. I am always interested in the audience response to it. I wanted to make this film in a way, where they judge the people, before they know what they are doing. And then the story reveals itself.\n\nAT I think it has been extremely successful at doing just that. Andrey, itâs been a pleasure, thank you very much.\n\nAG Thank you very much."
