It’s from Aleksandr Sokurov’s Francofonia (see page 16): footage of a container ship caught in a terrifying storm, smashing its way through huge waves that strip it of some of its load. The film’s fictional conceit is that these elongated metal boxes all contain great art. Sokurov uses the notion to remind us that much of the art in Europe’s great museums is imperial plunder, and that rare objects often didn’t survive being filched and sent from far-flung places back to Paris, London, Lisbon, Vienna, Madrid, Berlin or Moscow. His film is a meditation on the Louvre and how its great works survived the Nazi invasion in 1940 and the occupation that lasted until 1944. Much of the art was stashed away by the French in chateaus across the country. At one moment Sokurov says - and I don’t know if he’s being glib, ironic, truthful to his feelings or merely calculating numbers - that the art in the Louvre is “worth more than all of France”. Perhaps he means, “If you can’t save the country, at least save the art.” With this potentially ruthless sentiment, Sokurov seems to have one eye on the destruction being wrought on great archeological sites by Isis. If so, that was the only reference I came across in the whole festival to any aspect of the crisis resulting from the war in Syria. Michael Moore’s documentary Where to Invade Next, for instance (see our ‘First Look’ review online), must have been made too soon to include the hundreds of thousands of desperate people who have decided to come to the same Germany that Moore eulogises as one of the nations he regards as having great social welfare ideas. When it comes to political realities, cinema is always slow to react. The preservation of art seems to be as much a Zeitgeist issue as the preservation of people. The late Michael Jacobs’s unfinished but recently published final book Everything Is Happening: Journey into a Painting -about Velazquez’s great work Las meninas - recalls the time during the Spanish civil war when much of the Prado’s collection was removed from Madrid to Geneva by the Republican government. We’ve seen such films as George Clooney’s The Monuments Men, about a team of art experts tasked with tracking down works looted by the Nazis, and Volker Schlondorff ’s Diplomacy, in which the German military governor of Paris is persuaded The routes now being sailed and trodden by refugees are the same routes much of the imperial plunder from wars travelled to reach the great museums in the West to go against Hitler’s orders by refusing to destroy great public monuments such as the Eiffel Tower. It is, of course, salutary to be reminded that great art is perishable. In another article in this issue (see page 46) - apropos the BFI Southbank season ‘Mirroring Tarkovsky’ - I’ve looked at Tarkovsky and Sokurov’s uses of high art as inspiration. The Russian filmmakers have a particular reverence for classical figurative works. One of the questions that immediately came up when the season was announced was whether we’d be screening the Tarkovskys on 3 5 mm. In fact we’re hoping to show brand new digital prints. It’s understandable that those who want the best experience of Tarkovsky remain loyal to 3 5mm, but it’s become increasingly difficult to satisfy that desire. It’s an illustration that film, though more portable and more easily duplicated than great paintings, is vulnerable none the less. But to return to Francofonia and the consequences of the war in Syria, in one scene we see Gericault’s great masterpiece The Raft of the Medusa propped up against the wall in a corridor of the chateau where it was hidden - it is probably the most famous image in great art which allows us to imagine the terror of refugees crossing the Mediterranean. Sokurov’s container ship is also an irresistible reminder of people risking their lives at sea. The director doesn’t say as much but the routes now being sailed and trodden by refugees are the same routes much of the imperial plunder from wars travelled to reach the great museums in the West. The challenge for cinema - arguably a more democratic artform than great paintings - is to come up with works that might help to illuminate what’s happening. Sokurov’s Francofonia, whatever its preference for art over people, is a nudge in the right direction. © November 2015 | Sight&Sound | 5 Rushes NEWS AND VIEWS IN THE FRAME POSTER BOY Scenes of the crimes: Graham Humphreys’s poster for Dario Argento’s Inferno (1980) Graham Humphreys’s painterly, retro posters have been making horror fans shudder, in a good way, for more than 30 years By Jane Giles The names of film poster artists are little known beyond the fan circuits, yet their work has often dominated film marketing and the way audiences approach movies. In the UK several decades of cinema-going were defined by the posters of Tom Chantrell - including those for Hammer, Carry On... and Star Wars. But as the author Christopher Fowler has described, the work of illustrators was not valued by the British film industry: “Hundreds of pieces of original art, including elaborate dioramas and poster-paint masterpieces created for the Rank Film Organisation in the 1950S, 1960s and 1970S, were broken up and tossed into rubbish bins. Typically, they were seen as ephemeral and worthless. The underpaid and undervalued UK artists who utilised the UK’s unique quad shape did not own their own work, and were rarely able to keep copies.” Born in i960, Graham Humphreys was starting out just as the British masters of illustrated film poster art were beginning to retire. He grew up drawing Daleks on the wall with crayons, and studied graphic design and illustration at Salisbury College of Art from 1976 - the birth of punk was a formative experience, as was the arrival of psychobilly a few years later. Humphreys’s work was always intensely cinematic, his pigments recalling 1950s Eastman filmstock and the lighting of Hammer films, his cultural outlook rooted in Frankenstein (1931), Dracula (1931) and the other Universal creature features of the 1930s, movies shown late on BBC 2 and the lurid covers of Pan horror novels. Young, talented and cheap, Humphreys was taken on by the film and video distributor Palace Pictures, which specialised in crossing over cult and arthouse films into the mainstream, exploiting genre titles and cornering the burgeoning VHS home entertainment market. He designed and illustrated many Palace campaigns, most influentially The Evil Dead (1984) and A Nightmare on Elm StreetiigSi). The Evil Dead landed in rental stores just as the Video ON OUR RADAR Home Movie Day Rediscover your forgotten memories on 17 October - International Home Movie Day - a worldwide celebration of amateur film which helps people project and preserve their old home movies. London Home Movie Day takes place later, on 7 November at Kennington’s Cinema Museum, with screenings throughout the day and archivists on hand to give feedback and advice. Africa in Motion ‘Sembene!’, a portrait of legendary Sengalese director Ousmane Sembene (right), is just one highlight of this celebration of African cinema new and old across Edinburgh and Glasgow (23 October - 1 November). Also of note is Rwandan director Kivu Ruhorahoza’s experimental feature Things of the Aimless Wanderer’ charting Africa’s relationship with the West. 6 I Sight&Sound November 2015 LISTOMANIA THE GAMBLERS Zombie history: Sam Raimi’s The Evil Dead (1982) Recordings Act of 1 984 - which brought in a new classification scheme to combat the supposed threat of video nasties - played havoc with the distribution of horror movies. Humphreys’s thrilling cover artwork, with its acid-trip colours and zombie faces, became emblematic of moral panic and rebellion. The Evil Dead poster is Humphreys’s Citizen Kane, an early great work that hit the Zeitgeist and defined his career. Humphreys’s early work was completely hand- painted; he still uses gouache on paper, though now supplemented with a computer. Some digital illustrators add layers of texture to create the illusion of physical paint, but Humphreys retains any unplanned and spontaneous marks, plus the raw textures of brush on paper. “It’s illustration but delivered using modem technology,” he says. “All final art is scanned and only tweaked digitally in order to enhance or retouch, while retaining the integrity of the original painting.” After Palace, Humphreys became house designer for Tartan Films, creating visual identities for titles such as Miike Takashi’s Audition (1999), Rob Zombie’s House of 1000 Corpses (2003), Jodorowsky’s El Topo (1970) and the Ramones doc End of the Century (2003). He remains the go-to guy for grindhouse and horror posters, rivalled in the UK only by fellow illustrator Tom Hodge, aka The Dude Designs. But Humphreys has also designed across a huge range of genres and titles, including Mike Leigh’s Life Is Sweet and the BFI’s Children’s Film Foundation DVDs, as well as creating storyboards, collectable products, brand identities (such as Hammer’s new logo), educational projects, private commissions and album covers, and working for the music press. A career-long association with the design agency The Creative Partnership continues, but he remains thoroughly freelance. This month, an exhibition at the Proud Camden gallery in London will feature a selection of original artworks by Humphreys, from 1981 to the present, including his posters for The Evil Dead, A Nightmare on Elm Street and What We Do in the Shadows, as well as the one he created for the Flicker Club’s season of horror films Hammer at the Vault Film marketing is generally hyperbolic, airbmshing a film’s flaws to cover a lack of budget and hard-sell the product. But Humphreys’s work is characterised as much by sincerity and absence of cynicism as by enthusiasm, reverence and humour. And if the film turns out to be not so great it doesn’t matter too much - his artwork is worth the price of the ticket or DVD by itself. © © ‘Drawing Blood: the film poster art of Graham Humphreys’ is at Proud Camden, London, from 29 October - 22 November Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck’s Mississippi Grind stands in a long tradition of movies about gamblers addicted to cards and shooting dice I Bob leflambeur(1956) Jean-Pierre Melville 2 The Cincinnati Kid (1965) Norman Jewison 3 5 Card Stud (1968) Henry Hathaway 4 The Sting (1973) George Roy Hill 5 California Split (1974) Robert Altman 6 The Gambler (1974, below) Karel Reisz 7 Atlantic City (1980) Louis Malle 8 9 10 QUOTE OF THE MONTH CHANTALAKERMAN God of Gamblers (1989) Wong Jing Hard Eight (1996) Paul Thomas Anderson Rounders (1998) John Dahl ‘When you try to show reality in cinema, most of the time it’s totally false.

November 2015 | Sight&Sound | 7 RUSHES OBJECT LESSON WHERE’S THE BEEF? Irony maiden: Ellen Page with her hamburger phone in Juno (2007) The hamburger phone in Juno follows a tradition of ironic teen accoutrements in US indie comedy - but what’s all that irony hiding? By Hannah McGill Speech in Jason Reitman’s Juno {2007) serves distanciation as much as communication. The emotional complexity of what is happening to the characters (a baby is accidentally conceived in a first sexual encounter between two teenagers who love each other, but aren’t ready to be parents; abortion is considered and rejected; adoptive parents are found, and the pregnancy carried to term) is masked and evaded via endless slangy wisecracks. The visual metaphor the film offers for its remoulding of a flesh-and-blood ordeal as a spiky quipathon is the novelty hamburger-shaped telephone on which Juno calls her best friend Leah to tell her the news. Something gory (animal flesh) disguised as something less gory (a hamburger patty hidden in a bun), replicated in plastic and repurposed to serving another function entirely. “I am fo shizz up the spout,” Juno says into her hamburger phone. “Honest to blog?” squeaks Leah. “Phuket, Thailand!” Then she starts asking Juno which of two local abortion clinics, clearly familiar among their peer group, she intends to use. By overdubbing the pain and confusion of one in Juno’s situation with humour of a fashionably wordy and ironic type, Diablo Cody’s script makes safe the frightening prospect of unwanted pregnancy. Though Ellen Page’s lead performance clearly communicates that anxiety and doubt underlie Juno’s public performance of pert composure, the film pulls back each time authentic emotions surface in order to sub in a gag. When Juno does find herself lost for words, arranging an appointment at the Thora Birch, masked in Ghost World (2001) abortion clinic, she blames her telephone: “I’m on my hamburger phone - it’s just really awkward to talk on.” Awkwardness in Juno is evaded entirely, or sluiced away, with a sterile wash of smart talk, with the consequence that the film presents a world at once unconvincingly gentle and unconvincingly cruel. Even the anti- abortionist who startles Juno into cancelling her termination is cutesified: she chants the slogan, “All babies want to get horned!” and holds a sign stating, “No babies like murdering.” Something troubling (an anti-choice zealot) disguised as something less troubling (a sweet, verbally challenged schoolgirl), replicated in quirky comedic form and repurposed as a plot device... Winona Ryder, monocled in Heathers (1989) 8 I Sight&Sound November 2015 THF nVF KFY SOLO SURVIVAL DRAMAS Giving characters kooky accoutrements to emphasise their unease with social norms and expectations is, of course, normal and expected in the sort of indie comedies Juno carries in its DNA. The hearse driven by Harold in Harold and Maude (ig-ji), the monocle affected by Veronica in Heathers (1989), and Enid’s fetish mask in Ghost World(2ooi) are all precursors of the hamburger phone. It’s an object that shows us that Juno is unworldly enough to use a landline, and enough of a knowing, sarky oddball to make a point of embracing dated trash. Yet it also communicates a sense that, on some level, this girl is solid and traditional enough to appreciate the appeal of a blue-collar American icon like the classic hamburger. These co-existing meanings reflect the ambiguities of pop art, that elevation of the ordinary of which the hamburger phone is a mass-produced offshoot. A slightly baffled article in November 1964’s liFE magazine explored the fashion among pop artists for portraying foodstuffs: Claes Oldenburg’s burgers and ice-creams; Jasper Johns’s cans of beer; Robert Watts’s felt apples. “The great production belt of our greatest industry,” wrote Calvin Tomkins, “overwhelms us at every season with gorgeously- coloured, bigger-than-life-sized comestibles, and if the frozen-in flavor of wax beans sometimes turns out to be the flavor of wax, this is all part of the world’s highest standard of living. It is also part of the new American ‘reality’ that pop artists have Juno’ is a film about an intense experience that comes denuded of intensity, but maybe bloodlessness is the source of its poignancy chosen as their main subject - although they keep telling us that their work is not social comment.” Tomkins goes on to call Watts’s apples “neither an imitation, nor an imaginative reconstruction of the real thing”; they “exist in the no man’s land between art and life”, a diagnosis one might also apply to Juno. This is a film about an extraordinarily intense experience that comes denuded of intensity; a film about one of the most contentious political issues of its day which its own director boasted was “apolitical”; a film that rejects conventional Hollywood schmaltz only to find new ways for people to say things to one another that it’s impossible to imagine being said in real life. Perhaps, in the end, its very bloodlessness is the source of its indirect poignancy. Junds hamburger phone is a relic of the 80s revival of pop-inflected Americana: in other words, it’s an ironic appropriation of an ironic appropriation of an ironic appropriation. (The film writers who received promotional Juno hamburger phones upon the film’s release were at another remove again.) Juno’s generation is nostalgic for the relative frankness of a time in which a hamburger might have been celebrated as a delightful thing, not a symbol of industrial corruption, environmental abuses and calorific excess. In making Juno’s choice to have her baby adopted appear straightforward and bloodless, the film undertakes a similar rejection of tiresome old moral complexity. © On an island, in the desert, at sea or in space - the lone individual struggling to stay alive can make for gripping drama By Nick Pinkerton Matt Damon always seems to need a ride back home. He was the paratrooper brought back at great cost in Saving Private Ryan (1998), stranded on a barren planet in Interstellar (201 4), and now left behind on Mars in The Martian (reviewed on page 83). The idea of man alone pitted against his environment goes back at least as far as Robinson Crusoe(iyig); recent film examples include 127 Hours (2010), and All Is Lost and Gravity (both 2013), which respectively represent the out-to-sea and lost-in-space subgenres. (Gravity is an outlier, for it is mostly man against the environment - the female survivalist is the horror film’s ‘final girl’.) These survivalist standouts, however, keep their feet firmly on terra firma, with one eye open. 2 Robinson Crusoe (1953) The gold standard for adaptations of Defoe’s foundational survivalist text is a Mexican production with an Irish-American leading man (Daniel O’Herlihy) and a Spanish director - Luis Buhuel, a jolly blasphemer who inevitably gave a highly individual reading of the original Christian parable, his first experiment in colour photography lending the proceedings, per critic Ado Kyrou, “a Rousseau-like accent”. 4 Cast Away (2000) The survivalist narrative is too often an excuse for banal ‘visceral’ filmmaking, but Robert Zemeckis’s deeply Ml fin-de-millennium take on the Crusoe story explored the spiritual and physical toll of isolation. Zemeckis’s frank appeal to the emotions leaves him open to the scoffers, but Tom Hanks’s gut-emptying roar of separation-anxiety anguish when he loses his only ‘companion’ reverberates through the years. 1 Inferno (1953) Robert Ryan had greater endurance for punishment than almost any other actor of his day - see his four gut-bruising rounds boxing in The Set-Up (1949) if you doubt it - and it’s put to the test in Roy Ward Baker’s outdoor action film.Ryan plays a millionaire left for dead in the Mojave desert by his two-timing wife (Rhonda Fleming) and her lover after he breaks a leg falling from his horse. 3 The Naked Prey (1965) Originally set in the American West and based on explorer John Colter’s escape from a band of Blackfoot warriors. The Naked Prey pits the disconcertingly fit 53-year-old director-star Cornel Wilde against a tribal war party running him down on the African veldt - keeping things moving at a clip not equalled or bettered until Mel Gibson’s 138-minute Mayan-language dash Apocalypto (2006). 5 The Grey (2011) Unlike Richard Harris in Man in the Wilderness (i 97 1) or Robert Redford in Jeremiah Johnson (1972), Liam Neeson isn’t alone for most of Joe Carnahan’s film - he’s trying to keep a dwindling group of plane-crash survivors alive and ahead of a circling pack of Arctic wolves. But he’s alone come the end, facing off the wolves with knuckle-dusters made of broken bottles; that this isn’t the movie’s best scene says plenty.

The next frontier. Lana Wachowski. Eddie Redmayne realising he’s a woman in Tom Hooper’s The Danish Girl. Caitlyn J. and all that. A suffix becomes a noun. The next liberation movement. What about transitioning in film? In the forward to a forthcoming book, critic Dina lordanova says the reason she has taught and researched transnational cinema, as opposed to national cinema, for most of her life is that she had no choice. As a Bulgarian who’s spent time in many countries and who established the film studies course in St Andrews in Scotland, her life has been transnational. Bulgarians know a thing or two about regime change, about how empires swash and backwash across places; lordanova has written a lot about the Balkans, Europe’s most trans zone. Cinemas and frontiers. Cinema was very trans in the silent days. Chaplin’s face was perhaps the most trans image in the world in the 1920s. It defied borders. The fact that he was a gentleman and a tramp, a man and a kid, clumsy and elegant made him the essence of trans. He was always switching polarities. He was iridescent. Proof that there is a collective unconscious. Of course his image travelled, his fame travelled, because of the power of the industrial machine behind it. He was received everywhere, in part because Hollywood put him ever3Avhere. Eilm history hasn’t always been so fluid, so sharing. One of its failures is the fact that the great silent films of Ozu Yasujiro weren’t sent much outside Japan, for others to enjoy and be influenced by. Other countries didn’t discover his work until the 1950s. And cinema has continued to have a mixed trans record. A brilliantined film like Wong Kar Wai’s In the Moodfor Love {2000) can travel the world and somehow convince people in many different countries that it is evoking their own regrets, their own pasts, yet much of what has really travelled in sound cinema has been action film - Bruce Lee and Arnie - and Bollywood, films that feel about everywhere and nowhere. In comparison, comic cinema in the sound era has been national. In Britain, some of the best films - the Bill Douglas Trilogy, the Ealing comedies. Distant Voices, Still Lives, etc - have been very rooted in nation, yet the Powell and Pressburger films are trans (Emeric Pressburger was an emigr^ of course), and Nic Roeg’s work is too. Performance is a great film about transitioning - its advertising line was “Vice. And Versa” - and think of the identity fugues in Walkabout md Bad Timing. I’ve watched my own transitions. Greying hair. The happiness of youth tempered by bereavements. Narrow views expanded by travel. I’m not who I ever was. I look at Bernini’s sculpture of Apollo chasing Daphne, in which she is depicted in medias res, transforming into a laurel tree, and think, wowser, that’s me. Metamorphoses: maybe Ovid is the patron saint of our age. I think of the great films about ageing, and Boyhood is the Cinema was very trans in the silent days. Chaplin’s face was the most trans image in the world in the ig20s. It defied borders first to come to mind. But then I remember Jeff Preiss’s astonishing film STOP (2012), about his daughter. He filmed her for many years, during which she decided that she was a boy. We see a son emerge. It’s beautiful. Trans squared. And I’ve just seen Hanna Polak’s film Something Better to Come, about a girl who lives on a rubbish dump on the edge of Moscow. We meet Yula when she’s 10, and follow her for 1 3 years, in which Russia transitions, and Yula numbs her life with booze, and becomes a woman. And I think, too, of Jess Eranco’s weird cut of Orson Welles’s Don Quixote (1992), in which the actors change age from scene to scene, because the film was shot over so many years. Cinema is good at capturing trans. It’s good at caterpillars becoming butterflies. But it’s the opposite, too. By filming something, you stop it ch-ch-ch-changing. Shirley MacLaine doesn’t age in The Apartment, for example. James Dean is forever young. The celluloid decays but through the decay we glimpse the face of some half-forgotten silent bit-player. In Notes on the Death of Culture, a new collection of essays by Mario Vargas Llosa, the Peruvian Nobel prize-winner argues that images are not dependable because they are potent and fleeting. At their best they’re the former, but why do we think images are fleeting? The gorgeous 2nd- century BC paintings in Ajanta in India are still there, the opposite of fleeting. So is the Sphinx, Egypt’s Garbo. And then there’s the photo of Aylan Kurdi, lying face down, dead, on a Turkish beach. His father, Abdullah, was transitioning, from Syria to, he hoped, Canada. Instead, his wife and two sons died at sea, because they were making a perilous journey by boat, because our borders are semi-closed to people like them. Not only was that image dependable, it scythed through the noise of our times. An image of the failure of trans, the punishment for trying to trans. We’re not all transitioning. © November 2015 | Sight&Sound 1 11 The Industry BUSINESS NEWS & OPINION DEVELOPMENT TALE LISTEN TO ME MARLON A dangerous method: Listen to Me Marlon aspires to be a study of life, as well as a study of a remarkable life When the Brando estate opened up hundreds of hours of the actor’s private recordings, the filmmakers knew they had struck gold By Charles Gant Our image of Marlon Brando is of a private man, and his aversion to the limelight only increased with his son Christian’s manslaughter conviction in 1991 and his daughter Cheyenne’s suicide four years later. Screen appearances in the last two decades of his life were relatively scant. But as he hid away inside his sprawling Los Angeles mansion on Mulholland Drive, few suspected that he was engaged in an ambitious project of personal revelation. Listen to Me Marlon began three years ago with a conversation in Soho House in LA, between prolific documentary producer John Battsek and R.J. Cutler, best known as the director of The September Issue (loog). Battsek, who produced Oscar winners One Day in September (iggg) and Searching for Sugar Man (2012), suggested Brando as a subject. Cutler met with Mike Medavoy, former agent, former studio chief and veteran producer who is also co-executor of the Brando estate. Medavoy revealed that “there’s some archive,” says Battsek, “and R.J. started to have a look, but basically it didn’t go anywhere”. Eight months passed. Cutler went off to direct the fiction feature If I Stay (2014), and then Austin Wilkin, who oversees Brando’s archive, got in touch with Battsek. The pair had worked together on Ondi Timoner’s documentary We Live in Public (2009). At a meeting at the LA office of the Brando estate’s lawyers, Battsek was given the go-ahead to make the film: “You can have the keys to the cupboard,” he was told. Then he learned that the contents included hundreds of hours of audio recordings. Battsek says, “I am sure you can imagine, as a doc producer, whatever the subject, the magic words are: We have a treasure trove of movie footage that’s never been seen.’ Or, the next best. We’ve got hundreds of hours of audio recordings that the subject made that have never been heard.’ Immediately a light went off in my head: OK, that presents us with the possibility of something interesting.” Brando, it turns out, had been documenting his life for decades, making Dictaphone recordings of his thoughts and recollections. Initially made for therapeutic reasons or as a personal record, they later inspired the actor to propose turning them into a film. As he is heard saying in Listen to Me Marlon, “It will be a highly personalised documentary... on the life, activities of myself, Marlon Brando. We establish that he’s a troubled man, alone, beset with memories... in a state of confusion and sadness, isolation, disorder.” His death in 2004 ended any such plan. Returning to London, Battsek contacted Stevan Riley, with whom he’d made the 2010 doc Fire in Babylon (about West Indian cricket) and 201 2’s Everything or Nothing (about James Bond). “He’s a brilliant obsessive,” Battsek says. “When someone says we’ve got 300 hours of audio recordings, I knew I wanted someone who was going to listen to every minute of it. And the only person I’d worked with who I knew would listen to every minute of it is him.” Peter Ettedgui, who co- wrote Everything or Nothing with Riley, joined the production in the same creative role. Cutler, while remaining in Los Angeles, stayed as producer, and helped finance by bringing in the cable TV outlet Showtime. NBC Universal also came on board. The Brando archivists had a surprisingly relaxed attitude to the recordings, shipping them all off to Riley in the UK. The estate was also easygoing about the film’s creative direction. “Marlon said what was on his mind, he was not shy about anything,” Battsek says. “We had 12 I Sight&Sound | November 2015 carte blanche to use whatever we wanted.” The only concern was that Christian Brando’s 1990 slaying of his sister’s boyfriend, Dag Drollet, and the ensuing trial should not be the whole subject of the film. It probably didn’t hurt that, since Brando divorced three times and had numerous children, there was no single family member exerting full control over his legacy - the exact opposite of the Martin Luther King scenario, where for decades widow Coretta Scott King stood in the way of filmmakers trying to tell a rounded story about her husband’s life. Riley and Battsek both had the ambition to tell the story using just Brando’s voice, with no talking head interviews, and just archive clips. Consequently they faced a challenge not dissimilar to Asif Kapadia with his films Senna and Amy: what are the visual elements going to be? Riley’s first presentation of material to Battsek was certainly unusual. “It was 45 minutes of a black screen with the voice and subtitles on it, and three minutes of images,” the producer says. “It was literally just Marlon’s voice in a dead space. It was a long way off, but I’d sat there, fidgeted once, and I’d been gripped.” To give his film structure, and to provide a context for Brando’s dominant narration, Riley had an idea for a framing device. Battsek explains: “Marlon is in his house on Mulholland, he’s analysing himself, he’s casting an eye over the way he’s lived his life. He’s going through boxes, and listening to tapes and watching films.” Shooting in Brando’s actual house was Initially highly censorious of his own abusive father, Brando finally recognises that he is not so different after all out of the question, since next-door neighbour Jack Nicholson bought the expansive, mostly single-tier structure in 2005, and flattened it. A studio shoot provided the solution. To secure finance, Riley’s treatment proposed “an investigation into the myth of Marlon Brando”, presenting “a nuanced and vulnerable character” who “will question the burden of celebrity and the price of genius”. While that enquiry is present. Listen to Me Marlon finds its story arc more in terms of the actor’s relationship with his family. Initially highly censorious of his own abusive father, and defining himself in opposition to him, Brando is transformed by his own troubled experiences as a parent, and finally recognises that he is not so different after all. “He gets to that point of forgiveness of his father at the end,” Battsek comments. “Through the film, you are witnessing that journey That layer of the story, we wanted that to come through as strongly as it could, because that’s what we discovered when we listened to the tapes. It’s tragic and poignant, and also resonant - it’s varying degrees of all of our lives, and our relationships with our parents. Because he’s just a human being. His story, it’s a study of life, as well as a study of a remarkable life.” © O Listen to Me Marlon opens in UK cinemas on 23 October and is reviewed on page 81 THE NUMBERS LEGEND By Charles Gant Two years ago, when StudioCanal signed on to co-finance Working Title’s Legend and distribute the film in the UK, the company was excited by the idea of Tom Hardy’s dual performance as Ronnie and Reggie Kray. However, if it was looking for existing evidence that the actor could open a film in the UK, there wasn’t any. All of his box-office hits were in supporting roles (The Dark Knight Rises, Inception, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy) or with significant co-stars (Lawless, This Means War). At that time, his biggest hit where he had provided the primaiy cast element was 2011’s Warrior, which had grossed £1.9 million. As Legend's release date drew nearer, the Hardy box-office numbers didn’t get any better. The Drop, released in November last year, got to £1.7 million. Child 44, which followed in April, managed £1.4 million. It could be aig^ued, of course, that Hardy was a popular and much admired actor who just hadn’t found the right star vehicle yet. After all, Benedict Cumberbatch hadn’t successfully opened a movie until last year when his performance as Alan Turing in StudioCanal’s The Imitation Game helped push it to £16.4 million in the UK - proving that it’s the alchemical combination of actor and lead role that really resonates with audiences. For StudioCanal’s marketing boss Hugh Spearing, “The idea of Tom playing both Ron and Reg, plus his brilliance in pulling off the performances, is a really key driver in the success of the movie. A lot of people do recognise how great he is as an actor, and this is probably the best showcase you could have.’’ It didn’t hurt that in May Mad Max: Fury Road, while not wholly dependent on Hardy’s name for its success, finally gave the actor his first bona fide hit, raising his profile. StudioCanal was sanguine about Legend's 18 certificate, partly because the swearing made it an inevitability (“There was no way round it,” says Spearing), and also because The Wolf of Wall Street and Gone Girl both Two for the price of one: Tom Hardy in Legend steamed past £20 million here despite being 18s. However, there was still a concern that the film appeared too violent, which testing of marketing materials had revealed was a turn-off for all audience segments. Intriguingly, reveals Spearing, Legend tested best with older females, broadening the audience StudioCanal aimed at. “We wanted to find a balance between the two characters,” says Spearing. “Reggie being the suave gangster, and the love story that he has in the movie. And then the more volatile dark comedy and violence of the Ronnie character.” Diverse audiences were targeted with different TV spots focusing exclusively on one character, placed within male- and female-skewing shows. Legend opened in the UK with £5.2 million for its first five days of play, and stood at press time, after two weeks of release, with £10.7 million. Hardy ends the year with two £10 million UK hits in leading roles, having begun it with none. More than a decade after the ‘next big thing’ hype first started circulating, he’s finally reached the echelon of bankable leading male actors. © TOM HARDY AT THE UK BOX OFFICE Film Year Gross The Dark Knight Rises 2012 £56,257,144 Inception 2010 £35,804,867 Mad Max: Fury Road 2015 £17,393,994 Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy 2011 £14,207,244 Legend 2015 £10,731,304* RocknRolla 2008 £5,139,585 This Means War 2012 £5,091,537 Star Trek: Nemesis 2003 £4,776,885 Layer Cake 2004 £4,449,216 Lawless 2012 £4,266,925 * gross after 14 days on release November 2015 | Sight&Sound 1 13 THE INDUSTRY DEEP WATERS BFI FILM FUND INSIGHTS John Waters’s spectacularly unorthodox career offers a host of invaluable lessons for aspiring, struggling filmmakers ^miPk By Ben Roberts mT I’ve finally touched ^ the hem of my own personal Jesus... a three- minute conversation with John Waters after his interview at BFI Southbank in London last month, during the season dedicated to his 50-year career. We talked about Terence Davies, who I’d spent time with in Toronto for the premiere of his Sunset Song. Waters had picked The Deep Blue Sea for his Teabaggin’ in the Kitchen Sink’ mini-season of British films (“No one does misery like Terence!”), and they recently had tea together in London. He had also recently liked Andrew Haigh’s 45 Years, which reminded him of Bergman, “but I was hoping someone would vomit!” As I excused myself, he said how much he admired the UK’s public film funds, particularly as there is no such system in the US - “I can’t believe European directors are just given money to make films.” During the hour-long onstage interview, it was inspiring to revisit his rough, provocative comedy and take in his all-embracing worldview. The DIY approach of his early films and a later toe-dip into the mainstream offer some lessons for aspiring, struggling filmmakers. Here are my top five takeaways from my one- hour-and-three-minute audience with the pope of trash: Build your own Dreamland Waters didn’t go to film school, and never acquired formal skills (“technique is just failed style”). He told the audience that his first short films were so terrible because he didn’t understand what editing was: he just projected what he shot, in the order he shot it. He made his films with friends in his parents’ bedroom or on a stage in their backyard - this was his Dreamland Studios - blagging illegal camera hires from local teamsters. He wasn’t shooting for a low-budget aesthetic; in fact he wanted all of his films to look good, but style was born out of circumstance. He regards Serial Mom (1993) as his best film, in part because he finally had the budget and star to make the film the way he wanted, but he talked about his early resourcefulness with delight and no sense of hardship. Now that we all have high-resolution cameras and editing tools built into our phones, there’s really no excuse (and everyone should watch Sean Baker’s brilliant Tangerine for a great example of iPhone cinema). Have patience, or don’t care “No one liked my films for ten years!” Waters talks about challenges and challengers as delighifid experiences, not barriers. I could bottle his positivity IN PRODUCTION Living the dream: John Waters Perhaps it’s not surprising that it took him so long to emerge from the underground, or to receive his first good review. Nevertheless I got the strong impression that he would have been happy if he had neuer received a positive review for his work, as long as he was making films in the way he wanted to tell them with people he liked and admired. Even now, despite some mainstream success, the financing is hard to come by, but he’s happy to tell his stories on his terms through his writing - and at the BFI he teased a possible TV project. If you’re a storyteller, you’ll find a way to squeeze them out. Learn the business, and embrace it One of Waters’s most admirable traits is his industry savvy. He encourages all filmmakers to learn the film business inside out, so as to better stay in control. He borrowed money from friends and formed limited companies to make his early films, and retained the distribution rights on all his work until Polyester (igSi). As his stock rose, he accepted the conditions that came with finance (“the more money you get, the more you’ll have to listen”) and he seems to have relished his dalliance with Hollywood: the process of testing his films, run-ins with the censors and the opportunities it gave him to work with stars. He talks about challenges and challengers as delightful experiences, not barriers. I could bottle his positivity. Use the press Notoriety and press stunts were his biggest - and cheapest - asset. Throughout his career he has used the press, good or more often bad, to attract the attention of an audience for his films. And it’s undeniably impressive how successfully Waters has branded himself, consciously or otherwise. Watch everything Someone in the audience asked for filmmaking tips for their 1 2 -year-old son. He told them to “show him everything, good or bad, especially the bad”. A simple piece of advice, but frequently overlooked. We often say that the best and cheapest film school is a cinema membership and Netflix (and obviously a subscription to Sight & Sound). I know this might read like a love letter to John Waters - and his films are not to everyone’s taste, or tastelessness. But as a champion of the diverse and disruptive, and a filmmaker of integrity, resourcefulness and pragmatism, he’s a role model. © @bf iben # Isabelle Huppert is to star as a former Eurovision entrant, now working in a pate factory in Belgium, who stages a musical comeback, in Flemish director Bavo Defurne’s Souvenir.

The first accidental thread was Africa. I saw four worthwhile films in a row that were set there. First was Ben Rivers’s The Sh; Trembles and the Earth Is Afraid and the Two Eyes Are Not Brothers, which takes the idea of a director bossing Moroccan locals about to make an ethnographic film, then marries it to a Paul Bowles short story about a linguist (here substituted by the director) who is taken by bandits and turned into an exotic dancer dressed in a costume made of tin can lids. It’s a gorgeous work that lets the landscape fill gaps in the connective flow, but while in the first part the making of the film-within-the-film undercuts the exoticisation of the locals, the Bowles narrative that follows undoes that good work, offering images of a cruel, unknowable foreign culture. By contrast Cary Fukunaga’s Beasts of No Nation is a rare mid-budget war movie with an all-black cast. An unnamed West African nation is riven by civil war, and rebel armies recruit and brutalise child soldiers. Young Agu (Abraham Attah) finds himself orphaned by the regular army and given a join-or-die choice by the rebels. Their leader, the Commandant - Idris Elba on top menacing form - is a capricious, charismatic zealot whose vanity knows no more bounds than his cruelty. Convincing in its portrayal of random slaughter and the drive it puts behind its narrative. Beasts suffers only slightly from being a latecomer to the child-soldier issue, already well explored in Johnny Mad Dog (2008) and War Witch (2012). The tone of Joachim Lafosse’s subtle morality tale The White Knights -hdiS^d on the 2007 Zoe’s Ark scandal - is as radically different from Beasts as Beasts is from The Sky Trembles... A crisply dressed NGO team arrives at a mission facility in Chad which they hope to use to tend to war orphans. There’s tension from the start between the administrators, led by Jacques (Vincent Lindon), and the medical team, exacerbated by the presence of a sceptical journalist (Valerie Donzelli). Information is imparted reluctantly, leaving us to make up our own minds about the issues that unfold as we detect a potential duplicity behind the mission - just what do they want with these so-called orphans? Few films so deliberately tentative in approach have such revelatory power. Eva Husson’s Bang Gang (A Modem Love Story) is only tangentially African - its premise is that teenager Alex (Finnegan Oldfield) is given the run of his archeologist mother’s Biarritz house while she goes to Morocco, where its final scene takes place. Sexual yearnings between schoolfriends spill over into dare-fucking, instigated by Alex’s spurned one-night stand George (Marilyn Lima) - though it’s Alex’s reputation that gets enhanced when the orgies become a regular fixture. George attracts the shy, responsible Gabriel (Lorenzo Lefebvre), while Alex gets bored with the success he has playing off one girl against another; then viral video and other viral matters bring the fun to an end. There’s a touch of Larry Clark in the shock value of this feature debut, but it is as much about female sexual control as about male manipulation, and it’s full of sharp observations. The second string of connections was to do with my experience of Toronto. I was staying in a downtown tower full of upscale young singles who wouldn’t even make eye-contact with each other in the lift - in super-friendly Canada! So Ben Wheatley’s long-awaited adaptation of J.G. Ballard’s 1975 novel High-Rise, about a rapid descent into chaos and psychosis among the inhabitants of a modernist tower block, struck me as a future classic - by which I mean that its icy, forensic brilliance may not be quite in tune with the fuzzy contemporary mood of hope against hope one finds in the UK, but I’d bet it would work with my Toronto liftmates. Tom 16 I Sight&Sound | November 2015 Hiddleston lives imperiously on the edge as Dr Laing (a nod to the perenially hip psychiatrist R.D. Laing, author of The Divided Self), a newcomer welcomed by the upper and lower strata. Through him we witness the decadence of the penthouse crowd, which provokes an equal descent into primal urges among the lower orders who live further down the block, and whose kids storm the swimming pool during a private reception, precipitating a crisis of violence that proliferates beyond absurdity into the zone of gory mass satire. It’s a dazzling riot of a film. Toronto-style expertise in customer relations - “Are you good?” they ask at breakfast, as you’re blinking your way towards your first thought of the day - enhanced my viewing of Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson’s Anomalisa (see our Venice festival report, page 1 7), which ruthlessly mocks such corporate pleasantries and other industrial cant. Johnnie To’s workplace musical Office would also chime with the tower-block dwellers. As allergic to memorable melody as most modem musicals (I blame Les Miserables), Offices best attributes are William Chang’s stunning sets, its sense of propulsion and its committed performances (from Chow Yun-Fat and Sylvia Chang, among others) as we follow the ups and downs of corporate wrangling between a boss, his mistress, her lover and two bright young things. Of the films that impressed me outside of the two threads above, the most intellectually engaging was Aleksandr Sokurov’s Francofonia, a meditation on the fate of great art in times of danger. It begins with the director trying to contact the captain of a container ship, carrying great art, which is caught in a storm. These communications regularly intermpt the main narrative, about the Nazi invasion of Paris and the arrival at the Louvre of a German officer, an art lover made responsible for its treasures, who’s met by the museum director. Despite potential antipathy, the two conspire to keep the Louvre’s treasures out of the hands of the Nazi bigwigs. In the meantime we’re treated to gorgeous close- ups of some of the Louvre’s greatest paintings, while a pair of actors occasionally pop up as Napoleon and Marianne, the symbol of liberty, both of whom the film could have done without. The black sands and white cuboid houses of Lanzarote provide the backdrop for my favourite film at the festival, Lucile Hadzihalilovic’s Evolution, in which Nicolas (Max Brebant), diving for starfish, thinks he sees the corpse of another small boy. The village is seemingly inhabited only by young mothers, all wearing the same pale gold dress, each with a young lad to nurture. Nicolas’s mother (we assume) dives to prove there’s no drowned boy, returning only with the red starfish he sought. She feeds him bowls of worm-like noodles (or are they noodle-like worms?) and gives him dark-coloured medicine, but his curiosity is now aroused and he begins to uncover the bizarre nature of the sea-spawned species he’s either part of or possibly kidnapped by. The film is rigorously conceptual in its framework yet gloriously sensual and emotional in its execution. It’ll be in my top five of the year, for sure. In Chevalier, Athina Rachel Tsangari takes a full- on anthropological approach to the study of male competitiveness: six men on a boating trip start Beasts of No Nation Convincing in its portrayal of slaughter, ‘Beasts of No Nation’ suffers slightly from being a latecomer to the child-soldier issue out diving to catch fish but end up competing to settle who is the best at everything. The ensemble playing the nicely variegated bunch of solipsistic manhood are mostly on top deadpan form - although there are delicious moments of hysteria and neurosis. There are some very funny scenes involving assembling flat-pack furniture and lip- synching Minnie Riperton, but the film’s sharpest moments come when the men behave in ways usually considered stereotypically feminine. The momentum drops once the concept becomes too familiar and it’s not quite as original in feel TORONTO TOP TEN 1. Evolution Lucile Hadzihalilovic 2. The White Knights (below) Joachim La Fosse 3.

Films about psychopaths getting out of prison fill me with two kinds of dread: the fear of sudden gruesome violence and the greater fear that it will arrive in all too predictable a fashion. The set-up for Robin Front’s The Ardennes, however, feels less well-worn: while Kenny (Kevin Janssens) took the rap for a housebreaking that also involved his girlfriend Sylvie (Veerle Baetens) and brother Dave, the two of them have fallen in love and gone straight. The film’s style is close to early Nicolas Winding Refn. A harsh brutalism hovers over every scene, but there are some unexpected twists and its controlled cool mood builds in effectiveness. File under creditable debut. It would be hard to find a clearer example of a fine performance lost to a patchy film than Bom to Be Blue, the Chet Baker biopic that stars Ethan Hawke better than I’ve ever seen him. Hawke incarnates perfectly the ambivalent neurotic ‘cool’ that even Bruce Weber’s excellent Chet documentary Let’s Get Lost (igSS) found difficult to pin down. Writer-director Robert Budreau establishes several smart moves to destroy the by-the-numbers feeling most biopics give us. First, he makes it clear he’s not sticking to the facts; second, he takes a slice rather than the whole of the Baker life, focusing on his true-life struggle to regain his trumpet-player’s embouchure after thugs he owed money to kicked out his teeth. Unhappily there are too many instances of music video showboating in Californian locations and the dialogue is forced to explain what’s happening all the time. Hawke is also good in a more self-deprecating role as the man at the centre of Rebecca Miller’s cheering inverted love triangle comedy Maggie’s Plan. Big on New York charm, the film’s conceit is that student counsellor Maggie (Greta Gerwig), who can’t sustain relationships, plans to self- impregnate using an ex-school-chum’s sperm, but Hawke’s John, an unhappy academic, falls in love with her, despite or because of his marriage to the controlling Georgette (Julianne Moore, with a picture-stealing accent that leans toward the Germanic edge of Danish). Fast forward a couple of years and Maggie, despite the daughter she and John are raising, is scheming to get him back together with Georgette. The trio fire off each other magnificently but by the end I was worrying about my own commitment to Gerwig. I love her, I really do, but I need a break - or was it just that tower-block existence fraying my nerves? © November 2015 | Sight&Sound 1 17 FESTIVALS LIONS FOR LAMBS House of cards: Wojciech Mecwaldowski in Jerzy Skolimowski’s audience-tickling, critic-alienating ii Minutes This year’s Venice Film Festival had its bland moments - but it was certainly better than the one the Competition jury went to By Jonathan Romney The words you kept hearing at Venice this year were, “It’s so relaxed.” Venice is indeed a remarkably laid-back festival, with none of the apocalyptic hyperventilation that invariably affects Cannes. In Venice, films are allowed to be just good, or even so-so, without everyone fulminating in outrage when the Seventh Art fails to attain its loftiest peaks. This year, the festival’s quiet mood may have had something to do with the fact that Telluride, which overlapped with it, attracted a lot of press attention and several of the same key films. But, while I heard it said several times that the party had moved on, this year’s Mostra still attracted the sort of names you want gracing your festival - not just the red-carpet pap magnets, but also major auteurs such as Competition jury members Lynne Ramsay, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Nuri Bilge Ceylan and president Alfonso Cuaron, plus Jonathan Demme, the jury president of the Horizons sidebar, and Brian De Palma, both there also to receive awards. The latter was also the subject of a documentary, De Palma, by Noah Baumbach and Jake Paltrow - an extensive single-talking-head job with illustrations, but extremely revealing and often very funny, De Palma being one for telling it like it is. And no one can complain that Venice isn’t a proper cinephile fest: there’s a prize for Best Documentary on Cinema (which went to Yves Montmayeur’s slight but entertaining The looo Eyes ofDrMaddin, about the wizard of Winnipeg), and one for Best Restored Film (Pasolini’s Salb). So, plenty to be content with - except that the Competition jury seemed to have been attending a different festival from the rest of us. There was quite clearly a Golden Lion frontrunner Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson’s Anomalisa that was in a league of its own in terms of imagination, innovation and insight into the human condition - more on that anon - but it wasn’t Lorenzo Vigas’s From Afar, which scooped the prize. This Venezuelan debut drama was pretty good - but the film felt too low-key and in some ways overfamiliar to merit quite so intense a spotlight. Set in Caracas, it involves a middle- aged man, Armando, who pays young men to come to his flat, where he masturbates while watching them, as per the title, at a distance. Armando is played by Alfredo Castro, whose unnerving presence has been at the centre of several films by Chile’s Pablo Larram; the DP is Larram’s regular collaborator Sergio Armstrong, whose intriguingly ‘off palette of olives and soured pastels places the film at a certain remove from its realist point of departure. Castro’s minimalist reserve is typically mesmerising, although his enigmatic style is a hair away from becoming a mannerism. Non-professional newcomer Luis Silva is also a face to watch, as the street-smart pick-up who offers more intimacy than Armando is comfortable with. From A/ar certainly had more to offer than the Latin American winner of the Silver Bear for Best Direction: Pablo Trapero’s The Clan. The Argentinian director has never made a bad film, but his career has reached the point at which his 18 I Sight&Sound | November 2015 inclusion in a competition has a sort of meat-and- potatoes predictability. The Clan is an involving true-crime thriller set in the Galtieri years, about a family that runs a clandestine kidnapping racket; but its tensions, ironies and political resonances are awkwardly undermined by a faux-Scorsesean pop soundtrack. It’s not bad, but mould-breaking direction isn’t the first thing that comes to mind. No complaints, really, about the Lion of the Future award to Brady Corbet for his The Childhood of a Leader. You’ll know actor Corbet as the American of choice for Euro art movies (Force Majeure, Eden, Saint Laurent md Clouds of Sils Maria last year alone). His austere and surprisingly formal costume piece, inspired by a Sartre short story, was not just his directing debut but, somewhat self-consciously, his Major Statement. Shot in enveloping darkness by Lol Crawley, the film concerns a strong-willed child whose tantrums disrupt the meetings for the Treaty of Versailles, and pave the way, apparently, to his becoming a fascist leader. Visually striking but dramatically ponderous, the film maintains a studiously sombre register (shades of Pialat’s 1987 Under the Sun of Satan). A deranged non sequituroi a coda was either masterful or ludicrous, but either way it stopped you in your tracks. I can’t say I liked much about this film - apart from the marrow-chilling orchestral score by Scott Walker - but for sheer nerve and ambition, Corbet deserves at least one of his two prizes here (the other was Horizon’s Best Director). I wasn’t present for the whole festival, and topping and tailing my visit meant missing a few much-admired Competition titles - notably Tom McCarthy’s Spotlight, Cary Fukunaga’s Beasts of No Nation and Aleksandr Sokurov’s Francofonia (for these last two, see our Toronto review, page 16) I particularly regret missing Behemothhy Zhao Liang, apparently a very distinctive docu-essay mapping the Divine Comedy on to images of economic and social change in contemporary China. In a mixed Competition, Drake Doremus’s futuristic romance Equals must rank among cinema’s most insipid dystopias ever. Jerzy Skolimowski’s ii Mmwfes tickled audiences and alienated critics, but this fragmented multi- strander was no more or less than an intricate house of cards designed to be knocked down spectacularly at the end; as such, good value. And Atom Egoyan’s RememberwdiS less idiosyncratic than usual (scripted not by the director but by Benjamin August), yet offered an intelligent thriller take on a combination of themes that could easily have made for a deeply awkward result: dementia and the Holocaust. Christopher Plummer’s performance was both commanding and moving, and he would have made a better choice for the male acting prize than Fabrice Luchini, doing his trademarked curmudgeon in Christian Vincent’s merely solid L’Hermine. Another prime candidate for that award was surely Ralph Fiennes, exuberantly bumptious as a motormouthed music-biz veteran - opposite Tilda Swinton in a near-silent role as a singer! - in Luca Cuadagnino’s A Bigger Splash, a quasi-remake of Jacques Deray’s La Piscine. It’s not in the same grand Viscontian mode as the director’s I Am Love, but incorporates many of his flourishes into what The assassin’s bullet: Amos Gitai’s Rabin, the Last Day Amos Gitdfs mostforc^l work in some time, ‘Rabin, the Last Day’ deserves to be the focus of heated argument seems initially a simple comedy of manners; it was certainly one of the most enjoyable films here.

From Afar Lorenzo Vigas seemingly free-associative docu-essay, fanning out from her late dog Lolabelle to take in thoughts on death and mourning, Wittgenstein, Buddhism and the artist’s childhood. It was a wise, witty and deeply touching film, although some may find it unpalatably precious; I loved it, and I’m not even a fan. This was, incidentally, a good year for essay films: the Venice Days sidebar contained Crant Cee’s Innocence of Memories, an exploration of the psychogeographic imagination of, and the Istanbul museum opened by, Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk. It was at once an evocative nocturnal reverie and a tantalising portrait in negative of a literary master. The other overlooked Competition contender was Amos Citai’s Rabin, the Last Day, about the assassination of Israeli PM Yitzhak Rabin in 1995. A sober docudrama inquiry with a detached stance suggestive of verbatim theatre, Citai’s film eschewed wild conspiracy theory but teasingly suggested that there were right-wing interests in the mix that made Rabin more easily accessible to his killer. Orthodox radical Yigal Amir. Citai’s most forceful work in some time, it deserves to be the focus of heated argument. Finally, the film for which the 72 nd Mostra will most be remembered received the Crand Jury Prize - no small honour, yet one that arguably short-changed it. Anomalisa is an animation film directed by Charlie Kaufman and stop-motion specialist Duke Johnson. It’s about a motivational speaker (voiced by David Thewlis) who visits a Cincinnati hotel and has a liaison with a gauche young woman from Ohio (voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh); everyone else is voiced in the same eerie leaden drone by Tom Noonan. There are some characteristically surreal Kaufman touches, but the film’s brilliance lies above all in exploring the weary mundanity of the Western everyday, and the way corporatised discourse is eroding our souls. The closer the film comes to drab reality, the stranger it feels, not least because the puppets - which are very manifestly puppets - offer an eerie distorting mirror of the characters’ humanity. Anomalisa is a nightmare movie of the subtlest kind, and in a perverse way, the most trenchantly realistic film here. © November 2015 | Sight&Sound 1 19 FESTIVALS BLOOD SPORT Three’s a crowd: the ghost of an ex-girlfriend haunts a couple in the Blaine brothers’ Nina Forever The dominant theme at this year’s festival seemed to be the sense of being trapped, mentally, physically or, most often, both By Kim Newman For its 1 5th annual edition, Film4 FrightFest continued its blob-like growth to take in more venues - spilling out of the Vue West End to recolonise its original home, the Prince Charles Cinema - and add more strands, more screens, more films... to the extent that even the most dedicated weekend-pass-holder could only manage to see a third of the movies on offer at the festival. The overkill is part of the experience - with some films or even premises, such as the one about the wormhole that sucks shower curtains into a Lovecraftian limbo (Curtain) or Steve Oram’s suburban-set reinvention of Hammer Films’ ‘akita akita’ caveman movies (AAAAAAAAHI), working best if slipped into a barrage of movie-viewing to elicit a sense that this might be a dream brought on by exhaustion, unreeling on the inside of the eyelids rather than projected digitally on a screen. As always, FrightFest is a way of taking stock of what’s going on in the genre in any given year, with fads and preoccupations and weird coincidences making for an increasingly intricate series of interconnections between disparate titles across all streams of programming. The dominant theme of this year’s horror would seem to be a sense of being trapped or confined, whether physically or mentally or, most often, both. On offer were films about people trapped in vehicles (Rabid Dogs, Curve, The Sand, Howl), houses or apartments (Bite, Shut In, The Diabolical, Estranged, Slumlord), standing on a landmine (Landmine Goes Click), nailed to a classroom desk (The Lesson), abducted in the service of office politics (Scherzo Diabolico), besieged by a giant insect (Stung) or demon children (Hellions), and trapped in a closet (Inner Demon). The most interesting of these are the movies which wed the suspense mechanics of confinement with a psychological or metaphysical trap. British cinema offered Gez Medinger and Robin Schmidt’s AJierDeath, in which the characters are in limbo after their deaths and facing the threat of an eternity in hell, and the Blaine brothers’ unusual ghost story Nina Lorever, in which the eponymous bloody naked spectre manifests whenever her surviving boyfriend tries to move on and have sex with his new love interest. In an American indie vein, Mickey Keating’s Pod and Perry Blackshear’s They Look Like People address a free-form modern paranoia as their protagonists feel compelled to try to help a recalcitrant brother or best friend who is convinced that alien infiltrators are among us. Recent perennial forms show some signs of slacking off, though - among a small clutch of founifootage films - JeruZalem makes very interesting use (sure to be imitated) of Google Glasses to document an apocalyptic event in the old town of Jerusalem (complete with startling demons), and the flagging zombie apocalypse was made fresh again by Kyle Rankin’s female-led The festival’s growth meant that even the most dedicated weekend- pass-holder could only manage to see a third of the movies on offer comedy Night of the Living Deb. Vampires were confined to one lonely tucked-away-late-at-night comedy (Bloodsucking Bastards), but Bernard Rose’s Lrankenstein-and, to a lesser extent, David Gelb’s The Lazarus Effect- administers an electric charge to another of the genre’s hardiest myths. Shot digitally in contemporary Los Angeles locations, Rose’s adaptation of Mary Shelley’s novel (and James Whale’s films) is a major addition to the Frankenstein filmography and likely to be a much discussed next year, on the 200th anniversary of the menage at Villa Diodati that unchained the Modern Prometheus. Nina of Nina Lorever dead anti-bullying crusader Moira of Adam Egypt Mortimer’s Some Kind of Gez Medinger and Robin Schmidt’s AfterDeath Hate embody fresh takes on the archetype of the avenging female ghost, as does the semi- possessed actress of Takashi Miike’s Over Your Dead Body, the latest of many screen incarnations of the Japanese classic The Ghost of Yotsuya (1959). This year, it seems that many makers of horror films have been catching up on their academic feminism and a wide range of movies address the mythic figure - as identified by critics Carol J. Clover, Vera Diker and others - of the horror movie heroine, with Tyler Shields’s Linal Girl, Jeffery Scott Lando’s Suspension and Benjamin R. Moody’s Last Girl Standing looking afresh at the survivor girl and answering the question of the original Texas Chain Saw tagline, “Who will survive and what will be left of them?” Ben Cresciman’s Sun Choke and Jon Knautz’s Goddess of Love explore the interior minds of crazy ladies a couple of generations on from Repulsion (1965), offering varying contexts for insanity. That all this connects with the classical gothic is proved by a trio of British movies. In Adam Levins’s Estranged, an amnesiac heiress (Amy Manson) is returned to a crumbling estate and a family she can’t remember but distrusts, only to be drawn into a cruel scheme to secure an inheritance. This is the strongest of several films dealing with fears of pregnancy - teen pregnancy has a Satanic aspect in David Keating’s Cherry Tree and Bruce McDonald’s Hellions -but also ties in with a pleasingly disreputable British strain of up-to-the-minute economic horror represented by Mark Murphy’s Awaiting, about captivity and heredity on an isolated farm, and Dominic Brunt’s Bait, in which a payday moneylender is inflated into a relentless horror film psychopath pitted against a plucky, mature pair of under-the-debt-hammer final girls. © 20 I Sight&Sound | November 2015 cmn CtMbcISei^ ThpI^D Qm^W CITY LICHTS iwitics WeM '^^rmpf^s %mmm llWtUCHT The Journal of Film Preservation is published twice a year by the International Federation of Film Archives (FIAF).

Leave behind the monsters of our childhood? These questions haunt Guill- ermo del Toro’s much anticipated new film Crimson Peak, in which the cult Mexican director once again gives the gothic his own unique spin. It’s been nine years since his last gothic outing, the second of what he considers his two most personal films, the internationally lauded Pan’s Labfi- rinth (2006), companion to The Devil’s Backbone (2001). In Crimson Peakhe pays lavish homage to all those ghosts that populate the gothic imagination, with references to classics such as Rebecca, Wuthering Heights and Poe’s House of Usher, as well as through ethereal traces of his own work; and in so doing strives to reassert that, in the words of his protagonist, “Ghosts do exist. This much 1 know.” A profoundly sensual, ornate, carnal gothic romance set at the turn of the 20th century. Crimson Peak centres on a love triangle that has protagonist Edith (Mia Wa- sikowska) at its apex. A young forward-thinking writer with a flair for ghost stories, Edith finds herself caught between two opposing worlds - the brash modernity of North America where she lives, full of light, enterprise and reason; and the dark, old, secret-filled world of the English aristocracy in the shape of a mysterious baronet. Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston), and his icy sister. Lady Lucille (Jessica Chastain), who lure her to the damp greyness of their ancestral pile in the Lake District. That home, the once grandiose but now decay- ing Allerdale Hall, is fast sinking into the crimson 22 I Sight&Sound | November 2015 GUILLERMO DEL TORO CRIMSON PEAK O clay that gives the film its title; at once a symbol of the disintegration of a way of life, a backward- looking mindset, and imprisonment within a suffo- cating family history. A character in its own right, the house literally breathes and aches and spits blood. It was constructed for the film from scratch, with every prop - teacups, doorknobs, dresses, portraits and an exquisitely nightmarish lift - handcrafted from designs conceived by del Toro; apposite in a film where the most potent weapon, in more ways than one (and for Edith especially), turns out to be the transformative power of creation itself. Del Toro’s own creative triumph in Crimson PeakWes in reconfiguring a well-trodden genre on his own terms, giving a fresh slant to gothic tropes - be they from litera- ture, art or cinema - so that it’s the female protagonists driving the narrative this time round. Despite directly passing from her father to her husband - an inevitable trajectory for a woman at the time - by necessity she must actively shape her own fate. Likening herself to Mary Shelley, Edith finds that it is her capacity to draw on her own past, in order to square up to the monsters in her present, that enables her to move forward. Eor, as she says to Thomas: “You keep on looking for me in the past. But I’m here, in the present.” Mar Diestro-Dopido: You wrote the story for Crimson Peak back in 2006 with Matthew Robbins. Why did it take so long to get made? Guillermo del Toro: 1 wanted to make it right after Paris Labj^rinth, but two things detained it. One was that 1 wanted it to be R rated. 1 knew that at the heart of the movie there were concerns that were very adult for me, sexually and psychologically, and visually there were moments of violence and eroticism that were not going to be PG-i 3. And secondly 1 knew 1 wanted to make it for $ 50 million, and not 20, not 30, because 1 wanted to build the house, 1 wanted to do the wardrobe, because 1 wanted to hide several clues of the story and the characters in the wardrobe and the sets. 1 wanted to make it like a living painting. And it took eight years for someone, in this case Legendary Pictures, to come back to me and say, “Here’s the money and we’re OK with the R rating.” MDD: Unusually for your gothic films. Crimson Peak is about adults rather than children - we see the ten-year-old Edith only briefly. GDT: It’s a curious thing because although there are no kids, in reality the stories of both the protagonist [Edith] and the antagonists [Lucille and Thomas] are firmly rooted in childhood. Edith we see in the opening as a little kid. But then we hear innumerable times about the childhood of Thomas and Lucille; the whole point of the movie is to show that the real horror was that child- hood. 1 gave the house windows that look like eyes and the house almost becomes all those ancestors watch- ing over them. And then you see Lucille and Thomas as children in a very strange mural in the attic. So it is still rooted in childhood. 1 wanted very much to talk about this Chinese puzzle box of abuse that is the family, this ancestral horror of a family passing the poison from one generation to the next - that was interesting to me. MDD: The house not only literally breathes, but it’s as if it gets bigger or smaller depending on Edith’s emotional state. GDT: Yes, and the proportions of Edith too. Edith looks so small when she is afraid because 1 put her in a giant sofa, but when she is more in charge the sofa looks smaller, be- MIDNIGHT’S CHILDREN Tom Hiddleston plays Sir Thomas Sharpe (above, with Wasikowska’s Edith) and Jessica Chastain plays Lady Lucille (below, right), a pair of siblings scarred by the horrors of their childhood cause 1 actually made it in two sizes. And 1 made two sizes of the teacups. So she has one giant teacup when she’s feeling vulnerable and a smaller one when she gets stron- ger. We actually did that with the bed too - we did giant pillows and giant bed covers to make her look almost like a character out of a fairytale, a little girl in the bed. MDD: Why did you choose to place the story in this particu- lar period - the turn of the century at the transition from Victorian to Edwardian - and to contrast the US with the UK, the New World with the Old. GDT: It’s a crucial moment. When Henry James was dis- cussing gothic romance, and I’m paraphrasing here, he said it was essentially about ghosts that represent the past, or the incapacity to move into the future with- out vanquishing them. And 1 thought it was a very in- teresting time because in 1901 Buffalo, New York, and America in general were practically futuristic. In 1901 Buffalo was the most electrified city in the world. Edith is using a typewriter, we see cars on the streets, we can hear the constant traffic of trains in the distance, there’s a telegraph, we hear phones ringing everywhere. And even though she’s seen a ghost, Edith has an incredibly modern, almost futuristic attitude towards her feminin- ity. Then she travels to a world that is frozen in time. In fact we made that point in the design of Thomas and Lucille’s clothes - they are 10 or 1 5 years older than any- body else’s because they are their parents’ clothes. So the idea was: can 1 pose Edith as the future, trying to break with the past and the guilt and the horror of that family? This was crucial for me, since it was such a female-centric movie in my mind. 1 wanted her not to be rescued by the hero, but for her to rescue the hero. MDD: In many ways it seems your most complex film, nar- ratively and thematically. GDT: 1 made three decisions that were completely coun- ter to making the movie more accessible, or commer- cially easy. One decision was to make it female-centric, which curiously enough really makes the movie sit very weirdly with male audiences. Eemale audiences engage with the movie very strongly, but males actually seem unhappy to see that every male figure in the movie is kind of useless. They cannot get their head around it. The second decision was that as the movie progresses. 24 I Sight&Sound | November 2015 instead of applauding and having a rah-rah moment when the villains are finally confronted, 1 thought, like 1 did in DeviVs Backbone, that they would actually reveal their humanity, that you would understand them a little more towards the end. The third thing 1 rejected that would have made the movie easily more commercial was that 1 decided, like 1 did in Devil's Backbone, that 1 would not cheat and have a Judaeo-Christian sense of evil for the ghosts, that 1 would not say they were evil ghosts, or demonic ghosts, or that the house was possessed. 1 wanted to reveal little by little that they were trying to help Edith, the way Santi was trying to help the boys in Devil's Backbone. MDD: One of the most recognisable traits of your work is precisely the humanity you give to the ghosts and monsters. That’s reflected in the effects you use to create them - they are ethereal here, but much fleshier than a CGI-generated image, like a mix of flesh, bones, spirit and smoke. GOT: 1 wanted the movie to feel handmade. 1 wanted people to realise that they are not in a digital set, that we actually built the house. 1 wanted people to sense that we painstakingly hand-made those dresses. And, in fact, Lu- cille and Thomas’s clothes are hand-stitched, in contrast to the American wardrobe which is machine-stitched. 1 wanted people to have a sense that it was almost like an opera, that everything had been created, slightly exagger- ated, but beautifully enhanced. 1 wanted the ghosts to be unlike any other ghosts you’ve ever seen, so 1 decided 1 would use actors and make-up. 1 then said to the digital effects guys, “Let’s find a way to make them translucent, without having to shoot them against a green screen.” 1 wanted them to be on set with the actors. We came up with a very simple but nice solution and created a little black box of photogrammetry that reproduces the back- ground. Then we animated a skeleton inside the bodies, like we did with Santi in Devil's Backbone, and 1 made their body a little more liquid, so when they move they leave traces of their body around. That way it’s a perfect mix- ture of make-up and digital effects, because it’s 50/50. MDD: Crimson Peak seems the most lavish and beautiful film you have made. Why was this so important for you? GDT: 1 have a nostalgia for the big Hollywood gothic ro- mance, like Robert Stevenson’s Jane Eyre [1943] or Alfred Hitchcock’s Rebecca [1940] or the beautiful production of Great Expectations [1946] by David Lean. But 1 have an almost painful realisation that for many people horror or anything gothic means a B movie and that no one has produced anything that’s as operatic as those films in at least 30 years. 1 wanted to make this opulent sort of operatic movie because gothic romance is about excess, albeit a very controlled sense of excess - in the acting, in the mise en scene. 1 made it clear to the cinematographer [Dan Laustsen] that we were creating the opposite of the desaturation that normally goes with period pieces. We were going to be really saturated. The one movie 1 watched a lot was The Leopard [1963]. 1 really studied the way Visconti shot the dancers, and the way he controlled the colour palette. And then 1 said to my cinematographer, we are going to move the camera as if it were very heavy. We won’t be chasing people around; it’s going to be very stately, like we are on tracks or a dolly, even if we use the Steadicam. MDD: It’s very striking the way you’ve colour-coded the film. Edith seems almost preserved in amber, especially when she’s in England in that cold, inhospitable house. GDT: We were talking about beauty, and for me beauty is part of the language of a film. Beauty is not eye-candy - it is like protein, it needs to contain something nutritious, a narrative. 1 wanted very much to encapsulate America in that golden period, and then transition with Edith, who remains golden, to this very cold, north of England de- crepit mansion. Little by little her colours are leached out until she is in white; they are literally sucking the blood out of her. 1 wanted the past to be represented I have a nostalgia for the big Hollywood gothic romance, like Stevenson’s ‘Jane Eyre’, Hitchcock’s ‘Rebecca’ or Lean’s beautiful ‘Great Expectations’ November 2015 | Sight&Sound | 25 GUILLERMO DEL TORO CRIMSON PEAK O by the colour red, which is the clay of the house and at the same time is the blood of the earth. It is about these aristocrats effectively sucking the blood out of the earth until it dries and even then, refusing to let it go. The movie is divided into two - a golden passage which is modernity, and then a cyan blue passage which is Allerdale Hall. In the middle you have the colour red linking Lucille to the ghosts, to the ground. But in the case of Edith 1 really wanted to posit some- thing that concerns me, which is that beauty is as isolat- ing as ugliness. Because when a woman possesses beauty in the way that she carries herself, the way that she pres- ents herself to the world, that’s instantly equated with weakness. And most people cannot see past that beauty in the same way that most people cannot see past ugli- ness. In many Greek trials the innocence or the culpabil- ity of the accused was decided on the physical appear- ance. The judges would look at the two parties and they would absolve the beautiful party. MDD: Are there any autobiographical elements in the film? GDT: Crimson Peak is like a throwback to the Hollywood productions that 1 saw as a kid. The first ever movie 1 saw in my life, when 1 was four years old, was Wuthering Heights in the lap of my mother. So that is very present in the film. Crimson Pea/: has a lot of personal little things that were secret until now; the opening memory, the girl in the bed - that actually happened to my mother. My mother was in bed after the funeral of her grandmother whom she loved, and she heard footsteps and felt the soft whisper of the fabric, the silk of her grandmother’s dress, as she entered the room. She sensed her perfume, she heard and felt the weight of her on the bed and the bed springs creaked. She felt her grandmother embrace her. She screamed and ran away from the room. And I’ve had two ghost encounters in my life, the second of which is in the movie. When 1 was scouting lo- cations for TheHobbitin New Zealand, 1 stayed in a haunt- ed hotel and 1 heard this horrible murder in the room. In the middle of the night 1 heard the screams of a woman being killed and a man sobbing. That’s the murder in the bathroom that Edith hears in the house. And many other little details... 1 identify with all the characters. 1 am the father, Edith, Thomas, 1 am everyone, and they all have traces of my emotional biography in there. MDD: This is the most gothic of your films, but do you think it also has a Mexican dimension? GDT: Normally the Anglo-Saxon approach to a ghost story - even in the best cases, like M.R. James - is an approach that sees the rational clashing with the su- pernatural. On the other hand, in Crimson Pea/: there’s a full-blown acceptance of the ghosts being real from the first ten seconds of the film. There is a postulate that opens the movie that says, “Ghosts are real. This much I know.” That’s a very Mexican thing to say. The violence and the passion of Crimson Peak is very Latin; the relation- ship with stabbing in particular as a means of death is extremely Mexican. And ultimately, there is a very inti- mate relationship with melodrama, which is almost a signature part of the Mexican culture - the explosive pas- sions that run underneath the very Anglo-Saxon fagade of characters like Lucille. MDD: This is also the most starry cast you’ve worked with. Could you talk a little about how you work with your actors. GDT: What 1 do is write an eight- to ten-page biography of each character and tell the actors what they like and dislike. Then 1 give them a very detailed narrative of their life and each actor gets a secret they don’t reveal to anyone. Eor example, Lucille’s secret is that she wants to remain in Allerdale Hall forever; Thomas’s secret is that he wants to leave - so they are playing opposite forces. After that 1 keep it very much in the moment, because 1 don’t want to give complex instructions during the shoot. 1 direct by giving them a verb, never a noun. So 1 go to them and say, “You are in a hurry.” “You are manipu- lating her.” “You are watching the tea, you are not watch- ing her.” Eor example, the place where the verb is most obvious is in the porridge-feeding scene [when Lucille is nursing Edith]. We could have had that happen with dia- logue, but 1 felt it was more interesting for Lucille to be feeding Edith in a really violent way, almost like penetra- tion with the spoon. Lucille uses the spoon like a stab- bing weapon, almost. So in that way you give the actor something to do rather than something to think about. MDD: Is there anything you wanted to do in this film that you weren’t able to? GDT: Not really. Whatever shortcomings there are in the film are entirely mine. After the fact 1 see everything that 1 could have done better. But it’s too late, you have to accept it, you cannot reshoot this or reshoot that. But it is one of the top three films in my affections. The Devil’s Backbone, Pan’s Lab];rinth and Crimson Peakaie the three movies 1 feel are the closest to being what 1 dreamt they could be.© O Crimson Peak is released in UK cinemas on 16 October and will be reviewed in the next issue Beauty is as isolating as ugliness.
