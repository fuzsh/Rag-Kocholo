        "text": "Scottish actor James McAvoy (b. 1979) is an award-winning screen star who has appeared in a huge variety of films, from blockbusters such as “X-Men: First Class” (2011) and its later installments, or films that were nominated for Oscars with “The Last King of Scotland” (2006) and “Atonement” (2007), to arthouse films like “Filth” (2013). Through the years, he also starred in several West End productions.\n\nIn M. Night Shyamalan’s “Split” (2016) and “Glass” (2019), he played a character with twenty-three alternate personalities, and he appeared opposite numerous stars, including Anne Hathaway, Maggie Smith, Saoirse Ronan, Angelina Jolie, Helen Mirren, Jennifer Lawrence, Jessica Chastain, and Charlize Theron.\n\nLast weekend, he was the guest of honor at FACTS Belgian Comic Con in Ghent, Belgium, where he drew a massive crowd for his Q&A. Since SAG-AFTRA, the Union that represents many actors, is currently on strike against the major studios, networks, and streamers, it has put together a set of guidelines to allow their guests to still participate in such events, requesting them not to discuss their work or characters and avoid comments that can be seen as promoting projects that fall under the Union’s strike order. Therefore actors will discuss other, more general topics about their life and work.\n\nIn the first part of James McAvoy’s Q&A, the moderator asked questions, and then the microphone was handed to the audience, as long as they respected the strike rules.\n\nThis Q&A has been slightly edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nJames, is this your first time in Belgium?\n\nNo. I have filmed in Ostend [“Filth,” 2013], and I was in Blankenberge when I was twelve. That’s it.\n\nIs there anything that strikes you about Belgium or Belgians?\n\nI immediately got a taste—or a flavor—of how much people like beer here. Last night, when I arrived, there were about twelve people in front of the hotel I was staying at, just drinking cans of beer.\n\nWhen I was in the U.K., there was a famous drinking game, ‘Name three famous Belgians.’ Can you do that?\n\nJean-Claude Van Damme. I’m a big football fan and a Spurs fan as well, so I’d say Toby Alderweireld, Jan Vertonghen, and the guy who doesn’t seem to make it at Chelsea—I don’t know why he can’t make it work, or why they can’t make it work better with him, but Romelu Lukaku is amazing.\n\nAnd three famous Scotsmen?\n\nWell, there are quite a lot of actors I could mention, but there’s also Alexander Graham Bell and Robbie Burns.\n\nWhat would be the perk of being an actor?\n\nThe perk of being an actor… I don’t know. If you’re a successful actor and you get to work a lot, you work and work and work, but when you don’t work, you’re just off. Not a lot of people get that rhythm. Many people work fifty weeks a year, from nine to five. When I work, it’s from six in the morning until eight in the evening, but when I don’t work, I’m just off. Then I get to be with my kids, my friends, and my partner. That’s kind of a perk.\n\nWhat is the most unexpected thing about acting?\n\nI don’t know if you guys know this because it seems to be really glamorous when we’e up here or when we’re on red carpets, but it’s probably one of the least glamorous jobs you can do. You’re generally freezing pretending to be hot, or you’re generally hot—too hot—pretending to be freezing. You’re always covered in water, or you’re always covered in blood, so it’s never that glamorous, I think. People think it’s glamorous, but it’s when we’re going to sell a movie that it gets glamorous.\n\nWhat would be the most difficult emotion to express as an actor? Crying, laughing, something else?\n\nI don’t really find any of them difficult. I think if the script is really good, it comes naturally. If the script is bad and they’re asking you to cry, it’s very hard to cry. If the script is bad and they ask you to laugh, it’s hard to laugh. As long as the script is good, I feel like it comes naturally because the story just wants to be poured out of you.\n\nIf you weren’t an actor, what would you have liked to be?\n\nIf I wasn’t an actor, I think I would have joined the Navy. So, if I hadn’t gone to acting school, I would probably have done that. I would also have liked to be a park ranger in a big national outdoor park, working in the outdoors.\n\nDo you have tips for anyone who wants to be an actor?\n\nI feel that a lot of people I talk to these days say, ‘I want to be an actor,’ and then I ask, ‘What are you doing about that?’ ‘I don’t know, I just want to get an agent.’ But you’ve either got to go to acting school, or you’ve just got to do acting, no matter what age you are—eight, sixteen, twenty, thirty, forty. The minute you decide you want to become an actor, start acting. So what does that mean? Go to an amateur dramatic club, go to acting school, go to youth theater, make sure you are in front of people, performing and failing. Because it is through failing and being kind of not appreciated that you start to lose your ego in a bad way, and you start to be yourself on stage without worrying about anything else. And I would say, actually, ‘Being on stage, even if it’s amateur or youth theater or anything like that, it’s healthy for you.’ Even if you don’t want to become an actor, it’s healthy for your self-esteem, for your ego, and for your ability to withstand criticism because you get really good. It doesn’t matter what people think of you because if you can control it or can’t control it—whether you like me as an actor—I can’t control whether you like my performance. The only thing I can control is what I’m trying to give you. And that means that there’s a certain power in that. So even if you don’t want to be an actor, I would always suggest some form of acting and some form of performance. I think it helps you to sleep better at night.\n\nBeing on set must be exciting, but also exhausting. Do you have any rituals that help you?\n\nAlcohol, copious amounts of alcohol [laughs]. No. No, I don’t really; I just find it quite easy to go home and switch off and go to bed. I used to eat a sandwich every night after getting home from doing a play. A really big fat cheese and ham sandwich with onions on it, and then I realized I was losing my voice. I realized that eating a sandwich at night and then lying down was making me lose my voice because of the stomach acid, so there you go. Stop that ritual.\n\nYou have been acting for more than twenty years now?\n\nI’m forty-four, so I’ve been acting for twenty-eight years.\n\nWhat has changed the most in those twenty-eight years in the acting industry?\n\nWhat has changed the most… I don’t know, man. I’ve changed a lot. I’m older and wiser and hopefully better. I think the scripts I get are less finished. I used to get scripts, and it felt like we could shoot that script. These days, I get scripts, or I get a script for a TV show, and the rest hasn’t been written yet, and they’ll get written while we’re making the show. It never used to be like that for me. With movie scripts, there’s less money for development, so I get a script that’s maybe the third draft, whereas I used to get a script when it was in the seventh draft. That means that you’re going into something that feels a little less well-prepared. That’s maybe the only thing I can point out.\n\nDo you prefer CGI or real-life special effects?\n\nReal-life special effects are always preferable, but sometimes they’re just not doable. But I don’t mind working with CGI, and I don’t mind working with a green screen. Again, if you have a good script, a green screen is great. If you have a bad script and you’re working with real people, it’s really hard. If you’re working with a good script and you’re just playing against tennis balls, I think I’m happy, you know.\n\nYou are very famous. Do you love or hate fame?\n\n[Laughs.] I don’t love it or hate it. It has never been something awful for me to deal with. It has never affected my life in a way that it does affect some people who are in the top five percent. So I’m kind of lucky. Generally, I don’t love it or hate it. It is what it is. Fame serves me at times, and it hurts me at times. But it’s fine; it’s just part of the job.\n\nHave you ever used your fame to get something, like a table, at a fully booked restaurant?\n\nAbsolutely. I generally walk around with a hat and a pair of glasses, but sometimes, if you’re walking up to a restaurant, you’re thinking how wonderful it would be to get a table while it’s all fully booked. So I take the hat and the glasses off and say, ‘Hi! How are you doing?’ And the people I’m with, say, ‘You ask, you ask.’ It doesn’t always work, but sometimes it does.\n\nWhat’s your strangest story related to being famous?\n\nOh my God. I met a couple at a party once. The woman decided to tell me that I was her allowance. You know, it’s like you have a list of five people or something, and if your partner meets any of them, they’re allowed to do something with them and vice versa. I was at the top of her list. They never thought they would meet me, but they had their list. The guy was going, ‘What the hell.’ But the girl, she was like for real. She went away to the bathroom, and the guy was like, ‘Dude, I love her, man. I really love her.’ I was like, ‘I am not doing this.’ I was married at the time—I’m married now. So I said, ‘I’m not going anywhere with your partner.’ But it was weird. She made the point of telling me that most people would actually pick for the top of their list somebody like Channing Tatum. But she was like, ‘Not me’ [laughs].\n\nA final question before we go to the audience. You’re a father. How did fatherhood change your life?\n\nIt gives you perspective. You realize that what you want and what you do isn’t the most important thing anymore; they’re the most important thing—whether you like that or not at times. They are your first and last consideration, definitely one hundred percent. You become the least important person in your life.\n\nLadies and gentleman, it’s your time to shine. Please line up. There are a few basic rules: English only, one question per person, articulate and speak in the microphone, and please respect the rules we explained in the beginning. So no questions about series, movies, or names. Just general questions.\n\n[Still, there were some questions about his films or roles. Mr. McAvoy’s response to some of the questions was, ‘I am sorry, that’s a question I can’t answer right now. I’m currently on strike and I’m not allowed to talk about any of my work.’ Here is a selection of the questions asked by members of the audience]\n\nHi James, I always liked your acting, but now I also like you as a person and as a human being. I’ve been to so many conventions, and usually actors do not take the time to say ‘Hi’ or ‘Thank you, nice meeting you.’ But you do, and I want to thank you for that.\n\nThank you. You guys come and spend your money and your time, and before today, you spent money and time watching our movies and TV shows and whatever. It feels really important to me to try and give a bit of energy back. So in those moments—even though I’m saying the same things and stuff—I am literally trying to give some energy. Aside from the fact that I make money from these things, which I do, it’s a really unique opportunity to meet the people who helped you get where you’ve gotten to. Other than red carpets for a film, you just don’t meet the people who appreciate your work and have supported your work and what you did for twenty-eight years. So, generally, thank you.\n\nAs an actor, you always have to learn new things, like riding horses. What has been the most difficult or most entertaining thing you had to learn, and did you ever hurt yourself?\n\nI can talk about this because it’s a play in the West End. I did a play called “The Ruling Class” [2015] in which I had to learn to unicycle while wearing nothing but my underwear and a pair of high heel boots—while playing the flute. That was really difficult, and, of course, I learned to unicycle. But once the play finished, I never got on a unicycle again. And I don’t think I could ride the unicycle today.\n\nWhat is the most inspiring book you read about acting?\n\nI have to be honest. I have not had a good time reading books about acting. I don’t know why. I never felt like somebody can teach me how to act—I know that sounds bad. People definitely helped me learn how to act, but as soon as somebody starts to teach me how to act, it works for them but doesn’t necessarily work for me. It’s the same with directors; as soon as they’re trying to tell me how to act, I don’t think it works. But then helping you figure out how to act, I think, works. For me, it was watching acting, watching other actors, watching movies, watching theater that has really informed my acting, and then also doing it myself. My belief is that acting isn’t just about feeling emotions and being truthful and realistic or believable. Acting is about storytelling, and the minute I figured that out, everything became much easier. Because who knows whether you’re being truthful, who knows you’re being realistic. I might think I’m being realistic, and you think I’m not. But I can say I did tell the story, and as soon as I started trying just to tell the story, everything started falling into place. But in terms of books, I’ve never really enjoyed great books on acting.\n\nDo you have a favorite book on any topic?\n\nMy favorite books are pretty classic standards like “To Kill a Mockingbird” [1960] and I mention another book here—not necessarily a movie—a book called “Atonement” [2001] which I think is one of the most incredible books I ever read. Those are some of my favorites.\n\nIf you could pull off any heist without any consequences, what would you steal?\n\nLots and lots and lots and lots and lots of money. As a kid, I thought I’d like to be a pilot, I’d like to be a doctor, and I did want to be a bank robber. Not a violent one, if you were able to do it all by like tunneling and safe breaking, I thought, ‘Well, that’s a cool way to make lots of money.’ You don’t hurt anybody, and in my head, the bank was insured, so you wouldn’t be stealing the money from people. You would be stealing it from a corporation that was insured. So I was like, ‘Hey, I’ll be a bank robber.’ I didn’t quite realize it was illegal, and you would go to prison for thirty years. But that’s weird. I did actually consider being a bank robber from about the age of seven to twelve.\n\nI admire your performance in “Cyrano de Bergerac” [2019]. It was an exceptional theatrical experience. Do you have any dream roles you like to play? Maybe some Shakespeare?\n\nYes. I wanted to be in “Julius Caesar” in fact before we did “Cyrano de Bergerac,” I was going to do “Julius Caesar” and I had an idea of how we wanted to do it—Jamie [Lloyd] and I—Jamie, the director that I worked with a lot. But about four or five different productions of “Julius Caesar” were all going to happen in the theater at that exact moment, and so we decided to do something else. Jamie came to me and said, “You want to do “Cyrano de Bergerac”?’ I said, ‘Yeah, man.’ So maybe we’ll do that one day. Shakespeare, I don’t like all of Shakespeare, but there are some great roles out there, so hopefully I’m going to play them. I do want to play King Lear, but that’s when I’m really really old.\n\nDo you have a favorite place in Belgium?\n\nI’m not saying this because we’re in Ghent, but so far I’ve really enjoyed Ghent. I had one of the best meals I’ve ever had last night in Ghent. It’s a very beautiful city. The other places I’ve been to were Ostend and Blankenberge. I was in Blankenberge when I was twelve, and I was in Ostend when I was making a movie, and I saw nothing of it. But I feel like I’ve got a bit of a flavor for this one, and I’m not just saying it because we’re here.\n\nIs there one quote that has always stuck with you?\n\nOne quote that has always stuck with me? Oh, man. [Pauzes.] Something my grandmother said, ‘There’s nothing wrong with a little bit of crying,’ and she always told me it was okay to cry.\n\nWe’re here at the convention to meet our heroes and idols. Did you ever have an idol?\n\nThey were all football heroes, really [laughs]. There’s a player called Henrik Larsen. He was massive for me. And there’s Neil Lennon; he was a Northern Irish player and later became a really successful manager for Celtic as well. Those two players were so big for me growing up.\n\nIf you could swap life for a week with another celebrity, who would you choose?\n\nI think it would be a singer or a musician who gets to play a big stadium rock concert… You know what? Taylor Swift has done amazing concerts; I’ve been at one of them back in 2015 or something like that when she was doing the “1989” album. That was an incredible gig, and the atmosphere in that crowd was electric, so I may swap careers or lives or bodies with Taylor Swift.\n\nFACTS, Ghent, Belgium\n\nOctober 21, 2023\n\nFILMS\n\nTHE NEAR ROOM (1995) DIR David Hayman PROD Leonard Crooks SCR Robert Murphy CAM Kevin Rowley ED Martin Sharpe MUS James Grant, Jo Homewood CAST Adrian Dunbar, David O’Hara, David Hayman, Julie Graham, Tom Watson, James Ellis, Robert Pugh, James McAvoy (Kevin)\n\nREGENERATION (1997) DIR Gilles MacKinnon PROD Allan Scott, Peter R.
