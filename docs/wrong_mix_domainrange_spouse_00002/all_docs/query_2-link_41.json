        "text": "This week on Total Movie Recall, we go to the suck. Steve develops a thousand yard stare reserved for veterans of nightmare wars and mediocre podcasts. Ryan chalks up another point in the Irresponsible Father column, reflecting on his father's prudent decision to let him watch this vision of insanity at a tender age yet again.

It's the perfect post-2020 movie, and not just because of the constant suicides. It's twee and precious and we absolutely loved it. Harold & Maude (1971) d. Hal Ashby w. Colin Higgins Music by: Cat Steven (Yusuf Islam) Starring: Ruth Gordon Bud Cort Vivian Pickles Cult classic pairs Cort as a dead-pan disillusioned 20-year-old obsessed with suicide and a loveable Gordon as a fun-loving 80-year-old eccentric.

Hang in there with us, listen to this, and watch it again and try to tell us you didn't witness a psychotic break as this poor boy retreats inside the dark fantasies of his mind.

What do you think their “woke” movie would look like? Probably like this, where the N-word is replaced by horrific rape and Mexican jokes. This proto-edgelord movie was looked at as such a good time romp that it was considered the perfect vehicle to transition from the hit network show ER to the big screen. What a simpler time… From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) d. Robert Rodriguez w. Robert Kurtzman (story), Quentin Tarantino (screenplay) Starring: Harvey Keitel George Clooney Juliette Lewis Quentin Tarantino Salma Hayek Cheech Marin Danny Trejo Tom Savini Fred Williamson On the run from a bank robbery that left several police officers dead, Seth Gecko (George Clooney) and his paranoid, loose-cannon brother, Richard (Quentin Tarantino), hightail it to the Mexican border.

This might say more about where our heads are at right now than about this beloved comedy. Napoleon Dynamite (2004) d. Jared Hess w. Jared Hess, Jerusha Hess Starring: Jon Heder Efren Ramirez Jon Gries Aaron Ruell Diedrich Bader Tina Majorino Sandy Martin In small-town Preston, Idaho, awkward teen Napoleon Dynamite has trouble fitting in.

D'Urville Martin Story by: Rudy Ray Moore Starring: Rudy Ray Moore D'Urville Martin Lady Reed Jerry Jones Hy Pyke Dolemite is released from jail after being wrongfully convicted to take on rival pimp Willie Green, corrupt police officers who framed him and even the mayor!

Handsome, chiseled leading man Bob Hoskins soldiers on in spite of the bleeding ulcer all that booze gave him, and Christopher Lloyd goes to eleven with his unhinged, terrifying performance. Did hentai exist before this movie? Because it sure as hell did after it. Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) d. Robert Zemeckis Starring: Bob Hoskins Christopher Lloyd Kathleen Turner Joanna Cassidy Charles Fleischer Stubby Kaye Alan Tilvern Joel Silver Mel Blanc Down-on-his-luck private eye Eddie Valiant gets hired by cartoon producer R.K.

The pseudo-philosophy of this movie seems deeper than it is because it's endlessly reflected in all the glass buildings of Michael Mann's uber-masculine vision. Sure, it may be pretentious, but that's the point, and if you've got a problem with that, I will take you down, because we ain't exactly doin' thrill-seeker podcasts with “Born to Lose” tattoos on our chests. Heat (1995) d. Michael Mann Starring: Al Pacino Robert De Niro Val Kilmer Jon Voight Tom Sizemore Natalie Portman Ashley Judd Kevin Gage Hank Azaria Danny Trejo Henry Rollins AND Xander Berkeley as RALPH! Master criminal Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) is trying to control the rogue actions of one of his men, while also planning one last big heist before retiring. Meanwhile, Lieutenant Hanna (Al Pacino) attempts to track down McCauley as he deals with the chaos in his own life, including the infidelity of his wife (Diane Venora) and the mental health of his stepdaughter (Natalie Portman). McCauley and Hanna discover a mutual respect, even as they try to thwart each other's plans.

The cultural divide proves too much for Ryan in this wild, fantastic, hallucinatory Kung Fu epic of many names. The story is incomprehensible, the fights are nonsensical, but Steve still finds it defensible, while Ryan finds the editing reprehensible. There's no reason for this rhyme. Kung Fu Cult Master (1993) d. Jing Wong, Sammo Kam-Bo Hung Starring: Jet Li Man Cheung Chingmy Yau Set during the Yuen Dynasty, many sects compete for possession of the two golden swords which contain the secret to dominance of the world of martial arts. The first faction, led by Shaolin, consists of Shaolin, Wu Tang, Ngo Mai, Kun Lun, Hung Tung and Wah Shan. The second is the Ming Sect, otherwise known as the Fire Sect or Evil Sect, led by branch leaders Queen of Purple Dragon, King of White Eagle, King of Gold Lion and King of Green Bat. A student of Wu Tang, befriends Gold Lion and marries the daughter of White Eagle. He is killed for the secret of the location of the missing sword. His infant son witnesses this and vows revenge on the heads of the sect. Unfortunately he has a jinx which prevents him from learning martial arts.

This movie has it all -- a grand guignol of sex, violence, operatic depictions of Hell and Satan, Keanu swinging and missing, Pacino putting his blood pressure medication to the test -- and yet, somehow, it's still boring! Please don't waste Steve's time with these faux-provocations. Show him something really controversial, like a basketball game. The Devil's Advocate (1997) d. Taylor Hackford Based on the novel by Andrew Neiderman Starring: Keanu Reeves Al Pacino Charlize Theron Jeffrey Jones Judith Ivey Connie Nielsen Craig T. Nelson Don King Aspiring Florida defense lawyer Kevin Lomax accepts a high-powered position at a New York law firm headed by legal shark John Milton. As Kevin moves up in the firm's ranks, his wife, Mary Ann, has several frightening, mystical experiences that begin to warp her sense of reality. With the stakes getting higher with each case, Kevin quickly learns that his mentor is planning a far greater evil than simply winning without scruples.

Ryan simply cannot understand the cache this movie has in the “alt-comedy” world, or as he likes to call it, the “non-comedy” world (now that's funny!). Steve would explain it, but you just, like, don't get it man. Cabin Boy (1994) d. Adam Resnick Starring: Chris Elliott Ritch Brinkley James Gammon Brian Doyle-Murray Brion James Melora Walters David Letterman Andy Richter Ricki Lake Nathanial Mayweather is a spoiled rich kid whose plans for a ritzy Hawaiian cruise backfire, finding him lost at sea with a gang of salty old sailors.

Stop motion animation is such a labor intensive craft that creates beautiful visions that aren't all that interesting, which is going to enrage a bunch of high school Wiccans that love this movie. It does look great, though. Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) d. Henry Selick Starring: Danny Elfman Chris Sarandon Catherine O'Hara William Hickey Paul Reubens The film follows the misadventures of Jack Skellington, Halloweentown's beloved pumpkin king, who has become bored with the same annual routine of frightening people in the \"real world.\" When Jack accidentally stumbles on Christmastown, all bright colors and warm spirits, he gets a new lease on life -- he plots to bring Christmas under his control by kidnapping Santa Claus and taking over the role. But Jack soon discovers even the best-laid plans of mice and skeleton men can go seriously awry.

Definitely don't watch this movie if you're fresh out of rehab, which Ryan can tell you all about. The future is bleak, but if it's also as ruggedly handsome as Clive Owen is and has the greatest single-take of all time, it might not be so bad. This is also one of the greatest movies of all time, just to be clear about it. Children of Men (2006) d.

We really just need somebody to talk to about it. What's that, Dad? You're busy? Okay, I'll just go on the internet and learn some deeply ingrained, problematic attitudes about Michael Jackson, Nazi monsters and Van Morrison tantric sex cults. d.

Misunderstood children? Check. Put-upon mothers just trying their best? Check. An exasperated but committed psychologist just trying to figure out how to reach this kid? Double check. Get your tissues for this one. The Sixth Sense (1999) d. M. Night Shyamalan Starring: Bruce Willis Haley Joel Osment Toni Collette Donnie Wahlberg Mischa Barton Young Cole Sear is haunted by a dark secret: he is visited by ghosts. Cole is frightened by visitations from those with unresolved problems who appear from the shadows. He is too afraid to tell anyone about his anguish, except child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe. As Dr. Crowe tries to uncover the truth about Cole's supernatural abilities, the consequences for client and therapist are a jolt that awakens them both to something unexplainable.

However, it's missing a certain je ne sais quoi, and we try to put our fingers on exactly what it needed. We conclude that classic, whimsical children's film needed more childhood lobotomy, forced imprisonment, Queens pulling their own heads off, and Veruca Salt. Or Fairuza Balk? Potato potato. Return to Oz (1985) d. Walter Murch Based on books by L. Frank Baum Starring: Fairuza Balk as Dorothy Nicol Williamson as the Nome King Jean Marsh as Mombi Piper Laurie as Aunt Em Brian Henson as Jack Pumpkinhead Dorothy discovers she is back in the land of Oz, and finds the yellow brick road is now a pile of rubble, and the Emerald City is in ruins. Discovering that the magical land is now under the control of an evil empire, she sets off to rescue the scarecrow, the tin man and the cowardly lion with the help of her new friends.

The Leprechaun haunted Ryan for his entire childhood, waiting in dark corners, making it unable for him to pee in the middle of the night. If only he had watched the movie when he was seven years old, and seen how stupid, unscary, unwitty, and half-assed this boring, lazy movie is, he wouldn't have wasted another second being scared. The Leprechaun can't even be bothered to turn limericks into dirty rhymes. Nantucket! It rhymes itself! Leprechaun (1993) d. Mark Jones Starring: Warwick Davis Jennifer Aniston Ken Olandt Dan O'Grady steals 100 gold coins from a leprechaun while on vacation in Ireland. The leprechaun follows him home, but Dan locks the him in a crate, held at bay by a four-leaf clover. Ten years later, J.D. Redding and his daughter, Tory, rent O'Grady's property for the summer. When their new neighbors accidentally release the leprechaun, he goes on a murderous rampage to reclaim his gold.
