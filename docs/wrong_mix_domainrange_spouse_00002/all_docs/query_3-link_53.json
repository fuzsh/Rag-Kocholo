This was when the UKFC chairman was the bullish, no-nonsense director Alan Parker, and the organisation’s agenda was clearly populist and commercial. Given Parker’s occasional attacks on the likes of Peter Greenaway, I asked Woodward if he thought there was any place for intellectuals in UK filmmaking. Woodward, with his trademark stonewalling politician’s style, answered with a question of his own: ‘What is an intellectual?” I cite this moment not because Woodward couldn’t answer either his question or mine if he wanted to (and to be honest I can’t remember what I said in reply) but because his question-as-answer is typical of the generally evasive British attitude towards thinking about culture. In most of Europe the idea that people with the facility and inclination to think deeply about the world and our place in it might not be relevant to such a key medium as cinema would be considered ridiculous. Here, however, many UK journalists demean anyone who wants to talk about culture with the term ‘the chattering classes’. In saying this. I’m not suggesting that successful British filmmakers are in any way less thoughtful than those from elsewhere, only that the film scene here has tended to provide fewer opportunities for the kind of ruminative filmmaking perhaps exemplified by our recent essay film season at BFI Southbank. This month, however, it happens that three films with a distinctly intellectual focus are being released; two of them happen to be from the UK and are essays in form. Since one of them, Sophie Fiennes’s The Pervert's Guide to Ideology, featuring Slavoj Zizek, featured on this page last month, I won’t dwell on it too much. But all three suggest that low- and medium-budget cinema is finding fresh ways to deal with complex subject matter. John Akomfrah’s The Stuart Hall Project is a tribute to a figure who is central to the way the New Left looked at culture in the second half of the 20th Century - so much so that for me, as an editor who has published Hall but hasn’t had more than a couple of phone conversations with him, it was a shock, seeing the film, to realise the extent to which the presence of his face and voice in the British media was intrinsic to my own political and cultural In most of Europe the idea that people with the facility and inclination to think deeply about the world might not be relevant to such a key medium as cinema would be considered ridiculous education. Watching Akomfrah’s typically poetic and evocative use of archive material I felt as if Hall had been, without my realising it, my own internalised voice of political reason. To see it is to experience the living answer to Woodward’s question. The contrast between Stuart Hall and the philosopher Zizek couldn’t be more extreme. Where you feel Hall is as careful about what he doesn’t say as what he does, Zizek is seemingly incontinent. The pleasure and difficulty of watching him comes as much from provocation and irritation as from any conviction that something hidden is being revealed. One image from The Pervert's Guide is of Zizek lying on a bed similar to the one Travis Bickle uses during the phase of Taxi Dnuer where his mind is focusing on his cockamamie mission to save Jodie Foster’s child prostitute. It’s perhaps not that strange that Zizek should choose to mirror Bickle lying down while airing his constantly excited views. But I am curious that the image matches another from our third film, Margarethe von Trotta’s Hannah Arendt ‘Biopic’ might be as demeaning a misnomer, where this film is concerned, as ‘chattering classes’. The film is mainly concerned with the German-Jewish philosopher Arendt’s fascination with the trial in Israel of Adolf Eichmann, one of the primary architects of the Final Solution. Yet primarily Hannah Arendt is a conventional ‘one woman alone’ melodrama, which depicts the precariousness of friendship and academic life in the face of inconvenient truths. What’s unusual is that the film achieves many moments where the process of thinking is represented as drama. I’m particularly taken by the scene in which Barbara Sukowa, chain-smoking as Arendt, lies down on a couch to figure out how she can see off the cascade of virulent criticism that her description of Eichmann as a banal bureaucrat has caused. The film is rigorous enough to enable you to imagine exactly what Arendt is thinking, and Sukowa herself is brilliant. But is this how we see our intellectuals: not listening to the person on the couch, but needing to lie there themselves? © October 2013 | Sight&Sound | 5 Rushes NEWS AND VIEWS IN THE FRAME A SERIES OF STUMBLES Draughtsman’s contract: Richard Williams (with Vincent Price) at work on The Thief and the Cobbler How one young animator drew rich inspiration from the divergent yet complementary styles of Norman McLaren and Richard Williams By Mikey Please A series of stumbles can look like running. That’s how it feels to try to become good at something new. We are forever tripping up, delaying the moment of impact just long enough to trip up all over again. Awkward, gawky and bleeding at the knees, but somehow moving forwards. This to me is good learning: embracing a string of screw-ups from which you can skim some sense of progress off the top. In the moment, it might feel like nonsense, but looking back you can see the journey. I didn’t study animation in a formal setting. What I did have was a book. Thehook on how to animate: The Animator’s Survival Kithy Richard Williams. The title is misleading. It won’t teach you how to convert your inkwell into a nutritional stew, or splint your aching fingers with a pencil and rubber band. No. It is the Manual of Movement. For the believers, it is the Bible on how to bring the inanimate to life. In an art form this young, no set of rules can be definitive. But these principles, gathered from half a century working with industry legends such as Ken Harris and Milt Kahl, distilled with Williams’s wit and craft of hand, comes pretty close. Williams’s own work, from his first film The Little Island (1958) to Who Framed Roger Rabbit (i 988), is a testament to the honing of a craft. Learning with little steps, from project to project, all the way up to absolute mastery. Animation continues to unveil its secrets. We know when it works: Bambi on the ice, Mrs. Incredible - Elastigirl - playing hot-potato with a telephone. We are still unearthing the mechanics of why it works. They are a set of physical laws unto themselves. Making something look lifelike will not necessarily make it look alive. Like the annoying collector who buys the paint palette but ignores the painting. I’m often more interested by what goes on behind the scenes. Animated films can be a medley of several practices: music, mathematics. ON OUR RADAR Australia: Shifting Sands This BFI Southbank season, from 19 September-8 October, explores how landscape has informed Australian cinema, and the ways indigenous people have been seen on screen, through films including ‘Walkabout’ (right) and ‘The Last Wave’. Cambridge Fiim Festivai This year’s festival opens on 19 September with ‘Hawking’ (right), a film about the life of Stephen Hawking, which the distinguished physicist will attend. Among the many intriguing strands is a programme entitled ‘Eccentric Britain’, on 27 September, celebrating the work of the British documentarist John Samson, director of ‘Dressing for Pleasure’ and ‘Arrows’. 6 I Sight&Sound October 2013 ANATOMY OF A MOVIE BLUE JASMINE Rabbit, run: Who Framed Roger Rabbit shows Richard Williams’s absolute mastery of the form photography, performance and many others. For my own practice, hand in hand with the science of movement comes optical trickery. Cue segue to Norman McLaren, painting picture and soundtrack by hand directly on to filmstrips, running them through Steenbeck editing machines. Norman had synaesthesia, a neural cross-wiring that caused him to involuntarily visualise colour and movement when listening to music, a true smooshing of sight and sound. Hence he was an experimenter, searching for ways to express this sensory crossover through technical combinations of his own. He discovered his own set of principles over 6o short films, and they sit parallel with, but not contrary to, Williams. He compressed time directly on to filmstrip, showed echoes of movement in Muybridge-like overlays and made soundtracks without making a sound - his own dialect of the same language. McLaren and Williams have much in common, both coming from a painting background and being frustrated by its limitations. They share an absurdist humour and playful timing, sheer ambition and dedication to deciphering the language of movement. Both were adamant that animation is not a genre but a technique. So it was that these two maestros, and their divergent but complementary approaches to animation, were the signposts on my own clumsy stumble towards trying to become good at something new. I had grand plans to pontificate about this with Richard when I got to meet him earlier this year. Thankfully, he skipped the bullshit, got excited about the concluding episodes of Breaking Bad, and we spoke about that instead. “What will Walt do? Will he get away with it? Perhaps he’ll start a secret life on witness protection as the Dad in Malcolm in the Middle?’ I’m glad we did, and happy to say that we both get to find out, very shortly. © O A Richard Williams retrospective will show at the Encounters short film and animation festival in Bristol (17-22 September).

October 2013 | Sight&Sound | 9 RUSHES OBJECT LESSON DRAMATIC SPECTACLES The wearing of glasses in films, particularly broken ones, suggests vulnerability and the primacy of intellect over physicality By Hannah McGill Broken spectacles still in place over eyes make for a powerful motif. The screaming nurse in shattered and bloodied pince-nez rates second only to the imperilled baby carriage as an indelible takeaway from the Odessa Steps massacre sequence in Eisenstein’s Battleship Potemkin (1925). Sam Peckinpah’s Straw Dogs (1971) made an icon out of Dustin Hoffman in smashed specs, not least by deploying the image on its poster; that the 2011 remake directed by Rod Lurie copied the shot for its own publicity indicated that its impact was undimmed, or at least that the visual idea was usefully familiar, even to a generation of moviegoers who didn’t know the original film. Indeed, the image was also lifted for a poster for Tyler Perry’s 2009 ensemble musical/melodrama/ romantic comedy/whatever those things are that he makes, I Can Do Bad all bp Myself Also compounded in the iconography of busted glasses are Bill Foster, the white-collar vigilante played by Michael Douglas in Falling Down (1992); Harry Bemis, the unfortunate bibliophile played by Burgess Meredith in the celebrated 1959 Twilight Zone episode Time Enough at Last’; and the put-upon Piggy in Lord of the Flies, played by Hugh Edwards in the 1963 film and by Danuel Pipoly in the 1990 version. Younger audiences might predominantly associate iconic eyewear with another English schoolboy, Harry Potter. Though Harry’s glasses tend to be preternaturally hardwearing, it’s an early indicator of his friend Hermione’s intimidating resourcefulness that she knows a spell to fix them when Harry breaks them on the Hogwarts Express in the early scenes of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone(2ooi). Doubtless the image of broken eyeglasses resonates partly for the same reason that the eyeball-slicing scene in Buhuel’s Un Chien Andalou (1928) endures so: the queasiness stirred by the juxtaposition of a soft eyeball with a sharp implement must be as close to universal as any predicted audience response could be. The individual still wearing his or her smashed glasses is in a situation so dire that he or she can’t or won’t protect his or her eyes. But there’s more to the unsettling power of the idea than just glass-near-eye. Spectacles indicate the triumph of human ingenuity over Tyler Perry spoofed the iconic Straw Dogs poster The queasiness stirred by the juxtaposition of a soft eyeball with a sharp implement is as universal as a response could be Michael Douglas as Bill Foster in Falling Down DUSTIN HOFFMAN iDMLWLVXlWCBi j frmMbt tUlMX Shards in your eyes: Hoffman’s character’s glasses provide a clear indicator of his unmanliness 10 I Sight&Sound October 2013 THE FIVE KEY... GILBERT TAYLOR FILMS nature’s defects - a step towards cyborg living - but also the vulnerability of the human creature unable to function effectively without a fragile manmade device to improve his or her chances. In its protagonist David Sumner, Straw Dogs gives us a man whose bespectacled state - like that of Superman’s alter ego, Clark Kent - provides a clear visual indicator of his unmanliness. David’s priorities are intellectual, not physical; he needs other men both to renovate his home and - according to the troubling implication of the film’s distinctly ambiguous ‘rape’ scene - to have sex with his wife. Both Bill Foster in Falling Down and Harry Potter, in their different ways, represent defiant reinventions of the unmanly glasses- wearer. “The person in the books who wore the glasses was always the brainy one and it really irritated me,” Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling has said. “I wanted to read about a hero wearing glasses.” Whether Bill Foster is a hero depends on perspective, but certainly his rebellion against life’s petty injustices entails an aggressive rejection of the behaviour society expects from people who look like him. The trope of the thinking person whose glasses represent self-imposed separation from carnal, animal spontaneity is commonly applied to female characters, too, via the removal of glasses and shaking loose of hair to reveal the fox beneath. Now, Voyager and The Big Sleep (1946) feature famous takes on this trope, which is so ingrained that it seems to have been parodied more than it was ever played straight. “It always works in the movies,” says Gig Young in That Touch ofMink(ig62), when removal of glasses and a bun leaves a plain secretary no less plain. Midge in Vertigo (1958), played by Barbara Bel Geddes, is a poignant example of the glasses wearer who is never seen clearly by the object of her desire, James Stewart’s Scottie. Scottie is unamused - and cruel - when Midge clumsily jokes on their unaligned obsessions by painting a picture of her own pert, knowing, bespectacled face on the body of Carlotta Valdes, a long-dead prop in the plot to seduce and mislead him. Glasses, of course, don’t always indicate that a character sees everything clearly. Pince-nez feature in Battleship Potemkin prior to the massacre, when the ship’s surgeon is called upon to verify the freshness of meat that the soldiers onboard refuse to eat. Peering through his glasses, the surgeon declares the meat good; but Eisenstein allows us to see from his perspective the maggots I swarming upon it. The soldiers’ rage triggers the I rebellion that in turn draws down the massacre.

How many fanboys who think that cinema began with Star Wars (1977) realise that the man who shot it started out as a camera assistant in the silent era “captivated by the magic smells of film stock, acetone and makeup”? Taylor’s career (1929-94, with additional commercials thereafter) spanned much of film history, and included several milestones. 2 Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1963) Taylor’s reputation as a master of “bounced light” attracted Stanley Kubrick, who wanted the lighting for the war room incorporated in the set design. Despite an often stormy collaboration between two perfectionists, Taylor cited it as his proudest achievement. 4 Repulsion (1965) Roman Polanski gambled a huge chunk of his tiny budget on Taylor’s services, but his choice was amply justified: this terrifyingly claustrophobic experience, its perspectives constantly distorted by wide-angle lenses, is one of the most visually innovative of all horror films. I The Dam Busters (1955) During World War II Taylor filmed German bombing raids for real, so was an obvious candidate to recreate them in the studio, as special effects photographer. The entire film was shot in black and white to make it easier to interpolate actual footage of Barnes Wallis’s bouncing-bomb trials. A Hard Day’s Night (1964) Taylor was faced with two challenges when shooting The Beatles’ first film - a tight schedule and leads with no experience of hitting their marks. But by using multiple cameras and newly introduced zoom lenses, Taylor allowed them room to improvise, a freewheeling approach that suited the film to perfection. 5 Star Wars (1977) George Lucas had little interest in cinematography, and so Taylor was given almost a free hand in designing the lighting. In doing so, he brought an unprecedented degree of hard- edged realism (“I wanted clarity because I don’t think space is out of focus”) to a genre that was normally scrubbed and pristine. October 2013 | Sight&Sound 1 11 RUSHES SEX AND THE CITY Kieran Evans: 1 didn’t want to make a zombie film or a gangster film’ Kieran Evans discusses the importance of Liverpool, landscape and matter-of-fact sex in his feature debut Kelly + Victor By Ashley Clark Wales-bom Kieran Evans has a background in documentary filmmaking, primarily with musical subject matter (including the 2003 Saint Etienne film Finisterre, and 2006’s VasMBunyan: From Here to Before). His feature debut is Kelly + Victor, based on the 2002 novel by Niall Griffiths. It tells the story of a pair of twentysomethings (played by Antonia Campbell-Hughes and Julian Morris) who embark on a relationship punctuated, and increasingly defined by, dangerous sadomasochistic sex games. Evans turns potentially lurid subject matter into a meditative and poetic study of urban alienation, and it is perhaps the first British film since Young Adam (2002) to successfully meld a sensitive attitude to transgressive sexual behaviour with an engaging narrative and compassionate characters. Particularly striking is the way the natural landscapes around Liverpool are used as a dramatic counterpoint to the characters’ physical and emotional constriction. Ashley Clark: You come from a documentary background, so what prompted your switch to fiction filmmaking? Kieran Evans: I like telling stories, whether documentary or narrative. I was trying to find something I could relate to, which said something different. I didn’t want to make a zombie film or a gangster film, I didn’t want to make a traditional British flick. Reading Kelly + Vzctor opened that door, and once it gripped me it didn’t let go. AC: Did you know the author? KE: I met Niall many years ago. I was doing a series of short docs for BBC Wales and was asked what I’d like to make a short about. At the time Niall had just released Grits and his second book, Sheepshagger, was on its way. He has a distinctive Welsh voice, and we had a lot in common - our Welsh-Irish parentage is similar and we’re both huge Liverpool fans - so I wanted to work with him. We started work on a short called Wanderlust, and we really bonded. I went on holiday and he sent me a proof of Kelly + Victor. I read it and loved it, so I was in from the very start. In the meantime I’d met a producer, Janine Marmot, who’d seen a lot of my shorts and docs and thought I should start working towards longer forms. AC: Despite the difficult subject matter you seem to have sought to engage with its more poetic, romantic moments. KE: I didn’t want to get into social realism or anything like that. Kelly and Victor are like ghosts in their own city - almost invisible. They represent a generation of people whose hopes and dreams have been completely smashed. AC: Can you talk about the striking use of music in the film? KE: I was very anti-scoring. Not because I’m against it, but I felt this film was all about moods which could be generated from music that we found. The idea became that the mood could be set by the music that the character Victor finds. When we were editing there were pieces that were becoming motifs; particularly music by a guy called Bill Ryder-Jones and a band called Geese. When I watched - for research purposes, obviously - films featuring a lot of sex, I found that a lot of music scoring the sex was almost chocolate-box stuff, running against what was happening. Kelly + Victor wasn’t going to be a sweet love story, so I needed to find something that worked in terms of making the sex scenes feel unsettling. AC: There’s a sadness to the film, but Victor is always looking for beauty in things, especially in Liverpool, which you shoot with real style and affection. Kelly and Victor are like ghosts in their own city. They represent a generation of people whose dreams have been smashed Antonia Campbell-Hughes in Kelly + Victor KE: Liverpool had to be at the heart of the film; we couldn’t move this anywhere else. There’s something magical about the place. When researching the film, a Scouser friend of mine took me to these amazing places far from the stereotypical view of the city. Ultimately we wanted to show a real Liverpool and show a beauty to it as well. AC: There’s a pronounced contrast between urban and rural in the film. KE: Just five, ten minutes away from these incredible shiny new developments you can see nature and the overgrowth slowly creeping to the heart of the city. I’m amazed British film-makers, save for, say, Ben Wheatley, Shane Meadows, and Andrea Arnold’s Wuthering Heights, don’t tend to use the landscape more. We tend to be trapped in the M2 5. When you travel north and you see these incredible landscapes, you realise its one of the most beautiful landscapes in the world. We need to use it more. AC: How did you approach the f iim’s tricky sexual elements? KE: I still remember the day I watched Nicolas Roeg’s Don’t Look Now, and how blown away I was by that experience and, even in the way he cut it, how truthful it was to the reality of sex. What we were trying to do was make it feel more real. Lor reference points I looked to a lot of Scandinavian cinema; their attitude to sex is more truthful and honest. If you look at the sex scenes in Lukas Moodysson’s Tillsammans [Together\\ for example, they’re all very matter- of-fact, and that’s what we were after. © O Kelly + Victor is released in the UK on 20 September and is reviewed on page 62 12 I Sight&Sound October 2013 the free OEG Classic Movies App for iPad in the app store.

Department for Culture Media & Sport KOBAL COLLECTION (i) RUSHES FALLING FOR THE MOVIES Blue moon: the bike chase in EJ. The Extra-terrestrial expresses cinema’s essence as lighter than light From slapstick tumbles to literal cliffhangers, the act of falling is key to the lure of film, but perhaps only weightlessness is truly cinematic By Mark Cousins A few days ago, I visited Frank Lloyd Wright’s famous building Fallingwater in Pennsylvania, a massive modernist pagoda home perched atop a waterfall, a beautiful Icarus building that should surely fall, but doesn’t Then I drove to Niagara Falls, where a sea-a-second glides to a precipice and then collapses in a roar, in mist: gravity doing its thing, a demonstration piece of the sublime, just like Fallingwater is Lloyd Wright’s demonstration piece. His building says, “Look what I can do.” As I went to these places, I thought of another Falls, the Falls Road in Belfast, where my family comes from: how un-sublime, I reckoned, and then realised that it had its own kind of defiance and power. And then I couldn’t help thinking about falling and the movies. Laurel and Hardy walking along a street: we know there’s a manhole and we know one of them will fall. Charlie Chaplin’s falls. Donald O’Connor doing his ‘Make ‘Em Laugh’ routine in Singin’ in the Rain, falling all over the place. Wile E. Coyote dashing over a cliff, skidding to a halt in mid-air for a moment as he realises that he has run out of ground, then falling to the earth far below (sometimes overtaking falling rocks, which then squash him after his impact). Cinema has been great at such comic falling, in which we’ve seen hubris and, sometimes, when Chuck Jones was directing the Road Runner cartoons, abstraction. But of course, the cliffhanger has been the staple of movie thrillers too. To fall is so visual and perilous. The house in Alfred Hitchcock’s North by NorthwestwdiS modelled on Fallingwater, says production designer Robert Boyle. He exaggerated its cantilever and used its horizontal, striated stonework to give Cary Grant a way of climbing it. The precariousness of Lloyd Wright’s house fitted perfectly into the precariousness of Hitchcock’s world. And think of Abel Gance’s La Roue, in which a guy’s life flashes before his eyes as he dangles from a cliff; or Hitchcock again, in Saboteur, in which Norman Lloyd hangs from the Statue of Liberty, held only by the threads of his sleeve, which slowly come undone; or James Stewart near the start of Vertigo, acting well outwith his diffident naturalistic range as he looks down to where he might fall; or Luke Skywalker falling: demises or the threat thereof, endings or premonitions of the end, the fall as the final fact of life, falling away from life. Nicolas Roeg, Paul Mayersberg and Walter Tevis had David Bowie fall into life, in The Man Who Fell to Earth Like EX The Extra-terrestrial, it was an arrival. Both films showed that falls aren’t necessarily leavings, that the mythology of falling can be about welcome and beginning. as well as leaving and ending, about a new world not an old one. Played full throttle, this thought would make Elliott, not the creature in EX, the foreigner, the terra incognita which we get to know. You don’t necessarily die when you fall, you can be born too, a cute reversal of polarities. Lloyd Wright’s building is just as polar. It worships nature by building around its contours, its rocky formations, yet defies it, defies gravity, by cantilevering tray-like terraces out from the rock, over the falls. So cinema has had its say on the comedy and tragedy of falling, its hubris and myth. What, though, about the beauty of it? I remember loving Peter Greenaway’s 1980 film The Falls, in which he presents us with mini portraits of the lives of 92 people whose names begin with the letters ‘Fall’. The beauty of this for me was the rigour, the grid, the mathematical way Greenaway approached the sci-fi genre. But another British film is more beautiful about falling. Terence Davies’ Distant Voices, Still Lives is a Rilke-like celebration of female, working-class Liverpool but, in the middle of it, there’s a cut to men falling in slow motion through a roof as the title music from Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing plays. Davies has turned a violent act into a cinematic event whose gorgeousness is hard to explain. Perhaps the men look like water Falling in cinema can hejunny tragic, mythic and beautiful and we are all falling from grace and in and out of love falling. The water at Niagara Falls seems to move in slow motion. It is graceful, not panicked, like the men in Davies’s film. But as I write this, something is niggling at me. Yes, falling in cinema can be funny, tragic, mythic and beautiful, and maybe we are all falling from grace, from youth, in and out of love. But, to be honest, when I mentioned Chaplin a few paragraphs ago, I thought not about falling but about him playing at Hitler, bouncing an almost weightless world-balloon up into the air. Now that’s cinematic. And so is Lamorisse’s The Red Balloon, dind?andih.i’s The White Balloon. And suddenly I’m not thinking of Donald O’Connor falling, but the camera rising as Gene Kelly dances in the rain, and all those endings in Hollywood movies when the camera seems to levitate, and the ending of Grease that I loved as a boy, where the car soars up into the air, and the chase scene in E.T where the bike flies across the moon. Thinking of these moments, and loads of others, makes me realise that cinema is closer to flying than falling. Its lack of mass makes it so. It is, surely, lighter than life, as light as light. Its nimbleness in moving through time and space is the thing that bad directors don’t get. It is Einstein, not Newton. Having written this, I drive to the Yale University Art Gallery to see the building, which was designed by Louis Kahn. It’s all concrete and brick, as solid as a Scottish castle, very Newtonian indeed. While I’m there, I have a look at the paintings. Cezannes galore, and Picassos too. Among the best are a trippy Kandinsky picture of a waterfall and two by Courbet, both of waterfalls. When you’re thinking of something, you see it everywhere. © October 2013 | Sight&Sound 1 15 The Industry BUSINESS NEWS & OPINION DEVELOPMENT TALE FILTH Trigger fingers: James McAvoy brings a steeliness to the lead role, playing a foul-mouthed, bipolar, alcoholic, bigoted junkie cop called Bruce The cumulative stress of bringing Irvine Welsh’s book to the screen pushed its producer and director right to the very brink By Charles Gant When writer-director Jon S. Baird suggested to producer Ken Marshall that they should make a film out of Irvine Welsh’s 1998 novel Filth, the latter soon discovered a few reasons for caution. The book - about a bipolar, alcoholic, bigoted junkie cop called Bruce - had already been optioned twice before, the first time by Miramax’s UK offshoot of the time, HAL, which was shut down not long after screenwriter Dean Cavanagh delivered his first draft. Another British producer had tried to give the material more of a genre spin, but that version also failed to get made. Marshall, best known for his partnership with director Paul Andrew Williams on films such as London to Brighton, says: “It was great that Jon was enthusiastic about it, but if it had been shopped around a while then maybe it’s already going to be dead in the water. I’d spoken to a few people, and one agent in particular told me. ‘Don’t touch this, it’s not going to go anywhere.’” The first task was to win the support of Welsh himself, which Marshall and Baird did by flying out to visit the Scottish author at his Dublin home in early 2009, convincing him of their vision over a lengthy pub crawl. But if Baird and Marshall thought it would be easy to find development money to fund a screenplay, they were in for a rude awakening. “The material was difficult,” says Marshall. “The economic climate was challenging. We weren’t really flavours of the month anywhere. It was a story that inevitably would divide people.” After a fruitless year-long search for development cash, the pair decided to write the screenplay on spec, and their luck improved. They had met in New York in 2008, when the director was editing his football-hooligan drama Cass there and the producer was attending the Tribeca Film Festival with The Cottage. The same year, Marshall attended the Inside Pictures course presented by the National Film and Television School with Qwerty Films (the company owned by former PolyGram boss Michael Kuhn); Baird snagged a place on the well-regarded industry bootcamp in 2010. The course includes a week in Los Angeles, where Baird was able to win a five-minute pitch meeting with CAA agent Chris Andrews. The latter promised to read the script, and did. “Chris really lit the flame under the project,” Marshall says. “He got all the other agents at CAA to read it. The next thing we knew, there was all sorts of cast being suggested to us, big names thrown our way, and really that lit the fuse. Jon ended up going back out to LA with Irvine Welsh in tow. They spent a week out there, met different cast, hanging out at the pool... Soho House and all this shit - it was like Entourage.” In the end, a crucial piece of casting was found closer to home, after James McAvoy’s UK agent Ruth Young read the script and saw protagonist Bruce Robertson as a potential strong role for her client. “Initially,” Marshall says, “we were like, James is a bit young, is he right? Is he dangerous enough?” But after meeting him, Marshall, Baird and executive producer Welsh’s concerns evaporated. “By the end of the meeting, we were, ‘this is Bruce’. You could see he had transformed, there was a real steeliness there. James is such a smart guy. We were excited: we got our Bruce. The whole film revolves around this character.” However the casting of McAvoy also brought challenges. He was coming off X-Men: First Class and had a number of major offers. What’s more. 16 I Sight&Sound | October 2013 THE NUMBERS DAVID BOWIE IS HAPPENING NOW he was soon committed to Welcome to the Punch from Shifty director Eran Creevy - was Filth an indie Brit flick too many for the in-demand star? Since the birth of their son in 2010, he also doesn’t usually take roles if partner Anne-Marie Duff is working. Eventually, a narrow window of availability emerged, starting in January 2012. With Jamie Bell now also on board, the only thing missing was finance. The British Eilm Institute, BBC Eilms and Eilm4 - the three main funding bodies that any aspiring UK indie producer hopes to entice - all turned it down. “They didn’t believe in it,” says Marshall. “I think they found it challenging. I think the BEI was worried that this wasn’t the right second film for Jon. I think they maybe thought it was too ambitious - not so much from a production scale point of view, but from a creative point of view.” The project won some impressive pre-sales, notably Lionsgate in the UK, Icon in Australia and Metropolitan in Erance, but there was still a gap, which was ultimately plugged by Maven, the new company launched by producers Trudie Styler and Celine Rattray. Along the way, the film had picked up investment from sources in Germany, Belgium and Sweden, but at a price: they needed to shoot and spend money in all these countries. With Creative Scotland also on board, Marshall was disappointed that salaries for Scotsmen Welsh, Baird and McAvoy wouldn’t count as Scottish spend, since none are resident in the country. With the shoot starting-date of 23 January 2012 looming and finance yet to be finalised, Marshall There were moments where you’re standing on a platform edge on the tube and thinking, I can understand how people jump had no option but to start hiring crew for the industry-standard six weeks of pre-production. “To cashflow our prep, Jon and myself and friends and family were loaning us money. I can safely say that Jon and I had the worst Christmas period of our lives. There were moments where you’re standing on a platform edge on a tube station and thinking, I can understand how people jump. It was so nerve-wracking. The crew in Scotland had been burnt before. We had a great crew, but they were understandably dubious. It was really touch and go. I remember December 2 3, Jon and I transferring our own money to pay crew.” Casting went down to the wire, with Eddie Marsan joining a month before the shoot began and Jim Broadbent the week before. With so many financing partners, the legal process dragged on. “We didn’t close the finance until four weeks into the shoot,” says Marshall. “It was a small miracle we managed to keep going. Cashflow was dire. The one thing that kept me going was seeing the rushes, and how great they were, how amazing they looked, what an amazing performance James was putting in, and what a fantastic cast we had. Because I wouldn’t want to wish that experience on anybody.” © O Filth is released on 4 October and is reviewed on page 73 By Charles Gant One of the unintended consequences of the conversion of cinemas from 35mm to digital is the rich mix of alternative content that now regularly plays in them, beamed by satellite from venues as diverse as the New York Metropolitan Opera, Glyndebourne and London’s National Theatre. Such performance pieces naturally lend themselves to the cinema space, but more surprising has been the fast-growing audience appetite for seeing art and museum exhibitions on the big screen - events that by their very nature are presumed to be static. It was less than two years ago that London’s National Gallery presented Leonardo Live, an exclusive preview of its Da Vinci exhibition, distributed by Picturehouse. Says the latter’s head of commercial development Marc Allenby, “Expectations were very modest. It was very much: ‘Will this even work as a concept, can an exhibition be brought to the cinema screen as a live event’? The take-up from cinemas was quite sceptical.” Initially booked into a modest 60 cinemas nationwide, audience demand ensured a much wider encore release after the Da Vinci exhibition closed. Cinema showings of the British Museum’s Pompeii and the Royal Academy’s Manet and Munch exhibitions followed. Now we have just witnessed David Bowie is happening now, a special event created for the closing night of the Victoria and Albert Museum’s sellout show. Box office for alternative content events does not appear in the official reports compiled by data collector Rentrak, and distributors and rights holders can be cagey about disclosing results, so it’s a reflection of the growing solidity of this sector that Picturehouse quickly published numbers for the David Bowie event. A robust 217 screens carried the live presentation, delivering £261,000, with repeats at press time taking the total gross to £294,000. Profitability remains more of a conjecture since unlike a performance, the live event has to be specifically created - produced by Done & Dusted in this instance, with fans including Hanif Kureishi, Michael Clark and Jeremy Deller offering their perspectives on the night - and then there are the usual digital transmission costs. As for ticket pricing, the premiums associated with high- end performance content are not achievable. Explains Allenby, “Certainly with David Bowie and Leonardo Live, there was a real aspiration to keep the ticket prices in line with the actual exhibition, or lower, even when it’s sold out.” Despite the success of repeat screenings, Picturehouse believes the live aspect remains crucial. “It grounds the event,” says Allenby. “It gives it focus, purpose and a position as to: why now, why Tuesday 7pm? Also it energises people to buy tickets for it: there’s the immediacy and the fact that it’s not going to run and run.” At press time, an international rollout for David Bowie is happening now was still being negotiated, due to rights clearances for content. Comments Allenby, “That’s probably the biggest barrier to new strands of content. It’s not that there’s any unreasonable or difficult conversations to be had, as much as it’s a process that needs to be undertaken months or even years before the live event in many cases.” With David Bowie, Picturehouse identified the exhibition as a suitable live event as soon as it was announced last September, and started working on it with the V&A. But not all successes are so predictable. Says Allenby, “It’s more difficult when you have got something that’s suddenly successful and you think, we’re under-exploiting it, and you have to get the rights in retrospect. It can mean some events that should be alternative content events in cinemas aren’t being done because it’s too complicated at the stage when it’s identified. That’s the fundamental shift that needs to happen to see more interesting and diverse content coming through.” © The man who sold the world: the live event was created for the last night of the V&A’s sellout show October 2013 | Sight&Sound 1 17 THE INDUSTRY HOW IT WORKS LIVE AND KICKING IN PRODUCTION BFI FILM FUND INSIGHTS Does the recent success of live alternative content events in cinemas suggest a way forward for independent releases? By Ben Roberts Remember when going to the cinema was a big deal? I remember my parents announcing they were taking us to see E.X at the three- screen Cannon in Coventry, one of just three cinemas in town at the time and the only screen playing the film that I had been waiting to see for what felt like YEARS since its release in America. You couldn’t book seats at the Cannon in 1982, so we queued through two showings before racing through the foyer and up the stairs into the massive screen one, finding four seats wherever we could amid the popping of Kia-Ora lids. I’ll put some of this down to nostalgia, but there’s no doubt that for all the decades-long investment in better cinema sound, picture and seating, the experience has dulled for me as online booking for hourly screenings in half-empty barns became the norm. Yes, I like to watch films with 400 other people, and I like to queue for the privilege. I like an event. And I hope the films that we at the BFI fund will become such events. So I was fascinated - and agitated - when our distribution team presented figures on the recent rise in popularity of alternative content and live event screenings, which are represented and marketed by the Event Cinema Association. Alternative content includes everything from sport and music concerts, to ballet, opera and theatre. Exhibitors like it because they can charge a high price (£i 5-£2o) for tickets that often sell out in advance. It also brings new customers into screens operating well below capacity. The producers and audiences like it because it brings events out of London and takes them nationwide. As theatrical admissions have levelled out, the growth of this market has been impressive. In 201 2, more than 130 events screened at UK cinemas, collecting box office in excess of £i 2.5 million. Picturehouse Cinemas, also one of the biggest distributors of alternative content, has said that it accounts for 12% of their box office. Kenneth Branagh’s Macbeth, the British Museum’s ‘Pompeii - Live’ and a live event from the V&As ‘David Bowie is’ exhibition, have all screened recently in more than 200 cinemas. But the daddy of them all is the NT Live performance of The Audience, written by Peter Morgan and directed by Stephen Daldry which grossed more than £ I million from just one showing on one day. Around 80,000 people watched sold-out shows across the UK, and a further 30,000 in the US. Is the consequence of wider releases a lower screen average and a more leisurely take-up of film? 18 I Sight&Sound | October 2013 Walk the line: when cinema trips were a big deal The appetite of exhibitors and audiences for alternative content could be intimidating for producers and distributors of specialised film. After all, these are cinema screens - they should be showing films! But it provides some insights into audience habits, and some food for thought regarding release patterns for independent film. For many years the mantra of the BFI’s Prints and Advertising Fund has been wider, day-one access for specialised film. In a busy market where films live or die on their opening weekend, distributors are hedging their bets with more screens, and we have encouraged them to do so. I’m sure that both Frances Ha and Wadjda have benefited from this approach in recent weeks. And yet... is the consequence of wider releases a lower screen average and a more leisurely take-up of film? One exhibitor told me last week he resents distributors planning for high screen averages - not surprising since cinemas often have to pay a higher rental on busy screens - but I suspect wider releases are diluting the “must- see-now” proposition for smaller films. Some years ago at Metrodome we settled on a risky restrictive release strategy for Donnie Darko. The theory was that the buzz during and after a talking-point film would be multiplied both by the number of people sharing it in a room and the number turned away, and, for that film at least, it worked. The market has changed dramatically since then, but audiences are gravitating towards film events. Companies such as Secret Cinema began ‘eventising’ films a few years ago with considerable success, but these events are clandestine, often retrospectives, and mostly confined to London. In first run, we have seen a rise in applications that have satellite premieres and Q&As at the core of their release. Stone Roses: Made of Stone took nearly half of its £500,000 gross from its premiere event, and Ben Wheatley’s see-it-everywhere event release of A Field in England generated audiences for a film which would have otherwise struggled to reach beyond a hard core of fans. Audience access to specialised film is one of the BFI’s biggest priorities. But perhaps ‘access’ could be open to wider interpretation. For all the access that more screens and day-and-date video-on-demand releases provide, I wonder if the majority of specialised films released today can ever match the success of The Audience. © @bfiben • Justin Kurzel, the Australian director of Snowtown, has replaced Natalie Portman with Marion Cotillard as Lady Macbeth in his adaptation of Shakespeare’s tragedy. Kurzel follows in the footsteps of Orson Welles and Roman Polanski in adapting the play for the big screen. Cotillard stars alongside Michael Fassbender as the murderous king. • Mohsen Makhmalbaf, who lives in exile in the UK having left Iran after the 2005 election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has just announced his first English-language feature. Entitled The Ptesident, it is based on an old screenplay by the director which focuses on a deposed dictator on the run in a fictional Caucasus state he once ruled. • Clint Eastwood is in talks to replace Steven Spielberg at the helm of American Sniper, a biopic of Chris Kyle, the most lethal marksman in US military history. The screenplay is based on the Navy SEAL’S autobiography, written a year before Kyle was killed on a shooting range by a fellow Iraq War veteran. Spielberg reportedly departed the project over budgetary disputes but Bradley Cooper, who was slated to play Kyle, is expected to stay in the role. • Richaitl Linklater’s upcoming feature Boyhood, which the director began shooting in 2002, is reportedly finally nearing completion. The film ambitiously chronicles a boy’s life between the ages of six and 18 and continues the director’s fascination with filming characters over extended periods of time. The feature is to be stitched together from shorts Linklater has filmed and stars Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette as the boy’s parents. • Spike Lee (below) abandoned traditional funding streams for his latest project and followed many a fledgling filmmaker by putting it on the crowd-funding site Kickstarter. Michael K. Williams (The Wire, Broadwaik Empire) and British actress Zaraah Abrahams are set to star in his untitled thriller about “human beings who are addicted to blood’’. The film, which Lee describes as “a new kind of love story - and not a remake of Biacuia”, surpassed its goal and raised nearly $1.5 millon (including a $10,000 donation from Steven Soderbergh), making it the third-largest feature ever funded on the site. produce suck it and see: buy your cds, dvds & books from fopp - if they suck we’il give you a swap or your loiiy* bristol college gieen // Cambridge Sidney st // edinburgh rose st // glasgow union st & byies Id // london covent garden & gower st // manchester brown st // nottingham queen st *This offer applies to all cds, dvds and books instore and is only available on production of a valid receipt dated no more than four weeks from the time of your original purchase.

It is the day after the world premiere of Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa, the comedy starring Steve Coogan as the hapless Norfolk DJ. This is the first in a number of features backed by BBC Films being unveiled in late 2013. Stephen Frears’s Philomena, also starring Coogan, this time alongside Judi Dench, is due for release in early November after a Venice Festival premiere. Ralph Fiennes’ The Invisible Woman, about the love affair between the actress Nelly Ternan and Charles Dickens, is premiering at the Toronto Festival. Disney’s Saving Mr. Banks- developed by BBC Films and starring Tom Hanks as Walt Disney (the first-ever screen portrayal) and Emma Thompson as P.L Travers, author of Mary Poppins - should be in cinemas just after Christmas. From Partridge to Disney, from Norwich to Hollywood, BBC Films covers all the bases. Its head, Christine Langan, has a relatively modest budget at her disposal - £ 1 1 million a year to cover everything from investment in development and production to administration and salaries. Nevertheless, BBC Films - along with the BFI and Film4 - is, as Langan points out, one of the bedrocks of the UK film industry. A small army of BBC workers from several departments is crammed into the seventh floor offices and everyone is obliged to hot desk. Still, Langan is delighted to be in Portland Place, a stone’s throw from Soho, rather than in BBC Films’ old base far away in White City, West London. Now, she is close to the filmmakers the BBC works with, only a short walk from their editing suites and post-production offices. Langan also says she is heartened by the enthusiasm that the Beeb’s new director- general Tony Hall is showing for film. Langan, 48, is from a working-class North London background. As a kid she used to watch old Charlton Heston and Clark Gable movies with her mother, but had no sense until later that she would herself end up working in the film business. A teacher encouraged her to apply for Oxbridge and she ended up studying English literature at Cambridge University in the mid-1980s. After that, she started looking for work in film, finding that a Cambridge degree was not much immediate help. She talks a little forlornly of walking round Soho, knocking on doors of what she thought were film companies and asking for jobs. She worked as a receptionist from 8am till 2pm and spent her afternoons looking for film work. She did film reviews for a Radio 2 cinema programme and was an intern for Stuart Urban (An Ungentlemanly Act, Our Friends in the North), helping produce corporate films. An important early job was working as an assistant to Tessa Ross, now head of Film4 but then running the National Film Development In the driving seat: Christine Langan Fund (which was part of British Screen). Here, Langan began to refine her script-editing skills. “I had a full-time job as Tessa’s assistant but I was able to read a lot of scripts and write coverage [summary and analysis],” she says. Every six weeks, the panel that decided NFDF funding - including Shawn Slovo, Jack Rosenthal and George Faber - would meet. “I’d nip out to Marks & Spencer and get the biscuits. I’d get the photocopying done. But I would also sit there when the teams came in to pitch. It was incredibly informative.” Langan recalls that she “drank in” knowledge from these pitching sessions. Eventually, an opportunity came up to work as a script editor for Granada in Manchester. Langan took it and found herself “on the corridor where they make Coronation Streef. Langan worked on the daytime soap opera Families, created by Kay Mellon Another early assignment was on RikMayall Presents, a TV comedy drama series shot Ifs tough to come into this arena from a working-class background. I was reallp overwhelmed how middle-class the media was on film and produced by Andy Harries. Soon, Langan moved back to London to take a job at Paramount, but when her boss resigned shortly afterward, the department folded and she was left “high and dry”. She therefore went back to work with Harries at Granada: “I am eternally grateful to him. He is brilliant with young people. He throws them in at the deep end.” During her time with Harries, she not only further honed her script development skills, but learned about editing and producing as well. She worked with the writer Mike Bullen, first on a one-off romantic comedy. The Perfect Match, about a football fan who proposes to his girlfriend live on the big screen during the FA Cup Final, and then on the comedy drama Cold Feet (iggS-2oof), described by critics as the British answer to America’s Thirtysomething. After a rocky start and unfavourable scheduling, it became a big popular success over a five- year run. Langan describes the series as her “first real experience in the driving seat”. She went freelance, producing romantic comedy series Rescue Me (2002), scripted by David Nicholls (One Day), at Tiger Aspect for BBC One. She directed the final episode herself. The series wasn’t a success. She returned to work with Harries again, this time hooking up with writer Peter Morgan and director Stephen Frears to make the political drama The Deal (2003), starring Michael Sheen as Tony Blair and David Morrissey as Gordon Brown, broadcast to considerable acclaim on Channel 4. The same team went on to make The Queen (2006), for which Langan, Harries and Tracey Seaward shared a Best Picture Oscar nomination. She joined BBC Films in 2006. Since then, she has overseen such films as The Damned United, Fish Tank (froth 2009) and My Week With Marilyn (201 1). She is one of the most influential executives in the UK film industry - and one of the best connected. Ask the BBC Films boss about recent research from the BFI Stats Yearbook which suggests that women film writers and directors are under- represented in the UK industry and she gives a measured response: “It’s tough for everyone. It’s tough for young men and for young women. Like anything else, you need role models. When you see a woman directing, it becomes more achievable for a woman to direct.” At the BBC, Langan says, she is “surrounded by women in great jobs”. But class remains an issue: “I think it is tough to come into this arena from a working-class background... I was really overwhelmed when I really got into the media at how middle-class it was. It didn’t obviously feel like that in Manchester, working with people like [writers] Paul Abbott and Kay Mellon For some reason - 1 guess it is to do with, frankly, soap - [there was] the enjoyment and drama through ordinary voices and the lives of ordinary people.” Langan believes there is “in the pure creative world of writers and so on, a really mixed array of people”, but that “the infrastructure seems to be made up of certainly very well educated people, often quite privileged people... I think any kind of scholarships and paid placements that can be set up should be. We really need to capture society as it is.” © October 2013 | Sight&Sound | 21 Jerzy Skoli vl/ OFFp'ul cdmERa international festival OF \\NOEPENOENT CINEMA IVlay 2-11, 2014 Krakow, Poland Scan this code to download our free app www.offpiuscamera.com ^ Js, REGIONAL PROGRAMAAE NATIONAL COHESION STRATEGY Matopolska KRAKOW Region EUROPEAN UNION EUROPEAN REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT FUND Festivals LOCARNO THE LEOPARD SPRINGS SURPRISES Going the whole Hogg: Viv Albertine and Liam Gillick in Joanna Hogg’s ‘unsettling’ Exhibition Now nearly 70, the Swiss festival has not lost its cutting edge - it remains invigoratingly hard to summarise or predict By Carmen Gray Locarno’s 66 th edition kicked off with thunderstorms, filling the Swiss resort town’s cobbled streets with umbrellas in the festival’s trademark leopard-print. Under the mountains near Lake Maggiore, the ten-day August event has never lacked dramatic atmosphere. This year a complete George Cukor retrospective brought guests Faye Dunaway and Jacqueline Bisset, but as usual the focus was on new discoveries rather than red-carpet dazzle. The 20 films in the stylistically diverse main competition included the odd misfire (the catalogue of melodrama cliches that was Une autre vie and the jarringly over-stylised The Strange Colour of Your Body’s Tears) and two daringly innovative, soul-stirring stand-outs. Lav Diaz’s jury got it right, awarding the Golden Leopard to Albert Serra’s grandiosely eccentric Story of My Death Having previously reworked Don Quixote in Honour of the Knights, the uncompromising Catalan avant-gardist has radically merged the myths of Casanova and Dracula. In a sumptuous 18th-century setting, the idle libertine (a thickly made-up Viceng Altaic, his face gripping in its casual perversity) travels to the Carpathians with his valet. Horror seeps into the masterfully measured atmosphere, as rationalism is colonised by dark romanticism. In a mood of unsettlingly oblique inertia, evidence of bodily disharmony - inexplicable laughter, a strained bowel movement, blood rivulets - proliferates, gathering to a finale of alarmingly memorable force. Joaquim Pinto’s What Now? Remind Me won the Special Jury Prize. The film chronicles a year in the life of the Portuguese director (Raul Ruiz’s former sound mixer) as he trials anti-HIV drugs. Profoundly human, nakedly honest and ambitiously wide-reaching, it stretches back into memory, and experiments with form to weave in philosophical thought from figures such as the poet Ruy Belo, putting Pinto’s illness into the context of the history of viruses and humankind’s domination of animals for agriculture. Footage of Pinto and his partner outdoors with their beloved pet dogs creates a portrait of the natural symbiosis of species that’s full of reflective melancholy, but never sentimental. Notable out of competition was A Spell to Ward Off the Darkness, a collaboration between experimental filmmakers Ben Rivers and Ben Russell. The three-part blend of mystical symbols, commune living and Norwegian metal, shot in the European far north, doesn’t quite hang together but its playful explorations felt fresh. Top prize in the Filmmakers of the Present section went to Manakamana, the debut documentary by Pacho Velez and Stephanie Spray of Harvard’s Sensory Ethnography Lab, has a static camera recording cable-car passengers as they travel above the Nepalese jungle to a temple: it’s a simple conceit that’s mesmerising even if uncomfortably voyeuristic. Back in the main competition, the casual- seeming but meticulously crafted OurSunhi was charmingly irreverent but slight - business as usual for Korean auteur Hong Sangsoo as the film riffs on the constructs we use to define others, through boozy conversations between film graduate Sunhi and her romantic interests. Romanian NewWave stalwart Corneliu Porumboiu’s When Evening Falls on Bucharest or Metabolism disappointed - its laboured, navel- Evidence of bodily disharmony - inexplicable laughter, a strained bowel movement, blood rivulets - proliferates Gripping: Viceng Altaic in Story of My Death gazing string of dialogues, around a director sleeping with his actress, lacking the black wit and brilliant finale of his Police, Adjective. It was thrilling to see British director Joanna Hogg surpass herself with the unsettling, idiosyncratic and darkly witty Exhibition. Dedicated to the modernist architect James Melvin and set in a home he designed, it’s a privileged-class domestic drama, like her previous film Archipelago, but more obviously experimental. Strained artworld couple D and H (convincingly embodied by former punk-rocker Viv Albertine and conceptual artist Liam Gillick) are selling their house. D is reluctant, believing it is filled with spiritual residue. The stark building is filmed as a haunting presence, bringing to mind Kleber Mendonga Filho’s recent Neighbouring Sounds, which likewise linked spatial architecture with urban psychological horror. In comparison, Thomas Imbach’s biopic Mary, Queen of Scots wdiS lifelessly conventional, even while seeking to reinvent the ill-fated monarch as a feminist trailblazer. More challenging was the young rebel, rejecting female bodily decorum, in Wetlands, David Wnendt’s highly anticipated adaptation of Charlotte Roche’s controversial, largely autobiographical German bestseller. The unrelenting gross-out aesthetic, from haemorrhoids to used tampons, pushed audience taste-limits with adolescent glee while staying bubblegum-innocuous. Conversely, Destin Cretton’s Short Term 12 promised little on paper, with its generic plot about a foster-care facility for at-risk teens, but with performances so powerful they totally immersed, it injected fresh vigour into the US indie. Locarno’s made of such surprises. © October 2013 | Sight&Sound | 23 LONG ARM OF THE LORE Mauled by the studio, obsessed over by fans, deconstructed by academics, remade with Nicolas Cage -yet the pagan British weirdness of ‘The Wicker Man’ remains fresh. As ‘The Final Cut’ is released, director Robin Hardy recalls the making of a myth By Vic Pratt Come, it is time to keep your appointment with Rob- in Hardy’s The Wicker Man. Forty years old, the film burns brighter than ever across the scarred terrain of British Cinema. Famously championed by Cinefantas- stateside, as far back as 1977, as “the Citizen Kane of horror”, it took longer to ignite at home, but nowa- days regularly ranks high in best film polls, with its star, Christopher Lee, having declared that in it he gave his greatest performance. Certainly his Lord Summerisle - forever statuesque in natty sports jacket and yellow polo neck atop that Scot- tish island cliff, arms raised, fingers strangely crooked, hair flying in the wind, in front of the flaming you-know- what - has become familiar enough that he might con- ceivably challenge The Count as the part for which Lee is best remembered. Which doubtless pleases him no end. Despite all this, back in the dark days of the British film industry of the early 1970s, The Wicker Man, unloved and unwanted, was condemned by the very company that released it as “hellishly difficult to market.” Great chunks were chopped to make it a supporting feature, ignominiously shoved out on the bottom end of a double bill with Don’t Look Now. It wouldn’t have been surprising if - like many other difficult-to-label British features that litter that awkward decade - it had quietly faded into 24 I Sight&Sound | October 2013 October 2013 | SightSiSound | 25 ROBIN HARDY THE WICKER MAN © obscurity; but it didn’t. A legend grew around The Wicker Man, one perhaps more complex than the ingenious narrative at its heart. Its cause was taken up by a passionate band of fiercely dedicated aficionados, initially in the USA, then back in Blighty, all proudly wielding its undeserved neglect like a banner. Cut into more versions than anyone can keep track of, the film has a production history that’s shrouded in mystery and confusion. Those in the know still argue over the running times and respective merits of the ‘short’, ‘medium’ and ‘long’ Wicker Man. It became the text- book ‘cult’ movie, with word of its charms spread from fan to fan, in an analogue age, via whispered rumour and fanzines, back when your only chance of catch- ing a forgotten film was if it turned up on telly late one night. And it was a 1 988 BBC screening, with which Alex Cox launched his cult cinema series Moviedrome, that finally brought The Wicker Man home. They were supposed to be showing the ‘long’ version for the very first time; but instead they showed the ‘medium’. It was all very mysterious. The flames of fascination were fanned once more. Now, four decades since release, reappraised, scru- tinised, analysed, deconstructed and obsessed over, it is the subject of painstakingly researched books and worthy academic treatises, and it features on the media studies ‘A level syllabus. You can buy the soundtrack - an essential purchase - or the Hollywood remake featuring Nicolas Cage in a bear suit, which is possibly not so essen- tial. With the remastered ‘medium’ version about to see British release for the first time. The Wicker Man teeters on the borders of the mainstream; perhaps elevation to the canon of cinematic greatness waits just around the comer. But in some ways that might spoil the fun. KILLING JOKE Robin Hardy, in his eighties and still going strong, recently completed The Wicker Tree, a long-delayed sequel to the 1973 original, and is beginning the con- cluding part of the trilogy. “The third film is where the gods get their comeuppance. 1 set the whole thing in the parentheses of the last act of Wagner’s Ring cycle. And it’s in a Scottish setting... just to make it more complicated.” Hardy doesn’t believe in making things easy for himself. “1 think of a number of things we can have fun with, and can’t resist putting them all in.” Driven, determined, full of ideas, juggling various projects, grabbing funding where he can, he’s also developing a theme park based on Scottish history. “It’s a new idea of mine and uses all these incredible technologies that are now available to us in movies... to give the illusion that you were there when something extraordinary happened.” Despite the extraordinary things that happened to The Wicker Man all those years ago, and though his origi- nal director’s fee remains all he ever took home for his efforts, he is more than happy to see the enigmatic co- lossus that was his feature debut shuffle slowly into the sunlight of mainstream acknowledgement. “I’m pleased about that,” he smiles. “Not just for myself, but for every- one else who was involved in it.” The film grew out of Hardy’s friendship with Anthony Shaffer (author of Sleuth, screenwriter of Frenzy). Having worked together as advertising agency Hardy-Shaffer (Shaffer produced; Hardy directed), and sharing a dry. understated sense of humour, they combined forces to come up with the idea. “Tony was a great game player. And if you think about Sleuth it’s all about games. Two people playing games with each other. Over the course of our partnership - all those years - we played elaborate games with each other. Some were really very funny, some were appalling.” One ‘game’ saw Hardy, having foolhardily asked Shaffer to suggest a nice quiet spot for a weekend break, duped into booking a hotel in Sicily that just happened to be hosting a German Panzer unit reunion. Arriving, he was greeted by the sound of 900 soldiers hoisting their steins. “Tony had to do some very quick research for that one.” “But think about The Wicker Man. It’s one huge game. We had been aficionados of the Hammer films. They used all the old cliches of the witchcraft thing, holding up crosses, garlic - things the Catholic church invented as propaganda against the still-surviving old religion that they had replaced. We thought it would be quite good to create a society where the actual Celtic religion informed everybody. We went for all the religious and quasi-religious things which informed the mythology of various nations going back, back, back. 1 had a house on a little island on the Thames... Tony came and spent a long weekend in ’7 1 or ’7 2 and we worked out the story there.” It’s quite a story. The Wicker Man sees staunchly Christian police sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) fly to Summerisle, a remote Scottish island, to inves- tigate the disappearance of young Rowan Morrison. Suspicions aroused by locals’ claims that there is no such girl, Howie is led a merry dance by a bizarre assortment of apparently friendly island folk as he attempts to lo- cate her. He is disgusted by the islanders’ overt sexuality - the youngsters enjoy mass alfresco lovemaking on the village green - and horrified by their pagan practices. He finds himself tested by the pub landlord’s daughter. Willow (Britt Ekland), who, pausing from her sacred duty of ushering young men of the island into man- hood, sings a sexy song through the inn wall which has the chaste policeman next door writhing in his pyjamas. Howie encounters Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), the islanders’ charming, pantheistic leader, who has concocted the kidnap as a deception to lure the virginal Howie to his doom. A sacrifice to the sun god, Howie is to be burnt in the eponymous structure, in the hope that the islanders’ crops - recently blighted - will grow again. He - and the audience - only discover this in a masterful reveal in the closing minutes. The film is as elaborately constructed as a Hardy-Shaffer practical joke; but grand- er, darker, and genuinely horrifying. “Every five minutes there was a strong clue,” explains Hardy. “Howie picks up some but he doesn’t pick up others, and the audience has the chance to pick up some and see what’s going on.” As Howie attempts to assert authority over this re- mote territory, humourless straight man to the islanders’ absurd antics, the film is somehow silly and serious at the same time, splendidly possessed of a very British eccentric sensibility. “It’s where Tony and 1 met,” says Hardy. “We enjoyed that sort of humour, that sort of bathos.” The film never leaves Howie to reveal the behind-the-scenes deception; we see the whole thing from his point of view. Never were so many bizarre blasphemies and pagan weirdnesses displayed for one so singularly unable to appreciate them. Never were so many bizarre blasphemies and pagan weirdnesses displayedfor one so singularly unable to appreciate them 26 I Sight&Sound | October 2013 The film was evocatively shot (by Harry Waxman) on location in Scotland - one contemporary reviewer meant it as criticism when he described the “folk custom travelogue” look, but this is precisely why it rings so true. The folk customs, tightly storyboarded by ex-art director Hardy and derived from his study of Frazer’s The Golden Bough, seem very authentic. Some critics have com- plained that they’re not authentic - the sword-danc- ing comes in for particular tut-tutting - but if this is not how the customs were carried out, it is surely how they should have been. Everything is there, from corn dollies and choreographed maypole dances to the more ludi- crous extremes of toads thrust into little girls’ mouths as a cure for sore throats and the gleeful hanging of ‘navel strings’ above the graves of the recently deceased. Perhaps it all seems so real because the ‘old ways’ sit like vivid fissures in the surface of modernity. In the sweet shop, sugar hares sit beneath Emu erasers, next to Sherbet Fountains; in the inn, a psychedelic pin-up poster adorns the ancient ceiling beneath Willow’s bed- room. Summerisle’s trendy sneakers peep out beneath the traditional ‘man-woman’ costume he adopts for the parade. The present is piled on top of the past, evoking a distinctly plausible world of folk tradition. We can enjoy it all, vividly alive before our very eyes, a cornucopia of superstitions made real, without having to read any of those dry old books on folklore ourselves. With the local youngsters beautiful, hairy, hollow cheeked and horny, unashamedly copulating outdoors in slow motion, and even their elders making the most of a particularly permissive society, here, for perhaps the first time in cinema history, we got to see how cool and sexy folk culture could be. The music had a lot to do with it. No library music here, or dreary cod-folk orches- tral stuff; this film was brimful with terrific folksongs, which - in defiance of the real-ale rep of much hey-non- ny-no warbling - were achingly hip and dripped with smouldering sexuality. “1 thought it would be fun and entertaining and probably truthful if we used folksongs,” says Hardy. “Nearly all of Robert Burns’ great poems have been put to music, so we used those, and then there were ones that were cooked up and sounded more Victorian, like ‘The Landlord’s Daughter’.” Behind the soundtrack was the Italian-American playwright and musician Paul Giovanni, who somehow tapped straight into the British folk tradition, to trance-like, hypnotic effect. Seemingly situated somewhere outside the period in which it was recorded, or any period, Giovanni’s astonishing music, fused with Hardy’s beautifully composed imagery, is a major factor in The Wicker Man’s enduring appeal. “Songs like the maypole song tell you what’s going on without the need for a great deal of back and forth dialogue,” says Hardy. “It’s not new - opera has done it for years. But it was new in the sense of the kind of music we used.” But unmusical discord awaited The Wicker Man. Pro- ducer Peter Snell, briefly in charge of British Lion, who had consorted with Hardy, Shaffer and Lee to bring The Wicker Man to the screen, duly delivered the film to his company.
