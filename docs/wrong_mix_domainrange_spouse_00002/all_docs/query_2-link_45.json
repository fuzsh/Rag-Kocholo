THE MAIL cuoMO’5 mr PAY DAY5 ASIA WEEK Jeffrey Toobin’s Profile of Governor Andrew Cuomo is excellent, but it does not reflect his practice of de- ceit (“The Albany Chronicles,” Feb- ruary 16th). In 2012, some of the peo- ple whom Cuomo had appointed to a commission to review the Long Is- land Power Authority’s response to a storm did not endorse the recommen- dation he wanted (that LIPA should be disbanded). His response was to re- write parts of the commission’s final report. In 2013, he claimed that the Moreland Commission would be in- dependent, and could investigate any- one, but when the commission sub- poenaed a firm that had made ads for the Governor’s campaign, Cuomo’s staff demanded that the subpoenas be recalled; he also intervened when the commission sought to subpoena a trade group that had supported him. He ultimately shut down the com- mission before it released a final re- port, as part of a back-room deal with the legislators whom the committee was supposed to be investigating. Cuomo later insisted that the com- mission was under his control, in con- tradiction of his previous statements, not to mention his own executive order. Matthew A. Feigin New York City Toobin mentions Cuomo’s disdain for unions but not the extent to which he refuses to deal with them. I am a professor at Queens College, of the City University of New York. The contract for CUNY professors ran out in the fall of 2010, the year that Cuomo was first elected governor. The union has been attempting to nego- tiate a new contract since then, but the state has not responded with a financial package. Because of the Tay- lor Law, strikes by state workers are illegal. As a result, wages at CUNY have been frozen for the past five years. David Richter New York City When readingjames Surowiecki’s piece on above-market wages, one should note that stagnation in workers’ pay goes hand in hand with the explosion of C.E.O. salaries (“A Fair Day’s Wage,” February 9th). In the past, executives got rich in the course of their careers, not all at once. They were paid to build their companies over time and develop relationships with workers and clients. The rise of the blockbuster payout has encouraged C.E.O.s to go for big cor- porate deals that often have no eco- nomic rationale except to generate bo- nuses for management, and which come at significant societal costs — including extensive layoffs and reduced quality of life in cities that formerly housed cor- porate headquarters and manufactur- ing facilities. But, with tens of mUlions of dollars in golden parachutes and other incentive payments, top executives have little reason to stick around and deal with the aftermath of their decisions. Steven Bavaria Chestnut Ridge, N Y 50CIAL 5TUDIE5 Kelefa Sanneh, in his review of “The Cultural Matrix: Understanding Black Youth,” by Orlando Patterson and Ethan Eosse, seems to reveal the irrelevance of sociology as a discipline to both the understanding of and the solution to problems in the African-American community (“Don’t Be Like That,” Eeb- ruary 9th). Instead of developing clear hypotheses that could lead to testable, robust, and replicable interventions, so- ciology, ostensibly a descriptive rather than a normative discipline, appears to be caught up in doctrinal battles and anxiety over political correctness.

But recently young New Yorkers in groups like Roomful of Teeth (pictured above) have been blazing a new trail, forming intimately scaled ensembles of brave solo singers whose lean timbres resemble those of the early-music and new-music vocal groups of Europe. On March 17, Roomful of Teeth collaborates with the outstanding instrumentalists of the American Contemporary Music Ensemble at the Met Museum’s Temple of Dendur. They will perform \"Drone Mass,” a world premiere by the Icelandic composer Johann Johannsson, whose sleek score for the film “The Theory of Everything” was nominated for an Academy Award.

MUSEUMS AND LIBRARIES Metropolitan Museum “Discovering Japanese Art: American Collectors and the Met” The best collection of Japanese art on the East Coast is housed at the Museum of Fine Arts, in Boston, but this centennial showcase of the Met’s holdings is strong and varied enough that New Yorkers can save themselves the trip. The Met began collecting Japanese art in 1914, but arms and armor formed the bulk of its holdings until 1929, when the widow of the sugar baron H. O. Havemeyer bequeathed the museum an impression of Hokusai’s “Great Wave” — so crisp it’s hard to believe it’s from 1830— and a twelve-panel screen depicting a coursing river with a vivacity typical of the Rinpa school, along with works by Rembrandt and Degas. (Another print collector was Frank Lloyd Wright, who sold the Met his portraits of Kabuki actors when business was slow.) The Met’s curators made frequent visits to Japan after 1945, but the great transformation came in 1975, with the acquisition of some four hundred objects from the Packard collection, a move so ambitious that Thomas Moving, the museum’s director at the time, had to suspend purchases in other departments. One of the best of these works may be the serenest: a Muromachi-era scroll painting of a solitary man trudging through rain, oblivious to the lines of calligraphic poetry falling around him. Through Sept. 27. GALLERIES-UPTOWN “Moderno: Design for Living in Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela, 1940-1978” In postwar Latin America, modern design was more than a look — it was a national enterprise, endorsed by governments undertaking grand schemes of industrialization and urbanization. This robust exhibi- tion highlights the ways in which Brazilian, Mexican, and Venezuelan designers imbricated art, archi- tecture, manufacturing, and craft, first in domestic objects (including the covetable wooden furniture of Venezuela’s Miguel Arroyo), then at the grand scale of Brasilia. Moderno usually meant Bauhausish, but, given national ambitions, tradition had a role to play, too; the Mexican furniture-maker Clara Porset inte- grated woven agave fibres into her designs, and Roberto Burle Marx, the landscape architect behind Rio’s famed modernist gardens, produced bowls and plates painted with folkloric landscapes. But the tour de force here is by the underrated Italian-Brazilian Lina Bo Bardi. As the dictatorship iced her com- missions, Bo Bardi yoked a log to a tripod of branches, fashioning a chair with the rigor of Europe and the verve of Bahia. Through May 16. (Americas Society, Park Ave. at 68th St. 212-249-8950.) GALLERIES-CHELSEA Subodh Gupta The centerpiece of the Indian artist’s new show is humbler and more affecting than his more predictably grandiose efforts: a twelve-foot-wide jumble of salvaged aluminum sinks and other kitchenware, including tiffin boxes and karahi, punctuated by faucets with running water. (The piece gains little from the coy Ma- gritte-Duchamp face-off of its title, “This Is Not a Fountain.”) Gupta is gifted, but he falters when he goes glam: the appeal of gold-plated rods stacked on a wooden table is merely decorative. He’s better at the quotidian scale and intimate mood of a work like “My Family Portrait,” in which worn pots and pans are arranged on racks borrowed from his sister and brother. Through April 25. (Hauser & Wirth, 511 W. 18th St. 212-790-3900.) Chuck Samuels If the Canadian photographer’s sly, meticulously staged self-portraits look familiar, it’s because they’re all based on famous female nudes by male photographers, including Man Ray, Edward Weston, and Helmut Newton. Casting himself as a homoerotic icon, Samuels throws the male gaze back on itself in works that are funny but more than just punch lines. Though he has claimed his agenda is feminist, his critique is confused by narcissism. Still, that doesn’t soften its bite. Through March 28. (ClampArt, 531 W. 25th St. 646-230-0020.) “The Chinese Photobook” This revelatory exhibition, co-cu- rated by the British photographer Martin Parr, rewrites the history of Chinese photography through publications, weaving high art and low bureaucracy into one over- powering panoply. The early days of post-imperial China saw local photographers like Lang Jingshan producing atmospheric landscapes that simulated scroll painting. (He also liked nude women and pandas.) Foreigners like Henri Cartier-Bres- son turned their lenses on China as well; so did the Japanese Army, which published books portraying its puppet state in Manchuria as a happy colony. Propaganda from the early days of the People’s Republic features smiling P.L. A. members and factory workers; with the Cultural Revolution arrived endless smiling Maos and books with such titles as “Medical Workers Serving the People Wholeheartedly.” But truth will out: in 2003, Li Zhensheng published shocking images of public denunciations, which he had been hiding under his floorboards. Through April 2. (Aperture, 547 W. 27th St. 212-505-5555.) GALLERIES-DOWNTOWN Jan Groover The New York photographer, who died in 2011, is best known for her elegantly jumbled still-lifes. These stark, unpopulated landscapes were made in the early eighties, on forays into Brooklyn’s industrial margins. The subjects — warehouse fa 9 ades, parked trucks, empty lots — are far from picturesque, but the plati- num-palladium process Groover used gives the prints an exquisite finish, with skies like burnished silver. Her work recalls the chill, matter-of-fact approach of Robert Adams and Lewis Baltz. Like them. Groover was interested in America the ordinary, which has a beauty all its own. Through March 28. (Borden, 560 Broadway, at Prince St. 212-431-0166.) Lynn Hershman Leeson Since the nineties, the San Fran- cisco-based artist has been best known as the director of some very distinctive films starring Tilda Swinton. But before Leeson trained her lens on the indomitable star she turned it on herself. In 1974, she created an alter ego named Roberta Breitmore, who had her own bank account, credit cards, and driver’s license. It was a private performance without an audience, which was one of Leeson’s points: Was a woman ever really known to anyone but herself? Now that the artist is getting the attention she deserves (a major museum survey just opened in Germany), we are treated to this loose retrospective, which delights with its idiosyncra- sies and philosophical strengths. In addition to Leeson’s looking-glass feminism, there’s an abiding interest in science and the environment, real-world concerns that she renders both otherworldly and strangely familiar in five decades’ worth of paintings, collages, and sculptural tableaux that reject signature style in favor of a wide-ranging and fantastic realism. Through April 5. (Donahue, 99 Bowery. 646-896-1368.) Deborah Turbeville The first New York show devoted to the maverick fashion photographer since her death, in 2013, highlights the atmospheric work she made at Versailles in the early eighties. Given access to areas tourists never see, Turbeville recorded dusty storerooms and broken statuary in mottled, sepia-toned images. The mood is hushed, as if in anticipa- tion of ghosts, embodied by pale, languorous models who waft through the ruined rooms like lost spirits. In keeping with Turbeville ’s style, much of the work is unframed, collaged, or captioned in her own handwriting, like pages from a fragile scrapbook. Through March 21. (Staley-Wise, 560 Broadway, at Prince St. 212-966-6223.) 6 THE NE^ YORILEh, MARCH 16. 2015 u' in 4 TONY AWARDS Q mimMima wfftiritftfw riUCMMICM MincntM =i <L N m CM n ■ > € I JOHN CAMERON MITCHELL HEP^IG ANGRY INCH NOW THRU APRIL 26 ONLY bMk by JOHN CAMERON MITCHELL tntttk A lyrk* by STEPHEN TRASK 4 Lf€H 4 by MICHAEL MAYER t INCLUDING BEST MUSICAL REVIVAL 3 HEOWI6BROAOWAY.COM • ®BELASC0 THEATRE. Ill W. 44TH STREET • ORIGINAL BROADWAY CAST RECORDING AVAILABLE ON A iTunes DANCE DIVINE COMEDY Robert Kleinendorst, of Paul Taylor s American Modern Dance. AS THE CURTAIN RISES on Paul Taylor’s 1985 piece “Last Look” — it will be part of his company’s current season at the Koch Theatre — ^you see, under a low, grimy light, a big pile of God knows what in the middle of the stage. It starts to move. It is a pile of human beings. Slowly, they crawl apart. One man stands out from the others. He rises; he falls; he rises and falls again and again, flinging his arms and legs so violently that he seems to be trying to cast them off his body. The dancer here is Robert Kleinendorst. Much ofTaylor’s best work depends on the performers looking human and inhuman at the same time, and no one in the company looks more human than Kleinendorst, down to the corny sideburns that he says the troupe’s set and costume designer Santo Loquasto is always trying to get him to shave off. (“I can’t. I’ve had them so long I can’t imagine being without them.”) He is therefore perfect as the initial display item in “Last Look.” If a man like this could suffer such a fate, none of us are safe. When Kleinendorst went to college — Luther College in Decorah, Iowa — he intended to make his living in musical theatre, so he majored in vocal performance and took acting classes as well. After a while, it occurred to him that, in order to get a job in a musical, he would probably have to be able to dance, too, so he added dance classes. Of course, he then grew up to be a dancer, but Paul Taylor makes extensive use of his dramatic training. He often gets character roles, especially comic ones. (He does an excellent pimp, with a big, brown, disgusting cigar, in “Black Tuesday”) But the thing that Taylor seems to ask of him most often is an unforced sort of poignance — cousin, in a strange way, to the comedy. In the heart- stabbing “Sunset,” the passage most likely to deprive you of your composure is a duet for Kleinendorst and Michael Trusnovec, as two soldiers going to the front. The men do little reaches and kicks and leaps, often side by side or follow- the-leader. Trusnovec seems to be teaching Kleinendorst something. “He’s a mentor,” Kleinendorst says. “This whole dance is about finding comfort wherever you can before you go off and maybe die. It is this very intimate thing that you can’t express.” They express it. After Trusnovec, Kleinendorst is the company’s most senior dancer. He is forty-one, with a wife (the former Taylor dancer Amy Young) and a child. About half his time is spent on the road, touring. After seventeen years of doing Taylor’s bone- crunching work, he wakes up three to four times a night because of pain. “I can’t dance that much longer,” he says, almost with bewilderment. Go see him now. — -Joan Acocella 8 THE NEW YORItEK, MARCH 16, 2015 ILLUSTRATION BY JONNY RUZZO Paul Taylor's American Modern Dance In its sixty-first year, the company embarks on a major transformation. The Paul Taylor Dance Company was devoted exclusively to the oeuvre of the modern-dance master Paul Taylor; now, under a new name, the ensemble will branch out, presenting works from the early days of modern dance, as well as more recent pieces by younger choreographers. This season includes two guest appearances: the Jose Limon Company will perform Doris Humphrey’s stately “Passacaglia and Fugue,” from 1938, and Shen Wei Dance Arts will dance Shen Wei’s large-scale, abstract “Rite of Spring,” from 2003. But don’t worry, Taylor has not tired of making dances. The three-week season also features a swath of repertory (including the beautiful “Beloved Renegade”) and two new pieces, “Sea Lark”— a collaboration with the artist Alex Katz— and “Death and the Damsel.” There will also be live music, for the first time in many years, provided by the excellent Orchestra of St. Luke’s. (David H. Koch, Lincoln Center. 212-496-0600. March 10-15 and March 17. Through March 29.) NIGHT liFE ROCK AND POP Musicians and night-club proprietors lead complicated lives; it's advisable to check in advance to confirm engagements. James Bay It may not be unusual for unknown musicians to rise to fame via the Inter- net, but Bay, a singer-songwriter from Hitchin, in Hertfordshire, England, has a particularly spectacular story. At an open-mic night in London, an audience member filmed Bay performing and uploaded the foot- age to YouTube. The video caught the attention of Republic Records, and the label flew Bay to New York and signed him. The young crooner has a strong sense of balladry and has since won the hearts of many listeners, along with such accolades as the 2015 Brit Awards Critics’ Choice. Bay’s debut album, “Chaos and the Calm,” comes out next week. (Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey St. 212-533-2111. March 16.) Compagnie CNDC-Angers During the final seventeen years of Merce Cunningham’s life, Robert Swinston was the great choreographer’s right-hand man. Swinston directed the Cunningham company’s farewell tour (2010-11), and since 2013 he has transformed the performing arm of a French choreographic center into a Cunningham offshoot, which now makes its U. S . debut. The format is like that of an Event, Cunningham-speak for a collage of choreography created across decades. New elements include scene design by the French artist Jackie Matisse (granddaughter of Henri) and a score, played live by John King and Gelsey Bell. (Joyce Theatre, 175 Eighth Ave., at 19th St. 212-242-0800. March 10-15.) “New York Spring Spectacular\" It’s been nearly two decades since the Rockettes had a spring show. This one is about an old-fashioned tour guide threatened by technology. Produced by Harvey Weinstein, it boasts vocal cameos by Whoopi Goldberg, Tina Fey, and Amy Poehler; video cameos by 50 Cent, Donald Trump, and Victor Cruz; and live appearances by Laura Diana Krall While Bob Dylan was dipping into Frank Sinatra’s catalogue for his new album, “Shadows in the Night,” the jazz pianist and song stylist Krall was remaking “Wallflower,” a rickety country waltz written by Dylan in 1971 and recorded a year later by Doug Sahm. It’s the title song of her new record, which also includes interpretations of material by the Eagles, Elton John, the Carpenters, and other big acts of the seventies. The album was due to be released last fall, but it was postponed after Krall came down with pneumonia. (March 12: Capitol Theatre, 149 Westchester Ave., Port Chester, thecapitoltheatre. com. March 14: Beacon Theatre, Broadway at 74th St. 212-465-6500.) Keb’ Mo’ Few musicians emblematize the blues like Kevin Moore. During his twenty-year career as Keb’ Mo’, he has won three Grammys, appeared on “Sesame Street,” collaborated with Martin Scorsese for the miniseries “The Blues,” and earned his own Gibson signature acoustic guitar. He even portrayed the legendary bluesman Robert Johnson in the 1998 documentary “Can’t You Hear the Wind Howl?” As closely associated with the blues as he is, folk, pop, jazz, and rock also inform his music, which is as accomplished as it is accessible. (B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 W. 42nd St. 212-997-4144. Mandi 13-14.) Twerps This Melbourne quartet is the latest band from the antipodes with the kind of upbeat, carefree sound that Benanti and Derek Hough. The opening number, set to Taylor Swift, is by Mia Michaels, of “So You Think You Can Dance,” but direction and choreography by Warren Carlyle, of “After Midnight,” give more cause for hope. Jared Grimes, who tapped up a storm in “After Midnight,” appears here, singing and dancing in an artificial downpour. (Radio City Music Hall, Sixth Ave. at 50th St. 866-858-0007. March 12-15. Through May 3.) ABT Studio Company / ABT JKO School On Friday, American Ballet Theatre’s junior ensemble— a transition point between the school and full professional status— presents a program of excerpts and short works by Petipa, Antony Tudor, and Merce Cunningham. On Saturday, the students take over, with an evening that includes Balanchine’s windblown “Valse Fantaisie” and an excerpt from Fokine’s “Les Sylphides.” (Schimmel Center, Pace University, 3 Spruce St. 866-811-4111. March 13-14.) Amanda Selwyn Dance Theatre Selwyn often spins variations on a poetic theme, with individual suggests everyone in the region grew up lazing in the sun, smoking grass, and listening to psychedelic jangle-pop of a certain vintage. Bright, cleanly strummed guitar chords accompany excellent vocal melodies— delivered alternately by Martin Frawley and Julia McFarlane— that stick in your head without becoming cloying after multiple listens. With Ultimate Painting, a darker, sixties-inspired slacker-pop duo made up of former members of the U.K. rock groups Mazes and Veronica Falls.

JAZZ AND STANDARDS Herb Alpert and LanI Hall The trumpeter, sixties pop icon, music mogul, and educational philanthropist Alpert is joined by his wife, the vocalist Hall, for an evening that will draw on his new album, “In the Mood,” which dresses songbook chestnuts in pop-funk finery. To be sure, the hale seventy-nine-year-old won’t ignore the peppy instrumentals that made him a star with his Tijuana Brass ensemble, or “This Guy’s in Love with You,” the Bacharach-David gem that gave him a No. 1 hit in 1968. (Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, Madison Ave. at 76th St. 212-744-1600. March 10-21.) Roy Haynes Time is a slippery commodity in this venerable percussionist’s hands, but he never loses hold of it, and it has been kind to him— he’s still going strong after seven decades of refashioning the role of the drums meditations unspooling like pri- vate thoughts from a larger group dynamic. Her sculptural use of the body is abetted by atmospheric, expressive lighting. “Renewal” is a new evening-length work for eleven dancers, made up of short sketches exploring the theme of reinvention, revisiting and retooling material from earlier pieces. (Tribeca Performing Arts Center, 199 Chambers St. 212- 220-1460. March 13-15.) Martha Graham Dance Company In recent years, most performances by the Graham company have in- volved some sort of explication, so the show-and-tell format of the 92nd Street Y’s Harkness Dance Festival should fit the troupe like a glove. (An old glove, considering the historical connections between the group and the Y.) Preceding a performance of “Cave of the Heart,” Graham’s har- rowing retelling of the Medea myth, dancers will break down movement motifs, demonstrating how Graham’s technique applies to these particular characters.

The trumpeter Roy Hargrove joins him on March 14, and the dancer Savion Glover is on hand on the 15th. (Blue Note, 131 W. 3rd St. 212-475-8592.) Jason Moran The Village Vanguard, a jazz bastion and unofficial temple for the music, is marking its eightieth birthday. The celebration starts on March 10 — with Kenny Barron, Stanley Cowell, Fred Hersch, and Ethan Iverson joining Moran for solo piano performances— and it ends on March 15, with the Charles Lloyd New Quartet. In between, Moran and his Bandwagon ensemble are presiding over programs devoted to the music ofThelonious Monk, poetry (featuring Elizabeth Alexander and Yusef Komunyakaa), folk music, and comedy, reflecting the wide swath of entertainment that originally filled the basement establishment. (178 Seventh Ave. S., at 11th St. 212-255-4037.) Jacky Terrasson The pianist, who has moved in and out of the spotlight since his debut, in the nineties, has a new record, “Take This,” on the recently rebooted, legendary label Impulse! Records. It includes such time-honored jazz classics as “Take Five,” “Blue in Green,” and “Un Poco Loco,” but the nervy stylist isn’t looking to the past— he enlisted a Malian per- cussionist and a human beatbox artist on the album. He celebrates its release March 13-15, at the helm of a quartet. (Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Broadway at 60th St. 212-258-9595.) THE NE^ YORKER, MARCH 16, 2015 9 k k MQVIEJ NOW PLAYING Alice in the Cities In this drama by the twenty-eight- year-old Wim Wenders, from 1974, Rudiger Vogler plays the director’s alter ego, Philip Winter, a thirty- something German journalist on the American scene. Taking Polaroids instead of writing a story, Philip loses his job and has to go home. But first, in New York, he’s thrown together with Alice van Damm (Yella Rottlander), a nine-year-old German girl abandoned by her mother (Lisa Kreuzer), and takes her on an odyssey from Manhattan to Amsterdam and a series of German towns. Philip’s lonely road trip through the land of his fantasies morphs into a quasi-familial road trip through the land of his own unavoidable realities. Here, Wenders crystallizes his style of existential sentimentality and heartwarming blankness. His cool eye for urbanism and design blends a love of kitsch with a hatred for commercialism, a historicist sensibility with a fear of history’s ghosts. Wenders’s New York time capsule includes a look at the ballgame organist playing at Shea Stadium and a glimpse under the Rockaway boardwalk; his Am- sterdam is charmless and grungy, and his German towns blend grim industry and grubby necessity. A jukebox playing Canned Heat, a Chuck Berry concert, and even John Ford’s obituary lend a desperate touch of life to Wenders’s gray continent. In German and English . — Richard Brody (MOMA; March 17.) Bunny Lake Is Missing At first contact with an electric guitar, Otto Preminger, born in 1906, got a shock, which he conveys in this jangled psychological thriller from 1965, set in swinging London. A young American woman, Ann Lake (Carol Lynley), has just arrived with her journalist brother, Steven (Keir Dullea), and her four-year-old daughter. Bunny. On her first day at her new school, young Bunny vanishes, although nobody — neither teachers nor students nor, for that matter, viewers — have seen her. The dapper, ironic Superintendent New- house (Laurence Olivier) takes over the investigation. His imputations regarding Ann’s sanity take over the story, but the film’s real charge lies elsewhere — in Preminger’s view of a jolting, disoriented age of rock and roll. The mental chaos of the times is reflected in the behavior of the local solipsistic eccentrics (including a randy raconteur, played by Noel Coward), the nightmarish images, the backdrop of student protest and political crisis, and the frenzied soundtrack, which features the music of the Zombies. — R.B. (BAM Cinematek; March 15.) Buzzard The second shot of Joel Potrykus’s second feature offers a cinematic high: a five-minute-plus closeup of a pale, scruffy, moon-eyed, blandly insolent young man pulling a fast one. Marty Jackitansky (Joshua Burge) tells a bank officer to close his account and then reopens it immediately for a fifty-dollar new-account bonus. A temp at the same bank, Marty is a brazen master of gaming the system; he returns the bank’s office supplies to a store for cash and calls consumer hot lines to demand refunds — but when he steals small refund checks meant for the bank’s customers, it’s a scam too far. Fearing arrest, Marty goes on the run. Potrykus constructs the character of Marty as an Emma Bovary who’s in thrall to horror movies and headbanger rock, a raging king of anomie and attitude in a suburban wasteland of no future. (The director co-stars as Marty’s only friend, Derek, a super-nerdy colleague). Marty remains a blank even as his violent fantasies break through to reality, but his tenuous connections to his family and the countdown of his scant funds sketch a chilling story. Potrykus’s puckishly outrageous visions are short on insight, but they pack an enduring hallucinatory power. — R.B. (In limited release.) The Fall of the Roman Empire Physically, it’s a milestone: no producer in the decades since has assembled as vast an ocean of extras or as stunning an acreage of plaster as Samuel Bronston did in his Spanish studio, and no director in Bronston’s stable could make better use of it than Anthony Mann did. In the culturally aspiring movie world of 1964, it was possible to film the same basic story as “Gladiator” and actually have the dying Emperor Marcus Aurelius use a phrase like “Pax Romana.” Alec Guinness plays Aurelius as a weary intellectual who wants a Roman peace that all for- eigners can join, not as slaves or as clients but as citizens. Unfortunately for Aurelius, but perhaps fortunately for audiences, Aurelius’ successor, Commodus, played here by the flamboyant Christopher Plummer, forsakes the Pax Romana and turns Rome into an empire of camp. Sophia Loren ups the entertainment level as Aurelius’ daughter, especially when the dashing, heroic Stephen Boyd makes her feel like a vestal virgin again . — Michael Sragow (Anthology Film Archives; March 14.) Fifty Shades of Grey The setting is Washington State, the place where love gets weird. Could there be something in the rain? Boy meets girl, but there’s always a hitch; in “Twilight,” the boy was a vampire, and now, in Sam Taylor-Johnson’s gloomy new film, the girl is swept off her feet, only to discover that the boy wants to tie her up by the wrists. It’s like an R-rated game of Twister. The script was adapted by Kelly Marcel from the golden-tongued best-seller by E. L. James, but not quite adapted enough. Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) remains as dreary as ever, despite the snugness of his torture room and his peculiar habit of sitting down to play Cho- pin, molto adagio, at the drop of a riding crop. As Anastasia Steele, the bashful student who yearns for him, Dakota Johnson strives courageously, and even finds traces of wit in the role, but she still bumps into the old, disheartening question: would the girl adore the boy if it weren’t for his billions, his blinding white shirts, and the ride she gets on his chopper? Warning: the film contains whipping scenes, which some pastry chefs may find distressing. —Anthony Lane (Reviewed in our issue of 2/23 & 3/2/15.) (In wide release.) Focus This comic thriller begins as a twist on the classic crime romance “Trouble in Paradise”: two smooth grifters, the veteran Nicky (Will Smith) and the novice Jess (Margot Robbie), pick each other’s pockets and thus seal a partnership made in heaven. Nicky teaches Jess some secrets and recruits her for his high-class, quasi-corporate criminal team, which moves into New Orleans to fleece the yokels on hand for a Super Bowl-like event. A compulsive gambler who risks the team’s bankroll, Nicky is also a consummate professional who’s unwilling to take a chance on love. But he and Jess meet again later in Buenos Aires, when they’re working lO THE NE^ YORIlEh. MARCH 16. 2015 OPENING CINDERELLA Reviewed this week in The Current Cinema. Opening March 13.

Smith is breezy, canny, understated, and Robbie hides scalpel-sharp wiles behind a poker face, but the writers and directors, Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, submerge the stars’ easy chemistry in a murky stew of clever yet absurd plot twists of a nearly superheroic hyperbole. That sound you hear is the high-fives in the writers’ room, and that, unfortu- nately, is where the filmmakers’ focus remains. With Adrian Martinez, as an able accomplice with no verbal filter, and Gerald McRaney, as a crusty arm-twister with pride in his craft. — R.B. (In wide release.) Gett: The Trial of Viviane Amsalem Ronit Elkabetz is warmly admired but still too little known outside her native Israel. Her work as an actress, in such films as “Late Marriage” and “The Band’s Visit,” suggests that in her ability to compel and hold the eye she has few rivals; her blending of intensity and containment brings to mind the prime of Meryl Streep. Elkabetz, with her queenly profile, would make a daunting Cleopatra; there is no bathos, however, in meeting her, in this latest film, as an embattled housewife. She plays Viviane, who is seeking a divorce from Elisha (Simon Abkarian) after thirty years of marriage, not because of adultery or abuse but simply for lack of love. In her path stands rabbinical law, which demands the husband’s consent — something that the saturnine Simon will not give. The movie, which is the last part of a trilogy, after “To Take a Wife” and “Seven Days,” is written and directed by Elkabetz herself, together with her brother Shlomi. Almost all of the film takes place inside a court- room, at irregular intervals over five years, but there is no sense of drag or slump; on the contrary, the action quivers with tension, impatience, comic heat, and, beneath it all, an irrepressible rage. In Hebrew.— (In limited release.) Maps to the Stars David Cronenberg goes to Hollywood. His latest film lands him in new territory, although the terrors and obsessions that infect his characters are familiar enough. Julianne Moore, unleashed, plays an actress named Havana, who is both plagued by visions of her late mother (Sarah Gadon) and hellbent on grabbing a role in a forthcoming quasi-remake of a movie for which her mother was famous. No less fretful are Stafford Weiss (John Cusack), a self-help guru, and his wife, Christina (Olivia Williams), who can barely cope with their son Benjie (Evan Bird), already a star— and almost a monster — at thirteen. Then there is Havana’s assistant, Agatha (Mia Wasikowska), freshly arrived in Los Angeles and bearing the scars not just of a fire but also of deeper traumas within. What matters here is not the plot, such as it is, but the unsavory knowledge that everything we see— the movie industry, the family unit— is coiled and bent in on itself. Hints of incest and conflagration abound, and the young refer to anybody older than themselves as “menopausal.” Cronen- berg eases through this damaged landscape with his usual aplomb, neither blinking nor shrinking; by the end, despite that composure, you can’t wait to get out of town. With Robert Pattinson, as a chauffeur. Written by Bruce Wagner. — A.L. (319115) (In limited release.) Party Girl This electrifying blend of documentary and fiction draws straightforward dramatic power from tangled relation- ships on camera and off. Angelique Litzenburger portrays herself, a raven-haired, middle-aged, heavily bejewelled hostess at a German strip club. Her frequent client Michel Henrich (Joseph Bour), a retired French miner from just across the border, proposes to marry her, and the core of the plot involves her effort to surmount her own misgivings. The tempestuous Angelique is a mighty force of nature and a study in trouble. She has a mean streak and a hard past, and, in an effort to overcome both and to make a new life with Michel, she circles the wagons, bringing together her four real-life children— including Samuel Theis, one of the film’s co-directors, and her teen-age daughter, who has been in foster care for ten years. A seasoned performer, Angelique is an instant, screen-grabbing star, and her family and friends are relaxed and captivating in their supporting roles as themselves. Theis and the other directors, Marie Amachoukeli and Claire Burger, build a grand and rumbling tale from Angelique’s daily struggles at home and at work. Their intimate revelations of erotic crises and eye for symbolic details suggest a Maupassant story for modern times. In French and German. — R.B. (IFC Center, March 12; Film Society of Lincoln Center, March 13-14.) Sally of the Sawdust In this rowdy yet sweet-toned comic melodrama of carnival life, from 1925, D. W. Griffith yokes the cinema’s youth to the age-old lore of the wandering trouper. The wide-eyed, impulsive Carol Dempster stars as a circus orphan, born in the proverbial trunk to an heiress who ran off with a showman and was disowned. Raised by “Professor” McGargle (W. C. Fields, in his first starring role), a magician, pickpocket, and shell-game sharper with a heart of gold, Sally becomes his fiercely devoted sidekick— and thinks she’s his biological daughter. Griffith revels in his actors’ slapstick aptitude, combining low comedy with a romantic drama involving an upright scion (Alfred Lunt, in one of his few film appearances) who discerns Sally’s natural nobility through her greasepaint and antics. Harsh scenes of Sally scuffling along train tracks for want of fare contrast with her near-metaphysical trans- formation into a grande dame for a salon entertainment. Griffith rarely displayed the range of his genius as comprehensively or as generously. Silent.— R.B. (Film Forum; March 16.) A raw young soldier (Jack O’Con- nell) on his first deployment in the British Army, during the year of the title, is separated from his platoon and stranded in unfriendly territory on the darkening streets of Belfast. O’Connell has few lines of dialogue, and his near-silence adds to his air of bewilderment, and to our sympathy for his plight. The hero falls back on his training and his wits, but they can bear him only so far through this alien zone. The writer, Gregory Burke, and the director, Yann De- mange, deliberately steep us in the murk of sectarianism and the tangled stratagems of undercover agents— so much so that viewers hoping to learn about the early years of the Troubles in Northern Ireland may emerge from the film more perplexed than they were at the start. Much of the movie is implausible, if you stop to think about it; yet you don’t stop, so stealthily do its shadows draw you m.—A.L. (3/9/15) (In limited release.) Villa Amalia This taut melodramatic fantasy, from 2009, radiates hot passions through Isabelle Huppert’s coolly controlled acting. She plays Eliane Hidelstein, a pianist and composer who performs under the apt name of Ann Hidden. The musician is knocked off course by the discovery that her longtime lover Thomas (Xavier Beauvois) is seeing another woman, and by her coincidental reunion with Georges (Jean-Hugues Anglade), a long-un- seen childhood friend. Suddenly, Ann changes her life: she sells her apartment and her car, closes her bank account, ditches her cell phone, and wanders through Western Europe’s pro- vincial towns and remote landscapes. Ultimately, she holes up in the villa of the title, a handmade cottage on a mountainside of an Italian island with a majestic view of the sea. But her troubled past, and the traumas of modern European history, burst in and impose mournful structure on her romantic solitude. Huppert’s laser-like gaze seems to tone and sharpen the director Benoit Jacquot’s images. He applies weighty backstory with a light touch, sketches sumptuous settings with painterly specificity, and reveals, with a thrilling briskness and a breathless admiration, the negative power of a life made into art. In French and Italian.— R.B. (French Institute Alliance Fran 9 aise; March 17.) 12 THE NE^ YORKEh, MARCH 16. 2015 laE THEATRE - Jim Fletcher stars in “The Evening,” presented by New York City Players, at the Kitchen. DYNAMIC DUO Richard Maxwell has found his Robert De Niro. FOR FIFTEEN YEARS, THE ACTOR Jim Fletcher has worked with the important theatre director and writer Richard Maxwell, whose shows require an uncommon degree of silence from the performers. In a Maxwell work — his fourteenth full-length piece, “The Evening,” premieres at the Kitchen on March 12, co-presented by Performance Space 122 — part of the story is what the characters don’t say as they walk, measuredly, from one side of the stage to the other, often turning away from a fellow-performer and gazing off into the distance, as though dreaming of someplace else. When Fletcher looks out into space, he can communicate longing, certainly, while making sure that we also see his Rodin-like solidity, which refutes the adolescent jumpiness or feyness that most leading men convey on and off Broadway. Born in 1963 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Fletcher has worked with a diverse array of artists, from the theatre collective Elevator Repair Service (he played Gatsby in the epic “Gatz”) to the choreographer Sarah Michelson. When the actor, who is usually a head or two taller than the other players, takes the stage, you know you’re in for something interesting: sexiness, sometimes, a sense of tragedy and humor for sure, but also a cogent dissection of masculinity, with a focus on the discord between what a man looks like and what he feels. “The Evening” is a Dante-inspired work about maleness (Maxwell’s father died while he was writing it), in which a martial artist and his manager discuss broken dreams while a young woman with a checkered past tends bar. The three-person cast includes Brian Mendes and the sculptor Cammisa Buerhaus; Fletcher plays the manager, a role that he may reprise later in the intended trilogy, of which “The Evening” is the first play. By casting Fletcher, Maxwell is being as specific as his pared-down scripts look and sound. By now, Fletcher is Maxwell’s De Niro; together, they make the most of Fletcher’s silent-movie-expressive face and the focussed drift of his mind. — Hilton Ah OPENINGS AND PREVIEWS An American in Paris Craig Lucas wrote the book for this musical adaptation of the movie, with music and lyrics by George and Ira Gershwin, directed and cho- reographed by Christopher Wheeldon.

Fashions for Men The phrase “generous to a fault” could easily have been coined to describe Peter Juhasz, the openhearted but foolish main character in Ferenc Molnar’s 1917 comedy, receiving a delightful revival under Davis McCallum’s direction at the Mint, with the original English translation niftily spruced up by the company’s artistic director, Jonathan Bank. Juhasz (Joe Delafield) is the owner of a high-end clothing store in Budapest (exquisitely realized by Daniel Zimmerman’s set and appointed by Joshua Yocom’s props). He’s on the brink of professional and personal ruin as nearly everyone in his circle- customers, employees, wife— takes brutal advantage of his good nature, praising him while bleeding him dry. Delafield may be a bit too young for the role, but he projects a confidence turning to confusion, resignation, and bitterness that is truly touching. The cleverly structured play has good, satiric fun at its tender center, with especially fine comic turns provided by Kurt Rhoads, as the shopkeeper’s noble patron, and by Jeremy Lawrence, as a loyal long- time employee who hears, sees, and knows all.

The Founding Fathers Aaron Burr (Leslie Odom, Jr.) and Thomas Jefferson (Daveed Diggs), along with George Washington’s aide- de-camp John Laurens (Anthony Ramos) and Hamilton (Miranda), in eighteenth-century-style knee britches and waistcoats, rap and sing about Hamilton’s beginnings. Then it’s 1776, and America is struggling for independence from King George III (the take-no-prisoners Brian d’Arcy James). Once Hamilton works his way into Washington’s inner circle, becomes the Treasury Secretary, and meets his future wife, the rich and socially prominent Eliza Schuyler (played by the genteel and dull Phillipa Soo), the show’s radicalism is slowly drained, and the resulting corpse is a conventional musical. By burying his trickster-quick take on race, immigrant ambition, colonialism, and masculinity under a commonplace love story in the second half of the show, Miranda hides what he most needs to display: his talent. (Reviewed in our issue of 3/9/15.) (Public, 425 Lafayette St. 212-967-7555.) John & Jen In the first act of this Keen Company revival of Andrew Lippa and Tom Greenwald’s 1995 two-person musical, John (Conor Ryan) and his older sister Jen (Kate Baldwin) are growing up in the fifties and sixties with an abusive father. They make a pact to always stick together, and then Jen breaks the pact, with tragic results. In the second act, Jen, now grown up, vows not to make the same mistake twice, and nearly suffocates her young son (Ryan, in a double role), also named John, with her overbearing attention. Under the direction of Jonathan Silverstein, Baldwin and Ryan are superb in this tiny but powerful musical. They both give funny, nuanced performances, and the result is a moving portrayal of how deeply family members can love and hurt one another. (Clurman, 410 W 42nd St. 212-239-6200.) Little Children Dream of God Jeff Augustin has written a sprawling play, which the director Giovanna Sardelli and her crew have innovatively and expertly fit into an intimate space. It’s part fable, part thriller, part romance, part ghost story, and it endeavors to explore big philosophical questions in a setting both mundane and supernat- ural. Sula (Carra Patterson), following a harrowing journey from Haiti, finds her way to an apartment building in Miami, where she promptly gives birth to the baby she’s been carrying for eleven months. She’s aided by Carolyn (Deirdre O’Connell) , another resident, who credits the paternity of her eleven children to God. Sula’s newborn is healthy but “creepy,” everyone agrees, and Sula worries that he has been infected by a vodun curse she has carried from her homeland. This leads to a theological debate between the two women, just one of many unexpected encounters pulled off by the fine cast. Most affecting, perhaps, are the interactions between Carolyn, a plainspoken health-care worker, and Manuel (Gilbert Cruz), a bitter, lonely terminal case. In the hands of these two accomplished actors, the characters give as good as they get, illuminating the heart of the play. (Roundabout Underground, 111 W. 46th St. 212-719-1300.) Rocket to the Moon Clifford Odets’s 1938 drama, directed by Dan Wackerman, opens with Ben Stark (Ned Eisenberg) , a bighearted Manhattan dentist, promising his bitter, controlling wife (Marilyn Matarrese) that he won’t expand his practice— something that would be financially risky but emotionally fulfilling. It’s not much of a surprise, then, that Stark soon falls in love with his beautiful nineteen-year-old dental assistant (Katie McClellan), and is torn between his worn-out commitments and his dreams. Though Eisenberg, in his late fifties, does an excellent job playing an American Everyman in hard times in this Peccadillo production, he’s too old to play a good guy who’d seriously consider running off with a teen-ager. McClellan, however, is perfectly cast as a young woman so full of life and hope that she makes most of the downtrodden men around her feel alive and hopeful, too. (Theatre at St. Clement’s, 423 W. 46th St. 866-811-4111.) The World of Extreme Happiness China’s one-child policy was enacted in 1980, and the most shocking, insidious effect was the subse- quent widespread subordination, neglect, and even murder of baby girls. So when Sunny (Jennifer Lim) is born to a peasant family at the start of Frances Ya-Chu Cowhig’s play, in 1992, her mere survival is something of a miracle. Twenty years later, she is plying a soul-killing factory job in the city of Shenzhen, sending money home so that her younger brother (there were loopholes in the policy) can go to school. Directed by Eric Ting, the production attempts to lighten Sunny’s grim journey through a society and an economy heavily stacked against her, with comic supporting characters and parallel references to the adventures of the beloved Chinese literary character the Monkey King. But, ultimately, the dialogue— formal, stilted, and sympathy- resistant— works against it. (City Center Stage 1, 131 W. 55th St. 212-581-1212.) 14 THE YOKKER, MARCH 16, 2015 DANCE OF DEATH Thomas Ades’s latest work is a meditation on an ancient theme. THE BRITISH COMPOSER THOMAS ADES, who will conduct the American premiere of his vocal-orchestral work “Totentanz” with the New York Philharmonic at Avery Fisher Hall (March 12-14), is still a relatively young man, having just turned forty-four. Yet he is securely established as a modern master, each new piece assuming the trappings of an event. Such a reputation could easily lead to professional caution, to an audience- savvy recycling of familiar gestures. Fortunately, Ades’s latest creations are anything but circumspect: they are wilder, stranger, and bolder than the intricate, insolent scores with which he first made his name, in the nineteen- nineties. The opening bars of “Totentanz” give us winds shrieking in their upper registers, hectoring brass, whistles and whipcracks from the percussion section, and a splattered G-major chord that lands like a dissonance. It is a sound at once grand and gaudy, majestic and mordant. The music fits the subject. “Totentanz,” which is scored for mezzo-soprano (Christianne Stotijn), baritone (Mark Stone), and orchestra, is a setting of an anonymous text that appeared alongside a frieze by the fifteenth-century German artist Bernt Notke — a cavalcade of figures both exalted and humble, their arms linked by prancing skeletons. The frieze, housed in the Marienkirche in Lubeck,was destroyed by Allied bombs in 1942, but a photograph preserves its macabre wit, as does the poem. (“The more you gain promotion, / The more your life’s uncertain,” Death says to the Parish Clerk.) Fifteen people, from an imperious Pope to a helpless infant, go successively to their doom. The procession is structured so that it never feels episodic; a symphonic continuity ties the character sketches together, and a violent, splenetic climax erupts in the wake of the comeuppance of the Merchant. As Death moves down the social scale, the tempo slows, the orchestra thins out, and lyricism comes to the fore. Ades drops his caustic mien when he portrays those without power: a young maiden is accompanied by crystalline harp and piano, by murmuring winds, by an air of heartbreak. The final section, “Death and the ChUd,” enters the realm of Mahler’s “Wunderhorn” songs, a shivery, shadowy D major. But the orchestra delves into regions darker and grimier than Mahler’s — the sub-crypt of a ruined world. — Alex Ross SWANN AUCTION GALLERIES Photogmoh dt Ro«a P»rki taaittd or y but Uvar pnnr F'»'»«^eS350lo$500 Printed & Manuscript African Americana MARCH 2S Wyatt . j Prpviffw MATff 'P-'.

But this one, with its Victorian-era setting, has proved to be a worthy survivor. The latest revival features Albina Shagimuratova, who has appeared several times at the house as Mozart’s Queen of the Night, in the title role, with the honey-voiced tenor Joseph Calleja as her beloved and Luca Salsi as her disapproving brother; Maurizio Benin! conducts.

The fine lyric tenor Matthew Polenzani takes the title role; Karine Deshayes is Nicklausse; Laurent Naouri sings the Four Villains; and Audrey Luna, Susanna Phillips, and Elena Maximova portray the ill-fated subjects of Hoffmann’s erotic obsessions. (March 11 and March 14 at 8.) •Vittorio Grigolo makes a second foray into French opera this season by singing Des Grieux in Massenet’s “Manon,” an extraordinarily lithe and sumptuous score.

The first is that the menu was designed with the help of a nutritionist aiming to shave off calories wherever possible. The second is that this temple of wellness is situated at Manhattan’s most vexed spot, at least for restaurants: the corner of Sixth Ave. and Downing St., where a triangular room with the feel of a cruise-ship bow has thwarted the ambition of so many chefs. The oddly shaped space has been made to look as lovely as it can be; Aegean-blue banquettes help. And, sure enough, all the usual health foods are in attendance: flax, chia, sunflower seeds. In fact, these three are combined into an aggressively gluten-free cracker, served in lieu of bread, with butternut-squash hummus. Whence the cracker’s binding agent? Hard to say, because it disintegrates into a hundred tiny pieces when subjected to the mildest of stress tests: a dip. As long as you’re prepared to eat your vegetables, and then eat them again, the meal picks up from there, with a memorably sweet tarragon dressing on a gem-wedge salad; baby beets and apples toughened up with hardy little sprigs of lovage; the unexpected addition of blood orange to ribbons of kale. That there’s a bowl of the distinctly unglamorous celery root on almost every table, tossed with rutabaga in an Indian-inspired dressing, is a testament to the power of cumin to make just about anything interesting. Sometimes the judicious distribution of calories renders things a little flat: halibut quivering like a poached egg on grilled salsify tasted as white as it looked, and, even though it would make things easier for everyone, spaghetti squash is never going to convincingly stand in for pasta. (It comes with organic Scottish salmon and black- trumpet mushrooms.) “Thoughtfully portioned options,” says the bottom of the menu, which sounds vaguely threatening, even Bloombergian, but turns out to be just fine, really — how much more of the cauliflower “steak” in a pool of romesco do you want? Even if most diners are there to feel better about eating out after SoulCycle or ModelFit, the kitchen’s use of unusual ingredients guarantees a worthwhile discovery or two. White lentils, for instance, in a truffle risotto. Or teff, from Ethiopia, served as a remarkably light multilayered crepe cake, making a persuasive case for toppling quinoa as ancient grain of choice. The cake comes with an excellent mascarpone mousse and an espresso chocolate sauce. Enjoy in moderation. — Amelia Lester Open daily for dinner.

Some sixty years ago, it was the Garfield luncheonette, where bemused detectives once watched a thief crawl over the transom with sixteen eggs in his pockets and a slice of cake jammed in his mouth. More recently, the site belonged to a bodega— narrow, dusty, smelling of cat food— adjacent to a one-stop shop where checks are cashed, shoes repaired, and keys copied. The latter establishment remains (basic needs endure), but recently it was out with the bodega and in with the craft-beer-and-cocktail joint. The bar is named for both nearby Livingston Street and the Catskill trout-fishing hamlet where the Manor's owner. Matt Roff (also of the Crown Inn and Franklin Park), vacationed as a child. “The vibe within the bar is a marriage of old school and new school, semi-modern meets semi-antique,\" Roff said the other day. So it is that such throwbacks as wood reclaimed from a Virginia elementary school and a bourbon-and-ginger- spiked egg cream called the Bugsville Fizz coexist with neoteric features like a hearty dark lager from Catskill Brewery (est. 2014), a duck-rillette banh mi, and a woman guilelessly confessing, “I never really got into ‘Seinfeld,’ I think because I was too young.\" —Emma Allen PHOTOGRAPH BY DAVIDE LUCIANO THE NEW YORKER, MARCH 16, 2015 17 “ I WANT AN INVESTMENT PLAN FOCUSED ON MY NEEDS, NOT ON FEES ” iSharcs Funds can help you keep more of what you earn.

As Frank Close writes in a new book about him, “Half-Life,” Ponte- corvo wasn’t heard from again untU 1955, when he resurfaced in Russia. There were many wild rumors about what he was working on for the Soviets, among them an “atomic fog.”But Freeman Dyson, reviewing the biography in The New York Review of Books, asks how much rogue physicists like Ponte- corvo really mattered: “Perhaps the spies accelerated the pro- duction of the first Soviet bombs by two or three years, but those bombs soon became obsolete and were superseded by new designs invented without the help of spies.” Dyson, as a physicist, must appreciate that the significance of two or three years in the life of a nuclear-weapons program can be relative. Last Tuesday, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Is- raeli Prime Minister, speaking to a joint session of Congress, at the invitation of John Boehner, the Speaker of the House, dismissed a potential deal that the Obama Administration is pursuing, which would effectively keep Iran from having the means to build a bomb for ten or fifteen years. The time gained would be meaningless if Iran was not first fundamentally incapacitated and trans- formed, Netanyahu said. “A decade may seem like a long time in political life, but it’s the blink of an eye in the life of a na- tion.” (The two weeks between Netanya- hu’s speech and the Israeli elections may seem like an indecorously short time in political life.) Speaking about Iran’s “ten- tacles” and its “gobbling up” of other coun- tries, he suggested that President Obama didn’t know what he was doing. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who shook her head as she watched the speech (more than fifty Democrats stayed away), said that she was “saddened by the insult to the intelligence of the Lfnited States.” And yet, despite Netanyahu’s postur- ing, there is a serious question about time- lines. For several years, Iran has been said to be one, two, or three years away from having the capacity to build a bomb. The Administration’s goal is to prevent it from getting any closer. The rough outline of the deal, judging from leaks and the Administration’s briefings, is that Iran would allow intrusive inspections, limit its nuclear-fuel-production capacity, and give up fuel stockpiles. In return, the United States and its allies would lift sanctions. The deal, reportedly, would have a ten- or fifteen-year sunset clause, although the State De- partment has indicated that some improvements in inspec- tions would remain. From Netanyahu’s point ofview, Iran would then be able to pick up where it left off, and from a position of greater strength, with its economy “unshackled,” as he put it. Iran has cheated before and might try to again (although a deal would make it easier to detect any covert programs), and it could still be sponsoring militias and terror. There are legitimate concerns, but one thing that Netanyahu did not present was any real alternative to the deal. “Folks, simply demanding that Iran capitulate is not a plan,” Secretary of State John Kerry said, after Netanyahu’s speech. He was in Montreux, Switzerland, where he and other representatives of the P5+1 (the perma- nent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany) were engaged in talks with the Iranian For- eign Minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif Obama spoke of America’s “unbreakable” bond with Israel, but he, too, emphasized that the deal was the best way to stop a bomb — “Nothing else comes close. Sanc- tions won’t do it. Even military action would not be as successful.” A problem with the anti-diplomacy position is the one that Dyson confronts: building a bomb has ceased to be a great puzzle; nuclear programs no longer rely on physicists disappearing mysteriously from Italian beaches. When Netanyahu said that the deal, by freeing Iran to be more “aggressive,” would “spark a nuclear THE NEW YORKER, MARCH 16, 2015 19 arms race” in the region, he was acknowledging that there are any number of countries that, without too much difficulty, could acquire a nuclear homh if they had the money and the politi- cal will. (Saudi Arabia, certainly, has the budget.) At worst, hos- tile dismptions of the Iranian program could accelerate it by pushing the country’s leaders to abandon the restraints Iran has already accepted. At best, they would do on a small scale some- thing that a deal would do better — create more time. A key concept in the negotiations is “breakout time”; that is, how quickly Iran could assemble the materials for a bomb if it reneged on a deal. Mostly, this is a question of obtaining enriched uranium, or having the centrifuges to produce it. The more centriffiges a country has spinning, the shorter the breakout time. At the moment, Iran has about nineteen thou- sand, which it says serve only civilian energy needs; the ex- pectation is that a deal would reduce that number, so that the breakout time would be a year or more. Breakout time is a concept that might also be applied to politics. What difference can two or three — or ten or fifteen — years make? Between 1949, when the Soviet Union tested its first crude fission bomb, and 1953, when it exploded a hydro- gen bomb (perhaps with help from Pontecorvo) the leader- ship shifted from Stalin to Khrushchev. The years from 1982 to 1991 saw four general secretaries — from Brezhnev to Gor- bachev — and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In Iran, the relationship between Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani, whose election held some promise for re- formers, is opaque, though Rouhani seems to be pushing the talks. The terms are relative here, too; last week, Rouhani called Israel a warmonger. But the world made it through the de- cades of the Cold War in large measure because of imperfect arms agreements with dubious partners. If we rely only on financial and military threats, nonproliferation will fail. In an indication of the complexity of the moment, Iran and the United States have a shared goal in Iraq: to take the city of Tikrit back from ISIS. Netanyahu warned Congress not to be “fooled” into thinking that Iran could be a friend in this fight. “One calls itself the Islamic Republic. The other calls itself the Islamic State,” he said. “In this deadly game of thrones, there’s no place for America or for Israel.” On the way back from Montreux, Kerry stopped in Riyadh, in part to reassure the Saudis about the operations in Iraq. (The Sau- dis oppose ISIS, but they, like ISIS, are Sunni, and Iran is Shi- ite.) If a deal were to be struck, all the other challenges re- lated to Iran would remain, Kerry said, “except that we will have taken steps to guarantee that Iran will not have a nu- clear weapon.” At least, for a useful period of time. — Amy Davidson GOE5 THERE? ALIA5 T hree Fridays ago at Balthazar, the SoHo brasserie, a large clouded- glass mirror detached from a wall and landed on some people who were hav- ing breakfast. One of them was a man — debonair, in a fine scarf and a dark coat — ^who identified himself to police officers responding to a 911 call as Ar- naud Franqaise. He was wheeled out of the restaurant on a gurney and taken to Bellevue. Doctors examined him; he was unharmed. Later, it emerged that he was not M. Franqaise but Arnaud Monte- bourg, until last August the French Minister of the Economy. One guesses that he tendered the false surname out of embarrassment, not wanting to be known, newly arrived on the East Coast — he was spending the week as the Syngman Rhee 1910 Lecturer at Princeton’s Woodrow Wilson School — as the guy who went to Balthazar and got crushed by an antique. (Instead, he will have to live down the embarrass- ment of having christened himself Ar- naud Fran 9 aise.) One is less sure what to make of the news that Chelsea Clin- ton, with plenty of time to think, has been checking into hotels as Diane Reyn- olds, the same name under which, as the Times reported last week, she carried out her correspondence on clintonemail. com, her mother’s private e-mail server. You kind of want to have them all over for eggs Benedict: Charles Morin (Winston Churchill’s nom de palette, hor- rowed from a recently dead landscape painter), George Fox (Eliot Spitzer’s phony identity at the Mayflower Hotel), Lou Sarah (a character created by Sarah Palin to hype Sarah Palin on Facebook), Carlos Danger (Anthony Weiner’s am- orous alter ego), his possible relative Nick Danger (the proprietor of a secret e-mail account maintained by the former North Carolina governor Mike Easley). Poli- ticians, like anyone, burrow into pseud- onymity when they want to hide them- selves or something else, when they don’t want the world to know where they are or what they’re doing. But, unlike the larkish handles of Hollywood celebri- ties, as revealed by the Sony hackers (Tom Hanks, a.k.a. Johnny Madrid; Sarah Michelle Cellar, a.k.a. Neely O’Hara), the fake names of politicians seem to yield strangely earnest self- rep- resentations. Diane Reynolds. It’s so Chelsea Victoria Clinton — ^less a trench- coat and sunglasses, as aliases go, than Capri pants and a hairband. Diane Reynolds — honey, don’t we know her from somewhere? Probably so. In Ashland, Ohio, she might have helped you buy a house. Fifty miles east, in Tall- madge, she may be your certified public accountant. She’s an addiction counsel- lor near Portland; a physician’s assistant in Bangor; a nurse in Brooklyn; a dietet- ics clinical coordinator in Ypsilanti. You might have read one of her poems in the Cortland Review, or bought a vintage bomber jacket from her on Etsy.

Diane was the eighteenth most popular hahy girl’s name in America in 1947, the year that Hillary Diane Rodham was horn. It is unclear, though, why Chelsea chose Reynolds. Presumahly, she was not memorializing the late Irish Prime Min- ister Albert Reynolds, who, according to Bill Clinton, “worked hard and risked much as Taoiseach to advance the North- ern Ireland peace process,” or referring to the sex-offending ex-congressman Mel Reynolds, whose prison sentence was commuted by her father. Maybe she dreams of being Mrs. Ryan Reynolds. Is she in the pocket of the aluminum-foil lobby? (Chelsea Clinton Fake E-Mail Name Generator: your mother’s middle name and the first thing you see when you open the kitchen drawer.) It seemed a question that only the experts could resolve. E-mails from real Diane Reynoldses, upon being informed that Chelsea Clin- ton had assumed their name: “Get out! I’m politically involved and think that’s GREAT! ” (Diane Reynolds, Real- tor, Peabody, Massachusetts.) “Wow!” (Diane Reynolds, wedding pho- tographer, Dallas-Fort Worth area.) “Well, if I hadn’t done a bit of research after getting your e-mail, I would have sworn this was a phishing scam!” (Diane Reynolds, family therapist, Santa Monica.) “I am out of the office until 03/10/2015.” (Diane Reynolds, Toronto, data scientist.) There was another person in the news last week who did not use the precise name with which he was born: a thirty- two-year-old black man who, according to the Justice Department’s report on the Ferguson Police Department, was sitting in his car cooling off after playing bas- ketball. This was in 2012. An officer pulled up and demanded the man’s iden- tification; he accused him of being a pe- dophile, ordered him onto the pavement, and prepared to search his car. The man objected. The officer arrested him, re- portedly at gunpoint. The man was charged with eight different violations, and this eventually caused him to lose his job as a government contractor. One of the charges was Making a False Dec- laration: his name was Michael, and he had originally given it as Mike. — Lauren Collins ALL-NIGHTER DEPT. OM S\\(/EEY OM A legend: In ancient India, a noble- woman named Parvati had a crush on the god Shiva. But he wasn’t open to dating. His previous wife had died, and he was an ascetic; he meditated all day on a mountaintop, wearing only a tiger skin. Rebuffed, Parvati tried to woo him on his own terms. She took up an aus- terity regime — fasting, meditating for years in the wilderness. It worked. Shiva was impressed, and he came out of seclusion. The Hindu ceremony of Shivaratri honors their marriage. Devotees fast and stay up all night to celebrate it with chanting. “It’s a long haul,” the yoga teacher Eddie Stern said the other day, at the Broome Street Temple, in SoHo. “But, once you get late into the night — 2, 3, 4 A.M. — the whole atmosphere’s pretty profound.” Stern, who is pale, with a shaved head, had just arrived, late, from giving Madonna a yoga les- son. Would Madonna be coming to the ceremony? “She said she might stop by,” Stem said. Stem is an expert in Ashtanga yoga, having trained with Shri K. Pat- tabhijois, who developed the technique. He founded the Hindu temple, in his Manhattan yoga studio, in 2001 , to cre- ate “a little slice of India,” he said. Since then, it has become an unlikely spiritual- pilgrimage site, attracting a mixture of Indians, downtown yoga ladies, and ce- lebrities (Gwyneth Paltrow; Mike D, of the Beastie Boys; Julian Schnabel; Russell Brand). The evening’s Shivaratri ceremony was bittersweet: it would be the Temple’s last. The space had been sold to developers, who want to turn it into a hair salon. “It’s an emotional time,” Stern said. More than a hundred and fifty yogis had R.S.V.P.’d for the all- nighter, and he said they’d be drifting in and out. It was 5 P.M.,and Stern’s helpers were mshing around, making chai and rice for the guests. Near the back of the room, a white-and-gold shrine, like a cabin, housed a statue of the elephant-headed god Ganesh. A Hindu priest and other robed men sat on the floor in front of a mural depicting Shiva. Stem joined them and began to chant, as a crowd showed up. Eirst came the after- work shift: San- gita, a paralegal whose parents are from Calcutta, said that she was there because “my mom’s been pushing it. I think she wants me to find a husband.” Rebecca Dias, a former yoga teacher from Chel- sea, said that she was hoping to bring “auspiciousness” into her life. The robed men chanted. A kirtan singer played a harmonium and sang. accompanied by her brother, on a tabla. “Om namah Shivaya,” many followers chanted, while others discreetly checked their Instagram accounts. During a bath- room break, one of the robed men, Neeraj Karhade, introduced himself He works in private equity. “I learned Sanskrit as a child,” he said. “I come from a long line of priests.” Beneath his robe, he wore a black T-shirt that spelled out “Broome Street Temple” in the shape of the Ra- mones logo. At twelve-thirty. Stern rang a bell. “Hari om!\" he announced. “Here we are at the halfway point.” He spoke about the ritual, explaining that Shiva is the god of consciousness, so it makes sense to honor him with an aU-nighter. “It’s a discipline to stay up all night,” he said, and retold the story of Parva- ti’s suffering. “At the heart of her aus- terities was a deep, profound love for Shiva. Discipline without love is fanat- icism. And love without discipline can seem wishy-washy. ’’The crowd mur- mured its assent. The late shift was arriving. Massimo Lobuglio, an environmentalist wearing trendy glasses, wanted to bring “more love, less B. S. ” into his life. An art teacher named Suzanne said that she’d been in- trigued by the ceremony’s reputation for helping women with romance. “I tried to do online dating,” she said. “But I don’t have time.” Still no Madonna. The night marched on: more chant- ing, more offerings. By two-thirty, the room was full of yawns. By three-thirty, Dias looked wilted. “I’m struggling,” she said. Lobuglio slumped against a wall. At 4 A.M., there was a long bout of chant- ing: “0»2 namah Shivaya.” Throats grew sore. Bottoms felt numb. Even Stern seemed to be in a funk. “Real estate stresses me out,” he said, reflecting on the Temple’s relocation issues, during a chai break. (Madonna had sent her re- grets at 12:46 A.M. “ ‘I just finished my rehearsal, and I’m totally exhausted,”’ Stern said, reading her message. “I said we’d say a prayer for her.”) At five-fifteen, it was still dark out- side. A little girl — Pranathi Bhat, the priest’s daughter — ^was led up to a mi- crophone, where she rubbed her eyes and sang a song: “ 0»2 mangalam”T\\\\t men in robes tinkled bells and lit can- dles, celebrating the celestial marriage. Stern perked up.“Thankyou, Lord Shiva, for bringing us all together!” he an- nounced. Dias was jubilant. “I’m proud that I made it this far,” she said. Lobu- glio nodded. “I got a third wind!”he said. “I’m going home to catch up on e-mails.” — Lizzie Widdicombe UP LIFE’5 LADDER 5IDEKICK R eggie Watts is weird, but weird works . for Reggie Watts. Example: his 2012 TED talk. He starts out speaking gibberish, which morphs into a British accent (“there is no time other than the coUapsation of that sensation of the mir- ror of the memories”), and is followed by a gruff “Ya know what I’m sayin?” Ya don’t, but that’s the point. Watts, the soon-to-be house bandleader of “The Late Late Show with James Cor- den,” on CBS, could be called a come- dian or a musician. In his signature act, he improvises monologues and songs over beats that he records onstage and loops using an effects pedal. The result is like watching a “Saturday Night Live” audition on acid. The other day. Watts was due at the Tiger Lounge, a secret rehearsal space beneath a dive bar in Williamsburg. The room reeked of incense, its walls covered with graffiti. Watts lumbered in and bellowed to the room, “Hello, I am Lathrup McGillicutty,”but his dis- tinctive hairdo (poufy’fro,poufy beard) gave him away. He offered a hand to shake — he keeps his pinkie nails long; one was painted red, the other black — and addressed how he’d found the place. “Fifteen years ago, I worked for a small Salisbury-steakTV-dinner-manufac- turing company called Swanson’s, and they would include brownies, which would always remain kind of gooey even though you put them in the oven for a long time,” he began. “And I re- member my grandmother coming over with a shawl, and she said, ‘You guys look so cozy here, but you know what would really work? You should find a place in New York,’ and so I found this place.” "
