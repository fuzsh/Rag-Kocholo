There are over 800 different species of eel. Freshwater eels are known to travel as far as 4,000 miles to breed. Despite its name, the electric eel is not an eel but a knife fish. Eel is a delicacy in some cultures, but its blood is toxic, so it needs to be cooked thoroughly. Keep reading for more interesting facts about eels.\n\nGeneral Facts about Eels\n\nEels belong to the order Anguilliformes (aka cousin of the fish).\n\nEven though the eel looks like a snake it is really a fish.\n\nThey have long, narrow bodies with long dorsal and anal fins.\n\nMost eels have no scales.\n\nThe eel’s backbone is made up of over 100 vertebrae which makes it very flexible.\n\nEels have gills and very sharp teeth.\n\nEels live in both saltwater and freshwater.\n\nThere are about 800 species.\n\nAs marine animals and unlike reptiles, eels breathe underwater with their gills and fins, and therefore cannot survive outside of water.\n\nThe European eel is normally around 60–80 cm (2.0–2.6 ft) and rarely reach more than 1 m (3 ft 3 in), but can reach a length of up to 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) in exceptional cases.\n\nThe European eel is a critically endangered species.\n\nSince the 1970s, the number of eels reaching Europe is thought to have declined by around 90% (possibly even 98%).\n\nSeveral projects have been started to prevent them from becoming endangered.\n\nIn 1997, Innovatie Netwerk in the Netherlands initiated a project where they attempted to get European eels to breed in captivity\n\nWhile the species’ lifespan in the wild has not been determined, captive specimens have lived over 80 years. A specimen known as “the Brantevik Eel” lived for 155 years in the well of a family home in Brantevik, a fishing village in southern Sweden.\n\nThe largest species, the slender giant moray eel, can grow to 13 feet in length.\n\nThe electric eel is a South American freshwater fish found mainly in the Amazon River basin.\n\nThe electric charge is produced by special organs along the sides of the eel’s body.\n\nThe electric discharge from an electric eel can be stronger than 500 volts.\n\nThe eel uses the electric charge against its predators and to catch its prey.\n\nThe electric eel is a carnivorous hunter, meaning that it eats other animals. It’s a toothless fish and must swallow its food whole.\n\nLife Cycle\n\nMuch of the European eel’s life history was a mystery for centuries, as fishermen never caught anything they could identify as a young eel.\n\nEels undergo considerable development from the early larval stage to the eventual adult stage, and most are predators.\n\nUnlike many other migrating fish, eels begin their life cycle in the ocean and spend most of their lives in fresh inland water, or brackish coastal water, returning to the ocean to spawn and then die.\n\nIn the early 1900s, Danish researcher Johannes Schmidt identified the Sargasso Sea as the most likely spawning grounds for European eels.\n\nThe larvae (leptocephali) undergo considerable development from the early larval stage to the eventual adult stage, and most are predators.\n\nThey drift towards Europe in a 300-day migration.\n\nWhen approaching the European coast, the larvae metamorphose into a transparent larval stage called “glass eel”, enter estuaries, and many start migrating upstream.\n\nAfter entering their continental habitat, the glass eels metamorphose into elvers, miniature versions of the adult eels.\n\nAs the eel grows, it becomes known as a “yellow eel” due to the brownish-yellow color of its sides and belly.\n\nAfter 5–20 years in fresh or brackish water, the eels become sexually mature, their eyes grow larger, their flanks become silver, and their bellies are white in color. In this stage, the eels are known as “silver eels”, and they begin their migration back to the Sargasso Sea to spawn.\n\nSilvering is important in an eel’s development because it allows for increased levels of the steroid hormone cortisol, which is needed for their migration from freshwater back to the sea.\n\nCortisol plays a role in the long migration because it allows for the mobilization of energy during migration.\n\nAlso playing a key role in silvering is the production of the steroid 11-Ketotestosterone (11-KT), which prepares the eel for structural changes to the skin to endure the migration from freshwater to saltwater.\n\nAfter the eel breeds, it dies.\n\nIt takes a young eel three years to become an adult.\n\nHabitat and Feeding\n\nEels are found throughout the world.\n\nEels are bottom dwellers, which means that they usually can be found on the muddy or sandy floor of the river or ocean where they live.\n\nMost eels hide and live in caves and rock crevices.\n\nThey also burrow in the sand.\n\nThese behaviors allow them to surprise and attack their prey.\n\nSome eels will actually chase their prey and the rocks provide protection for the eel.\n\nEels eat insects, fish, and crustaceans as part of their carnivorous diet.\n\nThey also eat mollusks.\n\nThey are carnivorous predators that eat a very diverse diet, including just about any marine creature that is smaller than them.\n\nEels typically eat everything they can fit into their mouth. They won’t go for animals of the same size.\n\nHuman Uses for Eels\n\nEels have been important sources of food both as adults (including jellied eels of East London) and as glass eels.\n\nGlass-eel fishing using basket traps has been of significant economic value in many river estuaries on the western seaboard of Europe.\n\nEels’ blood is poisonous, which discourages other creatures from eating them.\n\nA very small amount of eel blood is enough to kill a person, so raw eel should never be eaten.\n\nTheir blood contains a toxic protein that cramps muscles, including the most important one.\n\nAs long as the eel is appropriately prepared and cooked all the way through, it is safe for eating.\n\nDuring the preparation process, the eel is filleted and drained of its blood, and then the heat from cooking kills the harmful toxins in the meat.\n\nEel Worksheets\n\nThis bundle contains 9 ready-to-use Eel Worksheets that are perfect for students who want to learn more about Eels which may look like a snakes, but they are actually fish.
