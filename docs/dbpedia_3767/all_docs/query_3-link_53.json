        "text": "Ophidiidae\n\nThe cusk-eel family, Ophidiidae, belongs to the Ophidiiformes order and comprises a collection of marine bony fishes. Its scientific nomenclature stems from the Greek term \"ophis,\" denoting \"snake,\" which aptly reflects their serpent-like physical attributes. It is worth noting that genuine eels diverged from other ray-finned fish during the Jurassic period, whereas cusk-eels are classified under the Percomorpha clade, which also encompasses various species such as tuna, perch, seahorses, and numerous others."
