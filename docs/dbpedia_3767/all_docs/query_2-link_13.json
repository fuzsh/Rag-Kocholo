        "text": "Annotated classification\n\nineel inEvolution, paleontology, and classification\n\nThe classification used in this article is a synthesis of the work of many authorities. However, it is based primarily on the work of Canadian biologist J.S. Nelson, who divides Anguilliformes into the suborders Anguilloidei, Muraenoidei, and Congroidei. It is expected that eel classification will be further modified as more is learned about the little-known families.\n\nOrder Anguilliformes\n\nElongated bony fishes of streamlined profile. Continuous median fin with up to 650 soft rays; pelvic fins absent; reduced cycloid scales (that is, with skin-covered bone overlying a layer of fibrous connective tissue) sometimes present; swim bladder with duct; cranial bones reduced, particularly the palatoquadrate and opercular series; pectoral girdle detached from cranium; vertebrae up to 700, with fused centra and arches; a leptocephalus larva. 15 families, about 140 genera, and more than 800 species. 1 family in fresh water; the remainder marine, in all oceans, mainly tropical Atlantic and Indo-Pacific, to considerable depths.\n\nSuborder Anguilloidei\n\nFrontal bones of skull paired.\n\nFamily Anguillidae (freshwater eels)\n\nScales present, gill slits ventrolateral. Important as food. 1 genus, Anguilla, with 15 species. Worldwide, but not on the Pacific coast of the Americas and South Atlantic coasts.\n\nFamily Heterenchelyidae ( mud eels)\n\nNo fins, mouth large. 2 genera with 8 species. Tropical Atlantic.\n\nFamily Moringuidae ( spaghetti eels)\n\nAnus in posterior half of body, degenerate, burrowing. 2 genera with about 6 species. Tropical Indo-Pacific and western Atlantic.\n\nSuborder Muraenoidei\n\nFrontal bones of skull paired, scales absent; reduced gill arch elements and reduced lateral line.\n\nFamily Chlopsidae (Xenocongridae) ( false morays)\n\nBurrowing. 8 genera with 18 species. Pantropical.\n\nFamily Muraenidae (morays)\n\nNo pectorals, large mouth, often brightly coloured, voracious, sedentary. About 15 genera and approximately 190 species. Pantropical to subtropical.\n\nFamily Myrocongridae\n\nLaterally compressed, poorly known. 1 genus, Myroconger, with 4 species. South Atlantic.\n\nSuborder Congroidei\n\nFrontal bones paired or fused, supraoccipital present or absent, paired nostrils close in front of eye.\n\nFamily Nemichthyidae (snipe eels)\n\nJaws greatly extended, minute teeth. 3 genera with about 9 species. Bathypelagic (deepwater), worldwide.\n\nFamily Serrivomeridae ( sawtooth snipe eels)\n\nJaws moderately extended; bladelike teeth on vomer bones. 2 genera with about 10 species. Bathypelagic, worldwide.\n\nFamily Colocongridae ( shorttail eels)\n\n1 genus, Coloconger, with about 5 species. Marine; Atlantic, Indian and western Pacific oceans.\n\nFamily Congridae (congers)\n\n32 genera with about 160 species. All oceans to considerable depths.\n\nFamily Muraenesocidae ( pike congers)\n\nLarge teeth, voracious. 4 genera with about 8 species. Pantropical.\n\nFamily Nettastomatidae ( witch eels)\n\nNo pectoral fins. 6 genera with about 40 species. Deepwater.\n\nFamily Derichthyidae ( longneck eels)\n\nRelatively long snout. 2 genera with 3 species. Bathypelagic.\n\nFamily Ophichthidae (snake eels and worm eels)\n\nMany branchiostegals, caudal reduced or absent. 52 genera with about 290 species. All oceans.\n\nFamily Synaphobranchidae ( cutthroat eels)\n\nGill slits ventrolateral to ventral, united. Scales present. 10 genera with about 35 species. Deepwater, worldwide.\n\nCritical appraisal\n\nInitially the eels were split into the Colocephali (morays) and Enchelycephali (others), and the suborder Carenchelyi for the Derichthyidae was added later. The current classification recognizes three suborders, the Anguilloidei, Muraenoidei, and Congroidei, although the higher-level classification of the order Anguilliformes is still in dispute. A review of eel phylogeny by British paleontologist Peter L. Forey and colleagues has suggested the inclusion of the saccopharyngoid fishes—that is, the gulper eels (order Saccopharyngiformes)—in the order Anguilliformes. Overall detailed species-level work has resulted in a good understanding of generic and species limits, although much remains to be discovered about eel taxonomy.\n\nPeter Henry John Castle"
