        "text": "Identification\n\nThe standard name of the species comes from the yellowish-brown to green colouration of the fish. The head is usually orange.\n\nThe scientific name Gymnothorax prasinusis is made up of the following Greek words:\n\ngymno - bare, naked (Greek)\n\nthorax - chest (Greek)\n\nprasinos - leek green (Greek)\n\nThe Family name, 'Muraenidae', is derived from:\n\nthe Latin term muraena, meaning 'eel',\n\nthe suffix '-idae' means it a family name. All animal family names end in '-idae'.\n\nHabitat\n\nGreen Morays can be found in shallow rocky reefs, weed-covered reefs, in estuaries and in deeper offshore waters. They are usually seen with only the head protruding from a crevice in the rocks or occasionally a person-made object such as a pipe.\n\nDuring the day, many morays are found in crevices and holes in both rock and coral reefs. This habit affords the moray protection from predators and allows it to strike at prey from a hidden position. Despite their reclusive habits, in some places Morays make up a huge proportion of the carnivorous fishes. On some reefs in Hawaii morays make up 46 percent of the total weight of carnivorous fishes.\n\nOther behaviours and adaptations\n\nMoray eels have no pectoral or pelvic fins. They have the ability to tie their bodies in knots and use this to gain leverage when tearing food. It was long thought that this was only a story, not based on fact, but has since been verified.\n\nTubed nares (nostrils)\n\nMorays have an excellent sense of smell, and have the nares (nostrils) developed into tubes. Most fishes have two nostrils on each side of the head. Water passes in the anterior nostril and out through the posterior nostril. Under the skin, between the 2 nostrils, lies the nasal apparatus, which gives the fish its sense of smell.\n\nFor most fish species it is common for the 2 nostrils to be close together. In the Green Moray however, the nostrils are widely separated. The anterior nostrils, located on the snout are extended into tubes, whereas the posterior nostrils have shorter tubes and are situated above the eyes. The nostrils of some morays have been developed to an extraordinary extent. Those of the ribbon eel Rhinomuraena quaesita are highly developed.\n\nAnguilliform swimming\n\nLong, flexible fishes such as eels swim by flexing the whole body into lateral waves. This is known as anguilliform swimming. Most eels (including the Green Moray) have laterally compressed tails. The Green Moray also has well a developed dorsal fin which results in further compression of the body. This increases swimming efficiency in the same way that a flattened oar is more efficient for rowing than a rounded pole.\n\nThe morays use anguilliform swimming to great effect when they dart forward out of a crevice to seize prey (invertebrates and fishes). They can swim nearly as well backward, which is handy for entering into the shelter of a crevice or hole to avoid predators.\n\nAnguilliform swimming is named after a genus of freshwater eel, Anguilla (view fact sheet for A. reinhardtii).\n\nLife history cycle\n\nLeptocephalus larval phase\n\nThe life cycle of all eels involves a larval phase during which time the developing eel is known as a leptocephalus. Unlike many (but not all) species of adult eels which are bottom living fishes, leptocephali are found in the plankton in open water. The leptocephali of the freshwater eels make incredible journeys of thousands of kilometres from the open ocean spawning grounds of the adults into freshwater streams.\n\nDanger to humans\n\nDespite their fearsome appearance morays are not considered dangerous to people, although larger individuals can inflict serious wounds. It has been reported that some species have poor eyesight. This may account for morays sometimes attacking the hands of divers, which may be mistaken for an octopus.\n\nReferences\n\nKuiter, R.H. 1993. Coastal Fishes of South-Eastern Australia.
