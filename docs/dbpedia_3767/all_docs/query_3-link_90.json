        "text": "European Eel lifecycle\n\nGlass eels\n\nWhen European eels arrive in our rivers they’re just 8cm long and transparent, but they’ve already travelled 6,500km. That’s because all eels hatch from eggs in the Sargasso Sea, an area of the North Atlantic Ocean. They spend the first year or two of their underwater life as larvae, floating towards Europe on the ocean currents, before transitioning into glass eels as they reach European waters.\n\n2. River migration\n\nHaving survived their mammoth voyage and arrived in the Thames Estuary, glass eels begin transitioning into elvers – up to 12cm long and a dark brown colour.\n\nThey journey up the Thames and into our system of tributary rivers, looking for a home where they can feed on insect larvae, crustaceans and other fish. The Thames River system is highly fragmented, and the elvers face over 2,000 barriers to their migration, like weirs and dams. We install specially built eel passes to help them access areas of rivers that have been cut off to them.\n\n3. Becoming a yellow eel\n\nOnce they’ve found a safe spot to feed and grow, the elver begins the next part of their lifecycle, becoming a yellow eel (named because of their yellow tummies). They can spend 20 years in our rivers, feeding and growing up to one metre in length and weighing up to 6kg – that’s about the same as a domestic cat. It’s also at this stage when they’re most likely to be affected by pollution in our rivers, like sewage leaks.\n\n4. Eel breeding\n\nAll of their hard work over the last few years has been leading up to this moment: the eel makes its final transition into an adult silver eel. Their silver colour will help camouflage them from the countless predators they will face on the return journey to the Sargasso Sea. The adult eel will now need all the weight and strength it’s built over the last decade or two to swim 6,500km to their birthplace. For eels that do survive the migration, they achieve their ultimate goal: the chance to breed with other eels and lay their own eggs.\n\nEuropean eel Conservation in the River Thames\n\nEuropean eels once thrived in London’s rivers but the number of young joining the adult populations has dropped dramatically since the 1980s and the species is now classified as ‘Critically Endangered’ by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Our work on European eels started in 2005 and now ranges from informing international conservation policy and leading UK research on eel behaviour to regional-scale best practice conservation delivery in the Thames Catchment. Through research, river improvements, public engagement and advising policy, we work in partnership with the Environment Agency and a network of other organisations to address the key conservation issues facing eels.\n\nEel scientific research\n\nUntil 2022, no one was sure where European eels came from. It had never been proved that eels bred in the Sargasso Sea. Our scientists cracked the case by catching adult eels in the Azores and fitting them with satellite tags. We were able to watch the eels return to their mysterious breeding grounds in the Sargasso Sea.\n\nReconnecting broken migratory pathways\n\nA principal conservation action for eels in freshwater is to restore migratory pathways by removing barriers such as weirs. If removal is not possible, the impact of barriers can be partially mitigated by installing eel passes that allow eels to move upstream over them. With over 2000 barriers to migration, the Thames rivers are highly fragmented. One of ZSL’s key goals in the region is to reconnect migration routes. So far, eel passes commissioned by ZSL have made 138.95 hectares of additional habitat accessible.\n\nAssessment of Adult European Eel Stocks in the Thames River Basin\n\nWe've monitored the recruitment of juvenile eels into the Thames River Basin since 2005. The data collected to date supports the findings that the annual recruitment of the European eel across its range has reduced by 90-95% since the 1980s. It is likely that this reduction in recruitment will have had an impact on the numbers of adult eel in the Thames River Basin. In 2019, our repeated surveys of adult eels undertaken in 1987 and 2011 to assess the geographic spread of eel populations in the Thames and identify the effect of the range of measures that have been introduced to improve eel stocks.\n\nThames Eel Management Plan\n\nWe're a key partner in delivering the Environment Agency’s Thames Eel Management Plan. The management plan outlines key targets and measures to improve the population and conservation of the European eel. Given the scale of the challenges faced by eels, working together is essential. – if you or your organisation would like to join us in this work please get in touch.\n\nObstacEELS"
