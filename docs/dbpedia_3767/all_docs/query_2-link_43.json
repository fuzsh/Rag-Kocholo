        "meta_description": "There are 15 species in this family. Unlike other eels, members of this family have scales. they have a long doral fin that runs from the middle of their back to their tail. They have a anal fin that runs from the middle of their stomach to the tip of their tail. They have small, rounded pectoral fins just behind their gills. Freshwater eels are catadromous, that means they live in freshwater and migrate downstream to spawn in the ocean. Young eels live in the ocean or in estuaries until they are around one year old. Year old eels are called elvers. Elvers return to rivers to grow to adulthood. The American eel is the only native freshwater eel found in North America. American eels are found in rivers in the eastern United States. American eels migrate to the Sargasso Sea near Bermuda to spawn. The adults probably die after spawning. The elvers return to inland rivers when they are a year old. Females many travel well inland, males usually stay near river mouths or in estuaries. American eels can be as much as 15 years old when they spawn. Female American eels can grow to be four feet long, males are around 1.5 feet long.  - Wildlife Journal Junior",

Young eels live in the ocean or in estuaries until they are around a year old. One-year-old eels are called elvers. Elvers return to rivers to grow to adulthood.\n\nThe American eel is the only native freshwater eel found in North America. American eels are found in rivers in the eastern United States. Every winter mature American eels migrate to the Sargasso Sea near Bermuda to spawn. The adults probably die after spawning. Most American eel elvers return to inland rivers when they are a year old. Females may travel well inland; males usually stay near river mouths or in estuaries. Just recently scientists discovered that not all American eel elvers return to freshwater to mature. Some stay in marine or estuarine habitats. American eels are now described as displaying facultative catadromy. That means they can be found in freshwater or saltwater during maturation.\n\nAmerican eels can be as much as 15 years old when they spawn. Female American eels can grow to be 4 feet long; males are around 1.5 feet long.\n\nWorld Status Key\n\nLeast Concern Near Threatened Vulnerable Endangered Critically Endangered Extinct in Wild Extinct Not Enough Data\n\nStatus and range is taken from ICUN Redlist.\n\nU.S. Status Key\n\nThreatened in US Endangered in US Introduced\n\nStatus taken from US Fish and Wildlife.
