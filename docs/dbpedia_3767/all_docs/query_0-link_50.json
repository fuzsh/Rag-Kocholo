They have one gill opening, a paired set of fins, and a muscular body(1).\n\nAnguilliformes: Anguilliformes include the eels and morays(2).\n\nAnguillidae: Anguillidae are the family of catadromous eels with embedded scales and prominent pectoral, dorsal, caudal, and anal fins(2).\n\nAnguilla: The Anguilla are a genus of eels that live in freshwater and return to the ocean to reproduce(2).\n\nrostrata: As previously mentioned, the Latin meaning of rostrata is \"beaked\", pertaining to the American eel's elongated nose(2).\n\n(1) Hickman, C., L.
