        "text": "Nucleic acids extraction and quantification\n\nDNA and RNA extraction was carried out simultaneously with an N-lauroylsarcosine protocol adapted from Caldarone and Buckley (1991). After thawing, 50 μL of the eel homogenate solution was transferred in a second vial to which 50 μL of a 2%N-lauroylsarcosine (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) solution (2 g dissolved in 100 mL TE buffer) was added. The vial was vortexed for 30 sec, and 400 μL of TE buffer was subsequently added to reach a 0.2%N-lauroylsarcosine final concentration. To precipitate proteins, the vial was then gently shaken and centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 g. A total of 100 μL of the supernatant was then transferred in a third vial already containing 900 μL of TE buffer. Finally, 25 μL of the well-mixed 1:10 dilution was used for spectrofluorometrical RNA and DNA measurements.\n\nNucleic acids quantification protocol was adapted from Caldarone et al. (2001). Quantification was performed using the SYBR® Gold Nucleic Acid Gel Stain dye (Invitrogen). Spectrofluorometry readings were carried out in 96-well microplates at 25°C with a Fluoroskan Ascent FL (Thermolabsystems, Helsinki, Finland) set for 485 nm excitation wavelength and 527 nm emission wavelength. Microplate wells were filled with 75 μL of 1× SYBR Gold solution before 25 μL of the 1:10 nucleic acid dilution (or TE buffer blank, or DNA standard, or RNA standard) was added in each. The microplate was agitated for 5 min and put at rest for another 5 min for optimal dye–nucleic acid binding. A first series of readings was carried out in order to measure the combined RNA + DNA signal. Following this step, 5 μL of 33 µg/mL RNase A (Roche Diagnotics, Bale, Swiss) was added to each well to eliminate the signal due to RNA alone. The microplate was agitated for 5 min and put at rest for 15 min for complete RNase digestion. A second series of readings was then carried out to measure the signal due to DNA alone. Signal due to RNA alone was calculated as the difference between first and second readings (Caldarone et al. 2001). We empirically determined that an additional DNA digestion step was not necessary because the background signal due to proteins was nonsignificant (<10%) (data not shown). Hence, signal due to DNA alone was directly inferred from the second reading. In order to convert spectrofluorometer fluorescent readings to DNA and RNA concentrations, DNA and RNA standards (veal thymus DNA and 18S and 28S veal liver RNA, Sigma-Aldrich) were used in parallel with each experiment and standards data were pooled to construct calibration curves.\n\nRNA/DNA ratios and condition factor\n\nRNA concentration was positively correlated with latitude, which was best predicted by a linear regression model (RNA [mg/individual] = 0.00096 × lat + 0.0155; r2= 0.15; P-value < 0.0001). The mean overall RNA concentration was 0.22 ± 0.04 mg/individual, varying from a minimum of 0.16 ± 0.02 mg in the Florida sample to a maximum of 0.31 ± 0.05 mg in the Gaspésie sample ( ). Conversely, the model that best described observed DNA concentration as a function of latitude was an inverse quadratic regression (r2= 0.18, P-value < 0.0001), with a maximal DNA concentration predicted at 40.3°N. The mean overall DNA concentration was 1.09 ± 0.32 mg/individual. The Pennsylvania sample, which lies approximately in the center of the sampled geographical range, displayed an average DNA concentration (2.10 ± 0.17 mg/individual) that was much higher than any other sampled locality ( ). Even when this sample was excluded, the inverse quadratic model still significantly and best explained the latitudinal pattern of variation in DNA concentration (r2= 0.14; P-value < 0.0001).\n\nTable 2\n\nSample locationRNA (mg/individual)DNA (mg/individual)RNA/DNA ratioGrande Rivière Blanche, Québec (17)0.31 ± 0.050.95 ± 0.320.344 ± 0.07AParker River, Massachussetts (10)0.20 ± 0.030.85 ± 0.190.252 ± 0.08BPrince Edward Island (15)0.25 ± 0.061.05 ± 0.260.250 ± 0.05BCape Breton, Nova Scotia (14)0.21 ± 0.020.85 ± 0.080.250 ± 0.04-Boothbay Harbor, Maine (12)0.24 ± 0.031.01 ± 0.110.237 ± 0.03BCGuana River Dam, Florida (1)0.16 ± 0.020.72 ± 0.090.229 ± 0.03BCCooper River, South Carolina (3)0.22 ± 0.031.00 ± 0.100.227 ± 0.04BCPatcong Creek Linwood, New Jersey (7)0.20 ± 0.050.93 ± 0.050.215 ± 0.05BCTaylor River, New Hampshire (11)0.25 ± 0.051.15 ± 0.120.214 ± 0.04BCGeorgia (2)0.17 ± 0.030.84 ± 0.070.208 ± 0.04BCDNewfoundland (16)0.21 ± 0.041.11 ± 0.090.189 ± 0.04BCDWormley Creek, Virginia (5)0.26 ± 0.051.40 ± 0.130.188 ± 0.04BCDMillsboro Pond Spillway, Delaware (6)0.18 ± 0.020.95 ± 0.130.188 ± 0.02BCDEast River, Nova Scotia (13)0.17 ± 0.030.93 ± 0.100.183 ± 0.03-Black Creek, North Carolina (4)0.18 ± 0.051.09 ± 0.140.170 ± 0.07CDETaylor River—Old Saybrook, Connecticut (9)0.19 ± 0.041.38 ± 0.220.140 ± 0.02DEPoquessing Creek, Pennsylvania (8)0.24 ± 0.042.10 ± 0.170.114 ± 0.02E\n\nGiven the above RNA and DNA concentrations, the mean RNA/DNA ratios ranged from 0.114 in Pennsylvania up to 0.344 in Gaspésie, Québec ( ). A quadratic model best explained the variance in RNA/DNA ratio as a function of latitude (ratio = 0.00080 × lat2– 0.0608 × lat + 1.331, r2= 0.21, P-value < 0.0001). The negative parabolic regression curve reached its minimum at about 38.0°N corresponding to a predicted RNA/DNA ratio of 0.18 ( ). The highest RNA/DNA ratio was observed for the northernmost sample (Gaspésie, Québec), which was also the only location significantly higher than any other single locality (RNA/DNA ratio = 0.344 ± 0.07, Tukey test; P-value = 0.001) ( ). Mean ratios for all other localities varied between 0.114 ± 0.02 in Pennsylvania and 0.252 ± 0.08 in Massachusetts.\n\nMean Fulton's condition factor ranged from 0.578 in Maine up to 0.908 in Delaware ( ). A positive quadratic model best explained the variance in condition factor (K) as a function of latitude (K= 0.760563 – 1.149280 × lat – 2.267006 × lat2, r2= 0.26, P-value < 0.0001). The positive parabolic regression curve reached its maximum at about 37.0°N corresponding to a predicted condition factor of about 0.82 ( ). Thus, the relationship between Fulton's condition factor versus latitude was essentially the inverse of that observed for RNA/DNA ratio.\n\nRNA/DNA ratio and condition factor as proxies for physiological stress associated with larval dispersal\n\nIn fish, RNA/DNA ratio values lower than 2 have usually been associated to prolonged fasting and an enhanced risk of mortality (Chícharo and Chícharo 2008). Here, none of the ratios measured exceeded 0.5. However, very low RNA/DNA ratios (between 0.6 and 1.1) have also been previously reported by Kawakami et al. (1999) for glass eels of the closely related Japanese eel (A. japonica). The apparently weak metabolic activity found in glass eel could be a characteristic of the growth strategy employed in fishes with a leptocephalus larval phase. For almost one year, the leptocephalus larva of American eel must ally survival and locomotion faculties while limiting its metabolic expenditures in order to successfully complete its oceanic journey (Schmidt 1923; Kettle and Haines 2006). Namely, it is believed that locomotion faculties are increased by the laterally compressed shape of leptocephali, which allows it to drift at minimal costs through oceanic currents (Castonguay and McCleave 1987; McCleave et al. 1998). As for growth, which is achieved during early development by stocking of acellular mass (mostly water), it represents a relatively small proportion of total metabolism, which varies between 4% and 39% of total metabolism (Bishop and Torres 2001). Lipids amount to 80% of the energy content and are thought to be synthesized via absorption of suspended particular matter in the water (Donnelly et al. 1995; Pfeiler 1996). At the time of their entry in estuaries, newly metamorphosed glass eels feed minimally and resort to their lipid reserves that they gradually break down (Lecomte-Finiger 1994; Sullivan et al. 2009). Similarly, Kawakami et al. (1999) observed in Japanese eel that endogenous lipid contents gradually waned during the period of estuarine entry, with glass eels arriving late exhibiting lower stocking levels. More recently, Gagnaire et al. (2012) provided evidence for spatially varying selection acting on allelic variation at the Acyl-carrier protein gene among the same glass eels that were analyzed in this study. Interestingly, this gene is directly involved in the fatty acid synthesis pathway, and thus, suggesting that the selective agent acting its allelic variation could relate to differential energetic constraints encountered by glass colonizing tributaries along the Atlantic coast.\n\nDifferential physiological stress associated with variable energetic constraints faced by A. rostrata larvae during their dispersal could in turn influence pattern of survival and recruitment in the species’ distribution range. Although catch per unit effort (CPUE) data are not available throughout their whole geographic range, the peak of recruitment apparently lies somewhere between Virginia to the South (Vélez-Espino and Koops 2009) and southern of Nova-Scotia to the North (Jessop 1998). Offshore, the most favorable oceanic conditions for glass eels (mild temperatures, proximity of Gulf Stream to the continent) possibly lies between Virginia and Massachusetts, also corresponding with the area of most abundant catches at sea (Kleckner and McCleave 1985). Indeed, more southeastern locations, although being also relatively close to the Sargasso Sea, exhibit lower levels of recruitment (Vélez-Espino and Koops 2009). The northward flowing Gulf Stream may likely keep glass eels from massively recruiting to the southern reaches of the North American coast (Kettle and Haines 2006). As for more northern locations, and in particular in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, which encompasses the three northernmost sampled localities, the southward flowing Labrador stream keeps waters cold all year around (Dutil et al. 2009). Dutil et al. (2009) also described constraints potentially encountered by glass eels in the Laurentian Channel (depth > 400 m), through which they must pass to enter the Gulf. Between 100 and 200 m depth, water temperatures constantly hover around the freezing point and beneath that depth, waters are severely oxygen-depleted. Among other things, such barriers hamper the normal use of selective tidal stream transport by eels in the Gulf of St. Lawrence (Edeline et al. 2004; Bureau Du Colombier et al. 2009). Moreover, the 1000-km distance that spans between the Cabot Strait and the Grande-Rivière-Blanche (Québec) represents the longest estuarine distance among all sampled localities. Historically, CPUE data in the Gulf of St. Lawrence have several orders of magnitude below those reported on the Atlantic shore of Nova-Scotia, probably as a result of less-favorable conditions encountered by eels in the Gulf (Dutil et al. 2009). Thus, the very high RNA/DNA ratio we observed for the Gaspésie glass eels could reflect physiological stress encountered in the St. Lawrence estuary, perhaps associated with long osmoregulation acclimation during the stabulation period in the estuary (McGovern and McCarthy 1992).\n\nOverall then, it seems plausible that oceanic conditions might be more favorable to glass eel colonizing the middle of their range, resulting in overall higher survival and recruitment in this part of the species’ range. In contrast, glass eel that disperse at either the northern or southern extremities of the distribution range may encounter physiologically more stressful conditions leading to reduced survival and recruitment. This hypothesis is supported by the predominance of glass eels characterized by relatively low RNA–DNA ratios and high condition factor in the middle part, in contrast to the predominance of glass eels with high RNA–DNA ratios and low condition factors at both the southern and northern extremities of the distribution range. Differential selective pressures associated with variable environmental conditions being encountered could then result in genetic differences between glass eels from different locations through the process of spatially varying selection (Levene 1953) as documented by Gagnaire et al. (2012). Moreover, although the analysis of neutral genetic markers has still not refuted the null hypothesis of panmixia for American eel (Avise et al. 1986; Wirth and Bernatchez 2003), common rearing experiment of glass eels from two different locations that were analyzed in this study (Grande-Rivière-Blanche, Gaspésie, Québec and Mira River, Cap Breton, Nova Scotia) revealed quantitative genetic differences in growth between glass eels from these two localities (Côté et al. 2009). On the other hand, Wang and Tzeng (2000) hypothesized that individual growth could influence patterns of dispersal and Edeline et al. (2004) suggested that different energetic status could influence migratory behavior and habitat selection. Thus, an additional (not exclusive) explanation to differential selection might involve differential dispersal stemming directly from the Sargasso Sea associated with physiological status, which could also result in local genetic differences within an otherwise panmictic species (Williams et al. 1973; Koehn and Williams 1978).\n\nLatitudinal variation in energetic status could also be related to catadromy rates (the percentage of individuals colonizing freshwater habitats) that vary throughout the species’ range. As a general tendency, it appears that a larger contingent of eels will settle in saltwater habitats at higher latitudes, possibly due to a generally higher productivity in coastal marine environments versus freshwater habitats at northern latitudes (Daverat et al. 2006; Vélez-Espino and Koops 2009). Namely, Edeline (2007) proposed that the “freshwater vs. saltwater” dilemma for the eel could be thought of as an evolutionary stable conditional strategy model, whereby differential migration to either freshwater or marine (brackish) habitats will depend on individual energetic status. However, the hypothesis that catadromous behavior depends on energetic status in American eel must still be rigorously tested.\n\nThe influence of DNA content on the observed RNA/DNA ratios\n\nThe differences observed between DNA concentration measured in glass eels were mainly due to middle range localities featuring the highest DNA contents ( ). Bishop et al. (2000) have previously described the first growth phase (Ia) of leptocephalus larvae (during which they elongate to nearly their full glass eel size) as a period of intense cell proliferation. Since DNA content is proportional to the number of cells, this phase could be important in influencing the total DNA content of the future glass eels. It is also noteworthy that the results of Wang and Tzeng (1998) suggested that glass eels collected from the middle distribution range were also characterized by a faster growth rate during the leptocephalus stage. Although hypothetical, it is plausible that differential growth rate during the leptocephalus stage could contribute to the observed latitudinal differences in DNA content and therefore on patterns of RNA/DNA ratios. Finally, it is also possible that variable times at arrival per se could have influenced the DNA content of glass eels. For instance, in the Japanese eel, Kawakami et al. (1999) noticed a slight but significant temporal increase of DNA content among successive waves of glass eels arriving at a single sampling site. In the present study, the date of capture could not be standardized but always corresponded to the first wave of glass eels arrival at each location. Clearly then, many factors must be considered in interpreting RNA/DNA ratios as a proxy for energetic status in species such as the American eel whose recruitment occurs at different times of the year depending on latitudes, and may last between two to six months, depending on year (Overton and Rulifson 2009; Sullivan et al. 2009). Yet, there is little doubt that the patterns of RNA–DNA ratios and condition factor we quantified in this study reflect pronounced differences in physiological status among glass eels entering freshwater at different latitudes and the study of Gagnaire et al. (2012) suggests that this is accompanied by differences at genes under the effect selection."
