        "text": "The American eel is the only species of freshwater eel found in North America. It once made up over a quarter of the total fish found in many Atlantic coastal streams. Indeed, the eel is a valuable food source for larger fish and fish-eating birds, as well as people. Eels are catadromous, meaning they primarily live in rivers and estuaries, but migrate out to the ocean - the Sargasso Sea, to spawn. American eels are an elongated fish, with fairly small fins. They use their whole body to swim in undulating motions.\n\nThey are covered with a mucous layer, making them very slick. Scientists believe this mucous layer reduces friction as they swim in the ocean currents and protects them from pathogens that might enter the skin."
