Both represent new records for the country. A single specimen of G. nudivomer measuring 619 mm total length (TL) was collected from Iloilo Fish Port Complex, Iloilo and a specimen of S. dorsalis measuring 777 mm TL was collected from the fish market of Batan, Aklan. Detailed morphological descriptions and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) barcode sequences are provided. A comprehensive list of geographic records for both species, as well as a list of all species representing the genera Gymnothorax and Strophidon reported in the Philippines is also provided in this report.",
