Biography

Miles Davis III is Notable.

Miles Davis, acclaimed American jazz trumpeter, bandleader, and composer, was among the most influential figures in the history of jazz and 20th-century music.[1] Born with sickle cell anemia, he struggled with health issues and substance abuse beginning in the 1950s that adversely affected his career, his music, and his personal life.[1]

Miles Davis-- Miles Dewey Davis, III-- was born on 26 May 1926 in southern Illinois, just north of East St. Louis, where his family moved not long after his birth. His parents, dentist Miles Davis, Jr and his wife,Cleota Henry, a music teacher and violinist, were from Arkansas, and owned a farm there. He had an older sister, Dorothy, and a younger brother, Vernon.[2] He was nine when he received his first trumpet as a gift and soon began lessons with Elwood Buchanan, a jazz trumpeter and music teacher Davis later credited with greatly influencing his technique. In January of 1944, he finished high school and went to New York to study music at Julliard. He soon dropped out of school to join the New York music scene as a member of Charlie Parker's Quintet, until 1948.[1]

in July of 1944, he and his high school girlfriend, Irene Cawthon Birth, had their first child, Cheryl Davis. Irene and Cheryl joined him in New York.[1] At least one source describes his relationship with Irene as a common-law marriage.[3]

His children with Irene Cawthon Birth:

Cheryl Davis (1944)

Gregory Davis (1946)

Miles (Davis) Abdullah (1950-2015)

In the spring of 1949, in Paris, he met French singer and actress Juliette Gréco while she was performing on the stage of a cabaret. Their "love at first sight" was mutual. The racial segregation prevailing across the Atlantic at that time prevented them from considering a common future on American soil. Miles Davis returned to the United States alone, but they remained friends for the rest of his life.[4]

He married Broadway dancer Frances Elizabeth Taylor in Toledo, Ohio in 1959. They had no children and she filed for divorce in 1966.[5]

In 1968 he married model and singer-songwriter Betty Mabry; they divorced the following year, with no children.[1] She introduced him to musical innovators Jimi Hendrix and Sly Stone, who greatly influenced his electric, or jazz fusion, period.[6]

He had a relationship with Marguerite Eskridge in the seventies, and they had a son:

Erin Davis (1970)[1]

He married the actress Cicely Tyson in Massachusetts in 1981; they divorced in 1989, with no children. She helped him overcome his drug addiction, but his health continued to decline.[1]

Miles Davis died on 28 September 1991 in Santa Monica, California,[7] and was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York.[8]
