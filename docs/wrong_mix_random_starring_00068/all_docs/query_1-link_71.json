        "text": "Miles Davis was one of the greatest musicians to ever live and he knew it. “I’ve changed music five or six times,” he once recounted. Davis was not arrogant; he was humble. To study the structure of cool jazz, hard bop, modal jazz – even hip hop and rock - is to decode his DNA. Davis was the master of social music and for five decades he created the soundtrack to a life à la mode.\n\nDavis wasn’t just heard. He was seen; stylish and suave with a stunning face to suit. Yet his aesthetic wasn’t enough for Columbia Records to wear him on the original 1957 sleeve of his own “Miles Ahead” album. In fact, his looks were the problem: he was distinctly dark-skinned. Instead, the fusion of jazz and world music on “Miles Ahead” was represented by a Caucasian woman and child on a boujee boat. Davis’ protest - “why did you put that white bitch on there?” – got the cover replaced. His audacious attitude overwhelmed white management in an anti-African America. The Miles Davis persona was cool personified.\n\nThe Miles Davis Estate wants to promote this persona. The Estate is headed by Davis’ daughter Cheryl Davis, son Erin Davis and nephew Vince Wilburn Jr. He had two sons, Miles IV and Gregory Davis, who were notably excluded from the Estate. The reasons why are unclear. Whilst Miles IV Davis sidestepped the spotlight, Gregory Davis’ glorious deviation from the Estate was brilliantly blatant. In 2006, he released the biography Dark Magus: The Jekyll and Hyde Life of Miles Davis, a “warts and all” revelation of the “real” Miles Davis. The damaging publication prompted the Estate to publicly retort: “The family has read the book and finds no fact … in its contents.” The Estate’s rejection is suspicious. No fact? Not one? Presumably, their reaction is rooted in Gregory’s depiction of his father. The Miles Davis of Dark Magus is a callous creep who attacks his girlfriend with a splintered drumstick and suggests a foursome with Gregory and his wife. This Miles Davis wasn’t cool. He was cold.\n\nThe details of Dark Magus are dubious. But Gregory wouldn’t have had to deceive to degrade his dad. Miles Davis had already degraded himself. In his autobiography Miles (1990) he arrogantly admitted to attacking women: on one occasion he “slapped the shit out” of third wife Cecily Tyson because she’d brought over a friend he didn’t like. He even professed to “pimping a little.” But Davis is beloved. The Estate still manages to find people that will portray him as an admirable icon – even endorsing characterisations that completely contradict one another. For example, in the Wilburn Jr. produced film Miles Ahead (2016), Davis is a contemptible but cool caricature of himself. He angrily drives around 1970s New York to find high-calibre cocaine and a stolen sessions tape – punching and threatening to shoot people along the way. In contrast, the biopic Birth of the Cool (2019) depicts Davis as a complex and lovable man. He is adored by those who knew him – albeit, only those who liked him were interviewed. His first wife Frances Taylor talks about his violence, but his crimes against her are largely attributed to drink and drugs.\n\nThe Miles Davis Estate owes these women justice. Miles Davis was a criminal who inflicted emotional and physical trauma on his victims. Ironically, Birth of the Cool was promoted during a landmark year for the #MeToo movement, which forced audiences to separate artists from their art. Erin Davis and Wilburn Jr. have bucked this trend. Asked about Miles Davis’ abuse against women, Wilburn Jr. remarked: “Erin didn’t see it, and I never saw him being physical towards women.” Erin confirmed. Of course, they know he beat women – and that these women suffered behind closed doors. They just don’t want to discuss them: that conversation isn’t becoming of an icon.\n\nThe Miles Davis Estate isn’t the only Estate trying to protect a persona that will engage modern audiences. In 2014, the James Brown Estate backed the biopic Get On Up – a tribute that mythologises the soul man. The film forgets former wife Adrienne Rodriguez; whom he was repeatedly arrested for assaulting – once beating her with a lead pipe and shooting at a car she was hiding in. More recently, the XXXTentaccion (Jahseh Onfroy) Estate collaborated with the modern icon’s former partner Geneva Ayala, whom he allegedly strangled and terrorised. They created a video for “Hearteater” in which she, bloodied and nude, cannibalises someone (assumably Onfroy) – framing Ayala as a femme fatale and shifting the blame. Evidently, problematic lives make for problematic Estates.\n\nThe Miles Davis Estate will celebrate his music: it’s phenomenal – and profitable. But will they condemn the icon and commemorate the victims of the criminal? Now that would be cool."
