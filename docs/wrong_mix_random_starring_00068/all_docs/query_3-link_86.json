LOUIS, MISSOURI.\n\nAND IT WAS SOUTH, YOU KNOW.\n\nAND EVERYTHING THAT GOES IT IN 1926.\n\nBUT MILES DAVIS' FATHER WAS A DENTAL SURGEON.\n\nAND MILES DAVIS GREW UP ESPECIALLY FOR A BLACK KID IN THAT TIME, RICH.\n\nTHEY HAD A HOUSE IN EAST ST.\n\nLOUIS BUT THEY HAD A FARM OUTSIDE OF EAST ST. LOUIS WHERE THEY HAD CATTLE AND PIGS AND HE HAD HIS OWN HORSE AND THAT'S HOW MILES GREW UP.\n\nMILES HAD TWO JOBS IN HIS LIFE.\n\nHE HAD ONE JOB FOR A WEEK OR TWO AS A PAPER BOY, AS A KID.\n\nAND HE WAS A MUSICIAN.\n\nTHAT'S ALL HE EVER DID.\n\nHIS FATHER WAS ABLE TO SUPPORT HIM THROUGH GOING TO JUILLIARD AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS.\n\nSO MILES' LIFE WAS VERY DIFFERENT THAN WE THINK OF THE JAZZ MUSICIAN.\n\nBUT HE WAS A PROTEGE.\n\nHE STARTS PLAYING WHEN HE'S 14 WITH BANDS AROUND EAST ST.\n\nLOUIS.\n\nWE HAVE PICTURES OF HIM.\n\nYOU SEE HE'S A LITTLE KID.\n\nHE'S PLAYING WITH MEN AT 14.\n\nAND BECAUSE THEY ALL, THE MEN ALL HAD DAY JOBS, MILES BECOMES THE BAND MANAGER AND KIND OF MANAGES THE BAND AT 14 AND 15.\n\nIN SOME WAYS, WE SEE THE INFLUENCE OF THAT AS MILES PROBABLY BECOMES THE GREATEST SMALL GROUP BAND LEADER IN THE HISTORY OF JAZZ.\n\nOF COURSE, AS WE FOLLOW MILES' CAREER ONCE HE COMES TO NEW YORK, AND THE STUDIES OF JUILLIARD WHICH I'M NOT SURE MANY PEOPLE KNOW.\n\nEVEN THEN THERE IS THIS UNIQUE SORT OF INDIVIDUALISTIC REBELLIOUS STREAK THAT IS VERY CLEAR FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.\n\nAND I'M JUST WONDERING HOW AS A YOUNG BLACK MAN IN HIS 40s AND 50s, EVEN IN NEW YORK, HOW WAS HE ABLE TO NAVIGATE THAT WITHOUT GETTING SERIOUSLY HURT?\n\nWE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WERE TIMES THAT HE GOT HURT.\n\nBUT WITHOUT GETTING SERIOUSLY HURT.\n\nMILES IS LIVING AS A JAZZ MUSICIAN.\n\nHE DOES HAVE THAT.\n\nHE TAKES A BEATING IN 1959 FROM A COP OUTSIDE BIRDLAND.\n\nHE'S REALLY BLOODIED AND TALK ABOUT THAT FILM, INCREDIBLE PICTURES.\n\nFRANCIS TAYLOR WHO IS THERE.\n\nTALKING ABOUT THAT INCIDENT.\n\nTHAT WAS ALWAYS ONE OF THE KIND OF DICHOTOMIES THAT MILES EXISTED WITH.\n\nHE'S BORN RICH BUT HE'S BORN BLACK IN EAST ST. LOUIS.\n\nHE BECOMES VERY EARLY ON, THIS VERY SUCCESSFUL JAZZ MUSICIAN.\n\nHE IS STILL SUBJECTED TO THE RACISM IN AMERICA AND IT IS ALWAYS SOMETHING MILES DEALS WITH ALL HIS LIFE.\n\nWELL, AS WE GET A CHANCE TO FOLLOW HIS CAREER AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIS MUSIC, WE OF COURSE GET TO THE ALBUM HE DID KIND OF BLUE, WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING AND STILL IS ONE OF THE GREATEST JAZZ ALBUMS EVER RECORDED.\n\nTELL ME ABOUT WHAT IT WAS THAT, HOW DID HE COME TO THAT PLACE?\n\nWE FOLLOW A MUSICAL EVOLUTION.\n\nIT IS NOT LIKE IT CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.\n\nTHAT'S A WONDERFUL THING THAT WE FOUND IN THE FILM.\n\nTHAT THERE WAS THIS EVOLUTION AND IT ALL MAKES SENSE.\n\nSO MILES GOES TO FRANCE.\n\nHE GOES TO FRANCE TO PLAY IN '57, '58.\n\nHE'S PLAYING THERE.\n\nAND HE IS ASKED TO DO A SOUNDTRACK FOR THE FRENCH FILM CALLED ELEVATED TO THE GALLOWS.\n\nTHE WAIT A MINUTE HE DOES THE SOUNDTRACK, SBEEGS THE STUDIO.\n\nTHEY PUT THE FILM UP ON THE SCREEN AND HE PLAYS WITH HIS BAND TO THE IMAGES ON THE SCREEN.\n\nHE HAS A COUPLE NOTES.\n\nTHAT'S ALL HE HAS.\n\nAND HE MAKES VERY FAMOUS RECORDING ELEVATED TO THE GALLOWS FOR THIS FILM BECOMES A VERY SUCCESSFUL FRENCH FILM.\n\nWHEN HE COMES BACK, THAT'S KIND OF WHAT HE DOES THE REST OF HIS LIFE.\n\nHE GOES INTO THE STUDIO, A YEAR LATER.\n\nHE GOES IN FOR KIND OF BLUE WITH SOME LITTLE SKETCHES, AS JIMMY COBB, THE DRUMMER ON THE SESSION, YEAH, A COUPLE LITTLE PIECES OF PAPER.\n\nAND I ASKED HIM.\n\nWHAT DID HE TELL YOU THEN?\n\nAND EM, MILES JUST TOLD ME TO SWING.\n\nJUST SWING.\n\nAND THAT, WHAT COMES OUT OF.\n\nIS THIS ALBUM OF PURE IMPROVISATION THAT BECOMES AGAIN, I WOULD ARGUE, THE GREATEST JAZZ ALBUM OF ALL TIME.\n\nONE OF THE GREATEST ALBUM OF ALL TIME.\n\nWHAT ARE THE UNOFFICIAL CHARACTERS OF THE FILM IS ALSO THE CITY OF NEW YORK.\n\nAND THE ROLE THAT IT PLAYED.\n\nNOT ONLY IN MILES' LIFE BUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF JAZZ.\n\nTHERE ARE SO MANY OTHER MUSICIANS HERE AT THE TIME WHO WERE JAMMING WITH THEM AND SITTING IN ON SESSIONS.\n\nTELL ME ABOUT WHAT THAT VIBE WAS LIKE.\n\nSO MILES, YOU KNOW, HE GRADUATES HIGH SCHOOL IN EAST ST. LOUIS.\n\nALMOST LIKE THE NEXT DAY, HE GETS ON A TRAIN TO NEW YORK.\n\nHE SAYS I'M GOING TO NEW YORK.\n\nHIS PARENTS, ESPECIALLY HIS MOTHER WANT HIM TO BE A VIOLINIST.\n\nSO HE ENROLLS IN JUILLIARD.\n\nWHAT COULD HIS MOTHER SAY?\n\nYOU'RE IN JUILLIARD SO YOU CAN GO TO NEW YORK.\n\nSO HE COMES TO JUILLIARD AND HE'S STUDYING AT JUILLIARD DURING THE DAY BUT PLAYING ON 52nd STREET WITH CHARLIE PARKER AT NIGHT.\n\nHE JOINS CHARLIE PARKER'S BAND.\n\nHE BECOMES THE TRUMPETER FOR CHARLIE PARKER AND THAT'S A LOVE AFFAIR THAT MILES HAD ALL HIS LIFE.\n\nHE ALWAYS, EVEN IF HE HAD A PLACE IN MALIBU, HE ALSO HAD HIS PLACE IN NEW YORK.\n\nONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THOUGHT WAS VERY INTERESTING, THIS FILM ISN'T JUST FOR THE JAZZ ENTHUSIASTS.\n\nTHIS IS FOR, I'VE HAD A CHANCE TO SEE IT.\n\nI'VE HAD A CHANCE TO WATCH WITH MY FAMILY, MILLENNIALS, ET CETERA.\n\nAND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE FULLY IMMERSED IN THE JAZZ WORLD TO APPRECIATE WHO MILES WAS AND WHAT HIS WORK REPRESENTED.\n\nWHAT WAS YOUR BIGGEST INTENT THAT YOU WANTED IN MAKING THIS?\n\nTHAT'S SUCH A GREAT QUESTION, AN INTERESTING QUESTION.\n\nWHAT I WANTED TO DO, I'VE BEEN MAKING FILMS FOR 40 YEARS.\n\nI WENT TO CITY COLLEGE IN NEW YORK AND I'VE BEEN MAKING FILMS FOR 40 YEARS AND THIS WAS A CHANCE TO MAKE A FILM WITH MILES DAVIS.\n\nSO I WANTED TO PUT EVERYTHING THAT I LEARNED.\n\nEVERYTHING THAT I KNEW ON THE SCREEN.\n\nAND TRIED TO MAKE A FILM IN SOME WAYS KIND OF NOT MOCKED BUT KIND OF IMITATED, KIND OF HAD THIS CREATIVE SENSE OF MILES.\n\nSO WE THREW, YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING THAT WE COULD.\n\nWHEN I SAY WE, THE EDITOR, THE ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, WE THREW EVERYTHING THAT WE COULD UP THERE TO TRY TO GIVE MILES'\n\nABSOLUTELY.\n\nIT COVERS SUCH AN AMAZING BREADTH OF LIFE.\n\nIT WAS SO GREAT.\n\nENGROSSING TO WATCHFUL FOR MORE INFORMATION ON AMERICAN MASTERS PRESENT IGS MILES DAVIS, BIRTH OF COOL, VISIT US AT METROFOCUS.ORG."
