        "text": "Topline\n\nA total of 18 former NBA players have been charged in federal court for allegedly attempting to defraud the league’s health benefit plan out of approximately $4 million, according to an indictment unsealed in the Southern District of New York on Thursday.\n\nKey Facts\n\nKey Background:\n\nAll 19 defendants, including the 18 players, have been charged with wire fraud and participating in a conspiracy to defraud the NBA’s health benefits plan. In addition, Williams, whom prosecutors called the “linchpin” of the operation, has been charged with aggravated identity theft for allegedly impersonating a plan employee to pressure a fellow co-conspirator. Over the course of three years, Williams received $230,000 in kickbacks, the indictment claims.\n\nTangent:\n\nLast month, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that three former National Football League players, including two-time Pro Bowler and former Rookie of the Year Clinton Portis, pleaded guilty for their roles in a nationwide scheme to defraud a healthcare benefit program for retired NFL players and could face years in prison. The three players (Portis, Tamarick Vanover and Robert McCune), along with seven other defendants, were initially indicted in the Eastern District of Kentucky in December 2019. Since the initial charges were announced, five additional retired NFL players were charged in the scheme. All 12 of the other defendants charged have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud. Portis caused the submission of false and fraudulent claims over a two-month period, obtaining $99,264 in benefits for expensive medical equipment that was not actually provided, according to court documents. Portis and Vanover face a maximum penalty of ten years in prison and will be sentenced in January 2022. The DOJ said McCune, who could be facing life in prison, orchestrated the scheme that resulted in approximately $2.9 million worth of fraudulent claims.\n\nFurther Reading:"
