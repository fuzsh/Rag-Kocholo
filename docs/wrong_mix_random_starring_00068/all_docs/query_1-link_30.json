        "text": "Betty Davis, a funk music trailblazer who was married to jazz great Miles Davis, has died at 77.\n\nThe boundary-smashing artist died of natural causes on Wednesday at her home in Homestead, Pennsylvania, according to longtime friend Connie Portis.\n\n“It is with great sadness that I share the news of the passing of Betty Davis, a multi-talented music influencer and pioneer rock star, singer, songwriter and fashion icon,” Portis said.\n\n“Most of all, Betty was a friend, aunt, niece, and beloved member of her community of Homestead, Pennsylvania, and of the worldwide community of friends and fans.\n\n“At a time to be announced, we will pay tribute to her beautiful, bold and brash persona. Today we cherish her memory as the sweet, thoughtful and reflective person she was. …There is no other.”\n\nWith her provocative image, erotic lyrics and raspy purr, Davis broke ground on the male-dominated funk scene and developed a cult following with raw, rapturous and irreverent songs such Your Man My Man, If I’m In Luck I Might Get Picked Up, They Say I’m Different and Shut Off The Lights.\n\nBefore marrying Miles Davis in 1968, she was known as Betty Mabry, a professional model who frequented a 1960s watering hole The Cellar with varied associations to musicians such as Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone and Hugh Masekela.\n\nShe also wrote the Chambers Brothers song Uptown (To Harlem), which was included on their 1968 opus The Time Has Come.\n\nBorn in Durham, North Carolina, Davis started her recording career in the mid-60s after leaving Pittsburgh to enrol at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City.\n\nIn 1968, after two years of dating, she married Davis – who was 19 years her senior – becoming his second wife.\n\nShe graced the cover of his 1968 album Filles De Kilimanjaro, and was the inspiration behind his song Mademoiselle Mabry.\n\nAlthough she served as a great influence to reinventing his style and sound, their marital union lasted just a year.\n\nIn his autobiography, the legendary trumpeter referred to her as “young and wild.” His seminal Bitches Brew was reportedly an homage to her.\n\nMelding rock, jazz, soul and funk throughout her lascivious lyricism, Betty Davis recorded most of her music between 1964 and 1975 on various recording labels.\n\nShe released They Say I’m Different in 1974 and a year later recorded the album Nasty Gal for Island Records.\n\nThe funk diva’s legacy has lived on through the unabashed musicality and spunky fashion sensibilities of a young generation of black female performers that followed.”\n\nAfter being disillusioned by the music business, Davis retired and lived a reclusive life in the Pittsburgh area.\n\nShe was the focus of the 2017 documentary Betty: They Say I’m Different and later released her first song in 40 years, A Little Bit Hot Tonight.\n\nAAP"
