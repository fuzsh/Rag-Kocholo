The Rockets and our community partners are proud to give back to the incredible city of Houston in the aftermath of Hurricane Beryl this morning. #RocketsGiveBack\n\nThe Houston Rockets and Toyota Center, in collaboration with community and local partners, are conducting a drive-thru food and water distribution event outside of Toyota Center beginning at 9 a.m. on Friday, July 12. The event, which is free and open to the public, is in partnership with American Red Cross Texas Gulf Coast Region, Reliant Energy Â®, Second Servings of Houston and Cotton GDS. Volunteer staff from the Rockets, Toyota Center and team partners will distribute boxed lunches, water, fruit, snacks and other hurricane relief items, including charging devices from Reliant Energy. Please note that supplies are limited and will be distributed on a first come, first served basis. Donate: https://lnkd.in/gxHhh5u3\n\nIn recognition of Juneteenth, we hosted a conversation centered on the story of Juneteenth for Rockets staff which explored the struggles and triumphs of enslaved people who longed to be free. The conversation was led by Naomi Carrier, historian, poet, educator and playwright, and Jason Edwards, son of former Texas State Senator Al Edwards, known as the Father of Juneteenth for his pivotal role in advocating for Juneteenth as both a Texas and national holiday."
