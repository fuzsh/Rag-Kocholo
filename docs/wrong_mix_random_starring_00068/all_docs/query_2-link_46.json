        "text": "Arguably one of the most influential artists of the 20th Century and beyond without a doubt, Miles Davis was indeed a revolutionary. Coming out of the bebop era of jazz (complex harmonies and melodic bliss) he ushered in and helped initiate or develop/shape the Jazz that was to come. Miles Davis forged himself as the catalyst that brought about the era of Cool Jazz a modal concept of jazz, influenced by his Birth of the Cool album (1957, Capitol Records). The Birth of the Cool actually influenced a style that went to the West Coast called West Coast Jazz. And out of this period Miles kept evolving jazz into the 1960's and each decade thereafter until his passing on September 28, 1991.\n\nBeing a gigging musician and working as a sales professional on many different levels for most of my adult life has given me a perspective on the correlation between performance on stage and performance in the sales world as an account manager and even in sales management. Here are 5 points of emphasis to keep your sales at the top of the charts!\n\nYour timing is everything\n\nNever take the relationship with your band members or audience for granted. With the fellow band members it's always about keeping in time with what's going on in the tune. With the audience it's all about bringing it at the right time. Bringing it at the right time means knowing when your audience is ready for a particular solo passage to expand, grow, become exciting and enthusiastic. Miles Davis and his sidemen were masters at this. Knowing your audience means watching and listening to the band as well as the audience and where they are at. This is the peak of improvised work within the ensemble and the performer-audience relationship. For sales this is crucial, for it means listening to your customer! If we do not properly investigate where our customers are at in the process of the sales cycle, we have absolutely no right to offer or properly introduce products or services. We don't care about our audience the moment we stop listening. People want to hear about what you have to say when they know you have their best interests in mind. Know where you are at and when the time is right, always bring it.\n\nSolo Transcription\n\nFor the jazz musician solo transcription is paramount to learning and eventually evolving the art form. Miles Davis spent a lot of time in the first quarter of his life memorizing solos of the musicians he idolized. When he moved to New York City in 1944 he was deeply involved and keenly paying attention to the founders of bebop (Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker) and would find himself creating his own voice within that revolutionary style of music. He worked hard to learn the patterns and scales as well as actually learning improvised solos of his legendary friends. In jazz the hoped inevitability of becoming an original musician is based on two things: The sum of your collective influences- that is the people that you have studied and transcribed/patterned yourself after, and the amount of yourself that you bring to those influences. In sales it's simple: Find success in your organization and pattern your habits after those people. Once you have successfully \"transcribed\" those habits, learn the habits of successful people in other sales verticals. The second part is paramount too, bring your own flavor to the equation. For me it's bringing my nightlife to the day job, for you it could be anything? What makes you different? What is your contribution to the lineage of successful executives in your vertical?\n\nTake it to the Woodshed\n\nTo the professional musician the woodshed is a place of relentless pursuit. It is the pursuit of perfection in ones art form. It is your training and discipline. It is where your lips bleed from practicing the saxophone four to eight hours per day. It's where your fingers callous from playing the guitar all night. It's where the good and the great are separated. Any great musician will tell you that the woodshed actually creates \"musical geniuses\". One of Miles Davis's most influential sidemen (and a great influence in Twentieth Century American music in his own right, perhaps for another post!), John Coltrane was known for his continuous wood shedding. There was a documented part of his life that lasted about 4 years, after he was already known as one of the greatest saxophonists the world has ever known when he played the instrument eight hours a day minimum! It is said that he and his small family would have guests over for dinner and that he would come downstairs to the dinner table with the tenor saxophone still strapped to his neck, and that after dinner while guests were talking to his wife he would ask to be excused and go back upstairs to continue practicing until it was time to go to bed! In sales the woodshed is paramount to success. Training and practice of your craft, both of product knowledge and of the art of selling will dictate not only success among your peers but value to your clients.\n\nDon't let your performance dictate who you are\n\nAt the end of a performance, musicians can often get discouraged thinking about what they played on stage. Another issue is to live in the clouds after bringing the house down or releasing a hit album. I think one of the best lessons learned from Miles Davis was his ability to never be satisfied with where music was at and always looking to evolve and effectually change music as a result. He was responsible for or at the forefront of six major changes or evolutions in the art of jazz (Bebop, Cool Jazz -which influenced West Coast Jazz, Hard Bop, Modal Jazz, and Jazz Fusion). He never regretted his performances which many were critically reviewed, and usually being at the cutting edge of an art form causes this kind of critique. He never got caught up into reliving/rehashing his past successes either, as he always kept his latest sound en vogue for as long as he wanted and unexpectedly brought something new and fresh while his peers where still trying to perfect what he had already done. Many of Miles Davis's personal failures were even catalysts for his professional successes. In your professional career never regret the failures or over hype the successes you have in any industry. Your performance should always usher in a desire to surpass the old garde and bring fresh perspective as products and services find their shelf lives. Don't get caught up into chasing the industry standards for success and don't get caught up into the game of living in professional regret and discouragement. The best cure for failure is new and uniquely different success. The best cure for success is a unique failure to propel yourself to a new success. Failure that grows or evolves into lessons or a new perspective breeds revolution.\n\nGood times\n\nI think the most significant thing I've learned from having a daytime career in sales as well as a nightlife in the music industry is this: Have fun. Miles did what he wanted to do (within the context of his passions) and had great success from it. Enjoy being you and you will thrive within your industry. Whether it's blazing a new path in modern jazz or consulting an organization on their Unified Collaboration, have fun and the enthusiasm (as well as energy) will overflow to others. Let your joy flow into the art and profession, after all it's not all about the bread (You know- cabbage, lettuce, Benjamins, dollars) is it? Charlie Parker once said this: \"If you don't live it, it won't come out of your horn.\" I know Miles must have taken this to heart. If you don't enjoy who you are, no one else will either and your performance will suffer as a result. Miles Davis always had a good time."
