        "text": "Stan Van Gundy: 'You cannot make a case that Anthony Davis had a better career than Dwight Howard'\n\nDuring a recent conversation with ex-NBAers Quentin Richardson and Darius Miles on their show Knuckleheads Podcast, Howard’s former Orlando Magic coach Stan Van Gundy opined that not only did Howard deserve a spot in the league’s recent “NBA 75” (a group of players the league named as its best-ever to commemorate its 75th anniversary last year), but he deserved it in spite of his own Los Angeles teammate, Anthony Davis. SVG’s relationship with Howard famously did not survive their time together in Orlando. “To me, the only guys you could even talk about in his league at that time [of Howard’s peak, from roughly 2008-12] were LeBron and Kobe,” Van Gundy opined. “I think Anthony Davis is great, but at the time they selected [the NBA’s 75th anniversary team in 2022] I mean, it’s not close.” “You cannot make a case that Anthony Davis had a better career than Dwight Howard, that’s absolutely ridiculous.”\n\nSome NBA executives and scouts have noted Brandon Miller’s ability to perform at a high level amid heightened scrutiny after Tuscaloosa detective Branden Culpepper testified that Miller brought former teammate Darius Miles’ gun to him on the night Jamea Jonae Harris was fatally shot after Miles texted him and asked him to do so. Miller has not been charged with a crime. Following threats, Miller was recently accompanied to the NCAA Tournament by an armed security guard. NBA teams have intensified their due diligence on Miller’s off-court background, and any team with a top-five selection is expected to question him at length on the incident during pre-draft meetings. There’s a belief from some around the league that the Pistons could take a close look at Miller if they get the second overall pick in the lottery.\n\nKevin Garnett on playing with Stephon Marbury: 'I thought we were probably gonna get a couple of titles, even with the Shaq and Kobe s***'\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves legend Kevin Garnett says he and Stephon Marbury would have won a couple championships together if Marbury stayed. (via Knuckleheads with Quentin Richardson & Darius Miles): “I thought Steph and I was gonna be forever, and I thought out of that, we was probably gonna get a couple, even with the Shaq and Kobe s***. But yeah, at that time, man, that s*** blew me. Steph leaving Minnesota blew the f*** out of me. I didn’t understand it. To this day, I still don’t understand it. It was Stephon Marbury, it was his decision. It wasn’t an ‘Us’ decision.”"
