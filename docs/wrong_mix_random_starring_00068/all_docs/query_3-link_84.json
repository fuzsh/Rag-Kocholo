        "text": "I thought I would clear up some errors in facts that have been stated in this thread so far.\n\nFirst of all the following information is in regards to a line of domestically released cds titled: \"Prestige 50th anniversary special commemorative edition\". This was a limited edition run of a selected number of tiles from the Prestige catalog. Further, there was a subsequent release of titles from the Prestige domestic line. These were called \"Prestige 20-BIT\". In both cases the 20bitK2 process is highlighted on the cd cases as part of the marketing. You can see the specific titles released here Prestige 50th\n\nFinally, Fantasy jazz released a line called \"20BitK2\" and these are from selected albums from the Riverside and Contemporary catalogs. Information on the specific titles in this series can be found at Riverside OJC. So with regards to these titles the gentlemen's first name is Tmaki. I am getting this information from the back of the cd cover for the Cookin' album. The exact same information is listed on other albums from the three series I named. He is not the actual mastering engineer. He is listed as \"under the supervision of Tamaki beck for jvc studios\". The actual listed \"mastering engineer\" is Shigeo Miyamoto. Finally there is a note that states, \"This album was mastered in analog utilizing the 20-Bit K2 super coding system. No other information is stated in regards to the mastering or engineering information of the series.\n\nWhat did that info above have to do with XRCD or XRCD2, nothing. I just wanted to address the comment made about Mr. Beck engineering the XRCD albums. This is not correct information, what he did have to do was some kind of supervisory position on the albums listed above. Now let me address the information that I know about XRCD and XRCD2. Now this specific information is taken from the XRCD release of Cookin' also. But, it is applicable to all XRCD and XRCD2 as all the one's I have list this same information. XRCD mastering Alan Yoshida under the supervision of Akira Taguchi. The XRCD and the XRCD2 process of course uses the 20-Bit K2 super coding system. Now there are many other steps and processes in the XRCD/XRCD2 system that are done. I am not going to list them all here, you can go to the XRCD web site and read them or look in the inside of an XRCD that lists all the information. Now it doesn't state anywhere on the booklet if the album was mastered in the analog format or not. No other information is stated in regards to the mastering or engineering information of the series.\n\nAs far which cd releases use what master tapes, domestic or Japanese or what generation they are etc, I can't accurately speak to that issue. I can make some guesses based on the little information I know. I do know from the books in the XRCD/XRCD2 series, which state they are mastered at A&M Mastering Studios, Hollywood. And also from talking with Alan that the mastering is done in the United States. I would have to assume it would not be a problem to get the U.S. original masters sense it is being mastered in the U.S. As for the prestige anniversary editions, I cannot speak to where they are mastered, that is what country and what master tapes they use.\n\nSo now we know that the XRCD releases are mastered by a different individual then Mr. Beck. That of course is bound to make the XRCD sound differently then the Prestige. My point here is that the Fantasy issues, such as have the Credence have nothing to do with the XRCD line. Again I would also say that the K2 process, is mearly a step in the process, not something as to blame for how something sounds a certain way. As such I wouldn't take any comments about what Mr. Beck does with mastering to have any factor in the sound of the XRCD albums.\n\nThis statement is filled with so many non-qualified statements, you should, as someone reading it, should immediately dismiss it. The \"tape hiss is so tipped up at to be laughable\", in relation to what? Have you heard the master tapes? Is that what it is in relation too? Perhaps in relation to the Prestige anniversary cd editions? Perhaps in relation to the DCC cd releases? Perhaps in relation to the domestic Fantasy releases? Etc. etc. If tipped up you mean you can hear tape hiss, this doesn't mean its tipped up. It means it's letting hear what is on the master tapes. Many of Mr. Hoffman's releases have easily heard tape hiss. This also let's you know there isn't some kind of tomfoolery with noise reduction going on, which of course is always a good thing. \"And the bass is so tweeked out\", again in relation to what. Did you get to sit in the recording session so you know exactly what that bass sounded like at the mike? Perhaps in relation to any of the other recorded media versions of the album? A reader just can't tell because a qualified statement isn't made. This is just an \"end-all\" statement made with out any qualification. I personally, don't find the base on any of the XRCD to be tweaked out, bloated, out of control, or any of the other phrases used to indicate too much bass, at least not because of a mastering issue.\n\n\"It doesn't sound like live music\", well I am not sure what live music your talking about. Again, no qualification of the statement. Most of the time, in my opinion, live music sounds terrible. Bad PA systems, or in house systems you have to listen though. Maybe, Out of tune instruments, you're too far away, things blocking your sound window, noisy people around you, etc. If however in \"live\" statement you mean the album sounds more real, more in the room with you, closer to the sound of the specific instrument, etc. then that's a more accurate statement to make. Of course I totally agree with that statement, and you that should be more of what you want to is what you\n\nFinally for the board's information, Mr. Yoshida will be happy to play back an XRCD for you from his very own system. He takes it to CES every year. It includes Levison electronics and Wilson Audio speakers. No Tannoy speakers there. My point is not to state if Tannoy speakers are good or bad, but to state that the mastering engineer for the XRCD series defiantly isn't mastering with a set of Tannoys in mind. He has also stated that they use a very similar monitoring system when he is mastering. Further, he is someone who believes in the ideas of clean power, cables do affect the sound quality, etc. And, he has a real love of music. Actually if any of you are going to CES, I highly recommend you go to Alexis Park and find the room with the XRCD demo's. They will play anything you want and Mr. Yoshida is more then happy to talk shop with anyone.\n\nLet me state what I think are the differences between what I HEAR on MY SYSTEM with the DCC vs. the XRCD. I have a system, which personally tends to error to a little bright/aggressive. However, I don't find the XRCD bright, tipped up, exaggerated or any other adjective. They do have an amazing amount of detail in the higher end of the frequency spectrum, so much so if you were to compare them to domestic standard releases you might think hearing those they have too much. The piano has great attack and nice delineation between the keys. The XRCD have excellent rhythm that just takes you right into the music. I also find the sound very balanced, not out of proportion at any part of the spectrum.\n\nOn the other hand the DCC do indeed have warmth to them. It's very appealing sound and adds a great almost smoothness to the trumpet. It also does this to the cymbals. Again, it adds slight warmth to the piano. I don't like to use the word warmth, but really cant think of a better adjective. The DCC also have a great sense of rhythm, but its different then the XRCD. It's more laid back and relaxed, the XRCD definitely sound more intense and driven. Now the DCC don't have the same amount of detail in any of the frequencies, nor would I expect them to given the date there were mastered in and the state of the AtoD at that time and other factors I am sure.\n\nThe bottom line is personally I think you can't go wrong with either. I own both sets, so that should tell you a lot. One day I may be in the mood for a certain \"character\" of sound. However, if you have a particular system that leans towards a certain sound, you might want to adjust what you seek out one vs. the other. CD is still not perfect sound. So you have to figure eventually you will replace whatever cd you choose with some hi-rez format anyway. Now these being premier recordings for Davis, you shouldn't have to wait too long to get a hi-rez version of these albums. As has been stated above one of them is already slated for SACD. At any rate, my point is get what you think will fill your system sound better, and of course let your money be your guide if that is an issue. Hope I didn't bore the crap out of everyone. LOL.\n\nThanks, for the word \"chracter\" Camarillo, I liberated it and went back and added into my post.\n\n[ January 03, 2002: Message edited by: notinear ]"
