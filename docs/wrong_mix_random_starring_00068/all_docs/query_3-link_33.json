Then Paul go into the bass, (vocalizing). - (vocalizing) Man, that was the first thing I ever heard from Miles.\n\nGrabbed the record out of my father's record collection, put it on.\n\nFirst thing that catches your ear is Paul Chambers playing that bass line.\n\n('Kind of Blue playing) - We can't even question the sacred texts that we have, right, like you know, I mean why is the bible the bible?\n\nIt's the bible, you know?\n\nI mean, why is 'Kind of Blue' 'Kind of Blue'? It's kind of blue, like it just is and it changed the sound of jazz.\n\n('Kind of Blue' playing) - The cymbal crash had just started so what I thought, I had overdone it.\n\nIt sounded louder than it should have been to me.\n\n- And it seems to ring forever, but it brings you right into the tune.\n\nIt's like you've hit the highway and the rest of the tune just takes off.\n\n('Kind of Blue' trumpet)"
