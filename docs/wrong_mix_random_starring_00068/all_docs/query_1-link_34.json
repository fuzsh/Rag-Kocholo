        "text": "THE Help and Fried Green Tomatoes award winning actress Cicely Tyson, has passed away at the age of 96.\n\nThe late actress was married twice during her long life, here’s a look at her husbands Miles Davis and Kenneth Franklin.\n\nWho was Tyson married to?\n\nKenneth Franklin\n\nAt the age of just 18, Tyson married her first husband, Kenneth Franklin, on December 27, 1942.\n\nBut he abandoned her after less than eighteen months of marriage, according to Tyson’s divorce decree.\n\nTheir brief courtship is thought to have fizzled out pretty quickly after initially forging a strong connection.\n\nThe court document also confirms that their brief marriage was officially dissolved in 1956.\n\nMiles Davis\n\nTyson first dated jazz trumpeter Miles Davis in the 1960s when he was in the process of divorcing dancer Frances Davis.\n\nHe used a photo of Tyson for his 1967 album, Sorcerer.\n\nAt the time Davis told the press that he intended to marry Tyson in March 1968 after his divorce was finalized, but he backtracked and married singer Betty Mabry that September.\n\nTyson and Davis rekindled their relationship in 1978, and got married three years later on November 26, 1981.\n\nTyson was married to the jazz trumpet legend from 1981 to 1988.\n\nThe wedding ceremony was conducted by Atlanta's mayor, Andrew Young, at the lavish house of actor Bill Cosby.\n\nThey were married for nine years, before divorcing in 1988.\n\nSources said that Davis had a volatile temper and was suspected of infidelity.\n\nThey never welcomed any children, but while they were together Davis credited his wife for helping him with his cocaine addiction.\n\nTheir divorce was finalised in 1989, two years before Davis died in 1991."
