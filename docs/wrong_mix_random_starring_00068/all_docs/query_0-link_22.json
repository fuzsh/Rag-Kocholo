        "text": "Eighteen former NBA players were charged Thursday in connection to a health care fraud scheme, according to federal court documents.\n\nThe scheme involved fake reimbursement claims for medical and dental services that were not received.\n\nAccording to court documents, the claims totaled nearly $4 million and the defendants received about $2.5 million in kickbacks from the scheme which lasted from at least 2017 to 2020.\n\n\"The defendants' playbook involved fraud and deception,\" Audrey Strauss, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a news conference. \"Thanks to the hard work of our law enforcement partners, their alleged scheme has been disrupted and they will have to answer for their flagrant violations of law.\"\n\nHere's what we know so far about the alleged NBA fraud scheme.\n\nWho are the 18 NBA players who were charged?\n\nAccording to court documents, here are the 18 NBA players who were charged in the fraud scheme:\n\nTerrence Williams\n\nAlan Anderson,\n\nAnthony Allen\n\nShannon Brown\n\nWilliam Bynum\n\nGlen Davis\n\nChris Douglas-Roberts\n\nMelvin Ely\n\nJamario Moon\n\nDarius Miles\n\nMilton Palacio\n\nRuben Patterson\n\nEddie Robinson\n\nGregory Smith\n\nSebastian Telfair\n\nCharles Watson Jr.\n\nAntoine Wright\n\nTony Wroten\n\nTony Allen's wife, Desiree, has also been charged in connection with the scheme.\n\nNBA: 2021-22 NBA Championship odds, picks and predictions\n\nWho is the GOAT?: Ranking the greatest 75 NBA players of all time, the Top 25: Counting down to No. 1\n\n4 of the charged NBA players have ties to Memphis\n\nFormer Memphis Grizzlies players, Tony Allen, Darius Miles and Tony Wroten, and former Memphis Tiger Chris Douglas-Roberts are among those chain the NBA fraud scheme.\n\nAllen is a former Memphis Grizzlies player from 2010-2017 after four seasons with the Boston Celtics. Following Allen's 2017 season, the Grizzlies announced the No. 9 jersey would be retired when Allen retires. Allen finished his Grizzlies career with six NBA All-Time Defensive Teams recognitions before a stint with the New Orleans Pelicans. He was later waived by the Chicago Bulls.\n\nAllen received $265,000 for chiropractic services and $155,075 for dental services and Douglas-Roberts received $117,123.24 in reimbursements for chiropractic services, according to court records.\n\nMiles signed with the Grizzlies in 2008 but was renounced in the summer of 2009 to save cap room. Wroten was selected by the Grizzlies with the No. 25 overall pick in the 2012 NBA Draft. He was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers the following year.\n\nDouglas-Roberts earned All-American honors at the end of his junior year at Memphis. His junior year squad finished runner-up in the 2008 NCAA Tournament under head coach John Calipari. Douglas-Roberts was selected by the New Jersey Nets with the No. 40 overall pick in the 2008 NBA Draft.\n\nMemphis Grizzlies: Memphis Grizzlies, Ja Morant win preseason opener after fire alarm suspends game\n\nMemphis Tigers: Watch Emoni Bates, Jalen Duren and other highlights from pro day\n\nWhat are the NBA players charged with?\n\nAll 18 defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit health care fraud and wire fraud.\n\nTerrence Williams faces an additional charge of aggravated identity theft.\n\nTony Allen's wife, Desiree, was charged in connection to the scheme.\n\nWhat were the fraudulent activities the NBA players were charged for?\n\nDefendants claimed to receive medical treatment on a specific date when they were not in the same state or country at the time of treatment, according to court records.\n\nOther cases show multiple defendants sought reimbursement for the same medical treatment on the same date. For example, Tony Allen, Glen Davis and Tony Wroten all claimed they had root canals on the same six teeth on the same date. Allen and Wroten also claimed they got root canals on the same 13 teeth on the same date two years later, but neither player was in California on the date of those visits, court records show.\n\nAllen was advised to replay all the money he received after an NBA board of trustees said his claims shouldn't have been approved. He repaid $350,075 of the $420,075 he owed.\n\nNFL fraud scheme: Former NFL players, including Clinton Portis, charged with defrauding league health care program\n\nWere the NBA players arrested?\n\nAudrey Strauss, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said the FBI arrested 16 of the defendants Thursday morning.\n\nSebastian Telfair is due to appear in a New York courtroom later Thursday, Strauss said.\n\nThe others will appear in the districts in which they were arrested, she said.\n\nWho was the ringleader of the NBA fraud scheme?\n\nStrauss referred to Terrance Williams as \"the linchpin\" of the NBA fraud scheme.\n\nWilliams, who played basketball at Louisville and spent four seasons in the NBA with the Nets, Rockets, Kings and Celtics, allegedly submitted a fabricated invoice from a chiropractor's office in November 2017 for treatment he didn't receive.\n\nHe was reimbursed more than $7,600 through the NBA Players' Health and Welfare Benefit plan.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Williams recruited other players to join in on the scheme and would send fake invoices to other former NBA players in return for a cut of the reimbursements.\n\nProsecutors allege that Williams ultimately received at least $230,000 in kickbacks.\n\nTony Allen and Chris Douglas-Roberts were not named as players who paid Williams, but prosecutors claim they both received reimbursements for treatment they didn't receive in person.\n\nRead the court documents here\n\nEvan Barnes, Tom Schad and Jeff Zillgitt contrbuted to this report."
