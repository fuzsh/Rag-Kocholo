        "text": "Part of that came from a class divide that barely makes sense in 2024; cops were hardly on the side of justice, but, in terms of their position in the social world of the films, they are not so far removed from the criminals. Both wear trench coats and hats, smoking is absolutely required, and the guns are janky lil’ pistols that are usually fired once if at all. The manner native to both sides is Generally Cinematic, and in Elevator to the Gallows, there is not really a lot of sense or intensity to the crime at its center, which involves some grappling hooks (retrieved by a child?) and a long and baffling stretch of a character trapped inside an elevator. What is more important is looking cool, and in the middle of the 20th century, cops and criminals had only one job in movies: look cooler than civilians.\n\nWhen Davis told his brother Vernon, infamously, “Fuck jazz! Alex North is the man,” it doesn’t now seem to mean that Miles simply wanted to, like North, record more often with string sections or score Hollywood movies. My take is that Davis was moving towards something he would chase for the next 20 years, until the end of the ’70s: a way of working with time differently, of playing less and having more happen. I have chosen to believe that the part of his quote about North is not all that specific, and that when Davis says “fuck jazz,” he means only what has come before, not all of jazz to come.\n\nFor Ascenseur, Davis composed a few themes in his hotel after seeing some scenes of the movie and then recorded the entire album in three hours and some change with the band, stopping and starting as Malle (also in the studio) added his own minor instructions. In the autobiography, Davis barely mentions the project: “While I was in Paris writing the music for Malle’s film, I was playing at the Club St. Germain … I remember this gig because a lot of French critics got mad when I wouldn’t talk from the bandstand and introduce tunes like everyone else did, because I thought the music spoke for itself.” (There is talk in the book of his relationship with the singer Juliette Gréco, though Davis spent more time with Urtreger’s sister Jeannette, who goes unmentioned.)\n\nBassist Pierre Michelot gave an interview in 1988 that opens up the story. The five musicians had been playing dates together, so they were in sync. “We arrived at the Poste Parisien around 10pm, Jeanne Moreau was there, and we all had a drink together,” Michelot said. Her presence that night in the lead up to the recording feels necessary, as it is Moreau who is at the center of what makes Elevator still valuable as both film and music. Scenes of her walking around Paris, almost getting hit by cars, and staring dolefully at boys playing pinball is where the second half of the 20th century begins. These scenes are the seed of Bernard Herrmann’s jazz soundtrack for Taxi Driver (1976), and of all of Scorsese’s shots of watery and luscious red stoplights paired with sliding horns, the city as psychic fishbowl and inherently melancholic space. For Malle, it is Davis and a big blinking Kronenbourg sign. Who the fuck knows what else this film is about!\n\nThese filmed urban spaces are peaceful—no matter how violent these 20th-century cop films eventually became, the city is presented in Elevator as a valley between pressures, not the pressure itself. That changes with Michael Mann’s Heat in 1995, the moment when cop movies became militarized and gallons of bullet casings began to roll through the streets. A metabolization of the Rodney King riots three years earlier, Heat tells us that the specter of policing can no longer be cloaked in the soft fabrics of trench coats and floppy hats. For Malle and Davis, back in the middle of the American century, we are still flâneurs, not yet targets.\n\nMoreau is one of the figures in the film who brings out the music, literally: the music tends to arrive when she does, Michelot’s bass loping into the audible field as Moreau walks mopily down the street, all of us unsure what we’re doing. Elevator did not use all of Davis’s music, even though the final commercial album last over an hour. The 18 minutes Malle chose were used for what is often described as “mood,” which, as a musical idea, is a way of describing the capturing of time, not necessarily events and information. This is an essentially cinematic state, but when Davis goes back to New York, makes up with John Coltrane, and ushers in a massive sea change with Kind of Blue, the roots of which can be found in Ascenseur’s vague themes, that revolution is described with musical terms like “modal.” That is not inaccurate, but what Davis is channeling comes first from cinema, and second from music, the Barthesian sense of jouissance: bliss and boredom conjoined on the boulevard. Moreau was vibing, in other words.\n\nReturning to Michelot: “Miles was very relaxed, as if the music he was playing wasn’t that important. It was only later that I learned he’d already been to a screening, and that he’d known about the project for several weeks.” Davis gave the musicians minimal guidelines—like “play two chords - D minor and C 7 - with four bars each, ad lib”—and sometimes the director did, in different terms. “Malle gave certain indications that he couldn’t express in the way a musical technician would, but he knew how to make himself understood clearly enough to get what he wanted.”\n\nThis approach eventually became part of what we know now as New Age or ambient: “the absence of a specific theme,” as Michelot put it. “This was new for the period, especially with the soundtrack for a film,” he said. “We only had the most succinct guidance from Miles.” Davis was interested in “structures of some kind,” while Malle apparently said that the “music ought to be in counterpoint to the image.” The key here is to understand that everything initially dismissed in genres like New Age is the result of an insane academic obsession with written music and traditional virtuosity. Audiences? They didn’t care, but advances like Davis’s had to be described through harmonic terms like “modal” because people hadn’t yet caught up with movies like Elevator.\n\nWatching Moreau wander through Paris at night precisely without the burden of plot was a major development, an echo of Tarkovsky’s men forever wading through water, and of Ozu’s seated, suffering spouses waiting for the next rhombus of interstitial black to relieve the tension. The sheer act of being filmed in an urban space, subject to a cinematic eye that treated criminals and cops (also workers) equally, gives an illusory class solidarity to all participants. This is part of our third disintegration, that of jazz itself. A schism occurs, one that still maddens the purists who want Real Players and Real Compositions, involving mood and tone and form and the recording process itself. The cinematic eye creates paintings, frame by frame, but so does a recording device in a studio. Davis allowed jazz to find its electric ground water, a bubbling pace that matches the pace of life in the city and time under the clock of bosses. No themes, no masters, no plots. If there is no plot, we have come to the meditative state, which is far from anodyne. Here we confront ourselves, the most terrifying experience of all, worse than even the cops.\n\nSasha Frere-Jones is a writer and musician from New York.
