        "text": "• NBA Draft 2024: Complete coverage\n\n• Download the NBA App\n\nEditor’s Note: Find more of Jonathan Wasserman’s coverage of the 2024 Draft on Bleacher Report or to read this article on BleacherReport.com, click here.\n\n(B/R) — Draft ranges for the majority of NBA prospects are becoming clearer during workout season.\n\nTeams are still guessing what the Atlanta Hawks do at No. 1, however. And as much as every front office remains focused on completing their rankings for June 26, they’re also asking around the league, trying to figure out what their competitors are going to do.\n\nKnowing who others team favor is important for those deciding whether they need to explore trading up (and how high).\n\nThe Houston Rockets are expected to be active in finding a trade partner. Teams are still waiting to hear what doctors say about Nikola Topić’s knee injury. And there seems to be a lot of interest in this year’s bigs, who continue to rise in our projections.\n\nWe also made one big change in our top five based on conversations around the league.\n\n1. Atlanta Hawks: Zaccharie Risacher\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 1\n\nTeam: JL Bourg-en-Bresse\n\nPosition: SG/SF\n\nSize: 6-foot-8, 204 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 19\n\nNationality: French\n\nPro Comparison: Harrison Barnes\n\nRival teams continue to guess who the Atlanta Hawks prefer at No. 1. And we continue to give the edge to Zaccharie Risacher, a perceived safe pick with a valued archetype and pathways to improve and bust through the three-and-D level that he brings to JL Bourg.\n\nWhile scouts continue to debate the height of Risacher’s ceiling, there is a perceived level of certainty tied to his positional size, shooting and defensive tools/quickness. That could sway the Hawks to lean his way without a sure-thing star at the top. Injury problems with Saddiq Bey and AJ Griffin could also help the case for Risacher to Atlanta.\n\n2. Washington Wizards: Alex Sarr\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 2\n\nTeam: Perth Wildcats\n\nPosition: PF/C\n\nSize: 7’0″, 224 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 19\n\nNationality: French\n\nPro Comparison: Evan Mobley\n\nTeams and agents believe that if the Atlanta Hawks don’t draft Alex Sarr, the Washington Wizards will take him at No. 2. He’s expected to work out for the Wizards in the near future.\n\nWith Washington expected to be patient during its rebuild, it should be fitting suitors for the 19-year-old. Some scouts and executives have questioned his offensive polish for a potential No. 1 overall pick.\n\nThe rise and success of defensive bigs with perimeter skill sets—Evan Mobley, Jaren Jackson Jr., Chet Holmgren, Victor Wembanyama—adds to the allure of Sarr.\n\nHe measured well in Chicago, coming in at just under 7’0″ in socks, 224 pounds with a 7-foot-4 wingspan. At that size, the ability to slide his feet, handle in the open floor and shoot off the dribble separates him from other centers.\n\nThe Wizards will eventually need to find a point guard, but at No. 2, Sarr’s physical talent, evolving skill versatility and defense create visions of upside that could be difficult to resist.\n\n3. Houston Rockets: Reed Sheppard\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 3\n\nTeam: Kentucky\n\nPosition: PG/SG\n\nSize: 6-foot-2, 182 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 19, Freshman\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: Donte DiVincenzo\n\nRival teams say No. 3 is for sale. There isn’t much room on the Houston Rockets’ roster for another young project, and the team plans to exit the rebuilding stage for a run up the standings. Adding another veteran or even a future pick in a perceived better draft may sound more appealing to Houston than No. 3 in 2024.\n\nWe’re also hearing some reluctance from rival teams about giving up assets to move up that high, when the difference between No. 3 and late-lottery feels minimal.\n\nAs intriguing as Donovan Clingan is for a defense-needy roster, we haven’t heard teams think of him as a savior.\n\nIf the Rockets stick, they should love what Reed Sheppard brings to their rotation: elite shooting, passing and intangibles/character that scouts and executives praised after interviewing him at the NBA combine.\n\nFor Sheppard, an undersized 2 who’s more limited off the dribble, Amen Thompson would also be the ideal backcourt partner with his creation/playmaking and ability to defend bigger guards.\n\nAnd Sheppard feels perfect for Thompson with his ability to stretch the floor and create space for a limited shooter and shifty ball-handler.\n\n4. San Antonio Spurs: Matas Buzelis\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 4\n\nTeam: G League Ignite\n\nPosition: SF\n\nSize: 6-foot-9, 197 lbs\n\nAge: 19\n\nNationality: American/Lithuanian\n\nPro Comparison: Lamar Odom\n\nThere has been positive chatter from different circles around Matas Buzelis during the predraft process.\n\nTeams are expecting him to go before Ignite teammate Ron Holland, and it feels like the intrigue around his athleticism and scoring versatility—and the upside it theoretically creates—continues to grow among teams trying to determine their top prospects during this final evaluation period.\n\nWe’re hearing he’s being considered in the top five. The San Antonio Spurs should be able to guarantee themselves one of Nikola Topić, Rob Dillingham or Devin Carter at No. 8. Stephon Castle figures to be in play at No. 4, but Buzelis offers superior positional size and athleticism, better shooting and more flashes of shotmaking diversity.\n\n5. Detroit Pistons: Cody Williams\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 13\n\nTeam: Colorado\n\nPosition: SF/PF\n\nSize: 6-foot-7, 178 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 19, Freshman\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: Jaden McDaniels\n\nNo. 5 could be a spot late-lottery teams want to trade up to for a chance to draft Donovan Clingan. Rival teams also continue to predict that Cody Williams will be picked earlier than most expect, potentially by the Detroit Pistons at No. 5 or the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nThe pitch to Williams revolves around a coveted, big-wing archetype, his efficiency at Colorado and the belief that he has the mentality and blueprint (being Jalen’s brother) to continue improving and maximize his potential.\n\nWilliams would be an easy fit in Detroit, either at the 3 or the 4, particularly if he even gets close to his 41.5 three-point percentage from college.\n\n6. Charlotte Hornets: Stephon Castle\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 6\n\nTeam: Connecticut\n\nPosition: SG\n\nSize: 6-foot-6, 210 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 19, Freshman\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: Anthony Black\n\nEvery team in the lottery will discuss Stephon Castle. They’re all going to covet the idea of a 6-foot-6 defensive stopper who handles the ball and passes, possesses great positional strength and just needs some improved shooting touch to unlock a unique potential trajectory and archetype.\n\nHe’s a strong fit between shotmakers LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller. The Hornets would value his ball-moving, defense and winning intangibles.\n\n7. Portland Trail Blazers: Donovan Clingan\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 5\n\nTeam: Connecticut\n\nPosition: C\n\nSize: 7-foot-2, 282 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 20, Sophomore\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: Roy Hibbert\n\nThere is interest from teams in trading up for Donovan Clingan. The question is how early and at what cost. The Portland Trail Blazers are thought to be a floor landing spot, where he identifies as a best player available, although late-lottery teams could also look to move up to No. 7 with the Blazers also picking again at No. 14.\n\nFor Portland, he’d add a different element of physicality and rim protection to the rotation. The Blazers wouldn’t have room for Rob Dillingham. Ron Holland’s shooting raises questions about his fit, and Clingan is simply too rare of a prospect compared to 23-year-old Dalton Knecht.\n\n8. San Antonio Spurs (via Raptors): Devin Carter\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 8\n\nTeam: Providence\n\nPosition: PG/SG\n\nSize: 6-foot-2, 193 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 22, Junior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Derrick White\n\nSources say the San Antonio Spurs are high on Devin Carter, who just completed workouts with the Sacramento Kings and Chicago Bulls.\n\nNikola Topić’s ACL tear could give Carter an extra edge at No. 8.\n\nOne of the top perimeter defenders in the draft with a 6-foot-9 wingspan and 77 career blocks at 6-foot-2 in socks, he also developed into one of the nation’s best pick-and-roll ball-handlers and a much improved shotmaker this season at Providence.\n\n9. Memphis Grizzlies: Ron Holland\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 9\n\nTeam: G League Ignite\n\nPosition: SF\n\nSize: 6-foot-7, 197 lbs\n\nAge: 18\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Cam Whitmore\n\nRon Holland didn’t win over NBA teams with his jumper during his pro day. He’s a candidate to slide with scouts feeling comfortable about Dalton Knecht’s shooting and more compelled by Matas Buzelis’ shotmaking and versatility, and Stephon Castle’s playmaking, defense and impact on winning.\n\nThis still feels late and like good value for an explosive, 18-year-old wing who averaged 19.5 points in the G League.\n\nThe losses, poor shooting and suspect decision-making have turned certain scouts off, but even without a reliable jump shot or high-level creation, he still put up big numbers using his speed, improved ball-handling, athleticism around the basket and streak shotmaking.\n\n10. Utah Jazz: Dalton Knecht\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 7\n\nTeam: Tennessee\n\nPosition: SG/SF\n\nSize: 6-foot-5, 212 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 23, Senior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: Wally Szczerbiak\n\nAfter drafting three freshmen in last year’s first round, the Utah Jazz may be more inclined to add an NBA-ready player with a coveted, surefire skill. There is a level of certainty tied to Dalton Knecht’s shooting and shotmaking versatility. He’s an easy offensive fit with his off-ball skill set, though tough drives and athletic finishes in transition suggest Knecht has more to his game than a specialist’s.\n\nWe’re hearing the interest in Knecht starts at No. 6 with the Hornets. But teams more enticed by younger prospects with theoretical higher ceilings could allow Utah to grab the 23-year-old at No. 10.\n\n11. Chicago Bulls: Rob Dillingham\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 10\n\nTeam: Kentucky\n\nPosition: PG/SG\n\nSize: 6-foot-1, 164 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 19, Freshman\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: Lou Williams\n\nThough Rob Dillingham has yet to work out for teams, he’s starting to sound like a candidate who could slide.\n\nThe Detroit Pistons and Portland Trail Blazers seem unlikely to target him based on their current backcourts. The Charlotte Hornets could be an option, although they finished No. 29 in defense. League sources believe the San Antonio Spurs aren’t likely based on what they’re signaling to agents. We’re hearing teams prefer bigger positional prospects.\n\nAt No. 11, the Chicago Bulls may see too good of a buy-low opportunity on Dillingham, who could either provide instant offense off the bench or insurance/depth in case of any tempting Zach LaVine deals.\n\n12. Oklahoma City Thunder (via Rockets): Tidjane Salaun\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 12\n\nTeam: Cholet\n\nPosition: PF\n\nSize: 6-foot-9, 212 lbs\n\nAge: 18\n\nNationality: French\n\nPro comparison: Obi Toppin\n\nTidjane Salaun is earning workouts with top-10 teams, including the San Antonio Spurs and Detroit Pistons. The late lottery is now seen as the floor for the 18-year-old forward who made 75 total threes in 54 total games with Cholet.\n\nThough the Thunder are officially in win-now mode for a title run, Salaun started playoff games in LNB Pro A. He could be ready for a smaller role, but the same one he had with Cholet, playing to his strength as a rim-runner, finisher and spot-up shooter.\n\n13. Sacramento Kings: Kel’el Ware\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 17\n\nTeam: Indiana\n\nPosition: C\n\nSize: 7’0″, 230 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 20, Sophomore\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: Brook Lopez\n\nAn impressive pro day of shooting has had teams buzzing about Kel’el Ware. Sources say he’s generating realistic consideration in the late lottery.\n\nThe narrative about his underwhelming motor has seemingly been squashed.\n\nWare figures to look highly enticing in a workout setting that can showcase his athleticism at the rim, mobility and high shotmaking skill level.\n\n14. Portland Trail Blazers (via Warriors): Tristan da Silva\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 20\n\nSchool/team: Colorado\n\nPosition: SF/PF\n\nSize: 6-foot-8, 217 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 23, Senior\n\nNationality: German/Brazilian\n\nPro comparison: Trey Lyles\n\nTristan da Silva will visit mid-first-round teams on his workout tour. Teams all seem to like his positional size, shooting versatility and all-around polish, on and off the floor. The question is how much a team loves him.\n\nHis athletic limitations could restrict him at both ends of the floor, getting to and finishing at the rim or stopping quicker wings and stronger 4s.\n\nTeams valuing safety and shooting over upside could be drawn to da Silva in the late lottery or teens.\n\n15. Miami Heat: Nikola Topić\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 11\n\nTeam: KK Crvena Zvezda\n\nPosition: PG\n\nSize: 6-foot-6, 198 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 18\n\nNationality: Serbian\n\nPro Comparison: Goran Dragić\n\nTeams were informed of Nikola Topić’s torn ACL at the NBA’s combine in Treviso, held for those who missed out on Chicago. The diagnosis obviously won’t help teams that were previously on the fence.\n\nTeams are still waiting for U.S. doctors to examine Topić’s knee. Some have speculated that he may need surgery. The question is whether that will impact how front offices value the 6-foot-6 point guard.\n\nAs long as they don’t throw red flags at results that hint at long-term vulnerability, a lottery team may be willing to wait for a big playmaker who’s had success creating for teammates and attacking in pro leagues overseas.\n\n16. Philadelphia 76ers: Ja’Kobe Walter\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 18\n\nTeam: Baylor\n\nPosition: SG/SF\n\nSize: 6-foot-4, 198 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 19, Freshman\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Kentavious Caldwell-Pope\n\nNo new updates were made to Ja’Kobe Walter’s scouting report after the NBA combine. His measurements, middle-of-the-pack athletic tests and promising shotmaking sequences were all expected.\n\nHe will get pegged with a safe label that sees a three-and-D 2-guard who can defend both wing positions. The lack of creation and playmaking may make it tougher for teams to picture upside worth a top-10 pick.\n\n17. Los Angeles Lakers: Zach Edey\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 19\n\nSchool/Team: Purdue\n\nPosition: C\n\nSize: 7-foot-4, 299 lbs\n\nAge: 22, Senior\n\nNationality: Canadian\n\nPro comparison: Jonas Valančiūnas\n\nRival teams believe Zach Edey could go in the lottery. While there are still skeptics, it also sounds like some teams will be willing to take a chance that 7-foot-4 size, improved mobility and inside touch could translate to effective offensive rebounding, post scoring, rim protection and adequate enough defensive foot speed in space.\n\n18. Orlando Magic: Jared McCain\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 15\n\nTeam: Duke\n\nPosition: PG/SG\n\nSize: 6-foot-2, 203 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 20, Freshman\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: Immanuel Quickley\n\nJared McCain put on some impressive shooting displays during drills at the combine, showing textbook repetition of form. Shotmaking has and will always be what powers his offense and value, but McCain’s effectiveness this year in ball-screen situations, using change of speed, footwork, crafty finishing and vision, point to more on-ball upside with his creativity and feel.\n\n19. Toronto Raptors (via Pacers): Kyshawn George\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 14\n\nTeam: Miami\n\nPosition: SG/SF\n\nSize: 6-foot-7, 209 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 20, Freshman\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: Dalano Banton\n\nKyshawn George visited the Portland Trail Blazers on Tuesday, and he’ll be working out for most teams in the late lottery to mid-first round.\n\nScouts have been drawn to his size for a guard, shooting and ball-handling, a combination that creates an enticing archetype. His lack of strength and explosion inside the arc does hint at risk, but if he’ll receive interest in the teens as a 6-foot-7 live-dribble passer who shot 40.8 percent from three.\n\n20. Cleveland Cavaliers: Carlton Carrington\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 23\n\nSchool/team: Pittsburgh\n\nPosition: PG/SG\n\nSize: 6-foot-4, 195 lbs\n\nAge: 18, Freshman\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Nickeil Alexander-Walker\n\nCarlton Carrington has teams’ attention in the late lottery. He shot extremely well during shooting drills after measuring just under 6-foot-4 in socks with a 6-foot-8 wingspan. He’s one of the draft’s youngest prospects with positional size, serious shotmaking production and enough passing ability for teams to picture a point guard.\n\nHe didn’t get to the rim much, and a 1.0 steal rate highlights some real concerns over his quickness for a guard. But teams won’t overthink athleticism or numbers as much this late in this particular draft.\n\n21. New Orleans Pelicans (via Bucks): Yves Missi\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 21\n\nSchool: Baylor\n\nPosition: C\n\nSize: 6-foot-11, 229 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 20, Freshman\n\nNationality: Cameroonian\n\nPro comparison: Nic Claxton\n\nYves Missi measured well at nearly 6-foot-11 in socks with a 7-foot-2 wingspan. He should start to draw mid-to-late first-round interest from teams that covet his defensive upside as a rim protector and his ability to move his feet around the perimeter and recover in pick-and-roll coverage.\n\nThe offense is a bonus, but Baylor ran plenty of actions for Missi around the top of the key, where he showed he can face up, put the ball down and attack opposing bigs.\n\n22. Phoenix Suns: DaRon Holmes II\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 30\n\nSchool/team: Dayton\n\nPosition: C\n\nSize: 6-foot-9, 236 lbs\n\nAge: 21, Junior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Trayce Jackson-Davis\n\nThere is first-round interest in DaRon Holmes II, who seemingly has a wide draft range and teams mystified about his stock.\n\nHe made plenty of jump shots during shooting drills at the combine. And more strong shooting during workouts will continue to help, as scouts have been debating how much to buy this year’s 38.6 percent mark from three.\n\nHe entered this pre-draft process with more momentum than he had last year. Improved range, handles/body control attacking the basket and passing have raised his draft stock, and he’s coming off a 23-point, 11-rebound, three-assist, four-stock game with a pair of threes against Arizona in the NCAA tournament.\n\n23. Milwaukee Bucks (via Pelicans): Isaiah Collier\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 16\n\nTeam: USC\n\nPosition: PG\n\nSize: 6-foot-3, 205 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 19, Freshman\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: Tyreke Evans\n\nListed as 6-foot-5 by USC, Isaiah Collier measured 6’2.5″ (socks) with a near 6-foot-5 wingspan at the NBA combine. He also didn’t shoot that well during drills, and teams will be looking closely into his almost set jump shot during workouts.\n\nStill, the draw to Collier is his shiftiness for creativity, physicality attacking and finishing and live-dribble passing skill. Teams that think his jump shot and decision-making should improve will see more upside than those worried about his low-volume three-point numbers and turnovers.\n\nBut even teams with those concerns may be interested in Collier’s ability to break down defenses, make plays off the bounce and put pressure on the rim.\n\n24. New York Knicks (via Mavericks): Ryan Dunn\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 24\n\nSchool/team: Virginia\n\nPosition: PF\n\nSize: 6-foot-6, 214 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 21, Sophomore\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Matisse Thybulle\n\nThe Knicks felt the payoff of having a big-wing defender like OG Anubody. Ryan Dunn could give them another one whose court coverage and play-disrupting around the basket led to some wild steal and block rates.\n\nThe New York native already worked out for the Knicks and seems to be a Tom Thibodeau-type role player.\n\n25. New York Knicks: Tyler Smith\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 26\n\nTeam: Ignite\n\nPosition: PF\n\nSize: 6-foot-9, 224 lbs\n\nAge: 19\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Channing Frye\n\nTyler Smith didn’t shoot as well at the combine as the Ignite highlights and numbers suggest he could. It won’t mean much unless he struggles through workouts.\n\nShotmaking is the main draw to Smith, who measured 6-foot-9 with a 7-foot-1 wingspan.\n\nLimited evidence of him putting the ball down may keep teams from seeing paths to upside. Regardless, midway through the first round interest will start to build in a stretch big with strong tools and athleticism for play-finishing around the basket.\n\n26. Washington Wizards (via Clippers): Jaylon Tyson\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 27\n\nTeam: California\n\nPosition: SF/PF\n\nSize: 6-foot-6, 218 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 21, Junior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Caleb Martin\n\nJaylon Tyson figures to get looks from teams starting in the mid-to-late first round after a breakout season averaging 19.6 points and 3.5 assists.\n\nA 30.1 percent usage on a 13-19 California team does cast a cloud over his statistical production. But the eye test clearly shows a scorer with NBA traits and skills, including 6-foot-6 size, ball-handling for creation/playmaking and tough shotmaking.\n\n27. Minnesota Timberwolves: Johnny Furphy\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 28\n\nTeam: Kansas\n\nPosition: SF\n\nSize: 6-foot-8, 189 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 19, Freshman\n\nNationality: Australian\n\nPro Comparison: Cam Johnson\n\nJohnny Furphy’s fairly simplistic and translatable combination of positional size, shooting and play-finishing could be enough for a team in the 20s.\n\nBut his athletic-test results were disappointing at the combine, and a 189-pound frame at his size suggests he’s at least a year from being physically ready for NBA minutes.\n\n28. Denver Nuggets: Kyle Filipowski\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 22\n\nTeam: Duke\n\nPosition: PF/C\n\nSize: 6-foot-11, 230 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 20, Sophomore\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: Moritz Wagner\n\nMeasurements and athletic testing results from the NBA combine won’t do Kyle Filipowski any favors. With shoes on, (6’10.75″ in socks), he’ll wind up with a negative wingspan (6’10.5″). And he finished in the bottom half of the foot speed and leaping tests.\n\nHis draft stock has mostly remained unchanged for the past few months, though pre-draft risers could push him down boards. His shooting range, post skill, improved finishing and passing and defensive mobility create versatility that should lock Filipowski into the first round.\n\nWhile he doesn’t project as a top option like he was at Duke, he checks the right complementary boxes to make a quick transition to a supporting stretch 4 or 5 role.\n\n29. Utah Jazz (via Thunder): Pacome Dadiet\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 29\n\nTeam: Ratiopharm Ulm\n\nPosition: SF/PF\n\nSize: 6-foot-8, 210 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 18\n\nNationality: French\n\nPro comparison: Wilson Chandler\n\nStill playing overseas, Pacome Dadiet has gradually put himself in the first-round discussion with shooting versatility, play-finishing and brief on-ball flashes for a 6-foot-8, 18-year-old wing.\n\nBetween his age, efficient production in the German League and EuroCup and an adaptable, off-ball game, he seems to have a high floor with a path to upside if his creation evolves.\n\n30. Boston Celtics: Tyler Kolek\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 25\n\nTeam: Marquette\n\nPosition: PG\n\nSize: 6-foot-1, 197 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 23, Senior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Jason Preston\n\nUnderwhelming measurements (6-foot-1, 6-foot-3 wingspan) and athletic testing will make teams view Tyler Kolek as a backup. But that could still be enough to draw first-round interest, particularly from playoff teams that will see a guard who can instantly provide pick-and-roll offense, spot-up shooting and toughness.\n\n31. Toronto Raptors (via Pistons): Bobi Klintman\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 31\n\nTeam: Cairns Taipans\n\nPosition: SF/PF\n\nSize: 6-foot-9, 212 lbs\n\nAge: 21\n\nNationality: Swedish\n\nPro Comparison: De’Andre Hunter\n\nBobi Klintman leaves NBA combine week as a classic fringe first-rounder—interesting enough to go in the 20s to a team that loves the big-wing archetype and two-way versatility, but not sharp enough in any one area for teams to confidently project what strengths/skills will translate.\n\nHe looked comfortable shooting in Chicago, and teams that ultimately buy his three-ball carrying over and improving could deem Klintman worth taking in the first round.\n\n32. Utah Jazz (via Wizards): Baylor Scheierman\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 32\n\nSchool/team: Creighton\n\nPosition: SF\n\nSize: 6-foot-6, 202 lbs\n\nAge: 23, Senior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Joe Ingles\n\nScouts left the NBA combine more confident in Baylor Scheierman. He looked like a pro during shooting drills and scrimmages.\n\nAside from his shotmaking, he brought in boards, made plays in ball-screen situations, scored with craft and footwork inside the arc and demonstrated vocal leadership.\n\nHe’ll generate first-round consideration from multiple teams, particularly those more interested in adding a good-bet role player than chasing longer-term upside.\n\n33. Milwaukee Bucks (Blazers): Terrence Shannon Jr.\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 33\n\nTeam: Illinois\n\nPosition: SG/SF\n\nSize: 6-foot-6, 219 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 23, Senior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: Kelly Oubre Jr.\n\nTerrence Shannon Jr. was found not guilty of rape and aggravated sexual battery on Thursday.\n\nBefore that, an injury kept Shannon from drilling or testing at the NBA combine.\n\nHis 2023-24 breakout season showed the speed, athleticism, shotmaking improvement and defensive tools that generate plenty of NBA interest.\n\n34. Portland Trail Blazers (via Hornets): Kevin McCullar Jr.\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 34\n\nSchool/team: Kansas\n\nPosition: SG/SF\n\nSize: 6-foot-5, 206 lbs\n\nAge: 23, Senior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Josh Hart\n\nKevin McCullar Jr. continues to sit with a knee injury that kept him out of the NCAA tournament. He skipped drills, athletic testing and scrimmages at the combine, though it was unlikely scouts would learn anything new about the 23-year-old who attended the same event last year.\n\nThe Jayhawks ultimately looked like a different team without him, which speaks to his impact and wide-ranging contributions getting Kansas into offense, finishing plays, making shots and defending opponents’ top wings.\n\nScouts buy his versatility and defense for a supporting NBA role, though he’ll have to avoid any medical-report concerns.\n\n35. San Antonio Spurs: Cam Christie\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 35\n\nSchool/team: Minnesota\n\nPosition: SG\n\nSize: 6-foot-5, 190 lbs\n\nAge: 18, Freshman\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Allen Crabbe\n\nCam Christie had a quiet NBA combine after choosing to skip scrimmaging.\n\nThere is a lens that some scouts can look through and see upside based on his age, size, shotmaking and passing flashes. But he’s being seen as a project who’ll spend next year in the G League, regardless of where he’s drafted.\n\n36. Indiana Pacers (via Raptors): Harrison Ingram\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 36\n\nSchool/team: North Carolina\n\nPosition: SF/PF\n\nSize: 6-foot-5, 234 lbs\n\nAge: 21, Junior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Naji Marshall\n\nHarrison Ingram showed off his shotmaking in one scrimmage and passing with six assists in the other game. He’s earned fans with his connector skill set and strength and 7’0″ wingspan for rebounding and defensive activity.\n\nScouts don’t see a likely first-round pick, with questions about his burst for blowing by or explosion at the rim. But his two-way versatility and maturity are strong enough draws to earn consideration in the 30s.\n\n37. Minnesota Timberwolves (via Grizzlies): KJ Simpson\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 37\n\nSchool: Colorado\n\nNationality: American\n\nPosition: Guard\n\nSize: 6’0″, 187 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 21, Junior\n\nPro comparison: Cole Anthony\n\nKJ Simpson backed up the big stat lines at Colorado with a handful of blow-by drives, tough finishes and shotmaking during NBA combine scrimmages.\n\nHe also got up for a 40.5-inch max vertical, which could help make up for the fact that he only measured 6’0″ without shoes.\n\nProduction, creation skill, touch, range, energy and confidence could sway a team to look past the underwhelming measurements.\n\n38. New York Knicks (via Jazz): Adem Bona\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 38\n\nSchool/team: UCLA\n\nPosition: C\n\nSize: 6-foot-8, 243 lbs\n\nAge: 21, Sophomore\n\nNationality: Turkish/Nigerian\n\nPro comparison: Daniel Gafford\n\nAdem Bona measured a 7-foot-4 wingspan, tied for the highest standing vertical, and then showcased that length and athleticism on big finishes and blocks during scrimmages.\n\nThe extra scoring this year at UCLA won’t do much for his stock. But he still has the tools, motor, feet and leaping ability to continue making plays around the rim at both ends.\n\n39. Memphis Grizzlies (via Nets): Keshad Johnson\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 39\n\nSchool/Team: Arizona\n\nPosition: SF/PF\n\nAge/Year: 22, Senior\n\nSize: 6-foot-6, 224 lbs\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Robert Covington\n\nKeshad Johnson popped numerous times in Chicago during scrimmages with his shooting, defensive playmaking and foot speed around the perimeter. He also tied for the highest max vertical at 42 inches, and he measured two of the biggest hands at the combine.\n\nInteresting physical tools, athleticism, movement and shotmaking development should earn Johnson plenty of workouts and second-round consideration.\n\n40. Portland Trail Blazers (via Hawks): Dillon Jones\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 40\n\nSchool/Team: Weber State\n\nPosition: SF\n\nAge/Year: 22, Junior\n\nSize: 6-foot-5, 237 lbs\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: David Roddy\n\nBall-dominant at Weber State, Dillon Jones had trouble standing out in a different role at the NBA combine. On the bright side, he improved his athletic-test results across the board since last year, specifically his foot-speed times and vertical jumps.\n\nThe first round feels far-fetched, but he should get looks in the 30s and 40s from teams drawn to his unique versatility as a 237-pound playmaker, excellent rebounder and improved shooter.\n\n41. Philadelphia 76ers (via Bulls): Jonathan Mogbo\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 41\n\nSchool/team: San Francisco\n\nPosition: PF\n\nSize: 6-foot-6, 217 lbs\n\nAge: 22, Junior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Kenneth Faried\n\nJonathan Mogbo helped his stock in Chicago, showing how he can fit without a jumper at just 6-foot-6 in socks. He plays much bigger than his measurements around the basket. But he also showed how well he can handle in the open floor and process quickly as a passer.\n\nThe tools/athleticism for scoring around the basket and playmaking ability create a unique archetype that teams will find enticing in the second round.\n\n42. Charlotte Hornets (via Rockets): Nikola Djurisic\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 42\n\nSchool/team: Mega MIS\n\nPosition: SF\n\nSize: 6-foot-7, 209 lbs\n\nAge: 20\n\nNationality: Belgian/Serbian\n\nPro comparison: Deni Avdija\n\nAfter playing well at the NBA combine, Nikola Djurisic won MVP at Eurocamp. It looked easy for him against younger competition, though he had some difficulty getting good looks in the championship game against a more competitive roster.\n\nHe still has until June 16 to withdraw from the draft, but his positional size, shotmaking and passing should result in plenty of second-round interest if he stays.\n\n43. Miami Heat: Pelle Larsson\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 43\n\nSchool/Team: Arizona\n\nPosition: SF\n\nSize: 6-foot-5, 212 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 23, Senior\n\nNationality: Swedish\n\nPro comparison: Christian Braun\n\nPelle Larsson’s impressive frame and versatility stood out more than his scoring in Chicago. His game feels very adaptable to the next level, even if he’s missing one specialty skill.\n\nTeams should see a high-floor second-round pick who can make plays out of pick-and-rolls, threaten as a catch-and-shooter and generally make the right plays within an offense.\n\n44. Houston Rockets (via Warriors): Melvin Ajinça\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 44\n\nTeam/nationality: Saint-Quentin\n\nPosition: SG/SF\n\nSize: 6-foot-7\n\nAge: 19\n\nNationality: French\n\nPro comparison: Evan Fournier\n\nMelvin Ajinça met with teams in Treviso after missing the NBA combine for the LNB Pro A playoffs.\n\nHis shotmaking has been a draw since FIBA over the summer. Teams will be trying to decide if he’s a sharp enough shooter to compensate for his lack of creation and quickness.\n\n45. Sacramento Kings: PJ Hall\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 45\n\nTeam: Clemson\n\nPosition: PF/C\n\nSize: 6-foot-8, 240 lbs\n\nAge: 22, Senior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Jeremiah Robinson-Earl\n\nPJ Hall didn’t scrimmage in Chicago after participating last year. There is ultimately enough game film of the senior playing against NBA-caliber bigs from the ACC.\n\nHall will still have to sell teams on his shooting during workouts, but he’s consistently improved his range. And between his physical profile and fundamentals around the post, his post scoring feels translatable.\n\n46. LA Clippers (via Pacers): Justin Edwards\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 46\n\nSchool/Team: Kentucky\n\nPosition: SF\n\nSize: 6-foot-6, 209 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 20, Freshman\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: James Young\n\nJustin Edwards hit mid-range jumpers and a step-back three in the combine’s opening scrimmage before missing his outside shots and struggling in the second scrimmage.\n\nHe isn’t advanced enough in any one offensive area for teams to confidently draft him with a first-round pick. He’ll remain in the second-round conversation for teams willing to bet on shotmaking improvement to complement his athleticism and defensive tools.\n\n47. Orlando Magic: Jamal Shead\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 47\n\nSchool/team: Houston\n\nPosition: PG\n\nSize: 6’0″, 201 lbs\n\nAge: 21, Senior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Jevon Carter\n\nJamal Shead combined for 27 points and 10 assists in the two combine scrimmages, delivering the signature rim pressure, defensive toughness and playmaking we saw at Houston.\n\nQuestions about his height and shooting may limit his first-round interest, but there are sure to be teams that see second-round value based on the likelihood that his physical driving, passing instincts and relentless ball pressure translate.\n\n48. San Antonio Spurs (via Lakers): AJ Johnson\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 48\n\nSchool/team: Illawara Hawks\n\nPosition: PG/SG\n\nSize: 6-foot-4, 167 lbs\n\nAge: 19\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Jamal Crawford\n\nAJ Johnson’s ball-handling and shiftiness, passing reads, athleticism at the rim and shooting range popped at the NBA combine. His on-ball creation, scoring and playmaking flashes looked enticing for a 6-foot-4 (in socks) 19-year-old with a 6-foot-8 wingspan.\n\nHe’ll spend next season in the G League at just 167 pounds and coming off limited minutes in Australia.\n\n49. Indiana Pacers (via Cavaliers): Ajay Mitchell\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 49\n\nSchool/team: UC Santa Barbara\n\nPosition: PG\n\nSize: 6-foot-3, 187 lbs\n\nAge: 21, Junior\n\nNationality: Belgian\n\nPro comparison: Andrew Nembhard\n\nThe most impressive plays at the combine from Ajay Mitchell highlighted his playmaking, which was good to see considering he’s more known for scoring.\n\nScouts still have too many questions about his shooting and quickness/burst to give a first-round grade. But he should be on plenty of second-round boards for teams that could use another ball-handler and extra creation.\n\n50. Indiana Pacers (via Pelicans): Jaylen Wells\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 50\n\nSchool/team: Washington State\n\nPosition: SF\n\nSize: 6-foot-7, 206 lbs\n\nAge: 20, Junior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Duncan Robinson\n\nFrom Division II to Washington State and the NBA combine, Jaylen Wells has become a second-round name for teams to consider.\n\nScouts have started to picture a shotmaking specialist with his wing size and outstanding spot-up and pull-up shooting accuracy.\n\n51. Washington Wizards (via Suns): Juan Nunez\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 51\n\nSchool/team: Ratiopharm Ulm\n\nPosition: PG\n\nSize: 6-foot-3, 180 lbs\n\nAge: 20\n\nNationality: Spain\n\nPro comparison: Facundo Campazzo\n\nNBA teams will have Juan Nunez on their radar for his crafty playmaking and elite passing skills. His modest improvement as a shooter has been promising, but he’ll draw looks for his ability to set up teammates and make plays with his dribble.\n\n52. Golden State Warriors (via Bucks): Enrique Freeman\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 52\n\nSchool/team: Akron\n\nPosition: PF\n\nSize: 6-foot-7, 212 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 23, Senior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Joel Bolomboy\n\nThe biggest riser of the predraft process so far, Enrique Freeman turned his Portsmouth Invitational play into a G League Elite Camp invite, where he earned a call-up to the NBA combine.\n\nHe wound up being one of the most productive players during scrimmages against projected second-round picks, impressing with his shooting range, post skill, finishing activity and rebounding.\n\nScouts believe he got himself drafted in Chicago. A second-round team will be willing to bet on his versatility, production at Akron and the story of a former walk-on.\n\n53. Detroit Pistons (via Knicks): Antonio Reeves\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 53\n\nSchool/Team: Kentucky\n\nPosition: SG\n\nSize: 6-foot-5, 187 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 23, Senior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Alec Burks\n\nAntonio Reeves looked like the same scoring weapon during scrimmages that he was at Kentucky. He’s clearly one of the class’ top shotmakers who also has a good feel for how to get himself those catch-and-shoot, pull-up and floater chances within an offense’s flow.\n\nAge and athletic limitations won’t feel alarming enough for teams to keep passing on him late in the second round.\n\n54. Boston Celtics (via Mavericks): Tristen Newton\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 54\n\nSchool/team: Connecticut\n\nPosition: PG\n\nSize: 6-foot-3, 192 lbs\n\nAge: 23, Senior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Terance Mann\n\nTristen Newton surprised scouts when he opted to skip scrimmaging. Teams should ultimately have a confident feel for the 23-year-old’s game, which played a key role during Connecticut’s repeat championships.\n\nNewton should draw second-round interest and two-way offers from teams who see a Swiss Army knife guard who can make plays for teammates, knock down shots and adapt to different roles and situations.\n\n55. Los Angeles Lakers (via Clippers): Bronny James\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 55\n\nSchool/team: USC\n\nPosition: SG\n\nSize: 6-foot-2, 210 lbs\n\nAge: 19, Freshman\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Miles McBride\n\nRival teams sound uncertain about Bronny James’ chances of getting drafted, though the Los Angeles Lakers remain the popular guess as to his most likely destination.\n\nIf he’s still on the board deep into the second round, L.A.’s front office could feel pressure to select him, considering it’s essentially a risk-free pick that late, and passing at No. 55 would signal to LeBron how little the team thinks of Bronny.\n\nHowever, he impressed with his shooting at the NBA combine, while James’ defensive quickness popped at USC. Though he’d likely spend next year earning G League reps and the South Bay Lakers’ extra attention, his shotmaking, foot speed and IQ do create a viable three-and-D archetype and path to NBA success in the long term.\n\nHis draft stock and debated potential have ultimately become some of the most unique and tricky storylines of the modern NBA draft era.\n\n56. Denver Nuggets (via Timberwolves): Oso Ighodaro\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 56\n\nTeam: Marquette\n\nPosition: PF/C\n\nSize: 6-foot-10, 222 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 21, Senior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: Brandon Clarke\n\nOn a positive note, Oso Ighodaro tied for the highest standing vertical at the combine (35″) and was able to showcase the handle and passing that separates him from bigs. But he also measured just a 6-foot-11 wingspan, easily the shortest among projected centers.\n\nNo shooting range and questionable tools for rim protection could raise some red flags, but teams could see a place for his playmaking, signature touch shots and play-finishing from his position.\n\n57. Memphis Grizzlies (via Thunder): Isaac Jones\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 57\n\nSchool/team: Washington State\n\nPosition: PF\n\nSize: 6-foot-8, 235 lbs\n\nAge: 23, Senior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Precious Achiuwa\n\nThe clear standout at the Portsmouth Invitational, Isaac Jones moved his way up to G League Elite Camp and the NBA combine.\n\nHis pitch to teams is built around his ability to guard bigs and wings and make plays with his athleticism and motor. But he also flashed enough post skill and shooting potential to possibly provide some complementary offense.\n\n58. Dallas Mavericks (via Celtics): Boogie Ellis\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 58\n\nSchool/team: USC\n\nPosition: SG\n\nSize: 6-foot-1, 185 lbs\n\nAge: 23, Senior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Isaiah Joe\n\nAfter making 313 career threes, Boogie Ellis shot well at the combine, and late second-round teams will make two-way contract offers for a proven shooter who can also handle the ball.\n\nJonathan Wasserman is the lead scout and NBA Draft analyst for Bleacher Report.
