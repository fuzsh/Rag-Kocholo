        "text": "Rising star Ja Morant scored 22 points on 9-of-15 shooting (60.0%) and 4-of-6 from 3-point range (66.7%) as the Memphis Grizzlies cruised to a 136-102 home victory (box score) over visiting Houston on Monday night. Morant added 6 rebounds and 6 assists in only 25 minutes as the Grizzlies (7-7) easily snapped their three-game losing streak and sent the rebuilding Rockets (1-13) to a 12th consecutive defeat.\n\nVeteran guard Eric Gordon (right groin tightness) did not play, since it was the second night of a back-to-back for Houston. With Gordon out, veteran guard DJ Augustin returned to the rotation for the Rockets.\n\nRookie guard Jalen Green scored a team-high 15 points on 6-of-13 shooting (46.2%) to lead a weary and reeling Houston squad.\n\nSee below for highlights, statistics, and player analysis from Monday’s game, with grades limited to players who played clear rotation minutes. Houston will continue its four-game road trip with Wednesday’s visit to Oklahoma City (5-7), where tipoff is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. Central.\n\nRelated\n\nMemphis star Ja Morant offers advice to Rockets rookie Jalen Green\n\nDamian Lillard sees 'talent through the roof' in Houston's Kevin Porter Jr.\n\nAll-A Honor Roll\n\nWhen you lose by 34 points to a team that entered the game below .500, and your team is on a 12-game losing streak, there are no A’s.\n\nGood but Not Great (B's)\n\nPhoto by Petre Thomas-USA TODAY Sports\n\nJalen Green (B): 15 points, 6-of-13 shooting (46.2%), 2-of-6 on 3-pointers (33.3%), 2 rebounds; plus/minus of -37 in 28 minutes\n\nJae’Sean Tate (B+): 14 points, 6-of-11 shooting (54.5%), 9 rebounds, plus/minus of -24 in 25 minutes\n\nKJ Martin (B): 9 points, 3-of-8 shooting (37.5%), 5 rebounds, 2 assists, plus/minus of -2 in 17 minutes\n\nGarrison Mathews (B): 7 points, 2-of-4 shooting (50.0%), 1-of-3 on 3-pointers (33.3%), 1 assist, plus/minus of +6 in 15 minutes\n\nGreen had an awful plus/minus figure, but his shooting percentages were solid, for a change. For Martin to play over 17 minutes and only have a -2 plus/minus, in a game that Houston lost by 34 points, speaks to why the second-year forward should be receiving more playing time.\n\nNeeds Improvement (C's or worse)\n\nPhoto by Petre Thomas-USA TODAY Sports\n\nChristian Wood (C): 11 points, 4-of-9 shooting (44.4%), 1-of-4 on 3-pointers (25.0%), 4 assists, 3 rebounds; plus/minus of -28 in 26 minutes\n\nDaniel Theis (C-): 10 points, 3-of-5 shooting (60.0%), 2-of-4 on 3-pointers (50.0%), 5 rebounds, 5 turnovers; plus/minus of -14 in 21 minutes\n\nKevin Porter Jr. (D): 7 points, 2-of-11 shooting (18.2%), 2-of-5 on 3-pointers (40.0%), 3 assists, 2 blocks, 2 steals, 2 rebounds, 2 turnovers; plus/minus of -20 in 21 minutes\n\nAlperen Sengun (C): 9 points, 3-of-8 shooting (33.3%), 0-of-2 on 3-pointers, 5 rebounds; plus/minus of -22 in 18 minutes\n\nDJ Augustin (D): 1 point, 0-of-4 shooting, 0-of-3 on 3-pointers, 5 assists, plus/minus of -13 in 19 minutes\n\nDanuel House Jr. (D): 2 points, 1-of-5 shooting (20.0%), 0-of-3 on 3-pointers, 4 rebounds; plus/minus of -8 in 13 minutes\n\nPorter finished poorly in yet another game, while Theis turned the ball over 5 times in only 21 minutes. Augustin and House combined to shoot just 1-of-9 (11.1%) off the bench, which makes it hard for a young and struggling team to justify playing them ahead of younger players such as Josh Christopher, Armoni Brooks, and Usman Garuba.\n\nHead coach Stephen Silas had hinted at a lineup change after Sunday’s loss before temporarily backing off prior to Monday’s tipoff, and replacing Theis with Sengun would seem to be the most plausible change. Unfortunately, they might also need a temporary replacement for Porter, who left Monday’s game early after re-aggravating a left thigh bruise.\n\n[vertical-gallery id=56097]\n\n1\n\n1"
