The Rockets have lost three of their last four to drop their record to 19-19. They won just 22 games all last season.\n\nTatum was tossed for the second time in six weeks, picking up his first technical for complaining about a non-call with 10:17 left in the fourth quarter and Boston leading 117-90. He continued to complain while Aaron Holiday took the foul shot and picked up a second T, then walked over to referee CJ Washington and leaned in to shout something before walking off the court.\n\nTHUNDER 112, MAGIC 100\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 37 points and Oklahoma City beat short-handed Orlando to tie Minnesota for the Western Conference lead.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander had his high points total without making a 3-pointer. He missed all four of his 3-point tries, but was 13 of 16 inside the arc and made 11 of 12 free throws.\n\nJalen Williams scored 16 points and Chet Holmgren added 15 to help the Thunder improve to 27-11. Paolo Banchero had 20 points, nine rebounds and eight assists for the Magic. They have lost three straight.\n\nJAZZ 133, LAKERS 123\n\nSALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Lauri Markkanen had 29 points, nine rebounds and five assists to lead Utah past Los Angeles for its fifth straight victory and eighth in a row at home.\n\nCollin Sexton scored 27 points and Jordan Clarkson added 21.\n\nWith LeBron James out with a left ankle injury, D’Angelo Russell led the Lakers with 39 points and eight assists. Anthony Davis had a triple-double with 15 points, 15 rebounds and 10 assists, but shot 5 of 21 from the field.\n\nBUCKS 129, WARRIORS 118\n\nMILWAUKEE (AP) — Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 33 points and Milwaukee Used a big fourth quarter to pull away against short-handed Golden State.\n\nThe Warriors rested Stephen Curry in the second night of a road back-to-back and are still without Draymond Green. Coach Steve Kerr said he could return from his suspension Monday in Memphis or Wednesday at Utah.\n\nDamian Lillard added 27 points for the Bucks. Jonathan Kuminga led the Warriors with 28.\n\nKNICKS 106, GRIZZLIES 94\n\nMEMPHIS, Tenn.

They have won six of seven.\n\nGG Jackson led the Grizzlies with 20 points and six rebounds. Over the last week, leading scorer Ja Morant had season-ending shoulder surgery, and Marcus Smart’s injury to his right ring finger will keep him out at least six weeks. Then, Friday night in a loss to the Clippers, Desmond Bane, the team’s second-leading scorer, sprained an ankle and was on crutches Saturday.\n\nWIZARDS 127, HAWS 99\n\nATLANTA (AP) — Kyle Kuzma scored 29 points and Washington took advantage of Atlanta’s worst offensive night this season to rout the Hawks.\n\nJordan Poole added 20 points to help the Wizards snap a six-game losing streak and improve to 4-18 on the road.

Trae Young had 21 points on 6-of-19 shooting.\n\nBULLS 122, SPURS 116\n\nSAN ANTONIO (AP) — Nikola Vucevic had 24 points and 16 rebounds and Chicago overcame a career-high 30 points from Tre Jones to past San Antonio with Spurs rookie star Victor Wembanyama sitting out.\n\nWembanyama did not play the second game of a back-to-back. The Spurs continue to proceed cautiously with the No. 1 pick following a sprained ankle last month.\n\nKeldon Johnson had 26 points for San Antonio.\n\nPELICANS 118, MAVERICKS 108\n\nDALLAS (AP) — Rookie Jordan Hawkins scored a season-high 34 points and New Orleans beat Dallas in a game in which most of both teams’ regular starters weren’t in uniform.\n\nHerb Jones scored 15 points and Jonas Valanciunas had 14 points and a 12 rebounds for the Pelicans, who split a back-to-back after losing at Denver 125-113 on Friday night.
