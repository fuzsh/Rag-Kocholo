When you just happen to be dubbed the King of Cool, it’s no easy feat to find your match in style, swagger, and genius. Certainly jazz maestro Miles Davis found himself at the altar three times over his wild and creative lifetime. While Don Cheadle’s soon-to-be-released film Miles Ahead focuses on the period of Davis’s relationship with first wife Frances Taylor, it’s the musician’s partnership with Academy Award–nominated actress Cicely Tyson that stands out in our minds as the definition of well suited. Predating the partnership of Beyoncé and Jay Z, Tyson and Davis dominated the entertainment world with a shared dynamism and glamour during their seven-year marriage.

Theirs was a tumultuous romance, to be sure—Davis’s autobiography is frank about the cataclysmic energy between the two and Tyson has remained notoriously tightlipped on the subject over the years. But they still made for a stunning pair, swanning into parties together in risk-taking looks that were as perfectly unpredictable as Davis’s music. Tyson would slip into pouffy rainbow-sequined gowns, while Davis wore a flashy three-piece suit—sans shirt. Outré his-and-her sunglasses and overcoats were standard for these two, and even streamlined looks of floor-length gowns and tailored tuxes appeared unconventional in their hands. They were each other’s muses, in style and in art, with Tyson’s stunning profile covering Davis’s infamous album, Sorcerer.
