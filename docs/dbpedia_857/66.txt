The Sydney Children’s Hospital, Randwick, is one of Australia’s leading specialist medical centres for children, caring for seriously ill and injured children from across NSW and beyond.

For detailed information about visiting hospital or what to expect when you have a family member or friend stay in hospital, see our visitor guidelines.

Opening hours

Be aware that hospital visiting hours may vary from ward to ward. Note that most wards have a 'quiet time' in the afternoons between 12:30pm and 2pm, when children and infants sleep. Please respect other patients and families during this time.
