        "text": "Preparing yourself for your child’s hospital stay\n\nIt is easy to only focus on your child as you get ready for a hospital stay. But it is important to prepare yourself as well.\n\nCheck practical things like which ward they will be staying in and what facilities are on offer. Find out how much time off you can get from work.\n\nThink about what you want to pack – for both you and your child.\n\nUnderstanding your child’s stay\n\nThe more you understand about your child’s hospital stay the easier it is to plan. Some of the things you need to know are:\n\nWhat treatment they are having\n\nWhat ward they will be on\n\nWhat facilities there are\n\nWhether you will be able to stay with them\n\nWhen other family members can visit\n\nIt is okay to ask if you have any questions. Even if you have been told the answers before, it is easy to forget when you are tired or stressed.\n\nWhat treatment is your child going to the hospital for?\n\nEach child with cancer will have a different treatment plan depending on the type of cancer and other factors like test results and their age. This could include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or targeted cancer drugs. You can find out more about types of cancer and how they are treated here.\n\nTalk to your child’s care team before their hospital stay so you know what to expect. This will help you get your child ready as well.\n\nWhich ward will they be staying in?\n\nYour child will probably be on a children’s cancer ward. Most children’s wards are friendly places. There will usually be activities for your child and people to support you as a family. Most children’s wards have a TV and video games available. These can be a useful way for you and your child to build relationships with other families.\n\nCan I stay with my child in the hospital?\n\nOne parent or carer can usually stay with your child while they are in hospital. There might be a bed so you can sleep next to them.\n\nOnly your child gets hospital meals, but there will usually be a kitchen where you can make a cup of tea and possibly prepare snacks. There are usually showers available for parents and a place to wash your clothes.\n\nMost hospitals provide information about their wards, facilities and the local area.\n\nUnderstand your feelings\n\nIt is natural to have lots of feelings about your child going into hospital. You might be worried about them but also stressed about missing work or leaving your other children at home.\n\nIt can help to write down what is on your mind. There might be practical things you can do to reduce your stress levels. But sometimes just saying it out loud can help.\n\nDo not be afraid to ask for help if you need it.\n\nAsking for help\n\nIf you have any worries or questions about your child’s hospital stay, talk to a member of your child’s care team. It may be helpful to write down questions as you think of them.\n\nYou can also ask for practical help from friends and family. This could be things like making meals for the freezer or taking your other children to and from school.\n\nTalking to your employer\n\nYou should talk to your employer about time off or flexible working as soon as you can. Make sure you know your rights. Everyone has the right to take a reasonable amount of unpaid time off work to look after their children in an emergency. What is classed as an ‘emergency’ and how much time you need will depend on the situation.\n\nHow to prepare your child for a hospital stay\n\nIt’s important to help your child prepare for a hospital stay. How and when it is ‘right’ to do this will depend on the child. Try to use words they understand and let them know you are there for them. You can also take practical steps like packing things which will make them feel more comfortable.\n\nWhen to tell your child about the hospital stay\n\nDeciding when to tell your child about their hospital stay will depend on their age and personality. Some children like to know things in advance and count down to the hospital stay on the calendar. Others may get worried so you might decide not to tell them too far ahead. About a week before for toddlers and primary school-age children is a good starting point.\n\nShould you be honest about the stay?\n\nYou know your child best and are the best judge of how much or how little they need to know. But it is best to be honest. If you are too vague, your child might think you are trying to hide things from them.\n\nIt is also important not to make things sound less serious than they are. This does not mean you have to tell them everything at once. Think about how you can give the information in a clear and comforting way.\n\nPacking your child’s bag\n\nThink about what you can take with you to help your child feel more comfortable during their hospital stay. You might want to pack things like:\n\nEntertainment – this could be toys, games, activity books, a portable DVD player or pre-downloaded apps on a smartphone or tablet\n\nYour child’s favourite snacks and drinks\n\nSomething snuggly for your child to wear like pyjamas, slippers or dressing gowns\n\nAnything your child will find comforting to have with them like a cuddly toy or photographs.\n\nTips for preparing children at different ages\n\nWhat you need to do to get your child ready for a hospital stay will vary depending on how old they are. Below are some tips for what you might want to do.\n\nPreparing infants\n\nAlthough you will not be able to explain things to a young infant, you can still do some practical things to help them prepare for hospital. You can pack their favourite toy and blanket. Make sure you have plenty of bottles and milk or snack foods.\n\nBeing separated from their parents can make things hard for babies in hospital. One parent is normally encouraged to stay. The key is trying to keep things as ‘normal’ as possible. You should be able to feed, change and wash the baby whenever their treatment allows.\n\nPreparing toddlers\n\nIt is a good idea to start preparing toddlers up to a week ahead of their hospital stay. If they are keen to know when it is happening, you could count down the number of days. You can get them to hospital role-play at home. This might lead to questions. Use words your child will understand to explain what is going to happen and reassure them you will be with them.\n\nPreparing children at primary school\n\nPrimary school-age children can find the thought of a hospital stay scary. They may be worried about missing school and not seeing their friends. It is a good idea to tell them about a week before but some children will need more time to prepare.\n\nTell them how long they are likely to be in hospital and explain why they are going there. You can tell them what will happen and explain how it might help them in the long run.\n\nPreparing teenagers\n\nIt can be difficult to talk to teenagers about staying in hospital. They might find it hard to express their feelings or be uncomfortable speaking about their body or illness.\n\nMake sure they know they can ask you about it. Give them practical information like how long they are likely to be in hospital.\n\nSome teenagers like to have their own diary of hospital appointments and stays. They might also want to be the ones to ask questions before and during their stay. This can help them feel more in control of what is happening.\n\nWhat questions might my child ask?\n\nThere are lots of questions your child might have about their hospital stay. They might want to know practical things like how long they will have to stay. Or they might want to know if they will be able to see their friends. Some children worry they have done something wrong.\n\nDo not feel bad if you do not know the answer to all their questions. You can always check with the care team. Depending on how old the child is, you might want to find the answers together.\n\nSome children might not ask any questions about their hospital stay. But that does not always mean they do not want to know more. Keep checking if your child has any questions.\n\nHow long is the average hospital stay?\n\nHow long your child is in hospital will depend on the type of cancer they have and their treatment plan.\n\nSome children have most of their treatment on day-care wards. This means they can come home at night.\n\nSome children will have to stay in hospital for longer. Your care team should be able to give you an idea of how long to expect. This can help you and your child prepare.\n\nHow to respond if your child acts negatively\n\nYour child might be upset or scared about going into the hospital. Talk to them about how they are feeling. They might find it helpful to write it down or draw a picture. Most children’s wards have play specialists who can help. They use play to help children understand what is happening and cope with their treatment.\n\nYou can both talk to your Young Lives Versus Cancer social worker.\n\nWhere possible, try to keep things as normal as possible – that includes the usual boundaries you set for their behaviour.\n\nWhat should I bring with me?\n\nSome items parents like to keep packed for a hospital stay include:\n\nToiletries – lip balm, hand cream and moisturisers can be particularly handy\n\nYour phone or tablet charger\n\nBooks and magazines to keep you occupied\n\nClothes for you and your child\n\nA diary or organiser and a pen to take notes\n\nWashing powder or liquid\n\nTips for coping with ward life\n\nAim to get off the ward for a short break each day, even if it’s just for a quick coffee or a walk around the block. Ward staff will support you with this. When you leave the ward, let a member of staff know how long you’ll be gone and how to contact you if necessary.\n\nTry taking an active role in your child’s care by helping them with meals, wheeling their drip, taking them to the toilet and so on.\n\nFeel free to draw the curtain round and spend some quiet time with your child when you need to. Sometimes you might be asked to keep the curtain open if staff want to closely observe your child. Just ask if you are not sure.\n\nInformation reviewed May 2023\n\nNext review due 2027"
