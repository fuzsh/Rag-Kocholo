        "text": "Dr. DeCuypere received his medical degree and doctorate from The University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis, Tennessee. He completed his residency at The University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Department of Neurosurgery and The Semmes-Murphy Neurologic and Spine Institute, followed by a fellowship at the Centre for Minimally Invasive Neurosurgery in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. In addition to fellowship training in Pediatric Neurosurgery at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Dr. DeCuypere is an author of more than 20 publications and several book chapters.\n\nLurie Children’s stellar reputation and focus on dynamic innovation drew Dr. DeCuypere to Chicago. His drive is to develop the footprint of the Division of Pediatric Neurosurgery in greater roles in research and clinical trial development, solidifying Lurie Children’s position as a national hub for pediatric brain research and treatment in collaboration with the renowned multidisciplinary pediatric brain tumor program with the Division of Neuro-oncology at Lurie Children's Center for Cancer & Blood Disorders."
