        "text": "Most doctors enter paediatric training at Specialty Training 1, or ST1, starting their posts in August or September. This is known as 'National Round 1'. Applications for 2024 are now closed.\n\nST3 posts may be available at two points in the national specialty recruitment calendar. Applications for these posts starting in Feb/Mar 2025 are open until 16:00, Tuesday 13 August.\n\nAll paediatricians play a part in research that benefits infants, children and young people. Academic posts enable some trainees to focus on research - and our toolkit and regular events give support.\n\nThe MTI(p) scheme provides paediatricians from outside the UK / European Economic Area two years of high quality postgraduate training in the NHS. Graduates can use this experience to improve patient care in their home countries, and UK hospitals benefit from their skills and knowledge.\n\nThe IPSS facilitates GMC registration for eligible medical graduates from outside the UK / outside the priority nations list for MTI(p). Applicants need to enter UK posts with a sufficient training/educational component and organise the right to live and work in the UK.\n\nThere are several options for international doctors who wish to come to the UK to work in paediatrics, whether on a short-term or long-term basis. We provide information, including finding work in the NHS, visas and GMC registration."
