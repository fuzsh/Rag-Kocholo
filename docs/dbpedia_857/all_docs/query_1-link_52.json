        "text": "Recovering from brain surgery can take some time, both in hospital and at home. Neurosurgery is a big operation. Many children stay in an intensive or high dependency unit for the first few days. After that they are usually looked after on the children’s ward.\n\nIt’s difficult to say how long your child will spend on the ward. Some children are only in for several days but some stay for longer. This is usually children who need intensive rehabilitation after surgery.\n\nChildren’s wards can be busy and noisy places. But they tend to be more relaxed and child friendly places than adult wards and intensive care units. The nurses won’t need to do quite so many checks once they are on the children’s ward. And you should be able to be more involved in their care.\n\nIn most children’s wards one parent or carer can stay overnight with their child. Your child’s nursing team, or clinical nurse specialist, will let you know what to expect.\n\nImmediate side effects\n\nCommon immediate side effects of surgery are infection and blood collection around the operation site (haematoma). Brain surgery can also cause swelling in the brain. Your child’s surgical team watch this closely and give treatment to reduce the swelling. But it might still cause symptoms such as:\n\nweakness\n\ndizzy spells\n\npoor balance or lack of coordination\n\npersonality or behaviour changes\n\nconfusion\n\nspeech problems\n\nseizures (fits)\n\nYour child’s symptoms might be worse than before the operation at first. And you might notice symptoms that they didn’t have before.\n\nThis can be a difficult time for you and your family. You might worry that the operation has not worked. But symptoms usually lessen and they will recover.\n\nYour child’s surgeon can give you some idea of what to expect about recovery.\n\nPosterior fossa syndrome\n\nSome children have certain symptoms who have had brain surgery in an area in the back of the brain. This area of the brain is called the posterior fossa. Symptoms associated with this is called posterior fossa syndrome. They can be very mild or severe. Symptoms can include:\n\ndifficulty talking, as they might not speak, or their speech might be slurred or slow – this is the most common symptom\n\ndifficulty swallowing\n\ntrouble with their muscle tone and being able to move. Symptoms might include your child finding it difficult to walk, or unable to sit up\n\nunable to control their movements. So they may make sudden movements that look like they’re twitching or jerking. Or you might notice their eyes moving from side to side\n\npoor balance\n\nweakness on one side of the body\n\nchanges in their mood and behaviour which doesn’t fit the situation or is out of character for them\n\nPosterior fossa syndrome can develop from one day to a week after surgery. The symptoms usually improve slowly over a few weeks or months. But they may not go away completely in some children. Research is trying to find out what causes posterior fossa syndrome.\n\nYour child’s wound\n\nYour child’s nurse will arrange for their stitches or surgical clips to get taken out if they haven’t been removed before going home. This usually happens 7 to 10 days after surgery. This might mean your child will either:\n\nbe seen by a community children’s nurse at home\n\ngo back to the day unit or ward at the hospital they had their surgery in\n\ngo to the local children’s hospital\n\nYou’ll also notice that their hair gradually grows back around the wound. This usually starts within a couple of weeks. But this will depend on whether your child is having chemotherapy or not.\n\nTiredness, play and physical activities\n\nYour child might feel very tired after their surgery. This is normal. They might need to rest more often. Or nap if they have done something that involves a lot of effort for them. At first, this might be having a wash, or doing exercises with the physiotherapist.\n\nWhile your child is on the ward, the medical team still needs to check that they’re recovering from the surgery as expected. So they will still have neurological tests regularly. This means they might need to wake your child to do this. This can make them feel more tired.\n\nThis tiredness could last for a couple of months, but gradually gets better the further they are away from surgery. If they have other treatment, such as chemotherapy after surgery, their tiredness is likely to worsen again. This is due to the effects of the chemotherapy on the body.\n\nChildren are very good at getting on with things, so you might find them playing with their toys sooner than you think. The play specialist will be around while they’re on the ward. They’ll get involved in helping them play and do things they would normally do.\n\nYour child’s surgeon will talk about when they can get back to doing physical activities, such as swimming or PE at school.\n\nGoing back to school\n\nEvery child recovers differently from this type of surgery. It also depends on whether they will need another treatment after surgery, and when this will start.\n\nSchools are very understanding and will do everything in their power to help your child settle back in. It may mean they start by going in for a few hours. And then as they recover, they can gradually build up how long they are in for.\n\nIt’s best to talk to your child’s clinical nurse specialist (CNS) about plans for school and education while having cancer treatment. The CNS can also communicate with or even visit the school to help support the staff in caring for your child.\n\nLong term problems after surgery\n\nSome children recover well after brain surgery. And they only need a small amount of extra help with their everyday life or at school. Other children have more problems. Or longer term difficulties.\n\nThese problems depend on the area of the brain that the tumour was, or still is. They might include:\n\ndifficulty walking or moving around\n\nlearning problems\n\nproblems at school\n\nbehavioural issues\n\nproblems with speech\n\nhormone problems\n\nThere is support and help available for children who have long term problems after treatment for a brain tumour.\n\nOther treatment\n\nIt’s common for children to have more treatment after brain surgery. This might be chemotherapy, radiotherapy or both. Your child’s team will let you know what to expect."
