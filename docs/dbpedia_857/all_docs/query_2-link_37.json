        "text": "Additional children’s services\n\nBeing in hospital can be a difficult time for children. At Evelina London there’s always something going on. From free TV, radio and WiFi services to special visitors in the form of our friendly therapy dogs, there’s something for everyone during your stay.\n\nEvelina Hospital School\n\nEvelina Hospital School, designated as an ‘Outstanding Provider’ by Ofsted, provides education for our young patients children. Our aim is to provide exceptional personalised education so that all pupils can achieve positive outcomes and feel valued, nurtured and empowered during their time with us.\n\nWe understand the challenges that children, young people and their families can come under when they are in hospital, and we believe that continued education is a central part of the recovery process. Pupils are given stimulating and challenging tasks and activities that build skills they can use at their home schools and beyond. We work flexibly to respond to our pupils’ differing needs and abilities as their health and wellbeing changes.\n\nPlay areas\n\nThere is a fun play area on the ground floor of the hospital with a big slide and lots of toys and games. Children may play here if they are waiting to see a doctor or nurse.\n\nThere are also play areas on the wards with books, games and computers to play on. Your nurse can show you where the nearest one is to your bed.\n\nParents’ room\n\nWe have a parents’ area that has TV in which you can relax. It has its own tea and coffee making facilities, microwave and a fridge in which you can store your own food.\n\nPlaces to eat and shop\n\nEvelina London is on the same location as St Thomas’ Hospital where we have a range of options for food and drinks. These include M&S Cafe and M&S Simply Food, Costa Coffee, Toms Riverside Cafe and Toms Shepherd Hall Restaurant. There is also a WHSmith and Stock Shop for daily essentials and women’s clothing."
