        "text": "Simply put, a paediatrician (spelt pediatrician in North America) is a medical doctor who treats infants, children and young people.\n\nAlthough there have been writings about health and illness in children since Ancient Greece the medical specialty of Paediatrics did not develop until the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nIn Australia, paediatricians are specialist physicians trained in a parallel system to their colleagues who treat adults.\n\nChildren and young people need a referral from a general practitioner (GP) to see the paediatrician. (In some other countries in the world, patients can see a paediatrician without a referral).\n\nGeneral paediatricians in Australia see a broad range of presentations.\n\nPaediatricians can also subspecialise and see children and young people with specific health problems in the same areas as physicians who treat adults (such as paediatric neurology, paediatric cardiology and paediatric gastroenterology), as well as in areas that are strictly paediatric such as neonatology (perinatology), developmental and behavioural paediatrics and adolescent medicine.\n\nPaediatricians can play a role in preventative medicine, population health, health management and many other areas. They are researchers and teachers.\n\nPaediatricians in Australia have to first complete a medical degree, then choose to specialist in paediatrics.\n\nPaediatricians are doctors who enjoy working with children and families and are committed to lifelong learning.\n\nThere are many places where you can complete a medical degree. The University of Sydney offers a postgraduate Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree to suitable candidates.\n\nAs a MD student at the University of Sydney, you can take advantage of opportunities during the course to familiarise yourself with the scope and detail of the work of paediatricians.\n\nIn addition to team-based learning cases, self-directed learning project and patient-doctor tutorials, you will complete a seven-week child and adolescent health specialty block.\n\nWhile you are a medical student you can gain experience and exposure to paediatrics by undertaking the following activities in paediatrics or related areas:\n\nSummer scholarships\n\nMD research project\n\nelective term\n\npre-internship term\n\nattachments and placements that allow more exposure to children (eg clinical placements in psychological and addiction medicine)\n\nOutside your studies you can gain further experience and exposure to paediatrics by undertaking:\n\nrelevant volunteer and part-time work\n\nrelevant research work\n\nIf you are in contact with paediatricians, consider talking with them about your progress and career.\n\nEven if you spend only a week with someone as a supervisor, it may be appropriate to remain in touch with them to, for example, be aware of research opportunities, discuss career options or learn about how best to secure a training position.\n\nYou may have undertaken previous study or have a prior career relevant to paediatrics, such as allied health or psychology.\n\nThis experience may provide a springboard for your learning and additional opportunities.\n\nWhen you are compiling your CV you can tailor it to the position for which you are applying.\n\nIf you are applying for a paediatric training position, be sure to highlight those occasions during your medical course where you arranged additional paediatric training or clinical experience.\n\nIf you are a doctor you can gain training and knowledge in paediatrics while you complete a Master of Medicine (Child and Adolescent Health) course which is open to doctors in Australia and internationally.\n\nIn some countries, a Master of Medicine is the only requirement for becoming a paediatrician."
