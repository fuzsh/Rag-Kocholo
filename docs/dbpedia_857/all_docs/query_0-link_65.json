        "text": "Excited to share 7wireVentures has led the Series A Funding in Summer Health! The first time I knew I wanted to invest in Summer Health was the moment Ellen D. rejected me when I was interviewing her for another role because of her passion for pediatric health. As we got to know each other, I realized we had a shared mission: To create consumer-first, convenient and trusted care for all parents. Between us we have 6 kids so we've truly seen it all from pink eye to strep, and many sleepless nights. I became an avid user of the platform and fast forward years later, I couldn't be more excited that we're teaming up for the company's Series A. What makes this round of funding even more special is the incredible lineup of investors who are not just backers but active users of the product. It's a true testament to the impact Summer Health is making in simplifying the lives of parents everywhere. Thank you to my co-lead Lux Capital as well as esteemed investors Sequoia Capital, Metrodora Ventures, BoxGroup, Shrug Capital, Leaps by Bayer, and Pivotal Ventures for their continued support and belief in the vision of the business. I'm honored to join the board alongside Deena Shakir, Chelsea Clinton, and Alfred Lin, and I can't wait to contribute to the next phase of Summer Health's journey. With the ongoing doctor shortage projected by 2036, Summer Health's mission to provide accessible pediatric support is more crucial than ever. And as a mom, I've seen firsthand the impact of timely, remote care on familiesâ€”truly transformative. Congratulations to Ellen D., Matthew Woo, and the entire Summer Health team for this incredible achievement. Thank you to Erin Brodwin Axios for sharing our story as well. Here's to scaling even further and continuing to innovate in pediatric care! ðŸŒŸ Let's make parenting just a little bit simpler, together. https://lnkd.in/gpMEm6HA\n\nWe are excited to announce that Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA), the largest pediatric multi-specialty medical group in the US, has selected Nabla Copilot to support their pediatric specialists and streamline clinical documentation, enhancing both clinician well-being and patient care. Matt Keefer, M.D., Chief Medical Informatics Officer at CHLA, recently spoke with Healthcare Innovation about our partnership. He says Â« We certainly did look around at some of the different options. One of the things that really drew us to Nabla was the responsiveness of the team, the interest in improving the product with us and being able to understand how our clinicians were interacting with the patients.Â» We're grateful to the wonderful team at CHLA for their trust, and are thrilled to introduce Nabla Copilot to one of the most prestigious pediatric institutions in the country! More insights into how we tailored Nabla Copilot to meet the unique needs of CHLA's pediatric hospital setting in the link in comments."
