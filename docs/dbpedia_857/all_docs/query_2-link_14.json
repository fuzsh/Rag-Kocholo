Children and their families will have anxiety when a loved one is in pain or gravely ill. Noah‚Äôs Ark provide reassurance and comfort to everyone with a soft approach and environment. A few of the Firerite staff have had encounters with the hospital and have nothing but praise and gratitude for the care their loved ones received. The fundraising and donations mean a great deal to this wonderful charity and we are proud to be a headline sponsor of the Superhero 5k Fun Day again for the 3rd year running!‚Äô Thank you to FireRite for being such a wonderful partner and helping us to create brighter todays and better tomorrows for the 73,000 children cared for at the Noah's Ark Children's Hospital for Wales each year.\n\nThis week ahead of our Superhero 5K Fun Day on June 30, we are introducing you to some of our wonderful event sponsors.
