The program will provide the clinical exposure required to be facile in the evaluation and management of the full breadth of neonatal and pediatric general surgical conditions. In accordance with the objectives of training outlined by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, trainees will achieve competence as medical experts, communicators, collaborators, managers, health advocates, scholars, and professionals. Candidates will be well supported and mentored to achieve their personal and career goals.\n\nStrengths: Faculty from a variety of training backgrounds, with expertise and leadership positions in quality/patient safety, basic sciences research, clinical/translational/outcomes research, and education. Lack of residents and Fellows in other surgical training programs provides ample opportunity to participate in ENT and Urology cases. Strong partnerships with other care providers across disciplines and specialties. The ECMO program is one-of-a-kind, where cannulation is completed on site, but the patient is then transferred for the run to be completed at Stollery Children’s Hospital.\n\nWeaknesses: Global health experience not included in current curriculum.

Its catchment area includes Southern Alberta and extends to southeastern British Columbia and southwestern Saskatchewan. It is an accredited level 1 pediatric trauma centre, and also has a rescue ECLS program. ACH program development has led to the realization of specialized teams and multidisciplinary clinics which care for intestinal rehabilitation, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, esophageal atresia/tracheoesophageal atresia, oncology, and pediatric complex care patients. The general surgery service performs ~1300-1500 cases per year, and the full department performs in excess of 10,000 cases per year across the breadth of pediatric subspecialties.\n\nThe Alberta Children’s Hospital Research Institute has over 150 members, and offers many funding opportunities to support innovation and advancement of pediatric care. Alberta Children’s Hospital is much beloved and championed by the local community, as evidenced by the annual Caring for Kids Radiothon fundraiser, which in 2019 raised a record-breaking total of $6.6 million.\n\nFaculty Information\n\nProgram Director: Andrea Lo\n\nAssociate Program Director: Tito Daodu\n\nProgram manager: Tiffany Jones\n\ntiffany.j.jones@ahs.ca\n\n403-955-2271\n\nFaculty: P.

They will learn the full breadth of pediatric surgery, and are expected to be ambassadors for our division throughout the hospital and wider community. As such, successful candidates for pediatric surgery fellowship must have a demonstrable track record of interest in the field of pediatric surgery, exemplary communication and leadership skills and a commitment to patient/family-centered care.\n\nThe pediatric surgery program at the BC Children’s Hospital is responsible for all tertiary/quaternary level surgical care for children in the province of British Columbia, with an enormous geographical catchment area and a population served approaching 5 million people. As such, we see the full spectrum of congenital, oncologic and pediatric trauma populations, with many routine pediatric procedures (onychectomy, appendectomy, etc…) performed at outside facilities. We take particular pride in servicing our northern, remote and Indigenous communities in a culturally contextualized manner. We also dedicate considerable energy and resources to ensuring a rigorous academic curriculum nested within the educational framework of both the Royal College of Canada as well as the American College of Surgeons (ACS). Our median case volumes remain well within the standards of the ACS, and electives in other surgical subspecialties as well as an international experience are available depending on individual trainee interests and career aspirations.\n\nInstitution Information\n\nTraining Site #1\n\nBC Children’s Hospital, free-standing children’s hospital, with attached obstetrical center (BC Women’s)\n\n4500 Oak St, Vancouver, BC V6H 3N1\n\nFaculty Information\n\nProgram Director: Robert Baird, MD\n\nrobert.baird@cw.bc.ca\n\nAssociate Program Director:\n\nProgram manager: Shania Linggon\n\nShania.linggon@cw.bc.ca\n\nFaculty:\n\nEric Webber MD\n\nErik Skarsgard MD\n\nSonia Butterworth MD\n\nHannah Piper MD (Division Head)\n\nShahrzad Joharifard MD\n\nFellow Information\n\nNumber of fellows: One fellow per year (Matched fellows every other year)\n\nCurrent fellow(s): Moses Kasumba\n\nAmanda Phares (Chief)\n\nPrevious 5 fellows:\n\nAlReem Al-Hinai\n\n2023\n\nRBC Rainbow Babies & Childrens\n\nMartina Mudri\n\n2022\n\nVictoria General Hospital, VIHA\n\nAlGhalya AlMaawali\n\n2021\n\nSultan Qaboos University\n\nArash Safavi\n\n2020\n\nChildren's Hospital of Los Angeles\n\nAnne Shikanda\n\n2019\n\nNorvik Hospital, Uganda\n\nCurriculum Information\n\nMandatory NICU/PICU rotation in y1; electives available\n\n12 months consecutive PSx in y2\n\nProgram Information\n\nRRC accreditation status: Fully Accredited by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada in 2020 (next accreditation in 2026)\n\nMeeting/Training Course policy:\n\nFinancial support for candidate interviews: No\n\nAverage total number of cases performed by graduating fellows over the past 5 years: 1000\n\nBoard passage rate (3 years): 100%\n\nFellow salary: https://www.carms.ca/match/r-1-main-residency-match/salary/#1511459599452-6c7d2a84-0f83\n\nBoston Children’s Hospital Pediatric Surgery Fellowship\n\nLast updated: 1/11/2023\n\nProgram website: https://www.childrenshospital.org/departments/surgery/education/pediatric-surgery-fellowship\n\nBoston Children’s Hospital has a long and rich tradition of training the leaders in pediatric surgery. Our fellowship is the crown jewel of a Department steeped in history as the birthplace of pediatric surgery and yet dedicated to pushing our field forward as a leader in education, innovation, research and clinical care. The fellowship is a two-year clinical training program for which we have three ACGME approved positions. One resident is selected to begin training on odd years and two residents to begin training on even years through the National Resident Matching Program administered by the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS). The applicant must have completed a general surgical training program by the time of program matriculation and be eligible to take the qualifying examination in general surgery given by the American Board of Surgery or the Royal College of Surgeons of Canada.\n\nOur fellowship offers exposure to a large volume of ‘bread and butter’ as well as complex cases with liberal use of minimally invasive techniques. Operative experience includes thoracic, abdominal, urologic, oncologic, vascular, endoscopic and transplant surgery. The Fellows’ clinic (Index Clinic) offers residents the opportunity to regularly participate in outpatient evaluation and postoperative follow-up of pediatric surgical diseases.\n\nThe program is structured to offer residents a total of 16 months of their 24 month tenure as the chief on one of our two services, working closely with our surgical faculty and their co-fellows in all aspects of patient management on the surgical floors, ICU and NICU. A staff of over 18 pediatric nurse practitioners provide the chief residents with experienced and reliable care of all surgical inpatients 24 hours per day and 7 nights per week. In addition, one of the chief residents functions as the administrative chief resident, helping to organize the operating room schedule, large surgical resident and medical student contingent and a robust educational conference schedule. Administrative staff within the Department help the chief residents with these tasks.\n\nA very close working relationship exists between the surgical faculty and the pediatric surgery residents. In addition to primary surgeons coordinating care of patients with the fellows, a staff surgeon is assigned as the “Surgeon of the Day” for acute consults and another staff surgeon as “Surgeon of the Week” to help care for the inpatient services and serve as sounding boards for the fellows as they make patient care decisions.\n\nIn the ICU and NICU, the chief residents collaborate with critical care and neonatology staff to direct the multidisciplinary care of these patients. The general surgery census averages 40-70 inpatients per day.\n\nInstitution Information\n\nBoston Children’s Hospital\n\nBoston, MA United States\n\nNumber of beds: 477\n\nPercentage of time at this location: 100%\n\nTraining site type: Free standing children’s hospital\n\nBoston Children’s Hospital is ranked the number one pediatric hospital in the nation by U.S. News and World Reports.

There is one pediatric surgery fellow assigned as the chief of each service.\n\nCall Schedule\n\nThe pediatric surgery fellows take in-house call only on Fridays, as a “pre-attending” with a faculty backup. Otherwise, they take only home call, which does count toward the 80 hour work week limit. In general, the fellows take home call Q3 and work every third weekend. The pediatric surgery fellows have two weeks of vacation each year per ACGME guidelines.\n\nConference Schedule\n\nThe Department provides a number of didactic teaching programs: Advanced Fetal Care Conference, Fellows Index Clinic, Didactic Lecture Series, Combined Gastroenterology/Surgery Conference, Morbidity and Mortality Conference, Oncology Radiology Conference, Professor Rounds, Combined Radiology/Surgery Conference, Surgical Grand Rounds, Trauma Conference, Vascular Anomalies Conference, and Indications Case Conference.\n\nProgram Information\n\nRRC accreditation status: Continued Accreditation\n\nMeeting/Training Course policy: Financial support for attendance at APSA, AAP, as well as specialty courses such as MIS, Oncology and Colorectal.\n\nFinancial support for candidate interviews: Yes\n\nAverage total number of cases performed by graduating fellows over the past 5 years: 1,160\n\nBoard passage rate (3 years): 100%\n\nFellow salary: $120,000 per year\n\nBrown University\n\nLast updated: 01/11/2023\n\nProgram Website - https://med.brown.edu/pedisurg/index.html\n\nOverview of Fellowship\n\nThe fellowship program at Brown University was first accredited in 1995 shortly after the opening of the new Hasbro Children’s Hospital. Its previous fellows have had a growing impact on the field of pediatric surgery through their roles as Division Directors, NIH (KO8 and R01)-funded clinician scientists, fetal surgery program directors, trauma program directors and missionary pediatric surgeons. The Fellowship Program aims to train excellent clinicians who are future leaders of their field. Hasbro Children’s Hospital, in conjunction with the neighboring 75 bed NICU at Women and Infant’s Hospital, serves a diverse patient population. The setting of Providence, RI provides an energetic and culturally rich background for fellows as they complete their two years of training.\n\nInstitution Information\n\nTraining site #1:\n\nName: Hasbro Children’s Hospital\n\n#beds: 85\n\nPercentage of time at this location: 90%\n\nChildren’s hospital within an adult hospital\n\nBrief description of other hospital information\n\n5000 operations/year\n\n50,000 ER visits/year\n\nPrograms:\n\nFetal Surgery Program\n\nAdolescent Bariatric Surgery Program\n\nVascular Anomalies Program\n\nMultidisciplinary Bowel Rehabilitation Program\n\nLevel 1 Pediatric Trauma Center\n\nLevel 1 Burn Center\n\nPediatric ECMO Program\n\nPediatric Renal Transplant Program\n\nFounding member of NAFNet\n\nTraining Site #2:\n\nName: Women and Infants Hospital\n\n#beds: 75\n\nPercentage of time at this location: 10%\n\nBrief description of other hospital information\n\nMember of NICHD, MFMU, and Neonatal Research Network\n\nFaculty Information\n\nProgram Director Elizabeth Renaud, MD\n\nAssociate Program Director\n\nJulie Monteagudo, MD\n\nProgram manager and contact info\n\nBridget Glazier\n\nbglazier@lifespan.org\n\nphone 401-444-5180\n\nfax 401-444-6681\n\nList of Faculty and titles\n\nFrancois Luks, MD, PhD\n\nProfessor of Surgery, Pediatrics, Obstetrics & Gynecology\n\nDivision Chief, Surgeon in Chief, Hasbro Children’s Hospital\n\nPeter C.W.

Our mission is to provide a well-rounded pediatric surgical education in all facets of our specialty. Our global objective is to prepare the graduates of our program to step into their careers prepared to meet the challenges of the profession, regardless of their ultimate career goals.\n\nDuring the two-year curriculum, fellows work exclusively at the Children’s Hospital Colorado in Aurora. During the first year, the fellow rotates a month each on Neonatology, Critical Care, and Urology. The rotations provide a focused, in-depth experience in each of these subspecialty areas, which are important aspects of pediatric surgical practice. The other nine months are spent on Pediatric Surgery where the trainee will develop expertise in the diagnostic, operative, and perioperative surgical care of patients, from prenatal diagnosis through adolescence, with congenital and acquired anomalies and diseases. As Chief, the second year is designed to prepare the fellow for independent practice, to broaden his/her experience in all areas of pediatric surgery, and to provide greater depth of knowledge in neonatal surgical problems, oncology, trauma management, and surgical disorders of the chest and abdomen. The fellowship is organized to ensure that the trainee is prepared for the American Board of Surgery – Pediatric Surgery Qualifying and Certifying Examinations. Regardless of a fellow’s ultimate career goal, the faculty is absolutely committed to helping all fellows achieve their goals.\n\nThe graduates of our program have established very successful careers across the country. Our fellows are in both academic medical centers and private practice. Regardless of the area of clinical focus, the graduates of our programs have consistently provided feedback that they were more than ready to function independently upon completion of the fellowship program.\n\nStrengths\n\nLarge scope of Pediatric Surgery defined cases\n\nLarge volume of colorectal cases\n\nFinancial support for 6+ national conferences and educational courses\n\nStrong program support for career development\n\nStrong service support minimalizing the trainee’s service obligations\n\nLarge APP support for both services\n\nWeakness\n\nFellows not involved with transplant cases\n\nInstitution Information\n\nChildren’s Hospital Colorado\n\nAurora, CO United States\n\nNumber of beds: 444\n\nPercentage of time at this location: 100%\n\nTraining site type: Free standing children’s hospital\n\nFaculty Information\n\nProgram Director: David Partrick, MD\n\ndavid.partrick@childrenscolorado.org\n\nAssociate Program Director: Jose Diaz-Miron, MD\n\nJose.diaz-miron@childrenscolorado.org\n\nProgram manager: Jaymie Donner\n\nJaymie.donner@childrenscolorado.org\n\nFaculty:\n\nShannon Acker, MD\n\nDenis Bensard, MD\n\nAndrea Bischoff, MD\n\nLuis De la Torres, MD\n\nS.

This fellowship program, designed for residents who have completed their training and are Board-eligible in general surgery, is accredited by the Residency Review Committee (RRC) of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.\n\nThe Division of Pediatric Surgery participates in the National Intern and Resident Matching Plan and chooses one fellow each year for the program.\n\nOur fellowship offers a great breadth of cases. Operative cases include extensive experience with neonatal surgery, anorectal malformations, pediatric surgical oncology, hepatobiliary and thoracic surgery. In the first year, junior fellows gain experience in general pediatric surgery, trauma, neonatology and intensive care of older children, pediatric otolaryngology, and urology. They gradually assume a greater role in patient management and administrative duties in the final two months of the year. In the second year, senior fellows participate in virtually all newborn surgery, tumor surgery and non-cardiothoracic surgery while on service and have administrative responsibilities for weekly conferences.\n\nThere are weekly lectures led by Pediatric Surgery faculty as well as other faculty members from other specialties such as pediatric oncology, neonatology and pediatric anesthesiology. Each weekly lecture is followed by rounds in the Newborn and Infant Critical Care Unit (NICCU), where fellows, residents and medical students review complex neonatal surgical patients and discuss challenging scenarios to simulate the pediatric surgery boards. Pediatric Surgery and NICCU faculty members lead the rounds. Attendance at outpatient clinics one half-day a week is required, and a monthly clinic devoted to long-term patient-care follow-up is mandatory throughout the two-year fellowship. Residents can attend specialty clinics such as Vascular Anomalies Clinic, Colorectal Clinic, Trauma Clinic and Aerodigestive Clinic.\n\nAt our facility, fellows will have access to the knowledge and expertise of 7 (subject to change) pediatric surgeons who have different backgrounds, teaching methods and interests. Fellows will also be mentored on becoming a successful surgeon in academic medicine.\n\nDuring the fellowship, the senior fellow is expected to complete the American Board of Surgery qualifying and certification exams in general surgery. Upon completion of the fellowship program, the graduating fellow will be eligible to take the Board exam in pediatric surgery.\n\nInstitution Information\n\nChildren’s Hospital Los Angeles\n\nLos Angeles, CA United States\n\nNumber of beds: 413\n\nPercentage of time at this location: 100%\n\nTraining site type: Free standing children’s hospital\n\n>17K Discharges/year\n\n>17K surgeries/year\n\nChildren’s Hospital Los Angeles is one of the nation’s leading pediatric hospitals. True to our mission, we have been creating hope and building healthier futures since 1901. Our medical experts offer more than 350 pediatric specialty programs and services to meet the needs of our patients. Our comprehensive approach ensures that each child is cared for, regardless of circumstances, and makes care as accessible and convenient as possible. We believe every child deserves a healthier future and access to the best care possible is central to this belief. That is why we make our expertise available to children across the globe and why we train the next generation of pediatric specialists.\n\nOur hospital has been ranked as a top health care facility for children by U.S. News & World Report magazine every year since the magazine began ranking pediatric hospitals in 1990. In U.S. News & World Report's most recent rankings, we were ranked the No. 1 hospital in California for caring for children.\n\nThe Department of Surgery brings together specialized pediatric knowledge, dedication to excellence and family-centered care in one of the country’s finest, most comprehensive pediatric surgical programs, comprising a full spectrum of surgical specialties. We perform over 15,400 surgical procedures annually for children ranging in age from newborns to adolescents, unlike practices where practice are routinely performed for adults and these approaches are simply adjusted to fit a child. Patients ranging in age from newborns to adolescents are treated in the hospital’s spacious, state-of-the-art Burtie Green Bettingen Surgery Center, which opened in 2001. Our surgeons conduct research and maintain academic affiliations with the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California.\n\nFaculty Information\n\nProgram Director: Christopher Gayer, MD, PhD\n\nAssociate Program Director: NA\n\nProgram manager:\n\nMonica Del Rio\n\nmdelrio@chla.usc.edu\n\n(323) 361-7097\n\nFaculty: Dean Anselmo, MD\n\nChristopher Gayer, MD, PhD\n\nLorraine Kelley-Quon, MD\n\nNam Nguyen, MD\n\nCathy Shin, MD\n\nRyan Spurrier, MD\n\nJames Stein, MD - Interim Division Chief\n\nFellow Information\n\nNumber of fellows: two, one per year\n\nCurrent fellow(s):\n\nLauren Baumann, MD\n\nMichael Zobel, MD\n\nPrevious 5 fellows:\n\nGillian Fell, MD, PhD\n\n2022\n\nStanford Medicine Children’s Health-Lucile Packard\n\nDavid Darcy, MD\n\n2021\n\nUniversity of Rochester – Golisano Children’s Hospital\n\nWillieford Moses, MD\n\n2020\n\nUCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital\n\nAshley Walther, MD\n\n2019\n\nCincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center\n\nShannon Castle, MD\n\n2018Valley Children’s Hospital\n\nCurriculum Information\n\nCall Schedule\n\n1st Year – home\n\nQ2 weekdays\n\nOther – every other weekend2nd Year – home\n\nQ2 weekdays\n\nOther – every other weekend\n\nConference Schedule\n\nWeekly: Pediatric Surgery M&M Conference, Thursday Lecture Core Series, Thursday NICU rounds\n\nMonthly: Trauma M&M Conference\n\nBiannually: Surgical Grand Rounds at USC Keck SOM/academic year, Surgery MM Conference at USC Keck SOM/academic year\n\nProgram Information\n\nRRC accreditation status: Continued Accreditation\n\nMeeting/Training Course policy: Junior fellow attends the transition to the Fellowship Bootcamp, APSA conference and the ACGME Leadership Conference.

The ideal candidate will be dedicated to a career caring for children and possess the characteristics of integrity and an aptitude for scholarship and education.\n\nProgram self-reported strengths\n\nOur program is a busy clinical program with ample opportunities for scholarship. We are in a metropolitan center and pride ourselves on having a friendly and supportive group of faculty and providers, where a positive fellowship experience is our priority.\n\nProgram self-reported weaknesses\n\nMission Statement:\n\nOur mission is to train surgeons to be able to practice independently in the care of newborns, infants, and children and to expose them to scholarly activity, quality improvement, and patient safety.\n\nProgram Aims:\n\nOur program aim is to train pediatric surgical fellows to become excellent clinical surgeons. We emphasize the fields of general, including trauma, and thoracic pediatric surgery. Our fellows are expected to become proficient in open as well as minimally invasive operative techniques. We also train our fellows in the critical care of newborns, infants, and children including ventilator and nutritional management, as well as the care of patients while on ECMO. We expect our fellows to understand the importance of, and participate in, scholarly activity and quality and safety performance improvement.\n\nDescribe how the program will achieve/ensure diversity in trainee recruitment, selection, and retention.\n\nOur university has an office of Diversity, Inclusion, and Community Engagement that helps formulate our policy on diversity which our faculty follows.

The reciprocity agreement between the Royal College and ACGME in the United States permits the trainee who successfully completed the program to be qualified for examinations in Pediatric Surgery given by the Royal College and the American Board of Surgery. The program was founded more than 60 years ago and has trained about a hundred of pediatric surgeons who are now practicing all over the world.\n\nSince August 2020, the program has transitioned to Competency by Design, the Royal College’s model of competency-based medical education. As part of this model, the curriculum is designed to permit the progressive acquisition of the competencies of a pediatric surgeon. The fellows have frequent assessment and meaningful feedback from faculty. The first year include 2 mandatory 1- month rotations (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). During the second year, the fellow works at the level of chief resident in Pediatric Surgery and gain progressive autonomy. A learning plan is tailored toward the needs of the fellow and elective rotations in other pediatric surgical specialties, other pediatric hospital (typically the Montreal Children’s Hospital) or abroad internationally can be organized. The ultimate goal is to train a competent pediatric surgeon ready for an independent practice in an academic or non-academic position.\n\nInstitution Information\n\nCHU Sainte-Justine\n\nMontreal, QC Canada\n\nNumber of beds: 400 with 80 NICU and 32 PICU beds\n\nPercentage of time at this location: 100%\n\nTraining site type: Free standing children’s hospital\n\nThe CHU Sainte-Justine is a francophone Level 1 trauma center with 12 000 traumas per year including 600 admissions in trauma. It has a 15-room surgery department where more than 10 000 surgeries are performed annually. It offers the whole breadth of highly specialized pediatric surgical services and is the training center for multiple pediatric fellowships training programs (Neonatology, Pediatric Intensive Care, and Maternal-Fetal Medicine), giving a rich opportunity for interaction with other pediatric fellows. CHU Sainte-Justine is also a kidney and liver transplant center and the fellows, depending of their interest, are welcome to be involved with the care of these patients. Since 2016, a new 7-story specialized unit building integrating clinical care and research has been added to the hospital. Specific opportunities for research include: oncology, clinical bioethics, simulation based training, and surgical education). The “Centre de simulation mère-enfant” is a simulation center located in the hospital allowing a facilitated access for interdisciplinary simulation activities.\n\nFaculty Information\n\nProgram Director: Ann Aspirot, MD, FRCPC\n\nAssociate Program Director:\n\nProgram manager: Caroline Dufour\n\ncaroline.dufour.hsj@ssss.gouv.qc.ca\n\n514-345-4688\n\nFaculty:\n\nMarianne Beaudin, MD, MPH, FRCPC\n\nMona Beaunoyer, MD, FRCPC\n\nSarah Bouchard, MD, FRCPC, FACS\n\nRebecca Brocks, MD, FACS\n\nMichel Lallier, MD, FRCPC\n\nNelson Piché, MD, MSc, FRCPC, FACS\n\nDickens Saint-Vil, MD, FRCPC, FACS\n\nFellow Information\n\nNumber of fellows:\n\nAlternately, one one year and two the other year for a total of three fellows\n\nCurrent fellow(s):\n\nJames Saltsman\n\nKristen Calabro\n\nCamille Plourde\n\nPrevious 5 fellows:\n\nDre Catherine K.

During the training period, fellows are responsible for the care of pre- and post-operative patients in both inpatient and outpatient clinic settings. As fellows master increasingly difficult skills and become adept at communicating with children and parents, they are assigned higher levels of responsibility in and out of the operating room. The Division of Pediatric Surgery offers a comprehensive didactic curriculum examining all major topics in pediatric surgery. Fellows participate in weekly conferences on morbidity and mortality, pediatric radiology and pediatric oncology; attend bimonthly lectures on basic science topics; and participate in a monthly pediatric surgical pathology conference and journal club. Pediatric surgery residents present a weekly pediatric surgery conference for surgical and pediatric house officers, pediatric and surgical attendings, and nurses. In addition to clinical efforts, pediatric surgery fellows are expected to participate in the division's research mission. Studies driven by pediatric surgery fellows are strongly encouraged and will ideally result in original work being presented and published on the national/international level.\n\nInstitution Information\n\nChildren's Healthcare of Atlanta, Egleston\n\nAtlanta, GA United States\n\nNumber of beds: 340\n\nPercentage of time at this location: 95%\n\nTraining site type: Free standing children's hospital\n\nOn average, ~6500 cases/year including Scottish Rite\n\nChildren's Healthcare of Atlanta, Scottish Rite\n\nAtlanta, GA United States\n\nNumber of beds: 325\n\nPercentage of time at this location: 5%\n\nTraining site type: Free standing children's hospital\n\nFaculty Information\n\nProgram Director: Matthew S.

It is Maryland’s largest children’s hospital with 205 beds and the only state-designated Trauma Service and American Burn Association-Accredited Burn Unit for pediatric patients. Patients from age 0-21 are admitted to the Children's Center. The facility is equipped for all aspects of general pediatric care, with a 40-bed intensive care unit (PICU), a 45-bed neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and laboratory and radiology facilities. A pediatric medical and surgical oncology ward (14 beds), psychiatric wards and general pediatric age-determined wards complete the inpatient facility. A suite of 10 operating rooms for children's surgery and a pediatric recovery room adjacent to the PICU are utilized by pediatric general surgery, urology, orthopedics, neurosurgery, and otolaryngology services. The Johns Hopkins Outpatient Center houses the clinical facilities for outpatient visits (approx. 45,000/year). The Park Building, adjacent to the Children's Center, has a pediatric emergency room, oncology and hematology clinics, and a perfusion center.\n\nThe pediatric surgical staff at the Johns Hopkins Hospital is under the direction of David J. Hackam, MD, PhD, The Robert Garrett Professor of Pediatric Surgery and co-director of Johns Hopkins Children’s Center. There are also full-time specialty surgeons in pediatric orthopedics, urology, neurosurgery, otolaryngology, plastic and cardiovascular surgery.\n\nUnder the direction of Samuel M. Alaish, M.D., the post-doctoral training program in Pediatric Surgery at The Johns Hopkins Hospital and the University of Maryland Medical Center is unique in concept, because it utilizes the clinical population of two large university services for a broad clinical experience in pediatric surgery over the prescribed two years. Both divisions of Pediatric Surgery perform more than 3,200 operations annually and have a staff of 14 pediatric surgeons. Completion of the basic two-year program will qualify the trainee to take the examination for a “Certificate of Special Competence in Pediatric Surgery,“ which is given by the American Board of Surgery.\n\nHistory\n\nSupport of pediatric surgery by the Robert Garrett Foundation began in the 1940s. These funds enabled Dr. Alfred Blalock to conduct his animal laboratory experiments on congenital heart disease and helped support Dr. Helen Taussig with her clinical evaluation of children with cyanotic congenital heart disease. These studies led to the development of the Blalock-Taussig shunt and culminated in the first clinical use of their subclavian artery-pulmonary artery anastomosis for a child with tetralogy of Fallot in November 1944. In 1964, Dr. J. Alexander Haller became the first pediatric surgeon-in-charge of The Johns Hopkins Hospital and Chief of the Division of Pediatric Surgery. Later that year, Dr. Haller finished training the first chief resident in pediatric surgery, Dr. James L. Talbert, who left to become the Chief of Pediatric Surgery at the University of Florida in Gainesville. In 1976, Dr. J. Laurence Hill was recruited to the University of Maryland with a joint appointment at Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1977. With Dr. Hill’s arrival, the first integrated training program in pediatric surgery was born. In 1991, Dr. Paul M. Colombani was appointed the pediatric surgeon-in-charge and second Garrett Professor of Pediatric Surgery. Following Dr. Colombani’s departure in 2014, Dr. David J. Hackam became the third Garrett Professor of Pediatric Surgery and Co-director of the Johns Hopkins Children’s Center. In 2015, Dr. Samuel M. Alaish became the fourth training director, following Dr. Fizan Abdullah’s move to Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago.\n\nSince 1965, a long line of talented and accomplished people have graduated from our fellowship. Notable alumni include James Talbert ’65, Paul Colombani ’83, Richard Azizkhan ’85, Francisco Cigarroa ’93 and Jessica Kandel ’95 to name just a few.\n\nInstitution Information\n\nJohns Hopkins Children’s Center\n\nBaltimore, MD United States\n\nNumber of beds: 205\n\nPercentage of time at this location: 87.5%\n\nTraining site type: Children's hospital within adult hospital\n\nUniversity of Maryland Medical Center\n\nBaltimore, MD United States\n\nNumber of beds: 800\n\nPercentage of time at this location: 12.5%\n\nTraining site type: Children's hospital within adult hospital\n\nFaculty Information\n\nProgram Director: Samuel M.
