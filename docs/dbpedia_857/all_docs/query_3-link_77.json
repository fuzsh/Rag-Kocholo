        "text": "Your child will be given antibiotics to treat their pneumonia if doctors suspect it’s caused by bacteria. It’s not always easy to tell if pneumonia is caused by bacteria or a virus. Sometimes doctors may decide to give antibiotics if they can’t be sure of the cause.\n\nIf it’s likely that your child has bacterial pneumonia, they will be given antibiotics in liquid or tablet form to fight the bacteria. Your child’s symptoms will usually improve within the first 48 hours - but they’ll probably continue to cough for longer.\n\nIt’s important to finish the whole course of antibiotics, even if your child seems better. If they don’t finish the whole course, the bacteria may not have been treated fully. This means that bacteria can become resistant to the antibiotics, making it harder to treat the pneumonia.\n\nIf your child’s pneumonia is caused by a virus then antibiotics won’t work. Usually, symptom management and rest are all that are needed for treating viral pneumonia.\n\nMany children with pneumonia can be looked after at home. If you’re looking after your child at home, make sure:\n\nthey get enough rest\n\nthey stay hydrated -give them small amounts to drink regularly\n\nthey are going to the toilet as normal - this is a sign that they’re hydrated\n\nthey take children’s paracetamol or ibuprofen if their chest or tummy hurts - remember that cough medicine doesn’t help with pneumonia\n\nyou or others don’t smoke around your child\n\nyou do not overdress or underdress them to try and help their temperature. The NHS has more information on how you should look after a child with a high fever.\n\nYou can ask your child’s doctor for more information on how to look after your child at home. Speak to them if your child’s condition gets worse too.\n\nIf your child has another lung condition\n\nIf your child has another lung condition, like asthma, it’s important that they continue to take any regular medication to keep it under control. Speak to your child’s doctor if you’re concerned about their condition getting worse.\n\nYour doctor will assess if your child should be looked after in hospital based on their symptoms and other factors, including their age. Babies under six months old are more likely to be admitted to hospital.\n\nYour doctor will consider if your child:\n\nhas difficulty breathing\n\nis dehydrated because they won’t feed or drink\n\ncan’t take antibiotics through their mouth\n\nis breathing very fast\n\nhas low oxygen levels in their blood\n\nis not responding to the prescribed antibiotics (for example, if they still have a fever after two days of antibiotic treatment)\n\nhas another lung, heart, or immune deficiency condition.\n\nIf your child does need to be treated in hospital, they may be given:\n\nantibiotics through a drip\n\nfluids through a drip if they’re dehydrated\n\noxygen if their blood oxygen levels are low.\n\nThere are a number of things that you can do to reduce the risk of your child developing pneumonia.\n\nVaccination\n\nThe pneumococcal vaccine (PCV) is a vaccination to protect children against bacterial pneumonia caused by streptococcus pneumoniae. All babies are offered the PCV vaccine as part of their childhood vaccination programme. Your child may also be offered the vaccine when they’re older if they have a long-term health condition. The NHS has more on who can get the PCV vaccine.\n\nYour child should get the PCV vaccination for free on the NHS. Babies are offered two doses of the vaccine. The first is at 12 weeks old and the second is at one year of age.\n\nYour child should also have a yearly flu vaccination from the age of two until 11 or older. This will reduce the risk of them developing pneumonia as a complication of the flu.\n\nRemember to keep your child up to date with all their vaccinations, including the coronavirus vaccine.\n\nAvoid infection\n\nAvoid people who have signs of a respiratory infection such as a cough, colds, coronavirus, or flu.\n\nTeach your child to use a tissue when coughing and sneezing and throw away used tissues immediately. They should also wash their hands regularly too.\n\nDo not smoke, or let others smoke, around your child\n\nBreathing in passive smoke can make your child more likely to pick up an infection and can make existing infections worse. We have more information about how passive smoking and air pollution can affect your child’s lungs.\n\nYou can call our Helpline on 0300 222 5800 (9am - 5pm; Mon - Fri) to talk to our clinical team for support if your child has pneumonia.\n\nYou may also benefit from joining our Parent and Carer Support Network which provides support and a space for parents and carers of children with lung conditions to come together.\n\nWe have more information you may find useful:\n\nSigns of breathing problems in children\n\nWhen should I call 999?\n\nAvoiding infection"
