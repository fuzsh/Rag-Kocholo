        "text": "Many thanks to Alder Hey Children’s Hospital for allowing us to film their medical staff for these first films.\n\nThe aim of these films is to answer some of the key questions which people might want to know about the medical professionals that are looking after their child.\n\nWe have asked a range of professionals working in different medical specialties to answer questions such as:\n\nWhat are the main jobs undertaken by someone working in your specialty?\n\nWhat groups of children do you work with in your day to day work?\n\nWhat other health care professionals do you work with?\n\nDo you prescribe medicines?\n\nWhat are the common misconceptions about what your role?\n\nWhat does an average week at work involve for you?\n\nWithin your role, do you have any advice for parents and carers?\n\nWhy did you want to go into your specialty of medicine?\n\nWhilst in Alder Hey we also filmed the following series of interviews with health care professionals – these will be released over the next few months:\n\nThe role of a General Paediatrician\n\nTaking part in clinical trials\n\nThe role of a WellChild nurse\n\nIn the New Year we will be developing additional films and are keen to interview further health care professionals who work with children."
