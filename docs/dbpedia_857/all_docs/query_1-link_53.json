        "text": "What is a paediatrician?\n\nPaediatricians are medical specialists who diagnose, treat, and provide medical care for babies, children and teenagers. They treat illnesses and will check your child’s physical, mental and behavioural development.\n\nWhat training does a paediatrician have?\n\nIn Australia, paediatricians need to complete at least 6 years of full-time training after they become a doctor.\n\npaediatric emergency medicine\n\nneonatal and perinatal medicine, focusing on the fetus and on premature and newborn babies\n\ndevelopmental and behavioural paediatrics\n\npaediatric cardiology, focusing on heart conditions\n\nWhat conditions do paediatricians treat?\n\nPaediatricians treat a wide range of illnesses, injuries and conditions. They often examine and treat babies immediately after birth. They often examine and treat babies immediately after birth. They can assess and, if necessary, resuscitate newborns, and manage treatment of premature babies.\n\nPaediatricians treat babies, children and teenagers with:\n\ncancer\n\ngenetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis and Down syndrome\n\ndisabilities such as cerebral palsy\n\ndevelopmental delays\n\nchronic diseases such as diabetes\n\ninfectious diseases such as meningitis\n\nasthma and allergies\n\nautism spectrum disorder\n\nWhere do paediatricians work?\n\nPaediatricians see children in a treatment centre, clinic or in a community health centre. Many work in public and private children's hospitals, and treat babies in maternity units, special care baby units and neonatal intensive care units. Some paediatricians work in the hospital emergency department.\n\nThey often work as part of a multidisciplinary team. These teams may also include doctors, nurses, social workers, physiotherapists and other allied health professionals.\n\nHow do I choose a paediatrician?\n\nAsk your GP or obstetrician to refer you to a suitable paediatrician. For some disorders, your child will need to be seen by a paediatrician who has sub-specialised in a particular area.\n\nUnless the matter is urgent, you may have a long wait before you can get an appointment with a paediatrician for your child.\n\nIf you prefer to see a specific paediatrician (for example, if they treat one of your other children, or if they are recommended to you by family or friends) discuss this with your GP, and they can arrange a referral.\n\nWhen should I see a paediatrician?\n\nYour GP can manage most common childhood illnesses, but may refer you to a paediatrician for specialist care of more complex health conditions. Your GP will first assess your child and refer you to an appropriate paediatrician, if required.\n\nASK YOUR DOCTOR — Preparing for an appointment? Use the Question Builder to help you form a list of questions to ask your GP or paediatrician. You can print this off and take it with you to your appointment.\n\nHow much will it cost to see a paediatrician?\n\nPaediatricians' fees vary a lot, depending on:\n\nthe type of care your child receives\n\nwhether it's in hospital or not\n\nwhether you have private health insurance\n\nwhat the paediatrician charges\n\nOut-of-hospital care\n\nIf you see a paediatrician in their rooms, Medicare will cover:\n\nall of the costs if they bulk bill\n\nsome of the costs if they don't bulk bill\n\nYou can't use private health insurance for out-of-hospital care.\n\nIf you visit a paediatrician out of hospital without a referral from a GP, Medicare will not cover the costs.\n\nTreatment in a public hospital using Medicare\n\nIf your child is treated in a public hospital or clinic and you use Medicare, it will be free. Medicare will cover all the costs.\n\nTreatment in any hospital using private health insurance\n\nIf you use private health insurance for treatment in either a public hospital or a private hospital or clinic, you will be charged by the paediatrician and by the hospital.\n\nYou might also be charged for pathology test, x-rays and other forms of imaging, and by other doctors you see. Your private health insurance may cover some of these costs.\n\nAsking about costs\n\nIt can be expensive to see specialists, including paediatricians.\n\nBefore you go for your first appointment, it’s a good idea ask the paediatrician or their staff about the costs. You can also ask what Medicare will and will not cover.\n\nIf you plan to use private health insurance, you can also contact your health fund.\n\nResources and support\n\nFIND A HEALTH SERVICE — The Service Finder can help you find doctors, pharmacies, hospitals and other health services."
