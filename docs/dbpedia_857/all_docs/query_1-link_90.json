You'll need to consider the care and support needed by the wider family, including parents and carers.\n\nWhy choose children's nursing\n\nThere are many reasons why you should consider a career as a children’s nurse. It offers you the chance to make a difference, a high degree of flexibility and a career with excellent employment prospects.\n\nWorking life\n\nNursing a child is not just a question of caring for a small adult. Children have very specific health needs and you need to understand how a healthy child develops towards adulthood to minimise the impact of illness. This involves working in closely with the parents or guardians.\n\nCommunication is also factor when treating children. Adults can express their feelings and can identify the severity and nature of pain. A child may not be able to communicate this in such detail and the nurse needs to interpret child’s behaviour and reactions. Children's nurses need to be able to spot when a child's health takes a turn for the worse, which can often happen rapidly.\n\nA child’s care takes place in a range of settings including hospitals, day care centres, clinics and in the community such as child's home\n\nChildren's nurses are part of multidisciplinary teams that look after patients. You will be at the centre of teams that include doctors, hospital play staff, healthcare assistants, newborn hearing screeners, psychologists and social workers.\n\nEntry requirements\n\nTo become an children's nurse the main route is through a degree course at university.

Some universities may ask for three A levels or equivalent. If you already have a degree, you might be able to study for a postgraduate qualification.\n\nThere are other routes into child nursing such as nurse degree apprenticeships and nursing associate apprenticeships.\n\nAnnual payments\n\nIf you're eligible, you'll receive at least £5,000 a year towards your studies while at university. Your personal circumstances may mean you could receive more. And the good news? You'll never have to pay it back. Find out more.\n\nOther routes into children's nursing\n\nNursing degree apprenticeships are available with some employers and numbers are expected to continue to grow. Increasing opportunities to apply for nursing associate apprenticeships are also expected. This can lead to nursing degrees or nurse degree apprenticeships.\n\nMust have skills\n\nDon’t forget - academic qualifications aren’t everything.
