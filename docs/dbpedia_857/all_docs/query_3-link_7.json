        "text": "Around 30,000 patients have been treated the £64m Noah’s Ark Children’s Hospital for Wales since it opened exactly a year ago.\n\nNoah’s Ark patron Charlotte Church joined First Minister Carwyn Jones and Health Minister Mark Drakeford in opening the state-of-the-art site on May 15, 2015.\n\nThe hospital houses specially-designed surgical theatres, hydrotherapy and MRI facilities on five floors. Over 17,000 patients having been admitted to its wards and more than 1,000 operations have taken place.\n\nChildren on the wards will be treated to birthday cake on Monday as well as a visit from Frozen’s Anna and Elsa, balloon modelling, fun and games.\n\nMary Glover, lead nurse for the hospital, said: “The whole first year has been great. I feel really proud to show people around this fantastic building. I absolutely love it.\n\n'Amazing team'\n\n“We are able to do more for the patient than we’ve done before, there are more facilities for parents who can stay with their child on the unit, which helps as it gives them more comfort while they are here.\n\n“There’s space for parents to rest and siblings to play which helps families to be together during difficult times. It’s hard to say what my favourite bit of the children’s hospital is as I just love it all.\n\n“I feel very proud to work with such an amazing team in such great surroundings.”\n\nThe new children’s outpatient department has speciality services such as Ear, Nose and Throat ophthalmology, audiology and orthopaedics.\n\nDevelopments have continued into the first year, with the opening of LATCHmosphere ambient lighting system in the Radiology department in June 2015, which has seen a reduction in the need to use general anaesthetic as children undergo MRI scans using only LATCHmosphere to keep them relaxed.\n\nRead more: A new caravan will help more children battling cancer get a seaside holiday\n\nThe Noah’s Ark hydrotherapy pool for outpatients gives relief to children with a range of conditions, while the dental clinic opened in May 2016.\n\nMichelle Murdoch, whose son Louis is on Island Ward at the hospital, spoke about how special the place is.\n\nShe said: “Louis has type 1 SMA which is a neuro muscular disease.\n\n“He was diagnosed with this condition when he was five months old. We have had the best care whatever part of the hospital we have stayed in and had the same nurses to care for our son throughout his illness.\n\n“Because Louis’ condition is life-limiting, we are always given a cubicle, even down on Ocean ward in the old hospital. It’s important for him to be on his own as he can’t be around other people who may be poorly [and] pass on their coughs and colds.\n\n'Everything I need is here'\n\n“The new hospital is fab. It is mostly individual rooms or small bedded bays which allow you to have your own space and privacy as a family, with your own bathroom. I don’t have to leave Louis in the night if I need the bathroom or want a shower – everything I need is here.”\n\nHayley Williams’ son Samuel, who is nearly one year old, is a patient awaiting a tonsillectomy.\n\nRead more: Mum gives her son's Real Madrid shirt to six-year-old with leukemia\n\nShe said: “Samuel has been ill since October 2015, and it has taken several months to get a proper diagnosis of his condition. Within a few days of being admitted to the children’s hospital, Samuel received his diagnosis and started to receive treatment. When we came into the hospital, warm, smiling faces welcomed us and the nurses showed me around – they have been so great.\n\n“Everything about Samuel’s condition is discussed with me, to my face – not behind closed doors.\n\n“They make me feel included about decisions with his care.\n\n'Life-saver'\n\n“Shortly after I arrived, a nurse offered me accommodation at the hospital, and within two hours I had a key in my hand and somewhere to stay, I can’t believe how quickly things are done here.\n\n“It’s been a life-saver during a very stressful time.”\n\nConsultant paediatric anaesthetist Felicity Howard added: “Working here makes me feel properly equipped to do my job.\n\n“My favourite bit is the children’s theatre suite. It has been purposely-designed with children in mind, with a comfortable reception area for parents, with toys for children to play with.\n\n“As all staff are all together in one area, the theatre team works more cohesively together, particularly the anaesthetic side. I always feel overwhelmed when a patient sends in a card after receiving excellent care – it’s lovely to be appreciated. Families are so appreciative of the care and treatment they receive.”"
