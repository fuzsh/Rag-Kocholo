This includes tests to know what is wrong and treatment. This is provided in hospitals and in the community or your own home. Your child’s treatment, safety and comfort are of great importance to us. We will do everything we can to make their visit or stay as pleasant as possible.\n\nIf your child is seriously unwell or seriously injured, please call 999.\n\nFor illnesses that are not as serious, please use the NHS Wales - symptom checker (opens in new tab) or make an appointment with your GP. Call NHS Direct Wales 111 if you are unsure about what to do.\n\nChildren with minor injuries (such as sprains, cuts or minor burns) can be seen at minor injury units or in some community pharmacies.\n\nYou may be asked to take an unwell child to your nearest Emergency Department with children’s specialists on-site. In our area, this is at Glangwili Hospital, Carmarthen, and Bronglais Hospital, Aberystwyth."
