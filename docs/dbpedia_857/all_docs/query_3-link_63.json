        "text": "Retinoblastoma is a rare cancer. Your child will go to a specialist centre for treatment.\n\nThere are different treatments such as:\n\nfreezing the cancer (cryotherapy)\n\nlaser therapy\n\nchemotherapy\n\nradiotherapy\n\nsurgery\n\nThe treatment your child has depends on several things. This may include the size of the cancer and if it is in one or both eyes.\n\nTreatment centres\n\nThere are 2 specialist retinoblastoma centres in England. They are:\n\nThe Royal London Hospital\n\nBirmingham Children's Hospital\n\nThese 2 centres serve all parts of the UK including Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. They have teams of specialists who know a lot about retinoblastoma and how to treat it.\n\nThere is a lot to think about as a parent and you’re likely to worry about getting the best treatment for your child. Talk to the doctors or specialist nurses about any worries that you have. They might also be able to put you in touch with other parents of children who have already been through diagnosis and treatment.\n\nDeciding which treatment your child needs\n\nA team of doctors and other professionals discuss the best treatment and care for your child. They are called a multidisciplinary team (MDT).\n\nTreatment aims to:\n\nget rid of the cancer\n\nsave the eye or eyes\n\nprovide the best possible vision for your child\n\nThe doctors also want to provide treatment with the fewest possible side effects. This is for both in the short term and in the long term.\n\nTreatment planning for your child depends on several factors including:\n\nwhere the cancer is\n\nif the cancer is in one or both eyes\n\nthe size of the cancer\n\nhow far it has spread\n\nthe number of sites of cancer in the eye\n\nYour child’s doctor will talk to you about the treatment, its benefits and the possible side effects.\n\nTypes of treatment:\n\nChildren usually have their treatment while they are asleep. This means they have it under a general anaesthetic . They’ll be awake if they’re having chemotherapy into their bloodstream. This is called systemic chemotherapy.\n\nFreezing therapy (cryotherapy)\n\nCryotherapy is a treatment that uses extreme cold to destroy cancer cells. It’s a local treatment, which means that it only affects the area where you have the treatment. It doesn’t treat any cancer cells in other parts of the body. Cryotherapy is best for very low and some low risk retinoblastomas in the outer edge of the retina.\n\nThe doctor uses a metal probe that’s cooled to a very low temperature. The probe then freezes the cancer cells and kills them.\n\nLaser therapy\n\nThere are 2 types of laser treatment for retinoblastoma:\n\nphotocoagulation\n\nthermotherapy, this is also called transpupillary thermal therapy (TTT) or heat therapy\n\nA laser is a very thin, focused beam of light. It destroys the tissue it’s directed at. The doctor aims the beam through the dark centre of the eye called the pupil.\n\nPhotocoagulation laser treatment is different to thermotherapy. This is because the laser delivers the light at different strengths. Photocoagulation laser treatment can help to destroy the blood vessels that feed the cancer.\n\nThermotherapy is another type of laser treatment. This treatment uses infrared light. The doctor aims this light at the cancer and slowly burns away the cancer cells, destroying them by heat.\n\nYour child usually has laser treatment if the cancer is small and at the back of the eye. They might also have it with or after chemotherapy.\n\nRadiotherapy\n\nDoctors treat some retinoblastomas with radiotherapy. Radiotherapy means the use of radiation to treat cancer cells.\n\nBrachytherapy\n\nYour child might have a type of radiotherapy called brachytherapy . This means your child has a small radioactive disc called a plaque stitched directly over the cancer. The plaque works by continuously delivering a high amount of radiation to the small part of the eye it covers. You might hear it called localised radiotherapy. Your child will have the plaque in place for a few days. The doctor then removes the plaque.\n\nProton beam radiotherapy\n\nProton beam radiotherapy is a type of external radiotherapy. Your child might have this if the cancer has spread to the:\n\nnerve between the eye and the brain (optic nerve)\n\nhole in the skull where the eye sits (eye socket)\n\nProton beam therapy uses a different type of radiation to brachytherapy. It is called proton radiation. The proton beams are aimed precisely at the cancer. This type of radiation causes less damage to the healthy tissue around the eye.\n\nWe have more information about radiotherapy to the eye area. It is for adults with eye cancer.\n\nSurgery\n\nYour child might need surgery to remove the eye. This is called an enucleation. This is usually when the cancer is large and the eye is no longer working. If your child has cancer in both eyes, they might remove the worst affected eye.\n\nIt can be devastating to find out your child needs to have their eye removed. Your child will usually recover and adapt quickly. And it doesn’t usually stop them from doing what they want to do.\n\nAfter removal of the affected eye the surgeon fits an implant. This is like a small ball to replace the lost eye. This will fill their eye socket. It’s attached to the muscles, so it moves in sync with the other eye.\n\nYour child also has an artificial eye (prosthesis) made to cover the implant. This will match their original eye and is like a large contact lens. Your child usually has this fitted a few weeks after surgery.\n\nWe have more information about surgery to the eye. It is for adults with eye cancer.\n\nChemotherapy\n\nChemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells. Your child might have their chemotherapy in one or more of the following ways:\n\ninto their bloodstream (intravenously) through a long flexible plastic tube - systemic chemotherapy\n\nthrough a blood vessel (artery) to the affected eye - intra arterial chemotherapy or IAC\n\nas an injection directly into the jelly part of the eye - intravitreous chemotherapy\n\nYour child might have chemotherapy:\n\nto try and shrink the cancer first if it is large. They might have this before a local treatment such as laser therapy\n\nif there is any risk that the cancer might have spread\n\nThey usually have a combination of chemotherapy drugs. Doctors commonly use a combination called CEV also known as JOE. This includes:\n\ncarboplatin\n\netoposide\n\nvincristine\n\nThis combination is given in cycles of treatment.\n\nOther chemotherapy drugs used for systemic chemotherapy include:\n\ncyclophosphamide\n\nifosfamide\n\ndoxorubicin\n\ntopotecan\n\nDoctors use the following chemotherapy drugs for treatment through a blood vessel or as an injection directly into the jelly part of the eye:\n\nmelphalan\n\ncarboplatin\n\ntopotecan\n\nSide effects\n\nThe side effects of having chemotherapy into the artery or vitreous of the eye can be different to those of intravenous chemotherapy. These might include side effects such as:\n\ninflammation\n\na droopy eyelid\n\na squint\n\nThese are usually temporary. There can also be a risk of reduced vision.\n\nYour child’s doctor will go over the possible risks of having chemotherapy into the eye with you.\n\nGoing to sleep (general anaesthetic)\n\nYour child will receive most of their treatment, tests or scan while they are asleep. They won't be asleep when having systemic chemotherapy.\n\nTo get your child to sleep a nurse or doctor puts a small tube (cannula) into your child’s hand or arm. The nurse first puts some local anaesthetic cream on the area to numb it. Your child might still feel the needle go in, but it shouldn’t be painful.\n\nYou can usually go with your child to theatre before the operation or examination. You wait with your child in a room next to the theatre, called the anaesthetic room. You can give your child a cuddle and reassure them until they are beginning to fall asleep.\n\nThe anaesthetist gives your child the anaesthetic through the cannula in their hand. Or, they gently place a mask over your child’s mouth. Your child breathes in the anaesthetic gas until they fall asleep. A member of the team will let you know when the treatment, test or scan has finished.\n\nIt’s not unusual to feel very emotional seeing your child drift off to sleep. The theatre or ward team may take your mobile number and call you as soon as they are awake.\n\nSide effects\n\nYour child’s doctor will talk to you about the possible side effects. The side effects your child might have depend on the type of treatment they are having. Some of the possible side effects include:\n\nLoss or changes to eyesight\n\nMost parents worry about whether their child will lose their sight. Whenever possible, the doctor will try to keep the sight of the eye. Removing the affected eye will not cause sight loss in the other eye. Children learn to adapt very quickly and live a normal life, often going to mainstream school.\n\nIf your child has retinoblastoma in both eyes, it’s possible that your child will lose some sight. This might mean they need to have visual impairment support. This will be either in a mainstream school or a specialist school.\n\nSome treatments, such as laser treatment, might cause changes to their sight. Your child might complain that it’s not as bright as before. Other comments might be that they can see dots or lines (floaters) and flashes of light. Let their team know straight away if this happens.\n\nIncreased risk of infection\n\nChemotherapy can cause a drop in your child’s white blood cells. Symptoms include:\n\na change in temperature\n\naching muscles\n\nheadaches\n\nfeeling cold and shivery and generally unwell\n\nYour child might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.\n\nYou should contact your child’s advice line urgently if you think they have an infection.\n\nHearing changes\n\nSome chemotherapy drugs can cause changes to your child's hearing. These include carboplatin and cisplatin. They might have hearing tests before these types of drugs. Let your child’s doctor or nurse know if you or your child notices anything different with their hearing.\n\nA second cancer\n\nAlthough the risk is very small, chemotherapy can cause a second cancer to develop later in life. If your child has an inherited retinoblastoma, they are more at risk of getting a second cancer later on. These cancers include sarcoma or melanoma. Your child’s doctor will talk this through with you and answer any questions you may have about it.\n\nTrilateral retinoblastoma is a very rare type of cancer. Children with inherited retinoblastoma can develop this. It starts from the pineal gland in the centre of the brain, behind the brain stem. It makes the hormone melatonin which controls sleep. Symptoms include headaches and feeling and being sick.\n\nIf your child is at risk of this, your doctor will talk to you about it. Your child will have regular follow ups.\n\nRetinoblastoma that has come back or not gone away\n\nAlmost all retinoblastomas are successfully treated. But some cancers can come back again (recurrence or relapse) or don’t go away (refractory). Your child’s doctors will develop a treatment plan. This will depend on:\n\nwhat treatment they have already had\n\nwhere the cancer is\n\nthe size of the cancer\n\nhow far it has spread\n\nyour child’s general health\n\nYour child’s healthcare team will explain the different treatment options. They will support you through this difficult time.\n\nFollow up\n\nYour child will have regular follow up appointments with their specialist. They are very close together to start with and then get gradually further apart as time goes on. These appointments are to check:\n\nhow they are recovering\n\ntheir development\n\nif they are having any problems following treatment\n\nif there are any signs the retinoblastoma has come back\n\nThese appointments usually include your child having a general anaesthetic. This way their doctor can have a close look at their eyes.\n\nYour child will have genetic counselling when they are old enough to understand their condition. They will also have advice on living a healthy lifestyle. This can help them reduce their risk of getting a second cancer by:\n\navoiding smoking\n\nprotecting their skin from the sun\n\nfollowing a healthy diet\n\ndoing exercise\n\nusing alcohol moderately\n\nCoping when your child has cancer\n\nIt is understandably devastating when a child is diagnosed with cancer. Although many children with cancer are successfully treated, it is a difficult time for everyone involved.\n\nYou and your child will also have support from several professionals during and after treatment. These include:\n\ndoctors and nurses on the ward\n\nyour GP\n\ncancer nurse specialists\n\nsocial workers\n\nplay specialists\n\na psychologist or psychotherapist\n\nTalking to other people who are experiencing the same thing can also help. Our online discussion forum, Cancer Chat, is a place for anyone affected by cancer. You can share experiences, stories and information with them.\n\nThere are children's cancer organisations that you can contact for help and support.\n\nThe Childhood Eye Cancer Trust is a charity. They support families and people affected by retinoblastoma. It:\n\noffers support and information\n\nfunds research\n\nraises public awareness of this rare cancer"
