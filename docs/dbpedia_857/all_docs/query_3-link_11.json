        "text": "The list goes on, including:\n\nEmotional Support for Brothers and Sisters\n\nBenefits Advice\n\nAdvocacy\n\nSignposting\n\nWard-based family Support Workers\n\nAnd much more!\n\nLATCH needs to raise on average £700,000 a year to cover the costs of supporting families. With no paid fundraisers, we rely heavily on the hard work of volunteers and remain proud to have one of the lowest management expenses for a charity in the whole of the UK. Last year alone, over £300,000 was awarded to families in the form of financial grants last year alone.\n\nPutting it simply, LATCH makes life easier for children and their families so that they can give their all to their treatment without letting anything else get in their way. Time and time again, families stress that LATCH lifted them when they needed it the most and in many cases stopped them from buckling. It’s only thanks to individuals and organisations up and down the country that these services have helped, and continue to help, countless families across Wales when they are most in need."
