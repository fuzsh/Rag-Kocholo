        "text": "Pediatric surgery is a discipline of rare diseases. Although pediatric surgeons treat a number of common conditions, such as appendicitis and inguinal hernias, their training and practice are centered on gaining the skills to correct congenital anomalies, resect pediatric solid tumors, and treat a number of rare surgical conditions in children. Since the inception of the specialty, the rarity of pediatric surgical diseases has challenged the generation of high-quality research to inform best practices. These challenges have been particularly significant in Canada where, given the population and the size of the country, many pediatric surgical practices are small in volume.1 A 10-year review of the level of clinical evidence of scientific presentations at the annual meetings of the Canadian Association of Paediatric Surgeons (CAPS) demonstrated that 80% were rated as Oxford level 4 or 5.2 This was also typical of the pediatric surgical field in general. Rangel and colleagues3 analyzed clinical research reporting in pediatric surgery during a 5-year period and found that 95% of studies were retrospective, and only one-fourth of those studies used a control group. Hardin and colleagues4 analyzed more than 9,300 studies published in the major pediatric surgical journals and found that only 1.48% and 0.3% were prospective and randomized controlled trials, respectively. Since the turn of the century, there has been a loudly echoing call to improve research methods and quality of evidence in pediatric surgery.\n\nCanadian pediatric surgery was among the first to answer this call by creating the Canadian Pediatric Surgical Network (CAPSNet).5 The network, initially funded by a grant from the Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR), was established in 2005 and consists of 16 perinatal centers across Canada. CAPSNet created a national population-based observational database for 2 congenital anomalies, gastroschisis and congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Data are collected starting from prenatal diagnosis until hospital discharge of the baby. CAPSNet has been immensely successful, resulting in a large number of publications during the past 15 years.6 In addition, CAPSNet initiated the concept of research collaboration within the Canadian pediatric surgical community and spurred further initiatives, including the Canadian Biliary Atresia Registry and the Canadian Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Collaborative.7,8\n\nNevertheless, CAPSNet, The Canadian Biliary Atresia Registry, and the Canadian Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Collaborative have some important limitations. The disease-based nature limits the number of participating investigators to those with a particular interest in the disease studied. This in turn limits the number of centers participating in knowledge generation and translation. In the case of CAPSNet, the bulk of the publications came from only 4 of the 16 centers participating in data collection. The open-ended nature of the registry presents challenges in continued patient enrollment, funding, and sustainability. Retrospective reviews of prospectively collected data do not allow for the possibility of conducting clinical trials or hypothesis testing in a prospective manner. Clearly, a new model was needed to further advance the quality of Canadian pediatric surgical research. This model is the Canadian Consortium for Research in Pediatric Surgery (CanCORPS), the subject of this article. We present this as a potential model for other specialties in Canada and beyond that wish to create similar national research organizations. Such organizations have strong potential to improve research quality, evidence-based practice, and knowledge translation by uniting practitioners throughout the country.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nPediatric surgery embodies a clinical discipline that treats a variety of both common and rare conditions, encompassing both congenital and acquired pathology of the head and neck, thorax, abdomen, genitourinary system, and integument, and spanning the prenatal period until transition to adulthood. Individual practitioners typically accrue a limited personal experience of the entire breadth of practice. This infrequency also constrains the capacity to perform rigorous trials that elucidate best treatment options. Patient recruitment and retention, trial costs, and the ethical challenges of surgical research in a pediatric population result in a limited evidence base to inform best practices.15,16\n\nCanCORPS was created to improve pediatric surgical care through high-quality collaborative research. CanCORPS aims to elevate the quality of pediatric surgical research by providing the highest scientific and ethical research standards. It currently includes 15 major pediatric institutions across Canada and is about to add a 16th. With that addition, the Consortium will unite all of Canadian pediatric surgery in 4 common objectives: (1) to provide a platform for the successful conduct of collaborative, multi-institutional research focused on patient-centered outcomes; (2) to improve the efficiency of scientific and ethical reviews through streamlining of research protocols; (3) to maintain the highest degree of scientific and ethical integrity in conducting research initiatives; and (4) to promote the dissemination of new knowledge into pediatric surgical practice and healthcare policy. Results of its studies will reflect national practices and facilitate standardization of care. This was already evident in the Consortium’s first study on congenital ovarian cysts, where the results allowed the creation of a standard algorithm for evaluation and treatment of these lesions.14 This algorithm will be submitted for a future prospective observational CanCORPS study.\n\nA consortium is “an agreement, combination, or group (as of companies) formed to undertake an enterprise beyond the resources of any one member.”17 Clinical research consortia such as CanCORPS follow this principle, undertaking clinical research initiatives that cannot be efficiently or effectively attained or reached by a single institution alone. Also often termed as “networks” or “collaboratives,” clinical research consortia can frequently be differentiated from “multi-institutional studies” by the establishment of up-front common principles, policies, and administrative agreements that facilitate multiple initiatives, all focused on a common goal or theme of research shared by all members.\n\nMany well-known Canadian clinical research consortia have successfully demonstrated the benefits of this new paradigm in clinical research. Pediatric Emergency Research Canada is a network of pediatric emergency medicine researchers from all 15 designated pediatric health centers in Canada.18 Strict rules of governance guide the management of Pediatric Emergency Research Canada studies. Similarly, the Pediatric interest group of the Canadian Critical Care Clinical Trials Group has capitalized on the consortium infrastructure of the Canadian Critical Care Clinical Trials Group to successfully run many large-scale trials in the realm of pediatric critical care.19 Through a progressive data-sharing partnership with the existing research scaffold of the Canadian Neonatal Network, CAPSNet continues to collect granular, population-based, disease-specific data salient to the care of children with congenital diaphragmatic hernia and gastroschisis.20 Although its reach is limited, its focus on these specific conditions has facilitated successful evidence-enriched changes to practice and improvements in outcomes.8,21,22 The Canadian Neonatal Follow-Up Network similarly facilitates collaborative research between Canada’s primary neonatal follow-up sites but goes beyond to engage in knowledge translation and quality improvement.23 Finally, the Maternal Infant Child and Youth Research Network facilitates multijurisdictional pediatric and maternal research in Canada by addressing barriers to collaboration and fostering linkages between organizations, as well as housing its own clinical trials consortium.24\n\nWe herein describe the inauguration of a national pediatric surgical research collaboration designed to generate and disseminate new knowledge in the service of children with surgical conditions and their families. It builds on the achievements and experiences of many of the aforementioned consortia as well as non-Canadian consortia such as the Midwest Pediatric Surgery Consortium and the Pediatric Surgery Research Collaborative.25,26 It further builds on the benefits of collaborations such as CAPSNet and Pediatric Emergency Research Canada in that it involves all major pediatric surgery services in Canada, thereby facilitating research with a population-health lens, and enables high case volumes and a diversity of skills akin to the Midwest Pediatric Surgery Consortium and Pediatric Surgery Research Collaborative. Formal agreements and central coordination within CanCORPS facilitate ethics applications at individual sites, processes that vary due to the diversity of associated university processes and provincial healthcare systems. Central coordination also permits information to flow more easily and selectively between sites, lessening the burden of site-specific researchers.\n\nThe Consortium also allows for effective communication and coordination between various site investigators and support staff such as research coordinators, which, in turn, facilitates forward momentum on projects. This also helps to disseminate workload, because what is learned at one center can be used to anticipate difficulties that may be encountered at another. This collaborative organization allows institutions with an established research culture in place to act as role models for institutions with less research experience. Consequently, this consortium is not only improving the quality of pediatric surgery research on a national level, but also has a very favorable impact on all participating institutions. A clear Consortium agreement that contains criteria for study selection and guidelines on authorship provides clarity on prioritizing studies and their output. This agreement, which can be found in Supplemental Digital Content 2 (http://links.lww.com/JACS/A144), contains a tremendous amount of intellectual property. It can serve as a model for specialties, in Canada and beyond, who wish to emulate it. Major lessons were learned throughout the inception, creation, and implementation of CanCORPS. A summary of the most important elements of success is shown in Figure . Most of these elements were envisioned from the inception as part of a roadmap for creation of CanCORPS, but some were learned along the path of creation and implementation. Other important steps that may have further facilitated the implementation of the Consortium include the appointment of a Consortium biostatistician to oversee all generated data, earlier seeking of collaborations with some of the organizations mentioned earlier, and strongly encouraging division chiefs to provide some protected time to CanCORPS site directors.\n\nThese benefits do not come without their challenges, however. The pace of study initiation can be slower than single or smaller multi-institutional endeavors due to the need for interinstitutional communication. Each institution has different levels of resources to facilitate onboarding projects (eg REB), collecting data and enrolling patients. As such, large and more complex (eg prospective) studies can be more daunting to initiate at some centers relative to others. All healthcare and research in Canada falls under provincial jurisdictions. Harmonization of research ethics board approvals has proven to be a challenge due to the lack of reciprocity among provinces. The Consortium is collaborating with the CIHR Canadian Collaboration for Child Health: Efficiency and Excellence in the Ethics Review of Research initiative, as mentioned earlier, to address these limitations. The Consortium benefited from an endowed chair at one of its founding institutions to provide seed funds for establishing its infrastructure. These seed funds have supported the salary of the national coordinator and some logistics, such as meeting expenses. However, ongoing funding, not only to maintain the central infrastructure of the consortium, but also funding for individual sites to permit their ongoing participation remains an ongoing challenge. Protected time for research activities remains a challenge for many of the CanCORPS investigators, most of whom are busy clinicians. Grants, whether by governmental or nongovernmental organizations, are provided to support studies, rather than infrastructure. CanCORPS plans to meet future funding challenges by initiation of institutional membership fees, and by submitting grant applications to support specific studies to CIHR and other relevant organizations.\n\nThe future of CanCORPS depends on the engagement of its member institutions, responsible stewardship of its executive committee, and the selection and execution of high-impact studies that position the Consortium to compete for external funding opportunities. Children with surgical diseases suffer from multiple barriers to receiving care firmly supported by high-level evidence, including the rarity of many of these diseases and the underrepresentation of pediatric participation in prospective trials. Higher quality, multi-institution initiatives such as CanCORPS are clearly needed to address this gap in evidence-based practice. The patients we serve deserve nothing less."
