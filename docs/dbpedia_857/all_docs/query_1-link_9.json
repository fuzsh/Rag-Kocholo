        "text": "What makes a community child health paediatrician?\n\nA community child health paediatrician is a doctor who has expertise in working with vulnerable groups of children and their carers. They also have a particular role with children who are 'looked after or are in the process of being adopted.\n\nThey hold clinics in a variety of settings, including schools, with an emphasis on continuity of care, and have strong skills working with multiple agencies, particularly with education and social care.\n\nCommunity paediatricians have a vital role in planning and implementing local strategies to improve the health of all children in their area, including safeguarding policies and overseeing universal and targeted lifestyle programmes.\n\nTraining in this sub-specialty\n\nIn summer 2023, we launched RCPCH Progress+, our updated, two-level paediatric training programme in the UK.\n\nPaediatricians start in core training, and then move on to specialty training - when some choose to apply to train in a paediatric sub-specialty, such as community child health.\n\nThe Progress+ curriculum provides a framework for paediatric training, and outlines the Learning Outcomes and Key Capabilities required at each stage before attaining the Certificate of Completion of Training (CCT).\n\nThe RCPCH Progress+ syllabi support the curriculum with further guidance on how the Learning Outcomes can be achieved and demonstrated, with sub-specialty Learning Outcomes. You can download the Progress+ syllabi for this sub-specialty and for specialty training (generic) at the bottom of this page.\n\nTrainees due to CCT by September 2024 continue to use the Progress curriculum and syllabi; you can also download the the Progress syllabi below.\n\nAdvice from the Community Child Health CSAC\n\nNote: This advice was written for Progress, and will be updated for Progress+.\n\nThe CSAC is the College Specialty Advisory Committee, and supervises the development and delivery of sub-specialty training.\n\nLength of programme\n\nThe CCH training programme is designed as a three-year training programme.\n\nTraining is generally 36 months for specialty trainees, with a minimum requirement of 24 months CCH clinical training.\n\nThe remaining 12 months may be in a specialty relevant to CCH, a specific area of CCH (to develop a special interest) or approved research. The CSAC will be flexible about the nature of the ‘relevant specialty’ or research but it must help the trainee to enhance their competences in CCH (see ‘Relevant specialties’ section below).\n\nWith competency-based assessment, it is possible to complete training in less than 36 months but trainees will have to demonstrate that they meet the competencies of the curriculum to the depth and breadth required to practice independently as a community paediatric consultant in the UK. A minimum of 24 months spent in CCH is essential and non negotiable.\n\nLevel 2 training does not count towards Level 3 training. Therefore you cannot count your Level 2 (‘core’) CCH training towards Level 3\n\nRelevant specialities\n\nThe CSAC is flexible about posts in other specialties which can be counted towards higher specialist training. RCPCH sub-specialty training posts that have been approved by the relevant RCPCH CSAC as below will automatically count for specialty training:\n\npaediatric neurodisability\n\npaediatric neurology\n\nchild mental health\n\npaediatric palliative medicine\n\naudiovestibular medicine\n\nSPINs are available in all of the above areas.\n\nThese will automatically be approved for higher specialist training in CCH and will not require specific approval from the CSAC.\n\nPosts outside this list of named RCPCH sub-specialties may still be approved but must be approved by the CSAC before a trainee takes up the post. Retrospective recognition will not be given.\n\nOther appropriate training could include general paediatrics, public health, audiovestibular medicine, CAMHS, clinical genetics, inherited metabolic disease, research and medical education. This list is not exhaustive. Posts in such specialties may not be approved if it is felt that the experience is more general and not particularly CCH orientated.\n\nPlease note that placements in specialties outside paediatrics, for example a full time placement in CAMHS cannot be recognised for training in paediatrics without prior approval and may need to be recognised as OOPT/E.\n\nResearch posts\n\nTrainees counting one year of research towards Level 3 must do the other 24 months in CCH to complete training. Trainees must ensure competencies are kept up to date during research time. Research posts must be Deanery and GMC (General Medical Council) prospectively approved as OOPR (out of programme research). If wishing to count towards training, posts must approved by CSAC before starting to ensure they are relevant to CCH competencies.\n\nOverseas posts\n\nApproval must be sought prospectively for trainees wishing to count an overseas post towards training."
