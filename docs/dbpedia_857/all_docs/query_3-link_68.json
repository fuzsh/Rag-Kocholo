        "text": "The Children’s Epilepsy Surgery Service (CESS) in England is a specialist service that aims to improve access to epilepsy brain surgery for children with difficult to control epilepsy.\n\nIt does this by working with other NHS services to ensure children who could benefit are referred. The service then assesses each child’s suitability for epilepsy surgery.\n\nEach CESS centre has an expert team of children’s epilepsy specialists, neurosurgeons, and other healthcare professionals. These teams have the specialist knowledge and skills needed to assess and treat children who are suitable for epilepsy brain surgery.\n\nThe CESS is funded by NHS England for children with epilepsy in England. There are 4 specialist CESS centres that will treat children from all over England, not just those in their local area.\n\nHere is a video of some children talking about their epilepsy surgery.\n\nThe CESS centres\n\nBirmingham Children’s Hospital NHS Foundation Trust\n\nGreat Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation\n\nTrust and King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London\n\nDepartment of Paediatric Neurology, Bristol Royal Hospital for Children\n\nThe Northern Children’s Epilepsy Surgery Services (NorCESS) Alder Hey Children’s NHS Foundation Trust (Liverpool) and Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital (Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust)\n\nAlthough CESS is funded by NHS England, it will also treat children who live in Wales but are registered with a GP in England. And they will provide services for children or families in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland if their child lives or goes to school in England.\n\nOther children from Wales and Northern Ireland will be referred to the CESS centres for assessment. This is arranged on an individual basis by the local consultant paediatrician or neurologist.\n\nThis information looks at what is involved before, during and after epilepsy brain surgery. If your child is already being considered for surgery, the CESS centre will be able to give you more information and answer any questions you have.\n\nTypes of epilepsy brain surgery for children\n\nThere are many different types of epilepsy brain surgery. The type your child has depends on their type of seizures, and where the seizures begin in their brain. Here are some of the more common types:\n\nFocal resection\n\nThis is done when surgeons know which part of the brain the seizures start in. Children having this type of surgery have a small part of their brain removed. Although this sounds worrying, the surgeon will only take away damaged parts that aren’t needed.\n\nIf the part of the brain causing the seizures is in the temporal lobe, the surgery is called a ‘temporal’ resection. If the part of the brain causing the seizures is in one of the other lobes, it is called an ‘extra-temporal’ resection.\n\nCorpus callosotomy\n\nDuring this surgery the 2 hemispheres (halves) of the brain are separated. It is mainly used for generalised seizures, particularly frequent drop attacks (tonic and atonic seizures), and myoclonic seizures that affect the whole body. It is also used for severe focal seizures that start in one hemisphere and spread to the other.\n\nHemispherectomy / hemispherotomy\n\nThis is major surgery to remove or separate (disconnect) one half of the outer layer of the brain from the other. It is for children who have seizures because one half of their brain is badly damaged or not working properly.\n\nRemoving one hemisphere is called ‘hemispherectomy’. Sometimes the hemisphere is not removed, but completely disconnected from the rest of the brain. This is called hemispherotomy.\n\nWhat happens during surgery?\n\nWhat happens during surgery will depend on the type of surgery the child is having. Most children will have a small cut made in their skull, so that the surgeon can see their brain. The surgeon may then remove some bone.\n\nOn rare occasions, and only usually in children older than 12 years, the surgeon may wake the child up during part of the operation. This is done so that they can find the part of the brain that controls language and movement. The surgeon will explain to your child why this happens. Afterwards, the bone is replaced and fixed to the skull for healing.\n\nMost epilepsy brain surgery takes at least 4 to 6 hours, and sometimes longer.\n\nWhat happens after surgery?\n\nAfter their surgery, your child:\n\nWill have a swollen and painful head and face from a few days to 2 weeks. One or both eyes may be swollen and difficult to open\n\nWill need to take painkillers for a few days\n\nWill need to rest and relax for a few weeks, but gradually become more active\n\nWill probably stay away from school for a few weeks, but most children are back by 6 weeks. This should be discussed with your child’s surgery team\n\nShouldn’t play contact sports for at least 4 to 6 months\n\nMost children will need to stay in hospital for around 7 to 10 days following surgery. The amount of time can vary depending on the type of surgery. Some children may have to stay in hospital for longer whilst they recover.\n\nYour CESS centre will give you advice about caring for your child once they leave hospital.\n\nBelow are some general guidelines for activities parents commonly ask about:\n\nHair washing\n\nYou can usually wash your child’s hair before they leave hospital. This might be with the support of the ward nurses. Depending on your CESS centre’s practice, this is likely to be between 3 and 7 days after their surgery.\n\nIt will also depend on the type of stitches used. The advice is only to use shampoo and no other hair products, such as conditioner, until the wound has completely healed. Hot hair dryers and straighteners should be avoided initially. Your epilepsy nurse will be able to advise you further.\n\nReturning to school\n\nThis is very much decided on an individual basis but may be up to a few weeks. It is recommended that going back to school starts off slowly – usually with a visit and then gradually building up from a couple of hours to full time. Most children are likely to be back by 6 weeks after surgery. If your child returns before then, they should avoid any outdoor play until 6 weeks after surgery.\n\nLeisure activities (excluding contact sports)\n\nYour child can go back to their usual activities between 6 and 12 weeks after surgery. Please discuss this further with your surgeon or epilepsy surgery specialist nurse practitioner.\n\nContact sports\n\nWhile your child should avoid contact sports in the initial post-surgery recovery period at home, they can usually go back to them between 6 and 12 months after surgery. Some surgeons are happy for this to start earlier. It is very important to discuss this with your surgeon and epilepsy surgery specialist nurse practitioner as this can vary depending on the contact sport.\n\nSwimming\n\nBecause of the risk of infection, it is important your child avoids swimming for 6 weeks following surgery. When they start swimming again, it is very important that their usual measures for having epilepsy and being safe in the water are in place.\n\nFlying\n\nIf you are planning to fly soon after your child’s surgery, it is important to discuss this with their surgeon or epilepsy surgery specialist nurse practitioner. Your child may require an x-ray to check they are safe to fly and might need a fit-to-fly letter before being able to travel.\n\nAfter surgery care\n\nOnce your child leaves hospital, their care will be shared between the CESS centre and the doctor who referred them for surgery.\n\nBenefits and risks\n\nThe tests and assessments done before epilepsy surgery are very thorough. They are to make sure that the benefits of surgery are higher than the risk of any complications.\n\nThe main benefits are stopping or significantly reducing seizures. But successful epilepsy surgery may also have other benefits, such as:\n\nBeing able to stop or reduce epilepsy medicines and their side effects\n\nImproved quality of life\n\nThe risks depend on the part of the brain being operated on. You will be able to discuss these with the surgery team before the final decision is made about surgery for your child.\n\nHere are some possible risks:\n\nComplications from surgery\n\nAs with any major surgery, there is a small risk of infection or bleeding. If there are any complications from surgery, this could mean your child will need to stay in hospital longer than expected.\n\nMemory problems\n\nThe temporal lobes handle memory and language, so any surgery on the temporal lobes can cause problems with remembering, understanding and speaking. The memory problems can be for things that a child has seen (‘visual memory’) or for things that a child has heard (‘auditory or verbal memory’).\n\nMore seizures than before\n\nCutting the connections between the 2 hemispheres (sides) of the brain in corpus callosotomy stops seizures spreading from one hemisphere to the other. But it doesn’t stop all the seizures, only the drop attacks. In fact, some children may have more focal (partial) seizures, but they are less severe.\n\nVisual symptoms\n\nAfter removing one hemisphere of the brain in hemispherectomy, a child’s vision might be affected for a few days or weeks. Their vision might be reduced, or they might have double vision. They might also have some problems with their peripheral vision. This could be temporary or permanent, depending on how much of the brain has been removed.\n\nOne-sided paralysis\n\nAfter hemispherectomy or hemispherotomy, a child may have limited use of one side of their body. This paralysis is called a ‘hemiparesis’ or ‘hemiplegia’. Physiotherapy and occupational therapy can help children affected with this.\n\nBehaviour problems\n\nSome children may have had behaviour problems before the surgery. Or they may have had problems communicating or relating to other people. Epilepsy surgery itself will probably not help these problems. It is even possible that a very few children will have worse problems than before.\n\nReferral to a CESS centre\n\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says that children with epilepsy should have regular reviews of their epilepsy and treatment. At their review, or if they are having problems with their epilepsy at any other time, they may be referred to a CESS centre.\n\nThis is most likely if:\n\nAn MRI scan shows that there is some damage or other problem in a specific part of the brain or\n\nInitial treatment with epilepsy medicines does not result in a seizure free period of six months\n\nThe CESS centre will look at the information in the referral and should accept it if the child has any of these things:\n\nSevere epilepsy that started in the first few years of life, and is thought to come from a single part of their brain\n\nA magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan which has shown an abnormality in one or more parts of the brain. An example might be a benign tumour or a hypothalamic hamartoma\n\nFocal epilepsy (also called partial epilepsy) that has not been controlled with 2 epilepsy medicines, used either singly or together. These children may, or may not, have an abnormality on an MRI scan\n\nA weakness down one side of the body (hemiplegia) and epilepsy that has not been controlled with 2 epilepsy medicines, used either singly or together\n\nSturge-Weber syndrome or Rasmussen’s syndrome\n\nDrop attacks\n\nTuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) with epilepsy that has not been controlled by 2 epilepsy medicines, that have been used either singly or together\n\nSupport and services\n\nThe centre your child is referred to will make sure you and your child have access to the support and services listed below. This includes during the assessment, before, during and after their surgery:\n\nThe chance to visit the CESS centre and meet the surgery team before surgery\n\nSupport for your family for the time when your child is in hospital\n\nA child-friendly environment with toys, books and activities that are right for your child\n\nA management plan agreed with you and your child. This should include details about follow-up care, and the monitoring and review process\n\nA named doctor or healthcare professional who will coordinate your child’s care and act as a link between you and the people treating your child\n\nAccess to a member of the team for advice, information and support 24 hours a day\n\nAccess to an epilepsy specialist nurse\n\nYou will also be given clear information about your child’s condition including:\n\nA description of their epilepsy\n\nHow their epilepsy will be managed\n\nMedicines and other treatments they might receive\n\nHow you and your child can get the best from their treatment\n\nEmotional and behavioural support\n\nDetails of patient support groups and charities\n\nContact details for your child’s named nurse"
