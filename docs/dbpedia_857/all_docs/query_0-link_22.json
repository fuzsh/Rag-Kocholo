        "text": "Sheffield Children’s is an extraordinary place. It is dynamic and ground-breaking, with state-of-the-art facilities and a worldwide reputation for the most amazing treatment. Sheffield Children’s is about people. People who are caring, compassionate and amongst the best at what they do in the world. The mission of every single person is exactly the same – to help create a healthier future for children and young people we care for.\n\nSheffield Children’s is unique as it is the only NHS children’s organisation providing such a broad range of services, from the most intensive emergency care through to support for families in the community and at home – supporting both the mental health and physical health of children and young people.\n\nProfessionally many colleagues are leaders in their fields, recognised nationally and internationally for their expertise shaping paediatric care. Among its countless specialisms, Sheffield Children’s is a pioneering centre for neurosurgery including brain tumour removal, hosts the UK’s leading Sleep Service and receives newborn screening referrals from around the world through its dedicated clinical genetics department.\n\nSheffield Children’s Hospital may appear modest but once you step through the doors it is dynamic, ground-breaking and encapsulates how charity funding and the NHS can work together to create something great. From its foundation, it has always depended on charitable support, The Children’s Hospital Charity helps to ensure the ongoing needs of the hospital continue to be met funding projects above and beyond NHS provision.\n\nChildren come from all over the country for treatment at Sheffield Children’s and The Children’s Hospital Charity work hard to make it better. The money raised through donations buys life-saving equipment, funds vital research and treatment for thousands of children from across the world and helps us create a comfortable, engaging environment for our patients.\n\nSheffield Children’s is now just one of three specialist children’s hospitals in the UK, alongside Great Ormond Street and Alder Hey in Liverpool."
