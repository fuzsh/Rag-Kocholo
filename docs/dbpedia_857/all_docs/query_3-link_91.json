His mother noticed changes in his behavior and weight. So, they brought him to the pediatric emergency department at AdventHealth Celebration. Shortly after arriving, Sebastian stopped breathing. Our pediatric specialists quickly stabilized Sebastian before transferring him to AdventHealth for Children. There, doctors found that Sebastian had a congenital heart condition called supraventricular tachycardia, which causes his heart to beat abnormally fast. Now, with regular medication and monitoring, Sebastian can live a happy and normal life — all because a mother trusted her gut."
