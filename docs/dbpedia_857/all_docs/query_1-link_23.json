        "text": "I’ve always had a passion for medicine, although after college I had a brief career as a junior high school English teacher and swim team coach.\n\nAfter working closely with young people as teacher and coach, I knew pediatrics was my calling. I became fascinated with pediatric cardiology while in medical school, and an elective rotation as a student at BCH sealed the deal – I had found the field that would engage, fascinate, and challenge me my entire career. One of the best parts of being a pediatric cardiologist is the long-term relationships you build with patients and families, to help and share in the best of times and in the most challenging of times as well. As Director of our Fellowship Training Program, I get to mentor and coach our future colleagues in the field; working with our amazing trainees is one of the great joys of my career."
