        "text": "Hospital at Home is a service aimed at treating children with minor illnesses at home in Grimsby.\n\nThe service takes referrals from Emergency Department, the Paediatric Assessment Unit (PAU) and Rainforest Ward. If a child meets the criteria, they will be discharged from hospital and the team will make contact within two hours by telephone, before a visit is arranged within four hours. The service takes referrals from GPs too, so the child doesnâ€™t need to even attend hospital.\n\nWhen the nurse visits the child at home, they will carry out an assessment, which includes recording a pulse rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation level, temperature and blood pressure. As well as assisting the family to care for their child, the team will help educate parents on managing future illness and how to access the appropriate health care.\n\nThe service takes referrals for the following minor illnesses:\n\nBronchiolitis\n\nViral induced wheeze/asthma\n\nGastroenteritis/diarrhoea and vomiting\n\nFever of known origin\n\nCroup."
