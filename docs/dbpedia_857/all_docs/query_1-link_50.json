It brings together special lights and sensory elements, as well as Disney favourites Mickey Mouse and Goofy, Ariel from The Little Mermaid and Hank from Finding Dory - all sculpted specifically for the Reef.\n\nDuring the spectacular opening ceremony of London 2012, there was a tribute to the UK’s National Health Service (NHS). A special mention was given to GOSH in the routine when hospital beds were arranged to depict a child's face with a smile and a tear (the hospital charity's logo).\n\nNine patients from GOSH were also lucky enough to be part of the routine!\n\nQueen Elizabeth II has a long history with GOSH, visiting in 1952 during the hospital’s centenary celebrations and becoming a Patron of Great Ormond Street Hospital in 1965. The Queen also made a special visit to the hospital during its 150th anniversary year in 2002 while also celebrating the Golden Jubilee.\n\nDiana, Princess of Wales, served as president of the Hospital from 1989 until her death. A plaque at the entrance of the hospital commemorates her services, as well as a bust in the lobby of the hospital chapel.\n\nJ M Barrie donated all the rights in ‘Peter Pan’ to Great Ormond Street Hospital in 1929, and this gift was later confirmed when he died in 1937.\n\nSince then the hospital has received royalties every time a production of the play is put on, as well as from the sale of ‘Peter Pan’ books and other products.\n\nBarrie requested that the amount raised from ‘Peter Pan’ should never be revealed, and the hospital has always honoured his wishes."
