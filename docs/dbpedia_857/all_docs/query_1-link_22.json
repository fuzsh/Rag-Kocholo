        "text": "Pikeville Medical Center, like most acute care hospitals, has historically focused on both ends of life’s spectrum, from the beginning of life with obstetrics and neonatal services to the end of life with adult specialties. However, there has been a noticeable void of services offered to the pediatric population. No matter where this void is found, it can cause several problems, including financial and emotional stress to families when traveling with children, often frightened by the unknown and unfamiliar surroundings. In addition, these hardships can affect the healing process in children. Knowing this, Pikeville Medical Center has spent the past several years working to bolster the level of care offered to pediatric patients and improve their overall experience at PMC.\n\nIn 2021, PMC celebrated the opening of the Mettu Children’s Hospital (MCH), the only dedicated children’s hospital in Eastern Kentucky, offering over 13,000 square feet of space for both inpatient and outpatient services. Everything about the MCH was designed to care for children, from the jungle-themed decorations and child-friendly exam rooms to comforting patient rooms and a distraction therapy area for times when the environment is just too overwhelming.\n\nThe inpatient section of the Mettu Children’s Hospital encompasses over 8,100 square feet and consists of a family-friendly waiting room, 10 private patient rooms (two of which are isolation rooms), a consultation room, a treatment room, a medication room, a nourishment room and more.\n\nThe PMC Urgent Care and Family Wellness Center has a full-service pediatrician office staffed with highly trained pediatricians and numerous support staff who specialize in the care of children. These services are located in a 5,300 square foot space consisting of separate sick and well waiting rooms as well as a welcoming check-in and registration area. Inside the clinic area are 13 exam rooms, a medication room, a nurses’ station and more.\n\nThe administration of Pikeville Medical Center recognized the need to offer pediatric specialty services not currently offered in-house, which prompted the establishment of a relationship with the University of Kentucky (UK Healthcare) Children’s Hospital. Through this partnership, PMC is bringing the known expertise of Kentucky’s top pediatric heart program as well as other pediatric specialty programs to Eastern Kentucky. The success of this partnership is being seen in the improved health of pediatric patients from the region who require specialty care.\n\nPediatric patients, and especially their families know they have access to exceptional care at Pikeville Medical Center, whether they need inpatient care, outpatient treatment or specialty services.\n\nA child’s pediatrician plays an important role in the growth and well-being of his or her life. A pediatrician will:\n\nDo physical exams\n\nAdminister recommended immunizations\n\nMake sure the child is meeting developmental milestones in growth, behavior, and skills\n\nDiagnose and treat the child’s illnesses, infections, injuries, and other health problems\n\nGive parents/guardians information about the child’s health, safety, nutrition and fitness needs\n\nAnswer questions about child’s growth and development\n\nRefer to and collaborate with a specialist should the child become ill and need care beyond the pediatrician’s expertise\n\nPMC Urgent Care and Family Wellness Center\n\n238 Cassady Blvd\n\nPikeville, KY 41501\n\n606-430-2207\n\nPikeville Medical Center’s (PMC) Emergency Department (ED) is seeing an increasing number of pediatric patients. This growing group prompted PMC to begin the certification process in November 2019 to become “Pediatric Ready” by the Kentucky Emergency Medical Services for Children (KYEMSC) Program.\n\nBeing recognized as “Pediatric Ready” demonstrates PMC’s commitment to enhancing emergency care services for children in our region.\n\n“This recognition could not have come at a better time,” explained Clinical Manager of the PMC ED Brandi Adkins, RN, BSN.\n\n“PMC is growing by leaps and bounds when it comes to pediatric care.We feel this announcement is just the beginning of great things to come.”\n\nDuring the assessment, surveyors met with several staff members from various departments within the hospital to review procedures and documentation from PMC’s ED and discuss pediatric care provided at PMC.\n\nSoon after the onsite review, PMC’s ED was notified that it had met the qualifications and was named a Pediatric Ready ED.\n\nOnly four other hospitals in Kentucky have been certified Pediatric Ready"
