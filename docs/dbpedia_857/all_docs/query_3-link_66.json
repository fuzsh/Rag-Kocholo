        "text": "Imagine the terror of not being able to breathe because your lung muscles are paralysed. You're gasping for air as the medical team slides you into something that looks like a coffin on legs. They seal you in up to your neck and a strange 'whooshing' sound starts somewhere in the room. Then, relief! Your lungs pull in fresh air and you find you're breathing again.\n\nThe coffin-like cabinet respirator—better known as the 'iron lung'—was the state-of-the-art in life support technology in the first half of the 20th century. The first iron lung was used at Boston Children's Hospital to save the life of an eight-year-old girl with polio in 1928.\n\nPhilip Drinker and Louis Agassiz Shaw invented the first iron lung at Harvard School of Public Health. It consisted of a huge metal box with a set of bellows attached at one end to pump air in and out. The whole body was enclosed in an airtight chamber, apart from the head. A tight rubber seal supported the neck and ensured that air did not escape.\n\nMechanical breathing apparatus were not a new idea, but the huge scale of the polio epidemics motivated researchers to come up with a device.\n\nIn 1931, John Haven Emerson improved on the ‘Drinker’ design by improving access to the patient. He made the bed slide in and out of the cabinet and added portholes to the sides allowed access to the patient without loss of air pressure.\n\nDrinker and Harvard University felt that the Emerson respirator was too similar to the original and sued Emerson for infringing on their patents. In court, Emerson's lawyers demonstrated that all the technologies used by Drinker already existed and so could not be patented.\n\nEmerson won the case and all the patents were declared invalid. The judge also agreed with Emerson that a technology that saved lives should be shared by everyone.\n\nA few years later, the Both Respirator was born of necessity. When a polio epidemic broke out in Australia in 1937, the cost of buying and transporting Drinker Respirators all the way from America was so high that the South Australian Health Department asked biomedical engineer Edward Both to come up with a cheaper alternative.\n\nThe Both respirator was made of plywood. It was not only cheap, but also easier to construct and transport. In some cases, the Both was in use within one hour of production. Lord Nuffield was so impressed with the Both design that he had around 1,700 machines built at his car manufacturing plant in the UK and donated them to hospitals around the world.\n\nWhat was it like for the patient?\n\nGoing into an iron lung was a bewildering process for patients, many of whom were delirious and in extreme pain.\n\nLife in an iron lung was difficult for both patient and carers. The numerous tasks involved in treating the patient included:\n\nblood transfusions\n\nintravenous glucose feeds\n\ninserting and replacing catheters\n\nand endless adjustments to the body and equipment.\n\nIn addition to medical care, itches were scratched, noses blown, hair combed, bodies washed and bedpans inserted and removed, all through the portholes as far as possible.\n\nWhen the portholes were inadequate, tasks such as physical therapy had to be completed in the few minutes that a patient could breathe on their own outside the iron lung.\n\nOne of the biggest problems for patients was boredom. A mirror could be attached above the patient’s head, so they could see what was happening around them. They could also read books suspended in front of their faces if someone turned the pages for them.\n\nIn larger iron lung wards they had other patients nearby to provide companionship and psychological support but visiting hours for family were limited.\n\nUsing dolls in polio rehabilitation\n\nPolio particularly affected young children, and it was especially difficult for them to understand what was happening to them. Lord Mayor Treloar Hospital in Hampshire specialised in the treatment of children affected by tuberculosis and polio. They used dolls to explain what would happen to them during treatment.\n\nMost patients only used the iron lung for a few weeks or months depending on the severity of the polio attack, but those left with their chest muscles permanently paralysed by the disease faced a lifetime of confinement. ​​​​​​\n\nTherapists used several techniques to help patients regain strength in their chest muscles. By slowly extending the time outside the cabinet the patient could gradually build up the muscles to the point where they could spend most of the day outside the iron lung, returning to it at night to give tired bodies time to rest.\n\nThe technique sounds straightforward, but in practice learning to breathe again was a difficult and frightening process, as one patient, Kenneth Kingery recalled:\n\nI’d have to strain my every fibre for a breath of air. And there was always a helpless terror – wondering whether they’d close the tank in time.\n\nAs chest muscle strength returned some patients were transferred to rocking beds, which used gravity to help with breathing. As the head of the bed tilted upwards, gravity pulled the internal organs downwards, drawing air into the lungs. When it tilted the other way, gravity pushed the internal organs up on to the diaphragm, pushing air out of the lungs."
