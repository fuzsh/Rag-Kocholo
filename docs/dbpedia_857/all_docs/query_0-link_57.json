        "text": "Common paediatric conditions we treat\n\nGeneral paediatric surgery\n\nGeneral paediatric surgery is the surgical management of children with relatively common, non-specialised conditions. Children are often referred to a general surgeon if they are suffering on an ongoing basis, for example, from one or more of these symptoms: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, heartburn, swelling of the abdomen, abnormally sized testes or swelling in the area, vomiting blood or passing blood in the stools or jaundice.\n\nOur general paediatric surgeons offer minimally invasive (keyhole) surgery. Often general paediatric surgery is minor surgery, carried out on a day-case basis and children are discharged the same day. Common general paediatric surgical procedures performed at Ramsay Health Care UK hospitals, for example, include: removal of lumps and bumps, hernias, hydroceles, undescended testicles, and circumcisions (for medical reasons).\n\nA wider team of specialists including urologists and ENT consultants offer support for children with more complex disorders and our general surgeons may work with them or refer on for more specialised paediatric conditions.\n\nPaediatric ENT\n\nPaediatric ENT, also known as paediatric otolaryngology, is the study of ear, nose and throat diseases in children. Areas of the ear, nose and throat include: the sinuses, the larynx (voice box), the oral cavity, the upper pharynx (mouth and throat), and other structures of the neck and face. Our ENT consultants have extensive ENT experience in the care of children and teenagers ranging from the straight forward elective insertion of grommets for hearing loss to complex diagnosis and management of airway disorders.\n\nWe offer regular outpatient ENT clinics to assess and discuss a child’s ear, nose or throat problem. Children's ENT conditions we regularly treat include: hearing loss, ear infections and glue ear, recurrent tonsillitis, nose and sinus infections and complex neck, airway and ear conditions. Often these problems can be managed without surgery. However, surgery may be necessary and the surgeries we commonly perform include: tonsillectomy for tonsil problems such as recurrent tonsillitis and obstructive sleep apnoea, adenoidectomy for blocked noses and snoring caused by the adenoids and, grommets for hearing problems and recurrent ear infections related to glue ear.\n\nPaediatric urology\n\nPaediatric urology is concerned with the urinary system in both boys and girls and boy’s genital organs. We diagnose and treat children with simple and complex urological disorders. Initially child patients and their parents are seen in an outpatient setting to determine the problem and undergo any investigative tests required.\n\nCommon problems include: bed wetting, undescended testicles, foreskin problems and circumcision, hernia, hydrocele (swelling of the scrotum caused by fluid) and urine infections.\n\nOur consultant urologists have specialised knowledge and experience in the diagnosis and treatment of urological conditions in children and teenagers. They work as part of a multidisciplinary team of general paediatric surgeons, anaesthetists, nephrologists, radiologists, respiratory specialists, dietitians, gastroenterologists and nurses.\n\nGeneral medicine\n\nOur general medicine service treats children with a wide range of common childhood problems including: headaches, fever, pneumonia, infections, allergies and asthma, bedwetting, diarrhoea, constipation, abdominal pain, reflux, urinary tract infection and behavioural issues.\n\nOur general paediatric medical consultants run an outpatient service for children who require general paediatric consultations and investigations including pathology, biochemistry and scans. They will refer on to fellow specialists who have a special interest in specific areas for children with more complex conditions.\n\nBooking an appointment\n\nRevised policy for paediatric appointments.\n\nFor patients under the age of 18 it is now mandatory that Springfield Hospital are in receipt of a GP referral prior to an appointment being booked."
