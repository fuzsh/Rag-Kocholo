We teach undergraduate students at many other campuses within New South Wales. We are very fortunate to have strong partnerships with many health districts such as Sydney Children’s Hospitals Network, South Eastern Sydney, South Western Sydney, Murrumbidgee and Albury Wodonga Local Health Districts.\n\nWe have over 200 conjoint and adjunct staff affiliated with the discipline and work in close partnership with Children’s Cancer Institute Australia.\n\nWe are one of the highest performing disciplines within the School of Clinical Medicine as reflected by our research grant income, our postgraduate students and our impact on child health.\n\nOur newly established Practical Medical Genomics course is extremely popular.\n\nWe are fortunate to work with many philanthropic agencies who help fund many of our research programs."
