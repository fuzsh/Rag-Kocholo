Following singer Sheebah Karungi’s announcement of starting her own record label known as “Karma Music UG”, Cindy Sanyu has also shared what she thinks of record labels in town and all over the world.

Cindy Sanyu who is also a queen of controversy highlighted that the reason why she defiantly declined getting signed to records labels yet several of them have approached her, is that she wants to have her freedom.

She explained that artists signed to record labels are not treated by human beings but rather as products and goods equating them sacks of salt, and mattresses among other items.

She went on to note that the contracts that have been in the past presented to her are equal to slavery which doesn’t suit her style of handling business and other aspects of life.

I haven’t subscribed or signed with any record label so far because of all the contracts they have offered me, I didn’t like them. A lot of their contracts are very equal to slavery.

The problem with labels they always want to control everything concerning an artist because they are investing their money so they want to be in control of you the same way they would be in control of a sack of salt and most of the time they never deal with you as a human being but just as a product.

For freedom, that is why I didn’t sign on with any label.

Cindy Sanyu furthermore hinted at how she doesn’t want to be owned by anybody something that record labels do reasoning that if she wants to do something, she should do it on her own and at her will without having limitations and disturbances.

A record label wants to own who you’re and I feel like I don’t want anyone to own who Cindy is. I don’t want anybody to own that. I want to own it. And if tomorrow I want to flip and do something else that should be up to me and not someone else ordering me.
