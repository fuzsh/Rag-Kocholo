        "text": "Interested in starting your own entrepreneurial journey but unsure what to expect? Then read up on our interview with Sanyu Estelle, a Soothsayer, Writer, and Artist, based in Santa Monica, CA, USA.\n\nWhat's your business, and who are your customers?\n\nMy business is soothsaying, writing, orating, and explaining things to people about existential matters, spiritual matters, etc. My customers are people who want to check in with themselves about life-at-large and their life but through the reflection of a Soothsayer.\n\nTell us about yourself\n\nA Soothsayer is, directly put, a truth-teller. As a child, this often got me in trouble, particularly outside my home. In adulthood, this allows me to be a purposeful embodiment of reflection for others. Soothing is how information comes to me. The mediums I use are channeling (written and oratory), cards (tarot, oracle, or even playing cards), dreams, and my personal experience.\n\nI have been writing down my dreams since elementary school because being in a dream told me to do so. That practice allowed me to consider and remember that things are seldom just as they appear and that information can come to us in all ways. I am also a writer and have had extensive experience doing performance poetry, public speaking, and communicating through narrative.\n\nI find that relating through Existence is the most connective thread there is. I enjoy getting to know life through my experiences and getting to know others. I am motivated by life itself.\n\nWhat's your biggest accomplishment as a business owner?\n\nNext month I'm speaking at MOCA on a panel about Witches and Witch Hunters. Participating in a 3-day trade show with Brand Assembly as their resident card reader, performing my debut album live for the first time at Coaxial Arts Foundation, and hosting an event at Soho Warehouse.\n\nEvery month and every year, I am able to create new relationships and opportunities by being interested in people and reflecting back to them my understanding of them clearly. In truth, I feel that my biggest accomplishments are still in front of me.\n\nWhat's one of the hardest things that come with being a business owner?\n\nCreating a schedule that evolves with you as you grow into yourself. Knowing when and how to change the course of what you're doing and/or who you're doing it with. Trusting yourself to be reliant on yourself even though you do this regardless of what happens. Allowing yourself to just exist without making it a moral dilemma about deserving to exist. Doing something for the love of the thing itself.\n\nWhat are the top tips you'd give to anyone looking to start, run and grow a business today?\n\nAlways do what you love, whether it makes you money or not. If you do things because you love to do them, they are their own reward. Then that opens you up to all kinds of opportunities that stem from a healthy, loving relationship.\n\nYou can have more than one job or desire. I think it's about seasons and right timing more than anything else. The future is multidimensional and intentional. It can be both.\n\nExistence affirms us through positive synchronicity, allows us through neutral synchronicity, and denies us through negative synchronicity. When you engage with life by pursuing your passions and making choices, allow yourself to begin to notice the \"Polarity Patterns\" (positives, neutrals, negatives) that you are getting from Existence.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to share?\n\nI'm available for readings with cards and sessions without cards through my website articles and social media. If what I shared has resonated with you, please don't hesitate to contact me!\n\nWhere can people find you and your business?\n\nWebsite: https://www.sanyuestelle.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100063863648469\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/sanyuestelle/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sanyuestelle\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanyuestelle/\n\nIf you like what you've read here and have your own story as a solo or small business entrepreneur that you'd like to share, then please answer these interview questions. We'd love to feature your journey on these pages."
