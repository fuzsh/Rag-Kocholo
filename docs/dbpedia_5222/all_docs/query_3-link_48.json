        "text": "The Sanyu Babies Home was started by a missionary, sister Milnes Walker. Milnes was working at a local hospital where many babies were abandoned after birth. There are over 2.3 million known orphans in Uganda, more than any other nation in the world today. Many children are found abandoned in garbage heaps, pit latrines, ditches, taxi parks or are left by the side of the road.\n\nThe Sanyu Babies Home provides a safe haven for up to 40 abandoned children. The home is dedicated to providing these children with love, security, medical care and education. The Home actively looks to find foster parents, to place the child back into a family. Failure to find new foster parents will mean the child will stay at the Home until 4-years old when they will be transferred to another orphanage."
