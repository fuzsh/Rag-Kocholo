        "text": "Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | Rachel Esther Sanyu, a Pharmacology and Toxicology student from Kampala, Uganda, has been included in the top 50 shortlist for the Chegg.org Global Student Prize 2024, an annual $100,000 award to be given to one exceptional student who has made a real impact on learning, the lives of their peers and on society beyond.\n\nRachel Esther Sanyu was selected from over 11,000 nominations and applications from 176 countries. The award, now in its fourth year, recognizes extraordinary achievements of young change-makers from around the world\n\nChegg.org partnered with the Varkey Foundation to launch the annual Global Student Prize in 2021, a sister award to its $1 million Global Teacher Prize. The intention was to create a powerful new platform that shines a light on the efforts of extraordinary students everywhere who, together, are reshaping our world for the better.\n\nThe prize is open to all students who are at least 16 years old and enrolled in an academic institution or training and skills program. Part-time students as well as students enrolled in online courses are also eligible for the prize.\n\nRachel Esther Sanyu’s journey from Uganda to the US exemplifies resilience and commitment. Raised in a community that valued unity and empathy from its Ubuntu philosophy, she was inspired to tackle cancer treatment accessibility issues after shadowing at the Uganda Cancer Institute.\n\nAt the University at Buffalo – SUNY, New York, Rachel, 23, excelled academically in Pharmacology and Toxicology, contributing to significant research at institutions like Roswell Park and Johnson & Johnson. Her leadership extended to cultural promotion through dance and mentoring, impacting peers and advocating for inclusivity. Committed to community service, Rachel founded initiatives like Suubi Cancer Relief and MedREACH, aiming to revolutionize global healthcare collaboration and improve patient outcomes.\n\nUgandan students have a history of excelling in the Chegg.org Global Student Prize.\n\nErikan Baluku, then a 25-year-old student from Kampala, Uganda, taking a master’s in Molecular and Cell Biology at the University of Cape Town, South Africa, was included in the top 50 shortlist for the Chegg.org Global Student Prize 2022. Alex Kyabarango, then a 24-year-old Veterinary Studies student at Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda, was included in the top 50 shortlist for the Chegg.org Global Student Prize 2021.\n\nHeather Hatlo Porter, Chegg’s Chief Communications Officer, said: “Huge congratulations to Rachel Esther Sanyu. Chegg not only celebrates your achievements but also the endless possibilities that exist when young minds are driven by a passion for change. The top 50 Global Student Prize finalists deserve the opportunity to have their stories told and have their voices heard. After all, it is their dreams, insights and ingenuity that will illuminate a more hopeful future for everyone.”\n\n“Our finalists this year have made a huge impact in areas from the environment to equality and justice, from health and wellbeing to education and skills, from youth empowerment to ending poverty. I can’t wait to see how this year’s inspiring cohort of changemakers use this platform to lift up even more lives.”\n\nSunny Varkey, Founder of the Varkey Foundation, said: “Rachel Esther Sanyu’s story is a testament to the crucial role that education plays in building a better world for us all. As time runs out to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, it is more important than ever to prioritize education so we can face the future with confidence.”\n\nApplications and nominations for this year’s Global Student Prize opened on Thursday 1 February and closed on Sunday 5 May. Students are being assessed on their academic achievement, impact on their peers, how they make a difference in their community and beyond, how they overcome the odds to achieve, how they demonstrate creativity and innovation, and how they operate as global citizens.\n\nLast year’s winner was 24-year-old South Sudanese refugee Nhial Deng, who empowered over 20,000 refugees in the Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya through peacebuilding, education, and entrepreneurship programmes, as well as creating a safe space for young people to heal from their trauma. He was selected as the winner of the 2023 Chegg.org Global Student Prize from almost 4,000 nominations and applications from 122 countries around the world. Nhial accepted his award in New York during UN General Assembly week.\n\nThe top 10 finalists of the Global Student Prize are expected to be announced in September this year. The winner, who is expected to be announced later in the year, will be chosen from the top 10 finalists by the Global Student Prize Academy, made up of prominent individuals."
