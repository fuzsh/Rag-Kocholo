        "text": "A floral still life painting by Chinese-French modernist Sanyu from the 1950s will be offered at Christie’s in a modern and contemporary art auction in Hong Kong on May 24. Titled Potted Chrysanthemums, the work will be on public display in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Bejing, and Taipei ahead of the sale.\n\nThe painting, which depicts a set of pink chrysanthemums stemming from blue branches, one of Sanyu’s signature motifs, is estimated to sell for HKD 78 million–HKD 120 million ($11 million–$15 million). According to Christie’s statement on the sale, it is one of the few late-period still lifes by Sanyu remaining in private hands.\n\nFor years, Sanyu and his French-Chinese postwar counterpart Zao Wou-Ki have led the market share for the marquee Hong Kong auctions. In December, a rare goldfish still life by Sanyu, painted during the 1930s–’40s and formerly held by Taiwanese billionaire Pierre Chen, sold for $22 million. The result aligns with the modernist’s market ascent over the past decade, seeing values appreciate by staggering margins since the early-mid 2000s. In the same season, Sanyu’s floral still-life from the same era sold for $17.8 million, surpassing its low estimate of HKD 68 million ($8.8 million)."
