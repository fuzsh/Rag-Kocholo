        "text": "A reflection of my 7 months in Uganda:\n\nIn August, 2019, I set out for Entebbe, Uganda as an English Language Fellow with The US Department of State. I remember telling my husband, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm definitely not leaving early. I‚Äôll make it all 10 months‚Äù. Fast forward seven months to a global pandemic. On a Friday morning, I got the notification that fellows were being sent home due to travel restrictions and the growing health risk around the world. I would be leaving Uganda & my fellowship would end on the following Tuesday. That gave me four days to pack, wrap-up my work, say goodbye, and try to process. I was able to do those first three, but it took a long time to process (maybe I still am).\n\nAt work at Nkumba University, my colleagues gave me a local name: Sanyu. Sanyu is ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù and ‚Äújoy‚Äù in Luganda. Not only was it an honor to be given a Lugandan name, it was a privilege to be given such a sweet and positive name. A secretary told me it‚Äôs because I smiled everyday and greeted them. It‚Äôs easy for me to wonder what I could have done with 3 more months or question if my fellowship was successful. But, I try to focus on ‚ÄúSanyu‚Äù: I was able to be part of a community.\n\nSo with joy, I list the things I was able to do rather than focus on what I didn‚Äôt get to finish:\n\nLed seven presentations / workshops\n\nOrganized an education conference at the university with teachers from seven local schools in attendance.\n\nTaught classes in the School of Education\n\nHelped facilitate the donation of books to Nkumba University English department and a local elementary school\n\nCreated instructional materials\n\nTraveled to Tanzania\n\nTraveled to Senegal\n\nVisited and hung out in airports in Ethiopia and Togo (this counts and both have stories!)\n\nVisited two national parks in Uganda\n\nWent gorilla trekking!\n\nVisited an island on Lake Victoria that was a reserve for chimpanzees\n\nLearned about local fabric, clothing, and visited ethical labor shops\n\nRaised $1100 for Dressember wearing local, Ugandan dresses\n\nLearned some Luganda and tried to greet everyone haha\n\nTraveled to a friend‚Äôs village and stayed with their family for a couple nights. One of my favorite experiences!\n\nLearned a lot about myself and grew as a teacher so much!\n\nMade some really great friends and relationships!\n\nHalf-way through my fellowship, but program asked me to make this video of my professional and personal life. I‚Äôve added it here if you‚Äôd like to take a look: click here.\n\nI can‚Äôt end this without saying a huge THANK YOU. So many of you supported me through this whole journey. I‚Äôm so thankful.\n\nWhat‚Äôs next? I have no idea, but I‚Äôm ready üôÇ"
