        "text": "Prompted by growth in the Asian art market in the past year, Sotheby’s has unveiled plans to stage a curated five-lot auction titled “ICONS: Masterpieces from Across Time and Space,” which will featuring paintings by Pablo Picasso, Alberto Giacometti, Sanyu, and Zhang Daquian, as well as a Song Dynasty Bodhisattva sculpture from the 11th century. Scheduled to take place on April 18 at Sotheby’s Hong Kong gallery at One Pacific Place, just before Sotheby’s modern art evening sale, the auction is expected to achieve a collective $38 million.\n\nThis spring season is part of the house’s grandest sales series in the region to date, with 2,500 lots ranging from antiquities to contemporary art set to be offered across 14 sales from April 16–23. Together, they are expected to bring in at least $417 million. Evening sales devoted to modern and contemporary art featuring works by Clyfford Still, Yoshitomo Nara, Zao Wou-Ki, and Che Tu Chin will be held on April 18 and 19.\n\nOver the past year, Sotheby’s has staged several live-streamed themed evening sales with offerings spanning Old Masters to contemporary art across its New York, London, and Paris sale centers. This is the first time that a fully curated auction of this caliber—one featuring both Western and Asian artists—will be held in Asia."
