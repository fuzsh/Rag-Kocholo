        "text": "How fluent is your Kiswahili?\n\nIt’s alright; I can get by if I need to speak it.\n\nWhen are you most forced to speak Kiswahili?\n\nWhen I’m in Kenya and Tanzania, but TZ’s really hard. But I understand Kenyan Kiswahili because I kind of speak it, although we don’t talk the same way.\n\nYou are now signed to Grandpa Records; what’s so attractive about it that you decided to be part of the label?\n\nI’ve been in touch with Refigah before as a friend and we worked together but not directly. I saw his work ethic; he knows people and understands the industry. I always wanted to work with someone on the ground because it’s different when people in another country hear your music but your presence is not really felt. That’s why I came here in January to network. We had discussions over email and when I came here I got to see how they work as Grandpa Records and I liked it.\n\nWhat do you think of the Grandpa artistes?\n\nI have already worked with Dufla and I met Visita in the studio. I liked everything about it.\n\nWhy tour Kenya?\n\nThe fans in Kenya reach out to me more in East Africa on my Facebook, Instagram and Twitter pages. I get a lot of feedback; people asking me to come and do shows and I thought it was time.\n\nWhere will you be performing?\n\nVoi, Mombasa, Nakuru and Eldoret.\n\nIs there any place you are looking forward to going?\n\nEldoret. I haven’t been there before. When the organiser told me, I thought to myself: Does anyone know me in Eldoret? (Laughs) I like challenges; I like going to places where I feel people don’t know me, and try to create a relationship and get love from them. I perform better when I feel like an up-and-coming artiste because I put more energy into it and I like the excitement.\n\nYou’re really calm in person as compared with your fierce character in videos.\n\nI’m the same person, but I call that my work mode — the Cindy in the papers is Cindy Sanyu. Then there’s Ella, (my real name is Cinderella); when I’m not on stage it’s just Ella.\n\nWhat fairytales are you living?\n\nIn a way I have learnt to lie to myself that everything is okay because life can sometimes be so black; you have to keep a positive attitude.\n\nWhat don’t you miss about being an up-and-coming artiste?\n\nNot knowing what is going on at all. As an up-and-coming artiste you have no idea who to trust and you have no gameplan. That’s the thing actually, having no gameplan. That insecurity is what I don’t miss. But I liked the excitement, that courage — like you have to make it work because when you are established you sort of stop doing that and it becomes normal and boring at a certain point.\n\nHow old are you?\n\nAs women we want to stay young and be as youthful as possible. I’m 30 years old.\n\nCan you still dance as vigorously as you used to, like back in ‘Blu 3’?\n\nI can; I go to the gym but I’ve noticed I have to be there longer than I used to. My body is slower now, so I exercise more. But there’s nothing I can’t do that I used to do when I was 17.\n\nIs there a story behind the song ‘Still Standing’ or is it directed at any particular person?\n\nNo one in particular. I’ve been in the industry for a long time and that makes me grateful, the fact that I’m still here. I’ve watched so many artistes fall off the radar so it’s an appreciation. But I’m also declaring to myself… sometimes you have to tell yourself, “I’m still here”, you know? My career began in 2005 and the bigger a celebrity you become, the more haters you have.\n\nNow that I’m 30, I feel like I can open up about stuff. It frees my spirit. I feel angry when I have to prove myself. I have written so many hits, especially in my country, and got many awards which the industry knows about but there are people who come and dispute that in the way they treat you. So that song is like therapy for me.\n\nSounds quite annoying to keep proving yourself.\n\nIf there’s one thing that’s annoying, it’s that negativity sells. It doesn’t matter how many good things you do, everybody is just waiting for that one wrong thing and that’s what will get the attention.\n\nYou have an upcoming song with Wahu. How long have you two been friends?\n\nAbout eight years. Every time I’m here, we hook up. I’ve always wanted to work with her but the timing has never been right. As a young talent you can’t really work with a big artiste because sometimes it can end up working against you. But now it just seemed perfect.\n\nWhen is the song coming out?\n\nIn a few weeks, the video too.\n\nHave you ever had a wardrobe malfunction on stage?\n\nYes, a couple. My stockings always get torn even though I buy new ones for every show. Somehow my nails will scratch them or because of all the dancing they will tear. The stockings aren’t really a problem, the problem is when my zippers open and I can’t stop the show. But because of the stockings, you can’t really see anything.\n\nWhich one is the most memorable?\n\nWhen my wig fell off. It was in the afternoon at 3pm at a stadium. I went to talk to the DJ about the next song, when I bent down my wig latched onto some nob and, as I walked away, it fell. It was really bad. I had one second to choose whether to pick the wig or keep dancing. I decided to dance.\n\nThere’s this assumption that you were married to your ex, Mario Brunetti...\n\nWe were never married. I really wanted us to get married, especially after five years of living together and having a baby. I thought it would lead somewhere and I spoke to him about it, but he made it clear that marriage is not his thing. I want to get married at least once in my lifetime. I’m Cinderella, the prince needs to come and sweep me off my feet. So I decided I wasn’t going to be someone’s girlfriend forever. I left.\n\nHow long had you been together?\n\nTen years! I knew his parents and they knew me. He would address me as his wife, especially when with men he felt insecure around. I thought it would naturally lead there and when it didn’t, I was disappointed. It took me about three years to leave. And when you have a baby it’s even harder, you can’t really tell the baby: “Daddy and mummy don’t like each other any more”. (Laughs)\n\nWhat do you like about being single?\n\nThe freedom that comes with work; I don’t have to spend time on anyone, I can concentrate on my work and I can meet my associates any time and anywhere. But when you have a boyfriend…\n\nIs the club your sanctuary, where you go to let off your troubles?\n\nBefore I started singing, I used to love going to the club and dancing my insecurities away. For me, the club is like going to church in a way. I let go off my stress the same way I would go to church and sing and praise and jump around.\n\nWhat insecurities do you have?\n\nI don’t want to talk about them because you are going to start looking at them. (Laughs)\n\nAt least share one\n\nI want to have a bigger butt. For a while, the papers used to refer to me as “Bumless Cindy”. They made me insecure that on stage I wouldn’t want to turn around to dance. But when you grow up, you slowly let go of small things, though I still wish I had a bigger butt. Certain things would be defined well. (Laughs)"
