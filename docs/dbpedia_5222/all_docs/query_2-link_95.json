        "text": "You have probably heard about Femme Forte, a Ugandan initiative that prides in loving women and believing in their advancement in the economic, social and political sphere. The organization strengthens the pathways between young and older women who aspire to meaningfully contribute to the greater women’s movement in Uganda.\n\nToday, we bring you an up-close insight into what the organization is really about through the eyes of the Chief Executive Officer and Founder — Sanyu Penelope.\n\nWho is Sanyu Penelope?\n\nWho is she not? (hahahahaha) sorry I love to laugh, it heals my soul and I have been told i have a beautiful smile, wink (hahahaha ) For as long as I can remember I have been referred to as “Penny”. People say its short and sweet, I think it’s because many people cannot pronounce Penelope right (PS: don’t tell anyone, it’s our secret)\n\nI cannot define Penny without mentioning purpose. My purpose is to inspire and equip as many young women to become fearless influencers living in their fullest potential. Sanyu is a happy girl with big dreams of influencing the world by sharing her gifts. She is a feminist, a lover, an author, a loyal friend, a cheerful giver, and an intentional Christian.\n\nWhat is the story of Femme Forte?\n\nOurs is a story of love, sisterhood, and space. We started in the living rooms and boardrooms of fierce and bold women who dared to listen and believe in a dream that was so much bigger than the people that carried it. Our currency of trade is LOVE, nothing less and nothing more.\n\nWe are a feminist movement building organization that fiercely promotes, demands, and protects the rights and well-being of young women; mostly those who are excluded, marginalized and exploited for being women and living in both the urban and rural areas of Uganda.\n\nOur work is grounded by the desire to strengthen young women’s leadership, organize them, and increase their capacity to participate in national politics, enhance their ability to understand money and how national resources are allocated, (gender budgets).\n\nHow do you bring this vision to life?\n\nWe do this through extensive communication, ensuring their well-being and that of their movements and the environment through self-care and celebration.\n\nIn March 2017, we set out to do several consultations, research, dialogue, and negotiations on what kind of organization young women wanted to be a part of. Femme Forte was founded four months later and shaped by the insights of many especially young women whose voices and ambitions have guided us and will continue to play a central role as we move forward.\n\nYoung women made it clear that they wanted to drive the change, to be more than just our faces; they told us their input is critical in the development of programs, policies, and decisions that affect them. Above all, they are demanding the right to dream, they want the right of way and they demand the future.\n\nWe in many ways provide sisterhood among other things by listening to the women who seek to be listened to.\n\nWe nurture as we mentor young women on journeys of growth.\n\nWe refer for collaborative support where cases may need specialized attention\n\nWe celebrate the journeys of women as they tell their story\n\nWe engage with uncharted territory that young women occupy e.g. young women in the public sector, young women in sport, young invisible laborers.\n\nWe create safe and brave spaces for young women to think, strategize, commune and also have fun while at it. We create spaces where young women can thrive.\n\nWe contribute to different movements and create synergies with already existing movements because of the constituency we hold.\n\nWe build capacity and tell stories.\n\nWe create soulful spaces for healing and wellness\n\nWhat is your message?\n\nThe barriers can and will be broken, new heights achieved for women!\n\nHow you are able to sustain the work do?\n\n- A phenomenally committed team\n\n- Private sector Connections through apps like Eversend\n\nLocal and international Philanthropy\n\n- Development Partners\n\n⁃ Our friends, and women who keep giving us their time and immeasurable support through presence\n\nHow have you managed to push through the COVID situation and keep going?\n\n- Alternative framing of programs eg online engagements\n\n- Constant checking in through use of phone calls and sms\n\n- Visits to some women who need physical presence\n\n- Referrals to people with more resources to support the women we are unable to.\n\n⁃ Focus on the bigger picture which keeps us grounded\n\nAny challenges you face as an organization?\n\n-Costs of online and remote engagement are high-\n\n⁃ Interventions are limited because not all our women from the informal sector are tech savvy\n\n- Our constituency is financially challenged and so data has become a privilege many can’t afford.\n\n- Movement to see those that need support\n\n- Rethinking the future\n\nAccomplishments/ Achievements to celebrate thus far\n\n- We have followed up and supported more 8 young women in this season who are survivors of abuse\n\n⁃ We have walked a journey with teen girls on understanding and dealing with periods / menstrual flow\n\n- referred several women to therapy and they have been helped\n\n- equipped young women with lessons on how to take care of their mental wellbeing in this season\n\n- Equipped women with information on finances during the COVID season\n\n-Written a number of think pieces on various issues affecting young women in this period\n\n-We have been and still are present for our sisters\n\nWhat kind of Impact do you hope to make on the world?\n\nUltimately we work towards a balanced society for both men and women economically, socially and politically by creating a movement of young women who impact society"
