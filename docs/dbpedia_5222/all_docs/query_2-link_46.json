        "text": "I walked up the stairs from the gates of the Sanyu Babies’ Home half expecting to see babies running up and down, or at least a microphone to guide me where the function was at but heard nothing. Only silence and a sign asking me to take another set of stairs to the reception welcomed me.\n\nThe little gathering under the tree and in the sandpit wasn’t quite what I was looking for and was almost walking on, when I noticed my colleague, the photographer. Apparently this was it, Joeria Butele’s way of marking yet another year.\n\nA low key event, flanked by her immediate family and a few friends on simple chairs, and wrapped packages on a mat at their feet. The babies sat around, with their minders and about ten or so volunteers. I notice the volunteers are all white and that the mothers or mama’s (as the ladies in green who take care of the children are called) keep a keen eye on all the little ones and know them by name.\n\nMy editor had heard of a woman who was celebrating her birthday at the babies home, and had sent me to check it out see what it was all about. I therefore had a mental picture of what to expect, fanfare, streamers, a lot of excited toddlers running around and the Ugandan birthday party staples; music and drinks.\n\nWhile Butele, a wife and mother of three, introduces her family members, I walk over to where the mothers are seated and do my best to blend in. I smile and say I am fine when they offer to get a chair for me, probably taking me for the fussy, proud type because of my dressing.\n\nMy shorts and stripped sweater are casual enough but I suddenly feel my handbag is too dressy, probably too much for this occasion. Still they are an easy going crowd and they banter a little about their job, in hushed tones of course because the birthday girl is still talking.\n\nOne baby wants to stand and walk around and decides to use me as support, then abandons the idea and decides to instead give me his teddy bear. “He likes visitors” says a boy of about twenty who then lifts the baby and disappears into the building. I notice that most of the children look very comfortable with the volunteers. One Maama tells me many of the volunteers come at least once a week; others come once never to be seen again. “Some afternoons we have people coming to make donations or spend time with the children,” she says.\n\nI remember my sister’s one-year-old who goes into a screaming fit if he is held by a stranger and marvel at how these innocent babies will stretch their arms to anyone who wants to hold them. How they snuggle close like they have known these strangers all their lives. I wonder for a minute if God has made their little minds wise enough to know and accept love from wherever they can get it.\n\nAnother maama tells me the baby names, David, Erick…or is it Dan? I can’t keep up, over forty babies, too many names. She tells me she knows who the fussy eater is, who can sleep through an earthquake and who wakes at the slightest sound. “We spend all our time with them, we know them,” she says then goes off to pick a little boy who has reached the packages on the mat and is trying to tear one open.\n\nWhere do you get the babies from? I ask. Maama cocks her head, lets out a long sigh and says “everywhere, from dumpsites to empty houses”. “Even toilets,” volunteers another mother.\n\n“The children are adopted, as they grow or reunited with their families and new ones are rescued from the streets,” says Barbra Nankya Mutagubya, the administrator of Sanyu Babies’ Home. I can’t bear to think in what condition some of these children are found, or even how they may have spent nights in the cold crying themselves hoarse.\n\nMs. Butele is now cutting the cake, inviting the mothers and some of the children. The elder two of her three children, Vanessa and Angel pass out cake portions. I watch as one little girl, about one and a half years old feeds herself cake, most of it crumbling to the mat around. She won’t let anyone touch her cake, and struggles with it morsel after morsel.\n\nWant to hold? A maama asks me. The kindly looking woman must have noticed me admiring the light skinned bundle of joy she was holding from a distance. He is asleep and so little I am afraid I will crush him but he doesn’t even move when they place him in my arms. I hold him closer and he snuggles.\n\nHis name is Erias; she says and goes into the building. I am left holding little Erias, wondering why anyone would opt to abandon this precious child. He is so pretty he could have been a girl. I see others, healthy good looking babies, active and curious like all toddlers are, all once abandoned somewhere or left for the dead.\n\nThe children call Nankya maama. She is seeing to it that the supplies which Butele brought are taken inside and some little ones want to help. She gives them light loads like pamper packets and powder bottles to take and they do feeling important and useful. They are happy children. This is their home, she says.\n\nButele says she knew what to buy because she is a mother. Her youngest son is about four. “There are practical things like diapers, baby oil, Vaseline, and milk, that anyone with a child can’t have too much of. The home has a lot of babies they will never stop needing these things,” she says.\n\nShe only thought of spending her birthday at the children’s home about a week before when friends asked her what she wanted for her birthday. She couldn’t think of anything, instead she asked her friends to buy baby supplies instead of giving her birthday cards or presents. Between us we raised Shs1.2m with which I bought these supplies.\n\nThe little group is now scattering, and my photographer wants to leave. I hesitate to hand over Erias who is till sleeping soundly in my arms. He looks so angelic in his sleep, so confident that he is in caring arms. But I really have to go. I ask Butele’s daughter Vanessa to get me someone to take the baby. She admires the baby and I mention how I wish I could take him. Why don’t you?\n\nHe needs a family and love. She says with the innocence only a pre-teen can have. I don’t know how to tell her it is not that simple. She looks at me expectant, I say maybe one day then ask her to run along.\n\nThe baby fusses a little when I hand him over. Maybe I wasn’t the only one getting comfortable. As I rush to catch up with my photographer, I am stopped by someone calling maama! I look around I am the only one on that path, a little boy, not more than two years old is sitting astride a toy truck calling me maama. He is pointing at the ground and saying something fell and I stop to help him look for it.\n\nI can’t for the life of me figure out exactly what it is he is saying or what it has to do with where he is pointing. So I tell him he will be fine, and push him along on his little truck. Now I really have to leave, so I say ‘bye sweetie’ and start running to the gate. He is still saying bye mama, probably waving I don’t see, I do my best not to look in case the little hand waving goodbye melts my heart and I cry, or delay further.\n\nI had gone prepared to witness, an all-out party at a children’s home, instead I got several special moments that touched me to the core. I still remember Erias sleeping peacefully in my arms, oblivious to the world around him.\n\nThe image of the little troopers carrying bundles of baby products, to the building will also stick in my head a long time. But the joy on Butele’s face will stick longest, the satisfaction she said she felt for spending her birthday that way. Got me thinking about doing something other than count presents on my own birthday."
