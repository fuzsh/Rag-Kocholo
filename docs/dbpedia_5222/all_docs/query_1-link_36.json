        "text": "Way back from the days of Coca Cola Pop Stars, I was such a huge fan of Blu3. I have to be honest and confess that I was among those that anticipated their downfall when they kicked Cindy out of the group. But Cindy went on and did her own thing as a solo artist, with hit after hit and a refreshing sound that only she could provide. Then I wasn’t so mad for her not being a part of the group anymore.\n\nBlu3 cast a new member to the group who served the purpose of completing the trio, but not with any form of musical contribution to it. They surprisingly continued to do extremely well until their separation. Jackie and Lilian pursued solo careers that were worth talking about, but no one really ever caught up with Cindy. Cindy was like the Beyonce of the group- with the greatest success long after the group had broken up. Based off all that you’ve probably already figured that I am a Cindy Sanyu fan.\n\nThese past 2 years have had Sheebah Karungi and Vinka take over as Uganda’s leading female acts while Cindy has been quiet, only releasing songs every so often. And that’s OK. It happens to the best of us. If you’re wise you use that time to reflect, study the industry, re-strategize and come back stronger. Besides the point. Cindy recently did an interview at Uganda’s UBC, where she claimed that every trending female artist that there is in Uganda has their songs written for them, are under music labels that offer funding and are therefore always told what to do, making them dummies. Cindy talked about wanting a battle with Sheebah but apparently, according to her (Cindy), Sheebah wasn’t ready for it. I was rolling my eyes so much through the entire interview I could see the back of my own head.\n\nIf you read my posts, then you know that I am a strong advocate for confidence in yourself as an artist. It’s essential and will have you lasting longer in the game than the most talented artist who isn’t too sure about themselves. I however have a problem with people that are confident (or claim to be confident) but use that “confidence” to dismiss others or what they have to offer.\n\nBack in January 2017, I listed Sheebah Karungi as one of the artists to watch out for that year. 2 years down the line and she has since been crowned the Best Female Artist and Artist of the year (twice) at the HiPipo Awards.\n\nThe girl has consistently released hit after hit, you could have up to ten of her songs topping a single chart at the same damn time. Sheebah has successfully expanded her influence through collaborating with some of Africa’s top acts including Nigeria’s Solidstar, Runtown, Rwanda’s The Ben and Bruce Melodie. I could go on and on about her.\n\nSheebah may not be the most talented female artist that Uganda has but she is the most hardworking that there is, which has earned her the “best female artist in Uganda” title. (Awards or not). And just like the good old saying, “Hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard”. Is Beyonce the most talented artist that the world has? Absolutely not. She is however one of the best female artists the world has seen because of her work ethic.\n\nGranted, for a live music performance, Cindy would win hands down due to her vocal prowess. However, truth is the crowd would be watching her in awe, enjoying the performance while they would sing along to each and every word of most of Sheebah’s songs. (No shade but tell me a song by Cindy that’s currently on rotation?)\n\nCindy claims that every currently trending female artist has their songs written for them and are under music labels. Besides Vinka, I do not know of any other trending female artist signed to a music label or that has each of their songs written for them. So if it’s about Vinka, then yes, she is signed to Swangz Avenue. And yes, she does have her music written for her. But here’s the thing…..NO BODY FREAKING CARES! Vinka does amazing music, which is all music lovers are concerned about. If anything, I think they’re plenty of talented artists out there doing crappy music simply because they haven’t accepted the fact that their writing skills are lacking. What they need is a helping hand from other skilled writers while they focus their energy on what they are actually good at.\n\nVinka clearly understands the music business, which is evident in how she presents herself to the world. The girl is a superstar even before she opens her mouth to sing. She has done media tours not just in Kenya, but also in Tanzania- a Swahili speaking nation, which is rare. Ask around.\n\nLook, I am not big on music labels. Especially not in Africa. My stand hasn’t changed for those that have read my previous posts on music labels. I feel like there’s still so much that ought to be put into consideration for a mutually beneficial relationship between an artist and the label they are signed to. However, it clearly works for some artists like Vinka, who keeps releasing quality music consistently with such a strong brand built behind her name. Until that changes, I have nothing but praise for her and the team behind her. And best believe when there’s a negative, I will definitely talk about it as well.\n\nI have said this before, I will say it again. Music isn’t really a competition but a contribution. Everyone has something totally different to offer.\n\nWhen I look at Sheebah’s songs from 2014 to what she is doing now, there’s been tremendous growth. I think the only competition she is partaking in is one with herself, to be better than she was yesterday. And better she is. Don’t get me wrong, I think competition is healthy and contributes to a thriving industry. I’m a sucker for a good rap battle or artists being forced to go hard because they don’t want to loose their spot at the top. However, it should be a battle based off talent and not petty concerns such as those raised by Cindy.\n\nCindy has been in the game for quite sometime and I have great respect for her maintaining relevance for such a long period of time. She should however keep working hard, let her work speak for itself than going on national TV trying to pull others down (who are babies in the industry btw).\n\nThe end of my rant!\n\nDo have yourself a lovely day, will you?"
