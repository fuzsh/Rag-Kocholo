        "text": "As I meet Penelope, I am struck by her radiant smile and contagious laugh – it's easy to understand why she feels this way about her name. She is the founder and CEO of Femme Forte Uganda (not a fan of titles, she doesn't even like to say 'manage,' instead she humbly says \"I steward them\"), one of nine national partners in the Global Affairs-funded, Oxfam Canada-implemented Stand Up for SRHR project in Uganda, Mozambique, and Canada.\n\nFemme Forte is working with vulnerable and diverse adolescent girls and young women in Uganda to raise their awareness of and demand for quality, rights-based sexual and reproductive health.\n\nPenelope wears many hats – lawyer, activist, published writer, and YouTuber. But more than anything, she is a convener.\n\n\"The desire and the need were very high for a space that is safe enough, that will hold our tears, that will hold our discomforts, that will hold our pain, and also that will hold our joys and celebration in a way that is non-judgmental,\" she recalls about the founding of the now five-year-old organization, \"and that is how Femme Forte came to life.\"\n\nThis year, in honour of International Women's Day, we are celebrating the power of feminist movements – a movement which Penelope proudly leads with a nurturing love.\n\nSRHR Saves Lives\n\nYoung women and adolescent girls in Uganda face persistent challenges ranging from inequitable gender and social norms, as well as traditional practices and taboos regarding their sexuality that negatively impact their health and status.\n\n\"I think that one of the biggest struggles in Uganda healthcare [is that] most people don't have medical insurance, most people do not have access to SRHR services,\" explains Penelope.\n\nThese barriers translate into low use of contraceptives, high unmet needs for family planning, and high rates of teen pregnancy. Maternal mortality is prevalent, and unsafe abortion is a leading cause of hospitalization and maternal death in the project’s targeted communities. Through the work of the Stand Up for SRHR project and its partners, solutions are being found and implemented to provide SRHR services."
