If it's so true, if it's so cool Why are you on my line then? If it's so new, if it's so you Will you be satisfied when? If it's so true, if it's so cool All your needs are provided. If it's so new, if it's so you Why aren't you more excited? I Just want my equal share That's not how it appears That's not how it appears I Just want you to play fair That's not what you want to hear Not what you want to hear I say I don't I say I do Truth is I'm undecided It's not quite right But nothing's wrong When you are here beside me Enjoy our romps Respect our taunts But love goes unprovided Can't say I won't Ain't no reason 'Cept this LASH on my mind and I Just want my equal share That's not how it appears That's not how it appears I Just want you to play fair That's not what you want to hear Not what you want to hear I Just want my equal share That's not how it appears That's not how it appears I Just want you to play fair That's not what you want to hear Not what you want to hear I just want, I just want I just want my equal I just want, I just want I just want my equal I just want, I just want I just want my equal I just want, I just want I just want my equal Is it really equal? Or is this just a prequel? To how this gonna be Why are you unfair to me? Do you ever play fair? Or do you really care? 'Cause that's not how it seems Won't you say what you mean? They say it's open But I don't see What's open about it They say they coping But it's looking more Like trauma bonding They say they want But what they want It doesn't satisfy them I Just want my equal share That's not how it appears That's not how it appears I Just want you to play fair That's not what you want to hear Not what you want to hear Why aren't they in alignment? Will you be more excited? When your needs are provided Won't you let, won't you let When your needs are provided Let, let Won't you let me provide it?\n\n2.\n\nBig Talk (Interlude) 01:00\n\nUh, basically Okay, look, I know this is not \"Small talk,\" okay? It's Big Talk But, basically My point is If ****** takes that place There's no vacuum If you don't take that place Then there's a vacuum Then somebody gotta take that place So, \"better him than me\" means Glad that he's taking that place So I don't have to take that place You know what I mean? By the Domino Effect, right? By like the Butterfly Effect, okay? Like, the point is more or less Let people do the things That you don't prefer to do So that you don't end up Having to do them! You know what I mean? That's why you let your Haters hate That's why you halp! *Laughs* Halp! That's why you halp . . . This is how you help your haters win Okay, listen closely Lean, lean into the phone This is how you help your haters win Come closer You keep winning!\n\n3.\n\nAlien 03:42\n\nTouching down On an Intergalactic flight 24 hours on Earth It's gotta be tonight Beings from this planet They can't handle it Let alone catch a ride On my Spaceship You don't know who you're stepping to Do you? Lazerbeam eyesight'll cut right through you Who knew? Ain't no amount of language useful Probably about time that I tell you Baby I'm an Alien Baby I'm an Alien You wouldn't know what to do with me I'm visionary haphazardly You wanna ride You wanna ride You wanna ride But you can't take it Take it Take it You don't know who you're stepping to Do you? Lazerbeam eyesight'll cut right through you Who knew? Ain't no amount of language useful Probably about time that I tell you Baby I'm an Alien Baby I'm an Alien You wouldn't know what to do with me I'm visionary haphazardly I'm from a long, long way away To reach me you'd have to go far to play Can't guarantee that I'd let you stay For now you can be my Earthling Bae I'm from a long, long way away To reach me you'd have to go far to play Can't guarantee that I'll let you stay For now you can be my Earthling Bae Baby I'm an Alien Baby I'm an Alien You wouldn't know what to do with me I'm visionary haphazardly Baby I'm an Alien Baby I'm an Alien You wouldn't know what to do with me I'm visionary haphazardly You wanna ride You wanna ride You wanna ride You wanna ride But you can't take it But you can't Take it But you can't Take it\n\n4.\n\nThis is how I know I'm high This is how I know I'm high This is how I know I'm high This is how I know This is how I know I'm high This is how I know I'm high This is how I know I'm high High High\n\n5.\n\nHigh Stakes 03:09\n\nLucky 13 stakes Sharp or are they round? High in the heart Or placed in the ground? Won't state your claim Yet it's here to be found Low stakes courage With a high-stakes pound Not sure if you'll pull 'em up But you'll put it down Won't own that you want it But you'll hang around Hot and cold, up and down In or out Team too much for you to handle Or What you dream about? You Me Can't quite agree You Me Baby, can you feel It's high stakes Gambler met a game That he don't even know about Used to winning bets But he ain't never met this mouth Play it if you want to At least while I stick around Play me and regret it When I'm nowhere to be found Hot and cold, up and down In or out Treat me like a snitch 'Cause I'm the one You're speaking 'bout Stakes in, stakes out Hot pound, cold mouth High lust, low prowl Can't stop, Brickhouse Well are you aroused? You Me Can't seem to meet You Me Baby, can you feel It's high-stakes You Me It's high-stakes You Me It's high It's unreal Can't conceal How I feel This appeal Spin the wheel It's a steal Looks could kill For this meal Stakes in, stakes out Hot pound, cold mouth Uh oh High lust, low prowl Can't stop, Brickhouse Uh oh Stakes in, stakes out Hot pound, cold mouth Uh oh High lust, low prowl Can't stop, Brickhouse It's high stakes Stakes in, stakes out Hot pound, cold mouth It's high High lust, low prowl Can't stop, Brickhouse It's high stakes Stakes in, stakes out Hot pound, cold mouth It's high High lust, low prowl Can't stop, Brickhouse It's high stakes\n\n6.\n\nFine AF (Interlude) 00:30\n\nCute?!
