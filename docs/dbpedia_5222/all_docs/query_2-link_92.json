        "text": "Hi! My name is Sanyu Takirambudde. I'm a sophomore and a prospective French and Biochemistry major. I grew up in Princeton, NJ but moved back home to South Africa when I was 10 years old and lived there up until I decided to come to Amherst College for my freshman year. Growing up, science has always been something that excited me but my experience in the classroom during high school and here at Amherst led to a hyperawareness of the socioeconomic, gender and racial predictors that exist in regard to a student's likelihood of success in STEM. During the Amherst Uprising, I shared an experience - that has been echoed by many underrepresented students like myself - on the the immense difficulty of simply existing and, furthermore, thriving in these academic spaces. This semester, I'm excited to investigate the experiences of a diverse group of underrepresented students in order to develop proposals for concrete structural changes that can be implemented in order to alleviate the burden of being a student that currently does not fit the mold of STEM at Amherst."
