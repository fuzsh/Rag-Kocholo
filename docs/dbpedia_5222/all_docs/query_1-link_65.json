        "text": "Synne Sørgjerd\n\nLess crying, more kissing. If Phoebe Bridges had a potty mouth, Liam Gallagher was a cute girl with an attenton deficit and Chance the Rapper wasn’t rapping you would get Synne Sørgjerd, who with radical openness and good ass really wants to tell you a true story. Do you like electrical guitars? How about crass lyrical turns? Then this is the artist for you. Themes like the feeling of insufficiency and anxiety about things not ending up the way you imagined are central to her songs. The hope is that nice girls always finish first. Norway needs more bad examples and Synne Sørgjerd is happy to help.\n\nThis Daze\n\nThe young fuzzpop band This Daze, based in Trondheim, have created waves in both national and international indie-circles. The four-piece are all in their early 20s, but have since their start in 2019 already reached several milestones. They were crowned “Månedens Urørt” (Untouched of the Month) by NRK P3 in the spring of 2020, and have had several singles playlisted at the same channel since then. For their first singles they received attention from international publications such as Clash Magazine, The FADER and The Line Of Best Fit.\n\nThis Daze have also, despite the harsh aftereffects of the pandemic, played a slew of festivals like Trondheim Calling, Klubb-Øya and 12 Grader og Regn, and played shows at Blå and Parkteateret in Oslo, Hulen in Bergen, Folken in Stavanger and several other places in Norway. During the last year they have released the singles “Skiptracing”, “Cigarette Smile” and “Misconception” on Swedish label AWAL, receiving heavy rotation from NRK P3 and international attention. The Band is currently working on their debutalbum, due towards the end of the year."
