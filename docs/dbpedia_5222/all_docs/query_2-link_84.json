        "text": "“At the beginning of Covid, you could see the evolution of readers’ needs through what was selling,” said Sanyu Dillon, the chief marketing officer for Penguin Random House. It started with a rise in interactive workbooks for children, she said. Later last spring, “baking, cooking, dog training and interior design saw an increase,” she continued. Last summer “was a call for racial justice books after the murder of George Floyd” and last fall, political books were popular.\n\nThese days, she said, readers are turning to fiction.\n\nOn the weekends, Ms. Dillon shifts priorities, from marketing to motherhood. “Sunday is my day to disengage from work and errands,” said the single mother of two, whose path to parenthood had its challenges. “The natural route was not in the cards for me,” said Ms. Dillon, 51. “I adopted my son 10 years ago,” she said, from a woman who called three years later to say she was pregnant again. Ms. Dillon did not hesitate. “I had a younger sister growing up, and wanted to give that to my kids.”\n\nMs. Dillon lives with her son, Carter, 10, and her daughter, Reese, 7, in Fort Greene, Brooklyn.\n\nSTIRRING I need to wake up on my own without an alarm. We are all attuned to each other, so the household stirs around the same time. Then I do 10 minutes of Transcendental Meditation.\n\nMORE BLACK COFFEE We leave the house by 10-ish. That’s when I pick up coffee. I have a coffee machine at home, but I stop by Locals, the local coffee shop which is up the block, to support them. I love coffee. I take it black. For a long time I got coffee on the way to work. Now that I’m home full time I still get my coffee. It’s my little ritual, even during the week. It says, ‘OK, my day has started.’\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
