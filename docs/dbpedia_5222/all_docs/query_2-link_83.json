        "text": "Unbeknown to me, when I bought African Love Stories, an anthology I had purchased Monica Arac de Nyeko’s Jambula Tree. What a pleasant surprise!\n\nThe story is told in first person narrative by one of the main protagonists Anyango. This creates a strong sense of intimacy and familiarity between the reader and the speaker. As the story unfolds the reader becomes aware that the speaker, Anyango is addressing her childhood friend Sanyu. Sanyu, it is rumoured is about to return.\n\nAnyango it seems is reliving their past. What she recounts is humourous but always tinged with a little sadness at the life around them. The tale is more than a forbidden love beneath the Jambula Tree; it is also about broken hearts, forgotten dreams and the reality of poverty.\n\nMama Atim is one such tragedy. She, who is the neighbourhood gossip and the whistleblower of their love, is described to have a mouth that ‘worked at words like ants on a cob of maize.’ She spends her days waiting for her husband to bring home the bacon while she sits by idly, bleached skinned and gossiping with the many other Mama Atims on the Nakawa Housing Estate. One gets the feeling however, that she would not have anything else to do except face the fact that her life has remained unchanged as other people’s stories unfolded around her.\n\nOther characters with broken dreams are Anyango’s lonely mother, who longs for the love of her husband as she toils for her children. Or Sanyu’s mother who is wealthier and appears to be happy. They both wear veils of hope in order to cope with their lives and the truths they do not want to face.\n\nIn a way, the two girls’ friendship is a kind of hope, a dream of something better than the path that leads to Mama Atim. It is a rich tale and not a little powerful and engaging."
