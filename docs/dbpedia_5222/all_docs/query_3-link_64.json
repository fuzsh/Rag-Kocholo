I stayed for two nights, but the sound of mahjong playing was a bit loud when I went to bed on the second night, which affected my sleep. I stayed on the 14th floor. Maybe the 13th floor is a mahjong room, so I don't recommend staying on the 14th floor.\n\nOriginal TextTranslated by Google\n\nResponse from Property : Thank you very much for your review!

The surrounding Dongshankou subway station is a trendy and lively area, and there is also the Xinhepu historical district, which is very quiet and very comfortable to walk around. The breakfast is more Chinese style, the dim sum variety is enough to fill you up, the replenishment is OK, and the taste is good. The bath water is big. The disadvantage is that the TV does not work and the network signal is not very good. Overall good value for money, satisfied!\n\nOriginal TextTranslated by Google\n\nResponse from Property : Dear guests: Hello!

The hot water was not hot enough after 11 pm. The bed was not clean enough and was a bit damp. The aunt who cleaned the room rolled up our pajamas and threw them on the bed after cleaning the bed. .\n\nOriginal TextTranslated by Google\n\n3.5/5\n\nPosted on Jan 7, 2024\n\nfully equipped, Health: OK, Environment: OK Service: Mineral water costs an extra 2 yuan for a bottle. It‚Äôs the first time you stay in a hotel and you are charged. It‚Äôs not user-friendly. Breakfast is not provided and you have to pay for it at your own expense.
