On the death of the. Grand Master, Conrad Zolhier, in 1390, the Grand Comthur, Conrad von Wallenrod, was appointed Stadtholder. The position of the Order was at this time very critical, but fortunately it had able counsellors. Up to the death of the late Grand Master, both Poland and the Order were straining every nerve to make ample preparations for the ensuing cam- paign. Jagello had gained over to his side John, Duke of Masovia, and Duke Wladislaus of Oppeln, VOL. II. 6 2 HISTORY OF PRUSSIA. together with the Duke Wratislaus of Pomerania. The latter had not only concluded an offensive and defensive alliance with Jagello, but he had also declared himself and his brothers, Boguslaus and Bamim, vassals of the King of Poland. This alliance was a great blow to the Order and the Margrave of Brandenburg ; for it was through Pomerania that most of the reinforcements of Crusaders pasted on their way to the scene of hostilities in East Prussia. The merchants of Bran- denburg and Prussia were also sufferers, as the Pomeranian Duke would not allow the route from Stettin to be used by them. The only alKes that the Order could count upon were Sigismund, Duke Semowit of Masovia, the Margrave of Brandenburg, and the King of Bohemia. The Earl of Derby, at this critical' juncture, arrived with his knights, and it seems he was after- wards joined by a considerable number of Scottish Crusaders, in addition to whom numerous German and French nobles had repaired to the scene of hostilities. Unfortunately a dispute arose between the English and Scottish knights, ending in a broil, in which a member of the house of Douglas lost his life. Scarcely had peace been made between the parties when another quarrel took place between the representatives of France and England. The Stadtliolder, fearing that these petty jealousies might cause the break up of the army of Crusaders, deter- mined to lead them at once against the Lithuanians. SIEGE OF WILXA. ?i Having eflfected a concentration of all his available forces at Kauen, lie advanced against the town of Troky, which soon fell into his hands, and Skirgallo, Jagello's brother, w^ho does not appear to have had a large force with him, was defeated. The knights and their allies thereupon commenced the siege of Wilna. The garrison and the inhabitants of the town offered a most stubborn resistance, but part of the castle, owing to an act of treachery, was burnt down, and 14,000 people lost their lives — Carigal, Vitold^s brother, and Prince Narimant being taken prisoners: The remaining portion of the citadel successfully resisted the attacks of the knights. In accordance with the military usages of the time, the two princes ought to have been released on ransom, but both were put to death. Vitold sentenced his elder brother to be beheaded, and ordered Prince Narimant to be suspended from a tree by his feet, and shot at with arrows until he expired. After three months occupied in unsuccessful at- tempts to capture the citadel, their losses, coupled* with the want of provisions, compelled the allies to withdraw and return to Prussia. Vitold behaved in a most barbarous manner towards his countrymen, with the object, according to some, of weakening their opposition to his schemes of subjugation, by the terror his name would inspire ; added to which was the desire to avenge his brother's death before Wilna. The Order and their allies appear, however, to 6 2 4 HISTORY OF PRUSSIA. have arrived in Prussia, bringing with them a con- siderable quantity of booty. The greatest loss which they experienced was the death of Alard, Count of Hohenstein, who fell during the siege. Vitold took up his winter quarters at Insterburg and Ragnit, and thence undertook an expedition into Samogitia, but was obliged to retire, as Jagello suddenly advanced against him with an overwhelm- ing force. In the year 1391, on the great festival of St. Jude, in a Chapter consisting of 300 brothers, Conrad von Wallenrod was raised to the dignity 'of Grand Master. He had previously been Marshal, in 1384, Grand Comthur since 1387, and Stadtholder for the past year. Shortly after his election Von Wallenrod marched against the Lithuanians, accompanied by Vitold, who expected to obtain possession of Wilna by treachery. In this he was disappointed ; but the Grand Master totally defeated Skirgallo, capturing the forts of Novgorod and Wilkomirz, which had been recently erected by him. Great dissatisfaction was now aroused in Lithuania against this prince, partly on account of his defeat, partly owing to the incorporation of Lithuania with Poland. An important feature in the aggressive policy of Von Wallenrod was the fomenting of disunion among the Lithuanian princes, in which his eflforts were attended by much success. He also endeavoured, by offering high pay, to raise a large number of mercenary troops. During this INTRIGUES OF VITOLD. 5 time Vitold was ordered to despatcli frequent marauding bands into Lithuania, and, in order to afford them places of refuge, three fortresses were built on the islands of the Memel, namely, Xeuen- burg, Nettenburg, and Ritterswerder. By order of Skirgallo, Ritterswerder, which was occupied by Vitold, was unsuccessfully attacked by Prince Wigand, who, in the course of the siege, was him- self poisoned. Some attributed his untimely end to Vitold, by whom he was regarded as a most dan- gerous rival. As Skirgallo, on account of his unpopularity, had been removed from his govern- ment to the town of Kiew, Vitold now entered into negotiations with Jagello, through the medium of his nephew Henry (son of Semowit, Duke of Maso- via), offering to break off his alliance with the knights, on condition of his receiving the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. With the aid of his numerous followers he was then enabled treacherously to make prisoners of all the knights and retainers who were serving under him. After destroying the strongholds which had been entrusted to his guardianship, he returned to Lithuania, pursued by the garrisons of the two remaining forts on the islands. Vitold, having secured his prisoners and booty in a safe place, took up a position which commanded the mountain passes, and there surprised and totally routed his pursuers. He now entered Wihia, where he was received with great rejoicings by the people. Henry, the negotiator of these nefarious transac- 6 HISTORY OF PRUSSIA, tions, although a priest, demanded in man'iage Vitold's daughter, who was renowned for her beauty ; but he was ultimately induced to accept a bishopric in lieu of the lady. The losses which the Poles had experienced in maintaining Jagello's authority in Poland rendered them unwilling to make further sacrifices. It was therefore a great advantage to that prince to form an alliance with Vitold, whose military talents would enable him to withstand the Order in Lithu- ania. Having secured Vitold*s support, Jagello now despatched ambassadors to the different Euro- pean ports to intrigue against the Order. Unfor- tunately for the latter, their story was but too true, for no one could deny that Jagello had done his utmost to convert his subjects to Christianity, and that the knights were not actuated by the principles they professed, as they were doing their best for- cibly to annex his native country by fomenting intestine strife. This caused those who had aided the knights from the belief that they were the warrior-monks of Christ to waver in their allegiance to the Order ; and the only support on which the knights could now rely was from mercenaries. In Vitold they had lost one of their most able par- tisans. Nothing daunted at such a blow, they induced Swidrigail to revolt, and with his assistance took possession of Grodno and some other districts, together with 3,000 Lithuanians, who were brought captives into Prussia. DOCTOR LEANDER. 7 To ensure the adherence of the bishops and priests, the Grand Master allowed them to pursue a series of persecutions against those who would not implicitly accept their religious teaching. We formerly mentioned the fact that the Order was not very orthodox as regards the peculiar dogmas of the Eoman Catholic Church. It would be idle to sup- pose that the members of the Teutonic Order, by their residence in foreign countries and their know- ledge of Papal policy in the East, should not have arrived at the conclusion that it was dangerous for any State, that desired to retain its sovereign powers, to seek priestly assistance in temporal matters. A certain Leander, a follower of the Albanian faith, had been taken under the protection of Wal- lenrod, who, as Grand Master, had allowed him openly to proclaim his doctrines ; and, in a very short time, the reformer had gained a large number of proselytes. The Grand Master decided to forsake his former favourite for the purpose of obtaining the support of the priests. The principal charge laid against Leander was his condemnation of the monks for the indolent life they led. He sent to his oppo- nents a declaration of his religious opinions, and challenged any one to come forward and publicly controvert them ; and t ne challenge was accepted. This act of audacity forced the Grand Master to make some show of fair play, and he therefore de- cided that Marienwerder should be the scene of this theological discussion. On the way to the town 6 History of jprussia. Leander was upset by his driver, and, falling into a clay-pit, was killed. His followers maintained that this act was committed at the instigation of the priests. The latter, not contented with the death of their opponent, formed themselves into a religious synod, for the purpose of trying any person who had attached himself to the reformed movement; and the court was allowed to summon all those who were known to have favoured Leander to appear before it. Nor was this all, for they actually ordered the bodies of deceased proselytes to be taken from their graves, and to be reinterred by the hangman in the place allotted to felons. About this time the citizens of the town of Braunsberg, being greatly discontented with the conduct of their bishop, Heinrich Sorbaum, applied privately to the Grand Master, requesting that they should be placed under the immediate protection of the Order. To ingratiate himself with the priestly party. Von Wallenrod communicated to the bishop the request of his rebellious subjects. A revolt broke out, and the bishop narrowly escaped being kilUed. The knights put down the insurrection by force, and compelled the town to pay 2,000 Hungarian florins as a fine ; while the burgomaster, to save his life, had to appear before the bishop, barefooted and kneeling, with a rope round his neck. By these conciliatory measures the Grand Master induced the bishops and clergy to consent to the payment of an income-tax, together with a poll-tax. BiSHot SORBAUM. 9 which was to be devoted to the payment of the mercenaries. The cost of the approaching campaign was esti- mated at the sum of 600,000 marks. This smn having been collected, the Grand l^aster despatched agents to all parts of Europe to enlist mercenaries, and was profuse in his promises of reward for ser- vices rendered. Before the beginning of the war, the Grand Master experienced the usual consequences of having sacrificed his temporal power to the priests. The first dignitary who opposed him was Bishop Hein- rich Sorbaum, whom he l)ad lately reinstated. He had ordered the bishop to supply him with sufficient labour for fortifying the towns of Salon, Memel, Wohnsdorf , and Ragnit ; a request to which Hein- rich declined to accede. The ruler of the Order, not wishing to have a dispute with the prelate as to the extent of his public privileges, himself ordered the labourers to discontinue their employment, and to proceed to work on the fortifications. He also despatched a body of soldiers into the bishopric, with orders to cut off the right hand and foot of any one who should refuse to obey his commands. By this high-handed measure he obtained upwards of 1,000 labourers. The Grand Master, having been informed that the Archbishop of Riga intended to deliver into the hands of the Russians and Lithuanians some of the archiepiscopal castles in liefland, ordered them to 10 HISTORY OP PBUSSIA. be occupied by his soldiery. Thereupon the arch- bishop fled to the Court of Wenceslaus, King of Bohemia^ who, believing that the former had been unjustly treated, ordered all the property of the Order in Bohemia and Moravia to be confis- cated. The Grand Master, however, proved by a letter of the archbishop's of which he had got pos- session, that the latter was really in secret corre- spondence with the Lithuanians, and the King can- celled the decree. In the month of May, 1392, an envoy arrived at Marienburg with the offer on the part of Sigismund, King of Hungary, to sell or pledge the Neumark for the sum of 500,000 gulden ; but the Grand Master declined to buy the province until the King was in a position to guarantee it against certain claims on the part of either the King of Bohemia, the Duke of Gorlitz, brother of Sigismund, or the Duke of Moravia, son of the Emperor Charles IV. The King of Himgary's envoy also offered to sell to the Order the districts of Dobrin and Cujavia. But here again the claims of the King of Poland and Duke Wladislausof Oppeln prevented any satisfactory arrangement being made. A little later, however, Duke Wladislaus pledged to the Order the district of Itaria for the sum of 6,632 Hungarian florins. This transaction led to a further loan, by which Dobrin and its districts became the property of the knights. The news of these negotiations greatly alarmed the King of Poland; for he had just concluded an GEAND BANQUET AT KAUEN. 11 alliance with the King of Hungary, and, being fully aware of the treacherous character and the financial difficulties of Sigismund, he felt convinced that thei^e arrangements were nothing else than the preliminary to an offensive and defensive alliance against himself. During these transactions the recruiting agents of the Grrand Master had been so successful that no less than 46,000 mercenaries arrived in Prussia. The Grrand Master had besides at his disposal 18,000 men, and with these, in the year 1393, he advanced against the Lithuanians. On reaching the island, not far from Kauen, the site of the old Marion- werder, which had been destroyed by Vitold, the Grrand Master carried out a promise he had made of entertaining twelve of the most distinguished knights at a feast. A magnificent tent was erected on the island ; on one side of the river was drawn up the army of the Order under its Marshal, and on the opposite bank that of the foreigners under the Grand Comthur. The curtains of the tent were taken down, so that the soldiers could see the banquet, and a broad hat embroidered with gold was held over the head of each of the guests during the repast, to protect him from the sun. The first of these distinguished knights was an Austrian named Kinodius, of Richardsdorf, who had per- formed the wondrous feat of slaying sixty Turks with his own hand, and had also made a crusade to Jerusalem. Frederick, Margrave of Meissen, had IS aiStORY Ol? PRUSSIA. thb second place of honour, in consideration of the protection always afforded by him and his family to the interests of the Order. Among the other guests was a Scotch nobleman, for the heroic conduct of his father in nobly sacrificing his life to save that of his king ; Count Rupert of Wiirtemberg, in con- sideration of his humility in declining the dignity of emperor, because, in the interests of the Order, he had renounced his desire to marry the rich and beautiful Countess of Hapsburg; Degenhard, a standard-bearer from Westphalia, because he had forgiven the assassins of his father in obedience to a vision ; and Frederick of Buchwold, of whom it is said that he never refused a request made in the name of the Order of St. George. The repast com- menced at nine o'clock in the morning, and lasted until two in the afternoon ; thirty courses were served up, on silver, the knives and forks being of the same metal ; the wines, of the most costly kind, were presented to the guests in silver goblets ornamented with gold. During the feast heralds came forward and proclaimed the deeds of the guests, and descanted on the treacherous conduct of Vitold, declaring that, to ensure the triumph of the Crusaders, the banner of the Order must float on the citadel of Wilna. The Grand Master now returned to Prussia to superintend the organization of fresh reinforce- ments, while the army continued its advance. The Crusaders, however, had forgotten that, from the DEATH OP WALLENROO. 13 constant inroads which they had made into Lithu- ania, a great tract of land over which they had to pass before reaching Wilna had been so devastated, that it was totally nnable to support their numerous forces. Notwithstanding, in the belief that their numbers would overcome all difficulties, they com- menced the siege of Wilna. Vitold, who wisely offered no opposition to their advance, directed his immediate attention to the organizing of a large army among his own subjects, which he reinforced by numerous levies of Russians, Tartars, and Poles. For some time he contented himself with cutting off all the sources from which the knights could obtain supplies. Learning that his opponents were in urgent want of provisions, he advanced to the attack, the Polish garrison of Wilna supporting him by a general sortie. A disastrous defeat ensued, and the Order was compelled to retire, with a loss of 30,000 men. The remnants retreated to Prussia, but the foresight of the Grrand Master, in raising fresh levies, enabled him shortly to undertake a series of small expeditions into Lithuania, Vitold in retaliation making an inroad into the district of Insterburg. The failure of this campaign and other troubles had such an effect on the mind of the Grand Master that he shortly afterwards lost his reason, and died on the 25th of July, 1393. Wallenrod was a stem and determined ruler, and at the same time a crafty politician. His prede- 14 HISTORY OF PRUSSIA. cessor had, in his opinion, given too much authority into the hands of the guilds of the towns. In order to curtail their rising power, Wallenrod built suburbs to the towns, in which he placed Courlanders, Lithuanians, and Poles, who received the same rights of citizenship as those possessed by the Ger- mans. This naturally led to jealousies ; and there can be but little doubt that he secretly did his utmost to undermine the power of the priests and monks, although he did not scruple to proclaim publicly that he ruled by Gottesgnade^ or \" Divine right.\" During his government the territory of the knights was extended, botli by purchase and by force of arms, and the influence of the Order throughout Germany was increased considerably.

The knights now elected as their chief Conrad von Jungingen, who had formerly been the Campan of Conrad ZoUner of Rotenstein. The fii;st act of the new Grand Master was to endeavour, with the assistance of the ecclesiastics, to continue for one year the additional taxes which his pre-' decessor had levied, to furnish funds for the prosecution of the Lithuanian war; but so violent was the opposition to his proposal that he had to abandon the idea of continuing hostilities. The guilds being the chief opponents of increased taxa- 16 HISTORY OF PRUSSIA. tion, the Grand Master enlarged the privileges of the mechanics and labourers. He issued an edict against the abuse of luxuries; citizens were for- bidden to have the direction or management of the artillery in time of peace. Every knight was allowed to have ten horses for his use, and a Comthur one hundred. To counteract the concessions made by his predecessor to the priestly party, Von Jungingen enacted that no ecclesiastic could become a bishop imless he were a member of the Order. From a statute punishing heathen priests with death by fire, it would seem that some ren^nants of the ancient religion were still in existence. To prevent commercial frauds, a class of custom- house officers was instituted about this time, who had to determine on oath the value of all articles of commerce. We now return to the relations between Denmark and Sweden. The throne of Sweden, after several years of war, was formally handed over to Albrecht, by King Magnus, in the year 1371. The Swedes, howeveTi were dissatisfied with Albrecht, who favoured his German countrymen at their expense, and on the death . of Waldemar, King of Denmark, in 1376, they oflfered the crown of Sweden to that monarch's daughter Margaret, who had married Haymin, Kong of Norway, in 1363.* This naturally * Margaret, Queen of Denmark, by the death of her husband Haymin, became regent over Norway for her son Olaus, who died in the year 1387, when the Danes acknowledged Margaret as n AFFAIES OP DENMARK AND SWEDEN. 17 led to war between Albrecht and Margaxet ; and in the great battle of Falk5ping, in 1388^ the Queen's forces were successful, and Albrecht and his son were taken prisoners. By the victory of Falkoping the naval power of Denmark was greatly in-* creased. The ports Bostook and Wismar, always jealous of Danish supremacy, informed the Grand Master that they would not permit Prussian vessels to supply the Danes with munitions of war, but also promised him not to commit acts of violence, and to forego molesting Prussian vessels trading with Denmark and Sweden. At their instigation, how- ever, a numerous piratical fleet was soon assembled, which not only revictualled Stockholm, then be- sieged by the royal troops, but captured Gothland,* and fortified Wisby, which latter they made their head-quarters, so that the Prussian trader no longer dared appear alone in the open sea. The Prussian Hanseatic towns, in conjunction with Lubeck, expressed a willingness to pay a good ransom if Margaret would release King Albrecht, conclude a peace with him, and indemnify Prussian traders their queen. In 1396 the States General of the kingdomB of Nor- way, Sweden, and Denmark assembled at Calmar, where it was agreed that they should all be ruled by one and the same sovereign. This act was called the *' Calmar Union,\" on which occasion Margaret designated Eric as her successor. She died in NoTember, 1411. * This idand had been mortgaged by Albrecht to the Qrand Master Yon Botenstein for 20,000 dobloona VOL. n. c 18 HISTOBY OF PRUSSIA. for the losses they had experienced. Margaret declining these proposals, all intercourse with Danish ports was broken off. In 1894 the Grand Master, Conrad von Jungingen, reopened negotiations with Duke John of Mecklen- burg and Queen Margaret for the release of the Bang of Sweden, and for the renewal of commercial relations between the Prussian and Danish ports. It was arranged that the Prussian and Hanseatic towns should first demand from the Duke of Meck- lenburg, and the towns of Rostock and Wismar, a satisfactory compensation for all the losses which their traders had experienced at their hands, and that, this being effected, the Duke should be invited to join in requesting the Queen to release the King of Sweden on ransom ; and further, it was proposed that the town of Stockholm should be held by the Hanseatic Confederation until the King had repaid his ransom money. To this the towns and the Duke agreed, and in the month of July their repre- sentative met those of the Queen at Helsingfors. Here the Queen's envoy stated that Margaret was willing to release Albrecht on parole for a limited period, sufficient to enable him to arrange a durable peace, failing which, the King and his son must give themselves up to the Danish authorities, or pay the Queen the sum of 60,000 marks, eight of the Han- seatic towns being responsible for the King. Un- fortimately, before the peace could be signed, a violent dispute arose between some of the Germans THE NEUMARK. 19 and DaneSj which ended in bloodshed, and caused the break up of the conference. Wratislaus, Duke of Pomerania, an opponent of the Order, died about this time, and the Grand Master concluded a treaty with his successor, Duke Bamim, by which he secured the right of passage through the Duke's territory. At the commence- ment of the year 1396 the conference of Helsing- fors was renewed. The King of Sweden was released, and Stockholm was occupied by the Han« seatic towns. In the same year, the Duke of Q-el- dem having arrived in Prussia, the Grand Master, in defiance of Sigismund, invaded Lithuania; but an accumulation of snow which had taken place forced the Crusaders to retire. The Duke seems to have undertaken this expedition in consideration of a loan of 6,000 nobles from the Grand Master. Shortly after this Duke John of Gorlitz died, and the Neumark fell to the inheritance of Sigis- mund, at whose request the Grand Master undertook to defend that province from external attack. During this period disputes again arose between the Order and the Archbishop of Riga, which were, however, finally settled at the conference of Dantzic. Swidrigail, who had taken refuge in Prussia, with the assistance of the knights now invaded Lithuania from Liefland, and got possession of the stronghold of Vitepsk, but was shortly after defeated and made prisoner by Vitold, and the expedition collapsed. Both parties being now weary of the struggle, a c2 20 HISTORY OP PBUS8U. peace was proposed and concluded between the Grand Master and Vitold, who were thus enabled — the latter to extend his conquests in Russia, and the former to direct his energies to the acquisition of Gothland and the Neumark. Having equipped a large fleet, on board of which were 4,000 men, the Grand Master, in conjunction with some vessels from Lubeck, the whole being commanded by Conrad yon Biberau, proceeded to Gothland, where be destroyed a piratical fleet, and captured the greater part of the island. The expedition then proceeded along the coasts of Sweden and Denmark, seising and destroying several other vessels, amongst them some Danish ships, which had been despatched, as the Queen afterwards alleged, on their way to Goth* land to assist the Prussian fleet. All the Prussians could urge in their defence was, that the Danish vessels were confounded with piratical cruisers, and so destroyed, the pirates being in the habit of hoisting the colours of foreign nations. After this the knights appear to have reshipped their men from Gothland, and to have returned to Prussia. Eric of Gothland having died, his mother handed the government of Gothland over to a certain Swen Sture, who became the open protector of the pirates, and even shared their plunder. The King of Sweden was first of aU urged to eject the pirates and restore order, but, he being unable or imwilling to do this, the Grand Master called upon Duke John of Meek- t3OTHtAN». 21 lenburg to assist him in freeing the Baltic from the scourge ; and in the month of March, 1397, a fleet of eighty vessels, having on board between 4,000 and 6,000 men, together with the necessary artillery, set sail from Dantzic for Gothland, where they landed. The pirates, imder Swen Sture, now took forcible possession of the citadel of Wisby, where the Duke of Mecklenburg and the mother of Eric resided. As a heavy fall of snow prevented the artillery being brought up to effect a breach, negotiations were opened with the pirates through the medium of the Duke of Mecklenburg, during which the town and citadel were completely surrounded by the knights, by land and sea. A general assault then took place, and the pirates and their accomplices wer6 slaughtered without mercy, their captain, with 400 of his followers, however, managing to escape. The Duke of Mecklenburg now agreed that the island should be handed over to four Prussian com- missioners, who should conduct its government until the Order had come to a regular understanding with the King of Sweden. The Baltic pirates having next made Friesland the basis of their operations, and the trade with Norway being at a standstill, the Lubeckers and the Order now set about a second expedition ; but the Grand Master found the greatest difficulty in raising the necessary funds, for his Gothland policy had compelled him eyery year to increase the taxation of his subjects. 22 HISTOKY OP PRUSSIA. Queen Margaret of Denmark had viewed with extreme jealousy the occupation of Grotbland by the Order^ and the rise of their naval power, and she was believed to be in secret negotiations witibi the pirate commandant of that island for its cession to her — ^a scheme which was frustrated by the final capture of Gothland by the Order, to which, on the 25th of May, 1399, the entire island was handed over by Albrecht, who received for the transfer the sum of 10,000 nobles. It was agreed that, should any future King of Denmark wish to regain possession of Gothland, he was to ^pay the Order the sum of 30,000 nobles, with a year's notice in advance. In case the notice were given, but the money not paid, the Order might dispose of the island to any other State. Albrecht and Duke John of Mecklenburg were co-signataries to this treaty. Margaret, considering that Goth- land belonged to her dominions, on hearing of the arrangement with Albrecht, protested against it; and the Grand Master, declaring his willingness to cede the island in accordance with the compact he had entered into with Albrecht, called upon the latter to come to an amicable settlement with Mar- garet as to her claims. The Grand Master was also, at this time, engaged in a difference with the Bang of Poland, concerning the districts of Dobrin, which Jagello declared belonged to him ; and Conrad von Jungingen ex- pressed his readiness to cede the territory in dispute, SAHOeiTlA SUBJUGATED. 23 if the Duke of Oppeln's consent could be obtained, and the money for which it had been pledged were repaid. H^iry IV. of England, who ascended the throne on the deposition of Eichard II., in 1399, despatched ambassadors to Marienbnrg, shortly after his acces- sion, to renew friendly relations with Prussia. Pope Boniface IX. at this period was a great pa- tron of the Order, and Sigismund, King of Hungary, who was adverse to the increasing power of Poland and to Margaret, also maintained friendly relations with it ; and it may be presumed that this needy monarch had already received pecuniary assistance from the Grand Master. With the aid of the Pope, Charles the Bold, Duke of Lorraine, at the head of 200 knights, about this time proceeded to Prussia, where he was joined by Duke William of Geldern, who however, on account of ill-health, was obliged to return to Germany. The Marshal, Werner von Tettingen, assumed the command of the army, and advanced into Samogitia^ from Ragnit, in February, 1400. Here the Cru- saders devastated the country for twelve days ; and the unfortunate inhabitants, being totally unprepared for the attack, were terrified into submission, and embraced Christianity. By these means the greater part of Samogitia was annexed, and we are told that the Duke of Lorraine and his followers returned loaded with presents and plunder. In the month of July the Grand Duchess 24 HISTORY OP PRUSSIA. Vitold visited the different shrines in Prussia, and *was entertained with great splendour at Marienburg. The forcible annexation of Samogitia was a measure highly unjustifiable in many ways. A characteristic of the people was their love of inde- pendence and attachment to their ancient religion. Many of the inhabitants, to escape the yoke of the knights, had taken refuge in Lithuania, and the Order demanded that Vitold should send them back, in accordance with the treaty. This he only par- tially carried out; but at last, being pressed, he collected all the Samogitians, and ordered them to return to their native country, following up this step by sending letters of justification to the Pope and all the German princes, and the Grand Master did the same. Conrad, knowing that, should war break out with Vitold, it was highly necessary to have the King of Poland on his side, did his utmost to con- ciliate the latter by presents, and by assurances of the friendship of the Order. The Grand Master knew that, if Jagello and Vitold remained united, all the external assistance he could depend upon would be that of mercenary leaders, and the favour of the Pope depended on his being able to outbid Jagello. Added to this, Margaret of Denmark would take advantage of hostilities to force the Order to cede Gothland to her* Unfortunately for the Order, Sigismund, who had been defeated in the great battle of Nicopolis INTRIGUES OP JAGBLLO. 25 against the Turks (in 1396), had been imprisoned by the nobles in the castle of Siklos. Jagello, who had concluded an offensive and defensive alliance with the Russian prince John von Twer and the Duke of Masovia, now began sending reinforcements into Lithuania; and the Grand Master to counteract this opened negotiations with Swidrigail, who possessed considerable influence amongst the Podolians, Wallachians, and Russians, and raised mercenaries in Pomerania and in various parts of Germany. Jagello, suspecting that he was not sufficiently strong at once to begin the struggle, despatched Duke Semowit to Marienburg, in September, 1401, to reassure the Order of his friendship, and to induce the Grand Master to suspend his military preparations; but this the latter declined to do until the King had given substantial guarantees of his peaceful intentions. It is probable that Jagello's real reason for wishing to postpone the outbreak of war was his approaching marriage with the daughter of Count Hermann von Celly, a grand*daughter of Casimir, and whom^ although frightfully ugly, he had selected as his queen on account of her legal claim to the crown,* Vitold was also unwilling to commence hostilities^ as he was at that time unsuccessful in a war with the Duke of Smolensk, a Russian prince ill alliallce * The Queen Hedwig had died broken-hearted in the year 1399. 26 HISTORT OF PRUSSIA. with Swidrigail) indirecily assisted by the Order. In the month of November Swidrigail^ who had been invited to attend the marriage ceremony of Jagello, appeared in the disguise of a merchant at Marienburgy to conclude a regular alliance with the Grand Master. He was received with open arms, and his visit to Prussia was celebrated bv two inroads into Lithuania. Vitold, with all his nobles and principal retainers, being absent at Cracow, to assist at the marriage of Jagello, and the people being taken by surprise, the knights returned to Prussia laden with plunder, cattle, and many hun- dred prisoners. About this time Swidrigail concluded an offen- sive and defensive alliance with the Order, and ceded to it a large portion of his territory, on the condition that the Order should assist him to the utmost in obtaining Lithuania. In this document he styles himself \" Heir and Prince of Lithuania and Russia, and ruler of Podolia.'' This Lithuanian prince now repaired to Liefland to prepare for an expedition agdinst Vitold ; but the operations were delayed by Jagello's having for the time being obtained the favour of the Pope, and by the appearance of a comet, which passed over Europe in the March of 1402, and which was supposed to forebode disaster. The Grand Master, moreover, knew that if he invaded Lithuania, the Pope and Europe would declare that he was the instrument of evil. DEFEAT OF VITOLD. 27 In the month of May the Samogiiians took by surprise the town of Memel^ which they sacked and set on fire, and Vitold appearing with a large force before Gotteswerder, which he took and burnt, Conrad ordered the immediate invasion of lithuaniai and the knights, with an army of 40,000 men, in conjunction with Swidrigail, crossed the river Wihia, where they defeated Vitold. Little or no opposition seems to have been offered by the inhabitants, who had retired to the towns and fortresses. These being so well defended that the knights did not venture to attack them, the army was com- pelled to return to Prussia, and Swidrigail took up a position at the fort of Baiselauken (Beeslack), for the purpose of instigating a revolt in Lithuania, aided by the funds abimdantly supplied by the Order. Margaret, Queen of Denmark, had at this tune renewed her claims on Gothland, with such perti- nacity as foreshadowed her intention of obtaining her demands by force of arms. In this dilemma the Grand Master referred the dispute to the Hanseatic Bund, but, fortunately for the Order, an event now took place which forced Margaret to change her demeanour for a time. After the death of Margaret's son Olaus, in 1387, it had been rumoured that he had been poisoned at her instigation. Some Danish merchants, passing through a village near Graudenz, encountered a poor man who bore a most striking resemblance to 28 HIST0E7 OF PRUSSIA. the deceased prince. On being questioned he denied being in any way connected with the royal family, but, when several other persons declared positively that they recognized him as Olaus, he affirmed that sixteen years before his mother had ordered him to be poisoned; but that another person had been the victim, and that he had fled from his country. The pretender was taken to Dantzic, where he was treated with great distinction, and openly acknowledged as King of Denmark and Nor- way. Margaret, fearing that the Grand Master might follow the example of the Dantzigers, requested that the pretender should be sent to Denmark, so that she might hear his story in person. Von Jungingen, seeing that, if he granted such an important favour, Margaret would probably come to an arrangement with him as to Gothland, sent the pretender, under the escort of several knights, to the Queen, where, on being examined, it was found he could not speak the Danish lan- guage, and he himself owned that he was a native of Eger, in Bohemia, and that his father was named Wolf and his mother Margaret. He was taken to Schonen, where he was burnt alive, together with all the papers to which he had affixed his signature as king. The Grand Master was deceived in his expecta- tions as regards Margaret's generosity, for, as soon as the pretender was out of the way, she threatened FUBCHAgE OF THE NfiUUABK. 29 the Order with a declaration of war if Gothland was not given up. Sigismnndi who had now returned to power, wasi as usual, in great want of money, and he offered to sell the Neumark unconditionally to the Order, stating that it had been pledged to the King of Poland, and that, if the sum was not repaid within a very short time, he must deliver the province over to Jagello. It was impossible for the Grand Master to allow this to take place, and accordingly, in the month of July, the Order purcha^ied the Neumark for the sum of 63,000 Hungarian gulden, on condition of its being restored to Sigismund or Wenceslaus, or to the Margrave Jobst of Moravia, on the repayment of the above-mentioned sum; and the same condition was extended to the children or heirs of Sigismund during his life and that of the other two princes. If the province was not redeemed during the period of these lives, the territory should remain for ever in the possession of the knights. All expenses incurred in improving the condition of the country had to be repaid, to the amount of 1,500 marks. Stybor, Waiwode of Transylvania, represented the Emperor in this transaction. In 1403 three successful expeditions were made into Lithuania by the knights and Count Frederick of Zollem, Gomthur of Ragnit. In the same year the Pope issued a Bull repri- manding the Order, in severe terms, for their 30 HISTORY OF PRUSSU. conduct towards Poland and Lithuania. At an interview wliich took place between the Grand Master and the Eling of Poland at Christmas, Swidrigail was reconciled to the King, and it was agreed that another meeting should take place at Whitsuntide of the ensuing year, when all disputes were to be settled. As the Grand Master had been unable to induce Albrecht to treat with the Queen, and the period having elapsed which she had prescribed for the settlement of the dispute, her fleet took possession of Gothland, suflFering a defeat, however, while attempting to take Wisby. The Grand Master sent an expedition to the island, but on approaching the shore the knights found that it had entirely fallen into the hands of the Queen's forces. They, however, captured and brought into the port of Dantzic seven Danish vessels laden with plunder from Gothland. In the month of March, 1404, another expedition was despatched to Gothland. After landing an army of 16,000 men, consisting of cavalry, infantry, and artillery, the fleet blockaded the island, and the knights proceeded to besiege one of the three forts erected by the Danes. The defenders made a most stubborn resistance, so that, their supply of powder running short, the knights found themselves, at Whitsuntide, forced to conclude an armistice for three weeks, in order to enter into fresh negotia- tions. Margaret, insisting on the unconditional EXPEDITION TO GOTHLAOT). 31 cession of the island, equipped a fleet at Calmar, with the necessary troops for the relief of the be- leaguered territory ; but the knights boldly attacked the Danish fleet, the greater part of which they either captured or destroyed. Margaret now, having lost 200 vessels and a large number of her best saUors in attempting to maintein her Bupremacy in the island, expressed her willingness to come to terms with the Grand Master ; and in the month of July, with the mediation of the Burgomaster of Lubeck and his town council, a fresh armistice was arranged between the contending parties, during which negotiations were to be opened either at Schonor or Calmar. In the same year a fresh peace was concluded with Vitold and Jagello, through the mediation of Swidrigail, Vitold undertaking to restore all the captured districts; and it was further stipulated that, if the Polish and Prussian commissioners could not decide as to the right of proprietorship of the territory of Dobrin, the question was to be left to the decision of Sigismund. No sooner was this treaty concluded than fresh difficulties axose with Duke Stolpe of Pomerania, with reference to his claims on the Neumark. At this time the fortress of Driesen, being claimed as a fief by both Poland and the Order, gave rise to a dispute with Poland. Notwithstanding that the river Netze was regarded by the Order as the fron- tier of the Neumark, Driesen, which by the cutting 92 SISTOST OF PBUS8U, of a dam was oonverted into au island, was claimed by the Poles; there can, however, be little doubt that it bad been sucoessivelj under the rule oi both oountries. A great hindrance to the trade between England and Prussia was the opposition of the Prussian manu- facturers to the importation of English cloth, which was far cheaper than the native article. So great was the jealousy of the Prussian traders in this respect, that it was enacted that all English stuffs should be confiscated. Bobert lU. of Scotland, who was then engaged in a war with England, was constantly suppHed by the Prussians with provisions and munitions of war. King Henry, in a letter dated Westminster, December 7, 1404, besought the Grand Master, aa an ally, to forbid this traffic ; his request ww, however, disregarded. Subsequently two Prussian embassies appear to have been despatched to England, but the demands of the Order were so exorbitant that Henry could not accede to them. The Grrand Master accordingly not only prohibited trade with Eng- land, but also confiscated all English goods, and expelled such of our countrymen in Dantzic who were not naturalized. He also forbade any English- man from acquiring the rights of citizenship in Prussia. Not content with these severe measures. Von Jungingen induced the Hanseatic Confedera- tion and the Poles to join him in this restrictive policy. The King of England seems to have TRADE WITH ENGLAND. 33 been forced to come to terms, for we find that in August, 1405, a deputation, consisting of William Brampton and others, came to Marienburg, bringing with them a letter from Henry, dated May 11, 1405, in which he says : — ^^ Lites ortse inter nos, ligeos et subditos nostros, et illos de Prusia et alios dicti Magistri subditos quoscumque ratione vel occasione arrestacionum navium et aUorum vasorum capcionum bonorum nomine marque sive reprisalium.'' In October, 1405, a treaty of reciprocity was con- cluded between Prussia and England ; Englishmen were to enjoy the same rights as other foreigners in Prussia, and vice versd. Certain restrictions were placed on the importation of English cloth. It was agreed that English commissioners should meet those of Prussia and their allies at Dordtrecht, within the space of a year, for the settlement of the indemnification for the losses which the two con- tracting parties had inflicted on each other ; should no satisfactory arrangement be made, English and Prussian traders should, within three months, return to their respective countries, taking with them their merchandise. With the rest of Europe Prussia would have been able to carry on a flourishing trade, but the depre- dations of the pirates rendered the navigation of the Sound extremely dangerous. In fact, no ship was allowed to leave any part of Prussia alone, so that the expenses entailed in equipping the necessary VOL. n. d JU HISTORY OF PRUSSU. armed vessels to guard the incrcliaiitmen caused the profits of the traders to be seriously decreased. Commerce with the neighbouring territories had greatly improved since the peace with Poland; and the greatest proof of the prosperity of the towns was their readiness to pay the increasing taxes. About Whitsuntide the King of Poland, at an interview with the Grand Master, Von Jungingen, at Thorn, paid over to him the sum of 50,000 Hun- garian gulden, for which Dobrin had been pledged, and 400 marks for Slotoria ; the pledged districts thereupon returning to the original owners. The boundary of the Neumark was also more clearly defined. During the years 1405, 1406, the plague was rife in Prussia, destroying a great number of the poorer classes. At the commencement of the year 1407 the cele- brated Persian Archbishop, John of Sulthanien, visited the Grand Master at Marienburg. For cen- turies before, various ecclesiastics had attempted to unite the chaos of sects which existed in the East. During the pontificate of John XXII. strenuous efforts had been made by him to induce the Patri- arch of Armenia to assist in carrying out such a desirable object, but the jealousy of the Armenian Church offered insurmountable difficulties. The archbishop, prior to his visit to the Grand Master, had visited many foreign Courts to obtain their assistance in uniting the various Christian sects. THE ARCHBISHOP OP SULTHANIEN. 85 This prelate believed the time had amved when the project could be again renewed with more prospect of Buccess. He therefore requested the Grand Master to furnish him with a letter to the King of Cyprus, from which we give the following short extract : — \" Serenissimo magnificoque principi ac domino rege CiprisB et Armeniee domino nostro nobis in Christo dilecto : placeat vestre magnificentiaa denuo tractare cum patriarcha Armenorum et majoribus, ut se humilient, ad unionem festinent ac laborent.\" Conrad von Jungingen also gave him another letter to Mirza Miranschach, son of Tamerlane, in which he expressed his gratitude for the protection afforded to Christians in the East, and congratulated him on the success of his arms against the hitherto invincible Bajazet. In another letter to Tamerlane the Grand Master informed that great warrior that his merchants would be treated in Prussia in the same hospitable manner as were all other foreign traders, and that the bearer of the letter had but one object, viz. the unification of the various Christian sects over which he ruled ; and that, if he succeeded in his enterprise, Tamer- lane's subjects would become far more peaceful. As the Patriarch of Constantinople persecuted the nobles and persons attached to the Eomish Church, the Grand Master entrusted the archbishop with a letter to Manuel II., the Greek Emperor, requesting him to protect the followers of the Catholic Faith d 2 36 HISTORY OP PRUSSIA. and listen to the proposals of the Archbishop of Sulthanien. The following epistle from the Grand Master to John the Presbyter shows that the prelate had brought some communication from the latter : — ^^ Serenissimo ac magnifico principi a regi abassio sive Presbytero Johanni, domino nostro nobis in Christo dilecto, exhilirati animo nobis jucundissima preconia de yestre majestatis statu et persona gra- tissime accepimus a venerabili patre f ratre Johanne archiepiscopo Soltaniensi sive tocius orientis, qui, zelum vestrum et fervorem oraculo vive vocis nobis per ordinem preclare multipliciter peroravit, qualiter vestra magnificentia ad ecclesiam Catholicam et quod sinum amplissimum liberalitatis et clementise ad Ghristi fideles et ad nuncios sedis apostolicaa habeat ipsis munifice proyidendo et consultissime dirigendo.\" Some time after this occurrence the Grand Master, Conrad yon Jimgingen, felt his end approaching. He had long been suffering from a painful malady, which now threatened to prove fatal. Shortly before his death, Conrad summoned his principal council- lors to his chamber, to deliberate as to the choice of a successor, and strongly advised them not to elect his brother Ulrich, who would, in all probability, embroil the Order in a war with Poland, The Grand Master breathed his last in the month of March, 1407, universally regretted.

Election of Ulrich von Jungingen (1410) — Purchase of Driesen — Sale of Gothland to Denmark — Treaty with England — Sump- tuary Laws — Negotiations with Jagello — ^Revolt in Samogitia — Outbreak of Hostilities — ^Victorious Advance of the Knights into Poland — ^Armistice Concluded — ^Decision of Wenceslaus and Sigismund — Protest of Jagello — The Polish Army ad- vances into Prussia — Battle of Tannenberg (1410) — Defeat and Death of the Grand Master — Heinrich von Plauen appointed Stadtholder — Siege of Marienburg — Vigorous De- fence of the Castle — ^Intrigues of Vitold — Jagello retires to Poland. On the death of Conrad von Jungingen, Werner von Tettingen was elected Stadtholder, and the Order obtained possession of Santok, which had been pledged by the King of Poland to the Knights of St. John. On the 29th of August, 1407, the Order elected ULrich von Jungingen as Grand Master, without regard to the dying counsels of his brother Coiu'ad, who was opposed to his succession. Ulrich had already distinguished himself in the war with the Samogitians, and since the year 1388 he had UWaCH VON JUNGINGEN. 39 been Companion of the Grand Master, Conrad Zollner von Eotenstein. In the year 1404 he was promoted to the high rank of Marshal, in which office he acquired a reputation for great military capacity. The first act of the new Grand Master was to arrange for the final purchase of Driesen and its districts from Ulrich von der Ost, whose wife and cousin, Hans von der Ost, were parties to tho agreement. Driesen was of value to the Order, as affording a good basis of operations in defence of the Neumark. The peaceful disposition of Ulrich's predecessor had produced such a laxity of discipline amongst the Teutonic Knights, that they were no longer regarded by the citizens of the larger towns with the same respect as formerly. For the purpose of restoring the former prestige of the Order, the Grand Master issued a series of edicts relating to the interior economy of the Order and the privi- leges of its members. Ulrich, in addition to these ordinances, renewed several of the oivil laws of his predecessors, especially those concerning marriage without the sanction of relations. He prohibited turbulent assemblies, and enacted that members of the Order were not to be accompanied to the Chapter-house by more than ten retainers. From these regulations it would appear that many knights led an extravagant life, and openly violated jtlie statutes of the Order. In order to avoid the possibility of war with 40 HISTORY OP PRUSSIA. Denmark, which would probably have prevented the Grand Master from carrying out his reforms, and to be in a fit condition to defend himself against Poland, he sold the island of Gothland to Eric* and Margaret of Denmark, for the sum of 9,000 English nobles. The surrender of a maritime stronghold of such importance might seem a mistake on the part of the Order, but, on the contrary, it was a proof of the sagacity of the Grand Master, his object being to remain on friendly terms with all those States whose ships frequented Prussian ports. For this reason he followed up the surrender of Gothland by a treaty of reciprocity with England, which was highly advantageous to both countries, especially to Eng- land, which was then suffering from a succession of bad harvests, and was obliged to import com from Prussia. These measures of the Grand Master prove that he really desired peace. * Eric XIIL, son of the Dake of Pomerania, colleague and sue* cessor of Queen Margaret of Waldemar. He married, in 1410, Fhilippa, daughter of Henry lY. of England; and in HI 2, on Mar- garet's death, became King of Denmark and Sweden. His in- capacity, tyranny, and caprice so disgusted the Swedes and Danes, that both rcTolted. He became involyed in a war with the Hanse towns ; and the Danes chose for their king his nephew, Christo- pher, Duke of Bavaria, Eric being allowed to retain possession of the island of Gothland. In 1448 Eric*s cruisers attempted to levy contributions on the Prussian flag; he was besieged in Wisby, whence he escaped, but was afterwards sent to the island of Rugenf where he ended his days. DEIESEK. 41 One of the jmncipal articles of the convention (1404) was, that the frontiers of the Neumark should remain unchanged. This appears by some over- sight not to have been introduced in the final treaty, but it was shortly afterwards inserted by order of the King of Poland at Thorn. This prince now pretended to have a ground of complaint against the Order in its purchase of Driesen, which transaction, he maintained, was a violation of the before-mentioned treaty, as Driesen was, properly speaking, a fief of Poland. Polish writers state that in an audience which Jagello granted to the Comthur of Thorn, who came to present him with a letter from the late Grand Master, written shortly before his death, and to thank him for the respect he had shown to his memory, the Polish King not only declined to read the letter, but expressed his discontent with the occupation of Driesen. On the other hand, we find that the King of Poland invited the Grand Master to pay him a visit at Kauen, where he waa most sumptuously entertained on the 6th of January, 1408. At this meeting the affairs of Santok and Driesen were discussed in the presence of the nobles of Poland and Prussia. As regards Driesen, Vitold was chosen arbitrator, and he pronounced in favour of the Eang of Poland. The Grand Master refused to accept the decision, and the meeting broke up, with the understanding that the disputes should be settled by some friendly arrangement. 42 HISTORY OP MUSSIA The beginning of hostilities was caused by a rising of the Samogitians, who had only been induced to acknowledge the supremacy of the Order through the influence of Vitold, who had remained faithful to his engagements. This outbreak origi- nated in the following manner. Vitold had under- taken an expedition against his son-in-law Basilius, who ruled in Beussen, and at his request the knights despatched a contingent to assist him; they also ordered a number of Samogitians to join Vitold's standard. This the Samogitians declined to do, for, being subjects of the knights, they wished to be supplied with horses and attached to the contingent of the Order. The knights, however, forced them to act as infantry, wliich was considered as a mark of inferiority. In revenge for this insult these people suddenly surprised and destroyed the rising tcwTi recently built at the junction of the rivers Memel and Dangau. Vitold was greatly incensed by an inroad which Swidrigail made at this time into his territory, instigated, as he believed, by the Order. Ho there- fore secretly despatched his Marshal, Rumpold, to organize a regular rising among the Samogitians. The Polish and Prussian writers differ very much in their accoimts of the opening act of hostility committed by the Order. The Grand Master, on hearing of the revolt which was being organized, seized twenty Polish vessels, which he suspected to contain munitions of war intended for the Samo* OOTBRlfiAK 01^ flOStlLIflE^. 43 gitians ; but it turned out that they were laden with com for Lithuania, which was then suffering from the effects of a bad harvest. Vitold immediately ordered his officers in Lithuania to commence hostilities. The Order, on learning this, despatched the Comthur of Thorn to Jagello, demanding that he should punish Vitold for aiding the Samogitians. The King declared that he knew nothing of the matter, and requested that the Grand Master should wait until he obtained the opinion of the Reichstag as to the conduct of the delinquent. On the 17th of July, 1409, after the meeting of the Reichstag, the Archbishop of Gnesen, Nicolaus von Kurowski, was despatched to the Grand Master, to bring about an interview between the latter and Jagello. It soon becoming apparent that the ambas- sador only sought to gain time, as the Poles were not yet ready to take the field, the Grand Master declared that he woidd at once advance on Lithuania unless his demand was complied with. The arch- bishop, losing his temper, replied that in that case Poland would retaliate on Prussia — a remark which was regarded by Ulrich as an open declaration of war. The Grand Master appears to have been quite prepared for eventualities, for, on the first sign of Vitold^s contumacy, ho had demanded reinforce- ments from various friendly princes, and had also induced the Dukes of Pomerania, Swantibor of Stettin, and Boguslaus of Stolpe, to renounce their alliance with the King of Poland. The Polish 44 HISTOBY OF PBU86U. envoys had evidently acted at variance with their instructions, for by their indiscretion they enabled Ubich thus to bring matters to a crisis desired neither by Vitold nor by the King of Poland. The former now eflFected a reconciliation with his rival Swidrigail, and called to his assistance his Tartar allies. The Grand Master, to forestall the attack of the Lithuanians, divided his army into three corps, which advanced simultaneously into Poland at diflPerent points. The first corps captured Dobrin, Slotoria, and Bobrovniki, the second corps took Bromberg, and the third overran Masovia. The rapid successes of the knights produced a very disheartening effect upon the Poles, and their king, finding that Vitold would be imable to assist him before the end of the next year, and that he would therefore have to contend single-handed against the three armies of the Order, determined to avail him- self of the friendly offers made by Wenceslaus and Sigismund, who had despatched envoys to Swetz for the purpose. These two princes had already agreed to assist the Order in the war, but they were not imwilling to mediate, as they wished to preserve the balance of power between Poland and Prussia. The Grand Master agreed to an armistice, October 8, 1409. Both parties were to remain in statu qm ; the conditions formerly entered into with King Casimir were to remain in force ; should any dispute arise, it was to be decided by the Emperor Sigismund; and should one of the contracting ARraSTICE CONCLUDED. 45 parties break the armistice, the Emperor bound himself to attack the aggressor. Vitold, who had not been invited to take part in the negotiations, despatched ambassadors to the Emperor, demanding his aid in obtaining redress fi'om the knights. His envoys were informed that the Emperor could have no communication with him, as he was a declared enemy of the Christian religion, by having called in the alliance of the heathen Russians and Tartars to destroy the cham* pions of that holy faith. After the settlement of the armistice, the Emperor called upon the Polish King and the Grand Master to lay before him their grounds of mutual complaint. Jagello maintained that Driesen, which had been purchased by the Order, had belonged from time immemorial to Poland; Von Jimgingen, on the other hand, produced documents by which it was proved that the family Von der Ost had possessed it, for more than a century, as a fief of Branden- burg. As regards the complaint that the Grand Master had not fulfilled his promise at Kauen, not to increase his power in the district of Santok, he stated that its' inhabitants maintained that it had always belonged to the Neumark, and that they were determined to risk everything to prevent their separation, and, as he held the Neumark as a pledge, he was compelled to return it in its original extent, should the Emperor Sigismund redeem it. In 46 HISTORY OP PRUSSIA. answer to the charge that Prussian officials had pre- vented Polish merchants conveying their merchan- dise to the sea coast through the territory of the Order, the Grand Master replied that this restric- tion should cease the moment similar rights were granted to Prussians. Von Jungingen further stated that the reason he forbade the export of horses to Poland was, that there did not exist in Prussia a sufficient number of animals for the requirements of the Order, but that he had never forbidden the export of armour to Poland. Touch- ing the restoration of the territory which Duke Semowit had pledged to the knights, the Grand Master stated that he was perfectly ready to give them up, on the sum being paid for their redemp- tion ; and, as a proof that the knights had no desire to occupy them permanently, he informed the Emperor that the revenues received from them had been regarded as instalments of the money for which they had been pledged. After .mature deliberation, King Wenceslaus gave the following decision at Prague: that all former documents or treaties should bo valid ; that each of the contracting parties should remain for ever in possession of all the territory and rights each possessed prior to the breaking out of hostilities ; that the Order should restore Dobrin and receive Samogitia ; and that neither party should seek the alliance of infidels for the pui-pose of attacking one another. The Polish envoys declined to adhere to the DECISON OF WKNOl'ISLAUS. 47 (locisiou of Wcnceslaus, althougli their king had solemnly promised to obey it. This conduct proved but too clearly that Jagello had resolved not to be bound by his engagements, unless he obtained his object. Wenceslaus, not wishing the renewal of the war, gave the King of Poland time to reconsider his refusal, his answer to be given by Wliitsuntide, but no Polish envoys appeared on the day ap- pointed. Wenceslaus informed the envoys of the Order that they had carried out all their engage* ments in accordance with the armistice, but that the King of Poland, by not accepting his judgment, had forfeited all right of demanding any concessions from the knights, Polish writers have done their utmost to prove that the King was prejudiced, and that he had an understanding vnth the Order to decide in their favour. Neither Jagello nor Vitold was prepared to com- mence war. The latter had availed liimself of the armistice to collect a numerous force of Russians and Tartars, and the King of Poland had managed to entice a large number of mercenary Germans and Bohemians into the ranks of his army. Towards the end of May the Grand Master received infor- mation from the governor of the Neumark that the Poles had taken the field in strength, and were thre£ttening Driesen, and that they had collected numerous boats for the passage of the Netze. This intelligence of the forward movement of the Polish army was confirmed by a report from the Comthur 48 HISTORY OP PRUSSIA. of Slochau, on tlie 13th of June, that ho was in hourly expectation of an attack. On the 13th of May the Grand Master had issued a decree, calling on every able-bodied man in Prussia to be ready to march at a moment's notice. The Order was not only reinforced by a body of German knights, but also received considerable sums of money from various allies to assist in carrying on the war. The Bishops of Liefland and Courland were also sum* moned with their retainers. Ukich von Jungingen assembled his army near Swetz, where the envoys of Wenceslaus and Sigis* mund succeeded in bringing about a ten days' armis« tice. The King of Poland, who never really trusted Vitold, became so alarmed, and showed so much incapacity, that the direction of state affairs had to be given over to the Archbishop of Gnesen^ and the command of the army to Zindramus de Moscho- wykze, assisted by a military council. The Polish army numbered in all about .163,000, consisting of 60,000 Poles, 21,000 Bohemian and German mercenaries, a corps of 42,000 Lithuanians, and 40,000 Russians and Tartars, besides 60 pieces of heavy artillery*. In vain did Vitold, on his knees, entreat the pusillanimous King not to dis- grace himself in the eyes of his country; he only replied with tears and lamentations. Vitold, * These numbers, which we give as we find them in the old historians, are probably exaggerated. BATTLE OF TANNENBEBG. 49 enraged, left him, and took command of the left wing of the army. The Grand Master, before the battle, sent the Marshal, Frederick von Wallenrode, to the King with two double-handed swords, one dipped in blood and the other unstained, requesting that, if he desired peace, he would accept the latter, and, if not, the former. The King took both in his hands, with the remark that he receiyed them as a favour- able omen, inasmuch as the vanquished always tenders his sword to the victor. After some hours passed in devotion, he seems to have sumyioned sufficient strength of mind to give orders for a for- ward movement. Having destroyed Gilgenberg, the Polish army massed itself for the purpose of march- ing against Marienburg. To prevent this move- ment, the Grand Master, at the head of 83,000 men, with a considerable train of artillery, determined to risk a battle- at Tannenberg, July 15, 1410, and drew up his army in three ranks to the south of the village Griinwald. The right wing of the first line rested on a wood, the left on the village of Tannenberg ; the second was parallel to the first ; the third line was composed of two distinct corps, which served as reserves, in the vicinity of Grtinwald. Both wings of the first rank were protected by advanced bodies of troops. Another corps remained behind to guard the camp at Trogenau. Just before the engagement a Bohemian knight, VOL. II. e 50 HI8T0BY OF PUUSSIA. named Methodius von Trautenau, with 800 cavalry, offered his services to the Grand Master, who, fear- ing treachery, sent a refusal. The Bohemian then went over to Jagello, who also declined, and ordered him to take up a position at some distcmce, and not to take part in the battle. That the spirit of the mercenaries of the Polish army was not good, was proved by the fcict that 300 Bohemians, who had not received their pay, attempted to desert to the Order. Jagello himself anticipated a defeat, for we are told he kept himself out of the reach of danger in a concealed spot, and had relays of horses ready should he require them. The Grand Master opened the engagemient with a murderous fire from his artillery, hoping to shake the ranks of his opponents. Believing he had effected this, a general attack was ordered along the entire line. For some time both armies fought without gaining ground, but the Lithuanians and Tartar allies, who were stationed on the left flank, at length began to waver. The Grand Master perceiv- ing this, at once reinforced his right, and in a very short time Vitold's contingent fled in wild confusion from the field, and he himself, unable to rally the fugitives, returned' to assist the King, whom he in- duced to leave his place of concealment. The knights lost a great advantage by continuing the pursuit of the Lithuanians, instead of attacking the flank and front of the Poles. Already the principal standard of the Polish army was laid low, and that DEATH OP ULRICH YON JUNGINGEN. ol of the King's body-guard had been carried to the rear for security, when numerical superiority at last began to tell on the troops of the Order, and gradu- ally they were forced to give way. At this critical juncture the knights who had been in pursuit re- turned, and at once reinforced their comrades. The reserve corps then came into action, and advanced on the spot occupied by the King and his guards. Unfortunately at this moment the Grand Master, who had received several wounds, fell, slain by a Tartar, who despoiled him of his long beard. The remnant of the army, disheartened by this calamity and overpowered by numbers, retreated, leaving on the field 40,000 men. The Poles are estimated to have lost upwards of 60,000. Duke Casimir of Pomerania, Conrad von Oels, and the Knight Reggersdorf , commander of the mercenaries, were taken prisoners. The victory appears to have been due, in great measure, to the Bohemians, who had been eye-witnesses of the battle, and only took part in it when they perceived that the deci- sive moment had arrived. Writers censure the Grand Master for having brought up his reserve, and are of opinion that he ought to have preserved this intact, and retired on his camp covered by his numerous artillery ; but it is probable that, finding it impossible to disentangle his troops, he had no other resource than to risk all, hand to hand, and trust to the bravery of his knights. Jagello appeara not to have behaved with great e2 52 HISTOBT OF PRUSSIA. • severity to his prisoners, who are said to have amounted to 40,000. The principal officers were interned in different Polish castles, and the common soldiers were allowed to return to their homes, after having given their word of honour as soldiers that they would present themselves at Cracow on a certain day. The extraordinary fatigue which the Polish army had undergone, together with the numerous losses it had experienced, prevented Jagello from appear- ing before Marienburg until seven days after his victory. This valuable time enabled Heinrich von Plauen, Comthur of Swetz, a veteran soldier of the Order, to reinforce Marienburg with 4,000 men, and prepare for the expected siege. He was shortly after joined by 4,000 sailors from Dantzic, together with a number of fugitives. Rather than that the town should fall into the hands of the Poles, he burned it with its suburbs to the ground, having previously conveyed all the valuables and provisions to the castle. The basement or ground floor of the stronghold was defended by 1,000 men, under the conmiand of Von Plauen, a namesake and cousin of the commandant. The first story was defended by 2,000 men, under Gilmach von Zepfen, and the upper part of the castle by the rest of the garrison, under the commandant himself. The first result of Jagello's victory was the ap- pearance in his camp of envoys sent by the Bishop of Ermland to offer his obedience, and the Bishops gEll^BICH VON t»LAU£K. .^3 of Samland and Culm also submitted. Jagello ordered all the distinguished officers who had f alleil on both sides to be buried together at the church of Tannenberg, and he released the wounded, whom he treated like his own soldiers. As a mark of respect to the memory of Von Jungingen, he sent his body to Osterrode for interment in the vault of the Grand Masters. Vitold did not treat his captives so leniently. He ordered the Comthur of Brandenburg and Mar- quard von Salzbach to be beheaded, it is said in revenge for some old insult which he had nursed in his memory. The strongholds in the possession of the knights at this time were Rheden, Dantzic, Schlochau, Swetz, Brandenburg, Balga, Ragnit, and Memel. Heinrich von Plauen after the death of the Grand Master had been elected Stadtholder. The Poles soon occupied the ruins of the town of Maxienburg, but they were unable to surround the castle, the knights having destroyed the bridge over the Nogat. On the 26th of July, Jagello issued a proclamation from his camp, calling on the inhabitants of Prussia to swear allegiance to him, either personally or by letter, an order which appears to have been univer- sally obeyed. The Stadtholder finding, after several weeks' defence, that further resistance would be useless, resolved to treat with the King, and accord- ingly, on August 1, repaired to his camp, whore Heinrich offered to restore to Poland all the con- 54 kiSTORY'OF PRUSSIA. quered telritory. Jagello appears to have been wilKng to 'accept the conditions, but his councillors overruled, and by their advice he demanded the annexation of all Prussia, the knights having the option either to submit or quit the country. The Stadtholder answered that in making his ofiEer he had gone as far as honour would permit, and, after this humiliation, he believed that God and the Virgin would still preserve the Order. The Stadtholder, finding the King inexorable, retraced his steps to Marienburg with a determina- tion to hold out to the last. It appears extraor- dinary in this invasion of Prussia that the supremacy of Jagello was acknowledged by all classes. Town after town sent deputies, tendering to him their allegiance, and we are told that both sexes vied with each other in discarding their former costume and adopting that of Poland. This wholesale submission enabled Jagello to bestow the confiscated property of the knights upon his followers, and give into their hands the principal posts of the government. One of the towns most indebted to the Order was Elbing, yet so ready was it to acknowledge the conqueror, that tlie citizens actually expelled the governor of the fortress, and presented Jagello with a magnificent set of silver plate, which the com- mandsmt was unable to carry off with him. Dantzic did not behave much better ; the people undertook not to disturb tlie garrison, provided it evacuated the fortifications after the fall of Marienburg. SIEQB OF MABIENfiUfid. 55 On the return of Heinrich von Plauen to Marienburg, in order to counteract rumours of bad success, he ordered it to be proclaimed by flourish of trumpets that the King of Hungary was marching to the relief of the castle. He also managed to con- vey to the Comthurs of Dantzic, Swetz, and Schlo- chau, through a disguised priest of the Order, the sum of 30,000 ducats for the purpose of raising mercenaries. The Poles in vain attempted to sur- round the castle, as Von Plauen, under cover of his superior artillery, made constant sorties; besides this, the want of discipline in the Polish army and tlieir usual excesses soon produced a great amount of sickness amongst them. They also suffered con- siderably from want of provisions, as a disease which broke out amongst the horses at that time made the army dependent upon manual labour for the conveyance of stores. That Sigismund must have entered into some arrangement to assist the knights is evident from the fact that the Dantzigers, by order of the Com- thur prior to the battle of Tannenberg, gave his envoys the sum of 20,000 marks to raise mercenaries in aid of the Order, although they readily gave in their allegiance to the Polish Eang. In a very short time the Polish people were alarmed by the rumours of Sigismund's intended advance into Poland, and as their entire army was absent in Prussia, they de- manded that Jagello should detach a sufficient force from his army to protect his own territory. A fresh cause of alarm arose from the fact that the governor of Liefland, Conrad Wittinghoff, having collected a small but well-disciplined force, had marched to the relief of Marienburg, and that Vitold with his corps had been ordered to check his advance. Conrad, knowing the ambitious disposition of his opponent, requested an interview, in which he oflFered him the independent sovereignty of Lithuania, together with that of Samogitia, Vitold, who had always aspired to become an independent prince, and in fact to succeed to the Polish throne, undertook to do his utmost to raise the siege of Marienburg. It was accordingly arranged that Conrad Wittinghoff should proceed to the camp of the King, accompanied by fifty knights, and request a free passage for himself and followers to Marien- burg, under the specious pretext that he intended informing the Stadtholder that no relief could be expected, and thereby bring about the surrender. Jagello consented, and, after an interview between Wittinghoff and Von Plauen, it was determined that the former should return to the King, expressing his regret that he had been unsuccessful. The King, whose fears as to the safety of the army had been worked upon by Vitold, now expressed his readiness to accept the terms offered by the Stadt- holder, who however now refused to abide by his former proposal. Vitold's troops were suffering from dysentery, and under this plea he withdrew from the siege, and shortly after returned to Lithu- R£TB£AT OF JAOELLO. 57 ania, his example being followed by the Duke of Masovia. Several of the Polish nobles also, who wished to place their booty in some place of safety, now retired to their country. The besieged were suffering considerably, and they had only sufficient food for fourteen days ; but before that period elapsed the King of Poland, pressed by these losses, raised the siege September 19, 1410, by the advice of Andreas von Thaczin, one of his principal nobles. It is said that the Bohemian mercenaries offered to deliver Marienburg into the hands of the Poles for the sum of 40,000 gulden, but the King, although in possession of a large quantity of booty, had not sufficient ready money to pay the traitors. No sooner had the King of Poland passed the Vistula and Nessau than he disbanded his army, that is to say, he could no longer keep them together ; in fact, it was with the greatest difficulty that he retained a sufficient number to protect the frontiers. The Stadtholder now commenced col- lecting all his available forces for the purpose of regaining possession of his lost strongholds. Dantzic opened its gates to its former masters. Michael Kuchmeister was despatched to besiege Tauchel, but was defeated with heavy loss by the Poles at Crone. The latter, however, unaccountably retired without following up their success, and the commandant, fearing that Kuchmeister would bo reinforced, surrendered on condition that the garrison should retreat unmolested to Poland. The Order 58 HISTORY OF PBUSSlA. now received considerable reinforcements, under the command of Johann Eglosstein, Bishop of Wurz- burg, and Johann von Munsterburg, Duke of Silesia; and with some of these troops the stronghold of Tauchel was garrisoned. Jagello in rain attempted to induce the Prussians by promises or threats to remain faithful to him; they now displayed the same eagerness to submit to the Order as they had formerly shown in throwing off their allegiance to it. Before narrating the events which succeeded the battle of Tannenberg, it is necessary to give some accoimt of the Order and its internal organization at this period. The following were the most im- portant officers: — The Gross Comthur (Commendatur magnus) ; the Land MarschaJl, commander-in-chief in war ; the Oberster Spittler, who had the super- intendence of the hospitals, assisted in his duties by minor officials. His seat was at Elbing. The Trapierer had the superintendence of the stores and armoury, and took care that the poorer mem- bers of the Order were duly supplied with clothes and provisions. The Treasurer always accompanied the Grand Master with the insignia of his office ; his seal represented a key in the hand. The Grand Master was also attended by the Campan or Companion, whose duty it was to see personally all who sought an audience. The following were inferior in rank : — the Com- INTERNAL ORGANISATION. ^9 tliur, Land Comthur, House Comthur, Marshal of the Horse, who superintended the studs; the Steward, who controlled the domains ; the Ranger, who had charge of the forests; and the Superintendent of the fisheries. The brothers were also divided into several classes. Some of them lived in the convents, which each contained twelve knights and six priests, amongst whom Werner von Orseln established a species of ecclesiastical discipline. The Grand Master possessed almost absolute power, and was only responsible to the Order, by which alone he could be deposed ; for the delibera- tion of momentous questions he was bound to call a General Chapter, sometimes as many as 800 knights assembling on such occasions. Questions of peace and war rested with an assembly of the Chapter. The Bishop of Ermland tried to make himself independent of the Order by drawing up a military constitution for his see, but this attempt failed. The Order assessed all imposts ; it is not certain whether the nobles and burghers were consulted, but it is probable that the Order asked consent of both land-owners and ecclesiastics before imposing a new tax. The Order had also extensive private domains, especially in Samogitia and in the Neu- mark. A good revenue was derived from the tolls, and also by the imposition of a pf undzoU (poundage), that is, a tax on all ships and on all goods entering the harbours and conuiiercial towns. This tax was 60 HI8T0RY 01* t^fiUSSlA. very rarely suspended, and, with skilful management, yielded a large return. A yery considerable revenue was also afforded by the fisheries. It would seem that the domains held by the knights were increased by the owners of estates frequently dying intestate or without issue, a consequence either of the con- stant wars or of the irregular life led by those who had received fiefs. The revenue amounted to 800,000 marks, equal to 1,600,000 Hungarian gulden. The members of the Order enjoyed the following advantages : — ^board, lodging, clothing, military out- fit, and the possession of a certain number of horses. Those who resided in the convents appear to have been compelled to submit to certain restrictions as regards diet and amusement, and we have already seen that Ulrich von Jungingen imposed regulations in order to check growing luxury among the brother- hood, and which were specially directed to the number of horses allowed to each knight. The legislative power and administration of justice were vested in the Grand Master and the Order. The bishops had probably a voice by right of territory, especially since the Bishop of Ermland had raised himself to the rank of prince, and nearly succeeded in making himself independent. In ecclesiastical matters, the prelates exercised a certain authority in making laws and arrangements; yet prior to the battle of Tannenberg we never hear of a synod having been summoned by a bishop. INTERNAL ORGANIZATION. 61 The towns also had authority, by right of their privileges, to enact local laws and impose local taxation ; also over trade licences, police arrange- ments, the defence of the town, and the supply of municipal garrisons. The Teutonic Order may be truly regarded as the first Government which possessed a regular standing army ; in fact, the present organization of district command is only a development of the old system. In the towns the Haus Comthur sat on the bench ; in country places the Comthur, who, assisted by some local man of rank or position, decided all ordinary cases. Certain towns, such as Elbing, Braunsberg, Tannenberg, and Memel, held their own Court of Appeal ; but in criminal matters the Orfler reserved to itself the power of imposing punishments and granting pardons. Although each locality enacted its own municipal police laws and arrangements, yet the Order retained its rights of occasionally interfering and imposing special restric- tions ; for instance, in cases of epidemic disease, or in matters for the regulation of the standard of weights and measures. The Grand Master had the power of conferring the rank of knight, but it is not certain whether he also appointed the notaries. In a document of the year 1342, of the Grand Master LudoU Konig, there occur the following words, \"Paulus et Johannes notarii nostri\" — ^Paul and John, our notaries, but it is not quite clear that this refers to the Grand Master. 62 HISTORY OF PRUSSIA. It will be hereafter seen how, after the battle of Tannenberg, this extraordinary brotherhood lost much of its influence in Northern Europe, whilst the order of knighthood became so common, that it fell in estimation and lost its original significance. The trade which had hitherto passed through the Prussian territory began to be absorbed by the Por- tuguese and Dutch, who conveyed their goods by other channels. In consequence also of the largo standing axmy of foreign mercenaries, who were always ready to seize provisions in lieu of pay, corn became scarce, for the agriculturists only cultivated sufficient for their own private consumption. The coinage also became depreciated, and foreign mer- chants did not care to send corn to the Prussian market. The union of Poland and Lithuania under one sovereign also contributed to diminish the power of the Teutonic Knights, who were now obliged to impose heavy taxes upon their subjects to meet the great expenses incurred by the hiring of foreign mercenaries, ever ready to give their services to the highest bidder. As the position of the Order became more and more embarrassing, it was obliged, by underhand means, to seek the assistance of the Pope, especially as the ecclesiastics began to reassert their former authority. Added to this, minor States, which had hitherto borne with impatience the yoke of the Order, began now to assert their independence, and to claim distinct constitutional rights.

The knights having now expelled the Poles, the Stadtholder convoked a Grand Chapter, which unanimously raised him to the dignity of Grand Master on the 9th of November, 1410. : No sooner had Jagello heard of Von Plauen's election than he despatched to him on the 25th of November a letter of congratulation, expressing his desire to be on friendly terms with the Order ; and this official document was accompanied by a private communication, promising him his support 64 HISTORY OF PRUSSIA. « in case his authority should be resisted. From this it appears that Jagello had received secret informa- tion of disunion among the knights. Von Plauen replied that, as Jagello had not obeyed the Pope*s injunction, and was enlisting mercenaries, he would be forced to do the same, and the war was thus con- tinued. Stein and Mohrungen, two strongholds held by the Poles, surrendered to Plauen, and the town of iThom again submitted, a number of citizens who remained loyal to the Order having compelled its surrender by a successful revolt. Sigismund's army, under the command of Stibor, had now advanced into Poland, placing the King in a perilous position; but the invaders met with several re- verses, which, together with the disunion amongst the knights, now becoming more apparent, induced the Grand Master to listen to those who counselled the necessity of peace. But the terms offered by Jagello were so humiliating, that the Grand Master could not accept them; a short time afterwards, however, through the medium of Vitold, Von Plauen concluded* a month's armistice at Thorn, the castle of which was still held by the Poles. Jagello availed himself of the armistice to increase the number of his mercenaries, and to raise fresh levies among his Polish subjects. Von Plauen, on the other hand, * issued a proclamation to all the* princes of Europe, describing the exhausted con- dition of Prussia, and exposing the ambitious designs of the King of Poland against the independence of PEACaS OF THORN, 65 the country. The Grand Master was also in com- munication with Vitold, urging him to ally himself with the Order, and guaranteeing to assist him in becoming the independent sovereign of Lithuania. Jagello, hearing that strong reinforcements were advancing to the assistance of the Order, determined to intercept them; and accordingly marched on Thorn with a numerous army for the purpose of surrounding the Grand Master's forces. Vitold, foreseeing the destruction of all his ambitious hopes, made common cause with the envoys of the Emperor and the Pope in persuading Jagello to come to terms with the knights. The King of Poland, fearing that his chief supporters, the bishops, might go against him, agreed to and concluded a peace on the Ist of February, 1411, on an island of the Vis- tula, near Thorn. The conditions were highly advantageous to the knights, being the immediate cessation of hostilities ; a mutual exchange of all prisoners, the Grand Master paying the sum of 15,000 marks ready money; all conquests during the war to be restored, and the inhabitants to bo allowed to renounce the oath of allegiance to Poland; Samogitia to be ceded to Vitold and Jagello during their lives; Duke Semowit of Masovia to receive back without payment the district of Zobra, pledged by him to the Order. The above were the main articles of the treaty. As regards the possession of Driesen and Santok, the King of Poland and the Grand Master agreed to leave the decision of the VOL. n. / 66 HISTOBY OF PBUSSIA. dispute to the arbitration of twelve commissioners, with the option of a final appeal to the Pope. A similar arrangement was made concerning any dis- pute between the knights, Vitold, and Jagello. These two princes xmdertook to renounce their alliance with the heathens, in forcibly converting whom the three parties were to make common cause. All Prussians who had sided with the enemy received full pardon, except the Bishop of Ermland. Finally it was agreed that, should Sigismund desire to become a party to the treaty, he was to be allowed to do so. The treaty was finally ratified on a plain near Slotoria. The King of Poland also concluded a truce for eight months with the King of Hungary, and the Lithuanian and Polish armies withdrew to their own territory. The first difficulty which the Grand Master had to grapple with was the imme- diate payment of the Polish indemnity, although he had received about this time a sum of 25,419 nobles from the King of England for losses the Prussians had experienced at the hands of English cruisers. The treasury, indeed, had become nearly exhausted from the large amount of money paid to the merce- naries on being dismissed. It had been hoped that a compromise for this payment might be effected, as the Pope had formerly declared that the war was an unjust one. During the time the Poles held possession of Prussia they had despoiled most of the churches of their valuables, and this it was also trusted would be regarded at Rome as part pa3nnent VIOLATION OP THE TREATY, 67 of the indemnity ; but the moment the treaty was ratified, Jagello, who was himself in great pecuniary difficulties, managed to raise a sum of money, which he despatched to the Holy See to propitiate the Pope in his f ayour ; nor was he deceived in the result, for when the question came on for the decision of John XXIII., that Pontiff declared that the war was justifiable, and that the articles taken from the Church were the lawful property of the King of Poland. The Grand Master was the first to break one of the principal articles of the treaty, viz, that past offences should be forgiven ; for, brought up in the school of obedience, he could not overlook the want of it in others. He accordingly severely punished all the principal officials who had betrayed their trust during the Polish invasion ; and several of the offenders were executed without trial. Many of the knights had sullied the honour of the Order by their pusillanimity »and cupidity during the invasion of Prussia, Some, after having actually collected all the valuables they could find, fled the country; some surrendered important strongholds without the least resistance ; and Von Plauen knew that, unless he made a severe example of the delin- quents, he never would be able to restore the morale which had once been so conspicuous. The Bishop of Ermland, finding himself excepted in the treaty, fled to Dantzic and thence to Lubeck, and the bishopric was handed over to the charge of /2 68 HISTORY OP PRUSSIA. a certain Count von Schwartzburg, who appointed one Lucas von Gelf enstein collector of the revenue. In the space of a few years this official paid into the exchequer of the Order the large sum of 58,000 marks, which he was the more easily enabled to do, inasmuch as the bishop had, by his treachery, saved his see from Polish spoliation. Financial difficulties increased every day, owing to the demands made by the Bohemian and Hun- garian mercenaries, to whom back pay was stiU du"
