        "text": "BUSINESS BRIEFING\n\nNEWS IN BRIEFIN A ground-breaking move, the European Commission has sent an official warning to the German post office for allegedly carrying out anti-competitive practices. In a letter to Deutsche Post AG, the Directorate-General for competition (DGIV) declared that it was minded to uphold a complaint from United Parcel Services (UPS) that the post office was using predatory pricing to kill off competition in the package delivery market. DGIV claimed that the low rates on offer to customers through the cross-subsidy from Deutsche Post’s monopoly services over the past 12 years “indicated an intention by DPAG to eliminate its competitors”. The complaint was filed in 1994 by UPS, which claimed that its attempts to compete on the German express delivery market had been undermined by Deutsche Post’s practices. The Commission plans to send a formal statement of objections to the post office in April.\n\nEU injects new dynamism into Asia relations\n\n“ASIA is our new common frontier,” declared French Foreign Minister Hervé de Charette when he explained earlier this month why EU foreign ministers were moving Asia up a few notches on their priority list.\n\nTurkey and EU try to rebuild shaky bridges\n\nFears are growing in Union capitals that Turkey is turning its back on Europe and aligning itself with its Islamic neighbours in the Middle East.\n\nBUSINESS BRIEFING\n\nNEWS IN BRIEFCOCA-COLA’s purchase of British bottling companyCoca-Cola SchweppesBeverages Ltd has been cleared by the European Commission after an in-depth probe under its merger rules. The Commission said the deal would merely transfer a dominant position from a joint venture between Coca-Cola and Schweppes to Coca-Cola on its own andtherefore could not be blocked under the rules.\n\nBusiness leaders tour China\n\nLAUNCHING an unprecedented private sector drive into China, Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan is taking 29 business leaders to Beijing next month for meetings with Chinese trade officials.\n\nBUSINESS BRIEFING\n\nNEWS IN BRIEFTHE creation of Europe’s biggest television company has been given the regulatorygo-ahead. The Commission’s clearance of the merger of Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Télédiffusion (CLT) and UFA – the broadcasting subsidiary of German publisher Bertelsmann – into a joint venture allows the formation of a major audio-visual company. After a short inquiry, the Commission found that the merger would not create a dominant position in any of the relevant markets. UFA owns, together with Canal+ and Kirch, the Premiere pay-TV station in Germany, but CLT has no pay-TV presence there. Moreover, while Kirch launched the digital pay-TV channel DF1 in July, CLT and UFA abandoned their plans to launch a competitor in the form of Club RTL. The strength of the Kirch group in television channels and film rights means that CLT-UFA will face major competition.\n\nBUSINESS BRIEFING\n\nNEWS IN BRIEFTHE European Commission has opened an investigation into the creation of the biggest wholesaler in Finland. The merger between Kesko Oy and Tuko Oy would create a marketing giant active in the wholesale and retail of daily consumer goods as well as speciality goods. The Finnish authorities asked the Commission to begin an inquiry since it had no jurisdiction in the absence of major sales revenue outside Finland. After an initial inquiry, the Commission found that the merger could foreclose the Finnish market to potential competitors as well as suppliers of consumer goods seeking to market products in Finland. The Commission now has four months to decide whether to allow or block the deal.\n\nTHE WEEK AHEAD\n\n26 July – 1 August 1996Friday 26 July\n\nBUSINESS BRIEFING\n\nNEWS IN BRIEFTHE European Commission has called for stronger global rules to tackle the creation of cartels and other anti-competitive practices that block access to markets. In a communication to the Council of Ministers, Commissioners Sir Leon Brittan (trade) and Karel Van Miert (competition) said the next ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organisation in December should consider these proposals. With a framework agreement, WTO signatories could adopt and enforce competition rules according to agreed principles. But they opposed the creation of an over-arching international competition authority.\n\nMarín seeks to expand dialogue with South Asia\n\nTHE European Commission is hoping to widen the Union’s links with Asia by moving quickly to reinforce ties with India and Pakistan.\n\nTHE WEEK AHEAD\n\n19-25 July 1996Friday 19 July"
