I argue that such a re-conceptualization of “public accountability” as an umbrella term blurs a crucial dimension of the original concept: the critical scrutiny of citizens and the collective evaluation of government through public debate. In this article I critically discuss the advance of managerial and administrative notions of accountability that accompanied the steep rise of the governance concept. I advocate a return to a conception of public accountability as accountability to the wider public. I investigate the prospects for such public accountability beyond the state, which depends upon the emergence of a transnational public sphere, consisting of media and organized civil society. The function of such a transnational public sphere is to put pressure on governance institutions in case of massive maladministration, and to make sure that emergent political concerns and demands are recognized in the process of international policy making.\n\nType\n\nSymposium on Global Democracy\n\nInformation\n\nEthics & International Affairs , Volume 24 , Issue 1 , Spring 2010 , pp. 45 - 67\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-7093.2010.00243.x [Opens in a new window]\n\nCopyright\n\nCopyright © Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs 2010\n\nAccess options\n\nGet access to the full version of this content by using one of the access options below.

While the technical term “accounting” in the financial context is perfectly translatable into other languages, “accountability” is not; see Melvin J. Dubnick, “Situating Accountability: Seeking Salvation for the Core Concept of Modern Governance” (manuscript, University of New Hampshire, 2007); available at mjdubnick.dubnick.net/papers/2007/Situacct031307.pdf (accessed November 23, 2009). If translation cannot be avoided it normally comes as a version of responsibility (e.g., responsabilidad in Spanish, responsabilité in French, Verantwortung in German). Responsibility is about good individual conduct, with a view to moral or religious duties, or legal obligations. What it does not convey is the idea of a contractual or fiduciary relationship between two social actors, in which an agent is regularly summoned to account by one or several principals.\n\n10\n\n10 John Roberts and Robert Scapens, “Accounting Systems and Systems of Accountability: Understanding Accounting Practices in Their Organisational Contexts,” Accounting, Organizations and Society 10, no. 4 (1985), p. 447.\n\n11\n\n11 Richard Mulgan, “‘Accountability’: An Ever-expanding Concept?” Public Administration 78, no. 3 (2000), p. 556.\n\n12\n\n12 Michael W.
