        "text": "In his new year’s speech, President Martti Ahtisaari presented a thorough evaluation of Finland’s international standing as an EU member. The president was satisfied with the outcome of the membership. He believed that Finland’s international position had been strengthened and that the country had gained recognition for its constructive approach. President Ahtisaari credited Finland for the growing interest of the EU for the North. Finland will continue to aim at making sure that focus is maintained on Russia and the Baltic Sea region in the EU’s external relations. The President expressed his support for Finland’s accession to the Economic and Monetary Union, and for EU enlargement. He was pleased with the fact that Parliament had almost unanimously passed the new Peacekeeping Act. He believed that the road to peace in the Balkans would be long and would require sacrifice. The President said the Russian parliamentary election had reinforced the development of democracy in the country. He also urged the Finnish people to stand up to racism and xenophobia.\n\nPrime Minister Paavo Lipponen was interviewed by the weekly magazine Suomen Kuvalehti. He stated that a continual strengthening of the EU is also in Finland’s interests. According to him, a more close cooperation will allow even the small member states to make their voices heard. Prime Minister Lipponen placed special importance on making the common foreign and security policy more efficient. For him, the current phase with the Monetary Union and the enlargement are just a foretaste of reforms to come. In the long run, a common government or an equivalent institution could possibly be expected. If the EU fails at fighting large-scale unemployment, the citizens’ trust in the Union will falter, the prime minister predicted. He said the double representation of Finland by the president and the prime minister had gone well. He considered that the arrangement was provisional, as in January the Finnish government will appoint a new committee to reform the constitution. It will come into force after the next presidential election.\n\nIn a meeting in the Russian town of Pskov, Finland, Russia and Estonia agreed on a work programme for the year 1996 concerning the Gulf of Finland. The programme includes a ministerial meeting, seminars, and a research programme consisting of about 70 projects. The focus will be on the funding and organising of environmental projects for the protection of the entire drainage basin of the Gulf of Finland. The programme also involves establishing a common conservation area in the archipelago of the Gulf’s eastern part. Some of the projects are related to transportation as well as agriculture and forestry.\n\nHelsingin Sanomat summarised an interview with President Ahtisaari that appeared originally in the newspaper The European. In the interview, the president expressed Finland’s desire to be among the first countries to join the EU’s Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). According to the president, the fundamental reason for Finland’s adherence to the EU was improving the country’s competitiveness. He believed that the EMU would further improve Finland’s competitiveness and make Finland even more attractive to foreign investors. President Ahtisaari admitted that public opinion in Finland is less enthusiastic about the EMU than about Finland’s EU membership. The president reckoned that the single currency is an emotional issue and demands much discussion. Ahtisaari is in favour of EU enlargement, because especially eastern enlargement is crucial for increasing European stability. He described Finland’s relations with Russia as more natural than those with the Soviet Union. The President was not worried about Russia’s nationalists or communists, but instead about nuclear security in Russia.\n\nThe President of Finland appointed a delegation for negotiations to remove visa requirements between Finland and Estonia. The delegation is led by Under-Secretary of State Heikki Talvitie. As the talks progress, Finland will be observing how two recent agreements made with Estonia are being implemented. One of the agreements concerns the returning of citizens residing in the other country without proper grounds; the other is about the cooperation of authorities in fighting crime.\n\nThe Finnish Defence Council is commissioning an extensive report from a group of officials. The report will outline Finland’s defence policy and the development of the Finnish Defence Forces until approximately the year 2010. Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Defence Pertti Nykänen is Chairman of the Defence Council. The work is expected to be completed by the end of 1996. Last autumn the Government submitted its report on security policy. The parliamentary committee that was suggested among others by the previous government’s defence minister Elisabeth Rehn, Speaker of the Parliament Riitta Uosukainen, and current defence minister Anneli Taina, will not be established. Based on this report, the Government will submit its own report to Parliament.\n\nPrime Minister Lipponen stated in an interview with Estonian newspaper Sõnumileht that leaving the Baltic States on their own as NATO enlarges is not a good idea. According to Lipponen, the Nordic countries are not capable of ensuring the security of these countries. The prime minister thus rejected the German initiative of a Nordic-Baltic defence alliance. Regarding the proposal by the Russian ambassador to Finland Yuri Deryabin on the neutrality of the Baltic States, Prime Minister Lipponen remarked that Finland has not been invited to advocate Estonia’s neutrality. The Prime Minister hoped that Estonia’s EU membership would soon be realised, because he considers it important for Finland’s security. Lipponen estimated that visa exemption between Finland and Estonia will materialise once the risks involved have been minimised.\n\nAt the opening of the National Defence Course in Helsinki, Minister of Defence Anneli Taina believed Parliament would handle the founding of a Finnish rapid deployment force as early as this spring. According to Taina, the founding of a rapid deployment force does not require a legal reform. Taina said he would present a report on this issue to the Parliament. According to the Ministry of Defence, the training of the rapid deployment force could begin in spring 1997 for a group of volunteers chosen from the July 1996 contingent of conscripts. While handling the Peacekeeping Act, Parliament approved a resolution that the potential establishment of a rapid deployment force must be brought separately to the Parliament for consideration. In its report, the Foreign Affairs Committee concurred. Chair of the Parliament Defence Committee Kalevi Lamminen said that Parliament had been purposely misled in the matter of the rapid deployment force. Party secretary of the Centre Party Pekka Perttula agreed. However, Speaker of the Parliament Uosukainen stated in an interview with newspaper Ilkka on 17.1. that \"the creation of a rapid deployment force will be introduced to the Parliament in one form or another, and it is for Parliament to decide on it”.\n\nPresident Ahtisaari visited Lithuania, where he met President Algirdas Brazauskas, Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius and Speaker of the Parliament Ceslovas Jursenas. During the visit, Ahtisaari stressed the EU’s significance for Europe’s stability and security. According to Ahtisaari, the goal is to make the Baltic Sea region as important in the EU as the Mediterranean region. President Ahtisaari also stated that Finland supports Lithuania’s pursuit of membership. Besides the EU, topics of discussion included security policy, the recent Lithuanian banking crisis, the refugee problem, the improvement of Lithuanian border control, and trade between the countries. During his visit, Ahtisaari gave a presentation at an economic seminar of the Finnish-Lithuanian Chamber of Commerce, and inaugurated the new residence of the Finnish ambassador in Vilna.\n\nThe Advisory Board for Defence Information (ABDI) published the results of an opinion poll concerning national defence. The poll was commissioned from Suomen Gallup in November-December 1995. The survey found that the Finnish people’s trust in Finland’s defence capability has grown. 55 percent of the population considered that Finland has good chances of defending itself in the event of a war fought with conventional weapons (the corresponding figures were 21 percent in 1978 and 40 percent in the 1980s). 37 percent thought the chances were bad. The majority of respondents based their trust on effective defence forces. Moreover, four out of five Finns were in favour of using military force for defence in all situations, even if the outcome is uncertain. The poll also indicated that 86 percent of Finns are ready to personally take part in defending their country if it comes under attack.\n\nPrime Minister Lipponen participated in a seminar held by the Bertelsmann Foundation in Bonn, where a number of current and former statesmen discussed the future of Europe behind closed doors. In discussions between Prime Minister Lipponen and Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn, it was affirmed that the relations between the two countries are close and warm. At the meeting, Lipponen brought up the wish of the Baltic States to start their EU accession negotiations as soon as possible, that is to say in the coming autumn at the same time with Malta and Cyprus. As for the Chancellor, he hoped Finland would be active with regard to the Baltic States and promote cooperation between them. Prime Minister Lipponen said he supports Russia’s membership in the Council of Europe, in spite of the events in Chechnya. Both Kohl and Lipponen gave their full support to the objectives of the third stage of the EMU. According to Lipponen, Kohl sees the monetary union project also from a political point of view: \"It is part of Europe’s historical development, which is about the consolidation of peace”.\n\nThe foreign ministers of Nordic countries held a meeting in Helsinki, hosted by Minister for Foreign Affairs Halonen. Some of the topics on the agenda were the situation in Bosnia, neighbouring area cooperation, EU issues, and Russia’s possible membership in the Council of Europe. Minister Halonen believed that all of the Nordic governments were in favour of Russia’s membership. Human rights issues in Burma, Burundi, Nigeria and China were also discussed. The question of human rights in China gained publicity as a television documentary on the conditions in Chinese children’s institutions was broadcast in the Nordic countries. The Ministers demanded that China allow access to international organisations and UN rapporteurs to examine the situation. The Nordic foreign ministers expressed their full support for Sweden’s candidacy for a seat in the UN Security Council next autumn when the new members are elected.\n\nIn Geneva, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child conducted an oral hearing of Finnish government representatives. The hearing concerned Finland’s first report on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, submitted in December 1994. The Committee commended Finnish child policy, especially the comprehensive health care and social services as well as education. Finland was criticised for not investigating the effects of budget cuts on the lives of children. The Committee recommended the authorities to establish a special monitoring system to ensure that all children benefit from the same basic social services regardless of municipality.\n\nPresident Ahtisaari addressed the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe as a guest. In his speech, he called for the admission of Russia as the 39th member country of the CoE. He said this would advance both democracy in Russia and stability in Europe. According to him, excluding Russia from the Council does not serve these purposes. Regarding the crisis in Chechnya, he stated that \"the democratic process needs time to take root”. Russian conditions, including the judicial system, are not up to European standards, and Ahtisaari was concerned about the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg – which already has a heavy workload – being overwhelmed by Russia’s membership. As a solution, the president suggested the appointment of a Council ombudsman who would work in close cooperation with the ombudsmen especially in the new member countries. President Ahtisaari also called for better protection of minorities.\n\nIn Strasbourg, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe accepted Russia as the 39th member of the organisation by a vote of 164 to 35. The final decision will be made in February by the Committee of Ministers comprising the representatives of the governments of CoE countries. Those opposed to Russian membership feared it would devaluate the accession criteria of an organisation focusing on human rights. Those in favour of Russia’s accession thought that rejecting the application might fuel nationalism in the country. Because of human rights issues related for instance to the crisis in Chechnya, the Council made a long list of requirements that Russia must meet in order to remain a member. The entire Finnish delegation supported Russia’s membership. Estonian media accused Finland of trying to pressure Estonia into also endorsing the membership.\n\nIn an interview published by newspaper Keskisuomalainen among others, Prime Minister Lipponen claimed that the core EU countries are pressuring Finland to join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) as a condition for participation in the EMU. According to the prime minister, Finland will be forced to take a position sooner than it wanted on the linking of the Finnish markka to the ERM. Lipponen’s statement was based on discussions between him and German Chancellor Kohl. On 28.1. in the MTV3 news, Lipponen sought to relieve the uncertainty caused by the linking of the markka to the ERM. He said: \"Finland’s view is that the stability of the Finnish markka is enough. The markka has been quite stable, and we are in no hurry to join the ERM as it is”. He also stated: \"We should wait for the major EU countries that are in the ERM to do something to stabilise the situation”.\n\nAt the 75thanniversary celebration of the Finnish Cadet and Officer Corps Association in Helsinki, Prime Minister Lipponen denied that Finland’s non-alliance is undermined by its willingness to adapt to the cooperation with NATO in the Bosnian operation or in the Partnership for Peace programme. He noted that the idea that \"Finnish officers would discuss the compatibility of procedures and materiel” has seemed foreign in Finland. The Prime Minister stated that the Government has no intention of changing \"a tried and tested foreign policy line”. According to him, the cooperation in Bosnia is used to build a new European system of security, where Finland has the same interests and goals as in the OSCE.\n\nIn Brussels, the EU foreign ministers’ meeting approved the new regulation for the TACIS programme which provides grant finance for cooperation with the CIS countries and Mongolia. The new rules permit the gathering of funding from several sources, and the duration of the programme is extended to four years from the current two. In addition, there is a new emphasis on cross-border cooperation between Finland and Russia. The reformed programme will appropriate an estimated one billion markka of EU money to the Finnish-Russian cooperation. The three main targets for the funding are the environment, the improvement of nuclear power plants, and education. Minister for Foreign Affairs Halonen and Minister for European Affairs Norrback were very satisfied with the adoption of the programme.\n\nOpposition leader, Chairman of the Centre Party Esko Aho visited Brussels, where he met the President of the European Commission Jacques Santer and five members of the Commission. The theme of the visit was the EMU, which the President of the Commission and its members strongly believed would materialise. The discussions did not convince Aho. He said he could not \"believe that all the preconditions for the EMU, namely the convergence criteria, the timeframe and the joining of certain key countries like France, could occur at the same time”.\n\nThe President of Finland appointed the new National Coalition Party ministers. Minister of Justice Sauli Niinistö became Minister of Finance, and MP Kari Häkämies was appointed Minister of Justice. Finance Minister Iiro Viinanen’s resignation from the Government was accepted on 2.2., and he became President of the insurance group Pohjola. At their press conference, ministers Niinistö and Häkämies assured that they would continue their predecessors’ line. Niinistö did not think the timeframe of the EU’s Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) would be delayed.\n\nAccording to a preliminary estimate, Finland’s participation in the Implementation Force (IFOR) enforcing the Bosnia-Herzegovina Peace Agreement will cost 262,3 million markka. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence have been allowed to exceed their budgets because of the Bosnian operation. At this stage, 120 million markka will be allocated to the Ministry of Defence, and 50 million to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The amount of appropriation needed for the operation will be determined when the Government presents this year’s supplementary budget.\n\nSpeaking at the 1996 opening of the parliamentary session, President Ahtisaari looked back at the economic and foreign policy events of the past year. In foreign policy, he regarded the enlargement process of the EU as the continuation of European integration. In his view, Finland has played a part in the way the Union has adopted Nordic issues and enlargement as its key goals. Ahtisaari also stressed the significance of the TACIS programme, which involves the EU, the CIS countries and Mongolia, for Finland, as well as Finland’s efforts in the adoption of the programme. Ahtisaari also emphasised the importance of the Baltic Sea as an EU inland sea. According to the president, the Nordic countries support the integration pursuits of the Baltic States. He underscored the EU’s role in stabilising Europe. Furthermore, he remarked that Russia’s actions e.g. in the Caucasus highlight the need for a stronger bond between Russia and the rest of Europe. The admission of Russia to the Council of Europe shows, he argued, that there is a will to support the democratisation of Russia as an essential part of a stable Europe.\n\nChair of the Parliament Foreign Affairs Committee Pertti Paasio submitted his report on Finnish development cooperation to Prime Minister Lipponen. Paasio argued that Finland’s development assistance should be substantially increased, because the sudden reduction of aid has harmed Finland’s credibility. Paasio proposed four options for reaching again the UN target, 0.7 percent of gross national product, in the next few years. Although the Lipponen Government is in principle committed to this goal, it has frozen the markka amount of development assistance for the entire term of government. Paasio called for the reversal of the freezing decision. In his view, poverty reduction is the main objective of development cooperation. He considered the extensive use of interest subsidies in development cooperation to be an export incentive that distorts competition.\n\nPresident of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma and his wife made an official visit to Finland. During his visit, President Kuchma met President Ahtisaari, Prime Minister Lipponen, and representatives of industry, and visited the Finnish Parliament. The discussions dealt with Ukraine’s relations with the European Union, the EU’s trade policy that benefits both countries, and the situation in Russia. Kuchma also spoke at the Paasikivi Society, where he told about Ukraine’s eagerness for economic cooperation with Finland in order to improve the safety of Russian-built nuclear reactors. In addition, Kuchma inaugurated the Ukrainian embassy in Helsinki. During the visit, an agreement was also signed between Finland and Ukraine on early notification of nuclear accidents.\n\nUnited States Secretary of State Warren Christopher, coming to Finland to meet the new Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, arrived a day early so that he could also meet Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma who was visiting Finland, on 8 February. Secretary Christopher met also with President Ahtisaari, and they discussed the situation in former Yugoslavia and Finland’s experience of EU membership. Foreign Minister Primakov also met President Ahtisaari, Prime Minister Lipponen and Foreign Minister Halonen during his visit. Foreign Minister Halonen stated that Finnish-Russian relations are still on firm ground even after the change of foreign minister. The topics under discussion were bilateral relations, the EU, the Council of Europe, the situation in former Yugoslavia, and Baltic-Russian relations. In his talks with the U.S. Secretary of State on 9-10 February, Foreign Minister Primakov restated the Russian position: NATO expansion into Soviet-era ally countries. However, he said Russia is ready for negotiations to find a solution that satisfies all parties. Secretary Christopher stressed that the U.S. remains committed to a \"gradual and transparent” enlargement of the Western military alliance. The Helsinki talks were conducted in a constructive spirit.\n\nIn an interview with the newspaper Ilkka, Centre Party Chairman Esko Aho hoped that the third stage of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) would not be implemented. He thought it would be best if the EU member states concluded in the spring of 1998 that the implementation of the EMU is not feasible. In Aho’s view, the best time for deciding the Centre Party’s EMU position would be the summer 1998 party congress. In a decision by the party council last autumn, EMU membership was not ruled out. In an interview with Radio Suomi, Prime Minister Lipponen urged the Centre Party to announce its position on whether Finland should seek to join the EMU. A negative answer would mean that the Centre Party is further distancing itself from Europe’s development.\n\nMinister of Foreign Affairs of Armenia Vahan Papazyan made an official visit to Finland. He met among others President Ahtisaari and Minister for Foreign Affairs Halonen. The visit was related to Finland’s participation in the so-called Minsk Group, chaired by Finland and Russia, which leads the Nagorno-Karabakh peace negotiations. Mr Papazyan found that Finland has acted in a very positive balancing way in the negotiations. If the cooperation between Russia and the OSCE in Nagorno-Karabakh is successful, the model could perhaps be applied in other post-Soviet crisis areas. The Armenian foreign minister said his country wishes to deepen its relationship with the EU, and hoped Finland would support Armenia as it seeks full membership in the Council of Europe.\n\nThe ministers for Nordic cooperation assembled in Helsinki, where they decided in principle to abolish 13 Nordic institutions and cooperative bodies in their present form. In most cases the institutions or cooperative bodies to be abolished will continue their activities in the form of various projects. In Finland’s case, the decision affects four institutions. The ministers envisaged the creation of three new institutions focused on research and culture. The list of reforms is next on the agenda of the parliamentarians of Nordic countries. The reforms will come into effect with the adoption of the 1997 budget for Nordic cooperation. The ministers also discussed the combining of the secretariats of the Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers.\n\nDenmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden are planning the first joint Nordic peacekeeping exercise in northern Norway in the Tromsø region in spring 1997 (on 20-30 May). The exercise is called \"Nordic Peace 97”. Norway is hosting the exercise in the spirit of the Partnership for Peace programme. Norway also participates with the largest number of troops. The other Nordic countries plan to participate with roughly company-strength units each. The exercise will be carried out under joint Nordic command. The exercise takes place in a conflict situation between imaginary states, in which the UN has requested the Nordic countries to join a peacekeeping mission to prevent the spread of the crisis. In the exercise, the Nordic peace forces will be assigned traditional peacekeeping and humanitarian aid tasks.\n\nWith regard to an upcoming report on defence policy, the Parliament Defence Committee demanded that Minister of Defence Anneli Taina explain how the contribution of Parliament to the report would be guaranteed. In January, the Finnish Defence Council appointed a group of officials headed by Pertti Nykänen, Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Defence, to draw up an analysis outlining Finnish defence policy and the development of the Finnish Defence Forces until the year 2010. According to the Defence Committee, the entire Parliament and the Committee itself have repeatedly called for the establishment of a parliamentary body to plan future defence policy.\n\nThe Parliament Grand Committee dealing with EU matters criticised a government report on the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The Committee found that the study, prepared at the Economics Department of the Ministry of Finance, was one-sided, vague, and avoided the problems of the EMU. The government-approved report answers questions posed by the Grand Committee on the EMU Stage Three. The Government opposed the creation of a countercyclical fund to support the EMU, pointing out for instance that administration costs would be increased. Some MPs held that a more detailed analysis of the question of the funds and of unemployment should have been carried out. In addition to the funds, the report dealt with issues such as the EMU criteria, the economic policy coordination between member states, and the liability regime concerning the European Central Bank.\n\nAt an event held in Kajaani by the UKK-perinneyhdistys (an association dedicated to the legacy of President Kekkonen), Minister for Foreign Affairs Tarja Halonen stated that the relations between Finland and Russia are more straightforward and reliable than before. According to her, Finland adapted quickly to the new situation in its eastern neighbour. Russia has condemned the Soviet Union’s attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of Finland. Minister Halonen also argued that Finland’s EU membership has not diminished the importance of Finnish-Russian bilateral relations, quite the opposite. As an EU member, Finland seeks to promote trade liberalisation between the EU and Russia. Finland’s role as a gateway to the East has also grown.\n\nSpeaking at a seminar of the Finnish Committee of 100 dealing with security policy, Foreign Minister Tarja Halonen said that one of the objectives of the EU Intergovernmental Conference, due to begin in Turin in March, should be the strengthening of the Union’s foreign and security policy. Finland wants this sector of policy to be kept within intergovernmental cooperation. Minister Halonen said that the use of qualified majority decisions could be considered in EU foreign and security policy. However, protecting the vital interests of each member state is essential. The Finnish government’s position is that the Common Foreign and Security Policy should be made more well-known. According to Minister Halonen, the appointment of a special representative for foreign and security policy, a kind of EU foreign minister, would involve major problems related to the division of powers and responsibilities.\n\nHelsinki hosted a new round of talks as part of the OSCE Minsk Process aiming to solve the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The negotiations were co-chaired by Finland and Russia, and taking part were the parties to the conflict: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh. At the end of the talks, the so-called Minsk Group also held a meeting to plan a visit of OSCE representatives to the Nagorno-Karabakh region from 29 February to 1 March.\n\nA Green League delegation held a meeting in Helsinki to adopt a position on Finland’s accession to the EU’s Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Finland’s accession requires setting up European and Finnish funds to promote employment, the Greens said. Prime Minister Lipponen, taking part in the meeting, doubted the willingness of core EU countries to spend money in the establishment of the counter-cyclical stabilisation funds. He was also sceptical about national-level funds. According to the Green League party leadership, no position was taken at the meeting in favour or against the EMU.\n\nParliament discussed the objectives of the EU Intergovernmental Conference, based on a government report. In its report, the Government emphasised the influence of small states in a more efficient and more flexible EU. The government groups agreed with the main points of the report. They especially supported the EU’s eastern enlargement, whereas the EMU was criticised across group barriers. The Left Alliance and the Greens want to postpone the monetary union, due to be introduced in 1999. The Left Alliance cited Finnish unemployment as the reason for postponement, and the Greens feared that the EMU would turn the EU into a federation. The government parties hoped that at the EU’s Intergovernmental Conference, Finland would promote an EU that is closer to its citizens, makes decisions in a more transparent way, and does not escape the member states’ control. The opposition party Keskusta (Centre Party) thought the Government’s EMU policy was shifting and unrealistic. The party commented that \"the Government is advancing the project uncritically without the support and commitment of the government groups”. The Centre Party suggested that the Government prepare a report on the pros and cons of the single currency, in order to open a wide discussion on the issue before final decisions are made.\n\nIn Saint Petersburg, an agreement was signed regarding the planning of the Krasny Bor hazardous waste facility. It was agreed that the planning will be done in Finnish-Russian cooperation. The treatment of toxic waste from St Petersburg is one of the issues requiring urgent action according to the Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission. It is also one of the most important environmental cooperation projects in Finland’s adjacent areas. The Krasny Bor hazardous waste landfill is filling up, posing a threat to groundwaters and to the Gulf of Finland.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry criticised the NATO military exercise \"Battle Griffin” going on in Norway, stating: \"Moscow has taken note of NATO’s constant military activity in Russia’s neighbour countries. The same goes for the exercise of the Finnish Defence Forces on 19-22 February in the Kymi Province near the Russian border”. Moscow-based expert Sergey Oznobishchev believed Russia was searching for its place in the international arena. According to him Russia is feeling insecure in its lack of allies, and its loneliness makes it quick to react to world events. Jaakko Blomberg, Under-Secretary of State at the Finnish Foreign Ministry, said Finland’s military exercise conformed to OSCE standards. Furthermore, a group of Russian officers were present and followed the exercise. Minister of Defence Anneli Taina did not wish to comment on the Russian statement.\n\nPrime Minister Lipponen and Foreign Minister Halonen attended the first Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM), held in Bangkok, Thailand on the initiative of Singapore. Besides EU countries, the meeting gathered the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) – Brunei, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam – as well as China, Japan and South Korea. The summit showed that Asia has now been recognised as a centre of power alongside North America and Europe. For the EU, the meeting was a way to counterbalance the APEC, and the EU wants to catch up with Japan and the US in Asia. In addition to the themes of economy and trade, the funding of the rebuilding in Bosnia and the UN’s financial situation were discussed. Prime Minister Lipponen talked about railway connections between Asia and Europe and the opening of competition in the field of telecommunications. He also mentioned the expertise in environmental technology that Finland has to offer. Finland wished Russia to join the Asia-Europe cooperation. NGOs held a parallel conference in Bangkok. They expressed support for closer economic ties between Europe and Asia, provided the conditions of trade are fair.\n\nThe new Secretary of State at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs Jukka Valtasaari told the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that closer cooperation in the EU’s foreign and security policy will not mean the end of national foreign policy. In his opinion, the Union does not need its own foreign minister, because the common policy stems from shared interests rather than one person. In his previous position as the Finnish ambassador to Washington, he came to see that Finland is no longer considered a grey area since its EU accession. A change in Finland’s international position occurred already after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the concept of Finlandisation quickly ceased to be used.\n\nAt the opening of the 139th National Defence Course in Helsinki, Chief of Defence, General Gustav Hägglund strongly defended universal conscription as the foundation of national defence. He argued that compulsory military service is by far the best way to defend our own country, whereas a professional force is superior in military actions elsewhere. General Hägglund added that according to opinion polls, the Defence Forces are the country’s most trusted institution. Furthermore, the will of the citizens to defend their country is among the highest in the world.\n\nThe Nordic Council held its first Theme Session which focused on Europe. Nordic prime ministers, ministers for Nordic cooperation, and members of national parliaments as well as the European Parliament gathered to discuss Nordic cooperation ahead of the EU Intergovernmental Conference. Former President of the European Commission Jacques Delors also attended the meeting. The session’s themes were EU enlargement, European employment policy, the fight against crime, transparency and democracy, as well as environmental and consumer policies. The Finnish, Danish, and Swedish prime ministers promised to keep Norway and Iceland up to date regarding the forthcoming IGC. Gro Harlem Brundtland, Prime Minister of Norway which is a non-EU country, advocated close Nordic cooperation with coordinated policies, whereas Finnish EU Commissioner Erkki Liikanen considered it very harmful to operate in this way.\n\nStatistics Finland (the national statistics authority) reported to the European Commission that Finland’s government debt was 59,4 percent of GDP at the end of 1995. The ratio was smaller than the EU average and barely below the limit of 60 percent defined in the EMU convergence criteria. In addition to public debt, government deficit is used as a measure of fiscal soundness and sustainability in EU countries. Finland’s deficit-to-GDP ratio was 5,6 percent last year, which exceeds the three-percent threshold of the EMU criteria. The deficit amounted to 54 billion markka.\n\nThe Government voted on a licence for Sisu Defence to deliver its \"Pasi” armoured personnel carriers to Indonesia. The company obtained a licence to export 60 vehicles. The permit is valid until the end of 1998. Left Alliance ministers Claes Andersson and Terttu Huttu-Juntunen voted against the decision. They opposed it because Indonesia occupies the former Portuguese colony East Timor against UN resolutions. On 11 March, the Swedish peace organisation Svenska Freds criticised the Finnish government’s decision, which it considered to be the Government’s direct support to Indonesia’s oppressive regime.\n\nThe Cabinet Committee on Foreign and Security Policy considered the plans for a Finnish rapid deployment force to be used in international crisis management. According to the plan presented by Defence Minister Anneli Taina, the rapid deployment force would be a brigade of 5000 soldiers. The core of the brigade would consist of three jaeger battalions of about 1000 troops each. The training of the force would happen as part of the normal training of conscripts. According to the plans, the force will be one of the brigades responsible for national defence. NATO compatibility is a specific goal of the training: the force must master NATO communication systems, codes and calls. Training is due to begin next winter. The funding needed to establish the force will be taken from the normal defence budget.\n\nEU foreign ministers held an informal meeting in Palermo, Italy, to discuss their stance vis-à-vis three Middle Eastern countries that have supported terrorism: Iran, Syria and Libya. It was decided that a three-member, under-secretary of state level delegation would be sent to the three countries to demand that they change their approach and that they clearly condemn bomb attacks and every form of terrorism. The delegation’s trip is part of the EU’s strategy to support the fragile peace process in the Middle East. The strategy was outlined in a paper drafted by France and presented at an anti-terrorism summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt on 13 March. In their meeting, the foreign ministers also discussed the role of the European Parliament in the coming IGC based on two compromise proposals, but did not reach a consensus. Finland among others is not in favour of giving more power to the EU Parliament, preferring to develop the EU as a union of independent states. The ministers also urged the countries that had pledged assistance to Bosnia to pay the promised sums.\n\nPresident Ahtisaari and his wife visited Persian Gulf countries to promote economic cooperation between Finland and the Gulf region and exports by Finnish companies to the region. The President was accompanied by Minister for European Affairs and Foreign Trade Ole Norrback, and a 17-member high-level delegation of industry and business representatives. On 9-11 March the President paid a state visit to Kuwait and met the Emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah. Minister Norrback signed an agreement on investment protection and taxation between Finland and Kuwait. The next visit was to the United Arab Emirates. In Abu Dhabi, President Ahtisaari held talks with UAE President, Emir of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan. In Dubai, Ahtisaari met the Emirati Vice President and Prime Minister, Emir of Dubai Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum. On his way home, President Ahtisaari made a stopover in Aswan, Egypt, where he met President of Egypt Hosni Mubarak. They discussed among other things the anti-terrorism summit held in Egypt on 13 March.\n\nMinister of Finance Sauli Niinistö attended the Ecofin Council in Brussels. The EU Commissioner for Monetary Affairs Yves-Thibault de Silguy reminded Niinistö that for entering the monetary union, a stable currency is one of the criteria with a fixed timetable. Commission President Jacques Santer proposed that funds left over from other projects could be reallocated to promote employment. The initiative was opposed by six Member States, including Germany, France and Britain. The Economic Policy Committee enjoined the EU Member States to follow more closely the goals of their economic programmes, and called for better monitoring of Member States by the Commission regarding this issue.\n\nPrime Minister Lipponen attended a meeting of the Defence Committee at the Finnish Parliament. He did not exclude the possibility that in the future, Finnish defence policy would be prepared by a committee with representatives of both opposition and government parties. For years, the permanent Defence Committee (puolustusvaliokunta, standing committee) has called for the setting up of this type of body, the so-called parliamentary defence committee (parlamentaarinen puolustuskomitea). The standing committee opposed the fact that the Defence Council chaired by the Prime Minister appointed a group of officials to consider defence policy issues.\n\nThe Government submitted to Parliament a proposal to amend the Currency Act. Once Parliament passes the amendment, the linking of the Finnish markka to the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) becomes possible. The new law will also allow the floating of the markka, just like previously. According to the Government, the inclusion in the ERM involves problems, so there is no haste to join the mechanism.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance announced the preliminary results of its EU calculations. They indicate that in 1995, Finland was a net recipient from the European Union regardless of calculation method. The estimates of the financial benefit gained by Finland vary from about two hundred million markka to three billion, depending on the method of calculation. Finland’s budget received a total of 683 million markka more from the EU than it contributed. The contribution was smaller than expected, especially due to 500 million worth of contributions, paid in excess in 1994, that were reimbursed to Finland. The payment of subsidies was delayed because Finland failed to promptly launch the development programmes required by EU funds.\n\nA ministerial meeting of OECD countries hosted by German Minister for Housing Klaus Töpfer was held in Berlin. The purpose of the meeting was to prepare the Second UN Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II) that would be held in Istanbul in June. The preparation work is led by Finland. At the meeting, Environment Minister Pekka Haavisto signed a Finnish-German agreement on building and housing cooperation. The aim is to develop the collaboration between Finland and Germany in construction exports to Central and Eastern European countries.\n\nUN Special Rapporteur for Human Rights Elisabeth Rehn made a plea to the Finnish government and to Parliament for the rebuilding of Bosnia. She especially stressed the urgent need for humanitarian aid for the renovation of dwellings. The Bosnian government has specifically asked for grassroots-level assistance which includes, besides housing, the rebuilding of destroyed schools, hospitals and day care centres. Ms Rehn said that concrete actions are essential in this situation instead of mere appeals.\n\nThe director of the TACIS group in Russia I.A. Markov visited Helsinki. He said Finland now has a good chance to show it is a gateway to Russia, as up to one billion markka have been allocated to projects being planned close to the border. By now, 168 consulting agreements have been made with Russia on the basis of the TACIS programme. Finnish companies are in on 89 of them. Of the agreements, 33 are in energy consulting and include mainly suggestions related to the improvement of nuclear safety in CIS countries. The second largest target for assistance is education, which aims to promote the development of market economy. The budget of the TACIS programme for five years is 13 billion markka. Russia’s share of the sum is nearly six billion markka.\n\nMEP Olli Rehn called for the system of preparing EU affairs in Finland to be reformed. In his view, to concentrate the handling of these matters into the Finnish Foreign Ministry was a mistake. He felt that the leadership of the Foreign Ministry lacks an overall vision of the implementation of Finnish EU policy, and that no one seems to be taking charge of the country’s EU strategy. Mr Rehn argued that the preparation should be concentrated in the Prime Minister’s Office, so that the handling of EU affairs would be more closely linked to the planning of national economic and public policies. The Minister for European Affairs would assist the Prime Minister in defining Finnish EU policies and in adjusting the burden of negotiation.\n\nMinister for European Affairs and Foreign Trade Ole Norrback and a broad delegation of officials and business people visited Chile, Argentina and Brazil. In each country, Minister Norrback met ministers responsible for the economy, trade, mining, transport and telecommunications. The purpose of the trip was to investigate new opportunities opening up to Finland thanks to EU membership, and to bring up these opportunities during the talks. The visits included meetings with representatives of the Chilean federation of industries and of the central employers’ organisation. In Brazil, a treaty between Finland and Brazil was signed for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of tax evasion with respect to income taxes.\n\nThe Parliament Finance Committee issued a statement to the Grand Committee in which it expressed the hope that the Government’s decision on the EMU would be based on economic factors, not on questions of political clout or authority. The Finance Committee looked favourably upon the Monetary Union itself, but reminded of the risks and problems associated with it. The Committee also called for a strict interpretation of the EMU criteria, and warned about trying to meet the requirements by means which would have negative social repercussions.\n\nThe Constitutional Law Committee of the Finnish Parliament submitted a statement to the Foreign Affairs Committee suggesting that the role of the EU Parliament should not be strengthened in the EU legislative process. The Committee’s position was that a stronger EU Parliament would imply an emphasis on the transnational features of the Union, it would support the largest European political coalitions, and it would likely increase the influence of large member states. In its statement, the Constitutional Law Committee also commented on the government report regarding the EU Intergovernmental Conference, agreeing that the Union should be developed as a conglomerate of sovereign states. According to the Committee, the clearest manifestation of this characteristic of the Union is the fact that the highest legislative body is the EU Council which represents the governments of member states. The Committee is opposed to the conferral of legal personality to the EU because it believes the Union might start making international agreements in foreign and security policy on behalf of the member states.\n\nThe Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) aiming to reform the basic structures of the European Union began in Turin, Italy, opened by an extra EU summit. From Finland, the meeting was attended by President Ahtisaari, Prime Minister Lipponen and Foreign Minister Halonen. The meeting adopted an agenda in which a prominent issue was employment, a theme underscored for instance by Finland and Sweden. The main themes were the citizen and the Union, the strengthening of EU foreign policy, as well as the changes in EU institutions and in the division of power between them required for EU enlargement. The final document stated that the relationship between the WEU and the EU should be clarified. Ways of improving the functioning of the WEU should be investigated. Capabilities are needed for tasks in peacekeeping and crisis management. Prime Minister Lipponen saw potential problems for small member states in the development of the EU. Finland stresses the importance of strengthening the EU Commission and the Council of Ministers, because they guarantee the equal participation of small member states.\n\nFinnish officers will be sent in a few weeks to the headquarters of the Estonian armed forces, the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat reported. Finnish defence thinking is entering a new era, it is argued. Finland’s own security is improved by sending soldiers on active service to another country. The Government approved the terms of the collaboration, holding the view that the emergence of a system of defence in the Baltic States increases overall security. Minister of Defence Anneli Taina told that Estonia has requested assistance from Finland in developing the Estonian Defence Forces and planning Estonian defence. In the framework of the Partnership for Peace (PfP), Finland has offered its expertise, Taina said. In principle, nothing now prevents Estonia from becoming a customer to the Finnish military industry. Among new military equipment, Estonia could purchase for instance assault rifles and armoured vehicles.\n\nIn an interview with news agency STT, President Ahtisaari said he holds firmly to the powers vested in the president by the Finnish constitution when it comes to foreign and security policy. According to the President, Finland has started preparing for the 1999 EU presidency. For him it was evident that the prime minister chairs the meetings during the Finnish presidency in the latter half of 1999. Ahtisaari believed that the IGC will advance the EU’s eastern enlargement. He thought every member state should have a representative in the Commission, and hoped that the large member states would reduce the number of their commissioners. Regarding the merging of the WEU and the EU, Ahtisaari stated that \"for example England is reluctant about the idea”. The President did not consider it necessary to discuss Finland’s NATO membership. Ahead of a visit to China, he said there was no reason China’s human rights situation could not be brought up. However, he would not make an \"awful fuss” about it. Among the critics of the President’s trip to China was MEP Elisabeth Rehn.\n\nPrime Minister Paavo Lipponen visited Brussels and Luxembourg. In Brussels, he met the President of the European Commission Jacques Santer and EMU Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy. At the Commission, Lipponen said that Finland will not, in the foreseeable future, stop the floating of the markka or join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, ERM. The needed legislation will be adopted by the Finnish Parliament and the situation will be followed, while examining the impact ERM participation would have on the stability of the markka. Lipponen also affirmed Finland’s commitment to the process taking us to the EMU. He also said Finland is in favour of keeping the Commission’s role strong. According to The Prime Minister, Finland supports Santer’s proposal which seeks to promote trust within the European economy and stresses the role of social partners. In Luxembourg, Lipponen met his host, Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, and the chairman of the country’s Chamber of Deputies, Jean Spautz.\n\nIn its statement submitted to the Foreign Affairs Committee regarding the Intergovernmental Conference, the Parliament’s Grand Committee called the postponement of the EMU Stage Three a realistic option, and even a desirable solution. The delay would offer a better chance of improving the plans for the EMU, both on the national and European levels. The Committee suggested that the Government prepare for the possibility that the EMU will be on the agenda of the IGC, contrary to preliminary plans. According to the chair of the Grand Committee Erkki Tuomioja, there is no contradiction between the government report and the Committee’s statement, although issues such as environmental taxes have raised discussion. The Committee wished Finland, Sweden and Denmark would make joint initiatives in the IGC.\n\nThe European Commission approved the EU’s proposal for the so-called Baltic Sea Initiative in Brussels. The initiative includes both a political and an economic aspect, and it brings together all the projects related to the Baltic Sea region which the EU participates in. The initiative is the EU’s contribution to a meeting that will be held in Visby, Sweden in May. The growing need for an EU Baltic Sea policy partly stems from the fact that new member states Finland and Sweden are countries bordering on the Baltic Sea. These countries have insisted that the EU should counterbalance its significant focus on the Mediterranean policy by directing sufficient attention towards the Baltic Sea region. The region is inhabited by 60 million people, half of which are citizens of four EU countries.\n\nA report was published on Finnish development cooperation projects in 1988-1995, titled \"Effects or Impacts?”. It was commissioned from the Institute of Development Studies at the University of Helsinki by the Finnish Foreign Ministry’s Department for Development Cooperation. According to the study, Finnish development projects have produced quite good results at least in the short term – perhaps excluding industrial projects. As appropriations diminished because of the economic depression, the projects gained in economic efficiency. They also became more ecologically sustainable. In general, the high cost of Finnish development cooperation has mainly been due to the use of Finnish staff and Finnish supplies. A large part of Finland’s development assistance has been used on measures to promote Finnish exports. The report indicated that this has been an expensive form of export promotion. Moreover, the focus of Finnish foreign aid has clearly shifted from Africa to Asia, and from the poorest countries to those with economic potential, like China, Malaysia and Thailand.\n\nDuring question time at the Parliament, Foreign Minister Halonen announced that the Government will give more prominence to human rights in its foreign policy. The Government will focus especially on the situation of women and children. Ahead of President Ahtisaari’s trip to China on 14 April, the Parliament’s Human Rights Group (chaired by Ulla Anttila from the Greens) expressed the wish that during his visit, the President would try to engage in \"serious negotiations to improve China’s human rights situation”. Ahtisaari assured that human rights issues would be raised during the trip, but dealing with the problem requires dialogue, not defiance.\n\nMacedonian Foreign Minister Ljubomir Frčkoski visited Finland and met Foreign Minister Halonen and President Ahtisaari. It emerged in the discussions that Macedonia will need UN troops for at least one more year. The need for troops probably persists until the volatile situation in Kosovo, which is part of Serbia, is stabilised. Finland has at the moment 3590 peacekeepers in the region, after 50 men were transferred to Zagreb, the capital of Croatia. The mandate expires in May, but UN is expected to renew it. Another purpose for the foreign minister’s visit was to promote trade between the countries.\n\nThe Ministry for Foreign Affairs issued a press release saying that Finland wishes to engage in dialogue with NATO and its member countries. Finland wants to discuss the implications of the enlargement of the military alliance in the country’s neighbourhood – Northern Europe and the Baltic Sea region. The Foreign Ministry assured that the discussions would not imply a change in Finland’s military non-alliance. Under-Secretary of State Jaakko Blomberg described the initiative as \"guarding [our] own interests”. Finland hopes to begin the discussions before the NATO foreign ministers’ meeting in Berlin in June. NATO invited all the Partnership for Peace countries to initiate accession talks. Finland also received NATO’s offer, but has not responded so far. The accession negotiations are expected to start at the end of the year, after the presidential elections in Russia and the US. The heads of state supporting Boris Yeltsin do not want the negotiations to play into the hands of Yeltsin’s opponents.\n\nAppearing before the Grand Committee of the Finnish Parliament, Prime Minister Lipponen told that Finland has been offered, by Germany and Luxembourg among others, a role in helping the Baltic States to join the EU. In his view, the best way for Finland to support the Baltics in this issue is to be as close as possible to the group of core countries that is taking shape in the EU. Lipponen said that Finland would also be happy to tackle this task together with Sweden and Denmark.\n\nMinister of Finance Sauli Niinistö and Governor of the Bank of Finland Sirkka Hämäläinen took part in an EU finance ministers’ meeting (ECOFIN) in Verona, Italy. The agenda included the preparation of the EMU Stage Three, the economic situation of EU countries, initiatives for reducing unemployment, and taxation issues. Finland supported the idea that EU countries opting out of the EMU’s third stage must join a new exchange rate mechanism that is essentially similar to the current ERM. Finland agreed with EMU Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy that an inflation target alone is insufficient. The economic and finance ministers decided that one hundredth of a euro will be called a eurocent. Niinistö and Hämäläinen did not address the floating of the markka. The German and Italian ministers said in their press conferences that they consider a two-year participation in the ERM to be mandatory for countries aspiring to join the EMU.\n\nRepresentatives of over 50 countries gathered in Brussels to discuss the funding of Bosnia’s rebuilding. The two-day conference was hosted by the European Commission and the World Bank. In addition to the previous commitment of 600 million dollars, another 1,28 billion dollars were pledged for the rebuilding effort. The EU and its member states have pledged one third of the sum. The aid is granted to all the regions and ethnic groups of Bosnia, as long as they adhere to the stipulations of the Dayton Peace Agreement. The most urgent tasks are providing the opportunity for refugees to return to their homeland, and mine clearance. Finland now assists the rebuilding with 60 million markka in addition to the 10 million already granted. Finnish funds will be mainly used for the construction of energy and water systems such as district heating. Finland will also participate in the identification of war victims and the investigation of their cause of death.\n\nNordic and Baltic cooperation ministers met in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. At the meeting, the ministers noted that Nordic-Baltic cooperation now requires broad and precise coordination in order to use resources efficiently. In their communiqué, the ministers recognised the importance of a successful IGC for the EU’s eastern enlargement. On 15-16 April, it was the turn of the countries’ parliamentarians, i.e. the Nordic Council and the Baltic Assembly to hold their first joint meeting. The meeting was also attended by the prime ministers of the Baltic States and the Nordic cooperation ministers, and it was opened by Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas. The Nordic Council stressed that the meeting was informal because it did not want to commit, as the Council, to the joint statement on the meeting. Instead, the statement was approved by the presidium. The Nordic cooperation ministers reminded the Baltic parliamentarians and ministers that the EU membership for the Baltic countries is impossible unless the countries themselves actively seek to perform the necessary groundwork. The Nordic countries support the EU accession of the Baltics and are prepared to help in matters related to the application process. The simultaneous launching of the accession negotiations was regarded important by the Nordic ministers. The Baltic States were in favour of NATO membership. With regard to NATO’s enlargement, Finnish Minister for Nordic Cooperation Ole Norrback said that the issue is connected to Russia, and that Finland wants to be well informed.\n\nPresident Ahtisaari and his wife made a state visit to China, invited by President Jiang Zemin. President Ahtisaari was accompanied by Foreign Minister Halonen, Minister for European Affairs Norrback, and a large delegation of businesspeople. Besides President Jiang Zemin, Ahtisaari met the chairman of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, Li Ruihuan, and Prime Minister Li Peng. China’s internal development and economic issues were the main topics of discussion. President Ahtisaari opened a Chinese-Finnish scientific and technological symposium and an economic forum organised by industry in Beijing. At the opening of the economic forum, Ahtisaari assured China of Finland’s support for its membership in the WTO. The event culminated in the signing of the 6th trade agreement. As he inaugurated the Finnish consulate in Shanghai, Ahtisaari stated that human rights questions are important in the relations between the two countries. The dialogue about human rights is a natural part of our interaction.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence obtained authorisation from the Finnish Government to sign an agreement with Russia on defence materiel for the years 1996–1998. The general agreement mainly follows the agreement concerning the years 1991-1995 between Finland and the Soviet Union. It allows for purchases to be made both through offsets and the exchange of currencies. Annual deliveries and payments will be agreed upon separately. In 1996, a sum of 44 million markka has been allocated for these purchases. It will be used to buy spare parts for previously acquired special equipment.\n\nIn a joint article by Helsingin Sanomat and Dagens Nyheter, Finnish and Swedish foreign ministers Tarja Halonen and Lena Hjelm-Wallén called for the clarification of the relationship between the EU and the WEU in military crisis management. This would require a revision of the Maastricht Treaty. The core notion of the model proposed by Finland and Sweden is that military crisis management would be made part of the framework of the EU’s common foreign and security policy. The foreign ministers suggested that the operations would be conducted by the WEU. Moreover, they hoped that the connection between the EU and the WEU would be strengthened. They argued for an equal chance of participation for all EU member states in EU-mandated and WEU-led operations. The foreign ministers also proposed that the WEU defence tasks and its security guarantees will be separated from the cooperation on crisis management. The two countries submitted a joint memorandum on the issue on 25 and 26 April to the other EU member states. This was the first joint foreign policy initiative of note by Finland and Sweden in the EU.\n\nThe President decided that Finland shall recognise the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as one of the successor states of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The decision was informed by the developments since the signing of the Dayton Agreement for peace in Bosnia on 14 December 1995, as well as the mutual recognition between Yugoslavia and Macedonia. Finland restores full diplomatic relations with the FRY. Having recognised the country, Finland will have recognised all five of the successor states of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The future course of the relations between Finland and the FRY will depend on the Federal Republic’s attitude to the peace process, and on its domestic development.\n\nThe UN asked for Finland’s assistance in the identification of Bosnia’s casualties. The request came in response to the initiative of Elisabeth Rehn who acts as the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Bosnia. The Finnish Foreign Ministry has made a preliminary decision to grant the requested assistance. Before the experts can leave for Bosnia, the Ministry will examine questions of security related for example to the demining of the region. Funds for the project will be provided by Finland.\n\nAccording to the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, Finland has accepted the request sent by the UN to all countries to allow people convicted of war crimes in the former Yugoslavia region to serve their prison terms in Finnish prisons. Finland is willing to receive five war criminals, but like Norway and Denmark, wants to negotiate which inmates will serve their sentences here. Finland will refuse to house convicted political leaders in its prisons, as these lack the required level of security. No one has been convicted yet, but the first trial against suspected war criminals is to begin in The Hague in early May. The maximum sentence is life imprisonment.\n\nPrime Minister of Sweden Göran Persson made a working visit to Finland and met with Prime Minister Lipponen. The ministers decided to begin a close cooperation in matters pertaining to the Baltic Sea region and neighbouring areas. They plan to present their main suggestions regarding these areas at the EU summit in Florence in June. Prime Minister Persson said Sweden respects the aim of the Baltic States to join NATO. The ministers excluded the possibility of security guarantees from Nordic countries to the Baltic States. They also discussed the EMU, and were confident that its schedule will be kept. They stated that at this stage, neither country is planning to join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism ERM.\n\nThe Finnish Government submitted to Parliament a report on the development of Finland’s capabilities in peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts. Defence Minister Taina, who presented the report, stressed Finland’s responsibility as the member of various communities to participate in crisis management. She also believed that by improving our readiness to engage in peacekeeping and humanitarian missions, \"Finland will be able to contribute to the development of the EU’s common crisis management capability in a way that benefits also our national defence”. The costs that will be incurred due to the establishment of the Finnish rapid deployment force were estimated to total about 220 million markka between 1998 and 2000. The estimate for the initial costs of the training of the rapid deployment force in 1996-1997 was around 12 million markka. The expenses will be included in the normal budget of the Defence Forces.\n\nThe Parliament Foreign Affairs Committee finished a committee report in response to the government report on Finland’s starting points and objectives at the IGC. The Committee affirmed the Government’s views on all central points, including the idea that each EU member state would get at least one seat in the Commission. The Committee had reservations about the suggestion that qualified majority decision-making would be increasingly used in the common foreign and security policy. The Committee expects Finland to advocate solutions that are not in conflict with Finland’s military non-alliance and independent defence. The Committee also wants the common foreign and security policy to remain in the form of intergovernmental cooperation. Therefore, it saw no need for a special representative for the Union’s foreign and security policy. In making the EU’s functioning more efficient, the interests of all the member states should be considered, the Committee affirmed. Centre Party members of the Foreign Affairs Committee criticised the Committee for taking vague positions. The Centre Party’s view was that Finland ought to clearly oppose the extension of the use of qualified majority voting in the field of foreign and security policy.\n\nForeign Minister Tarja Halonen and Bank of Finland Board Member Kalevi Sorsa took part in a security policy forum of Russia and Baltic and Nordic countries held in St Petersburg. Besides the theme of security policy, the forum dealt with economic prospects in the region. It was argued that the concept of Baltic Sea security should also encompass security in the economic and social spheres. The seminar envisaged the founding of an independent international commission in the Baltic Sea region that would focus on both monitoring and developing security in the region. Member of the Board of the Bank of Finland Kalevi Sorsa, who is soon to retire, has been asked to head the commission. A major topic in St Petersburg was NATO, about which the Russians and the Baltics openly and sharply disagreed. Nordic ministers maintained that an expanded NATO is not a threat to anyone, but has proven to be a defensive alliance. Foreign Minister Halonen thought that the Baltic Sea may once be as important to the EU as the Mediterranean region.\n\nPresident of the European Parliament Klaus Hänsch visited Finland by invitation of the Speaker of the Finnish Parliament Riitta Uosukainen. In addition to Ms Uosukainen, he met President Ahtisaari, Prime Minister Lipponen, and the leaders of the parliamentary groups. In his discussions with President Ahtisaari, Mr Hänsch said the European Parliament should be developed without calling into question the status of national parliaments in any way. The EU Council’s majority decisions should be adopted in concert with the EU Parliament. With regard to the EU’s foreign and security policy, Ahtisaari stressed the importance of a flexible approach as the functioning of the so-called troika is being developed. He hoped the troika would take advantage of the expertise that the Union can provide in all international matters. At a Paasikivi Society event, Hänsch said that the adoption in 1999 of the EU’s single currency, the euro, should not be delayed. A failure to launch the euro on schedule would be perceived as the EU not meeting its commitments, thus undermining the Union’s credibility. Were the currency project to fail, other endeavours such as enlargement would suffer as well.\n\nThe Finnish Government appeared in Geneva before the Committee against Torture which considered the implementation by Finland of the UN Convention against Torture. Finland submitted its second periodic report in August 1995. The Finnish delegation in Geneva was led by the Director General of the Finnish Prison Service K.J. Lång. Alexander N. Yakovlev acted as country rapporteur for Finland at the examination. In his opening statement, he affirmed that Finland as a democratic state has taken seriously the provisions of the Convention and has taken adequate measures to tackle any observed problems. He considered very positive that with the constitutional reform in 1995, Finland included the prohibition of torture in its constitution. The Committee had found no evidence of torture in Finland. However, Finland received certain recommendations.\n\nPrime Minister of Russia Viktor Chernomyrdin made a working visit to Finland. In his meeting with Prime Minister Lipponen, he expressed his contentment with Finland’s moderate stance regarding the Russian-Baltic NATO disagreement. Lipponen promised that Finland is prepared to give humanitarian aid to Chechnya. A number of agreements were signed during Chernomyrdin’s visit. These included a memorandum concerning the development of investment and project cooperation between the countries, [a tax treaty,] and a protocol amending the investment protection agreement of 1989. A long-prepared agreement concerning this year’s (1996) procurements for the Defence Forces was also concluded, as well as a procurement agreement on air defence materiel. With the defence materiel, Russia reduces the debt incurred by the former Soviet Union by about 850 million markka. An anti-aircraft missile system will also be brought to Finland to defend the Capital Region.\n\nAt the annual meeting of the National Defence Course Association in Helsinki, Minister Max Jakobson said that as NATO enlarges, Finland and Sweden will have to weigh the options to decide what is best: NATO membership or staying alone. He believed that the \"dynamic of Europe’s change will lead to the history of the enlargement of the European community to be repeated”. In Jakobson’s view, we can expect that Austria, a country surrounded by NATO members, will seek membership. After this Sweden and Finland will follow suit, with certain reservations: no nuclear weapons and no foreign troops during peacetime. According to Jakobson, the countries will apply for membership not because they see Russia as a military threat, \"but because staying outside of NATO would mean staying out of both the decision-making of European security policy and the NATO-Russia security policy cooperation”. Jakobson disputed speculations that Sweden and Finland, which are stable democracies, would be denied access to NATO. In response to Jakobson’s NATO comments, Jaakko Blomberg, Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign Ministry, said that Finland is not applying for NATO membership, but acknowledges the right of every state to apply. Finland also emphasises that NATO’s potential expansion will increase, not diminish, security.\n\nWEU foreign and defence ministers assembled in Birmingham in Britain where the organisation’s ten member countries decided about the union’s new rules. These allow observer countries to participate in WEU operations, if the majority of member countries approve it. The participants in an operation will also have an equal right to take part in its preparation and planning. The ministers of the member countries also adopted a concluding document aiming at a cautious increase in the WEU’s operational capability. The goal of these measures is to improve the crisis management competence of the organisation. Cooperation with NATO will however continue to play a key role in crisis management. Finnish Foreign Minister Halonen and Defence Minister Taina attended the Birmingham meeting. Foreign Minister Halonen found the improved status of observer members a positive thing. She believed that the reform of WEU rules is clearly tied to the joint initiative by Finland and Sweden.\n\nOn a visit to Finland by invitation from Derek Shearer, the United States Ambassador to Finland, the US Ambassador to NATO Robert Hunter expressed his country’s concern about the WEU’s security guarantees to its full members. The WEU’s commitment to its members is much stronger than NATO’s. If a WEU member country were attacked, this would probably have an impact on NATO – and the United States. This is why the US considers that a WEU member must also be a member of NATO. In Hunter’s view, a country like Finland would have every right to join the WEU on the basis of the Maastricht Treaty. However, he hoped that a country seeking membership would first contact the United States. During his visit, Hunter also met President Ahtisaari and Prime Minister Lipponen.\n\nParliament held a follow-up debate on the government report dealing with the EU Intergovernmental Conference. The leader of the National Coalition Party parliamentary group Pertti Salolainen said he agreed with Minister Max Jakobson that Finland must prepare for \"the possibility that a wide security solution is achieved in Europe, including an understanding between NATO and Russia on the future of European security policy and NATO’s enlargement”. He said that the solution can appear quite soon, and in that case \"Finland too must reconsider its basic security policy solution and even membership in NATO and the WEU”. Salolainen called for an open analysis and discussion, without preconceptions, on security policy. But now is not yet the time for great updates of policy. Erkki Tuomioja who gave the Social Democratic Party’s group speech, was among the critics of the Centre Party for attaching a protest to the Foreign Affairs Committee report on the Government’s IGC report while demanding a foreign policy consensus.\n\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Halonen made an official visit to Estonia, meeting with President Lennart Meri and the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Estonian Parliament. An economic cooperation programme for this year (1996) was signed during the visit. The programme includes Finland’s support for various projects in Estonia with a sum of around 50 million markka. Concerning visa matters, Minister Halonen mentioned that Russians in Estonia will still need a visa to Finland, when the visa exemption agreement between Estonia and Finland comes into force at the start of next year. The agreement concerns only the citizens of the two countries. Alcohol import restrictions and questions of European security, especially NATO, were some of the topics that were also raised. The Estonians were interested in Minister Max Jakobson’s views on NATO. Halonen dealt with the questions by saying that at the moment, people in Finland are \"downright relishing” in the unlimited freedom of discussion. She hoped NATO’s enlargement would increase and not diminish security.\n\nThe Ministry for Foreign Affairs announced that preventing the spread of nuclear weapons is a basic objective of Finnish disarmament policy. Finland is committed to the global non-proliferation regime, and to its cornerstone the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which was extended indefinitely in 1995. Finland actively supports a stronger monitoring of nuclear material, as required by the Treaty. This includes a special support programme to nuclear safeguards. The programme is funded by the Foreign Ministry, and the Finnish Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority (STUK) is in charge of the actual implementation. The operation of the support programme is coordinated with the IAEA and with other supporter countries. The programme comprises the following sub-programmes: the Baltic States’ nuclear material safeguards programme, Ukraine’s nuclear material safeguards programme, and the programme for developing the IAEA’s safeguards. During the current year (1996), Finland will also launch a support programme to Russia’s nuclear material safeguards efforts.\n\nAt a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Foreign and Security Policy, President Ahtisaari assured that Finland will continue as before in foreign and security policy. He said that the Finnish Government follows \"a foreign and security policy which centers on independent defence, military non-alliance and the promotion of security solutions that are based on cooperation”. The statement came in response to the NATO debate stirred by Minister Jakobson’s comments. In other words, Finland is going to stay out of NATO. Foreign Minister Halonen also stressed that Finland’s policy has not changed. On May 10th, in interviews published by the newspapers Etelä-Suomen Sanomat and Satakunnan Kansa, Minister for European Affairs Ole Norrback commented on Jakobson’s remarks. He believed Finland would probably eventually decide to join NATO, as long as the membership increases stability in Finland’s neighbourhood. Military non-alliance has in his opinion changed due to the PfP programme and to Finnish peacekeeping legislation.\n\nFinland has, along with 12 other countries, expressed interest in having talks with NATO, Helsingin Sanomat reported. Finland is mainly interested in the implications of the organisation’s enlargement for Northern Europe and the Baltic Sea region, as well as in the development of partnership for peace. The discussion paper for the talks has not yet been sent to NATO. Finland hopes to hold the negotiations before the NATO foreign ministers’ meeting to take place in Berlin in the beginning of May.\n\nIn its editorial, the Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter called for Sweden to start the same kind of dialogue as Finland has started on NATO’s eastern enlargement. The newspaper referred to Max Jakobson’s idea that a country left out of NATO cannot take parti in European security policy decision-making or the cooperation between NATO and Russia. The paper considered that the Finnish debate is certainly not limited to the Finnish domestic arena, and that it concerns Sweden as well.\n\nOpposition leader Esko Aho said that the recent discussion on NATO raises questions about the credibility of the Government’s foreign and security policy. He thought the national policy line is not sufficiently anchored. For example the fact that the upcoming defence report from a group of officials is not being made on a parliamentary basis shows in Aho’s opinion that the Government is not willing to discuss matters, be it within the Government or with the opposition. He found Max Jakobson’s comments to be based on old perceived threats. New threats include environmental disasters, crime, and economic difficulties that will not be aided by joining a military alliance.\n\nPresident Ahtisaari and his wife made a four-day state visit to Ireland. This was the first visit by a Finnish head of state to the Republic of Ireland. The President was accompanied among others by Foreign Minister Halonen, Secretary of State Jukka Valtasaari, and Eikka Kosonen, the Director General of the Secretariat for EU Affairs at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Ahtisaari met President Mary Robinson and Prime Minister John Bruton. They discussed Ireland’s preparation for the EU presidency in the latter half of 1996, and the central themes during the presidency. At a research institute in Dublin, Ahtisaari explained Finnish security policy and said Finland is looking to the EU. The President said there is no more need for the neutrality of the Cold War era. Finland is not seeking to join NATO – its security policy is still based on an independent defence, military non-alignment and the active promotion of cooperative security arrangements.\n\nPrime Minister Lipponen sought to curb the debate on Finland’s potential NATO membership. He warned against giving the impression that Finland has a particular security problem. Lipponen considered both Finland’s and Sweden’s policies to be eminently clear. Finland and Sweden want to develop crisis management and peacekeeping activities, and the WEU can also be used for these tasks. Finland is looking to participate fully in these affairs, including in decision-making and not just operations. Finland is not aspiring to join military alliances. For Finland, the most important thing is stability in Northern Europe. According to the Prime Minister, Finland also has a special responsibility towards the Baltic States and to strengthen their position in Europe.\n\nThe Eurobarometer survey conducted in March by the European Commission found that support for EU membership has slightly improved in Finland early this year, although it is still below the EU average. Forty-five percent of Finns were in favour of the membership, while 58 % of EU citizens found the membership of their country a good thing. To the question \"has your country benefited from EU membership”, 36 % of Finns answered yes (EU citizens: 47 %). Finns are better informed than other EU citizens about the ongoing Intergovernmental Conference (IGC). Forty-seven percent of Finns knew what it is, compared to a mere 20 % EU average. The Eurobarometer indicated that the citizens of EU member states regard development cooperation with poor countries very important. It was supported by as many as 83 % of EU citizens. The views of the Finnish people on development differed in that Finns stressed more than others the respect of human rights as a condition for aid, and humanitarian aid at the expense of long-term development cooperation.\n\nThe French news agency AFP claimed that at the meeting of parliamentarians of NATO and its partner countries in Athens, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana had said that all EU member states should join NATO, and that membership applications should be submitted by the end of the year. NATO denied that Solana had said this. The Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs quickly released a statement saying that the information on Solana’s comments was false. The Foreign Ministry reminded that Solana did not refer to Finland or to other non-aligned EU countries. On 21 May, Foreign Minister Halonen joined the debate. She remarked that Solana’s speech deals only with NATO’s schedule for accepting new members. She repeated that Finland is not seeking NATO membership.\n\nThe Defence Committee approved by a vote of 10 to 5 the founding of the rapid deployment force that was proposed in the government report on the development of Finland’s peacekeeping and humanitarian capabilities. The Committee gave a statement about the issue to the Foreign Affairs Committee which is preparing a committee report (a document containing a proposed decision). The Defence Committee was dissatisfied with the information it has received concerning the expenses of founding the rapid deployment force. In its report, the Government has referred to the costs of a peacekeeping force that is at most battalion-sized. The Defence Committee would have wanted to know how much it would cost to later expand the RDF into a brigade. The Committee also considered it important that the new tasks do not take resources from national defence or otherwise hinder the main functions of the Finnish military.\n\nChief of Defence Gustav Hägglund said in an interview with Meddelanden från Åbo Akademi that the NATO debate has overlooked the fact that the United States will not accept new members in NATO with the same provisos as with Norway and Denmark. In practice this means that if Finland were in NATO, nuclear weapons could be placed here even in times of peace. Hägglund did not think that Finland can be compared to Austria with regard to the membership; it is much more provocative to store nuclear weapons in Kouvola than in Vienna. Hägglund found it difficult to conceive how Finland and Sweden could have different approaches to alliance.\n\nAt a session of the Cabinet Committee on Foreign and Security Policy, President Ahtisaari and the Government adopted guidelines for the NATO negotiations scheduled for 29 May. Finland has a special concern for the Baltic States. Government members have found it regrettable that the EU and NATO have raised hopes in the Baltic countries of joining the organisations. These expectations have later been dampened, which has caused a sense of insecurity in the Baltics.\n\nThe press secretary of the Chinese Embassy warned Finland on the Yleisradio’s TV news against officially welcoming the exiled Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. He said the visit would have inevitable repercussions on Finnish-Chinese relations, if the Dalai Lama engages in \"activities that are damaging to China” while in Finland. In his view, an official meeting or discussion with the Dalai Lama would be interpreted as interfering in China’s internal affairs. By invitation from the Finnish, Swedish and Norwegian Sami Parliaments, the Dalai Lama visited Enontekiö on 26 May and met with Environment Minister Pekka Haavisto. According to Haavisto, human rights are more important than trade in Finland’s China policy. The Sami Parliaments denounced in a joint declaration China’s human rights violations and the occupation of Tibet, and demanded that Chinese authorities negotiate with the Dalai Lama’s government-in-exile for the restoring of the autonomy of Tibet. On 27 May the Chinese Embassy released a statement in objection to this.\n\nNordic foreign ministers gathered in Mariehamn in the Åland Islands to discuss the EU Intergovernmental Conference, the Common Foreign and Security Policy, and EU enlargement. The ministers concluded that the EU’s enlargement creates a historic opportunity to influence the security and stability of Europe. They took a supportive position regarding enlargement in the Baltic States. At the meeting, it was emphasised that negotiations should be started simultaneously with all the prospective member countries. Furthermore, the ministers said they would intensify their campaign for securing Sweden’s seat in the UN Security Council in 1997-1998. They considered Nordic representation in the principal organ of the UN very important.\n\nThe president of Macedonia, Kiro Gligorov, visited Finland where he met President Ahtisaari. The presidents talked about bilateral relations, as well as the situation in the former Yugoslavia region and questions surrounding the European Union. President Gligorov praised the work of the Finnish peacekeepers in Macedonia. The mandate of the UN peace force ends officially on May 31st, but the UN Security Council will probably extend it. Finland has a special interest in the decision, as out of the little over 1000 peacekeepers in Macedonia, 470 are Finnish. Gligorov criticised the actions of the EU in its cooperation negotiations with Macedonia. The country is seeking membership in both the EU and NATO.\n\nThe Foreign Affairs Committee of the Finnish Parliament completed its report on the rapid deployment force. The FAC wanted the Government to further explain how the capabilities of the rapid deployment force in civilian and humanitarian affairs would be developed. The Committee found it problematic that military and humanitarian tasks would be combined in the same operation. The Committee also noted that conflict prevention has received little attention in the government report. The majority of the Committee was in favour of training the RDF for military crisis management. According to the committee report, the training of the force could be done as part of the training system of the Finnish Defence Forces. The Centre Party and the Finnish Christian League opposed the founding of the rapid deployment force, and their representatives in the Foreign Affairs Committee attached a protest to the committee report. In their view, the Finnish constitution binds Finnish citizens only to participate in defending their country.\n\nThe Government approved unanimously a licence for the Nokia Telecommunications company to export field artillery computing equipment to Indonesia. The devices are considered defence equipment, which need government approval. On 30 May the Social Democratic party organ Demari wrote that the SDP ministers would propose the deferral of the matter. The minister group was surprised by the claim and stated that there is no reason to block the granting of the licence. The justification for the group’s decision was that Finland follows the same policy as the rest of EU countries.\n\nIn Vienna, a new final document was adopted in amendment of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE), allowing Russia to keep nearly the current amount of military equipment in the so-called flank zone. On June 6th, the Finnish Ministry of Defence told the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that Russia’s armaments behind Finland’s eastern border are not likely to be reduced in the next few years. NATO gave in to US demands that Russia must be allowed to keep as much weapons as it wants in the areas neighbouring Finland and in the Caucasus.\n\nThe Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Finnish Parliament organised a CTBT seminar in Helsinki. Negotiations for a Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) have been pursued at the Geneva Convention on Disarmament since 1994. The talks are in their final stretch, and they are generally expected to be concluded in the summer of 1996. The CTBT is one of the main goals of Finnish disarmament policy. Finland has taken an active role in the negotiations, bringing the Finnish diplomatic and technical expertise to the table.\n\nPrime Minister of Singapore Goh Chok Tong arrived on an official visit to Finland, and met his host Prime Minister Lipponen, President Ahtisaari, Speaker of the Parliament Uosukainen, Foreign Minister Halonen, and Minister for European Affairs Norrback. In their discussions, the prime ministers dealt with European and Asian affairs as well as cooperation between Finland and Singapore. Among other things the negotiations aimed at increased air transport between Helsinki and Singapore. The prime ministers also agreed on student, internship and research exchanges and cultural cooperation. According to Prime Minister Goh, a loose security network is being shaped in Asia. There is an attempt to involve China in the continent’s development, similarly to the EU’s efforts regarding Russia.\n\nIstanbul hosted the United Nations Habitat II Conference which focused on urbanisation. The conference and related NGO events attracted some 15000 to 20000 participants. The Finnish 29-member delegation was headed by Minister of the Environment Pekka Haavisto and also included Minister of Social Affairs and Health Sinikka Mönkäre. The Conference dealt with the problems and opportunities created by urbanisation. Other central themes were \"adequate shelter for all” and \"sustainable human settlements development”. UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali awarded 12 of the 600 competing cities and organisations for the improvement of their urban environments. In addition to general discussions, the conference focused on devising an action plan.\n\nA foreign ministers’ meeting of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC) was held in Berlin. NATO members as well as NACC and PfP partner countries took part in the meeting which focused on cooperation within the NACC and PfP framworks, and the role of Partnership for Peace in regional security. Under-Secretary of State Jaakko Blomberg represented Finland at the meeting. A NATO foreign ministers’ meeting in Berlin the previous day saw the creation of the \"separable but not separate” Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF). These forces can be deployed outside of the NATO territory e.g. in crisis management and peace missions. If needed, they can be used by the EU’s defence community WEU. The approval of the CJTF concept was made possible by France’s change of course in NATO. Finland confirmed its willingness to participate in the new CJTF command system, and in a programme of military assistance to Estonia. A common interpretation in Berlin was that Russia is still against NATO’s enlargement, but opposes it in a more moderate way, focusing on the military and not the political implications of the enlargement.\n\nThe Government gave a preliminary EU Commission budget proposal to the Parliament. The increase in EU expenditure has been set at three percent, which is equal to the increase in member states’ public spending in general. The Finnish Ministry of Finance supports discipline in the EU budget and considers that the final sum next year should not exceed this year’s expenditure. Finland stresses that the improvement of employment should be visible throughout the EU budget. The expenditure in the preliminary EU budget is about 524 billion markka in commitments and about 490 billion markka in payments. Finland expects that the recruitment promises given in connection with EU accession are going to be considered in negotiations between EU institutions during 1996, as agreed. The recruitment promises must also be fulfilled in next year’s budget. Finland would increase the funding of biotechnology, information and communications technology, and environmental technology projects in EU research programmes. Finland also intends to request a report of the progress of the Baltic Sea cooperation. Finland considers that a revision of the EU’s employment and salary benefits is needed. Furthermore, Finland hopes that options will be surveyed for the funding of pension payments.\n\nCentre Party Chairman Esko Aho said that if need be, the party will hold an additional party congress in order to determine the party’s position regarding Finland’s membership in the Economic and Monetary Union. Aho considered the matter so important that the Centre Party needs a party congress position. He believed that the Centre Party would not decide its stance until it is known which countries are going to join and how the relationship between EMU and non-EMU countries will be arranged. Finland is among the first countries seeking to join the EMU probably in early 1998. The next annual Centre party congress is in summer 1998. Aho said he hopes that the Government refrains from joining the ERM too soon. In the Centre party organ Suomenmaa on 6 June, Aho proposed an advisory referendum on Finland’s potential participation in EMU Stage Three, in case the project materialises and the Government proposes to join. In Aho’s opinion, a referendum would be justified since this is an important national decision.\n\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Tarja Halonen defended at the Parliament the previous week’s decision by the Government to grant Nokia permission to export field artillery computing equipment to Indonesia. Halonen told that the Government had concluded there were no obstacles to granting the licence. She said that the EU’s and its member states’ position on arms exports to Indonesia was taken into account in reaching the decision. Halonen stated that the arms deal was a follow-up to a first delivery that was approved in 1994. Minister of Defence Anneli Taina concurred with the Foreign Minister. The issue was raised by a group of MPs who wondered how Finnish arms exports policy fits together with the respect of human rights. On 12 June, the two ministers submitted a report on arms trade to the Parliament Foreign Affairs Committee. According to the chairman of the Committee Markus Aaltonen, the Committee will produce a report on the issue in the autumn from the point of view of human rights.\n\nAt their party congress in Helsinki, the Social Democratic Party espoused the view that Finland’s way in security policy is to stay \"out of military alliances and rely on national defence, and work for security solutions based on cooperation”. The party also assessed NATO: from the perspective of security NATO still has a central role, and it can make a great difference in maintaining stability even in Northern Europe. Finland should evaluate the NATO enlargement process chiefly through the question of Northern European security and stability. SDP’s view is that Finland would do well to fulfill the EMU Stage Three criteria, if only to ensure the stability of Finnish economic policy and freedom of operation.\n\nAt the press conference of the Social Democrats’ party congress, Prime Minister Lipponen who was elected chairman of the party assured that the Finnish markka would not be connected to the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) ths summer. The President approved a new Monetary Act that entered into force on June 10th. It makes it possible to end the floating of the markka and joining the ERM. Lipponen estimated that postponing the ERM connection would not hinder Finland from joining the EMU.\n\nChina carried out an underground nuclear test at the Lop Nor testing site in Xinjiang , northwestern China. China started nuclear testing in 1964, and this was the 44thtest in the area. China announced its intention to interrupt testing by September, but it would first carry out one test detonation \"to ensure the safety of its nuclear weapons”. The test caused an international uproar. Foreign Minister Halonen said she was very disappointed. Finland intends along with the other Nordic countries to express its negative view to the Chinese foreign ministry in Beijing.\n\nA research institute focusing on security issues that was envisioned by President Ahtisaari will not be established in Helsinki. A working group led by Minister Jaakko Iloniemi that considered the idea presented its conclusions to Prime Minister Lipponen. The report stemmed from a suggestion made by President Ahtisaari one year ago at the 20th anniversary celebration of the CSCE. The President proposed the creation of an independent research institution meeting high standards of quality. The working group concluded however that a new research programme to be launched at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs is the most suitable environment for research on security.\n\nPresident Ahtisaari spoke at a meeting of the KTV (trade union for the municipal sector) in Helsinki on Finnish security policy and a changing Europe. The President hoped that the democratisation of Russia continues. Economic and political isolation of Russia would be a setback for peace in Europe. In his view, a continued democratisation would make Russia a closer neighbour. Ahtisaari restated his position that Finland has no reason to join NATO. According to him, joining the alliance would not improve Finland’s security and stability in Northern Europe and the Baltic Sea region. The Pres"
