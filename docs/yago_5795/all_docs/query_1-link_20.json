        "text": "After working with dedication and a commitment to excellence at Black Eagle Consulting for fourteen years, Vimal Vimalaraj has risen through the ranks to become vice president.\n\nWhen Vimal Vimalaraj received his undergraduate degree from his native Sri Lanka, he knew pursuing his graduate degree would be essential to following his dreams. He applied to and was accepted by many schools in the United States, but he chose the University of Nevada, Reno on the strength of its civil engineering program.\n\n“I had friends at UNR, and I had heard a lot of good things,” Vimalaraj said. “I chose the University in part because it offered an assistantship. For an international student—coming from an average, non-wealthy family in a developing country—financial assistance was very important.”\n\nWhen he arrived on campus, Vimalaraj received mentorship from Professor Emeritus Gary Norris and Professor Raj Siddharthan. Early in his time at the University, Vimalaraj impressed Siddharthan with his ability to adapt to a new position as a teaching assistant, noting how quickly he overcame the challenges associated with teaching students in a new country.\n\n“We are both from Sri Lanka, so I knew him from day one,” Professor Siddharthan said. “We all held him in high regard. We knew he was going to go places. And after his master’s, he took a position at Black Eagle Consulting, which is a top firm. He climbed up very steadily.”\n\nFor fourteen years, Vimalaraj has worked diligently, advancing through the ranks and building on his Nevada education with a wealth of experience in the field. In recognition of his accomplishments, on June 16, Black Eagle Consulting announced Vimalaraj as its new vice president. Of the appointment, Vimalaraj said, “It feels great to be recognized for years of progress, hard work, passion for geotechnical engineering and a willingness to learn.”\n\nSiddharthan added, “We are very proud of him.”\n\nLasting impact through 1,000 geotechnical investigation reports…and counting\n\nWhen Vimalaraj started at Black Eagle Consulting, he began as a technician in the geotechnical/soil laboratory, but one of his first projects brought him back to his alma mater. He performed soil analysis for the Earthquake Engineering Laboratory, and in time, as he moved up the ranks to project engineer then project manager and later engineering division manager in 2014, work frequently brought him to campus.\n\nDuring Vimalaraj’s time, he has worked on geotechnical investigation reports for the William N and Myriam Pennington Medical Education Building, the Center for Molecular Medicine, the Stadium Club, Great Basin Hall and the site of the William N. Pennington Engineering Building, scheduled to open later this year. Even now, he is busy evaluating the location designated for a proposed new building for the College of Business on the south end of campus.\n\nThe impact and growing legacy of Black Eagle Consulting is undeniable. The buildings their work supports will last for many years, and each new structure is a well-deserved source of satisfaction for Vimalaraj.\n\n“I still remember the first site on which I performed field exploration—the Texas Roadhouse in south Reno,” he said. “When I pass by buildings we’ve worked on, I always feel proud.”\n\nThrough his steady ascent at Black Eagle Consulting, Vimalaraj has written 1,000 geotechnical investigation reports. These reports provide vital information about the surface and subsurface materials at the site of an intended construction project. For buildings, the reports inform many decisions, including foundation types, locations and construction techniques. Vimalaraj’s analyses ensure the safety and longevity of new structures.\n\n“For the last six years, we have produced 100 to 150 reports a year,” Vimalaraj said. “At BEC, we now have a library of 3,000 reports, primarily focused on Reno and the surrounding area. And this is important, because the more you work in a given area, the more you understand about the soils you encounter. We have very deep roots, and because we have a library of 3,000 reports, we have knowledge to draw on that makes us a very competitive, local firm.”\n\nWhen Vimalaraj speaks of his profession, it is difficult to miss a deep abiding sense of curiosity and intellectual rigor. In fact, for those hoping to follow in his footsteps, Vimalaraj notes the necessity of curiosity.\n\n“You have to be passionate about the field,” he said. “Set a goal to be a good geotechnical engineer, then don’t worry about what position you start with when you leave the University. There is a lot to learn in the industry. This is a field with a lot of unknowns. We deal with natural deposits that are here for millions of years and the conditions could drastically change depending on the site location. A lot of engineering judgement is needed. When you run into something you don’t understand, do your best to find an answer, but don’t be afraid to ask questions. Learn and ask questions. Your effort shows your value.”\n\nVimalaraj’s spirit of vitality and engagement doesn’t stop at the job. He finds balance in life by playing volleyball, mastering landscape photography and traveling. It’s a good thing, too, because it was during a trip with friends to Yellowstone that he met his wife, fellow Nevada graduate Yuko Kobayashi ’06 (international business). They have two children, an eight-year-old boy and a three-year-old girl.\n\n“I started with landscape and travel photography, but now, with the kids, I have started to understand the value of portrait photography,” he said. “It is important to find a balance in life. I may work late and complete work some weekdays, but the weekends are always with and for the family.”\n\nBuilding on Black Eagle Consulting’s commitment to the community\n\nBlack Eagle Consulting’s commitment to the community it serves extends beyond the quality of its work and the relationships its built with its clients. The firm routinely hires graduates from the College of Engineering and recently named fellow Nevada alumna Lindsey Owens project engineer. BEC’s consistent philanthropic support of the University has led to its induction as a Silver Benefactor in the University’s Honor Court. And when it came time to perform a geotechnical investigation of the site where the new William N. Pennington Engineering Building now stands, the company volunteered its services.\n\nFor Vimalaraj, the caring spirit of the firm hit close to home. When he applied for U.S. citizenship, the company sponsored his application, and fourteen years after he first arrived in the United States, Vimalaraj became a citizen with his colleagues at his side at his Naturalization Ceremony.\n\n“I came as an immigrant with a student visa,” Vimalaraj said. “I’m thankful to BEC for providing the path and opportunity for my career advancement, and I was honored when BEC principals came to congratulate me at the citizenship oath ceremony two years ago.”\n\nAs Vimalaraj takes on his new role as vice president, he looks forward to building on this tradition of supporting the northern Nevada community. He said, “Understanding the value of the firm, I look forward to being part of leadership and continuing to enhance our community engagement.”"
