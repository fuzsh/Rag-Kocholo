        "text": "Details of the upcoming 2017 Summer Drama season are slowly being revealed. One future drama that has tons of fans buzzing is NTV’s “Uchi no otto wa shigoto ga dekinai”, where Ryo Nishikido and Mayu Matsuoka will be playing a married couple.\n\nThe main character in “Uchi no otto wa shigoto wa dekinai” (My husband can’t do his work) is Kobayashi Tsukasa (Ryo Nishikido). On the surface Kobayashi seems to have it all. High income, good looks, and a young pretty wife. However, what Kobayashi’s wife Sayaka (Mayu Matsuoka) doesn’t realize is that Kobayashi is pretty terrible at what he does. Many of his co-workers see him as a huge burden. Even his junior co-workers poke fun and bully him over his constant mistakes.\n\nSayaka really admires her husband, so Kobayasha tries his best to hide the situation from her. Things don’t get better which leads to Kobayashi considering quitting, but Sayaka finds out she’s pregnant. With his job being the primary source of income he’s stuck in a bind. Sayaka eventually finds out about the work situation and helps Kobayashi overcome his issues.\n\nA low quality video of Ryo and Mayu introducing “Uchi no otto wa shigoto ga dekinai” can be seen below!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehvay6yZCQA"
