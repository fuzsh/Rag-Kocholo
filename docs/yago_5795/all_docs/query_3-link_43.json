        "text": "Chapter 21: The Tomato’s Trial (7/19/98)\n\nEvery Sentai season has one or two of THOSE infamous eps. Ep 21 of Gingaman is one of those two infamous ones (the other being Ep 39). And this is also sadly what’s being used for Gingaman’s summer vacation ep to get away and film some other location shots, like the beach or the country mountains, so it’s a bit of a waste. The Gingaman cast as usual gives it their all, but it’s a shame about the script itself.\n\nThis episode brings back Miss Suzuko, who… does nothing except be the bringer of tomatoes, as well as the one who has the knowledge to cure tomato hate, just cause her home happens to be near the beach. Gouki’s character isn’t challenged in the slightest in this episode. In fact, so many of the scenes in this ep practically amounts to nothing other than some cheap little laughs (drawing on Gouki’s face, Hayate talking to a dog, or the cast spying on Gouki in hopes he’ll confess his love to Miss Suzuko).\n\nBudo sends out his 3rd of his Four Shoguns (way to waste one of Budo’s top 4 minions show), Houretsudou, to go retrieve the Ginga Lights by destroying… you guessed it, red round food (aka tomatoes). Houretsudou early on does manage to prove he’s formidable with a neat shot where he blasts Hayate, and sends him far into the waters (this level of power sadly does not last).\n\nThe plot of this ep is that all 5 of them will need to be at full strength to defeat Houretsudou, whom Ryouma describes as “their hardest battle yet” (right, sure). Hayate will need to eat a tomato (which apparently has the same nutrients as a fruit from the Ginga Forest, which can instantly heal Wind Warriors) so that he can help the others defeat him. However, Hayate hates tomatoes so much, that he can’t bring himself to eat it, resulting in Hikaru rightfully chewing him out for being so picky with food during such a crucial time. And yeah, I agree with Hikaru. But also, I feel this is just overall a poor script. Hayate just feels so out of character here. I mean, the entire planet is at risk of Daitanix reviving and swallowing it up (whom I doubt is picky over which planets he likes to eat. Can you imagine Daitanix reviving and deciding not to eat Earth cause it “tastes bad?”), yet Hayate is being too picky over food? The real Hayate would never let something like this stop him. I have no idea what secondary writer Arakawa was thinking when writing this ep (I guess his next paycheck).\n\nThe script gets even more ridiculous when Gouki asks Miss Suzuko what the cure to hating tomatoes are. They tell Hayate that there’s a special tomato out in the mountains which Gouki labels as “The world’s…. no, the GALAXY’s most delicious tomatoes!” Um…. what Arakawa? Yes, this is the actual dialogue which was written into the show. Did Takatera forget to tell Arakawa that this isn’t Carranger? Of course, Hayate stupidly falls for this story (which they reveal at the end was just a made up story to trick him into eating AND liking a tomato). Now, sure, I can totally buy the concept of “the galaxy’s greatest fruit” in the mystical sense, if it had just been established from the start of the ep. But no, this is just a regular tomato which has just been fluffed up with a silly legend, which just so conveniently happens to be in the mountains behind Miss Suzuko’s house. I dunno how Hayate didn’t find this story strange. But man, this ep also makes the world of Gingaman feel puny, despite the location shots.\n\nGouki decides to run into the mountains to grab the “special” tomato for Hayate…. which I have to question, why didn’t Miss Suzuko just give Hayate a tomato and claim it was the Galaxy’s Most Delicious Tomato which she picked herself? That would’ve saved a lot of trouble. I mean, Gouki is running all the way into the mountains which are crawling with Barban, just to grab a regular tomato, just so Hayate will eat it and stop being picky with his food. On top of that, the other 3 Gingaman are trying to keep Houretsudou busy while taking a constant beating… geez, by the point Hayate heals, everyone else is going to be so damaged that they won’t be able to beat Houretsudou! Though regardless, the ep cops out at the end after Hayate eats the tomato, and Hayate ALONE demolishes Houretsudou, with lots and lots of cruddy green screen (what is this? Go-onger?).\n\nThe ep also squeezes in a pointless scene with BullBlack so you won’t forget he’s still around. But man, what a friggin weird ep of all places to bring Budo out to do his own dirty work. Sanbash confronted the heroes like, 5 times during his reign. Budo, only 3 times. And this is one of them. The scene tries to tease a potentially cool fight between BullBlack and Budo, but it doesn’t last long and just cops out. After that, we don’t see either of them for the rest of the ep. This scene does however introduce a certain chest pain in BullBlack, which will continue on for the next few eps.\n\nNow let’s talk about the meme which this episode spawned. The single most epic tomato eating scene in all of television. Right down to Gouki yelling at Hayate to eat the tomato, to Hayate screaming in rage, as he chomps down into it. The scene climaxing with Hayate having this goofy happy look on his face as he screams “IT’S GOOD!” With Gouki also having just as goofy of a grin as he shows how proud he is of Hayate, while elbowing a Yaatoto in the face. So yeah, apparently the cure to not hating tomatoes is to will yourself to not hating them… right. Like, I get the message is to not be picky about your food, cause you’ll be a lot happier and healthier that way. But geez, come up with a better script to convey that. On top of that, why is this even a thing in Gingaman? Gingaman should be focusing on other things than just cheap messages like this.\n\nGingaman would take a break the next week, before finally getting to the epic multi-part conclusion of the Budo arc."
