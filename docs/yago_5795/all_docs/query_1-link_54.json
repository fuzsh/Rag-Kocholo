        "text": "One of my main goals for this yearâ€™s January in Japan reading was to get to some books, and writers, Iâ€™d been meaning to try for a while, and todayâ€™s choice certainly fits that description, with several people having recommended it to me over the years. Weâ€™re heading back to the eighteenth century, where modern medicine is in its infancy, and an ambitious doctor is determined to do his bit to bring the science into the modern age â€“ with the help, of course of a loving wife ðŸ™‚\n\n*****\n\nSawako Ariyoshiâ€™s The Doctorâ€™s Wife (translated by Wakako Hironaka and Ann Siller Kostant, published by Kodansha International) is the story of Kae, a young woman from a well-to-do family in the Wakayama region who becomes fascinated at a young age by a beautiful woman in the neighbourhood. Otsugi is the wife of the local doctor-surgeon, Naomichi Hanaoka, and Kae is overjoyed when she is later chosen to be the wife of the doctorâ€™s son, and successor, Seishu. While Kaeâ€™s father isnâ€™t convinced, mainly because of the mismatch in status, heâ€™s gradually won over by his daughterâ€™s wishes and his wifeâ€™s persuasion, and the young woman goes off to live with her new family, even though her husband is still in Kyoto finishing his medical studies.\n\nIn the early days of her life at the doctorâ€™s house, Kae enjoys the novelty of being useful, working hard at weaving to earn money for her husbandâ€™s education, and sheâ€™s overjoyed at forming what she believes to be a strong bond with her mother-in-law. However, when her husband finally comes home to take over his fatherâ€™s business, she realises her mistake. From the moment the new doctor crosses the threshold, Otsugi begins to brutally snub poor Kae, changing her position from treasured daughter to outcast. You see, thereâ€™s only room for one woman in his life, and Otsugi will do whatever it takes to monopolise her sonâ€™s affections.\n\nThe Doctorâ€™s Wife is based on the real-life story of Seishu Hanaoka, the son of a rural doctor, and his obsession with finding a way to operate successfully on patients thought too weak to survive the procedure. After experimenting with his own anaesthesia over decades (including on animals, so consider this a trigger warning for unwitting readersâ€¦), he eventually managed to perfect it and use it in surgery. Surprisingly, this success came decades before the much-heralded breakthroughs with chloroform and ether in the west, but the advances were largely unknown because of Japanâ€™s isolation from the rest of the world.\n\nYet as the title suggests, Ariyoshiâ€™s focus here is not on Seishu, but on Kae, the woman behind the legend. From the first pages, introducing Kae in her childhood, we see her obsession with the beautiful Otsugi, and when the doctorâ€™s wife makes a brief appearance at a funeral, the young girl is stunned:\n\nOthers also stared, since Otsugi seldom came to public gatherings. Her presence that day reminded them of her past, and her youthfulness after bearing seven children amazed them. Women over forty were generally haggard and unattractive from childbearing and years of hard labour. But Otsugi looked at least ten years younger than her age and quite elegant and dignified in her funeral attire. Kae may not have been the only one to see a halo.\n\np.12 (Kodansha International, 1981)\n\nThe seeds are sewn here of a fascination with the doctorâ€™s family, meaning Kae is keen to accept when the unusual proposal comes.\n\nOf course, in some ways Ariyoshiâ€™s book has an ambiguous title as there are actually two doctorâ€™s wives featured in the novel, Otsugi and Kae, with the main focus being the intense rivalry between them. Kae is initially overwhelmed by the sudden turn in her mother-in-lawâ€™s affections; having welcomed her as a daughter, Otsugi shows great jealousy towards Kae when Seishu returns, leaving the young woman mystified â€“ why would she push her away after selecting her to be her sonâ€™s partner? This feeling soon gives way, though, to one of determination to stand her ground and fight back, using her advantages as Seishuâ€™s partner to gain his trust and affection.\n\nThe story, then, is one of a bitter feud between two women determined to occupy the top spot in the young doctorâ€™s affections, and the irony is that in a book featuring two strong, passionate women, theyâ€™re doing everything for a man. Both are willing to make great sacrifices to help Seishu in his career, and this all culminates in the doctorâ€™s human experiments, where both women spend days asleep under the influence of his experimental anaesthesia.\n\nCleverly, the book sweeps the reader along, keeping our eyes on Kae and Otsugi as we wait to see who will come out on top. However, there are several other characters featured, too, and itâ€™s only later, far too late, that we see whatâ€™s really happening. In their own way, Otsugiâ€™s daughters, Okatsu and Koriku, are also sacrificed for Seishuâ€™s success, unlikely to marry as theyâ€™re needed to bring in money and keep the household running. While Kae is blinded by her need to win Seishu over, itâ€™s Koriku who sees through all the sacrifices the women are asked to make:\n\nDonâ€™t you think men are incredible? It seemsâ€¦ that an intelligent person like my brotherâ€¦ would have noticed the friction between you and Motherâ€¦ But throughout he shrewdly pretended he didnâ€™t see anythingâ€¦ which resulted in both you and Mother drinking the medicineâ€¦ Well, isnâ€™t it so? I think this sort of tension among femalesâ€¦ isâ€¦ to the advantageâ€¦ ofâ€¦ every male. (p.163)\n\nItâ€™s an insight that shatters Kaeâ€™s beliefs, but one that comes far too late for most of the familyâ€™s women.\n\nThe story of Seishu Hanaoka would be fascinating in its own right (a reminder that not everything happened first in the west), but Ariyoshiâ€™s fictional slant on the doctorâ€™s story provides a different, slightly more sombre slant on the tale. The sacrifices required in every great career, of course, are not always offered up by those who get the glory, and the great woman behind the great man line rings particularly true here. In fact, there are several, and itâ€™s clear that the doctorâ€™s achievements would have been impossible without the support of an entire family."
