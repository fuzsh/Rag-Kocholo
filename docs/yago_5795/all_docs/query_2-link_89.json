        "text": "Part 3 your way comes.\n\n80. Sakaguchi Daisuke (阪口 大助)\n\nWhy you should know him: The (then) rookie 19-year old seiyuu who landed a dream debut role as the youngest lead character in a Gundam series ever.\n\nAll about Daisuke: Sakaguchi’s naturally high-pitched voice makes him a favourite casting for teenage male leads and that typifies the type of roles he has had over the past 16 years, although he is of course, perfectly capable of voicing less conventional roles – witness Shonen Bat in Paranoia Agent.\n\nBest known roles: Uso Evin in Mobile Suit Victory Gundam, Shimura Shinpachi inGintama, Yamazaki Kaoru in N.H.K. ni Youkoso!, Sawaki Souemon Tadayasu inMoyashimonWhat else you should know: He was part of the mildly successful 90s male seiyuu idol unit E.M.U. (Entertainment Music Unit) with Ishikawa Hideo, Okiayu Ryotaro, Hayashi Nobutoshi (now Canna Nobutoshi) and Midorikawa Hikaru.\n\nFavourite Sakaguchi role: Jacuzzi Splot of Baccano! is characteristic of the whiny loser type of roles he gets, but him and Nice (Kobayashi Yu) made a good pairing. MyGintama-loving brain however, is mortified by the thought of a Shinpachi-Sacchan coupling [same seiyuu pair]…\n\n79. Nakahara Mai (中原 麻衣)\n\nWhy you should know her: One of the 00s’ most prolific leading ladies.\n\nSignature line: (>_<)b Omochikaeri!!!!\n\nAll about Mai: Possessing a sweet and fairly versatile voice, Mai has managed to forge a very strong presence this decade, typically voicing your average girl-next-door. Since debuting in 2002 she has averaged 2-3 lead roles per year – quite impressive when you consider most seiyuu would be lucky to get 1-2 their entire careers.\n\nBest known roles: Furukawa Nagisa in CLANNAD, Tokiha Mai in Mai-HiME series, Ryuuguu Rena in Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, Kasugano Midori in Midori no HibiWhat else you should know: Best remembered for… other things like thatyuri PV(which still cracks me up everytime I watch it), the resemblance to a certain rock guitarist as well as that LOL appearance in Joshi Anna Icchokusen.\n\nFavourite Mai role: She was in her element as May Wong from Kaleido Star, a character that was annoying and hilarious in equal turns yet always fun.\n\n78. Mitsuya Yuji (三ツ矢 雄二)\n\nWhy you should know him: Former male seiyuu idol turned actor turned sound director.\n\nMore on Mitsuya: Most popular in the late mid-80s during the 101-episode run ofTouch, Mitsuya has in recent years done more sound directing including working onKumo no Mukou, Yakusoku no Basho and 5 Centimeters Per Second.\n\nBest known roles: Uesugi Tatsuya in Touch, Virgo Shaka in Saint Seiya, Aoi Hyoma inCombattler VWhat else you should know: He teamed up with fellow veteran seiyuu & Touch co-star Hidaka Noriko to form a new seiyuu agency called Combination at the start of 2009, who have other old-timers like Sakakibara Yoshiko and Higuchi Chieko on their books. Newer anime fans might recognise Mitsuya as one of the two voices of Irabu Ichiro in Kuchu Buranko (he covers the middle and older versions).\n\n77. Miyamura Yuko (宮村 優子)\n\nWhy you should know her: Famous for voicing one of the loudest, most obnoxious and annoying characters in anime history, as well as having a never-ending string of bad luck.\n\nAll about Miyamu: She seems to have a black cat following her everywhere she goes – a series of bad press and illnesses overshadowing her career. Supposed appearances in adult videos (strongly denied), throat ailments that forced a hiatus, a shotgun wedding and the diagnosis of Graves’ disease in 2007 are just some of the eventful happenings in her life.\n\nBest known roles: Asuka Langley Soryu in Neon Genesis Evangelion, Toyama Kazuha inDetective Conan, Tamano Hinagiku in Wedding Peach, Alyssa Sears in Mai-HiMEWhat else you should know: Miyamu was the girl in the introductory video in theBattle Royale movie – you know, the one wearing the orange shirt explaining the game’s gruesome rules. Her second husband Seki Takayuki is a stuntman and they have a 5-year old daughter. For a while she was involved in sound work having directed the seiyuu in Loveless, but due to her illness, has stopped working in this area.\n\n76. Takagi Wataru (高木 渉)\n\nWhy you should know him: He is the voice of ONIZUKA EIKICHI, 22-SAI. YOROSHIKU!!!\n\nAbout Wataru: He tends to get saddled with comedy roles a lot (he’s even the Japanese dub for Daffy Duck) and Western fans will best recognise him for his GTOrole, Tobi in Naruto:Shippuden and as Shiba Ganju in Bleach, but he can also mix it up – he was the main antagonist in Slayers Try .\n\nBest known roles: Onizuka Eikichi in GTO, Garrod Rain in After War Gundam X, Kojima Genta & Takagi Wataru in Detective Conan, Aoki Masaru in Hajime no Ippo, Valgaav inSlayers TryIn case you’re wondering…: Yes he does voice Takagi Wataru in Conan, the character is actually named after him.\n\nWhat else you should know: Legend goes that when Takagi got married, he and his wife did not cut a wedding cake but instead, cut a large onigiri made in the likeness of his Conan character Kojima Genta.\n\n75. Tomiyama Kei (富山 敬)\n\nWhy you should know him: The Seiyuu Awards’ special merit award is named in his memory.\n\nAll about Tomiyama: With his trademark aviator glasses, flashy shirts and skinny trousers, Tomiyama was one of the late 60s/70s original ‘versatile’ and most flamboyant male seiyuu, adept at playing good & bad guys while also providing narrations for various shows. His death from pancreatic cancer in 1995 shocked the industry, and over 10 of his roles at the time were passed on to the likes of Yamadera Koichi, Aono Takeshi and Horiuchi Kenyu.\n\nBest known roles: Kodai Susumu in Uchuu Senkan Yamato series, Yang-wen Li inLegend of the Galactic Heroes, Duke Fleed in Grendizer, Narrator in Time Bokan series\n\nWhat else you should know: Fellow seiyuu and close friend Ohara Noriko described him as a ‘genius’, while Fujiwara Keiji narrated Keroro Gunsou with the aim of creating a voice ‘like Tomiyama Kei’s’. Posthumously honoured with a Life Achievement award in the First Seiyuu Awards in 2007, his name now lives on in a special merit award that has been awarded to the likes of Furuya Toru and Yamadera Koichi.\n\n74. Ohtani Ikue (大谷 育江)\n\nWhy you should know her: A 20+ year industry veteran who tends to be remembered for the weird animals/dolls she voices.\n\nSignature line: “Pika-pika! Pi-pikachu!”\n\nAll about Ikue: Ikue made her debut in Maison Ikkoku back in 1986. Most of her characters/voices tend to fall within the ‘child’ or ‘non-human’ categories, unsurprising since she has a rather high-pitched, cutesy voice. One of the original loli-obasans (she’s now 44).\n\nBest known roles: Pikachu in Pokemon franchise, Tony Tony Chopper in One Piece, Gash Bell in Konjiki no Gash Bell!!, Tsuburaya Mitsuhiko in Detective ConanWhat else you should know: Whilst on maternity leave in 2006, the seiyuu who temporarily took over her roles include Orikasa Ai, Kugimiya Rie, Noda Junko and Koorogi Satomi – certainly a strange bunch of very, very different types of seiyuu.\n\nFavourite Iku-chan role: Probably Merle the cat-girl in Escaflowne nyaaa.\n\n73. Sakakibara Yoshiko (榊原 良子)\n\nWhy you should know her: Looking for someone to voice intimidating, tough-as-nails ladies/queens/baddies? You’ve got your woman here.\n\nBest known roles: Sylia Stingray in Bubblegum Crisis, Haman Karn & Mouar Pharaoh inMobile Suit Zeta Gundam/Gundam ZZ, Integra Hellsing in Hellsing, Nagumo Shinobu inMobile Police Patlabor, Princess Kushana in Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, Frederica Greenhill in Legend of the Galactic Heroes, Queen Nehellenia in Sailor MoonWhat else you should know: She’s an Oshii Mamoru favourite and is involved in many of his works, from the Ghost in the Shell series/movies to Patlabor to Sky Crawlers and even his Kerberos Panzer Jäger radio drama series.\n\n72. Hayami Show (速水 奨)\n\nWhy you should know him: He of the oh-so-smooth, oh-so-deep, oh-so-chilling voice.\n\nAbout Hayami…: Hard to believe he’s past 50 already! It seems since getting cast as Aizen in Bleach his number of bad guy roles has been increasing – Prism Ark, 07-Ghost,Sengoku BASARA to name a few….\n\nBest known roles: Maximillian Jenius in Macross, Aizen Sosuke in Bleach, Nicholas D. Wolfwood in Trigun, Gavlet Gablae in Heavy Metal L-Gaim, Burn Bunnings in Aura Battler Dunbine, Ginias Saharin in Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS TeamWhat else you should know: He’s married to fellow seiyuu Igarashi Rei, and his nephew Hayami Hideyuki is also a seiyuu. Looks like uncle is getting the latter some help – he’s had roles in WHITE ALBUM and Prism Ark, both shows that Hayami worked on.\n\nFavourite Show role: I don’t know about it being a favourite, but Eiri Masami fromSerial Experiments Lain is one character that sticks in my mind for his… creepiness?\n\n71. Yajima Akiko (矢島 晶子)\n\nWhy you should know her: The voice behind the naughtiest kid on TV (aka Shin-chan).\n\nSignature line: HEERO!!!! HEEEEERRRRO!!! HEEEEEEEEEERROOOOOO!!! (just joking… I think)\n\nAbout her voice…: Unless Akiko’s doing her Shin-chan voice I can barely recognise her – I would say it’s a testament to her versatility and ability to pull off almost any voice required. It still makes me scratch my head that the same person voiced Shin-chan, Relena and Kyoko (Unchi!! Unchi!!) in Denno Coil.\n\nBest known roles: Shin-chan in Crayon Shin-chan, Shiina Tsubasa in Figure 17, Haydée in Gankutsuou, Relena Darlian/Peacecraft in Mobile Suit Gundam Wing, Kohaku inInuYashaFavourite Akiko role: The dual roles of Riku and Diva in Blood+ – way to go to voice a character that rapes and kills your other character.\n\nI’m hoping these lists provide a more balanced view for the many seiyuu fans out there who focus on either female or male seiyuu exclusively, or watch certain types of anime that tend to employ the same group of actors over and over again. I’m sure not a lot of people can claim to watch shonen, kids’ anime, super robot shows and bishoujo-game adaptations all at the same time so there’s a lot of unfamiliar yet very noteworthy seiyuu out there in need of some extra lovin’!\n\nQuick Links:\n\n100-9190-81\n\nSecond installment in the series! Turns out that the previous post was my 500th (not counting all those I purged when I moved from Blogger), and it seems like a good way to mark the milestone. However I also saw on my dashboard that I currently have 4,444 comments, not a very desirable number for a Chinese like me…. ~_~\n\nAnyway I’m having fun working on this, which is like a shot of nostalgia in the arm for me as I recall the seiyuu that lit up the industry in various ways, be it through their memorable performances, singing or just being great personalities. Good to see from the comments that people are enjoying this little ride through seiyuu history as well – so on to the list!\n\n90. Utsumi Kenji (内海 賢二)\n\nWhy you should know him: One of the coolest granddads around, as well as being the founder of the growing Ken Production agency – he worked tirelessly to get it up and running back in the 80s and today it employs the likes of Konishi Katsuyuki, Saiga Mitsuki, Yukino Satsuki and Ito Shizuka.\n\nAll about Utsumi: His career stretches back to the 60s with roles in GeGeGe no Kitaroand Mach GoGoGo, taking in a boatload of anime as well as CM work and dubbing over for Sammy Davis Jr. and Robert Shaw. He’s married to fellow seiyuu Nomura Michiko (original voice of Shizuka in Doraemon) and their son currently serves as the president of KenPro.\n\nBest known roles: Raoh in Hokuto no Ken, Shenron in Dragon Ball, Norimaki Senbei inDr. SlumpWhat else you should know: Utsumi has mentioned before that he is a Mizuki Nana fan and even went to see her live concerts. He’s currently co-hosting the Kampfer radio show (his first ever) with Nakajima Megumi and certainly seems to be having fun flirting with the young girls (especially Inoue Marina).\n\nMy favourite Utsumi role: *sparkle* Alex Louis *flex muscle* Armstrong in bothFullmetal Alchemist adaptations.\n\n89. Shiina Hekiru (椎名 へきる)\n\nWhy you should know her: The only seiyuu in history to appear on Music Station.\n\nAll about Hekiru: One of the 90s’ more famous seiyuu idols, Hekiru was different in that she was a bit more of a rocker than your traditional bubblegum-pop-flogging seiyuu idols. Having always focused more on music rather than voice acting she’s notched some impressive sales figures, releasing a total of 36 singles and 14 albums since her debut in 1993. Apart from the distinction of being the only seiyuu to have performed on Japanese mainstream TV’s most famous live music programme Music Station, Hekiru is one of only 4 (soon to be 5) seiyuu to have played at the Budokan.\n\nBest known roles: Shidou Hikaru in Magic Knight Rayearth, Hatsuseno Alpha inYokohama Kaidashi Kiko, Kamitsuki Yuka in Kemonozume, Elissis in Eden’s BowyWhat else you should know: Her star has faded considerably in recent years, but she’s been taking steps to resurrect her career – first, by moving to Lantis from Sony Records. Her last major anime role was as Yamawaro in the third season of Jigoku Shoujo.\n\nMy favourite Hekiru role: Alpha in Yokohama Shopping Log, the sweetest yuri robot show around.\n\n88. Imai Yuka (今井 由香)\n\nWhy you should know her: One of the earlier ‘female seiyuu who does mostly male characters’, although her versatility stretched from little boys to onee-san types. Very good singer too.\n\nBest known roles: Jinto in the Crest of the Stars franchise, Mamiya Otaru in Saber Marionette J, Renamon in Digimon Tamers, Okita Kai in Bakuso Kyodai Let’s & Go!!What else you should know: Fell ill for a period in the mid-00s and had to hand over her roles in Demonbane and Precure Splash Star to other seiyuu. She has been doing more video games in recent years (Final Fantasy XII, the Tales series) but recently signed up with Atomic Monkey and has returned to regular TV work with Duel Masters.\n\nMy favourite Yuka role: Jinto, obviously. Her gentle, soft-spoken voice balanced out Kawasumi Ayako’s brash Lafiel perfectly, and together they made one of the most fascinating couples in anime (ever).\n\n87. Inoue Yo (井上 瑤)\n\nWhy you should know her: One of the more popular voice actresses of the 80s, her career was cruelly cut short by lung cancer in 2003. She was 56.\n\nAll about Yo: Possessing a considerably lower voice than her fellow seiyuu of the day, Yo specialised at (or was pushed towards?) voicing tough-as-nail ladies.\n\nBest known roles: Sayla Mass in Mobile Suit Gundam, Kanuka Clancy in Mobile Police Patlabor, Ran in Urusei YatsuraWhat else you should know: Inoue has a lot of strange feathers in her cap – a graduate of Waseda University, she has been credited as a dancer, a broadcast writer and weirdest of all – a fortune teller.\n\nEven more stuff to know: In the mid-80s, she disappeared to India (+ other countries) on a 1-year trip, leaving other seiyuu to cover her regular roles at the time.\n\nMy favourite Yo role: The kick-ass, cool-as-ice (and possibly kuudere?) Kanuka. I like strong women! And now I shall admit to having read (and maybe dreamed up) Kanuka/Kumagami yuri fanfiction in the past…oh dear.\n\n86. Namikawa Daisuke (浪川 大輔)\n\nWhy you should know him: He’s one of the stars of today’s generation, often stepping into the leading man role but equally adept at villainous and token dumb characters – versatility is his main draw.\n\nAll about Namikawa: Started out life as a child actor but following the recommendation of kodanshiIchiryusai Teiyu, tried out for voice acting. He landed his first role at the age of 9 but only caught his first real break as Kamishiro Maiku in theOnegai Twins! series in 2003.\n\nBest known roles: Kurono Kei in GANTZ, Tanaka Koyuki in BECK, Fay D.Flourite inTsubasa Chronicle, Italy in Hetalia Axis PowersWhat else you should know: He must be the only male seiyuu I know who shapes his eyebrows so perfectly!\n\nMy favourite nmkw role: Dokkoida in Dokkoida, the greatest 2D anime hero ever.\n\n85. Miyano Mamoru (宮野 真守)\n\nWhy you should know him: Blessed with good looks and a great acting/singing voice, he’s one of the current decade’s brightest stars, not to mention its hottest male idol.\n\nAll about Mamo: Miyano got his start in showbiz fairly early, joining the Gekidan Himawari theatre troupe when he was in elementary school. He only got into voice acting after passing an audition for a dubbing role in Caitlin’s Way and in 2002, got the part of Riku in PS2 RPG Kingdom Hearts. Work in the Prince of Tennis musicals, BONES’s Wolf’s Rain and Soukyuu no Fafner followed, but it wasn’t until 2006 withOuran and DEATH NOTE that his career really took off.\n\nBest known roles: Setsuna F. Seiei in Mobile Suit Gundam 00, Yagami Light in DEATH NOTE, Suou Tamaki in Ouran Koukou Host Club, Ling Yao in Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Kiba in Wolf’s RainWhat else you should know: It would appear that his shotgun wedding in late 2008 (complete with foolish video message announcement) has had little long-term effect on Miyano’s career as he’s already on his second live tour, played at Animelo Summer Live and is still a regular in the Fullmetal Alchemist anime.\n\nMy favourite Mamo role: His performance as the goofy, narcissistic Tamaki was a royal blast – definitely the primary reason why Ouran was so memorable.\n\n84. Shimazu Saeko (島津 冴子)\n\nWhy you should know her: One of the few seiyuu to have had significant roles in all four major anime adaptations of Takahashi Rumiko’s works (Urusei Yatsura, Ranma 1/2, Inu Yasha, Maison Ikkoku)\n\nAll about Saeko: Sometimes soft-spoken, most other times loud and rude, Shimazu has often voiced ‘the other woman’, ‘the obnoxious one’, ‘the rival’, ‘psycho characters’… but rarely the lead heroine. Most prominent in the 80s, she now mostly does narrations as well as providing the voice announcements on the Keisei 3700 train and Hokusou 7300 lines.\n\nBest known roles: Four Murasame in Mobile Suit Z Gundam, Miyake Shinobu in Urusei Yatsura, Kuno Kodachi in Ranma 1/2, Ayase Megumi in Magical Angel Creamy Mami, Yuri in Dirty PairWhat else you should know: Shimazu has been involved in at least two pieces of casting controversy – the first when she refused to do a sequel to Dirty Pair without her original acting partner Tongu Kyoko, leading to the roles being recast (by Matsumoto Rica & Kouda Mariko). The second involved compilation movies for the Gundam series in 2005 – despite Shimazu having expressed her interest in reprising her role as Four Murasame, she was replaced by Yukana (rumours go that the sound director was having ‘improper relations’ with the younger seiyuu). Angry fans bombarded (and crashed) Yukana’s site in protest at the change.\n\nEven more stuff to know: Still maintains her fanclub ‘Blue Moon’, where she personally meets up with fans twice yearly for a chat and ‘tea parties’.\n\nMy favourite Sae role: The slightly unhinged Kodachi aka The Black Rose (OHOHOHO!), who would seemingly stop at nothing to get Ranma for herself.\n\n83. Yukino Satsuki (雪野 五月)\n\nWhy you should know her: Queen of the violent tsundere genre – if you’re looking for someone to voice a character in her mid-teens who likes beating up people one minute & tee-hee-hee blushing the next minute, Satsuki’s your gal (if character is under 13 years old look for Kugimiya Rie).\n\nAll about Satsuki: She’d wanted to become a seiyuu from a young age but had to work hard at persuading her family before they allowed her to move to Tokyo (from her hometown Kyoto) to pursue a career in the business. Graduating at the age of 21, things started slow but after major roles in Kiko-chan’s Smile, Chuuka Ichiban! andTrigun over the 1996-98 period her fortunes took a turn for the better and Satsuki’s since built up a CV that’s the envy of many.\n\nBest known roles: Higurashi Kagome in InuYasha, Chidori Kaname in Full Metal Panic!series, Sonozaki Mion/Shion in Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, Shihouin Yoruichi in BleachWhat else you should know: Apparently InuYasha mangaka Takahashi Rumiko described Satsuki as having a ‘cute-sounding scream’.\n\nMy favourite Satsuki role: Hard to pick one, but Otae from Gintama is a current fave – typically sweet-looking, mercilessly violent and a barrel of laughs.\n\n82. Touma Yumi (冬馬 由美)\n\nWhy you should know her: 1/3 of the Goddess Family Club, though it seems her popularity is eclipsed by that of fellow goddesses Inoue Kikuko and Hisakawa Aya.\n\nBest known roles: Urd in Ah! My Goddess, Emma in Victorian Romance Emma, Cecily Fairchild in Mobile Suit Gundam F91, Hongo Yui in Fushigi YugiWhat else you should know: She’s also well-known for her fighting game characters – Ling Xiaoyu in Tekken, Lei Fang in Dead or Alive and Ivy in Soul Calibur, not to mention voicing Chun Li in the Street Fighter Zero movie and Kazama Jun in the Tekken film.\n\nMy favourite Yumi role: Emma – meganekko meido ftw!\n\n81. Fujiwara Keiji (藤原 啓治)\n\nWhy you should know him: That funky bloke with a distinct, gruff voice who’s always wearing shades. Pretty good voice actor too, even though he seems to be destined to be the best man and never the bridegroom.\n\nBest known roles: Nohara Hiroshi in Crayon Shin-chan, Eledore Massis in Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team, Holland Novak in Eureka 7, Ali Al-Saachez in Mobile Suit Gundam 00, Kimura Tatsuya in Hajime no IppoWhat else you should know: Left KenPro in 2006 to start his own agency AIR AGENCY. Also lectures part-time at Nihon Geijutsu Gakuen.\n\nMy favourite FujiKei role: Ummm let’s see, he’s got so many roles!! I’ll go for Honey & Clover’s Hanamoto Shuuji, the all-wise, all-knowing mentor to Takemoto & co.\n\nI should put a disclaimer here – I stole all the images from somewhere but honest to God, when you have 4-5 500mb folders marked ‘Seiyuu Pix1′ it’s impossible to attribute them to their sources correctly.
