        "text": "In a foreword to the Signet paperback version of \"Maidstone,\" which is actually a transcription of the screenplay as improvised by the actors, Norman Mailer sounds very much as if he's become a prisoner of the sort of fantasies that keep alive the hopes of all conventional, money-grubbing movie producers.He reports that audiences for the film, which is his third, said either \"Sensational\" or \"It stinks.\" Every showman, no matter what the height of his brow, fears general apathy more than critical assassination.The truth of the matter is that \"Maidstone\" is a very mixed bag, and were it not the work of one of our most brilliant writers, and had it not prompted Mailer to write an intense essay (\"A Course in Film-making\"), it would be very easy to be apathetic about it.Judged simply as a movie, \"Maidstone\" marks an abrupt decline from \"Beyond the Law,\" Mailer's highly entertaining second film, as well as from \"Ocean's II,\" \"Sergeants Three\" and all those that Frank Sinatra made with his rat pack in the early 1960's.However, seen as part of the Mailer continuum, \"Maidstone\" is a sometimes hilarious, often boring but always adventurous ego trip, a very expensive, 110-minute home movie that has been edited, rather fancily, out of something like 45 hours of original footage. That, in turn, prompts the thought that almost anybody should be able to get 110 minutes of something out of 45 hours of anything, even if it's simply the filmed record of a chic, chaotic, seven-day brawl in East Hampton, which is the raw, not-so-base material of \"Maidstone.\"Mailer conceived the film as a giant, multileveled improvisation, involving 100 or so friends and professionals, which would try to capture a new kind of cinematic truth and purity by letting his actors go where they would once the original premise had been presented to them. The premise, in fact, is just nutty enough to be brilliant:Norman T. Kingsley (Mailer), a notorious film director (modestly compared to Bufiuel, Fellini, Dreyer and Antonioni) who is making a spoof of \"Belle de Jour\" on eastern Long Island, is being considered as a Presidential candidate. In the course of his production, he is visited by various delegations, interviewed by television, profiled by associates and the object of an assassination attempt that may or may not be the work of his brother, played by Rip Torn, who has been given the name of Raoul, apparently to add still another association between Norman T. Kingsley and various authority figures.That's the way the movie began, but, sadly, Mailer's huge cast didn't seem to improvise as well on-camera as they reportedly did off. The whole thing was becoming a disaster of the order of a rained-out Boy Scout picnic until, on the last day of shooting, Rip Torn improvised an attack on Mailer-Kingsley with a toy hammer that turned into a real fight. As the two men fought (Mailer's choppers neatly clamped on Torn's ear, drawing blood), Beverly Bentley (Mrs. Mailer) and the Mailer children screamed hysterically, and the cameras continued to roll.The result is a very mysterious scene that is more than just a close-up of the author-at-play. At one moment Mailer is shouting about trust betrayed, which is one of his most seductive themes, and in the next he is saying that he'll never forgive Torn for having, in effect, made a fool of him in front of his children. It's complex and dense and very much in keeping with what a major author is required to give his public in this era of Total Revelation.Nothing else in \"Maidstone\" is as interesting, not the satire of the news media, not the soft-core sex scenes, not Mailer's put-downs of actresses auditioning for Norman T. Kingsley (\"You may be extraordinarily talented, for all I know, but I think you're a dumbo\"), not even Mailer's flights of fancy about politics, Presidents, blacks and whatnots.The movie, which is pretty to look at, doesn't make a great deal of sense, just because Mailer, during production, refused to exercise the discipline that he more or less ridicules in his search for higher truth. \"Beyond the Law,\" made on the same principle, worked quite happily, but the scope was smaller and its confrontations (between cops and crooks) were clearly defined from the beginning.The screenplay for \"Maidstone\" is worth reading, however, not only because Mailer can be an incomparable word man, but also because his stage directions amount to criticisms of everything the film doesn't succeed in doing, as when Mailer tells us or, rather, he orders us: \"The mind of the audience must now work to establish some separate levels of reality. But the levels seem to insist on coalescing with one another . . .\" Truer words were never written after a fact.Only because \"Maidstone\" is Mailer, I wouldn't have missed it. The film opened yesterday at the Whitney Museum to start the new fall series devoted to American moviemakers. It will be shown for the next two weeks, every day except Thursday, at 12, 2 and 4 P.M., and Tuesday and Wednesday evenings at 6 and 8.\n\nMAIDSTONE, directed by Norman Mailer; photographed by Jim Desmond, Richard Leacock, D. A. Pennebaker, Nick Proferes, Sheldon and Diane Rochlin and Jan Pieter Welt; edited by Mr. Welt, Lana Jokel and Mr. Mailer; produced by Buzz Farbar and Mr. Mailer for Supreme Mix, Inc.
