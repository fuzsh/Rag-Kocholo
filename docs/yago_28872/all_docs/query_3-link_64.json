        "text": "(2 of 3)\n\nPublic Ego. He is not always so successful. At another point in the film, Mailer announces to the cast that the \"one single thing\" he is attempting to show is \"the incredible contradictory qualities\" that a presidential candidate must have. Unfortunately they seem not so much contradictory as comic. Mailer's improvisational style of shooting also makes for some passages of irredeemable confusion. But the film is brilliantly edited (by Jan Pieter Welt, Lana Jokel and Mailer) in a relentlessly hypnotic rhythm that sustains interest even through the most opaque episodes.\n\nMailer, of course, has a prodigious public ego, and Maidstone is partly an exercise in self-glorification. Weirdly, this is also part of its attraction. Mailer risks everything, frequently looking foolish in the process, and he fails more often than he succeeds. Yet it is his gleeful willingness to run risks, take absurd chances, that is appealing. Maidstone looks rough, sounds rough, and many people are likely to be put off (as perhaps the director intended) by Mailer's indulgence. But as another vision of An American Dream (his 1965 novel), as a feverish compendium of fantasies of power and paranoia, Maidstone is an astonishing adventure.\n\nMovies, for Norman Mailer, are a risk. Not very different from boxing, or writing, for that matter, and it is the element of tangible risk that has always drawn him. \"Writing is a very spooky activity,\" Mailer says, \"and when you get to film making, you realize the spookiness is tripled.\" Typically it is the spookiest movie style of allimprovisation in which Mailer chooses to work.\n\n\"Maidstone is structured, not scripted,\" he explains. He invited further chaos by enlisting a cast that consisted, apart from a few professional actors (Rip Torn, Harris Yulin), mostly of drinking buddies, hangers-on, three of his four ex-wives and some of his offspring. In a caper that has become legendary. Mailer called them all together in the early summer of 1968 at an opulent estate on eastern Long Island, originally called Maidstone by the early settlers. Spontaneity was crucial. Mailer even instructed some of his actors to go off on their own and surprise hima technique that culminated in Tom's wrathful hammer. Mailer's five camera crews eventually shot some 45 hours of film. The director quickly discarded two-thirds of the footage, then settled down to pare the remaining 15 hours into something approaching manageable length.\n\n\"I loved editing Maidstone,\" Mailer commented. \"At the cutting stage you are really writing, only with film instead of words. You put scenes next to each other, just as an author works to put one sentence next to another, but you are working with a language not learned in school.\" The result in the case of Maidstone is, for its author, \"a revolutionary film.\" Mailer hopes grandiosely that its effects on film making will be roughly equivalent to the effect that Cubism had on postImpressionism."
