        "text": "As Mailer had come to recognize over the years, the modest everyday fellow of his daily round was servant to a wild man in himself.… He would have been admirable, except that he was an absolute egomaniac, a Beast—no recognition existed of the existence of anything beyond the range of his reach. —Norman Mailer describing himself in The Armies of the Night.\n\nIf you enter the search terms “Norman Mailer” and “hammer” on YouTube, you will be directed to a clip titled “Norman Mailer vs Rip Torn—on camera brawl.” Click on the link and an amazing series of frames rolls across the computer screen: Torn, the accomplished and respected actor, bonks Mailer, the novelist and trailblazing New Journalist, over the head with a hammer, drawing blood. The two men tussle on the grass, grunting and cursing. Then Mailer bites Torn’s ear half off in retaliation.\n\nFour of Mailer’s children (three of them under the age of 10) can be heard screaming and crying in terror as Mailer’s fourth wife, Beverly Bentley, bursts into the frame, shouting obscenities at Torn and smacking him repeatedly in the head.\n\nIt’s the horrifying climax of Maidstone, Mailer’s third experimental film, which was released in 1971. He called it “a guerrilla raid on the nature of reality.”\n\nThe film is well worth seeing, since it springs from the imagination of a singular artist whose failures were as big as his successes. Mailer, who died on November 10, 2007, is best known for his writings—the expansively macho attempts at the Great American Novel, the enormously influential fusion of fictional devices and nonfiction reporting that was a precursor to New Journalism. But he never limited his performances to the page. A publisher, politician, and combative regular on the talk-show circuit, he was also a filmmaker of grand—some would say grandiose—ambitions.\n\nIn 1968, the same year he published The Armies of the Night, for which he won his first Pulitzer Prize, Mailer released two experimental films and shot a third. In Maidstone, which was filmed that summer, his self-indulgence and excessiveness are on display, as are his egomania, voyeurism, and misogyny. But Maidstone also reflects the dreams and obsessions that fed into his finest work of the 60s and 70s. It was, in the words of New York Times film critic A. O. Scott, “the wildest, most productive and most contentious period in a career that has never been especially calm or easy to comprehend.”\n\nMailer had loved movies from the time he was a little boy, growing up in a middle-class neighborhood in Brooklyn in the 1930s. He loved going to the double features on Saturday afternoon, especially if Jimmy Cagney and Humphrey Bogart were playing gangsters. His sister Barbara Wasserman says Norman began taking her to foreign films after he became an engineering student at Harvard, at the age of 16. “We saw stuff like [Jean Cocteau’s] The Blood of a Poet,” she recalls.\n\nBy the time he turned 18, Mailer had read John Dos Passos’s U.S.A. books, John Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath, and James Farrell’s Studs Lonigan trilogy and had decided that he wanted to be a major writer. Shortly after he graduated from Harvard, in 1943, he was drafted into the army, serving in the Philippines and Japan. That experience was the basis of his critically acclaimed first novel, The Naked and the Dead. He wrote parts of it in Provincetown, Massachusetts, where he would spend summers for the next 50 years.\n\nThe Naked and the Dead was published in May 1948 and topped the New York Times best-seller list for 11 straight weeks. The Associated Press named him “Man of the Year” in literature. He was 25 years old.\n\nAlthough he was hugely ambitious, he was completely unprepared for fame and fortune. Later he said, “Part of me thought [The Naked and the Dead] was possibly the greatest book written since War and Peace. On the other hand I also thought, ‘I don’t know anything about writing. I’m virtually an impostor.’ ”\n\nHe still had fantasies of becoming a filmmaker, and he used his first royalty check to buy a movie camera. In 1948 or ‘49, he used it to make a 10-minute silent film about a girl having an abortion.\n\nIn July 1948, Mailer went to Hollywood. He found the political climate there unsettling: it was the height of the Red scare, when actors and screenwriters who refused to name names of suspected Communists were being blacklisted. Mailer, already a committed left-winger, campaigned for the Progressive Party’s presidential candidate, Henry Wallace, and even stage-managed a rally for Wallace at the Pan Pacific Auditorium. Before the curtain went up, Mailer broke up an argument between Katharine Hepburn and MGM head Louis B. Mayer, who threatened to ruin Hepburn’s career if she spoke in support of Wallace. She gave her speech anyway.\n\nEverybody in Hollywood had read The Naked and the Dead, and everybody wanted to meet its author. Mailer played tennis (badly) with Charlie Chaplin and had dinner at Gene Kelly’s house with John Huston, Humphrey Bogart, and Shelley Winters.\n\nPeople who knew him then remember Mailer as outspoken and excitable, with wild curly hair and big ears. He didn’t care how he looked or how he dressed, and his socks hung over his shoes “until I pointed that out to him,” says his friend the tough-talking actor Mickey Knox. The two became close during that first trip to Los Angeles. Knox introduced Mailer to Montgomery Clift and Burt Lancaster.\n\nThe following year, Knox and Mailer reconnected in New York, and they ended up driving back to California together. It was a wild ride, full of storytelling and arguing. On this visit, Mailer was determined to get The Naked and the Dead made into a movie. In 1950, Lancaster, with his partner Harold Hecht, decided to option the book, but he soon dropped it. (“The time just wasn’t right for a novel about war and despair and the boredom of being a soldier,” says Knox.) Eventually, Charles Laughton picked it up. Mailer kept busy trying to write screenplays for Samuel Goldwyn’s studio. He and another friend, Jean Malaquais, worked on a script for Clift loosely based on Nathanael West’s Miss Lonelyhearts, but the project fell apart. (A film version of The Naked and the Dead came out in 1958, starring Cliff Robertson and directed by Raoul Walsh. Mailer thought it was terrible.)\n\nMickey Knox observed mood changes in Mailer after the publication of his second novel, Barbary Shore, in 1951. A surreal parable about Cold War politics set in a Brooklyn rooming house, the book was panned by most critics. So was his third novel, The Deer Park, a dark satire of Hollywood during the blacklist era. It came out in 1955, but not before six publishers turned it down. The failures really shook up Mailer, who became depressed and irritable. He wouldn’t write another novel for 10 years.\n\nInstead, he built himself an “orgone accumulator”—a big box in which, according to the controversial psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich, one could absorb energies that could cure neurosis or cancer. Mailer would go inside and scream his head off, but it didn’t seem to help. His first marriage, to Beatrice Silverman, had broken up in 1952. Now he was living with the Peruvian-Spanish painter Adele Morales, whom he married in 1954.\n\nHe wanted to write, but his fame seemed to be cutting him off from experience. He told Knox that he might become a psychiatrist, or go into business—anything to get some fresh material to write about.\n\nHe began smoking a great deal of marijuana and drinking heavily. He would continue to do both well into his 60s. Eventually he started keeping a journal, which would run to a couple hundred pages, noting down every idea, opinion, dream, and nightmare he experienced when he was stoned.\n\nFor a while he and Adele lived in a big, drafty loft near the East River, in Manhattan. Allen Ginsberg described it as “subterranean.” Montgomery Clift used to get drunk there with Mailer. Clift and Marlon Brando were both at the loft the night a group of toughs stopped in looking for a girl and accosted Mailer. In a bit of unwitting foreshadowing, they hit him over the head with a hammer, but neither of the actors did anything. They just sat there. Brando had a girl on his lap.\n\nSometime in 1958, Mickey Knox took Mailer to the Actors Studio. The place bowled him over; there was so much creative energy, so much high-voltage talent. Paul Newman, Marilyn Monroe, Steve McQueen, Anne Bancroft, and Geraldine Page would all be there, working on scenes for the great acting teacher Lee Strasberg while Elia Kazan, the Oscar-winning director of On the Waterfront, prowled the halls. Kazan had co-founded the Studio, and his mantra was one that everybody practiced: the actor turns psychology into behavior because behavior illuminates character. The Studio was a place where actors weren’t afraid to expose themselves, their traumas, their hang-ups.\n\nOnce, during a session, two actors went at it with knives until Strasberg stopped them from hurting each other. Another time, an actress doing a scene directed by Kazan had a “sense memory” of what it would be like if her hands were cut off. She let out a bloodcurdling scream and then passed out onstage.\n\nSoon Mailer turned The Deer Park into a play, and he arranged for Anne Bancroft and Kevin McCarthy to perform it in a series of readings at the Studio. Mailer was critical of Bancroft’s fiery, multi-level performance as the volatile Elena Esposito; the role had been inspired by Mailer’s exotic wife. “Get Adele to play it. That’s what you’ve wanted all along,” Bancroft said one day after a particularly bad fight. “You’ll never amount to anything,” Mailer told the actress—who would soon win a Tony and an Oscar for her portrayal of Helen Keller’s teacher in The Miracle Worker. The actor and director Andreas Voutsinas, who was Bancroft’s close friend, remembers that Mailer was coming on to the actress. But she was dating the comedian Lenny Bruce and wasn’t interested.\n\nWhen a Playwrights Unit was formed at the Studio by Elia Kazan’s wife, Molly, Mailer became one of its first members, together with William Inge and Tennessee Williams. That’s when I met him. I’d just become a member of the Studio and was acting on Broadway in a show called Mary, Mary, but I spent all my free time doing scenes for Strasberg or attending sessions with the Playwrights Unit.\n\nI remember Mailer’s piercing blue eyes, his staccato way of speaking. He always seemed about to explode. Once he asked James Earl Jones and me to read a skit he had written about Adam and Eve. He wanted us to act in it in the nude. We refused, and the skit was ultimately read by other actors. After it was over, those in the room offered scathing critiques. Mailer glowered, then jumped to his feet and bellowed, “If Patti and Jimmy had read it naked, it woulda worked!”\n\nAnother afternoon, I was there when an unknown playwright named Edward Albee had a reading of a play called The Zoo Story. Many people spoke out against it, but not Mailer, who informed the group that it was probably one of the most important plays of the decade. “It’s gonna be a classic and it’s gonna change theater,” he said.\n\nHe was right. He was amazingly prescient about so much. He never seemed able to stop talking, but it was such dazzling talk—about the rise of corporatization, and about how television was making everybody indifferent. He wrote dozens of counterculture essays during the late 50s. He wrote about sex and violence and drugs and racism in The Village Voice, the paper he’d co-founded in 1955. And he cultivated controversy with his essay “The White Negro,” published in Dissent, which seemed to suggest that murdering a defenseless candy-store owner could be seen as a courageous act.\n\nIn 1959 he came out with Advertisements for Myself, which I devoured. It was a wild collection of short stories and essays, bits of discarded novels, and fascinating personal ramblings that sought to justify his failures and his obsessions, especially with violence. Mailer believed that the best lies close to the worst in people, that good intentions invariably produce ironic outcomes.\n\nAt the Studio he was swaggering a lot. He spoke in either an Irish accent or a Texas drawl. I was beginning to realize that his keen awareness of everything was making life unbearable and lonely, so he frequently acted the clown. He began to write about boxing, and I heard that he’d been butting heads with people and even provoking fights on the street.\n\nThen, at a drunken party in November 1960, he stabbed Adele with a penknife, barely missing her heart. Mailer seemed to be testing the limits of evil in himself. Stabbing the woman he loved was as far as he could go.\n\nAdele recovered and decided not to press charges. Meanwhile, Norman was held under psychiatric observation at Bellevue Hospital for 17 days. After his release, a subdued and much quieter Mailer dropped by the Studio. Nobody mentioned the stabbing, and he rarely spoke about it. Appearing on the PBS series American Masters, in 2000, he admitted, “It changed everything in my life. It is the one act I can look back on and regret for the rest of my life. And it happened out of the way I was living.”\n\nWe all thought his career would be ruined, but instead the tragedy only enhanced his notoriety. Mailer’s friend Rhoda Lazare Wolf told the biographer Peter Manso that she wasn’t surprised at the public’s reaction. She called it part of “the psychopathology of the time.” People were fed up with safe, clean celebrities. They wanted a wild man, an outsider, someone who was reckless. Someone without a conscience.\n\nThe 1960s proved to be a hugely productive decade for Mailer. He became a reporter, covering the political conventions in Miami and Chicago and speaking out on a variety of causes. He even ran for mayor of New York City in a crazy, antic campaign.\n\nHe also divorced Adele, with whom he had two daughters, and, in 1962, married Lady Jeanne Campbell, the elegant daughter of the 11th Duke of Argyll. They had a daughter, Kate, and were divorced the following year. Mailer then married the actress Beverly Bentley, who was blonde, talented, and able to hold her own with Norman—at least for a while. Their tempestuous marriage produced two sons. In 1964 he wrote what would become one of his favorite novels, An American Dream, in installments for Esquire. It is described on the book jacket as “one part Nietzsche, one part de Sade, and one part Charlie Parker.” Then, in 1967, he wrote an allegorical novel called Why Are We in Vietnam?, about a hunting trip in Alaska. The word “Vietnam” doesn’t even appear until the last page.\n\nFrom time to time he’d join the improvisation group at the Loft Theatre, in the West Village. This group of brainy, stage-hungry kids acted out spontaneous scenes populated by neurotic mothers, star-crossed lovers, double-talking politicians. Dustin Hoffman played parts there, and Andre Gregory began developing his avant-garde version of Alice in Wonderland on the Loft stage.\n\nThe producer of the group was the writer and actress Janet Coleman. She says Mailer used to arrive dressed like a gangster, in a trench coat with a hat pulled over one eye. “He loved to improvise,” she remembers. “Unfortunately, he didn’t come to enough classes to master the exercises that help you concentrate and relax in a stage space. He didn’t really know how to create a character. He couldn’t cooperate or share space with other actors very easily.”\n\nThe Loft’s work made an impression on him all the same. “Improvisation also orders chaos—gives its focus to random emotions,” he wrote in his 1971 essay “A Course in Filmmaking.” Improvisation “becomes a life which is not quite life.”\n\nEvery so often he would invite some of us from the Studio to watch underground films with him at the Charles Theatre, on the Lower East Side. We saw Kenneth Anger’s Scorpio Rising, Jack Smith’s Flaming Creatures, and Andy Warhol’s Kitchen, which, Mailer declared, “had the horror of the twentieth century in it.”\n\nHe was fascinated by these new movies. He now realized that film, like sex, “is an experience you can never dominate.” He was inspired by the idea that movies could be so mysterious, elusive, and unpredictable.\n\nIn January 1967 he finally got his stage adaptation of The Deer Park produced Off Broadway, at the Theatre de Lys. He’d been writing and re-writing the play for 10 years, and he would continue until his death.\n\nMailer was ruthlessly critical of everybody in the cast, which included Rip Torn, Mickey Knox, and Beverly Bentley. He couldn’t figure out what actors do.\n\nThe reviews were mixed, with one critic calling The Deer Park “an uneasy gift from the mind of an uneasy man.” Still, the play ran for 127 performances, and Torn won an Obie for his portrayal of Marion Faye, a leering, leather-clad pimp. By then Torn and Mailer had become close friends, and they would go on to collaborate often, including on a stage version of Why Are We in Vietnam? A charismatic, outspoken radical who was deeply involved in protesting the war, Torn says he was one of the few people who felt comfortable speaking freely to Mailer. Most people were afraid of him.\n\nAfter each performance, everybody would end up at Casey’s bar, in the Village. Mailer, Mickey Knox, and their friend Buzz Farbar, who had a role in the play, “would go off to the side of this bar. And we began playing this game,” Mailer told the writer Joseph Gelmis. “We began improvising, to take on parts. I was like the head of a gang, very Mafia. These guys were like my hoods, and I was lecturing them all the time.”\n\nThe three men thought these exchanges, which were loaded with obscenities and tough talk, were hilariously funny. “We had absolutely fantastic stuff,” Mailer went on. “I said, ‘Jesus, isn’t it a shame that we can’t film it? Instead of being ourselves, let’s see what we’re like as movie actors.’ ”\n\nEventually, Mailer persuaded the esteemed documentarian D. A. Pennebaker to work with him. Pennebaker had just finished his groundbreaking Bob Dylan tour film, Don’t Look Back, and Mailer saw him as “not only a marvelously gifted photographer but … an innovator and a discoverer.”\n\nMailer called his first film Wild 90. Shot over a period of four nights in a vacant, grungy loft on West 45th Street, the picture follows three “low-level thugs trapped in a room planning their next big heist,” as film historian Michael Chaiken recently described it in Film Comment. At one point, Mickey Knox later wrote, Mailer’s friend Jose Torres, the former light-heavyweight champion of the world, “brought a growling German shepherd. Norman bent down and matched it growl for growl.”\n\nMailer and an editor spent close to six months cutting Wild 90. As soon as he was through, he started writing The Armies of the Night, about participating in the march on the Pentagon. As Chaiken points out, Mailer got the idea to write about himself in the third person after watching himself on-screen. The innovation, used throughout The Armies of the Night, helped inspire a new form of participatory journalism.\n\nWild 90 opened in early 1968 and was summarily dismissed by most critics. For one thing, the sound was so bad that no one could understand it. New York Times critic Renata Adler wrote, “What the conversation turns into almost at once is a subsurface contest for the attention of the camera.”\n\nMailer’s second film, Beyond the Law, had already been shot by the time Wild 90 opened. Speaking in an exaggerated Irish accent, Mailer plays a police lieutenant on the brink of divorce with his wife (Bentley). He spends his evening playing God to an array of sleazy suspects—and revealing his own demonic nature.\n\nBeyond the Law premiered at the New York Film Festival in the fall of 1968. Mailer’s idea was to use the techniques of cinéma vérité “to photograph feature-length movies which told imaginary stories.”\n\nBut Beyond the Law was no more successful than Wild 90. Audience members booed at the opening, and many critics panned the film. Vincent Canby of The New York Times, however, wrote, “ ‘Beyond the Law’ is so good and tough and entertaining so much of the time that you simply have to forgive those moments when the actors suddenly smirk self-consciously—like the Gas House Gang caught in an amateur theatrical.”\n\nMaidstone was Mailer’s third movie. It was filmed on Gardiners Island and at the East Hampton estates of Barney Rosset, who was the publisher of Grove Press, and the wealthy artist and art patron Alfonso Ossorio.\n\nIt was the summer of 1968, a little more than one month after the assassination of Robert Kennedy. Mailer later wrote that he never would have made Maidstone if he “had not sat in a room with Bobby Kennedy a month before his death and failed to realize danger; that the man was in mortal danger.” Mailer sold part of his interest in The Village Voice to cover the production costs, which amounted to more than $200,000, but he didn’t care. As far as he was concerned, this was the film that would finally erase the boundaries between fiction and truth, “the surface of reality and the less visible surface of psychological reality.”\n\nThere was no script, just a bizarre scenario concocted by Mailer himself. He would direct and star as Norman Kingsley, an avant-garde director who is casting a film inspired by Luis Buñuel’s Belle de Jour. In that critically acclaimed film, released in 1967, Catherine Deneuve played a demure wife who moonlights as a prostitute. In Kingsley’s version, women go to a male brothel. Kingsley is also debating whether to run for president. He’s scared, sensing the threat of more assassinations. As it turns out, his murder is being contemplated—by a secret-police force and even his own followers.\n\nTwo of Mailer’s four wives to date—Beverly Bentley and Lady Jeanne Campbell—appeared in the film. So did his mistress, Carol Stevens, who can be heard warbling on the soundtrack. The cast also included Jose Torres and Buzz Farbar, the conservative commentator Noel Parmentel, the poet Michael McClure, the art patron John de Menil, and assorted wealthy socialites, militant black activists, and vacuous aspiring starlets. The actor Hervé Villechaize, best known for his role as Tattoo on TV’s Fantasy Island, reportedly got so drunk that he almost drowned in Barney Rosset’s swimming pool.\n\nIn addition to starring in the film as Norman Kingsley’s half-brother, Rey, Rip Torn had the job of associate director. “I’d turned down Easy Rider to do this movie,” he recalls. For the final fight scene, Torn says, Mailer told him to “let the conflict build and then take me out.” Torn was surprised. He said, “Really take you out? Aren’t we going to do some more films together?” Mailer told him, “Just make it look real.”\n\nThe shoot took one week, during which most of the cast milled about aimlessly, getting drunk or stoned. A manic, bare-chested Mailer circulated among them, sparring on the grass, debating politics with the black activists, alternately flirting with and insulting the would-be starlets. He appeared to be trying to force confrontation, to create the atmosphere of dread and apprehension that he envisioned. Fueled by an angry, desperate energy, he grew increasingly exasperated. He knew the story, but the rest of the cast didn’t.\n\nTorn was frustrated, too. Nothing was coming together. At one point Lane Smith, one of the professional actors, told Mailer to “take your crew, your equipment, your camera and shove it up your ass!” Mailer responded by punching Smith and breaking his jaw.\n\nThe night before shooting ended, Torn met with Mailer and the other associate directors about how to do the final scene. Mailer and the others thought “they should do Mailer’s character in with stoning,” Torn says, but he “argued that you can’t control a stoning, that Norman could get killed.” Torn then came up with the idea of using a hammer.\n\nThe next morning dawned sunny and beautiful. At the start of the clip on YouTube, we see Torn and Mailer facing off on a sloping green hill on Gardiners Island.\n\nFrom the screenplay, which was put together after the film was edited:\n\nWe see rip-rey stride toward him, raise the hammer, strike him on the head, raise the hammer again. A second blow! …\n\nnorman: (Hand to his head—dodging back) You crazy fool cocksucker!\n\nrip-rey: (Holding the hammer, moving forward) You’re supposed to die, Mr. Kingsley. You must die, not Mailer. I don’t want to kill Mailer, but I must kill Kingsley in this picture.\n\nnorman: (Still backing up) Let go of the hammer. Let go of the hammer.…\n\nHe rushes in to grapple with rip-rey who drops the hammer just before norman gets a full bite of his ear. They go hurtling down the slope and through the air to land with rip-rey on top.\n\nFor the next couple of minutes they roll around slowly on the grass. Torn attempts to placate Mailer—“I’m sorry, Dad. I’m so sorry”—but it’s no use. Apart from the physical pain, Mailer can’t seem to stand the idea that someone else has taken control of his movie. Blood drips from the side of his head. They stop grappling for a minute, then begin again. Torn maneuvers into the upper position and puts his hands on Mailer’s throat. Bentley soon arrives on the scene, shrieking and shouting curses. The children are wailing in terror. Two men run into the frame and eventually separate the antagonists.\n\nThe scene ends with Mailer saying, “You might as well turn off this tape.” But Torn had already got his punch in: “You’re just a fraud, aren’t you?” he said to Mailer. The two friends didn’t speak for many months, although Mailer phoned Torn in the hospital. His ear had become terribly infected. A few months later, I interviewed Torn’s wife, Geraldine Page, for a story I was writing. She insisted that Torn had used a toy hammer.\n\nThis December, however, Torn, who remained close to Mailer until his death, told me in a quiet voice that it had been a real hammer. He had been careful to use the blunt end of the handle, he said, to minimize the damage: “Norman knew all along what I was going to do.”\n\nD. A. Pennebaker says the attack came as a surprise to him. “I had my camera full of film, but I didn’t know exactly what was going to happen,” he recalls. “I hadn’t been told. Rip thinks he told me, but he didn’t.”\n\nWhen he entered the editing room, Mailer was determined to leave the fight scene on the cutting-room floor. Then he watched all 45 hours of footage and realized that the scene was the only thing that could save his movie. Without it, he admitted, he would have “been left with the most embarrassing work of all, an ego trip.”\n\nHe also realized that the scene accomplished the goal he’d set for the whole film: to be “both a fiction and a documentary at once” and to penetrate “the hard hide of the real.”\n\nThe fight may have succeeded on an artistic level, but it had very real repercussions for the rest of the Mailer family. Friends say it hastened the ending of Mailer’s already shaky marriage to Beverly Bentley. And their sons, Michael and Stephen—both of whom now work in film, as a producer and an actor, respectively—acknowledge that the experience was traumatizing. Stephen, who was two at the time, says Mailer apologized shortly before he died. He had never wanted his children to be hurt.\n\nMailer took two years to edit Maidstone. It opened in 1971 at the Whitney Museum of American Art and played to packed houses. Its commercial release, however, was a bust. By then Mailer was broke, and he began paying off his debts by writing one big book after another: The Prisoner of Sex, Marilyn, Portrait of Picasso as a Young Man. In 1980, he won a second Pulitzer Prize, for The Executioner’s Song, which portrayed the convicted murderer Gary Gilmore as an existential hero.\n\nThat November, Mailer divorced Bentley and married Carol Stevens, to legitimize their daughter. Then he divorced her and married his sixth wife, a gifted 31-year-old painter named Norris Church. They spent their honeymoon in London, where they both acted in Milos Forman’s film Ragtime. Mailer continued to be obsessed with movies. He and Norris, a ravishing redhead, co-wrote a number of unproduced screenplays, and in 1986 he directed an adaptation of his novel Tough Guys Don’t Dance, starring Ryan O’Neal as a hard-drinking, skirt-chasing writer. Mailer also continued to act. For one day, he worked with Jean-Luc Godard on King Lear. Mailer was cast as the Lear character, and his daughter Kate was set to play Cordelia, but he backed out, allegedly after Godard implied that their characters had incestuous feelings for each other.\n\nAround that time, I saw Mailer and Kate collaborate on a play he had written called Strawhead, about Marilyn Monroe. A workshop was done at the Actors Studio, and Kate, wearing a tousled blond wig, was sensational as Monroe—sexy, vulnerable, funny. One night, during a kinky love scene between Marilyn and a biker, Shelley Winters jumped to her feet from the audience and yelled, “I was Marilyn’s roommate and that didn’t happen, Norman!” The audience roared, and so did Mailer. The following night he had his ex-wife Adele call out the same protest from the audience.\n\nIn 1993, Mailer directed and acted in a rollicking staged reading of George Bernard Shaw’s Don Juan in Hell, starring Gay Talese as Don Juan, Gore Vidal as the Devil, and Susan Sontag as Doña Ana. It played at Carnegie Hall as a benefit for the Actors Studio.\n\nIn the early 90s, Mailer made Provincetown his home base and plunged into writing four enormous books: Harlot’s Ghost, about the C.I.A.; Oswald’s Tale, about Lee Harvey Oswald; The Gospel According to the Son, in which Jesus tells his own story; and The Castle in the Forest, a biography of Adolf Hitler narrated by a minion of Satan.\n\nBut every so often he would take a breather and act. He performed Eugene O’Neill’s Long Day’s Journey into Night in Provincetown with Norris, his daughter Kate, and two of his sons, Stephen and John Buffalo. “It was like a catharsis for me,” Stephen says. “Got a lot of stuff worked out in my head.”\n\nIn 2002, Mailer played Hemingway in a wonderful piece that George Plimpton and Terry Quinn had fashioned using F. Scott Fitzgerald’s notes and letters. Plimpton played Fitzgerald, and Norris played Zelda. The three of them took the show to Moscow, Paris, and London. “Norman loved playing Hemingway,” Norris recalls.\n\nIn the last years of his life, Mailer gave John Buffalo, his son with Norris, the rights to turn The Naked and the Dead into a screenplay. “I felt privileged to be able to work on it, and it was easy,” John Buffalo says. “All I did was follow the book’s narrative outline. Nobody else did when they tried to make it into a movie! My dad loved it.” John Buffalo’s version of The Naked and the Dead has a real chance of being made, and he says Alec Baldwin may do a reading of it.\n\nIn the spring of 2007, at the age of 84, Mailer decided that he was ready to direct again. After 52 years, the time had finally come to bring The Deer Park to the screen. I talked to him about it in New York after a staged reading of the play, directed by Stephan Morrow. “Finally somebody understood the language and what I was trying to say,” Mailer said. His plan was to shoot the play on a stage in Provincetown.\n\nWe spoke about the project again at the Paris Review tribute to him, on April 23. He was frail, on two canes, but his blue eyes sparkled. Why, after all these years, are you still obsessed with this one book?, I asked.\n\n“Because it’s about the trouble men and women always have, dealing with each other,” he replied. “It’s a mystery. I still can’t figure it out.”\n\nPatricia Bosworth is a Vanity Fair contributing editor."
