Sam Mendes

The 51-year-old film director - who led the James Bond films 'Spectre' and 'Skyfall' to success at the box office - tied the knot with his classical musician partner Alison Balsom over the weekend in the quaint village of Great Tew in Oxfordshire.

Reverend Ginny Thomas - who conducted the church service at St Michael & All Angels on Saturday (21.01.17) - told the MailOnline: "The couple had a blessing. The wedding had been held previously at a register office. That's all I can say."

The news that Sam is now a married man will no doubt come as a huge shock to some as the majority of his friends didn't even know he was engaged to the 38-year-old star.

But this isn't the first time Sam has got hitched as he was previously wed to Kate Winslet, with whom he has 13-year-old son Joe, for seven years until their split in 2010.

Alison, on the other hand, was in a long-term relationship with music conductor Edward Gardner, with whom she has six-year-old son Charlie, until they separated in 2011.

It's not known when Sam and Alison got together but romance rumours started to swirl last October when it was reported they were moving into a seaside home in Dorset.

An onlooker said at the time: "It's the talk of the village. They have moved here because Alison loves sailing and is keen to teach Sam."

They then confirmed their relationship in November when Sam accompanied Alison to Buckingham Palace in London where she picked up her OBE from Prince Charles.

Sam is no stranger to dating successful women as he previously romanced Hollywood actress Rebecca Hall in 2015 and has enjoyed a string of dates with Rachel Weisz.
