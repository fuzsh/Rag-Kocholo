        "text": "It was in the spring of 2015 and Brandon Hill had a conviction in his heart that this year for his birthday, he needed do something that would add to his life rather than take from it. So he decided to go to church. He went online and looked up churches that were in the neighborhood he lived at, in Washington, D.C. and found a church not too far from him. Brandon decided to attend a service and was extremely blessed by the experience. On his 3rd time attending he gives his life to Christ, joins the church and was baptized in the Holy Spirit. This began a new life and journey for him. On the day he joins the church, Stephanie, who had been a member at this church since she was 12 years old was in the back serving on the Graphics Department, when she notices that Brandon had joined the Church. She rejoiced to see that they had a new brother come to Christ and went back to serving. About a month later Stephanie sees Brandon in the foyer looking stand-offish and isolated. She hears from the Holy Spirit to go over and introduce herself to him, but she didn't want to. She thought that he would have thought she was crazy or weird. But out of obedience she reluctantly walks over with her friend and they introduce themselves to Brandon. If you let Stephanie tell the story, she will say that Brandon acted like he didn't want to be bothered. If you let Brandon tell the story he would say he was glad to meet them as he waited for a ride. Either way, after that introduction Stephanie walked away thinking that was weird and Brandon walked away thinking it was cool to start to meet others his age.\n\nA few months passed since the first time Stephanie and Brandon had connected. On Labor Day weekend, the Church was having a Friends and Family Day Event. A few days before the event, Stephanie, who was a part of the Dance Ministry, was sitting in her car waiting for rehearsal in preparation for Sunday's event. As she waited, she was led to listen to a message about relationships in which God used to locate something in her own heart about how she was holding on to the desire to be married. She didn't realize it was an idol in her heart. With great conviction and tears, Stephanie decided to write a letter to God letting go of how she was holding on to her desire to be married and declared that even if she was single with God for the rest of her life, she would be okay with that as long as it was the will of God for her life. Little did she know that her willingness to surrender this area of her life would open the door to what the Lord had planned next.\n\nSunday comes and Its Family & Friends Day. After service there was fun, food and fellowship in the parking lot of the church. After a bad ending to a spades game Brandon and Stephanie connected, talking and walking around the parking lot. Brandon being a new believer had tons of questions about the church and being in Christ and Stephanie (with the Holy Spirit) had the answers. After the event, Stephanie's friends invited Brandon to hang out and grab some dinner at Busboys and Poets. This allowed for both Stephanie and Brandon the opportunity to connect even more. After the dinner and hanging out Stephanie and her friends dropped Brandon off at home in which Brandon thanked them and told them all to let him know when they got home. Stephanie was the only one to let Brandon know that she got home. This lead to a text conversation that never ended. Brandon and Stephanie would text about hearing the voice of God, about messages they were listening to, about revelations they would get from God and about their own walk in Christ. They would ride together to conferences and talk for hours after the conference about what God was teaching and showing them. This went on for months. God was purely drawing these two together and yet they had no idea. Clueless.\n\nDuring this time of connecting through conversation and rides from church events, one of Stephanie's friends was desiring to get her health in order. At this time, Brandon was a personal trainer and Stephanie connected her friend with him. This began another layer of the journey where Brandon would train her friend and Stephanie would be invited to join the sessions. Stephanie was not interested in training, but out of support of her friend, she went to each session. The training sessions turned into divine encounters that drew Brandon and Stephanie closer as friends. Eventually things got weird, but in a good way. They would text each other and know that the other was about to text. They would know or do things similarly like listen and share the same messages without knowing that the other was just doing the same thing. Stephanie began to share this insight with her friend one day around the Thanksgiving Season. Her friend asked her, \"Did you ask the Lord, what was going on between you too?\". Stephanie kindly replied, \"No\" and said that \"She didn't want to\". It was because she was afraid of what she would hear. In this moment, Stephanie heard the Lord clearly say, \"So, you're not going to ask me?\". Immediately, she felt convicted. At the time Stephanie and her friend were in the gym's dance studio. Her friend left her alone to ask a question to the Lord that would change everything. In the midst of dancing. Stephanie asked the Lord one of the toughest questions, \"Who is Brandon to me?\". As Stephanie asked the question, she began to dance and twirl and immediately heard \"Your Husband\". The answer startled her and stopped her dancing to the point she ask the Lord to repeat what he said. The Lord answered again, and said \"He's your husband\". In a very calm yet perplexed state, Stephanie accepted what the Lord said and told him that, \"If this is so, I can't share this with him\".\n\nDuring this same time Brandon was in New York enjoying the thanksgiving weekend with his family. He had planned to stay the whole weekend till Monday afternoon but God had other plans. That Sunday Brandon had a strong conviction to get back to DC and have a training session with the friend that was with Stephanie. So he bought his ticket back to DC and had that training session that evening in which Stephanie had attended. Towards the end of the session the presence of God entered the room and their friend began to prophesy to Brandon from the Lord saying that He has given Brandon the desires of his heart and that it is now time for him to be bold and receive it. Then she prophesies, from the Lord, to Stephanie who was sitting right next Brandon saying that she was his precious flower in which he has been cultivating since she was young and has adorned her with beauty. Both Brandon and Stephanie were grateful for the Lord's encouragement and received these words in their hearts. The session then came to an end and Brandon brought his equipment upstairs and came back down to walk the ladies out to their cars which was his custom. Their friend gets in her car and drives off. Brandon and Stephanie talk for a little longer outside where Brandon says to Stephanie, \"I wonder what the Lord wants me to be bold about.\" She replies, \"I don't know, ask the Lord and find out.\" After this conversation they part ways and go home.\n\nThat evening when Brandon made it upstairs to his room, he immediately got on his knees to pray. Brandon already knew in his heart what the Lord was talking about in the prophecy he had just received. Therefore he went straight in and asked the Lord, \"Is Stephanie my wife?\" He heard from the Lord, \"Yes.\" He asked again two more times and received the same answer both times. Perplexed by what he heard, Brandon decided he would sleep on it and ask again in the morning. The morning came and Brandon, in prayer, asked the Lord again three more times, \"Is Stephanie my wife?\" Each time he heard the Lord say, \"Yes,\" but on the third time he heard the Lord say, \"Yes, and you must tell her.\" This made Brandon very nervous and he felt the weight knowing and knew he now had a responsibility with it that required his obedience.\n\nAs the day began, Brandon and Stephanie texted each other as they normally did. Brandon knew that he couldn't share what he heard from God through text and he knew something this big couldn't be shared over a phone call either. He knew this had to be shared in person but he had a long day ahead of him training clients and Stephanie had to work. They both went throughout their day as they normally would. It reached the end of the day and Brandon was done training his clients and was on the train heading home. Him and Stephanie were engaged in a text conversation. As the train got closer to his stop Brandon knew he had to share what he heard from God with Stephanie so he asked her through text if she could meet him at her stop on the train. For some strange reason Stephanie all of a sudden took a very long time to reply to this message. With no reply Brandon gets off at his stop and waited for her reply at the station because he didn't want to go up there and she not be able to meet him. With the last train for the night approaching the station, there was still no reply from Stephanie so Brandon quickly decided to get on the last train and squeezed in right as the doors were closing. As Brandon sat down, Stephanie replied and said that he can come up and that she can meet him. On Stephanie's end, when Brandon had texted her to ask if she can meet him at her stop, her phone had blacked out. Being new to team iPhone, Steph didn't know what to do. The Holy Spirit then told her to press and hold the top button and the home button. She did as she was instructed and her phone turned off. Then the Holy Spirit told her to hold the same buttons and she did and her phone came back on again. Finally when the phone came back on she read Brandon's text and replied.\n\nAs Brandon made his way up to Stephanie's train stop, he was extremely nervous. He had no idea how to tell her what he heard from God and if she would receive it. What he was about to do was a huge step of faith that he was committing to. When he got to Stephanie's stop he texted her saying he had arrived. As he waited for Steph's reply he paced the platform praying in tongues still nervous about what was about to happen. After about 5 minutes Stephanie replied back telling Brandon she was outside the station. Brandon gets in the car and starts talking around what needs to be said beating around the bush as Steph was driving. Brandon can feel Steph saying internally, \"get to the point.\" Then Brandon goes for it in the most non-romantic way and says nervously, \"God told me that you're the one.\" Everything gets quiet and there's just this long silence. Then Stephanie shares with Brandon that that was confirmation because God had already told her a few days prior. Brandon was sooooo relieved to hear this and also rejoiced. Stephanie and Brandon then park in front of Brandon's apartment and talk about how God revealed it to each of them and talked about what this means for them going forward. With both of them not knowing what to do next or how to move forward, Stephanie says to Brandon, \"Well your the guy so the ball is in your court. Go hear from God about what we do next. I'm submitting to your lead.\" Brandon took heed and was edified by this responsibility and went to prayer that night to hear from God. When Brandon and Stephanie gathered together again later that next day Brandon had heard from God and shared that their next steps were to submit what they heard to their Pastors, elders and parents and to not share it with anyone else. They took heed and were obedient to God's instructions in which they all witnessed that this was God bringing these two together."
