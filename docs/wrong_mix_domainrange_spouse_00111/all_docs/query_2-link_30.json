In order to cover up losing the ring, Regan must seek out her worst enemy â Chrisâ grandmother (guest star Marion Ross). Meanwhile, Kevin (guest star Jason Lee) returns and tries to win Ava (Maya Rudolph) back with the help of Julian (guest star Chris Diamantopoulos). Jennifer Hall also stars."
