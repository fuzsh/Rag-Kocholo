        "text": "Following her 2017 debut, Stephanie Gibson is returning to Feinstein's/54 Below for a 9:30pm concert on November 8 titled Stephanie Gibson: Glitter, Goblets & Gatos Too.\n\nGibson describes her show as follows: \"Her big belty voice, her rock and roll riffs, and her insane and kooky antics will leave you filled with more joy than a basket of kittens wearing sparkly suspenders and delivering you a large cheese pizza. Fun will be had, songs will be sung, drinks will be drunk. Drank? Drinked? We digress…Join Steph on a wacky ride that only she could take you on: Meet a super special and equally cuckoo guest and maybe there will even be an oooey gooey, lovey dovey duet with her new husband.\"\n\nGibson was most recently seen on Broadway as Cherry Sunday in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Her other Broadway credits include Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella, The Addams Family, and Monty Python's Spamalot. On television, she recently recurred as Pixley on the SyFy show Happy!"
