        "text": "They have been married for five years but working together for the first time to film the story of a crumbling marriage gave Kate Winslet and Sam Mendes a new insight into each other.\n\nBoth say they discovered previously unknown sides to the other while he was directing her in the domestic drama Revolutionary Road, the film which won Winslet one of her two Golden Globes this month.\n\nNeither had actively been searching for a joint project, although they assumed that one day they would work together. Then Winslet discovered the script for Revolutionary Road, which takes a critical look at the underside of the suburban American Dream, and, with Mendes's enthusiastic support, she shepherded it into production.\n\n\"It was very exhilarating to finally work with my wife and I saw a side of her I just didn't know,\" says 43-year-old Mendes. \"I suppose I was really struck by two things: One is just her attention to detail and the other is when she's acting she looks like my Kate---her face is no different, she's not wearing prosthetics and there's no ageing or anything like that---but she is just a different person. I didn't see her on the set---I just saw the character she was playing. It was remarkable.\"\n\nWinslet, 33, had not worked since the 2006 romantic comedy The Holiday when she came across the script for Revolutionary Road. \"I had looked forward to working with Sam at some point in my life, and it had reached the point where wonderful actors like Tom Hanks would tell me he is so great and I would tell them to shut up, because I was starting to get a bit jealous,\" she recalls. \"I wanted to experience this side of him because obviously I have always hugely admired his work but I couldn't know what it felt like until I'd worked with him myself. It was as if the final piece of a puzzle of who my husband really is sort of slotted into place.\"\n\nWhen we meet in Los Angeles, Winslet is feeling \"traumatised,\" she says, at having to leave their two children, Mia, 8 and Joe, 5, behind in New York. \"It's the first time we've both had to be away and the children have been without a parent,\" she says. \"I feel so bad but of course the kids are having a great time with my best friend, who has come over to stay with them for the weekend.\"\n\nWhile they were in Los Angeles they had brief reunion with Leonardo DiCaprio, who co-stars in Revolutionary Road, working with Winslet for the first time since they teamed up on Titanic.\n\nBased on the acclaimed 1961 novel by Richard Yates, Revolutionary Road is set in 1950s America and returns to the suburban milieu of quiet desperation that earned Mendes an Oscar for American Beauty. The story of a heartbreaking schism in a marriage amid the sterility of the suburbs centres on Frank and April Wheeler, a young couple struggling with the dissolution of their dreams and a relationship that is falling apart.\n\nIt was Winslet who sent the script to DiCaprio and urged him to take the role of Frank Wheeler. They had remained in close touch since Titanic and their rapport made the director's task a lot easier.\n\n\"It sounds corny but it's like working with a brother and sister,\" says Mendes. \"They giggle the whole time, they have the same sense of humor and they have the same approach to work. They tease each other and make each other laugh a lot and they're very, very professional when they get in front of the camera. It didn't seem as if there was a 10-year gap after Titanic because they've stayed friends all the time and lived through each other's marriages and girlfriends and other movies.\"\n\nDiCaprio loved the book and the script and had no reservations about portraying a fallible character who could have alienated audiences. \"There was no vanity with Leo and none of the 'Can I be lit from this side?' or 'How cool do I look?'\" says Mendes. \"He just inhabited the role and brought all his 15 years' experience of being a boyfriend and a lover and a partner to the table and I think it's on the screen.\n\n\"Here's a man who does terrible things: he sleeps with another woman, he lies to his wife and yet somehow Leo manages to maintain our sympathy because he has a huge skill as an actor.\n\n\"There were no boundaries; Leo could go anywhere and Kate will never get offended and he knew that and it's exciting to know that someone's never going to get cross with you or embarrassed if you hit them or lift them onto a kitchen cabinet and make love to them or whatever it is. That was enormous good fortune for me because I inherited that relationship and it's the sort of thing you can't really create in rehearsals. It's just there.\"\n\nWorking with his wife meant Mendes had to break his usual habits and take his work home with him. \"I tend to cut off at the end of the day and watch a baseball game or something. I don't like to bring work home. But Kate is the opposite, so I just had to change my ways because it's what she needed and my goal was to get the best performance I possibly could out of her and if she needed to talk about it, then that was my job, too.\n\n\"I was still the director and she didn't try and manipulate me or change the film or persuade me to do things that I didn't want to do. But she did want to talk about it all the time, 24 hours a day.\" He pauses and adds: \"But it was one of best experiences I've ever had.\"\n\nThe couple met when Mendes wanted to cast Winslet in a play at the Donmar Warehouse theatre in London, where he was artistic director from 1992 to 2002. They went public with their relationship in November 2001 and married in May 2003. Winslet had previously been married to Jim Threapleton, an assistant director who is the father of her daughter Mia.\n\nMendes and Winslet divide their time between homes in New York and the Cotswolds in the English countryside and, says Winslet, try to live as normal a life as possible.\n\n\"As a family we do normal things that other family would,\" she says. \"It's important to us that the children are just regular kids, so we go to the park, kick a ball around, go to a museum, watch a movie together or just hang out at home playing Monopoly.\"\n\nWinslet's Oscar nomination last week for The Reader was her sixth – but she has never won. She makes no secret of her desire to put that right this year.\n\n\"Yes, an Oscar means a lot and of course I want to win. I absolutely want to win.\"\n\nMendes, on the other hand, won the best director Oscar for his first movie, American Beauty, but his subsequent films, Road to Perdition and Jarhead, have not been so well received.\n\n\"I feel like I've been given a big bank loan and I have to pay it off over a number of years,\" he says. \"The truth is that for the first year or two after American Beauty it was difficult because you think, 'Well, what do I do now? How can I follow that?'\n\n\"Hopefully I'll keep paying off my loan a little bit at a time and maybe in ten years I will have paid it all off,\" he laughs. \"You never know.\""
