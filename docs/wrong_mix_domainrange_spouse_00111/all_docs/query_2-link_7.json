        "text": "I grew up on a tobacco farm outside of Hemingway, SC. After graduating from high school, I moved to Cleveland, TN, where I graduated with a BA in Intercultural Studies from Lee University; married Brandon Gibson and later earned a Master of Science in Counseling Psychology, also from Lee University. In 2007, I returned to SC, taking a job with Waccamaw Center for Mental Health in Georgetown before joining the practice at LifeCare Psychology Group in 2014. Since my return home, I have acquired a licensed professional counselor (LPC) and obtained ordination with the Church of God.\n\nBrandon and I recently have been married for over 20 years. We enjoy time together, with our pets and with family and friends. We also seek to serve the Lord in our community, home and church any way that we can.\n\nI use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approaches integrated with Christian principles and Interpersonal Therapy techniques. I attempt to make all the patients I work with feel cared for and valued. Change is hard to accomplish and takes time to do so, but if a person is willing to make new choices in his or her life, then change will happen. I believe that spirituality is an important part of everyone's overall well-being and I strive to explore spirituality with my patients if that is something they want to discuss."
