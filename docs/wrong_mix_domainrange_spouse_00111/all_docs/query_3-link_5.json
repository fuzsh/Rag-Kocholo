        "text": "Congratulations are in order for Sam Mendes and classical musician Alison Balsom, who are husband and wife. A spokesperson confirmed the happy news to HELLO! Online, simply stating that \"Sam and Alison are married\". The newlyweds chose to officially tie the knot in a registry office, before holding a blessing at the weekend at St Michael & All Angels, in the quaint vilage of Great Tew in Oxfordshire.\n\n\"The couple had a blessing,\" Rev Ginny Thomas revealed to the Daily Mail. \"The wedding had been help previously at a register office. That's all I can say.\"\n\nSam Mendes and musician Alison Balsom have tied the knot\n\nSam, 51, and Alison, 38, have kept their romance largely out of the spotlight, although they did make a public appearance together in November, when Sam accompanied Alison to Buckingham Palace as she collected an OBE for her services to music from Prince Charles.\n\nPrior to dating Alison, Skyfall director Sam was in a five year relationship with actress Rebecca Hall, following the end of his eight year marriage in 2011 to Kate Winslet. He and Kate are parents to a 13-year-old son, Joe, together.\n\nTrumpet player Alison, meanwhile, separated in 2011 from her long-term partner, conductor Edward Gardner, with whom she has a six-year-old son Charlie.\n\nAlison, 38, is an accomplished trumpet player\n\nIt's not known exactly when Sam and Alison started dating, but romance rumours first emerged last October when it was reported they were moving into a seaside home together in Dorset. An onlooker said at the time; \"It's the talk of the village. They have moved here because Alison loves sailing and is keen to teach Sam.\"\n\nSign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage\n\nEmail Address\n\nBy entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
