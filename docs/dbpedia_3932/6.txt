Cornelia Skinner is Notable.

Cornelia Otis Skinner was an American author, actress and playwright. She was famous for her one-woman shows which she brought on tour to cities across the country from 1926 to 1929. She wrote numerous short humorous pieces for The New Yorker, which were later compiled into books, including Nuts in May, Dithers and Jitters, Excuse It Please, and The Ape in Me. With Emily Kimbrough she was the author of Our Hearts Were Young and Gay. She also wrote for Broadway, including the successful The Pleasure of His Company (1958), which was later adapted as a film (1961).[1] She made a memorable appearance on the game show What's My Line in 1959.[2]

She was born 30 May 1899 in Chicago, the daughter of the famous stage actor Otis Skinner and his wife, the actress Lucy Maud Durbin .[3] At the time of the 1900 U.S. Census, she was one years of age, living with her parents, Otis and Maud. The census indicated that Otis was working as an actor, while no occupation was given for Maud. There was a nurse to help with the baby, and another servant to help with housework.[4] Twenty years later, she was about 21 years old, and living with her parents, along with two maids and one chauffeur. Otis was styled a "stage actor."[5] That same year, Cornelia applied for a U.S. Passport. Her parents each signed a statement attesting to her nativity. Cornelia was planning to travel as a student for study in England, France and Switzerland.[6]

She attended the Baldwin School and Bryn Mawr College (1918-1919) and studied theater at the Sorbonne in Paris. She began her career on stage in 1921.

She was married to Alden Sanford Blodget 5 October 1928 in Warm Springs, Virginia. He was a banker with two children, Alden and Florence, from his previous marriage. Alden and Cornelia's son, Otis Skinner "Dick" Blodget, was born 28 August 1930 in New York City.

Marriage Announcement, 5 October 1928, Boston Herald:[7]

"Boston friends of Miss Cornelia Otis Skinner are interested in the news of her marriage to Mr. Alden Sanford Blodget, which came as a surprise to all but their most intimate friends, as no announcement of their engagement had been made. The ceremony took place in Christ's Church, Warm Springs, Virginia and was followed by a luncheon at Three Hills, the home of Miss Mary Johnston, the novelist. Miss Dorothy Cardwell of Chicago was her cousin's only attendant. Mrs. and Mrs. Blodget are to motor through Virginia, after which they will return to Warm Springs. The bridegroom has two children by his first wife, who is now Mrs. Hendrick R. Jolles of Amsterdam, Holland."

Cornelia's death came 9 July 1979 in New York City at the age of 78.[8] Her remains were interred at Fall River, Bristol County, Massachusetts.[9][10]

Obituary:[14]

New York--Private funeral services will be held for Cornelia Otis Skinner, 78, the actress, playwright and memoirist who died yesterday after a stroke at her home in New York. A memorial service will be held in the fall.

Miss Skinner, whose humor masked her often acerbic observations on customs and times, wrote and delivered her own material for the heater, provoking laughter that was also a balm for her barbs.

Although most people thought of miss Skinner as a superb entertainer and a pleasant anecdotalist, and she was both of these, she had still another dimension, that of serious biographer. Her "Madame Sarah," a life of Sarah Bernhardt, was published in 1967. In her monodramas, Miss Skinner filled a stage with contrasting characters, and she created, produced and performed in several of these over the years, including "The Loves of Charles II," "The Empress Eugenie," "The Mansions on the Hudson" and "The Wives of Henry VIII."

As an actress in a full company, Miss Skinner won critical acclaim in the number of noteworthy roles, including Candida in George Bernard Shaw's play of that name and as Lady Britomart in his "Major Barbara." She was also Julie Lambert in "Theatre," which played on Broadway in 1941, and Emily Hazen in Lillian Hellman's "The Searching Wind" in 1944. She was just as much a hit in the 1950s in "Paris '90" and in "The Pleasure of His Company," a comedy of manners she also co-authored.

Thousand who never saw Miss Skinner on a stage were nonetheless entertained by her as a writer with an eye and pen for the absurd and the hilarious. These were particularly marked on "Our Heart Were Young and Gay," written with Emily Kimbrough and published in 1942. Miss Skinner's other books include "Nuts in May," "Bottoms Up!" and "The Ape in Me."

She was born in Chicago, the daughter of Otis Skinner, a matinee idol noted for his role in "Kismet," and of Maude Durbin Skinner, an actress who was engaged in cultural pursuits after she left the stage when Cornelia was a baby. Miss Skinner left Bryn Mawr College in her sophomore year and studied in Paris.

After the death in 1964 of her husband, sportsman and banker Alden Sanford Blodget, Miss Skinner moved from Long Island into a baronial 10-room cooperative on Lexington Avenue in New York.

Miss Skinner clearly enjoyed both her life as an actress and her life as a writer. Asked once to choose, she said she really couldn't and remarked: "Acting is less painful than writing, and faster." She leaves a son, Otis Skinner Blodget of London, and two stepchildren.
