        "text": "Cornelia Otis Skinner (May 30, 1899 – July 9, 1979) was an American writer and actress.\n\nBiography\n\nSkinner was the only child of actor Otis Skinner and actress Maud Durbin. After attending the all-girls' Baldwin School and Bryn Mawr College (1918–1919), and studying theatre at the Sorbonne in Paris, Skinner made her professional stage debut on September 20, 1921 as Dona Sarasate in Tom Cushing's Blood and Sand at Broadway's Empire Theatre. She appeared in several plays before embarking on a tour of the United States from 1926 to 1929 in a one-woman performance of short character sketches which she had written. She also wrote numerous short, humorous pieces for publications such as The New Yorker. These pieces were eventually compiled into a series of books, including Nuts in May, Dithers and Jitters, Excuse It Please!, and The Ape in Me, among others.\n\nIn a \"comprehensive study\" of Skinner's work, G. Bruce Loganbill (1961) refers to Skinner's scripts as \"monologue-dramas,\" which were extensions of the \"linked monologues\" developed by Ruth Draper. Skinner's work differed in structure and content, however, as she created and performed full-length monologue-dramas that were based on the lives of historical figures. Such work was described as a \"unique\" and important contribution to the one-person show in America.\n\nShe starred in successful production of George Bernard Shaw's \"Candida\" in 1939, that toured venues in cities such as Cleveland before opening on Broadway.\n\nShe appeared with Orson Welles on The Campbell Playhouse radio play of \"American Cavalcade: The Things We Have\" on May 26, 1939.\n\nWith Emily Kimbrough, Skinner wrote Our Hearts Were Young and Gay, a light-hearted description of their European tour after college. Kimbrough and Skinner went to Hollywood to act as consultants on the film adaptation of the book, produced as a film of the same name, with Gail Russell playing Skinner. The book was also adapted as a 1950 television series The Girls, in which Skinner was portrayed by Bethel Leslie (replaced by Gloria Stroock).\n\nIn 1952, Skinner's one-woman show Paris '90 (music and lyrics by Kay Swift) premiered on Broadway. An original cast recording was produced by Goddard Lieberson for Columbia Records, and is now available on compact disc. In later years Skinner wrote Madame Sarah (a biography of Sarah Bernhardt), and Elegant Wits and Grand Horizontals about the Belle Epoque.\n\nIn a 1944 conversation with Victor Borge, Skinner reportedly told the Danish comedian that she decided to drop the term \"diseuse\" from her act after reading in a Scottish newspaper: \"Cornelia Otis Skinner, the American disease, gave a program last night.\"\n\nMarriage\n\nCornelia Otis Skinner married Alden Sanford Blodget on October 5, 1928 in Warm Springs, Virginia. On August 28, 1930, she gave birth to her only child, a son, Otis Skinner Blodget, who died on March 11, 2007, aged 76.\n\nFilmography\n\nAs an actress\n\nThe Uninvited (1943) - Miss Holloway\n\nGeneral Electric Guest House (1951, episode dated July 1, 1951)\n\nParis '90 (1952)\n\nThe Girl in the Red Velvet Swing (1955) - Mrs. Thaw\n\nMax Liebman Presents: Dearest Enemy (1955, TV Episode) - Mrs. Murray\n\nThe Alcoa Hour (1956, Episode: \"Merry Christmas, Mr. Baxter\") - Susan Baxter\n\nThe Swimmer (1968) - Mrs. Hammar\n\nAs herself\n\nStage Door Canteen (1943)\n\nToast of the Town (later The Ed Sullivan Show) TV episodes #4.7 (1950), #4.14 (1950), #5.32 (1952), and #7.8 (1953)\n\nFaye Emerson's Wonderful Town (1951), TV episode dated June 23, 1951\n\nWhat's It For?
