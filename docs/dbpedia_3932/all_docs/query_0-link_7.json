        "text": "December 16, 2020\n\nPicked this up because it was co-authored by Samuel Taylor (of \"Sabrina Fair\" fame) and Cornelia Otis Skinner (actress, daughter of Otis Skinner and co-author of \"Our Hearts Were Young and Gay\"). That being said, the script itself was clever, quite the \"rueful comedy\". The characters were engaging, the drawing-room drama interesting. However I just LOATHED that biological father. He had his chance, had absolutely no concern for his daughter when she growing up, and decides to come back and dazzle her the week before her wedding! WHY? Because he's a selfish SOB fresh off his third marriage who needs another adoring subject. He lies, cheats, and manipulates his way into her heart, and when the daughter has a fraction of understanding of why he's chasing after her now, she ignores it to prop him up in his fragile self-esteem. What a BUST!"
