He hasn't laid eyes on the girl since she was a sprout and now discovering her a resplendent young woman, he turns on the charm that has won his reputation in all the playgrounds of the world. The daughter is utterly transported, the mother and the fiance are helpless against this sophisticated tidal wave. But the impasse is rationally resolved when the girl wins her plea to be allowed a small sabbatical abroad [with her father] before settling down to the marriage she still cherishes.\""
