        "text": "Cornelia Otis Skinner was raised in Bryn Mawr and began her career on the stage at Bryn Mawr College, where she starred in Shakespeare’s Macbeth during her sophomore year.\n\nBy: KATHY O’LOUGHLIN\n\n“To cement a new friendship, especially between foreigners or persons of a different social world, a spark with which both were secretly charged must fly from person to person, and cut across the accidents of place and time.”\n\nCornelia Otis Skinner\n\nYou could say Cornelia Otis Skinner’s life was an open book. Especially since she wrote those books herself, including autobiographical accounts of her family’s theatrical life and her own adventures in Paris and London as a young woman.\n\nCornelia Otis Skinner was raised in Bryn Mawr and began her career on the stage at Bryn Mawr College, where she starred in Shakespeare’s Macbeth during her sophomore year.\n\nHer acting career brought her accolades from stage, movies and television. In 1939 she starred in the Broadway play Candida, in the movie The Things We Have and in The Campbell Playhouse radio play of The Things We Have with Orson Wells. Her list of co-stars reads like a Who’s Who of Hollywood legends including Harpo Marx, Ray Milland, Burt Lancaster, Tallulah Bankhead, Helen Hayes, Fred Astaire and Katharine Hepburn, a fellow Bryn Mawr College student. Cornelia’s television appearances were usually instances where she played herself, as in guest spots on What’s My Line and This is Your Life.\n\nHer writing career spawned several books, plays and magazine essays. Her most successful novels were those she wrote with her close friend Emily Kimbrough about their humorous adventures traveling across Europe after college. That novel and its sequel were adapted into popular movies. She published her last book at age 75, just three years before she died.\n\nThe actress also proved successful at directing and producing plays on Broadway, including several in which she starred as the sole performer. In between all that she even found time to get married and raise a son.\n\nThat Cornelia Otis Skinner would become a performer surprised no one. She came from a theatrical family. Her father Otis Skinner was a successful Shakespearean actor. Her mother Maud Durbin also performed in Broadway opposite her husband, and Cornelia’s cousin Harold Skinner also starred in several movies.\n\nAn only child, Cornelia and her parents performed in several Broadway plays together and years later Cornelia and her father combined their talents together in several movies.\n\n“Throughout her career Skinner made significant inroads for women in the theater. Her one-woman mono-dramas were innovative and demonstrated her extraordinary ability to bring the women she portrayed to life in front of her audience. As a playwright, actress, essayist, and author, she earned the admiration of her peers, the critics, and her fans,” reads her biography on the on-line encyclopedia Wikipedia.\n\nBorn into an acting family\n\nNamed after her father, Otis Skinner, Cornelia Otis Skinner was destined to follow in his shoes as an actor who was equally at ease on stage or film and who was successful at both. She was born May 20, 1901, in Chicago.\n\nWhen she was just 5 years old, her family moved to Bryn Mawr, where she was raised by her mother who gave up her acting career to stay home with her daughter. Her father continued to star in many Broadway plays as well as touring productions of those same plays, many of which were adaptations of Shakespeare’s plays.\n\nCornelia attended Bryn Mawr College in 1918 and 1919, where she studied theater. Among the plays she performed in at the college was Shakespeare’s Macbeth.\n\nIn her sophomore year the lore of France tore her away from the Main Line as she traveled to Paris to study theater at the Sorbonne. Fluent in French, she studied acting at the Jacques Copeau School and the Comedie Francaise. While in France she took to the stage in 1921, appearing in several plays before embarking on a three-year U.S. tour from 1926 to 1929 in a one-woman performance of short character sketches she wrote herself. In 1928, she married Alden S. Blodget and the couple later had one son.\n\nDuring this time, she also penned numerous humorous pieces for magazines like The New Yorker. Years later these essays would be compiled in a series of autobiographical novels. Quotes taken from her essays and novels provide a glimpse into her view of life, and often showcase her humor. “One learns in life to keep silent and draw one’s own confusions,” she quipped.\n\nOf friendship, she wrote, “To cement a new friendship, especially between foreigners or persons of a different social world, a spark with which both were secretly charged must fly from person to person, and cut across the accidents of place and time.”\n\nOf being a woman, she wrote, “Women have a special corner of their hearts for sins they have never committed.” and “Women’s virtue is man’s greatest invention.” And of beauty she wrote, “It’s not that I don’t want to be a beauty, that I don’t yearn to be dripping with glamour. It’s just that I can’t see how any woman can find time to do to herself all the things that must apparently be done to make herself beautiful and, having once done them, how anyone without the strength of mind of a foreign missionary can keep up such a regime.”\n\nOn the Broadway stage\n\nCornelia Otis Skinner made her mark on the Broadway stage as an actress, a writer, producer and a director.\n\nShe made her Broadway debut Sept. 20, 1921, in a two-month run as Dona Sarasate in Blasco-Ibanez’s play Blood and Sand. Also on the stage with her was a performer well known to her – her father Otis Skinner.\n\nShe was back on stage in 1923 with three plays – Will Shakespeare, Tweedles and The Wild Westcotts. Cornelia was the solo performer in the play The Wives of Henry VII that she wrote herself. It ran on Broadway from November 1931 to January 1932. She would return to the stage for a special one-night revival of the play April 2, 1937.\n\nCornelia continued to do double duty on Broadway as both a writer and an actress. Her aptly named play Cornelia Otis Skinner was a series of special sketches performed in November 1931. Her Paris ’90 was a solo monologue she performed for three months in the spring of 1952.\n\nShe hit not one, but two hat tricks with the play Edna His Wife as she was performer, author and producer for the play that debuted Dec. 7, 1937, and The Loves of Charles II that premiered Dec. 27, 1933.\n\nAnd there was also a foursome, all by the name of Cornelia Otis Skinner, associated with the play Mansion on the Hudson in April 1935 where she directed, wrote, starred in and produced.\n\nIn 1939, Skinner earned critical acclaim for her performance in the lead role of George Bernard Shaw’s Candida during its 1937 London production and again in 1939 in the U.S. touring company. Legend has it that when Shaw saw Cornelia’s performance, he cabled her the simple message “Excellent-greatest” to which she replied in another cable, “Undeserving of such praise.” Two more cables were exchanged by the two. Shaw countered with “Meant the play” while Cornelia shot back “So did I.”\n\nLater in her career she won more acclaim for her roles in Love for Love in 1940 and in Lady Windermere’s Fan in 1946. She was honored with the Barter Theatre Award for outstanding acting on the Broadway stage in 1952.\n\nHer final appearance on Broadway was a double-slammer as she was both the writer and star of the play The Pleasure of His Company that premiered Oct. 22, 1958, and ran through Nov. 21, 1959. The play later became a successful movie starring Fred Astaire and Debbie Reynolds\n\nBroadway was in Cornelia’s blood as both of her parents also found recognition and accolades on the stage.\n\nFather Otis Skinner, who was born in 1858 in Cambridge, Mass., made his New York Broadway debut in 1879 and enjoyed a long and varied career in both stage and film work. Like his daughter, Otis Skinner also wrote extensively about the theater.\n\nMother Maud Durbin, who was often listed in Broadway pamphlets as Mrs. Otis Skinner, performed in four Broadway plays, all ones that also starred her husband. They included Pietro, The Silent Voice, The Harvester and Prince Otto, which debuted Sept. 3, 1900, and marked the writing, producing and acting debut of Otis Skinner.\n\nDiscovering talent as a writer\n\nCornelia Otis Skinner also proved to be successful as a writer of plays, essays and novels.\n\nShe wrote her first play, Captain Fury, for her father who performed it off-Broadway in 1925. That same year she wrote and performed her first one-woman show.\n\nCornelia, as well as her audiences, loved the way she was able to first write the words and then perform them as one-woman plays. Over the next several years she traveled the across the United States performing her monologues to appreciative audiences.\n\n“Skinner used sharp wit and keen observation to create characters that fascinated audiences,” reads her biography on Wikipedia.\n\nDuring the early 1930s, Cornelia Otis Skinner focused on her interest in historical women. Researching her characters extensively, she wrote and portrayed a range of unique women in her monologues, including The Wives of Henry VII (1931), The Empress Eugenie (1932), The Loves of Charles II (1933), and The Mansion on the Hudson (1935).\n\nShe also earned considerable recognition for her adaptation of Margaret Ayer Barne’s novel Edna, His Wife, into a successful play that toured London in 1937 and the United States in 1938.\n\nIn her essays and novels, Cornelia Otis Skinner took a humorous look at life, including her own. In The Ape in Me, she writes about her college days, sharing, “I was known as the Tall Girl of my set and the few callow youths who dated me would hardly have been able to let linger a kiss on any feature much above my chin, even if I thrust it forward in the manner of an amorous heifer.”\n\nIn 1942, Cornelia, with the help of her friend and confidante Emily Kimbrough, wrote Our Hearts Were Young and Gay, a humorous recounting of their trip to Europe after college as two young naive women and some of their more unusual revelations including their unexpected experiences with bed bugs and brothels as well as an episode where the two are stranded atop Notre Dame Cathedral at midnight. The novel spent five weeks atop the New York Times bestseller list and sold over a million copies.\n\nIn describing her best friend, Cornelia wrote, “To know Emily is to enhance one’s days with gaiety, charm and occasional terror.”\n\nThe Cornelia and Emily duo later were called out to Hollywood to serve as consultants when the novel was transformed into a popular movie. And what are two girls to do with all the fun tidbits from such an outing other than to write about it. Their foray into movie land was captured in their next book, We Followed Our Hearts To Hollywood.\n\nThe movie of Our Hearts Were Young And Gay proved so popular the duo wrote a sequel that was also made into a movie sequel.\n\nCornelia Otis Skinner completed her memoirs in 1948, focusing on her career and that of her father. The book was published in the United States as Family Circle and in England as Happy Family.\n\nNever one to shy away from a challenge, the woman who had written plays and novels turned her attention to authoring a television series called The Girls in 1950.\n\nCornelia Otis Skinner wrote the one-woman play Paris ’90 in 1952 along with Kay Swift, who provided the music and lyrics. In the play Cornelia plays 14 different characters. The play was released a decade later in a book adaptation entitled Elegant Wits and Grand Horizontals.\n\nIn later years, Cornelia wrote the biography of Sarah Bernhardt titled Madame Sarah. Her last book, a biography of Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse, called Life with Lindsay and Crouse, was published when she was 75.\n\nMoving onto Hollywood\n\nCornelia Otis Skinner wasn’t nervous in her first movie role, probably because the silent movie starred her father Otis Skinner. The 1920 movie starred Otis as Hajj, a rascally beggar on the periphery of the court of Baghdad, who schemes to marry his daughter to royalty and to win the heart of the queen of the castle himself. A remake of the movie was made a with Otis in the starring role.\n\nWith leading man Ray Milland cast, it is no wonder actors and actresses were lining up to capture co-starring roles with him in the 1944 movie The Uninvited. Cornelia Otis Skinner was one of those cast mates, and in a bit of six degrees of separation, so was Gail Russell. That same year Gail Russell portrayed Cornelia Otis Skinner in Our Hearts Were Young and Gay, the film based on Cornelia’s novel.\n\nThe Uninvited tells the tale of a brother and sister who move into an old, abandoned seaside house on the English coast. Their original enchantment with the house diminishes as they hear stories of the previous owners and meet their daughter, now a young woman, who lives as a neighbor with her grandfather. Before long the siblings hear unexplained sounds during the night and come to realize the house is haunted. The reasons for the haunting and how they relate to the daughter with whom the brother is falling in love, prove to be a complex mystery. As they are compelled to solve it, the supernatural activity at the house increases to a frightening level.\n\nAnother movie with a Cornelia Otis Skinner connection is the The Pleasure Of His Company that was adapted from a play Cornelia wrote and starred in. The romantic comedy starred Fred Astaire as Biddeford “Pogo” Poole, the long-absent prodigal father of Jessica Poole, played by Debbie Reynolds. He re-enters her life just as she is about to be married, much to the dismay of Jessica’s mother and Pogo’s ex-wife Katharine, played by Lilli Palmer, and her new husband James Dougherty, played by Gary Merrill. To get back into the family circle, he puts on the old charm, but before the film’s end realizes that charm alone is no substitute for parental responsibility.\n\nAlthough no longer a leading lady, Cornelia Otis Skinner continued to make her mark later in life in two popular films – Stage Door Canteen and The Swimmer.\n\nWhen they say star studded, they mean Stage Door Canteen. Financed in large part by the Theatre Guild with all the proceeds going to wartime fundraising drives, the movie unfolds at the Stage Door Canteen, a Manhattan-based home away from home for soldiers, sailors and marines. Since the real life Canteen on 44th Street was too busy to lend itself to filming, the canteen’s interiors were recreated on a Hollywood sound stage.\n\nWithin the walls of the canteen servicemen are entertained by top musical, comedy and dramatic acts, and waited on by such Broadway luminaries as Cornelia Otis Skinner, Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, Katharine Hepburn Tallulah Bankhead, Helen Hayes, Gypsy Rose Lee, George Jessel Ralph Bellamy, Sam Jaffe and Paul Muni.\n\nAdd to the cast of illuminaries band leaders Guy Lombardo, Benny Goodman, Xavier Cugat and Count Basie and his Orchestra, comedians Ray Bolger, Harpo Marx, George Jessel and Ed Wynn, ventriloquist Edgar Bergen with Charlie McCarthy, singers Ethel Merman and Peggy Lee and Tarzan’s Johnny Weissmuller.\n\nThe movie also offers the only film appearance of Broadway great Katherine Cornell who offers a vignette of the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet.\n\nReleased in 1968, “The Swimmer” proved to be popular with the ladies in that Burt Lancaster, who plays a wealthy, middle-aged advertising man, spends the entire movie in his bathing suit. Lancaster’s character embarks on a revelatory journey through suburban Connecticut as he makes his way from house to house and swimming pool to swimming pool. At each stop he comes face to face with an incident from his past as he becomes more and more disillusioned with his life that he once thought was idyllic.\n\nAmong the characters he meets along the way is Kim Hunter who appears indifferent to Lancaster’s revelation of a secret love for her, Janice Rule who plays his still volatile ex-mistress and Cornelia Otis Skinner, an elderly neighbor who is furious at Lancaster’s intrusion in her backyard and immediately orders him to leave.\n\nAt the time of its release many critics called the movie “too artsy” and “too self-conscious.” Among the more interesting trivia from the movie, it marked the first movie work by a 22-year-ld composer named Marvin Hamlisch as well as an appearance by Joan Rivers."
