        "text": "I have probably seen this movie 40 or 50 times since video has been in existence, and I have yet to tire of watching Mr. Class, Fred Astaire, weave his way through this Cornelia Otis Skinner/Samuel Taylor gem of a light comedy that engages you from start to finish.\n\nEverything about this production from the opening credits appearing over what could be the finest still photography of San Francisco ever put on the screen to the ensemble of endearing characters to the heart-warming musical themes, fashion PLEASURE OF HIS COMPANY into a film that after forty years still spins an enduring tale of a long, lost playboy father turning up unexpectedly to attend his daughter's wedding.\n\nLili Palmer is a perfect fit as Astaire's spicy, estranged wife who may have never quite doused the flames for her ex; Debbie Reynolds is a natural as the naiive daughter pining for the real father she never had; Gary Merrill offers a rather patient detachment from most all of Astaire's antics as his current wife nearly loses her heart all over again to her ex-husband's charm. Charley Ruggles is the aloof, wise grandfather, who seems to be amused by Astaire's manipulations and really has little to do or say until uttering a few choice observations near the end. Tab Hunter turns in a surprisingly solid performance as Reynolds' rancher-fianc√©e--especially when considering that in 1961 Hunter was still pretty much stuck in his \"teen idol\" phase.\n\nThe fun of this movie, before it turns to sad lessons of regret, lies in catching the dialogue repartee and the meddling contrivances of Astaire. For some of the exchanges between Astaire and Palmer on second marriage and \"dull, domestic life,\" get a solid side swipe by playboy Biddiford Poole, before he himself gets the final comeuppance. In all, the treatment of a long-lost dashing second husband appearing without warning for his daughter's wedding who throws a monkey wrench into the settled lives of well-to-do San Franciscans is, in many ways, wonderfully witty.\n\nTHE PLEASURE OF HIS COMPANY simply does not age. It is one of those enduring pieces that weaves its own charming spell from Astaire's bon-vi-vant arrival at SFO to his grim realization before leaving again: \"I've missed the boat in oh-so-many ways.\" THE PLEASURE OF HIS COMPANY is a light-hearted comedy with a solid message about regret that hits home for many. But lest Astaire become too much an object of sympathy, he has the last laugh on Palmer and Merrill that caps the film with just the right touch at the end.\n\nTrivia: Cyril Ritchard starrred in the original Broadway production, but Astaire, who had just about retired in '58 after the death of his wife, was cast as Biddiford Poole....Delores Hart was originally cast as Jessica, his daughter in the stage play. After making a number of films and earning about $50,000 a picture, Hart stunned Hollywood in 1964 and announced she was entering a convent. She became a nun and remains one to this day...Gary Merrill, who plays Palmer's second husband, also played the husband of Bette Davis in the film classic ALL ABOUT EVE...The exterior of the Dougherty home where some of the action is shot was, in fact, the Spreckle's Mansion, a San Francisco landmark....Tab Hunter was about at the end of his teen idol days when he made this film. He had recorded \"First Love\" which was a top 40 hit in the late '50's....\n\nDennis Caracciolo"
