        "text": "Samuel Taylor was best known for his play “Sabrina Fair” and the popular Audrey Hepburn movie that followed it, “Sabrina,” as well as co-writing the screenplay of the classic Alfred Hitchcock picture, “Vertigo.”\n\nMr. Taylor started out in New York in the 1930s as a play doctor, rewriting and repairing dozens of plays. He wrote for the radio show, “The Aldrich Family,” in the 1940s, while working on his own plays nights and weekends.\n\nHis first play, “The Happy Time,” opened in 1950 and was a big hit, giving Mr. Taylor breathing room to concentrate on new work of his own. His second play, “Sabrina Fair,” and his third one, “The Pleasure of His Company,” written with Cornelia Otis Skinner, were also successful and at the same time he was getting work as a screenwriter—notably on “Sabrina” and “Vertigo,” but also on such films as “The Eddy Duchin Story” (1956), about the well-known pianist and bandleader, and “Goodbye Again” (1961), an Ingrid Bergman love triangle story shot in Paris.\n\nIn the 1960s, Mr. Taylor partnered with composer Richard Rodgers and wrote the book for a new Rodgers musical, “No Strings,” about the romance between a white writer and a black model, set in Paris. Mr. Taylor, who lived with his family in New York , did several other plays and movies during the 1960s and 1970s. The Taylors moved to a village on the coast of Maine in 1968."
