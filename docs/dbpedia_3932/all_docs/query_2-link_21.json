        "text": "(1901–79). U.S. actress and author Cornelia Otis Skinner achieved success both on stage and in print. With satirical wit, she wrote light verse, monologues, anecdotes, sketches, and monodramas in which she displayed her versatile and distinctive acting skills.\n\nCornelia Otis Skinner was born in Chicago, Ill., on May 30, 1901. She made her first professional stage appearance with her father, the tragedian Otis Skinner, in Blood and Sand (1921) and collaborated with him in writing her first play, Captain Fury (1925). During the 1930s she wrote and staged her own monodramas, including The Loves of Charles II, The Empress Eugénie, The Mansions on the Hudson, and The Wives of Henry VIII. In each of these shows she played several different characters, skillfully transforming herself from one role to another. It was not until 1939 in Candida that Skinner established a reputation as a fine actress, and she confirmed her excellence as a dramatic actress in Theatre (1941). She won critical acclaim also for her roles in Lady Windermere’s Fan (1946), Paris ’90 (1952), and The Pleasure of His Company (1958), which she wrote with Samuel Taylor.\n\nSkinner’s diverse writing ability was evident in her 1942 best-seller, Our Hearts Were Young and Gay, written with Emily Kimbrough, and in the serious and moving Madame Sarah (1967), which chronicled the life of the French actress Sarah Bernhardt. Skinner died on July 9, 1979, in New York City."
