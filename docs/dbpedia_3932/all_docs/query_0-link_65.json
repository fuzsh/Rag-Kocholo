        "text": "Briefly state why you think this production's name should be deemed \"not family safe\" e.g. for a photograph: \"sheer clothing\", \"suggestive pose\" ; for a play: an offensive, sexually explicit, or very profane title... basically anything your wouldn't want your neighbor's 12 year old kid to see if you were babysitting.\n\nTry to be specific in what you're reporting on -- if you are reporting a non-safe image, click on the image and make the report from the gallery page. Likewise if you are on a production page, and think the play title is not family safe, click on the play title, and make your report about the play, and not just a specific production.\n\nNote, this will not necessarily censor the image or page, but we have to know which pages we can't run ads on. We do, of course, reserve the right to remove or edit any content we deem not appropriate for the vast majority of our users."
