        "text": "This is, at last, the long-awaited \"Complete Skinner,\" the whole works in one new, smart volume, as indispensable to modern living as a bunch of flowers, a gay picture on the wall or a new spring hat.\n\nIf you've ever had a baby, if you've tried to keep warm in a duck blind, taken Russian lessons or struggled around a skating rink, you'll laugh at and with Cornelia Otis Skinner. Her humor has that rare quality which shows its depth and genuineness in her ability to laugh at herself. It takes a true universality in its sympathy with other poor mortals in the same unsettling situations.\n\nDished up here is an utterly delightful mixed grill, a Skinner anthology containing TINY GARMENTS and all the favorite absurdities from DITHERS AND JITTERS, SOAP BEHIND THE EARS and EXCUSE IT, PLEASE! The parodies, indignations, enthusiasms (with liberal doses of nonsense) are as gay and mildly mad as ever.\n\nAlajalov's drawings, pertinent and impertinent, are a perfect complement to the text.\n\nCornelia Otis Skinner was an American author and actress. Skinner was the daughter of the actor Otis Skinner and his wife Maud (Durbin) Skinner. After attending the all-girls' Ethel Walker School, and Bryn Mawr College (1918-1919) and studying theatre at the Sorbonne in Paris, she began her career on the stage in 1921. She appeared in several plays before embarking on a tour of the United States from 1926 to 1929 in a one-woman performance of short character sketches she herself wrote. She wrote numerous short humorous pieces for publications like The New Yorker. These pieces were eventually compiled into a series of books, including Nuts in May, Dithers and Jitters, Excuse It Please!, and The Ape In Me, among others.\n\nWith Emily Kimbrough, she wrote Our Hearts Were Young and Gay, a hilarious description of their European tour after college. Kimbrough and Skinner went to Hollywood to act as consultants on the film version of the book, which resulted in We Followed Our Hearts to Hollywood. Skinner was portrayed by Bethel Leslie in the shortlived 1950 television series 'The Girls,' based on Our Hearts Were Young and Gay.\n\nIn later years Skinner wrote Madame Sarah, a biography of Sarah Bernhardt, and Elegant Wits and Grand Horizontals about the Belle Epoque.\n\nShe also appeared with Orson Welles on The Campbell Playhouse radio play of The Things We Have on May 26, 1939."
