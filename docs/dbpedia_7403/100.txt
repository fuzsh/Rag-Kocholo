Over on my personal blog I am conducting a long project where I look hard at one of the most interesting serial narratives of the last few decades: cult hit Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I’m looking episode-by-episode to see how the narrative builds over time, how the show identifies and solves storytelling problems, and how the craft and the mysteries resonate throughout every piece of story.

These aren’t episode reviews – these are dives into the mechanics of storytelling. It’s probably hard to follow if you haven’t seen any of Buffy, but if you have, I promise you there will be insights here you’ve never before encountered.

I’ll update this episode index periodically, but you can always find every post by clicking on the Buffy tag on my personal blog.

UPDATE: Finished Buffy’s high school years, i.e. the first three seasons, which seems as good a time as any to take a much-needed rest!
