        "text": "While it's easy to disregard Borba's words as the random raves of some lunatic, I believe there is a more logical explanation here. I think he's just talking about canned pork & beans, with nothing easter-egg-y about it, and that the phrase was simply chosen because it fits his character and world view.\n\nLet's examine who this guy is. We first see him on a city bus all dressed in military garbs, harrassing passengers and spouting semi-religious rants about Judgement Day. He's big, menacing, unkempt and basically seems like some transient or veteran that's gone mad, or a deluded militia man (we later find out he's a suspect in a double homicide). Then, after waking up in the funeral home, the now-sired Borba sees a group of teens before him and says this:\n\nHe is risen in me! Pork and beans. Pork and beans! I can smell you. You're the chaff, unblessed. I'll suck the blood from your hearts, he says I may!"
