        "text": "Today marks the 20th anniversary of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. March 10, 1997, saw the first episode of the hit horror series premiere in the US, establishing Buffy Summers as the Chosen One, a girl born in each generation to stand against the vampires, the demons, and the forces of darkness - the Slayer.\n\nExcept, that's not the whole story.\n\nWhile the series would go on to run for seven seasons, launch the spin-off Angel, and establish a shared universe that's still running in comic books, Buffy didn't originate on TV. The character is actually 25 years old, and although she won a legion of fans through Sarah Michelle Gellar's character on television, the Slayer first appeared on film, played by Kristy Swanson, in 1992.\n\nWhile Buffy creator Joss Whedon still had a hand in the movie version, credited as writer, what reached viewers was a far cry from his original intentions (he'd eventually do alright for himself, though). Directed by Fran Rubel Kuzui, the film heavily modified Whedon's original script (which you can read online in full, for free), taking a sharp reflection on horror movie clichés and turning it into a tacky comedy that embraced its B-Movie roots, rather than subverted them.\n\nAs even the trailer makes clear, this Buffy took a very different, and far campier tone than the slick teen horror of the later TV show. Buffy is framed as the object of affection for love interest Pike (played by Luke Perry, at the time one of the most in-demand young actors, coming off the back of Beverley Hills 90210), rather than the feminist icon the character would later become. There's far more of a high-school comedy vibe at work, and Swanson's over-the-top Valley Girl performance (\"I'm so sure!\") lacked much of the depth Gellar would bring to the role.\n\nThe vampires Movie Buffy faces are less complex too, with big bad Lothos (Rutger Hauer) a straight parody of Hammer Horror's Dracula, while his henchman Amilyn (Paul Reubens) is cartoonish to the point of farce. There's none of the ancient manipulations of The Master to fear here, nor the deranged obsession and insanity of Spike and Drusilla, or even the sinister cheeriness of demonically obsessed Sunnydale mayor, Richard Wilkins. The movie's vamps don't shift into vampface or explode into dust when they're staked either.\n\nAll the ingredients the Buffy fans came to love are there, though. Buffy herself remains, conceptually at least, a sharp inversion of horror movie clichés - the 'dumb blonde' who would normally be slain by the monsters in the first act, but is instead the one slaying them. She still has a Watcher guiding her through her destiny - here the creepy Merrick, played by Donald Sutherland, rather than Anthony Stewart Head's stern but devoted Rupert Giles - and Pike feels like a dry run for Nicholas Brendon's initially besotted, later joint-best friend Xander in the show. There's no direct comparison to Alyson Hannigan's Willow in the film, but Hilary Swank did have a small role as Kimberley Hannah, one of Buffy's friends.\n\nThe seeds for the wider mythology of the 'Buffyverse' are sown too, with previous Slayers referred to. In the film, Merrick alludes that the Slayer is reincarnated each generation, rather than the power laying latent in young women around the world until her predecessor dies.\n\nDespite the differences, the movie does remain in continuity - sort of. Aside from vague references to what happened at Buffy's old high school in the show's first episode, Welcome to the Hellmouth, that establish the events of the movie having occurred in some fashion, a 1999 comic book miniseries, Buffy The Vampire Slayer: The Origin, adapts Joss Whedon's original script, and fits it into the timeline of the show. Cleverly, the comics are framed as Buffy telling Xander and Willow how she remembers becoming the Slayer, allowing for any disparities to be overlooked as exaggeration or misremembering.\n\nDespite being clearly dated, the 1992's Buffy remains a surprisingly light-hearted and cheesily enjoyable film in places, even if it lacks most of the strengths of the series. It's worth tracking down for Buffy fans who've never seen it, even if it's just to see where the Slayer came from.\n\nThis article was originally published by WIRED UK\n\nHe Made a Movie About Humans Rising Up Against AI.
