        "text": "01 of 10\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar as Buffy Summers\n\nSince Buffy the Vampire Slayer ended, '90s fave Sarah Michelle Gellar has stayed busy with a slew of movie roles, including The Grudge (2004), The Grudge 2 (2006), The Air I Breathe (2007) and Possession (2009). She also starred on All My Children, Ringer and The Crazy Ones with the late Robin Williams. She released the cookbook Stirring Up Fun with Food in 2017.\n\nIn 2023, Gellar brought her monster-slaying skills back to the small screen on the Paramount+ original series Wolf Pack.\n\nOn the 25th anniversary of Buffy the Vampire Slayer in March 2022, Gellar shared a throwback photo of herself on Instagram and reflected on her time on the show, writing, \"25 years ago today I had the honor to introduce the world to my version of Buffy Anne Summers.\"\n\nShe continued, \"It was an uphill battle. A mid season replacement, on a new network based on a movie, that was by no means a giant success. But then there was you. The fans. You believed in us.\"\n\nGellar married actor Freddie Prinze Jr. in 2002, a few years after meeting on the set of the 1997 teen horror flick I Know What You Did Last Summer. The couple has two children together, Charlotte and Rocky.\n\n02 of 10\n\nNicholas Brendon as Xander Harris\n\nThe actor starred on several TV series following his run as Buffy's BFF Xander. His credits include Kitchen Confidential, Private Practice, and Criminal Minds.\n\nAfter Buffy the Vampire Slayer wrapped, Nicholas Brendon was in the news several times for legal and personal issues with his mental health. He went to rehab in 2004 and again in 2010 following an incident with the police. Brendon was then arrested in 2014 and multiple times in 2015. He eventually checked himself into a 90-day treatment program in late October 2015.\n\nIn May 2019, Brendon was charged with domestic violence for his October 2017 arrest, where he allegedly attacked his girlfriend in a California hotel room. He was also arrested in August 2021 for allegedly using false information to obtain prescription drugs. Brendon made headlines again one month later when he canceled promotional events surrounding his film Wanton Want (2021). His manager, Theresa Fortier, told The Daily Mail that the actor reportedly suffered \"deep-seated medical problems and immense pain\" as a result of Cauda equina syndrome, which affects the lumbar spine and limits movement. His condition was reportedly exacerbated after his jail stint in August at Vigo County Jail in Indiana.\n\nBrendon and his estranged wife, Moonda Tee, split in February 2015, less than five months after tying the knot.\n\n03 of 10\n\nAlyson Hannigan as Willow Rosenberg\n\nAlong with her successful run as Buffy's other BFF, Willow, Alyson Hannigan garnered fans with her role in the American Pie movie series, then moved right on to How I Met Your Mother after Buffy wrapped. \"I feel so lucky to have success twice,\" she told PEOPLE in December 2007.\n\nIn 2019, Hannigan landed the role of Kim Possible's mother on the Disney live-action reboot of the 2002 animated series.\n\nHannigan married former Buffy costar Alexis Denisof in 2003, and they have two daughters, Satyana and Keeva.\n\n04 of 10\n\nDavid Boreanaz as Angel\n\nDavid Boreanaz played Buffy's love interest and ally, Angel, which earned him a spin-off show about the character, the aptly-titled Angel. He has worked steadily after Buffy ended, notably starring on the crime procedural Bones alongside Emily Deschanel. Boreanaz has been a prominent cast member of the military drama SEAL Team since 2017.\n\nBoreanaz is married to actress Jaime Bergman, with whom he has son Jaden and daughter Bardot Vita.\n\n05 of 10\n\nJames Marsters as Spike\n\nJames Marsters played the sexy vampire Spike on Buffy and its spin-off Angel. He also appeared on several other supernatural shows in the following years, including Smallville, The Super Hero Squad and Witches of East End. Other credits include the 2007 film P.S. I Love You and Marvel's Runaways on Hulu. The actor has released music throughout his career with his band Ghost of the Robot.\n\nIn February 2021, Marsters and his wife, Patricia Rahman, separated after 10 years of marriage. Marsters has one son, Sullivan, with ex-wife Liane Davidson and regards his niece as his daughter.\n\n06 of 10\n\nMichelle Trachtenberg as Dawn Summers\n\nMichelle Trachtenberg, who played Buffy's little sister, has gone on to enjoy a successful career on TV, namely Mercy, Weeds, Robot Chicken and, perhaps most famously, Gossip Girl and the HBO Max reboot. Trachtenberg has also executive-produced a few projects, including the Tubi series Meet, Marry, Murder.\n\n07 of 10\n\nAnthony Head as Rupert Giles\n\nAfter Buffy, Anthony Head appeared on Little Britain, Merlin, Dominion and Guilt. He can also be seen on the Emmy-winning Apple TV+ series Ted Lasso, Netflix's Bridgerton and the BBC sitcom Motherland. His film credits include Imagine Me & You (2005), The Iron Lady (2011), Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters (2013) and Let the Right One In (2021).\n\nHead lives in Somerset, England, with his partner Sarah Fisher, with whom he has two daughters, Emily and Daisy.\n\n08 of 10\n\nSeth Green as Daniel \"Oz\" Osbourne\n\nSeth Green has stayed busy since his days as werewolf Daniel on both Buffy and on one episode of spin-off Angel, notably with voice work on the Emmy-winning Robot Chicken, Family Guy and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. In 2019, Green released Changeland, marking his debut as a screenwriter.\n\nHe has been married to fellow actor and frequent collaborator Clare Grant since May 2010.\n\n09 of 10\n\nEmma Caulfield as Anya Jenkins\n\nSince her run as a \"Scooby Gang\" member and former demon on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Emma Caulfield has continued to appear on TV, including Gigantic, Life Unexpected, Once Upon a Time and Fantasy Hospital. In 2021, Caulfield starred on the hit Disney+ series WandaVision. The actress has also been candid about her multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, revealing in October 2022 that \"it was like an out-of-body experience.\"\n\nCaulfield welcomed daughter Knightley with her husband, Mark Leslie Ford, in 2016.\n\n10 of 10\n\nCharisma Carpenter as Cordelia Chase\n\nCharisma Carpenter reprised her role as Buffy's ally Cordelia on Angel, and she went on to find more small-screen success on Charmed, Veronica Mars, Greek and The Lying Game. Carpenter also appeared in The Expendables (2010) and The Expendables 2 (2012) as the on-again, off-again girlfriend of Jason Statham's Lee Christmas in the action films.\n\nIn 2021, the actress opened up about the alleged abuse of power on the Buffy set. Off-screen, Carpenter is mom to son Donovan, whom she shares with ex-husband Damian Hardy."
