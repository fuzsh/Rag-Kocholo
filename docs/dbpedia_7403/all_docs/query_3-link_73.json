        "text": "Audible - more like this please\n\nI loved the performances and the dynamic audio is so well done. This kind of storytelling was new for me so I got a little lost the first time they did a scene change, but then I caught on. Recommend headphones, particularly for fight scenes as motion is conveyed from one side to the other.\n\nI feel like the group dynamic is so much better than the original show. Much more compassion for the characters that are hurting and none of the toxic dynamics labeled as friendship (after years of therapy, the original frustrates me as much as I love it), but still with the heart and fighting for the good despite the bad. Plus lots of humor :D\n\nBy the end of the original show, I didn't much like Willow/Xander/Buffy anymore so personally I don't miss them one bit. This has all my favorite characters plus the new slayer Indira is lovely. Another shot for characters that maybe didn't get the best from the original or like Clem, a character I didn't know I needed more time with. Such a delight.\n\nStory went along great until it stumbled slightly on final approach to the end. It wasn't so much bad as perhaps a difficulty of the medium? How do you \"show and not tell\" when you have zero visuals... hmmm. I found a couple bits repetitive because there were a few instances where characters had to restate things when a new person entered the scene. Repetition may have also been due to treating aspects of the storytelling like episodes of a TV show you'd have to wait a week to continue. So maybe I only noticed because I listened to it in one sitting instead of coming back one episode at a time. Solid conclusion, but not so final that they couldn't continue this story down the line. *hint hint nudge nudge*\n\nI think this format is a great way to continue beloved franchises without \"rebooting\" them. Would love to see more in the Buffyverse as well as others (Stargate Atlantis needs a proper series finale for one). THIS is the sort of media dedicated fans want, not the hash that studio execs seem determined to churn out.\n\nThe Big Bad is BACK (and it’s So Good)!\n\n*Spoilers Ahead* I went into this recording with high expectations after seeing the cast and creators at New York Comic Con, and it did not disappoint. I was hesitant about Cordelia taking the lead as the sole slayer from an alternate universe, and I thought I would miss Willow, Buffy and Xander, but the story was really well done and I absolutely adored Indira as the new bright eyed and bushy tailed protege. This new story captured the same magic as the series as well as the heart. I was especially touched by Cordelia and Indira’s sisterly bond and their final scene together as well as Spike and Dru’s reunion, with all its twists and turns and wonderful wickedness. Thank you to everyone who made this project possible. You’ve brought the Buffyverse magic back in a big way, and I love you for it!"
