        "text": "The title of this episode always makes me think of a book I acquired in the eighth grade, titled How To Get A Teenage Boy And What To Do With Him When You Get Him. It had all kinds of fascinating, if already dated for the time, advice about how to get in with the popular crowd (complete with charts and diagrams), how to be your most interesting self, and other keys to the mysteries of high school social strata. I read it cover to cover more than once, but clearly it did me little good; I never mastered any of the techniques it described. They just weren’t me. My career as a social-climbing man-slayer (romantically speaking) was over before it ever really began… not unlike Buffy’s romance with Owen.\n\nMaybe Emily Dickinson has an appropriate poem for this situation:\n\nI’m Nobody! Who are you? Are you — Nobody — too? Then there’s a pair of us! Don’t tell! they’d advertise — you know!\n\nBuffy isn’t great at heeding advice on her technique, either, although she at least gets the job done, despite her unwillingness to simply “plunge and move on.” She has to do things her way (we don’t yet know Giles hasn’t even bothered with the handbook, having grasped this about her immediately) and make her own fun, yet another reason she fits right in with the Sunnydale misfits.\n\nOh, right. The Master. I keep forgetting about him.\n\nReading from a dusty volume, the Master intones,“And the Slayer will not know him, will not stop him, and he will lead her into Hell.” This is an all too apt description of dating, in my experience, so right on theme.\n\nWe get an inkling here of the tension between reliance on prophecy, and its fallibility: one of the Brethren of Aurelius wasn’t foretold to get himself killed ahead of schedule, before he could be part of the Welcome Committee for the Anointed One. This tension plays out repeatedly within the Buffyverse, first and perhaps foremost in this very first season (although Angel’s Shanshu prophecy is arguably the most lasting and prominent, over on his own show, later). Order and chaos, determination and free will, hierarchical and distributed power… one could map out the entire show based on binary oppositions, or at least continua. Spoiler: prophecies work best when people can be tricked into exercising their free will to carry them out. That feels like a life lesson.\n\nOnce again, Buffy notices the sun and three stars inside the ring, recalls having seen it somewhere before, and immediately finds it in the book she’s holding. This girl does not get nearly enough credit for being smart… for a girl, or an American. Or just, you know, a person.\n\nOwen is the alleged dreamboat, the non-vampiric Angel. “He can brood for forty minutes straight. I’ve clocked him,” Willow says. Not bad for someone who hasn’t been practicing getting his brood on for over a century.\n\nGiles: I'm afraid it's very big.\n\nWillow: Thank you! (confused) Wait! What are you talking about?\n\nGiles: What are you talking about?\n\nBuffy and Willow: Boys!\n\nGiles: Yes, well, I'm talking about trouble. A violent and disturbing prophecy is about to be fulfilled.\n\nAka, the prophecy about first dates. So it all tracks.\n\nAll jokes aside, this one is about the Order of Aurelius. Which, here, appears as little more than a hand-wavy sinister-sounding thing, but later emerges as one of the building blocks of Buffyverse cultural and genealogical lore.\n\nBuffy is wearing some sort of hideous, fuzzy, hooded animal print cape. I’m not sure I’ve ever noticed that before — I do have a bigger TV now, and can see more details in dark scenes. I’m very glad this did not become a wardrobe staple. Perhaps it was given a mercy staking immediately after the last take for this episode, lest it rise again.\n\nFor an episode I never really think about, it has some of my favorite quotable lines from the show. The aforementioned “plunge and move on” (more versatile than it first appears), and of course Buffy’s (not-really-existent) button that says, “I’m a Slayer, ask me how!” (Another phrase that comes in surprisingly handy.) Later: “If the apocalypse comes, beep me.” All classics.\n\nAnother common dynamic that would be worth cataloguing if I were doing that sort of thing: The number of times Buffy is supposed to meet a boy (often Angel), arrives late, and finds said boy talking and/or dancing with someone else (often Cordelia), which triggers the inferiority half of her complex.\n\nTaking public transportation in (or to) Sunnydale is a risky proposition.\n\nBuffy is like two people: the Buffy who wants to be “just a girl,” and the Slayer. The whole series trajectory shows her integrating all aspects of her self, but it sure is a long, hard battle to get there.\n\nGiles is in trouble. Must be Tuesday.\n\nCordelia is disgusted, she’s never seen a girl throw herself at a guy like Buffy is doing with Owen… then Angel walks in and she’s all, “Hello, salty goodness!” (another great catchphrase from this episode). Trust Cordelia to interpret reality in the manner most flattering to herself in any scenario.\n\nThe direction on the opening and closing of morgue drawers at the funeral home is fun.\n\nAnother recurring theme: judgment, especially against some arbitrary “religious” standard. The people who make these judgments are universally portrayed as some combination of crazy, evil (or at best amoral), and selfish.\n\nBuffy shuts down the opportunity to be a sort of Manic Pixie Goth Girl. Sure, Giles helps her couch it as sacrificing some personal pleasure to keep Owen safe, but even before their talk about sacrifice she immediately clued into the fact that Owen’s interest in her was mostly about the way she could take him into those dark places he’s been craving but has so far explored only through poetry. Even at fifteen, she realizes she needs to hold out for more than that. I sure wish I’d had that level of self-esteem as a teenager.\n\nYou know, there was a lot more there than I remembered. I clearly undervalue this episode despite having seen it at least a couple dozen times."
