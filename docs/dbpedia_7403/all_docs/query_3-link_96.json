        "text": "But, after that epic ending more than two decades ago, could we ever see the show back in action in the form of a reboot?\n\nRumours have been swirling for years but every now and then we get a seemingly solid update, suggesting that the Slayer is on her way back to us.\n\nHere's everything we know so far.\n\nMore like this\n\nWill there be a Buffy the Vampire Slayer reboot?\n\nIt's a very cautious yes at the moment after a recent update from Dolly Parton.\n\nParton, whose production company Sandollar Productions produced the original show and spin-off Angel, suggested there are early plans afoot for a reboot.\n\nShe told Business Insider: \"They're still working on that. They're thinking about bringing it back and revamping it.\"\n\nWhether these plans will actually be fruitful and end up in a reboot remains to be seen – but it's an exciting update for fans!\n\nThere have reportedly been various attempts at a Buffy reboot, including one in 2009 from the show's producer Fran Rubel Kuzui, and one in 2018 from Joss Whedon and screenwriter Monica Owusu-Breen – neither of which made their way to screens.\n\nMore recently, many of the cast members reunited for the Audible story Slayers: A Buffyverse Story.\n\nNot technically a sequel or continuation of the Buffy TV series, the audio story nonetheless explores new avenues for some of our favourite characters, picking up 10 years after the events of the series's finale.\n\nWhich cast members could return in a Buffy the Vampire Slayer reboot?\n\nIf a new reboot does go ahead, the writers could decide on an entirely new cast. However, considering the deep connection many of the original cast still have with the show, we'd love to see some appearances from them.\n\nIf original cast members are set to return, we could potentially expect appearances from the following:\n\nAlyson Hannigan as Willow\n\nDavid Boreanaz as Angel\n\nCharisma Carpenter as Cordelia\n\nAnthony Head as Giles\n\nMichelle Trachtenberg as Dawn\n\nSeth Green as Oz\n\nJuliet Landau as Drusilla\n\nUnless something changes in future, Gellar has said she won't return to the role of Buffy.\n\nShe told SFX: \"I am very proud of the show that we created, and it doesn't need to be done. We wrapped that up. I am all for them continuing the story, because there's the story of female empowerment. I love the way the show was left: 'Every girl who has the power can have the power.'\"\n\nIf the story continues on after the events of the original series, there are a few more stars we wouldn't expect to see back. If you've somehow avoided spoilers all this time, you might want to look away now!\n\nWe wouldn't expect a return from Marsters's Spike after his heroic death in the finale episode. The same goes for Emma Caulfield's Anya, who met her demise in the finale.\n\nAmber Benson's Tara also died over the course of the series, prompting complaints from viewers and resulting in heartbreak for Hannigan's Willow. Meanwhile, after the heartbreaking and widely acclaimed episode The Body, which saw the death of Buffy's mother Joyce, we wouldn't expect a return for Kristine Sutherland.\n\nOne cast member who could be added to a reboot is Laya DeLeon Hayes, who played the Slayer Indira for the audio series Slayers: A Buffyverse Story.\n\nBuffy The Vampire Slayer is available to stream on Disney Plus. Sign up to Disney Plus for £4.99 a month or £79.90 for a year."
