        "text": "Violence is mostly cartoonish in earlier seasons but feels stronger later on. Characters are kicked, punched, stabbed, cut, shot, knocked unconscious, have medical tests carried out on them, and are chained up, gagged, and tortured -- sometimes with sexual overtones. A main character drowns and is brought back to life. A gun is fired by an intruder within a school setting; a student is shot but not fatally. A relationship involving central characters is both emotionally and physically abusive, including an attempted rape. A fire breaks out in a church. Many killings throughout -- both of vampires and humans -- and dead bodies are shown, including those of children. Death of a parent is mentioned, as well as a brain tumor. A character cuts their wrists. Mention of suicidal feelings. Generally little gore, but one scene sees a character flayed and hung from a tree with innards briefly exposed.\n\nVampires smoke cigarettes on a number of occasions. Characters drink at bars and with dinner, including an incident where an underage character may have accidentally drunk alcoholic eggnog. Mild intoxication. Drug use is alluded to in the form of addiction to magic and the consumption of \"happy cookies,\" as well as vampires and humans taking a fictional drug called \"orpheus,\" which appears to have a similar effect to opioids.\n\nBuffy is a strong female role model who shows both physical and emotional strength. Her portrayal was widely considered feminist in the mid-'90s. But there's still some casual sexism, including Cordelia being called names alluding to her perceived promiscuity and lack of intelligence. LGBTQ+ representation was also ahead of its time: Bisexual main character Willow dates Tara, followed by a second girlfriend, Kennedy, in normalized relationships that other characters quickly accepted, although Xander's fantasy about Willow and Tara sexualizes lesbians through a straight male gaze, which is damaging. Racial diversity is lacking. Black characters are often heavily stereotyped -- Slayer Kendra's Jamaican accent is mocked by Buffy to imply she doesn't belong; Kendra is killed off after a few episodes. In the series' mythology, the original Slayer, Sineya, was Black and referred to as \"The Primitive,\" first presented crouched and in tribal paint in a manner that demeans Black and Native communities, and it's worsened by her loss of speech being replaced by the voice of a White spirit guide. A Thanksgiving episode acknowledges the killing of Indigenous people, but any progress is undercut by offensive remarks such as \"you have casinos now\" being played for laughs. Finally, typical for a '90s high school series, main characters conform to a similar body type: slim and conventionally attractive."
