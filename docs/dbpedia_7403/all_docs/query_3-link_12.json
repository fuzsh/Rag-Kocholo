        "text": "The first season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer originally aired on The WB television network from March 10 to June 2, 1997. It exceptionally contained only 12 episodes, instead of the common 22 from other seasons.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nAfter moving to Sunnydale, California, Buffy Anne Summers just wants to be a normal teenager. Back in Los Angeles, her first Watcher had died; she inadvertently burned down the school gymnasium at her old high school; and her parents got a divorce. The move to Sunnydale is supposed to give both her and her mother, Joyce, a clean slate. But then she meets the school librarian, Rupert Giles, and quickly learns there is no escaping her destiny.\n\nWith Giles as her new Watcher, she reluctantly steps back into her role as the Slayer. But this time she is not fighting alone. She now has an inner circle of special friends — Willow, Xander, Cordelia, and a mysterious young man named Angel — ready to join the fight and drive in a stake or two if need be.[1]\n\nSummary[]\n\nBuffy moves in Sunnydale with her mother, Joyce, arriving with the hopes of leaving her Slayer duties behind. However, Buffy inevitably came into contact with her Watcher, the librarian Mr. Giles,[2] and two friends who are willing to fight demons alongside her. They soon realize that the town is located on a Hellmouth, a portal to demon dimensions,[3] which attracts supernatural phenomena to the area.[4]\n\nWith the Scooby Gang formed, they have to deal with problems faced by the student population as a result of the centrality of the Hellmouth. Such issues include: witches and controlling mothers;[5] demon teachers taking advantage of virgin students;[4] ignored students turning invisible;[6] and bullying students becoming possessed.[7] All along with the never-ending supply of vampires.[2]\n\nBuffy's inevitable love interest comes in the form of Angel, who frequently turns up with cryptic warnings for her. However, the relationship becomes complicated when the truth about his past is uncovered. Angel is a vampire with a soul that was restored by a Romani tribe many years before.[8]\n\nMeanwhile, the overall concern is the Master's attempts to reach the surface and take over Sunnydale. He is an ancient and powerful vampire who was trapped by an earthquake caused by his attempt to open the Hellmouth decades ago. Buffy and her comrades manage to stop each supernatural threat, typically employing a combination of detective work, frequent physical combat, and extensive research of both ancient mystical texts and computer-accessible records.[3]\n\nUltimately, the Master recruits the prophesied Anointed One,[9] who leads Buffy to her death in the Master's underground prison. The vampire uses her blood to escape to Sunnydale High School, which is located atop the Hellmouth, but Buffy is quickly revived by Xander, who had tracked her with Angel's help. She manages to throw the Master onto a shard of wood, and the Hellmouth is closed again.[10]\n\nCast[]\n\nMain cast[]\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar as Buffy (12/12)\n\nNicholas Brendon as Xander (12/12)\n\nAlyson Hannigan as Willow (12/12)\n\nCharisma Carpenter as Cordelia (10/12)\n\nAnthony Stewart Head as Giles (12/12)\n\nRecurring cast[]\n\nEpisodes[]\n\nNo. Image Title Air date 01 \"Welcome to the Hellmouth\" March 10, 1997 Writer: Joss Whedon Director: Charles Martin Smith Buffy Summers and her mom move to Sunnydale, California, for a fresh start, unaware of the evil lurking in this quiet suburb.

As the earth begins to crack open, Xander, Willow and Cordelia face an army of demons and the prophetic end of the world. Meanwhile, Xander finally asks Buffy to the prom with equally disastrous consequences.\n\nBehind the scenes[]\n\nProduction[]\n\nThe series served as a mid-season replacement for the soap opera Savannah and as such exceptionally contained only 12 episodes, as opposed to the 22 from other seasons.\n\nJoss Whedon has stated: \"In season one, we found that we had a show that people liked. I really thought people were going to laugh at the Buffy/Angel thing and say, 'Well, he's a vampire. This is so hokey.' But they couldn't get enough of it. It definitely made me realize the soap opera aspect of it; a continuing story of the romance and the people and their emotions was really what was fascinating. The monsters were all very well and good, but in the first season we were, like, 'Let's take our favorite horror movies and turn them into high school stories.'\"[11]\n\nCollections[]\n\nThe season was collected in 2002 on the DVD set The Complete First Season on DVD."
