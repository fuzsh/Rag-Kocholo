        "text": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer was one of the biggest shows on television in its time, and as it went on, it changed quite a bit. From a softer story about a cheerleader facing down vampires in alleyways, to a mythic story about a chosen hero fighting to defeat the patriarchy and save humanity from evil itself. As the show changed, so did its cast -- moving from high school to college and beyond, growing and changing, turning good and evil and weird, gaining odd magical traits or losing them, and evolving and becoming new.\n\nA show about what it means to be a teenager, change was always inherent in the series, which is perhaps the explanation for why so little of the show looks the same as it did when it all began, especially given it all began as a very terrible movie made at the very beginning of the â€™90s."
