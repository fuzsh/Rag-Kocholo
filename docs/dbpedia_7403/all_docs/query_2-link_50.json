        "text": "Season 4, episode 17: Superstar. It's a Jonathan episode!!! The Buffy Straya gang has nothing but good things to say about being flung 'Into the Jonathan-Verse' and nothing but bad things to say about Adam (as usual). Fortunately there was a lot more Jonathan than Adam in this episode. Chris had no idea what was happening but came out with a newfound respect and admiration for Jonathan. As usual, Megan had a couple of runner-ups for 'Name that Minor Character' especially when an old one reappears by surprise!\n\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nSeason 4, episode 15: This Year's Girl. Going through the first episode of two parts, the Buffy Straya gang is delighted to have Faith back (along with some other favourites, contractually obliged or otherwise). She is a breath of fresh air and so is this episode. Megan is too busy educating everyone on some very specific Australian military slang that she nearly misses this week's Name That Minor Character moment. The whole gang nearly missed another very important moment of the episode, but they thankfully catch it as you can hear by their very audible gasps...\n\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nGuess, who's back.. back again!\n\nAs usual we had a slightly longer hiatus than planned but we are back with Season 4, episode 14: Goodbye Iowa.\n\nOnce again Chris brings fresh perspective with his first watch eyes, Mabel has a Billie Eilish song playing in her head every time Adam is on screen, and Megan was till waiting for the episode to start 15 minutes in!\n\nSeason 4, episode 13: The I in Team. The Buffy Straya gang unanimously agree that this is the worst season 4 episode so far, but fortunately looking ahead there are still some gems to look forward to. This is basically an hour of Megan, Mabel, and Chris cringing at everything bad about the episode, and struggling to find quality quotes and wins. After laying into her performance, the unsurprising Name that Minor Character's history turns out to be very surprising and has the gang changing their tune a bit.\n\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nSeason 4, episode 12: New Man. Megan cannot Maths this episode and Chris hopes this quality of Buffy can last forever – but as Mabel points out this is one of the least rated seasons! Looks like there’s more good eps here then people give it credit for!\n\nMegan also devastates Chris with a major spoiler on the future of Ethan Rayne.. and it’s all Name That Minor Character’s fault. This episode our listeners get to peek behind the curtain as the team discuss whether or not to edit things out… and then don't!\n\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nSeason 4, episode 11: Doomed. The Buffy Straya gang rejoin Riley and Buffy right where they left things at the end of Hush, and Megan and Chris happily align themselves with #teamriley, though Megan gets a little too enthusiastic and potentially turns Chris off him. Mabel makes the profound observation that the Hellmouth is actually surprisingly similar to a hymen. A few holes a poked into the plot as usual, but this time we get a bit of behind the scenes insight into why the writers may have missed some details. Clearly the writing is still quite strong since Megan snuck in a few extra quotes as usual.\n\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nSeason 4, episode 10: Hush. The Buffy Straya gang enjoyed another Buffy MVP episode – so much that they talked about it for an hour and a half! Megan creates a fanfic backstory for the Gentlemen and shares details of her own creepy childhood nightmares. We get our longest Name That Minor Character segment ever, and it is well deserved. Shout out Doug Jones – Chris is your biggest fan! And Mabel rightly awards Hush the newly created, but highly coveted Buffy Straya make-up award.\n\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nSeason 4, episode 9: Something Blue. The whole Buffy Straya gang basically agrees that this is the best episode of Buffy to date. They have to resist the urge to just quote the whole episode from start to finish, which is very difficult as Megan is just reading the script in the background and laughing along while they're discussing the funniest scenes. We get some insight into Chris' adorable real life dating moves that parallel with none other than Riley Finn, while Mabel is still trying to forget the annoying high school boys from her past that kept calling her a mystery. We call out the shitty behaviour as we see it and get another Megan Moment highlighting the sad reality that Willow is facing in this episode that is all too common in real life.\n\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nAngel Season 4 Episode 8: I Will Remember You\n\nIt's a crossover episode! This week we are releasing our Angel episode on our regular podcast because... how could we not?!?!?!\n\nWe watched this one together too and enjoyed it MUCH more than the Buffy episode! This week the gang realise they shouldn’t watch episodes with sex scenes together cos it feels as awkward as watching it with your parents!\n\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nBuffy Season 4 Episode 8: Pangs\n\nThis... did not age well. And we talk about why.\n\nWe watched this one together and had much less fun than expected - though stay tuned for a special cross-over episode next week!\n\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nSeason 4, episode 7: The Initiative. Stop the presses... This week one of Chris's predictions was proven right?!?! Mabel and Megan couldn't believe how close he got to the truth on this one a few episodes ago. Meanwhile, Megan sneaks in a quote-a-thon, and briefly turns this into an iZombie podcast when Mabel reveals she's never heard of it.\n\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nSeason 4, episode 6: Wild at Heart. This week Megan forgot to watch the episode, which resulted in Mabel and Chris being forced to experience her feelings in real time as they went through the story... and there were many of them.. and they were intense. So just a usual episode of Buffy Straya really! Meanwhile everyone can agree that they aren't going to miss Veruca Salt!\n\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nSeason 4, episode 5: Beer Bad. Somehow despite the title, the Buffy Straya gang come out of this episode still liking beer. In contrast to the simple title, the episode actually turns out to be deceptively deep and leads Megan to sharing some pretty profound psychology wisdom with us, as well as drawing parallels to some other iconic Buffy moments.

This week Chris has finally seen the light and decided that Anya is a good character! As usual Megan has a powerful connection to a scene the other two can barely remember and Mabel discovers that star signs are like, actually a real thing….\n\nAlso stay tuned for a Chris prediction – spoiler alert – he is certain Riley is a secret spy!\n\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Twitter or Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nSeason Four, epsiode 3: The Harsh Light of Day. The Buffy Straya gang groan and rant about all of the annoying and frustrating things that happen in this episode. If this episode has also always infuriated you, listen along to us verbalising your frustrations. It ends up being a bit of a longer discussion this week as the gang touches on some pretty heavy topics including consent and the glorification of sexual violence in film and TV.\n\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Twitter or Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nSeason Four, epsiode 2: Living Conditions. The Buffy Straya gang continue to get used to college life as they get to know a lot more about Buffy's roommate from hell (or rather from one of many unnamed hell dimensions). Chris doesn't seem to be as annoyed as Buffy at her roommate's music taste and actually highly rates Believe by Cher. Megan and Mabel commend the episode for it's rewatchability and praise all of the red herrings and plot twists as they compare with Chris' notes and his fresh perspective.\n\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Twitter or Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nSeason 1, epsiode 1 of ANGEL: City of...\n\nWe are starting our long anticipated parallel podcast journey with ANGEL the TV series!\n\nStarting with Season 1, epsiode 1 \"City of...\" the pilot of Angel. Chris has had no idea what is coming and what this spinoff series is going to be about. If you have had mixed feelings about whether to watch Angel or not, or if it's been a while, now is the perfect time to revisit and start watching it alongside the Buffy Straya gang!\n\nWe will be sharing this first ep and any major crossover episodes with Buffy here on the main Buffy the Vampire Straya podcast, but if you want to follow us along our entire Angel journey episode by episode, check out our new PATREON for how you can access our exclusive Angel (and other upcoming) content.\n\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Twitter or Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nSeason Four, epsiode 1: The Freshman. We're back with Season 4! We go on a journey with Buffy and feel every bit of her Freshman experince - particularly Chris who is taking in a bunch of new characters and trying to figure out who's in it for the long haul and who's gonna be dead next week! And of course, we get the exciting cameo of this week's NTMC - Eddie aka Oberon Martell aka The Mandalorian - easily our mostest VIP in NTMC history! We also shrae our plans for Angel Content: Hear the first ep, right here on this podcast next week, but join us on our new PATREON (!) for future Angel content!\n\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Twitter or Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nSEASON THREE FINALE, episodes 21 and 22 - Graduation pt 1 & 2. We did it. We made it through high school guys! The Buffy Straya gang meet up in person for the first time in YEARS for a special group watch and in person recording session. (Unfortunately there were some audio issues which require some re-recording...). Mabel and Megan reminisce about playing hangman on the last day of school and to Mabel's disappointment, Chris is underwhelmed by the DVD CGI graphics.\n\n(Update: This is now the fixed version without the weird music!)\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Twitter or Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nThe Buffy 'Straya gang agree that we are in a sweet spot of Buffy watching with good episode after good episode, although Chris likes it more once he realises that it's not a response to America's gun violence but just poorly timed, and in fact had a delayed broadcast due to a famous school shooting. And of course, finally... it's time for another BUFFY JUMP! And Megan confesses that she watched this episode on her phone at the last minute, but finally saw a non-HD episode and remembered just how much better the visuals are pre-remaster.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Twitter or Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nSeason 3, Episode 17: Enemies. Chris is well and truly on board the Buffy train now and is noticing that season 3 is just banger after banger! Especially this one with the crazy plot twist. Megan and Mabel enjoyed living this episode vicariously through Chris since they already knew the twist. The gang continues to contemplate Faith's character development, and Mabel explains her latest theory on the black market for global demonic travel.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Twitter or Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nSeason 3, Episode 16: Doppelgangland. The Buffy Straya gang throw all restraint to the wind in this very quotable episode and basically do everything but recite the whole script verbatim. Everyone agrees the episode is great, but Chris's slightly milder reaction suggests this one might be EVEN better on the rewatch. The extra CGI in the episode doesn't do the HD version any favours and Mabel is extra thankful to be the only one in the gang still on the DVDs.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Twitter or Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nSeason 3, Episode 15: Consequences. Chris, Mabel and Megan all agree that Wesley is the worst this episode, although Megan and Mabel disagree with Chris that any of his or the council's actions are justified. Mabel and Chris guess this week's Name that Minor Character well in advance, noting it ticks two out of three of Megan's favourite boxes. And most importantly, THE GANG GET ANOTHER ANCHOR VOICE MESSAGE!!! Most exciting!\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Twitter or Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nSeason 3, Episode 14: Bad Girls. Chris, Mabel and Megan have mixed feelings about this episode with Mabel and Megan recalling their feelings when they first watched and how that differs now. Chris is disappointed that Megan didn't pick the right name that minor character this episode but she redeems herself when her choice is revealed. Megan also has some internet issues which cause a few momentary glitches!\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Twitter or Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nSeason 3, Episode 13 Zeppo. Chris almost had to take the lead in this one since he was noticing scenes (and even hairstyles!) better than Megan and Mabel, who both guiltily admitted they were a little checked out when watching the episode. It may have been a bit of a slow burn for those two rewatching the episode for the zillionth time, but the whole Buffy Straya gang came together to thoroughly enjoy the second half of the episode where it all starts to come together. Chris is shocked and speechless when it comes to what Faith does now that she's back, and Megan and Mabel end up choosing the same thing to win the episode. Can you guess what they chose?\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Twitter or Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nSeason 3, Episode 12 Helpless. The Buffy Straya gang bond over what they can all agree is a great episode. Chris struggles to identify the mysterious green liquid that Oz consumes at the start of the episode. The bad guy (or arguably the bad guy's weapon) looks terribly familiar to everyone, especially to Mabel, and thankfully Megan clears up why during 'Name that Minor Character'. The gang rush to wrap up this week's episode within a short timeframe but manage to squeeze everything in including a very time efficient Megan Moment.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Twitter or Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nSeason 3, Episode 11 Gingerbread. Once again, the Buffy Straya gang start out with divided feelings about this episode, though the split is exactly opposite to last episode. This time Mabel is the one who loves it while Megan and Chris need some convincing. After seeing Hansel and Gretel come to life, the gang speculates about what other fairytales might have demonic roots and come to some pretty affirmative conclusions.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Twitter or Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nSeason 3, Episode 10 Amends. 'Tis the season to be... haunted by the ghosts of your guilty past? The Buffy Straya gang start out mostly divided on this one, with Megan and Chris both loving the seasonal Christmas episode, and Mabel not really in the mood for it. Fortunately they all come together to agree that Sarah Michelle Gellar's fringe wasn't on anyone's wishlist. Megan manages to blow both Mabel AND Chris's mind with a fun fact about future seasons while cleverly avoiding any spoilers for Chris.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Twitter or Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nSeason 3, Episode 9 The Wish. The Buffy Straya gang marvels at the industrial ingenuity of The Master and his blood factory, although they agree that the execution of his vision was unfortunately inefficient as far as automation goes. Chris and Mabel disagree about the quality of alternate-Buffy's face scar, and Megan struggles to keep the conversation on track as Mabel insists on jumping back and forth all over the episode. Through the discussion Megan astutely draws profound connections between the theme of the episode and how it relates to Faith's storyline and absence in this episode.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Twitter or Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nSeason 3, Episode 8 Lover's Walk. After a slight organisational mishap, the Buffy Straya gang get together to re-record this episode one year after the first version, and after having already recorded the next episode. Fortunately, this is an episode they're more than happy to re-watch over and over, because there's no such thing as too much Spike! Chris gets his first taste of a Buffy episode the second time around, and Mabel and Megan continue to question their previous Bangel alliance. But seriously, can someone please explain to us dumb Australians how the SATs work?\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Twitter or Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nSeason 3, Episode 7 Revelations. Buckle in for a long one guys, because the Buffy Straya gang digress even more than usual in this one. They manage to get into a long debate about Angel vs. Angelus. No one wins the argument, but everyone learns a little from each other. Mabel works hard to get Megan to finally give Faith some well earned sympathy as the gang continues to practice having respectful conversations despite having vastly different opinions. When it comes to discussing the actual episode, the gang continues to groan a lot about Willow, Xander, and their B story that shall not be named. There are so so so many things that frustrate them in this episode that they just start praising how good the villain is.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Twitter or Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nWe interrupt your regularly (though not that regularly) scheduled programming to bring you this bonus episode. The Buffy Straya gang have gotten together to record for the first time in 2021. We catch you up a bit on where we've been, what we've been doing, and how excited we are to get back to podcasting. More importantly, we finally respond to all the lovely messages from our beautiful fans! Chris responds to our first ever voice message from a fan and goes into some quite detailed predictions about who he thinks will or won't die in Buffy.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Twitter or Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nIf you want to leave us your own voice message go to anchor.fm/buffystraya/message\n\nIf you'd like to hire Chris as your marriage celebrant: chrisceremonies.com\n\nSee Feedspot's top 25 vampire podcasts: https://blog.feedspot.com/vampire_podcasts/\n\nSeason 3, Episode 6 Band Candy. The gang is surprised to find that apparently the more they like an episode, the less they have to say about it! There aren't many rants about this well-loved episode, and Chris declares this is his new favourite ep so far. Aside from the unnecessary contractual David Boreanaz appearances written into the episode, and the unfortunate romantic storyline we can't bring ourselves to talk about anymore, we all agree this episode brings us extreme joy and classic unadulterated Buffy vibes.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Twitter or Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nSeason 3, Episode 5 Homecoming. The gang start out with an enthusiastic consensus that this is a brilliant episode all round, yet somehow still end up in extremely lengthy discussions about all the things that are terrible and/or make no sense. Just another classic day in the office for the Buffy Straya gang. Mabel makes an unlikely comparison to Dude Where's My Car that no one relates to, but is quickly vindicated by an on-the-spot Google image search. Chris is relieved that Megan has finally come around to some Faith appreciation.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Twitter or Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nSeason 3, Episode 4 Beauty and the Beasts. The Buffy Straya gang is in full agreement that this is a great episode and that Oz is a Scooby Gang treasure. Chris is grateful that Megan has recently been binge watching Scrubs which informed her favourite minor character, no one has much love for Scott Hope (or rather \"Scott Hopeless\" as Mabel calls him), and Megan expectedly drools over shirtless Angel a few times. Prepare for a fully justified Megan rant at how the episode addressed some sensitive topics.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Twitter or Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nSeason 3, Episode 1. Anne! Chris, Mabel and Megan are back with Season 3! With such a long time between drinks, Chris needs a few catch up moments to remind him where we left off in Season 2, Megan has switched to watching in HD on a streaming service which has definitely changed the experience and Mabel unintentionally takes on Megan's usual role of quoting all the good lines! The team revel in the many iconic Buffy moments on display in this episode. It's good to be back!\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Twitter or Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nSeason 2, Episode 22 Becoming, Part 2. Part two of the season finale starts off in tears after having just finished watching the last episode of season 2 together. Chris, Mabel, and Megan can't help but question the integrity of Sunnydale police force. As usual, there's no shortage of criticism for Xander even in the season finale. Megan tries to fight off her tears as she recalls the episode, but ultimately fails and has one of her signature heartfelt \"Megan Moments\".\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Twitter or Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nSeason 2, Episode 21 Becoming, Part 1. For the first of a two part season finale, Chris, Mabel, and Megan discuss the penultimate episode they just watched together before sitting down to watch part two. Chris sides with one of Xander's controversial opinions and predictably gets verbally attacked by Megan and Mabel for it. All three really struggle to redeem the many accents attempted in the show.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Twitter or Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nSeason 2, Episode 20 Go Fish. Chris, Mabel, and Megan try to make sense of the fishy plot and realise that some things just can't be explained... they do however crack the case for what was the coach's motives! Megan once again gives in to the pressure and goes for a double \"Name That Minor Character\" for the second episode in a row! Chris continues to compare everyone and everything to the brilliant character actor John Ritter, and to his disappointment, nothing quite seems to measure up.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Twitter or Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nSeason 2, Episode 19 I Only Have Eyes For You. Mabel, Megan, and Chris question some of Willow's dating advice in this episode. Chris and Megan butt heads over who should be the \"Name That Minor Character\" for this episode, who do you think wins in the end? Megan makes a hilarious mix-up over some technology for the Dewey Decimal System, Giles would not be impressed!\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Twitter or Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nI know we've said it before... but WE ARE BACK! Finally finishing off Season Two starting with Episode 18, Killed by Death. Chris, Mabel and Megan delight in the devilishly scary monster of this week, but can't agree on the quality of storytelling with Buffy's tacked on dead cousin B story. Stay tuned at the end for this week's blooper where Megan highlights her very clear lack of video game knowledge!\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Twitter or Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nAfter a little hiatus (AGAIN!) we are back with Season 2, Episode 17 Passion. Chris, Mabel and Megan farewell a favourite (?) - Jenny Calendar. The gang get protective of Sunshine the puppy dog and discuss Angel's epic (?) Passion speech... also Chris shares some exciting news on a recent guest spot on a much more famous podcast than this little one!\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Twitter or Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nIn Season 2, Episode 16 Chris, Mabel and Megan are joined once again by special guest Dave, who's opinions on Drusilla could lead to this being his last podcast! Meanwhile, Mabel creates a new word to accurately describe Harmony and is on the opposing side to Chris and Megan on whether Xander trying to cast a spell to get Cordy to love him is romantic.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Twitter or Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nIn Season 2, Episode 15 - Phases - Chris, Mabel and Megan are prompted to discuss first kisses and the first appearance of Buffy's \"stealth beanie\". Shockingly Chris actually recalls hearing the name of a director - unsurpsurisingly it's not Marti Noxon but Rob Des Hotel who managed to stick in his brain! And the werewolf hunter - a.k.a. Wolf-a-dial-Dundee will stick in all our minds forever, but not for the right reasons!\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Twitter or Instagram: @buffystraya\n\nThe gang have caved to fan pressure and released two episodes at once! Chris, Mabel and Megan talk Season 2, Epiosde 14 and, seriously... how GOOD is evil Angel. They also have possibly the longest Name that Minor Character segment yet, shout out to Death to Smoochy!\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.fb.me/buffystraya\n\nFollow us on Twitter or Instagram: @buffystraya"
