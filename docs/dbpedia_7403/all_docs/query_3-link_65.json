        "text": "\"They're still working on that,\" Parton tells Business Insider, though she did not specify who exactly is involved in the project. \"They're thinking about bringing it back and revamping it.\"\n\nParton's Sandollar Productions coproduced the original \"Buffy\" movie starring Kristy Swanson with Kuzui Enterprises, the production company cofounded by the movie's director, Fran Rubel Kuzui, and her husband Kaz Kuzui.\n\nThe production companies later teamed with \"Buffy\" creator Joss Whedon's Mutant Enemy Productions and 20th Century Fox Television (now simply 20th Television) on the popular TV series.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, Fran Rubel Kuzui first attempted to reboot \"Buffy\" with a new movie in 2009. However, fans of the show, and some of its cast members, criticized the project for not involving Whedon.\n\nIn 2018, Whedon and producer and screenwriter Monica Owusu-Breen collaborated on a proposed \"Buffy\" reboot with a Black lead, reported Deadline.\n\nThis time, the project received backlash from fans who assumed a Black actor would play Buffy. On X, formerly known as Twitter, Owusu-Breen suggested the reboot would introduce new characters.\n\n\"There is only one Buffy,\" she wrote.\n\nRelated stories\n\nAlthough plans for an on-screen reboot have yet to come to fruition, the world of \"Buffy\" has extended to other mediums.\n\nSeveral \"Buffy\" cast members reunited last year for an Audible series set after the events of the show, which concluded in 2003.\n\n\"Slayers: A Buffyverse Story\" picks up 10 years after the \"Buffy\" series finale and focuses on a new slayer, Indira (voiced by Laya DeLeon Hayes), and Buffy's former vampire lover, Spike (voiced by James Marsters).\n\nAnthony Head, Charisma Carpenter, Juliet Landau, Emma Caulfield, Amber Benson, James Charles Leary, and Danny Strong also reprised their roles from the TV series.\n\nSpeaking of the original series, Parton tells Business Insider that while she was \"very involved,\" the credit for the show's success is down to the people who worked on it every day.\n\nParton says she lived in Nashville when \"Buffy\" was filming in Los Angeles, so she didn't get to visit the set often.\n\n\"A lot of my work was done just conversing back and forth with the business people there,\" says the singer, who spoke to BI to promote her latest baking mixes with Duncan Hines and its parent company Conagra Brands.\n\n\"I have to give more people more credit on 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' than me. A lot of people did so much sweat on that,\" she adds. \"That little show did great.\""
