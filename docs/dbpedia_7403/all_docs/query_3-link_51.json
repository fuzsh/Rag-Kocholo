        "text": "It's been nearly 25 years since we last saw Buffy the Vampire Slayer on our screens, yet its feminist legacy still lives on in our hearts (and in meme form, naturally).\n\nBuffy, played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, showed millions of young people the importance of bravery, kindness, and err, slaying vampires. So obviously, we were delighted to discover that she's finally getting the reboot she deserves!\n\nAccording to Deadline, the supernatural drama is currently in development at Fox 21 TV Studios, and Monica Owusu-Breen (the creator of Midnight, Texas) has been tapped as the show's writer. It's also expected that Joss Whedon – who created the original show – will return as an executive producer, alongside Gail Berman, Fran Kazui and Kaz Kazui.\n\nRead More\n\nRoar starring Nicole Kidman is out now on Apple TV+ (and fans think it's absolutely bonkers)\n\nThe anthology series is an adaptation of Cecelia Ahern's 2018 short story collection of the same title.\n\nWithout further ado, here's everything we know about the Buffy the Vampire Slayer reboot:\n\nWhat will the Buffy the Vampire Slayer reboot be about?\n\nThere's precious little info about what direction Monica Owusu-Breen is planning to take the next incarnation of Buffy the Vampire Slayer in, so we're not sure whether she will stay faithful to the original or branch out a little further. She addressed the speculation in a tweet, saying:\n\n\"There is only one Buffy. One Xander, one Willow, Giles, Cordelia, Oz, Tara, Kendra, Faith, Spike, Angel… They can't be replaced. Joss Whedon's brilliant and beautiful series can't be replicated. I wouldn't try to.\n\n“But here we are, twenty years later… And the world seems a lot scarier. So maybe, it could be time to meet a new Slayer….”\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nAlthough the producers have been tight-lipped about the series, they did say (via Deadline), \"Like our world, it will be richly diverse, and like the original, some aspects of the series could be seen as metaphors for issues facing us all today.\"\n\nWho will star in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer reboot?\n\nSadly, the OG Buffy – AKA Sarah Michelle Gellar – has ruled out reprising the role. During an appearance on the On With Mario Lopez podcast in 2021, when asked if she'd ever return to the franchise, Sarah responded that she felt a \"wee bit, how do they say, long in the tooth for that,\" noting that an essential part of Buffy's character is that she's a teenager, as the monsters \"were a metaphor for the horrors of adolescence.\"\n\nShe continued: \"I do think that story lends itself, it'd be interesting to see how a chosen one would deal with that. I don't think it's me, I don't think I should be the one doing it,\" Sarah noted, confessing that she's \"way too tired and cranky to put in that work again.\"\n\nHowever, all is not lost, as SMG has endorsed Zendaya for the role. In an interview with Evan Ross Katz, the author of Into Every Generation a Slayer Is Born: How Buffy Staked Our Hearts, Sarah addressed who could play the iconic character, saying, \"I vote Zendaya.\" I mean, same?\n\nWill Joss Whedon be involved in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer reboot?\n\nJoss Whedon is the creator of the original Buffy the Vampire Slayer and is expected to return to the reboot as an executive producer. This has come as a surprise to some, given the allegations of mistreatment made against him by several ex-employees and colleagues.\n\nIn 2020, Ray Fisher and Gal Gadot, who starred in a film directed by Whedon, accused him of mistreating them, with Fisher describing his behaviour as “gross, abusive, unprofessional, and completely unacceptable.”\n\nThis was followed by accusations made by Charisma Carpenter, who played Cordelia in Buffy, who tweeted a statement saying Joss had a history of being “casually cruel,\" saying he “callously called [her] ”fat\" to colleagues when [she] was 4 months pregnant.\"\n\nNumerous actors from Buffy the Vampire Slayer publicly supported Charisma, including Sarah Michelle Gellar, who said in an Instagram post, “While I am proud to have my name associated with Buffy Summers, I don't want to be forever associated with the name Joss Whedon,\" adding that she stands “with all survivors of abuse and am proud of them for speaking out.”\n\nIn an interview with Vulture in January 2022, Whedon conceded he wasn't very “civilized” during filming, saying he “was young,” and “I yelled, and sometimes you had to yell. This was a very young cast, and it was easy for everything to turn into a cocktail party.” He added that he would never intentionally humiliate anyone: “If I am upsetting somebody, it will be a problem for me.”\n\nIs there a release date for the Buffy the Vampire Slayer reboot?\n\nSadly we haven't got a release date just yet. However, we'll keep this page updated as soon as we find out.\n\nIs there a trailer for the Buffy the Vampire Slayer reboot?\n\nThere's no trailer to speak of as it's still very early days. Instead, enjoy GLAMOUR's Unfiltered interview with Zendaya, who may (or may not be) our new Buffy in the making:\n\nFor more from Glamour UK's Lucy Morgan, follow her on Instagram @lucyalexxandra."
