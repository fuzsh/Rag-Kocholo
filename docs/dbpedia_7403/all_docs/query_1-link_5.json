Uh... (chuckles) Can I have you?\n\nBuffy: Uh, thanks.\n\nXander: I don't know you, do I?\n\nBuffy: I'm Buffy. I'm new.\n\nXander: Xander. Is-is me. Hi.\n\nBuffy: Oh, thanks.\n\nXander: Well, uh, maybe I'll see you around. Maybe at school... since we both... go there.\n\nBuffy: Great. It was nice to meet you. [walks away]\n\nXander: We both go to school. Very suave. Very not pathetic. Oh. Hey! Hey! You forgot your... stake.\n\nBuffy: Okay, what's the sitch?\n\nGiles: Sorry?\n\nBuffy: You heard about the dead guy, right? The dead guy in the locker?\n\nGiles: Yes.\n\nBuffy: 'Cause it's the weirdest thing. He's got two little-little holes in his neck and all his blood's been drained. Isn't that bizarre? Aren't you just going, \"Ooh\"?\n\nGiles: I was afraid of this.\n\nBuffy: Well, I wasn't. It's my first day. I was afraid that I was gonna be behind in all my classes, that I wouldn't make any friends, that I would have last month's hair. I didn't think there'd be vampires on campus. And I don't care.\n\nGiles: Then why are you here?\n\nBuffy: To tell you that, I don't care, which I don't, and have now told you, so... bye.\n\nGiles: Is he-- will he rise again?\n\nBuffy: Who?\n\nGiles: The boy.\n\nBuffy: No. He's just dead.\n\nGiles: Can you be sure?\n\nBuffy: [to Giles] To make you a vampire, they have to suck your blood, and then you have to suck their blood. It's like, a whole big sucking thing. Mostly they're just gonna kill you. Why am I still talking to you?\n\nGiles: You really have no idea what's going on, do you? You think it's coincidence, your being here? That boy was just the beginning.\n\nBuffy: Why can't you people just leave me alone?\n\nGiles: Because you are the Slayer. To each generation a Slayer is born. One girl in all the world, a Chosen One, one born with the strength--\n\nBuffy: The strength and skill to hunt the vampires, to stop the spread of the evil, blah, blah, blah. I've heard it, okay?\n\nGiles: I really don't understand this attitude. You-You've accepted your duty. You're slain vampires before?\n\nBuffy: Yeah, and I've both been there and done that, and I'm moving on.\n\nGiles: What do you know about this town?\n\nBuffy: It's 2 hours on the freeway from Neiman-Marcus.\n\nGiles: Dig a bit in the history of this place, and you'll find a-a steady stream of fairly off occurrences. I believe this whole area is a center of mystical energy, that things gravitate towards it that-that you might not find elsewhere.\n\nBuffy : Like vampires.\n\nGiles: Like zombies, werewolves, incubi, succubi, everything you've ever dreaded was under your bed but told yourself couldn't be by the light of day. They're all real.\n\nBuffy: What, you, like, sent away for the Time-Life series?\n\nGiles: Oh, w-well, yes.\n\nBuffy: Did you get the free phone?\n\nGiles: Um, the calendar.\n\nBuffy: Cool. Wait. Okay. First of all, I'm a Vampire Slayer. And secondly, I'm retired. Hey, I know. Why don't you kill them?\n\nGiles: I'm a Watcher. I-I haven't the skill.\n\nBuffy: Oh, come on. Stake through the heart, a little sunlight, it's like falling off a log.\n\nGiles: A slayer says, a watcher--\n\nBuffy: Watches?\n\nGiles: Yes, no. He... he trains her. He-he-he prepares her.\n\nBuffy: Prepares me for what? For getting kicked out of school? For losing all of my friends? For having to spend all of my time fighting for my life and never getting to tell anyone because I might endanger them? Go ahead. Prepare me. [sigh]\n\nGiles: Damn.\n\nXander: What?\n\nGiles: It's getting worse.\n\nBuffy: What's getting worse?\n\nGiles: The influx of the undead, the supernatural occurrences. It's been building for years. There's a reason why you're here and a reason why it's now.\n\nBuffy: Because now is the time my mom moved here.\n\nGiles: Something's coming. Something, something, something is-is gonna happen here. Soon.\n\nBuffy: Gee, can you vague that up for me?\n\nGiles: The signs, as far as I can tell, point to a crucial mystical upheaval very soon. Days. Possibly less.\n\nBuffy: Oh, come on. This is Sunnydale. How bad an evil can there be here?\n\nWillow: Well... when I'm with a boy I like, it's hard for me to say anything cool, or, or witty. Or at all. I-I can usually make a few vowel sounds, and then I have to go away.\n\nBuffy: It's not that bad.\n\nWillow: No, i-it is. I think boys are more interested in a girl who can talk.\n\nBuffy: You really haven't been dating lately.\n\nBuffy: [about the mausoleum] Well, this is nice. I-it's a little bare, but a dash of paint, a few throw pillows... call it home!\n\nDarla: Who the hell are you?\n\nBuffy: You mean there's actually someone in this town who doesn't know already? Whew, that's a relief! I'm telling you, having a secret identity in this town is a job of work.\n\nXander: Buffy, we bail now, right?\n\nThomas: Not yet!\n\nBuffy: Okay, first of all, what's with the outfit? Live in the now, okay? You look like DeBarge!\n\n[The vampires close in on Buffy. She turns to Darla.]\n\nBuffy: Now, we can do this the hard way, or... well, actually there's just the hard way.\n\nDarla: That's fine with me!\n\nBuffy: Are you sure? Now, this is not gonna be pretty. We're talking violence, strong language, adult content...\n\nGiles: For as long as there have been vampires, there has been the Slayer. One girl in all the world, a Chosen One...\n\nBuffy: He loves doing this part.\n\nGiles: Alright. The Slayer hunts vampires, Buffy is a Slayer, don't tell anyone. Well, I think that's all the vampire information you need.\n\nThe Master: A Slayer... Have you any proof?\n\nLuke: Only that she fought me and yet lives.\n\nThe Master: Very nearly proof enough. I can't remember the last time that happened.\n\nLuke: 1843. Madrid. He caught me sleeping.\n\nGiles: [To Willow] Well then help me in researching this Harvest affair. It seems to be some sort of preordained massacre. Rivers of blood, hell on Earth. Quite charmless. I'm a bit fuzzy, however, on the details. [about a computer] It may be that you can wrest some information from that dread machine. [everyone stares] That was a bit, um, British, wasn't it?\n\nBuffy: Welcome to the New World.\n\nXander: This is just too much. I mean, yesterday my life's like, 'Uh-oh, pop quiz.' Today it's 'Rain of Toads'.\n\nWillow: I know. And everyone else thinks it's just a normal day.\n\nXander: Nobody knows. It's like we've got this big secret.\n\nWillow: We do. That's what a secret is, when you know something other guys don't.\n\nBuffy: What exactly were you expecting?\n\nXander: I don't know. Something. I mean, the dead rose. We should have at least had an assembly.\n\nGiles: People have a tendency to rationalize what they can and forget what they can't.\n\nBuffy: Believe me, I've seen it happen.\n\nWillow: Well, I'll never forget it. None of it.\n\nGiles: Good. Next time you'll be prepared.\n\nXander: Next time?\n\nWillow: Next time is why?\n\nGiles: We prevented the master from freeing himself and opening the mouth of hell. That's not to say he's going to stop trying. I'd say the fun is just beginning.\n\nWillow: More vampires?\n\nGiles: Not just vampires. The next threat we face maybe something quite different.\n\nBuffy: I can hardly wait.\n\nGiles: We're at the center of a mystical convergence here. We may, in fact, stand between the earth and it's total destruction.\n\nBuffy: Well, I gotta look on the bright side. Maybe I can still get kicked out of school.\n\nXander: Oh, yeah. That's a plan, 'cause lots of schools aren't on Hellmouths.\n\nWillow: Maybe you could blow something up. They're really strict about that.\n\nBuffy: I was thinking of a more subtle approach, you know, like, excessive not studying.\n\nGiles: [to himself as the others are walking away] The Earth is doomed.\n\nGiles: This is madness. What could you have been thinking? You are the Slayer. Lives depend upon you. I make allowances for your youth, but I expect a certain amount of responsibility, instead of which you enslave yourself to this-this... cult?\n\n[Buffy is wearing a cheerleading outfit]\n\nBuffy: You don’t like the color?\n\nGiles: I don't... Do you, um... do you ignore everything I say, as-as a rule?\n\nBuffy: No. I believe that's your trick. I told you, I'm trying out for the cheerleading squad.\n\nGiles: You have a sacred birthright, Buffy. You were chosen to destroy vampires, not to... wave pom poms at people. And as the Watcher, I forbid it.\n\nBuffy: And you'll be stopping me how?\n\nGiles: Well, I... By appealing to your common sense, if such a creature exists.\n\nBuffy: I will still have time to fight the forces of evil, okay? I just... want to have a life. I want to do something normal. Something safe.\n\nGiles: Why should someone want to harm Cordelia?\n\nWillow: Maybe because they met her? Did I say that?\n\nWillow: You're the Slayer, and we're, like, the Slayerettes.\n\nXander: I laugh in the face of danger. Then I hide until it goes away.\n\nJoyce: Look what I found. It's my yearbook from junior year. [finds her picture] Oh, look. There I am.\n\nBuffy: Mom, I've accepted that you've had sex. I am not ready to know that you had Farrah hair.\n\nJoyce: This is Gidget hair. Don't they teach you anything in history?\n\nBuffy: Well, it's really cool, but I gotta book.\n\nJoyce: Well, I was thinking. I know the cheerleading thing didn't work out. Maybe you should think about joining the yearbook staff. I did it. It was a lot of fun.\n\nBuffy: Not really my tip, Mom.\n\nJoyce: I was photo editor. I got to be on every page. Made me look much more popular than I was.\n\nBuffy: And have you seen the kids that do yearbook? Nerds pick on them.\n\nJoyce: Some of the best times I had in school were working on the yearbook.\n\nBuffy: Well, this just in: I'm not you. I'm into my own thing.\n\nJoyce: Your own thing, whatever it is, got you kicked out of school, and he had to move here to find a decent school that would take you. Honey... Oh, great parenting form. A little shaky on the dismount.\n\nGiles: God, every day here is the same.\n\nBuffy: Bright, sunny, beautiful. However can we escape this torment?\n\nXander: It's funny how the Earth never opens up and swallows you when you want it to.\n\nGiles: This computer invasion that Willow's performing on the coroner's office... One assumes it is entirely legal?\n\nBuffy: [in unison] Of course.\n\nWillow: [in unison] Entirely.\n\nGiles: Right. Wasn't here. Didn't see it. Couldn't have stopped you.\n\nPrincipal Flutie: You were there. You saw Dr. Gregory, didn't you?\n\nBuffy: Um, you mean yesterday in the cafeteria when we found him--\n\nPrincipal Flutie: Don't say dead or decapitated or decomposing. I'd stay away from \"d\" words altogether, but you witnessed the event, so this way, please.\n\nBuffy: Oh, no. I'm gonna be late for biology.\n\nPrincipal Flutie: Extremely late. You have to see a counselor. Everyone who saw the body has to see a crisis counselor.\n\nBuffy: But I really don't--\n\nPrincipal Flutie: We all need help with our feelings, otherwise we bottle them up, and before you know it, powerful laxatives are involved. I really believe if we all reach out to one another, we can beat this thing. I'm always here if you need a hug, but not a real hug, because there's no touching in this school. We're sensitive to wrong touching.\n\nBuffy: But I really, really--\n\nPrincipal Flutie: No. You have to talk to a counselor and start to healing. You have to heal.\n\nBuffy: But, Mr. Flutie, I d--\n\nPrincipal Flutie: Heal.\n\nCordelia: I don't know what to say. It was really, I mean, one minute you're in your normal life, and then who's in the fridge? It really gets to you, a thing like that. It was... Let's just say I haven't been able to eat a thing since yesterday. I think I lost, like, 7.5 ounces, way swifter than that so-called diet that quack put me on. Oh, I'm not saying that we should kill a teacher every day, just so I can lose weight, I'm just saying when tragedy strikes, we have to look on the bright side, you know? Like, how even used Mercedes still have leather seats.\n\nThe Master: [reading from the writing of Aurelius] \"And there will be a time of crisis, of worlds hanging in the balance. And in this time shall come, The Anointed, the Master's Great Warrior. And the Slayer will not know him, will not stop him, and he will lead her into Hell.\" As it is written, so shall it be. \"Five will die, and from their ashes, The Anointed shall rise. The Brethren of Aurelius, shall greet him, and usher him to his immortal destiny.\" As it is written, so shall it be. \"And one of the Brethren shall go out hunting the night before and get himself killed, because he couldn't wait to finish his job before he ate.\" Oh, wait. [grabs one of the Brethren by the throat] That's not written anywhere. The Anointed will be my greatest weapon against the Slayer. If you fail to bring him to me, if you allow that girl to stop you... [throws the vampire into a coffin] Here endeth the lesson.\n\nGiles: [about Owen's book selection] Oh, Emily Dickinson.\n\nBuffy: We're both fans.\n\nGiles: Yes, she's quite a good poet. I mean for a...\n\nBuffy: [defensively] A girl?\n\nGiles: For an American.\n\nWillow: Buffy has a really important date.\n\nBuffy: Owen!\n\nGiles: All right, I-I'll just jump in my time machine, go back to the twelfth century and ask the vampires to postpone their ancient prophecy for a few days while you take in dinner and a show.\n\nBuffy: Okay, at this point you're abusing sarcasm.\n\nGiles: Well, you know what they say; ninety percent of the vampire slaying game is, is waiting.\n\nBuffy: You couldn't have told me that ninety percent ago?\n\nBuffy: If the apocalypse comes, beep me.\n\nXander: We just saw the zebras mating. Thank you, very exciting!\n\nWillow: It was like the Heimlich... with stripes!\n\nWillow: [to Xander] You remember, you fail math, you flunk out of school, you end up being the guy at the pizza place that sweeps the floor and says, \"Hey, kids, where's the cool parties this weekend?\" We've been through this.\n\nGiles: Xander's taken to teasing the less fortunate?\n\nBuffy: Uh-huh.\n\nGiles: And, there's been a noticeable change in both clothing and demeanor?\n\nBuffy: Yes.\n\nGiles: And, well, otherwise all his spare time is spent lounging about with imbeciles.\n\nBuffy: It's bad, isn't it?\n\nGiles: It's devastating. He's turned into a sixteen-year-old boy. Of course you'll have to kill him.\n\n[While researching in the library]\n\nBuffy: Wow. Apparently, Noah rejected the hyenas from the Ark because he thought they were an evil impure mixture of dogs and cats.\n\nWillow: Hyenas aren't well liked.\n\nBuffy: They do seem to be the schmoes of the animal kingdom.\n\nWillow: Why couldn't Xander be possessed by a puppy, or... or some ducks?\n\nWillow: I heard the vice principal's taking over until they can find a replacement.\n\nBuffy: Well, it shouldn't be too hard to find a new principal. Unless they ask what happened to the last one.\n\nXander: Okay, but I had nothing to do with that, right?\n\nBuffy: Right.\n\nWillow: You only ate the pig.\n\nXander: I ate a pig? It was he cooked and called bacon or... oh, my God, I ate a pig? I mean, the whole trichinosis issue aside, yuck.\n\nBuffy: Well, it wasn't really you.\n\nXander: Well, I remember going on the field trip, and then going down to the hyena house. And next thing, some guy's holding Willow, and he's got a knife.\n\nWillow: You saved my life.\n\nXander: Hey, nobody messes with my Willow.\n\nBuffy: This is definitely the superior Xander. Accept no substitutes.\n\nXander: I didn't do anything else, did I? Around you guys? Anything embarrassing?\n\nBuffy: Nah.\n\nWillow: Not at all.\n\nBuffy: Come on, we're gonna be late.\n\nWillow: See you at lunch.\n\nXander: Cool. Oh, hey? Going vegetarian, huh?\n\nGiles: I've been reading up on my, uh, animal possession, and I cannot find anything anywhere about... memory loss afterwards.\n\nXander: (chuckles) Did you tell them that?\n\nGiles: Your secret dies with me.\n\nXander: Shoot me, stuff me, mount me.\n\nWillow: [about Angel] So he is a good vampire? I mean on a scale of one to ten. Ten being someone who's killing and maiming every night, one being someone who's... not.\n\nXander: I know you have feelings for this guy, but it's not like you're in love with him, right? [Buffy looks away] You’re in love with a vampire?! What are you, outta your mind?\n\nCordelia: What?!?\n\nXander: [to Cordelia] Not 'vampire' ... [to Buffy] How could you love an umpire? Everyone hates 'em!\n\nAngel: Come on. Don't go soft on me now. A little wide.\n\nBuffy: Why? Why didn't you just attack me when you had the chance? Was it a joke? To make me feel for you and then... I've killed a lot of vampires. I've never hated one before.\n\nAngel: Feels good, doesn't it? Feels simple.\n\nBuffy: I invited you into my home, and then you attacked my family.\n\nAngel: Why not? I killed mine. I killed their friends... and their friends' children. For 100 years, I offered an ugly death to everyone I met. And I did it with a song in my heart.\n\nBuffy: What changed?\n\nAngel: Fed on a girl about your age. Beautiful. Dumb as a post, but a favorite among her clan.\n\nBuffy: Her clan?\n\nAngel: The Romany. Gypsies. The elders conjured the perfect punishment for me. They restored my soul.\n\nBuffy: What, they were all out of boils and blinding torment?\n\nAngel: When you become a vampire, the demon takes your body, but it doesn't get your soul. That's gone. No conscience, no remorse. It's an easy way to live. You have no idea what it's like to have done the things I'm done... and to care. I haven't fed on a living human being since that day.\n\nBuffy: So you started with my mom?\n\nAngel: I didn't bite her.\n\nBuffy: Then why didn't you say something?\n\nAngel: But I wanted to. I can walk like a man, but I'm not one. I wanted to kill you tonight.\n\nBuffy: Go ahead. Not as easy as it looks.\n\nDarla: Sure it is.\n\nDarla: Do you know what the saddest thing in the world is?\n\nBuffy: Bad hair on top of that outfit?\n\nDarla: To love someone who used to love you.\n\nBuffy: You guys were involved?\n\nDarla: For several generations.\n\nBuffy: Well, you've been around since Columbus. You are bound to pile up a few exes. You're older than him, right? Just between us girls, you are looking a little worn around the eyes.\n\nDarla: [about Angel] I made him. There was a time when we shared everything, wasn't there, Angelus? You had a chance to come home, to rule with me in the Master's court for 1,000 years. But you threw that away because of her. You love someone who hates us. You're sick, and you'll always be sick. And you'll always remember what it was like to watch her die. You don't think I came alone, do you?\n\nBuffy: I know I didn't.\n\nDarla: [chuckles] Scary. Scarier.\n\nGiles: I'm just going to stay and clean up a little. I'll be back in the Middle Ages.\n\nJenny: Did you ever leave?\n\nJenny: You kids really dig the library, don't you?\n\nBuffy: We're literary.\n\nXander: To read makes our speaking English good.\n\nXander: Are we over-reacting? He's in a computer, what can he do?\n\nBuffy: You mean besides convince a perfectly nice kid to try and kill me? I don't know. How about mess up all the medical equipment in the world?\n\nGiles: Randomize traffic signals.\n\nBuffy: Access launch codes for our nuclear missiles.\n\nGiles: Destroy the world's economy.\n\nBuffy: I think I pretty much capped it with that nuclear missile thing.\n\nGiles: ...Alright, yours was best.\n\n[keyboard clacking and computer beeping]\n\nGiles: [clears throat]\n\nJenny: Well, look who's here. Welcome to my world. You scared?\n\nGiles: I'm remaining calm, thank you. I just wanted to, uh, return this. I found it among the new books and naturally, I though of you.\n\nJenny: Cool. Thanks.\n\nGiles: Uh, well, I'll-I'll see you anon.\n\nJenny: Can't get out of here fast enough, can you?\n\nGiles: Truthfully, I'm even less anxious to be around computers than I used to be.\n\nJenny: Well, it was your book that started all the trouble, not a computer.\n\nGiles: [sighs]\n\nJenny: Honestly, what is it about them that bothers you so much?\n\nGiles: The smell.\n\nJenny: Computers don't smell, Rupert.\n\nGiles: I know. Smell is the most powerful trigger to the memory there is. A certain flower or a whiff of smoke can bring up experiences long forgotten. Books smell musty and-and rich. The knowledge gained from a computer is-is... it has no-no texture, no-no context. It's there and then it's gone. If it's to last, then the getting of knowledge should be, uh, tangible. It should be, um... smelly.\n\nJenny: Well, you really are an old-fashioned boy, aren't you?\n\nGiles: Well, I-I don't dangle a corkscrew from my ear.\n\nJenny: That's not where I dangle it.\n\nXander: We going to go to the Bronze tonight, we three?\n\nBuffy: It'll be fun.\n\nXander: Yeah. Willow, fun? Remember fun? That thing where you smile?\n\nWillow: Oh, I'm sorry, guys. I'm just thinking about...\n\nBuffy: Malcolm?\n\nWillow: Malcolm, Moloch, whatever he's called. The one boy that's really liked me, and he's a demon robot. What does that say about me?\n\nBuffy: It doesn't say anything about you.\n\nWillow: I mean, I thought I was really falling...\n\nBuffy: Hey, did you forget? The one boy I've had the hots for since I've moved here turned out to be a vampire.\n\nXander: Right. And the teacher I had a crush on: giant praying mantis.\n\nWillow: That's true.\n\nXander: Yeah, it's life on the Hellmouth.\n\nBuffy: Let's face it. None of us are ever going to have a happy, normal relationship.\n\nXander: We're doomed.\n\nWillow: Yeah.\n\n[They laugh, but it quickly stops as they look uneasy]\n\nGiles: He thought it would behoove me to have more contact with the students. I did try to explain that my vocational choice of librarian was a deliberate attempt to minimize said contact, but he would have none of it.\n\nPrincipal Snyder: My predecessor, Mr. Flutie, may have gone in for all that touchy-feely relating nonsense, but he was eaten. You're in my world now. And Sunnydale has touched and felt for the last time.\n\nSid (the dummy): [about his present condition] Let's just say there was me, there was a really mean demon, there was a curse, and the next thing I know, I'm not me any more. I'm sitting on some guy's knee, with his hand up my shirt.\n\n[Marc has tricked Giles into getting into a craftily disguised guillotine.]\n\nGiles: Shouldn't it be aimed at my neck?\n\nMarc: No, no this way your scalp gets sliced off and your brains just come pouring out.\n\nGiles: What exactly is the trick?\n\nMarc: What trick?\n\nBuffy: What about the whole \"it's a demon\" theory?\n\nGiles: I'm looking into that, but my investigation is somewhat... hampered by our life in the theater.\n\nBuffy: Uh, priority check, Giles? (holding up her hands) Talent show, murder.\n\nXander: Yeah, we can't do the talent show, it's unthinkable. I'm not able to think it!\n\nGiles: Principal Snyder is watching us all very closely. Now, if he chooses, he can make all our lives extremely difficult. A Slayer cannot afford that! We will find this murderer, but in the meantime... the show must go on.\n\nBuffy: This is so unfair.\n\nJoyce: You want to go to school?\n\nBuffy: Sure! Why not?\n\nJoyce: Okay. Good day to buy that lottery ticket.\n\nXander: Well, the Hellmouth, the center of mystical convergence, supernatural monsters: been there.\n\nBuffy: Little blasé there, aren't you?\n\nXander: I'm not worried. If there's something bad out there we'll find, you'll slay, we'll party!\n\nBuffy: Thanks for having confidence in me.\n\nXander: You da man, Buff!\n\nXander: Our dreams are coming true?\n\nGiles: Dreams? That would be a musical comedy version of this. Nightmares, our--our nightmares are coming true.\n\nThe Master: [to Buffy] What's the fun of burying someone if they're already dead?\n\nBuffy: Glad you showed up. You see, I'm having a really bad day.\n\nUgly Man: Lucky 19.\n\nBuffy: Scary. I'll tell you something, though. There are a lot of scarier thing than you. And I'm one of them.\n\n[The class is discussing 'The Merchant of Venice'.]\n\nMs. Miller: But has Shylock suffered? What's his place in Venice society?\n\nWillow: Well, everyone looked down on him.\n\nCordelia: That is such a twinkie defense. Shylock should get over himself. People who think their problems are so huge craze me. Like this time I sort of ran over this girl on her bike. It was the most traumatizing event of my life, and she's trying to make it about her leg! Like my pain meant nothing.\n\nPrincipal Snyder: There are no dead students here. This week.\n\nGiles: Buffy told me you don't feed from humans anymore.\n\nAngel: Not for a long while.\n\nGiles: Is that why you're here? To see her?\n\nAngel: I can't. It's, uh... It's too hard for me to be around her.\n\nGiles: A vampire in love with a Slayer. It's rather poetic... in a maudlin sort of way.\n\nWillow: 'Have a nice summer', 'Have a nice summer'. This girl had no friends at all.\n\nGiles: Once again I teeter at the precipice of the generational gap.\n\nBuffy: 'Have a nice summer' is what you write when you have nothing to say.\n\nXander: It's the kiss of death.\n\nCordelia: So, are you saying she's invisible because she's so unpopular?\n\nBuffy: That about sums it up.\n\nCordelia: Bummer for her. It's awful to feel that lonely.\n\nBuffy: Hmm. So you've read something about the feeling?\n\nCordelia: Hey! You think I'm never lonely because I'm so cute and popular? I can be surrounded by people and be completely alone. It's not like any of them really know me. I don't even know if they like me half the time. People just want to be in a popular zone. Sometimes when I talk, everyone's so busy agreeing with me, they don't hear a word I say.\n\nBuffy: Well, if you feel so alone, then why do you work so hard at being popular?\n\nCordelia: Well, it beats being alone all by yourself.\n\nBuffy: Giles, you're not gonna believe this.\n\nGiles: It's clear, it's what's gonna happen. It's happening now.\n\nBuffy: Angel?\n\nAngel: It can't be. You've-you've gotta be wrong.\n\nGiles: I've checked it against all my other volumes. It's very real.\n\nAngel: [about the prophecy] Well, there's gotta be some way around it.\n\nGiles: Listen, some prophecies are a bit dodgy. They're-they're mutable. Buffy herself has-has thwarted them time and time again, but this is the Codex. There is nothing in it that does not come to pass.\n\nAngel: Then you're reading it wrong.\n\nGiles: I wish to God I were, but it's very plain. Tomorrow night, Buffy will face the Master, and she will die.\n\nAngel: Well, have you verified the text?\n\nBuffy: [laughing and about the prophecy in which she will die] So that's it, huh? I remember the drill. One Slayer dies, next one's called. Wonder who she is? Will you train her... or will they send someone else?\n\nGiles: Buffy, I...\n\nBuffy: [whimpering] Does it say how he's gonna kill me? Do you think it'll hurt? [as Angel steps close to her] Don't touch me! Were you even gonna tell me?\n\nGiles: I was hoping I wouldn't have to, that there was some way around it.\n\nBuffy: I've got a way around it. I quit.\n\nAngel: It's not that simple.\n\nBuffy: I'm making it that simple. I quit. I resign, I-I'm fired. You can find someone else to stop The Master from taking over.\n\nGiles: I'm not sure that anyone else can. All the... the signs indicate...\n\nBuffy: [enraged, throwing books at Giles] The signs? Read me the signs! Tell me my fortune! You're so useful, sitting here with all of your books! You're really a lot of help!\n\nGiles: No, I don't suppose I am.\n\nAngel: I know this is hard.\n\nBuffy: What do you know about this? You're never gonna die.\n\nAngel: You think I want anything to happen to you? Do you think I could stand it? We just gotta figure out a way...\n\nBuffy: I already did. I quit, remember? Pay attention!\n\nGiles: Buffy, if the Master rises...\n\nBuffy: I don't care! I don't care. Giles, I'm 16 years old. I... I don't wanna die.\n\nThe Master: Yes. Come forth, my child. Come into my world.\n\nBuffy: I don't think it's yours just yet.\n\nThe Master: You're dead.\n\nBuffy: I may be dead, but I'm still pretty. Which is more than I can say for you.\n\nThe Master: You were destined to die. It was written.\n\nBuffy: What can I say? I flunked the written.\n\nThe Master: Come here.\n\nThe Master: Where are your jibes now? Will you laugh when my Hell is on Earth?\n\nBuffy: You're that amped about Hell? Go there.\n\nGiles: The vampires?\n\nCordelia: Gone.\n\nAngel: The Master?\n\nGiles: Dead. The Hellmouth is closed. Buffy? Buffy?\n\nBuffy: Um, sorry. It's just... been a really weird day.\n\nXander: Yeah. Buffy died and everything.\n\nWillow: Wow. Harsh.\n\nGiles: I should've known that wouldn't stop you.\n\nJenny: Well, what do we do now?\n\nGiles: I don't know about the rest of you, but I'd like to get out of this place. I don't like the library very much anymore.\n\nXander: Hey, I hear there's a dance at the Bronze tonight. Could be fun.\n\nCordelia: Yeah.\n\nWillow: Buffy?\n\nBuffy: Sure. We saved the world. I say we party. I mean, I got all pretty.\n\nJenny: What about him?\n\nBuffy: He's not going anywhere. Loser.\n\nGiles: I'm not dancing, though.\n\nJenny: We'll see. You can come with us, though.\n\nXander: So, what's the story with the car?\n\nCordelia: Oh, that was me.\n\nBuffy: I'm really, really hungry.\n\nWillow: [laughing]\n\nAngel: By the way, I really like your dress.\n\nBuffy: Yeah, yeah. It's a big hit with everyone.\n\nCordelia: Oh, look, it's the Three Musketeers.\n\n[The others look at each other.]\n\nBuffy: [to Xander] Was that an insult?\n\nXander: Kinda lacked punch.\n\nWillow: The Three Musketeers were cool.\n\nCordelia: I see your point.\n\nXander: I woulda gone with Stooges.\n\nCordelia: Well, I just meant that you guys always hang out together. So, did you guys fight any demons this summer?\n\nWillow: Uh, yes! Our own personal demons.\n\nXander: Uh, such as, as, as lust and, uh, thrift!\n\nBuffy: I would have to go with Stooges also.\n\nCordelia: Buffy. You're really campaigning for bitch-of-the-year, aren't you?\n\nBuffy: As defending champion, you nervous?\n\nCordelia: [scoffs] I can hold my own. You know, we've never really been close, which is good, 'cause I don't really like you that much. But you have been known to save the world on occasion, so I'm going to give you a piece of advice.\n\nBuffy: Which is?\n\nCordelia: Get over it.\n\nBuffy: Excuse me?\n\nCordelia: Whatever is causing the Joan Collins 'tude, deal with it. Embrace the pain, spank your inner moppet, whatever, but get over it. 'Cause pretty soon you're not even gonna have the loser friends you've got now.\n\nWillow: She's possessed!\n\nGiles: Possessed?\n\nWillow: That's the only explanation that makes any sense. I mean, you should've seen her last night. That wasn't Buffy.\n\nXander: Are we overlooking the idea that she may be very attracted to me? [gets looks from the others and concedes] She's possessed.\n\nGiles: Possessed by what?\n\nWillow: Aaaaa possessing thing!\n\nGiles: [sarcastically] Well, that narrows it down.\n\nXander: Well, you're the expert. Hey, maybe when the Master killed her some... mystical bad guy transference thing happened.\n\nWillow: That's what it was! I mean, why else would she be acting like such a b-i-t-c-h?\n\nGiles: Willow, I think we're all a little too old to be spelling things out.\n\nXander: A bitcuh?\n\nXander: Buffy. Buffy! We got to do something now.\n\nBuffy. You two get the others out of here.\n\nAngel: We need to distract the vampires.\n\nBuffy: Right.\n\nXander: What are you gonna do?\n\nBuffy: I'm going to kill them all. That ought to distract them.\n\nCordelia: What an ordeal. And you know what the worst part is?\n\nJenny: Hmm?\n\nCordelia: It stays with you forever. No matter what they tell you, none of that rust and blood and grime comes out. I mean, you can dry-clean till Judgment Day, you are living with those stains.\n\nJenny: Yeah, that's the worst part of being hung upside down by a vampire who wants to slit your throat-- the stains.\n\nCordelia: I hear you.\n\nBuffy: Are you jealous?\n\nAngel: [laughs] Of Xander? Please. He's just a kid.\n\nBuffy: Is it 'cause I danced with him?\n\nAngel: Danced with is a pretty loose term. Mated with might be a little closer.\n\nBuffy: Don't you think you're being a little unfair? It was one little dance, which I only did to make you crazy, by the way. Behold my success.\n\nAngel: I am not jealous.\n\nBuffy: You're not jealous? What, vampires don't get jealous?\n\nAngel: See? Whenever we fight you always bring up the vampire thing.\n\nXander: [digging in the grave yard as the girls watch] Y'know, this might go a lot faster if you femmes actually picked up a shovel, too.\n\nGiles: [stopping, almost breathless] Hear, hear.\n\nBuffy: Sorry, but I'm an old-fashioned gal. I was raised to believe that men dig up the corpses and the women have the babies.\n\nBuffy: I don't get it. Why would anybody wanna make a girl?\n\nXander: [bitterly] You mean when there's so many pre-made ones just laying around? The things we do for love.\n\nBuffy: Love has nothing to do with this.\n\nXander: Maybe not, but I'll tell you this: people don't fall in love with what's right in front of them. People want the dream. What they can't have. The more unattainable, the more attractive.\n\nXander: Well, I guess that makes it official. Everybody's paired off. The vampires get dates. Hell, even the school librarian sees more action than me. You ever think that the world's a giant game of musical chairs, and the music's stopped and we're the only ones who don't have a chair?\n\nWillow: All the time.\n\nCordelia: Xander, I just wanted to thank you for saving my life. What you did in there was really brave and heroic, and I just wanted to tell you if there was anything that I could ever do to...\n\nXander: Do you mind? We're talking here. [Cordelia is taken aback, rolls her eyes and leaves] So where were we?\n\nWillow: Wondering why we never get dates.\n\nXander: Yeah. So why do you think that is?\n\nBuffy: God, the whole thing was so creepy. At the same time, I mean, he did do it all for his brother.\n\nAngel: Sounds like he took it a little over the edge.\n\nBuffy: Love makes you do the wacky.\n\nAngel: What?\n\nBuffy: Crazy stuff.\n\nAngel: Oh. Crazy, like a 241-year-old being jealous of a high school junior?\n\nBuffy: Are you 'fessing up?\n\nAngel: I thought about it. Maybe it bothers me a little.\n\nBuffy: I don't love Xander.\n\nAngel: Yeah, but he's in your life. He gets to be there when I can't. Take your classes, eat your meals. Hear your jokes and complaints. He gets to see you in the sunlight.\n\nBuffy: I don't look that good in direct light.\n\nAngel: It'll be morning soon.\n\nBuffy: I should probably go. I could walk you home.\n\n\"Big Ugly\": This weekend, the night of St. Vigeous, our power shall be at its peak. When I kill her, it'll be the greatest event since the crucifixion. And I should know. I was there.\n\nSpike: You were there? Please! If every vampire who said he was at the crucifixion actually was there, it would've been like Woodstock.\n\n\"Big Ugly\": I oughta rip your throat out.\n\nSpike: I was actually at Woodstock. That was a weird gig. I fed off a flower person, and then I spent the next six hours watching my hand move...\n\n[\"Big Ugly\" rushes at Spike, who punches him out without even looking]\n\nSpike: [to the Anointed One] So, who do you kill for fun around here?\n\nThe Anointed One: Who are you?\n\nSpike: Spike. You're that Anointed guy. I read about you. You've got Slayer problems. That's a bad piece of luck. Do you know what I find works real good with Slayers? Killing them.\n\nThe Anointed One: Can you?\n\nSpike: [glancing at \"Big Ugly\"] A lot faster than Nancy-boy there. Yeah, I did a couple Slayers in my time. I don't like to brag... [scoffs] Who am I kidding? I love to brag!\n\nBuffy: We were at the Bronze before. Thought you said you might show.\n\nAngel: You said you weren't sure if you were going.\n\nBuffy: I was being cool. C'mon, you've been dating for, what, like, two hundred years? You don't know what a girl means when she says maybe she'll show?\n\nWillow: Wow. Two centuries of dating. If you only had two a year, that's still like 400 dates with 400 different... [awkward beat.] Why do they call it a mace?\n\nAngel: I taught you to always guard your perimeter. [tuts] You should have someone out there.\n\nSpike: I did. I'm surrounded by idiots. What's new with you?\n\nAngel: Everything.\n\nSpike: Yeah. Come up against this slayer yet?\n\nAngel: She's cute. Not too bright, though. Gave her the puppy dog \"I'm all tortured\" act. Keeps her off my back when I feed.\n\nSpike: People still fall for that Anne Rice routine? What a world!\n\nXander: [to Angel] I knew you were lying. Undead liar guy.\n\nSpike: You think you can fool me?! You were my sire, man! You were my... Yoda!\n\nAngel: Things change.\n\nSpike: Not us! Not demons! Man, I can't believe this. You Uncle Tom! Come on people! This isn't a spectator sport!\n\nSpike: [holding a pole] Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of a nice ripe [turns to see Buffy, holding an axe] ...girl.\n\nBuffy: Do we really need weapons for this?\n\nSpike: I just like them, they make me feel all manly.\n\n[They both drop their weapons]\n\nSpike: The last Slayer I killed - she begged for her life. You don't strike me as the begging kind.\n\nBuffy: You shouldn't have come here.\n\nSpike: No. I've messed up your doilies and stuff. But I just got so bored! I'll tell you what. As a personal favor from me to you, I'll make it quick. It won't hurt a bit.\n\nBuffy: No, Spike. It's gonna hurt a lot.\n\nGiles: You have responsibilities that other girls do not.\n\nBuffy: Oh! I know this one! Slaying entails certain sacrifices, blah blah biddy blah, I'm so stuffy, give me a scone.\n\nGiles: It's as if you know me.\n\nDevon MacLeish: What does a girl have to do to impress you?\n\nOz: Well, it involves a feather boa and the theme to A Summer Place. I can't discuss it here.\n\nDevon: You're too picky, man. Do you know how many girls you could have? You're lead guitar, Oz. It's currency!\n\nOz: I'm not picky. You're just impressed by any pretty girl that can walk and talk.\n\nDevon: She doesn't have to talk.\n\nAmpata: Buffy, I do not have any lipstick.\n\nBuffy: Oh, you can borrow one of mine. There should be some on the desk.\n\nAmpata: What is that?\n\nBuffy: The station sent the rest of your stuff.\n\nAmpata: Oh, of-of course. I-I forgot all about it. I will unpack it later.\n\nBuffy: No worries. I can do it.\n\nAmpata: But you must get ready for the dance.\n\nBuffy: I'm not going.\n\nAmpata: Why not?\n\nBuffy: I have work to do, Crime Club work. It's really nothing for you to worry about.\n\nAmpata: Oh, I am not worried, thanks to Xander.\n\nBuffy: He seems very happy around you.\n\nAmpata: I am happy, too. Mmm, this one?\n\nBuffy: Oh, no, that clashes. There should be a gold one in there somewhere.\n\nAmpata: Thank you. You're always thinking of others before yourself. You remind me of someone from very long ago, the Inca Princess.\n\nBuffy: Cool. A princess.\n\nAmpata: They told her that she was the only one, that only she could defend her people from the netherworld. Out of all the girls in her generation, she was the only one--\n\nBuffy: Chosen.\n\nAmpata: You know the story?\n\nBuffy: It's fairly familiar.\n\nAmpata: She was 16, like us. She was offered as a sacrifice and went to her death. Who knows what she had to give up to fulfill her duty to others? What chance at love?\n\nBuffy: Who knows? I'll just unpack the rest of your stuff for you.\n\nAmpata: No, really, let me.\n\nBuffy: Oh! That's Xander and Willow. I'll get it.\n\nXander: Okay, I have something to tell you. And it's kind of a secret, and it's, um, a little bit scary. I like you. A lot. And I want you to go to with me the dance.\n\nAmpata: [laughs] Why was that so scary?\n\nXander: Well, because you never know if a girl's gonna say 'yes', or if... she's gonna laugh in your face and pull out your still beating heart and crush it into the ground with her heel.\n\nAmpata: Hmm. Then you are very courageous.\n\nXander: I'm really the fun, talking guy today, huh? Sorry.\n\nBuffy: That's okay. We don't have to talk.\n\nXander: I just, present company excluded, I have the worst taste in women of anyone in the world, ever.\n\nBuffy: Ampata wasn't evil. At least not to begin with. And... I-I do think she cared about you.\n\nXander: Yeah, but I think that whole sucking the life out of people thing would have been a strain on the relationship.\n\nBuffy: She was gypped. She was just a girl, and she had her life taken away from her. I remember how I felt when I heard the prophecy that I was gonna die. I wasn't exactly obsessed with doing the right thing.\n\nXander: Yeah, but you did. You gave up your life.\n\nBuffy: I had you to bring me back.\n\nAngel: There's blood on it.\n\nBuffy: Hi. It's nice to... blood?\n\nAngel: I can smell it.\n\nBuffy: Oh. It's pretty thin. It probably belonged to a girl.\n\nAngel: Probably.\n\nBuffy: [chuckles] I was just... thinking, wouldn't it be funny sometime to see each other when it wasn't a blood thing. Not funny \"ha-ha.\"\n\nAngel: What are you saying, you want to have a date?\n\nBuffy: No.\n\nAngel: You don't want to have a date?\n\nBuffy: Who said \"date\"? I-I never said \"date\".\n\nAngel: Right. You just want to have coffee or something.\n\nBuffy: Coffee?\n\nAngel: I knew this was gonna happen.\n\nBuffy: What? What do you think is happening?\n\nAngel: You're 16 years old, I'm 241.\n\nBuffy: I've done the math.\n\nAngel: You don't know what you're doing, you don't know what you want.\n\nBuffy: Oh, no, I-I think I do. I want out of this conversation.\n\nAngel: Listen, if we date, you and I both know one thing's gonna lead to another.\n\nBuffy: One thing already has led to another. You think it's a little late to be reading me a warning label?\n\nAngel: I'm just trying to protect you. This could get out of control.\n\nBuffy: Isn't that the way it's supposed to be? (gasps)\n\nAngel: [grabs her roughly] This isn't some fairytale. When I kiss you, you don't wake up from a deep sleep and live happily ever after.\n\nBuffy: No. When you kiss me, I want to die.\n\nBuffy: Well, say it.\n\nXander: I'm not gonna say it.\n\nWillow: You lied to Giles.\n\nXander: 'Cause she will.\n\nBuffy: I wasn't lying. I was just... protecting him from information that he wouldn't be able to... digest properly.\n\nXander: Like a corn dog.\n\nWillow: Like you don't have a sick mother, but you'd rather go to a frat party where there's gonna be drinking and older guys and probably an orgy.\n\nXander: Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho, rewind. Since when do they have orgies, and why aren't I on the mailing list?\n\nBuffy: There's no orgies!\n\nBuffy: Angel barely says two words to me.\n\nXander: Don't you hate that?\n\nBuffy: And when he does, he treats me like I'm a child.\n\nXander: That bastard!\n\nBuffy: You know, at least Tom can carry on a conversation.\n\nXander: Yeah! [pause] Tom? Who's Tom?\n\nWillow: The frat guy.\n\nXander: Oh, Buffy, I don't think so. Frying pan, fire? You know what I'm sayin'?\n\nGiles: She lied to me?\n\nWillow: Well...\n\nAngel: Did... she have a date?\n\nWillow: [to Angel] Well, why do you think she went to that party? Because you gave her the brush-off! [to Giles] And you never let her do anything except work and patrol! And I know she's the Chosen One, but you're killing her with the pressure! I mean, she's sixteen going on forty! [to Angel] And you! I mean, you're gonna live forever! You don't have time for a cup of coffee?? [Awkward beat] Okay, I don't feel better now, and we've got to help Buffy.\n\nCordelia: You did it. You saved us. I've never been so happy to see anyone in my whole. You guys. I just... hate you guys. The weirdest things always happen when you around. And you, you're going to jail for 15,000 years.\n\nBuffy: I told one lie. I had one drink.\n\nGiles: Yes, and you were very nearly devoured by a giant demon snake. The words \"let that be a lesson\" are a tad redundant at this juncture.\n\nBuffy: I'm sorry.\n\nGiles: So am I. I... I drive you too hard because I know what you have to face. From now on, no-no more pushing, no more prodding. Just, um, an inordinate amount of nudging.\n\nWillow: It's too bad we can't sneak a look at the Watcher Diaries and read up on Angel. I'm sure it's full of fun facts to know and tell.\n\nBuffy: Yeah. It's too bad. That stuff is private.\n\nWillow: Also Giles keeps them in his office. In his personal files.\n\nBuffy: Most importantly, it would be wrong.\n\n[cut to Willow and Buffy sneaking into the library]\n\nBuffy: Angel's a vampire, I thought you knew.\n\nCordelia: Oh, he's a vampire! Of course! But the cuddly kind, like a Care Bear with fangs.\n\nWillow: It's true.\n\nCordelia: You know what I think? I just think you're trying to scare me off 'cause you're afraid of the competition. Look, Buffy, you may be hot stuff when it comes to demonology or whatever, but when it comes to dating, I'm the Slayer.\n\n[Buffy admonishes Willow on her choice of a boring ghost costume.]\n\nBuffy: It's just ... You're never gonna get noticed if you keep hiding! You're missing the whole point of Halloween.\n\nWillow: Free candy?\n\nBuffy: It's \"come as you aren't\" night! The perfect chance for a girl to get sexy and wild, with no repercussions.\n\nWillow: Oh, I don't get wild. Wild on me equals spaz.\n\nDrusilla: Do you love my insides? The parts you can't see?\n\nSpike: Eyeballs to entrails, my sweet.\n\nBuffy: Ta da. Just little old 20th-century me.\n\nAngel: Sure you're okay?\n\nBuffy: I'll live.\n\nAngel: I don't get it, Buffy. Why'd you think I'd like you better dressed that way?\n\nBuffy: I just wanted to be a real girl for once. The kind of fancy girl you liked when you were my age.\n\nAngel: Oh, ho.\n\nBuffy: What?\n\nAngel: I hated the girls back then. Especially the noblewomen.\n\nBuffy: You did.\n\nAngel: They were just incredibly dull. Simpering morons, the lot of them. I always wished I could meet someone ... exciting. Interesting.\n\nBuffy: Really? Interesting how?\n\nAngel: You know how.\n\nBuffy: Still, I had a really hard day. You should probably tell me.\n\nAngel: You're right. I should.\n\nBuffy: Definitely.\n\nCordelia: I just don't see why everyone's always picking on Marie Antoinette. I can so relate to her. She worked really hard to look that good, and people just don't appreciate that kind of effort. And I know the peasants were all depressed ...\n\nXander: I think you mean oppressed.\n\nCordelia: Whatever. They were cranky. So they're like, \"Let's lose some heads.\" Uh! That's fair. And Marie-Antoinette cared about them. She was gonna let them have cake!\n\nWillow: Uh, Angel? If I say something you really don't want to hear, do you promise not to bite me?\n\nAngel: Are you going to tell me that I'm jealous?\n\nWillow: Well, you do sometimes get that way.\n\nAngel: You know, I never used to. Things used to be pretty simple. A hundred years, just hanging out, feeling guilty ... I really honed my brooding skills. Then she comes along. Yeah, I get jealous. But I know people. And my gut tells me this is a wrong guy.\n\nAngel: Do you love me?\n\nBuffy: What?\n\nAngel: Do you?\n\nBuffy: I love you. I don't know if I trust you.\n\nAngel: Maybe you shouldn't do either.\n\nBuffy: Maybe I'm the one who should decide!\n\nAngel: I did a lot of unconscionable things when I became a vampire. Drusilla was the worst. She was ... an obsession of mine. She was pure, and sweet, and chaste.\n\nBuffy: And you made her a vampire.\n\nAngel: First I made her insane. Killed everybody she loved. Visited every mental torture on her I could devise. She eventually fled to a convent, and on the day she took her holy orders, I turned her into a demon.\n\nBuffy: Well. I asked for the truth.\n\nFord: I'm sorry, Summers. Did I screw up your righteous anger riff? Does the nest of tumors liquefying my brain kinda spoil the fun?\n\nBuffy: I'm sorry. I had no idea. But what you're doing is still very wrong.\n\nFord: Okay, well, you try vomiting for twenty-four hours straight because the pain in your head is so intense, and then we'll discuss the concept of right and wrong. These people are sheep. They're wanna be vampires 'cause they're lonely, miserable or bored. I don't have a choice.\n\nBuffy: You have a choice. You don't have a good choice, but you have a choice. You're opting for mass murder here, and nothing you say is gonna make that okay.\n\nFord: You think I need to justify myself to you?\n\nBuffy: I think this is all part of your little fantasy drama. Isn't this exactly how you imagined it? You tell me how you've suffered and I feel sorry for you. Well, I do feel sorry for you, and if those vampires come in here and start feeding, I'll kill you myself.\n\nFord: You know what, Summers? I really did miss you.\n\nBuffy: I don't know what I'm supposed to say.\n\nGiles: You needn't say anything.\n\nBuffy: It'd be simpler if I could just hate him. I think he wanted me to. I think it made it easier for him to be the villain of the piece. Really, he was just scared.\n\nGiles: Yes, I suppose he was.\n\nBuffy: Nothing's ever simple anymore. I'm constanly trying to work it out. Who to love or hate. Who to trust. And it's just, like, the more I know the more confused I get.\n\nGiles: I believe that's called growing up.\n\nBuffy: I'd like to stop then, okay?\n\nGiles: I know the feeling.\n\nBuffy: Does it ever get easy?\n\n[Ford rises from the ground and attacks Buffy, she stakes him]\n\nGiles: You mean life?\n\nBuffy: Yeah. Does it get easy?\n\nGiles: What do you want me to say?\n\nBuffy: Lie to me.\n\nGiles: Yes, it's terribly simple. The good guys are always stalwart and true. The bad guys are easily distinguished by their pointy horns or black hats. And, uh, we always defeat them and save the day. No one ever dies, and everybody lives happily ever after.\n\nBuffy: Liar.\n\nXander: Giles lived for school. He's actually still bitter that there are only twelve grades.\n\nBuffy: He probably sat in math class thinking, \"There should be more math. This could be mathier.\"\n\nGiles: Um, a medical transport is delivering the monthly supply of blood to the hospital.\n\nBuffy: Mm. Vampire Meals-On-Wheels.\n\nEthan Rayne: Well we can't run. Eyghon will find us. This mark's like a homing beacon.\n\nBuffy: It's okay. I'm not much into running.\n\nEthan Rayne: Aren't we manly?\n\nBuffy: One of us is.\n\nEthan Rayne: If you think of it karmically this is, this is really big for your soul. You know, taking my place with the demon. Giving, so that others may live.\n\nBuffy: I'm gonna kill you. Will that blow the whole karma thing?\n\nBuffy: I'm not gonna lie to you. It was scary. I'm so used to you being a grownup, and then I find out that you're a person.\n\nGiles: Most grownups are.\n\nXander: \"Are you a people person, or do you prefer keeping your own company?\" Well, what if I'm a people person who keeps his own company by default?\n\nBuffy: So, mark \"none of the above\".\n\nXander: Well, there are no boxes for \"none of the above\". That would introduce too many variables into their mushroom head, number-crunching little world.\n\nXander: What, and suck all the spontaneity out of being young and stupid? I'd rather live in the dark.\n\nWillow: You're not gonna be young forever.\n\nXander: Yes, but I'll always be stupid. [silence. He looks around] Let's not all rush to disagree.\n\nBuffy: Does \"rest in peace\" have no sanctity to you people? Oh, I forgot. You're not a people.\n\nBuffy: I wish we could be regular kids.\n\nAngel: Yeah. I'll never be a kid.\n\nBuffy: Okay, then a regular kid and her cradle-robbing, creature-of-the-night boyfriend.\n\nDalton: Yes, but ... The Order of Taraka. I mean, isn't that overkill?\n\nSpike: No, I think it's just enough kill.\n\nCordelia: I can't even believe you. You dragged me out of bed for a ride? What am I, mass transportation?\n\nXander: That's what a lot of the guys say, but it's just locker room talk. I wouldn't pay it any mind.\n\nCordelia: Oh, great, so now I'm your taxi and your punching bag.\n\nXander: I like to think of you more as my witless foil, but have it your way.\n\nCordelia: You know what? I'm going. I'd rather be worm food than look at your pathetic face!\n\nXander: Then go! I'm not stopping you!\n\nCordelia: I bet you wouldn't. I bet you'd let a girl go off to her doom all by herself!\n\nXander: Not just any girl. You're special.\n\nCordelia: I can't believe that I'm stuck spending what will probably be my last few moments on Earth here with you!\n\nXander: I hope these are my last few moments. Three more seconds with you and I'm gonna...\n\nCordelia: \"I'm gonna\" what? [steps closer] Coward!\n\nXander: Moron!\n\nCordelia: I hate you!\n\nXander: I hate you!\n\n[They kiss]\n\nXander: ...We so need to get out of here!\n\nCordelia: [nods, frightened] Uh huh.\n\nWillow: There's a Slayer handbook?\n\nBuffy: Wait. Handbook? What handbook? How come I don't have a handbook?\n\nWillow: Is there a T-shirt, too? 'Cause that would be cool...\n\nGiles: After meeting you, Buffy, I realized that, uh, the handbook would be of no use in your case.\n\nBuffy: Well, what do you mean it would be of no use in my case? Wha- what's wrong with my case?\n\nKendra: And those two, they also know you are the Slayer?\n\nBuffy: Yep.\n\nKendra: Did anyone explain to you what \"secret identity\" means?\n\nBuffy: Nope. Must be in the handbook. Right after the chapter on personality removal.\n\nBuffy: It's your lucky day, Spike.\n\nKendra: Two Slayers.\n\nBuffy: No waiting.\n\nOz: Oh, hey, animal cracker?\n\nWillow: No, thank you. How's your arm?\n\nOz: Suddenly painless.\n\nWillow: You can still play guitar okay?\n\nOz: Not well, but not worse.\n\nWillow: You know, I never really thanked you.\n\nOz: Please don't. I don't do thanks. I get all red and I have to bail. It's not pretty.\n\nWillow: Well then forget-that thing. Especially the part where I kind of owe you my life.\n\n[Oz pulls a cracker from the box, hoping to change the subject.]\n\nOz: Look. Monkey. And he has a little hat. And little pants.\n\nWillow: Yeah. I see.\n\nOz: The monkey is the only cookie animal that gets to wear clothes, you know that... You have the sweetest smile I've ever seen... So I'm wondering, do the other cookie animals feel sort of ripped? Like, is the hippo going, \"hey man, where are my pants? I have my hippo dignity.\" And you know the monkey's just, [in French accent] \"I mock you with my monkey pants,\" then there's a big coup at the zoo...\n\nWillow: The monkey's French?\n\nOz: All monkeys are French. You didn't know that?\n\nDrusilla: Don't worry, dear heart. I'll see that you get strong again. Like me.\n\nWillow: And you're loving playing nursemaid?\n\nBuffy: Oh, yeah!\n\nXander: So, is it better than playing naughty stewardess?\n\nBuffy: Vampires are creeps.\n\nGiles: Yes, that's why one slays them.\n\nBuffy: I mean, people are perfectly happy getting along, and then vampires come, and they run around and they kill people, and they take over your whole house, they start making these stupid little mini-pizzas, and everyone's like, \"I like your mini pizzas\", but I'm telling you, I am—\n\nGiles: Uh, Buffy! I believe the subtext here is rapidly becoming, uh... text.\n\nBuffy: So Mom's like, \"Do you think Ted will like this?\" and \"This is Ted's favorite show\", and \"Ted's teaching me computers\", and \"Ted said the funniest thing\", and I'm like, \"That's really great, Mom\", and then she said I was being sarcastic, which I was, but I'm sorry if I don't wanna talk about Ted all the time.\n\nAngel: So, you gonna talk about something else at some point?\n\nBuffy: I'm sorry. I just have so much to deal with, I don't need some new guy in my life.\n\nAngel: No, but maybe your mom does.\n\nBuffy: Well, sure, if you're gonna use wisdom.\n\nAngel: Loneliness is about the scariest thing there is.\n\nBuffy: Okay, so my mom needs a guy in her life. Does it have to be Ted?\n\nAngel: Do you have somebody else in mind? There's a guy out there that would satisfy you?\n\nBuffy: My dad? Yeah, okay, that's not gonna happen. Fine, fine, I'll give Ted a chance. I'll play mini-golf, and I'll smile and curtsy and be the dutiful daughter. Do I have to like him?\n\nAngel: Kiss me.\n\nBuffy: Finally, something I wanna do!\n\nCordelia: I don't get it. Buffy's the Slayer. Shouldn't she have...\n\nXander: What, a license to kill?\n\nCordelia: Well, not for fun! But she's, like, this Superman! Shouldn't there be different rules for her?\n\nWillow: Sure, in a fascist society.\n\nCordelia: Right! Why can't we have one of those?\n\nWillow: Buffy's not going to jail. It's not fair.\n\nGiles: Whatever the authorities have planned for her, it can't be much worse than what she's doing to herself. She's taken a human life. The guilt, it... it's, it's pretty hard to bear, and it won't go away soon.\n\nCordelia: I guess you should know, since you helped raise that demon that killed that guy that time?\n\nGiles: Yes. Do let's bring that up as often as possible.\n\nWillow: And the sad thing is, the real Ted must have been a genius. There were design features in that robot that predate--\n\nBuffy: Willow, tell me you didn't keep any parts.\n\nWillow: Not any big ones...\n\nBuffy: Oh, Will, you're supposed to use your powers for good!\n\nWillow: I just wanna learn stuff.\n\nCordelia: Like how to build your own serial killer?\n\nXander: Well, it's so hard to rent one nowadays.\n\nJoyce: It's an outfit. An outfit that you may never buy.\n\nBuffy: But I looked good in it.\n\nJoyce: You looked like a streetwalker.\n\nBuffy: But a thin streetwalker. (pauses) That's probably not gonna be the winning argument, is it?\n\nJoyce: You're just too young to wear that.\n\nBuffy: Yeah, and I'm gonna be too young to wear it until I'm too old to wear it.\n\nJoyce: That's the idea.\n\nBuffy: Did Mr. Whitmore notice I was tardy?\n\nXander: I think the word you're searching for is absent.\n\nWillow: Tardy people show. And yes, he did notice, so he wanted me to give you this. [hands Buffy an egg]\n\nBuffy: As far as punishments go, this is fairly abstract.\n\nWillow: No, it's your baby!\n\nBuffy: Okay, I get it even less.\n\nXander: You know it's the whole sex leads to responsibility thing, which I personally don't get. You gotta take care of the egg, it's a baby. You gotta keep it safe and teach it Christian values.\n\nWillow: My egg is Jewish.\n\nXander: Then teach it that dreidel song.\n\nWillow: Hey, maybe you can have Angel help you find the Gorches.\n\nGiles: Yes! Yes, yes, that's not a bad idea. Strength in numbers.\n\nXander: Oh, right. I see a lotta hunting getting done in that scenario.\n\nBuffy: Please. Like Angel and I are just helpless slaves to passion. Grow up! [cut to Buffy and Angel on patrol making out]\n\nXander: Which is another secret to conscientious egg care. A pot of scalding water and about eight minutes.\n\nWillow: You boiled your young?\n\nGiles: I suppose there is a sort of Machiavellian ingenuity to your transgression.\n\nXander: I resent that! Or possibly thank you.\n\nGiles: A little of both might be appropriate.\n\nAngel: So you don't think about the future?\n\nBuffy: No.\n\nAngel: Never?\n\nBuffy: No.\n\nAngel: You really don't care what happens a year from now? Five years from now?\n\nBuffy: Angel, when I look into the future, all I see is you! All I want is you.\n\nAngel: I know the feeling.\n\n[Buffy tells Angel about her dream, in which Drusilla kills him.]\n\nAngel: Still, not every dream you have comes true. I mean, what else did you dream last night? Can you remember?\n\nBuffy: I dreamt ... I dreamt that Giles and I opened an office supply warehouse in Vegas.\n\nAngel: You see my point?\n\n[Buffy prods Willow about her interest in Oz.]\n\nWillow: Oh, I don't know, though. He is a senior.\n\nBuffy: You think he's too old 'cause he's a senior? Please. My boyfriend had a bicentennial.\n\n...\n\nBuffy: You can't spend the rest of your life waiting for Xander to wake up and smell the hottie. Make a move. Do the talking thing.\n\nWillow: Well, what if the talking thing becomes the awkward-silence thing?\n\nOz: I'm gonna ask you to go out with me tomorrow night. And I'm kinda nervous about it, actually. It's interesting.\n\nWillow: Oh! Well, if it helps at all, I'm gonna say \"yes.\"\n\nOz: Yeah, it helps. It ... it creates a comfort zone. ... Do you wanna go out with me tomorrow night?\n\nWillow: [slaps forehead] Oh! I can't!\n\nOz: Well, see, I like that you're unpredictable.\n\nWillow: Oh ... It's just, it's Buffy's birthday, and we're throwing her a surprise party.\n\nOz: It's okay.\n\nWillow: But you could come! If you wanted.\n\nOz: Well, I don't want to crash.\n\nWillow: No, it's fine! You could be my ... my date.\n\nOz: All right. I'm in. [nods farewell when she indicates she's ready to leave]\n\nWillow: [walks off, delighted with the encounter] I said \"date\"!\n\nWillow: Are you okay?\n\nOz: Yeah. Hey, did everybody see that guy just turn to dust?\n\nWillow: Ohhh, well ... sort of.\n\nXander: Yep. Vampires are real, a lot of 'em live in Sunnydale, Willow will fill you in.\n\nWillow: I know it's hard to accept at first.\n\nOz: Actually, it explains a lot.\n\n[The Judge has captured both Buffy and Angel.]\n\nAngel: Leave her alone!\n\nSpike: That'll work. Now say pretty please.\n\nAngel: Take me instead.\n\nSpike: Apparently, you're not familiar with the concept. There is no instead, only firsts and seconds.\n\nDrusilla: And if you go first, you don't get to watch the Slayer die.\n\nSpike: Hurts, doesn't it??\n\nAngelus: Well, you know, it kinda itches a little.\n\nSpike: Don't just stand there. Burn him.\n\nAngelus: Gee, maybe he's broken.\n\nSpike: What the hell is going on?\n\nJudge: This one ... cannot be burnt. He is clean.\n\nSpike: Clean? You mean, he's ...\n\nJudge: There's no humanity in him.\n\nAngelus: I couldn't have said it better myself.\n\nDrusilla: Angelus.\n\nAngelus: Yeah, baby. I'm back.\n\n...\n\nSpike: No more of this 'I've got a soul' crap?\n\nAngelus: What can I say, hmm? I was going through a phase.\n\n...\n\nSpike: You've really got a yen to hurt this girl, haven't you?\n\nAngelus: She made me feel like a human being. That's not the kind of thing you just forgive.\n\nWillow: I knew it! I knew it! Well, not knew it in the sense of having the slightest idea, but I knew there was something I didn't know. You two were fighting way too much. It's not natural!\n\nXander: I know it's weird ...\n\nWillow: Weird? It's against all laws of God and Man! It's Cordelia! Remember? The, the 'We Hate Cordelia Club', of which you are the treasurer.\n\nXander: Look, I was gonna tell you.\n\nWillow: Gee, what stopped you? Could it be shame?\n\nXander: All right, let's over-react, shall we?\n\nWillow: But I'm ...\n\nXander: Willow. We were just kissing. It doesn't mean that much.\n\nWillow: No. ... It just means you'd rather be with someone you hate, than be with me.\n\nAngelus: [about last night, when they had sex] What? I took off.\n\nBuffy: But you didn't say anything. You just left.\n\nAngelus: Yeah. Like I really wanted to stick around after that.\n\nBuffy: What?\n\nAngelus: You got a lot to learn about men, kiddo. Although I guess you proved that last night.\n\nBuffy: What are you saying?\n\nAngelus: Let's not make an issue out of it, okay? In fact, let's not talk about it at all. It happened.\n\nBuffy: I, I don't understand. Was it m-me? Was I not good?\n\nAngelus: You were great. Really. I thought you were a pro.\n\nSpike: Now, I know you haven't been in the game for a while, mate, but we still do kill people. Sort of our raison d'être, you know.\n\n...\n\nAngelus: Spike, my boy, you really don't get it, do you? You tried to kill her, but you couldn't. Look at you. You're a wreck! She's stronger than any Slayer you've ever faced. Force won't get it done. You gotta work from the inside. To kill this girl ... you have to love her.\n\nGiles: It's not over. I suppose you know that. He'll come after you, particularly. His profile ... he's likely to strike out at the things that made him the most human.\n\nBuffy: You must be so disappointed in me.\n\nGiles: No. No no, I'm not.\n\nBuffy: This is all my fault.\n\nGiles: I don't believe it is. Do you want me to wag my finger at you and tell you that you acted rashly? You did. And I can. I know that you loved him. And, he ... he's proven more than once that he loved you. You couldn't have known what would happen. The coming months are, are going to be hard, I suspect on all of us. But if it's guilt you're looking for, Buffy, I'm not your man. All you will get from me is my support. And my respect.\n\nWillow: We have a lot of fun, but I want smoochies!\n\nBuffy: Have you dropped any hints?\n\nWillow: I've dropped anvils.\n\nBuffy: Well, he'll come around. What guy could resist your wily Willow charms?\n\nWillow: At last count? All of them, maybe more.\n\nBuffy: Well, none of them know a thing! They all get an \"F\" in Willow.\n\nWillow: But I want Oz to get an \"A,\" and, oh, one of those gold stars!\n\nBuffy: But I would do a lot better if you and Xander and I could do that \"sharing our misery\" thing tonight.\n\nWillow: Great. I'll give Xander a call. What's his number? Oh, yeah 1-800-I'm-Dating-A-Skanky-Ho.\n\nBuffy: Meow!\n\nWillow: Thanks, I haven't gotten a \"Meow\" before.\n\nGiles: Quite. And it, uh, acts on-on pure instinct. No conscience, uh, uh, predatory and-and aggressive.\n\nBuffy: In other words, your typical male.\n\nXander: On behalf of my gender, hey!\n\nGiles: Yes, let's not jump to any conclusions.\n\nBuffy: I didn't jump. I took a tiny step, and there conclusions were.\n\nBuffy: [to Willow] Welcome to the mystery that is men. I think it goes something like, they grow body hair, they lose all ability to tell you what they really want.\n\nOz: You mean... you'd still...\n\nWillow: Well, I like you. You're nice, and you're funny, and you don't smoke. Yeah, okay, werewolf, but that's not all the time. I mean, three days out of the month, I'm not much fun to be around either.\n\nOz: You are quite the human.\n\nWillow: So I'd still, if you'd still.\n\nOz: I'd still. I'd very still!\n\nWillow: Okay. No biting, though.\n\nOz: Agreed.\n\n[Willow walks off, then runs back and gives Oz a quick but thorough kiss. She leaves again.]\n\nOz: Huh. A werewolf in love.\n\nXander: I wish dating was like slaying. You know, simple, direct, stake to the heart, no muss, no fuss.\n\nBuffy: Sorry to say, Xand, slaying is a tad more perilous than dating.\n\nXander: Well, you're obviously not dating Cordelia.\n\nAngelus: Dear Buffy. I'm still trying to decide the best way to send my regards.\n\nSpike: Why don't you rip her lungs out? It might make an impression.\n\nAngelus: Lacks... poetry.\n\nSpike: It doesn't have to. What rhymes with lungs?\n\nDrusilla: Don't worry, Spike. Angel always knows...what speaks to a girl's heart.\n\nWillow: Don't be so jumpy... I've been in your bed before.\n\nXander: Yeah, but Will, we were both in footy pajamas.\n\nXander: Buff, for the love of God, don't open that raincoat.\n\nBuffy: Come on! It's a party! Aren't you gonna open your present?\n\nXander: It's not that I don't want to. Sometimes the remote impossible possibility that you might like me was all that sustained me. But not now. Not like this. This isn't real to you, you're only here because of a spell. I mean, if I thought you had one clue what it would mean to me, but you don't, so I can't.\n\nBuffy: [angered] So you're saying this is all a game?\n\nXander: A game? I... No!\n\nBuffy: You make me feel this way, and then you reject me? What am I, a toy?\n\nXander: Buffy, please calm down.\n\nBuffy: I'll calm down when you explain yourself!\n\nAmy: Get away from him. He's mine.\n\nBuffy: Oh, I don't think so. Xander, tell her.\n\nXander: What? I, uh...\n\nAmy: He doesn't have to say. I know what his heart wants.\n\nBuffy: Funny, I know what your face wants. [Buffy punches Amy hard in the face] What is this, you're two-timing me?\n\nAmy: Goddess Hecate, work thy will...\n\nXander: Uh-oh.\n\nAmy: ... Before thee let the unclean thing crawl!\n\nCordelia: Harmony, shut up. [Xander looks back] Do you know what you are, Harmony? You're a sheep.\n\nHarmony: I'm not a sheep.\n\nCordelia: You're a sheep. All you ever do is what everyone else does just so you can say you did it first. And here I am, scrambling for your approval, when I'm way cooler than you are 'cause I'm not a sheep. I do what I wanna do, and I wear what I wanna wear. And you know what? [Xander smiles] I'll date whoever the hell I wanna date. No matter how lame he is. [Xander stops smiling]\n\nAngelus: Passion. It lies in all of us. Sleeping...waiting...and though unwanted...unbidden...it will stir...open its jaws, and howl. It speaks to us...guides us. Passion rules us all. And we obey. What other choice do we have? Passion is the source of our finest moments. the joy of love...the clarity of hatred...and the ecstasy of grief. It hurts sometimes more than we can bear. If we could live without passion, maybe we'd know some kind of peace. But we would be hollow. Empty rooms, shuttered and dank. Without passion, we'd truly be dead.\n\nCordelia: Oh, God! I invited him in my car once. That means he can come into my car whenever he wants!\n\nXander: Yep, you're doomed to havin' to give him and his vamp pals a lift whenever they feel like it. And those guys never chip in for gas.\n\nBuffy: It's so weird. Every time something like this happens, my first instinct is still to run to Angel. I can't believe it's the same person. He's completely different from the guy that I knew.\n\nWillow: Well, sort of, except ...\n\nBuffy: Except what?\n\nWillow: You're still the only thing he thinks about.\n\nXander: I'm sorry, but let's not forget that I hated Angel long before you guys jumped on the bandwagon. So I think I deserve a little something for not saying \"I told you so\" long before now. And if Giles wants to go after the ... fiend that murdered his girlfriend, I say, \"Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!\"\n\nBuffy: Yeah. There's just one problem with Giles in a revenge scenario. It'll get him killed.\n\nSpike: Are you insane? We're supposed to kill the bitch, not leave gag gifts in her friends' beds.\n\nDrusilla: But, Spike, the bad teacher was going to restore Angel's soul.\n\nSpike: What if she did? If you ask me, I find myself preferring the old Buffy-whipped Angelus. This new, improved one is not playing with a full sack. I love a good slaughter as much as the next bloke, but his little pranks will only leave us with one incredibly brassed-off Slayer!\n\nAngelus: Don't worry, Roller Boy. I've got everything under control. [ Molotov Cocktail lights the room on fire]\n\nBuffy: Hey. Here we are. It's all of we. Are we taking me home?\n\nDr. Wilkinson: No. Buffy, you need to lie down, honey.\n\nBuffy: Yeah? Lie at home. My bed is better than any bed that's... not my bed.\n\nDr. Wilkinson: She's still a little out of it.\n\nBuffy: Shhh! Hospital zone. No singing.\n\n[Willow brings Buffy, who is in hospital, her homework]\n\nBuffy: Homework.\n\nWillow: It's my way of saying get well soon.\n\nBuffy: You know, chocolate says that even better.\n\nWillow: I did all your assignments. All you have to do is sign your name.\n\nBuffy: Chocolate means nothing to me.\n\nGiles: Cordelia, have you actually ever heard of tact?\n\nCordelia: Tact is just not saying true stuff. I'll pass.\n\nWillow: I'm good at medical stuff, since Xander and I used to play doctor all the time.\n\nXander: No, she's being literal. She used to have all these medical volumes, and diagnosed me with stuff. I didn't have the heart to tell her she was playing it wrong.\n\nWillow: Wrong? Why? How did you play doctor?\n\nBuffy: I... never have.\n\nXander: You don't know how to kill this thing.\n\nBuffy: I thought I might try violence.\n\nXander: Solid call.\n\nBuffy: Impulsive? Do you remember my ex-boyfriend, the vampire? I slept with him, he lost his soul, now my boyfriend's gone forever, and the demon that wears his face is killing my friends. The next impulsive decision I make will involve my choice of dentures.\n\nWillow: Okay, the Angel thing went badly, I'm on board with that, but that's not your fault. And anyways, love isn't always like that. Love can be... nice!\n\nWillow: A ghost? Cool!\n\nXander: Oh, no, no. No. Not cool. This was no wimpy chain-rattler. This was \"I'm dead as hell, and I'm not gonna take it anymore.\"\n\nGiles: Well, despite the Xander-speak, that's a fairly accurate definition of a poltergeist.\n\nXander: I defined something? Accurately? Guess I'm done with the book learning.\n\nGiles: I appreciate your thoughts on the matter, in fact I encourage you to always challenge me when you feel it's appropriate; you should never be cowed by authority. Except, of course, in this instance, when I am clearly right and you are clearly wrong.\n\nGiles: [about the ghost of James] He's-he's trying to... resolve whatever issues are keeping him in limbo. What exactly those are, I'm not...\n\nBuffy: He wants forgiveness.\n\nGiles: Yes. I imagine he does. But when James possesses people, they act out exactly what happened that night. So he's experiencing a form of purgatory instead. I mean, he's doomed to kill his Ms. Newman over and over and over again, and... Forgiveness is impossible.\n\nBuffy: Good. He doesn't deserve it.\n\nGiles: To forgive is an act of compassion, Buffy. It's not done because people deserve it, it's done because they need it.\n\nBuffy: No. James destroyed the one person he loved the most in a moment of blind passion. And that's not something you forgive. No matter why he did what he did. And no matter if he knows now that it was wrong and selfish and stupid, it is just something he's gonna have to live with.\n\nXander: He can't live with it, Buff. He's dead.\n\nSpike: [as Angel viciously scrubs his face] You might want to let up. They say when you've drawn blood, you've exfoliated.\n\nAngelus: What do you know about it? I'm the one who was friggin' violated. You didn't have this thing in you.\n\nDrusilla: What was it? A demon?\n\nAngelus: [still washing his face] Love!\n\nDrusilla: Poor Angel.\n\nAngelus: [grabbing Drusilla] Let's get out of here. I need a really vile kill before sun-up to wipe this crap out of my system.\n\nDrusilla: Of course. We'll find you a nice toddler. [to Spike] Want to come, pet?\n\nAngelus: No can do, Dru. I'm sure he'd be hell on wheels, but we don't have much time. Gotta travel light. [grabs Spike and gets in his face] Sorry. Try to have fun without me.\n\n[Angelus and Drusilla leave]\n\nSpike: Oh, I will. [stands and kicks away the wheelchair] Sooner than you think.\n\nXander: Last month he's the freak with jicama breath who waxes his back. He wins a few meets and suddenly inherits the cool gene?\n\nCordelia: Well, all I know is, my cheerleading squad wasted a lot of pep on losers. It's about time our school excelled at something.\n\nWillow: Hmm. You're forgetting our high mortality rate.\n\nXander: We're number one!\n\nXander: That is wrong. A big fat spanking wrong. It's a slap in the face to every one of us who studied hard and worked long hours to earn our Ds.\n\nCordelia: Xander, I know you take pride in being the voice of the common wuss, but the truth is, certain people are entitled to special privileges. They're called winners. That's the way the world works.\n\nXander: And what about that nutty \"all men are created equal\" thing?\n\nCordelia: Propaganda spouted out by the ugly and less deserving.\n\nXander: I think that was Lincoln.\n\nCordelia: Disgusting mole and stupid hat.\n\nWillow: Actually, it was Jefferson.\n\nCordelia: Kept slaves. Remember?\n\nBuffy: So, something ripped him open and ate out his insides?\n\nWillow: Like an Oreo cookie, well, except for, you know, without the... chocolatey cookie goodness.\n\nGiles: Yes, um, Principal Snyder has asked the faculty to keep the news quiet for now, um, so as not to unduly upset the students.\n\nXander: For \"students\", read \"swim team\".\n\nWillow: So we're looking for a beastie.\n\nGiles: That, uh, eats humans whole, except for the skin.\n\nBuffy: This doesn't make any sense.\n\nXander: Yeah, the skin's the best part.\n\nBuffy: Any demons with high cholesterol? [Giles looks at her] You're gonna think about that later, mister, and you're gonna laugh!\n\nBuffy: I wouldn't break out the tartar sauce just yet. It's not like you were exposed more than once. Twice?\n\nXander: Three times a Fish Guy.\n\nBuffy, Willow: Oh.\n\nCordelia: Whoa!\n\nXander: What am I gonna do?\n\nCordelia: You, you, you! What about me?! It's one thing to be dating the lame unpopular guy, but it's another to be dating the Creature from the Blue Lagoon.\n\nXander: Black Lagoon! The Creature from the Blue Lagoon was Brooke Shields. And thank you so much for your support!\n\nBuffy: I think we'd better find the rest of the swim team and lock them up before they get in touch with their inner halibut.\n\nXander: Let's see, I got to take a makeup chem test at 3:00. And then I'm meeting some of the guys for plasma transfusions at 5:00. It's turned into quite the busy afternoon.\n\nBuffy: The fun never stops with you, does it?\n\nWillow: Giles seems pretty confident that the treatments are gonna work.\n\nXander: Well, turning into a creepy-crawly wasn't on my top ten list of thing to do before I turn 20.\n\nCordelia: I want you to know that you've really proven yourself to me. And you don't have to join the new team next year if you don't want. I'd be just as happy if you played football.\n\nGiles: The-the people from animal control have just left. Our creatures have apperently made a-a dash for it. Um, so to speak.\n\nWillow: Does that mean we're gonna have to hunt them again?\n\nBuffy: No, I don't think so. I don't think we'll be seeing them anymore.\n\nGiles: Where do you think they'll go?\n\nBuffy: Home.\n\nPrincipal Snyder: Are we having a chair shortage?\n\nWillow: I didn't read anything about... oh, [slides off Oz's lap] I get it.\n\nPrincipal Snyder: These public displays of affection are not acceptable in my school. This isn't an orgy, people. It's a classroom.\n\nBuffy: Yeah, where they teach lunch.\n\nPrincipal Snyder: Just give me a reason to kick you out, Summers. Just give me a reason. [walks away]\n\nCordelia: How about 'cause you're a tiny impotent Nazi with a bug up his butt the size of an emu?\n\nBuffy: Sums it up.\n\nCordelia: Don't you think?\n\n[flashback]\n\nDrusilla: Me mum says I'm cursed. My seeing things is an affront to the Lord. That only He's supposed to see anything before it happens. But I don't mean to, Father, I swear. I swear. I try to be pure in His sight. I don't want to be an evil thing.\n\nAngelus: Oh, hush, child. The Lord has a plan for all creatures. Even a devil child like you.\n\nDrusilla: [mortified] A devil...\n\nAngelus: Yes, you're a spawn of Satan, all the Hail Mary's in the world aren't going to help. The Lord will use you and smite you down. He's like that.\n\nDrusilla: What can I do?\n\nAngelus: Fulfill His plan, child. Be evil. Just give in.\n\nDrusilla: No! I want to be good. I want to be pure.\n\nAngelus: We all do, at first. World doesn't work that way.\n\nDrusilla: Father, I beg you. Please... please, help me.\n\nAngelus: Very well. Ten 'Our Fathers' and an act of contrition. Does that sound good?\n\nDrusilla: Yes. Yes, Father, thank you.\n\nAngelus: The pleasure was mine. Oh, and my child?\n\nDrusilla: Yes?\n\nAngelus: God is watching you.\n\n[Angelus, Drusilla and some vampires bring the sarcophagus back to show Spike]\n\nSpike: It's a big rock. Can't wait to tell my friends, they all don't have a rock this big.\n\nAngelus: Spike, boy you never did learn your history.\n\nSpike: Let's have a lesson then.\n\nAngelus: Acathla, the demon, came forth to swallow the world. He was killed by a virtuous knight who pierced the demon's heart before he could draw a breath to perform the act. Acathla turned to stone, as demons sometimes do, and was buried where neither man nor demon would want to look. Unless of course they're puttin' up low-rent housing. [to other vampires] Boys.\n\n[two vampires open the sarcophagus]\n\nDrusilla: He fills my head. I can't hear anything else.\n\nSpike: Let me guess, someone pulls out the sword...\n\nAngelus: Someone worthy.\n\nSpike: ...The demon wakes up and wackiness ensues.\n\nDrusilla: He will swallow the world.\n\nAngelus: And every creature living on this planet will go to hell. My friends, we're about to make history... end.\n\nGiles: I've been on the phone with the museum, the artifact in question is missing and the curator has been murdered by vampires.\n\nBuffy: And you're sure this is the tomb of alfalfa.\n\nGiles: Acathla, and yes the information provided by Kendra's Watcher seems conclusive.\n\nWillow: Okay somebody explain the whole he will suck the world into hell thing because that's the part I'm not loving.\n\nGiles: Well the demon universe exists in a dimension separate from our own, and one breath of Acathla will create a vortex–a kind of whirlpool–that will pull everything on earth into that dimension where any non-demon life will suffer horrible and eternal torment.\n\nBuffy: So that would be the literal kind of sucked into hell. Neat. Willow I think you should try the curse.\n\nKendra: I tend to stand with your friend Xander on this one. Angel should be eliminated.\n\nBuffy: Oh I'll fight him. I'll kill him if I have to, but if I don't get there in time or I lose, then Willow might be our only hope.\n\nWillow: [nervously] But I don't want to be our only hope, I crumble under pressure, lets have another hope.\n\nKendra: We have. [pulls out a sword] Blessed by the knight who first slew the demon if all else fails this might stop it. [hesitantly] I think.\n\nGiles: Oh ooh may I. [Kendra hands Giles the sword] Thank you. [examining sword] Well its only if all else fails. [to Willow] Uh uh-mm how close are you to figuring out the ritual to the curse.\n\nWillow: Oh I need about a day, and an Orb of Thessulah, whatever that is.\n\nGiles: Spirit vault for the undead, I've got one. I've been using it as a paperweight.\n\nWillow: This means I can't help you study for tomorrow's final.\n\nBuffy: Oh, I'll wing it. Of course, if we go to Hell by then, I won't have to take 'em... Or maybe I'll be taking them forever.\n\nWhistler: There's moments in your life that make you, that set the course of who you're gonna be. Sometimes they're little, subtle moments. Sometimes they're not. I'll show you what I mean.\n\n...\n\nBottom line is, even if you see them coming, you're not ready for the big moments. No one asks for their life to change, not really. But it does. So, what are we, helpless? Puppets? Nah. The big moments are gonna come, you can't help that. It's what you do afterwards that counts. That's when you find out who you are.\n\nSpike: I want to save the world.\n\nBuffy: You do remember that you're a vampire, right?\n\nSpike: We like to talk big. Vampires do. \"I'm going to destroy the world.\" That's just tough guy talk. Strutting around with your friends over a pint of blood. The truth is, I like this world. You've got... dog racing, Manchester United. And you've got people, billions of people walking around like Happy Meals with legs. It's all right here. But then someone comes along with a vision, with a real... passion for destruction. Angel could pull it off. Goodbye, Piccadilly. Farewell, Leicester bloody Square. You know what I'm saying?\n\nBuffy: Okay, fine, you're not down with Angel. Why would you ever come to me?\n\nSpike: I want Dru back, I want it like it was before he came back. The way she acts around him.....\n\nBuffy: You're pathetic, I lost a friend tonight!\n\nSpike: I wasn't in on that raiding party.\n\nBuffy: And I may lose more. The whole earth may be sucked into Hell and you want my help because your girlfriend's a big ho? Well, let me take this opportunity to not care!\n\nSpike: I can't fight them both alone and neither can you.\n\nBuffy: [seething] I hate you.\n\nSpike: And I'm all you've got.\n\n[Knocked out cop groans]\n\nBuffy: Alright, talk.\n\nSpike: [Casually] I just need to kill this guy.\n\nBuffy: Ahem, ahem.\n\nSpike: Oh. Right.\n\nBuffy: Open your eyes, Mom. What do you think has been going on for the past two years? The fights, the weird occurrences. How many times have you washed blood out of my clothing, and you still haven't figured it out?\n\nJoyce: Well, it stops now!\n\nBuffy: No, it doesn't stop. It never stops. Do-do you think I chose to be like this? Do you have any idea how lonely it is? How dangerous? I would love to be upstairs watching TV or gossiping about boys or, god, even studying! But I have to save the world. Again.\n\nAngelus: Just tell me what I need to know.\n\nGiles: In order t-to... to be worthy... you must perform the ritual.. in a tutu. Pillock!\n\nAngelus: Alright. Someone get the chain saw.\n\nAngelus: No weapons, no friends, no hope. Take all that away, and what's left?\n\nBuffy: Me.\n\nSeasons: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 | Main\n\n[A vampire breaks out of a grave and someone is seen standing over it]\n\nWillow: That's right, big boy. Come and get it.\n\n...\n\n[after the vampire has escaped]\n\nXander: First of all, what was with the acrobatics? How did that happen?\n\nOz: Wasn't Andy Hoelich on the gymnastics team?\n\nXander: That's right, he was! [yells at Andy] Cheater! [turns back] Okay, and the, uh, second problem I'm having -- \"Come and get it, Big Boy\"?\n\nWillow: Well, w-w-well, the Slayer always says a pun, or-or a witty play on words, and, I think it throws the vampires off! And, and it makes them frightened, because I'm wisecracking. Okay, I didn't really have a chance to work on that one, but you try it every time!\n\nOz: Uh, if I may suggest, \"This time it's personal.\" I mean, there's a reason why it's a classic.\n\n[In Buffy's dream]\n\nBuffy: How did you find me here?\n\nAngel: If I was blind, I would see you.\n\nBuffy: Stay with me.\n\nAngel: Forever. That's the whole point. I'll never leave. Not even if you kill me.\n\nGiles: I mean, I appreciate your efforts to keep the vampire population down until Buffy returns, but if anything should happen to you, or you... should be killed, I should take it somewhat amiss.\n\nWillow: You'd be cranky?\n\nGiles: Entirely.\n\nWillow: Well, we try not to get killed. That's part of our whole mission statement: \"Don't get killed.\"\n\nBuffy: You know, I just woke up and I looked in the mirror and thought, 'Hey, what's with all the sin.' I need to change. I'm dirty, I'm bad with the sex, and the envy and the loud music that us kids listen to nowadays... oh, I just suck at undercover. Where's Ken?\n\nLily: I always knew I would come here... sooner or later. I knew I belonged here.\n\nBuffy: Where?\n\nLily: Hell.\n\nBuffy: This isn't Hell.\n\nKen: Isn't it? What is Hell, but the total absence of hope? The substance, the tactile proof of despair?\n\nBuffy: I'd like to find Willow and Xander.\n\nJoyce: Will you be slaying?\n\nBuffy: Only if they give me lip.\n\nPrincipal Snyder: I have not only the right, but also a nearly physical sensation of pleasure at the thought of keeping her out of school. I'd describe myself as tingly.\n\nJoyce: Buffy was cleared of all those charges.\n\nPrincipal Snyder: Yes, and while she may live up to the not-a-murderer requirement for enrollment, she is a troublemaker, destructive to school property and the occasional student. And her grade point average is enough to... I'm sorry. Another tingle moment.\n\n[Giles brings a zombie cat to the library.]\n\nCordelia: Nice pet, Giles. Don't you like anything regular? Golf, USA Today, or anything?\n\nGiles: We're trying to find out how and why it rose from the grave. It's not as if I want to take it home and offer it a saucer of warm milk.\n\nOz: Well, I like it. I think you should call it Patches.\n\nOz: We should figure out what kinda deal this is. I mean, is it a-a gathering, a shindig or a hootenanny?\n\nCordelia: What's the difference?\n\nOz: Well, a gathering is brie, mellow song stylings; shindig, dip, less mellow song stylings, perhaps a large amount of malt beverage; and hootenanny, well, it's chock full of hoot, just a little bit of nanny.\n\nXander: Well, I hate brie.\n\nCordelia: I know. It smells like Giles' cat.\n\nWillow: I mean, I'm not a full-fledged witch. That takes years. I just did a couple of Pagan blessings and, uh, teeny glamour to hide a zit.\n\nBuffy: It doesn't scare you?\n\nWillow: It has. I tried to communicate with the spirit world, and I so wasn't ready for that. It's like being pulled apart inside. Plus I blew the power for our whole block. Big scare.\n\nBuffy: I wish I could've been there with you.\n\nWillow: Me, too. I really freaked out.\n\nBuffy: I am sorry.\n\nWillow: It's okay. I understand you having to bail, and I can forgive that. I have to make allowances for what you're going through and be a grown-up about it.\n\nBuffy: You're really enjoying this whole moral superiority thing, aren't you?\n\nWillow: It's like a drug.\n\nBuffy: Fine. Okay. I'm the bad. I can take my lumps... For a while.\n\nWillow: All right, I'll stop giving you a hard time... Runaway.\n\nBuffy: Will!\n\nWillow: I'm sorry... quitter.\n\nBuffy: Whiner.\n\nWillow: Bailer.\n\nBuffy: Harpy.\n\nWillow: Delinquent.\n\nBuffy: Tramp.\n\nWillow: Bad seed.\n\nBuffy: Witch.\n\nWillow: Freak.\n\nWillow: I think you're ready now, or at least in the state of pre-readiness to make conversation, or-or to do that thing with your mouth that boys like. [Buffy glares at her] Oh, I didn't mean that bad thing with your mouth, I meant that little half-smile thing that you... [looks at Oz] you're supposed to stop me when I do that.\n\nOz: I like when you do that.\n\nBuffy: I just wanna get my life back, you know, do normal stuff.\n\nWillow: Like date?\n\nBuffy: Well...\n\nXander: Oh, you wanna date. I saw that half-smile, you little slut.\n\n[Xander starts chuckling and Buffy punches him on the arm]\n\nXander: [still kind of chuckling] Ow.\n\nBuffy: All right, yes, date and shop and hang out and go to school and save the world from unspeakable demons. You know, I wanna do girlie stuff.\n\nFaith: The whole summer it was, like, the worst heatwave. So it's about 118 degrees and I'm sleeping without a stitch on, and all of a sudden, I hear this screaming from outside. So I go tearing out, stark nude, and this church bus has broke down and there's these three vamps feasting on half the Baptists in South Boston. So I waste the vamps, and the preacher comes up and he's hugging me like there's no tomorrow, when all of a sudden, the cops pull up and they arrested us both.\n\nXander: Wow. They should film that story and show it every Christmas.\n\nFaith: God, I could eat a horse. Isn't it crazy how slaying just always makes you hungry and horny?\n\n[Xander, Cordy, Willow & Oz all look at Buffy for confirmation]\n\nBuffy: Well... sometimes I-I crave a non-fat yogurt afterwards.\n\nBuffy: [about Kakistos] Now, this guy shows up two days ago, right? Right around the same time my bestest new little sister makes her scene.\n\nGiles: You think he and Faith are connected?\n\nBuffy: Giles, there are two things that I don't believe in: coincidence and leprechauns.\n\nGiles: Well, Buffy, it's entirely possible that they both arrived here by chance simultaneously.\n\nBuffy: Okay, but I was right about the leprechauns, right?\n\nGiles: As far as I know, yes.\n\nGiles: The Council has approved our request. Faith is to stay here indefinitely, and I'm to look after you both until a new Watcher is assigned.\n\nBuffy: Good. She really came through in the end. She had a lot to deal with, but she did it. She got it behind her.\n\nGiles: I'm glad to hear it.\n\nBuffy: Angel was cured.\n\nGiles: I'm sorry?\n\nBuffy: When I killed him, Angel was cured. [to Willow] Your spell worked at the last minute, Will. I was about to take him out, and, um, something went through him, and he was Angel again. He-he didn't remember anything that he'd done. He just held me. Um, but i-it was, it was too late, and I-I had to. So I-I told him that I loved him, and I kissed him, and I killed him. I don't know if that helps with your spell or not, Giles.\n\nGiles: Uh, yes, I-I believe it will.\n\nWillow: [to Buffy] I'm sorry.\n\nBuffy: It's okay. I've been holding on to that for so long. Felt good to get it out. I'll see you guys later.\n\nWillow: Giles, I know you don't like me playing with mystical forces, but I can really help with this binding spell.\n\nGiles: There is no spell.\n\nFaith: Nice place. Do you ever catch kids doing the diddy out here?\n\nBuffy: No, there's a smooch spot up by the words. That's usually where kids go.\n\nFaith: Yeah? Bet you and Scott have been up there kicking the gearshift.\n\nBuffy: Hardly. Only been on a few dates.\n\nFaith: [about Scott] But you like him, and when you think about him you get that good, down-low tickle, right?\n\nBuffy: Yeah, I guess, but... how low?\n\nFaith: You tell me.\n\nBuffy: How about not? But he is... nice, and he's funny.\n\nFaith: And quite a muffin.\n\nBuffy: Blueberry. That crunchy, munchy staff on top. But my most favorite thing so far is that he doesn't seem to be any kind of hell beast.\n\nFaith: All men are beasts, Buffy.\n\nBuffy: Okay, I was hoping to not get that cynical 'til I was at least 40.\n\nFaith: It's not cynical. I mean, it's realistic. Every guy from Manimal down to Mr. \"I-Love-The-English-Patient\" has beast in him. And I don't care how sensitive they act. They're all still just in it for the chase.\n\nBuffy: We have a marching jazz band?\n\nOz: Yeah, but, you know, since the best jazz is improvisational, we'd be going off in all directions, banging into floats... Scary.\n\nWillow: He's just being Oz.\n\nOz: Pretty much full-time.\n\nBuffy: Couldn't sleep, huh?\n\nWillow: I've been at Mister Donut since the TV did that snowy thing. How come you're the Wakey Girl? I mean, this time, it's not your boyfriend who's the cold-blooded... [sees Oz] Jelly doughnut?\n\nGiles: Our task now is to determine what sort of killer we are dealing with. Quite clearly, we're looking for a depraved, sadistic animal.\n\n[Oz comes in.]\n\nOz: Present. Hey, I may be a cold-blooded jelly doughnut, but my timing is impeccable.\n\nBuffy: [voice over, from The Call of the Wild.] \"Night came on, and a full moon rose high over the trees, lighting the land till it lay bathed in ghostly day. And the strain of the primitive remained alive and active. Faithfulness and devotion, things born of fire and roof were his, yet he retained his wireness and wiliness. And from the depths of the forest, a call still sounded.\"\n\nXander: Buffy and Faith are in the library getting all sweaty.\n\nCordelia: They're training.\n\nXander: I stand by my phrase.\n\nMr. Trick: Competition. Competition is a beautiful thing. It makes us strive. It makes us accomplish. Occasionally, it makes us kill. We all have the desire to win. Whether we're human, vampire or ... whatever the hell you are, my brother. You got them spiny-looking head things. I ain't never seen that before.\n\nKulak: I am Kulak, of the Miquot Clan.\n\nMr. Trick: Isn't that nice.\n\nBuffy: Hey.\n\nWillow: Hi! How are you? You good? You look good. Anything new? Hey, did I mention you look good?\n\nBuffy: Willow, it's okay that you're helping Cordelia. We're best friends. I'm not gonna hold it against you.\n\nWillow: No, I'm not a friend, I'm a rabid dog who should be shot! But there're forces at work here! Dark, incomprehensible forces.\n\nBuffy: And I'm sure they're more important than all we've been through together, or... the number of times that I've saved your life.\n\nWillow: What do you want?\n\nBuffy: Fifteen minutes alone on your computer with Cordelia's database.\n\nWillow: 'kay.\n\nXander: Okay, let's not say something we'll all regret later, okay?\n\nCordelia: Crazy freak!\n\nBuffy: Vapid whore!\n\nXander: Like that.\n\nCordelia: I don't even get why you care about Homecoming when you're doing stuff like this.\n\nBuffy: Because this is all I do. This is what my life is. You couldn't understand. I just thought ... Homecoming Queen. I could pick up a yearbook someday and say, I was there. I went to high school, I had friends, and, for one moment, I got to live in the world. And there'd be proof, proof that I was chosen for something other than this. Besides, [pumps the rifle] I look cute in a tiara.\n\nAngel: It's late. How'd you get away?\n\nBuffy: Aw, it was easy. Started a fire in the prison laundry room. Rode out in the garbage truck.\n\nAngel: Oh.\n\nBuffy: I'm joking. No garbage. Smell me.\n\nBuffy: Something's definitely changing them.\n\nWillow: A spell?\n\nOz: They're teenagers. It's a sobering mirror to look into, huh?\n\nPrincipal Snyder: [to Oz] You've got great hair.\n\nXander: I don't get this. The candy's supposed to make you feel all immature and stuff, but I've had a ton and I don't feel any diff- never mind.\n\nBuffy: Yeah, we can go home. I've got the SAT's tomorrow.\n\nJoyce: Oh, blow them off. I'll write you a note.\n\nBuffy: It was just too much to deal with. It was like nothing made sense anymore. The things that I thought I understood were gone. I just felt... so alone.\n\nGiles: Was that the math or the verbal?\n\nBuffy: Mostly the math.\n\nCordelia: Why are you guys so hyper?\n\nWillow: Hey, speaking of people and things they do that aren't like usual, anyone notice Buffy acting sort of different?\n\nXander: Let's see. Killing zombies, torching sewer monsters, and, no, that's pretty much the same old Buffster.\n\nBuffy: Lagos is out of luck. I got the magic mitten thingy. What's with all the tragedy masks?\n\nGiles: Better take a seat, Buffy.\n\nBuffy: What's going on?\n\nGiles: We know Angel is alive. Xander saw you with him. It would appear that you've been hiding him and that you lied to us.\n\nWillow: Nobody's here to blame you, Buffy. But this is serious. You need help.\n\nBuffy: It's not what you think.\n\nXander: Hope not, because I think you're harboring a vicious killer.\n\nWillow: This isn't about attacking Buffy. Remember, \"I\" statements only. \"I feel angry.\" \"I feel worried.\"\n\nCordelia: Fine. Here's one. I feel worried. About me! Last time around, Angel barely laid a hand on Buffy. He was way more interested in killing her friends.\n\nBuffy: But he's better now.\n\nXander: Better for how long, Buffy? I mean, did you even think about that?\n\nBuffy: What is this, demons anonymous? I don't need an intervention here.\n\nGiles: Oh, don't you? You must've known it was wrong seeing Angel, or you wouldn't have hidden it from all of us.\n\nBuffy: I was going to tell you, I was. It was just that I... I didn't know why he came back. I-I just wanted to wait.\n\nXander: For what? For Angel to go psycho again the next time you give him a happy?\n\nBuffy: I'm not going to... we're not together like that.\n\nOz: But you were kissing him.\n\nBuffy: You were spying on me? What gives you the right?\n\nCordelia: What gives you the right to suck face with your demon lover again?\n\nBuffy: It was an accident.\n\nXander: What, you just tripped and fell on his lips?\n\nBuffy: It was wrong, okay? I know that, and I know that it can't happen again. But you guys have to believe me. I would "
