        "text": "Over on my personal blog I am conducting a long project where I look hard at one of the most interesting serial narratives of the last few decades: cult hit Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I’m looking episode-by-episode to see how the narrative builds over time, how the show identifies and solves storytelling problems, and how the craft and the mysteries resonate throughout every piece of story.\n\nThese aren’t episode reviews – these are dives into the mechanics of storytelling. It’s probably hard to follow if you haven’t seen any of Buffy, but if you have, I promise you there will be insights here you’ve never before encountered.\n\nI’ll update this episode index periodically, but you can always find every post by clicking on the Buffy tag on my personal blog.\n\nUPDATE: Finished Buffy’s high school years, i.e. the first three seasons, which seems as good a time as any to take a much-needed rest!\n\nSEASON ONE\n\nWelcome to the Hellmouth / The Harvest\n\nThe Witch\n\nTeacher’s Pet\n\nNever Kill a Boy on the First Date\n\nThe Pack\n\nAngel\n\nI, Robot… You, Jane\n\nThe Puppet Show\n\nNightmares\n\nOut of Mind, Out of Sight\n\nProphecy Girl\n\nINTERLUDE\n\nOriginal film screenplay\n\nSEASON TWO\n\nWhen She Was Bad\n\nSome Assembly Required\n\nSchool Hard\n\nInca Mummy Girl\n\nReptile Boy\n\nHalloween\n\nLie to Me\n\nThe Dark Age\n\nWhat’s My Line, Part One\n\nWhat’s My Line, Part Two\n\nTed\n\nBad Eggs\n\nSurprise\n\nInnocence\n\nPhases\n\nBewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered\n\nPassion\n\nKilled by Death\n\nI Only Have Eyes For You\n\nGo Fish\n\nBecoming, Part One\n\nBecoming, Part Two\n\nINTERLUDE\n\nDawson’s Creek\n\nSEASON THREE\n\nAnne\n\nDead Man’s Party\n\nFaith, Hope & Trick\n\nBeauty and the Beasts\n\nHomecoming\n\nBand Candy\n\nRevelations\n\nLovers Walk\n\nThe Wish\n\nAmends\n\nGingerbread\n\nHelpless\n\nThe Zeppo\n\nBad Girls\n\nConsequences\n\nDoppelgängland\n\nEnemies\n\nEarshot\n\nChoices\n\nThe Prom\n\nGraduation Day, Part 1\n\nGraduation Day, Part 2"
