        "text": "A young female makes the decision to devote her life to fight all types of supernatural beings that threaten everyone and the world. Along the way, her friends and family do their best to support her personal life as she fights to protect everyone and the world.—RECB3\n\n\"In every generation there is a chosen one... she alone will stand against the vampires, the demons and the forces of darkness. She is the slayer.\" Buffy Summers knows this tale by heart, and no matter how hard she tries to be just a \"normal girl\", she can not escape from her destiny... Thankfully, she is not alone in her quest to save the world, as she has the help of her friends, the hilarious (and surprisingly quite effective) evil-fighting team called \"The Scooby Gang\". Together, Buffy & co. will slay their demons, survive one apocalypse after another, attend high school and college... and above all, understand that growing up can truly be Hell sometimes... literally.—m_starling"
