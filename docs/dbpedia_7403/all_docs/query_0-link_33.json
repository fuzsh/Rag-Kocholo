        "text": "THIRD PERSON POV\n\nAt the cemetery Buffy is fighting a vampire. She kicks him in the face with a high roundhouse kick, forcing him to step backwards and keep his balance. Camila then jumps from behind him and onto his back. She grabs onto his shoulders and handsprings over next to Buffy. They smile at each other as the vampire comes for them doing a jumping half-twisting crescent kick, which Camila ducks. He tries two punches, both of which Camila neatly blocks. On his third punch, she grabs his arm and hits him in the face with a high front snap kick- rolling over into a back walkover. Buffy then punches him squarely in the midsection and follows up with a swinging punch to his face, sending him to the ground.\n\n\"We haven't been properly introduced.\" Buffy starts, pulling out a stake. \"I'm Buffy, and you're history!\" Camila laughs and claps her hands for Buffy. Giles pops up from behind a crypt.\n\n\"Poor technique. Prioritizing, sub-par...execution was adequate, but a bit too bloody for my taste.\" Giles stammers making his way towards. us.\n\n\"Giles, don't mention it. It was our pleasure to make the world safe for humanity again.\" Buffy says sarcastically placing a hand over her heart. Camila giggles.\n\n\"I'm not saying that your methods are without merit, it's, uh, y-you're spending too much time and energy. It should simply be: plunge and move on. Plunge and...\" he trails off as he sees something on the ground. \"Hello.\" he bends over and picks it up with his pen.\n\n\"Oh, that's great! We kill 'em, you fence their stuff. What is it?\" Buffy asks as Giles giver her a look. The pair of girls wander over to him.\n\n\"I don't know.\" he says, looking at it closely.\n\n\"But it bothers you.\" Camila says, looking closely.\n\n\"Yes! Well, i...i thought this vampire was just on a random kill, but it may be something else.\" Giles thinks.\n\n\"Something big?\" Buffy questions and look at Camila who shrugs her shoulders.\n\n\"Yes. I'd best consult my books.\"\n\n*\n\nCAMILA POV\n\nBuffy and i sat on the table in the library studying the ring. Giles makes his way towards us from the stacks whilst flipping some pages of a book.\n\n\"That symbol on he ring...i believe it's the rune for fidelity, but, uh, it doesn't connect with any of the sects that i've studied.\" Giles says coming over to us.\n\n\"What about this? On the inside. It's a sun and three stars. Haven't we seen that somewhere?\" Buffy asks pointing to the inside of the ring.\n\n\"Let me see. No, i-i don't think this, um, represents any...\" Giles starts. I look into the book and see something.\n\n\"Wait, it's right here. Sun and three stars. Yuck, check these guys out. Told you it looked familiar.\" I smile handing the book to Giles.\n\n\"Oh, the Order of Aurelius. Yes, you're right.\" Giles says looking at me and then the book.\n\n\"Ooo, two points for the slayer and Cam, while the watcher has yet to score!\" Buffy laughs. I elbow her in the ribs as i see who walked into the library. \"Oh! Owen! Hi!\" Buffy slides off the table and fixes her dress. Giles looks up at Owen.\n\n\"What do you want?\" Owen looks at him confused.\n\n\"A book?\" Owen says.\n\n\"Oh!\" Giles realises that we are in a library. I roll my eyes and laugh as i slide off the table."
