"Never Kill a Boy on the First Date" is the fifth episode of the first season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer television show, and the fifth episode in the series. Written by Rob Des Hotel and Dean Batali, and directed by David Semel, it was originally broadcast on March 31, 1997, on The WB network.

Synopsis[]

A CRANKY SLAYER IS A CARELESS SLAYER — Buffy tries to maintain some semblance of a normal teenage social life by opting for a hot date instead of helping Giles protect Sunnydale from a violent vampire prophecy. As she's blinded by love, Buffy ignores the signs of the dark forces aligning against her. Meanwhile, while Buffy's being romanced, The Master is plotting her demise by invoking the wrath of the "Anointed One," a great warrior vampire who is The Master's most powerful weapon against the slayer.[1]

Summary[]

At night in a cemetery, Buffy stakes a vampire and Giles criticizes her technique. He notices a ring on the ground, which leads him to believe that the vampire she just slayed was not a random kill.

In his underground lair, the Master reads a prophecy from the Writings of Aurelius to his minions:

"And there will be a time of crisis, of worlds hanging in the balance. And in this time shall come the Anointed, the Master's great warrior. And the Slayer will not know him, will not stop him, and he will lead her into hell. As it is written, so it shall be. Five will die, and from their ashes, the Anointed One shall rise. The Brethren of Aurelius shall greet him and usher him to his immortal destiny."

At school, Buffy and Giles are in the library researching the engravings on the ring they found in the cemetery. Owen arrives and inquires about a poetry book by Emily Dickinson. He expresses surprise at finding Buffy in the library since he doesn't think she has any interest in books. After Owen leaves, Buffy quickly tells Giles she needs any books he may have of Dickinson's writings.

At lunch, Willow and Buffy excitedly chat about her interaction with Owen. Buffy spots Owen sitting alone and goes over to join him, but Cordelia beats her to it, inviting him to the Bronze. Ignoring Cordelia's invitation, he asks Buffy to meet him there instead. However, Giles has found out about the prophecy from the symbol on the ring and is convinced that the Anointed One will rise that night.

Despite Buffy's protests regarding her date with Owen, they spend hours sitting in a cemetery waiting for a vampire to rise. They encounter no vampires, and though Giles is certain that his calculations are correct, he decides to end their fruitless stakeout. Buffy rushes to the Bronze, only to see Owen dancing with Cordelia. Crushed, she leaves without trying to talk to him.

Meanwhile, in a van on the way to Sunnydale, a young boy talks to a man. The man suddenly stands up and begins to lecture the other passengers on God's judgment, quoting prophecies. Suddenly, a vampire walks in front of the van, causing it to crash. Another vampire swarms the wreck, attacking the passengers.

The next morning at Xander's locker, Owen asks Buffy out on another date that evening and gives her his pocket watch so she doesn't miss it again. Buffy jumps at the opportunity while Xander stews in his jealousy.

In her bedroom later that night, Buffy asks Willow and Xander about what she should wear on her date with Owen. Giles shows up unexpectedly, presenting a newspaper article that shows five people died when the van crashed. Among them was suspected murderer Andrew Borba, the man who was quoting prophecies. Buffy insists on going on her date, stating that it is the 90s and she can be a Slayer while still having a social life. Giles relents and decides to check out the funeral home by himself.

While Buffy is dancing with Owen at the Bronze, Cordelia tries to interrupt them on the dance floor. Meanwhile, Giles is followed to the cemetery by vampires and barricades himself inside a room. Xander and Willow find him through a window and run to the Bronze to find Buffy.

Angel arrives at the Bronze and insists Buffy leave because "serious things" are about to happen that evening. Eventually, Xander and Willow convince her to come to the funeral home by pretending to be a couple that wants to do something daring on a double date. Owen wants to tag along, but she tells him to stay behind and kisses him goodbye.

Buffy, Willow, and Xander arrive at the funeral home when Owen suddenly appears. While Giles and Buffy search the mortuary coolers, Borba rises as a vampire and attacks Owen, knocking him unconscious. Buffy, angry that he has "killed [her] date," kills Borba by sliding him into the burning furnace.

At school the next day, Owen is extremely excited about what they've gone through and wants more. He says this is what he likes about Buffy, and almost being killed made him feel alive. Buffy realizes that there is no way that she can have a relationship with him; sooner or later, he will get himself killed. With a heavy heart, she breaks up with him.

Giles comforts Buffy about her sacrifices by telling her what a burden it was for him as a ten-year-old to find out his destiny was to be a Watcher when he would rather have been a fighter pilot or possibly a grocer. Both agree that at least the Master will also be unhappy because the Anointed One was killed.

Underground, the Master welcomes the real Anointed One — the young boy from the van.

Continuity[]

After throwing a minion across the room, the Master says, "Here endeth the lesson," which is later spoken by Spike ("Fool for Love") and Buffy ("Showtime").

Buffy and the gang believe they have actually stopped the Anointed One, but they will learn otherwise in "Prophecy Girl."

Giles asserts that he doesn't have an instruction manual; there is a Slayer Handbook, but Giles decided not to use it with Buffy, as he reveals in "What's My Line? Part Two."

Cordelia's line when she sees Angel, "Hello, salty goodness," will be repeated when she reverts back to her teenage persona and first sees Angel in "Spin the Bottle."

Giles mentions his father and his grandmother were Watchers, which is later shown in Tales of the Vampires and Daddy Issues, Part One.

Giles's interest in being a fighter pilot, disrupted by beginning his Watcher studies at the early age of ten, is shown through his great-aunts' memories in Women of a Certain Age.
