        "text": "Charles grinned as he walked along the stream. It was another glorious day. The sun was shining brightly, the birds were singing, and nature was thriving. His mother Demeter, the goddess of harvest and fertility, had been doing her very best work for the humans, especially a small town nearby which Demeter had taken a special liking to. Charles and his mother even stayed in a house in the town whenever they came down from Olympus. Everyone was grateful and happy. Charles and his mother lived a good life and Charles was excited for another brilliant day.\n\nAs Charles was walking he spotted a beautiful yellow flower by the stream. He leaned down to pick the flower, knowing his mother would love to have the beauty in their home.\n\nAs he picked it up, the earth started to shake beneath his feet. Charles fell backward as a huge chasm split open before him. Before he could regain his footing, a giant chariot pulled by black horses thundered out of the split in the earth. Hands grabbed Charles and he screamed as he was dragged down into the Underworld.\n\n*****\n\nEdwin woke up cold...freezing actually. This was particularly confusing because he couldn’t remember the last time he’d been cold. Their town had been blessed by the goddess Demeter and they hadn’t had a full frost in years.\n\nEdwin sat up, pulling his light blanket around his shoulders and marveling at how he could see his breath. He walked into their kitchen where his mom was bent over the very old furnace.\n\n“Mother, what’s happened?” Edwin asked.\n\n“There’s been a terrible frost, the farmers are trying to find a way to salvage what they can…but we might lose most of this crop,” His mother said, turning to look at him with a frown. “I’m going to go assist them, I just wanted to make sure you were warm first.”\n\nHis grandmother had been a demigod, the child of a god and a human. Athena had taken a special interest in Edwin’s great-grandfather and gifted him with a child. Their entire line had been blessed with Athena’s wisdom. Edwin’s mom was the cleverest person he knew, if anyone could figure this out, it was her.\n\n“I can help,” Edwin offered.\n\n“Eat some breakfast, then join us in the field,” His mom said with a smile that didn’t hide the worry in her eyes.\n\n*****\n\n“You can’t keep me here, my mother will find me. She’ll go to my father, Zeus, for help and they’ll come get me,” Charles said, attempting to sound brave.\n\n“What did you say?!” Roared Hades as he stomped towards Charles. Charles instinctively took a few steps back, wanting to keep as much distance between himself and the god of the Underworld as he could.\n\n“My parents will find me,” Charles said, finding resolve in the fact that he fully believed in that.\n\n“First she hides you from me and then she erases me?” Hades said, seeming as if he were talking more to himself than Charles.\n\n“What?” Charles couldn’t help but ask, curious despite the terrifying situation he was in.\n\n“Zeus is not your father, boy, I am,” Hades said, giving him a smile that looked more like a sneer.\n\n“What? No, that’s not possible,” Charles shook his head, stepping backward again.\n\n“It is. I am your father and your mother kept you from me,” Hades sounded sure, he even sounded angry about that fact. Charles' head spun, unable to believe what Hades was saying to him. It just didn't make any sense.\n\n“She wouldn’t lie to me,” Charles said, his voice weak. He and his mother had always been so close and he couldn’t imagine her keeping something this big from him.\n\n“And I would?” Hades asked, his eyes flashing dangerously.\n\n“Um, I, uh, I don’t know,” Charles said, knowing he’d lost control of the conversation and struggling to get it back.\n\n“Your mother has clearly not spent a lot of time disciplining you properly, we shall have to remedy that,” Hades said, giving another sneer as he stalked toward Charles.\n\n*****\n\n“Demeter is gone, so is her son,” His mother told him at dinner that night. Edwin thought about Charles, the beautiful boy with a smile that looked like pure sunshine. Charles kept his distance from the members of the town usually, but the few fleeting interactions Edwin had with him had been pleasant. Charles had been joyful and kind and those moments had created a lightness inside Edwin's heart that hadn't quite ever gone away.\n\n“They’ve gone back to Olympus before, but the world has never frozen over,” Edwin noted with a frown. His mother and the town had been able to erect a few greenhouses, hoping to be able to preserve some of their food. They’d harvested everything that had been close to ripe and were finding ways to preserve that. All they could do now was hope that was enough or that Demeter chased away the cold before they ran out of food.\n\n“I know, it is strange,” His mom said.\n\n“Mother…what if…we’ve lost her favor, what if it never gets warm again?” Edwin asked the question weighing on him.\n\n“We will do everything we can to figure out what happened and regain her favor…but if not, we will find a way to survive,” His mother said, sounding like she believed the words she was saying. Edwin wished he could have the same confidence, but he had a bad feeling. Demeter with her kind eyes and Charles with his bright smile would not have just abandoned them, something terrible must have happened.\n\n*****\n\nCharles was glad the Underworld kept Hades so busy. Charles had days, sometimes weeks, to himself to wander around the god’s palace. Hades would visit Charles occasionally, trying to fill in what was apparently missing in Charles’ education.\n\nHades was cruel, quick to lash out with his tongue and quick to violence. It seemed to Charles that he spent their talks just waiting for the opportunity to teach Charles a new lesson.\n\nCharles had no idea how long he’d been down here for. It could’ve been months or years. Time had no meaning in this horrible, barren place. Charles couldn’t figure out why his mother had not come for him yet. Surely she did not intend to leave him here to suffer. Even if Hades was his father, his mother hadn’t wanted him to know about it, so that must mean she wanted to keep Hades out of his life.\n\nCharles went outside and sat on the steps of the palace. In the far-off distance, he could see the River Styx and he could hear the sound of souls moaning in pain or confusion. Closer he saw the orchard of pomegranate trees that Hades kept. It was the one piece of green that Charles was allowed to visit. He found himself avoiding it, however, because in a strange way, it made him even more homesick.\n\nHe’d walk amongst the trees and notice how silent the air was without the gurgle of the stream or the tweet of the birds. He’d notice how rocky and hard the ground felt beneath his feet and how artificial the perfect lines of trees looked.\n\nWalking through the orchard just made him miss home because it was close, but not the same as walking through the forest near the town he and his mother loved.\n\nCharles pulled his knees up to his chest as pessimistic thoughts threatened to overwhelm him. He’d tried hard to remain positive and hopeful throughout this experience, but as more time went on, the more he feared he’d never be free of this awful place.\n\nHe thought about the days he’d spent wandering around with his mother and watching the townsfolk work diligently in the fields from sunup to sundown. He thought about his mother’s warnings to keep a distance between them and the humans. If gods interacted too closely and too often with humans that could lead to imbalances of power. Of the humans no longer seeing the gods as powerful immortal beings but as their friends and feeling as if they were equals.\n\nCharles thought about a particular boy with forest-green eyes who’d looked at Charles with the same awe they all did, but behind that was something Charles couldn’t quite place. The boy had made Charles feel truly seen for the first time. Charles had been intrigued, but he’d heeded his mother’s warnings and kept away.\n\nNow, as he curled up on the steps of Hades’ horrible palace, Charles wished he had taken the chance to talk to the boy when he could.\n\n*****\n\nThere was a charged feeling in the air when Edwin stepped into his house. He looked in shock at the three women sitting at their kitchen table. His mother, Demeter, and a beautiful woman that Edwin hadn't met before but based on the green eyes that matched both his and his mother’s, he had a guess as to her identity.\n\n“Mother, Demeter, Athena, it’s an honor,” Edwin said. It had been nearly six months since Demeter had disappeared without a trace. His town was suffering and from what he’d heard, everywhere else was the same. Edwin forced himself to push down his anger with Demeter. She was a goddess, as was Athena, and it never was good to anger or question the gods.\n\n“Clever boy, have a seat,” Athena said, sweeping her arm gracefully toward the spare chair. Edwin sat down, looking at his mom as he did so. She looked stressed and worried, but not alarmed.\n\n“I am sorry to have left you all,” Demeter said, putting her hand on his arm. She seemed genuinely apologetic and when Edwin looked closer he could see tears shining in her eyes.\n\n“What has happened?” Edwin asked, glancing between them. His heart broke for the pain and sadness he could see in Demeter’s dark eyes.\n\n“It’s Charles, he’s been taken…by his father,” Demeter said and Edwin’s stomach did a flip.\n\n“By Zeus?” Edwin’s mother asked with a furrowed brow.\n\n“No, I am ashamed to admit that was a lie,” Demeter hung her head in shame. “One that Zeus allowed me to tell because it was better than everyone knowing that his father was….Hades.”\n\n“Hades…” Edwin said slowly. “He’s been taken to the Underworld?”\n\n“Yes, it took me a long time to figure out what happened. I wander the earth searching for my boy, too heartbroken to summon the strength to bring the harvest. Finally, a god who’d seen it happen told me that Hades had broken through the earth and kidnapped Charles. I tried everything to get him back. I attempted to travel to the Underworld myself, I petitioned Zeus and other gods for their help, but to no avail,” Demeter broke off with a sob.\n\n“It is tricky,” Athena picked up. “For us gods to get involved in each other’s affairs. If we are seen picking sides it could quickly escalate to a war.\"\n\n“What exactly are you asking of me?” Edwin said, although he already knew.\n\n“We thought about finding a demigod to complete the task, but your line has been graced by Athena, and Charles favored you,” Demeter said looking at him imploringly.\n\n“He…what?” Edwin stammered, taken aback.\n\n“We will help you find your way into the Underworld and give you tools to help with your journey,” Demeter continued as if he hadn’t spoken.\n\n“Wait just one moment, please,” Edwin’s mother interjected.\n\n“Mother, it’s alright,” Edwin said looking at her, having already made up his mind. “People are going to starve if we can’t harvest food and that won’t happen until Charles is safely returned. There’s no choice really.”\n\n“You remind me of your great-grandfather,” Athena said with a smile. Edwin didn’t exactly know how to respond to that so he simply nodded.\n\n*****\n\n“Why do you want me?” Charles asked one day when he could no longer hold the thought back. Hades turned to look at him in surprise.\n\n“What?”\n\n“You don’t seem to like me or enjoy spending time with me, why go through all of the effort to kidnap me and risk angering the other gods?”\n\n“I do not care what the other gods think,” Hades scoffed.\n\n“Lord Hades, why am I here?” Charles used the name his father wanted to be called by because he knew he was testing it with these questions.\n\n“Because you are my son.”\n\n“I’ve been your son for 16 years,” Charles pointed out. He knew in an instant that he had pushed too far. Hades’ eyes flashed and he came over to where Charles was sitting.\n\n“You,” Hades gripped Charles’ hair and pulled his head back so he was looking into his eyes. “Are mine. You belong to me and no one else.” Hades released Charles’ hair and stepped back, watching Charles as if waiting to see if he’d rise to the bait. Charles knew he should leave it. He knew he should nod his head and bite his tongue, but the anger he’d been pushing down since he'd been taken forced its way out.\n\n“I don’t belong to anyone. And what about my mother, what about Demeter? I’m just as much your son as I am hers,” Charles said, launching to his feet. In a movement too fast for him to follow, Hades backhanded him, sending him crashing to the floor. Charles spat out blood and attempted to regain his footing, but Hades was there, pressing a boot into his back. Charles collapsed back down to the floor, feeling his ribs shift under the pressure of his father's foot.\n\n“Don’t you ever speak about that betrayer again. This is your world now and the quicker you can accept that, the better it will be for you,” Hades growled.\n\nCharles didn’t respond and after a few moments, Hades removed his foot and stomped away. Charles put his head against the cold floor as tears fell from his eyes. He didn't know how he'd ever learn to accept this world.\n\n*****\n\nEdwin examined the map Athena had given him again. He had no idea how she’d gotten it, but it was remarkably accurate. It had allowed him to sneak into the very depths of the Underworld without being noticed.\n\nEdwin had made it to the palace, now all that was left was to wait for Hades to leave and then find Charles. Athena had promised she’d find a way to keep Hades busy. Edwin wasn’t sure what that was, but he trusted Athena.\n\nTime was strange in the Underworld, but Edwin waited a frustratingly long time for Hades to leave. He was just starting to think that maybe Hades had already left when the god came storming out of his palace. A black chariot with dark horses pulled up. Hades jumped on and sped away.\n\nEdwin forced himself to count to 100 before he made his way into the palace. He crept along the dark corridors looking and listening for any signs of life. A soft cough led him to a hallway and the flickering light at the end of it urged him on.\n\nEdwin entered the room and breathed a sigh of relief as his gaze fell on Charles who was curled up in a chair by a fire. Charles had been staring into the fire, but his eyes whipped around when Edwin stepped into the room.\n\n“You,” Charles breathed. He was pale, had a bruise on his cheek, and his eyes were dull, but beneath that, he was just as beautiful as Edwin remembered.\n\n“What did he do to you?” Edwin said, forgetting himself at the sight of Charles’ battered form.\n\n“What are you doing here, you can’t be here.” Quicker than Edwin would have thought possible, Charles had moved to grip him by the shoulders and dragged him off to the side, away from the entrance to the room. Edwin’s back hit the wall and he forced himself to keep his gaze steady on Charles’ frantic eyes.\n\n“I’m here to bring you home. Your mother and Athena sent me,” Edwin explained.\n\n“I thought…I thought she’d abandoned me,” Charles whispered. He didn’t release Edwin, but he relaxed his grip and moved backward slightly.\n\n“She’s been looking for you for months, then she had to figure out to retrieve you from Hades’ grasp,” Edwin said. At the mention of Hades, Charles stepped back, running his hand through his hair as he paced.\n\n“You are in danger, you need to leave, if he-”\n\n“Athena is distracting him,” Edwin said steadily. “I got in here, did I not? I can get us out.”\n\n“Why you? You’re a mortal,” Charles said, turning back to study him. He didn’t spit the word ‘mortal’ out as other gods might’ve, instead, he said it as if it were something precious.\n\n“Athena has blessed my family line, and your mom said they needed someone who wasn’t a god,” Edwin explained, his face heating up as Charles’ dark eyes raked over him.\n\n“Yes, but did it have to be you? They could’ve sent anyone,” Charles groaned. Edwin knew that he was not saying it would be better if it was someone else. He remembered how Demeter had said Charles had favored Edwin.\n\n“Possibly,” Edwin said, stepping towards Charles. “But they picked me.” Charles’ eyes flashed dangerously and Edwin was suddenly reminded that he was a god. He’d been so distracted by the bruised and broken Charles that he’d forgotten for a moment. Edwin froze in his tracks. “Forgive me, I do not mean to sound abrupt, it’s simply that, we must leave.”\n\n“You must leave. I must stay,” Charles said sternly. Edwin wasn’t sure why he was refusing to leave. Perhaps he was worried for Edwin’s safety or perhaps he didn’t think they could make it and feared for his own. Whatever it was, Edwin had to find a way around it.\n\n“Charles, your mother is suffering. She’s too heartbroken to bring the harvest. A cold has settled across the world. Our crops are dying and soon people will be dying. We need you back,” Edwin said as he took another hesitant step closer to Charles.\n\n“I…” Charles ran another frustrated hand through his hair and Edwin studiously ignored the way his eyes involuntarily followed the movement. “I am sorry people are suffering, but they’ll find a way to adapt and survive, they always do.”\n\n“Don’t you want to leave?” Edwin asked, stepping forward again so he was in arms reach of Charles.\n\n“Yes, but Hades, my father…he’ll find me and I don’t want you, or anyone, getting hurt,” Charles said in a hoarse whisper.\n\n“And what about me if you don’t come back?” Edwin asked. He took another step forward and gathered Charles’ hands in his. It was a bold move, one that he would not normally do with another human, let alone a god, but he couldn’t help but feel this intense connection with Charles. Something was drawing them together and he was pretty sure Charles felt it too.\n\n“What do you mean?” Charles asked, looking from their joined hands back up into Edwin’s eyes. Electricity buzzed in the air around them.\n\n“You don’t want anyone to get hurt, well what about me if I have to live the rest of my life without you, without getting to know you? Those few times we spoke left me breathless for days. Your smile is like sunshine and it always brightened up my entire day, even when I saw it from afar. I don’t think I would be able to survive the thought of you down here, alone and miserable in this horrible place,” Edwin said, the words spilling out before he could second guess them. He might’ve felt embarrassed in any other situation, but a slow smile spread across Charles’ face, banishing the fears from his brain.\n\n“I liked the way you looked at me,” Charles admitted and now it was he who was moving further into Edwin’s space. “All the others, they looked at me and saw a god or the son of the goddess who was so kind to them. They always had awe and a healthy dose of fear in their eyes.” Charles said with a wink and, gods help him, Edwin nearly crashed to the floor. Charles pulled their hands apart and reached up to cup Edwin’s face.\n\n“And what did I have in my eyes when I looked at you,” Edwin whispered, slightly surprised he could form a sentence.\n\n“Oh you had awe, but there was no fear. Instead, it was as if you could see right through me. You didn’t just see me as another god, you saw me for who I am,” Charles said, his breath ghosting across Edwin’s face as he spoke.\n\n“You are so joyful, always smiling, laughing, and cheering people up. And you are unbelievably sweet and kind. I once saw you stop and help a child who’d fallen and scraped her knee. By the time she went running back to her parents, she was giggling instead of crying. Yes, you kept your distance, just like all of the gods do, but I never got the impression it was because you thought you were better than us,” Edwin said. He forced himself to look up into Charles’ endless eyes. Those dark brown eyes were looking at him intensely and for a moment Edwin worried he’d said the wrong thing, then Charles’ eyes closed and his lips crashed against his.\n\nEdwin has been kissed before. First, by a girl he’d thought he’d liked right up until she’d kissed him. Then, by the only other boy like him in the town. Neither of those experiences could hold a candle to how Charles was kissing him right now. In fact, Edwin wasn’t sure if he could even call those kisses, they were nothing in the realm of what it felt like to be kissing Charles.\n\nCharles’ mouth was warm against his. He kissed with passion and with hunger, but he somehow managed to be soft at the same time. He didn't overwhelm Edwin, merely filled up his senses. Everything around him faded away until the only thing Edwin was aware of was Charles’ hands on his face, his lips on his own, and the sound of their gasping breaths in between kisses.\n\nWhen Charles finally dragged his mouth away, Edwin was dizzy and breathless.\n\n“Okay,” Charles said, resting their foreheads together and breathing heavily. “I’ll go with you.”\n\n*****\n\nIt was a bad idea. Charles knew it was a bad idea, even as he let Edwin take his hand and lead him away. Charles wasn’t really sure what the boy had done to his brain, but he seemed to have turned it to mush. A few beautiful, kind words and Charles had been a goner.\n\nEdwin navigated the twists and turns of the Underworld like he’d been here a dozen times. He held a map in the hand that wasn’t firmly clasped in Charles’ and used it to guide them through. Anytime there was a noise, Charles would jump and freeze on the spot and Edwin would squeeze his hand and coax him on.\n\nCharles almost burst into tears when he caught his first glimpse of daylight at the end of the tunnel. Edwin turned and grinned at him and Charles actually did start crying.\n\n“It’s okay, we are almost there,” Edwin said, moving quicker now. Charles allowed himself to be dragged to the opening of the cave, but when Edwin stepped out into the light, he did not follow. Edwin turned around in confusion, tugging on their hands. Charles yanked his free and stepped back.\n\n“I’m afraid this is where I leave you, Edwin,” Charles said, the tears now flowing freely.\n\n“What? Charles, whatever are you talking about,” Edwin said, stepping back into the cave. As gently as possible, Charles put his hands up and pushed Edwin back out into the light.\n\n“I made a mistake. He…he tricked me, I can’t,” Charles cried. Edwin resolutely stepped back into the cave and cupped Charles’ face in his hand, brushing away the tears with his thumbs, which only served to make Charles cry harder.\n\n“What happened?” Edwin asked softly. “Talk to me. We can’t fix it unless you talk to me.”\n\n“We can’t fix it,” Charles said desperately, but he found himself explaining anyway. Who was he to say no to those beautiful eyes? “Hades gave me some of the pomegranate seeds from his orchard. I was so desperate for a taste of fresh fruit, the taste of home, and I didn’t question it. But…they are the fruit of the underworld and once you have consumed them…you must remain in the underworld forever.”\n\n“What? Why didn’t you tell me this earlier?” Edwin asked, he didn’t sound angry, merely heartbroken.\n\n“I had to get you out, I had to get you to safety,” Charles explained. He pulled Edwin’s hands from his face, kissing each of his palms before dropping them and stepping away. “So you need to leave, there’s nothing that can be done for me now.”\n\n“No, wait, Charles,” Edwin pleaded. “Just let me try. Maybe your mother or Athena will have a way out of this. Please, let me try.” Charles did not want any false hope, he’d resigned himself to his fate and needed to find a way to live with it. But now, looking into Edwin’s eyes, Charles recognized the look. It was the look of a man who would do anything to protect his loved ones. Charles couldn’t find it in himself to deny him one last chance to try.\n\n“Very well, but promise me, if this does not work you will leave me here and never return,” Charles said. Edwin looked startled at his words. He looked at Charles carefully and once he’d realized he was serious he nodded.\n\n“I promise,” Edwin said. Charles was not entirely sure that he believed him, but he’d find a way to keep Edwin out of the Underworld if it came to that. “Just, wait here for me,” Edwin said, leaning forward and kissing Charles on the cheek.\n\nCharles watched as Edwin stepped outside into the sunshine. He admired the way it lit up his brown hair and accented the planes of his face. Edwin called out for Demeter and Athena but Charles kept his focus on Edwin, wanting to memorize every detail he could.\n\nWhen Athena and his mother appeared, Charles was surprised to see that they weren’t alone. Zeus was with them in all of his terrifying beauty and power. Edwin explained the situation and Charles felt all eyes turn to him.\n\n“Mother, I am sorry, I was foolish,” Charles rushed to say.\n\n“Hush now boy, I am at fault as well for keeping your father a secret. I should’ve prepared you better.”\n\n“I will intercede on your behalf,” Zeus said. Charles was momentarily surprised until Zeus continued to speak. “The humans will surely perish if this frost continues and it will not relent until your mother has you back.” And that explained it, Zeus needed his adoring humans to keep him powerful and to keep him entertained.\n\nZeus vanished and Edwin stepped back into the cave, his arms went around Charles in a way that felt both completely natural and like something totally new.\n\n“I’ll keep you safe,” Edwin whispered into his ear. Charles wanted to scoff, because how could a mortal protect a god? But at the moment Charles was feeling fragile and he had to admit it felt safe in Edwin’s arms.\n\n“I will do the same for you,” Charles promised because no matter what happened, he knew he would protect this precious boy.\n\n*****\n\nEdwin looked down at the curly-haired god who lay curled up against him. He felt a little dizzy thinking about the turn his life had taken, but he wouldn’t change it for the world. Demeter sat in a chair next to the bed, holding her son’s hand and reading to them.\n\nZeus had negotiated for six months on Earth with them and six months in the Underground with Hades. It had been far from ideal. Edwin didn’t want Charles to have to spend another second with that horrible being, but it had been the best they could get. At the end of the day, any time with Charles was better than no time at all.\n\nDemeter had agreed with this sentiment. As soon as Charles had stepped free of the cave she’d gathered him in her arms and the air had heated up around them.\n\nThe townspeople had welcomed them all back with open arms and cries of joy. They’d thrown a festival in their honor. Demeter, the goddess who brought back the warmth. Charles, the god who brought back joy to Demeter. And Edwin, the boy who’d brought back the god. They were all touched by the celebration but declined to attend. Charles needed to rest and all Edwin and Demeter wanted to do was make sure he was okay.\n\nDemeter had tended to his wounds and then put him to bed. Edwin had been unsure of his role and tried to leave gracefully. Charles had merely rolled his eyes and pulled Edwin down onto the bed with him, snuggling up to his side in a way that made Edwin never want to move again.\n\nDemeter’s soothing voice drifted over them and Edwin carded his fingers through Charles’ hair. Charles looked up at him with a sleepy but bright smile. Edwin desperately wanted to kiss him but it felt too strange with his mother there.\n\n“There’s that sunshine smile,” Edwin said instead, giving a smile of his own.\n\n“There’s the boy who sees me,” Charles said in return. Edwin made a vow to himself right then and there that he would figure out a way to break the pomegranate curse. He didn’t care how long it took or how impossible it seemed, he would find a way to make sure that Charles could remain in the sunshine where he belonged forever."
