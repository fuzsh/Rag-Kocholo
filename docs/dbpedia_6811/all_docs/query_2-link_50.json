It is a literature that not only intertextualizes elements of the vernacular tradition (spirituals, folktales and the blues) and its own immediate past but is a regenerative force of conscious construction and literary beauty within the history of American literature. The goal of this course is to investigate the transformational power of Black imagination and artistic genius within social and political contexts. Students will gain an understanding of and appreciation for the creative dexterity and conventions of this literature. The period covered begins with Lucy Terry’s 1746 “Bars Fight” and ends with the Harlem Renaissance. Although chronology is obscured by a focus on genre, readings are arranged so that students can trace the development of various genres and various styles, themes, images, and structures across time and within individual author’s works. In this way, the course emphasizes the creative process, intertextuality, and literary history.\n\nAML 4170\n\nAfrofuturism\n\nJulia Mollenthiel\n\nThis interdisciplinary course is an examination of literary and artistic forms of Afrofuturism. Students will engage in close examination of texts by Afrofuturists from both academic and popular realms that may include fiction and non-fiction, in addition to non-print sources such as film and music. We will probe the genre of Afrofuturism and its tenets with a particular focus on representations of race and sexuality through time travel, aliens and space, robots, and more. We will consider the relationship between science fiction, African American history, and African diasporic literary traditions including dystopian and utopian visions of the past and future. We will also consider the various ways in which technology intersects with race and how Black artists use science fiction to challenge hegemonic systems of oppression.\n\nAML 4282\n\nEarly LGBTQ Literatures\n\nJodi Schorb\n\nThis course familiarizes students with the long tradition of LGBT literature before what we might call the “invention of homosexuality.”\n\nNow we take for granted the phrase “sexual identity,” but this concept itself has a history. The belief that sexuality is a core component of a person’s identity emerged out of specific historical, cultural, and scientific developments, and the words “homosexuality” and “heterosexuality” were not even coined until 1869 and 1880 respectively. The literary (and real) world has always been a place of abundant sexual diversity, gender variance, and same-sex love and sex: yet the cultural meanings of what we know call “homosexuality” shifts across space and time.\n\nAfter an overview of influential Western traditions that helped shape a legible tradition of LGBTQ writing in English, the course will focus intensely (but not exclusively) on queer identity-formation in nineteenth-century American literature. Through a blend of cultural history and close literary analysis, students will analyze the literary representation of same-sex desire and theorize how a text’s queer elements generate thematic purpose and meaning.\n\nMost crucially, we will explore how pre twentieth-century individuals sought to articulate same sex love without access to a shared language or shared cultural codes. Sometimes writers looked backward to express and legitimate same-sex desire (drawing especially from classical myth and the Bible); others looked forward, developing an emergent language of sexuality and queer futurity.\n\nLikely readings will be drawn from: Ovid, Metamorphosis; Plato, Symposium; the King James Bible; Békotsidi’s “Song of Blessing” and other aikane and two-spirit songs; William Shakespeare, sonnets; anon., Don Leon; Anne Lister, Diaries; periodical fiction such as “The Man who Thought Himself a Woman” (1857), Mary E. Wilkins Freeman’s “Two Friends” and other nineteenth-century short stories; letters by Alexander Hamilton, Herman Melville, Addie Brown, and others; Walt Whitman, Leaves of Grass; poetry by Emily Dickinson; Oscar Wilde, De Profundis; case studies by European sexologists; and the Digital Transgender Archive. We’ll also read a contemporary novel immersed in this archival history, Blackouts, by Justin Torres, the recipient of the 2023 National Book Award for fiction.\n\nExpect to gain historical knowledge as well as improved skills in critical reading, reading, and literary analysis. Assignments will likely include two analytical essays (4-7 pages), a group creative project; and periodic homework such as discussion board posts, research activities, and first-person reflections.\n\nAML 4311\n\nThe World of James Baldwin and Critical Intersectionality\n\nMark A. Reid\n\nThis course employs an interdisciplinary approach that requires students to familiarize themselves with James Baldwin’s literary and sociopolitical writings. The course expects that students apply critical race theory in their analysis. Such theorizing will borrow from writing by scholars as Frank B. Wilderson III, Jared Sexton, Saidiya Hartman, Calvin Warren and essayists like Ta-Nehisi Coates. Class discussion and written work will discern whether there exists evidence of Afro-Pessimism and or postNegritude moments in Baldwin’s oeuvre that easily dismisses postracial fantasies and the machination of neoliberal gestures.\n\nReadings, class discussions, and film screened will critically surveys James Baldwin’s writings, lectures, and selected biographies that explore Baldwin’s life in the United States, France, and Turkey. Baldwin was engaged in the socio-political world that surrounded and sometimes consumed his artistic and moral energies. He was active in the U.S. Civil Rights movement and international concerns about the construction of nation, race, and sexuality. One critic wrote of Baldwin in these words: “Following publication of Notes of a Native Son and The Fire Next Time, James Baldwin’s literary star approached its peak during the turbulent 1960s. His burgeoning role as celebrity, prophet, and leader heaped an unsustainable amount of pressure and responsibility onto his slight frame in an American landscape that doubly punished Baldwin for being both black and gay, and he often turned to Turkey for sanctuary”.\n\nThis course will reveal the artistry, compassion, and moral commitment of one of America’s greatest writers. Students will critically study how James Baldwin fared as an American writer and social critic. and how critical race theory might reveal or deny the persistence of anti-Black violence in words and deeds. Class discussion will consider how Baldwin imaginatively exposed and fervently articulated the coming consciousness that generates “Black Lives Matter” awareness and endgame.\n\nAML 4311\n\nEdith Wharton\n\nStephanie A. Smith\n\nLike her older friend, the writer Henry James, Edith Wharton née Jones (1862-1937) was a writer’s writer and a novelist’s novelist, a supreme chronicler of her era, now called The Gilded Age. Born into a wealthy, New York City family, she grew up among the American aristocracy of the City, which she would skewer in her novels; at the late age of twenty-three she married Edward (Teddy) Wharton but the marriage didn’t last; Teddy’s mental health had never been stable and it slowly fell apart; Wharton was granted a divorce in 1913, which was unusual for a woman at this time and she moved permanently to Paris. Wharton also won the first Pulitzer prize awarded to a woman and was given an honorary doctorate by Yale; during WWI, instead of retreating into her wealth, she became a war correspondent and a humanitarian and was awarded the Legion of Honor by France in 1916. In this class we’ll read a selection of Edith Wharton’s most important works starting with The House of Mirth (1905) in a reexamination of this major American author from the perspective of the 21st century. For more about the author see https://www.edithwharton.org/discover/edith-wharton/\n\nAML 4453\n\nOn the Road: Representations of America Through European Eyes\n\nEric Kligerman\n\nThis interdisciplinary seminar explores how both American and European writers represent the concept of the American Dream in 20th and 21st century literature and visual media. We will situate iconic works of American literature (Fitzgerald, Kerouac, Baldwin, Didion, Delillo and Coates) next to how the American dream is experienced by European writers and filmmakers, including Kafka, Adorno, Brecht, Nabokov, Baudrillard and Herzog. How has the American dream been re-imagined and represented by European writers and artists?\n\nAML 4453\n\nThe Pen & the Penitentiary: U.S. Prison Literature in History\n\nJodi Schorb\n\nBeginning in the 1780s, American prison reformers participated in a transatlantic debate about the value and promise of reformative incarceration. These debates and reforms birthed the modern prison and its enormous historical, cultural, and literary legacy. This course analyzes the role of the prison in American literature and the impactful contributions of inmate authors (poetry, fiction, life writing, letters.)\n\nReadings are drawn from three areas: the birth and evolution of the US penitentiary (primary and secondary sources), secondary scholarship on the prison from the interdisciplinary field of prison studies, and literature that emerges out of the prison—with a strong emphasis on culturally significant work by incarcerated or formerly incarcerated writers.\n\nStudents who complete this course will gain substantial understanding of how the first “modern” US prisons were envisioned: by whom, and for what purposes. They will understand scholarly claims and also make their own original arguments as to how the prison (as material space, as cultural icon, as theoretical idea) impacted the development of American literature. They will gain tools and skills to analyze how incarcerated writers represent the experience of imprisonment to outside readers. Students will also have opportunity to conduct hands-on research in primary archives such as JSTOR’s American Prison Newspapers 1800- and Doran Larson’s American Prison Writing Archive.\n\nLikely readings include: Austen Reed, Life and Memoirs of a Haunted Convict; short stories by Edgar Allen Poe; selections from Nathaniel Hawthorne; Julian Hawthorn, “If Not Prisons, What?”; Martin Luther King “Letter from a Birmingham Jail”; Leonard Peltier, My Life is a Sun Dance; Etheridge Knight, Poems from Prison; Mariam Kaba, “Justice”; Reginald Dwayne Betts, Felon; poetry by Jimmy Santiago Baca and Catherine LaFleur (Florida’s current Luis Angel Hernandez Prison Poet Laureate), and secondary readings by Angela Davis, Joy James, Michel Foucault, and others.\n\nAssignments include first-person reflections on the course materials, at least two 4-7 page essays, a shorter archival research and discovery project, and periodical homework/discussion boards/group work.\n\nCRW 3110\n\nAdvanced Seminar in Fiction Writing\n\nKathryn Blasco Soler\n\nTBA\n\nCRW 4211\n\nCreative Non-Fiction\n\nMichael Hofmann\n\nA course on writing about people and places. The reading-list might have been drawn from nature writing or science or biography, but I have come down in favour of a mulch of history, geography and politics, from an array of cult authors and Nobel laureates including Ryszard Kapuscinski, Andrzej Stasiuk, Joseph Roth, Svetlana Alexievich, Joan Didion, Bruce Chatwin, and Annie Ernaux, among possibly others. Spoken contributions will be encouraged. Participants will do much writing of and on their own, either on several different projects, or perhaps on a single task. Reading and writing, research and style, should all benefit. (I would rather you came wanting to write a book about cuttlefish than on the first twenty years – or indeed the first six months – of your lives, but the latter may be allowable under certain circumstances; I should like it, however, not to preponderate.)\n\nCRW 4905\n\nSenior Advanced Fiction Workshop\n\nChloe Lane\n\nCRW 4906\n\nElegies and Odes\n\nAnge Mlinko\n\nIn this advanced workshop, we will read elegies and odes across languages and time periods. Then we will write our own, paying particular attention to the methods devised by poets as different as Sappho and Emily Dickinson, Derek Walcott and Les Murray, Frank O’Hara and Rainier Maria Rilke. This course will involve close-reading and annotating individual poems, and writing answer poems and imitations. Workshops are small, intense, and cover a lot of ground—just like poems.\n\nENC 3312\n\nAdvanced Argumentative Writing\n\nSayantika Chakraborty\n\nIn this course, you will receive practice and instruction in argumentative writing by studying the relationship between gender inequality and climate change. Focusing on indigenous and tribal communities, we will examine how women are uniquely vulnerable to ecological disasters by discussing issues of consumption, waste, reproduction, and migration.\n\nTexts may include The Ministry for the Future by Kim Stanley Robinson (2020), “Sunshine State” by Adam Flynn and Andrew Dana Hudson (2016), The Woman who Thought she was a Planet by Vandana Singh (2008), and films such as Don’t Look Up (2021). Writing assignments may include an annotated bibliography, an argumentative essay, as well as short and informal discussion posts.\n\nENG 3121\n\nHistory of Film 1\n\nPietro Bianchi\n\nAt first, there were shadowgraphy, shadow puppetry, camera obscura, and the magic lantern: different devices that used moving imagery for entertainment and storytelling. However, it was only at the end of the 19th century that Thomas Edison in New Jersey found out that if you put some still images on a roll and spin these images in a box, they give the illusion of movement. It was only a matter of months, and in 1895, the Lumière brothers in France invented the Cinematograph, the first type of motion picture film mechanism. Film was born.\n\nIn this course, we will reflect on the invention of cinema and learn what happened during the first few decades of its life: years when a few audacious artists, technicians, and entrepreneurs invented an art form from scratch, with no one to look up to. After a couple of weeks where we will study the predecessors to film and the historical context of the late 19th century (interestingly film was invented around the same years of the telephone, the phonograph, electricity, the automobile, and psychoanalysis) we will analyze film’s commercial expansion, the first great actors and directors and the first few years of Hollywood, the artistic development in German expressionism and Soviet montage and the advent of sound in the late 1920s.\n\nWe will see films by the Lumière Brothers, Georges Méliès, Edwin S. Porter, D. W. Griffith, King Vidor, Erich von Stroheim, Harold Lloyd, Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Fritz Lang, John Ford, Robert Wiene, F. W. Murnau, Alexander Dovzhenko, Sergei Eisenstein and Augusto Genina.\n\nThe class has a weekly mandatory screening and will heavily rely on in-class discussions (a strong emphasis will be given on active participation). Course assignments include weekly posts on Canvas, a 5-minute presentation, two in-class quizzes, and a final in-class paper.\n\nENG 4015\n\nPsychological Approaches to Literature: Atoms and the Void\n\nPeter Rudnytsky\n\nIn his philosophical poem On the Nature of Things, Lucretius (c. 99-55 BCE) dares to think the unthinkable: the gods take no interest in human affairs, the soul dies, there is no afterlife, the universe consists of atoms in an infinite void, and the highest goal of human life is the pleasure that comes from ridding oneself of delusions and the deep wonder that comes from seeing things clearly. In this course, we will begin by reading Stephen Greenblatt’s The Swerve, which tells the gripping story of how the discovery in 1417 of a manuscript of Lucretius’s poem, which had been lost for more than a thousand years, ushered in the modern world. We will then take up the challenge of the poem itself, before examining the tensions between Epicureanism and Christianity in Thomas More’s Utopia. We will conclude by attempting to see our own realities clearly with the aid of Timothy Snyder’s Our Malady: Lessons in Liberty from a Hospital Diary and Michiko Kakutani’s The Death of Truth: Notes on Falsehood in the Age of Trump. Course requirements are a midterm, final, and one five-page paper. Regular attendance and active participation in class discussions are also expected.\n\nENG 4133\n\nCinema of the Global South\n\nPietro Bianchi\n\nIn 1969, Argentine filmmakers Fernando Solanas and Octavio Getino wrote a manifesto called Hacia un tercer cine (Toward a Third Cinema), in which they examined the complex nexus of cinema, politics, and filmmaking practices. They called for a cinema that would reject both Hollywood commercial movies and bourgeois European art films. This marked the beginning of third cinema: a film movement that expressed anti-colonial and anti-capitalist sentiments, as well as a new collective-oriented filmmaking practice. It became a point of reference for decades of political and experimental cinema in the Global South.\n\nThis course offers a critical approach and diverse mapping strategies for the study of cinema in the Global South, with all its differences and complexities. Students will be introduced to theoretical debates about the global circulation of films, aesthetics, audiences, authorship, and concepts of the transnational. The first section of the course will analyze some of the most important films of Third Cinema (such as La Hora de Los Hornos by Fernando Solanas and Octavio Getino, Memorias del Subdesarrollo by Tomás Gutiérrez Alea, and Antonio das Mortes by Glauber Rocha). In the second section, we will discuss several filmmakers who revolutionized cinema in the Global South during the 1970s and 1980s (including Assia Djebar, Haile Gerima, Ousmane Sembène, Djibril Diop Mambéty, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Abbas Kiarostami, and Yilmaz Güney). Finally, the last section of the class will focus on contemporary filmmakers (such as Jia Zhang-ke, Anurag Kashyap, Nuri Bilge Ceylan, Pablo Larraín, Elia Suleiman, Lucrecia Martel, Lisandro Alonso and Lav Diaz).\n\nThe class includes a mandatory weekly screening and will heavily rely on in-class discussions (with a strong emphasis on active participation). Course assignments include weekly posts on Canvas, a 5-minute presentation, two in-class quizzes, and a final in-class paper.\n\nENG 4133\n\nShakespeare and Film\n\nRichard Burt\n\nWe will watch film adaptations of Shakespeare’s The Taming of the Shrew, Titus Andronicus, Romeo and Juliet, Othello, King Lear, Hamlet, and Macbeth. Requirements: Class participation; co-lead class discussion twice; a Film Clip Exercise; two 500-700 word papers; and two discussion questions and three shot analyses for each class.\n\nENG 4134\n\nWomen and Fashion in French Cinema\n\nSylvie Blum\n\nThe class is tailored around the history of women’s fashion and style in French cinema. The class spans the twentieth century. The material bridges different areas of fashion and film studies. Through various readings and film screenings, you will acquire the necessary tools and terminology to decode the system. Areas covered include advertising, architecture, the art of the couturière, fabric, cuisine, film costume, sustainable fashion and taste. The class is designed for third + fourth year students who are already versed in exploring and analyzing certain literary and cultural texts. It might be an introduction to film for some of you who have never taken a film class. You will familiarize yourselves with the proper terminology and acquire knowledge in a field that is rich in historical, artistic, and cultural markers. The readings contain biographical and personal narratives, as well as theoretical and cultural essays about the topic. The screenings return to early silent, and then classical French cinema, and later include recent documentaries and popular fiction films sometimes from different nations with links to French fashion.\n\nENG 4135\n\nIntroduction to Israeli Cinema\n\nRoy Holler\n\nIsraeli cinema may not feature the usual superhero fanfare or the dazzle of Hollywood special effects, lacking the grandiose budgets, zombies, epic battles, and big-name stars. But what Israeli films lack in glitz, they compensate with heart: rich with stories of trauma and memory, love and loss, spanning narratives from the front lines of war to the rare moments of peace. Israeli films tackle racial, gender, and geopolitical tensions, capturing personal tales as well as narratives that resonate across the nation. Crucially, they offer an authentic portrayal of Israeli identity and provide deep insights into the distinct Middle Eastern landscape of the Israeli-Arab conflict.\n\nFilms will be pre-screened, with additional titles available for home viewing. Students will be expected to submit weekly film reviews, write a midterm paper and work on a group presentation for their final project.\n\nENG 4146\n\nLong-Form Filmmaking\n\nTrevor Mowchun\n\nAs advertised, this course will be a bold venture through the artistic, technical and temporal challenges of long-form/feature filmmaking (and by temporal I mean there is only one semester to complete this monumental task). No doubt this will be a collaborative undertaking; however, it will also involve delegation and specialization. In other words, students with an interest in screenwriting will have an opportunity to work on the script; students with an interest in producing and/or directing can be more involved in these roles; those interested in acting will be able to focus on that great and mysterious art, and so on. Likely, everyone will have to do a bit of everything. The instructor will oversee the process from script to screen, steering the ship away from familiar routes of passage into the uncharted and creatively liberating waters of film.\n\n*Additional meetings outside of class may be required.\n\n*Registration for this course is restricted to those students who hold the prerequisite: ENG 4136, the introductory filmmaking course. Interested students who lack the prerequisite should contact the instructor at tmowchun@ufl.edu\n\nENG 4310\n\nThe European Road Movie\n\nHolly Raynard\n\nLike its American predecessor, the European road film has typically served as a powerful vehicle for cultural criticism, personal introspection and transformation. Yet the European map—replete with national borders, linguistic differences and imposing barriers like the Berlin Wall—hardly evokes the open road of America’s mythical frontier, where a traveler can venture some 3000 miles without a foreign phrasebook, passport, visa or police authorization. Migration, deportations, and social inequity have further complicated the notion of European mobility even as globalizing forces seem to promise increased cross-cultural traffic. In sum, European travel narratives offer a new perspective on the journey as such and the cultural issues engaged by travelers. This course will explore Europe’s dynamic cultural terrain from the 1950s to the present as it maps the essential coordinates of European travel and the road movie genre.\n\nENG 4310\n\nSounds, Music, and Horror Films\n\nRichard Burt\n\nWe will trace the development of the horror film from German Expressionist films to pre-code Hollywood silents and talkies by director Todd Browning, some them starring Lon Cheney, to Carl Laemmle films produced at Universal studios, to producer Val Lewton films, to 70s horror classics, to trash horror cinema, and to the emergence of analog horror in films directed by David Cronenberg. Films will include The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari, Warning Shadows, The Last Warning, Waxworks, The Cat and the Canary, The Phantom of the Opera, Freaks, The Unknown, West of Zanzibar, The Old Dark House, Dracula, Dracula’s Daughter, The Bride of Frankenstein, Son of Frankenstein, The Invisible Man, The Black Cat, Doctor X, Mystery of the Wax Museum, Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde, The Hands of Orlac, The Island of Lost Souls, Mad Love, The Devil Doll, Cat People, Murders in the Rue Morgue, The Exorcist, Carnival of Souls, The Man with the X-Ray Eyes, Rabid, Scanners, and Videodrome. We will pay particular attention to sound effects and soundtrack music.\n\nRequirements: Class participation; co-lead class discussion twice; one film clip exercise; two 500-700 word papers; and two discussion questions and three shot analyses for each class.\n\nENG 4910\n\nCommunity Engagement\n\nLaura Gonzales\n\nEmphasizing the role of humanities professionals as public intellectuals, this course provides frameworks, methods, and strategies for practicing community engagement not as service, but as reciprocal research. This course will ask students to consider what communities they belong to, what audiences fuel their work, and how our research in English studies can contribute to the good work that is already taking place in communities outside the ivory tower. Drawing on frameworks and methodologies that thread together Chicana feminism, Black womanist epistemologies, and decolonial theory (among others) with emerging practices in information and technology design, this course will ask students to consider who the communities and publics that we are all accountable to as members of the academy. Particular emphasis will be placed on developing public-facing materials and portfolios that demonstrate students’ preparation for both academic and pubic-facing work in community organizations, justice-driven businesses, and other public venues. No prior experience with community engagement is required, as we will all begin the course by learning about each other and the communities we currently inhabit. Course projects will include a research-driven community researcher positionality statement, digital materials demonstrating community commitments, as well as a literature review based on community-engagement research.\n\nENG 4910\n\nPrint Histories in the 20th and 21st Centuries\n\nMargaret Galvan\n\nHow do books get made? How do we print in color? How did we make copies before Xerox? How have new technologies changed how we produce books and other printed matter? These kind of questions and others that deal with the materiality of books and book history will guide us in this course as we learn about the rapid evolution of print technologies in the 20th and 21st centuries for books, periodicals, comics, and other printed matter. We will discuss and sometimes participate in demonstrations of technologies like: linotype, letterpress, mimeograph, xerography, spirit duplication, risograph, offset, 3D printing, PDFs, typewriters, word processing, etc. We will visit relevant research collections and labs on campus to peek behind-the-scenes into the practical nuts and bolts of literary production and distribution. Students will learn how to conduct original research into a specific print technology, drawing upon relevant archival and other resources.\n\nCourse assignments will include digital reflections on a shared course website, a short formal essay, and a research project with a digital component.\n\nENG 4936\n\nHonors Seminar: Nineteenth-Century African American Women: Their Lives and Literature\n\nDebra Walker King\n\nDescription: During most of the nineteenth-century, Victorian values and ideologies ruled. With the downfall of slavery and the rise of industrialization and urbanization many of these standards changed and new codes of living surfaced. How did the African American woman, her views, and her goals fit into the changing system? What were her means of survival and how was her identity constructed within the age of genteel America? What roles did she play in feminist pursuits? What voices clamored to he heard and how did America react to these voices? In this course, these and other questions will be addressed as students concentrate on the complex struggles of equality and difference experienced and discussed by nineteenth-century women who produced autobiographies, novels, short stories, poems, essays and speeches. Texts surveyed include Harriet Wilson’s Our Nig, Harriet Jacobs’ Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, Frances Harper’s, Iola Leroy, and Emma Dunham Kelly’s, Megda.\n\nENG 4936\n\nHonors Seminar: Contemporary American Literature and Cultures of Imperialism\n\nMalini Johar Schueller\n\nCourse Description: The collection of essays titled Cultures of US imperialism (1993) transformed the field of American literary studies by making colonialism and imperialism central to conceptions of nation, culture, and identity. How do we see imperial culture as integral to American literary and cultural productions? By reading a broad range of works of twentieth and twenty-first century American literature, we will examine different tropes of empire such as going native, colonial domesticity, pornotropics, tutelary colonialism, exhibiting empire and remasculinization; at the same time, we will focus on the specific sites of empire such as Hawai’I, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Guam, and Vietnam. The course will engage with different forms of U.S. imperialism such as North American settler colonialism, Pacific and continental expansionism, control of far-flung colonies, and empire without colonies. The purpose is to examine the different ways in which, at historically specific moments, cultural texts (memoirs, novels, and films) and empire are imbricated and to raise a number of questions: How are travel and exploration implicated in empire? What are the differences in how the sites of U.S. empire are constructed in the national imaginary? How are questions of empire and gender related? How does contemporary literature register histories of, and ongoing US imperialism? How might literature resist cultural imperialism?\n\nPossible texts will include Tommy Pico’s (Kumeyaay) Nature Poem, David Henry Hwang’s M Butterfly, Mary Helen Fee’s A Woman’s Impression of the Philippines, Gina Apostol’s Insurrecto, Jack Kerouac’s On the Road, Lois Ann Yamanaka’s Blu’s Hanging, Craig Santos Perez’s from Unincorporated Territory [hacha], Aimee Phan’s We Should Never Meet, and Nora Okja Keller’s Fox Girl, and Rambo, First Blood Part II.\n\nENL 3122\n\nNineteenth Century British Novel\n\nPamela Gilbert\n\nThis course samples key developments in the British novel through the nineteenth century. We will examine the novels within three contexts: historical, literary-historical, and critical. If you have not had English 2022, you should plan to familiarize yourself with the period: the Norton Anthology introduction to the period is a good place to start. Gilmour’s and Houghton’s books are also very useful and are on reserve in the library.\n\nThe Victorian period was the great age of the novel’s emergence as a dominant popular form within a newly extensive literary marketplace, and Victorian novelists were consummate entertainers driven to sell widely and well. They were also preoccupied with the condition of their own culture; to paraphrase Richard Altick, rarely is the Present so much present in literature as it is in the novel of this period. Victorian novelists considered it their duty and pleasure to criticize, praise and generally comment upon current issues, and they developed new forms and genres to accommodate their purposes. These issues represent the formative phases of social concerns which we have inherited and which still define us: for example, the role of mass media, the ethics of capitalism, gender roles, the responsibilities of liberal government, the welfare state, pollution, the role of nation in the global community, etc. We will read a range of representative genres and consider them not only in the light of the emergence of the novel as a dominant form, but as documents of a culture’s attempts to represent and work out these issues of contemporary importance—aesthetically and ethically—and consider the ways in which Victorian ideas resonate for us today.\n\nThis course provides upper-division credit in the major, and will be taught with that in mind; therefore, students will be expected to know how to do research in the field and to attempt the application of critical frameworks. Due to the nature of the material, there is a considerable amount of reading. Carefully consider your reading speed and the expectations of the other courses you are taking before committing to this course.\n\nPossible texts:\n\nJane Austen, Pride and Prejudice\n\nCharlotte Bronte, Jane Eyre\n\nElizabeth Gaskell, North and South\n\nCharles Dickens, Bleak House\n\nM. E. Braddon, Lady Audley’s Secret\n\nGeorge Eliot, Mill on the Floss\n\nRudyard Kipling, Kim\n\nother critical readings to be provided.\n\nENL 3154\n\nTwentieth-Century British Poetry\n\nMarsha Bryant\n\nThis survey course offers a close look at W.B. Yeats, Wilfred Owen, T. S. Eliot, W.H. Auden, Stevie Smith, Philip Larkin, Linton Kwesi Johnson, Carol Ann Duffy, and UF’s own Michael Hofmann. We will examine their poems, lives, and cultural contexts. As we move through the syllabus, perceptions of gender, family, and nation will shift as definitions of “British poetry” change. Course Assignments include one short and one long paper, a panel presentation, class discussion, digital participation, and a parody. Our work together will sharpen your skills in literary analysis, argumentative writing, and creative thinking.\n\nENL 4303\n\nCharles Dickens the Radical\n\nSean Grass\n\nIn 1937 on the eve of World War II, the playwright George Bernard Shaw wrote of Dickens’s novel Little Dorrit, “Little Dorrit is a more seditious book than Das Kapital. All over Europe men and women are in prison for pamphlets and speeches which are to Little Dorrit as red pepper is to dynamite.” In many ways, Dickens had the opinions we would expect of a 19th-century man. In other ways, he was a radical, advocating perpetually for legal, economic, sanitary, and other major social reforms. This class has two primary aims: first, studying the enormously popular and significant literature and journalism that Dickens wrote 1835-1870; and second, assessing the extent to which his advocacy for social and other transformations continues to shape our own culture and resonate in the twenty-first century. Texts for this course will include Oliver Twist, A Christmas Carol, Hard Times, and Our Mutual Friend, as well as selections from major biographies of Dickens and from his letters and journalism. Assignments will include short (2-3 pp.) papers–one of which will become a longer (7-10 pp.) final paper—and a small-group project/presentation.\n\nENL 4303\n\nJohn Milton: Poetry and Prose\n\nPeter Rudnytsky\n\nIn addition to Paradise Lost, the greatest poem in the English language, Milton is the author of the masque known as Comus, the elegy “Lycidas,” the brief epic Paradise Regained, and the biblical tragedy Samson Agonistes, as well as prose works defending divorce, freedom of the press, and the execution of King Charles I. Through it all—his desertion by his first wife, his blindness, the crushing of his political hopes—Milton struggled to justify his own ways to God in order to write a poem that aftertimes would not willingly let die. In this course, we will see how, after breaking his vow of celibacy that he believed was the precondition for being a poet-priest, Milton threw himself into politics and became the foremost spokesman for the Puritan Revolution, only to return to poetry after the Restoration and write the late masterpieces in which he encodes his spiritual and sexual autobiography. Course requirements are a midterm, final, and one five-page paper. Regular attendance and active participation in class discussions are also expected.\n\nLIT 3003\n\nThe Horror, The Horror: Representations of War and Political Violence\n\nEric Kligerman\n\nThis course sets out to probe the cultural, social and political functions of horror in relation to shifting moments of historical violence. In addition to exploring the horror genre in literary and cinematic works of the imagination (Shelley’s Frankenstein and Hitchcock’s Psycho), we will ultimately apply the aesthetic, epistemic and ethical questions arising in the genre to shifting representations of traumatic history. As we map out the history and themes behind this popular genre, our aim is to probe the intersections between horror and its socio-cultural and historical contexts. How is political violence represented, conceptualized and memorialized across shifting linguistic and visual texts? What ethical questions arise in our engagement with representations of traumatic limit events and the experience of horror these events entail?\n\nAfter reading and screening central works from the horror genre, we will examine some of the emblematic scenes of historical violence in the 20th and 21st centuries. Turning to such instances as the legacies of colonialism (Heart of Darkness), First World War (Cabinet of Dr. Caligari) the Holocaust (Survival in Auschwitz and Eichmann in Jerusalem) the Vietnam War (Michael Herr’s Dispatches) and 9/11 (Delillo’s “In the Ruins of the Future”), this seminar investigates the intersection between narratives of horror in the realms of both fantasy and history. In our inquiry into representations of horror, we will examine how this genre in European and American culture is employed to express both individual and national anxieties in the face of political violence. Finally, what does our fascination with the horrors of historical violence reveal about ourselves?\n\nLIT 3043\n\nModern Drama: A Transnational Survey\n\nApollo Amoko\n\n​This course addresses wide-ranging 20th-century playwrights across the English-speaking world. It draws inspiration from Wai Chee Dimock’s provocative challenge affirming the need to liberate literary studies from the tyranny of numbers, most prominently historical dates and latitudes and longitudes. In other words, her approach contests the self-evidence of dominant paradigms that routinely classify literature according to each writer’s national identity and birth date. Paradoxically, writers who are separated by vast distances in time and space often have more in common than those in close historical and geographical proximity. Against this backdrop, this course deploys a transnational/cross-cultural critical perspective in bringing together texts from such putatively distinct and self-contained national contexts as the United States, Canada, Britain, Ireland, Egypt, Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and Australia. We will study playwrights like Tony Kushner, Anna Deaver Smith, Michel Tremblay, Caryl Churchill, Timberlake Wertenbaker, Brian Friel, Athol Fugard, Wole Soyinka, Ngugi wa Thiong’o, and Tawfik Al Hakim.\n\nLIT 3173\n\nYiddish New York\n\nJason Wagner\n\nWhat is American literature? This class examines an American literature that still awaits appreciation. As a result of the mass emigration of Jews from Eastern Europe in the late 19th-early 20th century, New York became a global center of Yiddish culture. Yiddish writers, journalists, actors, filmmakers, and political activists produced a rich and diverse culture, which flourished for a good part of the last century. This class will examine different genres of Yiddish cultural creativity, highlighting the specific nyu-yorkish qualities. All texts are presented in English translation and the class is conducted in English.\n\nLIT 3173\n\nRussian Jewish Literature in the 20th and 21st Centuries\n\nJason Wagner\n\nWhat is Russian Literature? What is Jewish Literature? This class explores texts originally written in the Russian language by Jewish authors concerning Jewish themes. It seeks to explore literary representations of Jewish life in the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union throughout the twentieth and into the twenty-first century. Literary texts will be put into historical contexts. Can the focus on this area of Russian literature augment our understanding of the traditional canon of Russian literature? All texts are presented in English translation and the class is conducted in English.\n\nLIT 3374\n\nThe Bible as Literature\n\nAnastasia Ulanowicz\n\nAccording to conventional wisdom, the Judeo-Christian Bible is a book. Indeed, in certain religious communities, it is regarded as The Book. However, as both theologians and secular literary critics have observed, the Bible is not so much a singular book as it is a collection of many different literary forms composed during various historical periods and only later anthologized by representatives of dominant socio-religious communities. Moreover, the Bible can be defined as much as by what it excludes as by what it includes: indeed, different communities read different editions of the Bible.\n\nThe purpose of this class, then, is to analyze the disparate forms and genres contained within the Judeo-Christian biblical canon (New Oxford Annotated edition, with apocrypha). We will examine such different literary forms as origin myths (Genesis), romance/quest narrative (Exodus), lyrical poetry (the Psalms), erotic poetry (Song of Songs/the Song of Solomon), prophecy (Isaiah), fairy tales (Job), gospel tales (the synoptic gospels and the Book of John), epistolary writing (Paul), and apocalyptic literature (Daniel and the Revelations of St. John the Divine). We will also study the influence of these forms on secular works of literature (e.g., those by Kafka, Kierkegaard, Melville, and Milton). In doing so, we will consider how the formation of the Biblical canon influenced the formation of the secular literary canon.\n\nN.B. This is a literature course — not a course on religion or theology. Previous familiarity with the Bible is not a prerequisite.\n\nLIT 3383\n\nBlack Women Transatlantic\n\nJulia Mollenthiel\n\nThis course will survey African American, African, European, and Caribbean literature and film written and produced by Black women from the 18th century to the present. Students will read and watch a variety of texts, each of which centers on materials that are thematically and historically related. We will examine how Black women across these geographical regions utilize certain aesthetics, styles, techniques, genres, and structures, as well as how these traditions explore ideas around freedom and identity. This course is organized thematically, with an emphasis on the movements and ideas of Black feminine social thought and political protest that contextualize Black women’s writing across the diaspora.\n\nLIT 3383\n\nAfrican Women Writers\n\nRose Sau Lugano\n\nTBA\n\nLIT 4194\n\nAfrican Literature and Colonial Anthropology\n\nApollo Amoko\n\nThis course examines the vexed relationship between colonial anthropology and modern African literature. From its inauguration in the 19th century, anthropology implanted and cultivated primitivist ideas about Africa that helped justify aggressive “civilizing missions” by various European colonial powers, namely, England, Belgium, French, Portugal, Spain, and Germany. Initially, anthropological knowledge turned on questionable Western sources including assorted travelogues, novels, and the biographies and autobiographies of missionaries and colonial administrators. This vast colonial library ranged from the novels of popular English writer Joyce Cary to the widely cited amateur ethnography of Belgian missionary Placide Tempels to Lord Lugard’s highly influential quasi-autobiography. As the principal architect of in-direct colonial governance, the legendary colonial administrator relied on extensive personal experience in Africa. Wide-ranging anthropological texts provided essential evidence for emergent academic discourses regarding Africa, for instance, Lucien Levy-Bruhl’s The Primitive Mentality, a canonical philosophy treatise that was predicated on a foundational binary opposition between fundamentally rational Western cultures and fundamentally mystical Africa cultures. Several early 20th century scholars, most prominently E. Evans Pritchard and Branislow Malinowski, contested the consensus about mystical Africa vis-à-vis the rational West that Levy-Bruhl exemplified. Through rigorous long-term case studies, the two pioneering cultural/structuralist anthropologists affirmed the fundamental rationality of pre-colonial African cultures. Thus, colonial anthropology entailed less an undifferentiated colonial instrument than an ever-expanding set of multivalent, contradictory, and contested discourses. Against this backdrop, modern African literature emerged in the late 1950s and early 1960s as the beleaguered continent stood on cusp of independence. Consequently, the writers came of age amid triumphant, or at any rate, optimistic anti-colonial nationalism. Inspired by the prospect of liberation and self-determination, founding writers like Wole Soyinka, Ngugi wa Thiong’o, Chinua Achebe, Cheikh Hamidou Kane, and Flora Nwapa vigorously contested the colonial library. In a telling example, Achebe’s paradigmatic novel, Things Fall Apart, deployed supreme irony in a decisive repudiation of Cary and Lugard among multiple other Western authors. However, the novel’s withering anti-colonial glance silently harked back to Evans-Pritchard’s path-clearing anthropology. Invariably, Achebe appeared to reproduce certain colonial paradigms and ideas even as they denounced others. In the name of reclaiming authentic African culture, negritude writers, for example, Leopold Sedar Senghor, seemed to uncritically embrace the racist stereotypes exemplified by colonial writers like Tempels. In short, this course emphasizes the paradoxes and contradictions at the heart of asymmetrical colonial relations.\n\nLIT 4331\n\nChildren’s Literature\n\nNoah Mullens\n\nThis course will provide an introduction to major works of children’s literature written from 1868 to present. As we examine these texts, we will consider how and why (or even whether) they might be read specifically\n\nas children’s books – and how, moreover, their study might prompt us to evaluate the literary canon in its various historical permutations. Additionally, we will question the ways in which these texts represent\n\nrace, class, gender, and national identity.\n\nLIT 4483\n\nSeeing Differently: Comics and Identity\n\nMargaret Galvan\n\nComics studies has emerged as a scholarly field of inquiry over the past 25+ years, but many foundational thinkers considered only the form of the comic in their scholarship. Recent scholarship has both extended and challenged this formalist approach by engaging with how race, class, ideology, gender, sexuality, etc. shape comics. Indeed, comics has become a flashpoint for identity-focused theoretical investigations. In this class, we will ask how these theories shift our understanding of comics and how comics themselves represent issues of identity.\n\nCourse assignments will include digital reflections on a shared course website, a short formal essay, and a research project with a digital component.\n\nLIT 4483\n\nVictorians’ Secrets\n\nSean Grass\n\nMuch of our modern sense of what 19th-century England was like might come from watching Bridgerton or popular film adaptations of Jane Austen’s novels. But life in Victorian England was not all muslin gowns, fancy balls, and men with walking sticks and top hats. On the contrary, the very high majority of English people during the 19th century lived in relative poverty, either in rural areas where they worked as agricultural laborers or—increasingly as the century wore on—in the period’s overcrowded, unsanitary, and impoverished cities which were being dramatically reshaped by industrialization and the rise of finance capitalism. And these considerations, often, were the subject of the period’s literature. The purpose of this course is to read fiction, poetry, journalism, and other kinds of texts that can help us to understand the seedy underbelly of nineteenth-century England. Authors will include Mary Elizabeth Braddon, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Robert Browning, Charles Dickens, Christina Rossetti, and W.T. Stead. Assignments for the course will likely include a short oral presentation, two medium-length (4-6 pp.) essays (one of which will cover the same subject as the presentation), and a final exam.\n\nLIT 4930\n\nVampire Cinema\n\nDragan Kujundžić\n\nVampires, werewolves, ghosts and apparitions from Bram Stoker, to Francis Ford Coppola and Anne Rice. The course will address issues of vampire and Empire (the imperial politics behind vampirism), vampirism and psychoanalysis, vampirism and modernism, vampirism and cinema, queer, gay and lesbian vampires, vampires of East and Central Europe, vampirism and anti-Semitism, vampirism and religion, vampirism and nationalism, history of blood in religion, film and literature, etc.\n\nLIT 4930\n\nJewish-American Cinema\n\nDragan Kujundžić\n\nThe course will introduce students to the rich history of Jewish-American cinema and the latest critical and theoretical literature about it. It will be organized thematically, and chronologically, starting with the topics of Jewish Diaspora, emigration to the US, the first sound film, and then films about the Holocaust, comedy, Israeli and World Cinema. During the course, we will screen and discuss films involved with the representation of the Jews.\n\nLIT 4930\n\nBlack Englishes\n\nJames Essegbey\n\nThis course presents students with varieties of Englishes spoken by Blacks in Africa, the Caribbean, and the United States. Students will learn about the structure of these varieties as well as the social histories which underpin them. They will appreciate difficulties in using terms like dialect versus language to describe these varieties. Further, they will watch movies and interact with native speakers of these varieties with a view to identifying features that set them apart. Students will also explore concepts like “pidgins” and “creoles” and learn to distinguish between “broken English” and Pidgin or Creole English.\n\nLIT 4930\n\nFeminist Speculative Fiction\n\nTace Hedrick\n\nDarko Suvin, well-known theorist of science fiction, proposed in 1972 in an essay “On the Poetics of the Science Fiction Genre” that literary science fiction combines “the enabling of the mind to receive new wavelengths” (380) with the device of estrangement, which allows us to recognize familiar subjects but makes them seem unfamiliar (374). At around the same time, feminist science fiction (or speculative fiction, since not all “science” fiction has to do with scientific or technological progress) was increasingly making narratives that estranged not just our ideas of gender, but of biology, sexuality, and race, letting us think in new ways, or new wavelengths as Suvin had it. This course will look at feminist speculative fiction (where I include the Gothic) from around the 1970s to contemporary work. Joanna Russ, James Tiptree Jr., Ursula LeGuin, Octavia Butler, Samuel R. Delaney, Anne Leckie, Sabrina Vourvoulias, Silvia Moreno-García, and others may be included. Reading quizzes and three long-essay exams are required.\n\nLIT 4930\n\nHong Kong, Taiwan, and Global Cinema\n\nYing Xiao\n\nThe course explores the rise and various aspects of Hong Kong cinema and Taiwanese cinema through the lens of globalization. One of the world’s largest and energetic film industries, Hong Kong cinema has a global presence and impact that enthralls a broad global audience not only as an epitome of popular entertainment but also through its creativity, craftmanship, diversity, and multifaceted interactions and linkages with other cinemas and international culture. Another example we juxtapose and examine in class is Taiwan new cinema, one of the most imaginative and stylistic films that demonstrates a distinct art and registers the discourses of postcolonialism, modernity, nationalism, and globalization in similar and different ways. How do they draw upon local traditions and identities and on the other hand, significantly connect to global market and Hollywood? How have they contributed to global cinema and the development of film as a medium?\n\nThis course takes students on a comparative and interdisciplinary exploration of Hong Kong and Taiwanese cinemas to look at their histories, main themes, diverse genres, industrial practice, aesthetic styles, diasporic cultures, and the transregional/transnational cultural exchange and collaborations. Filmmakers and stars to be discussed include Tsui Hark, John Woo, Wong Kar-wai, Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Maggie Cheung, Stephen Chow, Chow Yun-fat, Michelle Yeoh, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Edward Yang, Tsai Ming-liang, and Ang Lee. Screenings cover a wide variety of genres from martial arts, melodrama, comedy, romantic film, to ghost story and musical."
