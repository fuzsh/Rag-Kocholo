        "text": "Book\n\nMovie\n\nCarlisle's car—which Alice, Jasper and Bella use to escape from James—is said to have dark tinted windows. In the movie the car they escape from doesn't seem to be tinted at all. When Bella goes to meet the Cullens, Emmett and Rosalie are not there. At the scene where they prepare Bella's Italian dish Rosalie and Emmett are present. When Bella goes to the Cullen house, she is wearing a khaki skirt and a dark blue blouse. In that scene Bella is wearing jeans, a green top and a jean jacket. The Cullen siblings only take Edward's car to school, in order of being less noticeable. While driving to school Rosalie and Emmett both drive their own cars. Edward tells Bella that if they become public, his family will be in trouble because it might 'end badly'. In the movie Rosalie and Emmett explain why it would end badly to Bella. While they are playing baseball, Edward tells Bella to take down her hair. Alice says, \"That won't work. I could smell her across the field.\" During the scene Alice doesn't say the words Rosalie says, \"Like that will help. I could smell her from across the field.\" There was no mention of what the Cullens wore to the baseball field. Esme acts as the umpire but does not physically play; she stays with Bella on the sidelines. The baseball scene has the Cullens wearing jerseys and hats. Also, Bella acts as umpire and Esme is the catcher and the teams are formed differently than in the book. In the book, Bella's first day at Forks High School is on January 18. In the film, her first day at a new school is in March. In the book, Forks High School is a cluster of separated buildings. In the movie, it is just one typical enclosed building. In the book, in regard to the heroin line: Isabella offers the analogy \"So what you're saying is, I'm your brand of heroin?\" to which Edward replies \"Yes, you are exactly my brand of heroin.\" Edward mentions alcohol at first, but decides the reference is not a powerful enough illustration. In the film, the addiction reference is shortened. Alcohol is not mentioned, and when he compares her scent to a drug, Edward simply delivers the line \"You're like my own personal brand of heroin.\" In the book, Edward tells Isabella that he was planning to take her to visit his family on a Sunday when Bella was eating breakfast. In the movie, Edward jumps onto Bella's truck and then tells her that he is taking her to meet his family the next day. In the book, Mr. Banner is Bella's biology teacher. In the movie, Mr. Molina is Bella's biology teacher. In the book, the prom is held in their school gym. In the movie, prom is held at a Hotel Inn instead of the high school gym. In the book, Bella reveals that she knows Edward is a vampire in the car on the way back to Forks from Port Angeles. In the movie, this revelation is moved to the forest beside Forks High School. In the book, Bella uses a CD Player In the movie, she uses an iPod. In the book, when they are in Edward's room Bella says: \"You're not as scary as you think you are.\" Edward then pounces on Bella and they land on the couch. In the movie, when they are in Edward's room Bella says: \"I'm not scared of you.\" Edward then says: \"You really shouldn't have said that,\" slings Bella onto his back, and jumps out the window with her onto a tree. In the book, Bella finds out about her truck while she is riding in Charlie's police cruiser from the airport.\n\nIn the movie, Bella doesn't know about the truck until after Billy and Jacob deliver it to her house.\n\nIn the book, their first kiss is next to Bella's truck after they leave the meadow. In the movie, Edward and Bella's first kiss is in Bella's room. In the book, Jacob tells Bella all the legends of his tribe and she learns from him that Edward and his family are vampires. In the movie, Jacob tells her only part of the story, and she finds the rest out from a book that she buys in Port Angeles and the internet. In the book, it is only after another student opens the door that Edward realizes that Bella is standing behind him in the office on her first day at school. In the movie, Edward seems to smell her as soon as she enters the room (although this could be that he heard the door open but because he couldn't hear any thoughts he realized it was her). In the book, Alice helps Bella get ready for the prom. In the movie, Bella seems to get ready by herself, though she mentions that Alice let borrow her the dress that she wears. In the book, the Cullens' house is old and white. In the movie, the Cullens' house is modern-looking, and painted in black and brown. In the book, Bella ditches Jasper by running through the airport bathroom and hopping into a taxi from a hotel that the bus she got on took her to. In the movie, when Bella escapes from Alice and Jasper to meet up with James, she ditches them in the hotel lobby. In the book, when Bella sees Jacob at the prom; he has grown significantly tall. In the movie, when Bella sees Jacob at the prom; he hasn't grown significantly. In the book, it is mentioned that Jacob dances with Bella. In the movie, he just sits with her outside the inn. In the book, Jacob fixes up a VW Rabbit, and Billy bribes him with auto parts and $20 to get him to warn Bella at the prom. In the movie, there is no mention of Jacob fixing up the Rabbit, or of Billy bribing him with auto parts to get him to warn Bella at the prom, but he does offer Jacob the $20. In the book, the restaurant is Italian. In the movie, the restaurant is not Italian, and the scene goes much differently than in the book. In the book, Bella has an old desktop computer. In the movie, Bella has a new Apple laptop. In the book, when Edward saves Bella from being crushed by the van, it is before school. In the movie, it happens right after school ends that day. In the book, Bella said that she was going to Seattle to avoid going to a school dance. In the movie, she said that she was going to Jacksonville. In the book, Charlie put snow chains on Bella's truck tires, and he hadn't told her about it. In the movie, Charlie put new tires on the truck instead, and told her before she left for school. In the book, Angela isn't happy about going to the dance with Eric. In the movie, she hopes that he will ask her to the dance. In the book, Edward didn't know that James and Victoria were together, a crucial point in the next two books with Edward saying that he would've known that Victoria would've come back if he had known that they were \"mates\". In the movie, James and Victoria walk away with James' arm draped over her shoulder. (during the baseball scene) In the book, it is stated that Billy is unable to drive. In the movie, he is seen driving when Edward leaves Bella's house. In the book, Edward has a silver Volvo S60R and Bella's truck is from the '50s. In the movie, he has a silver Volvo C30. and her truck is a '63. In the book, Alice is supposed to be short. In the movie, she is almost as tall as Bella, and no more than six inches shorter than Jasper, although he is supposed to be 6'3\" and she is supposed to be 4'10\". In the book, Emmett has curly hair. In the movie, his hair is straight and short. In the book, Charlie has curly hair. In the movie, he does not. In the book, Victoria, Laurent and James are introduced at the baseball game, much later in the story timeline, and Waylon Forge or the guard from the mill are not included. In the movie, Victoria, Laurent and James were introduced early on, shown killing and feeding off two people, one being Charlie's friend Waylon Forge. In the book, Bella has lunch, Biology, and then Gym. In the movie, they show her in Gym class, then in lunch, and then in Biology. In the book, the cabinets in Bella's kitchen are yellow (her mom painted them yellow to try to bring 'sunshine' to Forks.) In the movie, they are teal. In the book, Edward has a black leather couch with a golden rug and dark heavy fabric hung on the wall. In the movie, he has a white chaise lounge with white walls. In the book, Bella arrived early, before everyone else. In the movie, Bella arrives at her first day of school while everyone was in the parking lot. In the book, Bella and her friends visit the rock pools, and there is no mention of surfing. In the movie, when Bella and her friends go to First Beach, there are people surfing. In the book, James mentions Alice's past. In the movie, James does not mention Alice's past. In the book, when Carlisle and his family meets James, Victoria, and Laurent, Carlisle introduces them by their names. In the movie, when they meet James, Victoria, and Laurent, Carlisle just says, \"This is my family\". In the book, Edward is supposedly taking Bella to Seattle, to get her out of going to the dance (instead, he goes with her to the meadow and shows her why he can't go out in the sunlight). In the movie, Bella confesses that she knows what he is and to try to scare her, he takes her up the mountain and shows her why they can't go into the sunlight. In the book, on the way home from dinner in Port Angeles, Edward explains what it is like to be a vampire. In the movie, she finds out details in other parts of the movie. In the book, Isabella wears a deep blue, frilly off-the-shoulder dress to prom with a stiletto heel with satin ribbon. In the movie, she is wearing a blue, halter-top dress with a sweater, light purple and a black pair of Chuck Taylor shoes. In the book, on the way to the prom, Bella finds out that Edward is actually taking her to prom. In the movie, there is no mention of this because she seems to have known where she was going. In the book, Victoria doesn't speak until her final appearance in Eclipse; Bella describes Victoria's voice as a tinkling, babyish soprano, saying that it was \"a voice that belonged with blond curls and pink bubblegum.\" In the movie, Victoria first speaks when they're about to kill Waylon. In the book, James called Bella to tell her to go to her house in Phoenix, and told her to call the number next to the phone. In the movie, she was told to go straight to the ballet studio. In the book, Bella finds the ornamental cross in the Cullens' house ironic and mentions this to Edward. In the movie, she just passes by it, without a comment. In the book, Isabella tells Jessica that Edward \"drives like a maniac\". In the movie, she doesn't seem to mind, although she does hate fast drivers. In the book, Bella calls Jessica and Jessica asks what happened with Edward.. In the movie, it doesn't happen at all. In the book Jasper poses as a senior, not a junior. In the movie, Jasper is seen on the class field trip along with Edward and Alice. In the book, where Mike tells Bella that he doesn't like her being with Edward, (\"He looks at you like you're something to eat.\"), she tells him off for interfering and laughs at his comment. In the movie, she says nothing and just shrugs it off. In the book, Bella and Edward drove half way and ran the rest of the way to the clearing where they played baseball. In the movie, Bella and Edward drive Emmett's Jeep all the way and walk a short distance to the clearing where they played baseball. In the book, Alice tells Bella how a person becomes a vampire as Edward doesn't want her to know. In the movie, Edward tells her. In the book, Edward stays with Bella after saving her from Tyler's van, and also rides in the ambulance. Dialogue occurs between Edward and Bella in which he expresses his concern for her, plants the false \"safe\" version of the story in which he was there the whole time, and agrees to tell her the truth later in exchange for her cooperation. Later in the hospital, when Tyler asks how she was able to get out of the way so fast, Bella goes along with the false story Edward gave her, which earns his trust. The incident is much more involved than what is portrayed in the movie, giving Bella even more proof of Edward's superhuman abilities. Edward is standing only four cars down from Bella when Tyler loses control of the van. The van is spinning out of control and not only skids toward Bella, but rotates toward her after Edward's initial attempt to deflect it- supporting the \"bad luck\" idea about her. The van rocks up on two wheels after the first impact, causing Edward to further expose himself by catching it and moving Bella out of the way before it comes down on her legs. Edward braces himself against the car parked next to Bella's truck in order to stop the van, causing him to make an impression in it shaped like his shoulders - which Bella notices. Additionally, Bella is injured since Edward is moving too fast to be gentle when he grabs her and moves her out of the way. He is unable to prevent her head from smacking the icy pavement. Charlie arrives on the scene, and speaks to Bella before she is taken to the hospital. EMTs are involved, and Bella notices that 8 people are needed just to shift the van enough to bring stretchers in (presumably relating this to Edward's demonstration of his immense strength, just prior). A neck brace is put on Bella, much to her chagrin. Tyler's injuries come across as somewhat more severe in the book. In the movie, Edward walks away after saving Bella from Tyler's van and there is no dialogue between them at the time. Bella realizes Edward is obviously hiding something, and while she mentions his involvement, she chooses on her own not to bring up his inexplicable strength in being able to stop the van with his bare hands. This keeping of his secret without being asked to is how she earns his trust. The entire incident is simplified a great deal. Edward's impossible speed and strength are still obvious to Bella, but without quite as much evidence. Edward is on the other side of the parking lot when Tyler loses control of the van, which does not spin out of control, but slides laterally on its way to side-swipe Bella's truck - with her sandwiched between the two vehicles. Edward's reaction and/or movement seems faster. From a much greater distance than in the book, he gets to Bella in time to cradle her gently with one arm, and—almost casually—stop the motion of the van with the other. Edward is portrayed as a nearly unmovable force. The momentum of the van hardly affects him at all, barely causing him to rock toward the truck slightly, but not enough to come in contact with it. While the \"story\" is that she hit her head, Bella suffers no injury from the van or Edward's intervention, and is simply shocked after witnessing Edward's abilities. 9-1-1 is called, but the scene cuts to the hospital before an ambulance or EMTs are shown. Bella is never shown on a stretcher, or in a neck brace. After the accident, Charlie first sees Bella at the hospital, rather than at the school. Tyler is barely injured having only a small cut on his forehead. In the book, Charlie is waiting in the waiting room for Bella. In the movie, Charlie is in the E.R. with Bella and tells Tyler: \"You can kiss your license goodbye!\" In the book, it is stated that Esme was turned before Rosalie, meaning that Esme would be with the Cullens. In the movie, when Jacob tells Bella of the legends between his tribe and the Cullens, there is a flashback scene of Edward, Carlisle, Rosalie and Emmett feeding on an animal. Esme is absent in the scene. In the book, after the incident with the van, Edward undented the car he had smashed into. In the movie, he wasn't near any other car to dent it. In the book, Laurent says the line \"you brought a snack\" in the form of a question. In the movie, James says the line, but as a statement. In the book, when Edward tells Bella to distract him from turning his car around, she starts talking about Tyler and how he told everyone he was taking her to prom. In the movie, she just tells Edward to put on his seat belt. In the book, when Isabella tells Charlie she's going out with Edward, he confuses him for Edwin. In the movie, he calmly asks, \"Isn't he a little old for you?\" He also never mistakenly calls Edward \"Edwin\". In the book, the weather is supposed to be nice when Bella goes to La Push for the first time. In the movie, it is dreary. In the book, Bella meets Jacob for the first time at the beach. In the movie, Bella meets Jacob for the first time when he and Billy bring the truck to the house. In the book, it mentions Lauren going with them to First Beach. In the movie, ;Lauren is not even mentioned.\n\nIn the Twilight films, Lauren was combined with Jessica Stanley to create one character, named Jessica.[1]\n\nIn the book, when Bella goes to the Cullens' house, Alice and Jasper enter via the staircase. In the movie, they enter through the window (presumably after hunting). In the book, the website where Bella researches about vampires is called \"Vampires A - Z.\" This is an actual website. In the movie, Bella uses Google to find freezerstorageDs.com—a fictional website. The address is valid in real life, but was acquired by someone after the release of the movie for the purpose of padding it's hit count with curious Twilight fans. It is not what is shown in the movie. In the book, Emmett and Jasper killed James in another room. In the movie, Emmett, Jasper and Alice kill James in the same room with Bella, Carlisle, and Edward.

In the book, Eclipse, Bella refers the carpet in Edward's bedroom to being gold in color. In the movie, it is light.

In the book, the guys that were following her taunted her but she never kicks one of the guys. In addition, Edward never exits his car; instead, pulls up swiftly and flings open the passenger door and growling fiercely, \"Get in.\" He fears getting out of his vehicle will tempt him to kill her stalkers. In the movie, she kicks one of them. Edward also gets out of the car and growls at the men who were following her before regaining control and speeding off with Bella.

In the book, all the male vampires in the Cullen family are well over 6 feet tall, with Emmett clearly being the tallest and Jasper being taller than Carlisle and Edward. In the movie, the Cullen males are not as tall as they are described in the books, and all appear to be around the same height. The difference in height between the Cullen men and the women is much less drastic. This is especially noticeable with Emmett, who is supposed to be much taller than the others, and Jasper, who looks rather small in the movie. In the book, describes Esme's features as being less angular and more rounded than the others, and compares her to female film stars of the silent movie era. In the movie, Esme's appearance does not resemble this description at all.
