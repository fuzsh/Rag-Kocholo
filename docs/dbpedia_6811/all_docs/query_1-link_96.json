        "text": "READERS might remember that last Sunday I wrote about Kim Ki-duk, the South Korean filmmaker who was receiving a complete retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art.\n\nThis week, I turn to another director from South Korea, Lee Chang-dong, whose four films will be screening at the Asia Society.\n\nThe two men have little in common as directors. Kim goes in for sex and violence, while Lee takes a more intellectual approach. (His work has been compared to that of Frenchman Robert Bresson.)\n\nFifty-four-year-old Lee is a man of many talents. He’s written and directed for the theater, taught high school and college, penned novels and served as his country’s minister of culture and tourism.\n\nHe came to filmmaking relatively late in life, directing his first film, “Green Fish,” in 1997.\n\nLee and actress Moon So-ri will be at the Asia Society for tomorrow’s 7 p.m. screening of the disturbing “Oasis” (2002). Moon is powerful as a woman with cerebral palsy who has a sexual affair with a slightly retarded male ex-con (Sol Kyung-gu).\n\nOn Wednesday, Lee will be at the 7 p.m. showing of his “Secret Sunshine” (2007). It features the amazing Jeon Do-yeon, who won several best-actress prizes (including one in Cannes) for her work as a frail widow who flips out when her young son is murdered.\n\nSong Kang-ho, the lead of the South Korean horror comedy “The Host” (2004), plays a persistent male admirer.\n\nLee’s second film, “Peppermint Candy” (1999), unreels May 8 at 7 p.m. It follows – in reverse chronology – 20 years of one man’s life.\n\nThe gangster flick “Green Fish” ends the Lee tribute. It unreels at 7 p.m. May 12.\n\nThe Asia Society is at 725 Park Ave., off 70th Street; asiasociety.org.\n\n* DVD alert: Bette Gordon’s 1983 “Variety” hits stores May 20, via Kino International.\n\nThe plot has to do with a bottle blonde named Christine (Sandy McLeod) and her adventures as a ticket seller at a porn theater.\n\nIt was shot at what was then one of the city’s oldest film houses, the Variety, on Third Avenue near 13th Street, although Gordon would have us believe – which we don’t – that the theater is in Times Square.\n\nKeep an ear out for the jazz score by John Lurie.\n\nThe beloved and historic Variety theater began life in 1911 as a nickelodeon and was torn down in June 2005, no doubt by some greedy landlord.\n\nA scene from Martin Scorsese’s “Taxi Driver” (1976) was shot there, and the building where the bloody finale takes place is just around the corner.\n\nV.A. Musetto is film editor of\n\nThe Post; vam@nypost.com"
