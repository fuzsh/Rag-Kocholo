        "text": "The Korean film industry has had a long and storied history — its movies are full of intense action and emotion, sharp dialogue and talented actors. What's more, movies from Korea have broken records and won awards worldwide for both acting and directorial talent — Bong Joon Ho’s film Parasite became the first non-English language film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture in 2019, and won three other Oscars. The film also broke box office records, grossing over $262 million dollars worldwide and setting the record for the highest opening weekend ticket sales ever for a foreign language film in the United States.\n\nKorean and Korean-American actors have also achieved international recognition. You’ll see versatile players like Song Kang Ho, Choi Min Sik, Ma Dong Seok and Lee Byung Hun cast again and again in Korean films.\n\nKeep in mind: Korean cinema is distinct from Korean drama (known as K-drama), which refers to Korean-language television series with multiple episodes per season. But both genres are part of the Korean film and entertainment industry coined “Hallyuwood, \"a combination of the words \"Hollywood\" and \"Hallryu,\" the Korean term for the surge in popularity of Korean media and culture around the world."
