        "text": "I’m currently halfway through this drama.\n\nEpisode 12 of 24. This might be the longest drama I’ve seen so far.\n\nIt’s set in the time of what I’ve come to call the struggle for the partition of Korea. It was more the struggle for the independence of Joseon. So there’s hanboks and Western clothing and kimonos.\n\nMy best thing about this drama is the communication. Not just between the leads but among all the characters. This review, though, is about the communication between the leads.\n\nKorean dramas have taught me a lot about non-verbal communication, reading between the lines, signals between souls, and emotional connections.\n\nOne of my favourite scenes is where the female lead, Ae-sin, meets with the male lead, Eugene, at the apothecary she uses as the base for her secret missions.\n\nShe instructs him to meet her there after learning the meaning of the word love at her English school. Previously, she’d approached him to “do love” with her because she was told that it was better than earning a title. She’s already a noblewoman so if there’s something higher than a title, it makes sense that she’d want it.\n\nAs a gun woman also, she’s been told that love is harder than shooting. But she’s a fast learner. However, she does not realise what it means until it’s explained to her in class one day. Feeling played, she confronts Eugene.\n\nShe refuses to admit that she now knows what the word means because it will make her feel even more silly than she does. But he knows that she’s finally learned the meaning.\n\nAnd when she asks why he agreed to do it — because he knew what it was from the beginning and agreed despite knowing she’s engaged to another man — he responds saying it was one of two things. Revenge or jealousy.\n\nWhen she asks why revenge, he questions why she’s not curious about the jealousy and she replies,\n\n“I considered it a confession of love. The second? Third, maybe?”\n\nShocked, he asks when she started counting.\n\nShe replies with reference to their first official meeting at his office when he said he was protecting her.\n\nThe conversation is like a beautiful fencing match (irony: the female lead stars in another drama as a fencer) with a worthy opponent.\n\nThere’s no need for superfluous explanation or obviously calling out the subtlety of the other.\n\nThere’s just the understanding of the other’s mind that is comfortably shrouded in mystery but exposed at the same time.\n\nIn that conversation, they both admit to having feelings for each other without saying they have feelings for each other.\n\nTotally my kind of thing.\n\nThe secret between us two that others can sense but only us know.\n\nIn another scene, she reflects on their moments together and says of his choices that they were quiet and heavy, cold and seemingly selfish, but headed in the right direction.\n\nTo know someone’s mind and heart this way and to be seen and understood this way…\n\nYes, it’s a drama, but fiction comes from desire and imagination too. And there’s a group of people who’ll resonate with this because some of us are just this way.\n\nWith quiet but heavy affections. Actions that are sometimes cold and seemingly selfish but headed in the right direction. Love that does more than it talks and others can sense it, but the pull belongs to just the ones involved.\n\nTotally my thing.\n\nP.S: All images were gotten from Pinterest."
