He is both a driver and passenger of pop culture and together with Film 45 will break glass,” said Graham Taylor and Chris Rice, co-presidents of Endeavor Content.\n\nThe six-part docuseries “McCartney, 3, 2, 1,” which premieres July 16, follows Rubin and Paul McCartney has they explore McCartney’s music from youth, to The Beatles and Wings, and then his solo career. Directed by Zachary Heinzerling, “McCartney 3,2,1” is executive produced by McCartney, Rubin, Scott Rodger, Peter Berg, Matthew Goldberg, Brandon Carroll, Jeff Pollack, Frank Marshall and Ryan Suffern.

Rubin is one of the most successful producers of the last 30 years, having worked with everyone from Tom Petty to Run-DMC, from Johnny Cash to Slayer, from Adele to the Red Hot Chili Peppers. He recently produced the Grammy-award winning album “The New Abnormal” with The Strokes.\n\n“Iconic and legendary are two words that define Rick Rubin’s career, and we’re excited to collaborate with him in this partnership to share his exceptional point of view,” said Matt Goldberg, president of Film 45.\n\nRubin is represented by WME."
