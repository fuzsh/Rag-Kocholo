        "text": "Collectors will be thrilled to discover that Krush Groove related items sell for much less when compared to Beastie Boys eBay.com listings. The movie has not yet been digitally transferred to DVD, so for now picking up a used copy of the VHS for under ten American dollars is a steal. In addition to the movie, fans may also see Krush Groove posters and soundtracks regularly changing hands on the auction website. The soundtrack was available on vinyl as well as cassette, and as stated before contains the Beastie Boys song \"She's On It.\"\n\nThe Beastie Boys next theatrical appearance in the movie Tougher than Leather has traditionally been dated as 1988. However, most Beastie Boys fans know that the band's business relationship with Rick Rubin and Russell Simmons was well on its way to ending by that date. So the year 1987, which is what Russell lists in his book Life and Def, is more accurate and correct. \"For a $2 million budget it (Krush Groove) was good. But in the end Rick and I were frustrated that Krush Groove wasn't as edgy as we wanted. There were a lot of scenes that embarrassed us. They were too bubble-gum. So we decided to make our own movie...Jam Master Jay, D.M.C., Joey, Rick, and I split the cost five ways to make Tougher than Leather, a film about Run DMC being harassed by some gansta types; it also featured the Beasties, Slick Rick, Rick (Rubin) and myself.\"\n\nApproximately about the same time (1987) on the heels of Licensed to Ill's popularity, Def Jam in conjunction with CBS-FOX video released the Beastie Boys self-titled home video. Advertisements for the videos bragged, \"Don't Fight It! Beastievision has arrived!\" The home video featured music videos as well as live footage and even gave fans a taste of the group's off stage exploits. For those that were disappointed by the fact that Beastie Boys Video Anthology DVD did not have any of the Def Jam era videos on it, this out of print home video will fill those gaps in nicely. Perhaps, Def Jam will eventually bring back this title and give it the DVD treatment that it deserves. Fans would likely race out to purchase a revamped version if it contained a commentary track by either Rick Rubin or Russell Simmons.\n\nAdam Horovitz would begin filming his 1989 movie Lost Angels almost immediately following the end of the Licensed to Ill world tour. Diamond and Yauch stayed behind in New York for awhile playing in side-project bands such as Big Fat Love, Brooklyn, and Flophaus Society Orchestra. However, when it became apparent that the band would be leaving Def Jam, all three members relocated to Los Angeles, CA. Home to the film industry, Los Angeles provided the Beastie Boys with a change in scenery and also a change in sound.\n\nThe rarest and most unique Lost Angels promotional item to have turned up on eBay sold for less than $3.00: a pair of promotional slides which were sent to theatres prior to the movie's release. Press kits which include 8\" X10\" black and white photos of Adam Horovitz and the rest of the movie's cast are a fairly common occurrence on eBay. If you watch for Lost Angels items, be forewarned that the movie's soundtrack does not feature any music related to the Beastie Boys.\n\nWith the disappointing sales of the Beastie Boys 1989 release Paul's Boutique, the band decided not to tour; this opened the door for Adam Horovitz to pursue other acting jobs. Although it was not a lead role, he did lend a memorable performance to the 1991 Matt Dillion movie A Kiss Before Dying (it opened on April 26th 1991) and went on to make $14,769,755.00. If you know your Beastie Boys timeline, you will probably realize this movie was in theatres at about the same time that the Beastie Boys were in the studio assembling their 1992 release Check Your Head.\n\nFeeding off of the popularity of Ill Communication, on July 13th 1994 the Recording Industry Association of America (R.I.A.A.) certified the Skills to Pay the Bills home video with its own gold sales award. As was the case with the 1987 self-entitled home video, The Skills to Pay the Bills home video promotional materials were limited to posters. The double-sided posters were sent out to music shops, and very likely many have been lost or destroyed over the years. From time to time though, a The Skills to Pay the Bills advertising poster does come up for auction on eBay.com and usually receives a winning bid of less than $10.00. The Licensed to Ill era home video poster sells for slightly more and due to its age is often found in less than mint condition. It should be noted that the Beastie Boys (1987) home video also earned an R.I.A.A gold sales award on February 17th, 1988.\n\nAs a flood of fans rediscovered the Beastie Boys in 1992, a few fans followed the film exploits of Adam Horovitz and made it a point to see his 1991-1992 movie Roadside Prophets. Although MTV did its best to promote the movie, Roadside Prophets did not do well commercially and earned only $147,724 in the United States. The 16mm print of the film saw a very limited distribution when New Line Cinema originally released it, so both dates 1991 and 1992 are used depending on the source. The official non-theatrical release date was August 15th, 1992.\n\nFollowing the 1992 Check Your Head tour, the Beastie Boys went back to California and recorded Ill Communication which came out in May of 1994. That release date was perfectly timed, since Sabotage went on to be the song that defined that summer. As co-headliners on the Lollapalooza tour the Beastie Boys brought their brand of funk and hip-hop to across the United States and Canada. Even though Sabotage and Sure Shot were still in heavy rotation on MTV, rabid fans raced out to pick up the Sabotage home video the day it went on sale.\n\nThe Sabotage home video was as much about the bands 1992 tour as it was about the music videos from their 1994 album. The combination of raw live performance footage and polished studio produced shorts was the perfect companion piece for what has become a legendary record. By enlisting the help of Ari Marcopoulos, the Beastie Boys put out an hours worth of video excellence that was worthy of the DVD treatment, even though it initially only saw a VHS release. As fate would have it the Sabotage home video has recently been released on DVD. It should be noted that the Sabotage DVD does not contain any extra footage that was not already available on the VHS version.\n\nPromotional items from Cityscrapes Los Angeles are extraordinarily rare compared to those from Horovitzs other movies. For those trying to complete a collection of theatrical posters, the Cityscrapes Los Angeles one-sheet is next to impossible to locate. Hopefully as time goes on some will appear on eBay.com. The auction site has proved to be helpful time and time again for hungry collectors with deep pockets. Considering the attention Cityscrapes Los Angeles has obtained among Beastie Boys fans, it would be interesting to see just how fierce the bidding wars would become if movie props were to surface.\n\nThe first annual Tibetan Freedom Concert was held in San Francisco, California during June of 1996, but it was not until a couple of years later in 1998 that the motion picture Free Tibet finally made its way to screens in a limited theatrical release. The Free Tibet movie is entertaining and educational at the same time. During the summer of 1998 the film actually toured around North American movie theatres and then later was released on DVD complete with an Adam Yauch commentary option. On August 15th, 1998 Much Music interviewed the Beastie Boys prior to their performance in Barrie, Ontario. Yauch was asked about the documentary and he said the following: \"The name of the documentary is Free Tibet and we just signed a deal with Shooting Gallery to distribute it. So it is going to be playing all around, so people should look out for it...it is just going to do some limited showings. They are likely going to tour the print, so it will probably just play one night around here.\" As an added bonus on the Free Tibet DVD, fans can watch the Beastie Boys Tibetan Freedom Concert \"Root Down\" music video which does not appear on any other video or DVD release.\n\nFor many fans the Beastie Boys Video Anthology DVD was a dream come true. Yet others found the double disc collection disappointing. Those who were enthralled with all of the various onscreen options found themselves soaking up hours of previously unreleased remixes and commentary. The largest complaint though was that the DVD collection should have been three discs long and contained videos from the Licensed to Ill period. Another complaint was that although they were rarely shown on MTV, fan favorites such as Jimmy James, \"Root Down (Tibetan Freedom Concert version),\" and the remix video made for the Soul Assassin's version of \"So What'cha Want\" were all left off of the video anthology.\n\nAs with previous releases, there were a few promotional items for the Beastie Boys Video Anthology DVD, T-shirts and posters perhaps being the most common Also, press release packets for the DVD have fetched unexpectedly high bids. Perhaps the nicest promotional item created was the promo-only DVD, which featured the Intergalactic music video and its extras condensed onto one disc.\n\nAfter the Beastie Boys departure the Def Jam Recordings label, it was believed that their interaction with Rick Rubin was nonexistent. Then Jay-Z released the Fade to Black DVD, which changed our perspective. It turns out that there is a scene in this concert documentary where Mike D is over at Rick Rubin's house/recording studio in Los Angeles listening to Jay-Z lay down the vocals for \"99 Problems.\" Although the scene only lasts a few minutes, the DVD is definitely worth buying or renting. In addition to a great concert performance by Jay-Z, you are given an opportunity to look into an alternate universe and see what it would be like if the Beastie Boys had never left Def Jam. Even though you only see Michael in the film, it is not a stretch to imagine Yauch and Horovitz still working along side of Rick Rubin today.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, the Beastie Boys released the Awesome I Fuckin' Shot That DVD. Although some fans \"in select cities\" had already seen the concert film in a movie theater, for most this was their first opportunity to view it. The film feature the Beastie Boys performance at New York's Madison Square Garden back in October of 2004 on the To the Five Boroughs Pagent Tour. As you likely know, the concept of the film was to have 50 people, who were positioned throughout the audience, film the concert. Then, once everyone's footage was collected it would be edited down into a feature film. Thus giving the at home viewer a taste of what it was like to see the Beastie Boys perform live.\n\nSince the release of the DVD, a few Awesome I Fuckin' Shot That promo items have surfaced on eBay. Perhaps the nicest of the lot is the black AIFST t-shirt. Also popping up fairly regularly on eBay are AIFST postcards and posters. None of these items have grown too expensive yet, so now may be the time to snatch them up."
