The film was directed by Rick Rubin and stars the hip-hop group Run–D.M.C. They created the film to coincide with the release of their fourth studio album also titled Tougher Than Leather.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nAt the beginning of the film, D.M.C. is released from prison, at which time he returns to New York City with his band-mates, Run and Jam Master Jay. They are ready to schedule some gigs and kick-start their musical careers when things take a dark turn. Their friend Runny Ray, played by Raymond White, has been murdered by Vic Ferrante (Rick Rubin). This pulls the group into a seedy world of crime and violence.\n\nVic and the police cover up the murder to look like Ray was killed due to a drug deal gone wrong. As the band members attempt to determine who is responsible for the murder, their own lives become endangered. They take matters into their own hands trying to find Ray's killer. The action is balanced with a series of musical performances by the stars and other late 1980s hip-hop stars including Slick Rick and Beastie Boys.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nDarryl McDaniels as \"D.M.C.\"\n\nJoseph Simmons as \"Run\"\n\nJason Mizell as Jay \"Jam Master Jay\"\n\nRichard Edson as Bernie Carteez\n\nRick Rubin as Vic Ferrante\n\nJenny Lumet as Pam\n\nRussell Simmons as himself\n\nAdam Yauch as himself\n\nMike D as himself\n\nAdam Horovitz as himself\n\nSlick Rick as himself\n\nVic Noto as Steve, The Bartender\n\nCritical reaction and release\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile the music usually garners a favorable response, critics generally panned the film. According to The Washington Post, the film is \"vile, vicious, despicable, stupid, sexist, racist and horrendously made.\"[2] It was also described as \"poorly executed and exploitative fare.\"[3] It carried a 43% rating at Rotten Tomatoes.[4]\n\nThe film failed at the box office, but was released on VHS. It is now out of print.\n\nConnections to Blaxploitation\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: List of blaxploitation films\n\nIn response to the negative reactions to the film, critics like Randall Clark have pointed out the many connections between the movie and the history of the \"Blaxploitation\" genre. Much like earlier films such as Shaft and Black Samson, the plot features inner-city anti-heroes who need to take the law into their own hands as they have been neglected by the more traditional avenues of justice.[5]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of hood films\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
