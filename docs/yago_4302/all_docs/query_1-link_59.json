        "text": "Given its social and cultural impact on our lives, it’s hard to believe that hip-hop is only celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. From its beginnings at a party in the Bronx, the culture of hip-hop bloomed and has spread to every corner of the globe.\n\nFilmmakers have been commemorating hip-hop — from its MCs and DJs, to b-boys and girls and fashion icons — in all its glory for decades. Myriad documentaries follow the lives, journeys, successes and downfalls of hip-hop artists from across the U.S. and beyond. As we celebrate hip-hop’s birthday this August, here are five essential hip-hop documentaries to reflect on the magnitude of 50 years of groundbreaking culture.\n\nWild Style\n\nAlso considered the first ever hip-hop motion picture, Wild Style is so close to the truth that it’s more of a documentary. Offering a glimpse into 1981 New York, it stars real-life graffiti artists, musicians, rappers and dancers, portraying hip-hop as a cultural phenomenon alongside genres like punk and new wave.\n\nFeaturing some iconic names including Fab Five Freddy, Lady Pink, the Rock Steady Crew and the Cold Crush Brothers, the film’s vague plot doesn’t matter. Instead, Wild Style captures the essence and grit of New York City when hip-hop was on the precipice. It’s a hugely influential and inspirational part of the canon and a crucial historical document.\n\nHip-Hop Evolution\n\nThis four-part docuseries provides an overview of how hip-hop works and, as its name suggests, plots its evolution from emergence to global recognition. In making the film, MC Shad Kabango intended to explore how hip-hop made a name for itself in the music industry. Through the memories of stars like DJ Kool Herc himself, the Sugarhill Gang, Russell Simmons and Public Enemy, he discovers that the real legacy of hip-hop is how it allowed those without a voice to have their say.\n\nNow four seasons in, this series covers every decade, style and corner of American hip-hop, highlighting the contributions of women like Queen Latifah and Monie Love. Charting key events from Kool Herc's first block party to the early 2020s, this multi-award-winning series is the perfect place to start if you want an overview of hip-hop's development from the perspective of the people who’ve led the way.\n\nNas: Time is ILLMatic\n\nThis 2014 documentary unpacks the events that led to Nas’ 1994 debut album ILLMatic. Through interviews with his father, brother and East Coast hip-hop legends like Pharrell, Alicia Keys and Busta Rhymes, it not only delves into the process of making the album, but of the social context in which he made it.\n\nThe artist said he made ILLMatic with the intention of showing people that hip-hop was changing and becoming something more real. \"I tried to capture it like no one else could,\" he says.\n\nThe documentary’s producers came to make the film from a similar perspective. Co-Producer Erik Parker was writing for Vibe Magazine at the time of the album’s 10th anniversary and realized he couldn’t fit everything he wanted to say about it into a written article. He contacted One9 and together they decided to make this film.\n\nTogether, they ended up delving much deeper into the culture and wanted to reflect the feel of the streets that infuses the album itself. The result is a timeless and absorbing documentary that captures the real essence of the hip-hop scene.\n\nMy Mic Sounds Nice: A Truth About Women And Hip-Hop\n\nWomen are often left out of the conversation around hip-hop, despite their huge successes and significant contributions to the genre. This documentary by renowned filmmaker Ava DuVernay seeks to redress this by focusing on the careers of legends like Missy Elliot, Salt-N-Pepa, Eve, and MC Lyte.\n\nThrough interviews with these artists and and more, My Mic Sounds Nice offers a unique and insightful angle to the discourse around the issues women face in the industry — from sexual objectification to lower pay. With commentary from those who have dominated the rap and hip-hop world for decades but often haven't received the same accolades as their male counterparts, My Mic Sounds Nice is a must-see film.\n\nThe Art of Organized Noize\n\nFocusing on a label rather than the artist, The Art of Organized Noize explores the pioneering producers behind the Dirty South sound. Organized Noize producers Rico Wade, Ray Murray and Sleepy Brown detail how Atlanta shaped the hip-hop world.\n\nRecord label Organized Noize was responsible for supporting the careers of Diddy, Outkast and L.A Reid amongst others — which it famously did from the confines of a dungeon. In a basement room, the Dungeon Family (OutKast, Goodie Mob, Organized Noize and a bunch of local artists) holed up, smoking weed and creating music that would define the region and popular hip-hop.\n\nOrganized Noize built an extraordinary sense of community and comradeship, which comes in interviews with some of its famed roster, as well as from admirers from further afield.\n\nHip-Hop x Siempre\n\nAlthough historically left out of conversations about the genre, “Latinos have been an inherent part of hip-hop from its start,\" Rocio Guerrero, Head of Global Latin at Amazon Music, said in a statement. To wit, Amazon's documentary Hip-Hop x Siempre details the contributions of Latinx artists throughout the culture's 50-year run.\n\nThe Amazon Original includes interviews with Fat Joe, Cypress Hill's B-Real, N.O.R.E., and Residente, and up-and-coming acts such as Eladio Carrión, Villano Antillano, Myke Towers and Snow Tha Product.\n\n\"Latino artists take inspiration from Hip Hop beats and lyrics, infusing them with traditional Latin rhythms to make the genre our own, ultimately aiding in its global reach and relevance,” Guerrero continued, adding that the documentary honors \"this shared history and its impact on our culture by highlighting the diverse and intergenerational voices that are part of the movement.\"\n\n10 Crucial Hip-Hop Albums Turning 30 In 2023: 'Enter The Wu-Tang,' 'DoggyStyle,' 'Buhloone Mindstate' & More\n\nThis year marks the 40th anniversary of Def Jam Recordings, the New York label that made history in hip-hop, R&B, pop, and even thrash metal since its founding, and continues to do so today.\n\nA label that began out of an NYU dorm room in 1984 quickly became an artistic (and business) powerhouse. Early acts like LL Cool J, the Beastie Boys, and Public Enemy were raw, adventurous, and risk-taking. Def Jam's roster opened new pathways in a still-young genre, seemingly every few months.\n\nAfter that initial explosion, the label experienced a brief lull in the early 1990s when one label founder departed and the other expanded into fashion and comedy. Def Jam came roaring back beginning in 1994, and by 1998 the label was home to some of the most popular and influential artists in the game — including burgeoning megastars DMX and Jay-Z. To this day, Def Jam maintains a roster of both commercially successful and critically beloved artists in hip-hop, R&B, and pop.\n\nTo commemorate the anniversary of the label that gave us, well, pretty much everyone, here’s a list of 15 of Def Jam’s essential releases. While Def Jam brought audiences plenty of singles, EPs and remixes, this list primarily focuses on albums. Each project has a mix of artistic merit, popularity, influence and longevity, originality, and played a key role in the story of Def Jam as a whole. Think of it as a chronological run through the key albums that built one of the most lasting labels in modern music.\n\nAnd finally: it must be said that in recent years, a dark shadow has begun to loom over Def Jam’s legacy. Label co-founder Russell Simmons been accused over the past seven years of numerous instances of sexual assault, dating back decades. In spite of these accusations, the label (in which Simmons hasn’t been involved for a quarter-century) remains on top, safeguarding its valuable archive while looking forward to another four decade run as fruitful as the first one.\n\nT La Rock & Jazzy Jay - \"It’s Yours\" (1984)\n\nThe one single on this list is also the first piece of music ever released with the now-famous Def Jam logo. \"It’s Yours\" was a single produced by Def Jam co-founder Rick Rubin — his very first hip-hop production. Instrumentally, it was perhaps only comparable to Larry Smith and Def Jam co-founder Russell Simmons’ contemporaneous work with Run-D.M.C. Both \"It’s Yours\" and D.M.C.’s early work were severely stripped-down, consisting of a few drum sounds, an instrumental stab, and some scratches.\n\nLyrically, though, \"It’s Yours\" is worlds apart from \"Sucker M.C.’s\" — or pretty much anything else going on in hip-hop at the time. T La Rock, the brother of Treacherous Three member Special K, came from a family of educators, and he put every ounce of his erudition into the track. It begins, \"Commentating, illustrating/ Description giving, adjective expert\" and goes from there.\n\nLL Cool J - 'Radio' (1985)\n\nIn the early 1980s, the state of the hip-hop album was very grim. Only a few existed, and they almost exclusively consisted of a few singles mixed with often-confusing filler. Two things changed that. First, Run-D.M.C.’s 1984 self-titled debut, which GRAMMY.com examined in depth a few months ago. Second was LL Cool J’s debut album Radio, the very first full-length album Def Jam ever released.\n\nIn many ways, Radio kicked off hip-hop’s Golden Age. The record shows LL, then still in his teens, as a versatile artist who can be boastful, funny, aggressive, lyrical. The album shows many different sides of his personality, and helped set the template for what a rap album could be.\n\nRead more: 20 Iconic Hip-Hop Style Moments: From Run-D.M.C. To Runways\n\nBeastie Boys - 'Licensed to Ill' (1986)\n\nThe Beasties would release more complex and enlightened albums than Licensed to Ill, and one of the members would eventually apologize for some of its lyrics. But there’s no denying that it was a smash hit. It was the first rap album to ever top the Billboard 200, got the group onstage with Madonna, and would eventually sell over 10 million copies.\n\nWas some of that success due to their race? Sure. They were a credible group, signed to a hot rap label, at a time when it was still novel for white people to be performers in hip-hop. And yet, that’s not the whole story.\n\nLicensed to Ill is a catchy, unique, energetic album, and the group members show undeniable chemistry. To this day, shout-filled, guitar-heavy anthems like \"No Sleep till Brooklyn\" and the ubiquitous \"Fight for Your Right\" can still get the party started.\n\nRead more: The Beastie Boys Provide A License To Party\n\nPublic Enemy - 'It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back' (1988)\n\nThere’s not too much you can say about this album that hasn’t already been said in the years of books, conferences, academic papers, and deluxe re-issues. It has ended up at or near the top of many all-time best lists. Its abrasive, collage-like approach to composition was never equalled (and, in light of current laws and practices around sampling, can never even be approached). The comic stylings of Flavor Flav bring just the right amount of levity to balance Chuck D’s takes on life-and-death issues.\n\nDecades after its release, the album still sounds urgent. And sadly, in an America still roiled with tensions over race, incarceration, drugs, and the media, its concerns remain as relevant as ever.\n\nRead more: 5 Things We Learned At \"An Evening With Chuck D\" At The GRAMMY Museum\n\nSlick Rick - 'The Great Adventures of Slick Rick' (1988)\n\nSlick Rick is the ultimate rap storyteller, and his debut album is the best example of his artistry. \"I wrote them like an essay,\" Rick once said of creating the batch of songs that make up Great Adventures. He also compared it to doing stand-up. So you have exactly what those two reference points imply: stories that are well-constructed, and also frequently riotously funny.\n\nRick is the master of the telling detail (remember \"Dave, the dope fiend shooting dope/ Who don’t know the meaning of water nor soap\" from \"Children’s Story\"?), the humorous twist, the morality tale, the bedtime story, the character voice. His influence lives on in perhaps his most devoted protege, Ghostface Killah, as well as in any rapper who has tried to craft a song with a beginning, middle, and end.\n\nLearn more: Essential Hip-Hop Releases From The 1980s: Slick Rick, RUN-D.M.C., De La Soul & More\n\nWarren G - 'Regulate… G Funk Era'(1994)\n\nA bit of an edge case here, as technically the record was put out by Violator Records and Rush Associated Labels, the latter of which was a sort of umbrella organization Def Jam ran in the mid-1990s. Many albums that could have made this list, including projects by Redman, Onyx, Domino, and Nice & Smooth, were released under the RAL banner. But Warren G’s debut, a giant hit in an era where Def Jam really needed it, became inextricably associated with the label, to the point where an article about the album on Universal Music’s website mentions Def Jam five times in the first two paragraphs.\n\nRegulate is a pop-savvy take on the G-funk sound that was then ascendant. It was a huge success in a year that saw the introduction of tons of amazing rappers into the game. And Warren G being associated with Def Jam meant that the East Coast-centric label had expanded its geographic footprint.\n\nRead more: Warren G Revisits 'Regulate: The G-Funk Era': How The 1994 Album Paved The Way For West Coast Hip-Hop's Dominance\n\nFoxy Brown - 'Ill Na Na' (1996)\n\nDef Jam wasn’t always a friendly place for female artists (despite many of the most important employees being women, including one-time president Nana Ashhurst). In fact, the label didn’t release a rap album by a woman until Nikki D’s Daddy’s Little Girl in 1991. So Foxy Brown’s impact — on Def Jam and on the rap world as a whole — cannot be overstated. Ill Na Na was an album that changed everything for female rappers. It had songs for the clubs, the block, and the radio. Foxy’s sexuality, versatility, and first-class rhyming would have an influence on countless rappers, most famously her number one fan Nicki Minaj, who has been effusively praising Foxy for more than a decade.\n\nRead more: Ladies First: 10 Essential Albums By Female Rappers\n\nDMX - 'It’s Dark and Hell Is Hot' (1998)\n\nNo less an authority than Nas referred to 1998 as \"The year DMX took over the world.\" It’s Dark and Hell Is Hot is how he did it. The album set fire to Bad Boy’s so-called \"shiny suit era\" by embodying its polar opposite: a dark, grimy vision full of gothic synths; raspy, full-throated lyrics; and, sometimes, actual barks. Without DMX, there’s no NYC street rap return: no G-Unit mixtape run, no Diplomats.\n\nThe record is consistent and captivating from start to finish, and its thematic centerpiece comes, appropriately, about halfway through with \"Damien,\" which reminds all of us that the most difficult battles we fight are the ones with ourselves.\n\nJay-Z - 'Vol. 2… Hard Knock Life' (1998)\n\nJay-Z has made more critically beloved albums than Vol. 2 (Reasonable Doubt and The Blueprint both fall in that category). He has made albums with bigger hits (The Blueprint 3 had a No. 1 hit with \"Empire State of Mind\"). But he has never made a more important LP.\n\nVol. 2 was the album that made Jay a superstar. Its Annie-sampling title track (produced by the late 45 King) sent him to the stratosphere — a process he actually documented on his follow-up album. But the record wasn’t just a commercial novelty. It showed Jay at the absolute top of his game: cocky, funny, and brilliant. Case in point: his novel approach to storytelling in \"Coming of Age (Da Sequel),\" where all the important action takes place in just a few seconds, inside the characters’ heads.\n\nRead more: Songbook: How Jay-Z Created The 'Blueprint' For Rap's Greatest Of All Time\n\nLudacris - 'Word of Mouf' (2001)\n\nAround the turn of the millennium, Def Jam had its sights set on conquering new territory. Specifically, the South. So they set up Def Jam South and hired Scarface to head it up. The entity’s biggest success came from an Atlanta DJ who went by Chris Luva Luva on the air, but began rapping as Ludacris.\n\nWord of Mouf was Luda’s second album, but it was the one that really cemented his stardom with songs like \"Rollout (My Business),\" \"Area Codes,\" and the immortal \"Move Bitch\" (the last of which has had an artist-approved second life as a protest chant). The album proved that the South was here to stay, and that Def Jam would have a role in determining its hip-hop future.\n\nLearn more: A Guide To Southern Hip-Hop: Definitive Releases, Artists & Subgenres From The Dirty South\n\nScarface - 'The Fix' (2002)\n\nSpeaking of Scarface and Def Jam South, Face had no intention of dropping music while running the label. But, in his telling, Def Jam exec Lyor Cohen insisted on it, paying handsomely for the privilege.\n\n\"There were so many things working in my favor on that album,\" Scarface wrote in his memoir Diary of a Madman. \"For the first time, I was working on an album for a label that believed in me 100 percent and didn’t want anything from me except for me to make the dopest album I could possibly make. And they went out of their way to make that possible.\"\n\nDef Jam’s history of putting out classics inspired Face on The Fix, he writes in that book. And in the end, the album stands up there with any of them. It is one of only a small handful of rap records to earn a perfect five-mic rating from The Source, and it belongs in that rarified air with projects like Illmatic and Aquemini.\n\nKanye West - 'The College Dropout' (2004)\n\nYes, today Kanye West is the worst: a Hitler-loving, Trump-supporting, paranoid, antichoice, antisemite who stands accused of sexual harrassment. But two decades ago, the world met a Mr. West who at least seemed very different.\n\nThe College Dropout presented an artist who was already extremely well-known as a beatmaker. But Kanye’s carefully crafted persona as the bridge between mainstream rap and the underground — \"First n— with a Benz and a backpack,\" as he put it — meant that he appealed to pretty much everyone. The College Dropout wasn't West at the top of his rap game, but it did show his skill at developing song concepts, at beats, and at creating an artistic vision so powerful, and so relatable, that it captivated an entire generation.\n\nCam’ron - 'Purple Haze' (2004)\n\nIt’s impossible to talk about Def Jam without discussing Roc-A-Fella. Jay-Z’s label hooked up with Def Jam in 1997, and had a years-long hot streak with artists like Kanye, Beanie Sigel, Freeway, the Young Gunz, and of course Cam’ron’s Diplomats crew — Cam, Juelz Santana, and the overall group all released projects there.\n\nPurple Haze came at the very tail end of Roc-a-fella’s golden age. It has Cam at the absolute peak of his absurdist rhyming powers, keeping computers ‘puting and knocking out eight-syllable multis about Paris Hilton like it was nothing. During the Purple Haze era, it was Cam’s world, and we were all just lucky to be living in it.\n\nRihanna - 'Good Girl Gone Bad' (2007)\n\nRihanna’s first two projects were full of Caribbean sounds and ballads. But when her third album came along, she needed a change. Riri wanted to go \"uptempo,\" and history shows that was the right choice. Good Girl Gone Bad began the singer’s transformation into the megastar we know today. It spawned five singles and two separate quickie tie-in albums (Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded and Good Girl Gone Bad: The Remixes).\n\n\"Umbrella\" was the way forward. Rihanna had a No. 1 record prior, but she’d never made a sensation like this. The song (with a guest verse by then-Def Jam president Jay-Z) not only made it to the top slot, it also won a GRAMMY and was undeniably the song of the summer. The album also contained the sensation \"Don’t Stop the Music,\" a track that kickstarted the EDM/pop hybrid that dominated the late aughts. Without Good Girl Gone Bad, it’s safe to say we’d be living in a very different, Fenty-less world.\n\nRead more: Songbook: The Ultimate Guide To Rihanna's Reign, From Her Record-Breaking Hits To Unforgettable Collabs\n\nFrank Ocean - 'Channel Orange' (2012)\n\nOne could fill a whole blurb about Channel Orange simply by quoting the extreme praise it received. \"A singular achievement in popular culture.\" \"Landed with the crash and curiousness of a meteor.\" Two days after its release, Pitchfork was already saying that it \"feels like a classic.\"\n\nAnd yet, somehow even that kind of acclaim doesn’t do the album justice. You really had to be there when it came out, when Frank looked into his soul and, in doing so, connected deeply with so many listeners\n\nRead more: Frank Ocean Essentials: 10 Songs That Embody The Elusive Icon's R&B Genius\n\n\"Channel Orange is the most concentrated version of 2012 in 2012 so far,\" wrote Sasha Frere-Jones at the time, in one of the most dead-on statements about the album. It expressed the contradictions we all lived in. Its fragmentation mirrored the social media that was beginning to take over all of our lives. Ocean left bits of his biography scattered throughout the album, but they almost didn’t matter. He was speaking for all of us, in the way only great artists can.\n\nA Guide To New York Hip-Hop: Unpacking The Sound Of Rap's Birthplace From The Bronx To Staten Island\n\nPRIDE & Black Music Month: Celebrating LGBTQIA+ & Black Voices\n\nMost days of the week, the GRAMMY Museum closes at 6 p.m. But on Thursday, June 6, its doors were open well into the night. As some people filtered through them, others clustered around two rollerskate-clad dancers who synchronized to Aaliyah’s \"Try Again\" on the sidewalk outside the museum at L.A. Live.\n\nThis was Richard \"Swoop\" Whitebear, the professional who choreographed the mononymous singer’s \"Try Again\" music video, and Alicia Reason, a skate coach and performing artist operating at the intersection of professional dance and roller skating. Their fluid movements drew a crowd outside the GRAMMY Museum’s inaugural Hip-Hop Block Party.\n\nThe after-hours soiree, which ran to 11:30 p.m., is one of the larger events that the five-story archive of GRAMMY Award history and winners has ever hosted. Although the Hip-Hop Block Party honored Black Music Month, observed each June, its concept can be traced back to October 2023, when the museum launched \"Hip-Hop America: The Mixtape Exhibit\" in celebration of the genre’s 50th anniversary.\n\n\"The idea for [the party] came from the energy of the exhibit, which celebrates five decades of hip-hop. I was lucky to be a part of curating the exhibit and hosting its opening night, and that experience fueled my passion for continuing to share the story of hip-hop and its journey across cultures,\" says Schyler O’Neal, the Museum’s Manager of Education & Community Engagement.\n\nA grant from L.A.’s Department of Cultural Affairs enabled O’Neal and colleagues to coordinate the one-night-only affair, billed as an opportunity to \"experience the pulse of hip-hop culture like never before.\" Across nine interdisciplinary art demos, activations, and pop-ups encompassing mediums ranging from photography to live music and dance, the GRAMMY Museum made good on this promise while providing a platform to compelling California-grown creatives.\n\n\"Our goal was to shine a spotlight on local talent across the hip-hop spectrum: DJs, MCs, dancers, fashionistas, and photographers. We brought together an awesome lineup to represent the culture,\" O’Neal tells GRAMMY.com.\n\nMany spirited, community-building moments colored the evening. Read on for a snapshot of some of its most memorable.\n\nUraelb Pays Homage To Hip-Hop’s Past, Celebrates Its Present & Embodies Its Future\n\n\"I’m setting the tone at 8 pm,\" Uraelb proclaimed in an Instagram post ahead of the Hip-Hop Block Party. That’s precisely what the L.A. native did when he took the stage at the Clive Davis Theater for the evening’s first vocal performance. Flanked by a drummer, bassist, pianist and two supporting vocalists, UrealB opened with a performance of his original song, \"Brace Face.\"\n\nHe created a culture of artist participation by encouraging the crowd to smile and later, to sing along to his buttery-smooth rendition of OutKast’s \"So Fresh, So Clean.\" From there, UraelB’s \"homage to hip-hop\" crossed coasts and generations, culminating in a pumped-up cover of Kendrick Lamar’s \"King Kunta.\"\n\n\"If I leave you with anything, I want to leave you with a deep appreciation for hip-hop,\" he said before closing with another one of his own productions, \"Groovy.\"\n\nUraelb first performed at the GRAMMY Museum as part of its educational program INDUSTRY SESSIONS. \"[Uraelb] made such an impression during that class that we said, ‘we’ve gotta have him come perform at one of our events,’\" O’Neal said just before the activation started.\n\nOver the years, INDUSTRY SESSIONS — open to creatives 18 years and older — and the GRAMMY Museum’s other music education programs, have attracted a host of talent, including Giveon and Billie Eilish.\n\nLarry \"Ruin\" Combs Krumps to MJ’s \"They Don’t Care About Us\"\n\nTo celebrate hip-hop’s history and culture is to appreciate dance’s inextricability from the music — and vice versa. On the Ray Charles Terrace, professional krumper Larry \"Ruin\" Combs nodded to South Central L.A., where krumping was born, in an impassioned performance to Michael Jackson’s \"They Don’t Care About Us.\"\n\nA powerful medium of self-expression, krumping is a street dance that evolved from clowning, another style of dance with roots in African and Caribbean culture. Krumping is characterized by sharp, quick, and vigorous movements, like chest pops, stomps, and arm swings, used to convey emotion. Krumpers have historically turned to the art form to release negative or charged emotions and to navigate difficult experiences and circumstances.\n\nHence the title of the dance special that Combs is crafting, \"The ‘e’ in ‘Krump’ is silent.\"\n\n\"A lot of what Krump presents is very emotional; you see it, you don’t hear it,\" a nearly breathless Combs told the event co-host Leslie \"Big Lez\" Segar. \"That’s what the format of the show is going to be like — various types of music that tug at your emotions, from good to bad.\"\n\nWhile additional details about the forthcoming special are limited, those interested can follow Combs — who has notably performed on \"America’s Got Talent\" and the season finale of \"So You Think You Can Dance.\"\n\nCross Colours & Black Design Collective Dress For Success\n\nThe GRAMMY Museum's attention to curating an event that celebrated the whole of hip-hop culture was especially apparent in the block party’s inclusion of a fashion show.\n\nCross Colours — a clothing brand launched in 1989 by Carl Jones, who studied fashion at the Otis Parson School of Design and Trade Technical College in L.A. — dressed local models from the Black Design Collective, a group of accomplished fashion industry professionals of color. The collective's goals include amplifying the influence of and creating opportunities for a global community of Black apparel, accessory and costume designers.\n\nTheir partnership paved the way to a striking fashion show, during which more than five models circled the museum’s third floor, donning a variety of garments ranging from T-shirts with brightly-hued graphic designs to overalls.\n\nNANA Shows Off His Lyrical Muscle — And A Different Strain Of Hip-Hop\n\nCrenshaw resident NANA contrasted the polished, funk-soul of Uraelb’s activation with a squeaky-clean spitting session. And while the storyteller’s quick tongue and lyrical muscle translated to a well-practiced performance that would have made anyone in attendance think he rehearsed for days pre-show, NANA had only 24 hours’ notice.\n\nAs host O’Neal told it during a brief Q&A at the event, his request for NANA to take the stage at the block party (\"I need your energy there!\" he recalled telling NANA) came while the rapper was in the middle of a studio session. About a day later, NANA was holding a microphone in the Clive Davis Theater.\n\nNANA, who credited Nas, Jay-Z, Tupac, Kendrick Lamar, and Snoop Dogg among those on his \"long list\" of inspirations, is notably featured in the \"Rap City Experience\" section of the GRAMMY Museum’s \"Hip-Hop America: The Mixtape Exhibit,\" to which he contributed freestyles.\n\nFive Decades Of Hip-Hop Are On Display\n\nWhat’s better than a birthday cake? Try a 5,000-square-foot exhibit that traces hip-hop from its humble beginnings in the Bronx and New York City to the GRAMMY stage. On Oct. 7, 2023, the GRAMMY Museum opened \"Hip-Hop America: The Mixtape Exhibit,\" in honor of hip-hop’s 50th anniversary. Offering a focused, expansive (and tactile) look at the genre’s history and profound influence, the exhibit features a \"sonic playground\" complete with five interactive stations for DJing, rapping, and sampling.\n\nA retrospective educational journey, \"Hip-Hop America\" canvasses hip-hop scenes, sounds, and fashion across generations. Take, for example, the Notorious B.I.G.’s iconic red leather pea jacket, displayed in the same showcase as Migos’ embroidered blazers. The must-see exhibit exploring hip-hop’s long, rich, and still evolving history runs through Sept. 4.\n\nLearn more: Inside The GRAMMY Museum’s New Exhibit, \"Hip-Hop America\": From Dapper Dan To Tupac’s Notes\n\nHip-Hop Universal Provides A Formidable Finale\n\nSegar and Swoop, who worked with O’Neal to curate the evening’s dance performances, assembled what can only be described as a mic drop of a finale to the block party’s activations: Hip Hop Universal. The ensemble of five professional dancers and choreographers included Swoop, Robert \"Rautu\" Harris, Leon \"No Realer\" Spann, Marlyn Ortiz, and Ronnie \"Futuristic Astaire\" Willis.\n\nSome of their individual choreography and dance credits include an array of megastars, from Madonna, Taylor Swift, and Usher, to Britney Spears, Dr. Dre, and the Backstreet Boys. Over the course of their collaborative performance, which alternated between group dances and solos, Hip-Hop Universal made minutes feel like seconds — a testament to their rapturous synergy and individual expertise.\n\nUnity On The Dancefloor\n\nAt the heart of hip-hop — a genre in which artists pride themselves on representing their cities, perhaps more so than in any other genre of music — is community. That sense of community was apparent even through the schedule of programming. Activations occurred one at a time, in succession. This structure created a sense of togetherness; attendees collectively enjoyed a given activation and made their way to the next one together.\n\nThe spirit of community imbued both the block party’s schedule and the content of its activations, but it was perhaps most visible on The Ray Charles Terrace. There, near the end of the evening, as the crowd awaited the final activation (and even afterwards), nearly all in attendance could be found dancing in the crisp, open air to beats spun by DJ R-Tistic.\n\n\"This is our first time doing this, and I think we gotta keep doing this,\" O’Neal remarked on the mic. The crowd’s response — a resounding cacophony of affirmative cheers and applause — was answer enough.\n\n\"Everyone, from the talent to the staff to the hundreds of guests, [were] getting down together with the electric slide. That's what it was all about: bringing folks together for a good time,\" he concluded.\n\nInside The GRAMMY Museum’s New Exhibit, \"Hip-Hop America\": From Dapper Dan To Tupac’s Notes\n\nIn the canon of West Coast hip-hop, Warren G’s debut album, Regulate: The G-Funk Era is considered one of the greatest.\n\nReleased on June 7, 1994, the album remains a perfect snapshot of the g-funk era, the popular subgenre of gangsta rap that was all the rage in the early- to mid '90s. \"I created the genre, but I was introduced to it by Above the Law,\" Warren G tells GRAMMY.com.\n\nHeadlining that album is of course, Warren G and Nate Dogg’s iconic track \"Regulate,\" tapping that four-bar sample from Doobie Brother Michael McDonald’s \"I Keep on Forgettin’.\" But the album features a number of other hits including \"This D.J.\" and \"So Many Ways,\" a remix version later appearing on the Bad Boys soundtrack.\n\n\"Regulate\" the single first arrived on the star-studded soundtrack for Above the Rim, released via Death Row Records in the spring of 1994, and sold over 2 million domestic copies in the year of its release. Then a few months later, Warren reintroduced \"Regulate\" on his inaugural album. The 12-track Regulate: The G-Funk Era provided a full vision of The Regulator's uber smooth brand of g-funk which rang out from the 213 all around the world.\n\nThanks to pioneers like Above the Law, Dr. Dre, DJ Quik, and Warren G, g-funk (or gangsta funk) became the definitive sound of West Coast hip-hop. Regulate: The G-Funk Era was so impactful that it was even nominated for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group at the 1995 GRAMMYs.\n\nLike Dre's The Chronic, many continue to be drawn to Regulate’s depiction of Southern California life, replete with endless sunshine and maxed-out cars blasting pioneer speakers. Regulate is also the story of Warren G, a personal album which gives love to the community and people he came up with (\"I played ball through the halls of CIS / With Snoop Dogg's big brother, call him Dirty Left,\" he raps on \"This D.J.\", referencing College Intermediate School in Long Beach ).\n\nWith Regulate, self-described \"outlaw\" Warren G made a platform for himself and some of his disciples. Album features the Twinz, an LBC duo consisting of twin brothers Deon and Dewayne Williams, and the Dove Shack, whose summer anthem \"This is the Shack\" (later reprised on the group’s own album with the same title a year later), took the West Coast hip-hop world by storm. Though the great crooner Nate Dogg died more than a decade ago, 213, the Long Beach collective of Warren G, Snoop Dogg and Nate Dogg lives on. Warren and Snoop just released the single \"Cali 2 Canada,\" in advance of an upcoming tour.\n\nRegulate was Warren G's first release after effectively being exiled from Death Row Records, where his halfbrother and mentor Dr. Dre, not to mention Long Beach pals Snoop Dogg and Nate Dogg thrived. Warren signed with Def Jam Records in 1994, and his debut release helped save the label from serious debt: Regulate: The G-Funk Era sold 3 million copies in the U.S. and debuted at No. 2 on the U.S. Billboard Top 200 albums chart.\n\nAs we look back on 30 years since Regulate the G-Funk Era, GRAMMY.com connected with Warren G himself to look back on five ways the album paved the way for west coast hip-hop today.\n\nIt Solidified Long Beach AsA Hip-Hop Mecca\n\nWarren G isn’t the first Long Beach rapper who made waves during this era. There’s Snoop, of course, as well as Missouri-born, Long-Beach raised Domino. But Regulate: The G-Funk Era feels like a whole album about place, giving love to the LBC on every track with people and places like 21 and Lewis, King’s Park, the Voltron Crew, and Cal State Long Beach as Warren shouts them out on tracks like \"Regulate\" and \"This D.J.\"\n\nWarren acknowledges that there were the realities of the streets, but also plenty of fun to be had growing up, too, including listening to old records for hours together with his father. \"Coming up in Long Beach was fun. We had a lot of sports. Lot of neighborhood activities as far as King’s Park,\" Warren G tells GRAMMY.com. \"It was fun. It was dangerous. It was cool. It was my home.\"\n\nVoltron Crew is Warren’s group of friends he used to sell candy with while having rap battles. Warren impressed the crew by rapping the lyrics to some of Dre's yet-to-be-released material, including \"Cabbage Patch.\" \"'Damn Warren, you’re harder than a motherf—a,'\" he recalled his friends saying with a laugh.\n\nAnd then there’s Warren’s beloved VIP Records on Pacific Coast Highway which Warren calls an LBC \"landmark.\" He and his friends would walk down there after school to listen to music as one DJ after another queued up inside of the institution to spin. \"It was just fun for us to be able to see that and listen to good music at the same time,\" Warren adds.\n\nIt Made Nate Dogg A Star\n\nThe late great Nate Dogg was already on the rise on the West Coast with early vocals on Dre’s \"Deeez Nuuuts,\" Mista Grimm ft. Warren G’s \"Indo Smoke,\" and Snoop’s \"Ain’t No Fun.\" But the titular track \"Regulate\" made him soar. While Nate is given a featured credit, he’s lockstep with Warren during the entire song, matching Warren’s lyricism with his own hybrid style of singing and rapping that had never been seen in hip-hop before and hasn’t been seen since.\n\nBack in those days, hip-hop often didn’t really promote its hookmen and women — much less feature them prominently in their music videos. (Consider Nate’s Bay Area contemporary Mike Marshall, who sings the hook on Luniz’s classic \"I Got 5 On It,\" but unfortunately isn’t remembered beyond West Coast hip-hop diehards.) But Nate made himself seen and heard on \"Regulate.\"\n\nIt’s no coincidence he went on to become the go-to hook singer in California and beyond, working with everyone from Tupac and Ludacris, to French hip-hop group Psy 4 de la Rime. Nate Dogg passed away in 2011 at age 41.\n\nIt Presented A Different Version Of West Coast Gangsta Rap\n\nWhen compared to some of his contemporaries, Regulate: The G-Funk Era focused less on hardcore themes in favor of keeping things light and smooth. Even \"Regulate\" itself — which is about Nate and Warren dealing with a carjacking on a cool and clear California night — the Mississippi-born crooner who grew up in a Gospel choir always had a way of keeping things mellow.\n\nRegulate: The G-Funk Era also speaks to the turbulent climate of ‘90s inner-city Los Angeles. While Dre’s The Chronic might be more overt about it, Warren goes there too on songs like on the album’s third single, \"Do You See,\" whose beat mashes up Mtume’s \"Juicy Fruit\" and Junior’s \"Mama Used to Say.\" Much of that song, Warren G says, is personal.\n\n\"I just talked about everything I was going through, ya know, Snoop being in jail,\" he recounts. \"Mista Grimm is my dog. But he was doing things that just wasn’t cool…But I forgave him for all of that still. Even though I talked about it in the song. I forgave him 'cause that was my dog. He’s still my dog.\"\n\n\"Do You See\" speaks about realities beyond the LBC, too. It opens with a sample from Gil Scott-Heron’s 1976 fiery spoken word piece \"Bicentennial Blues\": \"The blues has always been totally American… as American as apple pie… the question is why?...Well, America provided the atmosphere.\"\n\n\"I had listened to that particular [song] and everything he said was what I was going through. It blew me away,\" Warren says.\n\nIt Introduced Us The Dove Shack, Twinz & Jah Skillz\n\nAfter not being able to get footing in Death Row, Warren G struck out on his own. He built his own roster of lesser-known talent on G-Funk Music, under the parent label Def Jam Recordings, and brought in Dove Shack (C-Knight, Bo-Roc and 2Scoops), the Twinz, and Jah Skillz, part of the larger female group Da 5 Footaz —who all got the G-Child cosign. Each artist debuted on Regulate: The g-funk Era, with summertime anthem \"This is The Shack,\" an album standout.\n\nMany of Warren G's guest features went on to have their own careers. Dove Shack member C-Knight recently passed away and Bo-Roc, a crooner in his own right, went on to work with other West Coast legends like Richie Rich, Daz Dillinger, and Foesum. Twinz, meanwhile, turned bass-heavy feature \"Recognize\" into the full-fledged Conversation in 1995, a g-funk album that gave us one of Warren G’s greatest beats, \"Journey Wit Me,\" featuring Bo-Roc.\n\nAs for Jah Skillz, she’s front and center for the entirety of \"Super Soul Sis,\" and wastes not a single word. Da 5 Footaz went on to appear on the Jason’s Lyric and Set It Off soundtracks.\n\nIt Gave G-funk Its Timeless Credo\n\nA few people are credited for launching g-funk, but Warren G’s timeless credo: \"g-funk, where rhythm is life and life is rhythm,\" in the waning moments of \"Regulate\" and \"And Ya Don’t Stop\" remains a classic to this day.\n\nOn his 1997 sophomore album Take a Look Over Your Shoulder and 1999's I Want It All, Warren G always shouted out gangsta funk. He also stayed true to the sound that spread west coast hip-hop worldwide: By 2001, a couple of years after the g-funk era fully ended, Warren defiantly proclaimed that \"g-funk is Here to Stay\" on Return of the Regulator.\n\nIn 2015, he even put out an EP, Regulate... G-Funk Era, Part II, featuring unreleased music with his longtime partner Nate. From 1994 through 2024, Warren has consistently carried the flag of g-funk, the original west coast sound that he helped cement with Regulate The g-funk Era, 30 years ago.\n\nA Guide To Southern California Hip-Hop: Definitive Releases, Artists & Subgenres From L.A. & Beyond"
