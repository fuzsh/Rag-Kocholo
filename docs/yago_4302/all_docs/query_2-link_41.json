Queens to the kleig-lit heights of pop music fame. It is a story that has inspired important music makers for the last 15 years, including the Beastie Boys, Will Smith, Public Enemy, NWA, Master P, Jay-z, Kid Rock, Limp Bizkit and Eminem-all of whom know who opened the door for them. And now it can inspire you. 'Tougher Than Leather' was originally published in 1987 and is reissued here in a new edition, a must have for any serious music fan and authored by Run DMC publicist Bill Adler.Although the individual members of Run-DMC and their manager Russell Simmons have all published books about their lives in recent years, there is only book devoted solely to the career of Run-DMC. Tougher Than Leather tells the inside story of Run-DMC's astonishing rise from the obscurity of Hollis, Queens to the heights of pop music fame.When the trio first teamed up in the spring of 1983, rap music was scarcely more than a weird little blip on the pop culture radar screen. Three-and-a-half years later -- thanks largely to the blazing nonstop success of Run-DMC -- rap music and hiphop culture were on arena tours from coast to coast in America. In England, Europe, and Japan. On radio and MTV. On the cover of Rolling Stone. And in the movies. Nothing slowed them down, not the refusal of radio to play their records, the outbursts of violence at their concerts, or the condemnation of their music by the Parents Music Resource Center.Hailed as \"the Beatles of rap,\" Run-DMC paved the way for the Def Jam label and toured with such future stars as the Beastie Boys, LL Cool J, Public Enemy, and Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince."
