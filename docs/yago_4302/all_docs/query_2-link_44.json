        "meta_description": "How do you weather the changes in a genre your band helped define? It's tricky. Run-DMC tried to rebrand with Tougher Than Leather, the title of both an album and a film directed by their producer Rick Rubin. A tough yet strangely naive premonition of the gangsta rap years to come, it also features one of Rubin's other proteges, The Beastie Boys, just as their career took off.\n\nIt's got serious time capsule value, then, so it's no wonder it prompts hosts Graham and Jeff to reflect on the odd experience of being a white hip-hop fan in the late 1980s and 90s, a time when the genre was subject to both fetishisation and moral panic from our fellow honkies. We also discuss the unexpected links this film has to movies by James Grey and Jonathan Demme, formative 'adult' cinema and the parallel universe where this film was directed by Spike Lee. Turns out we can, in fact, rock it like this.\n\nSend your checks, thugs and, indeed, rock and roll over to our Patreon, where we have a massive bounty for subscribers including a monthly bonus episode of this podcast, reviews of Asian films that lack UK distribution, twice-weekly reviews of classic series Doctor Who, and our TV and film podcast Last Night... where Geek Show hosts get together to chew the fat about what they've been watching.

        "text": "When David and Graham are on the show together, you should be on high alert for a camp catastrophe, and lord do we get it in the form of Ken Hughes's Sextette. An innuendo-stuffed sex farce starring Mae West, it could have been a smash hit if it was made in the 1930s, when she was in her forties. Instead, it was made in the 1970s, when she was 84, and the result is the vanity project to end all vanity projects.\n\nJoin us as we discuss the star-studded cast, including a relentlessly hammy Keith Moon, an unrecognisable Alice Cooper, and Ringo Starr; discuss ways in which an OAP sex comedy could actually have worked; catalogue the film's strange relationship to both Britain and the laws of physics; and talk about Sextette's unbelievable musical numbers. Plus, discover the secret of Mae West's shoes and find out how true love brought David to this highly special film. Aww.\n\nIf you want to hear our scandalous secret memoirs, well, tough. But if you sign up to our Patreon you can get a bonus episode of this show every month, plus exclusive written articles on The X-Files, cinema's most niche genres, Red Dwarf and classic Asian genre cinema. At the end of every month we've also got a fun, chaotic podcast called Last Night..., about our month's most memorable viewing, which like all this content isn't available anywhere else. Follow us on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook to find out more.\n\nWhat was the British pop movie like before The Beatles? They were quite a lot like What a Whopper, as Graham and Mark discover this week. A featherweight farce in which a struggling writer and his bohemian friends try to fake a Loch Ness Monster sighting - just go with it, OK - it features a plethora of British comedy legends, a script by Dalek creator Terry Nation, and, as its lead, one Adam Faith.\n\nIt's easy to forget what a massive name Faith was in his heyday, and our hosts examine every aspect of his wild career, from his other acting roles in Budgie and Beat Girl through his career in financial advice to his delightful last words. We also discuss the real-life Loch Ness Monster hoaxes that may have inspired Nation's script, the tragic life of female lead Carol Leslie, the film's not-wholly-unstereotypical vision of Scotland and the state of Michael Winner's finances. It's a monster of an episode!\n\nIf you don't want to see us reduced to hoaxing cryptids to make ends meet, you can donate to our Patreon, where you'll get a bonus episode of this podcast every month. There's a new one, about the classic blaxploitation movie Truck Turner, out in just one day's time! You also get written reviews of The X-Files, Red Dwarf and classic Asian genre cinema, and our monthly miscellany podcast Last Night... Follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to find out more.\n\nGet your motor running, head out on the highway... wait, it's not that Peter Fonda-starring 1960s biker movie. No, The Wild Angels came a few years before Easy Rider, and it centres around a noticeably less idealistic group of bikers. Director Roger Corman hired several real Hell's Angels to serve as extras in his film, and if you're thinking there's probably stories from that set, you're right.\n\nLet Ben and Graham tell you them: from Corman's sociological reasons for having Bruce Dern's character work at an oil refinery to the unexpected trouble he had involving a coffin and the letter \"Z\". And, because this is Pop Screen, we also talk about the film's musical legacy - Primal Scream are certainly fans - and its female lead Nancy Sinatra. whose career teaches us many valuable lessons. Here's one: if you're accused of being a nepo baby, why not get together with an incredibly rum country singer and release a series of duets that are so unwholesome as to sound actively diseased? All this and Frank Sinatra's prog album, discussed herein!\n\nIf you wanna get loaded, and have a good time, there are few better venues than our Patreon, where you'll find a bonus episode of this show every month, plus two exclusive podcasts concerning cult genre franchises (From the Video Aisle) and whatever we feel like (Last Night...). There's also written articles on cult Asian genre cinema, Red Dwarf and The X-Files, plus plenty more - follow us on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook to find out more.\n\nWhat do you get if you combine the most divisive woman in 1970s America, the least divisive woman in modern America, and a comedy legend? You get an absolute treat, at least if it goes as well as Nine to Five did. Colin Higgins's film brings together Jane Fonda, Dolly Parton and Lily Tomlin in a class-conscious romp about three women who kidnap their sexist pig of a boss and find the office runs a lot better without him. It's basically The Communist Manifesto with a thumping C&W theme song.\n\nThis week, Graham treats himself after self-harming with The Idol by getting back together with Jeff to talk about this lasting classic of early '80s Hollywood. Prepare for an in-depth comparison of the many beards of Sterling Hayden, an appreciation of Jane Fonda's shrewdly against-type performance, and our pitch for a Dolly Parton horror movie.\n\nPatreon - what a way to make a living! Subscribe today and you can hear Graham and Aidan talking about Fred Durst's The Fanatic in an exclusive Pop Screen episode, plus our end-of-month round-up podcast Last Night..., written reviews of The X-Files and Red Dwarf, classic far eastern genre cinema reconsidered in Fantastic Asia, and more. Follow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for more.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, The Weeknd. To celebrate - 'celebrate' - the first anniversary of one of the defining pop star ego trips of our age, Graham and Robyn have reconvened to look at all six - no, wait, all five - episodes of Sam Levinson's disasterpiece. If you're wondering why we won't get a third season of Euphoria until the cast are in a retirement home, forget the writer's strike - this is why.\n\nFrom the twisted minds of Robyn and Graham, please enjoy discussion of: the Weeknd's remarkable anti-charisma and his future acting plans that will definitely, definitely happen, the troubled production of this show and the Amy Seimetz cut we'll never see, The Idol's strained relationship with queerness, its downright nonexistent relationship with modern pop, and much much more. Worth listening this week just for the Jojo Siwa joke, frankly.\n\nOur exclusives are about something even more interesting than LA club owners nobody's ever heard of - classic Asian genre cinema, Red Dwarf, cult film franchises, Doctor Who, The X-Files, and whatever the hell our critics have been watching in the last month. In case your thirst for watching us suffer hasn't been sated by this episode, we've also got a Patreon exclusive episode of this show about Fred Durst's The Fanatic coming up. Follow us on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook for more.\n\nBack with a vengeance! Yes, ahead of the release of Furiosa, we're looking at the Mad Max movie that features the most legendary pop star in the whole series (well, apart from the Doof Warrior): Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. Initially reviled for its lighter tone and child sidekicks, the film now feels like a stepping stone to the operatic excesses George Miller has taken the franchise to in the 21st century - and Tina Turner as Aunty Entity is a piece of stunt-casting that truly works.\n\nThis week, Producer Rob rejoins the show to talk about all things Mad Max, including the series's fascinatingly improvisatory attitude towards continuity, the extent to which Max Rockatansky obeys Joseph Campbell's laws of heroism, and the absolute goldmine of memorable quotes this movie contains. It's two podcasters enter, and, er, two podcasters leave - but not before revealing this film's unexpected place in hip-hop history...\n\nCome to our Barter Town over at Patreon, where you can exchange your money for a monthly bonus episode of the show - we've just covered every single pop star appearance on Doctor Who, from the Beatles to Billie Piper - plus written articles on classic Asian cinema, The X-Files and red Dwarf. Backers also get two bonus podcasts: the unclassifiable miscellany of Last Night... and the methodical run-through of cult franchises that is From the Video Aisle. Follow us on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram to find out more\n\nWe've covered plenty of biopics of musical legends on this podcast, and one word has hovered unspoken in the background: Cox. Dewey Cox, that is, the legendary rocker played by John C Reilly in Jake Kasdan's Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story. A musical innovator, a tortured genius, a tireless advocate for small people's rights... he didn't exist, of course, but this spoof is so beautifully observed it doesn't really matter.\n\nLet's duet! This week, Mark Harrison of Film Stories rejoins Graham to look at the film that makes it impossible to watch any other biopic without giggling inappropriately at all the sad parts. We discuss the cameos that were cut, the gruelling promotional tour Reilly embarked on in support of the film, and which of 2024's biopics include scenes from this film played dead straight. It's a beautiful ride, alright.\n\nIf you want to buy us a sink to replace the ones we broke during our dark period, you can donate to our Patreon, where you'll get a monthly bonus episode of this very show, plus two other podcasts not available anywhere else - From the Video Aisle, looking at cult favourite franchises, and the unclassifiable Last Night... We also do written articles on classic television science fiction and Asian genre films, and much more besides. Follow us on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook for more.\n\nJohn Singleton was 21 - 21! - when he made one of the most acclaimed debuts of the 1990s, one which led to him becoming the first African-American to get a Best Director nomination at the Oscars. It would be the perfect punchline if it was bad, but annoyingly for this deeply unserious podcast it's great: a frontline dispatch from a world plagued by violence and poverty that still feels vital, and also finds room for more humour and tenderness than you might expect.\n\nJoin Rob and Graham as they discuss this landmark film and its star Ice Cube, then perhaps the most controversial music star in America, now a reliable, familiar presence in all kinds of movies. They also discuss the film's unexpected inspiration, its heartbreaking ending and venture a cheeky but probably-accurate guess as to why there are so many movies about gentrification. Plus: hot takes on gangsta rap from early '90s political columnists that have not aged as well as this movie!\n\nIf you don't want us to be drawn into the terrible gang culture that surrounds podcasting, you can give us some money over at our Patreon, where in return you'll get a bonus episode of this show every month. We also have no less than two podcasts - Last Night... and From the Video Aisle - and we give you weekly written reviews of Red Dwarf, The X-Files and Doctor Who.\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook to learn more.\n\nSam Taylor-Johnson is about to release Back to Black, her second music biopic following 2009's Nowhere Boy. So naturally Pop Screen decided to review... her EL James adaptation? Yeah, why not, it's got Rita Ora in it. Returning co-host Joe did a lot of Ritasearch for this podcast and was delighted to remember that she only has about a minute of screentime.\n\nNot that there's any shortage of other things to talk about when it comes to 50 Shades of Grey. Its status as a cultural phenomenon, its dubious sexual politics, its troubled production and long list of nearly-stars... all of this and more is covered in this dangerously erotic edition of Pop Screen. We also explain why Christian Grey's chauffeur is the secret hero of these movies, and reveal what the Frenchest film ever made is. It's not this one.\n\nIf you don't want us to be financially dependent on a creepy billionaire who uses us as sex slaves, you can donate to our Patreon where we're about to drop an exclusive episode on the 1994 police thriller The Glass Key, as well as publishing written reviews of Red Dwarf, The X-Files and Doctor Who every week. Patreon backers also get two whole podcasts that aren't available anywhere else: From the Video Aisle is in the middle of a Mr. Vampire retrospective, and the movie and TV miscellany that is Last Night... comes out every month as well. Follow us on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram for more information.\n\nThere are some pop movies that capture the appeal of an entire genre. Such was the case with Perry Henzell's The Harder They Come, a crime drama that was such a hit it essentially popularised reggae in the United States. Such things are possible only with a star of the calibre of Jimmy Cliff, plus soundtrack and screen appearances from the likes of Toots and the Maytals and Prince Buster.\n\nThis week, Aidan rejoins Graham to talk about Henzell's film, and uncover the reason why he might be the ultimate Pop Screen director. We also talk about Chris Blackwell's Island Records, whose film division was launched by this very movie. There's also discussion of the film's real-life inspiration, the \"original rude boy\" Ivanhoe Martin, its possible subtexts and the white-knuckle experience of watching that bus swerving all over the place during the opening credits.\n\nIf you want to keep us from plying our trade as door-to-door gardeners, you can donate to our Patreon and get a monthly bonus episode of this show, plus two exclusive podcasts not available anywhere else - From the Video Aisle, which is currently working its way through the Mr. Vampire series, and the completely unclassifiable Last Night... There are also weekly written reviews of Doctor Who, The X-Files and Red Dwarf, plus a monthly pick of a classic Asian genre film in Fantastic Asia. Follow us on Twitter, Instagram or Facebook for more.\n\nwww.patreon.com/thegeekshow\n\nIn 2024, Pop Screen is spending a month in Jamaica, hailing the island's mighty presence in the field of music. And to kick off, we're talking about... er, 10cc? Yes, when they said they don't like reggae, they love it, few could have expected that love would manifest itself in multi-instrumentalist Lol Creme directing a 1991 Jamaican comedy about a small-town eccentric who thinks he can talk to trees, cows and cricket balls becoming involved with a lusty German photographer. As you do.\n\nThe Lunatic is, as you can probably tell from the above synopsis, a weird old thing. Fortunately Graham and Mark Cunliffe have re-teamed in order to make it even weirder, with digressions about the original TV version of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, how Small Axe got Graham through the first lockdown year, and the film's tonal similarity to the saucy seaside postcards of Donald McGill. We're not in love - but we did enjoy it.\n\nIf you'd like to throw a bit of spare change at your local village idiots, we've got a Patreon which is just about to drop an episode on the Neil Young/Devo collaboration Human Highway. We've also been covering everything from Mr. Vampire to Neighbours in our other podcasts Last Night... and From the Video Aisle, as well as writing reviews of Doctor Who, classic Asian genre films, The X-Files and Red Dwarf. Follow us on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram to find out more.\n\nIn 2004, the veteran Welsh rock band The Alarm pulled off an audacious hoax, releasing their single '45 RPM' under the alias of The Poppy Fields. The Poppy Fields were supposedly a new band of teenage rock stars in skinny jeans, as was the style at the time. As the song ascended the charts, Alarm mainman Mike Peters revealed the deception, kicking off a debate about ageism in the music industry.\n\nIt's a fascinating story, so fascinating that Mick has dragged himself out of his sickbed to talk to Graham about Vinyl, the 2012 film loosely based on it. We discuss its many missed opportunities, its bizarre decision to make the Mike Peters analogue more or less totally unsympathetic, and the question of whether this con would work in 2012 - which is more of a cultural gap than the eight years it is on paper. We also discuss The Alarm's long career, the rock movie baggage of star Phil Daniels, and the irony that - these days - a middle-aged heritage act is a better money-spinner than a sexy young rock band.\n\nWe don't pretend to put out a load of extra content on our Patreon - we actually do it, including a monthly bonus episode of this show (the latest one is about Priscilla), exclusive podcasts Last Night..., about anything our critics have watched this month, and From the Video Aisle, reviewing cultishly adored franchises, as well as written pieces on classic Asian genre cinema and British and American TV science fiction. Follow us on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook to find out more.\n\nwww.patreon.com/thegeekshow\n\nGood vibes only this week, as Mark Cunliffe of We Are Cult rejoins the podcast to talk about Cyndi Lauper's lead role in the 1988 supernatural comedy Vibes. A film so inspired by Ghostbusters that Dan Aykroyd was briefly attached to star, it has an enviable cast fronted by Lauper, Jeff Goldblum and Peter Falk. And yet, somehow, it tanked.\n\nOn this episode of Pop Screen, then, we attempt to solve the timeless Fortean mystery of why people didn't watch this at the time, taking detours to talk about the career of supporting players Julian Sands (RIP) and Steve Buscemi, consider the odd self-seriousness with which 1980s family comedies treat their paranormal mythos, try to ascertain what the worst Dario Argento film is and talk about a Winnebago full of balloons, I guess. It's one of those weeks.\n\nTomorrow sees the release of our latest Patreon exclusive episode, about Sofia Coppola's Priscilla. Subscribers also get two bonus podcasts a month - Last Night... and From the Video Aisle, the latter of which is prepping a Mr. Vampire retrospective - plus written reviews of classic Asian genre cinema, Doctor Who, The X-Files and Red Dwarf. Follow us on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to find out more...\n\nMemo to you: Pop Screen is back for 2024 and we're covering one of the wildest, most controversial and most ambitious rock movies of the 1970s. Starring Mick Jagger among a motley cast of models, gangsters, boxers and one father of a national embarrassment, Performance saw Nicolas Roeg and Donald Cammell join forces for a joint debut like no other.\n\nOn this episode, Rob and Graham reunite to talk about the film's turbulent production, its difficult journey into a form Warner Brothers - who thought this was going to be like A Hard Day's Night - found acceptable, and the short but eventful life of the mysterious Donald Cammell. If you want to hear us talk more about his co-director, Rob and Graham have also covered The Man Who Fell to Earth. If you want us to talk more about Mick Jagger, well...\n\n...there's an exclusive bonus episode of this podcast concerning Tony Richardson's Ned Kelly coming out on our Patreon very soon, where it'll join a galaxy of quality content: the franchise-reassessing podcast From the Video Aisle is about to dive into the Mr. Vampire series, our X-Files and Red Dwarf reviews are well into the golden age of those shows, and there's also the movie miscellany podcast Last Night... at the end of the month. This isn't even close to the limit of what we do: check Twitter, Instagram and Facebook to find out more.\n\nLast week, our sister podcast Uncut took you through January through to June in our two-part review of 2023. Now, Pop Screen takes up the reigns with Vincent, Naomi, Rob, Graham, Kat, Simon, Mike, Oliver and James all returning to give their favourite films of the second half of the year - culminating in that all-important top ten. What will make the cut? Who did Barbenheimer on the day of release? How many diverging opinions on Saltburn can we get? And who put the Puss in Boots sequel above the new Scorsese? But it's not all about the year's big talking points and blockbusters. We also shine the spotlight on smaller films you might have missed, including The Passenger, Raging Grace, Femme, Trenque Lauquen, Smoking Causes Coughing, Eileen, How to Have Sex, Afire and many more. We'll be back in a fortnight's time with a regular Pop Screen episode on Mick Jagger's first acting role in Performance, but until then... ...if you want more, you can always donate to our Patreon where you'll get monthly bonus episodes of this show, exclusive podcasts about cult franchises and the wider world of movies and TV, written articles about classic Asian genre cinema, plus cult TV reviews covering The X-Files, Red Dwarf and Doctor Who. Follow us on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to stay in touch.\n\nPop Screen finishes 2023 with a movie that could not be less stock to our ears - Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky's Metallica: Some Kind of Monster. Granted unprecedented levels of access to the world's biggest heavy metal band, the directors of the Paradise Lost trilogy made a raw documentary about a band somehow staying together and making an album despite unprecedented personal turmoil. The punchline: the album they make is St. Anger, perhaps the most reviled album in their back catalogue (or at least the most reviled one that doesn't feature Lou Reed).\n\nJoin Aidan and Graham for this exploration of the lifestyle and indeed deathstyle of the metal legends, including diversions to talk about Lars Ulrich's feud with Napster, which type of dad James Hetfield is and the vexed question of whether Metallica are actually good. We also discuss the band's history and former members, their decision to hire a group therapist to get them back together and, of course, that infernal snare drum sound.\n\nIf you want to keep us tapping on a tin can despite public opposition, you can donate to our Patreon where you'll get a monthly bonus episode of this show, written reviews of classic SF television and Asian genre cinema, and two whole bonus podcasts that aren't available anywhere else. Follow us on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to find out more.\n\nAll we want for Christmas is this: Mariah Carey's notorious film vehicle is the subject of Pop Screen's festive episode. Equally reviled and unfortunate, it's the tale of a foster child who grows up into an aspiring singer, and whose rise to fame is, shall we say, subtly patterned on Carey's own career. Its soundtrack album was released on 9/11, which stymied its commercial potential. That inspired a #JusticeforGlitter campaign many years later; the film was less fortunate.\n\nOn this year's Pop Screen Christmas special, David rejoins Graham to talk about the many unlikely couples in this film, the almost surreally undercharacterised friends of Carey's Billie, and how Carey's divorce from Tommy Mottola may have forced this film into its 1980s setting. We also discuss Carey's triple-threat legacy: her world-class voice, her current status as Queen of Christmas, and the \"I don't know her\" gif.\n\nIf you want to help us transcend being backing singers for... Top Chef's Padma Lakshmi? Apparently, you can donate to our Patreon where you'll find a monthly bonus episode of this show, as well as our Patreon exclusive podcasts Last Night... and From the Video Aisle, the last of which is midway through a reassessment of the V/H/S franchise. Plus written reviews of classic Asian genre cinema, Doctor Who, Red Dwarf and The X-Files. Follow us on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram for more.\n\nGet ready for (a) love (-in): Graham is joined once again by the Uncut Network's Rob for a look at Iain Forsythe and Jane Pollard's massively acclaimed sort-of documentary about Nick Cave. As well as providing an intimate look at the Australian legend's creative process and history, it also features appearances from his deeply unexpected celebrity friends: Ray Winstone and Kylie Minogue, together at last!\n\nAlong the way, there's time to consider the idiosyncratic concert demands of Nina Simone, while a look back at Forsythe and Pollard's career lets us talk about The Cramps and reveal the name of God. But mostly, this is a celebration of Cave - and there's more to come, with Andrew Dominik's duology of One More Time With Feeling and This Much I Know To Be True out tomorrow on our Patreon...\n\nIf you want to put stacks of green paper in our red right hands, you can donate to our Patreon, where you'll get the aforementioned Pop Screen bonus episodes plus reviews of Eastern genre cinema in Fantastic Asia, our monthly movie round-up Last Night..., cult franchises discussed in From the Video Aisle and weekly reviews of Doctor Who, Red Dwarf and The X-Files. Follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to find out more.\n\nOn this week's Pop Screen, Graham has a very important and special guest: Mark's dog! And, fine, yes, also Mark, with our favourite quizmaster and Film Stories writer coming back to talk about Russell T Davies's most personal drama. Set across the early years of the AIDS crisis, It's a Sin has a cast full of breakthrough young stars, memorable cameos from acting veterans, plus Olly Alexander, whose day job in Years and Years allows us to cover the show.\n\nNot that we need much of an excuse to talk about it, or indeed Davies's day job showrunning Doctor Who for its imminent 60th anniversary specials. There's also space for digressions on Prime Ministerial cameos, the real-life inspirations behind the central characters, an appreciation of Erasure and why Russell T Davies must be hopping mad at Stranger Things right now. The T stands for \"Thatcherism has left a legacy of death and division\", by the way.\n\nIf you want to fund our dreams of leaving the Isle of Man and becoming an actor, you can donate to our Patreon where you'll get a monthly bonus episode of this show - currently it's one about Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, as if you needed further incentive - plus our other podcasts Last Night... and From the Video Aisle. You'll also get weekly written reviews of Doctor Who, Red Dwarf and The X-Files, classic Asian genre cinema under the microscope in Fantastic Asia, and more. Follow us on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook for more information.\n\nOur Halloween special is over and done with, but this week Graham faces his most terrifying challenge yet - enjoying a film about jazz. If you're going to watch one film about jazz, though, Bertrand Tavernier's 'Round Midnight is the one to watch. Its bona fides are impeccable: named after a Thelonious Monk song, starring Dexter Gordon, with a score by Herbie Hancock and inspired by the lives of Lester Young and Bud Powell.\n\nThat's a lot of jazz, and fortunately Aidan is back on the show to help Graham navigate it. But there's more to Tavernier's film than its music. It's a profoundly cinephilic film as well, with a memorable late appearance by notable Letterboxd user Martin Scorsese. Graham also gets to venture his classification system for 1980s French cinema, which won't be approved by Cahiers du Cinema any time soon but eh, it just about works. If you want to help us manage our tormented yet strangely stylish alcohol addictions, you can donate to our Patreon where we're about to drop an exclusive episode of this very podcast about Taylor Swift's Eras tour movie. We've got a lot of content that isn't available anywhere else, including reviews of underrated Asian genre films in Fantastic Asia, From the Video Aisle's new series on the V/H/S franchise, our end-of-month miscellany podcast Last Night... and weekly reviews of Red Dwarf, Doctor Who and The X-Files. Follow us on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook for more.\n\nwww.patreon.com/thegeekshow\n\nOh god, Graham's shining the spooky light under his face again - sounds like time for a Halloween special. And it is, with Mark Cunliffe of We Are Cult joining the show once again to talk about The Haunted House of Horror, a 1960s British horror movie with an all-bases-covered title. It's the familiar tale of a group of horny and stupid teens who go to an old house for a seance and end up beset by entities even older and more sinister than Frankie Avalon, the Beach Blanket Bingo star who plays a character described as the essence of Swinging London.\n\nSo, not entirely persuasive casting in the lead role, but there's an impressive supporting cast including Jill Haworth and Get Carter's George Sewell, who does not play one of the teens, as he was never young. Aside from exploring the varied CVs of cast and crew, Graham and Mark also appreciate the movie's surprisingly nasty kills, the reshoots that led to the ending making no sense at all, and the time when Mark accidentally went to a Chesney Hawkes concert.\n\nIf you want to keep us buying clothes at the Men's Shop, you can donate to our Patreon where Mark and Graham are about to reteam and tackle Taylor Swift's Eras concert film in a Pop Screen exclusive. You'll also find regular written reviews of classic British sci-fi television and our favourite Asian genre movies, the monthly movie miscellany podcast Last Night..., and cult franchises reviewed in From the Video Aisle. Follow us on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook for more news.\n\nwww.patreon.com/thegeekshow\n\nDon't call it a comeback! Literally, given the number of alternative titles Pete Walker's 1978 chiller goes under. Best-known as The Comeback, stars crooner Jack Jones as crooner Nick Cooper - a stretch, then - who is all fresh from a stay in rehab and ready to record his comeback album. The process is interrupted by artistic conflicts, record industry politics, scary ghosts and a hag-masked killer armed with a sickle. Not necessarily in that order.\n\nThe first in Pop Screen's 2023 Halloween month sees Robyn Adams rejoin the show to talk about the genius of Sheila Keith, Walker's gift for an outrageous title - including some contradictory advice given to his female protagonists - and the sheer weight of classic comedy connections in this ostensibly straight-faced horror film. If you've ever wanted a slasher featuring the stars of This Is Spinal Tap, Not the Nine O'Clock News and Last of the Summer Wine, this is for you, you absolute weirdo.\n\nIf you'd like to help us detox from heroin and restart our tarnished careers, you can donate to our Patreon, where you'll get a monthly bonus episode of this show. The next one, about aliyah's posthumous role in Queen of the Damned, is out tomorrow. Plus a new series of reviews of Asian genre classics in Fantastic Asia, cult franchises go under the lens in From the Video Aisle, weekly reviews of Doctor Who, Red Dwarf and The X-Files, and much more. Follow us on Facebook, Instagram and that which once was Twitter for more.\n\nWhen we announced a month of Madonna-themed movies, we could have just looked at her acting performances, maybe a documentary or two. Instead, we felt like it was our journalistic duty to blow the lid off her steamy affair with 'Weird' Al Yankovic. That's just one of the extremely accurate facts contained in Weird: The Al Yankovic Story, a merciless lampoon of biopic cliches which Weird Al superfan Jeff is back on the podcast to discuss with Graham.\n\nThe film immediately received attention for Daniel Radcliffe's insanely committed lead performance, but there's more - and not just Evan Rachel Wood's superb turn as Madonna, either. Jeff and Graham discuss which of the film's cavalcade of cameos they'd like to see a full biopic about, the film's long gestation period and how the rock biopic changed (or didn't) during production, and the critical importance of preserving the Quibi archive for future generations.\n\nIf you'd like to help us dare to be stupid, you can donate to our Patreon, where you'll get a monthly bonus episode of this show, as well as our movie and TV round-up podcast Last Night..., cult franchises reviewed in From the Video Aisle, weekly written reviews of Doctor Who, Red Dwarf and The X-Files, plus Unseen Asia and more.\n\nFollow our Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for more.\n\nThis week, Pop Screen is showing you Dick. As part of our ce-e-le-bration of the fortieth anniversary of Madonna's breakthrough single Holiday, we're taking you back to 1990, when Warren Beatty became one of the few men to ever tell her what to do as he directed his then-partner in the comic book hit of the summer, Dick Tracy.\n\nObviously, the landscape of comic book adaptations has changed since the days when a 1930s detective strip was a box office smash and Captain America was the subject of a cheap B-movie. But has it changed for the better? This question can only be answered by bringing back Andrew of Behold! podcast, who revisits his childhood favourite film to ask: does it hold up, and why isn't it set on the moon? Plus vital detours to discuss the film's excellent make-up, Al Pacino's, uh, high-intensity villain performance, the documentary Six by Sondheim and the insane excess of a film that can afford to get Kathy Bates for, essentially, one great sight gag.\n\nIf you'd like to help us hold on to the rights for a 1930s comic strip using a series of Zoom calls - seriously, it's a thing we discuss - you can back us on Patreon, where you'll get an exclusive episode on Dangerous Game, another of the many curios in Madonna's screen career. Plus written reviews of Red Dwarf, The X-Files and classic series Doctor Who, From the Video Aisle works its way through the [Rec] series, the film and TV miscellany podcast Last Night... and more. Follow us on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram for more.\n\nSome people think little girls should be seen and not heard, but Pop Screen says: welcome to our episode on Poly Styrene: I am a Cliche! Co-directed by Celeste Bell in collaboration with Paul Sng, it follows Bell's journey to explore her late mother's iconic time with the punk band X-Ray Spex, as well as her troubled life and - more important than it sounds, this - her one-of-a-kind fashion sense.\n\nThe documentary is based closely on the book Day-Glo, by Bell and Zoe Howe, and on this episode We Are Cult's Mark Cunliffe joins Graham to discuss what was left out from that text, as well as appreciate Poly Styrene's classic work with X-Ray Spex, her distance from the mainstream British punk scene, the afterlife of her band and her still-underrated solo career. We also pitch an ITV1 detective series starring Kate Bush, although we're still unsure why.\n\nThe free episodes are only part of our identity: subscribe to our Patreon and you'll also get a bonus episode on Barbie, as well as access to our other podcasts From the Video Aisle - about cult franchises past and present - and Last Night..., which is literally about what we watched last night. Both of those are only available on Patreon subscribers, as are our written reviews of classic TV science fiction serials Red Dwarf, The X-Files and Doctor Who. Follow us on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook for more.\n\nwww.patreon.com/thegeekshow\n\nwww.wearecult.rocks\n\nThis week, Mark Harrison from Film Stories rejoins Pop Screen to taunt Graham about one of his most extravagantly failed predictions. Remember our The Dead Don't Die episode? Where we looked at that film's star Austin Butler's upcoming movies and decided there was no way an Elvis biopic was going to make bank in 2022? WELL... Actually, the strangest thing is not that it made money, but that we enjoyed it. Join Mark and Graham as they discuss their mixed feelings towards Baz Luhrmann, the \"crisis in media literacy\" and the many ways in which Colonel Tom Parker could have been a better mother to Elvis. There's also room to talk about Parker's role in the birth of PR, the changing image of Elvis following his death in 1977, and why this was the best superhero movie of 2022. Thank you - thank you very much! There's much more than a one for the money over on our Patreon - as well as Mark and Graham reuniting for a Patreon exclusive Pop Screen episode on Greta Gerwig's Barbie, there's reviews of Red Dwarf, The X-Files and Doctor Who, a look at Asian films that need a UK distributor, and two exclusive podcasts. From the Video Aisle is about to begin a retrospective on the found-footage horror franchise [Rec], and Last Night... is just covering anything it wants to, as usual. Follow us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Threads for more.\n\nIt's our 100th episode! And what better way to celebrate than to look back at one of the great musical flops of all time, 1980's Xanadu. Starring Olivia Newton-John, Gene Kelly and a guy from The Warriors, it's the story of a Greek Muse sent to Earth on a mission to inspire. If she knew she was going to inspire him to make a swing dancing/roller disco fusion club, she'd have stayed on Mount Olympus.\n\nOne of the films that led to the foundation of the Golden Raspberry awards, Xanadu nevertheless has a devoted cult following, two members of which - previous co-hosts David and Jeff - are here to guide Xana-newbie Graham through this bewildering film. Is it bad? Good? So bad it's good? Only the 100th edition of Pop Screen can solve the mystery!\n\nMaking content is not quite as lucrative as this film suggests, so if you want us to keep creating you can donate to our Patreon, where you'll get a monthly bonus episode of this show, our film and TV miscellany Last Night..., From the Video Aisle's retrospectives on cult franchises (currently going through the Cube sequels), Unseen Asia, reviews of Red Dwarf, The X-Files, and Doctor Who... it's a lot, and you can keep up with what's going on by following us on Instagram, Twitter or Facebook. it is still Twitter too, nobody's ever going to call it X. Give it up, plastic-face.\n\nAfter last week's voyage into self-importance courtesy of U2, Pop Screen tackles a film that couldn't possibly be more lightweight - the 1965 teen comedy Beach Ball. Strange, as it features one of the most tortured souls in '60s pop - Scott Walker - and one of its defining divas, Diana Ross. But this is an entry in the brief but prolific fad for beach party movies, in which mysteriously parent-free teenagers meet on the shore to date and do nothing that threatens a U certificate while listening to the drumming stylings of... exploitation film stalwart Sid Haig?!\n\nYes, there's some stuff that needs unpacking in here alright, and Mick from our sister podcast Behold! is on hand to help Graham unpack it. Join them as they run through the now-forgotten history of the beach party movie, discuss which of this year's summer blockbusters is most inspired by it (a clue: it's not Oppenheimer) and work out how this stacks up against the genre's avant-garde masterpiece Gonks Go Beats. It's like an endless summer, except this podcast does actually end, so it isn't.\n\nIf you'd like to help us buy our own musical instruments without having to beg the crusty old dean for money, you can donate to our Patreon where you get three exclusive monthly podcasts - a bonus episode of Pop Screen, our latest show From the Video Aisle, and the movie and TV miscellany Last Night..., plus written reviews of Asian films that need UK distribution, classic series Doctor Who and Graham's new series going through The X-Files's conspiracy episodes. Follow us on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook for more news.\n\nIt's a story we keep running into here on Pop Screen: a band are so big, so acclaimed, that they think \"We could make a film, how could that go wrong?\" and the universe then demonstrates exactly how that could go wrong. Coming just one year after their worldwide smash The Joshua Tree,\n\nU2 decided to make Rattle & Hum, a documentary about their American tour. It earned them their first negative reviews, and caused people to reflect - for the first time, if you can believe it - that Bono was quite annoying sometimes.\n\nAnd yet... you might like it all the same. Joining Graham this week, Joe from Dreaming Machine talks about his complex relationship with U2 after a mammoth revisiting of all their albums. They discuss the failures and the less-heralded triumphs of Rattle & Hum, also finding space to wonder about the Manic Street Preachers' album reissues and tell a delightful anecdote about Joe's old alarm clock. You've given us love, now give us money money money over at Patreon, where you'll find all sorts of content not available anywhere else: a bonus monthly episode of this podcast, for one, reviews of Asian films that need UK distribution in Unseen Asia, our latest podcast From the Video Aisle, which kicks off with an episode about the Canadian SF/horror classic Cube, X-Files reviews and our monthly movie and TV round-up Last Night...\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook for more.\n\nVampires! Undead creatures of the night who people also find really hot! If you think fancying a walking corpse is #problematic, wait until you see the actions of Vampire, the imaginatively-named vampire played by Martin Kemp in 1995's Embrace of the Vampire. In Anne Goursaud's film, he's looking to get his fangs on an underage girl before she's legal, just like [NAME REDACTED ON LEGAL ADVICE]\n\nThere are more tangents than usual on this episode, possibly so Graham and guest host Robyn Adams don't have to spend any more time talking about this deeply gross central plot. Aside from the cult-icon-heavy cast including Jennifer Tilly, Rachel True and Alyssa Milano, there's also room for conversations on Ace of Base, Charles Band's financial woes and the sex lives of the Blind Dead. You are not ready for this episode.\n\nIf you don't want us to end up living in a derelict church, you can donate to our Patreon where you get an exclusive episode of this show every month, as well as Graham's new X-Files review series, Rob's championing of Asian films that lack a British distributor in Unseen Asia, the everything-and-the-kitchen-sink podcast Last Night... and more upcoming.

A biopic of Motley Crue, it offers a visceral look at sex, drugs and rock and roll, but maybe not enough into why hair metal (the stuff Americans heretically call \"glam rock\") remains so divisive.\n\nTo address this and so many other questions, Graham is joined by Kat from The Hollywood News to talk about their mutual soft spot for the much-maligned rock biopic genre, our feelings on the Crue and the grunge scene that essentially ended their career, and how well the film handles its many darker strands. We are gentler on Machine Gun Kelly than you might think, though there's a good Eminem diss if that's your thing.\n\nIf you want to give us a slice of your pie, you can donate to our Patreon where all sorts of things are going on - Graham is winding down his Doctor Who reviews and starting on The X-Files, Rob is championing Asian films that don't have UK distribution, our TV and film miscellany podcast Last Night... goes from strength to strength... oh yeah, and there's an exclusive episode of this show coming out tomorrow, about Rudy Wurlitzer and Robert Frank's rock road trip movie Candy Mountain. Follow us on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook for more.\n\nHow do you weather the changes in a genre your band helped define? It's tricky. Run-DMC tried to rebrand with Tougher Than Leather, the title of both an album and a film directed by their producer Rick Rubin. A tough yet strangely naive premonition of the gangsta rap years to come, it also features one of Rubin's other proteges, The Beastie Boys, just as their career took off.\n\nIt's got serious time capsule value, then, so it's no wonder it prompts hosts Graham and Jeff to reflect on the odd experience of being a white hip-hop fan in the late 1980s and 90s, a time when the genre was subject to both fetishisation and moral panic from our fellow honkies. We also discuss the unexpected links this film has to movies by James Grey and Jonathan Demme, formative 'adult' cinema and the parallel universe where this film was directed by Spike Lee. Turns out we can, in fact, rock it like this.\n\nSend your checks, thugs and, indeed, rock and roll over to our Patreon, where we have a massive bounty for subscribers including a monthly bonus episode of this podcast, reviews of Asian films that lack UK distribution, twice-weekly reviews of classic series Doctor Who, and our TV and film podcast Last Night... where Geek Show hosts get together to chew the fat about what they've been watching. Follow us on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook for more info!\n\nIf there's one thing pop music needs almost as much as it needs musicians, it's people who won't hear the words \"Actually, that's a really bad idea\". Terri Hooley was one such man. Record shop owner, record label owner and focal point for Belfast's punk scene, what he lacked in business sense he made up for in passion. Glenn Leyburn and Lisa Barros d'Sa's biopic Good Vibrations tells his unbelievable story.\n\nWe've got an expanded cast on the show to celebrate the film, too, with Graham joined by Directors Uncut's Rob and another regular co-host, Mark from We Are Cult. As well as the film, they also describe the odd experience of actors you love starring on shows you don't care about, discuss the films that did - and didn't - get punk right, and invent at least one new musical genre. There are some bad impersonations again, but it's definitely within the spirit of the film this time.\n\nIf you'd like to give us five hundred pounds and a photo of The Shangri-Las, why not start small by donating to our Patreon? There are three tiers, and the highest is just £3 - giving you access to Rob's reviews of Asian films that lack a UK distributor, Graham's classic series Doctor Who reviews, our joyous grab-bag of a podcast Last Night..., and a monthly bonus episode of this show. Stay tuned to the end of this podcast to find out what that is this month, and follow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.\n\nRidicule is nothing to be scared of, which is probably for the best, as Adam Ant earned a fair bit of it for his role in this post-apocalyptic action movie. The product of veteran journeyman director Lee H Katzin, it also stars Bruce Dern in a role he literally does not remember filming as the last hippie, fighting against the diminutive Man and his army of bad choirboys. No, really.\n\nThis week we're joined by the Cymreig Samurai himself, Ben Jones, as we discuss how Adam Ant's cult nearly had a very different book as their inspiration, and get the idea for a guaranteed smash-hit range of action figures. Ben also astonishes Graham with a pop movie even he hasn't heard of, and we discuss the intimate secrets of Pinocchio's anatomy. The film sends you down some strange paths, OK?\n\nIf you want to help us survive the coming apocalypse, you can donate to our Patreon where you get all kinds of goodies - a whole other movies and TV podcast, Last Night..., plus Graham's twice-weekly Doctor Who reviews, access to the Geek Show archives, Rob's reviews of Asian films that cry out for UK home releases, and a monthly bonus episode of this very podcast that isn't available anywhere else. Follow us on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram for more news.\n\nSee it! Feel it! It's finally time for Pop Screen to scale the all-time summit of the rock opera form - Ken Russell's Tommy, based on the album by The Who. Pete Townsend's achingly personal tale of a traumatised kid mistakenly hailed as a messiah, it's got a soundtrack of some of The Who's most indelible tracks and a visual style that is one hundred per cent pure, uncut Uncle Ken.\n\nThis week, Graham is joined by Mick from Behold! podcast to discuss this absolutely singular work, with its eclectic cast that includes everyone from the star of Just Good Friends to the star of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. We also discuss the real-life Acid Queen Russell would meet some years later, the possibility of a spin-off about Oliver Reed's Butlins years, and whether Rupert the Bear is friends with a wood sprite. One of those weeks, clearly.\n\nIf you want to help us afford five-foot high platform boots like Elton John's, you can donate to our Patreon. We're about to release an exclusive episode looking at Roger Daltrey's later performance in Dot Com for Murder, and we also publish regular reviews of overlooked Asian films, weekly retrospectives of classic Doctor Who and a whole other podcast, Last Night..., where hosts from across the Geek Show network tell us what they've been watching. Follow us on Twitter, Instagram and Patreon for more!\n\nThis episode of Pop Screen is about the rivalry between '90s psych-rock revivalists The Dandy Warhols and The Brian Jonestown Massacre - and if you think that's a niche subject for a film, that's how Ondi Timoner's DiG! came across before its premiere in 2004. Yet it was immediately and rightly hailed as a classic film about rock music, the nature of genius and selling out, becoming a cult classic for audiences far outside the two bands' pre-existing fandom.\n\nThis week, Ewan from(Don't) Listen to This returns - you have to remind him about his own podcast, he does forget things - to discuss Timoner's fascinating career, how the film's take on the record industry holds up in a very different landscape nearly twenty years later, and whether it's so bad to sell out anyway. We also talk about the differences between American and British memories of the 1990s, and indulge in a treasonous fantasy about the upcoming coronation. It's all here!\n\nIf you want to help finance repairs to our sitar collection, we've got a Patreon where you can get a monthly bonus episode of this show - listen to the end to find out what the next one will be - plus exclusive content like Rob's reviews of Asian films that want for a UK distributor, our everything-and-the-kitchen-sink podcast Last Night..., and Graham's weekly Doctor Who reviews. Follow us on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to find out more.\n\nSome pop stars like to take the easy route into acting by starring opposite lightweight co-stars. And then there's Johnny Cash, whose acting debut in 1971's A Gunfight sees him playing alongside no less than Kirk Douglas, with Karen Black, Jane Alexander and a young Keith Carradine in support. It wasn't a big hit - largely because calling a Western A Gunfight is like calling an action movie A Car Chase - but it's well worth a look for fans of the Man in Black. And you have seen one bit of it, even if you don't realise it...\n\nThe man Aidan comes around to our podcast again to talk about the film's left-field ending, the state of the Western as Hollywood entered the '70s, and other Cash-centric films and TV shows, from Walk the Line to that episode of The Simpsons where Homer eats a hallucinogenic chilli. In your face, space coyote!\n\nIf you don't want to see us forced into a duel to the death to earn money, you can donate to our Patreon. We're just about to release our new Patreon exclusive episode of Pop Screen, about the tATu movie You & I, plus we've got regular pieces about Asian movies that have been overlooked by Western distributors and weekly Doctor Who reviews. Follow our Twitter, Instagram and Patreon to find out more!\n\nThe shocking death of Terry Hall at the end of 2022 sent Pop Screen back to this document of him in his prime: Dance Craze, a relentlessly energetic concert film showcasing all the greats from the first wave of British ska. As well as Hall with The Specials, there are classic performances from Madness, The Beat, The Selecter, The Bodysnatchers and Bad Manners: an unmissable line-up by anyone's standards.\n\nNeglected for decades, Dance Craze is about to get a spiffy BFI Blu-Ray release, but before that Mick and Graham are here to discuss the legacy of Hall and The Specials, as well as this era of ska in general. We also find time to explain why 2-Tone Records was the exact opposite of Apple, imagine a parallel universe version of this film where Rhoda Dakar makes a big alteration to the set list, and explain why The Beat are kind of like a Portuguese Man o' War. Enjoy yourself, it really is later than you think.\n\nWe don't have to work, 'cause there's no, no work to do, but we do provide an awful lot of content on our Patreon including a monthly bonus episode of this podcast. The next one, about the lost tATu film You and I, is out in a fortnight - but before that, there'll be a new episode of our movie miscellany podcast Last Night..., more reviews of classic Asian cinema in Unseen Asia and Graham's randomly selected Doctor Who reviews. It's not available anywhere else, and you can find out more by following our Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.\n\nCan you believe Telly Savalas, Claudia Cardinale, David Niven, Richard Roundtree, Sonny Bono and Mr. Bronson from Grange Hill were in the same movie once? We can't - and this is before you get to lovely old Roger Moore playing a Wehrmacht captain! It can only be Escape to Athena, one of a series of star-studded flops produced by British TV mogul Lew Grade - and this one has an ace up its sleeve in the form of future Rambo: First Blood Part II director George P Cosmatos.\n\nIt's the kind of film about a Nazi prisoner-of-war camp that always gets shown at Christmas, which is an odd state of affairs when you stop to think about it. On this episode of Pop Screen, Graham is joined once again by We Are Cult's Mark Cunliffe to discuss the evolution of the World War II movie, as well as Grade's chequered career. There's also room to debate the best screen incarnation of Philip Marlowe, reveal how Sonny Bono shaped modern Hollywood and decide which Muppet clearly inspired Elliot Gould's performance in this film.\n\nIf you don't want us to be reduced to doing striptease shows for German generals, you can donate to our Patreon, where you'll get more than ever for your money. The next Pop Screen Patreon exclusive, about the 2002 Britney Spears vehicle Crossroads, goes live a day after this show, while Unseen Asia is currently posing the question: why is John Woo's Hard Boiled not available in the UK? Plus Last Night..., Random Access Who, and more. Follow us on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook for more information.\n\nWilko Johnson, the Dr Feelgood guitarist with the eyes of a killer and the legs of a Riverdancer, died last November, which sent Aidan and Graham back to his previous obituary. Made as the pub rock pioneer fought an apparently terminal cancer, The Ecstasy of Wilko Johnson is less a rock documentary and more a fable about life, death and the creative spirit - a typically modest affair, then, from Julien Temple.\n\nTemple, perhaps the ultimate Pop Screen director, is not new to these shores, but our hosts quickly discover this might be the Julien Tempest film ever made. Along the way, we unpick the film's myriad allusions to cinema, poetry and astronomy, as well as discussing Temple's previous attempt at chronicling Dr Feelgood in Oil City Confidential. It's a magical film that definitely isn't just for Wilko fans.\n\nLook, the film's about cancer so I'm not going to make a joke here, I'll cut to the chase - you get so much more on the Geek Show Patreon, from our brand new movie miscellany podcast Last Night..., to two classic Doctor Who reviews a week from Graham. There's also Unseen Asia, in which Rob champions Asian films that lack a UK distributor, and a monthly bonus episode of this very show - the last one, a spoiler special on Glass Onion, may be our best yet. Follow us on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook for more.\n\nHey you! Pop Screen welcomes in 2023 with a dose of los paranoias as Graham and Rob tackle Paul Thomas Anderson's Inherent Vice. The only adaptation - and likely to remain that way - of a Thomas Pynchon novel, it has an all-star cast headed up by Joaquin Phoenix's stoner PI Doc Sportello, and features suitably ethereal narration from the world's coolest harpist - again, not much competition - Joanna Newsom.\n\nOn this week's Pop Screen, we tune in our doper's ESP to the karmic thermals - or something - of Anderson's unjustly maligned film. We comb the film for Thomas Pynchon's cameo, discuss its critical take on '60s nostalgia, and still find space to be rude about Hans Zimmer. The Vicenaissance starts here!\n\nIf you want to help us establish a free housing complex in the desert or whatever it is, you can donate to our Patreon. We're just about to release a spoiler-packed chat about Glass Onion, and we've just launched a new movie miscellany podcast Last Night... Plus, Graham's Doctor Who reviews, Rob's championing of Asian films that lack a UK distributor, and more. Follow us on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook for more info!\n\nThis week on Pop Screen there's a new Sherrif in town. Well, just for this one single episode, anyway. This is Rob of Directors Uncut typing right now.\n\nYou can find Directors Uncut here\n\nPop Screen has crossed over with our sister podcast, Directors Uncut, for an epic review of 2022. You can already find part a bonus to these bonus episodes for free on our PATREON. The snake truly is eating itself with that one. This is part two of said coverage, which looks at the 10-6 from this lovely bunch of people - besides Graham and Rob, there is Naomi, Kat, James, Vincent, Oliver, Cliff and Andy. And you better believe there are a lot of films from all over the movie map up for discussion, maybe too many? No, that'd be a ridiculous thing to say in a show description. So I better not be caught saying that.\n\nPart two of this coverage and the finale of our 2022 in-review coverage can be found on the Directors Uncut feed tomorrow. Normal service resumes on this next episode of Pop Screen.\n\nYou can donate to our Patreon, where you'll get a monthly bonus episode of this podcast. The next one is a spoiler-packed, Janelle Monae-worshipping chat about Glass Onion. Patreons also get Rob's articles on overlooked Asian films, Graham's Doctor Who reviews, and a brand new podcast called Last Night... plus more. Follow us on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook for more information.\n\nThe year is nearly done, but Pop Screen lingers on with an episode about Todd Haynes's documentary The Velvet Underground. Covering the turbulent career of one of the most confrontational yet influential bands of the 1960s, it's a film that's got everything from deep discussions of minimalist composition to amusing anecdotes about how their black-clad smack-addled racket played with California's hippie scene. (Spoiler alert: badly!)\n\nThis week, Graham is joined by Left Lion's Oliver Parker to discuss Haynes's unusual swerve into documentary, the legacy of Lou Reed, the, uh, distinctive singing voices of Reed and Nico, and the film's portrayal of New York and Andy Warhol's Factory. They also agonise about what the best Velvet Underground album is - don't lie, you've struggled with the answer yourself - and get a sly diss at Drake in somehow. We're still not sure how that got in there, but it was worth it.\n\nIf you want to give us The Gift - eh? eh? - of support, you can donate to our Patreon, where you'll get a monthly bonus episode of this podcast. The next one is out in a fortnight, and it's a spoiler-packed, Janelle Monae-worshipping chat about Glass Onion. Patreons also get Rob's articles on overlooked Asian films, Graham's Doctor Who reviews, and more. Follow us on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook for more information.\n\n[drum hit] AND IIIII-EEE-AAAYYY... Yes, some songs are born Christmassy, some achieve Christmasiness, and some have Christmas thrust upon them, as is the case with Whitney Houston's cover of Dolly Parton's I Will Always Love You. Arguably the best-remembered Christmas number one of the nineties, it prompted us to make a festive episode about The Bodyguard, the Lawrence Kasdan film whose soundtrack it graces.\n\nHere's something they don't tell you: The Bodyguard is a really tonally weird film. Graham is joined this week by Film Stories' Mark Harrison to unpick its oddities, including its accelerated opening, its nods to Akira Kurosawa and Fritz Lang, and its possibly intentional in-jokes about Kevin Costner's screen persona. We also speculate on what the long-mooted remake might look like, delve into the many stars who nearly played Houston and Costner's roles, and make an unbelievable discovery about the film's cancelled sequel.\n\nIf you want to wish us joy and happiness through the medium of money, you can donate to our Patreon, where you'll also get Rob's write-ups of Asian films overlooked by British distributors, Graham's Doctor Who reviews, and a bonus episode of this show. The most recent one deals with North-Eastern icon Alan Hull's haunting 1974 TV play Squire. As ever, you'll find out what we've got coming up by following us on Instagram, Twitter or Facebook.\n\n#popscreen #moviereviews #thebodyguard #kevincostner #whitneyhouston #lawrencekasdan #garykemp #christmasnumberone #dollyparton\n\nPop Screen has confronted some horrors in its recent Halloween month, but nothing like what Graham and Mark come up against this week: Noel Edmonds. The DJ-turned-mystical guru pops up in Glitter, one of two episodes of the 1970s anthology series Second City Firsts that feature pop stars, and it's enough to send Graham into a journey into the heart of Blobbyland. But there's also the film's main star to reckon with - Toyah Wilcox, captured here just before her punk makeover, committing the ultimate sin of singing with a band called Bilbo Baggins.\n\nSecond City Firsts also dipped its toe into the pop pond with Squire, an excellent, magic-realist tale of a working-class dreamer played by Lindisfarne's Alan Hull. Which of our two hosts - the North-Easterner Graham, the North-Westerner Mark - is a Lindisfarne fan? The answer may surprise you! We also discuss the many, depressingly business-related reasons why the single television play fell from fashion, the recent British film that reminded us of Squire, the mystery of the leaping dog, and why Graham is a capitalist [EXPLETIVE DELETED].\n\nIf you want to keep us in the capitalist pig lifestyle we're accustomed to, you can donate to our Patreon, where you'll get Rob's reviews of unjustly overlooked Asian films, Graham's classic series Doctor Who reviews, and a monthly bonus episode of this very show - listen to the end of this episode to find out what the next one is, or follow us on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram for more news.\n\n#popscreen #moviereviews #secondcityfirsts #toyahwilcox #alanhull #lindisfarne #phildaniels #noeledmonds #topofthepops #bbc #newcastle\n\nThis week, Pop Screen is taking you to Spatula City with this episode about America's pre-eminent polka-crazed pop parodist \"Weird Al\" Yankovic and his 1989 film UHF. Prior to this month's parody biopic Weird - in which he's played by Daniel Radcliffe, in Radcliffe's second era-defining role after Swiss Army Man - this was Al's only major motion picture. But that still leaves decades of recordings to discuss, and that's why Al superfan Jeff Pizek is back on the podcast to help bewildered Briton Graham get to the meaning of Al.\n\nAlong the way, we discuss the film's inspired casting - including a chance to appreciate the comedic skills of a couple of people who, let's say, don't get the roles they used to? For very specific reasons? - its connection to The Simpsons, its vision of small-town America, and indeed the vexed question of where UHF is actually set. Is it a small town at all? We also pose a question about Dire Straits's Money for Nothing video which we forget to answer on the podcast, so let's do it here: Steve Barron. You're welcome.\n\nIf you want to keep us making podcasts with this kind of polish and professionalism, I guess, you can donate to our Patreon where you get an exclusive episode every month. The next one comes out in early December, and it's a two-parter... You'll also get Rob's reviews of great Asian movies that have been overlooked by UK distributors, and Graham's twice-weekly Doctor Who reviews. Follow us on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook for more information."
