And you can’t control it. Looking back, you can’t say, ‘I should’ve… ‘ You didn’t, and had you, the outcome would have been different.”\n\n“I’m just trying to make my favorite music. That’s how I work; I just do things based on the way they feel to me. I want to be touched by the music I’m making. Luckily, other people have shared that response to my work over the years.”\n\n“Usually when I start a new project there’s a fear of the unknown; maybe it’s a band I’ve never been in the studio with before. People are so different. It’s almost like you need to go through the process, discover and unlock what it is that makes that band that band. And a lot of times they don’t know it.”\n\nSource: Brainy Quote\n\nKey Takeaways from Rick Rubin Career\n\nBe versatile\n\nRick shows us that he is the “man”, when it comes to working with rock bands but he is also so versatile that he worked with Shakira in two albums. This teaches us that we need to be versatile and also have the capacity to adapt to new situations to get ahead in this world.\n\nInvest in your craft\n\nRick knew from the beginning that he wanted to do music as his life job, and he succeeded in this.
