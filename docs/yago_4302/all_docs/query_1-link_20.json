        "text": "Over the course of a remarkable career now spanning decades, Rick Rubin has established himself as one of the music industry’s most powerful figures — both behind the corporate scenes and on the front lines of the creative process. Even if he had stayed put with Def Jam Records, the hip-hop label he famously founded in his college dorm room, Rubin’s place in music history would have already been secured. Yet by branching out with his production ambitions (not to mention his spin-off Def American and then simply American Recordings), Rubin slowly built a resume as super producer, virtually without peer in terms of producing music of all stripes and styles. But we’ll dispense with some of that eclecticism for now in order to compile the Top 10 Rick Rubin Classic Rock Albums."
