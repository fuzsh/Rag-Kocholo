        "text": "Maybe. But it doesn't filter out stuff that sucks.\n\nLong tails work both ways. On the plus side, we get to hear artists we may never have heard of. On the minus side, the amount of sheer dreck one needs to wade through to find art that can stand alongside that which has traditionally been discovered, signed, mentored, developed, produced, marketed and supported by major labels historically is almost overwhelming. The signal-to-noise ratio is now much higher. (Of the hundreds of millions of websites one could look at, how many do you visit every day? New paradigms cause shifts in thinking, not necessarily modifications in behaviour).\n\nAnd Bandcamp? Some tracks from the Dolly Rocker Movement got your dollars - awesome. So that's six-and-a-half million other tracks that didn't. While it's true some artists have left their labels to join Bandcamp that's just the news we heard. What we weren't privy to were the reasons they left, and whether than bands album sucked and failed to deliver, or the band developed a nasty heroin addiction that saw the label's budget consumed in illicit white crystals. What it also fails to take into consideration are the bands that were on indies that left to go back to major labels - Nine Inch Nails, for example.\n\nLike I said, long tails work both ways. But for long tails to exist there still needs to be a common majority in the middle of the bell curve for the tails to be attached to. Columbia right now has not only the hip kids of the new century (Broken Bells, Foster the People, Passion Pit, MGMT) but also has the ones who have seen out the vicissitudes of the industry and maintained their integrity in the process (Dylan, Springsteen, Bowie, Patti Smith, etc...). While many of them make music on their own labels (Bowie's The Next Day was made on his ISO label, under licence to Columbia), many of them still prefer the world-wide clout that only comes from a major.\n\nIt's just too easy to point out how problematic the major label system is. Without it, there'd be no Miles reissues with the incredible out-takes, liner notes and multiple formats, no Beatles remasters, no undiscovered master tapes. Of the 136 DSD downloads I could buy from Acoustic Sounds right now, 132 of them wouldn't exist with a major label's master tapes to transfer from.\n\nYes, there's great indie labels and independent acts producing stellar work, but it's far from true to say only indies and independents produce great art.\n\nI think you missed the entire point. What I am trying to say is that consumers no longer value music as a commodity. So that means artists, major label, indie..whatever..\n\nare going to have to find different revenue streams than albums sales...which many have...detailed above....or continue to make music for the sheer passion of it.\n\nMajor labels served their purpose and as you point out they developed talent, funded, and distributed the great recordings of our time...in their day.\n\nI don't think anything was said to the contrary.\n\nI just discovered two AMAZING albums...just through putting my finger to the wind...there is still a TON of amazing music being made, despite\n\nthe bottom falling out on album sales. Major labels are no longer necessary except for reissues of historical recordings.\n\n1) Kanni by Tal National in a New York Times write up and immediately bought the album:\n\nRaw, Nigerian funk...addicting.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/arts/music/indie-grace-african-funk-whispery-muscle.html\n\n2) Lili & Madeleine, self titled. Magical and mystical from two sisters.\n\nI bought the download from Bandcamp for $8. Plus their EP.\n\nhttp://www.musictap.net/2013/11/04/review-lily-madeleine-lily-madeleine/\n\nI think you missed the entire point.\n\nWell, this is what you said:\n\nI can tell you in many ways the new paradigm is a big plus. It is going to filter out those who get into music for the purpose of getting rich and famous.Those will continue to create will do so knowing their odds of making a living are slim, so the creative passion must be an overwhelming desire.\n\nIt strikes me as more of an ignorant oversimplification than anything, and the fact that of all the musicians, bands, label heads, marketing and A&R guys I know at majors as well as indies, none of them ever entered into it with the sole purpose of getting rich and famous. Of those, I know only one platinum selling artist, and while she's certainly done ok from royalties, it's not lessened her creative passion - they're hardly diametrically opposed values. In fact, it was as a result of her creative passion that she became a platinum selling artist in the first place.\n\nSo I'm curious to know, of the artists you know signed to major labels, which ones are the ones who \"got into music for the purpose of getting rich and famous?\"\n\n(I know none.)\n\nWhat I am trying to say is that consumers no longer value music as a commodity. So that means artists, major label, indie..whatever.. are going to have to find different revenue streams than albums sales...which many have...detailed above....or continue to make music for the sheer passion of it.\n\nThe consumer has plenty more things to spend their disposable income on, that's true. But it's not new. The internet, gaming consoles, mobile phones, flatscreen televisions, personal computing and social networking have all been reducing the amount spent on albums for the last twenty years. And yes, monetizing music has been an incredible challenge to the industry in the face of downloading, declining record sales, tour costs, etc.\n\nBut it's not an either/or position - sell yourself out or make music for the sheer passion of it. Selling you song to a TV show or a major corporation can be a win in terms of exposure and saturation, but, in several cases I know, it means your candle burns much brighter but for far, far shorter. The buying public have fickle sensibilities and get sick of you. You get known as the soundtrack to a television commercial and you die an unglamorous death when it comes time to release the album and it's got that annoying TV ad music in the middle of it. I know bands right now being courted by ad agencies and clients to use their tracks for commercials (I work in advertising) and the last thing they want is to be known as the Doritos guys.\n\nAgain, you seem to know people I don't. I'd love to know which musicians and artists signed to labels who make don't \"make music for the sheer passion of it.\"\n\nMajor labels served their purpose and as you point out they developed talent, funded, and distributed the great recordings of our time...in their day. I don't think anything was said to the contrary.\n\nNo, that's true, you didn't. But you continue to wax lyrical over the abundance of amazing new music available on indie labels, and it doesn't change my previously stated perspective that the signal-to-noise ratio has never been higher.\n\nTwenty years ago I dropped out of university and worked for an independent record shop. We sold more of Lucinda Williams' Car Wheels on a Gravel Road and Emmylou Harris' Wrecking Ball in one year than Britney Spears' latest. (The fact that we ordered one copy, sold it, and didn't reorder it may have something to do with it.) We had a massive ECM section. We had a massive Trojan records section. We ordered American and German pressings of Lyle Lovett albums and never had less than half-a-dozen Autechre albums constantly in stock. So we focused on not being like all the other record stores and stocked Albert King and Chess reissues instead.\n\nEven then, the majors were struggling. There was a constant focus on pushing their tent-pole artists and neglecting their lesser-known acts (I had to convince a rep from Sony to release Travis' The Man Who in our territory because they wanted to focus on Michael Jackson's 20th Century Masters – The Millennium Collection instead.) It was unwieldy and top-heavy.\n\nBut I can't tell you how many indies I saw come and go in that time. An under-the-radar album or emerging artist you thought was awesome would sell a huge amount of copies until it went on backorder for 6 months, and then permanently. You'd find that the CD had split at the centre hole and send it back for credit and wait forever to get a replacement that never came. Indie's weren't any less susceptible to in-fighting and financial hardship than the majors were. Of all the hip hop and electronica labels that released albums in the 90's (of which I own many) I'd say less than 30% are still here.\n\nSo now we have two systems: The major label system and the indie system. Just like we did twenty years ago - surprise! Social media may be more effective at creating hype, but Bandcamp and MySpace (*snicker*) haven't replaced the majors any more than the \"revolution\" of iTunes has. Think the two-and-a-half million YouTube views of Flying Lotus' Mmm-Hmm meant two-and-a-half million record sales? The map is not the territory.\n\nI just discovered two AMAZING albums...just through putting my finger to the wind...there is still a TON of amazing music being made, despite the bottom falling out on album sales. Major labels are no longer necessary except for reissues of historical recordings.\n\nQuite a statement for someone who's not shouldered with the onus of releasing music. Though kinda at odds with this guy who is:\n\n\"Being in control of your own destiny was great,\" he says of the decision to go indie. \"It felt good to have my own neck on the line. But you spend a lot of time figuring out who the influential blogger at some radio station is. Market research is not a sexy thing to think about. More than that, when you're self-releasing, you have this walled garden of people that are interested in what you do, and to everyone else you're invisible.\"\n\nMeanwhile, as he sought to extend the boundaries of his fan base, he was reconsidering his role as a public figure.\n\n\"I was excited about Twitter when we went out on our own because it felt like the most direct way to penetrate people's attention,\" says Reznor, an early and eager adopter of the platform, who in his mid-aughts guise was quick to volley with fans and fire shots at fellow musicians. \"I also got a charge out of people realizing that I wasn't a recluse sleeping in a coffin. But in hindsight, my experimenting with Twitter was a mistake. Oversharing feels vulgar to me now. I know we've been fooled into thinking it's okay to show dick pics and that the Kardashians' behavior is normal, but it's not. I've tuned out in the last couple years. Everybody's got a ******* opinion. It takes courage to put something out creatively into the world, and then to see it get trampled on by cunts? It's destructive.\"\n\nThere's another factor to Reznor's more cautious approach to social media: \"I've had the experience over the last few years of liking bands, and then checking what they're up to on Tumblr or something, and immediately realizing, 'This is you?' ****.' I don't want my personality to get in the way of what I'm trying to do musically.\"\n\nOnce Reznor had sifted through the results of his various outreach trials, he decided he needed a hand. In November 2012, Columbia released An Omen EP by How to Destroy Angels, his ambient-pop project with Maandig and Ross; that was followed up with a full-length, Welcome Oblivion, earlier this year. \"It was no meddling, a modest advance, we split any profits,\" he says. \"If there used to be 100 people at a major working on a record, now there are 18, but they're the good ones. There's a lean, mean hunger. I'm not trying to be a major-label apologist, I'm just telling you what I saw. Instead of me and Rob Sheridan trying to figure things out, there's an extra 15 people and the sense that someone in France was aware of what we were doing — instead of us hoping we'd remembered that France existed. So when a Nine Inch Nails album was in the works, and the mission was to try to make as many people aware of it as we can, we thought, 'Let's try it. Let's see what happens.'\" (Still, he adds that NIN's deal with Columbia is \"not long-term.\")\n\nBut given Reznor's willingness to call bullshit on the corporate overlords, was there any hesitance from said overlords to get into the Nine Inch Nails business?\n\n\"With an artist like Trent, you have to trust that they're making the decisions they want to make,\" says Columbia Records Chairman Rob Stringer. \"He's been very smart about building up the demand for Nine Inch Nails by working on so many different things over the last few years — and the new record is so strong — that it feels like an opportunity for us to work with somebody who has an effect on pop culture. There was no trepidation on our part.\"\n\nSo far, so good. \"Nine Inch Nails feels bigger than it ever has,\" says a bemused Reznor. \"Is it because we're on Columbia? Is it scarcity? I don't know, but it doesn't feel bigger in the sense that we've desperately adopted some new clothing style. It feels organic, and it feels good not to be worrying about whether or not we shipped vinyl to the cool record store in Prague. I know that what we're doing flies in the face of the Kickstarter Amanda-Palmer-Start-a-Revolution thing, which is fine for her, but I'm not super-comfortable with the idea of Ziggy Stardust shaking his cup for scraps. I'm not saying offering things for free or pay-what-you-can is wrong. I'm saying my personal feeling is that my album's not a dime. It's not a buck. I made it as well as I could, and it costs 10 bucks, or go **** yourself.\""
