He’s met outside the prison gates by Run and the late Jam Master Jay. From there, things evolve into a cross between a blaxploitation flick spoofing the evils of the music industry and modern film noir… albeit with a plot as challenging as a Scooby-Doo episode. Attacked for being vulgar, sexist and racist, the film does boast some cool camera work and lighting, cameos galore (Rick Rubin and Russell Simmons both appear in acting roles as well as ’80s porn star Lois Ayres), plenty of dumb jokes that might be funny under the right circumstances and some cool-as-hell on-stage performances, including Run-D.M.C. rippin’ through “Beats to the Rhyme,” Slick Rick doing “Treat Her Like A Prostitute” and the Beastie Boys’ rendition of the rare track “Desperado.”"
