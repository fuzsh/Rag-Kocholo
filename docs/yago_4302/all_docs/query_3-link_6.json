As a commercial directors, our job is to have a distinct point of view on the agency script, and serve that script the way RR serves the album. Ultimately, leadership and collaboration are not mutually exlcusive. It’s the right balance that gets the best results for the spot.\n\nTwo recent videos I’ve make feature behind-the-scenes from a recent shoot.
