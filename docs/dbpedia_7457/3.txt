The St. Stanislaus Institute is a Slovenian Roman Catholic educational institution in Šentvid, Ljubljana. Its origins date back to the end of the 19th century, when Ljubljana Bishop Anton Bonaventura Jeglič presented the idea of creating the first fully Slovene-language upper secondary school. After many complications involving the city authorities' refusal to grant permission for construction in the center of the city, on 16 July 1901 Jeglič blessed the newly laid cornerstone of the institute. Construction lasted four years. The bishop blessed the building on 21 September 1905 and it was named after Saint Stanislaus Kostka.
