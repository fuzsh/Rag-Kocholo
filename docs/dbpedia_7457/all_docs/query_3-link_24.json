        "text": "School Profile\n\nSaint Stanislaus and Saint Stephen Schools are located in the center of Stevens Point. The schools focus on three main areas – Helping children become strong disciples of Jesus, outstanding academics, and personal attention and guidance. Each child’s education is tailored to meet their individual needs.\n\nSt. Stan’s, which includes 4k through grade 2, and St. Steve’s, which includes grades 3- 5, have been selected United States Department of Education Blue Ribbon Schools in 2008. The award is given to those schools that show the highest test scores when compared to all schools in the nation, as well as other outstanding academic and community programs. The school also received the “Innovations in Catholic Education” award in 2014 for outstanding literacy education from Today’s Catholic Teacher Magazine.\n\nAs a Catholic school, the emphasis is on helping children learn their faith and put it into practice. Weekly mass allows students to participate in many ways. Sacramental preparation and celebrations are held regularly. Service is stressed in the school throughout the year, including working with senior citizens groups, homeless shelters, area residents, local health centers, and more.\n\nThe academic focus of the school is to provide a challenging yet supportive curriculum to all students. Singapore Math is used in all grades, which greatly accelerates math learning. Numerous computer programs help support students in language arts and math. Reading is stressed at all levels in a variety of ways. Test scores are outstanding, as evidenced by the awards the school has received.\n\nThe school has formed numerous partnerships with the University of Wisconsin – Stevens Point. A Literacy Lab is held at St. Stan’s. UWSP professors teach college students reading courses in the ST. Stan’s building, and then those students work individually with school children. A Fluency Clinic, stressing fluency and comprehension, is held at St. Steve’s. Additionally the Math Department from UWSP works with all students on math problem solving. St. Stan’s has a shared Physical Education program with UWSP, using their staff and resources.\n\nThe staff has received numerous awards. Currently on staff there are seven teachers who have received the Herb Kohl Fellowship Award, recognizing the top 100 teachers in the state ( two others recently retired). Teachers and support staff have also earned numerous local awards as well. The principal has twice been named the Diocesan Administrator of the Year."
