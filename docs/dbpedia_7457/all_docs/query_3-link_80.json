        "text": "About Me\n\nMore\n\nIntro\n\nWhen you hear \"California,\" you probably think of the Hollywood sign sitting high above LA or the San Francisco skyline. But nestled away in the center of the Golden State is California's Central Valley—the flat, hot, and pretty conservative place that I call home.\n\nWhy, hello there. I'm CSU Stanislaus. I'm known for being a cheap date with class sizes small enough for you to get all the attention you deserve. What more can you ask for?\n\nYou may not have heard of me before, and that's okay. Really. I am on the small side. Also, I'm quiet and I don't host too many hotshots and celebrities. Still, I didn't let that stop me from making it to the twenty-eighth spot (out of 2,500) on TIME Magazine's Top Universities in the Country list.\n\nI'm not very flashy, nor am I located in a glamorous part of the state, but you can count on me to get you in and out before bedtime with minimum distraction or fuss.\n\nName\n\nTitus the Warrior\n\nHometown\n\nNestled south of Sacramento, east of San Francisco, and north of Fresno is a hot, dry patch of farmland and suburbs: Turlock, CA.\n\nBirthdate\n\n1957. I'm still young, but the years are starting to show a bit.\n\nBody Type\n\nI'm petite, but lately I've been putting on some weight. The truth is, I have trouble controlling my habits. I'm trying to keep up with myself but you know how it is. I have over 9,000 students, but my small campus hasn't quite kept up with enrollment. I'm working on that, though—I swear.\n\nBesides, no one stays on campus for long anyway. You'll often find yourself wondering where all those 8,999 people are. (Hint: at home with their parents or maybe San Francisco for the weekend.)\n\nCurrent Living Situation\n\nI'm not gonna lie: I'm kind of a big introvert. Many of my students can't afford to live on campus and Central Valley housing is pretty cheap, so you'll find most students are gone by the time class winds down. Besides, you'll often hear people say there isn't much to do on campus or around town anyway. If you choose to live off campus, there are affordable apartments across the street. Still, you'll have to share with families and locals who aren't exactly fond of college students.\n\nIf you choose to live on campus, prepare for some aging rooms your first year and newer, kitchen-equipped pads after. The dorms are relatively small, so it's a great way to make friends and get the ol' \"college experience.\" The food on campus can be a bit pricy, but if you want to eat off campus, you'll have to walk at least a couple of blocks to find something cheap. If you've got money to spend, Turlock's got some of the best diners, cafes, and restaurants around. Yelp will be your BFF.\n\nRelationship Status\n\nBeing an introvert means I don't really know much about the other schools around me. Modesto Junior College is a mere ten minutes north in—you guessed it—Modesto. Many students transfer in from there, and you can expect them to be a lot like CSU Stanislaus kids. I am a very local-serving school.\n\nTo the south is UC Merced, and aside from some collaborative research stints that you should definitely look into, I'm largely apathetic about them.\n\nI try not to get involved in drama and keep my head down, and since I'm so isolated (and don't have much going on in athletics), it works out a-okay.\n\nReligion\n\nI am a public school, but like most of the Central Valley, you'll find I've got a preference for Christians. God-fearing folk will definitely be at home here. Unfortunately, there's also the hint of bias against atheists; just don't discuss religion much, and you'll be fine…\n\nPolitics\n\nSure, California is a blue state, but the Central Valley is unforgivingly right-leaning with a low tolerance for \"lib'rels.\" Turlock is no exception. Don't believe me? Pull up the local news websites and take a glance at the comment sections.\n\nYou should apply to me if...\n\nyou want the most bang for your buck and don't mind one-hundred-degree spring semesters.\n\nWebsite\n\nhttps://www.csustan.edu/"
