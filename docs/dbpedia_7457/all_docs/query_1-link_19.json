        "text": "College Crest\n\nThe College Crest has the cross fleury and the horse-shoe in azure and argent in alternate quarters. The horse-shoe is taken from the family coat of arms of the Kostkas, to which family St. Stanislaus belonged.\n\nOne of his ancestors invented the spiked horse-shoe, which gained a valuable victory over the Russian Cossacks. The engagement took place across a frozen river. The Polish cavalry were enabled easily to rout the enemy, whose horses floundered and slipped, whilst their own horses had a firm grip on the ice.\n\nThe Kostka family was permitted to put the horse-shoe on its shield in commemoration of the event. The spikes on the shoe have now been transformed into crosses.\n\nSaints Motto\n\nThe Saints motto, âAeterna non Caduca\", was one of the sayings of St. Stanislaus Kostka.\n\nIt may be translated as:\n\n\"I LIVE NOT FOR TIME, BUT FOR ETERNITY\".\n\nThese pages cover the birth of the Catholic Grammer school for boys, spanning the mid-ninteenth Century and just about all of the 20th Century.\n\n-\n\nThe School Web Site\n\nThe new 2024 St. Stanislaus College (SSC) website covers all matters relating to Saint Stanislaus College as it navigates the complexities of the 21st Century.\n\nAbout SSC's History\n\nSt. Stanislaus College, known to all Guyanese as \"Saints\", was founded on May 1st,1866 as the all-boy Catholic Grammar School that was operated by the Jesuits. Saints has grown to become one of the many co-educational High schools located in Georgetown, Guyana.\n\nOn November 13, 1907, the College moved to the present Brickdam site and was named Saint Stanislaus College in honor of St. Stanislaus Kostka.\n\nThe college became co-educational in 1975 and shortly after became a government school in 1976, after being a fee-paying Catholic institution for 110 years."
