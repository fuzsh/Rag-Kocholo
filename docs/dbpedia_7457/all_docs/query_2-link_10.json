We are located just an hour's drive from the cultural offerings of New Orleans, on the picturesque Gulf of Mexico coastline. We welcome students from across the United States and around the world.\n\nAt Saint Stanislaus, students thrive academically and spiritually in an atmosphere of structure and friendly discipline grounded in the accumulated wisdom of the Brothers of the Sacred Heart.\n\nWe believe that all boys have the ability to excel and that college readiness requires an academic program tailored to students’ needs. Our college preparatory program integrates Advanced Placement (AP), honors curriculum, and Academic Assistance Program with a commitment to faith and community service to help young boys become men of character.\n\nOur unique location on the Gulf Coast of Mexico is an ideal setting for one of our signature programs – Marine Science.
