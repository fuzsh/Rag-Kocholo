Your ties to St. Stanislaus are strong if you graduated from the Elementary School, the High School, or attended one of these schools at some time in your life. Hundreds of thousands have attended these schools and have had their lives affected by the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth, the Franciscan Friars, and many lay teachers. If you are an alumni, the St. Stanislaus connection remains a heartfelt part of your life.\n\nWelcome! Enjoy being a proud member of the St. Stanislaus Alumni Association."
