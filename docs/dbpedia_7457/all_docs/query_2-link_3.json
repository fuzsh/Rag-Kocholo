        "text": "History\n\nIn June 1854 Fr. Stanislaus Buteux brought the Brothers of the Sacred Heart from France to open a boarding school for boys. Classes began in January 1856. In 1870 the state of Mississippi chartered Saint Stanislaus Commercial College to prepare boys for “a commercial state of life.” According to the Prospectus it accepted boys as young as seven, with four courses of study—primary, intermediate, commercial and superior. All courses of study required religion classes.\n\nThe commercial course—corresponding to senior high school and junior college-- required classes in composition, rhetoric, elocution, higher arithmetic, algebra, geometry, geography, ancient and modern history, bookkeeping, business, and French grammar. Music classes were available. Graduates received a Master of Accounts degree. By 1900 a four-year classical course with emphasis in Latin, Greek, modern languages, and literature was added. This led to a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Letters degree. After 1923 Saint Stanislaus no longer granted collegiate degrees. Today the school remains a very good college preparatory school.\n\nThe History notes that student organizations developed in the 1890’s. These included a dramatics club and a literary and debating society. The 1929 catalogue shows the following student organizations: Sodality of the Blessed Virgin, Society of the Blessed Sacrament, two Altar Boys societies, the College Orchestra, the Concert Orchestra, and the Concert Band.\n\nSchool enrollment continued to rise through vicissitudes such as the Civil War and the Yellow Fever epidemic. By 1900 enrollment was listed as 178. The 1927 catalogue shows 316 students representing eleven states and six foreign countries. The 2010 yearbook shows 415 students.\n\nBricks and Mortar\n\nThe first building at St. Stanislaus, a 2 1/2 story frame structure, was completed in 1856 at a cost of $3,800. It contained three classrooms and a parlor on the ground floor with a second-floor dormitory. As enrollment increased, buildings were added in 1859, 1867, 1882 and 1891. That year a façade with arches was added to unify the four main buildings. The entire structure was burned in January 1903.\n\nNew campus buildings were begun on September 19, 1903. With imported carpenters from Alabama, three main buildings were completed by March 19, 1903 at a cost of $52,000. A 1,000 seat baseball grandstand was added in 1916 and a gymnasium in 1924.\n\nSome campus buildings were damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2004.\n\nSports\n\nTeam name: Rock-a-Chaws\n\nSchool Colors: originally Pink and Green, these were changed to Cardinal and Black in 1915\n\nHistory notes that with the increase in student activities in the 1890’s, baseball became the favorite sport among students. “Most students belonged to an intramural baseball team.” In 1903 interscholastic sports began.\n\nWith the arrival of Forster Castleman in 1915, St. Stanislaus began sports in earnest. The 1919 football team went undefeated, outscoring opponents 253-28. The 1921 ream went 6-1-1. Jesuit High School and the Warren Easton Boys High School of New Orleans were among the high schools which yearly made up the schedule. College-level opponents included what is today Southern Mississippi and Southwestern Louisiana, as well as the freshmen or reserve team from Tulane and LSU. Big rivals were Jefferson College and Gulf Coast Military Academy.\n\nHistory shows that the 1924 basketball team finished second in the national prep tournament held in Chicago. The 1929 Rock-a-Chaws duplicated that feat.\n\nBecause of the number of younger students, St. Stanislaus fielded interscholastic football and basketball teams in weight classes."
