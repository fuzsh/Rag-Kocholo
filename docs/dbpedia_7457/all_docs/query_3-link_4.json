Time for our Saint Stanislaus School Community to welcome back each other and greet new members of our family. The beginning of the school year is filed with hope and possibilities. We are so very glad that soon the halls will be filled with teachers and staff ready to support and encourage, as well as children ready (or almost ready!) to become engaged and responsible learners. With the blessings of Christ and the support of our parents and families, we are delighted to open the doors to a new school year. See you soon!"
