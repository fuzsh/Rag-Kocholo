        "text": "Hurricane Katrina Roars In\n\nHurricane Katrina’s high winds and massive storm surge slammed into the Mississippi Gulf Coast on August 29, 2005. Brother Ronald Hingle, principal, stayed on campus with about 125 other faculty, staff and students during the historic storm. Prior to Katrina, Saint Stanislaus had never been evacuated in the 150 years since it was founded. Hurricane Katrina had a major impact on Saint Stanislaus and its surrounding neighborhood. Katrina destroyed many buildings, including the first floor and dormitories of Saint Stanislaus. The school was closed for two months. Saint Stanislaus, along with its next door neighbor Our Lady Academy, an all-girl Biloxi Diocesan Catholic school, resumed classes together on November 1, 2005, and operated jointly for the remainder of the 2005-2006 school year.\n\nSt. Stanislaus Rebuilds After Katrina\n\nSince 2005, Saint Stanislaus has renovated most of its campus buildings including renovating its famous 1,000-foot fishing pier (2010), building a new band hall (2007) and a new cafeteria (2010), remodeling its gym (2006), remodeling rec halls, classrooms, and offices (2014) remodeling its dormitory (2014) and remodeling its baseball and football fields (2013 and 2014).\n\nThe first game was played on the same piece of land owned by the Brothers of the Sacred Heart where the Brother Philip Memorial Athletic Complex is located today. The Rock-A-Chaws played host to the New Orleans Ramblers, an athletic club, on October 12, 1916. SSC gave the fans a lot to cheer for as they routed the Ramblers 82-0.\n\nIn 1915, Forster Commagere was hired as the school’s first full-time lay coach. He became the school’s first football coach and also coached basketball, baseball, and track and field. Commagere, a former Tulane football star, is credited with the development of some of SSC’s greatest athletic legends.\n\nDuring the first 100 years of gridiron play, the team collected Gulf Coast championships in 1919, 1929, 1938, 194, and 1948. The Rocks advanced to post-season bowl games in 1938 (Toy Bowl), 1941 (Toy Bowl), 1948 (CYO Bowl), 1950 (Cypress Bowl), 1952 (Shrimp Bowl), 1975 (Jaycee Bowl), 1984 (Wendall Ladner Bowl) and 2015 (Shrimp Bowl).\n\nIn 1982, the Mississippi High School Activities Association went to a classification system built on enrollment, but the Rocks chose to remain independent until 1989. SSC entered the division standings in football in 1990 and have advanced to the state playoffs in 1990, 1998, 2002-04, 2006-11, and 2012-14. They have a playoff record of 14-12 with three Division 8-4A titles (2004, 2009, 2013), two Class 4A South State championships (2009, 2014), and one Class 4A state championship (2009).\n\nIn 100 years of play, the Rocks have produced seven professional football players, five All-Americans, 24 All-State players and numerous All-Division/All-Conference players."
