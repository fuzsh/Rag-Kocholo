        "text": "Feast day : 13 November\n\nToday the Church celebrates the feast of Saint Stanislaus Kostka, a young Polish novice of the Society of Jesus. He lived during the period 1550-1568 and died at a young age of 17 years. His short life was marked with extraordinary holiness and spiritual favours. He is believed to have seen the Blessed Virgin in a vision in which she advised him to join the Society of Jesus. On another occasion when he was seriously ill, Saint Barbara appeared to him surrounded by angels and gave him Holy Communion. The extraordinary events continued even after his death. Two years after his death, when his body was exhumed, it was found to be incorrupt and emitting a sweet heavenly fragrance. He was canonized in 1726.\n\nEarly life:\n\nSaint Stanislaus was born in Rostkowo, Przasnysz County, Poland as the second child of the seven children of a noble family. His father was a senator of the Kingdom of Poland and Lord of Zakroczym and his mother was of a noble lineage too. At the age of 14, he and his elder brother Paul enrolled in the Jesuit College in Vienna where his desire for holiness intensified and his penances and prayers led him to experiencing many spiritual favours. Whilst his pious life was inspiring to the others, it irked his elder brother who often ill-treated him on this account. Stanislaus suffered all the unjust treatment with patience."
