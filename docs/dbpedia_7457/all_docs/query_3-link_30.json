Amen.\n\nWe seek refuge under your protection, O Holy Mother of God.\n\nDo not despise our pleas – we who are put to the test – and deliver us from every danger,\n\nO glorious and blessed Virgin.\n\nFuneral Notifications\n\nWould you or a loved one like to receive funeral notifications sent to your email on a regular basis?
