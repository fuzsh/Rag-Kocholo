        "text": "St. Stanislaus was a Polish bishop who lived in the 1000s. He was known for his holiness, and he was eventually martyred for his opposition to an evil king.\n\nLet’s use this novena to ask for intercession from this holy martyr!\n\nAbout St. Stanislaus\n\nSt. Stanislaus was born in a Polish village called Szczepanow, in 1030. He had no siblings, and his parents were pious members of the nobility. He went to Catholic school in Poland’s capital and then finished his education abroad.\n\nWhen Stanislaus returned to Poland, he was ordained a priest. He became the pastor at a church near Krakow. Then he was appointed archdeacon to Krakow’s bishop.\n\nDuring his time in this role, Stanislaus’ holy example and eloquent preaching moved many people to conversion. He had a positive influence on both laity and clergy around him.\n\nWhen the bishop died in 1072, Stanislaus was elected as his successor. He was reluctant to assume the position and only did so when Pope Alexander II explicitly commanded him to. Stanislaus was one of the first Polish bishops to have been born in the country. He also became a political advisor and had some influence in the political realm of the country.\n\nAs a bishop, Stanislaus helped accomplish the bringing of papal legates to Poland. He also encouraged the king to establish Benedictine monasteries to further the Christianization of Poland.\n\nStanislaus soon came into conflict with the king over a land dispute. Legend has it that Stanislaus miraculously resurrected a man who could serve as an eye witness against the king in the dispute.\n\nIt was not long before Stanislaus came into conflict with the king over a more serious matter. The king was warring unjustly, and Stanislaus publicly criticized the king over the matter. Stanislaus also criticized the king’s sexual immorality.\n\nAt first, the king acted repentant after Stanislaus’ criticism. But then he returned quickly to his former sins. Stanislaus carried on in his opposition of the king’s evil acts, even though the king threatened to have him charged with treason.\n\nEventually, Stanislaus excommunicated the king because of the king’s behavior. This enraged the king, and he sent executioners to kill Stanislaus without a trial. However, the executioners refused to touch him, so the king decided to kill Stanislaus himself. It is said that Stanislaus was celebrating Mass when the king killed him.\n\nAfter Stanislaus was killed, the king ordered the body to be cut into pieces so beasts could devour it. According to legend, the pieces of his body miraculously reintegrated.\n\nStanislaus’ murder so outraged the king’s subjects that the king was forced to flee to Hungary. Stanislaus was canonized in 1253.\n\nSt. Stanislaus’ Feast Day: April 11th\n\nWhy Pray the St. Stanislaus Novena?\n\nSt. Stanislaus is the patron saint of Poland and of the city of Krakow. You can ask for his intercession if you live in Poland or Krakow, or on behalf of someone you know you lives there.\n\nSt. Stanislaus is also a great saint to seek prayers from on behalf of your bishop because he was a holy bishop for much of his life.\n\nYou can also turn to St. Stanislaus for inspiration and intercession if you are in need of courage to stand up against the immorality of people in positions of power, as he was martyred for speaking out against his king’s immoral actions.\n\nYou can pray the St. Stanislaus Novena for any intention!"
