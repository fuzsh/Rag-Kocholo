The current 1881 structure was slated to be demolished during construction of the Kennedy Expressway in the 1950s, but Polish political clout steered the road around the church. The restored interior includes Zettler stained glass, Tiffany chandeliers, and a newly restored mural by Tadeusz Zukotynski. A lightning strike and fire claimed one of the church’s towers in 1964, but substantial ongoing restoration efforts have since stabilized the structure, including bracing the visibly tilting columns in the nave.",
