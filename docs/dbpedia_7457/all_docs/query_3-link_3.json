        "text": "HUMBLE BEGINNINGS 1854 – 1870\n\nBrother Athanasius Faugier, one of the original missionaries to America in 1847, took charge of the Brothers’ community in Shieldsboro (which later became Bay St. Louis), Mississippi, in December 1855. In October 1858, he purchased the original property and building for just under $8,000.\n\nGlowing Reputation 1870 – 1903\n\nSaint Stanislaus Commercial College, as the Brothers’ school became known, had already built a solid reputation as an outstanding institution. The college produced exceptional graduating classes and received excellent press coverage from the local media.\n\nBold Adaptations 1903 – 1923\n\nBrother Felix, faced with construction costs of the new buildings, turned to the alumni for financial assistance. It was the first time the alumni had been asked for a donation.\n\nSchool of Character 1923 – 1948\n\nAfter winning the Southern Catholic Conference, the SSC basketball team boarded a train to Chicago to play a 32-team national tournament. The Rock-A-Chaws lost in the finals to Marquette 25 to 19. They did walk away with the trophy for the best sportsmanship team.\n\nCapital Improvements 1948 – 1978\n\nBrother Peter started Camp Stanislaus in 1928 to create fun and character formation, setting its high standards and making it the most sought-after camp in the South. Thirty Brothers supervised 200 boys at the summer camp in 1953.\n\nSharing the Charism 1978 – 1996\n\nBrother Aquin Gauthier, alumni director in 1988, declared that year’s reunion in New Orleans “a great success.” About 460 SSC grads gathered at the Jefferson-Orleans to celebrate and reminisce. Some traveled great distances, even from Mexico for the event.\n\nNew Millennium 1996 – 2004\n\nIn 1998, SSC computer science instructor Mr. Bill Jennings put SSC on the world wide web at ststan.com. The website, under the direction of Brother Charles Schilling since 1999, has expanded to include many features of SSC.\n\nRenewal 2004 – 2023\n\nSaint Stanislaus has renovated most campus buildings since 2005, including our famous 1,000-foot fishing pier, a new band hall, a new cafeteria (2010), a new chemistry lab (2018), a new STEM lab, (2021), and many other improvements."
