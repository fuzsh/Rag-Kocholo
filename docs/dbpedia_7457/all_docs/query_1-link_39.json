        "text": "Our Values\n\nThe hallmarks for St. Stanislaus Catholic School\n\nTRADITION | FAITH | EXCELLENCE\n\nTradition\n\n“With praise and thanksgiving they sang to the LORD: “He is good; his love to Israel endures forever.” And all the people gave a great shout of praise to the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.”\n\nEzra 3:11\n\nEvery child longs for a sense of belonging and place. At St. Stanislaus Catholic School, we seek to instill a connection to those who have come before and lay the groundwork for those who will come after. Tradition provides the stable foundation upon which a strong and positive future is built. We work with our students daily to demonstrate the importance and relevance of tradition in their lives. It is this practicing of traditions that allows our students to feel connected to a broader world – past, present, and future.\n\nFaith\n\n“If you do not stand firm in your faith, you will not stand at all.”\n\nIsaiah 7:9\n\nFaith, above all, is the moral compass that guides each of our individual students in their words, actions and decisions. At St. Stanislaus, faith is not a subject taught in a lesson, but a way of life that permeates every lesson. As Catholic educators, our duty to our students includes fostering their spiritual development. Gospel values are the very center of our school community, giving our students the opportunity to share and grow in their faith-filled lives. A strong foundation of faith provides solace and comfort as our students grow and face common life challenges, and is an important part of creating well-rounded adults.\n\nExcellence\n\n“But as you excel in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all earnestness, and in our love for you—see that you excel in this act of grace also.”\n\n2 Corinthians 8:7\n\nOur students face a world where striving for excellence is a fading ambition. We believe that “good enough” isn’t good enough. As educators, we work to harness and strengthen students’ innate abilities to build their confidence so that they can find success in the face of any challenge – be it in school or in life. St. Stanislaus students learn not just to strive for excellence in academics, but in their relationships with themselves, with others, and with God."
