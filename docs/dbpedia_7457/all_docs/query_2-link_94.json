        "text": "Saint Stanislaus is known for its excellent location and extracurricular programmes. In fact, that is the exact reason why Yufei Chen chose to spend his formative years here. “My family and I chose Saint Stanislaus because of its beautiful location and the wonderful opportunities to get involved, including clubs and athletic teams,” he says.\n\nLocated on a picturesque campus in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, the school offers many extracurricular programmes, catering to different interests and fostering personal growth beyond academics. Whether your child is passionate about competitive sports, special interest clubs or service organisations, Saint Stanislaus ensures there is something for every child to explore and enjoy.\n\nAt this school ranked #2 in the state for athletics by Stacker Media, aspiring athletes have a wide range of competitive sports to pick from. From traditional options like football and basketball to more unique endeavours like sailing and esports, the school provides opportunities for athletes of all skill levels to participate and excel — all whilst building essential skills such as teamwork and discipline.\n\n“Being part of a team teaches you a lot about how life works, how to deal with people, how to be on time, how to pay attention to detail, and especially how you need to work hard to achieve your goals,” shares Eduardo Augusto do Carmo, who is part of the basketball and tennis programmes.\n\nBut it’s not just in the tracks and fields that Saint Stanislaus’s young men do well in. The school is committed to giving students the foundation necessary to go on to become men of character who have the ability to make the world around them a better place. Special interest and service clubs make this possible.\n\nWhether it’s band, chess or environmental activism, there are numerous platforms for them to express themselves and develop new skills. Service organisations, which promote social responsibility and community engagement, provide volunteering opportunities that allow students to contribute to meaningful causes and make a positive impact on the community. For example, students can participate in local clean-up initiatives, help organise charity events, or mentor younger students.\n\n“I learned how to see what someone needs and find the right way to help them. I also had to learn to anticipate needs and be prepared to act,” says Chen. “I learned to think and act quickly and to problem-solve. All of these things I now use on a daily basis in school. I know that they will benefit me forever.”\n\nBy participating in extracurricular programmes, students enhance their personal and social skills and prepare themselves for future challenges. The experiences they gain through these activities often equip them with valuable life skills such as leadership, time management and effective communication.\n\n“Saint Stanislaus is not only a place to study but also a place to grow, where I improved myself and became a man of character. It is more like a place where I was able to explore and challenge myself, almost like a small society where I got to try out everything. The school emphasises getting involved and recognises the lessons that can be taught outside of the classroom,” Chen adds.\n\nAnd where better to achieve one’s full potential academically, spiritually and physically than in state-of-the-art facilities? Saint Stanislaus has modern classrooms, well-equipped science and computer labs and an extensive library. Campus is home to sports complexes, music rooms, club meeting areas, and many other spaces and resources to encourage extracurricular excellence as well.\n\n“I had such a great balance between academics and extracurricular activities because the school supports you with teachers, coaches, and prefects who will guide you to the correct path to responsibility. I feel very prepared for college due to the habits I have learned over the past years,” says student Ian Gonzalez Rios.\n\nIt’s this kind of confidence for what lies ahead after graduation that sets Saint Stanislaus graduates apart. Apart from earning a diploma from one of the top private schools in Mississippi, students here have experience completing rigorous academic programmes, including Advanced Placement (AP) courses. And as the student-teacher ratio is low, this allows for personalised attention and support for each student’s preparation for university and beyond.\n\n“My time at Saint Stanislaus truly shaped me and prepared me for college. All the courses I took and the things I did in high school are useful for college, including academic and life skills courses as well as extracurricular activities. The time management and independence I learned at Saint Stanislaus have been truly helpful in my college studies,” shares Chen.\n\nApply to Saint Stanislaus today."
