        "text": "The Silesian (a region now in Poland) settlers, who established St. Stanislaus Parish in 1855, had a vision of one day having a school to provide educational opportunities for their children.\n\nThe first school erected in 1882, was a two-room frame building. This school at one time served as a public school (1895).\n\nA third room was added later on as the enrollment grew.\n\nBy 1920, the newly organized council of the Knights of Columbus, needed a meeting hall. They began to envision a two-story, native limestone, building with a Knights of Columbus meeting room on top and schoolrooms on the bottom. The building was begun on May 1, 1922 and was completed in May of 1924 and named St. Joseph's Catholic School.\n\nClasses in the new building began in the fall of 1924 for grade school and two years of high school. In 1929, the high school was discontinued while the lower grades (grammar school) were taught until June 1968, when the school was closed due to the high cost of educating the 100 students.\n\nThis building still attends the children’s needs housing Religious Education Classes, and its beautiful hall serves parishioners as a meeting room and social center.\n\nThe 1982 St. Joseph's School Renovation\n\nWhen St. Joseph's School closed in 1968, the building was used to teach Catholic Doctrine to the parish children. Since the building lacked modern heating, the old classrooms were outdated, the kitchen on the upper floor was inconvenient, and the building was too good to waste, something had to be done to bring it up-to-date to make it more viable.\n\nEarly in 1982, plans were made to make the building more suitable for parish needs. Five well-insulated classrooms and a library were created on the upper floor.\n\nOn the lower floor, well insulated partitions made four rooms out of two, south of the hallway. New glass was put into all of the windows. This work and most of the painting, was done by ladies of the parish.\n\nAir-ducts and a heating unit were installed upstairs and down. The renovation of the School was finished just before Christmas in 1982.\n\nThis is a great example of the determination, cooperation, and hard work of these volunteers that revived a historic building to make it useful in serving the need of a changing parish."
