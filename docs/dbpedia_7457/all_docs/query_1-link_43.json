        "text": "St. Stan’s has ongoing enrollment for students in Pre-school through Grade 8 for the current academic year. Applications are available on the Admissions and Tuition page. Please call the school at (413) 743-1091 for an appointment and to learn how we might best help your child develop to her/his greatest potential.\n\nOur child is having a wonderful experience at St. Stans. The classes are small and everyone gets along well and students are respectful of each other. The administration and the teachers go above and beyond with accommodations for learning differences.\n\nSt. Stan’s parent\n\nI have held poetry workshops throughout the commonwealth and recently visited St. Stan’s for that purpose. I worked with teachers and students, grades 5-8. The students are academically about two grade levels ahead of most other schools. In addition they were a delight to work with, bright, creative, respectful, and fun. Among the very best of schools.\n\nPaul Milenski, Ed.D., poet"
