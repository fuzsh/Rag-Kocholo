        "text": "Soloist: Jure Gradišnik, trumpet\n\nProgram:\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ballet music from the opera Idomeneo, KV 367\n\nDamijan Močnik,Trumpet Concerto\n\n*\n\nFranz Schubert, Symphony No. 4 in C minor, D. 417, Tragic\n\nIn 1780, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) received a commission from the Bavarian Electoral Prince Charles Theodore for an opera to be performed as part of the carnival celebrations in Munich. In his new work, the Italian opera Idomeneo, the composer included as many as seven extensive dances in the French manner, but we unfortunately do not know exactly where they were intended to be placed within the opera itself. Today, they are most often heard in concert performance as the independent dances of an orchestral suite.\n\nIn recent years, Damijan Močnik (1967) has established himself as one of the most important Slovenian composers of choral and vocal-instrumental music, and has a growing reputation abroad, as well. Among Močnik’s recent achievements is the opera Všeč si mi (I Like You), which experienced as many as 18 sold-out performances in the 2018/2019 season. Močnik works as a choirmaster and teacher at the music school of the St Stanislaus Institute in Ljubljana, as well as at the Ljubljana Academy of Music. He also leads several choirs, including the Megaron Chamber Choir. In 2022, he received the Prešeren Fund Prize for his work.\n\nFranz Schubert (1797-1828) is considered one of the most influential composers of the early nineteenth century, and he left a lasting mark on many genres in which his compositions are exemplary, from solo songs and piano miniatures to symphonies. In his short life, he created an extremely extensive oeuvre, including seven completed symphonies (out of the thirteen he commenced). He composed the Fourth Symphony, Tragic, at only 19 years of age, but it was not performed until more than two decades after the composer’s death.\n\nThe programme will be presented under the baton of our chief conductor Rossen Milanov, and the soloist in Močnik’s Trumpet Concerto will be Jure Gradišnik, who is a principal trumpeter of our orchestra and a former member of the Orchestra of the Slovene National Theatre Opera and Ballet Ljubljana. He is also a colleague of the composer at the music school of the St Stanislaus Institute in Ljubljana."
