        "text": "Historia Parafii – PL\n\nHistory of the Parish – EN\n\n” Come unto me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” – Matthew 11:28\n\nForward\n\nThe primary source of information for this brief historical account of our Parish is the book entitled Toward Brooklyn’s St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish Centennial by Rev. Bolesław Kumor, Ph.D., S.T.D.\n\nThe initiative for writing the book came from the Rev. Jan Sobótka, C.M. with the support of his three successive pastors, Rev. Walenty Pieczka, C.M., Rev. Stanisław Staniszewski, C.M. and Rev. Roman Górowski, C.M.\n\nThe book was translated into English and edited by Rev. Edward P. Gicewicz with the able assistance of Rev. Joseph Lachowski. Critique was offered by Ms. Krystyna Gutt and Mr.Raymond Kilanowski.\n\nThe Beginning\n\nPrior to 1896 there was only one Polish parish in the whole of Brooklyn, St.Casimir’s. The Poles who had begun to settle in South Brooklyn, Williamsburg and Greenpoint, were forced to make a long Sunday trek to hear Mass at St.Casimir’s. The situation was alleviated with the establishment of two churches in 1896, Our Lady of Częstochowa in South Brooklyn, and St. Stanislaus Kostka in Greenpoint.\n\nAlthough the founding year of the parish has been established as 1896, the founding pastor, Father Leon Wysiecki, did not become pastor officially until 1898. There is no mention of a pastor having been appointed prior to 1898, but it can be assumed that Father Wysiecki functioned as ex officio pastor during that period.\n\nFather Wysiecki on October 12, 1894 purchased the original ten lots on which St. Stanislaus Kostka Church now stands at the corner of Driggs Avenue and Humboldt Street for fifteen thousand and five hundred dollars. The purchase was in itself a feat of no small proportion since the tract centered in an area with a strong German Protestant presence.\n\nOne account of the transaction indicates that Father Wysiecki used an intermediary in all but the final stages of negotiations with the German gentleman who owned the property. When the good Father finally appeared in person, it was as a businessman speaking fluent German.\n\nFather Leon Wysiecki\n\nFather Wysiecki was born June 19, 1866, in Luzino, close to the town of Wejherowo, presently in the province of Gdańsk. After completing seven years of elementary school, he emigrated to the United States where in 1886 he entered the Polish Seminary in Detroit. He was ordained a priest in the diocese of Brooklyn on November 28, 1891 by the Most Reverend John Loughlin. Father Wysiecki became pastor at St. Casimir’s seven months later. Fr. Wysiecki was instrumental in the establishment of Our Lady of Częstochowa Parish, as well as St.Stanislaus Kostka, both in 1896.\n\nFather Wysiecki subsequently endured much criticism from those who questioned the wisdom of selecting a parish site in the midst of a sea of German people. When we assess this act from the historical perspective, we must concede the virtue of Father Wysiecki’s foresight. Instead of serving just one group such as Williamsburg or lower Greenpoint, he chose instead a more central location, one capable of serving a much broader population. With the influx of later immigrants the parish developed splendidly. By 1909, it was necessary to establish Our Lady of Consolation Parish in Williamsburg, and in 1917, Sts. Cyril and Methodius Parish in Northern Greenpoint.\n\nThe First Twenty-Five Years\n\nOur parish’s first building still serves us today under the familiar title of “the old school”. Of course, the basic structure has been altered from the original two?story building consisting of church, school, and parish auditorium in the basement under the school.\n\nWe are not certain of the exact construction date of the small building connected to the old school, which served the parish as its first rectory, located at 185 Driggs Avenue, and now known as “the old convent.” We assume it to be 1896 also, although it may have been built at an earlier date, since it is not known where Father Wysiecki lived during his intermittent stays here while overseeing the church’s construction before the dedication. There has always existed the unconfirmed opinion that this indeed is the oldest parish building. It may be that originally it consisted of only one floor, and that it was expanded in 1901?02 to become the convent after the new rectory was built. An examination of its unusual construction lends some evidence to this theory since we can see that the building actually has two distinct main entrances, one at the head of the outside stairs, and one underneath them.\n\nOur Parish Church\n\nBy the end of 1896, we had the essentials for the development of the parish: a church and a school. Important as they were, however, they represented only the initial step in the growth of the parish plant. We truly must admire the tremendous zeal and patient efforts of the parishioners of those early days who constantly could be exhorted to ever greater sacrifices. We must admire also the energies of Father Wysiecki who, although deeply involved in the details of building, at the same time was paying off debts, and planning what must be done in the immediate future.\n\nIt is not unusual, considering the American tempo of getting things done, that we see built in the space of eight years everything that has made our parish great. By 1900, Father was not looking for a site for the new church, he was looking for the type of church that he would like to build. He found the type and announced to the congregation his ideal. A contract for the new rectory was signed in May, 1901, and work was started the same month, with occupancy scheduled for 1902. Although small, it was handsome and solidly built of the same material that would be used to build the church in 1904. Originally intended for two or three priests at most, eventually it accommodated six priests, and served our parish for fifty?five years.\n\nFather Wysiecki signed a contract for the “beautiful” church in 1903, and the construction with the actual groundbreaking began July 1, 1903. This church would cost seventy?five thousand dollars, a staggering sum in days when a nickel was considered a large sum of money. Work on the church began on July 1st, and on October 4th, the Bishop dedicated the cornerstone.\n\nThe months, following the consecration of the cornerstone, saw unceasing efforts to make the interior appointments comparable in magnificence to the exterior. Father Wysiecki spurred his parishioners on to sacrifice. His enthusiasm was rewarded with a continuing stream of contributions from individuals and organizations for the altars, statues, organs, and clock. Even the school children participated, canvassing parishioners’ homes for offerings for the stained glass windows. By November 13, 1904, there stood a beautiful new church, Gothic in style, with twin towers reaching toward heaven. The church had a seating capacity of one thousand two hundred and fifty, with a thousand seats in the main portion, and two hundred fifty in the choir lofts.\n\nDedication of the Church\n\nThe new church was dedicated appropriately on November 13, 1904, the Feast of Saint Stanislaus Kostka.\n\nTo finish the detailing of the parish buildings we must note that many more years were required for the completion of the church. In 1914, funds were gathered for the marble pulpit, the painting of the church, the electric candelabra, the tower clock, and, in 1919, the copper roof. The most significant financial outlay at the time, however, was undoubtedly the thirty-five thousand dollars used in 1912 and 1913 to reconstruct the old school which is still in use.\n\nArchbishop Symon In Our Parish\n\nIn 1905, Archbishop Albin Symon visited our parish, the first Polish bishop to come to America. Born in 1841, near Żytomierz, under Russian rule, he entered the Seminary there. He continued his studies at the Academy of Petersburg (where he later became rector), as well as, in Germany. He was named Bishop of Mohylew in 1891 and appointed to Plock in 1897. When he refused to cooperate with the Russian take over of the Church in Lithuania, however, he was exiled to Odessa. Upon being freed, he journeyed to Rome, where in 1901 he was named Archbishop.\n\nDuring this time, Polish Catholics, like their Irish and German predecessors, had taken root in America for some time. In spite of the large numbers of Polish parishes, however, we had no one in the hierarchy of the church to represent our interests or to settle our disputes. The Polish Catholics, therefore, found it necessary to organize a delegation to Rome. The group was headed by Father Wacław Kruszka, the author of The History of Poland in America. In response to their petitions, Pope. Pius sent Archbishop Symon to America as his personal representative to investigate matters and report to him. Archbishop Symon visited America for several months in 1905, which included our parish. As a result of the evidence which he compiled and especially because of the Archbishop’s personal involvement with the Polish?American Church, Father Paul Rhode was appointed as the first Polish?American Bishop in 1908. We have since never been unrepresented in the hierarchy.\n\nPaderewski At St. Stan’s\n\nOn Tuesday, March 1, 1916, at 7p.m. “The Paderewskis will visit us,” reads a parish announcement of that time. These were, also, the World War years, when Poland was involved in another bitter struggle for its existence. We know from historical texts the extent of Polish?American participation in this rebirth of Poland, even though not as much is known of our own parish involvement. We know of the existence of a Cadet Military Organization and of Sokół Groups, which had come into being at Father Wysiecki’s behest in 1912. From these groups, many volunteers joined Haller’s Army to fight for Poland. We know of at least eighty individuals from our parish and from Our Lady of Consolation, who joined these volunteers.\n\nAnother announcement from November 23, 1913, dealt with a meeting of the Rada Narodowa, Council for the Welfare of Poland. This Council, headed by Bishop Rhode, had just come into being and encompassed all religious and patriotic Polish organizations and publications. When Paderewski came to America, the Council created a committee whose aim was to exert influence on the opinion of the United States so that America would support the cause of freedom for Poland. Point thirteen of Wilson’s famous Fourteen Points was a direct result of its efforts. This demanded the guarantee of free access to the sea for Poland. The Council also obtained millions of dollars of material assistance as well as twenty?eight thousand volunteers for Haller’s Army. Our parish was directly involved in these efforts.\n\nFirst Twenty?Five Years Our Heritage\n\nWho were the parishioners during the first twenty?five years of the parish of St. Stanislaus Kostka? We can affirm in all certainty, that these were people who were young, energetic, ambitious, and loyal to the Catholic faith and their Polish heritage. The wonderful memorials which they left for posterity attest to and confirm the above.\n\nFrom whence did they come? Utilizing the parish registers of baptism and matrimony as primary sources, we conclude that approximately one?half of the early parishioners emigrated from that region of Poland that bordered on what was then known as East Prussia, hence from the vicinities of Bydgoszcz, Włocławek, Plock, Przasnysz, Ostrołeka, Białystok, and naturally from Róstkow— the birthplace of St. Stanislaus Kostka, patron of our parish.\n\nAnother part of the pioneer group traces its ancestry from Małopolska (Galicja), hence from the regions of Rzeszów, Tarnów, etc. Following the preceding group, we find emigrants from Pomorze, the district of Poznań. It was not until after World War, that, with the influx of new emigrants, the Poles from the Eastern lands of Poland, Wolyn and Lwów, began to settle within the boundaries of our parish. They had trekked their way to America through hardship and long difficult journeys of exile through Asia, Africa, and South America.\n\nSilver Jubilee\n\nWe concluded the first twenty?five years of the parish on a joyful note, with the observance of its Silver Jubilee. The official celebration took place December 11, 1921, with the celebration of a Solemn High Mass by Father Theodore Regulski, the first priest to be ordained from the parish.\n\nThe Next Twenty?Five Years\n\nThe second quarter century of our parish’s existence did not begin auspiciously. On December 15, 1921, only a few days after our Silver Jubilee celebration, a fire broke out in the church devastating the sanctuary and the Main Altar which was made of wood. Apparently the fire was caused by the cracking of a candle glass. We can appreciate the extent of the damage from the fact that the Bishop permitted the parish to secure a loan for forty thousand dollars to repair the damage.\n\nAt the time of the Jubilee, it seemed as though the parish was on a firm footing. The sight of the completed church, school, convent, and rectory gave rise to a collective sigh of relief that at last an end had come to the wearisome task of collecting money and soliciting donations. The fire caused the entire cycle of solicitations to begin again for several months in 1922.\n\nIt was at this point that a feeling of unrest became evident in the parish. Father Wysiecki, in an effort to calm things down, scheduled a Mission for the summertime. The discontent continued to grow, until, in September, it erupted into a full scale revolt against Father Wysiecki who left in the face of this disapproval.\n\nNaturally, one wonders what caused this strife to which Father Wysiecki became a martyr. At the time, no one investigated the causes fully and by now it is impossible to be completely accurate. One thing is certain— there was no one cause. From its very beginning, the parish had a group of malcontents who were dissatisfied with the site of the church. For several years, Father Wysiecki also had to contend with a small cadre of restless nationalists who, shortly before he left the parish, broke away with a sizable number of parishioners, forming their own independent Church of the Resurrection. Finally, these were times ripe for dissent since they marked a growing awareness of national consciousness. Our early parishioners, many of them rural immigrants, had to undergo many hardships and inconveniences before they obtained the necessary documents and arranged transportation to cross the ocean. Here they found themselves in totally unfamiliar surroundings. They had many problems to contend with and insufficient resources to resolve them. The lack of knowledge and uncertainty was expressed in disagreements among themselves.\n\nThere was one more element which must be considered as a possible factor in the parochial dissension— money. Consider the thousands of dollars spent in building such a magnificent parish plant. Consider that these people not long ago had torn up their roots in Europe and transplanted themselves where they had to give continuously for twenty?five years. In view of all of the potential strain in the parish, is it right to speculate that instigators could rise to turn a segment of the parishioners against their pastor?\n\nIn 1922, after the last Sunday of September, Father Wysiecki left the parish for Poland, resigning in December of that year as pastor of St.Stanislaus. A few years later in 1924, he once again became pastor in Solec Zdrój, Diocese of Kielce, Poland, where he died on December 10, 1925. He was buried there, but at the request of his family his body was disinterred and buried in Wejherowo, where most of his family was living.\n\nThe Vincentian Fathers Come To Our Parish\n\nFollowing Father Wysiecki’s departure, the Bishop appointed a temporary administrator, Father Thomas Nummey, pastor of Holy Child Jesus Parish in Richmond Hill. He was responsible for the financial affairs of the parish, while spiritual matters were turned over to the Vincentian Fathers Mazurkiewicz and Jęczmionka. In December of 1922, the Bishop directed Father Nummey to announce publicly the resignation of Father Wysiecki and the assignment of Father Mazurkiewicz as pastor. Slowly, with the continued efforts of the Missionaries the parish unrest subsided. Nevertheless, in 1923 Father Casper Słomiński, C.M., then Provincial of the Polish Vincentians in Cracow, asked that the congregation be relieved of this assignment since the Missionaries were needed elsewhere. At the insistence of the Bishop, a Vincentian Fathers’ House was established at St. Stanislaus Kostka with Father Paul Waszko as its Superior. Assuming the role of pastor, as well, he established the official assignment of the Vincentians to our parish, where they remain until today.\n\nOur First Vincentian Pastors\n\nThe first of the Vincentian Fathers to take charge of our parish was Reverend Anthony Mazurkiewicz, C.M. Father Mazurkiewicz was born on June 21, 1877, in the ancient city of Toruń, Poland. He attended the Vincentian Fathers’ Seminary in Cracow where he received Holy Orders in 1903. He was transferred to the United States in 1907, and the following year he was appointed pastor of St. Stanislaus B.M. Church in New Haven. During his thirteen?year tenure, he was responsible for the building of a fine church.\n\nAfter Father Mazurkiewicz assumed his pastoral duties at St. Stanislaus Kostka in 1922, the parish gradually returned to a state of stability. Although, only with us for one year at first, he returned to us in 1929 to guide us for six more years.\n\nIn 1923 Reverend Paul Waszko replaced Fr. Mazurkiewicz as pastor. Father Waszko was born on September 13, 1873, in the Silesian town of Twardawa. Like his predecessor, he graduated from the Vincentian Seminary in Cracow where he received Holy Orders in 1898. He came to America in 1903 as one of the pioneer group and was pastor at St. Michael’s in Derby, Connecticut, prior to becoming pastor at St. Stanislaus Kostka in 1923.\n\nUnder Fr. Waszko’s pastorate we acquired our beautiful Main Altar and statuary, the marble Baptismal Font which was imported from Europe, and the organ which, along with a statue of St. Vincent de Paul, was blessed in 1924 on July 19th, the Feast Day of St. Vincent. Father Waszko also acquired the property for the new school site, but the task of erecting the school fell to his successor.\n\nReverend John Pieniążek, C.M., became our pastor in 1927, Father Pieniążek was born on November 27, 1894, in the city of Prezeworsk, Poland. After attending the Vincentian Seminary in Cracow, he was ordained a priest in 1918 and came to the United States in 1922 where he was immediately assigned to St. Stanislaus Kostka as an assistant until becoming our pastor.\n\nFather Pieniążek, though with us only two years, left behind a solid reminder of his efforts in the form of the eighteen classroom school he built. The school, dedicated by the Bishop on the Feast of Corpus Christi in 1929, caused the staggering debt of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars to be repaid during the approaching Depression. Those of us who have children in school during today’s financial crisis might well be encouraged by the sacrifices of the parishioners of those earlier days. Father Pieniążek had tuberculosis, and after unsuccessful efforts to check it in Mexico and Switzerland, he returned to Poland to stay in a sanitarium at Zakopane. He died there in 1936 at the age of forty?two.\n\nArchbishop Cieplak’s Visit\n\nIn November, 1925, Pope Pius sent Archbishop J. Cieplak as his special emissary to the Polish community in America. This Archbishop had been well?known to them and to the world at large since 1920, when he had been jailed by the Communists in the purges which they instituted against the religious working in the territories which the Communists had taken over. The death sentence passed upon him was commuted in 1923 and he was committed to life imprisonment. Appeals from the European powers and the United States had led to his release after two years of intense physical and spiritual suffering. He visited our parish on September 16th of the following year, speaking to the parishioners while presiding at Benediction services and imparting the Papal Blessing. This was all the time he could allow for any one place, since in all, he visited three hundred and seventy?five parishes and delivered eight hundred addresses. This rigorous schedule imposed on his already weakened physical condition proved too much and he died of pneumonia in Passaic, New Jersey, on Feb. 17, 1927, just before his scheduled departure for Wilno of which he had been named Archbishop. Thus, he returned to his beloved Poland numbered among its martyrs.\n\nThe 1930’s\n\nAfter thirty years, the times were changing and so were the people. Father Mazurkiewicz returned to the parish as pastor in 1929, only to leave it again in six years upon being named Vice?Provincial of the Polish Vincentians. In his stead came Fr. Joseph Studziński, for whom new problems evolved. The Depression created unemployment which the St. Vincent de Paul Society attempted to relieve. The entire parish became involved with the formation of a Joint Committee of Parish Societies. Bingo, which still exists today, began at this time as a new way to obtain money for parish needs. Even though the forms of their service to the people changed, what did not alter was the dedication of their priests to them. An example is to be found in Fr. Victor Kozłowski who suffered a breakdown from overwork.\n\nFather Joseph Studziński\n\nAt this time, certain customs became established, such as the daily hearing of Confession and occasional Weeks of Recollections for the youth of the parish.\n\nIn 1926, Father Mazurkiewicz brought from Rome a relic of the recently canonized Saint Theresa of the Infant Jesus. A statue in her honor was blessed and a novena took place. Novenas then took place with regularity. Devotion to this Saint intensified with the donation to our parish of a magnificent original oil painting by Tadeusz Styka in 1934. This was blessed on May 30th, by Monsignor Puchalski. Father S. Konieczny, the Superior from Derby, Connecticut, preached on this occasion, which also marked the beginning of a novena conducted by the well-known Father Adam Piasecki, C.M.\n\nThe Autumn of 1930 marked the Hundredth Anniversary of the apparitions of Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal and the beginning of novenas to her in our parish. A triduum in honor of Blessed Catherine Labouré, the Daughter of Charity to whom Our Lady appeared, took place on January 28th, 29th and 30th in 1934. Both, Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal and St. Catherine are especially dear to the Vincentians.\n\nA Calendar of Church Services\n\nFollowing are the highlights of a typical calendar of liturgical events at St.Stanislaus Kostka Church. Many of these events date back to 1930 and earlier. On the first Sunday of January, the Pastor renders a financial accounting to the parishioners and expresses appreciation to those who worked for the parish during the preceding year. On the Feast of The Three Kings, incense and chalk are blessed, followed by kolenda, the visiting of parishioners’ homes by the priests.\n\nFrom February to March there is the blessing of candles, blessing of throats and distribution of ashes on Ash Wednesday. Forty Hours’ Devotion was held in February until 1946 when it was moved to November to coincide more closely with the Feast of St. Stanislaus Kostka. During Lent, Stations of The Cross are held on Wednesdays and Fridays. Gorzkie Żale are held on Sundays. Holy Week ceremonies begin with the blessing of the Palms and conclude with Święconka (blessing of food in church), and the Resurrection Procession on Easter Sunday morning.\n\nIn May, daily devotions to Our Lady and the conferring of the Sacrament of First Holy Communion takes place.\n\nJune sees the Corpus Christi Procession and Devotions to the Sacred Heart on Fridays and Sundays.\n\nThe celebration of the feast of St. Vincent de Paul, founder of the Congregation of Priests of the Mission (Vincentian Fathers), was part of the July events. The feast is now celebrated in September.\n\nSolemn Vespers on November 1st, begin the annual novena for the Souls in Purgatory. The church is always crowded for the Christmas Eve Midnight Mass. Wine is blessed and distributed on the Feast of St. John, December 27th. The year concludes with Solemn Vespers on December 31st.\n\nThe Sisters’ Convent\n\nOne of Father Studziński’s greatest accomplishments was the building of a new convent in 1940. He announced the beginning of construction at a March meeting of the Parish Committee. Open House was held on October 27th, and the interior was finished by November 15th. The first Vincentian pastor, Fr. Mazurkiewicz, dedicated the building on November 25th. The cost had been eighty?five thousand dollars.\n\nThe old convent came in handy just then for a number of wartime projects. One of these was the cooking and sewing school conducted by our energetic Sisters, to which even ladies from outside the parish enrolled. Thus we see that we had a very active parish with a broad spectrum of talents, and activities, all of which would be utilized in the wartime years.\n\nThe World War II Years\n\nIt is significant to note that the Patron, our parish weekly, began its publication in 1941. Although it was not directly connected with the war, because it reported on the activities of the parish and served as a means of communication with our servicemen, there is no doubt that it increased the effectiveness of our war efforts.\n\nWe are all familiar with the calamitous events in Europe in 1939, and particularly those that led to the imprisonment of so many Poles as well as their forced evacuation to the ends of the earth.\n\nThe plight of their brothers and sisters stirred the hearts of the Polish?American community to action. Thus, the Rada Polonii Amerykańskiej (Polish?American Relief Committee) was formed organizing the Polish community on a nationwide scale. This group, operating from Chicago, worked with the Red Cross to see that contributions and donations were received as intended. They helped in Poland until the fall of France and sent countless packages of food, medical supplies and clothing to prisoners of war and refugees all over the world. This assistance continued after the war to the displaced persons. This was only one of the organizations so functioning, others being the Bishops’ Committee for Polish Relief and the Catholic League. From the parish announcements and records, we can conclude that our own parish took an extensive part in these activities.\n\nIn 1941, there were collections for the Relief Fund and a newly organized Committee for Polish Soldiers’ Aid which collected clothes and knitted sweaters and other warm woolen garments. The accounts of Rada Polonii indicate that our 1941 contribution of $4,320 was among the highest. When the United States became involved actively in the war, the parishioners turned even more devotedly to the war effort. Some one hundred ladies became Red Cross Volunteers. On August 16, 1942, one hundred and twenty individuals, from both St.Stanislaus and Sts. Cyril and Methodius Churches, including their pastors, gave blood. Clothing continued to be collected and woolen garments knitted. Even, the schoolchildren learned first aid and a group known as the Crusaders wrote to the soldiers from our parish sending them opłatek at Christmas time. The answers of these thousands of young men, especially those overseas, were most moving as they thanked the Sisters, children and their dear ones for the letters and packages.\n\nEven though so many young people who had been our workers, were missing from our parish, nevertheless, there was a great number of fundraising activities to send packages to them. The October 28, 1945 Patron repeats statistics from the Tablet. The statistics indicate that while some parishes gave two to three thousand men to the services, the highest number any of them had lost was eighty?four. However, while we gave 1,595, we have the dubious distinction of having the largest number of Gold Star mothers since we had lost ninety?four lives.\n\nOur Help For The Church of The Holy Cross in Warsaw\n\nIn our own jubilee year, 1946, we hosted Father Leopold Petrzyk, C.M., pastor of Holy Cross Church in Warsaw. This long?famed and well?known edifice had been almost completely demolished in the 1944 uprising. Father Petrzyk came to his Polish brethren in America for help in rebuilding this landmark. He preached in our parish and in many others, using us as his home base, for here was his schoolmate, Father Studziński. When he returned with funds to restore the church to its original beauty, he left us a legacy of Patron articles recounting the plight of the children in Poland during the German occupation.\n\nThe Golden Jubilee of the Parish\n\nSt. Stanislaus Kostka Parish celebrated its Fiftieth Anniversary in 1946. The preparations had begun some time earlier since we can find that on January 22, 1944, a notation is made of the first offering for the painting of the church. This unassuming heading “the painting of the church” actually meant a great deal more, including new lighting fixtures and kneelers, the renovation of the marble pillars, gilt work and the Main Altar. In other words, it meant completely redecorating. The generosity of the parishioners proved equal to the task. With the number of donations increasing daily as the Jubilee approached, it is no wonder that not only was the entire cost of the renovation -forty thousand dollars? met before the Jubilee, but all other parish debts as well! Early in 1946, Father Studziński announced that, having renewed our place of worship, it was time for a spiritual renovation in the form of a three-week mission which would conclude Palm Sunday, April 14th.\n\nThe actual celebration lasted only three days. A Solemn High Mass was celebrated on November 28th, which happened to be Thanksgiving Day. The celebrant was Father Stanislaus Rysiakiewicz, a parishioner and one of the first assistants in the parish. He was helped by Fathers John Regulski, Edward V. Rutowski and Francis Romanowski, all born in this parish. The preacher was Bishop Stephen Wożnicki, Auxiliary of Detroit, Michigan. Our own ordinary, Bishop Thomas Molloy, presided, speaking after Holy Communion and administering a special Papal Blessing while extending his good wishes to us.\n\nThere was a banquet in the parish hall at 8p.m. on Saturday. On Sunday at 4p.m., there was a program in which the schoolchildren, St.Cecilia’s Choir, Alumni Choir and the Dramatic Circle took part as well as speakers representing the various groups in the parish. At the end of the program, with the assistance of the oldest and youngest member of the Parish, Father Studziński burned the mortgage, symbol of the parish’s financial debt. Finally a Mass on Monday commemorated the dead parishioners and benefactors of the parish.\n\nTowards The Diamond Jubilee\n\nOur parish moved into its third quarter century. Some of the first parishioners saw a third generation taking its place in the parish. Gradually, the exclusive use of the Polish language gave way to occasional English announcements. There were still strong ties to the mother country, and our generosity continued, in an effort, to help rebuild it. Continuing stories of atrocities reached our ears. We heard of unprovoked shootings of citizens, of mass graves in the forest, of the martyrdom of eleven Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth, and of desecration of sacred vessels and vestments. The Rada Polonii, Bishops’ Committee and Catholic League continued to provide material assistance: money, clothes and canned goods to relieve the poverty and destitution. The Fund for Immigrants, operated to assist the displaced persons, especially those interned in Germany. This work continued until the Polish government disbanded the “Rada” leaving the continuation of this work in the hands of individuals. We had our own one?man relief organization in the person of Father Francis Krzyżak.\n\nA Very Special Loss\n\nOur pastor, Father Joseph Studziński, after successfully conducting the celebration of the Golden Jubilee, returned to Poland to visit his family in 1948. In the Spring of 1949, he became seriously ill, requiring hospitalization and surgery. However, he recovered and returned to work as in the past. Then on November 29, 1954, he again quietly entered the hospital supposedly for minor surgery. He died December 3, 1954, at 10 a.m. The news of his death shook the entire parish. There were throngs of tearful people lining the streets as his body was borne into the church on Sunday. Here a vigil was consistently kept by the members of the American Legion, St. Stanislaus Kostka Memorial Post and the Ladies Auxiliary. It was evident that God had indeed taken to Himself not only a good pastor, but a very special man as well.\n\nFather Studziński died at the age of sixty?seven, having labored twenty years in our parish. After Father Wysiecki’s departure, the diocesan priests had remained somewhat aloof, until in Father Studziński’s time the ties were renewed. He had been able to unite two seemingly disparate characteristics: a gentle disposition and a firmness in executing his responsibilities. The extent of his influence is best measured by the numbers of Masses requested for his soul and the love with which his memory is spoken of to this day.\n\nFather Studziński’s last accomplishment was the renovation of the lower church, which included the installation of a new altar.\n\nOn March, 1961, on the recommendation of the American Legion Post #1771, the Mayor of New York with his Council authorized Father Studziński Square at the corner of McGuiness Boulevard and Driggs Avenue. Indeed, an honor to a Polish priest in New York City. The square with a monument was officially dedicated on September 15, 1963.\n\nThe New Pastor\n\nOn Sunday, January 2, 1955, Father Mazurkiewicz officially installed the new pastor, Father Francis Hładki. No small task awaited Father Hładki as Father Studziński’s replacement. He took on this new challenge, however, with the quiet strength and determination that he had brought to all his previous assignments.\n\nFather Hładki was born December 2, 1894 in the parish at Kaczyka, Bukowina. He attended the Vincentian Minor Seminary at Nowa Wieś, Cracow where he was ordained on June 24, 1917. He came to the United States in 1926. From 1935 to 1938 he was the pastor of St. Stanislaus Bishop and Martyr, New Haven where he managed to pay off a huge debt, build a new rectory and renovate their lower church.\n\nThe New Rectory\n\nThe first offerings for the new rectory had been noted as far back as 1947, ten years before construction began. Apparently, as soon as all the previous debts had been paid during the Jubilee Year, Father Studziński began gathering funds for the new rectory. The necessity of this project was obvious to him by the fact that the old rectory had long outgrown its needs since its size did not keep pace with the growth of the parish. Thus the fund continued to grow under Father Hładki. He first had to cope with a more urgent need, the renovation of the church. The repairs on the lower church had to be finished, specifically, the stairs and entrance from the street. Then came repairing of the roof, waterproofing the brick, installing storm windows and regilding the crosses on the roof all at the cost of one hundred four thousand dollars. The parish societies, as always, hastened to assist in raising the necessary money. The new and energetic Holy Name Society recognized three thousand dollars profit in its campaign of selling “roof tiles.” This scheme was followed up by “bricks” the following year, and another drawing to raise funds for a chapel in the new rectory. In addition to Bingo, a new means of financial assistance was brought into being in the form of a Booster Club. June, saw a carnival held on the grounds for the new rectory at Humboldt and Broome Streets. The old convent needed to be suitably prepared for use as a temporary rectory, which occurred in April, 1957. The old rectory was razed in May, in spite of a strike caused delay, and the foundation for the new rectory was dug in June. Thus, the carnival was repeated, but this time in the school yard. In September, a Patron cover featured the imposing new rectory, which Father Hładki announced would be finished the following year.\n\nIndeed it was completed by May, 1958, when on the last Sunday an Open House was held. Some eight hundred visitors came in spite of a driving rain. Bishop John Boardman blessed it on June 28th.\n\nFinancial Affairs\n\nAfter the building of the new rectory, Father Hładki turned his attention to the renovation of the other parish buildings. We all know that there is a constant financial outlay required for the upkeep of buildings which, if not made, results in even greater future expenditures. Thus in 1959, the now thirty-year old school needed roof and heating repairs, as well as painting. In 1961, the lower church was painted and electrically rewired. In 1962, kneelers in the upper church were replaced and the murals were restored from the damage caused by the heat, candles, and votive lights. To prolong the life of these art works, the electric votive lights were installed.\n\nHis Excellency, Bishop Thomas Molloy, after shepherding the Diocese of Brooklyn for thirty?five years, died on December 2, 1956. He was replaced in 1957 by Bishop Brian McEntegart, then the rector of Catholic University in Washington, D.C. Long concerned about the needs of Catholic education, the new Bishop launched an extensive fundraising campaign for the building of new diocesan high schools, estimated at thirty?seven million dollars.\n\nEach parish was assigned a quota, ours was one hundred and sixty?five thousand dollars to be collected by the end of 1962. Our parishioners once again responded with generosity and self?sacrifice.\n\nThe Second Fire\n\nAn unfortunate event repeated itself at the end of 1963, just as forty?two years earlier at the end of the year, a fire broke out in the church. This time, however, it was no accident. A rash of fires had been set in churches and other buildings in our neighborhood. We were not to be spared Greenpoint’s misfortune, because on December 10th a fire was discovered in our church. We were fortunate in that the damage was confined largely to the sacristy since the blaze was quickly detected and extinguished by the Fire Department. However, all the vestments and liturgical articles were lost. The people were deeply moved by the tragedy, responded quickly. Through their efforts, the church was restored to its former splendor, complete with all new vestments and liturgical vessels.\n\nThe Parish Greets a New Pastor\n\nAfter nine years of arduous work, Father Hładki was replaced by Father Gothard Krzysteczko, C.M. Father Krzysteczko had worked in China from the time of his ordination in 1936 until 1949 when all missionaries had been expelled from China by the Communist regime. He was then assigned to the mission in Whitestone, and in 1951 transferred to St. Michael’s Church in Derby, Connecticut to serve as an assistant, where he became pastor in 1961. These were difficult times to be a pastor, especially after Vatican II which was working to revitalize the faith, but in so doing, created a need to maintain a balance between the old and the new.\n\nFr. Krzysteczko was assigned to us in February, 1964, and immediately immersed himself in the work of our parish. He especially concerned himself with completing the work on the fire?damaged sacristy.\n\nFather Hładki continued to live and work among us after being relieved of the burdens of his pastoral duties and was honored with a banquet in appreciation for his dedicated efforts on our behalf.\n\nOn Saturday, September 26th, Fr. Hładki passed away suddenly. One of our priests found him sitting in a chair in his room with his head bowed to one side and holding a pencil in his hand as though preparing his sermon for the following day. Ironically, his was the first death in the new rectory which he built.\n\nBishop Krauze\n\nIn the Summer of 1965, our own Missionary, the Most Reverend Ignatius Krauze, C.M., who was also the first Polish Bishop in China and Ordinary of many of our priests, was a guest at our parish. He visited our parish for the first time around 1937, when he was here as an Apostolic Prefect before becoming a Bishop. He sought help in the United States for his missions in China. Our parish gave generously, as always.\n\nWhen the communists expelled all the Missionaries from China, the Bishop returned and remained in Whitestone from 1948 to 1952 and visited us several times. He also stayed with us in 1957 when the assistant to the Superior General from Paris, the Reverend Wacław Knapik, C.M., visited our parish. He returned on his way to the Vatican Council in Rome. In 1969 Reverend Krauze celebrated his Fiftieth Jubilee as a priest and his Twenty?fifth as a Bishop in Brazil where he has been stationed since 1952. He visited us again, spoke at a meeting of the Holy Name Society, and then in 1971 was invited to a parish in Utica, New York that was also celebrating its Diamond Jubilee. Once again he returned to participate in our celebrations.\n\n1966?Millennium of Poland’s Christianity\n\nA Jubilee Committee was formed in New York in December, 1964, composed of prominent leaders and priests from the Dioceses of New York, Brooklyn, and Rockville Centre, of which the late Cardinal Spellman was honorary chairman. Our local Jubilee Committee was organized on November 29, 1965. During the first nine Saturdays, from January 1st to September 3rd, a Millennium Novena was conducted. Responsibility for the attendance at the novena devotions was assigned to the Societies to serve as an example by their presence. To further deepen the religious feeling of the Millennium, a Mission was held from March 20th to April 3rd, the first week in Polish and the second in English. During the Triduum, on the last of the three days of the Millennium, a religious celebration was held at St.Patrick’s Cathedral in New York. It was attended by our Polonia from New York and vicinity, all of which received Holy Communion. A special copy of the Patron, edited on Easter Sunday, was devoted to the Millennium. The second Sunday after Easter, April 24th, was dedicated to the Millennium Celebration with a Solemn High Mass celebrated by Father F. Romanowski with a sermon delivered by Reverend. Fus, J.C.D. The latter part was concluded with a program presented to a full audience at 4 p.m. Once again, our St.Cecilia Choir and the Dramatic Circle participated. On this day, during the celebration, the Reverend Francis Myszka, C.M., Provincial Visitor of our Vincentian Fathers, honored us with his presence, arriving from Cracow a few days before to visit our mission houses.\n\nThe week of September 18th to 25th was one in which all of our Brooklyn Diocese officially celebrated our Millennium. The Most Rev. Bishop Władysław Rubin, Protector of Polonia outside of the Polish boundaries came from Rome, representing His Eminence Stefan Cardinal Wyszyński. He arrived in our parish on Thursday, September 22nd, and after a short devotion spoke to those present in Polish and English. He departed shortly in order to visit our neighboring parish, Sts. Cyril and Methodius. He celebrated the main Thanksgiving Services in the evening at the St. James Pro?Cathedral in Brooklyn in the presence of the Bishops of the Diocese, clergy, nuns and members of the different Polish parishes.\n\nThe Millennium Jubilee was terminated in our parish January 7, 1968. On this day, our pastor, Father Gothard Krzysteczko blessed the Millennium Plaque. This plaque is engraved with emblems, names of societies, and priests who worked in our parish during this great year. It is the masterpiece of Jan Sowiński.\n\nTwo of our parishioners were ordained and celebrated their first Solemn High Mass in our church during 1966. Father Robert Kujawa, C.M., celebrated his Mass on the last Sunday of May, 1966, and Father Robert Czok, on the first Sunday of June. The sermon during his Mass was delivered by the Rev. Professor Zdzisław Peszkowski from the Polish Seminary in Orchard Lake, Michigan, where Father Czok studied.\n\nOn the feast of Christ The King we were visited by the Most Reverend Bishop Piotr Filipak, Bishop Ordinary of a Diocese in Brazil. His Diocese in Brazil is huge, priests are few, and supplies and help are insufficient. After delivering all of the sermons on the day of his visit, the Bishop thanked the parishioners for their generous contributions.\n\nDuring the summer of 1968, the restoration of the lower church began; the cost was over one hundred thousand dollars.\n\nOn the last day of September, our former Ordinary, Archbishop Bryan McEntegart passed away. His successor was the Most Reverend Bishop Francis John Mugavero.\n\nThe Four Hundredth Anniversary of the Death of St. Stanislaus Kostka was observed on the feast day of St. Stanislaus and was preceded by the Forty Hour Devotions.\n\nIn November of 1968 we were visited by our Bishop, who concelebrated a Mass in the evening and graciously received and met the nuns and parishioners in the parish hall. Later in a letter to Our Reverend Pastor, Father Gothard Krzysteczko, he thanked him and everyone for welcoming him so cordially.\n\nPreparations were made to organize a Parish Council and its first meeting was held on March 28, 1969. The Council was to have an embodiment of thirty members ( four ex?officio and twenty?six elected members). The members of the parish and societies voted to select this council.\n\nIn May, the Polish Veterans in Exile, the General Sosnkowski Post No., together with the Veterans from George Washington Post No.observed the Twenty?fifth Anniversary of the Battle of Monte Cassino. A Mass was offered for the deceased and wreaths were placed at various monuments.\n\nFather Stephen Pujdak, from the Order of The Sacred Heart, who is our parishioner celebrated his first Solemn Mass in sign language in our church so that his deaf?mute parents were able to participate better at the Mass on September 7th.\n\nA Distinguished Guest\n\nKarol Cardinal Wojtyła, Archbishop of Cracow, our most distinguished guest, arrived at our parish on September 29, 1969. He was able to spend barely five or six hours with us. Our parish was chosen to greet His Eminence with his entourage. He arrived from Doylestown, Pennsylvania, assisted by priests and Polish Bishops ? Bishop A. Abramowicz from Chicago and Bishop Szczepan Wesoły from Rome. In addition to the clergy, Bishop Mugavero and other Bishops from our Brooklyn Diocese greeted His Eminence. After introductions, mutual greetings and dinner, all went to church to attend and celebrate Mass. Cardinal Wojtyła then concelebrated the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass with the Polish Bishops and with six Polish priests. During Mass, our pastor the Reverend G. Krzysteczko, welcomed everyone, and our ordinary greeted the Cardinal. At the end, the Cardinal addressed the congregation in both Polish and English. After Mass, he met with parishioners and nuns.\n\nOur Seventy?Fifth Jubilee\n\nOur Diamond Jubilee was first mentioned at the Parish Council Meeting held on December 12, 1969. At the beginning of 1970, volunteers were invited along with the delegates of our societies to form a Jubilee Committee. In December, the Pastor Gothard Krzysteczko announced the goals to be achieved during this time, namely; renewal of faith through a Mission; organizing church celebrations and artistic presentations; and renovation of the sanctuary with a new altar and Communion railings.\n\nThe first important event of the Jubilee was a religious concert, which took place in our church on Palm Sunday. Organized by Father Francis Kellner, it was a great success and was favorably accepted by the press.\n\nThe last change in the liturgy was made on Palm Sunday 1970. The whole Mass is to be said in the vernacular. All the daily masses are to be celebrated in Polish with the exception of the 8 o’clock Mass which is the children’s Mass. Most Sunday Masses are said in Polish. Sunday 9 o’clock Mass, three Masses in the lower church and the Saturday and Sunday Evening Mass are said in English.\n\nRenovation Of The Sanctuary\n\nThe first matter proposed in conjunction with the Jubilee was the renovation of the sanctuary. Work was started on July 12, 1971 and continued for a month. All Masses, Sunday and daily, were held in the lower church. The Sanctuary and the new marble altar now projected simplicity and beauty. The Communion railings were lowered. This eliminated walking up a few steps to receive Holy Communion. The cost of this renovation was thirty thousand dollars.\n\nMost Reverend Bishop Albin Malysiak\n\nThe coming preparation for the main day of the Jubilee which occurred on December 5, 1971, was a weekly novena held for nine Thursdays followed by the regular nine day novena. The first novena began September 30th and ended November 25th. It was conducted in Polish by our Vincentians from Whitestone. The regular novena began November 19th, and ended November 27th. It was conducted in English by Father John Kowalski, C.M. and in Polish by Bishop Malysiak, C.M.\n\nBishop Malysiak, our own Missionary, is Auxiliary to Karol Cardinal Wojtyła, Archbishop of Cracow. Before becoming a bishop he was pastor of a large Vincentian Parish in Cracow. He accepted our invitation and celebrated the aforementioned novena and High Mass on the Jubilee Sunday. During this time, Bishop Malysiak visited numerous Polish parishes and organizations among Polonia in the United States and Canada. He returned to Cracow in January of 1972.\n\nWelcome Long Awaited Day\n\nThe day of the Diamond Jubilee of our Parish was honored with the presence of three bishops and three solemn celebrations, which began with the 9 o’clock Mass for the children. Bishop Krauze concelebrated the Mass with Father Chester Mrówka, C.M., and Father Edmund Gutowski, C.M., who delivered the sermon. During the Mass the children sang Polish and English hymns.\n\nThe main celebration? High Mass – with a greeting by Reverend Krzysteczko, was said in Polish at 11:00 a.m.\n\nBishop Malysiak concelebrated this Mass with Father Walter Ziemba, D.D., our visitor, the Reverend Henry Sawicki, C.M., Father Walenty Pieczka, our superior; Father Gothard Krzysteczko, our pastor; Father Karol Wawak, Father Kazimierz Szymanski, Father John Kowalski, and Father Edmund Kowalski, Father Ziemba delivered the sermon in Polish.\n\nPresent in the sanctuary was Father Edward Fus, J.C.D., representing the bishop from Brooklyn. Our St. Cecilia’s Choir sang a Polish Mass, while the congregation and newly organized boys’ choir sang the hymns. Also present were numerous clergy, about one hundred and twenty nuns and over eleven hundred people.\n\nMost Rev. Bishop Francis J. Mugavero was the main celebrant at the 4 p.m. Mass. The concelebrants were: Reverend Gothard Krzysteczko, C.M., Reverend Edmund Gutowski, C.M., Reverend Henry Sawicki, C.M., Reverend Edward V. Rutowski, C.M., Reverend Edward P. Spurgiasz, C.M., Reverend Robert W. Czok. Seated in the sanctuary were: Bishop Ignatius Krauze, C.M., and Bishop Albin Malysiak, C.M. Reverend Leon Baltrucki, pastor of Sts. Cyril and Methodius Church in Greenpoint delivered the sermon. About fifty priests, one hundred nuns and one thousand people participated. Both Jubilee celebrations ended with the American and Polish Anthems.\n\nOther notable events were a reception for the Priests and Sisters, separate of course, during which the parishioners were able to meet with them and discuss old ties and memories.\n\nThe commemoration of the Jubilee continued into 1972 with recitals by the Church Choirs at a “Polish Day” in McGoldrick Park on June 11, 1972.\n\nThere were also two banquets. One in English at Rovnak’s Princess Manor on a Saturday evening and the other on a Sunday afternoon, in Polish, in the Parish Hall.\n\nFather Krzysteczko, on termination of his tenure as Pastor in 1973, was transferred to the Mission House in Utica, N.Y. There in addition to his priestly duties, he maintained a large vegetable garden and managed an extensive bee colony. He passed away suddenly on July 9, 1990. He was buried in his beloved St. Michael’s Cemetery, Derby, Connecticut, where he labored extensively as its caretaker.\n\n1973 to 1982\n\nOn February 18, 1973 Reverend Józef Szpilski became the first in a series of Pastors relatively new from Poland, more sensitive to the mentality and heritage of the Solidarity?oriented Polish immigrant.\n\nHe was born on March 12, 1933, of Andrzej Szpilski and Janina Kiraga, in Wojsławice, Kuczki Parish, Diocese of Sandomierz. He received his secondary schooling in Random and the Vincentian Minor Seminary in Krakow. He was affiliated with the Vincentians on September 27, 1950, and pronounced his vows on October 5, 1955. He completed his seminary training at the Vincentian Theological Institute, Stradom, Kraków, where he was ordained by Auxiliary Bishop Stanisław Rospond on June 24, 1956.\n\nAs a parochial vicar at Holy Cross Parish, Warsaw, Poland (1956-62), he studied at the Catholic Theological Academy. Between 1962 and 1964, he was a parochial vicar and catechism teacher in the Vincentian parish at Zagan, Poland.\n\nHe arrived in the United States in 1964. After studying English in Washington, D.C., he conducted missions in Erie, Pennsylvania (1965-1969) and Whitestone, New York (1969?1973). When he assumed the duties of pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostka, he immediately arranged a celebration for the 500th Anniversary of the birth of the world-famous Polish astronomer Copernicus.\n\nHe introduced annual retreats for the parishioners; hosted distinguished Polish bishops who came to the International Eucharistic Congress in Philadelphia (1976); prepared a Brooklyn celebration of the installation of Pope John Paul II (October 29, 1978) which culminated in naming the area in front of the church Pope John Paul II Square; and on May 17, 1981, observed his own Silver Jubilee of Priesthood. In 1978, the “Polish American World“, named him “Citizen of the Year“.\n\nDuring the Pastorship of Father Szpilski, not unlike those who preceded him, he was plagued with the constant maintenance, repair and renovation of Church properties. The main organ had to be refurbished at a cost of over $100,000, both spires needed painting at a cost of over $50,000 and repairs to the upper and lower church were made at a cost of over $21,000. Some renovation was done in the Convent and “Old School”. In Addition, the staircases in the new school were repaired at a cost of about $13,000 and the windows replaced, costing approximately $60,000.\n\nLooking to the future Father Szpilski was able to procure two dwellings. One on Newell St. which enlarged the school yard and the other on Broome St. The latter remains a dwelling.\n\nThe Firsts\n\nDuring Father Szpilski’s Pastorship there were several innovations that need to be mentioned.\n\nHe introduced the practice of instruction sessions for parents of the First Holy Communicants. They met in two groups, one in Polish and one in English, and their attendance was compulsory. The practice continues to date.\n\nIn 1977, with Father Szpilski’s cooperation and blessing, the St.Cecilia Choir cut its first record “Pasterka” which proved to be a financial success.\n\nIn 1979, he led a pilgrimage to Rome in which 100 participated and met with the Holy Father John Paul.\n\nBecause of the large number of participants at the Christmas Midnight Mass, Father Studziński, in 1940, requested the members of the Children of Mary Society not to attend due to lack of space. In 1946 there were two Midnight Masses, one in the Upper Church and one in the Lower Church. In 1970, Father Krzysteczko introduced a midnight mass in Polish in the upper church and in English in the lower church. The crowds continued. To alleviate the problem somewhat, Father Szpilski added the 10 p.m. Shepherd’s Mass in Polish in the upper church. Today there is also a 10 p.m. Shepherd’s Mass in the lower church in English.\n\nDuring his Pastorship the Athletic League was formed. At first for boys then later, also for girls. The sports played were primarily basketball and volleyball. Practice sessions are still held in the “Old School” and the teams participate in the Diocesan League competition.\n\nWhen Father Szpilski’s term as Pastor ended, July 7, 1982, he was transferred to the Mission Group in Whitestone where he continued contributing socio?religious articles to the Polish American Journal, Głos and Nowy Dziennik. In January of 1992 until September 1994, he served as a Parochial Vicar again at St. Stanislaus Kostka. He is presently at Ansonia, Connecticut.\n\n1982-1988\n\nRev. Walenty Pieczka, C.M. was Pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostka from July 7, 1982 to August 31, 1988. This long-standing parochial vicar at St. Stanislaus Kostka was the fifth pastor to come from Sląsk (Silesia). He was born in Brzezce, Diocese of Wrocław (now Katowice) on the vigil of the first anniversary of Polish Independence, November 10, 1919. He completed the local elementary school and attended the Vincentian Minor Seminary in Krakow. On December 8, 1937, he joined the Vincentian Community on November 11, 1935 and pronounced his vows after his novitiate in Wilno. After his theological studies in Krakow he was ordained by Bishop Jan Lorek, C.M., on July 18, 1943.\n\nHis first pastoral assignments were in the Diocese of Kielce, then Krakow, later Warszawa at Holy Cross parish, and again in Krakow. From September 1947, as a young priest, he administered St. Joseph’s Parish in Wrocław for one year.\n\nHe arrived in the United States on Memorial Day, 1959, and resided at St. Stanislaus Kostka as a student of English, and became a parochial vicar there in 1964. On December 30, 1966, he became the Superior of the Brooklyn House and Provincial Procurator of the Polish Vice Province.\n\nOn June 3, 1982, Bishop Mugavero appointed him pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostka and he assumed his new duties July 7, 1982. Experienced in pastoral work, Fr. Pieczka promoted spiritual life among the parishioners conscientiously, supervised the parochial school, and extended his paternal ministry to the increasing Solidarity Era Polish immigrants.\n\nThe neverending care and conservation of church properties continues. In 1983, Father Pieczka undertook the renovation of the Sanctuary. The altar and murals were retouched and several statutes were repainted. A likeness of St. Maximilian Kolbe was incorporated into the mural by the altar. He also had the main organ reconstructed and built up to its full capacity. The process required two years to complete at a cost of over $80,000.\n\nDuring Father Pieczka’s tenure as Pastor, two new organizations were formed, the Living Rosary and the Golden Age Club. The “Living Rosary” is a reorganization of the Rosary Society. It is strictly a prayer group for both men and women without any fees or dues.\n\nThe Golden Age Club was organized on Feb., 1984 with the aim to give an occasion for meeting and socializing. One must be at least 50 years of age to become a member.\n\nIn 1986, as part of the Diocesan overall plan, Father Pieczka initiated a program to aid the illegal Polish immigrant to obtain legal status. Called the Amnesty Program, certain eligible aliens without status were able to secure work permits, then Green Cards and eventually United States Citizenship.\n\nAn offshoot of this program was the establishment of English as a Second Language Agenda. English classes for adults began in January of 1988 and continue to date.\n\nPopiełuszko Square\n\nThrough the efforts of Greenpoint Polonians, on October 19, 1986, a square in honor of Father Jerzy Popiełuszko of Warsaw was dedicated after a Mass at St. Stanislaus Kostka. Martyred for the Solidarity cause, the popular Polish priest was extolled at the unveiling on Bedford Avenue. The bust was later vandalized then restored.\n\nFather Pieczka relinquished his duties to his successor on August 31, 1988, and after a short stay at St. Joseph’s in Ansonia, he was then assigned to St. Stanislaus Kostka and Martyr Parish in New Haven and is presently in Derby, Connecticut.\n\n1988-1992\n\nThe first Pastor from Poland’s northeast region, Father Stanisław Staniszewski, C.M., inherited the office of Pastor on September 1, 1988. He was born October 26, 1937 in the village of Abramy, Piski Parish, Diocese of £omża. After completing the local elementary school (June 24, 1952), he entered the Salesian Minor Seminary in Rozanystok and when it was closed by Communist authorities in 1954, he completed the studies in Warsaw June 23, 1956. He entered the community of the Vincentian Fathers on October 7, 1956, pronounced his vows on June28, 1962, and was ordained on June 23, 1963, by Bishop Karol Wojtyła, Pope John Paul II.\n\nHe received his pastoral experience in Poland in several places. He was a parochial vicar in Odporyszow, Diocese of Tarnów (1963-64); in Trzciel, Diocese of Gorzow (1964-65); and Grodkow, Diocese of Opole (1965-69). On November 24, 1969, he arrived in the United States and studied English at St.Michael’s College, in Winooski, Vermont. From December 29, 1970 until September of 1972, he worked at St. Michael’s Parish, Derby, Connecticut. He followed this with a course in English at Georgetown University, Washington, D.C. From February 15, 1973, until 1976 he was a parochial vicar at St. Stanislaus Kostka, Brooklyn; a teacher at St. John Kanty Prep, Erie, Pennsylvania, for a year (1976-77); a member of the mission group at Whitestone, N.Y. (1977-78); again retur ning to St. Michael’s at Derby, Connecticut (1978-82); and became superior of the Mission House in Utica, New York (1982-88). In 1987, he took a course at the Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium.\n\nOn Aug., 1988, he was appointed pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish, Brooklyn, by Bishop Mugavero and on September 1, 1988, he assumed his responsibilities.\n\nNot to be repetitive but, Father soon had to make extensive renovation to both the upper and lower churches and the new school basement.\n\nA jolly and likable individual, Father stayed with us as Pastor for less than four years. However, during his tenure several happenings did occur.\n\nIn July of 1989 a small group of former Oaza (Oasis) members approached Fr. Staniszewski asking permission to establish a local group. He entrusted the group to Father Roman Górowski. These small basic Christian Communities arose in Poland during the 1980’s. Composed of young adults, their desire is to increase their spiritual and religious lives.\n\nEarly in 1990, Father Staniszewski expressed a wish for organized singing at the 10 a.m. English Mass. Father Górowski was assigned the task and on June 20, 1990 the new ensemble was formed, for a trial period, as a summer choir. They are performing year round to date.\n\nIn 1991, he introduced the tithing concept for the Sunday collection.\n\nOn June 24, 1992, the PSA (Parish and School Association) was formed.\n\nLech Wałęsa\n\nThe third prestigious visitor to the Parish was Lech Wałęsa, the President of Poland. Together with his wife, Danuta, he came for private prayer at Mass on Shrove Tuesday, March 26, 1991. It was to be a low?key unannounced visit but rumors of it brought a capacity crowd to the 7 a.m. Mass. No one spoke to him nor he to anyone. Privately, he promised to return for a formal visit.\n\nCardinal Glemp\n\nOn Saturday, September 21, 1991. Cardinal Józef Glemp, Primate of Poland, celebrated Mass at St. Stanislaus Kostka. It was part of a tour to meet with Polish communities throughout the United States. He came to bring greetings from the home country in a spirit of unity.\n\nOn July 10, 1992, on a routine assignment, Fr. Staniszewski was assigned to the St. Joseph’s Parish, Ansonia, Connecticut and is now in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nRev. Roman Górowski, C.M.\n\nFather Roman Górowski, C.M. was born in Tarnów on July 2, 1945. Accepted into the Vincentian Community November 3, 1966, he was ordained a priest June 17, 1972. He succeeded Father Mietelski as director of the “schola” singers at St. Vincent de Paul Church, Bydgoszcz. In 1974, he went to Grodkow for two years.\n\nAssigned to the United States, Father Roman Górowski first studied English at Temple University, Philadelphia from 1976-77, and until 1982 remained as vicar at New Haven.\n\nAt Derby, Connecticut in 1982, Father Górowski was the Director of the parish school, where he organized afternoon classes for Polish?Americans to learn Polish (40 in three groups), and introduced Jaselka (Christmas Plays). In July of 1986, Father Górowski returned to Poland for an assignment, but returned in two years to be vicar at St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish in Brooklyn, Superior of the House in 1991 and Pastor July 10, 1992.\n\nWhen Father Górowski took over as Pastor there were still some repairs not completed during Father Staniszewski’s Pastorship. Once they were out of the way, Father Górowski undertook an extensive restoration of St. Stanislaus Kostka Church in preparation for the many celebrations to be held in connection with the Parish’s 100th Anniversary.\n\nFr. Roman Górowski painstakingly reviewed all suggested plans and encouraged parish members to voice their opinion. Work was completed in the Summer of 1994.\n\nIn addition to the Church, most other buildings also required attention. The new school received new waste lines, a new basement floor, new windows and lavatories. The “Old School” was resurfaced and had its windows replaced. The Convent had its washrooms redone and new bedding installed while the “Old Convent” had the upper two floors completely renovated. The Rectory office and waiting room were reconstructed and the building received a new air conditioning system.\n\nMuch work still needs to be done. The two remaining floors of the “Old Convent” need to be refurbished and the sidewalks surrounding the Rectory and extending to Newell Street must be replaced.\n\nNotwithstanding, the energies expended toward renovation, Father Górowski has never overlooked his role as Spiritual Leader of the Flock. In addition, he continued to oversee the Oaza Group and initiated retreats and a special monthly mass for members of the Athletic League. He attended weekend retreats with the young people and even took a group of them to see the Pope in Denver, Colorado.\n\nMuch to the delight of the young ladies in the Parish, Father Górowski instructed them toward becoming altar servers. A good number of girls responded after the Bishop gave permission.\n\nIn October of 1992, the Parishioners witnessed the ordination of Rev. Mieczysław Krupa by Auxiliary Bishop Rene Valero.\n\nOctober 1992 also marked the First Blessing of Animals (Feast of St. Francis of Assisi) in our Parish.\n\nNot wanting to have the historic milestone of the 100th Anniversary of the founding of our Parish and School go unnoticed or to perform the arrangements at the last minute, Father Roman Górowski, formed a Centennial Committee to assist in the planning of the celebrations to be held. Several Committees have been formed and they have already organized events.\n\nBeing a Pastor of such a large parish with the special needs of immigrants to be considered is an awesome task under normal circumstances. With the approaching Anniversary, it becomes so much greater and fortunately, Father Roman Górowski is handling it extremely well.\n\nCentennial of Our Parish and School\n\nThe Centennial of the Parish and School was preceded by many special preparations both materialistic and spiritual. On the material side, our Church was renovated by the company D’Ambrosio Ecclesiastical Art Studios, Inc. Our old school building was completely renovated externally. Thanks to the generosity of Parishioners and Friends of St. Stanislaus Kostka Church, we were able to collect and still are collecting funds to help pay for these renovations. The decision to renovate the Church, replace the pews in the Church, relocate the pulpit and to replace the sound system in the upper and lower church, was preceded by many discussions with parishioners. It must be emphasized, that the joint efforts of the parishioners and Fr. Pastor Roman Gorowski were very positive. The Church and school buildings were renovated just in time so that in November 1995 we could begin the most important task of the Centennial spiritual preparation.\n\nThe Centennial Program is very rich in events. It is continuing throughout the year. Committees were formed to handle the preparations for the particular celebrations and events: the Liturgical Committee, Social Committee, Banquet Committee and the Journal Committee. Before this Journal was sent to print, the following events took place.\n\nPrior to the opening of the Centennial Celebrations on the first Sunday of Advent, on December 3, 1995, a Parish Mission began in both English and Polish. The English Missions were conducted by the Passionist Fathers and the Polish Mission was conducted by Fr. Jan Kowalik and Fr. Tadeusz Maciejewski. Thousands of people participated in this Mission, and the majority of the faithful availed themselves of Confession and received Holy Communion. Both Missions were concluded on Thursday with the Blessing of the Mission Cross. On Friday, during the Feast of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, our Parish was given into the care of our Blessed Mother at each Mass. At the evening Mass, this act was carried out by His Excellency Archbishop Tadeusz Goclowski, C.M., from the Archdiocese of Gdańsk in Poland.\n\nThe main ceremonies opening our Centennial took place on Sunday, December 10, 1995. On this day, two Masses were celebrated. The main celebrant and homilist at the Polish Mass was His Excellency Archbishop Tadeusz Gocłowski. Our Parish Choir, the St. Cecelia Choir, under the direction of Mr. John Bartosiewicz and the accompaniment of Mrs. Halina Kalitka, sang at this Ceremony. Other participants were Father Chester Mrowka, Provincial of the Congregation of the Mission of the New England Province, as well as many other Priests from the Congregation of St. Vincent DePaul. The second Mass in English was celebrated by His Excellency Bishop Thomas Daily, Bishop of the Brooklyn Diocese. The Word of God, in Polish, was preached by Archbishop Tadeusz Goclowski and, in English, by the Provincial of the New England Province, Fr. Chester Mrowka. Other participants included 45 Priests from both the Congregation of the Mission and the Diocese. During the English Mass, our Choral Group sang under the direction of Ms. Krystyna Gutt and the accompaniment of Mr. Adam Mikula along with our Parish’s Children’s Choir under the Direction of Mr. Adam Mikula. The Church was decorated both internally and externally for these ceremonies. Thousands of parishioners and friends of our Parish participated. After the Mass, Parishioners, Bishops, Priests and Sisters gathered in the new school auditorium for cake and coffee, which was beautifully prepared by the Social Committee with the financial assistance of Mr. John Czaplinski.\n\nThe next celebration took place on the Feast of the Conversion of St. Paul on January 25, 1996. This was the Day of the Vincentian Fathers. In attendance were Fr. Karol Holubick (Provincial of the Province of Poland), Fr. Chester Mrowka (Provincial of the New England Province, and 25 Priests and Brothers from this Province. A Ceremonial Mass was concelebrated by the Provincial Fathers along with the other attending Fathers. The Polish Homilist was Fr. Karol Holubicki and the English Homilist was Fr. John Sledziona, Member of the Provincial Committee and Pastor of the St. Peter Parish in Concord, NH. Through the attendance of the Polish Provincial Father Karol Holubicki, the ceremony took on a special character, since the connection between both Provinces was not only exhibited but deepened. The Polish Province helps the New England Province by sending priests for pastoral work.\n\nThe main celebration of the Centennial of Saint Stanislaus Kostka School took place on February 4, 1996. The main celebrant and homilist at this Mass was His Excellency Bishop Gerald M. Barbarito, Auxiliary Bishop of the Brooklyn Diocese. The entire ceremony was coordinated by the Principal of our School, Sr. Marita. Priests, Sisters, Faculty Members, Parents, Children and many parishioners took part in these ceremonies. During the Mass, our Children’s Choir sang under the direction of Adam Mikula.\n\nOn Sunday, February 25, the Parish and School Association organized its third annual International Day with the theme being the Birthday of our Parish and School. An auditorium, beautifully decorated by by the Parish and School Association with much help from Mr. John Czaplinski, greeted a huge crowd of Parishioners. During this event, many children performed a special Centennial program prepared under the direction of Sr. Marita and Mr. Adam Mikula. Much of the success of this event was due to the great dedication of the Parish and School Association under the Direction of the President, Mr. George Cząstkiewicz.\n\nDuring the month of March (The Lenten Season) the Parish experienced a time of prayer, alms and fasting. The only event at this time was the Retreat. In English, the Retreat was conducted by the Franciscan Missionaries. This was an especially beautiful Retreat, in which a few hundred English-speaking parishioners participated. The Retreat in Polish, conducted by a Missionary from Poland, Fr. Wojciech Kozłowski, Director of Missions in Warsaw. Fr. Wojciech (a young Priest with a big heart and tremendous energy) conducted this Mission splendidly. For all parishioners this was a tremendous experience and a spiritual renewal.\n\nA very important part of our Centennial celebrations was a gathering of the Alumni of our School. This event took place on April 21, 1996. A special Mass was celebrated by His Excellency Bishop Joseph Sullivan, Auxiliary Bishop of the Diocese of Brooklyn. The Word of God was preached by Fr. Edmund Gutowski, C.M., who was a native of this Parish and was a student of our School. After Mass, there was a get-together at the Parish School Auditorium, and everyone was invited to visit the classrooms that the Alumni attended between 1 year and 50 years earlier. This was a wonderful gathering of the past students of our School.\n\nDuring the month of April we saw 129 students receive the Sacrament of Confirmation and in May 105 children receive First Holy Communion.\n\nOn May 5, we had the Annual “Krakowianki and Gorale” Spring Show. The theme of their performance was the Parish Centennial. A beautiful performance was seen by a full auditorium. After the show, there was a special celebration.\n\nOn Sunday, May 19, the Athletic League of our Parish held their Centennial Awards Dinner under the direction of the President, Frank Carbone. During this celebration, awards were given out to the athletes. The Athletic League currently has a membership of about 350 children and young adults.\n\nOn Wednesday, May 22, we hosted at our Church the former President of Poland, Mr. Lech Wałęsa. He participated in a concelebrated Mass, with the principal celebrant being our Pastor, Father Roman Górowski. Many Polish dignitaries participated in this celebration of the Mass along with the faithful, numbering in the thousands.\n\nAt the conclusion, President Wałęsa spoke urging optimism on matters concerning Poland.\n\nParticularly festive and joyous was the parish picnic, which took place on Sunday, June 2, 1996. Hundreds of Parishioners, young adults and children participated. The picnic was sponsored by the Parish and School Association under the direction of the President, Mr. George Cząstkiewicz. This was a splendid day for all, exhibiting unity within Polonia.\n\nCorpus Christi on Sunday, June 9 displayed a special character with a Special Concelebrated Mass at which the Principal Celebrant was our Pastor, Fr. Roman Górowski. Thousands of faithful participants processed along streets to four altars set up outside the Church. The homily was preached by Father Rafał Kopystynski, a vicar of our Parish. The procession consisted of Parish Organizations, the Living Rosary, altar servers, First Holy Communion children, school children, Krakowianki & Gorale, Members of the SPK in Army Uniforms, and our Parish’s St. Cecelia Choir. The altars eminated Christ’s presence throughout the 100-year existence of our Parish and School.\n\nThe Centennial Pilgrimage to Rome and Poland took place from June 26 through July 8 under the leadership of Fr. Pastor Roman Górowski and Fr. Rafal Kopystynski. In Rome, the group participated in a Mass celebrated by the Holy Father John Paul II on the day of the feast of the Apostles, Sts. Peter and Paul. The group also was given the opportunity for a private audience with the Pope on Sunday evening, June 30. This was an unbelievable experience for all participants of the pilgrimage. In Poland, the most important moment was attending Mass at the Church of Our Lady of Czestochowa on Jasna Góra. The entire group stood with tears in their eyes, directly, in front of the Altar. There we thanked our Blessed Mother for all the graces which our Parish received during these 100 years. We prayed for blessings for all parishioners, for our children and our youth. The entire pilgrimage went very well and everyone was very satisfied.\n\nSince the Centennial Journal will soon go to print, we will conclude this sequence of events with one which is currently in progress, the bicycle trip across the United States. A group of young adults from our Athletic League are riding on bicycles almost 3,500 miles across the United States in two months, July and August 1996. This is a Centennial event under the theme of “Bike for Life `96”. This extraordinary event was headed by the President of our St. Stan’s Athletic League, Frank Carbone. Our Parish will be welcoming them back from this journey on Thursday, August 29, 1996.\n\nEvents still to come: Sunday, September 22 – Family Day, a joint prayer meeting of the families of the Parish; Sunday, October 20 – Mass of Thanksgiving and Centennial Banquet at Terrace on the Park; November 10,11,12 – 40 Hour Eucharistic Devotion in honor of our Patron, St. Stanislaus Kostka; Sunday, November 17 – 100th Anniversary of the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth working at our Parish School; On Sunday, December 1, the conclusion of the Centennial Celebrations with the participation of the Bishop of the Brooklyn Diocese, Bishop Thomas Daily. This will be a ceremonial display of thanks to God while we all sing out with joy. —TE DEUM — PRAISE BE TO GOD!!\n\nWeekly Parish Publication\n\nThe original idea of a parish publication was conceived by the Reverend Pastor Joseph Studziński. It was his decision that launched the publication of a parish newsletter.\n\nMeanwhile, Rev. Bolesław Bielski, C.M., the man who was to become the first editor had been working at St. Stanislaus for over a year. He was a young, alert, energetic, native parishioner, who had much in common with the youth, its spirit, and language; and was associated with the alumni of our school in the capacity of moderator. This newsletter was to serve as a medium of communication; it was to transmit significant information, not only to the alumni about activities related to them, but also to the parish as a whole. Since the alumni assumed the major role in formulating the Patron, it was logical that the first issues were primarily concerned with their activities.\n\nWith time, the Patron changed its character from a purely alumni to a parish publication. Only the most experienced alumni remained with its first editor. They were joined by other contributors, some of whom were clergy, and others were parishioners.\n\nOn June 12, 1944, Reverend Bielski (editor), received an official notification of his assignment to St. John Kanty College in Erie, Pennsylvania as an instructor of the English Language.\n\nIn the issue of June 18, 1944 was the following notice: “Reverend Karol Wawak, new editor of the Patron”. Father Wawak arrived at this parish from St. Joseph’s, Ansonia, Connecticut, a complete stranger to the parishioners.\n\nThanks to Mother Superior Alphonsilla, “Mother Patron” and later Sister Josephine Marie, an involvement with the school and its events were incorporated into the Patron. Through her consistent efforts, during her administration and later, there was always a Sister on the faculty staff responsible for transmitting information on school personalia and submitting numerous interesting articles in English. Articles relating to religion, patriotism, and other significant parish activities were a major portion of the Patron and were handled personally by the Reverend editor.\n\nOutstanding original articles were offered by Reverend Adalbert Kranc, C.M. In the early part of 1949, Reverend Wawak was forced to discontinue his work as editor due to illness. For about six months, he showed the new editor all phases of the journalistic workings of the Patron.\n\nIn 1949, Father Kranc assumed editorship of the Patron. He possessed a keen sense of observation and had an ability to narrate experiences.\n\nFr. Kranc, from the beginning of his editorship, performed with maximum devotion and dedication and marked The Patron with qualities of logic, conscientiousness and diligence. Upon his arrival in the United States, he served as a professor for many years at St. John Kanty College in Erie, Pennsylvania. In 1937, doctors diagnosed his illness as possible tuberculosis. Undergoing a cure, first in Poland and later in Texas, Father Kranc finally overcame his illness. He displayed a great talent as financial organizer while working on the Patron. Not only did he introduce a system of first class advertisement, but he also established within the Patron something in the nature of a shop. This was a fundraising device, whose income at more than one time aided the publication in its days of dire financial need.\n\nReverend Kranc succumbed to heart failure on Wednesday, July 24, 1957. When the news reached Reverend Wawak, he edited the next issue, and included a biography. At the request of his superiors, Father Wawak resumed the editorship of the Patron after an interval of eight years.\n\nIn the year 1966, commemorating the Millennium of Polish Christianity, the Patron observed its twenty?fifth anniversary. It is with just pride that the Patron could boast of its continued existence among its Polish sponsors, especially since a great number of Polish publications went out of existence.\n\nThe Patron often encountered many difficulties due to circumstances, time, and in spite of the efforts of its contributors. Therefore, the issue of August 1, 1971, was the last issue edited by Reverend Wawak.\n\nRising printing costs continued to plague the Patron to such an extent that in 1943 the Parish had to subsidize its publication. In 1949 the Subsidy rose to $6,000. Financial appeals, special collections and the reduction in number of pages did not alleviate the situation.\n\nOn August 1, 1971 the Rev. Edward Spurgiasz became the editor. He increased the subscription rate, decreased the number of pages and allowed a private printing company to use the photo offset method to print the weekly publication for the price of advertisements collected by the Company.\n\nIn 1978 the format was changed becoming more of a parish bulletin than a magazine. The Parish now receives a percentage of the Advertising Revenue.\n\nThe Vincentian Fathers\n\nThe Congregation of the Mission known also as the Vincentians Fathers has served St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish in Brooklyn, New York for close to seventy-five years.\n\nThe Founder of this group of priests and brothers was St. Vincent de Paul. He was born in France in 1580 and died in 1660. In 1625, this Holy Man organized a new religious community with the help of a group of diocesan clergy. It was officially called the Congregation of the Mission and its motto was and still is, “The Lord has sent me to preach the good news to the poor”.\n\nIt all began by preaching home-missions to the poor country people. Slowly, it was necessary to give retreats to those who would be ordained as priests. Spiritual days of recollection were preached to the diocesan clergy. From there, this group of priests became chaplains to the prisoners on galley ships of the king of France. Vincentians were sent to various countries of Europe as well as other foreign missions. The congregation grew and a community of sisters, The Daughters of Charity, was formed to take care of the sick in hospitals and the orphaned. The Ladies of Charity assisted St. Vincent and his Sisters, materially and financially. God blessed the good work begun by this saintly man.\n\nIn 1651, Vincent de Paul sent his priests and sisters to Poland, a country ravaged by wars, poverty and disease. They established themselves in Warsaw near Holy Cross Church. It was here that the foundation mission of the Vincentian Fathers began in Poland. The Congregation prospered through difficult times as well as good times. Today, the Polish Province is made up of 267 priests and 5 brothers.\n\nIn 1904, the first Vincentians arrived in the United States. They proceeded to found the St. Stanislaus Bishop and Martyr Parish in New Haven, Connecticut, in order to minister to the newly settled Polish immigrants. These hardy Vincentians took root and soon founded a parish in Derby, Connecticut, as well as, several parishes in the Philadelphia area and a school with a preaching group of missionaries in Erie, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1920, a Polish Vice-Province of the Congregation of the Mission was established in New Haven, Connecticut. In 1923, the Bishop of Brooklyn asked the Vincentians to take charge of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, New York. During that same year a Mission House was established in Whitestone, New York. The Priests in residence preached triduums, novenas, parish missions and helped the local clergy with hearing confessions and provided other temporary parish assistance. Another parish located in Ansonia, Connecticut was added to the list of Vincentian Parishes and a Mission House was established in Utica, New York, in 1965.\n\nOn April 23, 1975, this group of Vincentian Priests and Brothers was established as a full self-governing Province and was urged to orient its pastoral efforts towards the New England area.\n\nIn the few years since the beginning of the new Province, a central provincial house had been located in West Hartford, Connecticut and a small parish had been taken on in Lisbon Falls, Maine. In 1983, the Bishop of New Hampshire asked the Vincentians to take over St. Peter’s Parish in Concord, New Hampshire. In 1995, De Paul Provincial Residence was built in Manchester, Connecticut. The priests stationed at Lisbon Falls had been asked by the Bishop to add to their ministry two other parishes that would ultimately be combined into a single parish. In Brooklyn, New York the Local Ordinary requested that the Vincentians take over the parish of Sts. Cyril and Methodius located in the Greenpoint area of Brooklyn.\n\nToday, the poor, the oppressed, and the suffering still require assistance. Many hands reach out to the Vincentian Community for their knowledge, for understanding, for guidance, for love, for healing, and for the joyful presence of Christ. Like St. Vincent de Paul, the men of the New England Province dedicate their lives to the service of God’s people as preachers, parish priests, chaplains and catechists.\n\nIn the New England Province, our “little company” looks forward to the future, consciously determined to make good use of every opportunity given to us by God’s Providence. St. Vincent said: “Do the good that presents itself to be done. I do not say we should go out indiscriminately and take on everything, but rather, things that God lets us know He wants of us. We belong to Him and not to ourselves. If He increases our work, He adds to our strength also.”\n\nSt. Stanislaus Kostka School\n\nTo a Pole, Religion and the Polish language are treasures, that are vital and cherished. This is the picture of the Polish immigrants in Brooklyn. From the beginning they organized and associated themselves with others of their kind, to better keep these traditions. In 1875, they erected their own church, near the Brooklyn Navy Yard and named it, St. Casimir’s. Soon after, they opened a small Polish Catholic School in an empty house on North 7th Street in Williamsburg. The school began in the year 1883 – as noted in the Pamiętnik of St. Casimir’s Parish. From the well-known annual, The Catholic Directory (which offers data on the Catholic Church in America) shows 1887 as the date of the oldest Polish School.\n\nIt was not an eight grade school. In the beginning just thirty students attended, but shortly the enrollment increased to one hundred and twenty-five. The one lay teacher who first taught was soon joined by another. Then, in 1891, the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth arrived and established their home in the Brooklyn Diocese. They settled in South Brooklyn and taught in the little school on North 7th Street. Soon, another Polish School arose, also under the direction of the Sisters of Nazareth. After a lapse of a few years, another church came into existence – the Church and Parish of Our Lady of Częstochowa.\n\nThe Sisters of the Order of The Holy Family of Nazareth were brought to America through the efforts of the pastor of St. Casimir’s Parish, Father Vincent Bronikowski. Four Sisters were in the first group of arrivals. The history of the Sisters of Nazareth began on March 8, 1891. Their activities were part of the histories of many schools associated with Polish Parishes.\n\nOur school – one year older than our parish of St. Stanislaus Kostka – was started on September 8, 1895 with an enrollment of 60 students. After being assigned three Sisters for its management, Father Leon Wysiecki, organizer of two parishes, builder of St. Stanislaus Kostka, and later its first pastor, established the Sisters in this new school.\n\nIt is not certain where the Sisters lived, or even where they taught the children. Perhaps, it was in an empty house situated on the “lot” on Driggs Avenue. Records listed in the “Central Home of The Holy Family of Nazareth” located in Des Plaines, Illinois, indicate that the first nuns in Greenpoint, lived in a cold, drafty house. It was probably near the site of the old school, which was being built at that time. The house was torn down in a year or two, and the site at 185 Driggs Avenue became the location of the first rectory.\n\nThe year of 1896 was an eventful one for the Polish Colony of Greenpoint and Williamsburg. In Greenpoint, on Driggs Avenue, a school was erected to which children were admitted in the Fall of the same year. This new building housed also a temporary church and chapel, in which the bishop during Confirmation ceremonies, announced to the people that as of this date the Parish of St. Stanislaus Kostka was formally in existence.\n\nIn 1896, there were one hundred and fifty students in school, within a few years the figure rose to above four hundred. In the year of 1909-1910, a seventh grade was added, and in 1912-1914, the school was remodeled and enlarged with an eighth grade being opened for the following year. Five hundred and six children were taught in these eight grades.\n\nJune of 1914 saw our first four graduates. The graduates were Anthony F. Zasowski (who later became a prelate), Leonard Piasecki, Konstanty Chrzanowski, and Mary Baranowska. At this graduation the pastor proudly stated, “Whoever from the eighth grade would wish to go to High School will receive a diploma signifying completion of Parochial School training.” This year closed the first era of the school’s life. Throughout this period, the school served the needs of the Polish population of Greenpoint and Williamsburg. The period experienced the loss of our oldest Polish School, begun in 1883 in the Parish of St. Casimir’s on North 7th Street in Williamsburg. After the opening of St. Stanislaus Kostka School, she no longer had any reason to exist, since all her duties were taken over by our school. It can be claimed with natural pride, that St. Stanislaus Kostka’s roots reached back to the year 1883.\n\nAs the Parish of St. Stanislaus Kostka grew so did the school enrollment. As can be readily seen by the school enrollment of 1019 students during 1923-1924, the children were everywhere. They were down in the lower church and up in the school hall. The conditions were crowded and oppressive. The number of children in one classroom was so great it was unbelievable. In the school hall two classes were separated by movable partitions. The second grade had ninety-eight pupils in the years 1927-1929, and in the sixth grade the pupils numbered one hundred and twenty. On Saturdays and Sundays, the school hall was used for all sorts of functions designed to raise money for a new school. Before every function, everything had to be removed. Very early Monday morning the hall had to be aired out and readied again for classroom purposes. A new school was a real necessity. In 1929, this dream was realized with the building of a new school dedicated to the advancement of education. There were eighteen classes, a new hall, and several extra rooms. It was a great leap forward. The efforts of the parishioners, who accomplished this, were amazing. Everyone rejoiced; those who planned, those who built and those who paid off the debts. To this day the building is a source of pride and joy.\n\nThe building of the new school on Newell Street in 1929 brought the parish to its most current period. The Parish now had school buildings with a significant number of classrooms and equipment which gave greater possibilities as we proceeded into the future. Naturally, this does not preclude the necessary interior and exterior upkeep to maintain the buildings in proper order, for which large sums of money were expended. The current times, however, necessitated different categories of improvements.\n\nIn 1966, television sets with a closed circuit station assigned by the diocese were installed. A school Library was opened in 1968 replacing a former classroom.\n\nAs the enrollment slowly declined, classrooms became available for other uses. A science lab and central computer room were opened as the school moved ahead to keep up with educational and technological advances of the times.\n\nAlong with the decrease in student enrollment St. Stanislaus Kostka School saw a decrease in the number of Sisters in the classrooms. As the number of lay faculty increased the school began to become a financial concern of the parish. However, just as the people of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish supported the financial burden of building a school in 1926, they continue to support it today.\n\nThrough the continued support of our parish family our students are offered classes in Art, Music, Gym and Computer in addition to the core curriculum. A well founded English Second Language (ESL) program as well as remedial services are made available through the efforts of our retired Sisters. In addition, funds are received from the NYS government to assist with needed supplies and services for our school. Though St. Stanislaus Kostka School has changed greatly since its birth in 1895 it is still striving to educate our students spiritually, academically and socially thus enabling them to take their place in a rapidly changing world.\n\nIn our educational endeavors, the personal development of the student, as a Christian and as an individual person, are the hallmarks of the philosophy of Saint Stanislaus Kostka School. As a school community we believe that the primary purpose of the school is to lead individuals to live a Christ-like life by coming to know and love God through the Gospel teachings.\n\nThe faculty of St. Stanislaus Kostka School believes that knowledge is a value in itself and leads to self-improvement. We strive to develop the intellect of our students by recognizing their individuality. The faculty firmly believes in each child’s learning potential and unique learning style. Hence, curriculum is developmental with emphasis on the whole child.\n\nOur aim is to foster a positive learning experience which will eventually culminate in creating an individual who is an asset to himself, to the community and to humankind.\n\nImportant to its identity as a Catholic school, various liturgical celebrations are planned. The students participate in monthly First Friday Mass, class masses, seasonal prayer services, class Stations of the Cross, processions for various Church holy days, May Crowning and frequent opportunities for the Sacrament of Reconciliation. In addition, classes preparing for the reception of the sacraments have additional service projects and prayer services to add to the “specialness” of the sacraments.\n\nActivities take place throughout the school year to add to growth of school spirit, global awareness and nurturing of student talents. The activities include Academic Jeopardy, International Night, Spelling Bees, Christmas Pageants, Thanksgiving Food Drive, World Hunger Day, various events during Catholic Schools Week, donations to the Propagation of Faith and Lenten sacrifices for the poor.\n\nThe students are fortunate to have a variety of after school activities open to them. Our children can enjoy being members of the Altar Servers, Athletic League, Children’s Choir, Krakowianki and Górale, Lectors and Blessed Virgin Mary Sodality. The religious, faculty and parents respect one anothers’ roles as we provide for a healthy environment for our children. An environment which will allow our students to grow emotionally, socially, intellectually and physically as members of St. Stanislaus Kostka School.\n\nAsk and it shall be given to you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. – Matthew 7:7\n\nSisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth\n\nThe Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth are an international apostolic congregation called to extend the Kingdom of God’s love through dedicated service to the Church, especially in ministry to the family. The community was founded in Rome, Italy, in 1875, by Frances Siedliska, who is now known as Blessed Mary of Jesus the Good Shepherd.\n\nAfter establishing convents in Krakow, Poland, in 1881, Mother Mary turned her eyes to the United States. She, accompanied by ten Sisters, landed in New York on July 4, 1885. The first three American houses were founded in Chicago in 1885. Four homes were founded in Brooklyn between the years 1891 to 1896.\n\nThe Sisters continued throughout the early 1900’s to establish homes throughout the United States and Europe.
