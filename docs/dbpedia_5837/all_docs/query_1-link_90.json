        "text": "This is ACE. Clarks Originals’ celebrates six successful, creative women in their spring/summer campaign, ‘Mother, we feel your influence.’ The FABulous line-up includes Siobhan Fahey of Bananarama, Skunk Anansie’s Skin, Soul II Soul’s Caron Wheeler, Sister Bliss of Faithless, alongside stylist Sherry Lamden and ballerina and choreographer Dame Gillian Lynne.\n\nThe concept aims to highlight the original influencers. Women who have shaped popular culture, as anyone who went clubbing in the 1980s will recognise. Styled by Lamden, directed by Clarks’ Chief Brand Officer Jason Beckley and shot by Paul Wetherell (shame they didn’t use a female photographer), the campaign is a series of lovely portraits and a short film which explores each woman’s relationship with creativity, inspiration and fame. Siobhan Fahey is spot-on about YouTubers…\n\nThe Mother title is slightly irksome, but beyond that, it’s cool to see a campaign where the women, not the products, take centre stage. It’s also a nice move for Clarks Originals’ – whose marketing had become a little menswear and youth-focussed lately – to be showing older women doing their own thing. This combination of age, creativity and defying expectations ticks all my boxes.\n\nAt the end of the film Dame Gillian Lynne, says on growing older and her career, ‘I’m going to keep going until they say time’s up – and then I’ll say, “Are you sure?”’ Too right.\n\nBrains, talent, creativity and comfy shoes. Bring it on.\n\nP.S. If you haven’t been to the Clarks Originals’ Berwick Street store in London it’s definitely worth a look-in. I like the chunky heel Chelsea boots and the trainers Lamden is wearing (above) and always love a desert boot.\n\nPlease note: affiliate links in this post may generate commission."
