        "text": "Caron Wheeler (born 19 January 1963) is a British singer, songwriter, record producer and musician. Born and raised in London, she performed in various singing competitions as a teenager and began her recording career as one of the founding members of Brown Sugar. She was also one of the founding member of the female backing vocalist group Afrodiziak. She officially rose to fame in the late 1980s as lead singer of R&B group Soul II Soul. Managed by her fellow bandmate, Jazzie B, the group became one of the London's best-selling groups of all time. Their debut album, Club Classics Vol. One (1989), which established them as a global success worldwide, earned two Grammy Awards and featured the UK and Billboard number-one singles \"Keep on Movin'\" and \"Back to Life (However Do You Want Me)\".\n\nFollowing the exit from the group in 1990, she released her debut solo album, UK Blak (1990), which contained hits \"Livin' in the Light\", \"UK Blak\", and \"Don't Quit\". She continued her solo career with the release of her second album, Beach of the War Goddess (1993). Wheeler reunited with Soul II Soul in 1994, but left in 1995 due to creative differences. Throughout her career, she has performed on and off with Soul II Soul but officially rejoined them in 2013.\n\nDescribed as a pioneer of the British soul scene, her musical repertoire is often characterized by themes of love, relationships, and empowerment, as well as black history. Her dynamic on-stage performances have led many critics to consider her one of the most effective singers in popular music. Throughout a career spanning 40 years, she has sold over 6 million records collectively as a solo artist and as a member of Soul II Soul. In June 2012, Wheeler was honored with the Heritage Award from Performing Right Society along with the members of Soul II Soul.\n\nCareer\n\n1976–83: Brown Sugar\n\nWhen Caron was in high school, she and childhood friend Pauline Catlin began performing together for fun. Inspired by female groups The Shirelles and The Ronettes whom they hoped to emulate, they began performing together professionally. In 1976, Wheeler and Catlin eventually entered and won a singing competition at the Bali Hai nightclub in London. Catlin and Wheeler later added Carol Simms and the women began performing as Brown Sugar.\n\nIn 1977, Brown Sugar released their major label debut song \"I'm in Love with a Dreadlocks\". The song was a massive hit with sound system owners and reggae lovers and went on to reach the top spot in the British reggae charts. Their self-titled album was scheduled to be released in 1977, but was shelved after the group disbanded due to the mistreatment by their recording label, Lover's Rock. In 1978, Caron reunited with Brown Sugar and embarked on a tour with Dennis Brown. Following the tour, the group released a series of singles: \"Our Reggae Music\", \"Confession Hurts\", \"Dreaming of Zion\", and \"I am So Proud\" in 1979. After releasing their final single Go On Now in 1983, the group disbanded to further pursue solo careers.\n\n1982–88: Afrodiziak\n\nIn 1982, Wheeler met Claudia Fontaine, an English backing vocalist from Bethnal Green, London, England. They formed a duo known as Afrodiziak. The duo would only perform as session vocalists for other singers, most notably for Elvis Costello on his album Punch the Clock in 1983. Afrodiziak later toured as backing vocalists for Elvis Costello during his UK tour in 1983. After the tour, they became a group by adding singer Naomi Thompson. The group would go on to contribute background vocals for many artists including Heaven 17, Special AKA, Howard Jones, Japan, Aswad, Sam Brown, and Julia Fordham. Wheeler would later withdraw from the group in 1988.\n\n1988–90: Soul II Soul\n\nIn 1988, Wheeler met Jazzie B who asked her to become one of the founding members of Soul II Soul.

The lineup now consisted of Jazzie B, Charlotte Kelly, and Penny Ford. During the recording sessions, Wheeler and Jazzie B struggled with creative differences. Wheeler felt the group should have been producing more contemporary songs and not just replicating the old sound. Although the band retained the songs she had co-written with other vocalists recording over her lead vocals. Wheeler was supposed to appear as the lead vocalist on the album's lead single \"Love Enuff\", but she opted not to finished the song and fellow Soul II Soul member Penny Ford sang lead vocals with Wheeler only performing background vocals on the song.
