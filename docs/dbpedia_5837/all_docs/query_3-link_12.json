        "text": "Karen ( KARR-ən) is a given name and occasional surname. In English, it is a feminine given name derived from the name Katherine, and it is also found in modern Africa, as well as in East Asia (particularly Japan). However, in other countries such as Iran and Armenia, it is a masculine name deriving from Middle Iranian.\n\nKaren entered the English language from Norwegian, where it has been a short form of \"Katherine\" since medieval times. It became popular in the English-speaking world in the 1940s. The name Karen was one of the top 10 names for girls born in the United States during the 1950s and 1960s, peaking as the third most popular girl's name in 1965.[1]\n\nVariants include Caren, Caryn, Karena, Karin, Karyn, and others.[2]\n\nDue to its increasingly common derogatory use since 2017, the name has become significantly less popular in the United States in recent years.[3]\n\nIn Armenia Karen (Armenian: Կարեն, IPA: [kɑˈɾɛn]) is a common masculine given name.\n\nThe masculine given name Karen derived from the Parthian name of House of Karen (or Caren), one of the seven aristocratic families of ancient Iran. Several Iranian princes named Karen are known before and after the Islamic period. The Karen house ruled the Tabaristan region of Iran, which approximately corresponds to the current provinces of Gilan state and Mazandaran.\n\nThe masculine given name Garen is a Western Armenian form of the Eastern Armenian Karen.\n\nThe masculine given name Karen was mentioned by the prominent Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi (ca. 410–490s AD; Armenian: Մովսես Խորենացի) in his book History of Armenia.[4]\n\nKaren can also be a surname.\n\nIn East Asia, Karen is a feminine given name. The name can be found in Japan. It may come from 可憐 (\"pretty, lovely\"),[5] 華蓮 (combining kanji meaning \"flower\" and \"lotus or water lily\")[6] or other meanings.\n\nAnna Karen (1936–2022), South African British actress\n\nJames Karen (1923–2018), American actor\n\nTom Karen (1926–2022), Austrian-born British industrial designer\n\nKaren Abrahamyan (born 1966), Armenian politician\n\nKaren Aghamyan (born 1946), Armenian painter\n\nKaren Aleksanyan (born 1980), Armenian football midfielder\n\nKaren Andreasyan (born 1977), Armenian human rights defender\n\nKaren Asatryan (born 1974), Armenian football player\n\nKaren Asrian (1980–2008), Armenian chess grandmaster\n\nKaren Demirchyan (1932–1999), Armenian politician\n\nKaren Drambjan (1954–2011), Armenian-born Estonian lawyer, politician and activist\n\nKaren Jalavyan (born 1971), Armenian Colonel in Artsakh\n\nKaren Kavaleryan (born 1961), Russian musician and composer\n\nKaren Karapetyan (born 1963), Armenian politician and Prime minister of Armenia from 2016 to 2018\n\nKaren Khachanov (born 1996), Russian tennis player of Armenian descent\n\nKaren Khachaturian (1920–2011), Russian composer of Armenian descent\n\nKaren Sargsyan (conductor) (born 1952), Armenian choirmaster\n\nKaren Shakhnazarov (born 1952), Russian filmmaker, producer and screenwriter of Armenian descent\n\nZarmihr Karen (died 558), Iranian nobleman and Sasanian governor of Zabulistan\n\nKaren Iwata (born 1998), Japanese singer\n\nKaren Kong, Malaysian singer\n\nKaren Makishima (born 1976), Japanese politician\n\nKaren Miyama (born 1996), Japanese actress\n\nKaren Mok (born 1970), Hong Kong singer and actress\n\nKaren Nun-Ira (born 1991), Japanese judoka\n\nKaren Tanaka (born 1961), Japanese composer\n\nKaren Takizawa (born 1992), Japanese model, tarento and actress\n\nKaren Yu (born 1980), Taiwanese politician\n\nKaren Starr, a character created by DC Comics, civilian identity of Power Girl"
