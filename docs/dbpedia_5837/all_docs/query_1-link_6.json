        "text": "“Back to Life (However Do You Want Me)” was the song of the summer for 1989 and is Soul II Soul’s best-known and most successful single. It was released as the second single from the British R&B band’s debut album, Club Classics Vol. One on 29th May 1989.\n\nThe laid-back R&B/house song features a crossover mix of reggae, hip hop, breakbeats, and electronica, although the original album track was actually an A Capella and was heavily remixed for the single release. It was produced by Jazzie B and Nellee Hooper, who played pivotal roles in crafting its unique sound.\n\nNot wanting to destroy Caron Wheeler’s silky, soulful vocals, the production remains minimalist, incorporating an infectious beat with a blend of live instruments and electronic elements, which was relatively novel at the time. It’s a classy house sound with none of the harsh acid house sounds found in so many other dance hits of the time, making it stand out.\n\nThe single was the follow-up to “Keep On Moving,” which had reached #5 in 1989 and also featured R&B singer Caron Wheeler on vocals.\n\nOn “Back to Life,” Wheeler performs alongside The Reggae Philharmonic Orchestra and Claudia Fontaine, who provides backing vocals. She was previously in the group Afrodiziak alongside Wheeler from 1982 to 1988 and sadly died on March 13th, 2018, aged 57. The track was penned by Jazzie B, Caron Wheeler, Nellee Hooper, and Simon Law and produced by Jazzie B and Caron Wheeler.\n\nWheeler and Fontaine also provided the chorus vocals on The Special A.K.A hit “Free Nelson Mandela“.\n\nImpact and Legacy\n\nThe song’s seamless blend of soulful melodies, rhythmic beats, and meaningful lyrics captures the essence of a transformative period in music history, a precursor to the dance sounds of the 1990s.\n\n“Back To Life” was a critical darling, receiving swathes of rave reviews. The song won Soul II Soul their first Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. It’s also credited with helping to usher in a new era of British R&B, paving the way for future artists\n\nThe British DJ and TV presenter Pat Sharp, a guest reviewer for Smash Hits magazine, awarded the song “Single of the Fortnight”. Comparing it to their previous hit “Keep On Movin'”, he stated “This one is miles better. I’ve been playing this one for a while. It’s really simple and tuneful.”\n\nThe Origins of Soul II Soul\n\nSoul II Soul, a British musical collective formed in 1988, was spearheaded by DJ and producer Jazzie B. The group emerged from the vibrant London club scene, where they initially made their mark as DJs and sound system performers. Their innovative approach to music, blending traditional soul with contemporary beats, quickly garnered attention, setting the stage for their breakthrough.\n\nChart Performance\n\nThe song entered the UK singles chart at No.12 on 4th June, at the same time as Jason Donovan entered the chart at No.1 with “Sealed With A Kiss” and Cliff Richard entered at No.2 with “The Best of Me”. “Back To Life” climbed to #3 the following week, with the two aforementioned songs holding the same chart positions. Soul II Soul claimed the No.1 spot on 18th June, where it remained for four weeks.\n\nIn the U.S., the single reached #4 on the Billboard Hot 100. The track’s success was a significant milestone for Soul II Soul, as it broke barriers for British R&B acts in the US, a market traditionally dominated by American artists.\n\nFormats and B-side\n\nThe UK 7-inch vinyl featured an Instrumental version of the B-side (4:23), which was longer than the A-side (3:48). The UK 12-inch vinyl featured three tracks: the Club Mix (7:37), Jam On The Groove Mix (5:08), and a new track, “Back to the Beats” (4:38).\n\nThe U.S. Maxi single featured five versions of “Back To Life:” 12″ Mix (7:37), A Capella Intro Version (3:29), LP Version (3:50), Jam & The Groove (5:08), and Bonus Beats (4:38).\n\nVideo\n\nThe video, directed by Andy Delaney and Monty Whitebloom, was filmed mostly in Epping Forest, on the border of Greater London and Essex. The band performs outside with three violinists, but there is also a city scene with the band performing on a rooftop.\n\nLyrics\n\nThe chorus “However do you want me, however do you need me” is repeated frequently throughout the song, and there are three verses and a bridge. “Back to life, back to reality” is part of the verse rather than the chorus.\n\nNo products found."
