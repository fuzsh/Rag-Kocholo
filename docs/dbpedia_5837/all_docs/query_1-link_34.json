        "text": "One of these made my best-of-2021 list last week. Guess which.\n\nCleo Sol – Mother\n\nThe West London singer-songwriter whose appearances on SAULT’s albums are as essential as Shara Nelson and Caron Wheeler’s on Massive Attack and Soul II Soul’s, respectively, shrouds herself in a quietude that takes getting used to. Although on “Build Me Up” Cleopatra Nikolic sings, “I’d rather be emotional than hurt inside,” it’s the hurt inside, vibrating through her mezzo-soprano, that’s manifest, not the emotional. Finding arrangements commensurate to sharing the hurt sometimes causes her tasteful material to wobble; Mother blurs distinctions between stoicism and lassitude.\n\nStick with it, though, and it offers aural pleasures as sure as Jhene Aiko and Minnie Riperton, both of whom specialized in nonplussed acoustic R&B with gospel undertones, or, in the case of Sol’s “One Day,” overtones: the electric guitar picking extemporizing on Sol and the backup singers’ vocals in “Know That You Are Loved,” the light shimmy of “Promises,” on which she declares, “Things are changing, but I’m still here.”\n\nThe Killers – Pressure Machine\n\nTo spend almost twenty years recording evocation after evocation of the dreams dreamed by a dusty sun-blasted youth courts a sentimentality indistinguishable from blood sickness. Done with Brandon Flowers’ level of commitment to mimicking forebears, though, the results can be on occasion powerful and fascinating — if also creepy. On the follow-up to Imploding the Mirage, Nebraska and The Ghost of Tom Joad replace Born to Run and Born in the U.S.A. as models for the whisper-to-a-more-whisper moments; fans troubled by the development have “In a Quiet Life” and “In Another Car” as pillow toys. The extent of this mimicry at first appalled me, especially when paired with the decision to staple prefatory monologues by actual Nephi residents to every song — what are they, character witnesses? The scenarios (most co-written by Jonathan Rado and/or the band) are both too specific in the manner of a creative writing program assignment and too vague. Flowers has claimed “Terrible Thing” is about a gay kid in a football town contemplating suicide. Well, maybe.\n\nRepeated play loosened me up, though. Pressure Machine is not a success, but this is a rare example of an album whose explanatory press releases help. The mild-mannered synth simmer of the title track celebrates a childhood of Happy Meals and Power Wheels; enduring it is like a distant friend insisting on showing you a photo album. “Quiet Town” builds to a sturdy chorus reflective of Flowers’ admission of a decent childhood with parents offering “the kind of love he could never put down.” But, impressively, he sounds neither smug nor boastful — it ain’t no sin to be glad you’re alive. And there’s something to a band that on their seventh album devoted to the grand gesture remain fascinated by their purported autobiographical roots: being unfamous in a small town sure seared their consciousnesses. The Killers don’t reflect the values of their fans — they never stopped being fans. If they don’t share a past, he’ll construct one from the detritus of old songs, aware and not giving a damn that the assemblage may collapse on him and muss his fabulous hair."
