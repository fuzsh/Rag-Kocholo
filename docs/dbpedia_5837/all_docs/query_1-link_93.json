        "text": "Two countdowns complete, it’s now time to start a couple more – this time, on the road.\n\nThe Boston Bruins, 3-0-1 in their last four games after a 1-5-1 dip, got defenseman Johnny Boychuk back from an arm injury on Thursday night (4-0 victory over Florida), then welcomed center David Krejci (concussion) back in Saturday’s 4-3, shootout loss to the Los Angeles Kings:\n\nNext up, player-wise: Center Marc Savard, who’ll continue to participate in non-contact drills as he works toward the completion of a comeback from post-concussion syndrome. It’s unlikely he’ll be cleared to play during this two-game road trip, which begins tonight at Tampa Bay (7:05, Versus).\n\nMeanwhile, the B’s wait for Krejci (12 games, 2-8–10) to return to form between LW Milan Lucic (10-7–17) and RW Nathan Horton (8-10–18) after missing six games. He led all Bruins forwards in playing time on Saturday (22 minutes, 21 seconds), getting four shots on goal and winning 15 of 21 faceoffs, but was minus-1 and he and his linemates were shut out at even strength and on the power play.\n\nKrejci said he “played a little carefully” and that it “wasn’t my best game,” but added: “I just believe I’ll be better every game now.”\n\nIt’d be unprecedented if everyone on Krejci’s line is shut out by Tampa Bay: Lucic has scored at least one point in 14 of Boston’s 18 games, and hasn’t been blanked in consecutive games this season.\n\nBruins update: One item of interest will be whether coach Claude Julien sticks with the lineup that recovered from a 3-0 deficit to earn a point against the Kings. While Patrice Bergeron, who filled in for Krejci, slid back between Jordan Caron and Mark Recchi and Julien restored the 4th/Energy line to original form (Brad Marchand-Gregory Campbell-Shawn Thornton), he kept Blake Wheeler at center and moved rookie Tyler Seguin to left wing with Michael Ryder on the right side. That line scored the first goal of Boston’s comeback – Wheeler’s fourth this year; third in the last 7 games. Wheeler also stayed on one of the power-play units, and fed Bergeron for the tying goal in the third period.\n\nThe NHL credits Boston with a 7-1-0 road record, which includes a 3-0 victory over Phoenix at Prague, Czech Republic. The B’s have come from behind to win their last two road games, bouncing back from a 4-2 deficit for a 7-4 win on Nov. 10 at Pittsburgh, and taking a 3-2 decision out of Madison Square Garden on Wednesday after falling behind, 1-0.\n\nLightning update: They completed a sweep of a three-game road trip with Saturday’s 2-1 victory at Buffalo – a rarity, in that the 1-2 punch of Steven Stamkos and Martin St. Louis was shut out. Stamkos, the NHL leader in goals (19) and points (34), has scored in 17 of 20 games; St. Louis (8-18–26) has only failed to score a point in 4 games.\n\nThere’s an enormous gap from those linemates to the No. 3 scorer on Tampa’s list, Teddy Purchess (3-9–12), especially with C Vinny Lecavalier out (hand) and the return of ex-Flyers LW Simon Gagne (neck) uncertain. Gagne unexpectedly missed his 14th straight game with a neck injury on Saturday.\n\nTampa has found it hard to keep the puck out of its net under first-year coach Guy Boucher. The Lightning has been outscored overall (62-64) and at even strength (37-49), but is still a solid 11-7-2 because of excellent special teams: Tampa Bay has the NHL’s best power play at home (9 for 30, 30 percent), and sits third overall (one spot behind the Bruins) with an 89 percent penalty-kill percentage."
