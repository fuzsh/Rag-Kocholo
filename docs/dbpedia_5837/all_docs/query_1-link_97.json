        "text": "UK Blak? Yes. Killed the campaign, and her solo career, stone dead.\n\nI may be the only one on here, but I don't think there is anything wrong with 'UK Blak' as such, and I deffo don't think it can be blamed for what happened with Caron Wheeler's solo career – that is part of a wider problem …\n\nIt's hardly surprising that RCA honed in on 'Livin' In The Light' and 'UK Blak' as the first singles from her debut solo album. They're not a million miles away in sound from 'Back To Life', and have a very similar tempo to the songs she was best known for. However, presenting the public with another version of something they have already lapped up was an extremely conservative strategy – and sonically, both those tracks, while not worked on by anybody connected with Soul II Soul, made it appear as if Wheeler only had variations on a theme to offer, however potent the lyrics on both those tracks are. Hence my preference for David Morales' overhaul of 'Livin' In The Light' (link previously posted), where all the original instrumentation is stripped out in favour of a starker, more atmospheric and subtly building backing track, where the lyrics don't get lost in an over busy mix and Wheeler's voice is fully showcased.\n\nHad RCA been braver, they would – and arguably should – have gone for 'Don't Quit' as the lead single – totally different in sound to anything Soul II Soul came up with, not aimed a club audience at all, and occupying territory that Oleta Adams and Des'Ree would later successfully claim as their own:\n\nInstead, it was the third single, and couldn't get near the Top 40. Wheeler had been boxed in by the Soul II Soul sound that made her a star and when she released a single that didn't fit that mould, it was too late. She was trapped in her bizarre deal with RCA in the UK and EMI for the rest of the world, to complicate matters released a Jam & Lewis-produced single on their A&M-backed Perspective label and ultimately got left behind – what a waste. And, unfortunately, yet another instance of UK record companies having no idea how to manage black British talent (although Wheeler's management must surely take some blame given the weird hybrid multi-label deal they agreed for her – a recipe for disaster before she'd even released anything)."
