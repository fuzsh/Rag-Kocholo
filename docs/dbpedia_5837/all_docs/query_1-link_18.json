        "text": "Following up 'Keep On Shining' their last No.1 single together, Love Is A Bassline & Gill Morley join forces in celebration of soul singer Caron Wheeler's incredible OBE achievement and their awesome new single 'Sweetness' is the result. Caron Wheeler (Soul II Soul legend, Back To Life/Keep On Moving) once again puts her classy jazzy vocals alongside Gill's sultry strings and Love Is A Bassline's funky disco production which combine perfectly for that sweet dancefloor goodness.\n\nGill Morley artist/violinist/writer, has been a string player with Soul II Soul for 16 years, she had formed a love of dance music through playing at The Hacienda and the PSV Club during the Madchester years and has dreamt of releasing songs she recorded with Caron and Wallis/Firth/Blair that never saw the light of day. A chance meeting with producer Jason Laidback when he was starting his new Love Is A Bassline project meant that these amazing vocals could be turned into something completely new.\n\nJason Laidback artist/DJ/producer/writer, started on the Rave scene, has played worldwide and achieved success under many guises. Love Is A Bassline explores his love affair with all things House & Disco. The sound is all about uplifting feel good vibes so the timing is perfect for these free spirited artists to come together and make some fresh exciting magic.\n\nFor further press enquiries & licensing requests please contact : midnightriotrecords@gmail.com"
