Most people just... they just stop trying. But you’re not like that. You’re a fighter. You always have been.\n\n— Karen Wheeler, July 3, 1985\n\n”\n\nKaren Wheeler (née Childress),[1] portrayed by Cara Buono, is a main character in Stranger Things. She is the loving but somewhat clueless mother of Nancy, Mike, and Holly, and the wife of Ted.\n\nIn 1983, after her son's friend, Will Byers, went missing, Karen enforced strict rules that no one in her household would go outside late. This caused friction between her children, particularly Nancy. She remained largely unaware of the events around her, especially her son keeping an escaped experiment in her basement and her daughter searching for a monster from another dimension. When a group of agents arrived at their house telling her and her husband that his son and friends might be hiding the experiment, Karen became extremely distraught. She eventually tearfully reunited with Mike at the local middle school and went to the hospital where Will had been recovered.\n\nIn 1984, she remained the same; blissfully unaware of what her children were doing after they lied and say they were having a sleepover (when, in reality, Mike was tending to a possessed Will, while Nancy teamed up with Jonathan Byers to shut down Hawkins National Laboratory). She did, however, become sexually attracted to Billy Hargrove, the older brother of Max Mayfield, who reciprocated the feelings.\n\nBy the summer of 1985, Karen's desire for Billy had hit the ultimate peak, ogling him along with her friends at the local pool, where Billy worked as a lifeguard. When Billy propositioned her by offering \"swimming lessons\" at the local motel, Karen was about to leave for the night until she discovered Holly sleeping in Ted's lap on the chair. She realized how selfish she was and ultimately decided to not go. The next day, Karen arrived at the pool to talk to Billy (who had been possessed by another force from the dimension) and explained why she didn't come, but Billy, restraining himself from hurting her, simply told her to stay away from him. She soon resigned herself back to being a mother, offering Nancy advice after getting fired from her job, and three months later, comforting Mike after the Byers family moved out of Hawkins.\n\nBy the spring of 1986, while Mike was sent to California for Spring Break, paranoia of the town's mysterious mall fire and and recent murders of teenagers lead Karen, alongside the other parents, to believe their children to be linked to Eddie Munson, leader of the Hellfire Club, a Dungeons & Dragons club falsely believed to be a Satanic group. Karen grew to be concerned about Nancy since she was missing, and was left puzzled when Mike's friends fled from the police. Soon after, what was perceived as an earthquake caused a four-way rip throughout Hawkins, leaving Karen and the other townspeople frazzled and ready to move out. After tearfully reuniting with Mike, Karen was left to worry as she and Holly saw floating particles from the dimension, the Upside Down, beginning to infect Hawkins.\n\nQuick Answers\n\nWhat role does Karen Wheeler play in the Stranger Things series?\n\nKaren Wheeler, also known as Mrs. Wheeler or the mom from Stranger Things, is a main character in the series. Portrayed by Cara Buono, she is the loving but somewhat clueless mother of Nancy, Mike, and Holly, and the wife of Ted. After her son's friend, Will Byers, goes missing, Karen enforces strict rules that no one goes out late, causing friction between her children, particularly Nancy. Despite being a part of the main cast since the first season, Karen remains largely unaware of the strange events happening around her, including her son keeping an escaped experiment in her basement.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nHow does Karen Wheeler's character contribute to the plot of Stranger Things?\n\nKaren Wheeler, also known as Mrs. Wheeler or the mom from Stranger Things, is a central character who contributes significantly to the plot. She is the mother of Nancy, Mike, and Holly, and the wife of Ted. Her character is portrayed as loving but somewhat clueless, often unaware of the strange events happening around her. This includes her son Mike keeping an escaped experiment in her basement and her daughter Nancy's adventures. After the disappearance of her son's friend, Will Byers, she enforces strict rules about going out late, causing friction between her and her children. Despite her lack of knowledge about the Upside Down and the supernatural events in Hawkins, her character adds a layer of normalcy and domesticity to the show. Her presence in every episode of the first season underscores her importance in the series.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWhat are some of the challenges Karen Wheeler faces as a mother in Stranger Things?\n\nKaren Wheeler, also known as the mom from Stranger Things, faces several challenges throughout the series. One of the main challenges is her struggle to maintain control and enforce rules in her household, especially after the disappearance of her son's friend, Will Byers. This leads to friction between her and her children, particularly her daughter, Nancy. Another challenge is her failing marriage, which is often symbolized by the frequent presence of a glass or bottle of wine in her scenes. Despite these difficulties, Karen remains largely unaware of the extraordinary events happening around her, including her son hiding an escaped experiment in her basement.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nHow does Karen Wheeler's relationship with her children evolve throughout Stranger Things?\n\nKaren Wheeler, also known as the mom from Stranger Things, starts off as a loving but somewhat clueless mother to her children Nancy, Mike, and Holly. After the disappearance of her son's friend, Will Byers, she enforces strict rules about not going out late, causing friction between her and her children, particularly Nancy. Despite these rules, she remains largely unaware of the strange events happening around her, including her son Mike hiding an escaped experiment in her basement. As the series progresses, it's hinted that Karen begins to realize the unusual occurrences that have been happening right under her nose. However, her relationship with her children continues to be strained due to her lack of awareness about their adventures in the Upside Down.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWhat are some key moments that highlight Karen Wheeler's character in Stranger Things?\n\nKaren Wheeler, also known as the mom from Stranger Things, is a character who is often seen as loving but somewhat clueless. Some key moments that highlight her character include when her son's friend, Will Byers, goes missing in 1983. In response, she enforces strict rules that no one goes out late, causing friction between her children, particularly Nancy. Despite these efforts, she remains largely unaware of the events around her, such as her son keeping an escaped experiment in her basement. Another notable aspect of Karen's character is her resilience. As she says in a quote from July 3, 1985, 'This world... it beats you up again and again until eventually, most people just... they just stop trying. But you’re not like that. You’re a fighter. You always have been.' This quote encapsulates Karen's spirit and determination, despite the challenges she faces.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nHistory[]\n\nBackground[]\n\nKaren Wheeler was born around 1944-1946, presumably in Hawkins, Indiana. At some point in the late 1960's, she met Ted Wheeler. Nancy stated that Karen was attracted to Ted's cushy lifestyle and well-paying job while Ted was attracted to Karen's youthfulness rather than either of them genuinely loving each other. Together, they purchased a home on Maple Street, a cul-de-sac in Hawkins, and raised three children - Nancy (born 1967), Michael \"Mike\" (born April 7, 1971), and Holly (born 1980).\n\n1983[]\n\nOn November 6, 1983, Mike and his friends played a Dungeons & Dragons campaign in the basement for ten hours straight, according to Mike. Karen seemed surprised by this and told them to stop playing as it was getting late and it was a school night.\n\nAfter the disappearance of Will Byers, Karen told her children that they could not leave the house until he was found, forbidding Mike to search for Will and Nancy to go \"study\" at Barbara Holland's house.\n\nOn November 8, Karen allowed Mike to skip school, believing he was sick, At the dinner table, Nancy lied that she was going to a special assembly at school to support Will and his family - this was a cover story so that she could hang out with Steve. After some reluctance, Karen gave her permission to go - as long as she was back by 10.\n\nAfter Nancy returned from Steve's party, Karen scolded her for returning late. When Karen asked about the sweatshirt Nancy was wearing, she admitted that it belonged to Steve, but kept making up excuses to avoid talking about the party at Steve's house, her fight with Barb, or that Nancy had sex with Steve himself. Karen tried to tell Nancy that she could trust her and talk about anything that happened, but Nancy brushed her off.\n\nThe next day, Karen visited Joyce Byers at her home along with her daughter Holly, gifting her a casserole. Karen noticed that the house was decorated with Christmas lights, and Joyce gave the excuse that she hung them for Will because he loved Christmas. Noticing Holly had walked off from the dinner table, she and Joyce found her in Will's room. Joyce thanked Karen for the casserole but insisted that they leave the house. Later, Nancy revealed to Karen she was worried about Barb's disappearance. Later that night, Mike returned home with the news that Will's body was found, crying in her arms.\n\nBefore leaving the next day, Karen asked Mike if he wanted to come with her to rent a movie, even an R-rated one. Mike declined for fear of leaving Eleven alone in his house. Karen went off on her own to check up on Barb's parents.\n\nAfter being questioned by the police about Barb's disappearance, Karen insisted Nancy was lying to the police about talking with Steve in his bedroom. Nancy finally admitted to Karen that she slept with him.\n\nKaren, Ted, Nancy, and Mike all attended Will's funeral where Karen hushed Mike and his other friend, Dustin Henderson when they spotted Jennifer Hayes crying for Will.\n\nDepartment of Energy agents arrived at the Wheeler house, looking for Eleven. When questioned, Karen answered that she did not know of any mysterious girl living in the house, and that if she had, she would know. She and Ted were eventually allowed to leave their house; they arrived at Hawkins Middle School in their car, reuniting with their son. They were present at the hospital, waiting for news on Will's status following his recovery.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Jonathan picked up Will from another Dungeons & Dragons campaign at the Wheelers'. As they left, Karen exchanged festive greetings with them.\n\n1984[]\n\nOn October 29, 1984, Karen was seen in the kitchen with her husband and Holly, watching Nancy chase Mike for taking change from her piggy bank. On the next day, while eating at the dinner table, Ted and Karen told Mike to put some of his toys in two boxes as punishment for taking some of Nancy's change.\n\nFour days later, while eating breakfast with her family, Karen heared Nancy say she was planning to go have a sleepover at a friend's house for the weekend. When Nancy asked if it was okay, Karen said yes (unaware that Nancy planned to expose the Hawkins Lab with Jonathan's help, in order to avenge Barbara's death).\n\nOn the next day, while Karen was on the phone, Ted answered the door after hearing the doorbell ring. He met Dustin, who asked for Mike. Ted said Mike was over at Will's, but Dustin said he couldn't reach anybody at Will's, so he asked for Nancy. When Ted asked Karen where Nancy was, she said Nancy's supposedly at Ally's, causing an irritated Dustin to leave.\n\nLater, while reading an erotic novel in her bubble bath, she answered the doorbell after Ted had fallen asleep on his couch, and met Billy. After flirting, she gave him the address to the Byers house before he left.\n\nA month later, Karen attended Barb's funeral with Nancy and Ted. When Mike got ready to go to the Snow Ball, Karen took pictures of Mike, much to his annoyance as she kept taking too many pictures of him.\n\n1985[]\n\nAt the Hawkins Community Pool, Karen Wheeler and three other mature women were waiting for Heather Holloway, the lifeguard on duty, to step down so that Billy Hargrove could come forward, each woman ogling him. Billy complimented Karen’s swimsuit, and later after watching her swim, complimented her again and told her she had perfect \"form\". After some prodding, Billy managed to convince her to come with him to Motel 6 for \"swimming lessons\", where it was \"very private\". That night, Karen beautified herself and took off her wedding ring, preparing to go to Billy. The next morning Karen took a call from El to her son Mike Wheeler. Karen stayed on the line and was shocked when Mike lied about his grandmother being gravely ill. Hearing his mom on the other end of the line, Mike told Karen to get off the phone so he could finish his conversation with his girlfriend, which Karen did. Later, Karen returned to the Hawkins Community Pool and apologized to Billy about standing him up the night before. Billy however, was not present, as he had been Flayed. He managed to control his unnatural urge to attack Karen, but only just, and instead told Karen to stay away from him.\n\nKaren's daughter Nancy later returned home from being fired from The Hawkins Post, going to her room. She eventually came out and confided in Karen her concerns that Jonathan Byers might be right, that she just insists on being right even if she isn't. Karen supported Nancy, saying that the journalists at The Post were \"shitheads\", and encouraged Nancy to finish her story, that she might get picked up by a national outlet and go right over The Post's heads.\n\nKaren later went to the Fun Fair with Ted and Holly and bribed the operator of a Ferris wheel to stop the ride while she and her family were at its apex, enabling them to better view the Fourth of July fireworks. Holly, however, was distracted by the trees moving seemingly of their own volition; signs of the Mind Flayer’s passage. Hopper and Joyce later found Karen on an amusement park ride, asking where the kids were, but Karen didn't know as she had trouble keeping track. After the ride, Karen noticed Joyce running off with Jim Hopper (unaware they were being pursued by Russian hitman Grigori), remarking they made an odd couple. Ted remarked there was always one for somebody and put his hand on Karen's shoulder, much to her annoyance.\n\nThree months later, after her son Mike said goodbye to El and Will, Mike returned home when Karen was cooking. She noticed how depressed he was and gave him a hug to comfort him.\n\n1986[]\n\nOn March 21st, 1986, as Mike and Nancy prepared to leave for school, Karen reminded Mike that he needed to be home by 9:00 after his meeting with the Hellfire Club, so he could be prepared for his flight to California. She had grown less than enthusiastic about Mike and Nancy's teenage attitude, and sighed when Ted asked when their children would become tolerable human beings again.\n\nWhile making breakfast the next day, Karen greeted Nancy and Dustin as they ran into the kitchen, seeing Max at the table with Holly. Karen asked if everything was alright, and Nancy confirmed. Karen then went to Dustin, remarking how sweet it was that the kids were all sticking together during the murder spree that was plaguing Hawkins. Ted said that they could try sticking together at someone else's home, but Karen dismissed him and told Dustin that he and the others were welcome anytime. Dustin returned the warmth by saying she was like family, and asked if he could take some pancakes that Karen made for them. Ted sarcastically remarked that they should take them for all they're worth, causing Karen to glare at him.\n\nIn the morning, Karen sat next to Ted as they watched in horror the news bulletin of the third victim of the murder spree, Patrick McKinney. As Karen murmured in disbelief, Ted said that the authorities needed to do something since there was a serial killer on the loose. Ted and Karen brought Holly with them as they all attended a town meeting, with Chief Powell declaring a curfew for Hawkins. The meeting was interrupted by Jason Carver, head basketball player for Hawkins High, alongside his teammates. Jason whipped out a poster of the Hellfire Club, saying that Eddie Munson, alongside his friends, were the culprits of the murders and that they used D&D to summon evil. Karen, alongside Sue Sinclair and Claudia Henderson, was left speechless and horrified as the town began to file out to get weapons to defend themselves against Hellfire.\n\nThe three families returned to the Wheeler house as Karen ran down to the basement, calling for the children, only to find them gone. Karen told the group that they should've returned from the movies by now, but Erica Sinclair gently broke it to her that they probably lied to them. Claudia asked if they were really thinking their children were involved with Eddie, Ted said anything was possible, but Karen snapped at him and said that their children weren't murderers. Ted accused her of twisting his words, muttering to Charles Sinclair that she did this regularly. Karen went to the phone and began dialing. Erica asked if she was calling the theatre, but Karen corrected and said she was calling the police.\n\nThat night, Dustin, Lucas, and Max were picked up by the police at Lover's Lake and were brought back to the Wheelers, where they and the parents questioned them. Karen frantically asked the kids if Nancy was with them when they went \"night-swimming\", though Dustin and Max accidentally ended up giving conflicting stories. Ted's suggestion that they should throw the kids in jail to make them talk sparked an argument in the room, with the Sinclairs accusing him of wanting to put Lucas in jail. Karen's attempts to deescalate the situation by saying Ted didn't mean it like that proved to be unsuccessful as the argument grew louder, until Powell yelled for everyone to shut up, causing Karen to mumble under her breath. As Max was taken into the other room to be interrogated, Karen was comforted alongside the other parents that the kids hadn't done anything wrong. When Max was finished, Powell explained to Karen and the others that the kids went for a night swim and Nancy had showed up at some point. He comforted Karen that they would find her daughter, but the cops suddenly wondered where the kids went. Callahan discovered Dustin, Lucas, Max, and Erica had snuck through Nancy's bedroom window and were biking away, with Erica sticking the cop car tire with a pocket knife. Karen bolted out into the street and was joined by the other adults as they helplessly watched the kids bike away.\n\nAt night, Hawkins began to shake as a result of Vecna successfully opening four gates. At the Wheeler home, Holly screamed as she clutched onto a chair while picture frames fell off the chimney and broke. Karen ran out, yelling Holly's name as she got down on the ground and clutched her daughter, the two rocking back and forth until the Gates met at town square and caused a shock-wave crescendo.\n\nTwo days after Vecna's success, the opening of the Gate was reported to be a massive \"earthquake\", though it had left Hawkins destroyed, with many residents dead or missing. Those who survived were filing out of Hawkins permanently, the Wheelers included, as Karen had begun packing and having Nancy, Dustin, Steve, and Robin bring donations to Hawkins High. As Karen brought out Nancy's old toys, Ted informed her that the news believed the earthquake was a \"doorway to Hell\" stemming from Eddie Munson's murder spree. Karen sarcastically remarked that hysteria was just what Hawkins needed. She walked out through the door and told Nancy that she found some more stuff of hers in the attic. She noticed Nancy looking sentimental as she picked up Mr. Rabbit, telling her it'd be alright if she saved him, but Nancy said he would be more loved in a new home. Karen then asked if someone ordered pizza as a Surfer Boy Pizza van pulled up to the house. As it stopped, Karen was shocked when Mike, Eleven, Will, Jonathan, and the group's new friend Argyle stepped out. Mike called out to his mother as Karen ran to him and hugged him tightly. Catching her breath, she told Mike that he would never go on vacation again and could forget about college since he was staying put with her. Mike smiled as they hugged tighter.\n\nThat afternoon, Holly called for her mother by gleefully telling her it was beginning to snow. However, Karen held her daughter in concern as the clouds began to darken, and the \"snow\" was actually particles coming from the opening Gates, the Upside Down beginning its invasion.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nOn the surface, Karen is shown to be the stereotypical superficial upper-middle class housewife. She and Ted purely married out of convenience, with her youth and Ted's wealthy background being the main pillars of why they started a family. Karen grows frustrated over Ted's apathy towards their children, being tone-deaf when there's tension and leaving Karen to pick up the pieces. It's hinted that Karen was once like Nancy, hoping to break the status quo and defy what people told her to do, but caved into tradition from societal pressure. As a mother, Karen aches for her two older children to open up to her, though due to the supernatural evil they fight on a daily basis, Nancy and Mike understandably hide the truth from their mother. But for smaller, manageable problems - Nancy experiencing sexism while working at the Hawkins Post or Mike grieving over his best friend's \"death\" - that Karen can handle, Nancy and Mike have a strong relationship with their mother. Karen tells Nancy that she's a fighter, encouraging her to investigate and prove to the people above her wrong. Karen loves to baby Mike, loving to take pictures of him dressed up for Halloween or for the Snow Ball, much to Mike's annoyance.\n\nUpon meeting Billy Hargrove, Karen increasingly grows tired of Ted's laziness, and almost cheats on him when Billy invites her to a motel for \"swimming lessons\". However, seeing Ted sleeping with Holly on his lap makes her realize that she couldn't hurt her family and restrains herself. However, she still remains begrudgingly annoyed at Ted's continued attitude.\n\nUnlike most of the children's parents, Karen is aware that something suspicious is occurring, but it's both her husband and pure luck that causes her to miss the truth. She discovers strands of Eleven's wig in their basement, and becomes hysterical when agents arrive saying that Mike had been harboring an experiment in their basement. As they leave to search for their son, Karen voices her suspicion of the lead agent, Martin Brenner, and asking if Nancy was involved with Mike as well, but Ted simply told her that they needed to \"trust the government\". It's not truly until particles fall from the sky that Karen's suspicions are confirmed.\n\nDespite her lavish lifestyle, Karen never looks down on her children's friends and her peers. Despite Joyce Byers being lower-class, Karen considers her a good friend and an equal, baking her a casserole and comforting her when her son, Will, is missing. She also treats Mike and Nancy's friends like they're family, feeding them and letting them sleepover in their basement, glaring at Ted when he makes snide remarks at them.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nFamilial[]\n\nHer daughter, Nancy has alluded that Karen mainly married Ted due to being from a well-made family rather than actual love. This has been evident throughout the series, since Karen is shown to be the main caretaker for the kids while Ted simply works, eats, and sleeps. When Will goes missing, Karen, Nancy, and Mike get in an argument during dinner about restricting going out at night. Karen looks for Ted for back-up, only for him to yell at the kids for swearing. When Nancy and Mike storm off in anger, Karen glares at him, takes Holly, says, \"I hope you're enjoying your chicken, Ted.\", and leaves, causing Ted to yell, \"What I'd do?\" Despite this, when Will's body is discovered at the quarry, Ted comforts a distraught Karen as they watch the news. When government agents arrive looking for Mike, Ted comforts an angered Karen, believing they should look for him, but Ted says that they should trust the government. One year later, their marriage has been more or less the same. When Dustin arrives at the Wheeler home asking where Nancy and Mike are, Ted asks Karen (while she is on the phone) the same question, while she annoyingly yells back that they're each sleeping over at friend's houses. One night, while Karen has a bubble bath and listening to music, the doorbell rings. She yells for Ted to answer it, but he is asleep in the living room in his chair, much to her anger. But her anger melts when she answers the door to find the handsome Billy. Six months later, Karen's lust for the boy has erupted fully, to the point where she is about to take up Billy's offer for \"swimming lessons\" at the local motel. But before she leaves for the night, she sees Ted sleeping is his chair with Holly in his lap. Realizing her selfish desires, Karen resists her sexual urges. On the fourth of July, she and Ted take Holly to the local Fun Fair, where they watch the fireworks show on top of the Ferris Wheel. Later on, when they get off Gravitron and see Joyce and Hopper sprinting while holding hands, Karen comments to Ted how they make an odd couple, but Ted says, \"You know what they say, someone for everyone.\" Putting his arm around her, Karen sighs in annoyance.\n\nNancy is Karen's eldest daughter. Overall, they have a typical mother-daughter relationship that's somewhat strained, due to Nancy's teenage phase of rebellion. When Karen called off Nancy and Mike leaving the house after dark when Will disappears, Nancy lashes out at her and says it's \"Bullshit!\". The next night, however, Nancy butters up her mother by saying the dinner is delicious and that she and her best friend Barbara Holland were attending a ceremony at the high school for Will, when in reality, they were going to a party at Steve Harrington's house. Karen reminds her she doesn't want her out too late, but Nancy says it would be awkward since everyone is going. Karen reluctantly tells her to be back by 10:00. At Steve's party, Nancy drinks, swims in the pool alongside Steve and his friends, and eventually loses her virginity to him, but ends up missing her curfew. When sneaking into the house, Karen, in her robe, furiously scolds Nancy for disobeying her due to Will disappearing, but Nancy lies and says she lost track of time because she went to get a bite to eat after the ceremony. When Nancy goes upstairs, Karen asks who's jacket Nancy is wearing, to which Nancy says Steve gave it to her. Karen then asks if Steve is her boyfriend, and Nancy says it was cold and Steve gave it to her. Karen, sensing something, says Nancy can talk to her, but Nancy enunciates that nothing happened and quickly leaves. The next day, Nancy can't find Barb, who has mysteriously disappeared, and when investigating Steve's house, she comes across some sort of creature and sprints home. At the Wheelers, Karen is cooking when Nancy arrives in tears, admitting that something terrible happened the other night. When the two are being interviewed by the police, Nancy admits to attending the party at Steve's but lies that they simply just talked in his room. But when arriving back home, Karen yells at Nancy for lying to police and questions her story, causing an enraged Nancy to admit that she slept with Steve but it doesn't matter since it has nothing to due with Barbara being missing and that nobody is listening to her. Karen yanks back Nancy by the arm and says that she's listening, but Nancy says she isn't and tells her to leave her alone, storming off to her room, leaving Karen in tears. The next day, when the Wheelers prepare to attend Will's funeral, Karen helps Nancy get dressed, commenting how nice she looks and offers her shoes to borrow, but Nancy politely declines. The next morning, Karen finds Nancy's door locked, and after picking it with a pin, she finds Nancy gone with her window open. She is seen phoning Mrs. Harrington about her and Steve being together. Later on, when government agents arrive searching for Mike, Karen raises concern about whether or not Nancy could be involved as well, but Ted tells her Nancy never hangs around with Mike and she shouldn't worry about her. Outside, a worried Nancy attempts to go to her house to help her parents, but Hopper restrains her. That night, she and Karen reunite, where they and the rest of the gang go to the hospital to see Will, who was rescued. The next month, she is shown to allow Steve to spend Christmas Eve with Nancy. A year later, Nancy's relationship with Karen has improved, although she still has no qualms lying to her, as one morning she lies to her mother that she's sleeping over at a friend's house, when in reality, she was teaming up with Jonathan to shut down Hawkins lab to avenge Barbara. Six months later, Nancy, having been fired from The Hawkins Post after following a story she was told to drop, cries in her room. Karen eventually gets her out and they talk in the kitchen. Karen tells her that while most people give up after being beaten by the world, Nancy isn't like that and that she's always been a fighter. With tears in her eyes, she admits she doesn't know where she gets it from, to which Nancy jokes she gets it from her father, causing the two to laugh. Karen says she thinks she was switched at the hospital, but Nancy sweetly tells her she gets it from her. Karen then says that wherever she gets it from, she's proud of her for standing up to those \"shitheads\", shocking Nancy. She then tells her that if she believes in this story, then she should finish it and give it a larger newspaper. The two then share a tearful hug. Eight months later, Nancy is now a senior, with Karen slightly miffed about her and Mike's attitudes. When Nancy and Mike's friends begin to sleep over at their house, Karen comments how sweet it is how Nancy and them are sticking together. The next day, when a third victim of a Hawkins killing spree causes the town to target the Hellfire Club, Karen and the other parents rush to the Wheeler house to find the kids. Karen grows frantic over Nancy's whereabouts, calling the police to find her. When Nancy is placed in a trance by Vecna, she shakily and tearfully tells her friends how he showed her Karen, Mike, and Holly being killed by creatures of the Upside Down, determined to kill Vecna once and for all. Two days later, Nancy is reunited and helps Karen donate their belongings to the Red Cross to help the other townspeople.\n\nMike is Karen's only son. On the night Will goes missing, Karen kicks out Mike's friends after a D&D campaign, much to the opposition of her son. She tells him they can finish the next day, and is shocked when Mike admits they have been playing for ten hours. The next day, after Will is reported missing, Karen and Mike argue at the dinner table about looking for Will. Karen puts an end to it by saying nobody leaves the house after dark. Angered by how emotionally distant the rest of his family is, Mike storms off. The following morning, Mike skips school to take care of Eleven, but it comes to a halt when Karen and Holly arrive home with groceries. When she hears footsteps upstairs, Mike says it's him and he'll be downstairs. After hiding Eleven in his closet, Mike lies that he felt sick, but Karen tells him that she's not upset, believing the reason he skipped was because of Will's disappearance. She then comforts her son, saying that she wants him to feel like he can talk to her and never has to feel like he has to hide anything from her. The next day, Will's fake body is discovered at the quarry. Mike, distraught, bikes home. When he arrives through the door, Karen asks him what's wrong. Mike, with tears in his eyes, simply runs into the arms of his mother, and the two embrace silently. Later, as Karen and Ted watch the news, Ted asks her if he should talk to Mike, but Karen says he'll talk to them when he's ready. That morning, Karen checks in on Mike in bed to see how he is. Mike says he doesn't feel like he can go to school. Karen says that's okay and that she has to run a few errands, encouraging him to tag along with her and rent a movie, even R-rated. But Mike says he'd feel better at home. Karen eventually agrees, kisses him, and leaves. When government agents arrives in the neighborhood searching for the kids, Mike notices a Hawkins Power and Light van outside. He sprints to the kitchen, interrupting his mother on the phone, asking if anything needs to be prepared. Dustin and Mike, realizing that the van is from the lab, leave. Karen yells after him, but Mike yells, \"If anyone asks where I am, I've left the country!\", leaving Karen standing in confusion. After they have left, Karen investigates the basement, coming across a fort made of blankets with strands of blonde hair. But her investigation is cut short when Dr. Martin Brenner arrives alongside agents at the door, wanting to investigate her son's whereabouts. When Connie Frazier says that Mike has been holding an escaped experiment in their basement for the last few days, Karen becomes distraught and in tears. It's not until Brenner tells them they can make sure Mike is safe is she and Ted cooperate. After they leave, Karen says they should be outside looking for Mike, but Ted says they need to trust the government. Despite this, Karen and Ted drive down to the middle school, where they find Mike unharmed but emotional due to El's disappearance. Karen, in tears, grabs him and hugs him tightly, saying he's okay. Later that evening, she takes him to see a rescued Will at the local hospital. A year later, Mike has begun acting out frequently and getting punished. After stealing some money from Nancy for the arcade, Karen tells him he needs to fill two boxes of toys for the yard sale as punishment. While she tells Mike that she and Ted understand he's had a difficult year, but they've grown impatient. On Halloween, Karen excitedly takes pictures of a annoyed Mike in his Ghostbusters costume. Two months later, Karen excitedly takes pictures of a well-dressed but once again annoyed Mike in his outfit for the Snowball Dance. Six months later, Karen eavesdrops on the phone while Mike talks to El. When Mike lies that he can't see El because his Nana is deathly sick, Karen says \"WHAT?\" into the phone. Mike, realizing his mother is on the phone, yells upstairs for her to get off the phone. She asks if Nana had called, to which Mike repeats his command for her to get off the phone. Karen, annoyed, obeys and disconnects. Three months later, Mike comes home, depressed that Will and Eleven have moved out of Hawkins. Karen, noticing, stops cooking and hugs Mike tightly. In the spring of 1986, Karen sends Mike to California to see El and Will for Spring Break, but is somewhat apprehensive of him being the school's D&D club, the Hellfire Club, which is perceived as a Satanic cult. When Mike returns in tow with Jonathan, Will, El, and Argyle, Karen runs to him and tearfully hugs her son. She tells him he's never going on vacation again and he can forget about college since he's staying right with her.\n\nHolly is Karen's second daughter and youngest child. Like her other children, Karen is the primary caretaker for Holly rather than Ted, often seen feeding her, carrying her, holding her, or comforting her. When arguing with her other two children at the dinner table over the curfew, Holly is visibly emotional from the loudness. After Nancy storms off, Karen comforts her daughter and distracts her with her juice. The next day, Karen takes Holly to run some errands and returns home, asking Holly if she'd like pizza and some macaroni for dinner. When surprising Joyce at her house with a casserole, Karen brings Holly with her. As the two mothers talk, Holly follows the flickering Christmas lights leading to Will's room, and witnesses a monster attempting to break through the wall. Joyce, noticing Holly missing, grabs her in time and tells Karen she shouldn't be in there. Karen apologizes, jokingly saying she's quite the explorer these days. When Holly tells her mother and Joyce she saw something in the wall, Karen is unsurprisingly confused.\n\nNearly two years later in 1985, Karen has grown bored of her marriage and now lusts for Billy at the town community pool alongside her friends, all while Holly plays in the pool. When Billy flirts with Karen and offers her some \"free swimming lessons\" at the local motel later that night, Karen accepts. Later that evening, after putting on make-up and dressing up, Karen hesitates to leave when she sees Holly and Ted sleeping together on a chair in the living room. Realizing her selfishness, Karen restraints her lustfulness. The next day, when noticing a disheveled Billy stumbling into the pool backroom, Karen asks one of her friends to watch Holly. Karen, believing Billy to be upset for blowing him off, explains that while she understands his anger, she states that she has a family and doesn't want to anything that will hurt them. A few days later, Karen and Ted take Holly to the Fourth of July fair, watching the firework show on top of the carousel. When Holly notices trees rustling mysteriously, Holly nervously tells her mother, but Karen asks why she's staring at the trees when she should look at the firework show.\n\nBy the spring of 1986, Karen is concerned about her children's safety due to a murder spree plaguing Hawkins, taking Holly to the town meeting to see what to do about the situation. When a sudden earthquake shakes Hawkins, Holly screams as Karen runs to her, calling her name and hugging her tightly as the house rumbles. Two days later, Holly calls for her mother and tells her it's snowing, but Karen realizes it's mysterious particles and begins to grow concerned.\n\nNon-Familial[]\n\nDue to their children being best friends with one another, Karen and Joyce are on friendly terms. When Will goes missing, Karen shows concern for him and sympathy for Joyce. One day, she brings Holly with her to surprise Joyce with a casserole at her house. When arriving at the Byers, the inside is strewn with Christmas lights all over and Joyce is a distraught mess, but Karen nonetheless treats Joyce kind. As they wait for the casserole to cook, Joyce explains she put the lights up because Will loved Christmas and that she thought it would make him feel closer, saying it's silly, but Karen quickly comforts her and says it's not. She then takes Joyce's hand and tells her that she and Ted are here for her if she and Jonathan need anything, causing Joyce to smile. With the casserole ready, Joyce suddenly notices Holly missing. Discovering Holly in Will's room, Joyce snatches her and brings her to Karen, saying she shouldn't be in there. Holly then says something came out of the wall, causing Joyce to thank Karen for the casserole but that the two of them need to leave. Karen, confused, sighs and obeys her command. That night, when Will's fake body is discovered, Karen is shown to be deeply upset, and later attends the funeral along with her family. After the real Will is rescued, Karen is shown sitting in the waiting room alongside the others. In 1985, Joyce calls Karen while stopping at a 7-Eleven in Illinois, asking if Will is alright. A few days later, at the Fun Fair, Joyce and Hopper, trying to find the kids, see Karen, Ted, and Holly climbing into the fair's Gravitron. Joyce calls for her, where Karen happily greets her and says she looks great. After getting off, Joyce and Hopper soon flee after Russians begin to corner them. Karen, seeing the two run while holding hands, comments to Ted how they make an odd couple. In the spring of 1986, despite not seeing each other physically, Karen trusts Joyce to allow Mike to spend his Spring Break in California.\n\nDespite their limited interactions, Karen treats Jonathan kindly. When picking up Will from a D&D game at the Wheelers, Karen greets him and wishes him and his mother a merry Christmas. A year later, when he arrives at the Wheelers alongside Nancy, Karen greets him and asks how he is. She even allows him to work with Nancy when he says they have to study for a test.\n\nWhen Dr. Martin Brenner and crew from Hawkins Lab arrive searching for Mike, Karen became extremely distraught. Brenner stepped in and said while her son is in danger, he can alleviate the situation by Karen and Ted's cooperation, to which Karen reluctantly agrees. When they leave, Karen comments that Brenner gives her the creeps.\n\nWhen Billy arrives at the Wheeler home searching for his stepsister Max, Karen (wearing a robe from taking a bath) gets the door and is stunned by him. His charm and opened shirt causes Karen to become infatuated with the boy, giving him directions to the Byers and cookies. As he leaves, Karen checks out his behind and sighs in relief. Six months later, Karen and her group of friends go to the community pool frequently to check out Billy, who is now a lifeguard and is often flirting with them, particularly Karen, complimenting her bathing suit and ogling at her while she swims in the pool. One afternoon, Billy offers Karen some \"swimming lessons\" at a nearby hotel, saying it will be \"the workout of her life\". That night, Karen prepares to leave, putting on makeup and taking off her wedding ring. But before she leaves, she hears Ted snoring and notices him napping in his chair with Holly in his lap, causing Karen to restrain herself. Meanwhile, Billy travels to the hotel in his car, laughing to himself, until he is attacked by an unknown force and becoming possessed. The next morning, Karen sees a sweaty and disheveled Billy heading into the pool closet. She soon follows him and apologizes to him, saying that she understands if he is upset with her, but she has a family and doesn't want to hurt them. Billy, holding back the force wanting to kill Karen, tells her to stay away from him and quickly leaves, leaving Karen startled. It can be assumed she was saddened by his death on the Fourth of July.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nSeason One appearances The Vanishing of Will Byers The Weirdo on Maple Street Holly, Jolly The Body The Flea and the Acrobat The Monster The Bathtub The Upside Down\n\nSeason Two appearances MADMAX Trick or Treat, Freak The Pollywog Will the Wise Dig Dug The Spy* The Lost Sister The Mind Flayer The Gate\n\nSeason Three appearances Suzie, Do You Copy?
