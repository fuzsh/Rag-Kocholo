        "text": "Jazzie B, producer and rapper\n\nEverything about this single was magic. We weren’t trying to follow any trend or fit into any category – we were just doing our own thing. We’d originally done Back to Life a cappella on our album Club Classics Vol One, so we reworked it and released it as a quick follow-up to Keep on Movin’, which had gone to No 5 in the UK singles chart. It went to No 1.\n\nIts shuffling beats were a cross between reggae and what was to become known as hip-hop: breakbeats and electronic sound. Caron Wheeler’s vocal, coming over these very heavy bass beats, was the icing on the cake. Before this, she wasn’t really recognised as a singer, so it was a real platform for her. Sometimes you put two and one together and you get eight, don’t you? We also had the Reggae Philharmonic Orchestra on the track, and the RPO became a key part of our sound. Ellen Blair, one of its violinists, still performs with me.\n\nWe often look to America for our influences, but this was a moment that put British music back on the map. It also came out at a special time in the industry’s history – just before digital took over and everything seemed to fall apart.\n\nAs a DJ, I steer away from playing Back to Life, but when I recently put it on the turntable I was amazed at the response. For the first time, I felt proud to have been part of something that has become timeless.\n\nCaron Wheeler, singer\n\nI came to Soul II Soul by chance. We were round at Jazzie B’s house and someone put on an album I had done vocals and arrangements on. When Jazzie B heard my voice, he invited me to back Do’reen Wadell on the Soul II Soul track Feel Free. After that, I was given the lead vocal on Keep on Movin’. It started out as disco, but I slowed it down because I felt the words were flying by and the meaning was being lost.\n\nThe arrangement for Back to Life came after Arabella Rodriquez, the sound engineer, and I were playing back the tapes. She thought if we brought the funky beats in before the bridge, almost at the start when it’s just me singing, it would sound better. Jazzie and our producer Nellie Hooper walked into the room at that exact moment and said: “Right, let’s do it.”\n\nBefore Back to Life, I’d been singing for Elvis Costello and Phil Collins, but I felt like a bit of a traitor because my influences were the likes of the Emotions and Marvin Gaye. I wanted to break out. I was quite a secret soul head, and hadn’t dared tell anyone, but with this I really found myself."
