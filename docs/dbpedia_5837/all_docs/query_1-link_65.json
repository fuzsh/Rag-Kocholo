        "text": "By: Wheeler’s Community Justice Unit\n\nResearch By:\n\nChristina Caron, Middletown AIC Senior Intervention Specialist\n\nAmbyr Michaud, Bristol AIC Case Manager\n\nLindsey Tomlinson, Enfield AIC Intervention Specialist\n\nIntimate partner violence (IPV)—often aggravated by external events—has moved to forefront during the COVID-19 outbreak, as families and partners spend more time together at home, struggling with the tensions and mental health impact of job loss, food and other forms of economic insecurity, health-related fears, and isolation. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines intimate partner violence as physical or sexual violence, as well as psychological harm by a current or former partner or spouse. About 1 in 4 women, including a disproportionate number of ethnic and racial minorities, and nearly 1 in 10 men have experienced IPV and its related impact during their lifetime. When struggling financially, individuals may be more likely to stay in an unsafe relationship and willing to sacrifice their own safety to have food, clothing, or shelter for their children.\n\nBecause of this pandemic, most of us are feeling powerless over much of our lives; however, people who do not manage this feeling or seek to regain a sense of control may take it out on others, using the current conditions as leverage to further isolate, coerce, or increase fear in their relationships. Add to this mix an increase of substance use in the home and the powerful link between substance use and 40 to 60 percent of IPV incidents.\n\nWhat you can do\n\nIf you or a loved one live in a home where there is a threat—or incidences of—intimate partner violence, here are some strategies and resources.\n\nEstablish a safety plan for you and your children. Connect with a local domestic violence resource such as CTSafeConnect.com or call 888-774-2900. Advocates are available 24/7 and will work with you to assess your situation and create a safety plan to help minimize risks and protect you and your children from harm. Create code words with your children to communicate if they or you need help, or if they just need space. The links below provide more information about safety plan development.\n\nMaking a Safety Plan\n\nInteractive Safety Planning Guide\n\nPath to Safety\n\nKeep your cell phone and electronics charged, and tuck away local domestic violence hotlines and emergency numbers. Statewide phone numbers and resources are included at the end of this article. In case of an emergency, it's best to call 9-1-1.\n\nAssemble a “go bag” in the event you and/or your children need to flee your home quickly. Consider personal and other items needed for the short- and longer-term. Prepare in advance for a situation where an abuser might hide essential supplies such as soap or toothpaste.\n\nFind a safe space where you can reach out to others. Stay out of sight and ear range of an abusive partner if you need to connect with resources such as CTSafeConnect. Make sure that your safe space does not include objects that could be used during an argument, for example, items in your kitchen and bathroom.\n\nConnect with providers via telehealth. While many providers (including Wheeler) are minimizing in-person services, telehealth and telephonic support are widely available. Call our Navigation Center to access care and support at 860.793.3500 or toll-free, 888.793.3500.\n\nContinue to connect with support networks and speak to people whom you trust. There are many options to remotely connect with friends, family, and clergy members, including Skype, Zoom, and Facebook. The more that family and friends are involved and aware of what is happening, the more support they can provide.\n\nCreate distance, when possible. Go to another room, take a walk, or watch a tv show. Go outside. Spend time at a nearby park. Take advantage of opportunities to run errands, while maintaining appropriate social distancing.\n\nAvoid difficult conversations. It may be hard to discuss problems when confined to smaller spaces in the home. Employ strategies to diffuse anger. If the anger originates from someone else, quickly exit the interaction, when necessary and possible. Change the subject or leave the room for a few minutes. Avoid triggers, if you can.\n\nTake care of yourself. Earlier this year, experts from across Wheeler shared strategies for self-care during this crisis, from managing your health, to navigating grief and anxiety, to living with your spouse and talking with your children about COVID-19. Click here for related stories, tips, and information.\n\nKnow that you are not alone. There are several local and national resources, including Wheeler, 888.793.3500. During this pandemic, the CARES Act, recently signed into law, ensures emergency funds for intimate partner violence survivors and programs that support them. This funding allows domestic violence programs to quickly house and support vulnerable survivors and provides funding for Emergency Solutions Grants and other housing resources. It also supports the National Domestic Violence Hotline, a crucial lifeline during the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nIntimate partner violence is devastating in any circumstance, and it is particularly distressing and dangerous during this period. Help is available. You can protect yourself and your children now and moving forward.
