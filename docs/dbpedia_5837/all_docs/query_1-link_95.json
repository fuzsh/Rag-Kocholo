        "text": "Review\n\nThere are different theories on when the Hits series jumped the shark and stopped becoming a serious contender to its Now That’s What I Call Music rival. For some, the lack of a number on The Hits Album 9 was a sure sign that they couldn’t be bothered. For others, the rebrand to Monster Hits was the moment. I disagree with both opinions and have a load of affection for both Hits 9 and the two Monster Hits releases. No – it was The Hit Pack that done it. The album barely reached the shops in time for Christmas and it was only a single CD with cassette buyers benefiting from three additional tracks. I don’t believe the vinyl version exists. And if that wasn’t bad enough, the compilers decide to mix the tracks so there are no gaps between them and the end of the previous song can be heard when the next one starts. Not good for shuffle play.\n\nThe opening track is amazing: Deee-lite’s Groove Is In The Heart (Peanut Butter Mix). The shorter take with the rapper. The best one to dance to. It’s followed by Black Box’s remodel of Earth, Wind and Fire’s Fantasy which segues into Snap’s seasonal groover Mary Had A Little Lamb. Next up is Caron Wheeler’s lost house classic Livin’ In The Light while the dance sequence continues with Seal and the perennial space jam Crazy. A quick nod to Madchester: The Charlatans third 45 Then. The swirling organ sound remains intact, the 12″ was mispressed and we drove like maniacs to see them woo The Top Hat in November 1990. Staying Mancunian then – it’s 808 State’s rave belter Cubik. Mantra for a state of mind. The promotional video showed them with their own Bez.\n\n“The past is steeped in shame,\n\nBut tomorrow’s fair game”.\n\nThe late late breakfast show: Aztec Camera joined forces with Mick Jones for the scathing criticism of Good Morning Britain. Politics with melody. Time for The Obvious Child, Paul Simon’s lead track from the underrated Rhythm Of The Saints. Super drums. Gazza and Lindisfarne crash the party with the hoary Fog On The Tyne. England were the best side at World Cup 1990 but came a cropper on penalties against the West Germans. The groove continues with Twenty 4 Seven featuring Captain Hollywood’s likeable hip hop sound of Are You Dreaming. I finally got to see Prince play live in 1990. Cork in July, inexplicably supported by Stockon’s Wing and Mavis Staples. Thieves In The Temple was the main highlight of the rather difficult soundtrack to The Graffiti Bridge.\n\nOne for the hipsters – Del Amitri’s Spit In The Rain, their ode to lost love. We stay in Scotland for The Proclaimers’ low-key cover of King Of The Road. There’s a nice nod to Tom Cruise with the next pair: Maria McKee’s show-stopping ballad Show Me Heaven from Days Of Thunder. Dusty summer days in Minch Norton with this on the radio. 25 years on and it still packs a massive emotional punch. Meanwhile Berlin’s Take My Breath Away was re-released in the UK during October 1990 to coincide with the first television showing of Top Gun as well as Peugeot’s new television advertising campaign for the 405 model range. This time around it reached #3 in the charts.\n\nDeacon Blue had a period of consolidation in 1990 with the release of the Four Bacharach And David Songs EP. Their version of I’ll Never Fall In Love Again is lovely and was held off the top spot by Timmy Mallett and Bombalurina. Another track to get a reissue in 1990 was Bobby Vinton’s cover of Blue Velvet. David Lynch-wise, it was also the year of Wild And Heart and on the small screen, Twin Peaks. Julee Cruise’s Falling is wonderful and haunting; a perfect accompaniment to the strange goings-on. Sandwiched between Blue Velvet and Falling are A-ha and their atmospheric cover of The Everly Brothers’ Crying In The Rain. Closing time – New Kids On The Block’s endearing slow/fast Tonight.\n\nFavourite tracks\n\nDeee-lite – Groove Is In The Heart (Peanut Butter Mix)\n\nPaul Simon – The Obvious Child (Single Mix)\n\nMaria McKee – Show Me Heaven\n\nLest we forget\n\nAztec Camera and Mick Jones – Good Morning Britain\n\nMissing tracks and other thoughts\n\nDespite everything, The Hit Pack is an enjoyable trip. The opening dance sequence is excellent while the leftfield choices are thoughtfully dotted throughout. The run of tracks from Spit In The Rain to Falling is particularly moody. However just giving us one CD was a crazy idea and screamed of skimping and cheapness. The cassette had three extra tracks – The Chimes’ Heaven, Dimples D’s Sucker DJ and More by The Sisters Of Mercy. I’d have added a further six to bring the total to an even 30 and enough for a fatbox:\n\nMadonna – Hanky Panky. Some breathless action.\n\nJanet Jackson – Black Cat. Superb Rhythm Nation 45.\n\nGeorge Michael – Praying For Time. Deathless ballad.\n\nLondonbeat – I’ve Been Thinking About You. Hopelessly devoted to you.\n\nAC/DC – Thunderstruck. Rarely licensed but we can dream.\n\nWedding Present – (Make Me Smile) Come Up And See. Dang dang dang.\n\nAnd sequenced it like so:\n\nDisc 1\n\nMadonna – Hanky Panky\n\nDeee-lite – Groove Is In The Heart (Peanut Butter Mix)\n\n808 State – Cubik (Original Mix)\n\nBlack Box – Fantasy\n\nSnap – Mary Had A Little Lamb\n\nThe Chimes – Heaven\n\nDimples D – Sucker DJ\n\nCaron Wheeler – Livin’ In The Light\n\nSeal – Crazy\n\nJanet Jackson – Black Cat\n\nTwenty Four Seven featuring Captain Hollywood – Are You Dreaming (Radio Edit)\n\nPrince – Thieves In The Temple (Album Version)\n\nLondonbeat – I’ve Been Thinking About You\n\nGeorge Michael – Praying For Time\n\nNew Kids On The Block – Tonight\n\nDisc 2\n\nAC/DC – Thunderstruck\n\nWedding Present – (Make Me Smile) Come Up And See Me\n\nSisters Of Mercy – More\n\nCharlatans – Then\n\nAztec Camera and Mick Jones – Good Morning Britain\n\nPaul Simon – The Obvious Child (Single Mix)\n\nGazza and Lindesfarne – Fog On The Tyne (Revisited)\n\nDel Amitri – Spit In The Rain\n\nProclaimers – King Of The Road\n\nMaria McKee – Show Me Heaven\n\nBerlin – Take My Breath Away\n\nDeacon Blue – I’ll Never Fall In Love Again\n\nBobby Vinton – Blue Velvet\n\nA-ha – Crying In The Rain (LP Version)\n\nJulee Cruise – Falling (Edit)"
