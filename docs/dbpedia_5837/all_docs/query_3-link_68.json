        "text": "Where we discuss crap backing singers and unlikely backing singers.\n\nI was listening to Soft Cell the other day and on came Torch, which I quite like. But by Christ, that woman singer on the track is diabolical. Who was she? Was she ever allowed to record again?\n\nAlso I always remember some of Dee C Lee's vocals for The Style Council being very suspect (but she was fit as fuck in the 80s).\n\nAs for unlikely backing singers:\n\n* Kid Creole's Cocunuts on U2's War (could someone check this for me?)\n\n* Carol Vorderman singing with Dawn Chorus & The Blue Tits\n\n* Mick Jagger on You're So Vain\n\nThe backing singers thread\n\nI think the backing singer on 'Torch' was Cindy Ecstasy - essentially Soft Cell's drugs dealer at the time. She also did the 'rap' in the middle of 'Memorabilia' - the first E-driven acid/trance anthem about 8 years before the scene really exploded. Soft Cell spent quite some time in New York on the club scene around the time of their first album, I understand, and the E they were all taking was really strong compared to what was going around the clubs at the end of the decade. It was apparently what inspired 'Memorabilia'.\n\n(Their extra keyboard player for live stuff at the time was Brian Moss, who went on to form Vicious Pink (Phenomena) and later Drug Free America, with Steve Dixon, who was doing production work for Soft Cell around the same time as Moss was doing live synths. Just so you know, like!)\n\nAnyway...\n\nMy favourite bit of 'unlikely backing singer' triv (which I've mentioned here before) is how it's Nina Hagen and Lene Lovich doing the vocals on Cerrone's 'Supernature'. Not backing vocals, strictly speaking, but somehow they don't feel like lead vocal, either. I blame Kenny Everett and Hot Gossip. Lovich is credited with co-writing the track, I believe.\n\nThe backing singers thread\n\nRe. \"Torch\": she was Cindy Ecstasy, who was Soft Cell's E dealer. (E hadn't properly arrived in the UK yet, but Soft Cell had tried it in New York, and were ahead of the curve.)\n\nDee C Lee was a great singer, you loon.\n\nA few bleeding obvious before-they-were-famous backing singers:\n\nLuther Vandross on Bowie's \"Young Americans\"\n\nAntony Hegarty on Lou Reed's early noughties stuff\n\nMadonna on Patrick Hernandez's \"Born To Be Alive\" (not so widely-known, that one).\n\nThe backing singers thread\n\nI didn't know Caron Wheeler was in Afrodiziak.\n\nAfrodiziak crack me up. They were to the early-mid 80s what the My Life Story orchestra were to the mid 90s: wheeled in by every Tom, Dick & Harry who wanted to give their record (and their ToTP appearance) a lick of, respectively, 'soul' or 'class'.\n\nCarol Kenyon's vocal on \"Temptation\" is, of course, utterly storming. It's amazing that she never really made a name for herself as a solo star."
