        "text": "Post by Deleted on\n\nThis is my favorite song by them. It's their debut single, released in 1989, featuring Caron Wheeler's vocals, just like \"Back To Life\".\n\nThe feel to this song is just amazing, really upbeat, but not overvocalised.\n\nThe Billboard Hot 100: #11\n\nHot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks: #1\n\nHot Dance Music/Club Play: #1\n\nIt hit #5 in the UK.\n\nPost by jlh527 on\n\nI really liked both single and \"Keep On Movin\" was just as impactful as \"Back To Life\" which is now a classic. I get excited each and everytime one of these songs are played ojn the radio.\n\nPost by stevie nice on\n\njond7699 said:\n\nThis is exactly what I was thinking\n\nAnd if I may 3rd that (or 2nd) or whatever, I think Frankie Crocker broke this song in the US months before its release here. The mix with the violin break towards the last 2 minutes of the song is totally hott. \"Back To Life\" tho, was one of those songs that in my neighborhood at least, it didn't matter what style of music you preferred, you loved that song. Me and my friend Ian saw them perform at, I think, their first US appearance at the Palladium during the summer these songs broke. Skyy and damm!! I forget the name of the other band that performed and someone here will know, club act whos first song was called \"Devotion\" and Byron Stingley was the vocalist. I can't believe I forgot their name, either Ten City or Inner City, but he also worked with Marshall Jefferson who did THE original House Music anthem and did a pretty good remake of Sylvester's \"You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real.)\"\n\nPost by stevie nice on\n\nI would have just edited my first post to include this, but I just went thru my CDs to find their first 2 discs and Caron Wheelers solo debut which I have on CD, and you got yourself a nice compilation of late 80's-1990 pop soul music.\n\nDebut disc with the 2 hits plus \"African Dance\" \"Fairplay\" and Jazzie's Groove\" (although I think album version is not the popular version, but especially the song \"A Dream Is A Dream\" from their followup album, which is as good as the first 2 singles but didn't get the recognition it deserved. Wheeler's \"UK Blak\" and \"I Adore You\" were also awesome pop-r&b tracks IMHO.\n\nPost by krazymack on\n\nI used to LOVE this song!!!!!! But like everyone was saying \"Back 2 Life,\" was even better. These were the days when we had some great soulful music, today the Urban scene seems a little watered down to me.\n\nPost by Whi$tlin' Pete on\n\nI was anxious for this song to debut in the top 40. Why? I wanted to hear it because it was certified gold before it reached the Top 40. I figured it was a special tune for that accomplishment. I recall that \"Back To Life' had a very early gold certification. Both songs went platinum.\n\nPost by 620 Soul Train on\n\nIn the summer of 1989 the song spent 8 weeks at number one on my charts! I was one of the first people in my town Rapid City, SD to own the 12\" single. Speaking of that I was just listening to the Teddy Riley remix in my car the other day. If any of you are interested you can find it on the Smooth Grooves After Hours Cool Down CD.\n\nPost by Deuce on\n\nstevienice said:\n\nI forget the name of the other band that performed and someone here will know, club act whos first song was called \"Devotion\" and Byron Stingley was the vocalist. I can't believe I forgot their name, either Ten City or Inner City, but he also worked with Marshall Jefferson who did THE original House Music anthem and did a pretty good remake of Sylvester's \"You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real.)\"\n\nIt's Ten City. \"Devotion\" was also the basis for one of my favorite early house songs, Nomad feat. MC Mikee Freedom \"(I Wanna Give You) Devotion\". Ten City's best song is without a doubt \"That's The Way Love Is\", a classic deep house song.\n\n\"Keep On Movin'\" did nothing for me. \"Back To Life (However Do You Want Me)\" is their best song, bar none. A great combination of Northern Soul, Pop, and House Music. They really don't make it like this anymore.\n\nFrom their second album, \"Get A Life\" is my favorite song."
