        "text": "Richard X Presents His X-Factor Volume 1 (Virgin)\n\nRarely has a pop record worn its love for pop records more openly on its sleeve. And rarely has a pop impresario played so fast and loose with the object of his affections. Richard X's excellent X-Factor is a debut album playfully dressed to look like a hits compilation, which it isn't, strictly, although it does include hit singles. It comes with a fat CD booklet in which each major track on the album is represented as a worn 12-inch vinyl single, loved till the vinyl has scuffed a ghostly circle into its sleeve. Some of these are imaginary 12-inches - Caron Wheeler's lovely 'Lonely', for instance. Some are real.\n\nThe Sugababes's 'Freak Like Me' (included here in remixed form) was a genuine smash hit; Richard X is the shadowy figure behind the tune that sensationally revived the Sugababes' career last year. With typical mischief, he's crossed out 'Sugababes' and 'Freak Like' on the sleeve, and changed it to 'Richard X - It's All Me'.\n\nIt's not all him at all, of course. The slippery X didn't write 'Freak Like Me': he brilliantly cobbled together two old hits, Adina Howard's 'Freak Like Me' and Gary Numan's 'Are Friends Electric', to produce a monstrously catchy hybrid. He put lyrics about sexual deviation ('it's all about the dog in me') in the mouths of young Sugababes, and proudly rode the crest of the Eighties revival wave with Numan's synth stabs. Like its album-mates, 'Freak Like Me' was terribly knowing, it was affectionate, it was blatantly commercial and, most importantly, it established the Blackburn-born X as one of the most in-demand and fascinating producers working in pop.\n\nThose in the know, meanwhile, got an extra frisson from realising that 'Freak Like Me' had also come out before, minus the Sugababes, as 'We Don't Give A Damn About Our Friends' when X was working under the name Girls On Top. X's brief tenure as Girls On Top produced a handful of naughty track-splicing bootlegs that bested all others in the club craze, dicing with the legalities of copyright as enthusiastically as they oozed pop perfection.\n\nX repeated the trick with Liberty X's fine 'Being Nobody' (included here); he looks set to do it again with Kelis and the sublime 'Finest Dreams' (ditto). Joining them here is Javine's 'You Used To' and 'You (Better Let Love You 4x) Tonight', featuring cult Montreal DJ Tiga on vocals, a hi-NRG disco anthem-in-waiting. This is pop to satisfy the most superficial teenager, and the snootiest veteran who remembers the synthetic Eighties. And if X had kept it up, his X-Factor would genuinely be the best pop album in the world ever, as DJ Mark Goodier archly claims for X on 'Mark One'.\n\nAs it is, it's merely a very, very good one. The caveat here is that X lets his knowledge of pop get the better of his trashy instincts. The rest of the album is aimed at the grown-up sophisticate rather than the young fan. It contains moments of, well, elegance. Former Soul II Soul vocalist Caron Wheeler's 'Lonely' and Jarvis Cocker duetting with Mazzy Star on 'Into You' are but two acts of pop cannibalism aimed at the connoisseur. The governess tones of Deborah Stickland-Evans, formerly of The Flying Lizards (a band who were themselves infamous for their perverse cover ver sions), makes good electroclash fare from 'Walk On By' and 'Lemon/Lime', too.\n\nBut you can't help but feel that this genetic re-engineer of pop should have sought utter perfection by aiming solely for the hearts of pre-teens, rather than the heartstrings and minds of his peers."
