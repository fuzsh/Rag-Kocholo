        "text": "SUGGS: The Dublin Castle is still my favourite pub, not least because it’s where we played some of our earliest concerts – you could call it the ancestral seat of Madness. I remember they had Irish bands on, because we went there to get one of our first concerts and had to pretend we played a bit of Irish music ourselves. There were about 10 or 12 Irish pubs in Camden Town that had a function room out the back, and it occurred to us, at the end of the punk thing, that you might get a gig if you just asked. So we would go round just knocking on doors and if there was nothing going on, the guv’nor might give you a gig. He didn’t really care as long as he sold a few pints.\n\nWOODY: Punk still had the country wrapped up in this new, anarchistic and exciting ‘let’s change things’ vibe. It opened up the opportunity to walk into your local pub and say, ‘I fancy putting on a gig.’\n\nBEDDERS: The owners weren’t bothered about the kind of music you played as long as you brought in a lot of people to drink. And we always told them, ‘Oh, we have lots of friends.’\n\nHENRY CONLON (son of original landlord, Alo Conlon): Seven young men came in and said they were a jazz band and asked if they could get a gig.\n\nSUGGS: Having trudged round just about every pub in Camden in search of a gig, it was with the echo of rejections still ringing in our ears that we entered The Dublin Castle with its red-and-cream exterior and hanging baskets. ‘What’s your act then, lads?’ enquired the genial Irish guv’nor.\n\nBEDDERS: A school friend of mine had got a gig there playing some weird jazz/rock fusion, so he said, ‘Say you can play jazz and you’ll be fine.’ So me, Mike and Chris replied, ‘We play jazz, and a little bit of country and western.’\n\nSUGGS: He took us through the Dublin’s red-lit, mock-Tudor bar to the back room, which was used for functions and the occasional bit of live Irish music. It was pretty damn impressive, especially the stage, which was made up of sheets of hardboard laid across stacks of beer crates. Up to this point, we’d really only played a few private parties and this room felt like the real deal. It looked like it could hold 150 people at a pinch, which felt like Wembley to us. ‘What do you think lads?’ asked Alo. ‘Yeah, it’s OK,’ we replied, trying to look nonchalant. We had, at last, landed on our feet.\n\nBEDDERS: Alo asked when we could come along, duly gave us a night, and everything went from there.\n\nHENRY CONLON: Dad had thought, ‘Oh, jazz, that’s nice and respectable.’ So he was not a little surprised the following Friday when a bunch of skinheads showed up. He thought, ‘What am I doing?’\n\nLEE: It was 50p entry and we got paid in cash; all of £4.50 each.\n\nSUGGS: When seven skinny teenagers in funny suits started leaping about playing Jamaican ska, the Irish regulars were somewhat bemused.\n\nBEDDERS: The stage was a little triangle and was so small, we sort of had to stand in front of one another; so Woody was at the back, then it was me, then Chris stood in front of me.\n\nSUGGS: Like any young band, we were still just kids learning how to play, but performing eyeball-to-eyeball with a crowd in places like the Dublin Castle was where we really learned how to entertain. It’s all very well writing songs in isolation, but when you see an audience reaction, you start to learn what they like and don’t like. It gives you direction and you learn how to perform. It was there that I started to get my confidence. If The Beatles got their thing going in Hamburg, then the Dublin Castle was our version of it, except without the girls. Without it we wouldn’t have made it, I’m sure.\n\nMIKE: We definitely found our mojo there. It was great – it really helped us a lot.\n\nSUGGS: When we started playing that kind of ska, we knew we were onto something different. It had something infectious. When we started dropping Madness and One Step Beyond into the set we noticed that it really got the crowd going. But we never made a big thing about ‘doing it for the people’ – it was basically for ourselves. We were playing to our strengths and our strengths were pretty limited back then. If we could feel we could dance and be excited by it, that was enough.\n\nBEDDERS: I remember Chris sitting me down and giving me a talk about pulling my weight. It must have made an impression because I can still remember it. He’s good at putting things in perspective.\n\nWOODY: I remember my mum saying, ‘You’ve got to get rid of that singer – he’s terrible’.\n\nSUGGS: And I remember we were terrible that night at the Dublin Castle, absolutely terrible. We very patently weren’t a country and western band. But Alo sold a few pints that night and on the back of that we managed to get a three-month residency. I remember Lee saying, ‘That’s it. If it doesn’t go any further, we’ve still made it.’ It was the turning point and meant we could start to build a following.\n\nWOODY: The DC had previously only ever had a couple of Irish jig artists; an old bloke doing Irish songs or a couple of jazz quartets or something. Then once we got our residency, we were packing the place out week after week.\n\nCARL: We woke up one morning and realised there was a musical movement and we were part of it.\n\nBEDDERS: We’d all read about this Coventry band that was also playing ska stuff. I realised that I’d actually seen them play as The Coventry Automatics with The Clash in London when they were more punky, although they did have a reggae element to them. I remember thinking, ‘Oh, this lot are quite good.’ I never really thought much more about it until their reviews started appearing.\n\nSUGGS: I’d seen a half-page article about them in the Melody Maker and was really shocked by how similar they looked to us, which was hats and suits and all that. And secondly, reading the article, they seemed to be doing exactly the same music as we were doing. We’d felt we were completely in our own world; just me and 15 other people who’d started our own thing, playing ska and reggae and R‘n’B. Then suddenly a poster appeared in the Hope saying that The Specials were performing and it really was an epiphanal moment. On the night, a strange-looking gang of fellas burst in, all smart suits and Frank Sinatra pork pie hats. They took one look around and filed back out again. Then they reappeared, carrying guitar cases and a drum kit. It was all a bit wary, a bit, ‘Who are you then mate?’ and all that. The jukebox was the catalyst for our first conversation.\n\nHORACE PANTER: My first introduction to Madness was some graffiti on the toilet door at the Hope: ‘Madness, Bluebeat and Ska’. I also remember seeing ‘Chalky n Suggs ov Chelsea’ scraped into doors and walls.\n\nJERRY DAMMERS: We’d been intrigued by graffiti around Euston station: ‘North London Invaders’, ‘Chalky’, ‘Toks’ and ‘Bird’s Egg’. Later, I realised this was the work of Madness and their road crew.\n\nBEDDERS: The gig was sold out, but knowing the governor, John, we managed to blag our way in.\n\nSUGGS: We were intrigued and piled downstairs. It blew our minds to see these people who looked a bit like us and sounded a bit like us. That night was probably my most memorable gig – they went off like a packet of crackers. I remember Neville Staple blowing holes in the ceiling with a starter pistol, then they stormed into Gangsters. Within seconds of the first chords they were jumping up and down like lunatics. They were fucking brilliant, doing this really high-energy turbo punk ska. I wasn’t sure whether to feel jealous or fucking vindicated, that we were onto something after all. It was probably one of the best gigs I ever saw, certainly one of the most important for me and the rest of the band, and completely informed us, in terms of performance, pretty much from then onwards. All that energy they had.\n\nMIKE: I remember thinking, ‘Wow. It really sounds like those old reggae records that we’re trying to do.’ It was so weird. How could this be happening in Coventry while we’re doing our thing in London? We didn’t know anyone from Coventry and yet at the same moment, they’re suddenly coming out with the same stuff at the same time.\n\nWOODY: There was us in London and The Specials and The Selecter in Coventry; two completely different parts of the country, and both ironically influenced and playing music from a part of history. We had the same dress sense and were all listening to exactly the same stuff – it was just incredible. They couldn’t believe that we were into the same things as them either.\n\nLEE: I never had a pot of glue that this was going on up in Coventry, but while we’d been in our bedrooms and doing our first gigs round at our friends’ houses, it turns that there had been this band up there playing the same style of music and dressing the same way too.\n\nSUGGS: I was shocked to meet them as I didn’t think anybody in the world was doing the same thing as us. Because we liked reggae and ska and other music with black influences, as well as the Rude Boy ethos, we thought we were pretty individual. There really weren’t many other people around who were into it until The Specials popped up, but it was a complete coincidence. They were the ‘it’ band because they were one of the first to have black and white members. So they weren’t exactly the same as us, but they were wearing suits and hats and stuff at a time when…\n\nCHRIS: …suits and hats weren’t in.\n\nSUGGS: Exactly. And a whole ball started rolling that we had never really envisaged. We’d been quite happy in our own little bubble, but suddenly we realised something was really going on. There was real excitement in the air; a very rare thing that I’d only experienced once before, in the Roxy. A real feeling something was happening and that we just happened to be right in the middle of it.\n\nJERRY DAMMERS: I just remember that the Madness mob had a dance which consisted of head-butting each other.\n\nSUGGS: Things started to change after we saw them. They were like us, but turbocharged. We were still diesel at that point. They’d gone that bit further, while we were still doing a bit of R&B. The Specials gave us this revelation that the uptempo stuff was really fucking exciting. No one else seemed to have realised what a fertile vein that music was, how potent it was live. But suddenly we were aware we were not alone and we learned a lot about how to turn a basically easy-going rhythm into something quite high-octane and speedy. So they were mixing reggae with punk, while we had the idea of mixing it with British pop music\n\nCHRIS: The Specials were similar to us but they were more punk – they were more influenced by that. I used to really like it but it didn’t really influence us. The thing about The Specials was that none of them had really been skinheads, whereas we had. But I think Neville and Lynval, they were Jamaican, and Jerry had always liked reggae music. That’s how they got into it. It was just a real coincidence. People always used to say that The Specials were the first ska band or some crap like that, but it wasn’t true, it just happened like that.\n\nSUGGS: After the gig I got talking to Jerry, who was talking about the new label he was starting, which he said was going to be an English Motown. Then he told us he didn’t have anywhere to stay, so he kipped at my mum’s flat above Maples, the furniture shop. In those days, your best chance of finding a place to stay after a gig was pulling a bird. But if you’ve seen the state of Jerry’s teeth you’ll realise why he ended up kipping on my mum’s sofa with all his worldly goods – one toothbrush and a few cassettes – in a battered school briefcase. I played a him a rough cassette of Madness and we talked long into the night about pop music and his vision and future that was to be 2-Tone. He was talking about it being self-sufficient, all-encompassing and racially integrated, which was an unusual prospect at that time. It was pretty momentous, but I didn’t think it would ever happen.\n\nBEDDERS: Jerry had been in lots and lots of bands and he’d actually known a bit about the music business. We felt it quite lucky that we had found someone who was a musician and who also knew a bit about the record industry. Everything really sprang from there.\n\nCHRIS: We gave them a cassette – a rehearsal tape, really.\n\nBEDDERS: Jerry says he still has it. He told me he still listens to it once in a while and has a laugh.\n\nJERRY DAMMERS: The tape was dodgy – really, really bad – but I also thought there was lots of potential. I don’t believe any other record label would have signed them at that time in their career except for 2-Tone. They were ropey around the edges, but Chas was doing some amazing dances.\n\nBEDDERS: Jerry said he’d heard about us too, and some arrangement was made to do something the next time they were in London.\n\nJERRY DAMMERS: They were ropey as hell – still virtually a school band – but obviously they had to be snapped up for our fledgling label. My idea was that, instead of competing, we should work together with like-minded bands.\n\nBEDDERS: We said, ‘Look, we’re playing kind of the same music as you are – reggae, ska, whatever’ and Jerry said, ‘Well we’re gonna get a label together and you’re gonna be on it.’ It was absolutely brilliant and incredibly exciting… the right place, right time moment.\n\nLEE: Jerry was like, ‘I’ve got a label, do you want to release a record? Suggs said, ‘Yeah, alright’. And it was that easy.\n\nCHRIS: It sounds so clichéd; if you saw a film of it you’d think, ‘That can’t be true’ but it really was as simple as that.\n\nSUGGS: They were pretty dark times at the end of the ’70s in the UK, which helps explains the rise of punk music, and you had this racist stuff going on as well. But all of a sudden this mushroom of hope, 2-Tone, sprouted out of the darkness.\n\nJERRY DAMMERS: It was obvious the Mod/skinhead revival was coming and I was trying to find a way to make sure it didn’t go the way of the National Front. I idealistically thought, ‘We have to get through to these people’, and that’s when we got the image together and started using ska rather than reggae. It seemed a bit more healthy to have an integrated kind of British music, rather than white people playing the two.\n\nSUGGS: There was a lot of energy and an idea that music had got a bit pretentious and self-indulgent and it was time for something for really young people that wasn’t manufactured.\n\nNEVILLE STAPLE: Jerry was determined to show black and white people together in harmony; even the famous 2-Tone logo was made in black and white to depict racial unity. All of what happened with the 2-Tone scene was the foresight of Jerry and he should be given a lot of credit for the positive social impact he created.\n\nJERRY DAMMERS (speaking in 1979): It’s not that we’re just trying to revive ska. It’s using those old elements to try forming something new. In a way, it’s all still part of punk. We’re not trying to get away from punk. We’re just trying to show some other direction… you’ve got to go back to go forward.\n\nMIKE: The 2-Tone attitude was similar to punk: it was good not to see any hidden mystique in music or to believe you have to be really good to play it. I hate the attitude that there’s something special about music or musicians. I think anyone should be able to have a go at it. At the time when the punk thing came along, you’d think you had to be playing for five years before you could make a record. I used to think that we sounded all right live, but it didn’t seem to connect that therefore we could make records – there seemed to be some magical difference. But there’s nothing particularly special about making records. If you’ve got a good idea at home then it can be a good idea on record.\n\nWOODY: We didn’t have the money to pay for a recording, so we borrowed some off Warner Brothers, gave them bit of our publishing, and off we went.\n\nSUGGS: Clive duly booked two days at Pathway as he thought that would be just enough time to record three songs. It was decided we would have a go at The Prince, My Girl and Madness. We went to Pathway because it was where The Yachts had recorded their first single and where Elvis Costello had recorded Watching The Detectives, which we were all very fond of.\n\nLEE: Because we still had proper jobs, there wasn’t time to fuck around. We were actually booked in for the previous week but we lost Woody, who wasn’t familiar with the area.\n\nSUGGS: We’d piled all our gear and ourselves into Mike’s trusty ex-GPO Morris 1000 van and set off.\n\nCLIVE LANGER: Woody was going to meet us there as he had this little motorbike, but he got lost en route.\n\nCHRIS: We were in Holloway Road and he said, ‘Oh I know where it is.’ And off he went, never to be seen again.\n\nSUGGS: So we lost the first day’s recording and our cash, which wasn’t the most auspicious start to our professional career. But Clive managed to draw on Rob’s enthusiasm to borrow some cash and extend our recording time.\n\nCLIVE LANGER: I went and saw Rob Dickens who lent us an additional £200 for another session, and this time it all worked out well. Producing-wise, I was still pretty green, but I had some idea of what I was doing.\n\nLEE: Thanks to Clive wangling the advance, we put down three tracks, two of which were eventually used on our first single.\n\nSUGGS: We recorded The Prince, My Girl with Mike singing, and Madness. The studio was tiny, with a slightly out-of-tune upright piano. There was barely enough room for us to fit in. The atmosphere was great and the tracks were sounding good. With a couple of hours to spare at the end of the day, it was just a case of mixing them down. This involved three of us pushing faders up and down as the songs went onto the two-inch tape, until we felt the right balance of instruments and vocals had been achieved. Which at about midnight we all did. We then took it turns to sit in the control room and listen to the tracks on the big speakers. We all agreed they sounded great and spent an hour or two recording the mixes onto cassettes, one at a time, so we could all take the songs away with us. Happy days; really joyful, innocent times.\n\nLEE: The title track, The Prince, was a tribute to yours and mine, ruler of Blue Beat, F.A.B. and Dice recordings, Mr Rude Man himself, Prince Buster. It was written over a cuppa and dunkies late one evening at Carl’s in-laws’ house. We had a cup of coffee… and another cup of coffee… and another cup of coffee… and wrote this track about a Jamaican artist who moved me. It was the first lyrics I ever wrote to a melody.\n\nBEDDERS: I think it was written pretty late in the day. Lee wrote it pretty much thinking that we were going to go and record something.\n\nCHRIS: Because Lee really liked all that stuff, there’s lots of references to Buster himself, Orange Street, uptown Jamaica – it’s a bit of a rip-off of a couple of Prince Buster songs.\n\nBEDDERS: It’s almost like a compilation of Prince Buster songs.\n\nCHRIS: Lee also did this saxophone solo which we were really surprised by because it sounded so professional. But of course he’d pinched that too.\n\nLEE: The lyrics were taken from bits and pieces of various Prince Buster songs. Because he’d always stood out to me, when I started writing I took elements from his work and put them together. The melody was a simple 12-bar with some odd bits thrown in for variety but I was stuck for a solo, so I played bits of Texas Hold-Up. Its flip side was a version of Prince Buster’s Madness.\n\nBEDDERS: It’s a fantastic idea and a fantastic song. It reminds me of Dancing In the Street because it’s a call to people to say, ‘This is what I really like. This guy should be looked at and we should all get out there and find his record and dance to it and play that kind of music.’\n\nCHRIS: After Lee wrote that, and because Mike had written My Girl, I just remember thinking. ‘Great they can write all the songs, I don’t need to worry.’\n\nMIKE: When we went in the studio to record it, I was quite knocked out with how The Prince sounded, ’cos what we were came out pretty well. It was bizarre. We were really only half-able to play a song, and I was a bit afraid that we weren’t good enough to appear as a recording group, yet suddenly here we were getting noticed. And we’d barely mastered our instruments!\n\nCHRIS: Clive Langer was a big help during those first sessions. He was really good – like another member of the band. Because he was a musician himself, he’d say stuff like, ‘Look, try this on the guitar.’\n\nLEE: Yeah, Clive really simplified things. God only knows what it would have sounded like without him.\n\nROB DICKINS: Clive comes back and says, ‘I need another £20 to do a remix’. So I gave him another £20. He comes back with The Prince which Lee had written, My Girl, which Mike had written, and Madness. And I went, ‘Clive, Madness is a Prince Buster song! What happened to three songs?’\n\nMIKE: Amazingly it sounds like a professional recording but it was very close. It was by the skin of our teeth that we made that. In fact, it was all by the skin of our teeth. It was like an airplane taking off and we weren’t packed or anything and we just managed to jump on as it took off.\n\nSUGGS: Jerry had always promised me, ‘If you ever get your band going, then you’ve got a chance of being on the label’. And he stuck by his word. When he heard The Prince he said, ‘It sounds great. I’ll put it out on 2-Tone.’ And everything went from there.\n\nWOODY: The Specials had blagged a record deal with Chrysalis, and just said to us, ‘We’ve got a record label, do you wanna do a single?’ It wasn’t anything earth-shattering – it just happened. By this time, there were lots of record companies sniffing around, so I think we would have signed with someone anyway.\n\nROB DICKINS: I remember they came to me and said, ‘The Specials have offered us a deal so we can get this out on 2-Tone.’ I said, ‘Oh, forget 2-Tone! You don’t want to be there as second cousins to The Specials. I know everyone at the major labels. I’ll get you a record deal.’ So, I went to Warners and they didn’t get it. I went to EMI and they didn’t get it. I went to all the labels, even including Stiff, and couldn’t get them a record deal. So we had a meeting in my office and I sheepishly said, ‘I’m broken! This is ridiculous!’ I said, ‘Do you think 2-Tone would still be up for it?’ So they said, ‘We’ll go and check – yeah, yeah, they’re still up for it.’ So I said, give them the tapes. And that was The Prince.\n\nCLIVE LANGER: I’d also taken the tapes around to people I knew at the big labels in town and no one else seemed to get it. So off they went to 2-Tone.\n\nRICK ROGERS (The Specials manager): I think the first meeting we had was in The Spread Eagle in Camden Town one lunchtime. We talked about the idea of doing a single with them – in fact, putting out the single that they’d already recorded as a demo. Everyone was very happy with it. The A&R decisions tended to be made by a committee of hundreds and there was no dissension.\n\nWOODY: We chose The Prince because we thought it was the most commercial of the three that we’d recorded. Madness was a cover version and Mike was singing on My Girl, and we needed a song that Suggs was singing really. It also had the 2-Tone feel and was the most ska out of the three tracks.\n\nCLIVE LANGER: Jerry just told us to turn up the ‘chink-a-chink-a’ rhythm guitars, and the next thing you know it’s a hit and the boys are on Top of the Pops.\n\nSUGGS: All of a sudden, the possibility that none of us were going to have to work for the council or polish cars any more was a reality coming our way across the horizon.\n\nLEE: When we played The Hope, I used to frisbee out old ska singles and throw pork pies into the audience. I had a tie which lit up, too (unashamedly nicked from the Kilburns). Do something more than just playing music, make it a bit more visual, save the actual music for the records and concentrate on the visuals, that was an integral part.\n\nSUGGS: At first just our friends came to our gigs, but the audiences just got bigger and bigger and they ended up having to turn people away from places like the Hope ‘cos there wasn’t not enough room. We played dance music but there was never enough space to dance to it in.\n\nCARL: It wasn’t so much our musical quality as our enthusiasm that won audiences over – they’d end up onstage with us half the time.\n\nSUGGS: There was a very strong feeling of mutual respect and camaraderie. This was our thing; we were part of it. We were doing it ourselves and the establishment couldn’t get a look-in. The clothes and music were hard to come by. There was a lot of effort going into this shit from all concerned. It was a feeling I’d only really witnessed as a kid when punk started, but this time we didn’t want to tear our clothes up and leap about. We wanted to look smart and dance.\n\nWOODY: It was all going off – we were all very young and everything was new and exciting. When you meet people who have the same interests as you and the same energy, it is very exciting. You don’t really think about what you’re doing, you just want to play music. That’s all you care about.\n\nSUGGS: I still had a job as a gardener through the week, and was playing at the pub on a Friday night, and I thought, ‘Well that’s enough. You get £50 and a few birds coming to look at you.’ I was quite happy to play one night a week, earn a few quid and then go into work like a hero on Monday.\n\nCARL: We didn’t have the brains to ask a talent scout to come and see us. We used to appear week after week in empty clubs, just playing away. It didn’t really occur to any of us that other people might be interested in listening to our type of music.\n\nCLIVE LANGER: They were very young and just having a laugh — they’d be happy to play in a bar and just get people to dance.\n\nSUGGS: We were playing in a sweaty pub with £5 between the seven of us and having to shift our own gear and everyone was saying, ‘You’ll look back on this and love it’, and we thought, ‘Bollocks.’ But I do really like looking back on it now. Because none of us had been in the business before, we were all very naïve and in our own little bubble.\n\nBEDDERS: When you’re younger you don’t really think about it that much, you’re swept away by the next thing that comes in front of you. I think that’s what kept us going; being youthful and enthusiastic. I’m the youngest but as a band we were bonded together by the speed of everything going off – and we bonded together as a group; the situation demanded it.\n\nSUGGS: I wouldn’t imagine a band of seven people could make it now in the way that we did. Going round in the fucking van with seven of you, working during the week, trying to support yourself, it would be tough. Whatever way you look at it, there are thousands more bands now than there were when we started. You can build up a bit of a following online and get some kind of career going, whereas in our day, you only had word of mouth. It would take months and months to get 400 people into a venue. It goes back to the old adage of hard work and determination. We had to work in gardens during the week or painting and decorating – then we’d go out and do the gigs at night. It certainly didn’t come on a plate.\n\nSUGGS: Playing the Ballroom was a real step up for us. It’s not much to look at from the outside, but inside it’s a Tardis of a place. You can’t beat the atmosphere when the whole place bounces up and down as one.\n\nCHRIS (speaking in 1979): We want people to talk about the Madness sound in years to come. We don’t like to be thought of as part of any revival ‘cos after that fashion’s dead, the groups that rely on the fashion aren’t heard of any more.\n\nSUGGS (speaking in 1979): That’s the one thing that worries us. We could get labelled as just another ska revival band and get our own 10 minutes of fame like that. At the moment, it doesn’t matter what sort of music you play. You’re in vogue for 10 minutes and then that’s it. In the last month or so we’ve got as much publicity as some bands who have been slogging around for years. It makes you wonder if you’ll be back down there again next week.\n\nWOODY (speaking in 1979): That’s one of the reasons that we don’t want to be labelled as a rude boy ska band. We want to get across to as many people as possible so that they can all come along and have a good time.\n\nCHRIS (speaking in 1979): We are not Mods. We get a lot of Mods coming down to gigs, but they’re only a part of the audience; we’re not part of any movement. I’d like to think that we’re influenced by other people. We’re influenced by ska, we like a lot of Motown stuff and Kilburn and the High Roads. But I’d rather have our own sound than something that someone else has already got. One critic called us a rude boy ska band, but we don’t really want to be categorised like that.\n\nCARL: Kids used to come up to me and say, ‘Oh, you’re Mods and skinheads.’ Who cares? I think things were more labelled than tribal in those days. It’s nice to be able to say, ‘We’re this band, we’re that band’ rather than ska.\n\nSUGGS: We were never a ska band as such, we were just influenced by ska. And we never wanted to be ‘sons of 2-Tone’ – we wanted to be Madness. We were very upfront in realising that the 2-Tone thing was going off like a packet of crackers and we were in that mode stylistically. We certainly started to put more ska into our set and we’d been very lucky to meet Jerry and that whole thing happened. Earlier than God had intended, we were suddenly the thing.\n\nMIKE: We would have been foolish not to ride the 2-Tone wave, but it wasn’t the limit of our ambitions.\n\nLEE: We just happened to be in the right place at the right time when it all took off.\n\nSUGGS: We could have continued having ska hits until they came out of our ears. But we didn’t, we grew less interested in ska. And consequently, our music became less influenced by it. What changes is that you get less interested in how it outwardly appears and more interested in how inwardly you feel about it.\n\nMIKE: We were wary of the way bands like Bad Manners were being marketed. They were a good band but we didn’t want to get lumped in with that ska bracket too.\n\nCLIVE LANGER: To me, they weren’t like The Specials, who were an out-and-out ska band. I thought Madness were an interesting pop band, influenced by the Kilburns, 10CC and Robert Wyatt, and they just did a bit of ska. I was interested in their pop side rather then their ska side.\n\nBEDDERS: As much as we loved ska, we were already moving away from it in 1979. We always knew we wanted to play pop and not be pigeon-holed. But I think it was led by the songs, rather than any conscious decision to leave ska behind.\n\nCARL: The thing was, we’d always been doing pop songs. So, at the same time as we were doing One Step Beyond we were also doing the Kinks’ Slow Rock, Shoparound, and Tears of a Clown by The Miracles. We were influenced by reggae, R&B, Motown, pop and ska in equal measure. Folk just jumped on the ska angle because it was the ‘in’ thing.\n\nBEDDERS: For example, we used to do a fantastic version of Always Something There To Remind Me. It was really good – Suggs did a great Sandy Shaw impression. For us, the ska influence had just come from older friends and brothers. It was very popular at the end of the 60s, so a lot of those records were still knocking around when we were looking for things to cover.\n\nSUGGS: At the time it was new in England, but it was just the music we grew up with. A lot of the older kids we knew still had those records or were still into it. And, along with R&B and rock ‘n’ roll, it was easy to play and we all liked it.\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: I didn’t know what to expect. I’d been told they were a jumped-up copy of Kilburn & The High Roads, which made them sound rather interesting. What I didn’t know is they had an alternative agenda. They thought, ‘We’ll wind up this record executive. We’ll charge him handsomely, something like £400’. But it occurred to me that something like this might happen so I said before the off, ‘It’s great you’re here but if anybody causes any aggravation whatsoever I will personally kill them in full view of the guests. If my wife gets at all irritated by any action that you might be imagining, that won’t work.’ Reckless Eric had already groped some girl at the bar, and there was a bad scene, so I had to pull him into a back room too. My wife was saying. ‘What are you doing? You’re supposed to be getting married to me but you’re dealing with those bloody bands.’\n\nCARL: It was basically a pub gig, but at a wedding reception. We couldn’t believe it – there was free drink and half our idols were there.\n\nMIKE: We came on in a long nutty train all round the room There was lots of nutty dancing – we played a good gig.\n\nANDY MURRAY (Stiff publicity officer): I was a bit intimidated when they did the nutty walk all the way through the crowd – they looked like a real hard bunch. However, they were a sensation.\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: I remember thinking, ‘There are two singles here’, but one song in particular stood out for me. As soon as they launched into One Step Beyond, I wanted to sign them. I thought to myself: ‘God, that’s good. That’s a single straight away. And it would make a good album title.’ With every band, the problem is to try and find the first single that will do well and attract people’s attention but I’d already decided that this track was going to be the first single, even though it was just an instrumental with a few kind of shouts in it. So I was thinking this, and my wife was nudging me, saying, ‘Stop thinking about that.’\n\nBEDDERS: We played pretty much the set we would have done at the Hope & Anchor or The Nashville. So it included not only The Prince and Madness but My Girl and most of what would later become our first album. In those days the songs were so short, it would all be over in half an hour. Carl was still working in Ashford at the time, so he came up and danced and did his thing.\n\nSUGGS: I must admit to getting a bout of nerves when I spied a few familiar faces in the audience, most notably Elvis Costello and our great hero, Ian Dury. But I can still picture the shock on people’s faces when we started our set. Dave’s wife kept asking us, ‘Don’t you know any Hot Chocolate numbers?’ while we’re leaping about like lunatics. When we noticed Elvis was there, we jumped off the stage, grabbed him and got a big conga line going.\n\nCHRIS: He was a hero of ours but we weren’t too intimidated by him, so we dragged him up on stage.\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: I remember Carl jumping into the crowd and dragging a bewildered Elvis up to dance – not very much of a dancer, our Elvis. They didn’t play too well, but they had so much dash and this totally radical, very visual and exciting on-stage style.\n\nBEDDERS: I think that was the qualifier for Dave. He said, ‘If Elvis is dancing then you must be doing something right.’\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: That set the tone for the evening. You could see that everyone thought, ‘Well if he’s dancing…’\n\nWOODY: We caused absolute mayhem, pandemonium, got everyone to dance, made sure that everyone was thoroughly embarrassed. Dave loved it.\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: They were very, very good and I thought, ‘I’ve just got to have them.’\n\nCARL: I think it was largely down to me and Lee dancing down into the crowd and making them all watch.\n\nBEDDERS: I remember Carl cut his hand on something and he was dancing and we were looking down and started seeing these drops of blood on us and thinking, ‘Jesus, what’s happening?’ It was quite a weird experience really.\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: Afterwards, they told me they’d only come along to take the piss. My wife also gave me hell, saying, ‘You haven’t spoken to me all night you’re up there watching the band.’ She still brings it up regularly because they were so good, I was listening to them instead of paying correct attention to what I was supposed to be up to.\n\nLEE: It was all a bit whirlwind. I remember we were jumping off the stage and picking up Elvis and chatting to him onstage. He never came to see us again after that.\n\nCHRIS: I remember we had this brilliant dressing room that had a two-tone carpet, with black and white squares. I said, ‘We should do a video in here’ so we shot Bed and Breakfast Man in the same room later.\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: There were eight or nine A&R men from other companies there and none of them liked the band, which I thought was a good sign. I decided there and then that they were likely and signed them up as soon after as I could. In hindsight, I shouldn’t have done it as it could have been terrible, but I suppose I was in a state of euphoric chaos so it seemed like a good idea at the time. So I asked them about the short instrumental with the rant at the front, and arranged to see them the following week.\n\nCHRIS: I think some of the Stiff people had seen us and didn’t like us because we weren’t musos. But Dave saw something in us.\n\nCLIVE LANGER: Robbo just absolutely got it and signed them straight away.\n\nBEDDERS: It was certainly the start of it – I think people from Stiff did come and see our gigs afterwards for a bit.\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: They came to the office and we had a big meeting in the pub and they agreed that it would be the right record label. They were very influenced by the fact that we had Ian Dury, who they were very fond of, so we got things going. We got along very well and it seemed really easy.\n\nCHRIS: Dave took us to the pub next door and spoke to us realistically… he understood what we were doing and had plans for us. All the other companies just wanted a ‘ska’ band because they were currently hip – they were prepared to sign anyone playing ska. But Dave saw how we could develop. He was like a father to us.\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: They were my kind of people. We had a great affinity straight away. It was remarkable. The company was doing well, we were making the right noises with nebulous records which nobody else could have really delivered so my ego was soaring. But I knew them intimately. There was Irish blood there, a vibe, they were all ducking and diving, and I was stressing this as a partnership big time, that we’re all in this together.\n\nLEE: Dave had just split from his Stiff business partner, Jake Riveiera, who’d taken half the bands, so it was all a bit up in the air. But he took us to a pub, where we had half a pint of beer and a pork pie; it was all very relaxed and enjoyable. What swung it for us was that he promised us complete artistic control; we could look how we wanted. He said, ‘We’re not going to dress you up in tartan trousers, or have you standing like this or looking like that.’ So I think that’s what clinched it with all the band. We got on fantastically well with all the acts there and particularly Ian Dury. It was one big happy family… in an igloo.\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: It was a very functional meeting but it was a great start. And of course we ended up having more fun together than most record companies and bands do.\n\nCARL: We liked the fact that Elvis Costello had been on the label. We just thought it was a fantastic stable to be in – we felt that things had vitality.\n\nSUGGS: Stiff seemed the obvious choice as they had Ian Dury. All the rest were shit-bags. Stiff were the most interesting label at that time.\n\nBEDDERS: It wasn’t such a big step from 2-Tone to kind of the same idea. They were like-minded people and like-minded bands tended to congregate on that label.\n\nWOODY: We didn’t trust anybody – we didn’t trust Dave, we didn’t trust anyone. But we had to make a decision and he was the one person who seemed to make any sense. I think he knew what we were about.\n\nSUGGS: Dave had great energy and he also had a vision. He said, ‘Look, I think you should just get in the studio and make an album.’ And that was what we really wanted to hear.\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: I said, ‘What do you want to do?’ And they said, ‘We want to make a record as soon as possible, we’ve got all the songs.’ I said, ‘Who do you want to produce it?’ And they said, ‘Clive Langer.’ So in between talking to them, I was buying them pints then nipping back to the office. I booked Eden Studios for two weeks hence. I called Clive on the phone and said, ‘You want to produce these boys but you need a good engineer. What about Alan Winstanley?’ Clive said, ‘Yeah, good idea.’ I went back in and said, ‘I’ve booked the studio and your producer, we’re ready to go Monday week.’ They said, ‘Oh fuck, that’s what we thought it might be like’.\n\nCHRIS: Stiff were definitely the best of a bad bunch. All these labels were after us purely because it was the ‘in’ thing. You know how it happens. Say you get a group like Tears For Fears and everybody’s after groups like them. That’s what it was. They were offering us lots of money but they didn’t have a clue of what we were about. Dave talked a lot of sense. He didn’t think we were just one-hit wonders and could see we were a more than this summer’s fad.\n\nBEDDERS: After doing the rounds and seeing various companies, the thing about Dave was, it was his company – there you were talking to the man who owned the company. So it wasn’t like this week you go to see somebody on the 5th floor and next week somebody on the 7th floor and so on. We could go straight to the man who made it all happen, and wouldn’t be lost in a maze of 200 bands on the same label.\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: Obviously, the point that you make is that you’re a small record company so they can talk to you, they don’t have to talk to anybody else.\n\nMIKE: Dave was down to earth and practical and for that reason he impressed us. And of course, he went on to have a pretty pivotal role. He picked all the singles and gave direction. We had a few rows, of course, but he captured what we had without ever trying to dictate it, although he was pretty conniving, which was good. You’d say no to things and he’d do them anyway.\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: All the kind of things we represented as a record label at the time and that I personally liked were in the script, so it was like manna from heaven. They were the stuff dreams are made of. To find a group where they all wrote, with some really standout songs, was good enough. But I had the feeling that here was a band really typifying a certain element of London society, kind of a folk ethos, which is why they became such a part of people’s real lives. They were also very naive in an awful lot of ways. It was a mentor/whippersnapper relationship, and they loved to piss me about.\n\nSUGGS: It wasn’t that we were ungrateful to 2-Tone or anything – we probably owed most of our success to The Specials. It was just that we couldn’t stay under their wing forever. We had to break out on our own, develop our own style. The deal with 2-Tone was a one-single deal, that was it. We were the first people on 2-Tone besides the Specials, and at first it never looked like it was going to go anywhere. By the time everybody realized it was a hot property and Chrysalis said they’d let us do an album, we’d already signed to Stiff.\n\nLEE: 2-Tone weren’t geared towards making albums, and that’s really what we wanted to do. We had seven songwriters in the band and everyone wanted to get their stuff heard. If we stayed, it would have used up too much of the label’s resources, so we had to find somewhere else.\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: Although 2-Tone was kinda happening, Madness were reasonably unique because they had a sense of humour along with very good ska songs, and I’ve always liked bands with humour. The public like humour and if a band is genuinely amusing they stick in the mind. They were seen as slightly rude boys who wouldn’t last five minutes or would end up in jail, but there was also very much a sense of consciousness about them. The Specials being from Coventry and the other bands from Birmingham and around there, they would be the only London ska band. Camden Town was also very close to me – I had an office there at one point so I was thinking about them.\n\nSUGGS: We were privileged enough to be offered a deal with 2-Tone and see that whole thing unfold before our eyes. Then to bump into Dave who had this house for misfits – Ian Dury, Elvis Costello, Wreckless Eric. It was just the perfect place for Madness; it couldn’t have been anywhere else. We could stay at 2-Tone and falsely remain as a ska band, which we weren’t entirely, or go to Stiff which was equally independent and maverick and free. Stiff took bands that other record companies didn’t know what to do with – they saw our potential.\n\nCARL: We settled on Stiff because they reminded us of 2-Tone, it was a label run by people who were passionate about the music.\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: The Beatles were folk music of Liverpool, certainly in the beginning. I always saw Madness as being folk music of London, irrespective of the ska rhythms.\n\nBEDDERS: As we had a lawyer, there was a bit of playing off a couple of companies against each other and I think that Dave always says that we ‘did’ him. At the very last minute, the lawyer threw in the classic lawyer tactic of saying, ‘Right Dave, I think they want to sign, but just come in with…’ I can’t actually remember the formal details of the deal, but one thing I do remember which appealed to us was that Dave had a plan of when to put the record out and he practically gave us a date straight away.\n\nSUGGS: I think we got about £250 each; maybe a bit more.\n\nCHRIS: He said, ‘OK, I’ll give you £10,000 just so you can all give your jobs up.’ I was working at the Post Office and I went sick or something indefinitely. Some time later they wrote me a letter saying I owed them money.\n\nBEDDERS: It was the start of a fantastic relationship. Even though Dave was maddening and would be pressing records before we’d even heard them, his enthusiasm was brilliant. He’d just say, ‘That’s a hit. Let’s go for it.’ He was always willing to give things a go.\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: Straight way, I could tell Barson was the big noise. All bands have a kind of hierarchy and there’s usually one person who controls the group, usually a musical person. In this case it was Mike so I got close as I could to him very quickly – although he didn’t want to get too close. I found out he was a Taurean like me and I know how Tauruses work. I thought, ‘I’ve got to flatter here, also not have any bullshit, be direct, get him on my side’. He was a very suspicious individual; always thought you had some kind of ulterior motive, so you had to say, ‘Look I think this would be good for the band.’ The rest of them didn’t quite know what was happening and were all floating around. Mike was always the one asking the questions.\n\nLEE: I just remember after we signed I got a letter from my dad saying, ‘No long-term deals! One-off deals, like what Brian Epstein done with The Beatles. But don’t do no merchandise deals like what they done. I want to hear more about this Stiff Records.’ From his prison cell, he was giving me advice. How ironic! He was just chuffed that I had chosen this path and hadn’t gone down his path, which I had been going down when I was younger.\n\nBEDDERS: We’d had a bit of a disappointment the week before. We were told to come to the 2-Tone office really early in the morning, because the charts were coming out that day, and if we’d reached a certain position we might go on Top Of The Pops, and we would have to go straight from the office to the BBC. So we all trooped in at 8am, sat in the office and waited to listen to the charts. Eventually we heard The Prince had got in the charts, but Secret Affair were above us and had bumped us off the show. So we just had to go home and wait until the next week.\n\nWOODY: When we finally did make it, the whole experience was just brilliant.\n\nBEDDERS: At the time, Top Of The Pops was such a monolithic thing – if you went on it, everyone saw you because there weren’t any other music shows.\n\nCARL:This was the time when there wasn’t anything else apart from NME, Sounds and Melody Maker – information was limited, and playing in a band was still a rebellious act. Being on Top Of The Pops was a dream – we never thought we’d be on it. .\n\nLEE: It was great – but no different than playing in the pub down the road.\n\nCHRIS: Suggs bought a purple suit for the occasion and Chalky and Toks gave him the nickname ‘Coco’ because they said he looked like Coco the Clown.\n\nSUGGS: We were very, very excitable and came down for high-jinx at the subsidised BBC bar, only to bump into Woody’s mum, Annie, who was the floor manager. Of all the people in authority! So we did behave ourselves… on that occasion at least.\n\nCHRIS: I think a lot of the other acts were pre-recorded or video. I can’t really remember any of them to tell the truth, although I do remember we were watching the Crusaders. I think they kept us in a dark room until we were due onstage.\n\nWOODY: For me it was being in the same studio as Stix Hooper from the Crusaders. I remember telling Randy Crawford that he was a hero of mine and had all of the Crusaders albums. She was very nice, and agreed Stix was a great drummer. The Rutz were really friendly too, especially Malcolm the singer.\n\nCHRIS: I was getting bored sitting in the dressing room and they said: ‘Do you want make-up?’ So I said: ‘Yes’. I sat in the chair and said, ‘Can you make me look as young as Cliff Richards?’ You’ll never guess who was sitting in the next chair… Rod Stewart! No, it was Cliff himself. I asked him, ‘When are you on?’ and he replied, ‘I’m closing the show’. What a pro. Top of the bill y’see.\n\nBEDDERS: I remember Lee was wearing this fantastic double-breasted suit and a bow tie. He came up to me before we went on and said, ‘Is it working?’ I said, ‘Yeah, you look great.’ He said, ‘No, is it working?’ And he flicked a button in his pocket and the bow tie lit up. He was a performer right from the start – and he’s never changed.\n\nLEE: I remember thinking that the studio was tiny, contrary to what came across on the screen.\n\nCHRIS: Yeah, that struck me too. They used some sort of slight wide-angle lens to give it a very slight fish eye effect and make everything look larger. When I watched it at home I thought, ‘Wow it looks really big in that studio.’\n\nSUGGS: At the start, I had a little plastic saxophone that fell out of my pocket. Lee picked it up and still has it to this day.\n\nEDWINA (Suggs’s mum): I remember sitting watching this boy of mine on Top Of The Pops with a neighbour and I’m clutching a cushion to me. He had a little toy trumpet in his top pocket and he’s dancing about and it fell out, and I knew that he was so nervous. It’s amazing. He was talking about becoming a council gardener and then the next thing I know, they’ve got a record leaping up the charts. It gave him a direction, a purpose, a family.\n\nBEDDERS: You can see our faces, just laughing at how fantastic it was – the idea of putting us lot on television. It was just amazing to be on TV and see how it all worked. Knowing us, we probably just went home on the Tube afterwards.\n\nROB DICKINS: Top Of The Pops used to be recorded on one day and shown the next. And one of the moments in my career I always think of was when the band came round my flat and were all lying on the floor watching themselves on TV. I thought, ‘We did that; this little band of people in this room’. One of those snapshot moments you have in your career – something special.\n\nCHRIS: Getting on that first time was one of the most exciting things ever. It was only later, by the 23rd time, that it got slightly tedious.\n\nBEDDERS: When you’re that age, you just get taken along in the tide of it all, ‘Oh look you’re on TV’. But I think we felt we had qualified as pop stars when people started saying, ‘I saw you on Top Of The Pops.’ Certainly my mum and dad were like, ‘Maybe this isn’t such a bad profession to be in after all.’\n\nMIKE:It was unbelievable. We were a bunch of nobodies living in nowhere land and suddenly we were on the telly and in the Hit Parade. Fantastic.\n\nCARL: When you start rehearsing in a cellar somewhere under a dentist’s you never expect in a million years that you’ll release a record, that it’ll sell, and that one day you’ll be on Top of the Pops. I was glued to that programme every week as a kid watching Gary Glitter, Marc Bolan and The Sweet, so I was proud to be on there. We knew we’d made it then.\n\nCHRIS: We didn’t film a video for the song because it was on 2-Tone and, erm, they hadn’t been invented yet. So when we later did Complete Madness – the first of many video compilations – we didn’t have a clip for this song. I suggested buying the footage from Top of the Pops, so we bought the rights to this first TV performance and used that instead.\n\nCHRIS: I remember that gig at the Friars – Carl wasn’t there and he came up on the train late.\n\nBEDDERS: We’d done One Step Beyond without his intro and we could see the crowd going, ‘Bah! Pathetic!’ Then he arrived, messiah-like.\n\nCARL: It had started like a damp squib and there was no vibe. Then the crowd parted like the Red Sea, I walked up, got on stage, Yab yab yab yab – boom! And everyone went, ‘Fucking hell!’\n\nBEDDERS: That was the first night we realised that Carl was more than just a bloke who came on to dance.\n\nCHRIS: He came through the audience like ‘ONE STEP BEYOND!’ And then we couldn’t afford not to have him, because he was so good. Before that, he’d just been a mate, but that night it became clear he was too big a character to not have in the band.\n\nSUGGS: Carl turned up in a Johnson’s suit with a blue pork-pie hat and it went completely fucking mad. We blew the place apart. We thought, ‘Fuck! This could really happen now.’\n\nCARL: It was finally recognised that I was a vital member of the band but it had been quite weird for me psychologically. I must admit, I was quite paranoid about not being in the band proper. I think that was reflected in my performances – the tension I was experiencing and how much I was trying. I knew I wanted to be in the band so I fought to get in there. Those opening words started a fashion, a craze, a way of life.\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: It had never occurred to me that he wasn’t in the group because I didn’t know all the ins and outs. To my mind, he was a member. We’d signed the agreement – and, of course, he didn’t sign it. So I said, ‘What about your man, the MC?’ They said, ‘Oh, he’s not in the band.’ I didn’t even realise until later that he’d briefly been the bass player before being shoved out.\n\nCARL: Initially I was really insecure. I felt that I threatened Suggs and he felt threatened by my presence, but we resolved it and joined forces and decided we were gonna sink or swim together.\n\nSUGGS: It was a funny period. Carl was a member of the band, but he wasn’t really involved with anybody else – particularly me, because we’re both singers. We talked about it between ourselves, and it must have been strange for him; I think he felt he was sort of outside us, yet felt changing that would be pushing me out. He didn’t push his position because he didn’t know what it was. But we decided that whoever had the right thing, be it words or music or singing, we’d do whatever seemed right.\n\nCARL: Some of the band were a bit reluctant about me joining. I remember being in a cafe with Lee and Mike and our girlfriends. I mentioned something about being made a band member, and Lee said, ‘Well, six goes further than seven’. I was fucking devastated. I cried – I’d have done it for nothing. I loved it. The success and money wasn’t my motivation. But kids can be cruel.\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: They wanted to keep him kind of fringe, or they seemed to think that would be the best thing, and I said it wouldn’t work long-term. He was the spirit of the group; he was a Rude Boy.\n\nCARL: The way I looked at it, I was the physical representation of what was being expressed musically.\n\nKERSTIN RODGERS: Carl was basically the Robbie Williams – a brilliant dancer, good looking, tons of charisma. Everybody would be looking at him, even when he was in the audience. In the end, it made sense to have him onstage.\n\nCLIVE LANGER: He was good and you couldn’t take your eyes off him, but I think they were a bit wary about having another member who was just their friend who kept jumping on stage. In the end it was Dave who said, ‘Look guys, he’s part of your group whether you like it or not.’\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: I had him made a member. I thought it was important because he had a large part to play aside from the opening rant on One Step Beyond. I spoke to Mike because he was the leader of the band, but he wasn’t that keen. He said, ‘Well he doesn’t come to every gig. He just comes to gigs he fancies’. I said, ‘You have to have him in there, it would be terrible not to have him because he’s such a crowd pleaser’. And of course he went on to write Our House and some other big tunes for them.\n\nCARL: Although they didn’t want me at the start, they had to have me. Really, it was the legal team and the record label saying, ‘You’ve got to make him a member.’ A lawyer suggested it would be preferable to make me a full-time part of the group.\n\nCLIVE LANGER: After that, I always used to enjoy working with him because he came at things from a different angle… although he was also quite boisterous.\n\nCHRIS: We weren’t mugs – we wanted to get an album out right away.\n\nBEDDERS: We really wanted to do it with 2-Tone but The Specials only had money enough to do their own album.\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: We chucked them into the studio straight away because it was a big buzz for them and they had a lot of material.\n\nBEDDERS: Going in to the studio, we were nerveless. We really had the songs down from playing them live so we didn’t go in for any timewasting or noodling. Alan and Clive made important contributions. Alan was very adept technically and Clive had a musically interesting and empathetic mind. They were an excellent combination.\n\nCLIVE LANGER: One Step Beyond was the first album I ever produced. I’d never planned to be a producer – I was just a bloke in a band that had made a few albums and knew a bit. But I helped with the demo for The Prince and Robbo started to believe that’s what I was, so suddenly I was put on a rollercoaster. I kind of knew the process because I’d worked with Alan but I couldn’t engineer and certainly needed help with that side of things. Luckily, Alan was very easy going and easy to get on with, and also meticulous, which was good cos I’m a bit messy, so it was a good combination. It was also good having him around because he was so big, and some bands could be a bit intimidating.\n\nALAN WINSTANLEY: I’d already been doing bits and pieces for Stiff, so Robbo originally had me in mind to be the producer but the band wanted Clive for that, so I came in to help engineer things instead. My first encounter with them was in a rehearsal room; I listened to the stuff and thought it was brilliant. I remember hearing My Girl with Mike singing it and I just thought, ‘What a fantastic pop song.’\n\nCLIVE LANGER: Compared to the band, I knew a lot, but compared to most producers I probably didn’t know anything. But I got on with them really well because I wasn’t a studio boffin; I was a musician and could talk their language.\n\nALAN WINSTANLEY: The boys themselves worked really hard. It was serious for them – it was their first album. By their own admission, they weren’t the best of musicians in those early days, but they were always very professional.\n\nCHRIS: It was so enjoyable. We were all in the studio all the time. Even when other people were doing their bits, we’d all be there.\n\nSUGGS: We’d been rehearsing and playing for a couple of years, so we had a set of about 15 or 20 songs and knew what would be on the album. Then Clive came down to rehearsal and said, ‘Well these are the ones that I think should on it.’ We argued about it a bit, but it was pretty much ready to go.\n\nCHRIS: We didn’t write anything especially for the album – it was all the songs we were doing live. We’d done the single already, so recording wasn’t a mystery to us, we knew that you go in and play the songs to the best of your ability. It was quite a breeze to do – the only album where we are all in the room together playing.\n\nBEDDERS: It was an assembly of all our influences, which weren’t all 2-Tone or early ska and reggae. We know from what we’d written that there would be pop songs on it.\n\nSUGGS: Because we’d been doing it for a log time, we actually spent very little time in the studio. We recorded it live, did about three songs a day, and it ended up resonating more than any other of our albums ever did.\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: They knew I was quite an interfering individual, so part of the deal was that I wouldn’t go to the studio. They made me agree because they were aware that I was prone to fiddle with people’s music. They were straightforward about it.\n\nCLIVE LANGER: We did the whole album in three weeks, working around the clock, rehearsing and recording. None of us had any money, but the enthusiasm and excitement was overwhelming. They had such a strong identity you didn’t really have to be a dictator with them. Suggs’s vocal style could sound quite bored so we’d go to the pub, have a couple of pints and do it again. That worked for quite a few years afterwards too.\n\nWOODY: I remember Clive stripped my drumming down even more to give the music extra space.\n\nBEDDERS: My memories of making it are mixed. From the rat-like existence of being caged by studio screens to keep the sound in, and me from getting out, to re-recording a lot of my bass parts when I was very ill. Clive believed my playing sounded better when I was close to collapse. Did this mean I had to be sick for every album?\n\nLEE: I don’t recall much of the One Step Beyond period, as I had just taken up drinking and everything was a bit whirlwind-like. One day, I’d be down the Hope & Anchor watching a band, the next in New York watching a native stirring Southern Comfort with his bell-end.\n\nSUGGS: It was a lot of fun. Those songs still resonate because we recorded the atmosphere of the room. I don’t think we could play that naïvely and have that much fun again.\n\nALAN WINSTANLEY: During the sessions, Clive turned to me and said, ‘This feels like something special doesn’t it?’\n\nCLIVE LANGER: I didn’t realise what we were going to catch would prove to be so successful but I knew it was really fresh and different. The band themselves had so much character and it came out in the music.\n\nMIKE: We’d been playing the songs a lot for two years, 1-2-3-4, no fiddling around, so the work had been done already in gigs and rehearsals. We just whacked it out and had two weeks completely in Clive’s hands. Because we’d already been playing those songs, things worked really quickly in the studio. In total it only took us three weeks to finish all the recording, mixing, artwork and cover.\n\nCLIVE LANGER: One challenge we had was to fit all seven members of the band on the record. As a producer, your first inclination is to take things out. Some tracks, for instance, might sound fine with just piano and bass, or lots of tracks don’t really need a saxophone or guitar. But it became clear, very early on, that every song had to have all the members of the band on it, otherwise it wouldn’t be a Madness song. Every song is stamped with each member’s personality.\n\nWOODY: It was amazing. I remember recording Tarzan’s Nuts with Robbo’s face peering in at us from the control room of Eden Studios… bacon being slipped into my breakfast by Chrissy Boy in the cafe down the road… and learning how a song sounds better with fewer or no fills. Clive tried to get me to hit the bass drum hard, cut out the rolls. The adrenalin and the nerves were unbearable and when that red light went on, I was just relieved to get to the end. The snare was horrible to play, all papery. But it sounded brilliant on record: really crisp and punchy.\n\nLEE: Alan used to look us sort of side-on, as if to dodge something. Clive had been into the 2-Tone session, and was now accepted into the gang… or so he felt. ‘The sax sounds great, Lee.’ Bollocks, it sounds like it’s being blown through a sock; it sounds out there on its own. Anyway, we could always quadruple track it.\n\nCHRIS: I can’t remember much about it, except doing the guitar solo on Rockin’ In Ab with our publisher, Rob Dickens, shouting encouragement. The songs contained on it were the bulk of our set at the time, so we knew them inside out. At the time, I used to sing Bed and Breakfast Man and expected to sing on the album, but Suggs put in a performance that surpassed mine. Mike had sung My Girl up to then too, but was also replaced.\n\nLEE: It was good fun – in and out. Alan and Clive were grateful that there was a glass barrier between us and them because when I had to redo a part, I would scream obscenities. I also remember walking up and down the brand new wooden floor at Rushent Mansion with 6″ nails taped to my soles to give Land of Hope and Glory that hobnail boot of authority sound, and ruining the floor.\n\nSUGGS: The Specials had just finished an album in the same studio and there were bits of tape lying around. So we looped them into the reel-to-reels and crowded round the speakers to hear what their album sounded like.\n\nCLIVE LANGER: When we listened to it, we thought, ‘Oh blimey, that sounds a bit good.’ There was definitely a healthy competitiveness there.\n\nSUGGS: Although it was friendly, we were absolutely trying to make an album that was better than theirs.\n\nCHRIS: We were just checking out the competition, but not in a sneaky way.\n\nSUGGS: Of course we were checking each other out. John Bradbury [Specials drummer] used to get these amazing rimshot sounds, and I remember asking him how, and he said, ‘It’s the way I fucking play it, it wasn’t the way it was fucking recorded.’\n\nCLIVE LANGER: We were creating fashion and following fashion. As with most bands, we were looking over our shoulders to see what The Jam and Elvis Costello and The Specials were all doing, just checking out everything at home while being influenced by American records.\n\nALAN WINSTANLEY: While I engineered, Clive would get more involved with the songs’ arrangements and we’d meet somewhere in the middle. Both of us worked on getting the performance, and that was probably one of our strengths – one could walk out of the room and the other could carry on, even with vocals. No one was in charge, we just took it in turns. In fact, when someone was singing, we were usually both there, so it was pretty equal, and then when it came to the vocal comping I would do that on my own. We were both also there for the other instruments, but if at some point one of us wanted to bugger off for a half-hour break because things were getting intense, that’s what would happen; one of us could leave the control room while the other carried on alone. Still, 95 per cent of the time or more, we were in there together.\n\nCLIVE LANGER: At the time of doing Madness we were kind of flying along together. Alan’s very precise and very particular, and I’m more slapdash and in a hurry and probably tend to like rougher-sounding records. That’s a generalisation, because in the end we do like the same records, but sometimes the whole process with Alan can be laborious for me. He normally does the vocal comps whereas I’ll do a lot more work in the rehearsal room on the arrangements, deciding what instruments should play what where, how long the chorus should be and things like that. Still, we’ve got on fine considering how long we’ve worked together.\n\nALAN WINSTANLEY: We’ve had our arguments. Early on we’d both argue our point, but as you grow older and a bit longer in the tooth you tend to think ‘Oh, bollocks. Whatever.’ In the early days, if either of us really felt strongly about something we would stick up for it, and sometimes we might even try something both ways. Neither of us was too proud to say ‘OK, yeah, your idea is better.’ So, it always worked out in the end.\n\nCHRIS: The album was mixed by Clive and Alan while we entertained the masses on tour.\n\nSUGGS: It ended up being a great album with great songs, and the production is really clear. Not naïve – but not overly sophisticated.\n\nCLIVE LANGER: Alan liked this very crisp snare sound that sounded good on the radio and made the records stand out. So he soon ensured they made their mark aurally.\n\nALAN WINSTANLEY: Lee’s sax was the one wildcard. He didn’t realise that the sax was a transposing instrument, so when the rest of the band were playing in C, he had to play in B-flat. It’s why he was never quite on the note and always sounded slightly out of tune.\n\nCLIVE LANGER: Because he was self-taught, he didn’t realise that a tenor saxophone isn’t tuned to concert pitch. But that’s how he would do it, which is why it was always out of tune and why he was always a semitone out. To try and get the notes right he was over-compensating by pulling his mouthpiece out, loosening the reed and over blowing wildly.\n\nWOODY: I remember Lee constantly struggling with tuning. He was always pulling the reed off the end of his sax to get the right tuning.\n\nLEE: I never realised that to tune the saxophone you had to move the mouthpiece – and I was moving it in the wrong direction. You’ll never hear a sound like that ever again.\n\nCLIVE LANGER: To get him back in tune, we ran his tracks through a Harmonizer. It was a really good effect, like David Bowie’s sax playing – out of tune but full of character.\n\nALAN WINSTANLEY: Since it was such an identifiable part of the Madness sound, we didn’t even consider getting in a session guy to play those parts. It was all part of the charm.\n\nCLIVE LANGER: We found that whole aspect of Madness very exciting. We wanted to keep that old pub vibe, basing what we were doing on things like Thunderclap Newman’s Something In The Air, while also going in for the whole German cabaret feel.\n\nALAN WINSTANLEY: It’s why we deliberately wanted the piano to also sound out of tune to get that Madness honky-tonk sound.\n\nCLIVE LANGER: We occasionally put thumb tacks on the piano hammers to make it sound even brighter. But don’t tell anyone from the studio that.\n\nALAN WINSTANLEY: Yeah, we soon developed a talent for making a £20,000 Steinway sound like a beaten-up piano.\n\nCLIVE LANGER: It was only a bit later that Lee learned to play in tune. He said he went to a saxophone shop on Shaftsbury Avenue to try out a new sax, and when he tuned it up to concert pitch the guy said, ‘No, that’s not how you do it.’ It was a real light bulb moment – after that, he went away and re-learned every Madness song correctly.\n\nCARL: The nutty train evolved from Mike’s girlfriend, Kerstin, who took a photo session and we were all sort of walking in a weird way.\n\nWOODY: We were doing ‘the walk’ quite far apart and got closer and closer, but I think the finished article came from many things.\n\nCHRIS: I thought it started because we all loved the Two Ronnies and Porridge – Ronnie Barker was a genius. One sketch was really funny. Basically a man comes out of a house walks along the street and knocks on a door. A second man comes out of that door and walks really close behind him followed by a third and so on till there about six people walking in a tight formation train style. They walk up the street and go into… the sardine factory. I thought this hilarious and was always trying to do it. When we did a photo session for the NME we did a prototype walk but we were too far apart. It eventually got refined and became the One Step Beyond cover. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. [It’s actually this Dave Allen sketch – ed]\n\nSUGGS: Because there were so many of us, it was hard to get us in the photograph for the cover so we had to get really close together. The Kilburns did the duck walk on the back of their album, all standing at a bus stop. It’s unusual to see people side-on in profile and they were squashed close together and it was a really charming picture. So we did the same for a laugh – squashing close together and doing this thing like a train – and it became iconic. We’d been doing that kind of dancing anyway, a bit like the Skinheads in the 60s, holding their braces.\n\nMIKE: ‘Paul Hangs Loose’ on the back of Handsome by The Kilburns is what we copied, although I don’t know who Paul is.\n\nBEDDERS: ‘Paul’ was a student at Canterbury Art College, where Ian taught – it’s a picture of him jiving I think. The funny thing is that when I walked to school, I used to see this spray painting every day that Mike had done. It was on a wall at Highbury & Islington Station and just said, ‘Paul hangs loose.’ Every morning I used to think, ‘I wonder who did that? Bloody vandals.’ It was only later I found out it was Mike, as he was so taken by the Kilburns. We took some early pictures where we were in a line doing ‘Paul Hangs Loose’ and we just got closer and closer and closer together.\n\nCHRIS GRABIN (original photographer): Dave sent Chas round first and we decided to do a series of shots of him dancing. He worked very hard, an incredibly nice bloke, we got on very well. The following day, I was meant to do the album front sleeve, but they turned up four hours late. I was just about to go home. It was an evening session and I’d hired an assistant. Chas kept apologising but there was no word of apology from the others; they went into a big band huddle, nattering in the office and wouldn’t talk to me. I did a Polaroid of the ‘nutty train’ but got so pissed off with them I told them to fuck off and kicked them out. They were new and fresh and treated people like me, photographers, with a great deal of suspicion. That classic thing of young blokes cast into the deep end.\n\nCAMERON McVEY (photographer): They showed me the cover Stiff had done for them and I thought it sucked, so I blagged Dave Robinson to let me try. He was OK with this so I got them to a rented studio where I set up a white background with a soft light and a sharper spotlight within this to sharpen the image. It was a method I’d been using for my Vogue brides photos at the time. They were pretty dynamic performers and all their moves were very graphic. All I did was force them to exaggerate it to the max.\n\nWOODY: Mike was very specific about the shape of the arms – very ‘train-like’.\n\nBEDDERS: We lined up in order of height…\n\nMIKE: …more like order of importance, with Lee at the back. Or in order of the best chance of getting there, most organised at the front, chaotic ones at the back and Chas nowhere to be seen.\n\nBEDDERS: Nah, it was done in order of height, definitely.\n\nWOODY: It was taken in a photographic studio in Covent Garden, near to where I used to work in the summer. We were clinging onto some sort of rail to stay in that position. Cameron had been my father’s assistant at one point.\n\nCHRIS: That cover was a classic that we were never able to match again, but Bedders could never get the hang of it. The secret is not to look down and just keep looking ahead. He was always looking down but you’ve just got to keep looking forward and trust in Barso.\n\nLEE: It was quite awkward to do; you had all the weight on the front of your knees.\n\nBEDDERS: We used to actually be able to walk like that – but we haven’t done it for quite a while.\n\nCHRIS: I remember that for the shoot I wore a black bowling shirt which had ‘Chris’ sewn on it – I’d bought it already like that. I’m also wearing some dogtooth trousers, which I’d had modified. They were 12” baggies but I got the sewing machine out because I was sick of that look already. Bedders and I always wanted to get some 24” soul baggies, as advertised in the NME.\n\nWOODY: What a day October 19 1979 was – our debut album released, the first date of the mega-multi-talented 2-Tone tour, and my birthday. I was n-n-n-n-nineteen years old and it was the beginning of my manhood. We knew not where we were going, all we knew was that we were going to do some gigs around the country. So we all just packed a bag and went off on this great adventure.\n\nBEDDERS: We met at the Roundhouse in Chalk Farm. Boarding the old coach we wondered if it would even make it to the first stop. Welcome to the 2-Tone Tour: 19/10/79.\n\nSUGGS: The first stop was Scratchwood Services, where we were due to meet The Specials and The Selecter. All sorts of things were in the air by the time we pulled up .\n\nLYNVAL GOLDING: We were supposed to be there to do a photo session and get all the bands pictured together. It was only about 5am or 6am but it was already absolute chaos.\n\nNEVILLE STAPLE: I’d had this big fight with some skinheads…\n\nSUGGS: …so there was this riot going on by the time we got there. It was mayhem, somebody called the Old Bill and suddenly loads of coppers arrived. Rightly or wrongly, due to a series of misunderstandings, Lee and Neville got nicked for something or other.\n\nLEE: Neville and I both took a slap, and we were the two picked out from the crowd. I remember dancing backwards on the Tarmac of this car park and this security bloke telling me, ‘Stay where you are. Come here.’ I reckon they couldn’t get hold of a football mob, so they picked on us.\n\nSUGGS: Looking back, for the coppers, that mixture of black kids and white kids must have seemed a bit dangerous. But it added to the whole excitement of us setting off. The tour hadn’t even started but by golly gosh, the bonding had.\n\nBEDDERS: Eventually, we all piled on to one coach and it pulled away with every seat taken. It was amazing that I hadn’t missed it and even more amazing that I had fitted four weeks’ worth of clothes into a suitcase the size of a cheese sandwich. ‘Welcome to THE TWO-TONE TOUR!’ shouted Jerry Dammers, bellowing down the coach PA system like a deranged stewardess. It wasn’t long before it broke down under a hail of spittle from his toothless mouth.\n\nCHALKIE DAVIES (photographer): I went on the bus with the three bands and my old friend from my Thin Lizzy days, Frank Murray, who was the tour manager. There was a fabulous camaraderie, as there often is at the beginning of a tour; the musicians were all getting to know each other and I just settled in and enjoyed the atmosphere.\n\nSUGGS: Filled with adrenaline, the 21 band members and assorted others headed into the unknown. It was a complete fucking blast. We were a bunch of tearaways, most of whom had fucked up childhoods, suddenly being allowed to run around the country with unlimited money in our pockets. It was the highlight of my life, in a musical sense. The feelings are still unforgettable, even though some of the memories may be gone.\n\nCARL: That tour was the fuckin’ greatest – the best I’ve ever been involved in. It was like having the Spice Girls, Boyzone and Take That on a single tour. We felt part of something important. It was a real movement, a family for us and our fans.\n\nLEE: We’d done many gigs before, but once we got on that tour, we felt like we had the music world in the palm of our hands. We were all together and all aiming for something. It was phenomenal – some of us were just fresh out of school but everyone was clubbing in and making it work.\n\nSUGGS: It was so fast. You’re talking about one summer, going from playing in the pub to your mates to suddenly being on a bus with The Specials and The Selecter. I was 19, had only been out of school for about 10 minutes, yet here I was off on this coach with what I thought were the best bands of that time. It was a pretty amazing feeling.\n\nPAULINE BLACK: At that point, 2-Tone was taking over. I remember walking down Oxford Street. Every shop display was taking off the 2-Tone label’s black and white. Even Evans, the large size women’s clothes store. It was amazing.\n\nJULIET WILLS: Every kid in the country was talking about it; everywhere you looked there was black and white. It seemed to me that it had seeped into every corner.\n\nPAULINE BLACK: We didn’t think of ourselves as a political movement but by its very nature 2-Tone was a political statement – that black and white people could work together, be together.\n\nJULIET WILLS: It was during the height of Thatcherism, Britain at its most right wing, and along came these bands from Coventry with black and white kids playing together. Jerry Dammers was the guiding light but they were all into the same ideals.\n\nWOODY: 2-Tone really was that simple – black and white coming together. It was a celebration of multi racial music and was just so fantastic; a wonderful ideology really. Maybe it was naïve, but it had freshness and energy.\n\nRHODA DAKAR (The Bodysnatchers): It was a short but far-reaching movement; we were on Top of the Pops, we were in the papers, and we had the fashion. All of that rolled into one meant we impacted on a lot of people. People felt part of something, and that stayed with them, even for a long time afterwards.\n\nSUGGS: For the first time you had black, white and Asian kids into the same thing – the only band with black and white members up till then up was Hot Chocolate. And pow! Suddenly there was The Specials and The Selecter. So you had this great mixture of being able to play live and make records, even if you weren’t very good. The ska/reggae/West Indian influence on the music meant that it was a bit more dance orientated, and a bit less frantic than punk.\n\nTERRY HALL: We wanted to make it as good a bill as possible, three superb bands so it was full-on. Jerry wanted it to be like a 60s soul revue.\n\nSUGGS: It was fabulous – especially as a young, working class person from London, to be able to travel and play music was a revelation. It changed my life. You had three really fabulous bands and we took it in turns to headline. An experience that will never be repeated, certainly in my lifetime.\n\nROY ELDRIDGE (Chrysalis A&R man): The Specials’ manager, Rick Rogers, was very conscious of value-for-money pricing and he made sure the top ticket price was pegged at £2.50.\n\nSUGGS: It was a pretty spectacular thing. Sometimes it was a bit nasty – bottles flying, things being set alight, stages collapsing under the weight of people, the siege of people trying to get on it to either hug or bash your face in. Or just dance manically and perhaps hit someone by accident and that would cause another chain of events. Generally, apart from the fighting, it was fantastic. I remember it as one movable party. Brings a tear to the eye.\n\nCARL: We were all on the same bus; us, The Specials and The Selecter. It was puffers at the back, puffers in the middle and puffers in the front. We were having the time of our lives.\n\nSUGGS: You’d need a whole book to write about those times. It was a really gay old time, in the old sense of the word. You know, 21 different individuals, seven in each band (for some reason there is always seven in a ska band. You always have to have one bloke dancing and one playing the trumpet occasionally, whether you like it or not). All squashed together on a bus with trombones sticking out of the windows and all that. Really, really tremendous time. We had a rivalry with The Specials but it was a good one though.\n\nWOODY: The whole tour was just brilliant. We all travelled on one coach up and down the country doing all these gigs to packed houses and it was just the most exciting thing I’d ever done in my life and I felt a real affinity to these other musicians. They were really nice people, we got on really well. Obviously there were punch-ups and all kinds of things amongst the band and there were some nutters and all the rest of it, but generally it was a great time.\n\nJULIET WILLS: It was mad and exciting, and with over 40 people on the road I think everyone felt a little overwhelmed by it. No one had a clue what was going to happen and what we were going into.\n\nPAULINE BLACK: It was a bit like a school outing. We had this tour bus supplied by a company called Traffins that was pretty much like the buses that take old ladies down to Margate…\n\nBEDDERS: …and this coach would just kind of roll from town to town and we’d play. It always gets quite romantic then.\n\nSUGGS: It’s probably one of the things I’ll remember for the rest of my life. It was like one of those jazz shabangs, driving across the country with everyone sticking their arms out of the windows.\n\nPAULINE BLACK: People would draw up alongside and wave anything chequered; it was just tremendous fun. There was tremendous camaraderie between each of the bands, although I pretty much kept myself to myself. I think there’s a picture of me somewhere reading a book, clearly thinking, ‘What the hell have I go myself into?’\n\nCARL: The old Motown revues must have been just like that. We had all the band people in one coach, then everybody else behind in another. It was like a small army on a march across England. I think the biggest disappointment for all of us was that it didn’t go on to America. The Specials came over here and left, and then we came. It was a shame that we never all got together again.\n\nSUGGS: It was funny to think that, just a few months before, we’d opened for The Specials in a pub, then the next thing we were on this massive tour with them and The Selecter and it all was kicking off – quite literally.\n\nBEDDERS: The Specials had made it happen so quickly for us. Almost from the moment we found another band that was doing our kind of thing, we got swept up in the 2-Tone Tour. In fact it was a bit wasted on us because we didn’t realise what an amazing thing was happening. But you don’t when you’re that young.\n\nCHRIS: I started off sharing a room with Mike, what an experience. Then Suggs ditto and eventually Thommo – oh we had some right old times, I can tell you. Once Thommo and I had this all night battle with Suggs and Chas. Fire extinguisher fights, putting massive piles of bricks in their doorway. Chas called Thommo and I ‘Victor and Valiant’ – what great nicknames! Other sharers were Woody/Bedders, Chas/Suggs, Suggs/Barso and various other combos but usually stuck with those. I don’t know who the odd one out was; we must’ve taken it in turns.\n\nCHALKIE DAVIES (photographer): When we finally reached Britghton, it seemed like a good idea to take a photo of all the bands on the beach. Trying to keep control of seven people, i.e. The Specials, was something I was used to, but now there were more than 20 musicians to keep track of and I tried in vain to organize everyone. The 2-Tone school photograph idea lasted about a minute before someone spotted Rick Rogers calmly walking on the beach. Suddenly most of the people in the photo jumped up and started chasing after him. Rick legged it as fast as he could but in the end they caught up with him. The reason soon became clear: he was holding everyone’s per diems and they just wanted their readies.\n\nPAULINE BLACK: Obviously, we were reflecting what was going on in society within our band, and that made for some very uncomfortable situations while we were on tour. Madness didn’t have that problem. They were all white, and they were all male.\n\nJULIET WILLS: Right from the start there was a heavy skinhead element in the audience. You’d have this bizarre spectacle of them Seig Heil-ing and chanting when there was no music playing, but as soon as each song started, they’d be skanking away like crazy. It was a complete cultural contradiction. On the whole the bands were very good at cooling it. Even Madness always made it clear to the skins that they didn’t want any violence.\n\nLEE: There were many boisterous moments. I was always hidden behind a hat and dark glasses, so I never really noticed it much, but Suggs and Chris could see it coming and became really good at dealing with it before it kicked off.\n\nCARL: We’d simply point the spotlight down onto troublemakers and refuse to play until those people had been thrown out.\n\nLYNVAL GOLDING: There was a big scuffle with the skins out in the middle of the hall one night so me, Jerry, Neville and Roddy jumped down off the stage and got stuck into them. Nev grabbed Roddy’s guitar and whacked one guy on the head. We manhandled them out, brushed off our clothes, climbed back on stage and started playing again.\n\nSUGGS: There were times, right at the heart of it all, when you’d think, ‘Oh Jesus, what on earth are we going to do?’ Suddenly you realised that it was out of control. There was a brief period when you thought, ‘It’s happened. We’ve been taken over by the Nazis.’\n\nCARL: We were all white, but there wasn’t a lot we could do about it. We didn’t really feel that we should get a token black in or anything like that. We didn’t feel that we had to justify anything. I don’t think a lot of the kids knew what they were doing – they just wanted something to join up to; some sort of club.\n\nSUGGS: It was very tough for us. No one can know what we went through, seeing a thousand people Sieg Heil-ing. We’d jump in the audience to try to put people off, but there came a point where it was overwhelming. It was fucking everybody, and you’d see the National Front geezers at the back organising these skinheads. You’d see people you knew with a swastika tattooed the wrong way round on their forehead. I don’t think they even knew what the fuck they were on about. We got the credit for it, but they were doing it at Specials concerts, too. It was all over the place for a bit.\n\nJERRY DAMMERS: The amount of violence has been exaggerated down the years. I really wish there hadn’t been any. The great majority were trouble-free, but there were a few where a minority thought they were supposed to have a scrap. With about four exceptions, any sign of trouble was nipped in the bud by the band stopping and Terry explaining that it wasn’t part of the deal.\n\nDAVE WAKELING: There were so many fights at the early 2-Tone concerts that we were a bit dismayed in The Beat. We could stay home and watch the boxing. We didn’t have to come out for this. So I had this idea that it was because the 2-Tone Man was dancing alone, and that all that [the skins] had to do is impress each other, and the way drunk skinheads impress each other is to try to hit each other on the bridge of their nose with their forehead. Getting nutty; The Nutty Sound. So, I said, ‘I bet if the 2-Tone Man had a girl to dance with, skinheads would be, like, putting on a little extra aftershave. They’d put that energy into showing off for the girls rather than showing off to each other, you know, and it’d stop the fighting.’ So we got the Beat Girl up there and loads of girls started coming to the concerts, dressed kind of like the Beat Girl, and the skinheads were around them like a honey pot and the fighting stopped. There were hardly any fights at Beat shows compared to other 2-Tone bands. And the guys in Madness and The Specials and The Selecter got jealous. ‘How come you don’t have any scraps at yours? It’s like a bloodbath at our gigs!’ I was like, ‘Thank the Beat Girl’.\n\nCARL: I remember looking down into the crowd and right in the front there were 10 kids dressed exactly like me. That’s when I realised how big it was getting.\n\nPAULINE BLACK: There were clones of The Specials in the audience, and as we did more gigs I began to see girls who were clones of me, with a red Harrington and a trilby hat on.\n\nSUGGS: I remember seeing David Bowie when I was a kid, and he’d come out in GI gear, and the next week all the kids would be wearing GI gear. Then one day you were in a band and everyone was wearing what you were wearing… like, fuck me! A huge whirlpool of disparate youth had suddenly found what they were looking for, although at the time I don’t think we realised that. They were grey times back then, so seeing all these kids with their Harringtons and badges, trying to look like us even though they had no money, was very humbling. But the great joy was that we were there to cheer them up.\n\nCARL: Every band on the tour was trying to outdo each other in the live performance. It was pretty mad – in those days everyone wanted to get onstage.\n\nNEOL DAVIES : The audience went home very, very happy every night, although I suspect most people only recovered about three days later.\n\nJULIET WILLS: The energy that the bands expended on stage in those shows was unbelievable. The music was just amazing.\n\nHORACE PANTER: The whole thing was glorious – it was everything that I dreamed being in a pop group would be. The only way I can describe it is joyous pandemonium. It was chaos, but seeing all these people dancing was a tremendous experience. I haven’t seen a great deal that comes close, even now. We were just ordinary blokes who just happened to make wonderful music when we were together on stage.\n\nJULIET WILLS: There was such a massive buzz; shows were either selling out or already sold out each night, so expectations were really high at every date.\n\nWOODY: During the tour we swapped the headline bill, so some days we’d headline, some days it would be The Specials, then it would be The Selecter’s turn.\n\nJERRY DAMMERS: You can’t imagine bands doing that now, can you really? But that was a good thing about the whole 2-Tone label – all the bands were into a similar thing and we all sort of helped each other. I don’t think any one of those bands would’ve made it without the others.\n\nCHARLIE ANDERSON (The Selecter, speaking during the tour in 1979): What we’re aiming for is a family of music. That is what 2-Tone is all about. We’re not aiming for competition. We’re not gonna go out to try and say that The Selecter are trying to run off The Specials or that Madness aren’t as good as The Selecter. It’s a matter of trying to present each band at their best.\n\nCHRIS: All the bands had something but, at the same time, they were quite different in their own way.\n\nCARL: The Selecter did it like a pastiche of an authentic ska act, that was how they dropped it. Madness were, ‘We’re fucking different, a bit of this, a bit of that and… wooooohhhh!’ Everyone had a different approach.\n\nWOODY: The Specials and The Selecter were very much down one single road. They would be desperate to try and recreate the original, authentic sounds such as the bass and drum sound from the original record, whereas we just wanted to play music and didn’t care about trying to recreate anything. We had many more diverse influences.\n\nCHRIS: It was great to be a part of it, but we also transcended it really rather quickly. I don’t think the Specials were just a ska band, either. It was just a label.\n\nWOODY: I thought One Step Beyond was OK, but never in a million years did I think would we have it as a single. It didn’t represent the band as Suggs wasn’t on it.\n\nMIKE: We didn’t want it out because we didn’t write it; we wanted to release our own songs. Plus is was ska, and we didn’t want to be seen as just following something.\n\nWOODY: We sat for hours arguing against having it as a single but Robbo was adamant that it should be the one.\n\nMIKE: Dave was good at picking songs and having a great strategy. At that time, to choose that song took a great mind.\n\nSUGGS: Thank god for Robbo having the vision to make this the first single on Stiff, otherwise things could have turned out very differently and we’d be sitting here discussing the state of sanitation.\n\nWOODY: It was the right choice – it just kicked the band in, right away.\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: I’d picked something they couldn’t see at all. So when Once One Step Beyond was a hit – which they hadn’t really considered – then they figured that I knew something that they didn’t. So from then on they allowed me pretty much to choose the singles from the material that they were writing.\n\nCARL: Sometimes, bands can be too close to their own music, so after that we pretty much left it to Dave’s judgment.\n\nSUGGS: Of course it went on to be a Madness classic. We’ve tried starting gigs without that ‘Hey you…’ but it doesn’t work. It’s a cure-all song – people dancing, buildings destroyed, wars stopped.\n\nBEDDERS: The intro is still great – an absolutely brilliant opener. It was done in the spirit of old-school Jamaican toasting – in other words bigging yourself up.\n\nMIKE: For a while, Ajax played One Step Beyond every time they scored a goal. Once they stopped doing so, it went all downhill.\n\nCARL: The B-side, Mistakes, is actually my favourite Madness song. I’m very proud of the lyrics, which were written when we were very young. It’s like most of our songs, which have a message of some kind.\n\nBEDDERS: The subject matter was what you came to expect from Madness in later years.\n\nCARL: It’s such an astute observation of life at a young age. It’s way ahead of its time. And poignant. I’m a massive fan of the darker aspect of Madness.\n\nBEDDERS: There’s still quite a lot of affection for that song because it was one of the first we wrote that wasn’t a cover. It’s a shame we didn’t get it on the first album, but it wouldn’t really have fitted as the track listing was so tight.\n\nCHRIS: For the 12″ version, we had The Nutty Theme, which was our attempt to create our own genre.\n\nBEDDERS: Lee hummed the tune, Suggs chipped in with the lyrics and Mike would have fleshed the chords out.\n\nSUGGS: It was us saying we didn’t want to be ska or 2-Tone, but to have our own sound. We wanted to make it clear we never wanted to be a ska band – we just had a few ska songs in our repertoire.\n\nCHRIS: For our first-ever video, we got in Chuck Stadler, who had previously worked with Devo on Satisfaction which was, and still is, one of my favourite videos. It was filmed in location all over England.\n\nBEDDERS: It was just four people following us around on tour and filming us coming out of a barbershop or whatever. It was great and only cost two grand.\n\nCHRIS: Basically we stopped every time we saw a good location. The shot of us doing the Nutty Train was somewhere in Leeds. We literally stopped, got off the bus and did the walk down the road. We didn’t give a fuck how silly we looked. It all felt really strong.\n\nSUGGS: None of it was really choreographed. We just went back to London, did basic footage of us playing in a pub and just clipped all the best bits together together.\n\nMIKE: The ‘live’ bits were recorded in the Hope & Anchor, where we did a lot of our early gigs. We had to take a few days off the 2-Tone Tour to record it.\n\nCARL: This was the period when I was still left in the dressing room for the videos.\n\nMIKE: Yeah, we always had Carl on a separate reel…\n\nCARL: …just in case the cutting room floor was looking inviting.\n\nCHRIS: He was in the band, but in the videos he didn’t perform with us, but that was all about to change.\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: The joy of Chuck was he was very quick. I think we made two videos in one day.\n\nCARL: Chuck was very good…\n\nMIKE: …he was always up for spontaneous this and that.\n\nCHRIS: Chuck and his small crew – one sound man and one lighting man (the way it should be kids!) – were in one Transit van, christened ‘The Chuck Wagon’. They had adopted a fan of ours called Faron who was a monosyllabic young man – he’s the one in bed at the beginning – who would travel with them. The video also featured ‘Prince Nutty’, who was a fan-come-minder/Nutty dancer at the time. Chalky does a quick dance with Toks, the other legendary roadie, leaning on a wall behind him (Toks refused to dance unless he was paid). There were also some bits that didn’t get used – I seem to remember running up and down a street festooned with sheets hung out to dry.\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: Madness were a complete unit. They didn’t like photo sessions so they would dream up moves, so the session would be an hour rather than four hours with people prancing about trying to think of something. They were fast movers – it was great.\n\nCAMERON McVEY: It was a heavy night. Some hostile skins broke into the venue and a lot of kids got cut and stabbed. I saw some of the so-called toughest blokes run that night once the trouble started. But the w"
