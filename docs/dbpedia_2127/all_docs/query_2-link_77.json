        "text": "It has now been more than seven years since Prince passed away suddenly at the age of 57. In the years since that tragic accident, his estate has continued to dive into his archive, which is reportedly overflowing with content, to give fans more to enjoy from the star. Now, those handling his music have announced a very exciting new release coming soon, one which will be flush with dozens of unreleased tunes.\n\nA new, super deluxe edition of Prince’s album Diamonds and Pearls is slated for release this fall. The news was broken by Paisley Park Enterprises, the company that manages all of the rocker’s work following his death. Available on October 27, the newly updated version of Diamonds and Pearls comes in several formats, and prices range from just $13 to a whopping $395.\n\nAccording to a release shared announcing the album, it will be available in three versions:\n\n• Super Deluxe Edition (7CD+Blu-ray / 12LP+Blu-ray / audio-only download and streaming)\n\n• Deluxe Edition (2CD / 4LP 180g vinyl)\n\n• Remastered album (1CD / 2LP 180g off-white “Pearl” vinyl (USA only) / 2LP 180g clear “Diamond” vinyl (ex. USA) / download and streaming)\n\nForbesPaul McCartney And Ringo Starr Reach A Billboard Chart For The First Time\n\nThe new version of Diamonds and Pearls will reportedly include plenty of goodies for super fans, including an astounding 47 unreleased tracks. These tunes include remixes, demos, songs Prince gave to other artists and some various other offerings. While many of these cuts won’t mean much to those who don’t identify as super fans, they will excite those who can't get enough of him and his work.\n\nThe biggest edition being made available to fans includes a total of 75 songs, which should thrill his followers. The release also includes a two-hour-long concert film that has not been seen by fans. On top of that, a 120-page book is also included with at least some versions.\n\nDiamonds and Pearls was initially released in 1991. At the time, it was a major commercial success, peaking at No. 3 on the Billboard 200. The set produced a number of singles, with “Cream” rising all the way to No. 1 on the Hot 100, the weekly ranking of the most-consumed songs in the U.S. The title track also broke into the top 10, hitting No. 3. It is remembered as being particularly important, as it was the first album with his new backing band, The New Power Generation."
