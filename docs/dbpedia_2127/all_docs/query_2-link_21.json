        "text": "Every Friday in March our Purple Hour (12pm and 7pm CST) will be turning into a Purple Current Time Machine. We will be taking a look at Prince's musical output for a specific year, (even if it was released significantly later) and you will be voting on the top tracks for that year. This means that Prince's output as a ghostwriter, producer, and collaborator are all fair game.\n\nPrince was prolific in 1992. Coming off of the work of the Graffiti Bridge movie and soundtrack, and a 1991 that was heavy on releases by other artists, 1992 brought us the Love Symbol album and some incredible work with other artists. Take a look at the top music Prince released, written or recorded in 1992!"
