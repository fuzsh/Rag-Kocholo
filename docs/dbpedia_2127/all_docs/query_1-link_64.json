        "text": "Update 29 April: Amazon UK has listings for a regular release and a (limited edition?) Steelbook. NO NEW EXTRAS. (See bottom of third page for links etc.)\n\n.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n.\n\nUPDATE 4 April: Possible release date is 27 June, as a limited edition Steelbook.\n\n.\n\nSee my post towards the end of page two for links and info.\n\n-\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n.\n\nSource: https://b2b.dealsareus.ca...e-rain-uhd\n\n.\n\nPre-order Date : 05/14/2024\n\n.\n\nSRP : 39.9900\n\n.\n\nPlease note that's the pre-order date, not the release date.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nNote that the 2016 Blu-ray was done from a 2K scan from an interpositive.\n\n.\n\nFor this new 1080p, AVC-encoded Blu-ray, Warner's Motion Picture Imaging has created a new scan from an IP (at 2K), which has been color-corrected using an answer print as a guide. The result may not have yielded a significant increase in detail, but in scene after scene, the new Blu-ray reveals superior contrast, a more natural grain structure and a warmer palette that accentuates the film's rainbow of colors, especially in the musical performances.\n\n.\n\nSource: https://www.blu-ray.com/m...25/#Review\n\n.\n\nSo the question is: will this upcoming 4K UHD be done from a new 4K scan of that interpositive, or perhaps even from the negative? Or is it merely an upscale of that 2K scan?\n\n.\n\nAlso: did they find outtakes? Perhaps those were stored at Paisley Park and have been found?\n\n.\n\n[Edited 4/29/24 2:45am]\n\nRODSERLING said:\n\nRelease after release after release, they don't bother to include new material. So don't expect outtakes, they just don't care.\n\n.\n\nDude, first of all: do not quote the entire message, or even better, don't quote it at all if you just want to post a reaction.\n\n(Quotation now deleted from post - l'ange bleu, moderator)\n\n.\n\nSecondly: the first time WB released the movie on Blu-ray, they likely couldn't include outtakes since I presume Prince kept that footage at PP, if he kept it at all, and it was 100% clear that he wasn't cooperating with Warners. Note that they produced plenty of bonus material.\n\n.\n\nThe second release was from a brand new scan, plus they also created (new) scans of UTCM and GB and released those on Blu-ray as well. That was at the end of 2016, and by that time the contents of PP hadn't been logged and indexed.\n\n.\n\nThat they're now doing a 4K UHD is a massive surprise to me, but at least it means Warners invested in the movie again. Perhaps it's merely a new 4K scan (already a significant investment), or perhaps they were able to find new stuff. Who knows.\n\n.\n\nThis isn't the dozenth or so re-release of PR on Blu-ray. There are plenty of movies that have gotten one lousy release on Blu-ray which has been repackaged again and again, that is not the case with PR. That they're releasing a 4K UHD is a big thing, since the format is still expensive to produce.\n\n.\n\nAt this moment we know next to nothing about this release. Let's wait with criticism until we have more info.\n\nIf there is a PR SDE then it needs the First Avenue 83 show on it or the 84 Try Out show from august.\n\nThe 84 First Avenue Birthday show should be a standalone release after the PR SDE has been released.\n\nI heard alot of people wanting the birthday show on the SDE but to me that wouldn't make sense putting a live show on there where he doesn't play anything from the album and I think on a PR SDE they need to have a show from that era with at least a killer live version of the title track, so the First Avenue try out show would be great but the 83 show belongs on there because those are the original versions of some of the tracks.\n\nI still wonder tho if they can add the First Avenue 83 show because I think Apple bought the rights to it for some documentary about it.\n\nIt would be absurdly illogical for the estate to not work with them on this and include as much bonus content as possible, and it would be absurdly illogical for them to not have a PR SDE to promote alongside this. Outtake footage from the movie sessions? Concert video? Hell, people have been mentioning forever that PR as released wasn't really a proper soundtrack album, they could assemble a real soundtrack and put it on the blu-ray as an album.\n\nThis all makes too much sense, though, which is why there will be nothing on this release other than the movie and some subtitles maybe.\n\nlustmealways said:\n\nIt would be absurdly illogical for the estate to not work with them on this and include as much bonus content as possible, and it would be absurdly illogical for them to not have a PR SDE to promote alongside this.

It's not just an incompetent Prince estate thing.\n\nStreaming killed the physical market, and the thriving physical market was the only reason companies put effort into special features in the first place.\n\nThe time to get special features was for that 20th Anniversary DVD, released at probably the height of bonus content in media."
