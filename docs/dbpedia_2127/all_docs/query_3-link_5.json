        "text": "The first time Tink's name was on a lineup with Jhené Aiko, they were at Sacramento's R&B festival Sol Blume in 2022. Two years later, they're billed together again — this time, as tourmates.\n\nTink is one of four opening acts for Aiko's Magic Hour Tour, which also features Coi Leray, UMI and Kiana Ledé. As the 27-date trek begins winding down with its final stretch of shows (wrapping in Columbus, Ohio, on Aug. 22), Tink can't help but think about how \"full-circle\" the tour has felt.\n\n\"That was just a real manifestation,\" Tink tells GRAMMY.com, explaining that she's been \"praying\" for the opportunity since meeting Aiko at Sol Blume. \"There's so many R&B girls that could have been in this position. The fact that she brought me on this tour speaks volumes.\"\n\nHer slot on the sold-out tour signals Tink's growing appeal, and the all-female lineup is no coincidence for the singer. Tink's matter-of-fact storytelling and no-holds-barred approach is what made listeners gravitate toward her, especially women. Fans and critics alike praise Tink for her unwillingness to sugarcoat her emotions, particularly on her Thanks 4 Nothing album, and she continued it with her latest release, Winter's Diary 5, out now.\n\nA long-awaited new installment of her Winter's Diary mixtape series, the project (which, this time, is a studio album) digs deep into her ongoing journey toward self-acceptance in the face of heartbreak and betrayal. From the fed-up lyrics of \"Huh,\" to the sexually charged \"Bless Me Don't Stress Me,\" to the deeply personal \"Lows & Highs,\" Winter's Diary 5 sees Tink holding herself accountable for the failed relationships she sings so honestly about.\n\n\"The past few years have been a lot of isolation, and I've had days where I had to lock myself in my room and kind of recoup and get myself right,\" Tink says. \"This album is definitely for those moments when you have nothing to do but face your own thoughts and your reality.\"\n\nTink's music has always mirrored her own life, but the Winter's Diary narratives involve more introspection, bringing another level of rawness and vulnerability — as she said in a teaser for WD5, \"things only a diary knows.\" As a result, the Winter's Diary series has largely been the reason for Tink's cult following.\n\nTink was just 16 when she made her debut with 2012's Winter's Diary, releasing iterations 2, 3 and 4 in 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. In between, the Chicago native made a name for herself as a rapper in the drill scene with mixtapes Alter Ego, Blunts & Ballads and Boss Up in 2012 and 2013. Early singles like \"Finger's Up\" and \"Bad Girl\" showcased her grit, while her viral hit \"Treat Me Like Somebody\" revealed her angelic singing voice and vulnerability.\n\nThe string of acclaimed mixtapes earned a then 19-year-old Tink a deal with Timbaland's Mosley Music Group/Epic Records as well as a coveted spot in XXL's 2015 Freshman Class. That same year, her song \"Million\" (which samples Aaliyah's \"One in a Million\") whet fans' appetite for her debut album, Think Tink. The much-awaited project was slated for a July 2015 release before ultimately being shelved due to label issues.\n\nBy the end of 2017, Tink took matters into her own hands and reclaimed her narrative. She launched her own label — appropriately called Winter's Diary — in 2019 and hasn't looked back.\n\nWorking independently has brought her greater success, pointing to her resilience, work ethic and prowess as an artist who stops at nothing to get what she wants. It has also sparked quite the creative streak: in those five years, Tink has released five studio albums, one EP and a mixtape.\n\n\"I was just really trying to make up for lost time — I want to make sure that I'm keeping my name in the streets and that my fans are fed,\" Tink says. \"As an independent artist, I don't have to adhere to anyone but myself, and that's what's making [the music] feel authentic. What I'm trusting works for me, so the songs I enjoy and feel proud of, I get to push those out. That's the difference.\"\n\nNow 29, she brings a level of maturity and wisdom with Winter's Diary 5 that can only be learned through trial and error. But even after navigating toxic relationships in the Summer Walker-featuring \"Songs About U\" and acknowledging her battle scars on \"Insane,\" she ends the album with \"Pretty Girls,\" a powerful self-worth anthem that confidently reminds, \"Pretty girls don't beg/ Pretty girls bounce back/ Pretty girls don't trip/ Pretty girls run game/ Pretty girls don't slip.\"\n\nWhether or not she keeps adding to the Winter's Diary series, Tink is eager to continue growing her fan base and manifesting more big-name team-ups (she has her eye on Brent Faiyaz, SZA, and Drake next). Wherever her career goes from here, she'll always keep one thing on her mind: those who find the same solace in her music as she does.\n\n\"So many women and girls who listen to my music really need these lyrics… that's my reason and my purpose,\" Tink says. \"I know my lane is for the girls going through it. I'm telling women's stories.\"\n\nMore Rap News\n\nIce Spice Is The Drill Queen On 'Y2K!': 5 Takeaways From Her Debut Album\n\nWatch Young MC Win Best Rap Performance In 1990\n\nOn Rakim's 'G.O.D's Network (REB7RTH)' The MC Turned Producer Continues His Legacy With An All-Star Cast\n\n5 Ways Mac Dre's Final Living Albums Shaped Bay Area Rap\n\nDenzel Curry Returns To The Mischievous South: \"I've Been Trying To Do This For The Longest\"\n\nAug. 7, 2024 was not just another Wednesday in Las Vegas. It was Ne-Yo Day.\n\nNo, really: Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman proclaimed that Aug. 7, 2024 was officially \"Ne-Yo Day\" in the city, presenting Ne-Yo with a Key to the City during his first night of his three-show Human Love Rebellion residency at the Encore Theatre at Wynn Las Vegas.\n\nIt had already been a full-circle day for the R&B hitmaker, who grew up in Sin City and got his start in the entertainment business as an understudy in the David Cassidy-starring show \"EFX.\" As a hometown boy, Ne-Yo knew there'd be at least a few familiar faces in the crowd — and that makes his Key to the City even more special.\n\n\"I've run into a lot of girls that were not interested in me in high school and, yes, it's a totally different story now,\" Ne-Yo tells GRAMMY.com with a smile. \"There's a part of me that wants to be petty, but I can't do that. [But] when I run into those that were mean in high school, those are always fulfilling moments.\"\n\nNe-Yo's career has been full of fulfilling moments — beginning with his 2005 chart-topping smash \"So Sick,\" and followed by two No. 1 albums, 12 Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, and three GRAMMY Awards. He celebrates it all with his 100-minute show, which features other favorites like \"Because of You\" and the diamond-certified Pitbull collab \"Give Me Everything.\"\n\nIn June, he began his journey as an independent artist after nearly 20 years with Motown and Def Jam Records, releasing the confessional single \"2 Million Secrets\" alongside a \"CSI\"-inspired video he directed himself. With a fresh start, Ne-Yo says he rarely feels like he's already two decades into his career.\n\n\"The only time it feels like it's been 20 years is right after a show where my back and my knees are bothering me,\" he says with a laugh. \"If you don't see the age out here, I'm feeling it on the inside!\"\n\nAhead of his Las Vegas residency, Ne-Yo sat down with GRAMMY.com to share his most memorable moments with some of his most beloved hits, from a hilarious wardrobe malfunction with \"Because of You\" to how Jay-Z helped save \"Closer.\"\n\n\"So Sick,\" 'In My Own Words' (2006)\n\nWhat instantly comes to mind with \"So Sick\" is my initial introduction to Stargate. I was at Sony Studios in New York City working with [another] group of producers. [I pass] Stargate's manager — his name is Tim, I met him before briefly. He said, \"Hey, are you busy right now? I would love you to come in for a second and meet my producers.\"\n\nSo I walk with him over to the studio — mind you, he says they do R&B, they do hip-hop, they do a little bit of everything. And Tim is Black, so I'm expecting to walk in the room and see two Black guys. I walk in the room and they are absolutely not Black. They are two tall, lanky, white guys with accents. They're from Norway. And I'm like, These guys are gonna do some R&B music for me, huh?\n\nThe very first track they played was the music that we now know as \"So Sick.\" I listened to it for like, 10 seconds, and I'm like, \"Run it back.\" So they played it again, and by the time the song finished playing the second time, the song was written. I wrote that song in maybe 3 minutes.\n\nIt was a song that needed to be written for a long time. It just hadn't found the right backing music for it yet.\n\n\"Sexy Love,\" 'In My Own Words' (2006)\n\nHere's the first time I realized that Stargate was producing around what I was writing. I wrote \"Sexy Love\" to the skeletal track they gave me, and then about a week later, I go to the studio and they're like, \"You got to hear this.\" A beat comes on, and it's vaguely what I'd recalled, but completely different. They basically changed the whole beat based around [what] I wrote. So the \"Sexy Love\" we now know, that was not the original track.\n\nI'm like, \"I don't mind, because it sounds great, but why did y'all do that?\" And they were like, \"We just felt like this direction complemented the song more.\" They're the only producers that I've ever worked with that do that.\n\nNowadays, the producer is kind of a celebrity too. Everybody has a tag, and you hear the producer's name before the song starts. You'll never hear that from Stargate. They're like, \"You're gonna listen to this song, and you're gonna love it so much that you're gonna ask who did it.\"\n\n\"Because of You,\" 'Because of You' (2007)\n\nThe part in the video where I don't have any shoes on — the performance piece — that was not by design. I don't remember who styled that video, but all the shoes they brought were too big. [They] were 11 1/2, I'm a size 10. But I couldn't do it barefoot, so I'm like, \"Alright, let's just do it.\"\n\nSo I'm dancing, and then whoop! There goes one shoe. I look at the director, and he's like, \"Just keep going!\" So I kicked the other one off, and just continued doing what I was doing.\n\nI've danced barefoot and in socks in the kitchen, you know, trying to moonwalk and all of that countless times as a kid. But I'd never done it as an adult. It was a bucket-list moment, scratched it off: performed with no shoes.\n\n\"Closer,\" 'Year of the Gentleman' (2008)\n\nI wrote it with the intent of selling it to somebody who would make more sense with that style. We stayed overseas for damn near two years, just touring around. While I was over there, I started listening to a lot of house, techno, EDM. With a lot of those songs, there might be two words in the whole song just repeated over and over. But I'm paying more attention to what the music is doing to the people that are listening… Everybody goes nuts. These people are getting this kind of response with no words!\n\nSo I'm like, imagine if somebody took that energy and wrote a song over it that actually means something — it'd be double the effect, right?\n\nMe and Stargate get in the studio. They start putting together the track, I write the song, it's done. We're listening back, and I'm like, \"Yeah, we will be able to sell this easy.\" And they're like, \"Sell it? No, no, this is yours.\" And I'm like, \"Nah, I don't think my fan base is gonna understand that.\"\n\nI let my management hear it, and they're like, \"Yeah, this is yours.\" I let Jay-Z hear it, [and he's like] \"Bro, this is the one!\" I'm like, \"What are y'all hearing? Because I don't get it.\"\n\nI did not expect the song to do well. And for the first three, four months, it didn't. Here in the States, nobody was feeling it, to the point where we walked into the label one day with the total intention of telling L.A. Reid we should switch to another single. As we're walking to L.A. Reid's office, Jay-Z stops me and goes, \"I know you about to tell him that you want to get off that record. Do not get off that record.\" And I'm like \"Bro, it's been four months!\"\n\nThat same year, we did the BET Awards. I performed \"Closer,\" and the Jabbawockeez was a part of the show. After that performance, that song took off. My manager hits me with the \"I told you so\" every single time we think of \"Closer.\"\n\n\"Miss Independent,\" 'Year of the Gentleman' (2008)\n\n\"Miss Independent\" was the first time I ever won a GRAMMY. I learned through winning a GRAMMY for that song that there are GRAMMY wins that are not televised.\n\nI'm walking the red carpet, just soaking it all in, taking pictures, doing interviews, and as I'm talking to some interviewer, this girl blows by me and goes, \"Congratulations, you just want a GRAMMY,\" and keeps walking.\n\nSo I go to my manager, I'm like, \"Yo, um, did we win?\" And he's like, \"F—, who told you?\" And I'm like, \"I don't got my speech!\" He's like, \"You don't need a speech. You won for a category that's not televised, so you're not gonna get on stage.\"\n\nIt was kind of bittersweet, because I've been dreaming of a GRAMMY since childhood. I have my acceptance speech written already. I was gonna get up on stage and thank my mom, and do the whole thing, like, \"Oh wow, this thing's heavy!\"\n\nI've won three GRAMMYs, and I've yet to walk across the GRAMMY stage and thank my mom. I might just do a Kanye. I might just walk up on stage when somebody else is accepting their GRAMMY and go, \"Hey, congratulations, but while I'm here — um, yeah, never got to do this before, so\" and just have somebody bring mine out and do it right then. I think that'd be a moment! And then I'd instantly get arrested and kicked out of the GRAMMYs and banned forever. [Laughs.]\n\n\"Give Me Everything,\" Pitbull's 'Planet Pit' (2011)\n\nWe were in the U.K., Wembley Stadium, 80,000 people, me and Pitbull [for Capital FM's Summertime Ball in 2015]. Right at the part where it says, [sings] \"Grab somebody sexy tell 'em hey,\" 80,000 people [are] jumping up and down at the same time. The whole place was shaking. It felt like electricity shooting through you, there was just so much energy coming at the stage. I literally felt sparks.\n\nPitbull felt it too. After the show, he was like, \"Yo, right at the part where we went—\" and I was like, \"YO I know right! You felt it too?\"\n\nMe and Pitbull are actually really good friends. I met him before he became Mr. Worldwide and started wearing the suits and the whole nine. We've actually done a bunch of music together that the world has never heard.\n\nPitbull is not your typical celebrity. From a guy who's having the success that he's having, you would expect an ego, a big, huge entourage, and a whole bunch of commotion around him. He doesn't club. He does the most amazing party music ever, and he doesn't go to regular clubs. Pitbull's definition of a club? He has his own island, and he'll just invite you to the island.\n\n\"2 Million Secrets\" (2024)\n\nThe song is about owning your s—. No one is perfect, no one is above making a mistake. But no one is beneath redemption, either. I absolutely made some mistakes in my previous marriage. And, you know, one thing that music has always been for me is therapy. If I have things that I couldn't say out of my mouth, I could write it in a song.\n\nIt took a little bit of growing up, maturing, for me to even write that song. For whatever reason, when you do something wrong and you know that you're wrong, my first instance was to place blame on anybody but myself. I quickly realized that that's not the way to heal, that's not the way to move on, that's not the way to receive redemption for what you have done. You have to own your mistakes… and then pray for redemption and acceptance of your apology from the people that you've wronged.\n\nWriting the song was very much therapeutic for me. I don't even call it a song. It's more of a confessional — it's me confessing to the wrongs that I did, and realizing that the best way to go about it is to get it out and then figure out how to move on. And that's exactly what me and my ex-wife have done. We moved on. We're in a great place now.\n\nMore R&B News\n\nWith Her 'Winter's Diary' Return, Tink Is Ready To Rep For \"The Girls Going Through It\"\n\nBehind Ne-Yo's Biggest Hits: How Jay-Z, A Wardrobe Malfunction & Stargate Influenced \"So Sick,\" \"Closer\" & More\n\nHow Ravyn Lenae Found Comfort In Changing Perspective\n\nAyoni Performs \"Bitter In Love\"\n\nWatch Stevie Wonder Win Album Of The Year\n\nWith massive crowds and countless critics raving about her debut album, Ravyn Lenae knew what she had to do: completely ignore all of the expectations that led to it.\n\n\"I knew in order for me to keep evolving as an artist and a person, there was no choice but to let those boundaries go,\"she says from her home in Los Angeles.\n\nAfter building up a growing following in Chicago alongside other members of the Zero Fatigue Collective (which includes producer Monte Booker and rapper Smino), Lenae relocated to the West Coast. She made a massive mark on 2022’s Hypnos, which featured a beguiling mix of alt R&B, house and soul alongside Renae’s magnetic vocal presence.\n\nAnd rather than coast, Lenae dug deeper for the followup, Bird’s Eye (due Aug. 9). Working with frequent Kendrick Lamar collaborator and in-demand producer DJ Dahi, Bird’s Eye flutters across genres and influences — pulling from Fleetwood Mac on one track, drawing in Childish Gambino on another, and adding Jimmy Jam’s bass elsewhere. Indicative of these multifarious influences are two pre-release singles: the retro pop-leaning \"Love Me Not\" and the soulfully skipping \"Love Is Blind.\"\n\nLenae uses that shapeshifting methodology as a way to interrogate the concepts of love and relationships — never content to rest on her laurels, learning how best to grow and adapt. \"Making the songs and getting to the bottom of what they meant for me was me kind of retracing my steps a little bit and really acknowledging all these moments in my life, in my childhood, that were pivotal for me and my identity,\" she says.\n\nNearing the release of Bird’s Eye, Lenae spoke with GRAMMY.com about directing the video for \"Love Me Not\" in Chicago, blending Brazilian music with Prince inflections, and how the album helped her reconnect with her father.\n\nA lot seems to have happened in the two years since 'Hypnos.' On a month-to-month, day-to-day basis, how much do you shift creatively?\n\nIt feels like night and day to me, even though it's been a really short amount of time. During this time between Hypnos and this album — the recording and creating process — a lot unlocked with me. [There was] a lot of personal growth that happened that allows me to approach music in a much freer and kind of impulsive way.\n\nWith the last album and that process, I think I did place a lot of parameters around what I had to be, what I had to sound like, what it had to feel like, who I had to connect with. And I kind of just released all of those expectations with this and made music that I wanted to hear.\n\nHow easy was it to actually release those boundaries and work more more in the moment?\n\nI knew in order for me to keep evolving as an artist and a person, there was no choice but to let those boundaries go, if I wanted to keep pursuing music in a way that felt honest. And then being able to collaborate with people such as Dahi, who has kind of mastered that in a lot of ways, and learning from him and seeing his process, seeing how easy and natural it is to just fall into what feels right…\n\nI think the longer you're in an industry or you're in something, the more rules you place on [creativity] and the more you overthink it and try to mold it in a way that doesn't feel impactful. As an artist, being around him and him encouraging that type of process, I think that was a lot of it, too.\n\nDahi's worked with some incredible artists, and clearly in a way that accentuates that artist rather than making it about DJ Dahi. That must have been so perfectly aligned with your openness, to go in and let yourself learn what you wanted to do. They always say if you know too much and plan everything out, you’ll end up stifled creatively.\n\nIt's so true. And that's why I describe it as me kind of returning back to that 12-year-old me, that 13-year-old me, before I cared about opinions, what people thought about me and what I was doing, what I was wearing I think we start off that way, and then the older we get, the more we get so self-conscious and we judge ourselves more harshly than everyone else.\n\nWhy do we do that?!\n\n[Laughs.] I think it's just human nature. And then we try to unlearn all of it.\n\nEven just in daily life, it's so hard to not think about what I could have done at any given moment. And when you’re creating music, there are 5 million ways you can create the same idea and you have to just land on that one.\n\nA hundred percent. During this process, we would have a song idea and then three different versions of that song that hit completely different feelings — maybe a more soft rock version of it, maybe a more indie version of it, maybe a more soulful version. Then it was about having to settle into what is \"the one\" and what feels the best, versus like what's going to chart or what's going to get in the club. Having to release all of that and just really lean into what feels good is what works every time.\n\nThat relates even to how the album was announced, with two tracks that almost speak in conversation with one another. Those songs balance such clever hooks with more nuanced conversation about how conflicted and complex love and relationships can be. How did you find that balance between emotional realism and such immediate music?\n\nIt was just really feeling empowered and confident in my decision making. And that's something that's developed over time, too. Really listening to my voice and what I want out of music in my career and my rollout, you know?\n\nListening to that, obviously having people around me who are like-minded in that way like my management and my team. We all kind of empowered each other to lean into those feelings. At no point in this process did anything feel forced or like I was reaching for something.\n\nThat’s so interesting. You want your team to feel supportive but you also want to feel empowered to take risks away from that support. And that reminds me of “Love Me Not,” which has some really smart risks. It's that vintage pop feeling, right down to the clap-along beats, and the vocals feel right in your ear. So when you started working on that track, for example, did you always imagine it being that nostalgia, that warmth?\n\nI thought that there was just something so cool and timeless, a classic feeling about it. And my songs are the ones where you can really pinpoint what the influences are, or when this was made, or the person behind it. Having a song like that, that really reminded me of Outkast. Like, What is this?\n\nEven before it dropped, I remember having some anxiety around maybe my fans not liking it because it feels a little different from Hypnos. I think anytime you kind of jump outside of the bubble you've kind of created, it's scary because there are people living in that bubble with you who like the temperature in there.\n\nIt’s so important to be constantly revitalized in your work. If you’re doing the same thing, even if your fans are demanding it, you’re not going to get that. And hopefully when your fans see all that you can do, they’ll follow it.\n\nYeah. And there's so much left in me to explore into and put out into the world. And look at an artist's career, someone like Tyler, the Creator: Seeing where his sound started and how he's almost trained his fans’ ears to be receptive to something new every time. They've completely grown up with him in a lot of ways and expanded their palate. Kind of forcing the hand of listeners is something that's really interesting to me. [Laughs.]\n\nI love that idea of pushing yourself and pushing your fans, but still within the realm of what's good. [Laughs] Not just experimenting for the sake of it. Speaking of growing and experimenting, I wanted to ask about the “Love Me Not” music video that you directed. It feels so well shot but still so intimate and casual.\n\nI knew with the album and how I wanted the imagery to feel, it would be very homey. Making the songs and getting to the bottom of what they meant for me was me kind of retracing my steps a little bit and really acknowledging all these moments in my life, in my childhood, that were pivotal for me and my identity, those first moments where I felt like I was getting closer to myself in a way.\n\nA lot of that started on the South side of Chicago, at my grandmother's house, in the basement. Even the cover of the album symbolizes that transition for me. That's where I dyed my hair red for the first time in the basement, in the sink, so coming back to the sink and dyeing my hair ginger on the cover was something that felt so powerful and defining for me. It just made perfect sense that we were going to go back to Chicago for the first video, in my grandmother's house, with all my family members involved. Those are my grandparents, my mom, my sisters, so that's why it feels so loose and candid. I really wanted to give people a glimpse into my life and what it felt like walking into my childhood home.\n\nGetting to see a place through someone else’s eyes is so extraordinary. It really makes the little details pop. For example, the plantains cooking on the stove at the beginning.\n\nYeah. I associate plantains with my grandparents, my family. We’re of Panamanian West Indian descent, so those smells and those sounds, I really wanted to incorporate into the video.\n\nThat really speaks to bringing some comfort along with the risk-taking, same as having your family around. The features do a great job of bolstering you, setting up that stability, particularly Ty Dolla $ign on \"Dreamgirl.\"\n\nI think we just had the idea to kind of take the song into a different world in a way. When we first started the first section of the song, I just knew there was magic there. Those Prince drums and that Brazilian guitar — why do those make sense together? It shouldn't ever make sense together. But when I heard it? Oh my god, this feels like something fresh and new, but also like I've felt this feeling before.\n\nDahi's brain is just incredible, and then even bringing in Jimmy Jam on it to do bass was a dream come true. I knew it kind of felt like it existed in that Janet stratosphere, and I thought it would be such a cool touch for him to do that personally. Dream come true on all spectrums. I love Ty Dolla $ign, obviously grew up listening to him. He's incredible and I was so honored that he wanted to do it.\n\nBesides Janet, were there any particular artists who were kind of central inspirations for this album specifically?\n\nSonically, Janet is always in the mix. With this one in particular, some Gwen Stefani, No Doubt, a little bit of Fleetwood Mac in there. I just love taking these worlds that are very different from each other and kind of mashing them and seeing what happens. It's like my favorite thing ever.\n\nYou’re trained in classical music, and it's so clear that you understand the range of emotion that you can convey. I'm just curious what happened when you went into recording — or even before that, in the writing. What was it like digging into yourself to find the narrative that matched the mashing?\n\nHonestly, I don't think there was much premeditation with the writing and what I wanted to touch on in a way. Really leaning into those impulsive initial first feelings that a song gives me is something I really valued with this album. And moving forward, that'll be my process.\n\nWhat was premeditated with the writing process with this album was, with every song, trying to really peel back those layers in my brain and those barriers lyrically. Like, What would I naturally say? Think of that and then think, Okay, how can I make this even more literal, even more personal? Even in working with my girl [songwriter] Sarah Aarons, I learned a lot from her as far as songwriting and how to really paint a picture that feels clear and concise and emotional. Not trying to find the prettiest words or the most interesting words, but really writing what feels real. And that's something that I've really, really valued and learned with this process.\n\nEven with “One Wish” with Childish Gambino, the whole album feels like this big conversation on relationships. Being more direct feels like some advice someone would get with a relationship itself, let alone writing about it. Did that process help you actually process what was happening in your life too?\n\nOh man, 100 percent. And that's why music is so beautiful to me. It's really a means of opening dialogue between me and myself, and then me and the people in my life. With a song that's so important to me like “One Wish,\" it’s not just because it's a great song, but because this has really catapulted me into this different part of my life and repairing relationships, opening up difficult conversations — like with my father in particular. Hearing such a simple song and the response I've gotten from it has only validated me much more in the fact that these real stories, real emotions are what connects.\n\nHave you played the album for your father?\n\nWe started repairing or rekindling our relationship maybe two years ago. The making of Bird’s Eye was at its peak and I felt like it was important for me to have a song on the album that addressed my relationship with him in order for me to release it and start to move on in a positive way.\n\nSo sharing the song with him, inviting him to be in the music video was huge for us. And then even after debriefing about maybe some feelings that came up when he heard certain lyrics or when he saw certain scenes in the video, it just opened up this really honest, candid dialogue between us and I couldn't be more grateful that I have this outlet.\n\nMore R&B News\n\nWith Her 'Winter's Diary' Return, Tink Is Ready To Rep For \"The Girls Going Through It\"\n\nBehind Ne-Yo's Biggest Hits: How Jay-Z, A Wardrobe Malfunction & Stargate Influenced \"So Sick,\" \"Closer\" & More\n\nHow Ravyn Lenae Found Comfort In Changing Perspective\n\nAyoni Performs \"Bitter In Love\"\n\nWatch Stevie Wonder Win Album Of The Year\n\nmgk & Jelly Roll — \"Lonely Road\"\n\nAlthough fans anticipated Machine Gun Kelly's next release to mark his return to hip-hop, no one seems to be complaining about \"KellyRoll.\" Embracing the trend of venturing into the country genre, mgk teams up with fellow GRAMMY-nominated artist Jelly Roll on their newest track, \"Lonely Road.\"\n\nThe genre-blending track interpolates John Denver's classic \"Take Me Home, Country Roads.\" However, unlike Denver's sentimental ode to the simplicity of rural life, mgk and Jelly Roll reinterpret the track through the lens of romantic relationships that have come to a, well, lonely end.\n\nAs mgk revealed in an Instagram post, \"Lonely Road\" was a labor of love for both him and Jelly Roll. \"We worked on 'Lonely Road' for 2 years, 8 different studios, 4 different countries, changed the key 4 times,\" he wrote. \"We finally got it right.\"\n\nHalsey — \"Lucky\"\n\nIn another interpolation special, Halsey samples not one but two classics in their latest single, \"Lucky.\" The song's production features elements of Monica's 1999 hit \"Angel of Mine,\" while the chorus flips Britney Spears' fan-favorite \"Lucky\" into a first-person narrative.\n\nWhile Halsey has always been a transparent star, their next project is seemingly going to be even more honest than their previous releases. After first revealing their journey with lupus with the super-personal \"The End\" in June, \"Lucky\" further details their struggles: \"And I told everybody I was fine for a whole damn year/ And that's the biggest lie of my career.\"\n\nThough they haven't revealed a release date for their next project, Halsey referred to her next era as a \"monumental moment in my life\" in an Instagram post about the \"Lucky\" music video — hinting that it may just be their most powerful project yet.\n\nRead More: Everything We Know About Halsey's New Album\n\nParis Hilton & Meghan Trainor — \"Chasin'\"\n\nAhead of Paris Hilton's forthcoming album, Infinite Icon — her first in nearly 20 years — the multihyphenate unveiled another female-powered collaboration, this time with Meghan Trainor. Co-produced by Sia, \"Chasin'\" is a lively pop anthem about discovering self-worth in romantic relationships and finding the strength to walk away from toxicity.\n\n\"She is the sister I always needed and when she calls me sis, I die of happiness inside,\" Trainor told Rolling Stone about her relationship with Hilton. Coincidentally, Trainor first wrote the track with her brother, Ryan, but the pop star was waiting for the right collaborator to hop on the track — and Hilton was just that.\n\n\"We made something truly iconic together,\" Trainor added. \"It was a bucket list dream come true for me.\"\n\nEmpire Of The Sun — 'Ask That God'\n\nA highly awaited return to music after eight years, Australian electro-pop duo Empire Of The Sun are back with their fourth studio album, Ask That God.\n\n\"This body of work represents the greatest shift in consciousness our world has ever seen and that's reflected in the music,\" says member Lord Littlemore in a press statement.\n\nLike their previous work that transports listeners to a different universe, this album continues that tradition with trancey tracks like lead single \"Changes\" and the thumping title track. Ask That God offers a chance to reflect on the blend of reality and imagination, while also evoking the radiant energy of their past songs.\n\nCalvin Harris & Ellie Goulding — \"Free\"\n\nDance music's collaborative powerhouse, Calvin Harris and Ellie Goulding, are back with another summer hit. Their latest track, \"Free,\" marks the fourth collaboration between the duo — and like their past trilogy of hits, the two have another banger on their hands.\n\nThe track debuted earlier this month at Harris' show in Ibiza, where Goulding made a surprise appearance to perform \"Free\" live. With Harris delivering an infectious uptempo house beat and Goulding's silky vocals elevating the track, \"Free\" proves that the pair still have plenty of musical chemistry left.\n\nPost Malone & Luke Combs — \"Guy For That\"\n\nPost Malone's transition into country music has been anything but slow; in fact, the artist went full-throttle into the genre. The New York-born, Texas-raised star embraced his new country era with collaborations alongside some of the genre's biggest superstars, like Morgan Wallen and Blake Shelton. Continuing this momentum as he gets closer to releasing F-1 Trillion, Post Malone teams up with Luke Combs for the new track \"Guy For That.\"\n\nThe catchy collaboration tells the story of a relationship that has faded, where the protagonist knows someone who can fix almost anything, except for a broken heart. It's an upbeat breakup song that, like Post's previous F-1 Trillion releases, can get any party going — especially one in Nashville, as Malone and Combs did in the track's music video.\n\nForrest Frank & Tori Kelly — \"Miracle Worker\"\n\nJust one month after Surfaces released their latest album, good morning, the duo's Forrest Frank unveiled his own project, CHILD OF GOD — his debut full-length Christian album. Among several features on the LP, one of the standouts is with GRAMMY-winning artist Tori Kelly on the track \"Miracle Worker.\"\n\nOver a plucky electric guitar and lo-fi beats, Frank and Kelly trade verses before joining for the second chorus. Their impassioned vocals elevate the song's hopeful prayer, \"Miracle Worker make me new.\"\n\nTheir collaboration arrives just before both artists hit the road for their respective tours. Frank kicks his U.S. trek off in Charlotte, North Carolina on July 31, and Kelly starts her world tour in Taipei, Taiwan on Aug. 17.\n\nXG — \"SOMETHING AIN'T RIGHT\"\n\nSince their debut in 2022 with \"Tippy Toes,\" Japanese girl group XG has been making waves and showing no signs of slowing down. With their first mini album released in 2023 and now their latest single, \"SOMETHING AIN'T RIGHT,\" the group continues to rise with their distinctive visuals and infectious hits.\n\nThe track features a nostalgic rhythm reminiscent of early 90s R&B, showcasing the unique personalities of each member. As an uptempo dance track, it's designed to resonate with listeners from all across the globe.\n\n\"SOMETHING AIN'T RIGHT\" also serves as the lead single for XG's upcoming second mini album, set to release later this year.\n\nMustard — 'Faith of a Mustard Seed'\n\nFor nearly 15 years, Mustard has been a go-to producer for some of rap's biggest names, from Gucci Mane to Travis Scott. On the heels of earning his first Billboard Hot 100 chart-topper as a producer with Kendrick Lamar's \"Not Like Us,\" he's back with his own collaboration-filled project.\n\nFaith of a Mustard Seed features a robust 14-song track list with contributions from Vince Staples, Lil Yachty, Charlie Wilson, and more. The LP marks Mustard's fourth studio album, and first since 2019's Perfect Ten.\n\nIn an interview with Billboard, Mustard shared that the album's title is an ode to late rapper Nipsey Hussle, who suggested the title during one of their final conversations before his untimely death in 2019. And once \"Not Like Us\" hit No. 1, Mustard knew it was time to release the long-in-the-making album.\n\nLatest News & Exclusive Videos\n\nWith Her 'Winter's Diary' Return, Tink Is Ready To Rep For \"The Girls Going Through It\"\n\nNew Music Friday: Listen To New Songs From ATEEZ & G-Eazy, Shawn Mendes, Latto, & More\n\nWatch Alanis Morissette Win At The 1999 GRAMMYs\n\nDancehall Legend Spice Reflects On 'Mirror 25,' Her Near-Death Experience & Owning Her Own Vision\n\nThe Recording Academy Philly Chapter Celebrates 30 Years With An Inaugural Block Party & Fireside Chat With Tierra Whack"
