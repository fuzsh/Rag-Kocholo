Whether he was involved in minor, junior, pro, or friends getting together to play shinny, he loved hockey! He went to some camps and was cut, realizing he had no chance of making the pros. He knew it was time to use his natural talent to make people laugh.\n\nLife has been fantastic for this energetic and wildly funny boundary-pushing entertainer. Touring nonstop across North America, he has started taking over the world with Australia, China, and the Middle East. With Europe being one of his latest stops. His fast-paced, off-the-cuff, quick-witted, animated style has him winning over television audiences. He placed in the finals of NBC's \"Last Comic Standing.\" He made appearances on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" and \"The Tonight Show,\" A popular guest on WTF, YMH, a half-hour comedy featured on Comedy Central and HBO, not to mention one-hour specials on Showtime \"Getting to know you\" and Amazon Prime \"Conversations\"! It also has earned him roles in award-winning movies like MVP 2! (humble brag)\n\nHis fast-paced multi-direction show has made patrons want to see multiple shows on a weekend. The audience becomes characters in his performance as they answer questions. Most comedians have a monologue; Ian has a dialogue. Attend a show immediately and see why his high school history teacher asked Ian's parents if there was something he should know about Ian.\n\nView Event →\n\nFall Vintage Show\n\nJoin over 35 of the region's TOP vintage and antiques sellers for our FALL VINTAGE SHOW happening at the Lighthouse Arts Centre in downtown Halifax!\n\nSHOW DETAILS\n\nFIRST DIBS NIGHT FRIDAY OCT 4th 5-8 pm\n\nTickets: https://bit.ly/firstdibsfall24\n\nMAIN SHOW: OCT 5 & 6 from 10 am - 5 pm\n\n$5 ADMISSION - KIDS 12 AND UNDER FREE\n\nA portion of proceeds from the door will be donated to the Mi'kmaw Native Friendship Centre to help support many important community services and programs.\n\nWEBSITE\n\nView Event →\n\nJESSI CRUICKSHANK: Now That's What I Call Live Tour\n\nThis is a reserved seating event.

Born and based in New Brunswick, he's a sonic shapeshifter with more than 15 albums that run the gamut—in English and French—through classic folk traditions, impassioned rock 'n' roll, earthy, existential blues, cosmic jazz and funk instrumentals, reflective Americana, and sweltering R&B. And on stage—whether solo or accompanied by a full band—the music is tight and the vibe is loose, with Myles able to command, charm, and uplift audiences in both intimate clubs and grand theatres. The throughline in his work is a deep understanding of our need for connection and an attempt to reach out and make them through musical collaboration, live performance, or deep-digging, heart-to-heart conversations with fellow artists on his podcast and video series Myles From Home.\n\nDoors: 7: p.m. || Show: 8 p.m.\n\nNotes: 19+, valid ID required.

What followed was a whirlwind of national media attention, climbing the radio charts, and viral moments that reached hundreds of millions of viewers across the country, and proved why he is one of Canada's biggest musical success stories to date. The follow up release of \"Love Me With The Lights On\" solidified his staying power, as he partnered with globally renowned brand Knix to create an extremely personal and empowering campaign of self-love and body positivity.

He was giving up the game of music.\n\nThroughout that time working on the water, song ideas would pop in his head, and Chris would stash them away in his sea salt-stained notebook and battered iphone, not sure if anything would ever come of them. During downtimes, Chris and his family would host all-day sap boils and wiener roasts over an open fire on their property where they tapped their maple trees and boiled the sap to make syrup in the late days of several winters. A frequent visitor to these fires was Afie Jurvanen, aka Bahamas, who brought his family over for the BBQ and syrup and to chat music and play around on their guitars.\n\n“What about not playing the banjo on your next record?” suggested Jurvanen. Initially, Chris thought those may have been fighting words, and prepared to throw down with his fellow JUNO Award winner. Luckily, it didn’t come to blows and Chris understood that Afie’s question was rooted in how much of a fan he was of Chris’s song writing, and that maybe perceptions of the banjo distracted from that. This was the moment that “She Told Me Where to Go'' was conceived.\n\n“I was a musician, a banjo player, known for my old-time Appalachian-based sound, and Afie thought that we should let go of the chains and expectations that come with writing songs around an instrument, and that I should just write the songs without the instrument in mind. He convinced me to abandon my signature sound, and I had this newfound sense of freedom in my song writing.”\n\nShe Told Me Where to Go is a journey through the darkness and light of mid-life. The songs wrestle, long form, with the value of an artist in a time when music is ingested in fifteen second increments. There’s hopefulness in “Guy Fieri” but “Holy Rain” and “Misfits in Old Clothes” capture the ongoing struggle.\n\nThe album took time. With Jurvanen producing, they worked on the songs for almost two years and then spaced out the tracking and the vocals over 10 months. This is the longest gestation period ever for an Old Man Luedecke record. “I took a note from the world of theatre, rehearsing and tweaking the songs endlessly before they were ready for the stage, or in this case, the studio.”\n\nView Event →\n\nThe Dead South with special guest Reverend Peyton’s Big Damn Band - Tuesday\n\nTuesday, December 3rd SHOW\n\nDoors: 7 p.m. || Show: 8 p.m.Notes: 19+, valid ID required.

Over the course of 15 studio albums and countless miles on the road, Skydiggers have grown from enthusiastic youngsters into husbands, fathers, and mentors. And while band members have changed over the decades, Josh Finlayson and Andy Maize remain its beating heart. With new collaborators bringing their unique musical histories into the circle, the sound of Skydiggers continues to evolve.\n\nTheir newest work, Hide Your Light, Bide Your Time (Latent Recordings), was recorded over a three-month span in 2022 at Baker Studios in Saanich, British Columbia. Hide Your Light, the first of the two six song collections was released on June 9, 2023, with the second collection of songs, Bide Your Time, released on October 13, 2023. The two albums were released on a special vinyl edition on November 1, 2023.\n\nThe band’s early anthems about the uncertainties of youth are now joined by songs that wear the badges of lives lived and journeys traveled. Skydiggers music shares the stories of our losses, reminds us of our dreams, and paints an optimistic picture of the world the way we wish it could be.\n\nThough some of these new songs veer from the traditional roots of their folk-rock beginnings, the sound and spirit of the music is distinctly Skydiggers – music made by friends, for friends.\n\nDoors: 7PM || Show: 8PM\n\n19+, valid ID required.\n\nReserved seating.

Few bear real time witness to atrocities of our time. 20 DAYS IN MARIUPOL, from filmmaker and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Mstyslav Chernov, is one of them.\n\nSynopsis:\n\nAn AP team of Ukrainian journalists trapped in the besieged city of Mariupol struggle to continue their work documenting atrocities of the russian invasion. As the only international reporters who remain in the city, they capture what later become defining images of the war: dying children, mass graves, the bombing of a maternity hospital, and more. After nearly a decade covering international conflicts, including the russia-Ukraine war, for The Associated Press, 20 DAYS IN MARIUPOL is Mstyslav Chernov’s first feature film. The film draws on Chernov’s daily news dispatches and personal footage of his own country at war. It offers a vivid, harrowing account of civilians caught in the siege, as well as a window into what it’s like to report from a conflict zone, and the impact of such journalism around the globe.\n\nFREE ADMISSION\n\nRegistration link HERE\n\nView Event →\n\nDeath from Above 1979: You're A Woman, I'm a Machine 20th Anniversary Tour\n\nDate: Saturday, May 25, 2024\n\nDoors: 8 p.m. || Show: 9 p.m.\n\nNotes: 19+, valid ID required.
