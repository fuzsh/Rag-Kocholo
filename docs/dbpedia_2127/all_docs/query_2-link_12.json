        "text": "Release It is the third track on Prince’s twelfth album Graffiti Bridge (the first track on the album to be credited to The Time). The track is also featured in the movie Graffiti Bridge.\n\nWhile specific recording dates are not known, basic tracking took place between June and early September 1989 at Paisley Park Studios in Chanhassen, Minnesota for The Time’s Corporate World album (during the same sessions that produced Murph Drag, Nine Lives, Donald Trump (Black Version), Love Machine, Shake!, Corporate World and The Latest Fashion). The song was included as the ninth track on the album in early September 1989, as planned for release in November 1989. The album was abandoned when Warner Bros. wanted to involve the other original members of The Time, but many of the tracks were saved for Pandemonium and Graffiti Bridge. It was included as the third track on a late 1989 configuration of Graffiti Bridge, where it stayed on the 1990 configuration and on the final release."
