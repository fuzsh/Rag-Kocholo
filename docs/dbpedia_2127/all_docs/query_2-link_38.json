        "text": "Prince’s flirtation with celluloid was most widely recognized in Purple Rain, the 1984 rock musical that spawned an award-winning soundtrack and solidified his status as a 1980s musical icon. Prince, who was found dead at his Minnesota home Thursday, also wrote one of two soundtracks for Batman (1989), including the hit song “Batdance,” while Julia Roberts’ character infamously sang his song “Kiss” during a sudsy bubble-bath scene in Pretty Woman. Prince’s music was featured in dozens of other movies, the last being The Equalizer in 2014 (Janelle Monae's “Givin ‘Em What They Love” featuring Prince). Here, THR samples some of his more memorable moments on the big screen.\n\nDue to Prince’s career-long dedication to keeping his music from streaming services and licensing in order to avoid commercial use, many of the clips for the below films weren't available. Read more about the pop icon's legal legacy and copyright battles here."
