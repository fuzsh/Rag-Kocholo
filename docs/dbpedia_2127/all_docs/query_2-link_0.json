        "text": "The Prince is the ninth track from the second disc of Metallica's cover album Garage, Inc. It was written by Sean Harris and Brian Tatler, with a length of 4:24.\n\nAbout[]\n\nOriginally released by Diamond Head in 1980 on the Lightning to the Nations album, Metallica have already released their version in their 1988's Harvester of Sorrow single. It also appears in the Eye of the Beholder single and in the One single, and in the Whiskey in the Jar single (as a live version, recorded on 1998 in New York, NY).\n\nLive[]\n\nMetallica has played this song live 32 times, first on March 14, 1982, in Anaheim, CA. It features in the Orgullo, Pasi√≥n, y Gloria live album/video.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nLyrics[]\n\nNow I see his face, I see his smile Such a lonely place, no golden mile Eyes tell of morbid tales of his black heart His deeds through ages past tell of his part See his face, see his smile Time to die Angel from below, change my dreams I want for glory's hour, for wealth's esteem I wish to sell my soul, to be reborn I wish for earthly riches, don't want no crown of thorns See his face, see his smile Time to die I was born a fool, don't want to stay that way Devil take my soul, with diamonds you repay I don't care for heaven, so don't you look for me to cry And I will burn in hell, from the day I die See his face, see his smile Time to die"
