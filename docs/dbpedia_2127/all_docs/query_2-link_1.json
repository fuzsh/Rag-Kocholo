Estimates of the actual number of songs written by Prince (released and unreleased) range anywhere from 500 to well over 1,000. He has released 117 singles, 41 promotional singles, 24 internet singles, and eight internet downloads.\n\nOverview\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter signing a contract with Warner Bros. Records in 1977 at age 18, he released his debut album For You the following year. Prince's first entry on the Billboard Hot 100 was \"Soft and Wet\" (1978), which peaked at number 92. The following year, he released \"I Wanna Be Your Lover\", which became a top-40 hit in several countries and peaked at number 11 in the United States; it topped the Billboard R&B chart in early 1980. The album Prince spawned a top-20 R&B hit single (\"Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?\") and a top-five dance hit (\"Sexy Dancer\"). His next two albums, Dirty Mind (1980) and Controversy (1981), furthered his success on the dance/R&B charts, spawning the top-five hits \"Dirty Mind\", \"Uptown\", \"Head\", \"Controversy\", and \"Let's Work\". In 1982, Prince released the album 1999, which spawned the Billboard Hot 100 hits \"1999\", \"Little Red Corvette\", and \"Delirious\" throughout 1983, during which time he earned distinction as one of the first black artists to be played on MTV alongside Michael Jackson. Purple Rain (1984) gave Prince two American number one singles (\"When Doves Cry\" and \"Let's Go Crazy\") while the three other singles, \"Purple Rain\", \"I Would Die 4 U\", and \"Take Me with U\" became worldwide top-10 hits and established him as one of the most popular performers of the decade.[1]\n\nThroughout 1985 and 1986, Prince scored the worldwide top-40 hits \"Raspberry Beret\", \"Pop Life\", \"Paisley Park\", \"America\", \"Girls & Boys\", \"Mountains\", and \"Anotherloverholenyohead\",[2] as well as the number-one hit \"Kiss\", from the musically diverse albums Around the World in a Day and Parade. His 1987 double-album Sign o' the Times garnered a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year and spawned the top-20 hits \"Sign o' the Times\", \"If I Was Your Girlfriend\", \"I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man\" and \"U Got the Look\". His success in Europe and Asia increased throughout the late-1980s with his 1988 album Lovesexy which crafted the top-40 hits \"Alphabet St.\", \"Glam Slam\", and \"I Wish U Heaven\". Prince closed the 1980s recording the soundtrack to the massively successful 1989 film Batman, which included the worldwide number-one hit \"Batdance\" as well as the top 20 hits \"Partyman\", \"Scandalous!\", \"The Future\" and \"The Arms of Orion\". By the end of the decade, he had amassed the most entries on the Hot 100 of any act in the previous 10 years,[3] including six worldwide number-one singles.[2]\n\nPrince entered the 1990s with the soundtrack to Graffiti Bridge; the album spawned the top-10 hit \"Thieves in the Temple\" and the top-40 hit \"New Power Generation\". His 1991 album Diamonds and Pearls spawned several hit singles including the title track, the number-one hit \"Cream\", \"Insatiable\", \"Money Don't Matter 2 Night\", \"Gett Off\", and \"Thunder\". The 1992 follow-up record, the Love Symbol Album, scored several top-40 hits including \"Sexy MF\", \"My Name is Prince\", \"7\", \"Damn U\", and \"The Morning Papers\". Prince's first compilation album, The Hits/The B-Sides (1993) included the top-40 hits \"Pink Cashmere\" and \"Peach\", while his 1994 album Come scored the hits \"Letitgo\" and \"Space\".[2] That same year, he released a duet with Nona Gaye, \"Love Sign\" taken from his compilation album 1-800-NEW-FUNK.\n\nIn 1994, he released \"The Most Beautiful Girl in the World\", the second most successful hit of his career after \"When Doves Cry\" 10 years earlier; the single reached the top 10 of 20 countries worldwide.[2] The song's album in question, The Gold Experience, was released the following year and hit the top 40 with the singles \"I Hate U\" (Prince's last original single to reach the United States top 40), \"Gold\", and \"Endorphinmachine\" (in Japan), while the promotional single \"Purple Medley\", a remix of his greatest hits, reached the top 20 worldwide. After scoring the UK Top 40 hit \"Dinner with Delores\" in 1996, Prince released the triple CD set Emancipation which spawned the top-20 hits \"Betcha by Golly, Wow\", \"The Holy River\", and \"Somebody's Somebody\" throughout 1996 and 1997. A re-release of the hit song \"1999\" in 1998 brought Prince back to the pop charts. \"The Greatest Romance Ever Sold\", released in late 1999, became a moderate worldwide success as Prince's single releases became less frequent.\n\nPrince has sold over 150 million records worldwide,[4] including 48.9 million certified units in the United States, 4.7 million in France[5] and over 5 million records in the United Kingdom, making him one of the best-selling artists of all time. He has accumulated five US number-one singles and fifteen worldwide number 1 hits, as well as 8 worldwide number one albums. He was the most successful artist on the Billboard charts from 1980 to 2000, scoring 8 number 1 R&B singles and 7 number 1 Dance singles (tied for second place for male entertainers with Enrique Iglesias and Michael Jackson). He has scored over 50 top 40 hits around the world since 1979. He has been ranked as the 21st most successful sales act of all time,[6] the 26th most successful chart artist worldwide,[7] including 27 overall number-one entries,[8] and being the most successful chart act of the 1980s,[3] as well as the 10th most successful chart act of the 1990s.[9] Prince has scored at least one top-40 hit every year from 1979 until 1999.[2]\n\nHis most commercial period was from 1982's 1999 to 1996's Emancipation, however, he has maintained a loyal audience since and experienced a commercial resurgence with 2004's Musicology. The title track and \"Call My Name\" reached top 40 positions. In 2006, several compositions including \"Black Sweat\", \"Fury\", and \"Te Amo Corazon\" reached the top 20 of charts throughout Europe and Asia. Art Official Age was released in September 2014 reaching all major Top 40 markets. Prince's penultimate album, Hit n Run Phase One, was released on CD and for download on September 14, 2015. His final album, Hit n Run Phase Two, was meant as a continuation of this, and was released on Tidal for streaming and download on December 12, 2015.[10] After a series of warm-up shows at Paisley Park in late January 2016, Prince embarked on the Piano & A Microphone Tour, a tour that saw his show stripped back to only him and a custom piano on stage, commencing in Melbourne, Australia, on February 16, 2016, to critical acclaim prior to his death.[11]\n\nSingles\n\n[edit]\n\n1970s–1980s\n\n[edit]\n\nList of singles released in the 1970s and 1980s decades, showing selected chart positions, certifications, and album name Title Year Peak chart positions Certifications Album US\n\n[12] US\n\nR&B\n\n[13] AUS\n\n[14] CAN\n\n[15] FRA\n\n[16] GER\n\n[17] NZ\n\n[18] SWE\n\n[19] SWI\n\n[20] UK\n\n[21] \"Soft and Wet\" 1978 92 12 — — — — — — — — For You \"Just as Long as We're Together\" — 91 — — — — — — — — \"I Wanna Be Your Lover\" 1979 11 1 — 62 25 — 3 — — 41\n\nRIAA: Gold[22]\n\nBPI: Silver[23]\n\nRMNZ: Gold[24]\n\nPrince \"Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?\" 1980 — 13 — — — — — — — — \"Still Waiting\" — 65 — — — — — — — — \"Sexy Dancer\" (UK and Japan only) — — — — — — — — — — \"Bambi\" (Netherlands and Belgium only) — — — — — — — — — — \"Uptown\" —[A] 5 — — — — — — — — Dirty Mind \"Head\" (Philippines only) — — — — — — — — — \"Dirty Mind\" — 65 — — — — — — — \"Do It All Night\" (UK only) 1981 — — — — — — — — — — \"Gotta Stop (Messin' About)\" (UK only) — — — — — — — — — — Non-album single \"Controversy\" 70 3 15 — 52 — — — — — Controversy \"Let's Work\" —[B] 9 — — — — — — — — \"Sexuality\" (Germany and Australia only) 1982 — — 88 — — — — — — — \"Do Me, Baby\" — —[C] — — — — — — — — \"1999\" 12 4 2 6 32 75 4 — — 2[RI]\n\nBPI: Gold[23]\n\n1999 \"Little Red Corvette\" 1983 6 11 8 5 94 — 12 — — 2[RI]\n\nBPI: Silver[23]\n\n\"Delirious\" 8 18 — 27 — — 33 — — — \"Let's Pretend We're Married\" 52 55 — — — — — — — — \"Automatic\" (Australia only) — — — — — — — — — — \"When Doves Cry\" [A] 1984 1 1 1 1 11 16 2 18 17 4\n\nRIAA: Platinum[22]\n\nBPI: Platinum[23]\n\nRMNZ: Gold[28]\n\nPurple Rain \"Let's Go Crazy\" [A] 1 1 10 2 50 — 13 — — 7\n\nRIAA: Gold[22]\n\nBPI: Silver[23]\n\n\"Purple Rain\" [A] 2 3 3 3 1 5 8 5 4 6\n\nRIAA: Gold[22]\n\nBPI: 2× Platinum[23]\n\nRMNZ: Gold[28]\n\n\"I Would Die 4 U\" [A] 8 11 96 12 123 — — — — 58 \"Take Me with U\" [A] 1985 25 40 — — — — — — — 7 \"Raspberry Beret\" [A] 2 3 13 8 36 35 2 — — 25\n\nBPI: Platinum[23]\n\nAround the World in a Day \"Paisley Park\" [A] (Europe and Australia only) — — 38 — — — 26 — — 18 \"Pop Life\" [A] 7 8 67 — 116 65 44 — — 60 \"America\" [A] 46 35 — — — — — — — — \"Kiss\" [A] 1986 1 1 2 4 2 4 2 10 3 6\n\nRIAA: Gold[22]\n\nBPI: Platinum[23]\n\nParade \"Mountains\" [A] 23 15 45 — — 32 37 — — 45 \"Anotherloverholenyohead\" [A] 63 18 — — — — 36 — — 36 \"Girls & Boys\" [A] (Europe only) — — — — 27 27 — — — 11 \"Sign o' the Times\" 1987 3 1 29 20 15 35 4 7 11 10 Sign o' the Times \"If I Was Your Girlfriend\" 67 12 — — 188 — 48 — 15 20 \"U Got the Look\" 2 11 90 22 189 61 8 — — 11 \"I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man\" 10 14 — 33 — — 9 — — 29 \"Alphabet St.\" 1988 8 3 14 14 47 18 1 1 5 9 Lovesexy \"Glam Slam\" — 44 — — — 33 12 — — 29 \"I Wish U Heaven\" — 18 — — — 53 24 — — 24 \"Batdance\" 1989 1 1 2 1 5 10 1 1 1 2\n\nRIAA: Platinum[22]\n\nARIA: Gold[29]\n\nBPI: Silver[23]\n\nBatman \"Partyman\" 18 5 38 31 — 32 16 — 25 14\n\nRIAA: Gold[22]\n\n\"The Arms of Orion\" (with Sheena Easton) 36 — 108 — — — 44 — — 27 \"Scandalous!\" (limited release) — 5 95 — — — — — — — \"—\" denotes a single that was not released or did not chart in the region.\n\n1990s\n\n[edit]\n\nList of singles released in the 1990s decade, showing selected chart positions, certifications, and album name Title Year Peak chart positions Certifications Album US\n\n[12] US\n\nR&B/HH\n\n[13] AUS\n\n[14] CAN\n\n[15] FRA\n\n[16] GER\n\n[17] NZ\n\n[18] SWE\n\n[19] SWI\n\n[20] UK\n\n[21] \"The Future\" (Europe only) 1990 — — — — — 39 — — 15 — Batman \"Thieves in the Temple\" 6 1 16 5 — 21 5 4 12 7\n\nRIAA: Gold[22]\n\nGraffiti Bridge \"New Power Generation\" 64 27 91 — — — — — — 26 \"Gett Off\" [B] 1991 21 6 8 25 97 13 13 13 3 4\n\nRIAA: Gold[22]\n\nDiamonds and Pearls \"Cream\" [B] 1 —[D] 2 2 5 21 5 3 3 15\n\nRIAA: Gold[22]\n\nARIA: Platinum[14]\n\n\"Insatiable\" [B] (US only;
