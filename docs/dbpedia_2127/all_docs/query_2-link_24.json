        "text": "Over the course of his career, it is estimated that Prince wrote thousands of songs, many of which were never released. And when Prince couldn't get around to recording a song, he sometimes handed it over to another artist. No one wrote music like Prince, so it was usually easy to identify his influence — though, in some cases, the artists would transform the songs into something that belonged as much to them as it did to Prince. These are some of the highlights.\n\n2 of 15\n\n\"Jungle Love\" — The Time (1984)\n\nJim Steinfeldt/Getty Images\n\nHave you ever gone to a house party? Have you ever seen what “Jungle Love” does to a house party? Prince used The Time as a jam band throughout the mid-1980s, and they never failed to find the fun in his music. Backed up by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis (who would go on to produce Janet Jackson’s best work), and fronted by the deliciously narcissistic Morris Day, they were a garish outgrowth of Prince’s worst womanizing tendencies.\n\n4 of 15\n\n\"Manic Monday\" — The Bangles (1986)\n\nRob Verhorst/Getty Images\n\nWhy in the world did Prince sacrifice one of his catchiest songs to a struggling girl group? Could it be that he was enamored of frontwoman Susanna Hoffs? Could it be that there was a straight male alive in the late 1980s who wasn’t enamored of Susanna Hoffs? Lyrically, this is a throwaway song, and even at his flightiest, you couldn’t imagine Prince recording it. But The Bangles invest the workaday lament with real longing, and their career blasted into the stratosphere as a result.\n\n8 of 15\n\n\"The Glamorous Life\" — Sheila E. (1984)\n\nKevin Winter/Getty Images\n\nThere is nothing on this earth more joyful than watching Sheila E. destroy the drums in Prince’s concert film of “Sign ‘o’ the Times.” Nothing. But she had a pretty successful recording career outside of that (notwithstanding her stint as the bandleader of “The Magic Hour”), and her biggest hit was supplied by Prince. As an amazingly skilled drummer, it’s impossible to imagine the song performed any other way; she took on the track and blasted it full of life.\n\n10 of 15\n\n\"Love... Thy Will Be Done\" — Martika (1991)\n\nMichel Linssen/Getty Images\n\nMartika was something of a musical prodigy herself. She had a supporting role in the 1982 big-screen rendition of “Annie,” joined the cast of “Kids Incorporated” and was recording hit singles before the age of 19. She had hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 with “Toy Soldiers” when Prince collaborated with her on “Love… Thy Will Be Done.” Martika had already written the lyrics when Prince got involved, but the minimalist production and steady, mid-tempo rhythm closely resembles “If I Was Your Girlfriend” from “Sign o’ the Times.”\n\n11 of 15\n\n\"Sex Shooter\" - Apollonia (1984)\n\nRichard E. Aaron/Getty Images\n\nThis was already a deeply silly song when it turned up in “Purple Rain” (in the film, it’s supposed to be a Morris Day composition), but everything Prince touched during that era became a hit. It reached the R&B top 10 and seemed to establish the Apollonia 6 as another Minneapolis-based music powerhouse. Alas, the group broke up after its first album (largely due to Prince’s disinterest), and songs intended for the girl group were passed along to The Bangles and Sheila E.\n\n15 of 15\n\n\"Love Song\" — Madonna (1989)\n\nPeter Still/Getty Images\n\nAside from funk god George Clinton, Prince didn’t have a more likely collaborator than Madonna. The two embraced and exploited their sensuality. They weren’t afraid to test society’s tolerance for sexually adventurous art; they were simply being true to themselves. And yet, despite being friends, they only hooked up on “Like a Prayer” for “Love Song,” which is one of the more forgettable tracks on the LP. Prince did some uncredited work on the album (he plays guitar on the title track), but this was essentially the extent of their creative union."
