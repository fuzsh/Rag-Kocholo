        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n6 Aug 2024, 10:29\n\nCredit: Getty\n\nAccording to American singer and drummer Sheila E., Prince once recorded an “incredible” solo version of Michael Jackson‘s hit single, Bad.\n\nHowever, don’t get your hopes up about hearing it.\n\nThe song had been planned as a duet, however it never ended up happening, and regular Prince collaborator Sheila E. has now spoken about what happened, and why Prince’s alternative version never saw the light of day.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nDON'T MISS:\n\nLiam Gallagher’s son teases Oasis reunion\n\nAdele stops Munich show to watch Women’s 100m Olympic Final\n\nA Complete Unknown: Watch Timothée Chalamet as Bob Dylan in teaser for biopic from Walk The Line director\n\n------------------------------------\n\nAppearing on The Jason Show in the US, the musician spoke about the reason that the duet didn’t occur. “So we get the song ‘Bad’ from Michael and we’re here at Paisley [Park],” she said. “And Prince is like, ‘Wait a minute.’ He said, ‘Michael wants me to sing this song with him.’ So he played it for us. He goes, ‘Your butt is mine…’\n\n“He said, ‘What? Your butt is mine?’ And he just walked away. He said ‘Uh-uh.’”\n\nShelia then revealed that she worked with the Minneapolis musician on his own version of the classic. “It was so funky, it was so amazing. It was an incredible rendition of what it should’ve been,” she said. “And then after we recorded it, we’re like, ‘Oh my God, we can’t wait for Michael to hear it.'”\n\nHowever, Jackson never did get to listen to the recording. Why? Because Prince immediately deleted it. “He erased the whole thing. Right there,” Sheila said.\n\nAnd it turns out that that kind of thing happened a lot. “We did that all the time,” she admitted. “I can name so many songs that we re-recorded that was sent to us.”\n\nThe artist stopped short of listing which songs they had also reworked. “Ah, that’s another show,” she teased.\n\nJackson’s Bad was released in September, 1987, as the second single from his seventh studio album of the same name. The single reached number three in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nThe full music video is an 18-minute epic, directed by none other than Martin Scorsese and also starring Wesley Snipes. The narrative portrays Jackson as a teenager named Darryl, who has just completed a term at private school. He returns to the city and takes the subway back to his neglected neighbourhood.\n\nThe video version differs from the single release, with a different organ solo in the middle.\n\nHow good would it have been to hear how Prince's version went?!"
