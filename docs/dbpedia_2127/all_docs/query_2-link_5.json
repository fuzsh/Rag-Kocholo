The album is the first of Prince's that features the billing of his band the Revolution, and it was his first album to reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200. The album spent 24 consecutive weeks on the top of the Billboard 200 and was present on the chart for a total of 122 weeks. You know and love so many hits from the album including \"When Doves Cry,\" \"Let's Go Crazy,\" \"Purple Rain,\" \"I Would Die 4 U,\" and \"Take Me with U.\" Earlier this year, Andrea Swensson released the book Prince and Purple Rain: 40 Years.\n\nAlso, Today In:\n\n1966 - The Beatles started a two-week run at No. 1 on the U.S. singles chart with \"Paperback Writer,\" the group's 12th U.S. No. 1 single.\n\n1967 - During a North American tour, the Jimi Hendrix Experience gave a free afternoon concert in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park.\n\n1967 - The Beatles recorded \"All You Need Is Love\" live on the Our World program, the first live-via-satellite global television broadcast in history.
