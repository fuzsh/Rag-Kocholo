        "text": "History Highlight:\n\nOn this day in 1951, John Deacon was born, making him 73 years old today. He is best known for being the bassist for the rock band Queen. He composed several songs for the group, including Top 10 hits You're My Best Friend, Another One Bites the Dust, and I Want to Break Free; co-wrote Under Pressure, Friends Will Be Friends and One Vision, and he was involved in the band's financial management. He joined Queen in 1971 on the strength of his musical and electronic skills, particularly the homemade Deacy Amp which guitarist Brian May used to create guitar orchestras throughout Queen's career. As well as bass, Deacon played some guitar, keyboards and piano on Queen's studio work. After the death of lead singer Freddie Mercury in 1991 and the following year's Tribute Concert, Deacon performed only sporadically with the remaining members of Queen before retiring from the music industry in 1997.\n\nAlso, Today In:\n\n1967 - The Beatles scored their 14th U.S. No. 1 single with \"All You Need Is Love.\" Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Eric Clapton, Keith Moon, Graham Nash, Marianne Faithfull, and Walker Brother Gary Leeds all sang backing vocals on the track.\n\n1979 - American Rockabilly singer Dorsey Burnette died from a heart attack at his home in Canoga Park, California.

The statue-dedication ceremony was attended by Lynott's mother as well as former band members Gary Moore, Eric Bell, Brian Robertson, Brian Downey, Scott Gorham and Darren Wharton. Lynott had passed away 20 years earlier at his home in London. His grave in St Fintan's Cemetery in northeast Dublin is regularly visited by family, friends and fans.\n\n2008 - Saxophonist LeRoi Moore, a founding member of the Dave Matthews Band, died aged 46. Publicist Ambrosia Healy said he died from injuries sustained in a vehicle accident in June on his Virginia farm.\n\n2013 - Kate Bush requested fans did not take any photographs or video using mobile devices at her 22-date run of performances in London. Posting on her website, she wrote: \"I very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras.\" She repeated the request before a string of London dates in 2014.\n\n2016 - Record producer Lou Pearlman died at age 62 from cardiac arrest. He was the manager of successful 1990s boy bands such as Backstreet Boys and NSYNC. In 2006, he was accused of running one of the largest and longest-running Ponzi schemes in history, leaving more than $300 million in debts. After being apprehended, he pled guilty to conspiracy, money laundering, and making false statements during a bankruptcy proceeding. In 2008, Pearlman was convicted and sentenced to up to 25 years in prison.\n\n2019 - Bassist Larry Taylor died at age 77. He was best-known as a member of Canned Heat from 1967.
