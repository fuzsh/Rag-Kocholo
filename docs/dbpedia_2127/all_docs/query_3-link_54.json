        "text": "There’s plenty of fun to be had during the dog days of summer in Portland.\n\nPortlanders know how to get every last drop of fun out of the summer, especially in August. Grab a bike and a helmet and join thousands of local bicyclists as they zoom across several of the city’s bridges for the annual Bridge Pedal, watch soapbox derby cars zoom down an extinct volcano for the PDX Adult Soapbox Derby and head into the woods for the annual Pickathon Music Festival.\n\nPickathon\n\nSince 1999, the Pickathon Music Festival, a celebrated multi-stage folk festival at the bucolic Pendarvis Farm just outside Portland, has attracted headliners like Feist and Andrew Bird while establishing itself as the nation’s greenest music festival.\n\nVanport Jazz Festival\n\nThe Vanport Jazz Festival honors the city of Vanport and the voices that formed Portland’s jazz community. Near the historic 1948 flood site, the event transforms Colwood Golf Center into a cultural revival, welcoming nationally renowned artists and breathing new life into Portland jazz.\n\nBridge Pedal\n\nPortland’s annual Bridge Pedal is a community celebration of the city’s iconic bridges and biking culture. Join thousands of fellow bicyclists in crossing Portland’s car-free streets and bridges (including the upper decks of the Marquam and Fremont bridges). Portland’s Bridge Pedal is both one of the largest community bike rides in the world and one of the city’s favorite summertime traditions.\n\nPiano Push Play\n\nPiano Push Play is a local initiative to fill Portland’s public spaces with dozens of instruments every July and August. The results? On any given summer day in Rose City, you’re likely to find a teen skateboarder playing “Für Elise” at a bus stop or a sweaty hiker wowing crowds with a Mozart sonata at the top of Mt. Tabor Park.\n\nBiking\n\nOne of the best ways to explore the Rose City is on two wheels.\n\nWilliam Byrd Festival\n\nFounded in 1998, The William Byrd Festival explores the life and work of beloved early English composer and Shakespear contemporary William Byrd with a series of choral concerts, an organ recital and liturgical services.\n\nChinese Festival\n\nHead down to Pioneer Courthouse Square on the first Saturday in August to celebrate Chinese American culture at Portland’s Chinese Festival. Enjoy entertainment, delicious Chinese food and authentic arts and crafts.\n\nPortland Hip Hop Week\n\nFounded in 2015, Portland Hip Hop Week highlights and strengthens the rich culture of hip-hop through entertainment, education and community building. Celebrations include skating to your favorite hip-hop songs at Oaks Park Roller Rink, a dance party and several performances from Portland artists and performers who have contributed to Portland’s Hip Hop scene\n\nThe Portland Hip-Hop Scene\n\nTake a deep dive into the past, present and future of the Portland hip-hop scene with our expert guide to the best rap artists, showcases, shops and more.\n\nPortland Adult Soapbox Derby\n\nThe Portland Adult Soapbox Derby is a race that returns every August to Mt. Tabor Park, an extinct volcano that is now a forested urban park. Dozens of teams build cars to zip down the course, a great mix of curves and straightaways lined with picnicking onlookers. After the races, prizes for speed, engineering, fan favorites, and lifetime achievement are handed out to the deserving winners.\n\nHood to Coast Relay\n\nThe Hood to Coast is the world’s largest running relay race, stretching 200 miles from the top of Mount Hood to the Pacific Ocean in Seaside. The overnight event culminates in the West Coast’s largest beach party and draws more than 12,000 runners and walkers annually. The race fills up months in advance, but there’s no charge to watch the dedicated and costumed runners make their way down the mountain and onto the beach.\n\nMore Summer Events\n\nExplore more things to do and see every summer in Portland.\n\nEdgefield Concerts on the Lawn\n\nWith acts that have ranged from Phoebe Bridgers to Stevie Wonder, McMenamins Edgefield Concerts on the Lawn are an annual rite of summer and a hot ticket for cool nights.\n\nSummer Concert Round-Up\n\nPortland brings the heat with a packed outdoor concert schedule that makes the most of summer's long days and warm nights.\n\nPortland Saturday Market\n\nOpen every weekend from March–December, Portland Saturday Market is the largest arts-and-crafts fair in the U.S.\n\nPortland Farmers Market\n\nEnjoy fresh, local produce, meals and treats at every Portland Farmers Market location.\n\nPiano Push Play Brings Music to the People\n\nPiano Push Play invites local artists to transform old, donated pianos into whimsical works of art which are distributed across the city.\n\nPortland Street Fairs\n\nCome summer, many of Portland’s neighborhoods put on local parties with live music, food and fun.\n\nPedalpalooza Bike Festival\n\nPortland's cycling culture peaks during summer's multi-week Pedalpalooza, featuring 200+ local-led, themed rides, all open to the public.\n\nMore August Events 2024\n\nCheck out our picks for top things to do in August in Portland.\n\nMore Portland Events\n\nVisit our events calendar to discover even more things to do in Portland.
