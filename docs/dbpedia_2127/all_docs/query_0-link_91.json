        "text": "There's an exciting new change coming to the ticketing policies at the Mississippi Valley Fair in regard to the Grandstand acts.\n\nAs the fair has grown, the one and only way to get into the Grandstand to see the top tier bands the fair has brought to town was to buy a Fun Card - about $105 - which got you into every show for the week, a killer deal considering you could stand at the front of the stage for the same price as sitting in the top row of the Grandstand for less than the cost of a normal concert from many of the respective artists.\n\nChanges Already This Year\n\nThis year, the Fair made a policy change in the ticketing system they've been using. While the only way into the Grandstand was still a Fun Card, it was a paper ticket rather than the hard credit card material cards that had been used in the past.\n\nThe paper ticket had a barcode, which sped up the process at the gates. In the past, ticket checkers would punch a hole or make a mark on the card, but now, a quick scan takes just seconds.\n\nA New Plan\n\nShawn Loter, the Mississippi Valley Fair General Manager, told us that there are discussions around a new ticket tier system that would expand beyond the Fun Card.\n\nWhile the fair is split up into 6 nights of music, the new attempt is one night of hip-hop/pop, two nights of rock, and three nights of country music.\n\nWhat Shawn told us, is attendees will be able to purchase ticket tiers for you to attend the shows you want to attend.\n\nFun Card: All six shows and admission to the Fairgrounds.\n\nCountry: All three country shows and admission to the Fairgrounds.\n\nRock: Both rock shows and admission to the Fairgrounds.\n\nPop: The pop show and admission to the Fairgrounds.\n\nThe costs of the tickets will be scaled to the cost of the Fun Cards.\n\nWhile it's all just a discussion right now, this is exciting news for those who only like certain types of music, and gives fair-goers more freedom to only pay for the shows they're going to attend."
