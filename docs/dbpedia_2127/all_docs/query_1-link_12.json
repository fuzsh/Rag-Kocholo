This is the first prototype of MathML support in Prince, so feedback from MathML users would be greatly appreciated.\n\nSVG\n\nSupport for the <use>, <symbol> and <defs> elements.\n\nSupport for marker symbols on paths.\n\nSupport for the fill-opacity and stroke-opacity properties.\n\nInitial support for linear and radial gradients.\n\nMultiple Documents\n\nSupport for converting multiple input documents into a single output PDF file. Currently this functionality can only be accessed from the command-line. Useful for converting a collection of linked documents or an entire website into a single PDF file.\n\nColumns\n\nSupport for unbalanced columns as well as balanced columns. The column type is controlled using the new column-fill property:\n\ncolumn-fill: auto | balance\n\nIn balanced columns, content is distributed among the columns such that they all have similar length. In automatic columns, the content simply fills each column one at a time, with the last columns shorter or entirely empty. This layout is commonly seen in articles produced using LaTeX.\n\nColumns can be specified by width using the new column-width property or by number using the existing column-count property:\n\ncolumn-count: <number> column-width: <length>\n\nA new columns shorthand property accepts either a number of columns or a column width:\n\ncolumns: <number> | <length>\n\nTwo new properties are available for inducing column breaks in content within columns:\n\ncolumn-break-after: auto | always column-break-before: auto | always\n\nThe properties for controlling page breaking now apply to content within columns. This includes page-break-after, page-break-before and page-break-inside. Specifically, a value of avoid will inhibit page breaking and column breaking.\n\npage-break-after: avoid /* also inhibits column breaks */ page-break-before: avoid /* also inhibits column breaks */ page-break-inside: avoid /* also inhibits column breaks */\n\nThe widows and orphans properties now apply to content within columns.\n\nFootnotes\n\nFootnotes can now occur within page floats and within other footnotes.\n\nThe footnote counter is now incremented automatically at each footnote and does not need to be manually incremented.\n\nA new symbolic counter style allows footnotes to use common footnote symbols such as asterisks and daggers instead of just numbers:\n\n::footnote-call { content: counter(footnote, symbols('*', '+', '!')) }\n\nFloats\n\nSupport for column floats, which are similar to page floats but restricted to a single column instead of the whole page:\n\nfloat: prince-column-top | prince-column-bottom\n\nSupport for optional floats, in which content is floated to the top/bottom of the next page/column only if it will not fit in the current location:\n\nfloat: prince-top-if-necessary | prince-bottom-if-necessary float: prince-column-top-if-necessary | prince-column-bottom-if-necessary\n\nThis feature provides a flexible alternative to regular page/column floats, which always move the content to the top/bottom of the page/column. Regular page/column floats always move the content to the top/bottom of the page/column. Optional floats are more flexible: they only float the content if it doesn't fit on the page.\n\nBoth of these methods are good ways of including large images in a document without causing gaps to appear at the bottom of the page preceding the image.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nA new property for replacing text:\n\nprince-text-replace: none | [ <string> <string> ]+\n\nFor example, this can be used to replace straight single apostrophes with right single quotes without modifying the source document.\n\nSupport for the xml:base attribute and the XHTML <base> element.\n\nSupport for CMYK colors using the cmyk() function:\n\ncolor: cmyk(0.8, 0.5, 0.0, 0.3)\n\nSupport for RGBA colors using the rgba() function:\n\ncolor: rgba(100%, 100%, 0%, 0.5)\n\nSupport for capitalization:\n\ntext-transform: capitalize\n\nThe text-transform property now also applies to accented Latin characters.\n\nThe flow property now takes an optional second parameter allowing content to be flowed into headers/footers that are earlier in the document:\n\nflow: static(<ident>, start | current)\n\nThis is convenient when content at the end of the document needs to be placed in a header/footer at the beginning.\n\nSupport for the font-stretch property on Linux and MacOS X, not yet on Windows. This property is used to select a particular font based on its width if multiple widths are available for a given font family:\n\nfont-stretch: condensed\n\nImproved CSS parsing and error reporting
