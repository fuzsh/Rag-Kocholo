So good when people can talk on the org or even debate but do so respectfully. I feel I learned something from you.

MJ had been touring and opening for acts such as James Brown, Jackie Wilson, etc since the mid 60s. He got his first record deal in the late 60s, then he signed to Motown and released his first single in 1969.\n\nMJ did 9/10 professional tours, 13 group & 4 solo albums all before Prince's debut. You just can't erase that and his immense fame during that time frame for the sake of your argument.\n\npurple05\n\nLittleBLUECorvette said:\n\nThey were born the same year is as close as it got with these 2 starting at the same time.\n\nWhat's ironic is hat I googled Jackson 5 chitlim circuit and an old prince.org thread you started came up and it sums up this topic.\n\n\"A lot of folks don't realize what the J5 were doin' before they signed with Motown and/or before they released there first single. Some folks just think they just came from no where like they artist now a days. They honed the craft performin' with some of the rhythm and blues and soul greats of all-time.\n\nAs early as 1967, they were already performin' at the Regal Theater in Chicago (basically the Apollo of Chicago.) They won the their Armature night 4 weeks straight were they got to perform on the same bill as Bobby Taylor and the Vancouvers and Gladys Knight & the Pips.\n\nLater that year, they went up north to the Apollo in Harlem and won Armature night there also. They played the other theaters at that time known as (The Chitlin' Circuit) which included the Howard in DC and the Uptown in Philadelphia.\n\nOther act's they'd be on the same bill as include James Brown, Sam & Dave, The O'Jays, Etta James, Delfonics, Marshall & the Chi-Lites, Jackie Wilson, Joe Tex among others. And this was long before Motown came calling!!\"\n\nAnother post in the thread\n\n\"The Jackson 5's early years began as early as 1963 when Tito Jackson began playing Joe's guitar around the house with his other brothers Jackie and Jermaine singing Motown songs with him.\n\nAlso what's unknown is that when they started as \"The Jackson Brothers\", Tito played rhythm guitar, Jermaine didn't play an instrument during those early days. Then as the group discovered their talents (Tito went on to play lead guitar, while Jermaine played rhythm guitar and later bass), the younger brothers Marlon and Michael (especially him) began wanting to get in.\n\nEven after Michael made his first public singing debut in late '63 during a Christmas recital at five, Joe still wouldn't let him (or Marlon) into his brother's band but after Katherine Jackson kept pushing for Michael, Joe finally allowed Michael and Marlon in the band in mid-1964 but gave them instruments. Michael played bongos and Marlon played tambourine.\n\nMichael began to dance and do his own little numbers around 1965 or 1966 and by the latter year, it was no doubt in Joe's eyes from the responses Michael got singing and dancing that Michael was the reason the Jackson Brothers were getting ahead in the talent showcases they were starting to enter.\n\nAfter a high school talent show win, the Jackson Brothers changed their name to The Jackson Five (not \"5\" at first) and Michael, Jackie and Jermaine began sharing lead vocals daily. In 1967, they made their first appearances at the chitlin' circuit where they got all that notice from the guys you mentioned. Even James Brown spotted them during one show and mentored them a bit.\n\n1967 also marked the group's first professional year as entertainers and recording artists after signing with Steeltown Records and \"Big Boy\" was a big radio hit, it sold over 10,000 copies after the record was distributed by Atco Records in January of 1968. They released two more records and began getting top billing at black venues across the country as a professional act.\n\nJoe had struggled to get them in Motown as late as 1966 but finally got them the deal in March 1969 but the Jacksons actually auditioned to get the deal in 1968 where that infamous audition tape came from in Detroit. Plus the Jackson Five were NEVER billed as a bubblegum act, they were much like their Chicago neighbors the Five Stairsteps, a premier soul group.\n\nMotown babied them in a way when they got with them...\n\nMichael and his brothers were professional since 1967.\"\n\nhttp://prince.org/msg/8/314200\n\n[Edited 12/11/17 22:15pm]"
