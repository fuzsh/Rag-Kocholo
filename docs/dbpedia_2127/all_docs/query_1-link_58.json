        "text": "A major breakthrough in home casting.\n\nThis melting pot is a must for the serious hobby caster. The temperature is thermostatically regulated between 200-450c. An ordinary electric cooker does not go more than 320c which is barely enough. By heating the metal an extra 50-70c the metal gets much more fluid and flows into the intricate parts of the mould and you will get much better castings. It is also much more energy efficient and uses only 250w against an electric cooker 1200-2000w. It melts the alloy in less than half the time compared to a standard electric cooker. The pot is titanium plated so the alloy will not stick to it. Pot basin dimensions are 8 cm diameter and 4 cm depth.\n\nPlease check you have selected the correct plug type before purchase: UK, US and EU plugs are options.\n\n80% more energy efficient than a domestic cooker!\n\nAlso supplied with the pot is a bag of flux for cleaning the dross off the metal.\n\nAdditional flux powder is available (32 grams per pot approx).\n\nTo pour the metal into a mould use a Prince August ladle (included by default. Select 'None' if you don't need it).\n\nIntroductory Offer: Buy any 10 bars of alloy at 50% discount (based on single bar price) from the options.\n\nMinimum 5 bars needed in the pot to scoop out the metal for casting.\n\nEnjoy perfect castings with this new melting pot. Even 5 star pewter metal is easy to cast using this pot.\n\nOther details:\n\nSolder Pot dimensions: 21 cm length and 13.5 cm width and 6 cm depth. Pot basin dimensions: 8 cm diameter and 4 cm depth.\n\nVoltage:\n\nUK Plug: 230v\n\nEuropean Plug: 230v\n\nU.S.A. Plug: 115v\n\nWatt: 250w\n\nTemperature: 200-450c\n\nCapacity: 10 bars of Prince August Model or Standard alloy or 1.25kg, 5 Star Pewter is lighter so 850 grams if that is chosen.\n\nSafety instructions for Solder Pot (English) as PDF (UK & EU Plugs only).\n\nSafety Instructions for Solder Pot - German/French/Spanish/Italian/Polish\n\nStanogen Safety Sheet as PDF.\n\nModel Metal Safety Data Sheet.\n\nStandard Metal Safety Data Sheet.\n\n5Star Metal Safety Data Sheet.\n\nCE Solder Pot Certificate from manufacturer.\n\nAustralian and New Zealand Customers:"
