        "text": "Two never-before-released Prince songs have hit streaming.\n\nThe death of Prince in 2016 hit fans hard, a true icon taken before his time. The Paisley Park complex contained a mesh of secrets, including hoards of unreleased tapes dating back several decades.\n\nA treasure trove, the Prince Estate have overseen allowing the best aspects of this unheard archive to reach the public. The full assets were divided up in court last year between his heirs, their advisors, and the management company Primary Wave.\n\nIn 2021, a full album ‘Welcome 2 America’ was released, with the Prince Estate holding a special event last month to air two new songs.\n\nOut now, ‘7 (E Flat Version)’ was recorded back in 1992 before being shelved. The song allows a further glimpse of Prince’s methods, and his habits of doubling back on himself to re-work material.\n\n‘7’ was the third single to be released from Prince’s 1992 album with the New Power Generation, ‘Love Symbol’ – this is an unheard alternate take.\n\nTune in now.\n\nAlongside this, the Estate have shared ‘All A Share Together Now’ – this is completely unheard in any form.\n\nFind it below."
