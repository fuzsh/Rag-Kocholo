        "text": "“With This Tear” is one of the most beautiful songs I´ve ever heard or felt… Thank you for the honor” Celine expressed these words of thanks to Prince on the 1992 album ´Celine Dion´.\n\nThe single “Beauty and the Beast” was released four months prior to the release of the album ´Celine Dion´ and it became an instant hit. The word is that it´s after hearing this legendary movie theme on the radio that Prince wanted to write a song for Celine.\n\n“With This Tear” is one of the last songs recorded for the album ´Celine Dion´ stealing a spot on the album which was originally reserved for “Calling You” from the film ´Bagdad Cafe´, which Celine regularly sang in concert at the time.\n\nCeline recorded “With This Tear” at the Studio Morin Heights on René´s 50th birthday, January 16, 1992.\n\nBACK TO NEWS"
