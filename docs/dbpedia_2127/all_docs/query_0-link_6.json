Recorded and mixed in about three weeks, the album peaked at number two and remained on the UK Albums Chart for more than a year. The album has received much critical praise. It was ranked 90th in a 2005 survey held by British television station Channel 4 to determine the 100 greatest albums of all time.\n\nThis was the first album produced by the team of Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley, who would go on to produce more Madness albums and to work with artists including Elvis Costello and the Attractions, Morrissey, Dexys Midnight Runners, They Might Be Giants and David Bowie.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nThe \"Nutty Train\" photo on the sleeve, shot by Cameron McVey, was inspired by a photo of Kilburn and the High Roads roadie Paul Tonkin that appeared on the back cover of the band's album Handsome.[6]\n\nThe title track, released as a single, was originally written and recorded by the Jamaican ska musician Prince Buster, and its \"Don't watch that, watch this ...\" introduction is adapted from another Prince Buster song, \"The Scorcher\". The track \"The Prince\" is a tribute to Buster and a re-recording of the band's debut single, originally released on the 2 Tone label.[7] Its B-side, \"Madness\", another Prince Buster song, was also re-recorded for the album. \"Madness\" and \"Bed and Breakfast Man\" were released as singles in North America through Sire Records.[8]\n\nAfter the album's initial release, reissues were released in 2009 and 2014 by Union Square Music's collector's label Salvo,[9] each containing additional material such as video productions featuring the band.\n\nCritical reception & Legacy\n\n[edit]\n\nThis album, along with the Specials' self-titled debut—released on the same day in October 1979—played an important part in popularising 2 tone music in the UK. These albums were also a great influence on other bands of the genre.\n\nProfessional ratingsReview scoresSourceRatingAllMusic[4]Christgau's Record GuideB+[10]Encyclopedia of Popular Music[11]Mojo[12]Q[13]Record Collector[14]The Rolling Stone Album Guide[3]Smash Hits6/10[15]\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\nExtra material\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 2009 reissue also includes the music videos for \"The Prince\", \"One Step Beyond\", \"My Girl\", \"Night Boat to Cairo\" and \"Bed and Breakfast Man\".

The bonus disc contains B-sides as well as all three songs previously only released on the Work Rest and Play EP in April 1980.\n\nA 35th-anniversary edition was released in 2014. It includes 14 of 20 tracks from a 1979 rehearsal tape entitled \"Fab Toones\" and a DVD featuring videos, Top of the Pops and Old Grey Whistle Test appearances and a BBC documentary.[16]\n\n2009 reissue\n\n[edit]\n\nDisc 1\n\nThe original album\n\nThe first disc contains the fifteen tracks from the original album plus five promo videos.\n\nThe promo videos\n\nDisc 2\n\nThe John Peel Session\n\nThe bonus tracks\n\nNotes\n\nTracks 1-4 recorded 14 August 1979 at BBC's Maida Vale Studios.\n\nTrack 6 recorded at Pathway Studios during sessions for 2 Tone single \"The Prince\".\n\n2014 reissue\n\n[edit]\n\nOriginal album\n\nContains the fifteen tracks from the original album plus fourteen bonus tracks.\n\n'Fab Toones!' rehearsal tape, 1979\n\nAll bonus tracks are previously unreleased and recorded in mono on a portable cassette recorder on 28 April 1979.\n\nThe remaining six tracks from \"Fab Toones!\" were not included on the CD due to space constraints.

All of these, with the exception of “The Prince” (which was in fact a Top of the Pops performance only released in the UK and was used the single version for the video) were in rotation on MTV during its first few years. Some of these promo videos were also featured in other music TV outlets, such as Top of the Pops. However in 2022 Madness released two new videos for the album versions of “The Prince” and “Madness”, with footage taken from the 1981 Madness' documentary movie Take It or Leave It.\n\nYear Video Director 1979 “The Prince” (Single version & Top of the Pops Performance Clip) Unknown “One Step Beyond” Dave Robinson “Bed and Breakfast Man” “My Girl” Unknown 1980 “Night Boat to Cairo” Unknown 2022 “The Prince” (Album version) Dave Robinson “Madness”\n\nChart performance\n\n[edit]\n\nOriginal album\n\n[edit]\n\nChart (1979) Peak\n\nposition Total\n\nweeks Austrian Albums Chart[17] 11 10 Finnish Albums Chart[18] 23 6 Dutch Albums Chart[19] 22 12 German Albums Chart[20] 14 37 New Zealand Albums Chart[21] 27 9 Norwegian Albums Chart[22] 24 7 Swedish Albums Chart[23] 12 7 UK Albums Chart[24] 2 78 US Billboard Hot 200[25] 128 9\n\n30th Anniversary Deluxe Edition\n\n[edit]\n\nChart (2009) Peak\n\nposition Total\n\nweeks UK Albums Chart[26] 67 1\n\nYear-end charts\n\n[edit]\n\nChart (1980) Position German Albums (Offizielle Top 100)[27] 46\n\nSingles\n\n[edit]\n\nDate Single Chart Position[26] Weeks Sep 1979 \"The Prince\" (single version) UK 16 11 Nov 1979 \"One Step Beyond\" UK 7 14 Jan 1980 \"My Girl\" UK 3 10 Apr 1980 \"Night Boat to Cairo\" UK 6 8\n\nCertifications and sales\n\n[edit]\n\nPersonnel\n\n[edit]\n\nGraham \"Suggs\" McPherson – lead vocals\n\nMike Barson – keyboards\n\nChris Foreman – guitars\n\nMark Bedford – bass\n\nLee Thompson – saxophones, backing vocals, lead vocals on tracks 5 and 10\n\nDan Woodgate – drums, percussion\n\nAdditional personnel\n\nCathal \"Chas Smash\" Smyth – backing vocals, \"various shouts and fancy footwork\", lead vocals on tracks 1 and 15\n\nNOTE: Smyth was not an official member of the band at the time of the album's recording or release.
