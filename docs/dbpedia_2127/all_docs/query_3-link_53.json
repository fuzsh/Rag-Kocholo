That’s why we’re asking parents and caregivers to help us preserve the FNOW experience for our downtown merchants and visitors by supervising their children. With your help, we can fulfill our commitment to ensure that FNOW offers a positive atmosphere where friends and family gather for a time of safe fun.\n\nWeather Updates\n\nIn the event of inclement weather on the day of a concert, organizers will announce a decision on whether to proceed as early as possible. Updated concert information will be posted on the Town’s website, Nextdoor site and Facebook page. Smart phone users who have downloaded the Town app will also receive a push notification message concerning any schedule changes. Please note: Due to the popularity of FNOW, organizers will make every effort to proceed with the concert as scheduled. However, when severe weather threatens, the safety of visitors, sponsors and performers is our number one priority. As a result, decisions on whether to continue or cancel a concert are based entirely on the potential risks posed by inclement weather.\n\nReview our weather policy\n\nFriday Night on White App\n\nAndroid and iPhone users can have a handy pocket guide to Friday Night on White in the palm of their hands by downloading the Town of Wake Forest app and utilizing the app's \"Friday Night on White\" function.
