        "text": "Today, The Prince Estate in partnership with Warner Records, releases “I Could Never Take The Place Of Your Man (1979 Version),” a previously unheard recording from Prince’s legendary vault that will be featured on the expanded reissue of Prince’s iconic Sign O’ The Times out September 25.\n\n“I Could Never Take The Place Of Your Man (1979 Version)” was recorded at Hollywood Sound Recorders, Studio A on May 23, 1979, and engineered by Bob Mockler. It is the oldest recording in the Super Deluxe Edition collection, dating back to sessions for Prince’s self-titled 1979 album. Its basic elements are minimal: live drums and claps, bass, guitar, synth, and nine layers of Prince’s voice.\n\nThe track was retrieved from the vault in June 1986 and re-recorded, with Prince adding a solo and updating the sound, and that new version was given a prominent place on the unreleased Dream Factory and Crystal Ball collections before finally being released on Sign O’ The Times.\n\nListen to ‘I Could Never Take The Place Of Your Man (1979 Version)’ – BELOW:\n\nCheck out @prince on Instagram and Twitter for never-before-seen handwritten lyrics for “I Could Never Take The Place Of Your Man”.\n\nThe new Sign O’ The Times expanded reissue will be available this fall via all physical, digital and streaming partners, with the classic album remastered for the very first time. The Super Deluxe edition features 63 previously unreleased tracks, as well as a previously unreleased 2+ hour video concert performance from the vault."
