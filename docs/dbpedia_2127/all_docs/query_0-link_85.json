        "text": "By Martine Ehrenclou\n\nWith Aerosmith bidding farewell to touring, it’s the perfect moment to celebrate one of the greatest rock bands of all time. Here’s a list of their top 10 albums—my personal favorites mixed with some fan preferences. While this is subjective, it’s a tribute to a legendary band that has shaped rock history.\n\nAerosmith, often hailed as America’s greatest rock band, boasts an impressive discography: 15 studio albums, six live albums, 16 compilation albums, and two EPs. With over 150 million albums sold, they are the biggest-selling rock band in U.S. history. Their catalog is packed with hits and classics like “Walk This Way,” “Train Kept A Rollin’,” “Back In The Saddle,” “Dream On,” “Draw The Line,” and “Seasons Of Wither.” They’ve won four Grammy Awards (from 17 nominations) and six American Music Awards (from ten nominations). Aerosmith has not only been pioneers in hard rock but also maintained their headliner status over decades. For those new to Aerosmith, especially if you’re into bands like Dirty Honey, you’ll hear their influence loud and clear when you dive into the albums below.\n\nFormed in Boston in 1970, Aerosmith’s lineup includes Steven Tyler (lead vocals), Joe Perry (guitar), Tom Hamilton (bass), Joey Kramer (drums), and Brad Whitford (guitar). Their music, rooted in blues-based rock, also incorporates elements of heavy metal, R&B, and pop. Aerosmith has been a staple in rock music since their hit single “Dream On” from their 1973 self-titled debut.\n\nThe band’s next four albums—Get Your Wings, Toys in the Attic, Rocks, and Draw the Line—constituted one of the greatest album runs in rock history, solidifying Aerosmith’s legendary status. By the late ’70s, they were bona fide rock royalty.\n\nThe 1980s were challenging for Aerosmith due to personal issues, but they staged a remarkable comeback with Rock in a Hard Place (1982) and Done with Mirrors (1985). Despite internal struggles and drug issues, their collaboration with Run-DMC on “Walk This Way” in 1986 catapulted them back into the spotlight. The video was a massive MTV hit, ushering in a new era for the band. Their resurgence continued with Permanent Vacation (1987) and its hit single “Dude (Looks Like a Lady),” followed by Pump (1989) and Get a Grip (1993), both of which produced hit singles and won Grammy Awards. Subsequent albums include Nine Lives (1997), Just Push Play (2001), Honkin’ on Bobo (2004), and Music from Another Dimension! (2012).\n\nHere are my top 10 favorite Aerosmith albums, each with a short description and a hand-picked song. Feel free to share your thoughts and your favorite Aerosmith albums in the comments below. Enjoy!\n\n1. Rocks (1976)\n\nReleased in 1976, Rocks influenced bands like Guns N’ Roses, Metallica, and Nirvana. Despite mixed critical reviews, it went quadruple platinum, featuring powerful tracks like “Back in the Saddle” and “Last Child.” This album showcases Aerosmith at their raw, hard-hitting best.\n\nListen “Back In The Saddle” Here\n\n2. Toys in the Attic (1975)\n\nA blues-based rock knockout album, Toys in the Attic features iconic tracks like “Sweet Emotion,” “Walk This Way,” and the title track. Tyler’s voice and Perry’s guitar riffs made Aerosmith listeners die-hard fans. The album’s commercial success (selling 9 million copies) and its reintroduction into the mainstream via Run-DMC’s cover of “Walk This Way” are testaments to its enduring impact. Listen “Walk This Way” Here\n\n3. Get Your Wings (1974)\n\nTheir second studio album and the first produced by Jack Douglas, Get Your Wings is a blues-infused and rocks hard. Certified triple platinum, it includes standouts like “Seasons of Wither,” “Same Old Song and Dance,” and The Yardbirds’ “Train Kept A Rollin’.”\n\nListen “Train Kept A Rollin'” Here\n\n4. Aerosmith (1973)\n\nTheir self-titled debut features the timeless hit “Dream On.” Despite its raw production, the album hints at the band’s potential. Tracks like “One Way Street” showcase early glimpses of Tyler’s vocal prowess and the band’s musical chemistry.\n\nListen “Dream On” Here\n\n5. Draw the Line (1977)\n\nThough not initially well-received, Draw the Line has gained appreciation over time. Released in 1977, it reflects the band’s turbulent lifestyle but still delivers rock gems like “Draw the Line” and “Get It Up.”\n\nListen “Get It Up” Here\n\n6. Pump (1989)\n\nPump features hits like “Janie’s Got a Gun” and “Love in an Elevator.” It marked a significant comeback for Aerosmith, earning them their first Grammy Award and reestablishing their presence in the rock scene.\n\nListen “Janie’s Got A Gun” Here\n\n7. Permanent Vacation (1987)\n\nThis album marks Aerosmith’s return to form with a more pop-metal sound. Featuring hits like “Rag Doll” and “Dude (Looks Like a Lady),” it was their first to receive heavy MTV airplay and helped rejuvenate their career.\n\nListen “Rag Doll” Here\n\n8. Get a Grip (1993)\n\nFeaturing guest appearances by Don Henley and Lenny Kravitz, Get a Grip became their best-selling studio album worldwide. It includes Grammy-winning tracks “Livin’ on the Edge” and “Crazy,” solidifying Aerosmith’s status in the ‘90s rock scene.\n\nListen “Crazy” Here\n\n9. Night in the Ruts (1979)\n\nRecorded during a tumultuous period, Night in the Ruts saw Joe Perry leave the band mid-recording. Despite internal struggles, it includes notable tracks like “Remember (Walking in the Sand)” and showcases the band’s resilience.\n\nListen “Remember Walking In The Sand” Here\n\n10. Honkin’ on Bobo (2004)\n\nA return to their blues roots, Honkin’ on Bobo features covers of blues classics and one new song. Produced by Jack Douglas, it captures the raw energy of early Aerosmith and pays homage to their musical influences.\n\nListen “Please Don’t Go” Here"
