        "text": "Larry J. DeMars, age 74, passed away on July 31st, 2024. He died peacefully in his home surrounded by his family.\n\nMass of Christian Burial will be held 10:30 a.m. Tuesday, August 6, 2024, at St. Timothy Catholic Church, Maple Lake with Fr. Kevin Magner as Celebrant. Burial will follow at St. Charles Cemetery, Maple Lake. Visitation will be held 4-7 p.m. on Monday and from 9-10 a.m. on Tuesday, both at Dingmann Funeral Care Chapel, Maple Lake. There will be a prayer service at 7:00 p.m. on Monday at the funeral home.\n\nLarry John DeMars was born on October 22, 1949, to Gerald and Florence (Zachman) DeMars and was the 6th of 11 children in the family. As he weighed over 11 pounds at birth the doctor said “Gerry, you’ll need to butcher another side of beef now”.\n\nLarry started school at St Mary’s in Waverly. Catholic school and church were a big part of life. His youth was spent doing chores on the family farm in Montrose, participating in much loved sports, and spending several weeks in the summer at the Zachman farm. He spent his last two years of high school at Buffalo and graduated with the class of 1967.\n\nHe was drafted into the Army and sent to Vietnam in 1970. During his tour he earned a purple heart and bronze star. He was honorably discharged in March of 1971 and ended his service with many lifelong friends and experiences.\n\nWhen returning home he knew he wanted a career and was ready to pursue one. As a 22 year old freshman, he started St. Cloud State University in the fall of 1971 and met Kathy Lewandowski during the dance at freshman orientation. Larry and Kathy were married on October 28, 1972. As he had a growing family, he completed his bachelor degree in accounting in 3 years.\n\nLarry loved to compete in and follow sports. While in college he was on football and basketball teams through the Saint Cloud Vet’s Club. After college he continued to be a member of many softball and basketball teams into his forties.\n\nLarry started at the Wright County Courthouse as an accounting manager in 1979 where he worked until his retirement in 2013. During this time, he mentored many people professionally and personally and was known as a much respected boss. His second “job” was working on his 40-acre farm that his family moved to in 1981. He taught his children and grandchildren how to bale hay, take care of animals, and most of all, to work hard. He still had time for fun with his family on out of state road trips and “boys” outings. Neither of which slowed down in retirement.\n\nHe is survived by his wife of 51 years, Kathy; daughter, Kori (Dave) Johnson; sons, Ryan (Kristin) DeMars and Aaron (Jill) DeMars; grandchildren, Abbey, Adam, Cole (Rachel), Lauren, Reid, Mirielle, Ben, and Teddy; siblings, Frank (Lana), Phil (Kim), Catherine (David) Jeanne, Neal (Sue), Victoria (Bob), and Annette (Ken); and sisters-in-law, Judy and Sheri. He was preceded in death by his parents, Gerald and Florence; brothers, Vince, Cyril, and Ray; brother-in-law, Conrad; and his son, Michael.\n\nThe casket bearers will be Anjanet Kalinowski, Brian McQueen, Michael Odenthal, Brett Lindberg, Kirby Moynagh, Raymond DeMars, and Adam Johnson. Krista Elsenpeter and Anne Pribyl will provide the music for the service. Arrangements are entrusted with Dingmann Funeral Care Burial and Cremation Services of Maple Lake.\n\nObituary, Guestbook, Tribute Video, and Service webcast online at www.dingmannfuneral.com"
