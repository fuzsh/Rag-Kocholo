        "text": "Wonderful Ass - 4.5/5\n\nI absolutely love this tune! It is amazing and was one of the songs I was stoked to hear an official version of the most when it was announced to be on the Purple Rain deluxe edition. The groove is infectious, the minor key note choices in the verse melody is really cool, and the song just has this vibe that is in my opinion in the same vein as D.M.S.R. but a bit evolved. The \"so wonderful\" refrain is incredibly catchy as well.\n\nAnd cards on the table, it is hard not to hear the subject matter and not think of Vanity lol just had to add that too\n\nWhen the Purple Rain deluxe was announced with the message that the vault was finally going to be opened (outside of Prince's control) I had very high expectations about the songs. All the stories that were told over the years about the size and quality of the vault made me expect 5* after 5* songs to be included on these discs. Songs rivaling the quality of Let's Go Crazy, Rasberry Beret, How Come U Don't Call Me Anymore, etc. Well, I know now that was an unrealistic expectation. Not every vault song is an absolute winner.\n\nBut, if you take every song/jam as is then there is still lots of great stuff to discover. And that brings me to Wonderful Ass. It is a great, funky tune. It might not be an absolute classic, but it's certainly another fine slice of Prince. And that justifies its release after all this time as it still adds to his massive body of work.\n\n4/5\n\nWonderful Ass is one of my most loved vault songs!\n\nFor this song, the Wendy and Lisa enhancements work out great. Not that the 1983 original version was lacking (it’s also a great song and just as good), but the extra touch just works. “The Revolution will be heard!”. Let the fun begin!\n\nThe songs is, like Strange Relationship for example, a song about Vanity and their relationship. This time he was in a fun mood and it shows (we have our differences, but “you’ve got a wonderful ass”).\n\nThese differences are perfectly shaped in the background lyrics (by Jill) that ‘answer’ Prince’s lyrics. Too funny\n\nJill helped out with the game to say as many words ending with -ate as they can. Kinda reminds me to G-Spot that was recorded around the same time.\n\nOf course, after Vanity left Prince just said that he wrote the song for his next lover...\n\nThis is a 5 out of 5\n\nToday there are two songs that were released as one: \"Our Destiny/RoadHouse Garden\"\n\n\"Our Destiny\" was written by Prince and produced by Prince and an uncredited Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman. Strng and horn arrangements are by Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman. Basic tracks were recorded live on June 7th, 1984 at First Avenue club in Minneapolis. All or nearly all of the basic tracks were overdubbed and replaced in the studio afterwards.\n\nStill later, on September 27th-29th, Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman worked further on the track with Prince not present at the sessions; Prince's lead vocal was wiped and brass, strings, lead vocals by Lisa Coleman were overdubbed and then the next day Lisa's vocal was wiped and Jill Jones' lead vocal was recorded.\n\nJill Jones:lead vocals\n\nPrince: guitar, instruments\n\nWendy Melvoin: backing vocals\n\nLisa Coleman: backing vocals\n\nThe Revolution played on the basic tracks, it seems that most of their parts were wiped and overdubbed by Prince but some of them might have made the final version and at any rate they deserve some credit.\n\nMatt Fink: keyboards\n\nBobby Z: Drums\n\nLisa Coleman: keyboards\n\nBrown Mark: bass\n\nWendy Melvoin: guitar\n\nNOTE: the strings that open this song were later re-used to open \"The Ladder\" on Around the World in a Day.\n\n\"RoadHouse Garden\" was written and produced by Prince.\n\nThis song was recorded in May 1984 at the Flying Cloud Warehouse studio in Prairie Eden, Minnesota. A live version was also recorded at the First Avenue on June 7th, 1984 (the same as the basic tracks for \"Our Destiny\", however that version remains in the Vault.\n\nPrince: all vocals and instruments except:\n\nWendy Melvoin: backing vocals\n\nLisa Coleman: backing vocals\n\nThe songs were released on Purple Rain Expanded and Deluxe presented together as one track: they were also presented together live as we hear them here.\n\nHowever it's not certain if this was done because Prince wanted them together or if they were presented together this way because there were only a set number of songs allowed on the release of Purple Rain Deluxe and Expanded Vault disc.\n\nThe songs were considered for inclusion on Roadhouse Garden the unreleased Prince and the Revolution album from 1998-1999.\n\nFor the purpose of this thread I will consider them together as one track: I believe that Prince intended it that way."
