Prince Singles

This section presents all commercial singles released by Prince, and / or his record companies around the world, regardless of format or variant. A record is eligible as single if it was released on retail market, e.g. available for purchase for the general public in a record store, a digital store, or at a Prince concert merchandise stall. Singles pressed in only one country will be listed here if they were available for purchase. Jukebox singles are not eligible as singles if they haven’t received a proper retail release (example: Baby I’m A Star b/w I Would Die 4 U 7" from Malaysia).

Details such as format (7", 12", Cassette, 3"CD, 5"CD or Digital), variants and reissues are detailed in the corresponding single page, with full details.

Songs made available for download without being specifically marketed as singles are listed on the Downloads page.

Promotional records are not reputed being commercial releases and are therefore listed in Promo Only Singles.
