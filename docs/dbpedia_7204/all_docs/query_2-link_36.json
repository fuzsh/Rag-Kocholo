        "text": "“The Matrix,” “Zombieland,” “WALL-E,” and “Snowpiercer” are all examples of apocalyptic movies. We’re obsessed with them, but why? Dr. Amy Merrill Willis, associate professor of religious studies and chair of the department, explains the appeal of dystopian worlds in our new video series, “A Smarter U: Essays by Experts at University of Lynchburg.”\n\nQ: How does a religion professor become interested in studying apocalyptic movies?\n\nA: I specialize in the apocalyptic visions of the Book of Daniel, and I’ve long been interested in the Book of Revelation. The first time I noticed the connection between those ancient sacred texts and contemporary movies was when “Alien 3” came out in 1992. I was working on my master’s degree at the time. I was thrilled to see the storyline explicitly drawing parallels between the alien and the beast from the Book of Revelation, but for secular audiences. I began noticing how often horror or thriller movies reference apocalyptic themes, and that movies, more generally, frequently reference biblical themes. My very favorite things coming together!\n\nQ: What makes them so compelling?\n\nA: Americans have a long cultural history of apocalyptic thinking going back to our Puritan roots. Some of those Puritans who shaped early American culture thought that the fledgling American colonies were the be-all and end-all of God’s plans for history. Historically, however, that apocalyptic thinking came to us via the Bible. The Bible’s way of thinking about human history is that it’s moving toward an end goal or final purpose. Apocalyptic movies are compelling for us because we have been culturally programmed to think in those terms.\n\nOn another level, apocalyptic movies speak to our own real experiences of existential catastrophe — the atom bomb, AI, genocide, environmental catastrophe, and viruses. But apocalyptic movies and writings are ultimately about knowledge and how to make sense of catastrophic events. They help us transcend the present moment to gain a larger perspective, which can help us identify and resist destructive forces. They give viewers the opportunity to clarify their own values and moral compass.\n\nThey also explore something very important to Americans — our sense of personal agency. We want to know if our actions can make a difference in a situation that is beyond our control. Most apocalyptic movies are trying to move us from catastrophe to hope.\n\nQ: Which is your favorite apocalyptic movie — and why?\n\nA: For quite some time, “The Hunger Games” books and movies have been personal favorites. Young adult stories are some of the most compelling stories right now because the teenage characters are wrestling with big moral questions, but feel out- matched by the world. Katniss is complex and relatable — she’s both fierce and broken. I also love the Appalachian setting of the stories. The odds may not be in our favor, but never underestimate District 12!\n\nAnother favorite is “Children of Men” (2006). The storyline fuses together many biblical themes in new and interesting ways. It gives us a haunting dystopian landscape, but shows us that the main character is capable of far better actions than he thought possible.\n\nOne final favorite is “Edge of Tomorrow” (2014), based on the novel by Hiroshi Sakurazaka. What I find intriguing about this story is the time-loop motif in which the main characters live the same day over and over and learn how to handle life and death better each time. When Sakurazaka was writing the novel, he was influenced by the way in which video game characters die and then “respawn.” The respawning in the story gives the characters multiple chances to save the world, but it can also lead to despair.\n\nQ: What’s on your Netflix watch list right now?"
