        "text": "For many sales professionals, each year is a gamble. While we can't change the state of the economy or move markets, we can change ourselves.\n\nThat's why we've created this list of the best sales movies to watch if you need a little booster or at least take the edge off things for a few moments.\n\nWithout further adieu, here are some movies for salespeople where you could almost justify the movie tickets as a company expense.\n\n1 Jerry Maguire\n\nYou all know it and love it. \"Show me the moneeyyyyyy!\"\n\nThis movie is about belief. When it comes to sales, your personal life will have many ups and downs that will affect your sales quota.\n\nHowever, it changes the entire sales game when someone believes in you (we're looking at you, Cuba Gooding, Jr.). With belief comes confidence. With confidence comes determination. And with determination, you can do anything.\n\n2 Wolf of Wall Street\n\nMartin Scorsese directs the story of New York stockbroker Jordan Belfort, who, in the late 1980s, went from penny stocks and righteousness to IPOs and a life of corruption.\n\nThere are some core sales concepts to glean from this movie:\n\nEnlist proper, comprehensive training. By focusing on sales training and effective sales coaching, Jordan helped his team (of nonsales people) crush their sales goals by role-playing on live customer calls with effective cold call scripts and elevator pitches to use.\n\nDemonstrate value. Show your prospect how your product or service aligns with their needs. To do that, you must know and understand your customer - (your ideal customer profile helps here).\n\nCreate a sense of urgency. Take it from Jordan selling penny stocks; heâd constantly stress the sense of urgency. Heâd say, âThis is the last one left,â and âI have another buyer waiting!â\n\nClick here to watch our favorite scene from the movie.\n\n3 Moneyball\n\nOne day, Billy Beane, general manager of the Oakland A's, has an epiphany: baseball's conventional wisdom is all wrong. With a tight budget, Beane must reinvent his team by outsmarting the richer ball clubs.\n\nSo, what's the Moneyball strategy? Our take on it is to leverage the power of data. Much like major league baseball, businesses should use data to make decisions about sales forecasting and pipeline management.\n\nSecondly, find new ways to solve old problems. Encourage your team to bring new perspectives into the sales process, and youâll see challenges in a new way.\n\nThis famous quote from the movie, âYouâre not solving the problem. Youâre not even looking at the problem!â should drive all sales decisions because you can't do anything about it until you figure out whatâs wrong.\n\nClick here to watch our favorite scene from the movie.\n\n4 The Pursuit of Happyness\n\nChris Gardner is a bright and talented salesman but marginally employed. Struggling to make ends meet, he and his five-year-old son are evicted from their San Francisco apartment and have nowhere to go.\n\nWhen Gardner lands an internship at a prestigious stock brokerage firm, he and his son endure many hardships, including living in shelters, in pursuit of his dream of a better life for the two of them.\n\nThe key takeaways from this film are:\n\nAttitude is everything. Use resiliency as a sales superpower.\n\nDare to be different with your sales approach.\n\nQuality over quantity when it comes to building a sales foundation.\n\nClick here to watch our favorite scene from the movie.\n\n5 Joy\n\nLoosely based on the life of inventor and entrepreneur Joy Mangano, this moving film shows what it's like to push back against all odds and succeed through persistence and creativity.\n\nJoy is a self-made millionaire who created her business empire. Some sales concepts to take away from this film are:\n\nMake your sales connections count. Rely on your support system if needed.\n\nPerseverance is key, especially for women in business.\n\nSales success isn't achieved singularly; it takes a village, as they say.\n\n6 Rogue Trader\n\nBased on a true story, this drama follows a young British man working at Barings, a central investment bank. Sent to Singapore and placed in a position of authority at the bank's branch there, he takes advantage of the thriving Asian market to make risky trades.\n\nBefore long, he's in over his head and tries to hide the losses. If you ever wonder how some people seem to be able to handle high stakes so self-assured and confidently, watch this...\n\nThe Leeson lesson? Leesonâs story is an excellent lesson in risk management and financial oversight.\n\nClick here to watch our favorite scene from the movie.\n\n7 Love and Other Drugs\n\nLove and Other Drugs is an unconventional love story that focuses on the life of a pharmaceutical salesman and shines a fascinating spotlight on the world of medical sales. We follow a charming salesman who rises to be one of the top reps at Pfizer (who doesn't want to be included in this film).\n\nThe moral of the story is: don't risk love for success. The goal is to balance the two. Don't work too hard that your relationships suffer. Work hard to make your relationships last.\n\n8 Glengarry Glen Ross\n\nWhen an office full of New York City real estate salesmen is told that all but the top two will be fired at the end of the week, the atmosphere begins to heat up. Shelley Levene, who has a sick daughter, does everything he can to get better leads from his boss, John Williamson, but to no avail.\n\nWhen his coworker Dave Moss comes up with a plan to steal the leads, things get complicated for the tough-talking salesmen. You'll be glad to not work in that office.\n\nSo, what are the sales lessons to learn here?\n\nAlways Be Closing (ABC) is still a valuable sales mindset. Itâs all the little steps that lead up to closing a deal.\n\nTalk less and listen more. Let the buyer talk, and give them clear and concise answers.\n\nRemember why you do your job. That âwhyâ can be your motivator when times get rough.\n\nAnd, most importantly, when times are tough, keep going.\n\nClick here to watch our favorite scene from the movie.\n\n9 Tommy Boy\n\nAfter his beloved father dies, dimwitted Tommy Callahan inherits a near-bankrupt automobile parts factory in Sandusky, Ohio. Tommy strives to make one last-ditch effort to find someone to buy their products. With his father's tightly wound assistant in tow, Tommy hits the road to scare up some new clients.\n\nHere's what you can learn from Tommy:\n\nYou must get inside your customer's heads to succeed in sales today.\n\nUse various innovative methods to do this, like predictive analytics and social selling.\n\nTake the time to \"relate\" to your customer. (Queue the beloved quote, \"Let me tell you why I suck at sales.\"\n\nClick here to watch our favorite scene from the movie.\n\n10 Boiler Room\n\nWelcome to the infamous \"boiler room,\" where twenty-something millionaires are made overnight.\n\nHere, in the inner sanctum of a fly-by-night brokerage firm, hyper-aggressive young stock jocks peddle to unsuspecting buyers over the phoneâand are rewarded with mansions, Ferraris, and more luxury toys than they know what to do with. In this unassuming Long Island enclave, Gen Xers chase the green at breakneck speeds, sometimes one step ahead of the law.\n\nSales gems to take away from Boiler Room:\n\nPhone sales are a high-stakes, high-rewards skill that should be practiced around experts in your field.\n\nDon't waste time with people who canât or wonât make a decision.\n\nAsk for the sale at the right time.\n\n11 Thank You For Smoking\n\nNick Naylor, a lobbyist for Big Tobacco, finds it challenging to balance his duties defending the dangerous substance with those of being a good role model for his young son. Nick's life gets even more complicated when a liberal senator mounts an anti-smoking campaign that he must counter.\n\nNick teaches us these imperative sales lessons:\n\nYou donât have to believe in the cause you represent.\n\nSelling with logic over emotion is the way to go.\n\nCreate and use value for both sides of the sale to provide transparency to the customer.\n\nClick here to watch the official trailer\n\n12 Used Cars\n\nThis 1980's movie comes with all the ridiculousness you'd expect from a black comedy about a used car sales lot starring Kurt Russel.\n\nThis movie's executive producer is no other than Steven Spielbergâalthough that's not apparent when watching this movie. When you consider that this entire sales movie was shot in just 29 days, it all makes more sense. If comic relief is what you're going after, and you've already exhausted our best sales memes, this is worth a watch.\n\nClick here to watch the official trailer\n\n13 Catch Me If You Can\n\nWhile not technically a sales movie, the true story of legendary conman Frank Abagnale Jr. can teach incredible lessons about confidence, dressing the part, and ultimately closing the deal.\n\nThe ultimate lesson is to dress the role if you want the part.\n\n14 Tin Men\n\nDoor-to-door aluminum-siding salesmen Bill \"B.B.\" Babowsky and Ernest Tilley are professional rivals in an industry known for shady dealings and high-pressure sales. However, their rivalry goes from professional to personal after a minor car accident, and neither is willing to take the blame.\n\nThis movie addresses corrupt sales practices and how they infiltrated teams and relationships - and at the end of it all, you can drive off into uncertainty (and it's okay).\n\nClick here to watch our favorite scene from the movie.\n\n15 The Founder\n\nBased on the true story of Ray Kroc, this movie details how a master salesman turned an innovative eatery into one of the most famous fast-food restaurant chains in the world through persistence.\n\n16 The Big Kahuna\n\nThree salesmen for a foundering industrial lubricant manufacturer hang out in their company's hospitality suite at a major convention, waiting for a prospective customer they've privately dubbed \"The Big Kahuna,\" whose potential sales would turn the struggling company around.\n\nPhil plays peacemaker between the cynical, argumentative huckster, Larry, and Bob, the company's newest hire, whose religious sanctimony irritates Larry.\n\nClick here to watch our favorite scene from the movie.\n\n17 Salesman\n\nThis sales documentary from Albert and David Maysles follows the bitter rivalry of four door-to-door salesmen working for the Mid-American Bible Company: Paul \"The Badger\" Brennan, Charles \"The Gipper\" McDevitt, James \"The Rabbit\" Baker, and Raymond \"The Bull\" Martos.\n\nThis movie highlights the strive for door-to-door sales gusto and how it takes determination and grit to survive the sale.\n\n18 The Goods\n\nDon Ready is many things, but he is best known as an extraordinary salesman. When a car dealership in Temecula teeters on the brink of bankruptcy, he and his ragtag team dive in to save the day. But what Ready doesn't count on is falling in love and finding his soul.\n\nThe Goods motto: schmoozing isn't dead. You have to perfect it.\n\nClick here to watch our favorite scene from the movie.\n\n19 Cadillac Man\n\nCar dealer Joey O'Brien is spread as thin financially as he is in his love life. He's dating more women than he can remember, and the local toughs he's borrowed money from want it back.\n\nIn a last-ditch effort to get out of debt, Joey struggles to sell a dozen cars in two daysâa task that becomes difficult when the husband of Joey's secretary barges into the dealership with a semi-automatic weapon and takes everyone hostage.\n\nWhat is the moral of the Cadillac Man story? A sense of urgency works for sales.\n\n20 Two For The Money\n\nMatthew McConaughey and Al Pacino star in this gambling madness of a movie.\n\nAfter suffering a career-ending injury, Brandon Lang, a former college football star, finds himself connected with one of the most renowned names in the sports gambling business.\n\nAl Pacino teaches us a lot about sales here. Lang's in-depth knowledge of the game, leagues, and players brings in big winnings and bigger clients.\n\nThe bottom line for sales (even though gambling is frowned upon): have an in-depth knowledge of your product or service.\n\nClick here to watch our favorite scene from the movie.\n\n21 Trading Places\n\nStarring Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd, this film sees the lives of two strangers swapped - rags to riches style. It shows how street smarts and a natural gift for reading people can lead to success in sales.\n\nSales is about connecting with people. Eddie and Dan explain how they used their ability to adapt to navigate the entire \"scam\" from start to finish.\n\n22 The Story of Sales\n\nThe Story of Sales is a documentary that, in eight chapters, explores the role this profession has played from a historical and societal point of view. Salesforce funded this movie, which was released in 2018.\n\nThis movie highlights the real heroes: salespeople.
