        "text": "Most of us know at least someone who can’t get through a day without quoting from Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, Casablanca, Dracula, or some other compulsively worshipped movie. Other people tire of hearing them intone, “Eeelectricity!” or “Round up the usual suspects,” or “I never drink… wine,” but they perseverate and we screen them out. At what point, however, does this kind of behavior cease to seem quaintly quasipathological and begin to call to us as a significant spectacle? Is it a matter of the ferocity of their ardor? Or their numbers? Would 1,000 people attending a Star Trek convention wearing Mr. Spock ears in San Diego make us sit up and take more notice than if two showed up at a Starbucks in Paramus speaking Vulcan? We finally decided that the only way to seriously examine these and other pressing questions was to publish a special section on Cult Film.\n\nWhat initially drew our attention was that not only did cult film turn up in our conversations with great frequency, it also arrived in numerous guises. Cult as shock and schlock; cult as nostalgia; cult as marginality; cult as intensity and passion; cult as marketing hype; cult as fad and fashion; cult as subversion; cult as historical era marker. Too many things to too many people, cult film seemed to us to be stretching so thinly before our eyes as to potentially lose its meaning in a dizzying vortex. It seemed an untenable situation ripe for critical investigation.\n\nCult film has actually been a subject of intermittent, serious study for almost thirty years, and the object of “gee-whiz,” hyperemotional expostulations for longer than that. But Cineaste is also aware that the past ten years has seen a surge of scrutiny of the cult film phenomenon by well-informed scholars, journalists, and critics armed with something more than the pleasure, curiosity, and wonder of the initial wave of critics. This “New Wave” of cult criticism, so to speak, carries with it the intention of winnowing the wheat of rigorous understanding from the chaff of spurious and digressive chatter.\n\nWe approached a number of leading scholars, journalists, and critics—authors of classics in the field, editors of journals devoted to cult film, and new scholars of the subject—and invited them to contribute to our Critical Symposium. In the following pages, and continuing on our web site, we offer a wide range of critical interpretations and strategies—emanating from the United States, England, and Australia—that we believe will contribute to a new clarity about cult film, but leave abundant breathing room for the stimulating clash of differing considered opinions.\n\nOur contributors differ in emphasis, which has created a trio of interrogational repertoires. Their three major focus points can be itemized as: the cult fan; the cult object; and the relationship between the cult film and the marketplace. Viewing the phenomenon of cult film through the lens of the fan elicits questions about what distinguishes cult interest from the more general category of cinephilia; differences between the opportunities for cult fans now and cult fans back in the day of pre-home- viewing technologies; and the motives and cultural roles of the cult fan.\n\nViewing the cult film in terms of its definition as an object, our contributors have confronted questions about cult esthetics: whether they are distinctly different from the esthetics of mainstream film; the independence of cult creators; whether there is a distinctive cult esthetic; whether the cult film (or only some cult films) is marked by a defamiliarized attitude toward the body, gender, society, the family, and human identity.\n\nFinally, where our contributors set their sights on the commodification of cult film, they ran up against the overwhelming question of whether cult film is possible any longer, given a marketplace that omnivorously coopts whatever it catches in the cross hairs of its profit motive in order to produce a standardized product. Under this heading, we find consideration of whether and how there can still be the kind of search for the unknown, obscure object of filmgoing desire that marked the cult adventure in the long- ago days of the midnight movie, screened in the kind of independently owned movie theatre that barely exists today.\n\nWe posed the following questions to our respondents, both for the print and online editions, suggesting that they could choose either to answer the individual questions, or to use them as departure points for their own essay.—The Editors\n\nWhat is your definition of cult film?\n\nWhat is the social function of cult film?\n\nIn his landmark book Cult Movies (1981), Danny Peary asserted that cult films are always marked by excess and controversy far beyond that usually permitted by Hollywood. He also noted the way they stimulate fan devotion of an extreme nature: characteristically an unlimited appetite for screenings of a favorite, and a determination to track it to wherever it is shown. How has the contrast between mainstream and cult film changed since the publication of Peary’s book?\n\nWhat do you find the most exciting and/or valuable esthetic features of cult films?\n\nHow has the change in venues where cult films are shown, from public theatres to individually owned electronic devices altered the production and experience of cult?\n\n****\n\nDAVID CHURCH\n\nA cult film has a select but eccentrically devoted audience who engage in repeated screenings, celebratory rituals, and/or ironic reading strategies (e.g., camp, excess, “paracinema”). Cult films are often strange, offbeat, or supposedly “transgressive” in content, in addition to sometimes being (intentionally or not) aberrant or challenging in form. In short, cult films are primarily perceived as “different” from “mainstream” films, and this sense of difference often reflects a resistance to mass-market consumerism, highfalutin artistic elitism, and political correctness. In looking at a given film, its receptional and textual attributes should both be taken into account, especially to question whether a film’s transgression of esthetic or social norms on a textual level is actually reinforced by its cult reception (and vice versa). As Chuck Kleinhans and Jacinda Read have argued, it is hazardous to celebrate, as some cultists do, the nebulous idea of “transgression” by ignoring or ironically rejecting other forms of political consciousness; for example, postclassical exploitation films like Cannibal Holocaust and Bloodsucking Freaks may violate the strictures of “good taste,” but do so through graphic portrayals of racism, misogyny, ableism, etc. Nevertheless, taking many different forms and functions, the myriad excesses of cult films (and their viewers) are what make them such a fascinating phenomenon.\n\nIn their capacity to foster a sense of community among viewers with nonnormative tastes, cult films are a cinematic outland frequently policed through subcultural negotiation, whether by cultists whose affiliations span many varieties of cult films or those engaged in a microculture surrounding a particular film. In addition to rewarding more “authentic” fans with greater subcultural status—especially those sandwiched uncomfortably between high and low socioeconomic strata—the bleeding over of cultish activity (e.g., quoting dialog, circulating trivia) from the viewing situation into everyday living can pleasurably color the cultist’s life as an esthetic experience. The twinges of anticipation in rewatching a movie that one has virtually memorized line-for-line; the base thrill of viewing bizarre or disreputable imagery; the pleasure of noticing tiny details that more casual viewers may not discern—these are all cultish delights that reveal the difficulty in separating the cult text from its reputation as less accessible to mainstream viewers. However, even if the cult ethos is resistant to both high and mass culture, Mark Jancovich has noted that (predominately middle-class) cultists often draw upon high cultural competences, such as ironic distance and knowledge of film form, to justify a class bias against supposedly lumpen “mainstream” audiences. While this sort of reverse elitism is certainly a pitfall for some cultists, the most valuable feature of cult films remains their ability to routinely blur the boundaries between art and trash, revealing the very constructedness of esthetic distinctions. Celebrating cult films can be a way of talking back to power by appropriating the tools of cultural refinement for one’s own purposes (provided one doesn’t inadvertently replicate dominant cultural biases in doing so).\n\nDespite cultists’ perception that their object choices are less accessible to mass-market audiences, the term “cult” seems to have become more culturally diffuse over the past two decades, earning not only a place as a popular marketing term, but also blurring with “mainstream” entertainment (as with Hollywood’s “cult blockbusters,” such as the Lord of the Rings and Star Wars series). As Barbara Klinger has observed, the gradual transition from public, social rituals at repertory theatre screenings to private, individualistic collectorship in the home viewing environment has popularized cultish activity (e.g., repeated screenings, recited dialog, and other viewing rituals) beyond marginal subcultures, allowing it to become connected to countless types of films. (Without the tangibility of public interaction, just how many strange devotees of a given film constitute a new cult audience, anyway?) Consequently, some viewers may be less likely to self-identify as cultists, while others may react by embracing cultism with increased fervor; the latter impulse may be in turn feeding back into the production process, as with the recent spate of films marketed to capitalize on “grindhouse chic,” turning—whether ironically or self-seriously—toward the laddish appeal of 1970s exploitation cinema. Meanwhile, camp’s subversive edge has been blunted by its proliferation in straight culture, sadly dissipating some of the queer charge that was once common in cult film viewing.\n\nIn the age of viral videos, “cult” seems to be everywhere, spurring self-identified cultists into renewed subcultural jousting for authenticity. Many films that were once available only through mail-order catalogs, fan conventions, and bootleg VHS trading are now readily available on DVD, leading cultists to seek out even more obscure rarities. In the past several years, online torrent sites have become some cultists’ preferred source for acquiring such rarities, continuing the circulation of cult objects while preserving the “outlaw” status that Joanne Hollows has cited as a considerable appeal of cult film collecting. As technologies have evolved and cult viewing has moved behind closed doors, fans have reconnected with each other in the quasipublic, virtual spaces created by web sites, blogs, and discussion fora—which arguably allow for more dialogic, communal interaction than the cult film fanzines and newsletters they have partially replaced. While cultish activity on the Internet has not necessarily been a reliable predictor of box-office success (see Grindhouse) or long-term cult investments (see the short-lived Snakes on a Plane fad), it has increasingly caught the attention of film industries eager to maximize profits by reappropriating fan tastes. Following Henry Jenkins, this development might suggest that the struggle is intensifying between media producers and the fans who actively rework material from those media to fit their own desires. It will be fascinating to see how cultists’ resistance to the mainstreaming of cult will continue to take new forms in the future, but in any case, the changing shape of cult cinema shows few signs of slowing.\n\nDavid Church is a Ph.D. student in Communication and Culture at Indiana University. He is currently editing Playing with Memories: Essays on Guy Maddin (University of Manitoba Press, forthcoming in 2009).\n\nMATT HILLS\n\nCult status is tied to the social situation of film reception, and this implies fans. For example, fifty years ago, Marx brothers films could be considered cult films since screenings brought out dedicated enthusiasts who often knew many of the lines, their favorite scenes and gags, etc. In the 1960s the Orson Welles Cinema in Cambridge, MA., ran a Humphrey Bogart film festival during the exam period every semester at Harvard. Freshmen were initiated into the ritual viewing, and, by the time they were juniors, could call out their favorite lines, anticipate every plot point, etc.\n\nPeary’s book Cult Movies arrived in 1981 at the cusp of the change from theatrical to home (VCR) viewing. The films he identified as “cult” were all ones that had to be viewed in the social situation of theatrical film, including repertory houses, midnight screenings, and campus film clubs. One exception: broadcast TV contributed to cult fandom with late-night-hosted horror films with hosts like Elvira, or by showing sure-fire hits during ratings week such as Casablanca—widely known as an audience grabber every time. In prevideotape days the group experience was essential to the cult experience. The supreme example was The Rocky Horror Picture Show, which became a weekly repeat experience for a young audience that came in costume, sang the songs, and acted out in the theater. Today, different and multiple distribution streams allow for many more films to exist, and private and small group viewing allows for a different sense of “cult” status.\n\nThere are still festivals and special occasions for theatrical cult such as theme and event weekends, but the vast expansion of opportunities to view—and importantly review—films on tape and DVD have changed the game. Cult films are films that are loved, adored, valued by a self-selecting group of cinephiles. If only one person appreciates a film, we have idiosyncratic fetishism, perhaps rising at most to the level of a “guilty pleasure.” True cult status has to have a group, however small, which validates a work as art, or expression, or statement. Of course some films collect dedicated subculture viewers such as the gay male fandom for Judy Garland films. And some films expand into multiple forms including (profitable) serialization, spinoffs, costumes, and conventions: Star Wars is the supreme example.\n\nFor the individual viewer, the cult film provides the singular pleasure of adoration. Thus one common definition of cult films addresses this affection, but the social dimension of cult experience also provides an “insider” status. In general, cult films stand outside the canon of widely accepted works. But, they can become canonical over time. Thus at one time Hitchcock was generally thought of as a talented technician, but no artist, but auteur critics elevated him to canonical status. The French adored Jerry Lewis, who became a French cult figure.\n\nSome cultists want everyone to share their enthusiasm. But some other cultists, particularly of “low” films, revel in their outsider taste and position. They want to validate their cult works, but they also want to keep those films from gaining a wider audience that would dilute their taste culture. Thus, the social function of cult films is to allow what sociologist Pierre Bourdieu called “distinction”—esthetic discrimination that serves to validate the person making the valuation. Everyone uses esthetic discrimination. Depending on where one is socially, in terms of both class and education, you can validate high-culture art-house films (say the cult of Haneke) or low-culture trash-culture films (say the fans of Troma), and you accumulate some “cultural capital” for your reward.\n\nThere’s genuine intellectual work in becoming knowledgeable about some small, specialized area, and thus cult fans also share characteristics of collectors of all kinds such as a ritualized devotion to something the general culture passes over. The fan publications and web sites, and the dedicated retailers and small, hip video/DVD stores are necessary parts of the social mix today. It’s also key to know that the existence of cults functions to promote connoisseurship. Just as wine lovers spend an inordinate energy on discriminating among wines (and find it fun and gratifying to do so), film cultists can endlessly discuss their beloved objects, be they Italian Giallo horror, beach party movies, Satantango, grindhouse films, early Jackie Chan, J-Horror, etc.\n\nOf course the cultists take great pleasure in their virtually unique taste, but delight in finding a cadre of others, and truly triumph when they can parade that special status among those who are unwashed and unlearned, but eager to be initiated (the Harvard freshmen). Finding others who share your insider love of The Big Lebowski, say, makes you feel good to share your specialized knowledge with others who understand you, whose existence complements your taste, and are not bored with or tired of your passion. This is even more so when cult knowledge can be used to appall uptight elitists (which works especially well in university humanities departments, which are filled with anal-retentive esthetic and/or political conservatives). All of this is present in the Film Quarterly symposium back in 2003 validating Showgirls.\n\nRecent cult film culture shows a marked tendency to validate the outsider status of the works as somehow transgressive or subversive of oppressive norms, the dominant ideology, or the existing power structure. This claim is often made but seldom examined in depth. And since much (though not all) cult film fandom falls into the demographics of white-boy culture, feminists have been justifiably skeptical of its gender politics. An interesting mark of critical change and development in this area is Stephane Dunn’s recent book, Baad Bitches” & Sassy Supermamas: Black Power Action Films. She works through the racial and gender politics of Blaxploitation-era cult films such as Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song, Coffy, and Foxy Brown. Dunn develops a sophisticated analysis that could serve as a model for many other cult films.\n\nChuck Kleinhans coedits JUMP CUT: A Review Of Contemporary Media (www.ejumpcut.org) and teaches in the Radio/TV/Film department at Northwestern University.

KOVEN\n\nThe cult film is a film that occupies an asymptotic relationship with mainstream film by virtue of identifiable textual divergences. Always in dialog with conventional mainstream cinema, the cult film, through unconventional textual elements including plot, dialog, cinematography, editing, and special effects, presents itself on the surface as mainstream’s foil. However, all pretense (and pretentiousness) aside, it is mainstream cinema with a twist (or several twists) rather than a wholly separate animal.\n\nThis is to suggest that, contra Bruce Kawin, it is not primarily the audience that defines a cult film. While obviously an audience is required for a film to become a cult film, I argue that there is something intrinsic to the “cinematic substrate” itself, some recognizably transgressive element of the film’s esthetics or thematics ranging from obvious bad taste to self-conscious artiness, that marks it as ripe for cultdom. This goes beyond Umberto Eco’s speculation that cult movies must display “organic imperfections,” because all movies display organic imperfections and may be “unhinged” (4)—and this is precisely what cult films make evident.\n\nTo adapt Timothy Corrigan’s language from A Cinema Without Walls, the cult film is not completely foreign but neither can it be easily domesticated. Or shifting J. P. Telotte’s language slightly, what cultists embrace is an uncomfortable difference that is transformed with some effort into a comfortable one. What defines the cult film therefore is the challenge it presents to spectators. By virtue of its unconventional textual elements, it forces viewers to reconcile their assumptions and expectations about film in general with the cult film’s obvious differences.\n\nThose willing to perform this work reap the rewards of their efforts—the smugness of presumed elite or outsider status. The appreciative spectator of the art-house film has her intellectual credentials validated, the slasher film fan has his intestinal fortitude verified—and each can then look down his or her nose at the assumed banality of mainstream cinema and its vanilla patrons.\n\nTo the extent that the cult film makes a spectacle of itself through its self-conscious foregrounding of its differences from mainstream film, cult films are always metafilms, films that foreground the conventions of and expectations surrounding mainstream cinema. By virtue of “pushing the boundaries,” they highlight the existence of those boundaries that circumscribe conventional cinema.\n\nThis ideally is the primary social value of cult films. Poised on the edge of what should and should not be said and shown, they raise interesting and important questions about the naturalization of particular types of narratives and how narrative functions to naturalize particular ideological worldviews. The cult film ideally asks us to think about the types of stories we consume, why we enjoy them, and how we respond to those stories.\n\nThis self-reflexive interrogation of cinema provoked by cult films possesses revolutionary potential. In practice, however, what has increasingly occurred is the hegemonic incorporation of resistance by the major Hollywood studios. The asymptotic distance between mainstream and cult has been increasingly diminishing as mainstream studios seek to commodify and sell us our revolution by coopting unconventional esthetics and transgressive thematics. Thus, the innovative camcorder esthetic of 1999’s The Blair Witch Project has been appropriated by films such as Cloverfield (2008), Universal Studies distributed the 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead, gay cowboys became cause célèbres in 2005’s Brokeback Mountain, MGM released the home-video version of the decidedly quirky and ready-made-for-cultdom film Bubba Ho-Tep (2002), etc. Simply put, in the attempt to control the cinematic marketplace and capitalize on the overdetermined desire of cinematic spectators for something different, Hollywood has gotten weirder—witness 2001’s Donnie Darko, distributed in home video by Fox, as a case in point. It is clearly no longer the case (if it ever was) that cult films simply “happen or become” rather than being made (Austin 44).\n\nWhat has offset the hegemonic maneuvers of the major Hollywood studios are emerging technologies that facilitate the production, distribution, and promotion of small, offbeat, and strange films. With a camera, a computer, and a Web connection, anyone can make and upload a film of virtually any length to a personal Web site or a searchable public domain such as YouTube. And major video rental services like Netflix offer sophisticated online controls that recommend films to subscribers based on the subscriber’s rental pattern and “ratings” of previously rented films—which allows subscribers to “stumble” across films that they might otherwise have missed.\n\nThis shift from viewing in the theater to viewing at home, however, has significant ramifications for cult viewership. Here I am thinking not so much of the loss of the mythical shared communitas that allegedly comes into being among a community of admirers during the social experience of the public showing—which I think can to a certain extent be replaced by the online communitas of chat rooms and Facebook sites—as the surrendering of possibilities for alternative spectator practices. It’s hard to imagine, for example, the Rocky Horror cult developing the way it did—with its communal shout-outs and secondary audience script and dancing in the aisles—in the absence of communal showings at the Waverly Theater. While it is true that the material conditions of home viewership tend to counter the tendency toward absorption in cinematic narratives of all stripes (the phone rings, we pause the film to get up, someone else interrupts our viewing, we find ourselves getting sleepy and stop the film, etc.)—and, indeed, home consumption of the cult film or cult film-in-embryo may allow for the proliferation of interpretations in the absence of the disciplining presence of other cultists—what is diminished I think are possibilities for what I will call “engaged spectatorship,” a kind of creative and communal participation in the life-world of the film. It may be that this desire is increasingly being satisfied by communal online games such as World of Warcraft.\n\nJeffrey Andrew Weinstock is associate professor of American literature and culture at Central Michigan University.
