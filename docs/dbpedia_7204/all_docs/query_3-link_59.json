Her academic resume includes a Masters of Theological Studies from Covenant Seminary, and she recently completed her doctoral studies at Denver Seminary and is now working on her thesis.\n\nShe’s been featured on numerous television and radio programs and is a regular on TBN’s globally syndicated Better Together show. As well as host of “Lisa Harper’s Back Porch Theology” podcast on AccessMore. She’s spoken at hundreds of national and international women’s events, as well as in churches around the world. She’s also invested locally and has been leading the same weekly neighborhood Bible study for 15 years. And if you can’t find her teaching, studying, hiking, or practicing wave-riding skills, she’s probably in a coffee shop sipping a mocha and typing away on her computer because she’s also had 16 books published – including the recent best-selling devotional, Jesus, and has written and filmed 8 well-received Bible study video curriculums, including Job:A Story of Unlikely Joy and How Much More: Discovering God’s Extravagant Love in Unexpected Places.\n\nRead Bio\n\nIn 2013, combined with 14 years of church-based ministry and leadership experience and their family’s foster and adoptive journey, Jason began working for an organization helping church leaders implement structures and strategies of ministry within their churches and developing resources to encourage and support foster and adoptive parents along their journeys. This ultimately led to his current role as the Director of Church Mobilization and Engagement with CAFO. In his work he speaks and teaches at churches, conferences, forums and workshops on church and nonprofit ministry strategies and best practices as well as encouraging families that are in the trenches and those that are considering getting involved.\n\nMuch of his time is also spent coaching and consulting with church and organizational leadership teams around the country on how to start, lead and grow ministries within their church or build the most effective church engagement strategies within their organizations.\n\nJason is the author of ReFraming Foster Care (for families and support groups), Everyone Can Do Something (for church and ministry leaders), The ALL IN Curriculum (small group based study for those considering), Effectively Engaging Churches (for organizational leaders and advocates) and blogs regularly at Jason Johnson | Blog.\n\nRead Bio\n\nBill Lee is a seventh-generation Tennessean and the 50th Governor of Tennessee.

As he wrestled with the broken pieces of his past, he encountered the transformational love of Jesus and the opportunity for healing and restoration through the gospel. The past 12 years he has given his life to full time ministry, using his testimony to inspire his artistry, writing and public speaking opportunities. After years of pastoral ministry, Austin is now a self-produced artist living in Atlanta with his wife of four years. He also serves on staff with the WinShape Foundation.

He relishes wrestling matches with his five children—Siena, Marin, Eden, Lincoln, and Phoebe. Most of all, he desires to reflect the heart of Jesus Christ in all of life.\n\nJedd believes that love for orphans transforms. Both personally and through the example of countless others, he’s seen that lives are turned upside-down when Christians reflect God’s heart for orphans through adoption, foster care and global orphan care. This kind of love transforms not only orphans, but also those who open hearts and homes to them. Churches can be transformed as well, moving the entire community beyond self-focused religion to self-giving faith. Finally, when a watching world sees the Gospel embodied in this way, onlookers are transformed as well. Desiring to spur this kind of transformation through the Church, Jedd serves as President of the Christian Alliance for Orphans.\n\nPrior to his this role, Jedd served in the White House as a Special Assistant to President George W. Bush, leading the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives. In this post, he oversaw reform efforts across the government to make community- and faith-based groups central partners in all Federal efforts to aid the needy, from prisoner reentry to global AIDS. As described by the Harvard Political Review, these reforms “fundamentally changed the government’s strategy for improving the lives of the downtrodden…”\n\nPreviously, Jedd held a range of posts in the California State Legislature. He also helped establish the California Community Renewal Project, which strengthens nonprofits in some of the state’s most challenged communities. He has worked, studied and served in more than thirty countries, with organizations ranging from Price-Waterhouse in Moscow to Christian Life Bangladesh.\n\nJedd has written many articles and four books, including Upended and Four Souls. His most recent book, Becoming Home, offers a short yet meaningful exploration of how families and communities can embrace vulnerable children with wisdom and love through adoption, foster care, mentoring and more. Jedd is frequently interviewed for insight on effective care for vulnerable children, as well as other national and global issues, in outlets ranging from Christianity Today and The Gospel Coalition to the Wall Street Journal, NPR and Al Jazeera.\n\nJedd Medefind and his wife, Rachel, live near Washington, DC. They’ve welcomed children through birth, foster care and adoption.\n\nRead Bio\n\nBorn in the Democratic Republic of Congo and adopted by European missionary parents, Zawadi was raised internationally, living in both Africa and Europe before his family settled in the United States. He is a multi-instrumentalist and holds a Bachelor of Music degree as well as a Master of Arts in Worship Studies.\n\nHe and his family recently moved to the Midwest after calling the Pacific Northwest home for the past 10 years. He currently serves as the Worship Arts Director at Calvary Holland, living out his calling of leading God’s people in meaningful worship, building relationships and caring for others.\n\nWhen he’s not at his home church leading worship each week, or spending time with his family, you can sometimes find him on tour with bands and artists like Kings Kaleidoscope, Andy Mineo, Switchfoot, and SYML.\n\nRead Bio\n\nFor more than 20 years Bishop W. C. Martin has served the community of Possum Trot, Texas, as pastor of Bennett Chapel.

For nearly 15 years, more than 2,700 children received care at multiple Show Hope-supported Care Centers in China, and today, more than 100 families have been recipients of a Show Hope Medical Care grant, with its aim to financially assist families with medical expenses for their children welcomed home through adoption.

He understands that deep, authentic relationships are essential to experiencing a healthier, more purposeful life — but the only way to realize this is to begin telling our stories more truly.\n\nCurt’s unique insights about how the brain affects and processes relationships help people discover a fresh perspective and practical applications to foster healthy and vibrant lives, allowing them to get unstuck and move toward the next beautiful thing they’re being called to make.\n\nThrough his workshops, speaking engagements, books, organizational consulting, private clinical practice and other platforms, he helps people process their longings, grief, identity, purpose, perspective of God and perspective of humanity, inviting them to engage more authentically with their own stories and their relationships.

He was calling them to “leave their logos and egos at the door” to join in unified efforts.\n\nCAFO2024 in Nashville marks our 20th year of Summit...and we can't wait to celebrate with all of you! Whether you come on your own or with a team, you will leave feeling inspired and equipped to serve wisely and well for vulnerable children and families.\n\nPlay Video\n\nPlay Video\n\nPlay Video\n\nPlay Video\n\nPlay Video\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nWe know there’s a lot going on at the CAFO Summit and want to answer some common questions.\n\nThank you to our CAFO2024 Summit Host Church: Brentwood Baptist Church, TN!\n\nThey are located at 7777 Concord Rd. Brentwood, TN 37027\n\nIf you have a heart/calling towards vulnerable children and families, CAFO2024 is for you! Workshops will include themes specifically designed for pastors, church lay leaders, non-profit staff and leadership, adoptive/foster parents, child welfare professionals, and individuals.\n\nWondering if you should come alone or with others? Many prefer to have more than one person attend the CAFO Summit. Multiple attendees can take home a fuller range of information with the broad range of concurrent workshops. Many ministries use conference networking and meal breaks to begin shaping a plan and ideas for further ministry once they return home. In addition, two or more attendees often return home with a deepened relationship and vision that can form the foundation for future ministry.\n\nWe ask that children (excluding infants) under the age of 13 not attend unless with parental supervision. The program is not designed for young children. Mature youth with a heart and vision for ministry may register at the special student rate, email [email protected] to find out more. There will be no KIDS Summit this year.\n\nEditing your registration:\n\nWhen you registered, you received a confirmation email that links to an “edit your registration” option. Additionally, you can make updates by visiting here and following the instructions. If you have further registration questions or are having trouble editing your existing registration, please email [email protected].\n\nTransferring your registration to another attendee:\n\nWe’re sorry to hear you can't join us this year! You can certainly transfer your registration to someone else. Simply email [email protected] and a team member will follow up with you to transfer the registration. The new registrant will be sent a confirmation email with check-in instructions.\n\nCancellation:\n\nAttendee Cancellation Policy\n\nYou can register now with the peace of mind that if you need to cancel for any reason, a full refund will be available until August 1st. Refunds requested after August 1st or for non-attendance (for any reason) will not be refunded. However, you will be able to transfer your registration to another attendee if you wish.\n\nPlease keep in mind that canceling your registration does not automatically cancel your hotel and travel arrangements. Attendees are responsible for canceling their own hotel and travel reservations.\n\nForce Majeure\n\nAfter the cancellation cutoff date, payments made are not refundable for any reason, including, but not limited to, failure to use conference attendance credentials due to illness or due to any event beyond the reasonable control of the parties, such as an act of God, a health epidemic, natural disaster, travel-related problems, an act of terrorism, or other unforeseeable circumstances beyond the control of CAFO against which it would have been unreasonable for CAFO to take precautions and which CAFO could not have avoided even using its best efforts.\n\nYES! Every year a mighty team of volunteers provides hospitality, direction, and helping hands at the CAFO Summit. The volunteer’s service, heart, and smile shape the experience of the attendees. Whether you are the ideal people person, expert behind-the-scenes runner, food prep master, chief organizer, directions giver, or strong-box-lifter, there is a place for you! There is a job for every ability level and gifting. Will you join the team?\n\nWho can volunteer?\n\nVolunteer slots are filled by all ages, beginning with responsible older students to all seasons of adulthood. U.S.-based volunteers are not required to have attended a prior Summit. Global guests must have attended a prior Summit – please read here for more information.\n\nIf I’m a volunteer, do I have to pay to attend?\n\nNo! Registration is our gift to full-time volunteers. Each volunteer will be assigned to a particular volunteer team for the slots he/she is available (and according to his/her interest). We ask volunteers to be available to their team for any days they are on-site. While we consider volunteering an all-in experience, each role has multiple “free times” throughout the day where volunteers can join any Summit session.\n\nIf this sounds good to you, apply to volunteer here!\n\nYes!\n\nCAFO Membership: A discounted rate is available for any CAFO member or member applicant ($50 off). This discounted rate includes any individual, church, or organization that applies for membership. See more about membership here.\n\nGroups (10+): A discounted rate is available for groups of 10+ attending the Summit. Find Group Registration Info Here.\n\nYes! General Sessions and most instructional workshops are audio-recorded and available for purchase. (Member-only workshop recordings are not available.) General Sessions may also be available on video.\n\nPurchase audio downloads from CAFO2023 in the CAFO Store.\n\nAll General Sessions and Workshops are included with your registration. You do not need to worry about signing up for workshop sessions; you can attend whichever you’d like.\n\nAttending General Sessions Only\n\nDue to the format of the Summit sessions, we do not offer the option of attending only the General Sessions. However, you can visit the CAFO store after the Summit to purchase an audio recording of each General Session.\n\nBuilding your CAFO2024 Experience\n\nWhile you don’t have to sign up for workshops, we do offer a helpful tool you can utilize to build your experience ahead of time (we know the CAFO Summit is chock-full of good stuff!). This is purely optional and only to help you plan and maximize your time while with us. Your schedule will not be available on-site, so please print and bring it along with you. Build your experience coming soon!\n\nYes to all, for in-person attendance only.\n\nHague Sessions\n\nThe suggested Hague training hours are offered on an advisory basis. Please consult your agency to confirm that these sessions will fulfill your requirements. Completion certificates will be available for each of these sessions.\n\nContinuing Education Units\n\nThese CEUs are for social work professionals. Adoptive parents and professionals from other fields may elect to receive this certificate for independent submission to the appropriate boards and associations for credit. Only available for those attending in-person.\n\nAttendance Certificate\n\nYes. We can send you a certificate for CAFO Summit attendance.\n\nTo complete CEU surveys or request Hague/Attendance Certificates, please visit the CEU/Hague/Attendance Certificate page.\n\nGetting to Nashville\n\nPLAN YOUR TRIP\n\nSpecial discounts for flights, hotels and rental cars for CAFO2024 attendees.\n\nInterested in Sponsorship?\n\nWE'LL SEE YOU IN Nashville!\n\nYou don’t want to miss out on this opportunity to expand knowledge and gain new community and friendships to walk this road together."
