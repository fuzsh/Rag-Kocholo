        "text": "WHAT IS A CREATION ENTERTAINMENT CONVENTION?\n\nCreation shows are more than fan conventions, theyâre an engaging experience that allows you to enjoy your favorite TV show with fellow fans for a weekend of fun and entertainment.Â\n\nWHAT GOES ON AT A CREATION ENTERTAINMENT CONVENTION?\n\nDaytime programming: Daytime programming takes place in our Main Theatre and consists of Celebrity panels/Q&A sessions, trivia games, cosplay contest, auctions and more! A guaranteed seat in the theatre as well as all of the daytime programming (except the exclusive Gold panel) are included in your admission ticket. Gold, Silver, Copper and Preferred Single Day(s) are reserved seating. GA weekend and GA single day tickets are unreserved seating. Gold, Silver, Copper, Preferred, General Admission are all considered âadmission ticketâ categories and only one of these is needed per person. For more information on seating options, click here!\n\nPhoto ops: Get your photo taken by our professional photographer with our celebrities! One photo op ticket can be used by up to two fans. With two photo op tickets, up to four fans can be in the same photo op. Click here for more information on photo ops! NOTE: You must have a convention admission pass for the day of your photo op to redeem your photo op ticket.\n\nAutographs: Most of our actors in attendance will sign autographs.Â In the rare occasion that an actor in attendance will not be signing autographs, it will be noted on our website.Â Some of our actorsâ autographs are included in the Gold and Silver packages, so please make sure to read the âBenefitsâ of your Gold or Silver package to see whoâs included before buying your separate autograph ticket(s).Â Items that are deemed inappropriate by Creation will not be allowed at the autograph tables.Â Â You can bring an item from home or browse through our Vendors Room to find exclusive merchandise, photos of our actors and other memorabilia. We use Sharpie brand pens for our autograph sessions, so if you bring an item from home, make sure the Sharpie brand will work ahead of time or you can bring a pen from home. We cannot guarantee the Sharpie brand will work on non-Creation merchandise. For more information on autographing, click here. NOTE:Â You must have a convention admission pass for the day of your autograph to redeem your autograph ticket.\n\nMeet & greets: Meet & greets take place in a small room generally with 1-2 celebrities and usually around 30 minutes in length. Most of our meet & greets are done via dutch auction. For more meet & greet information, click here.\n\nEvening events: Evening programming can include a free karaoke party, concert or cabaret! Please check the event website(s) for more information.\n\nVendors Room: Offers merchandise and other products for sale. At our Official Conventions, exclusive merchandise is only available at our events and you canât get them anywhere else!\n\nPLEASE READ THE CONVENTION WEBSITE\n\nPlease read the convention website completely before ordering tickets. Be sure of which day a guest is doing photo ops/autographs before purchasing your admission tickets, as they are non-refundable/non-exchangeable and you must have an admission ticket for the day of your autograph or photo op.Â Days that guests are signing autographs and taking photo ops are listed next to their name in the Autographs and Photo Ops section of this website. In the event a celebrity cancels or switches days, we will notify you via our email list and the event website about what to do. To join our mailing list, click here!Â\n\nHOW TO ATTEND\n\nORDERING TICKETS ONLINE\n\nGo to www.creationent.com, click on the image of the specific show youâd like to attend. At the top of the page, towards the right, there is a drop down menu item marked \"ADMISSION\", click on it and you will see which admission brackets are currently available. PLEASE READ THE DROP DOWN MENU CAREFULLY. It is possible that not all admission passes are on sale yet.\n\nThere is aÂ non-refundable service (handling) feeÂ of :\n\nAny ticket priced $350.00 and under, we will charge the $10.50 fee per ticket.\n\nAny ticket priced over $350.00; we will charge a 3% fee.\n\nTICKETS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE\n\nWe recommend that you carefully review your order before checking out as tickets areÂ non-refundableÂ and non-exchangeable as stated on our website. If a guest cancels, or switches days, you will be notified through our eblast system with the instructions on what to do. This information will also be posted on our website. To sign up for our e-blasts, click here: https://www.creationent.com/email.htm.\n\nIf you choose to sell or give your ticket to someone else, just forward them the tickets. However, once you give the ticket to another person, they become the customer and have the right to reserve the same seat for next year if that type of ticket is applicable and if re-ups are done at that particular event. Tickets cannot be used twice. If there are duplicate tickets, we can only honor the first one scanned. If you miss a photo op or autograph, Creation Entertainment is not responsible for a refund.\n\nSTATE TAXES INCLUDED ON YOUR INVOICE:\n\nAs a result of the Supreme Court Ruling during 2018 affecting online sales taxesÂ (both state and local taxes),Â various states are requiring sales taxÂ (both state and local taxes)Â on ANY online sales; therefore, you may now start seeing a separate charge on your invoice for this sales tax. The prices at the conventions will be the same as those online.Â Visit the National Conference of State Legislatures website for more information.\n\nWHEN ARE THE TICKET BRACKETS PUT ON SALE?\n\nThereâs no set schedule for the release of tickets. If youâre on Creationâs email list -- www.creationent.com/email.htm -- we will, to the best of our ability, send out an announcement each time a new ticket bracket becomes available. Following us on Twitter, Instagram and joining our official groups on Facebook is recommended as well.\n\nWEEKEND ADMISSION PACKAGESÂ (GOLD, SILVER, COPPER OR GENERAL ADMISSION):\n\nIf you purchased a Weekend Package, those are yourÂ ADMISSIONÂ tickets for the entire convention. Your Weekend Admission Pass will allow you to use your Photo Op tickets on any day of the convention. You will not need to purchase any additional single day admission tickets.Â\n\nPREFERRED VS GENERAL ADMISSION SEAT\n\nPreferred Single Day: You choose your actual seat when you place your order and your seat is reserved for that dayâs Theatre programming. Preferred Single Day seating is located behind the Gold, Silver and Copper sections.\n\nGeneral Admission Single Day: This is an unreserved seat located behind the Gold, Silver, Copper and Preferred sections. This seating is not reserved and cannot be held if you leave and return during the day. However, we do not sell admission tickets unless there is a seat available, so you are guaranteed a seat in the Theatre (excluding the special Gold panel).\n\nWHEN IS THE ACTOR APPEARING ON STAGE/DOING PHOTO OPS/AUTOGRAPHS?\n\nThe day each actor is appearing on-stage is listed next to their photo in the Special Guests section on the website. The day they are doing their photo ops/autographs is listed under the Autographs and Photo Ops sections in the ticket section of the website.Â\n\nI AM MISSING ONE (OR MORE) OF MY TICKETS\n\nAll tickets ordered together should be in the same PDF file. Please scroll down to see if the other tickets are there.Â If you are still missing your ticket(s), please check your spam folder. If you are still having issues, please contact customer.service@creationent.com for assistance. Customer Service hours are Monday-Friday, 9am-4:30pm Pacific time. If you have an issue over the weekend while a convention is going on, please go the Convention Registration desk at the event for assistance. Emails sent to Customer Service over the weekend may not be received until the Monday following the event.\n\nTICKET DOESN'T HAVE MY NAME ON IT\n\nIf you give your printed ticket to another person, they become the customer. It does not matter whose name is on it.Â We can only honor the first ticket scanned, regardless of the name on the ticket.\n\nADVANCE ONLINE TICKET SALES ARE TURNED OFF A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE EVENT\n\nAny remaining available tickets will be sold on-site at the convention.\n\nCAN I BUY TICKETS AT THE DOOR?\n\nYes, unless either admission ticket/package, photo op or autograph is sold out. We cannot hold tickets, however, as tickets are subject to limited availability.\n\nÂ Â\n\nIf you wish to purchase anyÂ available full weekend passesÂ (Gold, Silver, Copper, General Admission Weekend), you may do so at Pre-Registration the evening before the event (please see the posted schedule on our website for the times).Â\n\nÂ\n\nPLEASE NOTE:Â If you wish to purchase photo ops/autographs/other paid daytime programming events, you must have an admission ticket that is valid for either the entire convention OR a SINGLE DAY PREFERRED or GENERAL ADMISSION ticket that is valid for the SAME DAY as your photo op/autograph/paid daytime programming event is happening. Most of our guests are not at our convention all days. Please make sure that you check to see what day the guest you would like to see is appearing. Each guestâs appearance day is listed in parentheses next to their photo on the conventions âGUESTâ page.\n\nPre-Registration, is only for full convention pass holders. Single Day/General Admission ticketholders must register (pick up your admission wristband) on the day their ticket is valid for.Â\n\nCAN ANYONE COME?\n\nEveryone is welcome, however, Creation reserves the right to refuse service to anyone. Please refer to our Minors section for more information on attending with children.\n\nWHEN ARE YOU COMING TO MY HOMETOWN?\n\nWhat we currently have listed on our website is what is locked in. Please join our mailing list www.creationent.com/email.htm to get the most up-to-date announcements for new shows, dates and locations.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG?\n\nIf youâre on-site and something happens, please bring any issue to our attention at the convention registration desk immediately. We canât do anything about it after the convention is over. Please check the rules page of your schedule to see who you should specifically ask for if something goes wrong. Weâre there to help you make your convention experience as smooth as possible. NOTE: Customer Service hours are Monday-Friday, 9:00am to 4:30pm Pacific time. If your issue happens over the weekend and there is an event going on, please speak to us on-site. Emails sent to Customer Service over the weekend may not be received until the following Monday.\n\nADMISSION FOR MINORS\n\nAGE LIMIT TO ATTEND THE SHOW\n\nThereâs no age limit to enter our event and watch the stage show, but please check the special event, VIP and meet & greet listings for age requirements. Many of our guests can be off color in their humor and language. It is up to the parents to determine if this is acceptable for their child to hear. It is also up to the parentsâ discretion whether or not they allow their children to attend alone. Creation cannot accept responsibility for any unaccompanied minor.\n\nCHILDRENS PRICES\n\n6 and under are free, but they do need to sit on your lap.Â Children aged 7 and up need to have an admission ticket.Â We don't have special children's prices.\n\nDO I NEED A TICKET TO ATTEND WITH MY CHILD?\n\nEveryone attending the convention needs an admission ticket. In order to sit together, you'd both have to have the same package or single-day ticket.\n\nQ&AâS\n\nQuestion & Answer sessions occur at every convention. If you are one of the lucky ones to ask a question, please keep in mind that you are representing the fandom and everyone in the audience, therefore, please make sure your questions allow for our mutual shared time with the celebrities to be enjoyable, interesting and entertaining for all (including the guest) and not personal or political in nature. Also remember that it is not permissible to: ask for hugs, ask for follows on social media, tell personal stories, tell the actor how much you love them (we all do, thatâs why weâre here!) or how much they have affected your life. Shouting from the audience or heckling may result in being asked to leave without refund.\n\nSome of our major celebrity Q&As are done by lottery system and names of winners are posted shortly before their panels begin.Â Please check the event schedule for Question Lottery listings.Â Â Panels without a lottery system will take questions on a first-come, first-served basis. Question lines will form on either side of the stage prior to each panel.Â Â\n\nPHOTO OPS\n\nWHAT EXACTLY AM I BUYING?\n\nA purchase of a celebrity PHOTO OP gives you ONE 8x10 glossy full color photo of yourself with the celebrity. Up to two fans can be in the photo on one ticket, with up to four fans in one photo (but youâll need to have two tickets for four people). No more than four people are allowed in one photo op. If you use two tickets to have up to four people in your photo op, it counts as ONE photo op and you will only get one print. NOTE: You must have a convention admission pass for the day of your photo op in order to redeem your photo op ticket.\n\nHOW LONG DO I HAVE WITH A CELEBRITY IN A PHOTO OP?\n\nA photo op is to have your photo taken with the celebrity and lasts mere seconds. It is not an opportunity to have a âconversationâ with the celebrity guest and giving the actors gifts, notes, cards, etcâ¦is not permitted. Our celebrities have a very busy day with their fans doing meet & greets, on-stage Q&A, and autographs, generally all in the same day. They may also need to catch a plane or make another engagement. Please respect your fellow patrons in helping the photo op sessions to move quickly and efficiently.\n\nDO I HAVE TO HAVE AN ADMISSION TICKET TO THE CONVENTION TO GET A PHOTO OP?\n\nYES. You must have an admission ticket for the day of your photo op in order to redeem your photo op ticket. Photo prints are usually ready within one or two hours of the session for pick-up.\n\nARE PHOTO OPS INCLUDED IN ANY ADMISSION TICKET PACKAGES?\n\nNO. ADMISSION TICKET PACKAGES DO NOT INCLUDE PHOTO OPSÂ -- these must be purchased separately in advance or at the convention (if not sold out). NOTE: You may buy Photo Op and Autograph tickets before buying an Admission ticket, but you need an Admission ticket in order to use the Photo Op and Autograph tickets. Please buy an Admission ticket as soon as you can as we can never guarantee Admission tickets won't sell out before the show. If you do not have an admission ticket for the day of your autograph or photo op, you will not be allowed to redeem your autograph or photo op ticket and you will not receive a refund. Join our free email list to get updates on ticket availability.\n\nHOW ARE PHOTO OPS DONE?\n\nSome of photo op sessions will be called up in batches from the main theatre for the photo ops based on the âTicket Numberâ on your PDF (pre-purchased in advance of the event and sent to you via email in PDF form). Other photo op sessions will be first come, first served. Please refer to the notes in your schedule. If itâs a photo op session that is called in groups, it will be noted on the photo op listing in the schedule.\n\nIf you are accompanied by/or accompanying a minor or if you are a caretaker or have a caretaker who will not be in the photo, they will be asked to wait across the room (but will still be in view) while your photo op is in progress.\n\nCAN I TAKE A SPECIAL POSE?\n\nSpecial poses have always been at the discretion of the celebrities. Physical contact of any kind is at the discretion of the actor, hugs are not guaranteed. Touching or pretending to touch the face, hair or forehead, floor poses and poses of sexual nature are not permitted. Please keep in mind that the actors, while recognizable to us because we see them on TV, films and on their social media pages (if applicable), we are strangers to them, so donât do anything to them that you wouldnât want a stranger to do to you. Please be respectful of the celebrityâs personal space.â\n\nâCovid-19 and disease policy updates: State and local mandates change daily. We are and will continue to monitor any and all regulations that would affect photo ops (the need for masks/plexiglass or other safety measures) and will post any changes in our policy as soon as possible on the specific shows web page.â\n\nCAN I USE A PROP?\n\nProps are ok unless deemed inappropriate by Creation or the actor. Items that pose a safety risk, putting on or taking off clothing items, require clean-up or may delay the photo op session (eg: handcuffs, water or nerf guns, projectile toys, confetti, flower petals, boas) are not permitted at any time. Every item brought into a photo op will be checked at the photo op line prior to your photo op. Please note that props are ultimately up to the actors and may be declined at their discretion.\n\nWeapons policy: Please do not bring any weapons to the show. If you are using a prop weapon for a photo op or as part of the cosplay contest, please bring it to registration to get tagged. After your photo op or cosplay contest is over, please do not have your prop weapon on the convention floor at any time. Prop weapons without tags will not be allowed at any time.\n\nHOW MANY FANS CAN BE IN ONE PICTURE?\n\nThe maximum number of patrons in a photo op with a celebrity is up toÂ FOUR PEOPLE. If you purchase ONE photo op ticket (that includes solo, duos or group photos), you can include up to TWO fans (one photo op tix = up to two fans). If you purchase TWO photo op tickets, you can include FOUR fans in a photo (two photo op tix = up to four fans). We cannot, however, accommodate over FOUR fans in any one photo op. There are absolutely NO exceptions to this rule. Please note: 1 8x10 glossy photo is provided per photo op. Also, please note that personal photography is NOT ALLOWED at any autograph or photo op session. Photo prints and jpegs of your photo ops may be used for personal use only.\n\nHOW MANY COPIES CAN I GET OF MY PHOTO OP?\n\nWe supply ONE printed photo, no matter how many fans are in the picture. Click here for more information on how to order your photo in jpeg form. Photo ops are for personal use only and may not be used for advertisement or endorsement in any way.\n\nHOW WILL I RECEIVE MY PHOTO OPS?\n\nYour photo print is generally available for pick-up one or two hours after the photo op session or, in some rare instances, the following day of the convention. If your photos were taken late on Sunday and are not available for pick-up before you leave, Creation will post on the website all the remaining photos as soon as possible after the event. You will be able to claim your photo(s) by CLICKING HERE and we will carefully protect and mail your photo to you within 2-3 weeks at our expense.\n\nCAN I GIVE GIFTS TO THE CELEBRITY AT THE PHOTO OP SESSIONS?\n\nNo. Due to security considerations and guest concerns we can no longer facilitate the giving of gifts to guests at the photo op sessions. Please check the show website for addresses for where you can send gifts to. Creation is not responsible if the gift sent to the address provided is not accepted.\n\nWHERE DO I SHOW UP FOR MY PHOTO OP?\n\nPHOTO OP times and locations are included in the Schedule of Events, which is available for download on the website by Wednesday or Thursday of the week of the convention. Printed copies are also available on-site at registration. Sometimes PHOTO OPS sessions take place at the same time other activities are going on at the convention. Please make sure to note the time and location of your photo op, so you donât miss it.Â Unless indicated in the schedule to wait in the main theater for your photo op, please go to the photo op location and queue up five minutes prior to the PHOTO OP scheduled time. Unless your photo op session is called by number, photo ops are done on a first come, first serve basis. If you have a special event (meet & greet, tour, etc) that might conflict with a scheduled photo op and/or autograph and the instruction to handle your conflict is NOT listed in the schedule, please go to registration BEFORE your conflict happens so we can help you.\n\nWILL PHOTO OP TICKETS BE ON SALE AT THE CONVENTION?\n\nYes, unless sold out. Sometimes the price at the event will be slightly higher than the price on the website.\n\nWHAT SHOULD I WEAR?\n\nYour photo will no doubt be highly prized and saved for years, so we suggest giving some thought to your wardrobe. White generally does not photograph well.\n\nI DIDN'T PICK UP MY PHOTO OP PICTURE AT THE CONVENTION\n\nYou can find the information about how to get your photo op print here:Â www.creationent.com/past_photo_ops.htmÂ\n\nAUTOGRAPHS\n\nHOW ARE AUTOGRAPHS DONE?\n\nAutographs (included in Gold/Silver packages):Â The Gold and Silver package holders (who have complimentary autographs included in their packages) are called up row by row with VIPs being called first. Once we get through the Gold and Silver rows, we will call the pre-purchased autograph tickets (that were purchased in advance of the event and sent via email in PDF form) by the âSEQâ number on your PDF. After PDFs are called, we will call hard tickets (autograph tickets that were purchased at the convention. If you have multiple autograph tickets, please get all your autographs done at the same time.\n\nAutographs (not included in any package): If an actor is not signing for any ticket package, PDFs (tickets pre-purchased in advance of the event and sent via email in PDF form) will be called first by the âSEQâ number located on the PDF, followed by hard tickets (autograph tickets that were purchased at the convention).\n\nWILL AUTOGRAPH TICKETS BE ON SALE AT THE CONVENTION?\n\nYes, unless sold out. Sometimes the price will be slightly higher than the price on the website. Some actorsâ autographs are only available for our Gold and Silver packages and are not available for purchase separately. For Gold and Silver patrons, please check the your âBenefitsâ listing to see which actors are included in your package before buying separate autograph ticket(s).\n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING AUTOGRAPHS:\n\nOnly those with an autograph ticket for that specific actor may approach the autograph table. If you are accompanied by/or accompanying a minor, or if you are a caretaker or have a caretaker who does not have an autograph ticket, they may stand in line with you, but when it comes time to have your item signed, they will be asked to stand in a nearby area while you get your item signed.\n\nOnly one item can get signed per each autograph ticket.\n\nYou must bring an item for the guest to sign i.e. a photo or other items\n\nIf you have difficulty standing or require special assistance, notify the autograph MC.\n\nPhoto-taking of the celebrity guests during autograph sessions is not allowed.Â\n\nPersonalizations are at the discretion of the celebrity and may be determined by scheduling or other issues.\n\nItems that are deemed inappropriate will not be presented at the autograph table.\n\nÂ\n\nVIP EXPERIENCE/MEET & GREETS\n\nMEET AND GREET AND BACKSTAGE VIP TICKET AUCTIONS\n\nMeet and Greet and VIP Experience spots are done via our auction site . Â\n\nWe try to auction off these special events approximately 2-4 weeks prior to a convention, though it may not always be the case. Our auctions are announced through our Â\n\nemail mailing list for that specific show, so please join at www.creationent.com/email.htm and click on the show youâd like notifications for. We try our best to send announcements as soon as we can.\n\nSPECIAL CELEBRITY EVENTS\n\nSPECIAL CELEBRITY DAYTIME, EVENING AND CITY TOUR EVENTS\n\nAt some of our events, we offer special events with some of our celebrities such as karaoke parties, concerts, dinner, game night and city tours. These create a fun and different way of interacting with your favorite celebrities. Please check the event website to see what Special Celebrity Events are offered! Any new events that are added are announced via our email list for that specific show and full details will be listed on that showâs website. To join our mailing list, click here!\n\nKARAOKE\n\nThe Karaoke Party is free for everyone! You do not need any convention ticket in order to attend the Karaoke. We do, however, have a few criteria to submit a song request:\n\n1. Karaoke Party is free for all to attend, but if you want to submit a song request, you must have an attendee pass for that day.\n\n2. First and Last names are required for sign-up\n\n3. One Entry per person (whether a group or solo)\n\n4. Two people max on any entry and full names of each person must be written on the slip\n\n5. Upbeat songs are suggested!\n\nOK, IâVE ORDERED MY TICKETS AND HAVE ARRIVED FOR MY WEEKEND OF FUN! HOW DO I GET IN?\n\nREGISTRATION\n\nMost often we do pre-registration the night before the convention starts. Priority pre-registration is for full convention package holders ONLY (Gold, Silver, Copper and General Admission Weekend). This is not mandatory (and you can register during regular convention hours) but this allows you to get your weekend admission credentials, printed schedules and purchase any autograph and photo op tickets still available ahead of time, as well as get first crack at souvenirs and exclusive merchandise in the vendors room.Â\n\nIf you have only single-day tickets, you must register on that specific day during registration hours (and not before). The times will be listed on the online schedule.Â Please note: You will not be able to purchase autograph and/or photo op tickets before registering for that specific day. Only those with valid wristbands for that specific day may purchase autograph and/or photo op tickets.\n\nWRISTBANDS\n\nWhen you turn in your printed PDF (admission ticket purchased in advance of the event), you will receive a wristband. The wristband must be worn at all times, and they are non-transferrable. If you are a Gold, Silver or Copper patron, you must wear your wristband AND badge for access.\n\nACCESSIBILITY\n\nInquiries involving sign language interpreters for deaf and hearing-impaired fans, and those with physical challenges. Please contact us no later than four weeks prior to an event and we must see a copy of your purchased ticket for the event in order to set up the accommodations. Please write to:Â asponsor@creationent.com\n\nI STILL HAVE MORE QUESTIONS...\n\nQuestions not addressed here can be directed to:Â\n\ncustomer.service@creationent.com. Customer service hours are Monday-Friday, 9am-4:30pm Pacific time. If you have an issue over the weekend pertaining to a show that is happening that same weekend, please go in-person to the convention registration desk for assistance. Requests sent to Customer Service over the weekend may not be received until the Monday after the convention is over.\n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION\n\nHere is some pertinent information for you to have about Creationâs conventions, certain policies and more:\n\nAll policies, guests and scheduling are subject to change.\n\nADMISSION TICKETS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE AND NON-EXCHANGEABLE\n\nCreation Entertainment does not advertise any talent without written permission from the talent or their representation.Â\n\nPlease do not come for just one actor. Our events are a celebration of the series and multiple actors from the show attend. If we have a cancelation, we will do our best to book a replacement or we will provide our Gold/Silver patrons with a pre-signed photo of the actor not in attendance if the canceled actor was signing for Gold/Silver.\n\nIn the event of a guest cancellation or a date change: ALL GUESTS are contracted to appear and all convention contracts specify that appearances are tentative and subject to change as film and television work demands take precedence as well as a personal conflict. Our events will take place whether a specific guest cancels or not and therefore we cannot issue admission ticket or ticket package refunds if a particular guest is not able to attend. If a guest must cancel their appearance at the convention, and/or in the extremely rare chance that an actor does not finish his or her autographs or photo ops, we will only be responsible for the refund of the separate autograph, photo op, or actor-specific experience (e.g. meet & greet or specific class) ticket. We will issue a credit voucher on-site for the separately purchased photo op, autograph, or actor-specific experience ticket, which is redeemable for the current conventionâs photo/auto/experience tickets, or Creation Entertainment-produced merchandise in our vendors area at the convention. The voucher with any remaining balance can be mailed to our office at the conclusion of the convention for a refund back to the account on file used to make the original payment. Creation Entertainment is not responsible for any refunds other than separate guest autograph tickets, photo op or special event tickets involving the guest.Â\n\nCreation is also not be held responsible for any financial loss associated with the purchase of air tickets or hotel rooms that are not canceled (virtually all hotels offer a 24 or 48-hour cancelation policy, so there should be no jeopardy associated with reservations). We highly recommend you purchase travel insurance for any unforeseen issues.\n\nDisease and Illness Disclaimer: By using your admission pass, you recognize that disease and illness, including, but not limited to, the coronavirus (COVID-19) and the common cold, may be spread through interaction with other people. Creation Events programs may be attended by many, sometimes numbering in the hundreds. Social distancing and other measures at these events is very difficult, if not impossible, to practice and enforce. Therefore, you agree that you will not purchase an event admission pass if you know you have symptoms of COVID-19 or any other communicable disease or illness, or you have a high risk of contracting or suffering from one, and you certify that you do not have any reason to believe that you have been exposed to or could be a carrier of any disease or illness. If you do attend, you agree that you will take all possible steps to protect your health and the health of others attending the event. You further agree that, by using an admission pass and attending, you thereby waive any claim of liability you might make against Creation Entertainment, Inc. or its officers, directors, employees and agents as a result of your contracting disease or illness from attending one of our events, and you agree that you will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Creation Entertainment, Inc. and its officers, directors, employees and agents against any loss that any of them may suffer or be obligated to pay as a result of any claim that may be made against any of them by others, as a result of your attending the event, including, but not limited to, legal damages, attorney's fees and court costs. If you are unsure of your status, please consult with your doctor before purchasing an event admission pass.

The companyâs complete policy is stated on each schedule of events that is handed out at each convention. If you witness bad behavior at an event, immediately notify the contact listed on the rules page of your printed schedule. We cannot do anything about it if complaints come after the event is over.\n\nTeam Members: We are so grateful and fortunate to have the support of our Team Members, whose continued efforts and dedication help make our conventions possible.Â They are available to assist you with any questions you mayÂ have about convention events and activities, however if you have an issue, please ask to speak to Management on-site.Â Check your schedule rules page to see which manager is on-site at your specific event.Â If you would like to submit an application to be considered as a Team Member, please visit our Jobs/Team Members section of our website by clickingÂ here.\n\nFor those attending our conventions and making travel plans:Â Please know that many of the headliners who appear onstage on Sunday usually do so towards the later part of the day. Autograph signings can run into the evening until 9:00PM-10:00PM. For those traveling from out of town, we do suggest staying over until Monday in order to get your autographs and the full convention experience. Creation is not responsible for any costs associated with travel for any attendee. We highly suggest you purchase travel insurance in the event that anything should happen.Â Â\n\nWe are not responsible for orders that are rejected during processing: On rareÂ occasion, an error may occur during the ordering process that can require the order to be resubmitted.Â This can include:Â Incomplete form submission (usually caused by not completing the entire ordering process to the very end); Credit card failures (usually caused when there are not enough funds in an account or the credit card company rejects the charge for any number of reasons including out of state, international or unfamiliar ordering to the customersâ general pattern); or system errors during transmission of the order.Â\n\nWe suggest buying tickets only through this website: Because all tickets are scanned for use at the convention, we can ONLY allow the first person in using each singular ticket. Autograph and photo op tickets are also scanned for one-time use.Â PLEASE BE CAREFUL!Â\n\nAll admission pass and a la carte ticket prices are subject to change at any time, so please order as early as possible. Â\n\nAdmission ticket packages do not include photo ops: Photo ops must be purchased separately on this site or at the convention (if not sold out).Â NOTE:Â You may buy Photo Op and Autograph tickets before buying an Admission ticket,Â but you need an Admission ticket for the day of your Photo Op or Autograph in order to use the Photo Op and Autograph tickets at the convention (unless the guest has changed days). Please buy an Admission ticket for the day of your Photo Op or Autograph as soon as you can as we canât guarantee Admission tickets won't sell out before the show. Please, absolutely, do not ask for exceptions to this rule.Â Â\n\nAlcoholic beverages at the convention:Â At most of our events, we do not allow alcohol to be present in our function rooms, including the main theatre. This includes daily panel events, meet & greets and any night events. Water stations will be available in the room. We reserve the right to perform bag checks at any time. We reserve the right to deny entrance into any of the events to anyone who appears intoxicated.Â If there is an instance of alcoholic beverages sold, your ID will be checked by the bartender and any underage customers will not be served any alcoholic beverages. Creation is not responsible for the alcohol consumption of others.\n\nWeapons policy: Please do not bring any weapons to the show.

Prop weapons without tags will not be allowed at any time.\n\nLost or misplaced items: We are not responsible for lost or misplaced items. We cannot replace autograph or photo op tickets that are purchased at the convention, so PLEASE make sure your tickets are kept in a safe place.Â\n\nADA Rules on service animals:Â This event welcomes service animals as per ADA rules. Service animals perform valuable work or tasks and are trained to provide help directly related to a person's disability. Dogs whose sole function is to provide comfort or emotional support do not qualify as service animals under the ADA and therefore are not permitted at our event.Â\n\nPhoto taking policy at this convention:Â We know that taking photos makes the convention even more fun. In the main theatre, photo taking is encouraged but only from your seat. It is unfair to run up to the stage and block the view of others who have paid for reserved seats in front of you. Even if there are empty seats, patrons must sit in the seats they paid for to be fair to everyone. Due to Fire Marshall regulations, everyone must be seated during performances. Please also be courteous to your neighbors when taking pictures. Photo taking is not allowed during autographing sessions nor during photo ops.\n\nAudio or video capture for personal use is allowed except in certain circumstances: Photography and audio or video capture are for personal use only - public dissemination and commercial use strictly prohibited. If there is a time where we cannot allow audio or video capturing of the Q&As, we will advise in advance. AUDIO/VIDEO CAPTURING IS NOT ALLOWED DURING AUTOGRAPHS, PHOTO OPS AND SOME MEET & GREETS. LIVE STREAMING IS NOT ALLOWED AT ANY TIME.\n\nRaffles/Fundraising: Unsanctioned raffles and fundraisers are not allowed at Creation events.\n\nFlashes from phone and cameras occur often during stage presentations:Â If you are sensitive to such lighting please be advised to take the necessary precautions.
