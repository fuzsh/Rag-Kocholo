        "text": "A broad survey of American culture formed by global, national, and regional influences. The first section, \"World,\" looks at the United States as a product and shaper of international movements, ideas, and cultures from 1500 to the present. The second section, \"Nation,\" examines the creation of a distinctly American identity between 1790 and 1890 that ultimately incorporated and reflected global issues. The third section, \"Regions,\" focuses on the South and other regions as contributors to and consequences of national and global interactions. Team taught by the entire AMS faculty, lectures will include topics on film, music, literature, art, sports, and other cultural artifacts. Offered spring semester.\n\nA lecture/discussion course utilizing a biographical approach to the salient themes, issues, and episodes of the American West. Some of these lives are real, some of them imagined, and others are a little of each. All of them, however, reveal much about both region and nation and how each has changed over time.\n\nThere’s a lot more to Native Americans than the first Thanksgiving, the Battle of the Little Bighorn, and casinos (although we’ll discuss all those things too). This course will introduce you to the diversity of Native American societies, their histories, and their significant influence on American culture, contemporary U.S. policy, and law. We’ll be examining everything from ancient archaeological artifacts to contemporary film and literature as we investigate the vital role of indigenous people in North America. As much as possible, we’ll be directly engaging Native sources and voices as we explore the struggles over land, sovereignty, and culture that have shaped (and continue to shape) Native American lives.\n\nThis course introduces students to the range of issues and analytical approaches that form the foundation of Latinx studies. By tracing the history of the Latinx concept in relation to key elements of life, such as time, space, identity, community, power, language, nation, and rights, students will develop understandings of the particular ways in which Latinx studies takes shape. Focus for the course will be on the largest Latino groups in the U.S.: those of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban and Dominican descent.\n\nThis course will provide a basic understanding of immigration to the United States and its social and political consequences, including the role immigration and immigrants have played on the development of the U.S. In doing this, students will examine what it means to be an American and why the criterion for becoming an American has, and continues to be, in flux. Additionally, students will use primary and secondary sources to cover today’s headlines and major milestones in immigration history to understand why immigrants and migrants have always been perceived as the “other.”.\n\nThe purpose of this course is to introduce students to the intricacies of city life and to look at how place and space shape the human experience. Throughout the course, we will examine the city as a physical and spatial place as well as a place defined by its people and institutions. We consider the social and behavioral relations that form communities, including the diversity produced by factors such as race, class, and gender. As we proceed through the course, you should come to understand that physical and social structures are related to one another, and often times, are inseparable.\n\nDuring the past decade, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) Americans have achieved various forms of empowerment and visibility in the nation’s political, legal, social, and cultural arenas. However, LGBTQ persons continue to face various barriers to full equality and well-being including employment discrimination, high rates of homelessness among teens, violence, and inadequate access to health care. This 3 credit hour course places the events of the last decade into a longer history of LGBTQ communities, visibility and politics that begins in the late nineteenth century and ends in the early twenty-first century. During the semester, we will explore the historical development of LGBTQ identities, communities, politics, and cultural production. Together, we will analyze an array of materials including scholarly texts, oral histories, newspapers, films, photographs, art and political ephemera.\n\nThis course analyzes the changing nature of American values for the period dating from the 1970s through the 2000s by examining key developments in the everyday life patterns and cultural expressions of Americans in contexts that range from the local to the international. In doing so, we will draw connections between the economic and political contexts of these decades and contemporaneous works of creative expression and popular culture. This course also will serve as an introduction to the types of interdisciplinary research methods used in American Studies. Offered fall and spring semesters.*.\n\nThis course analyzes the changing nature of American values for the period dating from the 1970s through the 2000s by examining key developments in the everyday life patterns and cultural expressions of Americans in contexts that range from the local to the international.

This course also will serve as an introduction to the types of interdisciplinary research methods used in American Studies.\n\nThis course will tell the story of mainstream popular music in the United States from the arrival of rock and roll in the 1950s through to the present, including stops along the way for Top 40, soul, arena rock, country, punk, MTV, hip-hop, electronic dance music, American Idol, and the culture of streaming hits on YouTube and Spotify today. In addition to learning about different kinds of sounds, students will read work by artists, fans, and label people to think about how music shaped identity — the soundtrack of new groups emerging in American life.\n\nShining a light on a marginalized yet momentous figure—the poor white—this class asks: What kinds of cultural work do representations of poor white Southerners do? How do depictions of poor white women’s experiences differ from men’s? How and why do accounts of poor white life in the South change over time? We will study scholarly analyses, fictional works, autobiographies, and movies in search of answers to these and other questions.\n\nThis course focuses on the history of people of Latin American descent (Latinas/os) living in the United States. Although we will examine communities comprised of people of Central and South American descent, the focus of this course will be on the four largest Latinx groups: those of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban and Dominican descent. Students will become familiar with issues that have affected different Latinx populations in the United States: migration patterns, cultural interaction, community and cultural formation; and racial formations. We will also examine relations among Latinx and European immigrants, and consider the affects of US intervention and imperialism in Latin America on US Latinx communities. Lectures, readings, and films will explore connections between the past and the present and provide students a forum to express their own viewpoints on the legacy of this history. Writing proficiency is required for a passing grade in this course. A student who does not write with the skill normally required of an upper-division student will not earn a passing grade, no matter how well the student performs in other areas of the course.\n\nThis course explores the centrality of amusement and tourism in defining the American pursuit of happiness. The course examines varied forms of leisure culture that emerged in the 19th century and exploded in popularity throughout the 20th century. By asserting connections between a wide range of amusement and tourist activities, the course provides a framework for understanding how Americans at play participate in a vibrant component of American social, economic, and aesthetic history.\n\nAn examination of the objects created by African Americans variously classified as \"folk,\" \"self-taught,\" and \"outsider\" artists. Course material will address the African origins and American transformations of traditional arts and crafts (architecture, pottery, iron work, and quilting) as well as the work of selected 20th-century artists in such media as painting, sculpture, and assemblage. Key concerns will include not only analysis and cultural/historical contextualization of these artists and their works but also political and theoretical debates with respect to issues of collection, modes of exhibition, and use of the above-listed classifications. Writing proficiency is required for a passing grade in this course. A student who does not write with the skill normally required of an upper-division student will not earn a passing grade, no matter how well the student performs in other areas of the course. One of the written assignments will be graded and returned before the mid-term.\n\nThis course examines the often contentious and always passionate American relationship with “nature,” an idea as much as a physical reality. Students consider the varying ways that nature has been imagined over a wide range of time periods and through the lenses of various forms of creative expression and cultural practices. The course explores how our complex relationship with “nature” has influenced American culture at large, its history and mainstream values.\n\nThis course explores the Great Depression, the single most important economic event of the 20th Century. We will focus on the causes, events, policies, movements, personalities, and human tragedy and triumph of this era through an interdisciplinary historical perspective that will examine aspects of this twentieth century crisis. As an American Studies course, we will use films, TV shows, written narratives, and music to explore the era.\n\nThis course looks at science fiction through literature, film, and television. We’ll explore how futuristic settings reflected anxieties of the all-too-real present. These included the impact of new technology, changing notions of race, gender, sexuality, and class, threats to life such as the Cold War, and the general sense of constant, rapid change in modern life. Writing proficiency is required for a passing grade in this course. A student who does not write with the skill normally required of an upper-division student will not earn a passing grade, no matter how well the student performs in other areas of the course.\n\nAfter 1965, rock and roll became rock, representing the counterculture; rhythm and blues became soul, representing Black Power; and country music became the emotional voice of the post-Civil Rights white South. This class contrasts these three dominant American popular music genres, with particular emphasis on how race, but also gender, class, and region, came to invest certain sounds with charged social significance. Writing proficiency is required for a passing grade in this course. A student who does not write with the skill normally required of an upper-division student will not earn a passing grade, no matter how well the student performs in other areas of the course.\n\nWhat insights into American experience are afforded by reading nineteenth- and twentieth-century texts in which Southern women engage questions of gender, class, race, labor, and region?

Examines ways in which African American art has alternately reflected, shaped, and challenged such important historical events and currents as the Harlem Renaissance, the Great Depression, the Cold War, the Civil Rights and Black Power movements, the Women's Movement, and contemporary identity politics. Also evaluates the contributions of selected artists in relation to such key art movements as Modernism, Social Realism, and Postmodernism.\n\nThis course examines the American War on Drugs through film. The course starts with the premise that the content in films, and the events contemporary to the making of the films, should be critically analyzed for their perspectives, biases, reliability, and interpretive choices. In the course, students will examine the ability of film to successfully portray the war on drugs and analyze how present events, cultures and attitudes shape our view of the past. Students will examine how the history of drugs in the U.S and how the war on drugs affects people of different nationalities and of different racial and ethnic groups.\n\nWhat insights into American experience do we gain by reading texts in which Southern women engage questions of gender, class, race, labor, and region?

Course materials include ethnographic writing, sound recordings, film, and folklore scholarship. The course also will consider the competing definitions of “folk” and “folklore” prevalent from the late 19th century to the present. Assignments will emphasize experiential learning through student collection and analysis of original folklore material.\n\nNative American imagery is widespread in American culture, from butter packaging to sports mascots and from children’s picture books to epic films. These depictions have embedded ideas about American Indians—often romanticized, stereotyped, or just inaccurate ideas—in the imaginations of millions of readers and film-goers. In this course, we will examine representations of Native Americans in art, writing, film, music, and more, ranging from early encounters between Natives and newcomers to contemporary pop culture. We’ll consider continuities and changes in how Indians have been imagined by outsiders, while also exploring Native self-representation in the face of cultural appropriation and stereotyping. We’ll explore a variety of methods and sources as we reflect on the pervasiveness of ideas about, and images of, Natives in American culture.

This interdisciplinary course examines key concepts and controversies in American thought about nature since before colonization. Using accounts from various regions, the course explores evolving conceptions of nature and justice, competing claims about race and class, and changing institutional responses and remedies to environmental degradation in the context of global change. The course is highly interactive, inviting critical thinking about the human place in the physical world. We read and discuss ecological views as presented in colonial writings, slave narratives, Transcendentalist thought, Gilded Age preservationist and conservationist debates, and the work of Progressive Era occupational health specialists and ecologists.

Our focus will be on commercial mainstreams and democratic audiences – how selling sound led to different identities being expressed through taste and style. Race, gender, class, sexuality, age, technology, and the music business will all factor as we move from blackface minstrelsy in the 1800s to World War II.
