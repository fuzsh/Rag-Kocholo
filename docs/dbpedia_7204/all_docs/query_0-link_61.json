        "text": "Sign up for our Watching newsletter to get recommendations on the best films and TV shows to stream and watch, delivered to your inbox.\n\nThe Disney-owned Hulu streaming service is still, more than 15 years into its existence, thought of first as a repository for new television (and, for many cord-cutters, the “live TV” option of choice) and second as a library of indisputable TV classics, usually in their entirety. But savvy viewers can also find a rotating library of movies, both new releases and recent classics, rivaling the collections of many of its competitors — if they know where to look. We’re here to help.\n\nWe also have lists of the best movies and TV shows on Netflix, the best of both on Disney+ and the best movies on Amazon Prime Video.\n\n‘Casino’ (1995)\n\nThe “Goodfellas” team — the director Martin Scorsese, the writer Nicholas Pileggi, and the stars Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci — reunited five years later for this “dazzlingly stylish” follow-up. Inspired by true events, they tell the story of Sam “Ace” Rothstein, a numbers whiz turned casino boss whose Vegas empire was undone by his inflated hubris and misplaced loyalty. Its contemporary critics widely dismissed “Casino” as a lesser “Goodfellas,” but the passage of time has revealed its true genius as a bigger, bolder and more operatic exploration of that picture’s themes, expanded to include sly critiques of conspicuous capitalism and political corruption. And Sharon Stone does career-best, Oscar-nominated work as a complicated woman who dazzles Rothstein into risking (and losing) it all.\n\nWatch it on Hulu"
