        "text": "2What cultural historians such as Richard Slotkin refer to as the myth of the frontier can be defined in simple terms as the belief that the frontier is the birthplace of the American nation, of its democratic polity, its capitalistic economy and its national identity (Slotkin 10). In other words, the frontier myth tells us that the modern American nation is born in the experience of colonization.\n\n11Kelly Reichardt’s Western Meek’s Cutoff (2010) and Chloe Zhao’s post-Westerns Songs My Brother Taught Me (2015) and The Rider (2017) are examples of films combining alternative viewpoints and narrative trajectories with historical realism and dynamic identities in a way that also engages with some of these strategies’ individual limits.\n\n13Songs My Brother Taught Me and The Rider were both shot on and around the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota. Both are about social life and culture on the present-day Oglala Sioux reservation, and both focus on young male protagonists with clear goals (escaping the reservation or getting back to rodeo). In both cases, their love for, and desire to protect, their younger or mentally disabled sisters lead them to renounce their dreams and embrace their family. If both films superficially embody one side of the cultural coin in the contemporary West—the Native American perspective in Songs and the poor cowboy perspective in The Rider—they depict a network of exchanges, miscegenation, acculturation, and syncretism that challenges notions of fixed and distinct political identities. The narratives of these films are denser than in Meek’s Cutoff, and their pace is relatively faster, but they retain a distinct artistic quality in their elliptical editing and narration, and their blend of social realism and contemplative lyricism to explore the line between myth and history in the imaginary of the West.\n\n14Meek’s Cutoff and Zhao’s two films are contemporary rewritings of the frontier myth that are similar in many ways and complementary in others. Both play the mythologies of the American West against the realities and consequences of settler colonialism. Both provide alternative perspectives on the politics of empire. Both construct the Western frontier as a zone of contact, a shared space of dynamic and hybrid identities. And both challenge the original epic story of linear conquest by redefining what it means to inhabit the Great American desert. But they also differ in their preferred focus for cultural and political rewriting: Meek’s Cutoff’s main work centers on its alternative feminine perspective and on a deflation of the myth in its original historical terrain; Zhao’s films are more about producing a postcolonial perspective on the contemporary West as a marginalized yet fascinating frontera.\n\nRealism and Female Agency in the Historical West in Meek’s Cutoff\n\nHow the Social-Realist Rendering of History Deflates the Myth of the West\n\n15Meek’s Cutoff opens on a card announcing the film’s title and setting in Oregon in 1845 (Fig. 1). The words are crudely sewn on a wagon canvass, framed by the silhouette of a tree and a myriad of stars, the image itself creating a childlike yet forbidding impression. This balance between innocence and fear is emphasized by the musical score, with notes that blend the harmonious with the atonal. It is made clear from this opening image that what fuels the settlers’ hopes in moving west on the Oregon Trail (the mythical virgin lands of economic betterment, of moral and social renewal associated with the West) will also be the cause of their physical and psychological downfall. With this opening, Meek’s Cutoff indicates that it will converse with a tradition of films that presented the American desert as a puritan wilderness, an obstacle to the forces of civilization, and a source of corruption rather than of redemption for the civilized soul. A haunting hypotext to Reichardt’s film is The Searchers, whose main character Ethan Edwards is corrupted by the savagery of the frontier. Other imagery that comes to mind includes the teeth-like rock formations framed by ominous sounds in the opening of The Hills Have Eyes (Wes Craven, 1977), as well as the opening shot of There Will Be Blood (Paul Thomas Anderson, 2007), with the same grinding strings evoking the demonic character of the desert.\n\n17The slow depletion of water supplies and gradual exhaustion of the characters are mirrored in the absence of spectacular features: the limited film format, minimalist narrative, sparse dialogue, music and action, and slow pace (with long takes of 10 to 30 seconds), refuse the easy pleasures of mainstream cinema and force upon the viewer the slow progression of an obstinate wandering through nothingness, with no guarantee of ever arriving somewhere. Some critics (Dan Kois) complained about how exhausting the film was, probably out of cultural fatigue at having to labor through yet another scarcely rewarding art film (Kois 2011), and Reichardt’s style has often been described as dry and anti-sensualist. In Meek’s Cutoff, however, it serves to express a sense of the consuming dimension of the characters’ journey.\n\n18The relative absence of music emphasizes the isolation of the characters in the great void and desert silence surrounding them. But the consequent foregrounding of foley sounds also serves to transform the familiar tones of rolling wagons into the foreboding fracas of a thunderstorm. The creation of a sense of alienation from what is familiar (both in the viewer’s common perception of reality and generic expectations regarding the Western) is a central strategy of the film. This sense of alienation is heightened by the ambiguous situation of the viewer, who is positioned uncomfortably close to the characters’ plight yet never given access to their inner lives. The bonnets and beards hinder direct access to faces, which remain often distant, decentered or turned away—­this is notably the case in the introducing shots (Fig. 3). They are enveloped in an air of mystery, which invites viewers to actively scrutinize the screen surface for meaning, thus mirroring the characters’ own sense of loss and search for redemptive signs on the blank surface of the desert.\n\n19The monotonous landscape, often filmed in static shots and left unmoved by the passing of the characters, remains indifferent to human suffering and the futile scheme of Western colonization. Its barrenness, emphasized by a low positioning of the camera that cuts off western skies, belies any hope of wealth and betterment in migrating west, while its overwhelming presence, desperately unbounded in the narrow screen format, works to further alienate the characters from their quest and themselves, their purpose lost and sound mind altered to a trancelike state. One scene (Fig. 4) suggests Victor Sjöström’s The Wind (1928), in which the main female character played by Lillian Gish loses her sanity to the desert wind (White 224).\n\n20In such a dry, unblinking take on the unsettling routine of westward migration, even the sunset cinematography, usually associated with the triumphant direction of Manifest Destiny or the transcendentalist ethos of a sacred landscape, is turned into symbolic torture and the promise of death, with the backlit, dark silhouettes appearing to be lashed by brutal lens flares (Fig. 5), as Elena Gorfinkel has noted (130). With the magic-hour light turned into a threat, every element of mythical dimension is deflated, the story reduced to the individual scale of micro-history and the inglorious experience of settlers, visionaries or fools, on a strange continent.\n\nAn Alternative Trajectory to Westward Conquest\n\n21The dissolves in the sunset sequence point to a specific construction of cinematographic time and space that belies any notion of progression. Borders between moments and places are blurred in a seamless continuum; the dissolves between sequences are dilated to emphasize the absence of starting or ending point in a scene (see for instance the end of the opening sequence). This continuum is heightened by the atonal music, which refuses the slightest form of melodic line and embraces instead a kind of shapeless atmosphere. Along with the absence of time boundaries, the slow pace and repetitive patterns of the narrative can be added to the list of elements resisting the sense of linear progression.\n\n22Progress in time is undermined just as it is in space. In the opening title, the film’s subject (the tragic historical event known as Meek’s Cutoff), a central narrative element (the hope for water evoked by the tree and stars) and final image (the tree) are all already established, defusing any idea of narrative progression from beginning to end, just as the immediate recognition that the characters are “lost” in the introducing sequence—a character carving the word on a log—forestalls any linear westward trajectory. By the time the film has reached its’ concluding fade-out, no tangible progress has been made, and the characters and viewers have no idea whether they are ever closer to a resolution than when they started off. The long shots of characters walking in the landscape, virtually immobile in the frame, emphasize the absence of progression in spite of their movements. Though it starts with a leftward trajectory, Meek’s Cutoff ultimately wanders off in circular movements which seem to lead to quasi-stasis.\n\nA Limited Perspective on Colonization\n\n23This anti-epic take on the Western is the setting for an alternative, subaltern perspective on the white man’s story: the white female settler. The women’s active participation in the colonization of the West is established in the introducing sequence, and their point of view is adopted through a positioning of the camera on their side of the wagons. The male deliberations as to the direction of the caravan are set in the distance, their voices muted, so that the viewer, like the female characters, struggles to get a sense of what is being decided (Fig. 6).\n\n24There is a clear gendered hierarchy at work on the wagon trail, which is later contested by Emily Tetherow’s superior clarity as to the predicament of the party and true nature of their guide. Indeed, Stephen Meek, the archetypal Western hero, proves to be nothing but a useless, loudmouth trickster. And while the men show signs of vulnerability and pusillanimity, the women do most of the daily work and use rifles in decisive ways, to alert the men when a Native is seen and later to protect the Native from the racist fear of Meek (Fig. 7).\n\n25Although such an alliance of Native and female clout eventually reverses the white man’s domination, when Meek yields command of the party to Mrs Tetherow and the Indian in the ending sequence, the film never idealizes such alliance but instead emphasizes the women’s, and particularly Emily’s, participation in the colonizing scheme. As Patricia White convincingly argues, such recognition of the white woman’s active position within the framework of colonial enterprise signals the refusal to establish the film’s subaltern perspective as a universal counter-narrative to the white man’s story (224). Such universal pretention would only suppress the multiplicity of other subaltern narratives on the history of colonization and reproduce the oppression and erasure of imperial narration. The characterization of Emily is a clear acknowledgement of this: she may have less power than the men, but she is nonetheless privileged for being white and embraces that privilege in expressions of casual racism. At one point, she complains about “working like niggers, once again,” while at another, she frowns upon Meek for practicing miscegenation with Indians. Once the Native is captured and taken along, women label him “a man-child” and make racist comments like “they don’t think of life the way we do.” Emily even goes so far as to give the him a lesson in civilization: “You can’t imagine what we’ve done, the cities we’ve built,” even though the claim sounds hollow in the midst of such a barren landscape. Emily provides help and protection to the Native not out of humanistic sentiment, but out of interest (“I want him to owe me something.”). The creation of a debt, a practice that historically served the subjugation of Native Americans, is here performed by women.\n\n26Meek’s Cutoff aims not so much to rewrite the history of the American West as to acknowledge the limitations of any such history. The film format encloses the perspective on the infinite West, just as the women’s perspectives are framed and limited by their bonnets. Emily eventually assumes the leadership of the party, but even then, when she is seen deciding on whether or not to continue following the Indian, her gaze on the “savage” is obstructed and reframed by the branches of a half-dead tree, whose virtual apparition in the concluding sequence may or may not be a sign of salvation (Fig. 8). One is tempted, as White argues (224), to see in this thematization of limited perspectives the white female director’s sense of her own particular viewpoint when shooting the history of the West.\n\nCinéma-Vérité vs Myth on the Post-Colonial Frontera in Songs My Brother Taught Me and The Rider\n\nTensions between Myth and Social Realism\n\n27Chloe Zhao’s first two films foreground the tension between myth and reality in a similar way as Meek’s Cutoff, although myth is here retained as a narrative element and driving motivation for the characters. The opening of The Rider, which focuses more directly on the mythology of the cowboy and rodeo culture, problematizes the tension between myth and reality as an aesthetic clash: the artificially lit, warmly colored, slow-motion, close-ups of a horse’s body parts and shiny fur on the rodeo arena (Fig. 9) versus the natural light, cold color scheme, normal speed, of a wounded man waking up in a trailer home (Fig. 10).\n\n28The horse sequence is thus framed as a dream, its sleek aesthetic an indication of the myth’s capacity to distort perception and fuel desire, its fragmented approach to the horse’s body and blurred evocation of spectacle a recognition of the partial nature of a mesmerized gaze. This establishes the central narrative tension for the whole film, with a character drawn by an irresistible force to the practice of rodeo even though that practice is shown to be brutally violent to the riders’ bodies and may cost the character his life.\n\n29Myth is retained in The Rider as in Songs through the main characters’ special relationship with the Western landscape. Magic-hour cinematography is not given a foreboding quality as in Meek’s, but preserves its mythical dimensions, here played out through beautifully balanced shots of characters looking at the desert landscape in embedded contemplation (Fig. 11). What Zhao stages, in these sequences, is the sacred wilderness of the transcendentalists, the wilderness as a place of revelation where human beings come closest to hearing God. One can suspect that the director was herself influenced by such mythical images of the West, since she described herself in interviews as an urbanite feeling stuck in the big cities; she even added, “When you’re stuck historically you go west” (Tartaglione 2017). What drew her to South Dakota was the feeling of being connected with a past unchanged, a contrast to the rapidly changing urban China the director grew up in. Zhao welcomed the change as refreshing and eye-opening. Such an attitude towards the rural West may stem from yet another cliché attached to the region and its people as being closer to primitive truths and natural roots, and thus offering a source of regeneration.\n\n30However, the characters who connect with the landscape are not the indianized whites of the revisionist Western or road movies, but are Native Americans. The focus is not the white gaze on virgin lands that need conquering but the Native intimacy to a land he or she loves, understands and inhabits. The mythic imagery of the West is still present, Western landscapes and an esoteric connection to them are still celebrated, but the myth has been appropriated and redefined by the indigenous population at the center of the narrative. The native Westerners of Zhao’s films embrace the Western desert as their home, and their connection with it is intimate as much as historical, for instance through generational transmission from the old-timers seen in Songs. One scene in Songs explicitly rewrites the mythical iconography of the sunset from a postcolonial perspective by connecting it to Native American revival; Oglala artist Travis, obsessed with the number 7, explains its importance in the Bible and Oglala culture, and identifies the young Jashaun with the first generation of renewal since the Indian wars of the 19th century (Fig. 12). Zhao’s films thus participate in the decolonization of Western mythology by having indigenous characters redefine its meaning.\n\n32Zhao was interested in exploring “a part of the country demonized for probably voting for Trump, but,” she adds, “they are humans” (Tartaglione 2017). This expression of humanist sentiments blended with socio-political concerns can be seen in the way she engages with her material. Realism, in Zhao’s films, has a strong social dimension. Life in trailer parks surviving on low-paying jobs and smuggling, families turned dysfunctional by the toll of poverty and alcohol, social perspectives among the youth limited by their environment, and, more frontally in Songs, cultural genocide and revival among Native American communities (Fig. 14), are documented with tactful sympathy. Judgments are never laid on mothers abandoning their children or young riders risking their lives for a show. The absence of narrative contextualization invites the viewer to adopt an open-minded view, accepting things as they present themselves, reconstructing a coherent filmic world rather than laying judgment upon it. Camera positions that alternate distant and close shots, combined with shallow focus composition and a sustained use of racking focus to direct the gaze, construct a form of empathetic observation that serves to level social and cultural differences between viewers and characters.\n\nThe Politics of the Frontera\n\n33Zhao referred to The Rider as “my version of a feminine gaze on one of the most masculine images in American culture” (Tartaglione 2017). Gender is certainly one of the central concerns of her films. The character of Jashaun in Songs is a gender hybrid full of transformative potential. Through costuming (her father’s riding jacket, pig’s mask to pass as older or ceremonial dress) and social practices (boxing with her brother and painting her toenails with a friend while donning a mustache, Fig. 15), she reveals the constructed nature of identity and embraces the freedom to compose one’s self by performing across normative gender roles (Ben-Youssef 2018). The character of Brady in The Rider struggles as well with gender roles, in the form of the masculine cowboy icon which he strives to emulate against his own vulnerability and sense of community. Zhao’s films treat gender as a construct and document their characters’ strategies of negotiation between, under and across gender norms. The result is a queering of gender categories, which gives characters their subtle psychological complexity.\n\n34The desire to queer the normative categories of identity politics is also visible in the way Zhao’s films treat race and culture. As Zhao expressed in interviews for a French blog, “you know, the cowboys we see in The Rider have Native blood as well. The characters in both my films live on the same reservation. To me it’s not about the color of the skin, I mean they all live together, but it was interesting for me to show both sides” (Wagner 2017). For The Village Voice, the director more clearly emphasized the Sioux identity of her cowboy characters in The Rider, although many of them look white (Eribi 2017). At first glance, one may be tempted to distinguish between the films in terms of their overall perspective on the reservation. Songs adopts a more Native American perspective, with strong political commentary on neocolonial violence, while The Rider explores the fascination for a culture historically associated with white colonialism. Both films, however, construct the reservation as a frontera where races and cultures not only meet, but are mixed and acculturated to the point of indistinction.\n\n35Zhao is not interested in labels, and the style of her films works to soften racial and cultural lines. The absence of narrative contextualization prevents preconceived categories to determine the viewer’s reception of the film, while the handheld camera expresses the blurring of boundaries in the unstable or fluid relation between on- and offscreen. Such instability largely participates in the psychological characterization (for instance, when Jashaun visits the burnt remnants of her father’s house, or when Brady wakes up in the middle of the night to look at his head injury in the mirror), while fluid movements build up a sense of community (for instance, in the scenes connecting Jashaun and her brother Johnny to the landscape in Songs, or the moments of camaraderie preceding the campfire scene of The Rider); it also works to destabilize the limits of the frame and open onto holistic perspectives (e.g., the embers of campfires or desert dust elevating and disappearing into the air at key moments in Songs, Fig. 16). In addition to these poetic elements, what allows Zhao to rewrite the frontier myth in a progressive and inclusive way is, again, the construction of characters that transcend and explode colonial categories.\n\n36In Songs, Oglala children dream of becoming bull riders and Oglala men sing cowboy songs and revere rodeo stars, while the same community sustains local hip hop artists celebrating life on the Rez. Funerals are organized in Christian churches, and burials are performed by the same congregation to the sound of Oglala songs (Fig. 17). Illegal concerts offer both heavy metal and a cappella tribal songs. The young Jashaun blossoms in performing tribal dances in her ceremonial dress, but it is the pop music hit of the time that brings her closer to her brother. In The Rider, cowboys look white yet they spontaneously sing an Oglala song at a bonfire reunion. Rodeo allegedly comes from white folklore, but it is here practiced, watched and celebrated by the residents of the reservation. Despite the painful efforts of white historians and storytellers to erase the Hispanic origins of cowboy culture, The Rider suggests that this culture belongs to anyone who wants to make it their own. And above all, if there are differences in tone and focus between Zhao’s two films, they are bridged in that they both document one same and single place, the Pine Ridge reservation, with shooting locations such as the rodeo arena and the badlands and actors playing secondary characters visible in both. Between races, cultures and stories, lines are blurred, so that the American West regains, in Zhao’s films, its complex and dynamic identity as a frontera.\n\nConclusion"
