        "text": "I was 10 years old when The Road to El Dorado hit theatres in the year of 2000. Before then, the biggest Dreamworks animated feature film that truly blew me away was The Prince of Egypt.\n\nUnlike Mulan and A Bug’s Life, the more kid-friendly Disney films released the same year, The Prince of Egypt was more elegant. It doubled as both a fun childrens’ movie and a mature epic film. Deliver Us is one of the greatest opening scenes of any animated feature, delving deep into themes of oppression, slavery, genocide, but also hope and the belief that things will be better. The treatment of the enslaved Hebrews was done with a dignity that was neither sugarcoated nor exploited. The lead female character Tzipporah was sensual but not sexualized and had more agency and intensity than your average Disney Princess. I was raised Catholic so these very adult, Biblical elements weren’t lost on me, but this was the first time I was truly moved while actively entertained by a “Bible Story.”\n\nTo say Dreamworks Animation had BIG shoes to fill is an understatement. How on Earth was The Road to El Dorado going to follow up The Prince of Egypt?\n\nIn short: it doesn’t. Not by a long shot.\n\nThis is to be expected, of course. The Prince of Egypt and the Road to El Dorado are two very different stories and genres. Pitting them against each other is all but useless. Even then, I remember wanting to like The Road To El Dorado when I first saw the trailer for it. It didn’t have the heaviness and the power of The Prince of Egypt but there was something charming about it.\n\nI missed my chance to see it in theatres but my niece had a copy of it on VHS, so I caught parts of it in passing.\n\nAnd I remember even then being truly, remarkably disappointed at the parts that I caught.\n\nFirst, the two main characters were Spanish. As a Native child who already fought tooth and nail with my teachers about Columbus Day, I already knew something was dreadfully wrong about two Spanish men coming to an indigenous community and being treated as Gods, all in the hopes of stealing their gold. I knew enough about Spanish imperialism that their lust for gold and riches was matched by their bloodshed and barbarism. There was nothing innocent about this “treasure hunt.” I knew how it was ultimately going to end no matter how uplifting and cute the film tried to portray it.\n\nSecond, and perhaps the most devastating part of the film, was that the villain is an indigenous man who is punished by our protagonists by becoming a prisoner to Hernan Cortes. The same Hernan Cortes responsible for committing brutal acts of genocide against indigenous people in Central and South America. Again, as an indigenous child watching this unfold, I couldn’t believe I was expected to be happy about the fate of our villain. I knew, even then, what the Spanish did to their native prisoners. The fact that it was treated as comeuppance or karma was honestly shocking to me.\n\nThird, I could not stand any and every scene with the film’s female lead, Chel. She is the only indigenous female character in an animated film at the time since Pocahontas. At the time, my young mind didn’t fully grasp the cruelty of making this over-sexualized native woman the love interest of the very men whose countrymen would soon rape and murder women just like her. All I knew then was that she existed to be the eye-candy for the male characters and occasionally make funny faces. Hardly the representation an indigenous child watching the film would want to aspire to.\n\nLooking back on Chel as an adult, the issues with her character and design are more prevalent than ever before. As the love interest of one of the white male characters, she does not pass The Aila Test. Her costume lacks any creativity and only accentuates her thighs and hips. She is arguably the only female character in a children’s animated feature (to my knowledge) that engages in an actual sex act. And of course, like most indigenous female characters of the time, her entire purpose of the film is to assist white men while conspiring against her own community. This character breathes new life into every colonial stereotype that romanticizes and sexualizes indigenous women and their relationship to colonial imperialists.\n\nChel is no Elisa Maza, she is no Moana, she is no Aila. She isn’t a Tzipporah, a Marina, or an Eris. She is nothing indigenous girls should want to aspire to be because she was not made for them or with them in mind.\n\nThe above points were reason enough for me to never sit down and watch the film in its entirety. After the brutal but respectful portrayal of oppression and genocide in The Prince of Egypt, to see Dreamworks do a complete 180 with The Road to El Dorado was earth-shattering.\n\nWhether this is a conversation non-native fans are ready to have or not, yes, this does contribute to the massive amount of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women (MMIW). The same way that “sexy Indian princess” and “Pocahotties” costumes also contribute to MMIW. The same way films where Native women are murdered, raped, kidnapped, and abused contribute to MMIW. Native women experience the highest levels of violence and sexual assault in the country. When Native women are featured in any mainstream movie, television, or animation, it is often violently, sexually, or racially insensitive.\n\nAll of these things are connected. All of these portrayals and stereotypes come with mental anguish, emotional baggage, and a body count.\n\nWith all of these problems, any good qualities about the film itself is lost on me. So many friends of mine love the witty banter, the expressive animation, the subtle queer-coding between the two male characters, the comedy and adventure, and I cannot bring myself to love any of it even in a guilty pleasure way. Not at the expense of the anti-native racism that saturates the plot and the characters.\n\nAnd now that the film is being used to harass, doxx, and threaten an indigenous person (whom will not be named to avoid further harassment) who was rightfully irate with the film and the way it characterizes indigenous women, I have fewer reasons to like it. The irony isn’t lost on me that so many non-natives fight tooth and nail to protect the dignity of a fictional character than they would the indigenous person she was meant to represent. I am appalled that the defensiveness for this character and film resulted in threats of violence, death, sexual assault, and every type of online harassment against indigenous people in a matter of hours.\n\nFans of The Road To El Dorado? This is on you to do better, because your problematic fave isn’t more important than the lives and wellbeing of native women who actually exist. Native women don’t need to hear your excuses and alibis for why you love the movie despite its problems. Native women don’t need to know why you think Chel’s portrayal is “harmless” and “empowering, actually.” Native women do need you to listen to us when we tell you something is harming us, because the fact of the matter is, The Road to El Dorado is one of many harmful stories where the anti-native racism is overlooked, ignored, and denied.\n\nAnd we’re done being quiet about your denial, apathy, and cruelty in response to our criticism."
