Film constitutes what Talcott Parsons has termed an “expressive symbol system. That is to say, it is a symbol system in which the expressive orientation is dominant... and directed towards something.” This course will foster the capacity to analyze cinema sociologically by pairing carefully selected films that address central sociological issues such as class, gender, sex, sexuality, race, ethnicity, deviance, urban life, and immigration with topical scholarship in sociology and film. We often watch movies for entertainment, paying little attention to the sociological aspects of movies. Yet, cinema influences and is shaped by ideology, social structure, norms, and social relations. And the film industry reveals the tensions between the drive to profit, make art, send a message, influence the audience, and establish power. The course delves into the way films have reproduced and challenged social conventions by contextualizing current sociological developments in cinema.

(Cross-listed w/ AAST 094-01) This course places Asian Americans at the center of sociological analysis of race, ethnicity, racism, immigration, and collective struggle. Sociological investigations of race, ethnicity and inequality have frequently overlooked Asian Americans and thus implicitly posed them as a group of people unscathed by discrimination. To correct this error, we will employ structural and micro level approaches that unpack how Asian Americans, historically and today, have negotiated a diverse set of intra-group identities and contested the mistreatment to which they have been subjected. No prerequisites\n\nSOC 099 Internship.
