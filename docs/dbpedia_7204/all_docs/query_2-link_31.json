        "text": "Abstract: As a counterpoint to the Western notion of the Sublime, which represents Nature as a force that we, as humans, face only to be overwhelmed by its encompassing Oneness, the films produced by Studio Ghibli signify nature as a friendly neighbor. This Japanese relationality between nature and the human is illustrated lushly and with virtuosity in films such as *My Neighbor Totoro*, tapping into a rich and long-established system of aesthetics regarding landscape that is decidedly different from that put forth by Western metaphysical philosophy. Thematizing the interactive relation between nature and human beings can also be comprehended on a semiotic level in the sense that meaning takes place in the relationality itself between signifiers within any given system. This paper will explore the proposition that Studio Ghibli films foreground, through narrative techniques, a larger, more abstract philosophical investigation into relationality itself, whereas the Western Sublime se...\n\nLandscape design has an expansive realm that includes and converges over productive, functional as well as artistic spheres. Landscapes deal with both the ideas of nature as well as culture. The dynamism and variability of landscapes is often conveyed with a cultural purview through art. One of the mainstream mediums of viewing art is cinema wherein the cinematic grandiose has been largely expressed through both its built and natural visuals. This cinematic enigma makes the viewer interact with the social and intimate spaces portrayed through buildscapes and landscapes. The Studio Ghibli anime movies have had a wider and long lasting impact on contemporary cinema and its film-making style over the past few decades. Some of the most striking visuals in movies like Spirited away or Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind or Howl's moving castle feature landscapes embedded through historical and modern time frames. Landscapes depicted in Studio Ghibli have been represented through a wide array of textures, materials and surfaces that characterize nature as an extension of the human environment. Hayao Miyazaki, the creator of the Studio Ghibli anime movies has been inspired by plants and nature thus taking a substantial approach to ecology and environmental sensitivity in his movies. Miyazaki rejects the definition of the human as separate and distinct from nature and others and draws on notions of human interconnectedness with sentient and non-sentient beings. For him, the destruction of nature and the destruction of the human soul are the same (Bigelow 2005). Cinema allows a certain spectrum of liberty to its viewers and creators. Thus, landscapes and their elements attain meanings that communicate in various ways of theatrics as well as environmental sensibilities to their audience. This study delves into perceiving and understanding anime landscapes through their visual complexity and exploration of the human-nature relationship. Environmental concerns are among the major themes exhibited in the Studio Ghibli movies. Since landscapes are dynamic, the study looks at understanding the anime representation as an influencing factor in understanding environmental degradation. Does it present a better representation of reality or is a cognitive attempt to discern larger-than-life dichotomy of the spatial settings? The landscapes in Studio Ghibli anime are visually analyzed through the lens of human-nature relationship by classifying them into various parameters of place, space, character and metaphor to understand the environmental ethos they portray. An attempt is being made to study the aesthetic narratives of landscape visuals with ecological concerns set in variable time frames. The conventional ideas of landscape studies are being challenged through deciphering the creative visual imagery and their sense of connection as reflected in the Studio Ghibli anime movies."
