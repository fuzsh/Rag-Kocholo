        "text": "2004\n\nCity Locations\n\nCharleston, South Carolina\n\nLocation Types\n\nArchitectural, American, Colonial, House, Mansions, Victorian, Restaurant, Theatres\n\nLocation Styles\n\nAmericana/Anywhere America, Boat Style, Bungalow, Gothic/Victorian, Georgian/Southern, Luxury Hotel\n\nAbout The Notebook\n\nThe Notebook is a touching love story directed by Nick Cassavetes, based on the 1996 romantic novel by Nicholas Sparks. It revolves around the characters in the urgency of young, passionate romance and them as older people showing that passion and love know no age and time. It stars Ryan Gosling as Noah and Rachel McAdams as Allie, a young couple from South Carolina who fall in love in the 1940s.\n\nChances are youâve read the book or watched the 2004 American romantic drama adaptation of the novel. Perhaps, you even did both. If not, this guide highlights some of the best scenes in The Notebook (spoiler alert!) to give you a glimpse of the famous film. Weâve also included the popular The Notebook filming locations for fans to visit and experience and see Noah and Allieâs romantic story in a new light.\n\nThe movie starts in a modern-day nursing home when an elderly man (James Garner) reads a love story from an old notebook to an Alzheimerâs-stricken woman (Gena Rowlands). He narrates the first time Noah, a local country boy, and Allie, a 17-year-old heiress, met at the carnival on June 6th, 1940. Then it brings the viewers to the night of the carnival, where Noah falls in love at first sight with Allie.\n\nThe couple spends a beautiful summer together and falls in love. But her parents are against the relationship and donât approve of him because of his much lower socioeconomic status, calling him trash. Eventually, they break up, and Allie is sent to New York to focus on her studies. Devastated by their separation, Noah writes Allie a letter for a year, only to be intercepted by Allieâs mother.\n\nThe Notebook film delivers an emotional punch. It makes you happy and feels giddy, but it also elicits tears. Although the characters are flawed, you canât help but root for them and their unyielding love for each other.\n\nThe Notebook Locations\n\nThe novel was set in the beautiful waterfront town of New Bern, North Carolina, but The Notebook production takes place mainly in South Carolina. Much of the movie's plot revolves around Seabrook Island, a small resort community about half an hour from Charleston. However, the town was not used in the film.\n\nInstead, the Old Village of Mount Pleasant serves as the town of Seabrook Island, South Carolina. It is known for its historic homes, stately live oaks, and the original location of summer homes for the wealthy residents of Charleston. Its charming old neighborhood and old-school storefronts and houses create an ideal background for the filmâs pre- and post-World War II setting.\n\nThe movie was primarily filmed in Charleston, featuring many landmarks that have continued to receive more visitors since its release. The exterior shots of Boon Hall Plantation were used as Allieâs family summer home. Today, it offers guided tours for movie fans and guests who want to see the Georgian-designed mansion. For the interior shots, they used the Williams Mansion, formerly known as Calhoun Mansion, located at 14-16 Meeting Street in Charleston.\n\nSome of The Notebook locations were developed or changed for the film, while others are on private property. But there are also several places featured in the movie that you can visit anytime.\n\nAt the beginning of the film, Noah, set to convince Allie she should go out with him, goes to a movie theater with his friend, whose girlfriend Sara (Eve Kagan) is friends with Allie. So they set up a âcoincidence,â and all went to the cinema together.\n\nThe American Theater, where Noah and Allie go on a double date, is located at King Street in Charleston. It opened in 1942 as the premier movie house in the city, characterized by regal Art Deco architecture. Due to its timeless Holywood glamour, it has been featured in many films throughout the years.\n\nAlthough the building no longer operates as a public movie house, it now serves as a sophisticated event venue, featuring an 8,000-square-feet space for weddings, receptions, meetings, and corporate parties. It features a luxurious ballroom, an expansive lobby, a concessions area, and an intimate lounge with a bar. It also has a fully-equipped cinema for private film screenings and state-of-the-art audio-visual equipment.\n\nSince itâs located in Downtown Charleston, itâs easily accessible by public transportation. Several bus lines have routes that pass near the theater, including buses number 10, 11, 33, 40, 41, and XP2. It is also close to several bus stations, such as the King St, Transit Mall, Visitors Center, and Calhoun St bus stations.\n\nIf you want to visit The Notebook locations, one of the filming sites to tour around is the Cypress Gardens. It is featured in several boating scenes in the movie, including the part when Allie and Noah paddle through the swamp with tons of swans. Indeed, âItâs spectacular. Itâs like a dream,â just as Allie said.\n\nLocated about half an hour from downtown Charleston, the Cypress Gardens is a 175-acre swamp garden in Moncks Corner, South Carolina. It offers an array of nature adventures and provides a perfect setting for fun and relaxation. You can stroll miles of picturesque trails, relax in a greenhouse, go on a swamp boat ride, and soak in the spectacular view of the vast garden landscape. The Cypress Gardens has everything for adventure seekers, nature lovers, or anyone looking for an exciting family getaway. Besides its natural attractions, it also hosts parties and special celebrations with gorgeous venues suitable for your big day.\n\nIf you want to explore the gardens, the site is open seven days a week from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The fastest way to get there is by car, bus, or taxi. The bus companies that run services between Charleston and Cypress Gardens are the CARTA company and the Atlanta Tours Inc.\n\nNoahâs plantation house plays a crucial role in the story. He first introduces it to Allie one night as The Windsor Plantation, which was built in 1772. It was a gigantic rundown house that Noah planned to âbuy one day and fix it up.â When planning what they want for the mansion, Allie states, âI want a white house with blue shutters,â which youâll see later in the film years after they separated.\n\nThe house in this scene is actually a private property at the Martins Point Plantation. It is located on Wadmalaw Island, a small, quiet island in Charleston County, about half an hour from downtown Charleston. The Martins Point Plantation features a private boat ramp for kayak, canoe, and boat access to the Atlantic Ocean and the Wadmalaw River.\n\nInstead of using an abandoned house, the filmmakers masked the house's exterior and distressed it heavily to make it look old, abandoned, and rundown. Although Noah says it was built in 1772, the actual building was established in 1875.\n\nAfter the completion of Noahâs renovation project, the house looks much like what it does today. The filmmakers only added the blue shatters and a side porch to match the charactersâ vision for the house in the movie.\n\nThe first time Noah sees Allie years after their break-up is probably one of the heartbreaking scenarios for him. Heâs ecstatic to finally meet the love of his life, only to see her kissing another guy inside a restaurant. This scene where he looks through the restaurant window was filmed at a local restaurant in Charleston called High Cotton.\n\nHigh Cotton is a working restaurant on East Bay Street, one of Charlestonâs more popular and scenic thoroughfares. It is home to several historic buildings and numerous shops, boutiques, and restaurants that significantly contribute to the cityâs unique charm.\n\nYou can enjoy a happy hour or a luxury fine-dining experience at the restaurant and then explore the lines of shops around the street. Besides delicious food, High Cotton offers live music in this inviting and welcoming space.\n\nRemember the scene when Allieâs parents call the police because itâs already 2 a.m. and sheâs still not home? Lost track of time, Noah and Allie rush back to her house, where the police and her parents are anxiously waiting. Unhappy about her daughter, Anne Hamilton (Joan Allen) tells Allie not to see Noah anymore. She calls him a âtrash, trash, trash,â not meant for her daughter because heâs a laborer and a woodworker.\n\nThis and other scenes inside Hamiltonâs summer home, including the part when Allie is running down the staircase the following morning, were filmed in Williams Mansion, colloquially referred to as the Calhoun Mansion in the past. It was named after the mansionâs original owner, George Walton Williams. He rose from anonymity as the son of a farmer in Northern Georgia to one of the late 19th-century Charlestonâs greatest entrepreneurs.\n\nThe mansion was completed in 1878 and was described as a Magnificent Mansion. It was the most complete private home in the South and the cityâs largest residence, spanning 24,000 square feet. Today, it is open for tours, allowing movie fans to relive the scenes in The Notebook and see the mansion's spectacular furniture and interior architecture.\n\nDue to the pandemic, this Victorian house is temporarily closed today. However, you can still check out the exterior of the building. You can take bus 211 to get to the mansion, which stops at the Broad St/ Meeting St station."
