Thirty miles north of New York City, the property is the former Pocantico Hills and Rockwood Hall country estates of John D. Rockefeller family and William Rockefeller. Since 1983, the Rockefeller Family has generously donated over 1771 acres to the State of New York to safeguard these lands for present and future generations. Managed by New York State Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation, the Preserve is open to the public year-round, sunrise to sunset.\n\nThe trails of the Preserve are crushed stone carriage roads laid out by John D. Rockefeller Sr. and Jr. in the first half of the 20th century. Designed to complement the landscape, the 45 miles of scenic carriage roads are wide and easy to walk. Popular for walking, riding, jogging, and carriage driving, combinations of trails lead through varied landscapes and past natural and historical features, such as Swan Lake, the Pocantico River with its wood and stone bridges, gurgling streams, colonial stone walls and rock outcroppings. Trail maps of the carriage roads are available at the Preserve Office.\n\nThe Preserve is primarily hardwood forest dominated by huge oak, tulip poplar, maple, and beech trees. The forests, fields, streams, and wetlands support a high diversity of native species of resident and migratory birds, mammals, insects, amphibians, reptiles, fish and aquatic species, some of which are in decline and now uncommon in Westchester County. With 202 recorded species of birds and its Important Bird Area designation by the National Audubon Society, the Preserve is a must-visit area for birders. Over 100 species of native wild bees frequent spring and summer wildflowers. In the fall, Monarch butterflies stop to feed and lay eggs during their southward migration. An on-going environmental stewardship is underway to favor native biological diversity.\n\nRockwood Hall is a distinct bucolic section of the Preserve with commanding views of the Hudson River and Palisade Cliffs. Between 1886 and 1922, William Rockefeller's estate was 1000 acres with a 202-room mansion, a working farm, and a landscape designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, father of American landscape design. While the house and buildings are now gone, massive rock walls around the former house site and extensive grassy fields with magnificent specimen trees harken back to the heyday of the estate during the gilded age.\n\nWhile in the preserve, stop in the Preserve's Gallery by the entrance where rotating exhibits feature contemporary art and natural history exhibits. In the entrance courtyard between the Gallery and Preserve office is the Tree Peony Garden.\n\nPlease Note: Bicycles, mechanized vehicles, drones, metal detectors, snowmobiling, camping, and open fires are strictly prohibited. Dogs must be leashed.\n\nPermits Required:\n\nOrganized running groups with over 7 people\n\nGeocaching\n\nScientific research\n\nFilm shoots\n\nFishing\n\nEquestrian\n\nVolunteer Opportunites\n\nFrom NYC by train: Metro North Hudson Line to the Tarrytown Station.

Pets are to be supervised at all times and either be crated or on a leash not more than 6-feet in length. Proof of rabies inoculation shall be produced if requested by staff. Pets are not permitted in playgrounds, buildings, golf courses, boardwalks, pools and spray-grounds or guarded beaches (this does not apply to service animals).\n\nHighlights of Rockefeller State Park Preserve:\n\nDespite being less than an hour from Manhattan, the park's wooded valleys still offer the peace and quiet described two hundred years ago by Washington Irving in The Legend of Sleepy Hollow. He wrote, \"Not far from (Tarrytown), perhaps about two miles, there is a little valley, or rather lap of land, among high hills, which is one of the quietest places in the whole world. A small brook glides through it, with just murmur enough to lull one to repose; and the occasional whistle of a quail, or tapping of a woodpecker, is almost the only sound that ever breaks in upon the uniform tranquility.\"\n\nRSPP encompasses forested hills and valleys cut by the Pocantico River and several streams along with a pastoral landscape of hayfields and pastures. The beech-maple, oak-hickory, and mixed hardwood forests contain towering trees, some over 150- 200 years old. Hemlocks can be found at the base of the cool slopes along the 13 Bridges and Witches Spring Trails. These forests are rich in wildlife that nest and feed in old trees with snags and hollows, such as bluebirds, owls, woodpeckers, wood ducks, and flying squirrels.\n\nTo highlight its value as natural area, Rockefeller is designated by the State as a \"Park-Preserve.\" Park preservation areas identify and conserve and protect portions of state parks that possess outstanding ecological values, including assemblages of flora and fauna that are unique or rare in the state. A park preserve allows passive recreation use within the park.\n\nMixed flocks of warblers pass through in waves during the spring and fall, leading one birder to call the park \"warbler heaven.\" Over 34 species of warblers have been recoded here, including two uncommon species for the Hudson Valley, the Kentucky and worm-eating warblers; the latter nests on the ground in the deep forests of the park.\n\nSwan Lake, in addition to being extremely scenic, has a fragrant diversity of shoreline wildflowers, such as swamp azalea, tall meadow rue, sweet pepperbush, and swamp milkweed, and rafts of fragrant water lilies. The lake attracts diverse waterfowl including migrating buffleheads, hooded mergansers, and diverse waterfowl, including the occasional loon.\n\nLook and listen for these birds at our Park:\n\nBald Eagle - winter; over Hudson River from Rockwood Hall\n\nBufflehead Duck - fall; on the lake\n\nCedar Waxwing - fall; feeds on fruits and berries\n\nEastern Bluebird - nest in the park throughout most of the year \\\n\nPilated Woodpecker - year-round; often heard near visitor center\n\nVeery - common spring migrant; breeds in the preserve\n\nWhite-throated Sparrow - fall, winter and spring\n\nYellow Warbler - spring and summer; nests near streams\n\nKentucky Warbler - annual visitors\n\nHairy Woodpecker - year round\n\nRed-eyed Vireo - summer\n\nLouisiana Water Thrush - summer; requires fast-moving streams in forests\n\nWorm-eating warbler - summer; nests on the ground\n\nWood Thrush - spring and summer - haunting call, nesting\n\nIndigo Bunting -summer; nests near parking lot and fields\n\nEveryone is a Steward: Be a Rockefeller State Park Preserve Hero!\n\nKnow the rules and concerns for the area you'll be visiting.\n\nPreserve the past: examine, but do not touch, cultural or historic structures and artifacts.\n\nRespect other visitors and their experience.

Warn people when you are planning to pass.\n\nRespect wildlife and observe from a distance\n\nUse extra caution when using headphones. You may not be able to hear warnings.\n\nDon't litter.\n\nHike on established, durable trails.\n\nFor more information, please read our Trail Tips!\n\nAsk a Naturalist!\n\nQ: What is the black bird with the long neck sitting on the log in the lake?\n\nA: That is a cormorant, a fish eating bird species. Cormorants stop to dive for the fish in Swan Lake during their annual migration. They spread their wings to dry out after swimming, because they do not have oil on their wings like ducks do.\n\nQ: Can you see the Hudson River from the Park?\n\nA: Yes, there are spectacular views of the Hudson River and Palisades from the hilltop at Rockwood Hall. This is also a good place to view bald eagles in the winter.\n\nQ: Are there fish in the lake and rivers?\n\nA: The warm waters of Swan Lake support large-mouth bass, crappie, pumpkinseeds, bluegills, and bullhead catfish. Pocantico River is habitat for caddis fly larvae, which are the favorite food of the stocked brown trout. Trout fishing season is from April 1 to October 15. In SwanLake, fishing season runs from the third Saturday in June to November 30. Fishing Guidelines\n\nQ: Do I have to worry about ticks?\n\nA: RSPP carriage roads serve as wide trails so visitors do not brush against tall grass and brush, the habitat of ticks. Over 55 miles of carriage roads enable visitors to safely and easily access most parts of the park-preserve. However, you should still check your skin and clothing for ticks after being outdoors. Showering soon after being outdoors gives you an opportunity for a full body tick check and can help wash off unattached ticks. If you find a tick, you should remove it and speak with you doctor if any signs of illness occur.\n\nQ: What is the vine with the mottled turquoise blue berries?\n\nA: It is Porcelainberry (Ampelopsis brevipedunculata), an ornamental vine with grape-like leaves that was introduced to the US from northeast Asia in 1870. Spread by birds, it is now very abundant and forms thick walls of vines draped on trees in the park and along Westchester parkways. It is considered to be an invasive species that outcompetes many native wildflowers, trees and shrubs.\n\nMore Interesting Facts about Rockefeller State Park Preserve:\n\nFolklore:\n\nButtermilk Hill, a high rocky ridge at the northeastern part of the preserve, is said to get its name from the turbulent period of the American Revolutionary War, when local farmers hid their dairy cattle on the ridge to protect them from marauding soldiers. The hill is referred to in an adapted Irish song:\n\nHere I sit on Buttermilk Hill,\n\nWho should blame me cry my fill?\n\nAnd every tear would work a mill,\n\nJohnny has gone for a soldier.\n\nFlora:\n\nRockefeller State Park Preserve boasts 1,775 acres of forests, fields, a lake, and wetlands, including nearly 260 acres of Oak-Tulip Tree Forest, a vulnerable habitat type in New York State.\n\nRockefeller is home to at least twelve endangered plant species. Many of these support endangered pollinators and threatened grassland wildlife.\n\nThe Big Tree Trail is part of the Old Growth Forest Network. The forest in this part of the park dates back to at least 1860 and is characterized by towering tulip trees as tall as 157 ft tall.\n\nOn Witch's Spring trail, look out for New York State's tallest Black Oak tree at 132.1 ft tall, and the state's tallest White Oak tree, at 130.2 ft tall. On Pocantico River trail, you can find the state's tallest Mockernut Hickory and Scarlet Oak trees, at 120.3 and 119.9 ft tall respectively. All trees measured by the Eastern Native Tree Society as of 2021.\n\nFerns are a conspicuous part of the flora in RSPP. Most ferns prefer moist shaded areas, but a few, such as hay-scented fern, grow in open sunny areas on relatively dry soil, and the marginal woodfern is found in crevices on dry rocks. To date, 22 species of ferns and fern allies, fern-like seedless plants, have been found in the Preserve. Pocantico River Trail, Brothers' Path, 13 Bridges, and Eagle Hill Trails support the greatest diversity of ferns in the preserve."
