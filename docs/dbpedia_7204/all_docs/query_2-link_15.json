        "text": "Annie Proulx situates her short story, Brokeback Mountain, in rural America, and specifically Wyoming, between the tumultuous 1963 and 1983. The mountainous landscape that suggests physical harm and disfigurement, the social tensions of the era, the rigid gender stereotypes, and the myth of the cowboy are essential themes in Proulx’s story and their perception can offer an insight on the main issues portrayed through her narrative. In this paper, I will depict both the narrative and the visual techniques that elevate Brokeback Mountain into an incendiary and against normative structures genre. The activism of the examined era, the cultural myths and the pop culture, the emergent Proulxian cowboy are only some of the aspects to be explored in order to question the stereotypical rural American environment.\n\nIn this article I explore the broad appeal of one recent and unusual cinematic revival of an orthodox romantic love narrative. According to the cultural historian David Shumway, a new intimacy paradigm for couples, and not the older romantic love paradigm, accounts for the growth in support for gay marriage. Instead I argue it is romantic love, intensified and rewritten, that is still capable of bestowing unique cultural authority. The film’s reception recalls for us the rebellious social and political power of romantic love, its traditional transgressions against patriarchal control of familial alliances and reproduction, and its fervent individualism. In so doing, the film invigorates romantic love as a political force both in its presentation of non-heterosexual men, but also in its spur to cultural activism through online forums. I look in particular at one forum and its communal articulation of an emotional condition called “Brokeback Mountain Fever,” a curious amalgam of longing and grief. Through the forum, the film points to a communal participation in the effects of traditional romantic love stories, enabled by new forms of sociability on the internet. Finally, I consider how the film might help us to understand our current situation in the midst of an often unacknowledged tension between not only love and marriage, but also romantic love and intimacy.\n\nMale homosexuality has been historically separated from the notion of traditional hegemonic masculinity yet the film Brokeback Mountain (2005) casts its male love story in a fiercely masculine light. This paper intends to examine how two protagonists in the film (Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist) have been individually and mutually constructing their masculine identities through rediscovering their inner selves and enlivening the dormant parts of their masculinity from a constructionist perspective. Three crucial elements contributing to such identity construction are investigated: nature, gender, and parenthood. Each element is explored based on its relevant text, subtext, intertextuality, and context; interwoven with the analysis of film techniques, cultural theory and literacy/film criticism. First, nature endows men with the power to dominate and control their environment and is employed heavily throughout this film to illustrate the characters' desire to attain hegemonic masculinity. Secondly, the discussion of gender is developed on the binary of masculinity and femininity. The aspect of masculinity is explored in the framework of Judith Butler’s gender performativity (1990) while the aspect of femininity is analyzed within the heterosexual context as a destructive power to masculinity. The third aspect looks into how characters internalize the influence of parenthood—centering on fatherhood—in the early construction of their masculine identities. All of these elements in turn shape the nature of the relationship between these men into one that is shaped by, and in turn redefines, the paradigms of dominant masculinity.\n\nThis paper, extracted from a chapter of the author’s completed research paper entitled ‘Narcissism in Male Sexuality: Lan Yu, Crystal Boys and Brokeback Mountain’, aims to complicate the analysis of and imagined correspondence between narcissism and male sexuality. Starting from and trajecting beyond Freudian psychoanalysis, the author attempts to deconstruct the presumed definitions of narcissism and male sexuality in order to provide another perspective on the psycho-sexual politics in the representations of such in both Chinese and Western queer literature and cinema. First, the definitions of narcissism as illustrated in Sigmund Freud's ‘On Narcissism’ (1915) will be briefly introduced and compared with other works of literature and art expressing a similar motif, such as Ovid's Metamorphosis, William Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, Salvador Dali's Metamorphosis of Narcissus, Eric Stenbock Stanislaus's Narcissus as well as other sources from western psychoanalytic discourses, at the outset problematizing the Freudian narcissism yet without providing a concrete redefinition. Next, Annie Proulx's popular American short story Brokeback Mountain (2006), as one of the three chosen texts, will be analyzed. The analytic focus is upon the literary version, while occasionally the screen version Ang Lee's film Brokeback Mountain (2005) has also been addressed and discussed intertextually. By examining the sexual and emotional attachment between the male characters in these texts, a more vivid and diverse picture of narcissism and male sexuality will be revealed. The author suggests the representations of homosexuality between the male protagonists are in fact not genuinely ‘homosexual’, but a complicated and manifold narcissistic desire, which allows the story to attract and arouse a varied reader and audience identification. Last, this paper further postulates the vicissitudes of sexual drives originating from the ambiguous 'narcissistic' desire represented in the texts, to subvert the traditional ideas of dichotomous sexuality, gay and lesbian studies, and even queer theory.\n\nThis chapter argues that it is cloth's relationship with a body that renders it erotic: it is the touch of textile on skin (or its noted absence) that alerts, awakens, enervates and stimulates both the imagination and the physical entity. And by the same token, it is how bodies (again present or absent) stain, enliven or render static the fabric – of shirts, swaddling, sheets, shrouds, and the like – that creates the simultaneous mesmeric and repulsed erotic charge that this essay seeks. Using a range of cultural and historical references, the essay conjures a narrative that links cloth to the sensational and the internalized, to memory and mourning, the sacred and the sublime, and ultimately to the ritualized moments and mythologies of desire and death. Just as pins mend and protect, they pierce, prick and punish: so too, the erotic cloth is both ecstatic and agonized, abject and engorged, traumatized and tumescent."
