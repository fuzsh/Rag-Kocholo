He was one of the founding members of the Center for Independent Living in Berkeley, the first group of its kind in the world dedicated to advocate for the rights of disabled people. Berkeley is the birthplace of the disability movement, and the work started by Hale and others in the 1970's forever changed how the world looks at disability. (From IMDB)\n\nA Fantastic Woman | Directed by SEBASTIÁN LELIO\n\n\"A FANTASTIC WOMAN is the story of Marina, a waitress and singer, and Orlando, an older man, who are in love and planning for the future.

Academy Award Winner - Best Foreign Language Film 2018.\n\n13th | Directed by Ava DuVernay\n\nAn in-depth look at the prison system in the United States and how it reveals the nation's history of racial inequality. \" More African-American men are incarcerated, or on probation or parole, than were enslaved in 1850, and the United States, which accounts for 5% of the world’s population, counts nearly a quarter of the world's incarcerated people.\" Time Magazine\n\nHidden Figures | Directed by Theodore Melfi - Suggested by freshman Erik Partida\n\n\"HIDDEN FIGURES is the incredible untold story of Katherine G. Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe)-brilliant African-American women working at NASA, who served as the brains behind one of the greatest operations in history: the launch of astronaut John Glenn into orbit, a stunning achievement that restored the nation's confidence, turned around the Space Race, and galvanized the world. The visionary trio crossed all gender and race lines to inspire generations to dream big.\" Rotten Tomatoes\n\nDolores |Directed by Peter Bratt\n\nThis documentary about Dolores Huerta is among the most important, yet least known, activists in American history. An equal partner in co-founding the first farm workers unions with Cesar Chavez, her enormous contributions have gone largely unrecognized. Dolores tirelessly led the fight for racial and labor justice alongside Chavez, becoming one of the most defiant feminists of the twentieth century—and she continues the fight to this day, at 87.\n\nAlmost Sunrise | Filmaker Michael Collins\n\nThe documentary follows two Iraq veterans, Tom Voss and Anthony Anderson, who struggle with depression upon returning home from service. Fearful of succumbing to the epidemic of veteran suicide, they seek a lifeline and embark on a 2,700-mile walk across America as a way to confront their inner pain.\n\nThe film captures an intimate portrait of two friends suffering from the unseen wounds of war as they discover an unlikely treatment: the restorative power of silence and meditation.\n\nRed State | Directed by Danielle Andersen and Jonathan Nelson\n\nRight now, no matter where you stand on the political spectrum, it would be natural to want to scream. Filmmakers Danielle Andersen and Jonathan Nelson explore the anger and anxiety of the current moment in two minutes.
