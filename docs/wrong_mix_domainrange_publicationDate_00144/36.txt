Novels

by Shimshon Bichler and Jonathan Nitzan

The study of society today is divided into different disciplines – the so-called social sciences – a division that fractures our consciousness into disconnected bits and pieces. Literature does the very opposite: it brings things together, offering glimpses into the enfolded, hologramic nature of society. Here are some of the novels that helped us understand this hologramic enfoldment from different angles. They are all worth reading.

Impressive list! At the rate of a novel a month, that’s around 17 years of reading.

Arithmetic aside, reading is a joy, not a chore.

My arithmetic was not meant to imply that reading novels was a chore. In fact, I have selected many novels from one of your older lists.

I can think of some more great novels that aid the in the production of a hologramic view of society:

1. Achebe, Chinua. 1958. Things Fall Apart.

2. Egan, Jennifer. 2010. A Visit from the Goon Squad.

3. Farrell, J. G.. 1970. Troubles.

4. Krasznahorkai, László. 1985. [2012]. Sátántangó. Translated by George Szirtes.

5. McCoy, Horace. 1935. They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?

6. Toole, John Kennedy. 1980. A Confederacy of Dunces.

Of course not. My answer was a tongue-in-cheek clarification for others….

And thank you for the additional suggestions!

Bulgakov, Mikhail Afanas evich. 1968. The Heart of a Dog. Translated with an introduction by Michael Glenny. 1st ed. New York: Harcourt Brace & Wolff.

Just finished this. It’s short but packs a punch! I still have a personal preference for Master and Margarita, but Heart of a Dog is also giving a magical picture of a society mid-fever.

Two others I have read recently, which are not on this list but of course would recommend:

The Power and the Glory, Graham Greene

The Moviegoer, Walker Percy

I suspect either or both may add a perspective not yet strongly represented, though I don’t know. Just going by the titles I have read which are more than a few.
