Avogadro Corp by William Hertling is proof that I intend to review books of all kinds here — not just the 5/5s.

This book is based on quite an interesting premise, a small twist on the AI apocalypse that has been done many times in years past, and will continue to repeat in years to come.

In this novel, the AI comes in the form of a rogue (and selfish) mail server that only wants to ensure it’s own growth and existence.

While it is no “I, Robot’ or “Neuromancer”, Avogadro Corp excels in one particular category — it provides a clear, plausible description of the cloud companies we deal with today and their data centers. Not only that, but the premise behind the AI’s creation is quite reasonable, and seems more possible given it’s boundary of ‘soft AI’. The beginning of the book is very strong, a great introduction to both the novel idea, and the real-world subject matter it describes.

Unfortunately from there, the book turns more spy-thriller with AI undertones, and while the AI/geek/programmer facts all check out, the spy-thriller portions don’t fully grab your attention. Dan Brown’s Digital Fortress comes to mind as a better example of that.

The crowning glory of this book comes from the fact that Google’s new Smart Replies option certainly takes a couple of hints from this novel. What could go wrong with allowing a machine learning algorithm to edit your emails?

Decision

Make no mistake, this is by no means a bad book, it’s well written and an easy read. The premise is interesting, but not executed on as well as it could have been. In a field with tough competition, it just doesn’t stand out.

In it’s stead, I would recommend:

Neuromancer — William Gibson

Caves of Steel — Isaac Asimov
