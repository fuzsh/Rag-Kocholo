To buy, auction, sell or consign your Isaac Asimov Caves of Steel 1954 1st edition signed that is for sale, please email your description and photos to [email protected] of Nate D. Sanders Auctions (http://www.NateDSanders.com).\n\nSell Your Isaac Asimov Caves of Steel 1954 1st Edition Signed\n\nThe Caves of Steel is a science fiction novel by American writer Isaac Asimov. It is a detective story and illustrates an idea Asimov advocated, that science fiction can be applied to any literary genre, rather than just being a limited genre in itself.\n\nBelow is a recent realized price for an Isaac Asimov Caves of Steel 1954 1st edition signed item. We at Nate D. Sanders Auctions can obtain up to this amount or more for you:\n\nIsaac Asimov Caves of Steel 1954 1st Edition Signed. Sold for over $5,000.\n\nThe following are some similar items we have sold:\n\nGutenberg Bible Leaf 193 Chronicles of Old Testament\n\nScarce leaf from the Gutenberg Bible, one of the earliest major books printed from moveable metal type, the invention that ushered in the Age of Enlightenment by democratizing knowledge through mass production of literature. Printed by Johannes Gutenberg in Mainz, Germany from 1450-1455, less than 50 complete or near-complete copies of the Gutenberg Bible are now extant, with nearly all those housed in public institutions. Singular leaves are also scarce, with the leaf presented here having been acquired by bookseller Gabriel Wells, whose purchase of an incomplete Bible in 1920 gave way to selling the individual leaves alongside an essay by A. Edward Newton entitled “A Noble Fragment”. Leaf is number 193 of the full Latin Bible, with the recto being the Prologue to 1 Chronicles of the Old Testament, and the verso the first part of Chapter 1 of 1 Chronicles. Each page features two columns of 42 lines in dark black Gothic type, accented by red and blue rubrication. Each copy of the Gutenberg Bible differs in its rubrication and illumination, with buyers at the time deciding upon these embellishments after the Bible was printed. The six-line rubricated letters of this leaf were likely added later, restored to match the original style. Leaf measures 11.125″ x 15.375″, bound on edge to portfolio measuring 11.75″ x 16″. Paper quality is still bright with very little foxing or discoloration compared to other examples. A stunning example from the book that changed the course of history. Sold for $136,500.\n\nCharles Darwin On the Origin of Species 1st Edition\n\nFirst edition, first printing of “On the Origin of Species” by Charles Darwin, one of the most important books in the scientific canon. London: John Murray, 1859. In this revolutionary book that upended man’s own view of himself, Darwin posits natural selection as the engine driving species’ evolution, an argument so persuasive that even 19th century religious leaders adjusted their teachings to allow for evolution to work in concert with divine planning. Its importance has only grown in the 150+ years since publication, with Freeman concluding it to be “the most important biological book ever written”. First released on 24 November 1859, its scarcity nearly matches its importance, with the first printing consisting of only 1,250 copies, and the number of extant copies now significantly fewer.\n\nAll first printing points are present, including original binding, variant B, title page with copyright information on verso, Table of Contents (pages v-ix) with binder instructions to verso, complete pages 1-502, and folding table present between pages 116-117. Bound in publisher’s full green boards, stamped and lettered in gilt. Overall in very good condition; ads at back of volume have been removed as has half-title page, and endpapers have been replaced. Volume is rebacked using morocco, with original spine laid down. Some shelf wear to boards. Light foxing throughout book, with some chipping, small closed tears with repairs to a few pages, and a few dogeared pages. One small mark on page 109, otherwise no internal writing or marks. Housed in a custom quarter-leather clamshell box. Overall in very good condition, a handsome, presentable copy of this scarce first printing. Sold for $68,250.\n\nExceedingly Rare First Printing Dusjacket of ”The Great Gatsby” — Much More Rare Than the Legendary Novel It Houses\n\nRare first edition, first printing of one of the most desired books in the history of literature, F. Scott Fitzgerald’s ”The Great Gatsby,” published by Charles Scribner’s Sons: New York: 1925, with the nearly impossible to find first printing dustjacket. Every point is present: 1925 is printed on title page; Charles Scribner’s Sons logo appears on the copyright page with no subsequent printing statements; ”chatter” appears on page 60; ”northern” appears on page 119; ”it’s” is printed on line 16 of page 165; ”sick in tired” is found on page 205; ”Union Street station” is mistyped on line 7-8 of page 211. Bound in dark green cloth boards with title and author’s name blind-stamped to front board and gilt lettering to spine. Francis Cugat’s scarce original unrestored first printing dustjacket has the lowercase ”j” in ”jay Gatsby” on the back panel hand-corrected in ink. Sold for $50,000.\n\n”Gone With the Wind” Cast Signed Novel — Signed by 12, Including Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, Olivia de Havilland, Leslie Howard & Hattie McDaniel — With PSA/DNA COA\n\nVery rare ”Gone With the Wind” novel signed by the cast. New York: The MacMillan Co., 1938, later edition. Novel is signed on the front endpapers by the leading cast members: Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, Olivia de Havilland, Leslie Howard, Hattie McDaniel, Ona Munson, Evelyn Keyes, Ann Rutherford, Thomas Mitchell, Carroll Nye, Oscar Polk, and unit manager William J. Scully. Underneath their signatures are the names of their ”Gone With the Wind” characters, written in another hand.

Toning to signature page, otherwise very good. With PSA/DNA for all actor’s signatures. Sold for $15,000.\n\nJames Joyce Autograph and an Henri Matisse Autograph in a Scarce Limited Edition of “Ulysses”\n\nScarce copy of “Ulysses” rare book by James Joyce, illustrated by Henri Matisse. New York: The Limited Editions Club: 1935. Number 297 of a limited edition run of 1500 copies. One of only 250 such copies signed by both Joyce and Matisse. Boldly signed by the author and illustrator on limitation page. Full brown buckram boards with gilt embossing to front cover and backstrip. Large octavo measures 9″ x 11.5″. Volume runs 420pp. with an introduction by Stuart Gilbert and illustrations by Henri Matisse including 20 reproductions of preliminary drawings and six original soft-ground etchings. In 1935 George Macy, founder of the fledgling Limited Editions Club, made the bold decision to commission Matisse to illustrate Joyce’s controversial and previously banned masterpiece, “Ulysses.” Matisse, understanding that Joyce’s work parodied the original eighteen episodes of the “Odyssey,” chose to create his 26 full-page illustrations as actual illustrations of Homer’s original work. Matisse later signed all 1500 of Macy’s limited edition, however, as legend has it, when Joyce realized that Matisse had been working from Homer’s “Odyssey” rather than his novel, he refused to sign any more than the 250 copies he had already signed making this double-signed edition exceedingly rare. Rare book without original slipcase, else fine condition. Sold for $14,460.\n\nErnest Hemingway Signed First Limited Edition of ”A Farewell to Arms” — Scarce in Original Slipcase\n\nErnest Hemingway signed limited first edition of his post-WWI classic, ”A Farewell to Arms”, housed in its original limited edition slipcase, with numbers matching.

New York: Alfred A. Knopf: 1934. First edition, first printing with red variant dust jacket with front flap reviews. Boldly inscribed, “For Dan and Peggy / with my best regards / Dashiell Hammett / New York / Sept. 23, 1934.” A rare copy of Hammett’s hardboiled detective novel which became the basis for the successful film series starring William Powell and Myrna Loy. Minor fading and soiling to decorative green cloth boards (oxidation of green dye that was used in first edition printings has resulted in light green cloth boards). Moderate wear to unclipped dust jacket. Overall, very good condition. Sold for $9,600.\n\nVery Nice Signed Copy of Mark Twain ‘s Tom Sawyer\n\nExcellent signed copy of Mark Twain’s “Tom Sawyer,” dated 10 May 1899. Inscribed on front free endpaper: “Truly Yours Mark Twain / May 10, 1899.” London: Chatto and Windus: 1899. A later edition of the classic that became the wellspring of American literary fiction, with wood-engraved illustrations by True Williams. In this quintessentially American novel, Twain introduces Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn and their mischievous adventures in antebellum Missouri.

Foxing and toning throughout, else good condition. Sold for $4,800.\n\nBram Stoker Signed “Dracula” 1910\n\nBram Stoker signed copy of “Dracula.” London: Constable: 1904. Boldly inscribed to front free endpaper, “F. G. Haley from Bram Stoker 27/1/10.” Francis George Haley served as the Librarian of the “Gladstone Liberal Library.” As a known benefactor of the Liberal party, Stoker likely met Haley on many occasions and signed this volume just two years prior to his own death.

Sometimes called the “dean of science fiction writers”, he was among the first to emphasize scientific accuracy in his fiction, and was thus a pioneer of the subgenre of hard science fiction. His published works, both fiction and non-fiction, express admiration for competence and emphasize the value of critical thinking. His plots often posed provocative situations which challenged conventional social mores. His work continues to have an influence on the science-fiction genre, and on modern culture more generally. Stranger in a Strange Land is a 1961 science fiction novel by American author Robert A. Heinlein. It tells the story of Valentine Michael Smith, a human who comes to Earth in early adulthood after being born on the planet Mars and raised by Martians, and explores his interaction with and eventual transformation of Terran culture.\n\nFirst edition, first printing of “Stranger in a Strange Land” by Robert Heinlein, the 1962 Hugo award winning book and the first science fiction novel to land on the New York Times bestseller list. New York: G.P. Putnam’s Sons, 1961. With first printing point “c22” on page 408 and housed in original dust jacket showing price of $4.50. Some chipping with tape repair to jacket, in very good condition. Bound in green boards with top edge green, book is nicely bound with only light shelf wear, and no internal markings. Very good to near fine condition. Sold for $1,900.\n\nConsign your Isaac Asimov Caves of Steel 1954 1st edition signed at Nate D. Sanders Auctions.
