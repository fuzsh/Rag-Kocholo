        "text": "Isaac Asimov's Robot series - from the iconic collection I, Robot to four classic novels - contains some of the most influential works in the history of science fiction. Establishing and testing the Three Laws of Robotics, they continue to shape the understanding and design of artificial intelligence to this day.\n\nIn the vast, domed cities of Earth, artificial intelligence is strictly controlled; in the distant Outer Worlds, colonists and robots live side by side.\n\nA Spacer ambassador is found dead and detective Elijah Baley is assigned to find the killer. But with relations between the two cultures in the balance, the Spacers insist that he work with a partner of their choosing - a robot partner, R. Daneel Olivaw.\n\nBaley has never seen a robot like Daneel before - almost indistinguishable from a human - and soon, though the Three Laws of Robotics should render the crime impossible, Baley's partner becomes his prime suspect.\n\nIn this hard, technological adventure, Asimov takes us on a thrilling journey into a new, post-apocalyptic world. The action is top-notch, making The Caves of Steel one of the best apocalyptic thrillers of our time.\n\nFor fans of Arthur C. Clarke (Childhood's End), Frank Herbert (Dune), Dan Simmons (Hyperion), Robert A. Heinlein (Double Star), and Stanley Kubrick (Dr Strangelove or).\n\nHarperCollins 2024"
