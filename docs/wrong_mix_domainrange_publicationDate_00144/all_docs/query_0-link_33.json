Literature does the very opposite: it brings things together, offering glimpses into the enfolded, hologramic nature of society. Here are some of the novels that helped us understand this hologramic enfoldment from different angles. They are all worth reading.\n\n***\n\nAdelstein, Jake. 2009. Tokyo Vice.

At the rate of a novel a month, that’s around 17 years of reading.\n\nArithmetic aside, reading is a joy, not a chore.\n\nMy arithmetic was not meant to imply that reading novels was a chore. In fact, I have selected many novels from one of your older lists.\n\nI can think of some more great novels that aid the in the production of a hologramic view of society:\n\n1. Achebe, Chinua. 1958. Things Fall Apart.\n\n2. Egan, Jennifer. 2010. A Visit from the Goon Squad.\n\n3. Farrell, J. G.. 1970. Troubles.\n\n4. Krasznahorkai, László. 1985. [2012]. Sátántangó. Translated by George Szirtes.\n\n5. McCoy, Horace. 1935. They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?\n\n6. Toole, John Kennedy. 1980. A Confederacy of Dunces.\n\nThis reply was modified 2 years, 9 months ago by jmc.\n\nThis reply was modified 2 years, 9 months ago by jmc.\n\nMy arithmetic was not meant to imply that reading novels was a chore.\n\nOf course not. My answer was a tongue-in-cheek clarification for others….\n\nAnd thank you for the additional suggestions!\n\nBulgakov, Mikhail Afanas evich. 1968. The Heart of a Dog. Translated with an introduction by Michael Glenny. 1st ed. New York: Harcourt Brace & Wolff.\n\nJust finished this. It’s short but packs a punch! I still have a personal preference for Master and Margarita, but Heart of a Dog is also giving a magical picture of a society mid-fever.\n\nTwo others I have read recently, which are not on this list but of course would recommend:\n\nThe Power and the Glory, Graham Greene\n\nThe Moviegoer, Walker Percy\n\nI suspect either or both may add a perspective not yet strongly represented, though I don’t know. Just going by the titles I have read which are more than a few.\n\nThis reply was modified 1 year, 5 months ago by Scott Laing.\n\nViewing 4 reply threads\n\nYou must be logged in to reply to this topic.\n\nLog In\n\nUsername:\n\nPassword:\n\nKeep me signed in"
