        "text": "American screenwriter, director and producer\n\nAkiva Goldsman (born July 7, 1962) is an American filmmaker.\n\nGoldsman's filmography as a screenwriter includes The Client; Batman Forever and its sequel Batman & Robin; I, Robot; I Am Legend; Cinderella Man, and numerous rewrites that are both credited and uncredited. He also wrote more than a dozen episodes for the science fiction television series Fringe.\n\nIn 2002, Goldsman received the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay and the Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay for the 2001 film A Beautiful Mind, which also won the Academy Award for Best Picture. In 2006, Goldsman re-teamed with A Beautiful Mind director Ron Howard to adapt Dan Brown's novel The Da Vinci Code for Howard's film. He also wrote the screenplay for its 2009 sequel Angels & Demons.\n\nGoldsman is also known for co-developing the DC Comics TV series Titans and the Paramount+ series Star Trek: Picard, a sequel to Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek: Nemesis. He is also the co-creator of Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, a prequel to Star Trek: The Original Series.\n\nGoldsman was born in New York City to Jewish parents and raised in Brooklyn Heights. His parents, Tev Goldsman and Mira Rothenberg, were both clinical child psychologists who ran a group home for emotionally disturbed children.[1] He graduated from Saint Ann's School, also in Brooklyn Heights, where he says he made many friends with whom he later worked in the entertainment industry. He received his bachelor's degree from Wesleyan University and attended the graduate fiction-writing program at New York University.\n\nGoldsman has a production company at Warner Bros. named Weed Road Pictures.[2]\n\nHe produced the Universal Pictures feature Lone Survivor, from writer/director Peter Berg, based on the book Lone Survivor: The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of SEAL Team 10 by Marcus Luttrell. It tells the story of Luttrell's Navy SEAL team in 2005 Afghanistan, on a mission to kill a terrorist leader. It starred Mark Wahlberg, Emile Hirsch, Ben Foster and Taylor Kitsch, and was released in 2013.[3]\n\nGoldsman made his feature film directing debut with Winter's Tale, a film adaptation of the Mark Helprin novel, starring Colin Farrell, Russell Crowe, Jessica Brown Findlay, Jennifer Connelly, Will Smith and William Hurt.[4] It was released on February 14, 2014. He also directed the horror thriller film Stephanie (2017)[5] with Frank Grillo in the leading role.[6] He co-wrote and produced the film adaptation of Stephen King's The Dark Tower series, released on August 4, 2017, which was one of Goldsman's post-Apotheosis films.[7]\n\nIn June 2015, Paramount Pictures announced that Goldsman would head a team of writers and filmmakers to create a multifilm cinematic universe branching out from Hasbro's Transformers franchise. In 2017, his Weed Road company was signed with Paramount.[8]\n\nGoldsman was revealed in September 2018 to have been on the writing staff for Star Trek: Picard, a series focusing on the later years of Captain Jean-Luc Picard.[9] In 2020, he was signed as creator and co-showrunner of the Paramount+ series Star Trek: Strange New Worlds.\n\nIn 2008, Goldsman joined the first season crew of the Fox horror/mystery series Fringe as writer, director, and consulting producer. The first episode Goldsman directed and wrote was \"Bad Dreams\".[10][11] In its fifth season, Goldsman remained a consulting producer. Episodes he contributed to included:\n\n\"Bad Dreams\" (01.17)\n\n\"The Road Not Taken\" (01.19) (executive producer Jeff Pinkner and supervising producer J.R.

Married in 2014, they now have two daughters. The family divides its time between Los Angeles and New York.[13]\n\nIn 2004, Goldsman founded Weed Road Pictures as an independent production company to produce, develop and finance films and other forms of entertainment properties.
