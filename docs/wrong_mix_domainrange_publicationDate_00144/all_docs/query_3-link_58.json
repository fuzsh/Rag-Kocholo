Isaac Asimovâs Robot novels chronicle the unlikely partnership between a New York City detective and a humanoid robot who must learn to work together.Â Â\n\nLike most people left behind on an over-populated Earth, New York City police detective Elijah Baley had little love for either the arrogant Spacers or their robotic companions. But when a prominent Spacer is murdered under mysterious circumstances, Baley is ordered to the Outer Worlds to help track down the killer.Â Â\n\nThe relationship between Life and his Spacer superiors, who distrusted all Earthmen, was strained from the start. Then he learned that they had assigned him a partner: R. Daneel Olivaw.Â Â Worst of all was that the âRâ stood for robotâand his positronic partner was made in the image and likeness of the murder victim!"
