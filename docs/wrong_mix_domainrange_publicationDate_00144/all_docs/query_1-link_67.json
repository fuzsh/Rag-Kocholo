        "text": "Flimsy excuse to post some summer reading suggestions. What does this have to do with anime… uh… look at Bunny Girl Yuki!\n\nHere’s some books that I’d suggest to Yuki to help her watch over Haruhi:\n\nGladwell’s Blink, which principles I apply to my instant history reviews (i.e. thin slicing the new season).\n\nEasterbrook’s The Progress Paradox, which could explain why Haruhi is never completely happy.\n\nBrown’s The Da Vinci Code, just for the Haruhi is God herself conspiracy.\n\nWell’s War of the Worlds, a political commentary on the globalization and colonization of India and Africa disguised as a sci-fi epic, just like how Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is nothing more than a vehicle for Mikuru-run Moe Modes.\n\nGaiman’s Smoke and Mirrors, her list needs more good sci-fi short stories, and I’m not talking about Tales from the Dominion War (which I’ve sadly read as well).\n\nBryson’s A Walk in the Woods, do not go backpacking with Haruhi. I repeat: do not go backpacking with Haruhi.\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings, I can only imagine Itsuki and Kyon travelling to Mordor, with Itsuki trying to fumoffu Kyon, with Kyon saying, “Your face is too close.” In fact, let’s make this happen.\n\nPowell’s My American Journey, my favorite chapter in the book is how Powell goes into his rationale for naming things the way he does. Fantastic piece of insight into marketing and news manipulation… how do you think I come up with headlines for AoMM? :)\n\nTsu’s Art of War, to help her get the most out of her lambda driver.\n\nEuripides’s Medea, my dad once said to me, “jason, never buy a boat.” After reading this tragedy, I know why. Sage advice.\n\nBeckett’s Waiting for Godot, for the Vanishing of Haruhi Suzumiya arc.\n\nSÃ¤ckinger’s Broadband Circuits for Optical Fiber Communication, just kidding. (My summer reading… OTL.)\n\nOkakura’s The Book of Tea, for Mikuru-run.\n\nGatou’s Full Metal Panic, just to complete the circle, maybe have Chidori give Sagara a copy of Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya as a present during the A Very Dancing Christmas arc, which if Kyoto Animation doesn’t animate, I may go on a four state killing spree.\n\nTried not to repeat authors that Yuki already has on her list, or else I’d suggest Heinlein’s Stranger in a Strange Land and omitted as obvious ones like Rashomon, just because the story is as jump as is, and also omitted books your English teacher may make you read, like Sound and the Fury and To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\nHere’s the original list cut & pasted from an anonymous post on 4chan:\n\nThis is the complete translation of “Nagato Yuki’s 100 Books” from Dec.2004 issue of The Sneaker Magazine (Kadokawa Publishing).
