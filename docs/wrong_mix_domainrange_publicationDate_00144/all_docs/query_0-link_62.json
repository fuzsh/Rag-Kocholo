        "text": "A friend of mine began a reading challenge that involves reading all of the books on the NPR’s Top 100 Science Fiction and Fantasy books. After a while, however, she added six more “Top 100” lists to the pile, and came up with her Massive Reading Challenge. I expressed interest in seeing the list, and she kindly sent it to me. Out of sheer obstinacy, I think, I decided to add a few more Top 100 lists, and have come up with the following rather lengthy list of books.\n\nThe titles were obtained from the following sources:\n\nThe NPR’s Top 100 Science Fiction and Fantasy books\n\nThe TIME 100 best English-language novels since 1923\n\nThe Novel 100: A Ranking of the Greatest Novels of All Time\n\nThe BBCs Big Read Top 100\n\nThe BBCs Big Read Top 200\n\nThe Guardian’s The 100 Greatest Novels of All Time: The List\n\nThe New York Times’ Modern Library’s Choices\n\nThe BBC Challenge\n\nThe New Internet Top 100 Science Fiction and Fantasy List\n\nI have removed duplicates from the list, and where multiple books from a series were listed, only the name of the series is in this list, as far as possible. There is most likely some tweaking still needed. The list is a merge of the nine lists, from 1 to 100/200, and each book or series appears at the first point where it appeared in the lists.\n\nFor interest, I have put in bold and italic those books I have read, or have read at least the first book in the series. This does not necessarily mean that I won’t be reading them again. Also, just because a book is on this list doesn’t necessarily mean that I will try to read it – but I might one day.\n\nI’d like to note that these books do not comprise my TBR pile. although a few of them may, perchance, be on it."
