        "text": "To go along with the “What song are you listening to” thread, here’s one for books.\n\nI’ve been re-reading the books I have by Anne McCaffrey and before I get back into the Pern series, I found a couple I hadn’t read before. The one I’m currently reading is The Kilternan Legacy. It’s tagged as a science fiction book, but so far it’s not since it takes place in the 1970s in Ireland and there’s plenty of contemporary references. It’s about a divorced woman who inherited an estate from an aunt she never met. She has to deal with the wishes of her aunt and a family she never knew, plus family and friends amongst the tenants of her new property she seems to be developing beyond her twin son and daughter that she brought with her.\n\nAnne’s son, Todd, released Dragonwriter: A Tribute to Anne McCaffrey and Pern last year, filled with stories about her from many authors. In the foreword, he revealed that his mother had been an opera singer but a vocal coach forced her to overstress her voice to try and get rid of a burr in one note. Anyone that’s read the Crystal Singer books know that a burr that can’t be removed prompts Killashandra Ree to abandon her singing career for a different and better singing career. Irene in Kilternan was also an opera singer with a bad coach.\n\nSo it sounds like there’s at least some of Anne in Kilternan, especially since Anne also moved to Ireland in 1971 with two of her children after a divorce and had to struggle to make ends meet.\n\nNow that it’s finally complete, I’m plowing through a Grand Unified Wheel of Time re-read, start to finish. This’ll be my first time going through the series since book 10 was new.\n\nPresently in book 5. Things are still great, but there are hints of the drudgery to come already showing up. Book 7 was the first one that really slogged for me, and I remember books 8-10 are all a single big mixed-up bowl of boring garbage.\n\nStarting in about book 7 is where I’m going to need to keep the WoT wiki open to be able to keep the exponentially-expanding supporting cast straight.\n\nPratchett in some form is always on the list. I haven’t picked up the new one yet (‘Raising Steam’) but I’m slowly listening to ‘Dodger’ during my commute when I remember it’s on my phone. I just finished Wil Wheaton’s ‘Just a Geek’, re-read Asimov’s ‘Caves of Steel’ and finished ‘Old Man War’ by John Scalzi. Currently looking at the next 4 books of that series on my to-read list. Also finished John Steakly’s ‘Armor’ for the umpteenth time. ‘Libriomancer’ by Jim C. Hines was okay too.\n\nFor actual reading that I’m still going through, ‘Invasion - Book 1 of the Secret World Chronicle’ by Mercedes Lackey and ‘Vehicles\" Experiments in Synthetic Pyschology’ by Valentino Braitenburg are tops. I also have a couple other AI and Make books that I’m reading.\n\nAs I think I’ve mentioned, I pretty much only read cookbooks and novels where people are killed in the first 5 pages. JD Robb, Karin Slaughter, Kathy Reichs, Patricia Cornwell, Jeffrey Deaver, authors like that. And Janet Evanovich for fun. Just picked up the new Jeffrey Deaver short stories collection - plan on spending my day off today reading that. And I’ve just gotten into Lee Child’s “Jack Reacher” series. And, of course, I’m plowing my way through all the Dean Koontz and the few Stephen King novels I’ve yet to read.\n\nAnd don’t get me starting on the long list of free books from the Kindle store - found some awesome authors that way that I would never have read otherwise. Simon Toyne comes to mind - a trilogy involving a secret society within the Church, but (IMNSHO) much better than Dan Brown.\n\nHuh. It almost looks like I do nothing but read. Which isn’t true. I read instead of sleep."
