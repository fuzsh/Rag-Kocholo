As I went on more site visits, I became much more aware of the worlds and lives which exist below our feet. Later, when working as a teacher in Poland, I had the chance to visit one of Europe’s deepest active coal mines. The experience surprised me in so many ways, not least the oppressive heat and the darkness—something you feel you can almost touch. From that moment onward—especially as a horror writer—I’ve found myself wondering about the nightmares lurking below our world, as well as above, and beyond.\n\nKev's book list on subterranean horrors to make you avoid your basement\n\nWhy did Kev love this book?\n\nThis book leans heavily into old English folklore, has terrifying creatures and believable characters.\n\nAbove and beyond all that, though, is the atmosphere the author creates in the rabbit warren of the Chislehurst Caves. It’s no secret that Budd is a veteran visitor to this terrifying complex of tunnels and caverns, and it really shows in this book. Even the “quiet” moments in Enter the Darkness had me shuddering.\n\nBy Sarah Budd, Stephanie Ellis (editor), Carrie Allison-Rolling (editor) , Villimey Mist (editor)\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Enter the Darkness as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nDuring the Spring Solstice, four people enter the caves underneath London.\n\nGarth: a shy young man, who seeks to save the girl of his dreams.\n\nCassie: a beautiful young woman, who seeks to use the dark magic of the caves for her own purposes.\n\nBill: an older man with a terrible secret, who seeks to find Garth and Cassie before it’s too late.\n\nSienna: a con artist with a dark past, who seeks to escape her fate as a chosen sacrifice.\n\nFour people enter. Each of them must battle their personal demons before facing the White Lady, who rises each…\n\nPreview\n\nFrom my list on mystery thrillers set in mountainous landscapes.\n\nBy Nicholas Holloway Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nThis topic is very close to my heart, as a lot of my readers know me as “the landscape guy.” My two award-winning mystery thrillers (and the serial killer thriller I'm currently writing) feature chillingly explosive landscapes (the Sierra Nevada Mountains, the Gates of the Arctic, and the Rocky Mountains). Readers and reviewers have mentioned time and again how I utilize landscape as a character in its own right, and I have very much been influenced by other authors who do the same. There is so much opportunity in these remote and high-altitude landscapes to propel the dread and isolation for these types of stories.\n\nNicholas' book list on mystery thrillers set in mountainous landscapes\n\nWhy did Nicholas love this book?\n\nThis one’s a little bit of a cheat because the Grand Canyon isn’t technically a mountainous landscape—unless you’re looking at it from the bottom. But as far as landscapes go, you can’t do much better. The Anomaly follows an I’ll-do-it-myself archaeologist who discovers an ancient cave that seems to have a mind of its own. More than anything, this book is just downright freakin’ fun. It’s evident that Rutger knows this landscape better than most, and he utilizes both history and conspiracy theories to his advantage. This one’s a true mystery where the setting is a character in itself.\n\nBy Michael Rutger,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Anomaly as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nAn utterly gripping thriller perfect for fans of Dan Brown, Michael Crichton and Stephen King. The Anomaly will leave you breathless until the final page has been turned . . .\n\nTHEY SOUGHT THE TRUTH. THEY FOUND A NIGHTMARE\n\nA team of explorers seek ancient treasures, hidden in a secret cave.\n\nAt first it seems they will return empty handed. Then their luck turns.\n\nBut the team's elation is short-lived as they become trapped there in the dark, with little possibility of escape.\n\nThen events take an even more terrifying turn.\n\nFor not all secrets are meant to be found…\n\nPreview\n\nFrom my list on subterranean horrors to make you avoid your basement.\n\nBy Kev Harrison Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nAt university, I studied Classical Studies, which leans heavily into archaeology. As I went on more site visits, I became much more aware of the worlds and lives which exist below our feet. Later, when working as a teacher in Poland, I had the chance to visit one of Europe’s deepest active coal mines. The experience surprised me in so many ways, not least the oppressive heat and the darkness—something you feel you can almost touch. From that moment onward—especially as a horror writer—I’ve found myself wondering about the nightmares lurking below our world, as well as above, and beyond.\n\nKev's book list on subterranean horrors to make you avoid your basement\n\nWhy did Kev love this book?\n\nAs someone who has explored the tombs of Egypt in real life, this story dug its claws right into me.\n\nAs well as all the claustrophobia, the darkness, and the sense there’s no way out, Moreland confronts you with ancient gods and monsters so terrifying you’ll be testing the walls for a secret passage out of there every step of the way.\n\nBy Brian Moreland,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Tomb of Gods as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n\"The suspense of the story, aided by sly hints from the author, and the atmosphere of a dark, claustrophobic tomb work together to create a scary story. The characters' fear invites the reader into the world to experience the fright themselves.\" - Booklist Starred Review\n\nDeep inside the tomb exists a hidden world of wonder and terror.\n\nIn 1935, British archaeologists vanished inside an Egyptian cave. A year later, one man returned covered in mysterious scars.\n\nEgyptologist Imogen Riley desperately wants to know what happened to the ill-fated expedition led by her grandfather. On a quest for answers, she joins…\n\nPreview\n\nWhy did Kim love this book?\n\nA cute book by Jake Evanoff about a young cave boy, Damien, and his friend Trey the Triceratops.\n\nThe characters are both relatable and fun. During the story, the pair set out to discover the truth about Damien’s past without much thought about what trouble they might get into. It is an exciting adventure story about friendship, family, and acceptance.\n\nA perfect bedtime story for dino-loving kids.\n\nBy Jake Evanoff, Nino Balita (illustrator),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Damien's Quest as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nHe's set out with his best pal to find the place he came from. On his quest to uncover the truth, will he discover something even greater?Nine-year-old Damien loves spending time with the triceratops that took him in, especially his friend Trey. Yet he can’t help but wonder if he truly belongs with them. So one night after everyone has fallen asleep, he decides he’s going to find out once and for all with Trey’s help.Stopping at nothing to reveal the truth, the brave duo search everywhere they possibly can; from the highest mountain tops to the deepest caves. But…\n\nPreview\n\nFrom Rosemary's 3 favorite reads in 2023.\n\nBy Rosemary Sullivan Author\n\nWhy did Rosemary love this book?\n\nMacfarlane took me under the earth: I climbed with him into dark caves miles deep, into prehistoric burial sites 65,000 years old, into the understory of living creatures just beneath our feet and the wide web of the forest that connects all trees into a community, and into underground spaces where physicists unravel the cosmos searching for dark matter.\n\nI now know there is a doomsday vault in the Arctic that preserves ninety million seeds for a post-apocalyptic future. I can never look at trees, the earth, or the cosmos in the same way. He warns of “species loneliness” if extinctions continue. But Macfarlane offers hope.\n\nThe world is utterly precious. Mystery abounds. There is so much to discover.\n\nBy Robert Macfarlane,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n6 authors picked Underland as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIn Underland, Robert Macfarlane delivers an epic exploration of the Earth's underworlds as they exist in myth, literature, memory, and the land itself. Traveling through the dizzying expanse of geologic time-from prehistoric art in Norwegian sea caves, to the blue depths of the Greenland ice cap, to a deep-sunk \"hiding place\" where nuclear waste will be stored for 100,000 years to come-Underland takes us on an extraordinary journey into our relationship with darkness, burial, and what lies beneath the surface of both place and mind.\n\nGlobal in its geography and written with great lyricism, Underland speaks powerfully to our present…\n\nPreview\n\nWhy did AM love this book?\n\nClair Johnson is determined to prove herself and find out what really happened to her mother.
