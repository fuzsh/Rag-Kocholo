        "text": "December 31, 1943 – October 12, 1997\n\nFar OUT!\n\nJohn Denver was renting a home nearby in Monterey, and he purchased this particular plane the day before the accident. It was called a “Long-Eze,\n\nserial number 54, number 228vs.” It was a two-seated fiberglass plane that had originally been built from a kit a few years earlier. Denver had already flown the plane into Monterey from Santa Maria, and on that particular Sunday afternoon he wanted to take it on a test spin down the coast. Denver had practiced three touch and go landings – in which he swooped down to the runway and then pulled back up – before receiving the permission from the Monterey Airport to take the plane on the test spin. It was October 12, 1997.\n\nThis is what he was wearing: a baseball hat with “Yuma Rod and Gun Club” on it, green Haggar trousers (size 32/32), a multi color sweater, black jockey shorts (eww), cowboy boots and dark socks.\n\nThe 53-year-old singer’s last words were a calm query about whether he had transmitted a four-digit code clearly. “Do you have it now?”\n\nIt was 5:28 p.m., and he was about 150 feet from shore, and 500 feet above the ocean when eyewitnesses heard a popping sound. A second or two later, they watched in horror as the plane plunged straight down into the water and broke apart on impact. Within 3 minutes, seagulls had reached the scene. Yum. I hate those things. Winged bowel movements, if you ask me, and you were going to, weren’t you? They found bits of John Denver floating in the debris about 20 minutes later. He was so badly mutilated that all they could tell was that it was a male. They scooped up what they could find in multiple garbage bags, but what was left weighed only 128 pounds. Here’s a list of what ended up forever fish food:\n\nHis brain, his teeth, his eyes, for that matter, 75% of his head was missing. Also gone were his right hemipelvis, and right thigh, one lung and his gallbladder. His left arm was missing, but they found it an hour or so later.\n\nParts of the plane continued to wash up for quite awhile,\n\nand here’s mine,\n\nthanks to a good friend in the right place at the right time. Another addition to my hall of shame, thank you very muchrocio.\n\nUltimately, the cause of the crash was the fact that Denver failed to refuel the tank. That, plus a lack of training. It seems that he was distracted from flying while trying to grab a handle controlling fuel flow. Experts think he spent the last moments of his life trying frantically to switch from this main tank to the reserve one, not realizing that they were both empty. Whoops.\n\nThey cremated what was left of him, and a representative of Parker Funeral Home took the ashes personally to Colorado. His funeral was held on Friday, October 17th, at the Faith Presbyterian Church in Aspen, Colorado. Over 2000 people, and John Denver’s horse Tonto showed up to the tribute, which included six airplanes flying overhead, rocking their wings in a salute. Didn’t anyone see the irony? Everyone agreed that Denver was a plane down to earth kind of guy. Okay, I was good up until this point, wasn’t I?\n\nFindadeath.com friend Ken Wert sends us this:\n\nFor a guy who died in a plane crash, notice the many references to flight – creepy? Let the FAD readers decide:\n\n*******\n\nI’ve seen it rain and fire in the sky…..\n\nIn Memory of\n\nHenry John Deutschendorf Jr.\n\naka John Denver\n\nBorn: December 31, 1943 in Roswell, New Mexico\n\nDied: October 12, 1997 in Monterey, California\n\nMemorial Service\n\nFriday, October 17, 1997, 10:00 AM\n\nFaith Presbyterian Church\n\n11373 E. Alameda Avenue\n\nAurora, Colorado\n\nPastor Les Felker Officiating\n\nOrgan Prelude…….Nancy Thompson\n\nSpecial Music….. “On The Wings of a Dream”\n\nInvocation\n\nScripture: Psalm 121 and I Corinthians 15:35-44 and 51-55\n\nSpecial Music…..”High Flight”\n\nPrayer\n\nExpressions of Love…..Family and Friends\n\nSpecial Music…..”Perhaps Love”\n\nMeditation – Sunset at Noon\n\nBenediction\n\nPostlude….”The Wings That Fly Us Home”\n\nArrangements were made by Parker Funeral Home, Inc.\n\n10325 Parkglenn Way\n\nParker, CO 80138\n\nTrivia: Denver desperately wanted to be the first civilian in space, and came very close to being booked on the ill fated Challenger Shuttle flight.\n\nMore Trivia: Friend of Findadeath Jeff Alderman of Virginia shared a fact with me that I’d forgotten: “In the mid 1970’s, the USA was in the midst of a gas crisis, and Denver briefly became something of a spokesperson for gasoline conservation, and the use of alternate forms of transportation. It was surprising then, when it came to light that he had installed a couple of huge gasoline tanks underground in the backyard of his home – there would be no waiting in gas lines for Mr. Denver.” Thanks Jeff!\n\nThis just in, January 2003, from Findadeath friend Tonya:\n\nAt the very end of the John Denver piece, Jeff talks about JD being a gas conservationist. How ironic that he buried two gas tanks in his yard, but forgets to check his fuel in his plane. This, of course, leads to his demise. Those gas tanks sure would have come in handy, huh?\n\nThis John Denver piece actually contains many weird coincidences.\n\nUPDATE January 2004, from Findadeath friend Gary Orr: One of John Denver’s biggest hits, “Thank God I’m a Country Boy” was played at the Baltimore Orioles home\n\ngames. Always at the 7th inning stretch. He came to perform it live, here in Baltimore, not long before he died. Fans here went crazy for the song if the Orioles were winning or losing the game. I believe the song is still played randomly during the stretch.\n\nUPDATE March 2005, from Findadeath friend Russell:\n\nScott;\n\nHere is some additional information with regard to your John Denver posting.\n\n1) The tanks intended to store gasoline on his property in the 70’s were\n\nnever fully installed, and were removed soon after all the controversy over\n\nthem was generated.\n\n2) According to the official report into the investigation into the cause of\n\nhis plane crash, it was the fuel selector switch that was the main\n\ncontributing factor. In order to avoid having a fuel line running underneath\n\nthe pilot seat, the first owner and builder of the aircraft had changed the\n\ndesign, and installed the selector switch in the wall behind the pilot’s\n\nleft shoulder, rather than in in the dashboard.\n\n3) This switch had a sticky O-ring in it, and that combined with its\n\nlocation made it hard to turn in flight. John and his mechanic had tried\n\nattaching a vice-grip to the switch, but it would not stay in place and kept\n\nfalling off. John employed the use of a hand-held mirror to help locate the\n\nvalve. He also had a feather pillow behind his back, in order to make the\n\nrudder peddles easier to reach, (he was 6 feet tall). When some of these\n\nfeathers were found at the crash sight, they led to speculation that the\n\nplane had hit a bird.\n\n4) Although the fuel in both tanks was low, there was enough fuel aboard for\n\nhim to complete the flight he had in mind. In order to turn the fuel\n\nselector switch once the first tank ran dry, John would have had to unbuckle\n\nhis safety harness and reach around behind with the vice-grip. A recreation\n\nof the crash proved that in doing this his right foot would have pressed\n\ndown on the rudder peddle, causing the plane to dive and stall. By the time\n\nhe would have turned around, he would have lost his visual horizon, and only\n\nhave had a matter of seconds to bring the aircraft back into control.\n\n5) John Denver’s family won a lawsuit against the manufacturers of the fuel\n\nselector switch.\n\nThanks, Russell!\n\nAlso March 2005, from Findadeath friend Murray:\n\nNot that I’m a big John Denver fan, but I want to\n\nclear up something about his death:\n\nIt’s generally accepted that his death was due to\n\npilot error because of his lack of familiarity with\n\nthe aircraft. However, the aircraft was homebuilt, and\n\nthe builder (not Denver) placed the critical fuel\n\ncontrol valve in a very difficult to use position.\n\nDenver was flying an unfamiliar aircraft (he had just\n\npurchased it or was in the process of doing so) at a\n\nlow altitude, had an engine sputter typically\n\nassociated with low fuel, went to change the valve\n\nposition to a new tank, and in doing so, lost control\n\nof the aircraft. Given the location of the valve, his\n\nloss of control is not surprising. The recommended\n\nposition for the valve is on the control panel in\n\nfront of the pilot, whereas the plane’s valve as built\n\nwas behind the pilot, over his left shoulder. In the\n\nsmall cockpit, the valve was not visible without\n\nturning and looking over the pilot’s left shoulder.\n\nA more detailed description is at this site,\n\nhttp://www.asktog.com/columns/027InterfacesThatKill.html,\n\nrelevant portions copied below:\n\nThe Bad Interface\n\nJohn Denver’s aircraft had a fuel selection valve with\n\nonly three positions: Off, Left, and Right. Burt\n\nRutan’s design called for that valve to be placed on\n\nthe front panel of the aircraft, making it easy to\n\nswitch among the options. The builder of the aircraft,\n\nhowever, elected to place the valve back behind the\n\npilot’s left shoulder. He did so with the best of\n\nintentions. By placing the valve behind the pilot’s\n\ncompartment, on the other side of the back firewall,\n\nwith only a long rod leading to the handle behind the\n\npilot’s left shoulder, he avoided running the gas\n\nlines through the passenger compartment, eliminating\n\nany possibility of a gasline rupture occuring inside\n\nthe compartment.\n\nHe did so, however, at a terrible cost to the human\n\ninterface, because the only way to switch tanks was to\n\nlet go of the controls, twist your head to the left to\n\nlook behind you, reach over your left shoulder with\n\nyour right hand, find the valve, and turn it. As the\n\nNational Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)\n\ndiscovered, it was difficult to do this without\n\nbracing yourself with your right foot-by pressing the\n\nright rudder pedal all the way to the floor. And\n\nthat’s what killed John Denver. His plane was seen\n\nveering to the right and plunging into the ocean from\n\nonly a few hundred feet up, consistent with the NTSB’s\n\nreconstruction.\n\nMaking things worse\n\nThe fuel: Denver had three ways to ensure he had\n\nenough fuel. Evidence suggests he made use of two of\n\nthem:\n\nHe had fuel gauges in the rear of the aircraft, behind\n\nthe pilot, and a mirror (!) used to look at them.\n\nHowever, the fuel gauges were not linear and had no\n\nmarkings to indicate that apparently half-full was\n\nreally close to empty.\n\nHe dipped a rod into the fuel tanks while pre-checking\n\nthe plane before flight to test the fuel level. He may\n\nnot have been aware, however, that, because of the way\n\nthe Long-EZ rests, the fuel tends to slosh toward the\n\nfuel tank filler port, giving a highly-optimistic\n\nreading.\n\nThe third method is adding fuel to the tanks, which\n\nDenver failed to do. Because the Long-EZ has very\n\nlarge tanks, the common practice is to add an amount\n\nof fuel suffient for the flight, plus a healthy\n\nmargin. It may be John Denver was told not to fill the\n\ntanks, but was not told of this partial-filling\n\npractice.\n\nThe valve: The builder not only placed the valve in a\n\nnon-standard location, he also rotated it in such a\n\nway that turning the valve to the right turned on the\n\nleft fuel tank. This ensured that a pilot unfamiliar\n\nwith the aircraft, upon hearing the engine begin\n\nmissing and spotting in his mirror that the left fuel\n\ntank was empty, would attempt to rotate the fuel valve\n\nto the right, away from the full tank, guaranteeing\n\nhis destruction.\n\nLessons to be Learned\n\nJohn Denver learned the biggest lesson of all, even if\n\nhe only had a few seconds to appreciate it: Let the\n\nUser Beware! And, indeed, the NTSB, as per its long\n\nhistory of setting aside findings, human factors or\n\notherwise, that might conflict with a verdict of pilot\n\nerror, ruled that the responsibility for this crash\n\nlay with the pilot. The interface was relegated to a\n\nmere “factor.” Had John Denver fueled his aircraft in\n\nspite of evidence indicating he had sufficient fuel,\n\nhad he somehow managed to thoroughly familiarize\n\nhimself with the idiosyncrasies of this\n\nuniquely-assembled experimental aircraft sans manual,\n\nhe would be alive and well today.\n\nHowever, to those of us versed in even rudimentary\n\nhuman factors, it is easy to see that the design of\n\nthis fuel system was a disaster waiting to happen, as\n\nwas borne out not only by what Denver experienced, but\n\nby incidents reported by two previous pilots of this\n\nsame plane who almost met death under the same\n\ncircumstances. Presumably, they had a bit more\n\naltitude when their fuel starved out and, therefore, a\n\nbit more time to react.\n\nThanks, Murray!\n\nAnyway, came across some information on the late John Denver that I thought you might find interesting:\n\n1) The reason he was practicing touch and go landings that day was because he was planning to buzz Clint Eastwood’s place up in Carmel–apparently they were good buddies.\n\n2) He was worth about $7 million at the time of his death, but guess who forgot to write a will? Eventually the estate was divided among his three kids, but recently there was a story in the Aspen newspaper about the IRS trying to get $2.5 million in back taxes from his estate. His two oldest kids are fighting it.\n\n3) In the long list of ex-spouses trying to cash in when their famous ex buys it, add the name of Cassandra Delaney. This is John’s second ex (the first was the famous Annie from “Annie’s Song”) who was a minor actress/singer in Australia. Even though they’d been divorced for four years prior to his death and that by all accounts the divorce was ugly, she’s STILL playing the bereaved widow five years later, busily selling her story to Australian tabloids while trying to get her music “career” started. She still calls herself Cassandra Delaney Denver, too. If you go to her website (www.cassandramusic.com), you can hear her awful MP3s. She tried very hard to get her own piece of John’s estate, but eventually had to settle for her kid’s share. You can start a most interesting flamefest on a Denver website just by mentioning her name, since his fans consider her to be a complete whore.\n\nI was bored one night and found out all this stuff while surfing the Web–which, come to think of it, was how I found Find A Death in the first place! Anyway, keep up the good work!\n\nPatricia"
