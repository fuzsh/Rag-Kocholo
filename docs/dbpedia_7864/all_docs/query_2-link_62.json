        "text": "(As of 2/19/2024)\n\n(As of 2/19/2024)\n\nIn 2018, we moved to Reno, NV. Bought a home there in a Del Webb community (just past Boomtown if you know the area) with a Reverse Mortgage. But without local referral sources, I did some advertising. What really worked were TV commercials on KTVN Channel 2 (a la Tom Selleck.) You can see them at ReverseMortgageConsultant.com if you are curious. That worked better than any advertising I'd ever done in over 20 years. In fact, I made President's Club with Mutual of Omaha Reverse Mortgage (#10 nationally) in 2022 with half the loans from California and half from Nevada.\n\nEven so, I have called myself \"semi-retired\". Doing lots of vacations - mostly cruising. The prize for President's Club was a trip to Sandals in the Bahamas. We have a cruise planned for June, 2024 from Spain to Dublin, Ireland and then a flight to Paris for a total of three weeks. Thanks to cell phones, email and an assistnat, I can keep up with business and still enjoy the vacation.\n\nHave some health issues but they don't keep me from doing anything I want to do. I'm finding this the best time of my life with a large Social Security (waited until 70), a small United Airlines pension and required to take a minimum distribution out of my IRA, I don't have to work. But still working means I can do all the traveling witout having to dip into my retirement funds.\n\n(As of 12/19/15)\n\nLooks like it has been awhile since I've updated this.\n\nShortly after my last update, my mom passed away just short of age 91 (on 11/12/12). Many of your younger brothers and sisters will remember her as the attendence clerk at the Junior High.She started long after we'd passed through. Sometime after my brother and sister started school - my sister is 12 years younger than I. I guess we would have been Juniors by the time she started at the Jr High..\n\nWhile my first intention working with a broker was that I would also be able to do regular mortgages, I found I really didn't like being involved with them anymore. First, I like being the expert at what I do and so much had changed that, if I weren't doing regular mortgages on a regular basis, I wasn't always aware of the changes. I've done a couple with my broker holding my hand. Additionally, I network regularly at the weekly meeting of Realtors. Also attending are other mortgage loan originators. I feel much better asking for their Reverse Mortgage business when I don't compete with them for regular mortgages. They generally feel comfortable with me for that reason that they refer quite a lot of people to me.\n\nThe other issue is that I'm at that point in my life were I don't like being in the emergency mode. With a regular mortgage, people might be buying a home. The buyers and their Realtor expect you to be answering the phone 24/7. AND that loan HAS to close on time. With Reverse Mortgages, I can be on vacation, return a call and the potential borrower is likely to say, \"Just give me a call when you get back.\"\n\nAnd third, I really like working with older adults. Reverse Mortgages are different enough that even those who've had many regular mortgages need to learn about the Reverse Mortgage from scratch. That means I mostly need to be in a teaching mode and use a lot of comparisons to what they do know so they can assimilate this new information. I guess, if I weren't doing this, I'd be a teacher. Even though I've never been a teacher, I feel I've been teaching others all my life. In most jobs I've had, I've been the OJT (On the Job Trainer). Teaching younger or new employees the nuances of their new career. I've always enjoyed that.\n\nWhich brings up another stage of my life. For the first 17 years of my adult life, I worked for United Airlines and traveled a lot, nearly for free. Once I left United, I went a long time without much travel. As I got near retirement age, even though I didn't retire, I wanted to start traveling again. We are now getting away at least twice a year for a couple weeks each (Hawaii, the Florida Keys, Alaska, Las Vegas with New England in the fall foilage on the horizon.) I even qualified as a Travel Agent so as to receive a commission and get a discount on our travel. We can even book cruises and tours for others and receive a commission.\n\nSince I work from home and am considered self-employed through the broker, I have more time and a real interest in volunteering more. I was recently honored with a nomination to the local Napa Register for ther Share the Spirit series. The featured me on a front page article a couple days ago. I'll let that recap my volunteer efforts. See 'Mr. Reliable' finds rewards in helping older adults\n\n(As of 8/19/12)\n\nMetLife shut down the Reverse Mortgage division as of June 30, 2012. Out of work again.\n\nBut not for long. Fortunately there is no age discrimination in this business. Had a number of offers. Decided to go with a local mortgage broker who also has a focus on Reverse Mortgages. I enjoy working with this group of people (age 62+) and helping them come up with a plan for their financial future."
