        "text": "The pioneers of Lemon Grove were the first to settle the area, but not the first to inhabit it. That honor goes to the Kumeyaay who traversed the coastal sage habitat and its cactus strewn lands. The pioneers found land fit for grazing cattle, but without sufficient water for development of farms.\n\nLemon Grove grew because of its proximity to San Diego. It grew because a rail line was built through it, running from San Diego to the town of Foster and the wagon road from Foster to the gold camps of Julian. That rail line provided easy access to markets in San Diego and eastern markets beyond.\n\nWhat the town needed was water. The pioneers raised money, formed water companies and built a flume which brought water from the Cuyamaca Mountains some thirty-seven (37) miles to the east. They built reservoirs. They subdivided the land. They cleared the sage scrub and planted lemons – “a sea of lemons” – and set about building a community. Meet the pioneers of Lemon Grove.\n\nAllen, Sherwood R.
