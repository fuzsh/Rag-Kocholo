        "text": "John often spoke and sang about his spirituality and love of people and nature. He was\n\nraised in a family that believed in Christianity and the values that the Bible teaches.\n\nIn his adult years and, particularly after around 1971, John's views on religion began\n\nto expand beyond Christianity. His values mirrored many of the common beliefs shared\n\nby the major world religions-i.e. there is a God, be kind to others, do something to\n\nmake the world a better place etc, pray... So, in that vein he has lots in common with\n\nChristianity. In terms of the Biblical views on things and some specific things the\n\nBible says about Christianity and getting to heaven etc... there is some question about\n\nJohn being a Christian in the full Biblical sense. Christianity, like many spiritual\n\nteachings, does get specific and John's views sometimes overlapped with Christianity but\n\nat other times he clearly embraced the views of other religions and philosophies such as\n\nreincarnation and certain teachings of some Native American and Eastern Philosophies.\n\nSometimes the beliefs of Christianity are clearly distinct from those other beliefs.\n\nOne thing is clear and that is that no Christian (including myself) should attempt to\n\nplay God and judge John's or anyone's spiritual destiny. It is my hope and deep\n\ndesire to see John Denver in heaven and sing with him and the angels. From a Christian\n\nperspective, we believe that God loves us all and that Jesus came to create a way for\n\neveryone to be in heaven one day.\n\nI know that God loves John Denver and is glad for the work he did on and for this world.\n\nAWPatt wrote:\n\n> The question was asked (\"Subject: Thought Question\") whether or not John\n\n> Denver was a Christian.

You have to live your faith. John Denver\n\nlived his faith. Ponder Matthew 5:16, 1 Corinthians 13:1-13, and most\n\nparticularly James 2:14-17\n\nWhat does it profit, my brethren, if a man says he has faith but has not\n\nworks? Can faith save him?\n\nIf a brother or sister is ill-clad and in lack of daily food, and one of\n\nyou says to them, \"Go in peace, be\n\nwarmed and filled,\" without giving them the things needed for the body,\n\nwhat does it profit? So faith by itself,\n\nif it has no works, is dead.\n\nPeace,\n\nBill\n\nMike61234 <mike...@aol.com> wrote in article\n\n<19980121051...@ladder01.news.aol.com>...\n\n> UNLESS HE GOT SAVED no he isnt.

He seemed to have a lot more\n\nvirtues than most people. His caring is a virtue, not a work..\n\nThink it thru, many of his characteristics are virtues showing\n\nhis spirit and soul, NOT works. He lived what most people\n\nonly preach about.\n\nAnother interesting thing is the fact that everyone at least\n\nseems to have a belief in God, even if some don't agree\n\nin exact semantics.\n\nWe should not forget a very important verse that states..\n\nJudge not, lest ye be judged......\n\nLaura\n\nDear Most Revered Cyn O'moura,\n\nKeeping with the spirit of this post, your thoughts are so .... how shall I\n\ndescibe it? Profound, witty and valuable. Since you are a member of the\n\nclergy in good standing, and seem to be so filled with Godly wisdom in regard\n\nto JD, perhaps you could be kind enough to offer to your fawning flock the\n\nfollowing:\n\n1) Doctorate in Divinity from where?\n\n2) Currently tending to your flock where? (address?)\n\n3) Do you have a Congregation? (Denomination?)\n\n4) Telephone number so we can call you for more excellent utterances of\n\nspiritual insight, discourse and counsel?\n\nWith great appreciation for your tremendous contribution to humanity,\n\nbrilliance, and profound intellect, yours sincerely,\n\nSagire de Veritas\n\n> Hello Everyone\n\nI'm hoping soon that we can stop worrying and /or bickering about whether or\n\nnot John wasa Christian or whether or not he was saved etc.\n\nThe following is from an earlier post of mine.\n\n> In my opinion, John's talents, voice, musical abilities etc were a gift\n\n> from God.\n\n> I also believe that John was a Gift from God to the human race, and to\n\n> the earth.\n\n> Whatever any human can achieve spiritually on this earth in terms of\n\n> relation to\n\n> or with God, the Almighty, The Creator of the Universe, or whatever you\n\n> want to call\n\n> him , I strongly believe that John achieved it. Nothing will change my\n\n> mind on this.\n\n> I have never heard or read about John specifically stating his religious\n\n> beliefs, but so many of his songs\n\n> speak for him. Some people out there have obviously\n\n> never read the last\n\n> verse of \"Ravens Child\". In General, I would have to say that Johns\n\n> songs are full of prayer\n\n> and aknowledgement to God.\n\n> Can we please give this issue a rest ?\n\n> Peace\n\n"
