        "text": "News of John Denver's tragic death cast a large shadow over the investigation that followed. You might recall he died in a plane crash in October 1997, but what caused that crash is foggy.\n\nSeveral simple mistakes were made that afternoon: It's a rare case of witness accounts lining up with what was known about Denver and his plane ahead of time. This week's episode of Secret History of Country Music explores the former Entertainer of the Year winner's death and how it affected his legacy.\n\nDoes John Denver deserve to be in either the Rock & Roll or the Country Music Hall of Fame? Would it be more likely if he hadn't died?\n\nBoth the video above and podcast explain what happened, before Taste of Country's Billy Dukes and Adison Haager go deeper to answer lingering questions. Denver had two alcohol-related arrests in the years prior — did that play a factor?\n\nHow did a design decision impact what happened, and why was he flying without a pilot's license?\n\nSeason 2 of Secret History of Country Music is available as a YouTube video podcast or audio-only podcast. Both are above, but you can also find the pod on Apple, Spotify or wherever you podcast."
