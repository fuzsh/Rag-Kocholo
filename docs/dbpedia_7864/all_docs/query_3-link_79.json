        "text": "Although the 1970s are remembered as a time of punk, soul and glam rock, one of the most successful musicians was John Denver, with his flowery cowboy shirts, happy grin, Dutch haircut and granny glasses.\n\nListening afresh to his moving and powerful songwriting, it's easy see why he was such a huge hit. Denver had four platinum and 12 gold albums in the US alone, and his Greatest Hits album spent 175 weeks in the charts.\n\nThe American was a familiar figure to Brits (he had his own BBC2 series) and was a regular on child-friendly TV specials. Now he is being celebrated in a tribute album, The Music Is You: A Tribute To John Denver, that features grand stars of country music and young indie rock musicians, some of whom would have been in primary school when Denver was singing on The Muppet Show.\n\nThe cast list is varied and impressive for the 14 songs — younger acts such as My Morning Jacket, Kathleen Edward, Brandi Carlile, Train, Brett Dennen and Milow, joining country giants such as Emmylou Harris, Mary Chapin Carpenter and Lucinda Williams — and the result is a really good album.\n\nThe songs are mostly upbeat, expressing Denver's delight in the beauty of making a connection with the world and nature, but there is grit in there, too. That's not surprising given what a complex and contradictory man Denver seems to have been.\n\nHe was born Henry John Deutschendorf junior in Roswell, New Mexico, on New Year's Eve 1943 and switched names after accepting that his own would never be good for billboards. \"I chose Denver,\" he wrote in his 1994 autobiography Take Me Home, \"which I associated with the Rocky Mountains. I identified with those mountains.\"\n\nHis life was a reminder of Oscar Wilde's dictum that the truth is never pure and rarely simple. He had two complicated marriages. The first to Ann Martell inspired him to write Annie's Song, which is given a lovely makeover by Brett Dennen and Milow (above) on the new CD. Denver and Martell adopted two children before the marriage ended acrimoniously, with Denver destroying the marital bed with a chainsaw in a rage.\n\nThere were allegations of domestic abuse during his second marriage to Cassandra Delaney (below, a singer 18 years his junior of whom he later complained \"she managed to make a fool of me from one end of the valley to the other\"), yet they renewed their friendship post-divorce, and she told an Australian reporter after Denver's death that: \"John was never violent with me.\"\n\nHis song Rocky Mountain High — covered by Allen Stone on the album — was one Denver later admitted had been written while high on LSD and marijuana. Lucinda Williams, whose dark and soulful interpretation of This Old Guitar is one of the highlights of the album, said: \"He had this wholesome image, but apparently John Denver was quite the pothead. That might explain that big smile he always had. That was kind of what maybe turned people off — you’re too sunny, the clean air, this clean-cut-looking guy with his bangs. Then you realise, wow, there’s all this darkness. None of John Denver’s songs have an obvious edge. You sort of have to read between the lines.”\n\nFriends speak of a warm man, able to see the funny side of life, as when he starred alongside George Burns in the 1977 comedy Oh, God!, yet he took legal action when Monty Python recorded Farewell to John Denver in 1981, a song in which Eric Idle (as Denver) was strangled by a boa constrictor.\n\nDenver was a true force in the 1970s, a time when he worked frequently with Frank Sinatra. The great crooner once commented: \"It reminds me of what happened to me. Once again America has picked out a hero in John Denver.\" The 1980s were harder for Denver, who was doing a lot for social causes and environmental campaign at a period when his musical career was diminishing. By the mid-1990s he was in deep trouble, twice arrested on drunk-driving charges. It was a time he called his \"dark night of the soul\".\n\nHis eccentricity was clear, too. One of his unfulfilled ambitions was to become an astronaut and to beam his music down to Earth.\n\nDenver had always had a difficult time with his father, a hard-drinking and emotionally cold former Air Force test pilot. Yet they bonded later in life over flying. He taught Denver how to fly and the singer spent millions on vintage biplanes, a Learjet, two Cessna 210s, a Christen Eagle aerobatic plane and the small Long EZ plane in which he died.\n\nIt was a cruel twist of fate that the man who wrote the stunning Leavin' on a Jet Plane (for a while United Airlines used it as a theme song and it is covered imaginatively by My Morning Jacket) should die in a self-piloted plane crash. He was 53 when he perished in Monterrey Bay, California, on 12 October 1997.\n\nRather than the troubled man, it is better to remember the man who loved words and was so good with them. Even the name for his cat, Andromeda, would surely pass the Samuel Butler measure of the true test of the imagination being the ability to name a cat.\n\nHis song Take Me Home, Country Roads is gorgeous and although the definitive cover is the 1972 stunner by Ray Charles, Brandi Carlile and Emmylou Harris offer an interesting revamp on The Music Is You. Bill Danoff, the Springfield native who co-wrote that hit and I Guess He’d Rather Be in Colorado (recreated wonderfully by Mary Chapin Carpenter) had an interesting view on the tribute album, telling the Boston Globe: \"When I listened to this album, I thought it was really cool. John’s ’70s records don’t come through to younger people. They're very dated — physically, sonically. But this new tribute record is gorgeous. To me, they’re literally brand-new songs, and I think that happens all over that album. And that’s the tribute.”\n\nHis songs about nature (oddly, from a man who had majored in architecture) are joyous but his take on life isn't just saccharine. You can tell that from the lovely song Some Days Are Diamonds, sung with his usual brilliance by Amos Lee. 'Some days are diamonds, some days are stones,' as the song says. Another highlight is Josh Ritter and Barnstar! (Zack Hickman and Mark Erelli's band) with a vibrant version of the 1967 folk standard Darcy Farrow, which Denver helped to popularise.\n\nA year before he died, Denver said: \"Some of my songs are about very simple things in life. But those simple things are meaningful to me and have obviously meant something to people all over the world, even if it's only in a karaoke bar.\"\n\n“You fill up my senses\n\nLike a night in a forest\n\nLike the mountains\n\nin springtime\n\nLike a walk in the rain.”"
