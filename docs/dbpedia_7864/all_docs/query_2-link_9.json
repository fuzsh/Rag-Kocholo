His mother insisted he pronounce words when he was singing, so everyone could understand the song. His parents captured home movie footage of his performances. The family said John was an amazing story teller.[3]\n\nAt age 12, his grandmother gave him a guitar she has played and he began guitar lessons in Tucson, Arizona.[4]\n\nSome of John's best childhood memories were on his father's hometown farm in Oklahoma. John worked wheat harvest with the family relatives and the memories gave inspiration to future songs.[4]\n\nJohn attended Arlington Heights High School, in Ft Worth, Texas, United States.[5]\n\nIn 1963, he moved to Los Angeles and changed his name from Henry John Deutschendorf, Jr. to John Denver for his recording career. He took his new last name from the capital of his favorite state of Colorado, where he later resided in Aspen.[6]\n\nJohn married first in 1967.[7][8][9][10] John's second marriage to an Australian actress, was in 1988.[11]\n\nHe moved to Colorado in 1970, and the beauty of nature around him energized his song writing.[4] John first gained recognition as a songwriter with “Leaving On A Jet Plane” which was recorded by Peter, Paul and Mary (their first and only number one hit). He became a top music star in the 1970s with hits: “Take Me Home, Country Roads,” “Rocky Mountain High,” “Sunshine On My Shoulders,” “Annie’s Song,” “Back Home Again,” “Thank God I’m A Country Boy,” and “Calypso”.[6]\n\nIn 1985, he was invited to perform in the USSR, which lead to a concert tour there in 1986. John returned again to USSR in 1987 for a concert to benefit the he victims of Chernobyl.[6] He memorized a verse of \"Annie's Song\" in Russian to sing at the concerts, which helped establish rapport with his audience.[3]\n\nJohn cared deeply about world peace, hunger, and protecting the environment. He focused on world-hunger concerts.[3]\n\nJohn died on October 12, 1997 in Monterey Bay near Pacific Grove, California, aged 53.[1][12][13][14]\n\nJohn Denver \"Spirit\" statue\n\nDeutschendorf ~ West Prussia to German-Russian Roots\n\nThe name is pronounced in various ways by family members today, usually \"Dutchen-dorf but sometimes \"Deutschen-dorf.\" The name \"Deutschendorf literally means \"German village.\"\n\nIn his autobiography, John Denver references the Deutschendorfs in Oklahoma, who were Germans from Russia. In his book, John shares family folklore, and describes the early Deutschendorfs as \"a pretty impressive band of people .,. [who] worked for themselves the entire four seasons, and they worked hard.[15] His paternal grandparents were immigrants who were Black Sea Germans from Mennonite colonies.\n\nHis ancestors emmigrated from Kuckuck (Thiensdorf), West Prussia and settled in South Russia (some areas now Ukraine). They made their home in Ekaterinoslav region before moving to North Caucasus, where many Black Sea Germans and Volga Germans merged for farm land and migration from war.\n\nOn June 19,1998, a special \"Memorial Tribute to John Denver\" was held at the AHSGR Convention in Wichita, Kansas. John's mother Erma and other cousins attended. AHSGR dedicated a brick in their Lincoln, Nebraska pioneers memorial which bears a musical symbol, and includes this inscription; JOHN DENVER 1943—1997.[15]\n\nSources\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 Death: \"United States, Social Security Numerical Identification Files (NUMIDENT), 1936-2007\"\n\nciting Digital film/folder number: DI0001099\n\nFamilySearch Record: 6K72-NZ5Q (accessed 31 December 2023)\n\nHenry John Deutschendorf, Jr death 12 Oct 1997 (born 31 Dec 1943).\n\n↑ 1950 Census: \"United States 1950 Census\"\n\nciting Page: 62; Line: 25; Digital film/folder number: 108807763; Image number: 65\n\nFamilySearch Record: 6XKG-5WJC (accessed 31 December 2023)\n\nFamilySearch Image: 3QHN-LQH7-YQBY\n\nHenry J Deutchendorf, Jr (6), single son, in household of Henry Deutchendorf (30) in Smithville, Pima, Arizona, United States.
