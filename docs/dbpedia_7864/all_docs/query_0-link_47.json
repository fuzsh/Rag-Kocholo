His plane crashed in Monterey Bay on October 12, 1997. The memorial is a way to celebrate his incredible legacy as you reflect upon the fantastic ocean views, a fitting tribute for the singer and songwriter. Even if you weren't a fan this location is lovely along the coast between Pacific Grove and Asilomar.",
