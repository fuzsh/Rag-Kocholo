I\n\nfeel like these last couple of days and today, Jerry and I\n\nhave been here, like millions of other people that would have\n\nliked to have been here that are listening in or seeing us and\n\neach one of us have our own story in our hearts whether we met\n\nJohn or not. There is a place he holds in our hearts. There\n\nwas a woman on tv in California, she was lighting a candle and\n\nlaying flowers at Lover's point, and she said to the camera\n\nperson as tears were rolling down her face, she said, \"You\n\nknow, I always wanted to get to know John Denver, to meet\n\nhim, and I never did, but you know, he lives inside a part of\n\nmy heart and he always will.\" And, I think she really spoke\n\nfor hundreds of millions of people around the world. I wanted\n\nto share her story, because each of us has our own story where\n\neach of us came to know John, how his music permeated through\n\nthe years. What I've come to realize over time, it was so\n\nmore than the personality, more than that incredible boyish\n\nway, you know, that grabbed our hearts and holds it forever.\n\nI think it was more than John's talent of singing and writing\n\nsongs. What I've come to realize, which came from my own\n\nfirst experience, is that John held a vibration, a unique\n\nvibration in his voice that sang and resonated beyond time,\n\nbeyond culture, beyond religion, beyond hatred and into the\n\nhearts of people. And I believe that that vibration in his\n\nvoice was a divine gift, and that's the way that we heard him.\n\nOn a little country road in Northern California, many many\n\nyears ago, I was driving my car and the radio was on and this\n\nsong began, I never heard the voice before, I wasn't really\n\npaying much attention, and all of a sudden, I thought, someone\n\nis singing about the sunshine. Sunshine, which I love so much\n\nand the warmth in our hearts and sunshine on my shoulder and\n\nof course the sun was beaming down on my shoulder. Before I\n\nrealized it, there were tears running down my eyes and my\n\ncheeks started to get really wet and I began to sob and I\n\ndidn't know why. So much so, I had to pull over the side of\n\nthe road and I just wept. And I went, \"What is happening,\n\nwhat is this, who is this person?\" And afterwards, they\n\nannounced it was \"Sunshine on My Shoulders\".And at that\n\nmoment, I knew it was beyond a person or a singer, it was a\n\ncall to wake us up to remember all those things around us.\n\nThe earth and each other and the spirit that lives within each\n\none of us.\n\nJerry (Jampolski) and I had the sacred privilege, 2 days ago,\n\nof traveling with John's ashes in his last journey. We went\n\nto Monterey and I want to share a little bit of this\n\njourney with you, so you can hold it in your heart too,\n\nbecause it was a very sacred journey for us. There wasn't a\n\nmoment in those 8 or 9 hours that Jerry and I didn't hold\n\nJohn's ashes very closely to our hearts or in our laps and as\n\nI was walking out on the ramp, in Monterey, this place that\n\nJohn loves to fly so much out of..he loves that county. In my\n\nmind was a dialogue of saying goodbye, saying, come on, okay,\n\nit's time to leave California, to come on back to Colorado on\n\nyour way, going on to eternity. And on the ramp there was this\n\nincredible sense of John's presence and as the plane took off,\n\nout of Monterey airport, just like John had done a few days\n\nbefore, we took off over Lover's Point, and at that moment, I\n\nreached down in my consciousness and I said, John, if any part\n\nof your spirit is confused here, come with us, come let us\n\ntake you up and bring you home. And as we went around, down\n\nthe coast of California, The sun was blazing through the\n\nwindow. It was blinding and it was shimmering off the water,\n\nand I gently in my mind, quietly sang \"Sunshine\" and as we\n\ntook off out of Los Angeles, I said, \"John, it is really time\n\nto leave California\" and I felt is was okay, I felt he was\n\nreally there, leaving his life there and his time there. And\n\nI looked out and there was with this giant jet engine and I\n\nthought of \"Leaving on a Jet Plane\". We came into Colorado\n\nlate at night and it was dark and you couldn't see anything\n\nand then all of the sudden the full moon was there and the\n\nColorado snow capped peaks shown like diamonds out the window\n\nand there were the Rockies, and it was a time to say goodbye\n\nto the Rockies. We really felt John's spirit. We feel it\n\nhere now. We feel his incredible awestruck essence saying,\n\nthis is some journey, saying something like \"Far Out.\" A\n\njourney we will all come to know. As we brought him home, we\n\nbring him home to his mother Erma, an amazing being. No\n\nwonder John turned out like he did. His brother, Ron, his\n\nchildren, those people who have come to know and love him,\n\nAnnie very especially. All those who knew John and were close\n\nto him, those that never knew John in the body, but know him\n\nin the spirit, we bring him home And I leave you with these\n\nlast words, that we shared with John, Jerry and I, when we\n\nwere on top of a hill in California at least over a decade\n\nago. We were flying kites like a bunch of kids, and we did a\n\nmeditation there and I shared these words that I had written\n\nand they brought tears to John's eyes and he said he really\n\nloved them. I say this to each of us, family and friends, if\n\nyou can think in your mind, in reaching out to John, reaching\n\nout to his essence and saying, Come take my hand as we walk\n\nthrough time to a place where none exists free from matter to\n\nfuse in the light and communion forever more.\n\n===============\n\nJerry Jampolsky\n\n===============\n\nSpeech at the Aurora, CO\n\nMemorial Service for John Denver\n\nOctober 17, 1997\n\nFaith Presbyterian Church\n\nI asked John's mother yesterday of all the many memories that\n\nshe has what one or two memories might pop up first in her\n\nheart. the thing that popped up was when John was about 4 1/2\n\nyears old and Ron was born. John went around the neighborhood\n\nand told everyone that they got Ron through the Sears and\n\nRoebuck catalog. You see how creative he was even at that\n\nyoung age.\n\nYou know the shock and the suddenness of John's death and as\n\neach of us do our individual grieving at the loss of his\n\nphysical presence. It behooves us to ask the question once\n\nagain..What is life? What is death? What is the purpose of\n\nlife? Is life simply that we are born in these bodies and then\n\nwe die and then that's the end of life. Or are we spiritual\n\nbeings, are we light beings that live forever?\n\nCertainly John believed the latter. We've been blessed at the\n\nCenter for Attitudinal Healing in Sausalito, California. We\n\nwork with children who have catastrophic illness. We have\n\nwonderful teachers who have another way of looking at life and\n\ndeath. The first child that died in our center in the mid 70's\n\nwas a boy named Greg Harrison who was about 11 years old. He\n\nknew he was about to die and one of the boys asked him \"What\n\nis it like to die?\" What happens is that you simply discard\n\nthis body which was never real in the first place and then you\n\nare at one with all souls. And sometimes you come back and\n\nact as a guardian angel to someone else. There is no question\n\nthat Greg is acting as a guardian angel for me and there's no\n\nquestion that John will be there for many of us, always being\n\nthere for us whenever we're going through some rough journeys,\n\nhelping us along on our journey.\n\nThere's another boy named Bobby and I asked him... he was\n\nclose to dying - what advice would you give to other 14 year\n\nolds who might be in your same circumstance. He said...You\n\nought to tell the children that as long as they are breathing\n\n- no matter how sick they are - their purpose in life is to\n\nlove and to forgive. Perhaps it is another time to allow John\n\nto teach us again what we are here for, what life is all\n\nabout. We also have countless stories of how many times John\n\neagerly helped children and adults who were in terrible\n\ndifficulties.\n\nI'll tell you just one story about Sister Ada\n\nwho was about 5 feet tall. She was in a cloistered Carmelite\n\nConvent in San Diego, CA. She had cancer. I had been seeing\n\nher for a couple of years at that time. This one\n\ntime I was seeing her and her cancer had gotten worse. We\n\nstarted talking about music and it turned out that John was an\n\nidol of her's. She told me what Diane and everyone knows that\n\nwhen you hear John's voice what you experience is the peace of\n\nGod being present. Later I was with John and shared the story\n\nabout Sister Ada and he got on the phone and called her. That\n\nwas the most important telephone call Sister Eda ever\n\nhad. She went on telling everybody- JOHN DENVER called me and\n\nwe talked about music. We talked about love.\n\nWe talked about God. She wasn't thinking about herself having\n\ncancer at that point. John wasn't always gentle. He could be a\n\ntough teacher of love. He was a tough teacher of mine one\n\ntime and again this was in about the mid 80's and he asked me\n\nif I'd like to go flying that day. It was going to be in a\n\nbi-plane and all of a sudden he was putting on the snoopy\n\ngoggles and I remembered that I think people do stunts in bi\n\nplanes. We were up flying would it be alright to do a few\n\nstunts, he asked. I was really scared but I didn't say so.\n\nAll of a sudden it turned out to be tremendously fun.\n\nI had a great time. Then he was flying and he said \"I'm going\n\nto turn off the speaker system so that you can't talk to me\n\nbut I can talk to you.\" All of a sudden we were flying this\n\nway and he said \"I just want you to have the experience of how\n\ngentle this airplane is.\" We leaned to the right going down\n\njust a little bit. And he said \"I want you to put your hand\n\non the throttle and turn it right.\" Meanwhile I was trying to\n\nshout to him that I was dyslexic and I didn't know my right\n\nfrom my left side. My God, what are you doing? He wasn't\n\ndoing anything and all of a sudden he cured my dyslexia. All\n\nof a sudden I was turning to the left and I was turning to the\n\nright and I found that I really did know the difference\n\nbetween my right and my left.\n\nI have been asked to read a letter from former President Ford\n\nto John's mother:\n\n\"I would want all the family and friends of\n\nJohn Denver to know how much his friendship\n\nmeant to Betty and me over many years. Our common\n\nlove for Colorado created a bond between us that will\n\nalways remain special in my memory and whenever I hear\n\nthe beautiful music that John provided to us all.\n\nJohn left much sooner than he should\n\nhave. We have the comforting thought to know that his\n\nmusic will last many lifetimes.\n\nWith our deepest sympathy\"...Gerald R. Ford\n\nTwo nights ago when Diane and I were with John's mother and\n\nfamily. It was mentioned that she had her 75th birthday on\n\nAugust 7th, and John had written a letter for her. I read the\n\nletter aloud and it was the most beautiful letter that I had\n\never read, that a son had written his mother. It was so\n\nhealing to everyone that night that we thought it would be\n\nvery helpful to read this letter this morning.\n\n\"My dear mother. I have wanted to tell you today\n\nhow very much I love you. I wanted you to know\n\nhow much you are respected and appreciated by me.\n\nThat I know how big your heart is how much you\n\nfeel and how much you care. There are times that\n\nI wish I could take you in my arms and hold you\n\nin a way that would make you feel loved and cared\n\nfor - that you would feel safe and warm and really\n\nappreciated for the wonderful woman you are.\n\nThat you would feel understood and respected for\n\nall the things that you do. That you would know\n\nthat someone else knows how much love you have\n\ngiven of yourself beyond measure - time and time\n\nagain - not only to Dad and Ralph and Ron and me\n\nbut also to our families and to so many others.\n\nI wanted you to know what a blessing you have\n\nbeen in my life, and through me to so many others.\n\nI would not be the man that I am, nor would I be\n\nable to sing the way that I do nor would I have\n\nwritten the songs that I've written without the\n\ninfluence and the inspiration that you have been\n\nto me. I want you to know that today\n\nthere are hundreds if not thousands of people who\n\njoin me in saying...\"God bless the day that you were\n\nborn. Happy Birthday, Mom - and many more.\n\nI love you.\"\n\nYour son, John\n\nWhat purity of love as John writes from the inner linings of\n\nthe soul and his heart. What can we learn from this and John?\n\nWhat can we learn in this tragic moment? Well, perhaps we\n\ncan ask ourselves the question. John knew without question\n\nhow much his Mom loved him, and they knew how much they\n\nloved each other but there may be many of us today who do not\n\nhave that kind of healed relationship. Would it be possible\n\nin the next 24 hours that we might get on the phone, or write\n\nsomeone that we haven't really, completely said how much we\n\nloved them. And wouldn't John be chuckling, and belly\n\nlaughing and approving if we just made that one difference. I,\n\nlike Tom and so many others really feel John's spirit here\n\ntoday and I know it is always going to be in our hearts. I\n\nknow that his music will continue to affect millions and\n\nmillions of other people. Knowing that his music really\n\nreleases the soul to be free to soar. John knew that he was\n\nan instrument of God's love. So may we learn from John how\n\none person can really make a difference, how one person can\n\ndemonstrate how much and how tenderly he loves nature and the\n\nplanet earth. And may love be the way that we walk in\n\ngratitude in our own pathway and return that to John for all\n\nof the love that he has given to us. We love you John.\n\n=============================\n\nAbraham Lincoln Deutschendorf\n\n=============================\n\nSpeech at the Aurora, CO\n\nMemorial Service for John Denver\n\nOctober 17, 1997\n\nFaith Presbyterian Church\n\nI'm going to have everybody stand up. You've been sittin'\n\nquite awhile. If everybody would just stand up and let\n\nthose cells spread out a little bit and in the other places\n\nalso if you would do that and turn to the person on your left\n\nand on your right and say \"You really have been patient. I'm\n\nimpressed with your patience during all this.\" Now if you all\n\nwill go ahead and have a seat. That didn't take long and let\n\nme tell you who I am.\n\n\"I am Abraham Lincoln Deutschendorf. I was born February the\n\n12th and with ten boys in the family, they were running out of\n\nnames. So, I got tagged with Abraham Lincoln Deutschendorf.\n\nI am one of Ron and John's uncles. As I said, there were ten\n\nof us boys and if I talk too long, one of my brothers back\n\nthere are going to dong me, so I need to really get into this.\n\nI love John and I know all of you do. I have never come into\n\na church that I felt had so much love in it. I felt this\n\nseveral years ago where we did the celebration of John's Dad,\n\nmy brother's service and some of you all may have been her for\n\nDutch's service. It was an incredible celebration. You know,\n\nfunerals are too sad, I think, and memorial services are too\n\nsad and parting is sad. There is no question about it, but it\n\nis my objective to give a tribute to John and to add to these.\n\nAll of you all have absolutely blessed my heart with your\n\ntestimonies about John. My nephew, Henry John Deutschendorf,\n\nJohn Denver.. He loved life and thoroughly enjoyed, through\n\nhis music, helping other people to enjoy life. When I think\n\nof that, of his passion to help people enjoy life, I'm\n\nreminded of a little boy's prayer, and Ron I've prayed this\n\nprayer and I really think John did and I think you did too:\n\nThis little boy was praying to God and he said \"Dear God, If\n\nyou can't make me a better boy, don't worry about it, I'm\n\nenjoying being like I am.\"\n\nJohn also personified the prose, the station. Indias, the\n\nauthor, depicts life as like a train trip across the United\n\nStates where our objective is to get to the station. When we\n\nget to the station we're going to enjoy life. We put it off\n\nuntil we realize all of our goals - 'til the kids get through\n\ncollege or 'til we make all the money we need to make or\n\nsomething and sooner or later. And John found this out. There\n\nis no station. The joy is in the ride. We need to stop and\n\nsmell the roses and enjoy life now and not later. Some of you\n\nall may be looking for the station, it's not there\n\nit is the ride. So I just wanted to say that John's attitude\n\nand personality has really\n\nbeen a blessing to the Deutschendorf family. Let me give you\n\na touch - a word from the heart that personifies this. My\n\nbrother, Paul, is back there and a number of years ago, John\n\ncame with Zachary and Anna Kate and he brought his guitar and\n\nwe were singing, right after Thanksgiving and I went to pick\n\nup my mother, Grandma Deutschendorf, who was in a nursing\n\nhome. I could jerk a seat out of my van. We just lifted her on\n\nthe van. We sang and John sang, for about two and a\n\nhalf hours. By the way, we've got a home video of that, Ron if\n\nthe San Hedran wants to make a library to keep the memory of\n\nJohn alive we'll donate that and a lot of other things. I\n\nthink that might be a good idea. But let me quickly get to the\n\npoint I want to make about John and family: Grandma\n\nDeutschendorf - Grandma Swope, Erma's Mom, is the one that\n\ngave him the guitar that got him started on this. But here we\n\nare and my mother's hands had arthritis so bad, but good gosh\n\nshe clapped but she got tired and we were taking her..Paul\n\nand John and I were taking her... back to the nursing home.\n\nJohn got down on one knee and got right up close to her and\n\nput her hands in his hand and he said \"Grandma Deutschendorf,\n\nyou are a very special lady and I love you very very much and\n\nI wish...(this was right after Thanksgiving)... you have the\n\nMerriest Christmas you've ever had. Now I'm not going to be\n\nable to come back for Christmas,\" and then he reached up and\n\nkissed her and I guarantee you it just blew her away! She\n\nreally.... that was the kind of guy that John Denver was. He\n\nwas a charismatic person. He would walk in the room and you\n\ncould actually realize that and feel that. John sang from\n\nthe heart and not simply from his intellect. He sang from the\n\nheart. I'll tell you something else I can relate to John about\n\nand maybe some of you can also and it certainly does not\n\ninclude this church, but there may be some members in this\n\nchurch who had this problem. I had it once and that is that\n\nJohn, like myself, and like some of you all, was turned off by\n\na cold, calculating religious rigorous rules of religion\n\nbut - now listen to me now - Religion will never bring the\n\ninner joy and the inner faith and John discovered that. It is\n\na relationship that does it. It is a relationship. You know\n\nthe great apostle of love in the New Testament, John, said\n\nthat he that hath the Son has life. That speaks about a\n\nrelationship. If you have been turned off with religion let me\n\nencourage you to keep looking as John and many of the rest of\n\nyou have and find the deeper meaning of life through a\n\npersonal intimate, vibrating relationship with the Son of God.\n\nIn closing let me say this: All of us have been touched by\n\nJohn Denver's three loves - pursuit of peace, alleviating\n\nworld hunger, and impacting the environment. and I\n\nsay it's time for us and it's time for the rest of America to\n\nstep up to the plate and use our influence and all of us have\n\nthat. Let me just close with this little poem which I think\n\nepitomizes what John did and what you and I can do: If you\n\nwould sense the past, touch a stone, if you would capture the\n\nmoment, touch a rose, but if you would glimpse the eternal,\n\nthen touch a life. John Denver, thanks for touching my life\n\nand the lives of family and friends, God bless you.\n\n==========\n\nLynn Twist\n\n==========\n\nSpeech at the Memorial Service for John Denver\n\nOctober 17, 1998\n\nAurora, Colorado\n\nFaith Presbyterian Church\n\n\"My name is Lynn Twist and John Denver was my friend, our\n\nfriend. My husband, Bill and I knew John for almost twenty\n\nfive years, about half of our life. We can't image the\n\nworld without John Denver, nor can we imagine life without\n\nhim.\n\nI was talking with another friend, Ras Gracie, and he talked\n\nabout what it meant to have John as your friend and I want to\n\nsay a little bit about that.\n\nWhen John was your friend, you had immense power, not because he was a celebrity and was known all over the world, but because he believed in you, he believed in his friends. If you shared your dreams with him, it became his dream too. He stood for the highest and the best in all of us and called on us to\n\nexpress it and held us to account for it. I worked with John\n\nfor the last 20 years in The Hunger Project, an organization\n\nand global movement that he co-founded twenty years ago that\n\nis dedicated to ending world hunger. The President of the\n\nHunger Project, Joan Holmes, could not be here today, but\n\nasked me to send a message for her which I will read in a\n\nmoment. But Joan Holmes and I - we forged the Hunger Project\n\nwhich is now a worldwide movement of millions and millions of\n\npeople. We forged that with the magic of our friend, John\n\nDenver and his capacity to believe in us, the people of Hunger\n\nProject and the highest aspirations and best qualities of\n\npeople all over the world. I speak here on behalf of Joan\n\nHolmes and the millions and millions of participants in the\n\nHunger Project around the world when I say twenty years ago\n\nJohn Denver took a stand for a world where all people would\n\nhave a chance to live a healthy and productive life - a hunger\n\nfree world - a world in harmony with nature. At a time when\n\nmost people had no idea of the extent of hunger on this\n\nplanet, much less that they could make any difference in\n\nending it, along with his fellow founders, John created the\n\nHunger Project. John was a tireless spokesperson for our\n\nwork. He sang for the Hunger Project. He invested money in\n\nthe Hunger Project. He raised money for the Hunger Project. He\n\ntraveled with us to Africa. He traveled with us to India. He\n\nwalked through the slums of Bombay with us. He served on the\n\nBoard of Directors with us. He visited and honored Hunger\n\nProject volunteers around the world. He testified before\n\nCongress on the issue of hunger for hunger legislation. He\n\nwrote songs for the end of hunger. He used his public image\n\nto bring attention to the issue of hunger time and time again\n\nover these twenty years. People followed John's example. He\n\ngave them hope. He gave them strength. He gave them\n\ninspiration. From the poorest African farmer to the slum\n\ndweller in India, to the wealthiest investor in the United\n\nStates, Europe or Japan, John Denver demonstrated what it\n\nmeans to have a vision and be committed to it, and be willing\n\nto work sustainably and untiringly to make it a reality. John\n\ngave us all, including the billion hungry people on this\n\nearth, a voice so eloquent, so true, so authentic, that the\n\nworld had to stop and listen. In the midst of our own sadness\n\nand loss, we in the Hunger Project are committed to finding\n\nwithin ourselves the immense gratitude for John's life and the\n\nmagnitude of his contribution to our world. We celebrate his\n\nlife and his greatness and we rededicate here today, ourselves\n\nto fulfilling our shared dream and vision and his own personal\n\nplanet - the end of hunger on this planet.\n\nNow I want to read a quote from another dear friend, Neil\n\nRogan, who was with my husband, Bill Twist, and John, the day\n\nthat he died playing golf. They had a great day.\n\n\"It is said, and John believed that the earth, Gaia,\n\nis actually a living and conscious being and if you\n\nlisten carefully, you can hear her singing. And if\n\nthat's true, she is clearly singing a John Denver\n\nsong.\"\n\nJohn was a man with the soul of a poet and the voice of an\n\nangel. His songs have moved billions of people and changed\n\nmillions of minds.\n\nThey have this power because they are beautiful and they are\n\ntrue and whether they speak of our injustice and insanity or\n\nour love and our humanity, they give expression to the common\n\nyearnings of the human heart in a race for the moment, the\n\nillusion that we are separate from each other and from life.\n\nI know I speak for everyone when I say how blessed we have\n\nbeen to have him here with us - and by \"here\" I mean Planet\n\nEarth, and by \"us\" I mean the human family. God bless you,\n\nJohn, and thank you for including all of us in a life so fully\n\nexpressed. Thank you.\n\n=================\n\nRon Deutschendorf\n\n=================\n\nSpeech at the Aurora, CO\n\nMemorial Service for John Denver\n\nOctober 17, 1997\n\nFaith Presbyterian Church\n\n\"My name is Ron Deutschendorf. A lot of people have told you\n\nabout what a good man my brother is. I say is, because he is\n\nmy brother. The only thing that has changed is that he is\n\nonly with me in spirit now instead of on a golf course, where\n\nwe'd like to be or flying in one of his planes. He was a\n\ntypical big brother, antagonizing me at every opportunity.\n\nI tried to get back at him, if I was the first one up, Dad\n\nwould tell me to wake him up and I would hit him as hard as I\n\ncould with a pillow and he would catch me, but not until I\n\nwould get just into dad's view....but he, of course, got back\n\nat me, pretty much ever since!\n\nMy son had gotten hurt, I had told him about it and John was\n\nvery excited and happy and things were coming back around, he\n\nwas just so happy and about a week later, I was out of town\n\nand he called again and on our answering machine it says \"Hi,\n\nyou have reached the Deutschendorf's and our mission is\n\nfulfilled...John, of course, left a message and because I feel\n\nhe is not only my brother I want to share this with all of you\n\nnow:\"\n\nJohn's voice on tape: \"Goin' back to your own\n\nplanet huh?....(John laughs heartily)....This is John\n\ncallin', just checking in, wanted to see how your boys\n\ndoing....(more laughter)\"\n\nI tried, in choosing the music for today's ceremony, through\n\nthe help of his many friends, we tried to pick songs that\n\nwould communicate how he felt about this specifically. I\n\nchose this next song to show how he felt about his fans, his\n\naudience and his friends, his family and I think it especially\n\napplies, because it certainly applies to how I feel and I'm\n\nsure how many of you do. I want to thank all of you for your\n\nkindness and I hope everyone will help pick up the\n\nresponsibility. I know you are here John, I love you.\"\n\nAnnie Denver transcription from TV\n\n==============================================\n\nAnnie Denver on Private Eye With Bryant Gumbel\n\n==============================================\n\nBryant - Introduction:\n\nAs many of you already know, John Denver was killed Sunday\n\nwhen he crashed his plane off the northern coast of\n\nCalifornia. He is survived by three children and by Annie\n\nDenver, his ex-wife who he always said was the love of his\n\nlife. She is with us live, grieving in Aspen, Colorado.\n\nBryant: Annie, Good Evening.\n\nAnnie: Good Evening, Bryant.\n\nBryant: How are you and Zachary and Anna Kate doing?\n\nAnnie: I think it comes and goes. It's been really tough\n\n(her voice breaking), but if you've ever been\n\nthrough something like this before it's like you don't have\n\na choice. You go through it and it is just really\n\nunbelievable.\n\nBryant: Though you divorced some time ago, you and John\n\nremained the best of friends. How do you explain that?\n\nAnnie: Well, it's sort of an interesting story. I wouldn't\n\nsay we were the best of friends. Because when people get\n\ndivorced they divorce for various reasons but the thing,\n\nBryant, that I feel really good about and I think that our\n\nchildren feel good about is that when the crunch came for\n\nboth of us over time that we were always there for each\n\nother. And I learned a lot about forgiveness in my\n\nrelationship with John, and our relationship really covered\n\nthe gamut of a lot of different emotions and a lot of\n\ndifferent stages of life. It's been a real gift for me and\n\neven more so now. I really get that.\n\nBryant: He was a very romantic guy. I think you could listen\n\nto his songs and know that...\n\nAnnie:\n\nVery romantic guy...\n\nBryant:\n\nAnd yet you have referred to him as a very complex man; a\n\nman who was lonely a lot.\n\nAnnie:\n\nI think John grew up longing for something. He grew up in a\n\nfamily and he was very loved but there was a lot of moving\n\naround. He was in the Air Force and he was sort of an odd\n\nlittle kid. He said that playing a guitar was the way he\n\nmade friends and I think people tended to simplify John\n\nbecause of the simplicity and eloquence of his music. But\n\nthat he was a very complex man. There was a very sad, sad\n\npart in John and it's really the part that the music came\n\nfrom. Is that understandable?\n\nBryant:\n\nYes, it's very understandable. He found solace in his music\n\nand he found expression in his music.\n\nAnnie:\n\nThat's right.\n\nBryant:\n\nLet me talk to you a little bit about....\n\n(Sensing that Annie had something to say he said)\n\n..Go ahead.\n\nAnnie:\n\nOne of the things I had said before, John was a romantic in\n\nthe very best sense of the word and the world can be hard on\n\nromantics. I think as he got older he became much more\n\nrealistic in terms of what his life was about and I think he\n\nhad settled into something, Bryant. I think the biggest\n\nthing that I feel good about and that the kids feel good\n\nabout, and that his friends feel good about is that he was\n\nfeeling really good about himself the day he died. He was\n\nexcited. He had played golf on Spyglass and played well and\n\nhad had just a really great day. And he had had some real\n\ngood conversations with people he cared about in the weeks\n\nprior to his death. He went out full throttle it sounds\n\nlike. He would have liked that, by the way.\n\nBryant: Oh, he would have. I know he would have. Let me ask\n\nyou something; a couple of quick questions about his flying.\n\nAnnie: OK\n\nBryant: He walked away from one airplane accident in 1989 in\n\nArizona. Did he ever express to you any of his own concerns\n\nabout safety in the air?\n\nAnnie:\n\nNo - Not to me. But then we had been divorced by then so he\n\nmay have to other people. John was pretty fearless. I\n\nguess what I'd like people to know too was that John wasn't\n\nafraid to die. He talked a lot about death and he talked\n\nabout.. He had a whole philosophy in terms of....\n\n(John's \"High Flight\" is playing in the background)...\n\nHmm...I'm listening to music. Umm.... He wasn't afraid and he\n\nreally lived his life 100 percent. You know there aren't a\n\nlot of people who do that. I would say that I don't think\n\nJohn had any regrets. I really don't.\n\nBryant: Let me ask you this. It's come to light that the FAA\n\nhad asked John to stop flying a year ago after learning he\n\nhad been involved in two alcohol-related auto accidents. He\n\ndidn't respond to several certified letters asking him to\n\nvoluntarily surrender his FAA Medical Certificate. How\n\ncome?\n\nAnnie: Do you know what, Bryant? I don't know anything about\n\nthat. I'm not the person to ask. Other people that fly\n\nwith him or other people in his organization could answer\n\nthat better than I can. I don't really know and you know\n\nreally...today... I don't really care.\n\nBryant: He wrote \"Annie's Song\" for you in 1974.\n\nAnnie: Yeah\n\nBryant: Can I assume it was your favorite John Denver song?\n\nAnnie: Actually, it's not. I feel very blessed by the song\n\nand I still cry when I hear it and it's really beautiful\n\nand so many people have used it in their weddings. But\n\nmy favorite John Denver song is a song called \"Perhaps\n\nLove\" that he did with Placido Domingo.\n\nBryant: We'll have to race home and listen to it.\n\nAnnie, it's been a difficult time. You have our sympathy\n\nand our prayers.\n\nAnnie: Bryant, thank you, and can I say one thing?\n\nBryant: You sure can.\n\nAnnie: There has been an incredible outpouring of love for\n\nJohn and support. He would be totally amazed by this. It's\n\nsomething he really has longed for since he was a little\n\nboy and he had gotten bits and pieces of it.\n\nBryant: But he never really knew how much people loved him.\n\nAnnie: He never really got it. And it's all right here for\n\nhim. And, he was a good man, Bryant.\n\nBryant: We know that. Annie, Thanks. Best wishes.\n\nAnnie: You're so welcome.\n\nCASSANDRA - TV INTERVIEW TEXT\n\n============================================\n\nCassandra Delaney Denver on American Journal\n\nFebruary 23, 1998\n\n============================================\n\nCassie: He was a romantic soul... all the flowers and the\n\nbeautiful words and beautiful songs and the poetry.\n\nAJ: At her BelAir home, Cassandra told AJ about her turbulant\n\nmarriage to John Denver, his bouts with depression and\n\nthe day of his tragic death.\n\nCassie: It was, ah, the most devastating moment that I've ever\n\nexperienced.\n\nAJ: 53 year old Denver was killed when an experimental plane\n\nhe was piloting crashed in the waters off Monteray\n\nCalifornia. Ironically, the same day, Denver had\n\narranged for his 8 year old daughter, Jesse, to visit\n\nDisneyland. She'd spent the day at the happiest place\n\non Earth. Hours later she would learn the saddest news\n\nin her young life.\n\nCassie: Of course she was devastated. And it was, ya\n\nknow...broke my heart, and broke her heart.\n\nAJ: For Denver, his daughter Jesse held a special place in his\n\nlife. A year after he married Cassandra at an outdoor\n\nwedding in the summer of 1988, she gave birth to Jesse\n\nin their Rocky Mountain hide-a-way in Aspen, Colorado.\n\nCassie: He, ah, took Jesse out into the world and sang to her\n\nas soon as she was born.\n\nAJ: Since Denver's death, Cassandra, a student in martial\n\narts, has reportedly been in a nasty fight over\n\nDenver's estate. People magazine reported that\n\naccording to Colorado law, Denver's estate will be\n\ndivided equally among his children and \"this is not\n\nsitting well with Denver's second ex-wife and the\n\nmother of Jesse Belle, Cassandra Delaney\".\n\nCassie: (with a smug little smile on her face) I'm deeply\n\noffended and hurt and enraged by the whole situation.\n\nI have no interest in taking over John's estate.\n\nAnother segment includes AJ taking Cassie to Aspen;\n\nmeeting the mayor and how John taught Cassie to ski\n\nand love the wilderness.\n\nAJ: But here in the spectacular Rocky Mountains the Denver\n\nmarriage went downhill. Why do you think your marriage\n\nended?\n\nCassie: Things got difficult. And, and, ya know, we found it\n\ndifficult to communicate to each other. The resentment\n\nstarts to build up...\n\nAJ: 3 years after they married,Cassandra and Denver seperated.\n\nThey divorced 2 years later, amid reports of Denver's\n\nheavy drinking and two arrests for drunk driving. Was he\n\nan alcoholic?\n\nCassie: John was a workoholic, not an alcoholic! He, um, he\n\nworked so much, he gave so much. And, yes, he loved to\n\ndrink.\n\nAJ: It was never something that you thought was a problem?\n\nCassie: No. I mean, there were many times when John gave up\n\ndrinking for months on end. And, ah, then there were\n\nmany times when he drank, ya know, his fair share.\n\nAJ: In public this gifted guitarist who gave the world songs\n\nlike \"Rocky Mountain High\", gave no hint how low he felt\n\nin private. After years at the top of the charts, his\n\nnew music wasn't popular anymore, and, according to\n\nCassandra, he was battling severe depression.\n\nCassie: I think it was depressing for him, ya know, to not\n\nhave his music played anymore on the radio. Because his\n\nmusic was still just as good.\n\nAJ: Athough Denver remained in touch with Cassandra after\n\ntheir divorce, she says they became closer in the months\n\nbefore the deadly crash. For the first time since their\n\ndivorce, Cassandra began wearing the wedding ring Denver\n\nhad given her, and wears it to this day. You\n\nnever stopped loving each other?\n\nCassie: No. We were great sparring partners, but we didn't\n\nstop loving each other-- NO!\n\nAJ: Just two weeks before Denver's death, the former Mrs.\n\nDenver says she phoned him and suggested they get back\n\ntogether for the sake of their daughter, Jesse.\n\nCassie: I realized that I was incredibly sad, that we weren't\n\ntogether for Jesse, and that I still loved him. And, ah,\n\nbut I know he still loved me. And he said, \"I'm just so\n\nproud of you. And I'm so excited for Jesse, because she\n\ndeserves this.\"\n\nAJ: Their reunion never happened. Two weeks later Denver was\n\ndead.\n\nInterviews with fans at the memorial service\n\nAJ: At the church service, Cassandra learned that Denver had\n\nnot forgotten their final phone call. She says that\n\nDenver's friends told her that they had never seen him\n\nhappier than in those last few days of his life. Was\n\nthere anything you felt was left unsaid between you two?\n\nCassie: Oh, I think there was probably a lot of things left\n\nunsaid. But, I'm very grateful that I got to say to him\n\nand tell him how I felt about him.\n\nAJ: For now Cassandra is helping her daughter deal with the\n\nloss of her famous father. And there's one story\n\nCassandra will never forget about her late husband: a\n\nconversation about a plane crash that now\n\nseems hauntingly prophetic.\n\nCassie: That's how he said he wanted to go. Ya know, like..\n\n\"If I go I hope I go in an airplane\", because his\n\ngreatest joy was being in the air and flying. And so he\n\nwent the way he wanted to go.\n\nAJ: And on Monday, the tallest ski run in the state of\n\nColorado, in Aspen, was named Rocky Mountain High in\n\nhonor of John Denver. A great tribute to a very talented\n\nyoung man!!\n\nFrom Aspen, Colorado, Saturday, October 18, 1997\n\n\"A Celebration: The Life of John Denver\"\n\n========\n\nTom Crum\n\n========\n\nAspen - Opening\n\nGood afternoon, I'm Tom Crum. On behalf of John Denver's\n\nfamily, his close friends, all the people who have supported\n\nhim over the years, we want to thank you so much for joining\n\nus on a very, very special day - on a day only God and John\n\ncould have created. It's time to celebrate a really great\n\nspirit. You know every so often there walks among us a person\n\nwho truly inspires - who touches us so deeply because of their\n\ngift that the best of us shows up. And that's who it is we\n\nare here to celebrate today. I know there were some people at\n\nthe service yesterday - most of you weren't - so for those of\n\nyou who were, if I tell a few thoughts that I did yesterday, I\n\nknow you'll understand. I think they are important. I know\n\nJohn never minded telling a few stories over again.\n\nOne story specifically is so important because it happened\n\nright here - it happened in Colorado. John Kelleher was a\n\n12-year old boy about 17 years ago who died. He was one of\n\nthe most loved members of this community. My kids went to\n\nschool with him. I know Zak and others went to school with\n\nhim. He did most of his life in a wheelchair and died at the\n\nage of 12. At his memorial service there were tears of\n\nsadness. But when John Denver stood up and spoke, he talked\n\nabout the need to celebrate the incredible inspiration this\n\nboy was. And he talked about this Halloween night when you\n\ncouldn't keep this young boy down and he went out\n\ntrick-or-treating in his wheelchair as a washing machine. Now\n\nI've got to tell you something - we've recently talked to John\n\nKelleher's father, John Kelleher, and we asked him about the\n\nincident. And he said \"No, that's not true, Tom, he didn't go\n\nas a washing machine.\" I went \"Oh, no.\"\n\nHe said he went as a phone booth and then he said he went as a\n\nrace car. \"Then I think he went as a - \" and I said \"It's\n\nO.K., a washing machine will do.\"\n\nJohn's ability to make sure that we commit to life, that we\n\ncommit to celebrating what's important was there - and that's\n\nwhat we are here to do today. And we couldn't do it in a\n\nbetter place. This place was John's home, with the outdoors.\n\nJohn loved a campfire, he loved to have people around. His\n\nlink to indigenous cultures was so strong - for the American\n\nIndians sitting around in council and just telling the truth.\n\nThat's what he was about. That's what he sang about. And\n\nthat's what we are here to do today - it's poems, it's\n\nprayers, it's promises - to a great spirit.\n\nJohn blossomed in weather like this. When John was in these\n\nmountains I mean that was the spirit he married. It didn't\n\nmatter where he was - flying or swimming or fishing or\n\nwhatever he did. As I mentioned yesterday, jumping off cliffs,\n\nit's the grottos, you know, Devil's Punchbowl, a 30-foot\n\nhigh cliff. We jumped but John dived and John always said\n\n\"Going head first is safer.\" He did. I never understood it.\n\nJohn went full on, didn't he? He was full on everything he\n\ndid. People who are here, people you will see today, some of\n\nthem will play music for you today, there's people who\n\ntraveled with him for years, his family who lived with him. I\n\nmentioned it yesterday John wanted to do everything and he\n\ndarned near did everything. And he made a mess out of us in\n\nthe process. He really went for it, absolutely went for it in\n\nlife. The guys in the band, all of them are here, and the guys\n\nwho sang in groups with him that are here today, so many of\n\nthem. You know what those tours were like. We had a tour with\n\nhim and we did 80 some cities in 90 some days. We called it\n\nthe tour from hell. John was great. We were a mess. Now\n\nJohn's gone. He's still great. He's fine. We're still a mess.\n\nThe thought occurred to me that we're still on tour. We did\n\nsomething in Denver yesterday and we're here today.\n\n(laughter) Full throttle...as Annie said. You've skied with\n\nJohn - so many of you have skied with John. If you skied with\n\nhim when he was on those full throttle days. I guarantee you\n\nhis speed of skiing far exceeded his level of skill.\n\n(laughter) His wipeouts could block out the sun for days.\n\nWe skied behind him a lot because of that. Anna Kate and Zak\n\nknow that he wore those ridiculous yellow ski pants and that\n\ngreen and pink hat cause I don't think John really cared what\n\nhe looked like and what equipment he had on. He just wanted\n\nto be up there. You just didn't want to be in front of him.\n\nLike riding a bicycle down Independence Pass in front of a\n\nMayflower Moving Van. We want to keep it light today because\n\nJohn would want to keep it serious and there was a truth in\n\nthe seriousness of him. What a man this was - what an\n\nincredible spirit. And you know when I mentioned skiing. He\n\ndidn't just ski fast. He loved to take beginner skiers up\n\nthere. John was never more happy than when he was taking\n\nJesse Belle skiing. He also.......somebody told me yesterday\n\nthat today would be much easier....but I know also that he was\n\nnever more happy than when he tucked you in at night. I know\n\nthat Jesse Belle. I know what that meant for him. He was\n\nsuch an incredible man. He really lived life fully and\n\nintensely. He appreciated life. Back here on the backside of\n\nAspen Mountain one year we were doing some back country skiing\n\nand our guide said...\"You know, this is a very dangerous\n\nslope. Whatever you do - don't fall.\" If that isn't the\n\ngoofiest thing to say: Don't fall. Well, I got down and\n\nlooked up and there was John. He took two turns and he fell\n\nand the whole thing slid and now he's got tons of snow; he's\n\nmoving about 30 miles an hour. He's past us but his head is\n\nup. He's swimming. He's there. He's calm. You couldn't\n\nbelieve this man. He was so committed to life. His eyes were a\n\nlot bigger than normal, but he was there. He was so right\n\nthere. Scuba diving - we were out with the hump back whales\n\nin the 70's and his scuba diving equipment failed at about 85\n\nfeet down and we were with the hump backs and he was so calm,\n\nso fully committed all the way. That's how he lived. He was\n\nthere for me. I mentioned yesterday...I won't mention it other\n\nthan to say that he pulled me out of deep snow when we were\n\nhelicopter skiing up in British Columbia. Bottom line...he\n\nwas there for his friends...absolutely there for his friends\n\nwhen they needed him. And not just any friend - you all who\n\nlived here in Aspen, I guarantee you that if you were stuck\n\nsomewhere, stranded somewhere and I don't care how late at\n\nnight if he drove by, he wouldn't drive by. He'd stop. He'd\n\nhelp you out. There was a fan who inappropriately came up to\n\nJohn's house and sort of invaded his privacy. John was very\n\nnice about saying \"You know, we'd like to have a little\n\nprivate times\" and then he noticed the guy had a flat tire and\n\nhe went out and changed the guy's flat tire. This is who we\n\nare dealing with. We all know his major contributions but I\n\nthink it is so important to know about him as a human and to\n\ncelebrate that incredible generosity and kindness.\n\nLitter - you know how he was about litter. He'd pick up trash\n\nwherever it was. On the golf course, you guys who played golf\n\nwith him know that he'd be rushing off into the fairway and\n\nthen off into the rough to find trash. He was in the rough a\n\nlot. A lot of you were parents on that Squirt hockey team\n\nthat won the state A championships. Zak and my son - Carter,\n\nthere were a bunch of people, there are probably a bunch of\n\nparents that are here today. I don't know if you remember\n\nthat. Now you've got to understand this was Squirt Hockey - 9\n\nand 10 year olds. It was a big day. We were in Colorado\n\nSprings. It was a huge arena and there was no one in there but\n\nus - 30 odd parents - 50 odd parents - but dog gone it if John\n\ndoesn't stand up and sing the National Anthem. He was just\n\nthere. He just sang it. And then we won and then we went out\n\nto dinner and John would always buy dinner for his friends but\n\nhe bought dinner for the whole team and the parents and\n\neverybody in the darn restaurant.\n\nJohn was an artist. You know that in his music. I don't know\n\nif you've seen his photographs. They were beautiful -\n\nexquisite. By artist I mean that he appreciated beauty. He\n\nappreciated beauty. And this is to Anna Kate, nothing\n\ninspired him more, nothing made him prouder than when we saw\n\nyou dance. He knew beauty. He appreciated art. He appreciated\n\nwhen he saw flowers - anything - his eyes just got wide with\n\nthe beauty. He was an artist. And he was a spirit that will\n\nbe sorely missed. John suffered. I think I mentioned that\n\nyesterday. I think we all suffer and have pain. But John had\n\nthis struggle between the part of him that was the human\n\ncondition and this incredible spirit that sang for people;\n\nthat communicated in a way that inspired people; that gave so\n\nmuch whether it was to the hungry or to the environment. He\n\nhad that. In fact he even struggled here in Aspen because\n\nmaybe there were some misperceptions from time to time about\n\nit. He loved it here. He used to think about buying a second\n\nhome in Carmel. He loved it in Carmel. Actually it was the\n\nthird home. I think his second home was the court house.\n\nBut I'll tell you what and I think this is the main thing that\n\nI'd like to say that no matter what it was that was going on\n\nwith John he really stood up for life and the living. He stood\n\nup for the environment. He stood up for hunger and he stood up\n\nfor peace. He did it when people didn't care. It was amazing.\n\nNot only was he just presenting, not only was he singing. You\n\ncould be in a place in Washington, D.C. You could be at a\n\nconference or something and he wasn't even presenting and I'd\n\nlook over at him and I'd go \"Oh, my God, he's going to stand\n\nup.\" And I'd go \"I wonder what he's going to say. I hope it's\n\nappropriate.\" But you know what - it was always appropriate.\n\nHe always made a difference. And I know that that emptiness\n\ninside of us that we feel - that emptiness inside of us gets\n\nfilled every time we stand up for what we believe. Every time\n\nwe stand up for who we are and for issues like children,\n\nhunger or the environment, or peace then we fill up. And I\n\nknow that when that happens then John's spirit really sings\n\nout and it does it again and again.\n\nYesterday at the service Joe Henry came up here and read\n\nsomething and I want him to do it again. Joe, where are you?\n\nJoe Henry is a dear friend. Joe Henry - his lyrics - is an\n\ninspiration. He's a story teller. He's a poet. John sings\n\nthat music so well.\n\n..... (Joe Henry speaks) ....\n\nFor Joe and I - we know that John's presence is here. We feel\n\nthat. I know you feel that. In fact it's also in the mountains\n\nand the sky. We know it is in the streams and in the woods.\n\nAnd we were so blessed by having John Denver in our lives. We\n\nloved John Denver....God bless you.\n\nJoe Henry...\"the same for me\"\n\n==========\n\nJoe Henry\n\n=========\n\nSpeech at \"A Celebration: The Life of John Denver\"\n\nOctober 18, 1997\n\nAspen, Colorado\n\nI'm afraid I'm not a speaker but John was part of my heart and\n\nwhat I became was kind of in a league with him. I think that\n\nall of us on a physical plane are hearts and then the\n\nnon-physical plane are our souls. I think living with the kind\n\nof heart that he lived with is a great example and I think\n\nthat everybody has their days to do that and I think that the\n\nsoul is endless. And I think the soul is always and everywhere\n\nand what happens is a change of form and I can't imagine that\n\nhe goes away. I think he has just changed his form and I\n\nthink that's all of us. I've got a lyric that he really liked\n\nthat we didn't have time to make a song out of it but its\n\ncalled ascension.\n\nAscension\n\nThe stars they call. They beckon me to follow\n\nThey seem to say there's something more to find\n\nAnd like a fool I'm driven by a hunger\n\nThat leaves me lost with nothing to call mine.\n\nAnd so my past returns, drifting through the darkness,\n\nthe branches tear across my face and hands,\n\nThe stars wink down, they say you're bound to find us.\n\nI climb alone - a solitary man,\n\nBut I will rise, I'm almost flying,\n\nI come from earth, I love the sea\n\nand I will fly I feel me rising\n\nI'll climb beyond a climbers need to be\n\nand so I watch the eagles soar above me\n\nHe dips his wing and bids me to go on\n\nand I follow him, I watch him like a beacon\n\ninto the east we face the rising sun\n\nthe skies a flame there is blood accross the mountains\n\nthe shadows fall and fill the earth below\n\nI take a step and rest and take another\n\nOn stronger winds I soar above the cold.\"\n\nTom Crum speaks again...\n\nFor Joe and I - we know that John's presence is here.\n\nWe feel that. I know you feel that. In fact it's also\n\nin the mountains and the sky. We know it is in the\n\nstreams and in the woods.\n\nAnd we were so blessed by having John Denver in our\n\nlives. We loved John Denver....God bless you.\n\nJoe Henry...\"the same for me\"\n\n=============\n\nPat O'Donnell\n\n=============\n\nSpeech at \"A Celebration: The Life of John Denver\"\n\nOctober 18, 1997\n\nAspen, Colorado\n\nHello. My name is Pat O'Donnell. I've been in Aspen only for\n\na few years but during that time it's been long enough to\n\nexperience a number of John Denver's goodnesses. Whether it\n\nwas a Charity event, an environmental cause, or an opportunity\n\nto share the beauty of Aspen with the rest of the world John\n\nwas always willing to help.\n\nWe were preparing for a concert on the gondola plaza.\n\nHe said \"I'm sure it will be more well attended than you\n\nexpect\" and he said. \"I don't think so\". He said \"Why don't\n\nwe get a nice stage.\" He said: \"No, I don't want a stage.\"\n\nI said: \"How about a tent\"\n\n\"No tents.\" How about if we put you at least on top of the\n\ngondola stairs and he said \"I don't think too many people are\n\ngoing to be there. Let's put it in the middle of the stairs.\n\nAll I want is a great sound system and I want to be close to\n\nthe people.\" Well, we guestimated that between one to two\n\nthousand and for those of you who weren't there they even had\n\nhalf of Grant street completely blocked. He sang songs that\n\nnight about Colorado, about the Christmas holidays and about\n\nthe mountains in general. You couldn't fit another person\n\nthere not even in the Gondola. It was a very cold night. I\n\nremember that and being close to him and enjoying his music\n\nand he was just starting to pack up his guitar with his\n\nfingers really frozen when the crowd called out \"one more\",\n\n\"one more\" and what they wanted to hear was \"Rocky Mountain\n\nHigh.\"\n\nAnd just now the Aspen Steam Company are finishing what is\n\ngoing to be the highest lift in North America which is the one\n\nat Snowmass, we feel that it is only fitting, with his\n\nfamily's prior approval, to dedicate the highest run in North\n\nAmerica to John and call it \"Rocky Mountain High.\"\n\nA plaque will be placed at the top of the run in his memory\n\nbecause we feel there isn't a better place to remember John\n\nand the feelings he was trying to express with his songs.\n\nThank you.\n\n=================\n\nRon Deutschendorf\n\n=================\n\nSpeech at \"A Celebration: The Life of John Denver\"\n\nOctober 18, 1997\n\nAspen, Colorado\n\nMy name's Ron and I'm John's brother and I may of course as\n\nTom said earlier, retell something that I said yesterday. At\n\nthis moment in time I can't quite remember what I said\n\nyesterday. I would say that John loved Aspen, Colorado, and\n\nhe always felt that this was his home. There were times when\n\nI didn't agree with that. The last couple of years I don't\n\nthink everybody treated him that well. But he loved Aspen.\n\nHe loved all the people here - friends and family - and I\n\nthink he would be very proud. I know he is very proud of\n\nZachary, Anna Kate and Jesse Belle for organizing this so that\n\nsome of his friends and ourselves could acknowledge him today.\n\nHe was a typical big brother; pretty much obnoxious most of\n\nthe time. He loved to get my goat and those of you who knew\n\nus well knew that we had an incredible sibling rivalry.\n\nUsually it was acted out in the golf course on these days, or\n\nearlier it was go-carts or just anything that there could be\n\ncompetition at. We would have incredible competition. In\n\nJune John had called me to see if I could play golf and\n\nas usual it was the night before, the tee off time was early\n\nand I was at least 2 hours away. I said \"Sure, I'll come.\n\nI'll be there.\" So I got up and I drove and I made it just in\n\ntime to lace my shoes up on the first tee and John\n\nsaid...\"Well, did you go by the club house?\" I said \"No\". He\n\nsaid \"Shoot. I left a twenty dollar bill up there with a\n\nnote.\" I said \"What did the note say?\" ....\"It said: \"You\n\nshould buy some balls. You're probably going to need them.\"\n\n(laughter) That was my brother.\n\nWell, we played and golfed around and I won the first side and\n\nwe had enormous bets (usually a dollar). I was losing on the\n\nbackside which was going to make him win on the Eighteenth.\n\nSo we got up to the eighteenth tee and I shot my ball straight\n\ndown the middle, and then John got up and addressed the ball.\n\n\"John, you haven't outdriven me all day, have you?\n\nWell, John addressed the ball and he concentrated and he\n\nconcentrated and then he hit it right out of bounds. I said\n\n\"Hey, John, let me get you another ball. I think you're going\n\nto NEED it.\"\n\nI, like everyone else here celebrate John's life. I knew he\n\nwas a good father, and he was a very good man. He was a great\n\nbrother and a so-so golfer, but a great brother. And because\n\nthis is his home and family and friends and though I did it\n\nyesterday I feel as though I have to do it today.\n\nJohn called my house a couple of weeks back and we had a\n\nlittle discussion. My oldest son had gotten hurt a couple of\n\nweeks back and I was telling him all about it. Then we\n\nstarted talking business and he was really happy and he felt\n\nlike his life was coming back around and he felt that it was\n\nas good as it had been in some time. About a week later, I was\n\nout of town and he called again and on our answering machine\n\nit says\n\n\"Hi, you have reached the Deutschendorf's and our mission\n\nis on earth is over now so we're beaming back to our own\n\nplanet. If you'd like to leave a message, please do so.\"\n\nThis was John's response and for me, I'm blessed it will\n\nalways be the last way I heard his voice. And I want to\n\nshare it with you all:\n\nJohn's voice on tape: \"Goin' back to your own\n\nplanet huh?....(John laughs heartily)....This is John\n\ncallin', To see how your boy is doing....\n\n(more laughter)\"\n\nTom was correct and all the rest of us I'm sure - friends and\n\nfamily - feel pretty much the same. John is here with us. I\n\nknow he will always be with me. He is with me and he'll be\n\nwith my Mom and Zach, and Anna Kate and Jesse Belle. When you\n\ngo outside in those hills, he'll be around. I love you John.\n\n============\n\nAnnie Denver\n\n============\n\nSpeech at \"A Celebration: The Life of John Denver\"\n\nOctober 18, 1997\n\nAspen, Colorado\n\nI'm Annie Denver and as Ron and Tommy said earlier I may\n\nrepeat a few things that some of you may have heard me say in\n\nthe past few days. Last night Mike Taylor came in who I met\n\nwith John in 1968 and Mike was a long time friend of John's\n\nand a guitar player and he shared a story with me that I'd\n\nlike to talk about today because I think it is very meaningful\n\nin terms of John's life and in terms of his death.\n\nJohn described himself as sort of a geeky kid that didn't\n\nalways fit in and he moved around a lot and as his song \"This\n\nOld Guitar\" talks about he used his music and his love of his\n\nguitar that his grandmother gave him to make friends. Mike\n\nand John were on the road one day in Texas and John took Mike\n\nby the house where he threw a party and nobody came. His\n\nmother had gotten potato chips and dip and set up tables and\n\nnobody came. (With tears in her voice)....John, everybody's\n\nhere for you today.\n\nAs Tommy said, there was a struggle within John,\n\nbetween the love he felt he could give the world and the love\n\nhe gave his friends and family. There was also an incredible\n\nsadness and it was really where the music came from. I think\n\nJohn would be so, so surprised that so many people came out\n\nand so many people from all over the world. He got it on one\n\nlevel and on another level I don't think he quite...he never\n\nquite let it all in. The last conversation I had with John\n\nwas a week before he died and he called me because he had been\n\nwith Zach at the Broncos game and he called to tell me how\n\nproud he was of Zach and how great he felt Zach was doing.\n\nActually he made this call.... He had just had dinner with\n\nAnna Kate and he called me to tell me how much he loved her.\n\nJohn and I grew up together. We had gone through a lot of hard\n\nchanges...through being very much in love and raising a family\n\nand connecting and the world opened up and we were together\n\nand he became a star. You all know the story. But the truth\n\nis we had been divorced for a long time and one of the gifts\n\nthat John gave me was the ability...and I think we gave each\n\nother...was this ability to go through a lot of different\n\nemotions - anger - hang up on each other on the phone - come\n\nback together - but that bottom line is that he was always\n\nthere for me and...(emotion in her voice)....he's not 'here'\n\nanymore.\n\nThe last thing of every year I always got a bouquet\n\nof flowers from John on my birthday and it always said \"I love\n\nyou\". I hadn't spoken to him since September and we were\n\nhaving the conversation about the kids and I said...\"John, you\n\nknow it is so wonderful of you to send me those flowers every\n\nyear on my birthday\" and he just sort of paused and very\n\nsoftly said....\"Oh, but, Annie...I love you.\"\n\nAnd I want you to know that I love you John and you'd be so\n\nhappy today . This is all for you and I hope you're really at\n\npeace and in God's grace. Thank you.\n\n===========\n\nPaul Winter\n\n===========\n\nSpeech at \"A Celebration: The Life of John Denver\"\n\nOctober 18, 1997\n\nAspen, Colorado\n\nI'm Paul Winter. It's an honor to be here. A couple of nights\n\nago I was walking in the moonlight in the corn back in\n\nConnecticut thinking a lot about John and reflecting on all of\n\nthe times that our paths have crossed over the past 30 years.\n\nI recalled something that he had said to me from those times\n\nthat I found very encouraging. He told me that my album from\n\nthe late 70's was one of his favorite albums of all times.\n\nThen it struck me: \"Icarus\". There is a little song from that\n\nalbum titled \"Icarus\" after the Greek myth about the first man\n\nwho tried to fly. He soared off the cliff on wings made from\n\nwax and feathers and as he flew higher and higher in ecstasy\n\nthe sun started to melt the wax on his wings and he fell into\n\nthe sea. I stopped in my tracks remembering that and I knew\n\nthen that I had to try to find a way then to be here this\n\nafternoon to play \"Icarus\" for John. May his spirit soar ever\n\nhigher and higher for eternity.\n\nThe song...........\"Icarus\""
