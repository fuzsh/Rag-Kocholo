Rocky Mountain high.\n\nHe climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below,\n\nhe saw everything as far as you can see.\n\nAnd they say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun,\n\nand he lost a friend, but kept the memory.\n\nNow he walks in quiet solitude, the forest and the streams, seeking grace in every step he takes.\n\nHis sight is turned inside himself, to try and understand\n\nthe serenity of a clear blue mountain lake.\n\nAnd the Colorado Rocky Mountain high, I’ve seen it raining fire in the sky.\n\nYou can talk to God and listen to the casual reply.\n\nRocky Mountain high, Colorado. Rocky Mountain high.\n\nNow his life is full of wonder, but his heart still knows some fear,\n\nof a simple thing he can not comprehend.\n\nWhy they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more,\n\nmore people, more scars upon the land.\n\nAnd the Colorado Rocky Mountain high, I’ve seen it raining fire in the sky.\n\nI know he’d be a poor man if he never saw an eagle fly,\n\nRocky Mountain high, the Colorado Rocky Mountain high, I’ve seen it raining fire in the sky.\n\nFriends around the campfire and everybody’s high\n\nRocky Mountain high, Colorado. Rocky Mountain high.\n\nRocky Mountain high, Colorado. Rocky Mountain high.\n\n(written by Denver/Taylor)\n\nI’m Sorry\n\nIt’s cold here in the city, it always seems that way,\n\nand I’ve been thinking about you almost every day.\n\nThinking about the good times, thinking about the rain.\n\nThinking about how bad it feels alone again.\n\nI’m sorry for the way things are in China, I’m sorry things ain’t what they used to be.\n\nMore than anything else, I’m sorry for myself cause you’re not here with me.\n\nOur friends all ask about you, I say you’re doing fine. I expect to hear from you almost anytime.\n\nThey all know I’m crying, and I can’t sleep at night. They all know I’m dying down deep inside.\n\nI’m sorry for all the lies I told you, I’m sorry for the things I didn’t say.\n\nBut more than anything else, I’m sorry for myself. I can’t believe you went away.\n\nI’m sorry if I took some things for granted, I’m sorry for the chains I put on you.\n\nBut more than anything else, I’m sorry for myself for living without you.\n\n(written by John Denver)\n\nFly Away\n\nAll of her days have gone soft and cloudy, all of her dreams have gone dry.\n\nAll of her nights have gone sad and shady, She’s getting ready to fly.\n\nFly away, fly away, fly away.\n\nLife in the city can make you crazy for sounds of the sand and the sea.\n\nLife in a high-rise can make you hungry for things that you can’t even see.\n\nFly away, fly away, fly away.\n\nIn this whole world there’s nobody as lonely as she,\n\nthere’s nowhere to go and there’s nowhere that she’d rather be.\n\nShe’s looking for lovers and children playing, she’s looking for signs of the spring.\n\nShe listens for laughter and sounds of dancing, she listens for any old thing.\n\nFly away, fly away, fly away .\n\nIn this whole world there’s nobody as lonely as she,\n\nthere’s nowhere to go and there’s nowhere that she’d rather be.\n\nAll of her days have gone soft and cloudy, all of her dreams have gone dry.\n\nAll of her nights have gone sad and shady, She’s getting ready to fly.\n\nFly away, fly away, fly away, fly away.\n\nWhere are my days, where are my nights? Where is the Spring? I wanna fly, I wanna fly…\n\n(written by John Denver)\n\nDreamland Express\n\nI caught a ride on the dreamland express last night, I was sailing on an ocean of blue.\n\nWhen right there by my side, much to my surprise was you.\n\nI said, come on over here baby, let my look in your eyes, let me see the very heart of you.\n\nAnd I couldn’t believe it, to conceive that my dream would come true.\n\nCause you said, hey there, sweet daddy, everything is all right.\n\nFor miles there’s not a telephone line.\n\nThere’s not a soul to disturb us, don’t be nervous, just come and be mine.\n\nYou said, let me be the end of your rainbow, let me be the stars up above.\n\nLet me be the one that you long for, darling, let me be the one that you love, oh,\n\nlet me be the one that you love.\n\nAnd now it’s four in the morning, honey, I can’t sleep. I can’t seem to get you out of my mind.\n\nI keep tossing and turning, yearning for the sun to shine.\n\nI’d like to send you a ticket on the dreamland express, and take you far away with me.\n\nI’ve got a vision of heaven and you’re living there with me.\n\nHoney, let me be the end of your rainbow, let me be the stars up above.\n\nLet me be the one that you long for, darling, let me be the one that you love, oh,\n\nlet me be the one that you love, oh, let me be the one that you love.\n\n(written by John Denver)\n\nHow Can I Leave You Again\n\nIn a spaceship over the mountains, chasing rainbows in the setting sun.\n\nLeaving heart and home for the city of angels, I feel my life is undone.\n\nThere are pathways winding below me, in pleasure I’ve gone where they go.\n\nIn the quiet stillness, I can hear symphonies, the loveliest music I know.\n\nHow can I leave you again? I must be clear out of my mind.\n\nLost in a storm I’ve gone blind, oh, how can I leave you again.\n\nOh, it’s been a long time since I’ve listened, still longer since I’ve walked with you.\n\nFor the first time I know what I’m missing, some answers are no longer true.\n\nSo I question the course that I follow. I’m doubtful and deep in despair.\n\nMy heart is filled with impossible notions, can it be you no longer care?\n\nStill I ride on the winds of a high wind blowing steady and strong behind me.\n\nAs the clouds surrender, my fate is for certain, I’m a sailor who runs to the sea.\n\nHow can I leave you again? I must be clear out of my mind.\n\nLost in a storm I’ve gone blind, oh, how can I leave you again.\n\nHow can I leave you again?

Oh, babe, I hate to go.\n\n(written by John Denver)\n\nWild Montana Skies – Vocal Duet John Denver and Emmylou Harris\n\nHe was born in the Bitteroot Valley in the early morning rain.\n\nWild geese over the water, heading north and home again.\n\nBringing a warm wind from the south, bringing the first taste of the spring.\n\nHis mother took him to her breast, and softly she did sing:\n\nOh Montana, give this child a home.\n\nGive him the love of a good family and a woman of his own.\n\nGive him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes,\n\ngive him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana Skies.\n\nHis mother died that summer and he never learned to cry.\n\nHe never knew his father and he never did ask why.\n\nHe never knew the answers that would make an easy way,\n\nbut he learned to know the wilderness and to be a man that way.\n\nHis mother’s brother took him in to his family and his home,\n\ngave him a hand that he could lean on and a strength to call his own.\n\nAnd he learned to be a farmer, and he learned to love the land,\n\nand he learned to read the seasons and he learned to make a stand.\n\nOh Montana, give this child a home.\n\nGive him the love of a good family and a woman of his own.\n\nGive him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes,\n\ngive him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana Skies.\n\nOn the eve of his 21st birthday, he set out on his own.\n\nHe was 30 years and running when he found his way back home.\n\nRiding a storm across the mountains and an aching in his heart,\n\nsaid he came to turn the pages and to make a brand new start.\n\nNow he never told a story of the time that he was gone.\n\nSome say he was a lawyer, some say he was a John.\n\nThere was something in the city that he said he couldn’t breathe,\n\nthere was something in the country that he said he couldn’t leave.\n\nNow some say he was crazy, some are glad he’s gone.\n\nSome of us will miss him and try to carry on,\n\ngiving a voice to the forest, giving a voice to the dawn.\n\nGiving a voice to the wilderness and the land that he lived on.\n\nOh Montana, give this child a home.\n\nGive him the love of a good family and a woman of his own.\n\nGive him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes,\n\ngive him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana Skies.\n\nOh Montana, give this child a home.\n\nGive him the love of a good family and a woman of his own.\n\nGive him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes,\n\ngive him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana Skies.\n\n(written by John Denver)\n\nSome Days Are Diamonds (Some Days Are Stone)\n\nWhen you ask how I’ve been here without you, I like to say I’ve been fine, and I do.\n\nBut we both know the truth is hard to come by. And if I told the truth, that’s not quite true.\n\nSome days are diamonds, some days are stone. Some times the hard times won’t leave me alone.\n\nSome times the cold winds blow a chill in my bones.\n\nSome days are diamonds, some days are stone.\n\nNow the face that I see in my mirror, more and more is a stranger to me.\n\nMore and more I can see there’s a danger in becoming what I never thought I’d be.\n\nSome days are diamonds, some days are stone. Some times the hard times won’t leave me alone.\n\nSome times the cold winds blow a chill in my bones.\n\nSome days are diamonds, some days are stone.\n\nSome days are diamonds, some days are stone. Some times the hard times won’t leave me alone.\n\nSome times the cold winds blow a chill in my bones.\n\nSome days are diamonds, some days are stone.\n\n(written by Feller)"
