        "text": "Erma Deutschendorf Davis, mother of the late folk singer John Denver, died at an Aurora care facility Sunday. She was 87. She had suffered health problems since a fall in November, said her son, Ron Deutsch endorf.\n\nServices for Davis, who lived in Aurora for 30 years, will be Sunday at 2 p.m. at Faith Presbyterian Church in Aurora, 11373 E. Alameda Ave. Viewing will be at Newcomer Funeral Home, east chapel, 190 Potomac St., from 4 to 8 p.m. both Friday and Saturday.\n\nDavis had a recording of every song her son performed. “You always make sure your mom has a copy of everything,” said Davis’ son, who lives in San Diego.\n\nDenver’s mother and father often went to concerts he gave, especially in other countries, giving them a chance for a trip, said Ron Deutschendorf.\n\nA few years ago, Davis and two of her women friends went to Branson, Mo., to hear a singer perform John Denver songs.\n\n“She was feisty and full of life,” said her longtime friend Jody Fleck of Denver.\n\n“But you’d have to have an angel on your shoulder when you rode with her because she liked to drive 90 miles an hour,” Fleck said.\n\nShe also loved pecan-roll candy bars and bought $63 worth of them to bring back from Branson. When she went to her condo in Las Vegas, she and friends sought out bingo parlors.\n\nDavis had no interest in sports, but when a local Mexican restaurant offered 25-cent tacos whenever the Colorado Rockies scored seven runs, Fleck would call Davis, who would zoom to the restaurant for the taco.\n\nIn a birthday letter to his mother two months before he died in 1997, John Denver said that he “wouldn’t have been the man I am, nor would I sing the way I do nor would I have written the songs without the influence and inspiration you have been to me. God bless the day you were born,” according to a Denver Post story.\n\nDenver, 53, died when the private plane he was piloting crashed in the sea off Monterey, Calif. In 2002, he was posthumously inducted into the Colorado Performing Arts Hall of Fame.\n\nErma Louise Swope was born in Beggs, Okla., on Aug. 5, 1922. She married Henry John “Dutch” Deutschendorf in 1942. He died in 1982.\n\nThey moved to Denver in 1969 and later moved to Aurora.\n\nShe worked as a receptionist for 17 years at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center pediatrics department.\n\nShe married Raymond Ralph Davis in 1992; he died in 1995.\n\nIn addition to her son, she is survived by eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren, and her sister, Edna Bingham of Tulsa, Okla."
