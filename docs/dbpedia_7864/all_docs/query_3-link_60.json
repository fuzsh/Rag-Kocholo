        "text": "John Denver, born Henry John Deutschendorf, Jr. was an American folk singer who was born in New Mexico and lived much of his life in Colorado, expressing his love for the state through many of his songs.\n\nHe is perhaps best known for the songs \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\", \"Rocky Mountain High\", and \"Leaving on a Jet Plane\", but his répertoire also includes many other well-known hits, such as \"Annie's Song\", \"Fly Away\", and \"Back Home Again\".\n\nIn addition to music, John Denver has worked as an actor, humanitarian, and environmental activist.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly Life (1943-1963)[]\n\nJohn Denver (Henry John Deutschendorf, Jr.) was born in Roswell, New Mexico to his mother Erma Louise and father Henry John Deutschendorf, Sr., who worked in the U.S. Air Force. Due to his father's military lifestyle, his family moved around a lot and lived in various places, inlcuding Arizona, Alabama, and Texas. Growing up, he had a single brother named Ron.\n\nHe learned to play guitar during his childhood after his grandmother got him one for his 7th birthday, and another for his 11th.\n\nHis family settled for some time in Texas, where he participated in Arlington Heights High School. During his third year in high school, he drove all the way to California to stay with some family friends, but his harsh father then flew out to California in a friend's jet and forced him to complete high school.\n\nHe studied architecture at the Texas Tech University and sang in the folk group The Alpine Trio while pursuing architectural studies. He moved to Los Angeles in 1963, where he sang in folk clubs, and it was around this time that he changed his surname to Denver.\n\nEarly Career (1965-1970)[]\n\nIn 1965, John Denver joined the The Mitchell Trio, replacing the namesake of the band, Chad Mitchell. The trio later came to be known as Denver, Boise, and Johnson after the other two original band members left.\n\nJohn Denver himself left the band in 1969 to pursue a solo career, and his debút album, Rhymes & Reasons was released in October that year.\n\nHe followed his first album with a '69-'70 tour of the Midwest, where he acquired a sizeable fan base, and released two more albums in 1970: Take Me to Tomorrow and 'Whose Garden Was This.\n\nMidlife (1971-1980)[]\n\nJohn Denver's next album—and perhaps his best known was Poems, Prayers & Promises, released in 1971 and featuring the single \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\". Rocky Mountain High was released the following year and became a top 10 hit, along with its title track.\n\nJohn Denver's Greatest Hits was released in 1973 and it reached #1 on the album charts, starting a three year streak of chart-topping albums for John Denver, continued by Back Home Again in 1974 and Windsong in 1975.\n\nWithin this three-year period, he also hosted the Emmy Award-winning television special An Evening With John Denver, and the holiday special Rocky Mountain Christmas, as well as recording a Rocky Mountain Christmas studio album.\n\nStarting in 1973, John Denver performed at the yearly fundraising picnic for the Aspen Camp School for the Deaf, raising half of their annual operating budget.\n\nHe released another two albums in 1976 and 1977; Spirit and I Want to Live, and he hosted the Grammy Awards in 1978.\n\nHe hosted the Grammy Awards again in 1979, released his eponymous studio album, and performed \"Rhymes and Reasons\" at the 1979 Music for UNICEF Concert in New York.\n\nIn addition, he was a guest star on The Muppet Show and collaborated with them for the Christmas special A Christmas Together in December. He joined the Muppets again for a second Christmas special, Rocky Mountain Holiday in 1982.\n\nJohn Denver and his father, Henry John Deutschendorf, Sr. reconciled in the '70s, and in 1980 they hosted the documentary television special The Higher We Fly: The History of Flight together.\n\nLate Life (1981-1997)[]\n\nJohn Denver again hosted the Grammy Awards in 1983, 1984, and 1985. During the 1983 Grammy Awards ceremony finale, he was joined by Joan Baez, Donna Summer, and others for a performance of the songs \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"Let the Sunshine In\".\n\nIn 1984, the president of ABC Sports asked him to compose the theme song for the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, to which he happily obliged, writing the song \"The Gold and Beyond\", which he performed for the Olympians.\n\nIn early 1985, John Denver wanted to be a member of the supergroup USA for Africa in the recording of the charity single \"We Are the World\", but he was turned down.\n\nDuring the 1985 Parents Music Resource Center hearing, John Denver testified before the Senate Labor and Commerce Committee opposing music censorship. He also went on tour in the Soviet Union that year.\n\nHe released 7 studio albums throughout the '80s; in 1990 released both Earth Songs and The Flower That Shattered the Stone, and released Different Directions in 1991. After these albums, he took a several year break from recording to focus on environmental and humanitarian projects.\n\nIn 1990 during Earth Day, he was the on-camera narrator for the environmental TV program In Partnership With Earth.\n\nIn 1992, he founded the environmental group Plant-It 2020 (originally Plant-It 2000) with the main goal of reforestation around the world, as well as providing humanitarian aid to poor families. He toured in China and released the greatest hits album Homegrown that year as well. He released his autobiography, Take Me Home, in 1994.\n\nEarly in 1997, John Denver filmed an episode for the seventeenth season of the PBS nature series, titled John Denver: Let This Be a Voice, which highlights some of the natural places that inspired many of his songs. It was aired in 1998.\n\nJohn Denver died on October 12, 1997 in an accident while flying his experimental Rutan Long-EZ plane over Monterey Bay in California. The last album released before his death was All Aboard!, a Children's album which later won a Grammy.\n\nAfter Death[]\n\nWhen news of John Denver's death reached Colorado, the governor of the state at the time ordered that state flags be lowered to half-mast in his memory.\n\nA sanctuary was dedicated in his honor near Rio Grande Park in Aspen, Colorado, which contains several large rocks inscribed with lyrics to a few of his songs. In 2007, a plaque was placed near the site of his fatal plane crash, inscribed with a couple lines from \"Windsong\".\n\nThe anthology musical Back Home Again: A John Denver Holiday premiered at the Rubicon Theatre Company in November 2006.\n\nIn 2007, on the 10th anniversary of his death, his family released the Live in the USSR album, a 2-hour live concert recording of one of his concerts in the Soviet Union in 1985 which includes a rendition of \"Annie's Song\" in Russian.\n\nAwards & Honors[]\n\nJohn Denver won a single posthumous Grammy Award, the award for Best Musical Album for Children for his final album before his unexpected death, plus the Grammy Hall of Fame Award for \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\" in 1998.\n\nIn addition, he won the Academy of Country Music's Album of the Year award for Back Home Again in 1974 and the Country Music Association's Song of the Year (for \"Back Home Again\") and Entertainer of the Year awards in 1975. He also won three American Music Awards in 1975 and 1976. He became the first non-classical musician to win the Albert Schweitzer Music Award in 1993.\n\nHe won the People's Choice Award and was named the honorary Poet Laureate of the State of Colorado, both in 1977.\n\nIn 1979 he was named as one of ten 'Outstanding Young Men of America' by the United States Junior Chamber.\n\nIn 1982 he won the Carl Sandburg's People's Poet Award.\n\nHe was awarded the Presidential World Without Hunger Award in 1985 by Ronald Reagan for his work with The Hunger Project and the President's Commission on World Hunger, and he received the NASA Public Service Medal for \"helping to increase awareness of space exploration by the peoples of the world\" that year as well, an award usually only given to spaceflight engineers and designers.\n\nJohn Denver was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1996, and he later became the first inductee into the Colorado Music Hall of Fame in 2011, and a bronze statue of him stands at the physical location at the Red Rocks Amphitheater west of Denver.\n\nA mountain in Greenland was named John Denver Peak when a group of explorers summited it in 2001. In addition, a proposed name change of Mount Sopris in Colorado to John Denver Peak in 2011 failed to gain the right support.\n\nIn 2014, John Denver was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nPersonal Life and Philanthropy[]\n\nOutside of music, John Denver enjoyed numerous other interests, including hiking, skiing, rock climbing, golfing, photography, and painting, as well as nearly anything related to the outdoors, although he had stated that flying was the thing he loved most.\n\nJohn Denver married Anne Martell (the subject of \"Annie's Song\") in 1967 and they lived in Minnesota for a brief period until moving to Aspen, Colorado. They adopted two children, Zachary John and Anna Kate. John Denver's parents moved to Colorado in 1969 when his father retired from the armed forces.\n\nJohn and Annie later divorced in 1982, and he married Australian actress Cassandra Delaney in 1988. The two had one daughter named Jesse Belle, but they later divorced in 1993.\n\nIn 1976, John Denver founded the Windstar Foundation to promote more sustainable living, and in 1977 he helped to co-found the nonprofit organization The Hunger Project, aiming to help put an end to world hunger.\n\nHe campaigned for Jimmy Carter in 1976, and when he was elected president, John Denver was picked to serve on the President's Commission on World Hunger, and he wrote the song \"I Want to Live\" as its theme song.\n\nDiscography[]\n\nEarly Career[]\n\nYear of release Singles Albums 1966 John Denver Sings 1969 \"Daydream\" Rhymes & Reasons 1970 \"Anthem-Revelation\" Take Me to Tomorrow \"Follow Me\" \"Sail Away Home\" Whose Garden Was This \"Mr. Bojangles\" 1971 \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\" Poems, Prayers & Promises \"Friends with You\" Aerie 1972 \"Everyday\" Rocky Mountain High \"Goodbye Again\" \"Hard Life, Hard Times (Prisoners)\" \"Rocky Mountain High\" \"Victory is Peace\"\n\nMid-Late Career[]\n\nYear of Release Singles Studio Albums\n\nLive Albums\n\nCompilation Albums Box Sets Other 1973 \"I'd Rather Be a Cowboy (Lady's Chains)\" Farewell Andromeda John Denver's Greatest Hits \"Welcome to My Morning (Farewell, Andromeda)\" \"Please, Daddy\" \"Sunshine on My Shoulders\" 1974 \"Annie's Song\" Back Home Again \"Back Home Again\" \"Sweet Surrender\" 1975 \"Thank God I'm a Country Boy\" Windsong An Evening with John Denver Rocky Mountain Christmas \"I'm Sorry\" / \"Calypso\" \"Fly Away\" \"Christmas for Cowboys\" 1976 \"Looking for Space\" Spirit Live in London \"It Makes Me Giggle\" \"Like a Sad Song\" \"Baby, You Look Good to Me Tonight\" 1977 \"My Sweet Lady\" I Want to Live John Denver's Greatest Hits Volume Two \"How Can I Leave You Again\" \"I Want to Live\" \"Bet on the Blues\" 1978 \"It Amazes Me\" Live at the Sydney Opera House 1979 \"Downhill Stuff\" John Denver A Christmas Together \"What's On Your Mind\" \"Garden Song\" \"A Baby Just Like You\" 1980 \"Autograph\" Autograph \"Dancing with the Mountains\" 1981 \"Some Days Are Diamonds (Some Days Are Stone)\" Some Days Are Diamonds Perhaps Love \"The Cowboy and the Lady\" 1982 \"Shanghai Breezes\" Seasons of the Heart Rocky Mountain Holiday \"Seasons of the Heart\" \"Opposite Tables\" \"Perhaps Love\" 1983 \"Wild Montana Skies\" It's About Time \"Hold On Tightly\" 1984 \"It's About Time\" Greatest Hits Volume 3 \"Just a Dream Away\" \"The Gold and Beyond\" \"Love Again\" 1985 \"Don't Close Your Eyes, Tonight\" Dreamland Express \"Dreamland Express\" 1986 \"Along for the Ride ('56 T-Bird)\" One World \"Let Us Begin (What Are We Making Weapons For?)\" \"We Are One: Sister Cities\" 1988 \"For You\" Higher Ground \"Country Girl in Paris\" \"Never a Doubt\" 1989 \"The One World\" Earth Songs 1990 \"The Flower That Shattered the Stone\" The Flower That Shattered the Stone Christmas Like a Lullaby \"Eagles and Horses\" \"Wish You Were Here (Postcard from Paris)\" 1991 Different Directions Take Me Home, Country Roads and Other Hits 1992 \"18 Holes\" Homegrown 1994 The Very Best of John Denver 1995 \"Calypso\" (live) The Wildlife Concert The John Denver Collection \"For You\" (live) 1996 \"Perhaps Love (Liefde Is...)\" (with Justine Palmelay) Love Again Reflections: Songs of Love & Life 1997 All Aboard!
