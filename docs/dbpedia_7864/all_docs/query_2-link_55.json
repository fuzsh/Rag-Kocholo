        "text": "For Baby (For Bobbie) (J Denver) 1966 and Leaving on A Jet Plane (J Denver) 1969 and Follow Me (J Denver) and The Game Is Over (J Denver) 1970 and Annie’s Song (J Denver) 1974 and I’m Sorry (J Denver) and Fly Away (J Denver) and Looking For Space 1975 and For You (J Denver) – John Denver 1986\n\nJohn Denver (Henry John Deutschendorf,1943), was a popular singer, composer, and environmental activist, and a prodigious songwriter throughout the 60’s and 70’s, his style of acoustic folk/country music was highly successful, and he would garner sales in excess of 33 million. His parents were Henry (“Dutch”) and Emma, his father was a Captain and pilot in the Air Force, and a strict disciplinarian, consequently young John lived a rather rootless life, as his father relocated the family from air bases in Roswell (New Mexico), Tucson (Arizona), Montgomery (Alabama), Fort Worth (Texas), and Denver (Colorado), young Henry John always seemed to be the “new kid in school”. Below L-R – John Denver x2, Family Photo Centre- Back row brother Ron, front row John, Emma and Henry,\n\nHe ran away from home in the third year of high school, but later returned to commence architectural studies at Texas Technical University, but he was an indifferent student, and dropped out in 1963.The Air Force brat had grown a hard protective outer shell and adaptive social dexterity by the time he relocated to Los Angeles and joined the Chad Mitchell Trio in 1969. In public he impressed as a sincere, likeable, softly-spoken, singing star on the rise; but his future wives would reveal that this concealed a darker, more troubled, and controlling personality, he was sterile and unable to father children, and this seemed to exacerbate his desire for sexual conquest outside of his two marriages, he was a serial philanderer, with a violent temper, especially when he was inebriated. Below Artwork x2, Chad Mitchell Trio (CM had departed) L-R – Mike Kobluk, John Denver, David Boise.\n\nIn 1965 he was performing at the Lumber Mill Club in Scottsdale, Arizona, when he met Bobbie Wargo, they were attracted to each other and both had fathers who were in the army, she was also a musician and aspiring songwriter, and the couple would play her parents piano together, the two were a couple for about a year, and she relieved John of his virginity. Denver was inspired to write his fourth song, For Baby (For Bobbie) for her, and she may have also contributed to the song’s lyrics, there is also some evidence that she was the inspiration for his next song, Leaving On A Jet Plane. Lyrically For Baby was nursery-rhyme simple “Little birds will sing along in time/Leaves will bow down, when you walk by/And morning bells will chime/I’ll be there when you’re feelin’ down,” and mostly piano-based with acoustic guitars less prominent, a children’s choir added a sentimental touch at the outro, and in the 1970’s it would chart as a single on the strength of Denver’s hits in the intervening years.\n\nAfter going solo in 1969 he signed with RCA Records and released his debut album Rhymes and Reasons, which featured a song he had written several years before which he had called Babe I Hate To Go but after Peter, Paul and Mary recorded it as Leaving On A Jet Plane, and took it all the way to a US #1, the new song title became a fixture. Denver and Anne Martell met in 1966 at a concert in Minnesota, they started dating right away and in 1967 they were married, and settled in Edina, Minnesota, later relocating to Aspen, Colorado, where Denver lived until his death in 1997. Below – Wedding of John Denver and Anne Martell.\n\nAnne would be the inspiration for many of Denver’s songs, the lyrics of Leaving On a Jet Plane should have conveyed a cautionary message to the first Mrs John Denver, as they paralleled the life of a touring troubadour, with its long periods of separation, the temptations and infidelities of life on the road, and the predilection for Denver to indulge himself accordingly “There’s so many times I’ve let you down/So many times I’ve played around/I tell you now, they don’t mean a thing/Every place I go, I’ll think of you/Every song I sing, I’ll sing for you/When I come back, I’ll bring your wedding ring…”The early years of the marriage were punctuated by several separations and each time Anne took her unfaithful husband back; even though his indiscretions increased at the same pace as his fame and celebrity grew.\n\nFollow Me released in 1970 was also inspired by John’s wife, who he had to leave behind when he toured because the couple were financially stressed,” Follow me where I go, what I do, who I know/Make it part of you to be a part of me/ Follow me up/ All the way around/Take my hand and say you’ll follow me…” Knowing that his wife would not be able to physically follow him, this song speaks of a spiritual companionship, it was intended to be mellow and folksy, and reassuring for Denver’s wife, but such idealistic spirituality was nothing like the physical company that his wife was aware Denver was keeping, while he was touring. Annie came to know that for many songs supposedly inspired by her, there were different women. The Game Is Over was another song in which Denver referenced the possible break up of his marriage, and regretted the lies upon which their love was based, although careful to include his wife in these acts of deception “Days I think of you and remember the lies we told in the night/The love we knew, the things we shared when our hearts were beating together…Gone, the days are gone now, days that seem so wrong now/Life won’t be the same without you to hold again in my arms, to ease the pain”.\n\nIn 1971 Denver would release the album Poems, Prayers, and Promises which included several of his biggest hits, Take Me Home Country Roads was a joint composition by Denver, Taffy Nivert and Bill Danoff, and was not originally inspired by rosy-hued memories of West Virginia, but lyrical changes subsequently shifted the emphasis and it became a West Virginian anthem, and has sold over 3 million copies. Sunshine On My Shoulders was another heartwarming, spiritual kind of song that was about finding pleasure in simple things, and was also a million-seller, and one of Denver’s live performance favorites. Below- John and Anne with children Anna and Zachary.\n\nDue to John’s infertility he and Annie would adopt two children during the 16 years they were married, Zachary and Anna, Denver would have hits with songs that seemed to reflect a solid, loving, and mutually respectful relationship, but this was often far from the truth, a fact that Annie stoically kept private, until it all became too much, and after separating several times, and almost divorcing in 1974, their relationship ended acrimoniously in divorce in 1982.\n\nAnnie’s Song (You Fill Up My Senses) was such a composition, it is generally regarded as one of the most beautiful romantic ballads of all time, a soft rock tearjerker of great subtlety, and sweetness, a eulogy to his first wife Annie, written in ten minutes, as he ascended the Ajax chairlift on Aspen Mountain, Colorado in 1974. John described his feelings at the time thus, “Suddenly, I’m hypersensitive to how beautiful everything is. All of these things filled up my senses, and when I said this to myself unbidden images came one after the other. All of the pictures merged and I was left with Annie. That song was the embodiment of the love I felt at that time.” It charted #1 in the US and UK, and sold over 1.6 million copies, and greatly assisted Denver to make the crossover from country to pop, in an era when groups like The Carpenters, Chicago, and Bread, where hitting the charts with lush soft rock songs. While Denver’s mellow music convinced many that he was equally easy-going in real life, the breakdown of his first marriage saw his bad temper erupt into a violent rage, he became abusive and almost choked Anne Martell when they were dividing up their joint property, in a fit of rage he used a chainsaw to cut their matrimonial bed in half.\n\nDenver’s Windsong album released in 1975 was quite revelatory in terms of the inner emotional turmoil that he was dealing with at the time. His marriage was heading for divorce, as the seemingly endless recording, touring, and promoting of his music and pet causes, forced him to live away from his family, for long periods. The lead single I’m Sorry was an overwhelmingly sad and remorseful paean to a dying relationship, full of regret about the downward trajectory of his private life, while feeling sorry for himself that his wife was going to leave him “Our friends all ask about you/And I say you’re doing fine/And I expect to hear from you almost anytime/But they all know I’m crying/And I can’t sleep at night/They all know I’m dying down deep inside.” It is the most confessional of Denver’s songs, clearly his long-suffering wife had delivered an ultimatum that would lead to divorce, yet he still felt that she would reach out to him, forgive him for his infidelities, and take him back “I’m sorry for all the lies I told you/I’m sorry for the things I didn’t say/But more than anything else/I’m sorry for myself/I can’t believe you went away” The song was Denver’s last #1 hit, its emotive lyrics and sweet string arrangement made for a moving if slightly maudlin apologia for forsaken love.\n\nLooking For Space was a song inspired by the Erhard Seminar Training (est) that John was undertaking in the 70’s, est was part of a wider movement that preached self-awareness of mind, body, and psyche, and clearly Denver believed that Werner Erhard was a guru, who could make him a better man “And I’m looking for space/And to find out who I am/And I’m looking to know and understand/It’s a sweet, sweet dream/Sometimes I’m almost there/Sometimes I fly like an eagle/And sometimes I’m deep in despair…” the est movement used authoritarian training techniques, and practiced the kind of mind control mumbo jumbo that was usually associated with scientology, it didn’t help Denver save his first marriage, nor his second marriage either. Below – Denver and Werner Erhard.\n\nUltimately Annie did “fly away” as Denver had predicted in his song of the same name, “All of her days have gone soft and cloudy/All of her dreams have gone dry/All of her nights have gone sad and shady/She’s getting ready to fly/Fly away, fly away (fly away) …,” it charted #13 and Olivia Newton -John rendered delightful backing vocals. Below – John and Cassandra Delaney, his second wife.\n\nIn 1986 Denver was touring Australia and saw local singer/actress Cassandra Delaney perform at Sydney’s Sebel Townhouse, he was immediately entranced, and the pair courted for two years, and were married in 1988 on a mountaintop near Aspen. She was 18 years younger than John, but initially he was infatuated with his strong-willed beauty from Downunder, and he serenaded her in song. For You was written in 1986 when Cassandra was filming Fair Game in Australia, “Just to wake up each morning/Just to you by my side/Just to know that you’re never really far away/Just a reason for living/Just to say, “I adore”/Just to know that you’re here in my heart to stay…” It was a tender, romantic, piano ballad and Cassie recalled the time after she married Denver “When I first met John, I really did think I was the luckiest girl in the world,” and in May 1989 their “miracle baby”, Jesse was born, although John had confirmed earlier in life that he was sterile. The mystery of how the child was conceived became the talk of the Aspen community, IVF would have been a possibility, but suspicions were aroused about the existence of an informal sperm donor, two years later the couple had separated, and were divorced in 1991. Below John and Cassandra x2 , John and Cassandra and baby Jesse.\n\nCassie has gone on the record about her life with Denver, the threats, bullying, jealousy, intimidation, and heavy drinking which made her feel abused, and the $3.3 million custody battle she fought for their child. In 1993 and ’94 Denver was arrested for DUI and placed on probation, in 1996 the Federal Aviation Administration disqualified him from flying due to his drink driving offences, but he was flying illegally when on October 12, 1997 he crashed his light plane into Monterey Bay, near Pacific Grove, he was flying solo and was killed in the accident. Below – Charlie Rich and JD.\n\nJohn Denver was a unique performer, his bespectacled, choirboy looks and tenor voice, were a promoter’s dream, he was also a gifted songwriter and musician, whose easy charm, charismatic persona, and embrace of environmental issues, made him a popular and relatable individual. He was instrumental in popularizing the crossover of artists between folk, country, and pop, much to the chagrin of many of the diehard Nashville performers, like Charlie Rich, who refused to read out the card that proclaimed that Denver had won the Country Music Association Entertainer of the Year award in 1975, and burnt the card on national television.\n\nIn retrospect, it would seem that Denver was probably bipolar, and had been all his life, this manifested itself in mood swings, feelings of insecurity, violent rage, chronic infidelity, and harmful self-medicating, to which his wives would attest. Nevertheless he has never been inducted into either the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nor the Country Music Hall of Fame, despite having won a Songwriters Hall of Fame Award, and a CMA award in 1975, and selling in excess of 30 million records, this is an injustice that should be remedied, albeit posthumously, at the first opportunity."
