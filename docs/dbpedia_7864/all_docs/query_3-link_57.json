        "meta_description": "Holmes - Glen Campbell tribute to John Denver - On 12 October 1997 legendary country singer John Denver was tragically killed in a plane crash. Friend and fan Glen Campbell was touring New Zealand at the time, and he stopped by TVNZ&#39;s Auckland Network Centre for an interview with Paul Holmes, and a tribute performance in the atrium, with TVNZ staff gathering to watch. Campbell discusses his friendâ€™s love of flying, desire to go into space, and his happiness in his final years. He covers Denver classic &#39;Take Me Home, Country Roads&#39; and concludes the interview with a rendition of his own hit, &#39;Rhinestone Cowboy&#39;.",
