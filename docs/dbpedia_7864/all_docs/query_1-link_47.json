        "text": "Background\n\nHenry John Deutschendorf Jr., known by all as John Denver, was born on December 31, 1943, in Roswell, New Mexico to parents Henry Denver Deutschendorf Senior and Emma Louise Swope. His father was a U.S. Air Force officer at the Roswell air force base, and he grew up in the area. Denver always had a love for music and his first musical instrument was given to him at the young age of two years old by his grandmother. He had a love for music and singing, however, he attended Texas Tech University to study architecture. After starting this degree, he soon realized that it was not for him and moved to Los Angeles to pursue his dream of becoming a musician. In 1963, his professional career began as he was chosen out of 250 hopefuls to become the lead singer for The Mitchell Trio — a 1960s vocal group.\n\nWhile being part of The Mitchell Trio was great for his career, in 1969, Denver pursued a career as a solo artist. He released his first-ever solo album titled “Rhymes & Reasons.” After his first album, Denver was on a roll, and over the next two years, he continued to release albums one musical hit after another, which substantially grew his fan base. In 1977, he was a starring character in the film “Oh God,” this showed that he was capable of more than just producing music. While this film was not a big hit, it showed how diverse Denver was in the talents that he had.\n\nAs he became more and more popular, he noted he had a unique chance to speak out and become an activist for something that he felt very passionate about, which was peace. In 1977, he helped bring “The Hunger Project” to life and began his work as an activist for peace. Denver even ventured to the U.S.S.R. for concerts and discussions regarding the ending of the cold war. Denver was a great man, and even though he is not with us today, his music and all that he did for the world are carried through!"
