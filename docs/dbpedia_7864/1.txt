John Denver, the singer and songwriter who was the voice of wholesome sincerity and simple country pleasures in the 1970's, died on Sunday afternoon when a light plane he was piloting crashed into Monterey Bay in California. He was 53.

Mr. Denver, a licensed pilot who flew jets, aerobatics planes and gliders, was aloft alone in a light, single-engine two-seat fiberglass airplane built from a kit.

Norman Hicks, the Sheriff of Monterey County, Calif., said that eyewitnesses saw the plane flying about 100 yards off the coast of Pacific Grove at an altitude of about 500 feet. The engine stopped, and at 5:27 P.M. Pacific Time, the plane ''fell directly straight down into the water,'' he said. Mr. Denver's body was identified from fingerprints.

Mr. Denver had walked away uninjured from an airplane accident in 1989, when the 1931 biplane he was piloting spun around while taxiing at a northern Arizona airport.

In songs like ''Take Me Home, Country Roads,'' ''Sunshine on My Shoulders'' and ''Rocky Mountain High,'' Mr. Denver portrayed a rural American paradise of natural beauty and unfailing true love. With an earnest, quivering tenor voice and an acoustic guitar, he made music that was all reassurance, using folk and country elements to lend sincerity to pop sentiments.

''My music and all my work stem from the conviction that people everywhere are intrinsically the same,'' he once said. ''When I write a song, I want to take the personal experience that inspired it and express it in as universal way as possible. I'm a global citizen.''
