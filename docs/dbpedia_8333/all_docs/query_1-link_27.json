        "text": "I decided to read a genre book a day after my epic finish of David Copperfield on the road between X City and the bike trail. I won’t read any classics for a week, I thought. I’ll swear off Dickens. I’m going to read beach books like everybody else. But I keep sneaking in bits of Our Mutual Friend, which is so spellbinding I’ve decided it must count as a thriller-comedy.\n\nBut the discipline of beach books! We’re told to read them, and so we read them. Anyway, so long as I stuck to mysteries I was getting through one a day: no problem. Ngaio Marsh’s False Scent, one of her brilliant theater mysteries, was my second Marsh read of the week. Mysteries are the perfect length, 250 pages or so, and now I understand the charm of the fast detective story finish, the addiction of many friends and ex-office-mates. You leave work, stock up on mysteries at the library, flop down on the couch at home, and read your way through an Alleyn mystery or a Miss Marple or a Stephanie Plum in less than 24 hours. (Our Mutual Friend, which is certainly mysterious, takes considerably longer.) And then you go back to the library and check out a new bunch.\n\nBut I can’t read nothing but mysteries. I need variety. So I decided to return to Barbara Kingsolver’s The Lacuna, the Orange Prize-winning historical novel. It’s a genre book. How ironic that Kingsolver won the Orange Prize for a well-researched, wildly uneven genre book instead of one of her literary novels, The Poisonwood Bible or Prodigal Summer. She really won the Orange Prize for her past books–anyone can see that!\n\nThis has been the year of the well-researched historical novel: Hilary Mantel’s Wolf Hall with three wins and The Lacuna with one. First Mantel’s Wolf Hall beat Byatt’s masterpiece The Children’s Book for the Booker Prize, much to my amazement. I began Wolf Hall and didn’t even think it was well-written. Then Mantel’s book beat Jayne Anne Phillips’ exquisite novel, Lark & Termite, for the National Book Critics Circle Award (yes, I know. The set-up stinks. Somebody’s a little too impressed with research; a little too unimpressed with literary masterpieces). mantel’s book also won the Walter Scott Award. Thank God Kingsolver beat Mantel for the Orange Prize, because frankly it’s unfair to pretend only one good book had been published in one year.\n\nSo here are my thoughts on The Lacuna: sadly, it’s a very static novel. Told in the form of a diary by Harrison Shepherd, Kingsolver’s fictional half Mexican, half American writer, it never really takes off. Kingsolver sketches little vignettes in the diary, then never develops them into scenes. It is as if she is too awed by her historical characters, Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, and Leon Trotsky among them, to subordinate them to a plot. Through a series of coincidences, Harrison, once grown up, ends up in 1930s Mexico City, the cook for Frida and Diego. Kingsolver stunningly portrays the vibrant Frida as an honest, passionate, political artist who insists on throwing parties that are artistic events, stirs up the servants into turmoil as she demands impossibly perfect meals in a tiny kitchen, a woman in constant pain who is frequently hospitalized for kidney stones, back problems, and eye infections and whose paintings–one depicting a blood-covered murder victim–terrify and repulse the unwary, who assume Rivera’s murals are better. in his diary, Harrison writes about cooking for a party and describes Frida’s wit and sultry temperament–but then what happens at the party? Who knows? We are told Frida has political friends, but learn little about them, even when Trotsky moves in with them. Then the novel is all about bricking up windows and hiding him from the press. But there’s little drama.\n\nSo I’ve read 200 pages and, alas, though there’s some beautiful writing, I can’t keep reading these vignettes that lead nowhere. The Orange Prize folks must have decided the award MUST go to a historical novel. Well, ok. I haven’t read the others so I can’t judge. But I CAN judge Kingsolver, since I’ve read ALL of her other books. I’m happy she won the award–I hope her next book will be better.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nI’ve had a difficult time the past few days doing anything except read David Copperfield. Get up: read David Copperfield. Drink tea: read David Copperfield. Go on a bicycle trip: leave David Copperfield behind.\n\n“When did you start reading that?” my husband wanted to know when he caught me.\n\nI’ve been low-key because my penchant for 19th century novels gets, well, ridiculed. A few years ago Nick Hornby wrote a column for The Believer, collected in The Polysyllabic Spree, praising David Copperfield. He was amazed that it had taken him so long to discover the novel (perhaps he was in his forties?) and preferred it even to Great Expectations. I instantly wanted to read it again. It happens to a lot of people. You read Nick Hornby’s column, go into a bookstore and start talking about David Copperfield, and the next thing everybody is rereading it. And after I finished Great Expectations, I wanted to reread Dickens’ autobiographical coming-of-age comedy anyway.\n\nIt’s 727 pages of delight. The narrator, as everyone knows, begins, “Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show.” Of course David does turn out to be the hero of his own life, but since he’s such a charming, intelligent observer of people, he draws unforgettable characters, like Peggotty, the kind, loyal, hard-working servant who throws her apron over her head when she laughs at her suitor, Barkis; Mr. Micawber, who is always in debt, and whose motto is, “Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen nineteen six, result happiness. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six, result misery”; Little Em’ly, the lovely orphaned niece of Peggotty, who lives happily in a house made of a boat with her uncle, Mr. Peggotty, and cousin, Ham, until a tragedy occurs; and Miss Betsey Trotwood, the eccentric aunt to whom David runs away after he is mistreated by Mr. Murdstone, his stepfather. Raised by a single mother and Peggotty, who essentially takes care of them both until his mother marries the sadistic Mr. Murdstone, David has more in common with modern children than you would at first think.\n\nI started Barbara Kingsolver’s The Lacuna yesterday, and on the basis of 109 pages and its winning the Orange Prize admire it with some reservations, as the very good writing seems more muted than is usual in her novels, perhaps so she won’t seem too impassioned when she writes about revolution. It is a historical novel, beginning in 1929 in Mexico, the story of Harrison Shepherd, a boy with a Mexican mother and an American father, who has been taken by his runaway mother from Washington, D.C., to live with her lover, the rather sinister Enrique, on a beautiful island.\n\n“It should have been like a storybook here. That is what she’d promised him, back in the cold little bedroom in Virginia North America…”\n\nBut the reality is there are not enough books and there’s nothing much to do except observe the fish and help the cook make bread. Told in the form of a diary, it is sometimes seems a bit too crammed with background. Harrison reads a book about Aztecs and then WE read about Aztecs. (I hate the Aztecs.) When they move to Mexico City, he happens to meet Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo. He makes plaster with a team of other people for Rivera, who is painting murals. And he happens to meet Frida at a market.\n\nWell, there’s much more. He has now been sent back to Washington, D.C., so his father can send him to a military academy, where he happens to meet a student whose family has lost everything in the Depression and who informs him about the living conditions of vets in an encampment. And they happen to be present when MacArthur and his troops massacre the veterans and their families.\n\nWell, more later. Kingsolver seems to have been very excited about her research and even quotes newspapers. But it’s not as fluid and relaxed as her other books. Still, I’ve got 400 pages to go.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nI’m sure you have had the experience of looking forward to a new book and then finding it an anticlimax. Barbara Kingsolver’s The Lacuna, which received good reviews in the press and mixed reviews among bloggers, just won the Orange Prize. It is apparently a departure from her earlier books, a historical/political novel set partly in the U.S. and partly in Mexico. We were expecting–what?–Prodigal Summer, The Poisonwood Bible, and The Bean Trees rolled into one. It’s been in a stack on my table since Christmas. My problem with novels set in Mexico is that I was incredibly sick on a vacation. I associate Mexico with, yes, buses that literally don’t stop for 12 hours and donkey shit in the ocean. Not a nice thing to remember, but I wasn’t in tourist country.\n\nI have no problem with Cuba, however, and Oscar Hijuelos’ Beautiful Maria of My Soul was high on my list of summer reading. A sequel to his Pulitzer Prize-winning The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love, it is told from the perspective of Maria, the beautiful lover of one of the heroes of Mambo, Nestor Castillo.\n\nSomehow I couldn’t read The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love, even though Hijuelos is one of the most skillful American writers. I got tired of the musicians salivating over women in the clubs. But the new book is from Maria’s point of view. Aha! I thought. His enchanting novel, Empress of the Splendid Season, about a Cuban cleaning lady, proved to me that yes, Hijuelos can write from a woman’s point of view!\n\nAnd so I rode my bike 14 miles to the bookstore. I read a few pages, cooled down with an iced drink, and then rashly bought it. I got home–and after 65 pages I don’t have the faintest idea who this Maria character is. Yes, she’s a beauty, as we learn from the cover flap and constantly in the novel, but good God! All she does is walk the streets of Havana turning heads wherever she goes, and gets jobs as stripper-dancers, the only skill a “beautiful woman” apparently has. The club owners always want to have sex with her. Usually she slaps them or walks out–but I need to know more about her to keep reading. To be fair, Hijuelos gives us details about her early life. In her home village, she was a good Catholic girl who looked after her dying mother and blamed herself for the death of an epileptic sister who disgraced herself by having sex among palm trees. There’s an air of magic realism about the delineation of her life. Somehow it doesn’t work for me.\n\nBut it’s difficult for Maria to be a good Catholic girl in Havana: there’s just no money. Hijuelos’ writing is so stunning, but Maria is completely a male fantasy, as far as I’m concerned. Of course I haven’t spent time with strippers and maybe they’re all like this–but the Cuban-American women I’ve met have not been strippers and haven’t been like this at all! This is a “content” problem, not a style problem. I’m sure many people will appreciate this book.\n\nHere’s the opening sentence, to show you the high quality of Hijuelos’ writing, because some of you may have better luck with this than I have.\n\n“Over forty years later, when Nestor Castillo’s future love, one Maria Gracia y Cifuentes, left her beloved valle in the far west of Cuba, she could have gone to the provincial capital of Pinar del Rio, where her prospects for finding work might be as good–or bad–as in any place, but because the truck driver who’d who’d picked her up one late morning, his gargoyle face hidden under the lowered brim of a lacquered cane hat, wasn’t going that way and because she’d heard so many things–both wonderful and sad–about Havana, Maria decided to accompany him, that cap stinking to high heaven from the animals in the back and from the thousands of hours he must have driven that truck with its loud diesel engine and manure-stained floor without a proper cleaning.”\n\nRead Full Post »"
