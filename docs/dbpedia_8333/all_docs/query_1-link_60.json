        "text": "Another Fake Disk based on\n\nThe Real Book Series\n\nThe follow up to the\n\nall-time best-selling Jazz Book\n\nis now available for Band-in-a-Box\n\nas a Fabulous Fake Disk\n\nAfter compiling a fake disk from The Real Book (Sixth Edition), Norton Fake Disk #37, the most frequent request I received was for me to create a fake disk for The rest of of The Real Book series. Years in the making, another e-disk is finally here!\n\nBy your requests, we made some changes. MIDI styles are the default and a Real Style suggestion by PG Music should appear in a pop-up box. That way, both MIDI and Real Style users can choose their preferred mode of playback.\n\nThe Real Books are the best-selling jazz books of all time. Since the 1970s, musicians have trusted these volumes to get them through every gig, night after night. The problem is that the books were illegally produced and distributed without any copyrights or royalties paid to the master composers who created these musical canons. Hal Leonard is very proud to present the first legitimate and legal editions of these books ever produced. You won't even notice the difference...the covers look the same, the engravings look the same, the songlist is nearly identical, and the price remains fair even on a musician's salary! But every conscientious musician will appreciate that these books are now produced legally and ethically, benefiting the songwriters that we owe for some of the greatest music ever written! And Norton Music is proud to present the companion fake disk. 400 songs.\n\nIt's a \"Who's Who\" of Jazz Composers\n\nThe list of famous jazz songwriters include: Tom Adair Nat Adderly\n\nFred E Ahlert Steve Allen Arthur Altman Harold Arlen Burt Bacharach\n\nChet Baker Dave Barbour Howard Barnes Kenny Barron Ary Barroso\n\nJorge Ben Irving Berlin Elmer Bernstein Joe Bishop Rube Bloom\n\nLuis Bonfa Brooks Bowman Randy Brecker Jerry Brooks Lew Brown\n\nSonny Burke Ralph Burns Kenny Burrell Sammy Cahn Hoagy Carmichael\n\nHarry Carroll Ornette Coleman Chic Corea George Cory Charles Davis\n\nMiles Davis Matt Dennis Vincius De Morales Gene DePaul Paul Desmond\n\nBuddy DeSylva Walter Donaldson Jimmy Dorsey Milton Drake Vernon Duke\n\nDuke Ellington Mercer Ellington Bill Evans Sammy Fain Osvaldo Farres\n\nDorothy Fields Marvin Fischer Dan Fisher Fred Fisher Dave Frishberg\n\nErroll Garner John \"Dizzy\" Gillespie Benny Golson Jay Gradon Eddie Green\n\nEarle Hagen James S Hall Arthur Hamilton Lionel Hampton Herbie Hancock\n\nYip Harburg Jesse Harris Coleman Hawkins Neal Hefti Ray Henderson\n\nVictor Herbert Irene Higginbotham Billy Hill Walter Hirsch Billie Holiday\n\nFrederick Hollander Gordon Jenkins Al Jarreau Antonio Carlos Jobim\n\nAlan Rankin Jones Bert Kaempfert Gus Kahn Buddy Kaye Jerome Kern\n\nCarole King Ted Koehler Fred Lacey Burton Lane Jack Lawrence\n\nJohn LaTouche Turner Layton Jay Livingston Ernesto Lecuona Frederick Loewe\n\nEugene McDaniels Jimmy McHugh Armando Manzanero Pat Martino Lyle Mays\n\nNilo Menendez Johnny Mercer Pat Metheny Bernie Miller\n\nJohn L \"Wes\" Montgomery Fleecie Moore Gerry Mulligan Henry Nemo\n\nSammy Nestico Ray Noble Sy Oliver Charlie Parker Dorothy Parker\n\nJaco Pastorius Bernice Petkere Cole Porter Neville Potter Earl \"Bud\" Powell\n\nPerez Prado Joe Raposo Andy Razaf Edward C Redding Django Reinhardt\n\nEmily Remler Wellard Robinson Richard Rodgers Fred Rose Vincent Rose\n\nGabriel Ruiz Bob Russell Arthur Schwartz Woody Shaw Arthur Siegel\n\nCarl Sigman Horace Silver Dolores \"Vicki\" Silvers Harold Spina\n\nMike Stern Sting Billy Strayhorn Jule Styne Mel Torme Charles Trenet\n\nBobby Troup McCoy Tyner Marcos Valle James Van Heusen\n\nConsuelo Velazquez Thomas \"Fats\" Waller Cedar Walton Harry Warren\n\nGrady Watts Mabel Wayne Kurt Weill Robert Wells Kenny Werner\n\nRichard A. Whiting Alec Wilder Paul Williams Bill Withers Tommy Wolf\n\nGuy Wood Lawrence Wright (Horatio Nicholls) Jack Yellen Joe Young\n\nand many, many more!!!\n\nJust browse the song list in the right hand column to see the song titles contained in this book/disk!\n\nI also suggested a style for each song from all the styles that were available for Band-in-a-Box when I compiled this disk.

I would like let you know how much enjoyment I am getting from them. They are a bargain. For the work you guys put into them it is hard to believe. The style selection and arrangements are excellent.

Keep up good work,thanks.\" - Tony Difurio\n\n● \"Thanks for the great work you do!

For amateur musicians, you and your wife provide a very valuable service and quality product that is very useful. You have been very kind and patient in answering our simplistic questions. The end result is that we are able to bring a little cheer to the folks in retirement homes and hospitals. It's incredible that some who may have not spoken for months begin to sing some song that they recognize. We look around and many are smiling and tapping their hands or feet. This is the payment that we receive and we are very thankful for it. I wish more \"senior\" musicians would perform some tunes for the infirmed folks.\" - Stan Smith - Redding CA\n\n● \"I decided to check out your styles disks, because everyone in the user group was \"talking about them. WOW! I listened to your samples and what a difference they are from the standard BIAB styles. ...Your styles are GREAT! Fantastic! Creative!

Thank you for taking the time to create them and for sharing them with others! - Alice Bartley\" - Renton WA\n\n● \"Happy to report that I was able to download to disk and then had no trouble getting it installed in BIAB.

Was afraid I would have to wait a couple of days for the email delivery. Your excellent customer service and prompt delivery is very much appreciated. Have already spent a few hours playing with (guitar) the styles and demo songs you provided. Very high quality stuff. They are just what I needed to help get me 'out of the box' and on to the next level of playing. - Frederick S. Fahrner Jr. - Santa Cruz CA\n\n● I received the styles and I love them! They were everything that I expected and more. - Nick Conley - Redwood City CA\n\n● \"I just installed your Christmas Fake Book songs and style disk #3 on my Mac. Actually, that's not quite true - I installed them about 10:30 or 11, and have been playing along with them for the past 4 hours. Before I head off to catch a few hours sleep, I just wanted to let you know how much I've enjoyed the songs and what a great job you did with the styles. I know you've probably heard it before, but thanks for the great job!\" - Rob Fish - Powell, Ohio\n\n● Your style files are exellent! I am very pleased to listen your many styles.

I had previously purchased 2 of your style disks. Within a week or two I found that they were the ones I ended up using 9 times out of 10. So I just bought a bunch more. You should warn people that your style disks are like drugs -- once you get a little, you're hooked! :)\" - Dan Thomas - Placentia CA\n\n● \"As I am typing this note, I am listening to a BIAB melody which came from a relatively random assignment of chords and one of your styles. It doesn't feel like midi at all, but rather as if I had tapped into some internet radio station broadcasting a live concert of real musicians.\" - Henry Lefkowitz - Columbia MD\n\n● \"Both disks are installed and work properly. Great job, they sound very professional. Bravo!\" - C. Miville Bois - Ville d'Anjou PC Canada\n\n● \"Thank you very much for the e mail delivery of my order for Norton Styles ...

I shall use them for \"Look up notes\" in a Blues project I am working with now for a friend of mine, who are a Good Blues singer. It is also very helpful for the musicians who shall play on the project to have some ground to stand on. Without the work you have done here, this would have taken much more time. I am there for just glad, to also could pay for the work you have done here.\" - Bjørn Pedersen - Tromso Norway\n\n● \"I had a very brief chance to listen to a few of the files.

I'm not sure how you do it, but you make an average program turn into one on the \"honor roll\"! if you know what I mean. (I don't mean to say that all of PG's stuff is bad. They do hit a good style here & there.(jazz styles etc...)... but any musician that's honest would have to say that a lot of it is \"square\"). Your styles give it a more realistic, \"live\" feel.... thus the name of the program should then be changed to A-REAL-BAND-OUT-OF-THE-BOX\"---- Maybe you should advertise.... \"Is it LIVE...or is it NORTON? Guess that's already taken...Just a thought.\" ~ Keith Burrows - Trumpet Sound Music Productions - Terre Haute, IN\n\n● \"I just installed your styles and they work very nice.

I am really satisfied with these new styles, and my fake books are starting to really work as they should. I also have to say that I am very impressed over the work you have done with it, and I'm really looking forward to start to work with it in my studio. Not so very long time from now I will buy the rest of them, because I think they work perfectly as a back up for my artists. They sound right.\" Best regards from Bjørn \"Worse\" Pedersen\n\n● \"...meanwhile I had the time to listen to all the new styles I bought last week. They are marvelous!!! Thanks a lot! Ulrich Maier - Email: CUMaier@____.___\n\n● \"Everythings are OK and the new \"superstyles\" are installed. I must say, that your styles are the best ever made for BIAB.
