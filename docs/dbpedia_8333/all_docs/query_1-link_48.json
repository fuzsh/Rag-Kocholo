        "text": "I use this page to keep track of Pulitzer prize winning fiction I’ve read. At this point, I haven’t read very many, but I’d like to read more. Let me know how many of these you’ve read and what you recommend or don’t recommend. If you’re a blogger, make your own page and comment here with a link to your blog’s Pulitzer Prize fiction page.\n\n“Pulitzer is a word but accomplishment is an aura.”\n\n— Chila Woychik\n\nI’ve gone one step further in evaluating the novels on this list – I looked to Amazon for information on genre, plot and page count, all factors that will help me decide which books to put on my 2020 reading list. (My 2019 reading list is already set in ascii and is only slightly flexible.)\n\nSo many books; so little time! Consequently, I don’t believe I’ll ever be able to read all these books unless I live an extraordinary amount of time, therefore I’m identifying books that especially interest me with the heart icon, for the first time on this blog.\n\nI’m not finished with this page yet – but am publishing it anyhow. I’ve already linked back 20 years. Eventually I’d like to get all the book links onto the page for easy examination of them on the Amazon site. My Amazon links provide a little affiliate income for me which is very much appreciated, just in case you go ahead and buy something after using one of my links.\n\nHere’s a Goodreads group of people reading and discussing these books: Tackling the Pulitzer Prize Winners!\n\n♥ – I want to read this\n\n&star; – I own a copy of the book\n\n&bigstar;&bigstar; – I own a copy and am currently reading the book\n\n&check; – Finished (18)\n\n2021\n\n♥ Winner: The Night Watchman, by Louise Erdrich – 464 pages – cultural heritage literary fiction; set in 1953 North Dakota, this is about the rights of Native Americans to their homes and land.\n\nFinalist: A Registry of My Passage Upon the Earth, by Daniel Mason – 240 pages – short stories; tales of struggle for survival, class divisions, need for love and more.\n\nFinalist: Telephone, by Percival Everett – 244 pages – literary fiction; first person stream of consciousness from a geologist/paleobiologist about his work and home life.\n\n2020\n\n&check; Winner: The Nickel Boys, by Colson Whitehead – 224 pages – literary fiction; boys at a reform school – friendships forged and secrets revealed.\n\n♥ Finalist: The Dutch House, by Ann Patchett – 352 pages – coming of age fiction; siblings raised in wealth have to deal with poverty later in life.\n\nFinalist: The Topeka School, by Ben Lerner – 304 pages – coming of age fiction; a high school senior deals with toxic masculinity issues.\n\n2019\n\n&check; Winner: The Overstory, by Richard Powers – 512 pages – literary fiction; trees and the loving preservation of them.\n\n♥ Finalist: The Great Believers, by Rebecca Makkai – 448 pages – coming of age fiction; centers on Chicago and the AIDS epidemic.\n\nFinalist: There There, by Tommy Orange – 304 pages – Native American literature; twelve Native Americans at a powwow.\n\n2018\n\nWinner: Less, by Andrew Sean Greer – 272 pages – humor; a novelist travels the world\n\n♥ Finalist: In the Distance, by Hernan Diaz – 240 pages – western, family saga; a lonely young man travels east from California\n\nFinalist: The Idiot, by Elif Batuman – 432 pages – humor; a Turkish-American girl at Harvard coming of age\n\n2017\n\nWinner: The Underground Railroad, by Colson Whitehead – 336 pages – historical fiction; a woman tries to escape from slavery\n\nFinalist: Imagine Me Gone, by Adam Haslett – 368 pages – literary fiction, family drama; engaged to be married, a man is hospitalized for depression, told by all five members of the family\n\nFinalist: The Sport of Kings, by C.E.
