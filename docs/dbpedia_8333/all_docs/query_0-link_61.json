        "text": "The opening narration of the adult animated miniseries Prester of Shangri-La. It was an animated miniseries aimed at older audiences, airing on NBC for 13 episodes in 1983. It was produced by Filmation, who decided to step up the animation game from Hanna-Barbera by adapting the fantasy novella SPQS by Robert B. Marcus Junior. The miniseries told the story of Holly R. Sampson who discovers a portal in Nepal, leading into another world where Shangri-La, a Nestorian Christian empire ruled by Prester John, controls most of Asia.\n\nThe miniseries was widely-acclaimed for being an animated show in which critics said adults would not be ashamed of watching. However, due to rights issues with Robert B. Marcus Junior, it rarely received any home video releases except on bootleg recordings. Those bootlegs would be heavily circulated by fans through trading in sci-fi conventions.\n\n\"Originally in 1998, Megatech Software was supposed to license Moon, a 1997 horror visual novel by Tactics. However, the licensing deal fell through when most of the staff at Tactics left to form Key, causing its owner Nexton to cancel the licensing deal. This caused Megatech to seek F&C Co., Ltd and TechArts, in which the two companies licensed their upcoming visual novels to Megatech - Echo and Synchro respectively.\n\nThe work on translating and reformulating the two games proved to be stressful for the staff at Megatech. Synchro underwent a hasty rewrite by Muriel Gray from its original script by Nekoyanagi Mambo and Kenny Wu brought in the original artist for the game Toshihide Sano aka Kouji Watanabe to illustrate additional scenes whereas Echo was heavily reprogrammed by Shane Lin and Daniel Chan to accommodate more save slots and to fix an infamous bug where the game crashed after hours of playtesting.\"\n\nSmall piece in a video game journal \"Gaming of Japan\" written by Hannah Everheart. This was an analysis of the visual novel seen with \"Moon\", \"Echo\", and Synchro\". The piece was in the 1999 issue and was largely seen as a decent piece.\n\n\"There should be a zoo of drunk people doing dumb things\"\n\n\"It exists, and it is called Russia\".\n\nSmall piece in a video game journal \"Gaming of Japan\" written by Hannah Everheart.

The piece was in the 1999 issue and was largely seen as a decent piece.\n\n\"There should be a zoo of drunk people doing dumb things\"\n\n\"It exists, and it is called Russia\".\n\nPiece of dialogue from 1990 buddy movie Cop couple, starring Bruce Willis and Teri Hatcher.\n\nWillis takes on the role of experienced, baddass, manly and rugged yet prone to wacky commentary cop Jack Jenkins.\n\nTeri is Sarah Williams, a woman trying to find her place in a world of men, and a rookie fresh out of the academy, but one who manages herself pretty well on her own and has lots of potential. Despite her lack of experience, she's the logical, deadpan snarker to Jack's wackier personality.\n\nContrary to what the title and cast would suggest, the \"couple\" doesn't develop romantic or sexual feelings for each other, although other characters assuming they do is a running joke in all films. Their initially relationship throughout the film develops into the mentor (Jack) and student (Sarah) sort. Even then, sometimes is the student the one who has to teach her mentor and both end up learning a lot from each other. They decide to call themselves the \"Couple\" at the end of the film since everyone keeps calling them by said moniker and they've taken a liking to it.\n\nThis particular exchange comes from a scene right after interrogating some drunken dudes who didn't actually know anything, to which Jack says the first quote and Sarah replies him.\n\nThe film would become very successful among both critics and public and spawn two more sequels, conforming a trilogy where the Couple continue their comical yet compelling character development as they take on new bad guys.\n\nIn 2018, a late fourth sequel would be made, showing an older Couple reuniting again after many years to kick ass one more time. It made the delights of the older public, while new generations rediscovered the unique relationship and missions of the Couple.\n\nThough debates on what of the four films is the best (the second one usually being considered the weakest) abound, the cuadrilogy is considered universally good. The Couple today are iconic characters of pop culture and film history.\n\n\"Interviewer: So, after 30 years, and still as youthful as ever, if I might add, how does it feel to be the world's most famous queer marriage?\n\n(Both women are holding hands)\n\nMichelle Yeoh: well, it's just like people say, every day is a new adventure.\n\nAngela Basset: That comes with being an actress, Michelle.\n\nMichelle Yeoh: it comes with being married to me, Angie.\n\nAngela Basset: Oh, so I'm not adventurous? Even after last night? Are you challenging me?\n\nMichelle: How much do you want to bet? (Biting her lip)\n\nAngela: (Knowing smile)\n\n(Both suddenly laugh together)\n\nInterviewer: And this is why people love you.\"\n\n“If you love her so much then why on Earth do you not marry her?”\n\n“Cause I’m already married. To justice.”\n\n“Yeah cause only a blind girl would marry you.”\n\nAn exchange from the film Batman Triumphant. Ra's Al Ghul asks Batman regarding his relationship with Ra's daughter, Talia al Ghul. Batman responds that he is married to justice, in which Ra's retorts about only a blind girl would marry him. Batman Triumphant was released in 1995 following the success of Batman Returns, in which Tim Burton was allowed to keep his role as director.\n\n\"Rewriting Synchro from the original script by Nekoyanagi Mambo was a particularly difficult for me. I found the original Japanese script to be poorly-written, often moderately misogynistic. I hated how he depicted the central female characters - Azusa, Yuka, Mizuha, Saeko, Mikako - as eye candy with little character agency, along with perhaps the shoddily-plotted mystery for a video game.\n\nI heavily rewrote the script to give better characterizations for the main cast. Azusa was much livelier and proactive, attempting to save Yuka when she was abducted in the finale of the visual novel compared to the original script. The main villain, the captor who abducted Mikako and Yuka, was given a fight scene with Azusa in which the original artist for the game, Toshihide Sano, eagerly illustrated.\" - Muriel Gray, on rewriting the visual novel Synchro (2000, Sheep) at Megatech Software. Quoted from the June 2010 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly.\n\n\"Rewriting Synchro from the original script by Nekoyanagi Mambo was a particularly difficult for me.

Quoted from the June 2010 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly.\n\nAn excerpt from an interview about the english translation of Japanese visual novel Synchro, the translation was somewhat controversial among fans, but the changes made were generally considered to give the game more appeal in the west, and by proxy made the American market more receptive to visual novels.\n\n\"It will be a war to end all wars, all of the Eurasian powers will come to blows, and the balance that has been so delicately kept will collapse. I know not when this war will come, but I do know one thing. When it comes, some damn fool thing in the Baltic will set it off!\" - Lord-Protector William Lamb\n\n\"It will be a war to end all wars, all of the Eurasian powers will come to blows, and the balance that has been so delicately kept will collapse. I know not when this war will come, but I do know one thing. When it comes, some damn fool thing in the Baltic will set it off!\" - Lord-Protector William Lamb\n\nAn Oft-quoted remark by Lord-Protector of the Isles and Northeastern holdings of the Crown of Britain, it predates the great Eurasian war by almost 25 years and thus considered a sort of 'Cassandra's prophecy' in popular thought. The War between the Danube Pact (The Kievan Rus', the Illiryan Empire ,the Despotate of Rhomania, and allies) and the Mutual Benefit Union (the Deutchrepublika, The Borzigin Orde, Francia, and others) would break out over the conflict between the German upper class and the Balto-Slav peasantry in the Teutonic Order - the landowners were firm allies of the Deutch, while nationalist movements advocated joining the 'Eastern Brothers' of the Rus'.\n\nBritain, although it had attempted to keep its famed neutrality, was nevertheless forced to intervene once the Rus' seized the city of Landscrown[1], which had been in dispute between the Teutons and British-controlled Suomi, at the behest of the Balt-Teuton nationalist government. The war would drag out for 5 years (1904-1909), and would claim approximately 30 million lives. It would devastate the old order of Eurasia, with both Rhomania and the Borzigins (Later Mongholia) collapsing into their ethnic cores; The destruction of farmland in the Black sea region, and the blockade on grain exports imposed on the Black Sea Pact by Britain and the Deutchrepublika, would lead to atrocious famines worldwide after the war. With no conclusive winner, all sides were left hurting and seething. And, once again, war would erupt just 25 years later.\n\n\"Captain, How does having so many priests here help us?\"\n\n\"it's quite simple, Sargent. If we win, it's divine intervention; if we lose, they can speed up all the funerals\".\n\n\"Captain, How does having so many priests here help us?\"\n\n\"it's quite simple, Sargent. If we win, it's divine intervention; if we lose, they can speed up all the funerals\".\n\nQuote from a newspaper cartoon in the London Post of December 1916, relating to the at the time still-ongoing Battle of the Somme. Entente Command had requested volunteer priests to the frontlines to lift the spirits of their soldiers, and hold Christmas Mass for the Christian Soldiers there. The Cartoon depicted a British Soldier and an Officer looking over Priests marching into camp in rank-and-file.\n\nThough proven to be from a cartoon, in some circles the myth persists that it reflects the soldiers' sentiment in the trenches, when, in reality, the priests and their spiritual relief were welcomed by the common fighting men with open arms.\n\n\"They told us we would only be fighting these slit-eyes Orientals, not god-forsaken devils! We heard their terrible cry of 'Bone Sea!', or whatever, and, before we knew it, these yellow madmen came rushing out of the woods, brandishing their swords and bayonets at our lines! Their leaders, officers, in their garish armor barking orders in that shrill language of theirs. In that moment, I truly believed God supported the Southern cause, because the Union sent literal demons to kill us!\"\n\n- Unknown Confederate Officer in 1863, interviewed by the Washington Post after having been taken Prisoner by United States Army after the Battle of Gettysburg.\n\n\"They told us we would only be fighting these slit-eyes Orientals, not god-forsaken devils!

In that moment, I truly believed God supported the Southern cause, because the Union sent literal demons to kill us!\"\n\n- Unknown Confederate Officer in 1863, interviewed by the Washington Post after having been taken Prisoner by United States Army after the Battle of Gettysburg.\n\nThe ramblings of a Confederate officer regarding the Americans utilizing Japanese reinforcements over in the American Civil War. Due to a series of circumstances, a large number of Japanese immigrants arrived in the California territory, which had gone underpopulated. Ultimately, the Americans decided to grant the territory over to the Japanese settlers in exchange for their assistance. Despite the culture shock, the Japanese immigrants and the Union soldiers would work well together. The interview that came out would actually come to reinforce a bit of propaganda that was aimed at parts of the Confederacy, that being full of backwards and reactionary people with delusions of feudal society.\n\nThe interview would become famous for being a prominent piece of the \"irrationality\" of the South. Said mockery would lead to more in-fighting and disasters, especially after the assassination of President Lincoln. Ultimately, the southern states would be placed under martial law with many of the leaders and officers being captured and turned in by desperate yeomen and the like. As for the Japanese reinforcements, they settled on the newfound Republic of Karifornea (consisting of OTL California, Nevada, Utah and Arizona). They would quickly rise to prominence thanks to the Gold Rush and they were willing to accept help from the new freedmen. Ove time, Karifornea would become a prosperous and capable nation that while maintaing a distinct Japanese background, was also influenced by the various indigenous tribes of the region along with the African-descended peoples and their culture influnces over in Karifornea and the United States such as with food, slang and music.\n\n\"Few nations are as close to America as the Amazigh Empire. The nation of the Berber Corsairs remain America’s first ally and of the closest”- President George Washington.\n\n\"Few nations are as close to America as the Amazigh Empire. The nation of the Berber Corsairs remain America’s first ally and of the closest”- President George Washington.\n\nIn 1788, the US Delegation visited the capital city of the Amazigh Empire, Bacanaria. President George Washington met the ruling Emperor at the time, Emperor Abu Sabulo. The main purpose of the visit was to build an anti-British alliance and to protect US interests in Europe during the time. President Washington was impressed by the high-quality infrastructure of the Amazigh Empire and its willingness to reject Islam and adopt Arian Christianity after the Berber-Arab Wars of the 18th century.\n\nWhat impressed President Washington the most was the Berber Navy. At the time, it was the largest navy in the Mediterranean, thanks to US support and German materiel. Berber Navy Officers were trained at Annapolis while German industrialists constructed warships, docks and other important facilities for the Navy. Such unprecedented development frightened the Kingdom of Italy along with the declining Ottoman Empire.\n\n\"Interviewer:\n\nWhat made the reformulation of the visual novel ECHO so difficult for you?\n\nShane Lin:\n\nFirstly, the game had only one save slot. We could only save game at certain points after reading through lines and lines of onscreen text relayed at a slow pace. At a playthrough of Rin's route, we forgot to save game at the point and forced to replay it again. Jeez, it's perhaps the worst memory in my career at Megatech Software.\n\nDaniel Chan:\n\nAnd second, which is more serious, was the issue of freezing. It was a challenge to replay the entire game when it froze so often. I felt I wanted to scream at the developers of this visual novel (FairyTale Hardcover) for that. Shane told me the version of the game we're playing was the in-development version from Japan, where the developers came from.\n\nShane Lin:\n\nWe went through an effort to fix the entire game from scratch, using only the original Japanese script translated by Jeremy Blaustein and the base assets. We spent weeks cooped up inside the office trying to find the source of the problem. So much so, that I dreamt myself living through the plot of the game, mainly being trapped underground and having the girls navigate.\n\nDaniel Chan:\n\nDuring the process, I asked my boss Kenny Wu to supplement the game. I thought the in-game's illustrations, originally by Hatake Masahi, wasn't satisfactory. Thus, Kenny brought us another illustrator, Daniel Horn from Dark Horse Comics, for the task. I liked the illustrations for the climatic scenes of the protagonist and the girl of the route.

Quoted from the June 2010 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly.\n\nA snippet of an interview by Electronic Gaming Monthly and game developers Shane Lin and Daniel Chan. Though they were personally absolved of any wrongdoing, the reproduction of ECHO led to the downfall of Megatech Software, when Hatake Masahi sued the company for altering his work. The lawsuit of Masahi v Megatech Software Ltd. proved a landmark in American copyright law and was seen as a major win for artists in protecting their intellectual property from corporations. It was almost immediately used as precedent in the even larger Disney v Enola.\n\n\"Given the nature of its democratic system of government, the mass mobilization of the work force for military production, and the location of many major military bases within city limits, not only was the firebombing of American cities during the War of Supremacy strategically beneficial, it was also morally and legally acceptable.\"\n\nA snippet of an interview by Electronic Gaming Monthly and game developers Shane Lin and Daniel Chan.

As Russia regrew her power and began to seem like that she could possibly overtake America, the Americans panicking over the loss of their superpower status blustered their way into a war. However the Americans had underestimated the depth of their popularity across much of the world after their constant interventions and saw much of the world declare neutrality while secretly cheering on the Russians. For their part, the Russians adopted a ruthless strategy of total war to bring the war truly to the American population and cripple their industry. Despite initial support, this rapidly fell as the American population suffered from the privations of war that many other nations had to suffer from and soon America was forced to sue for peace.\n\n\"I hope you will remember this Mr. President, all great powers rise and fall. Only the passage of time is constant and even that one day will end.\"\n\n\"I hope you will remember this Mr. President, all great powers rise and fall. Only the passage of time is constant and even that one day will end.\"\n\nA rather philosophical statement over to President Theodore Roosevelt by an aide regarding the proclamation of the Roosevelt Corollary to the Munroe Doctrine out of a concern of imperial ambitions and thus be no better than Europe. Theodore Roosevelt would take this to heart, with the Corollary being reworded as the US being on call for the nations for aid against European intervention and to try and act as an impartial party in conflicts between them. This would lead to Central America and the Caribbean ending up in various states of conflicts and troubles, especially as leadership would be reluctant to ask the Americans for help. The main exception would be the creation of the Republic of the Philippines in 1920, to compensate for the Philippine American War.\n\nOf course, this just led to warfare and trouble from modest European influence, especially during World War I. While Roosevelt's successors didn't agree with the Corollary, no one wanted to challenge it. By the mid-1920s, it would finally be invoked after the Dominican-Haitain War, where a growing faction of Unidados came over to the US. The whole island would become known as the Haitian Union. However, the usage of the corollary would be best seen when the growing socialist movement there in the 1930s called for help from President Franklin Delano Roosevelt for aid. With the new Good Neighbor policy, FDR would go in, stabilizing the nation into the People's Union of Haiti. This would lead to an odd trend of the United States backing socialist-leaning movements if in order to stabilize nations in Latin America under the FDR Administration. The biggest example would be the creation of the Central American Union, a union of the various Central American nations after years of struggle and even conflict caused by corrupt governments. Initially a sort of confederation between the nations, it would centralize further in the 1950s into the Mancomuidad of Central America, where the constinuent nations would be broken into smaller states and a new identity formed.\n\nThis also a affected the United States as it would adopt the goals of a lesser focus on imperialism, but also to grow to last indefinitely as a superpower. This would lead to vaious decisions, such as refusing to get involved in France's attempts at reclaiming Vietnam, and the first new premier in Ho Chi Minh having Vietnam form an alliance with President Eisenhower. Eisenhower himself also followed this when the US refused to aid the British in a coup for the Iranian government (with American involvement limited to warning Mosaddegh about it). Mosaddegh in turn would call for US aid against the coup, resulting in closer ties of the US and Iran (which would lead to tension with Saudi Arabia who viewed Iran as a rival, though this would become a moot point as the wasteful spending would lead to the Arabian Revolution and the rise of Baathism.)\n\n\"Within the days of the 13 Colonies, two groups were fighting for cultural dominance; the Puritans and the Quakers. Ultimately, it would be the Quakers who would win. The Quakers' ideals would guide the United States into the compassionate superpower it is now; from honoring deals with Native Americans to ending slavery in the US Constitution in 1781 and given women the right to vote in 1800, the Quakers' ideals are what led to the pristine reputation of the USA.\"\n\n\"Within the days of the 13 Colonies, two groups were fighting for cultural dominance; the Puritans and the Quakers.

The Quaker-Puritan conflict broke out when the Puritan Council of Elders fought against the Quaker Council of Elders in the 18th century. The Puritans advocated for independence for the colonies and willingess to preserve old traditions like slave ownership and expansion into Native American territories whereas the Quakers advocated for non-violence, collaboration with the British, and extremely liberal positions on lifestyle choices.\n\nThe conflict culminated in a short-lived war. Eventually, the Quakers won the war and the Puritans were forced to flee from the newly-formed United States of America to Brazil, where they formed a colony. The Quakers were extremely revolutionary and progressive, introducing social reforms such as writing strict peace treaties with various Native American societies in the west, adding the Thirteenth Amendment into the US Constitution in the 1781 to prevent a civil war, and gave the women the right to vote in 1800.\n\nHowever, such country could never be accepted by the wider world. In the summer of 1869, Britain, France, Spain, Portugal and Germany invaded the United States. The occupation forces committed countless atrocities and executed the leaders. After the war, the occupiers imposed their values upon the ruined United States, forcing it to accept regressive, reactionary, and autocratic traditions.\n\n\"Fate/stay Night was considered Megatech Software's magnum opus for a good reason. In 2007, Megatech Software was in dire financial straits after critical and commercial failures of their previous visual novel releases. Seeking an AAA game for them, CEO Kenny Wu made a deal with Type-Moon to license Fate/stay Night for translation and release in the United States.\n\nThe translation process was difficult and arduous, as the game was extremely large and long .

The Masahi v Megatech Software Ltd lawsuit had hit the company hard, both financially and in terms of reputation. Even more importantly, it energized the employees who saw the opening to guard their own work as their own intellectual property, not the corporations'. The stress of working on Fate/stay Night led to unionization of Megatech's software engineers following a string of nervous breakdowns. The union's first strike, following the release of Fate/stay Night paralyzed Megatech Software. The union struck a cord with Americans, particularly when Megatech released the game with numerous issues unresolved. Players were furious at the quality of play, translations, and art and activists sympathized with the striking software developers. Megatech was forced to settle with the union, providing them significant concessions in a bid to get them to return. The result, when Fate/stay Night was released after being completed by a development team that was far more well-adjusted, led to the game being considered the magnum opus it is today. The success of Fate/stay Night led to a dual trend; a resurgence of practical effects in the film industry, as producers sought to limit their dependence on CGI, and a marked increase in video game quality. This last was due to software engineers receiving far better working conditions and pay, with the more satisfied workers producing far higher quality games.\n\n\"Look, Russia and the US were totally different.

Monarchy, republic, state church, separation of church and state, charter of government, Constitution. However, they were united against China by one of the most powerful forces in all of human history; the grand unifying theory of 'fuck that guy.'\"\n\n-Lions Led by Donkeys Podcast Host Joe Kasabian, Episode 308, \"The Great Pacific War, Part One\"\n\nJoe Kasabian's responding statement when beginning to talk about the Great Pacific War. It would see the United States of America and the Tsardom of Russia go to war against the Chinese Empire. While simplisitic, Kasabian's statement was indeed correct. Since the Great War, the Chinese Republic would transform into the Imperial Chinese Republic, an autocratic military dictatorship who proceeded to exploit Russia's weakness and expand heavily into the north, claiming the Far East and Siberia, all while creating prisons there to house dissents, freedom fighters and revolutionaries against the regime. The Tsardom did not take well for this, especially as whatever benefit they got from remaining in the Great European War on the Entente would have faded. While they and the US were informally good friends, they were still quite different and their alliance would be shocking. That said, the Americans' involvement would also be due to China's growing threat over in the Pacific. Made more notable as Southeast Asia would be vulnerable to Chinese imperialism and Europe was too weak to fight back (not to mention at war with one another again) while Japan had entered a period of isolation until the 1950s with the Harmonious Socialist Uprising.\n\nPart 1 would see the background and leading to the events of the Tsardom and the US uniting to defeat the Chinese Empire and the opening battles. Part 2 would see the invasion of Alaska along with the rise of the Korean and Mongolian revolutionaries. Part 3 would see the liberation of Southeast Asia and the formal rise of the Chinese Democratic League. Part 4 would be the ending and the new status quo: China would end up as a constitutional monarchy, with Tibet, Manchuria and Dzungaria as having autonomy within them. Mongolia meanwhile would annex Siberia and the Far East for their own as per the agreement to become the Free Mongol Khanate. Southeast Asia meanwhile would end up heavily in the American sphere of influence. Russia meanwhile would be victorious, but the ordeal would lead to Tsar Alexei Nikolaevich declaring the monarchy would end with his passing and leading to Great Growth, a period of modernization for Russia. Russian forces would end up helping to rebuild Europe after the Second European War (which saw the alliance of Austria, Hungary, Italy, Spain and Portugal war against France, Germany, the Low Countries and the British, with the latter side winning), with Russian manpower and American funds being a prime mover.\n\n\"The American Founding Fathers wavered on the issue of slavery until a certain someone came and began organizing the slaves into militia. While this did lead to fighting more loyalists in the South, the Founding Fathers worked with the \"Five Civilized Tribes\" so they could get states of their own in exchange for their help. Thus, the American Revolution succeeded, slavery outlawed in the Constitution and the 13 colonies becoming the first 18 States of the USA\"\n\n\"The American Founding Fathers wavered on the issue of slavery until a certain someone came and began organizing the slaves into militia.

Despite what is implied, membership in the \"Coloured Militias\",formed by Benedict Arnold, as they would come to be known, did not automatically confer freedom on the members, though there was a condition that set a minimum price that their owners could ask were they to purchase their freedom, which was one much more achievable than most offered. The constitutional clause in question set the rule that the Grandchildren of any slaves alive at that time would be free upon birth, allowing southern plantation owners to establish the system of sharecropping that would begin to be put into motion in the 1840s, and would become dominant in the south by the 1860s. The Civil Rights movement beginning the 1870s would struggle to take purchase at first, but by the 1940s the movement had achieved most of their goals, with the aftermath of The Second Carribean War helping African Americans to build up wealth roughly on par with white people.\n\nThe Native Americans in the south were in a much more secure position after the war, but despite having their own states, they still faced struggles with white settlers attempting to take their land. Southern Planters desired to take control of the \"Savage States\" as they called the, and advocated for their abolition, but this only meant that the governments of these states, which might otherwise share some interests with the Southerners, took a position that favored weakening their power, with many Natives, especially Seminole, becoming leaders in the Civil Rights movement.\n\n\"I shall rain fire upon your cities, I shall drop sulfur on your people, and the air you breathe will become deadly to you. As my forebears once beat back the 'Divine Wind' of the Nipponese, so we shall send your Manifest Destiny back across your continent, and take your shining seas, if you fail to submit to the might of the Khan.\"\n\n\"I shall rain fire upon your cities, I shall drop sulfur on your people, and the air you breathe will become deadly to you.

The Qing Khanate was the result of the Manchu and Mongolians merging into one nation before defeating the Ming and absorbing it to form the Qing Khanate. Having expanded all the way north and getting Siberia and the Far East from Russia along with liberating Central Asia, the Qing Khanate have been wanting Alaska due to the rumored oil and gold deposits. Alaska was sold to the Americans by the Russians prior to the Russian's loss over in the Tsardom-Khanate War. Tensions between the two great powers have been growing since the issues with Japan and the Philippines, but this intimidation attempt proved to be the final straw for the Americans. President Theodore Roosevelt would fire back over on the Khanate's imperial ambitions, subjugation of peoples and belligerent attitude.\n\nAnd thus would lead to the American-Khanate War... and see the end of the Qing Khanate.\n\nDespite the superior numbers of the Qing Khanate, the Americans had the superior navy and well-versed in guerilla fighting. They would also get Southeast Asia, notably Vietnam over on their side to mount an invasion. The war would last from 1910-1920, coinciding with plenty of other wars, such as the Japanese Revolution, the Korean Revolution, the Mongol Revolution, the Manchu Civil War and finally the Ming Uprising. The war would end witth the Qing Khanate being dissolved. The new Khanate of Mongolia would inherit most of the land up north along with Dzungaria and parts of northern Manchuria. China would be liberated as the Zhu Dynasty or the Free Kingdom of China. Korea and Japan would achieve independence. China would begin climbing back into prominence, especially with growing investment into it. Japan meanwhile, while close with the Americans, would enter the British sphere of influence while Korea would end up over in the French sphere of influence. Southeast Asia meanwhile would end up more influenced by the Americans while China would ultimately focus up m\"ore on Central Asia along with parts of the Middle East. The Americans would be considered a superpower here along with earn plenty of admiration over in the Pacific. The Americans would take an increasing turn to the left as President Roosevelt used the politicla capital he gained to pass further reforms to improve the lives of the common man and curtail big business.\n\n\"Honestly, the Founding Fathers made the smart decision working with the Native Americans from the get-go and incorporating them into the Union. Sure it led to some weird moments of cultural influence and the nation having 70 states, but it did help avert potential cultural genocide and led to massive prosperity.\"\n\n\"Honestly, the Founding Fathers made the smart decision working with the Native Americans from the get-go and incorporating them into the Union. Sure it led to some weird moments of cultural influence and the nation having 70 states, but it did help avert potential cultural genocide and led to massive prosperity.\"\n\nQuoted from a lecture at Columbia University in 1968. During the Revolution, George Washington and the rest of the Continental Congress had scored an incredible coup by signing a number of treaties with the most developed Native American tribes; specifically the Haudenosaunee, Cherokee, Chickasaw, and Seminoles, among others. The greatest fear of these tribes was the expansion of the Americans over the Appalachian Mountains and into their territory. By ensuring their territorial, and by ultimate extension, cultural integrity, the tribes became an integral part of the American political infrastructure. With states of their own enshrined in the Constitution, this permitted more rapid development of the American West, though nevertheless leading to conflicts between the American-allied tribes and tribes further west such as the Lakota and Ojibwe.\n\n\"They have brought war to every corner of the world. They have sown death and destruction, they breed chaos and bloodshed, and now we shall bring war to their shores by whatever means it takes; be it by sword, by gun, or by barehand!\"\n\n\"They have brought war to every corner of the world. They have sown death and destruction, they breed chaos and bloodshed, and now we shall bring war to their shores by whatever means it takes; be it by sword, by gun, or by barehand!\"\n\nA statement released by the Grand Council of Haudenosaunee Confederacy (also called Iroquois) from 1946, three years into The Second Atlantic War, when the crown of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth was disputed between German and Austrian claimants. Germany was allied with Great Britain in the war, and they claimed some French American territories in AW1. Austria was allied with the French, who were in turn allied with the Haudenosaunee. In the new world, the Allies drove the British and Germans from Neufundland and New England, with the Haudenosaunee being given the remainder of New York and much of New England. After this, Haudenosaunee troops were brought to France, to prepare for an invasion of England. This invasion was initially very messy, with French and British fleet power roughly equal (the German fleet had been trapped in the Baltic when Denmark-Norway joined the war on the side of the French), however, after the Haudenosaunee Fleet completed the campaign to capture the Caribbean, they were relocated to Europe and were instrumental to gaining control of the channel, and Haudenosaunee troops were the first to capture London.\n\nIn the aftermath of the war, the Austrian claimant took charge in Poland-Lithuania, Germany lost some minor territories in Europe, and the vast majority of its colonial empire, with all its territories in the New World being given to the Haudenosaunee. King Charles XII, of the House of Anjou, enacted his claim on England, releasing Scotland and Ireland as independent nations, under French oversight, as well as claiming the British colonial empire for France. This empire would disassemble over the next few decades but would remain united in the French Domain, an organization of states that shared the house of Anjou as their sovereign.\n\nThe Haudenosaunee would become by far the dominant power in the new world, eventually pressuring European nations into removing their colonies entirely, with independent nations being founded, many of which copied the model of the Haudenosaunee themselves in their governments.\n\n\"Europe has always been my mistress, I love her so, which is why it pains me that when she rebels I must strike her hard! This is the burden which I must bear as ruler of all I survey.\""
