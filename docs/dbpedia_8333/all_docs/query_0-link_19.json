        "text": "Why were the beatles songs about love?\n\nMANY of The Beatles' songs were not about love. The songs that were about love were most likely written because the writer was in love...\n\nWhat songs were played on Delilah tonight?\n\nmany of love songs just turn off the tv and turn on the radio to 97.3 and relax with your love ones\n\nWhy does Justin Bieber sing love songs?\n\nwhy Taylor swift writes love songs because they are about her love life. About her problems. About her boyfriends. Taylor Swift's life is complicated so instead of talking about them she puts them into songs. By the way she does write some of her own music. So that is how she sings them."
