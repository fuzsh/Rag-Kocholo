I feel like a cartographer; I'm determined to fill a literary void,\" Cisneros says . . . . Born in Chicago in 1954, Cisneros grew up in a family of six brothers and a father, or \"seven fathers,\" as she puts it. She recalls spending much of her early childhood moving from place to place. Because her paternal grandmother was so attached to her favorite son, the Cisneros family returned to Mexico City \"like the tides.\" \"The moving back and forth, the new schools, were very upsetting to me as a child. They caused me to be very introverted and shy. I do not remember making friends easily, and I was terribly self-conscious . . . . I retreated inside myself.\" It was that \"retreat\" that transformed Cisneros into an observer, a role she feels she still plays today.\n\n--from \"Sandra Cisneros: Conveying the riches of the Latin American culture\"\n\nread first\n\nCommentary\n\nread second\n\nInterview From the September/October 2002 issue of Book magazine\n\nThen Read the Novel\n\nCaramelo has 86 short chapters and a Fin\n\nRead through Chapter 50 to page 299 for Tuesday\n\nPlease Submit Topics and Questions You Would Like to Discuss In Class\n\nFinish the novel for Thursday\n\nPlease Submit Topics and Questions You Would Like to Discuss In Class"
