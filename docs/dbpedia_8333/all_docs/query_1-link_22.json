        "text": "“Gathering data and reading…are not the same occupation…When you gather data, you become informed. When you read, you develop wisdom.” ~Susan Wise Bauer\n\n“To be informed is to know simply that something is the case. To be enlightened is to know, in addition, what it is all about.” ~Mortimer J. Adler\n\nIn this digital age, we’re inundated with facts and parcels of data. The internet offers up the world’s collective knowledge within the palm of your hand…which is wonderful, except that opportunities for deeper understanding seem scant. Plus, the ability to store everything in our phones and Google anything means that few of us bother to remember things.\n\nI love technology and I love that I can Google anything, so I don’t mean to say it’s a bad thing. We never know where technology will take us. Socrates himself was against the new technology of writing, and we all agree now that the written word is a beautiful thing.\n\n“[Writing] will create forgetfulness in the learners’ souls, because they will not use their memories; they will trust to the external written characters and not remember of themselves.” ~Socrates\n\nI just know that, for myself, I’d like a better balance between information and understanding.\n\nSo, my desire is to cultivate wisdom. My intention is to read through this literary list mindfully, scribbling in the book margins, taking notes in my literary commonplace books, and committing portions of certain texts to memory (take note, Socrates!).\n\nHow This Works\n\nThere is a book called The Well-Educated Mind (TWEM) by Susan Wise Bauer, which is a wonderful guide to “The Great Books” (both from the traditional literary canon written by dead, white, European men–or DWEMs–as well as Great Books written by women and people of color).\n\nTWEM presents 6 genres–each with a respective reading list (fiction, autobiography, history, drama, poetry, and science)–and explains how to go about reading them in the classical method: the Trivium. The Trivium is composed of a “Grammar Stage,” a “Logic Stage,” and a “Rhetoric Stage.” The grammar stage is where one simply takes in information and memorizes facts, the logic stage is where one learns to analyze, criticize, and identify fallacious arguments, and the rhetoric stage is where one learns to take the grammar knowledge together with the logic understanding to formulate arguments and persuade.\n\nBauer recommends reading chronologically genre-by-genre, but I’m afraid I’d get bored staying within the lines of one genre for such a long time. So I’ve decided to read chronologically across all genres and, in this way, read through history.\n\n“Writers build on the work of those who have gone before them, and chronological reading provides you with a continuous story…You’ll find yourself following a story that has to do with the development of civilization itself…When you read through the poetry list, for example…[t]he structure of the poetry will change as each poet moves beyond what former writers have done. But beyond these technical differences, the concerns of the poets shift and change as the world itself hurtles toward modernity…When you’ve finished this particular list, you’ve done more than read poetry. You have learned something about the spiritual evolution of the West.” ~Susan Wise Bauer\n\n“If you join at eleven o’clock a conversation which began at eight you will often not see the real bearing of what is said.” ~C.S. Lewis, on reading old books vs. new\n\nThe Reading List\n\nWithout further ado, here is the full book list from The Well-Educated Mind, plus many more. I took the liberty of adding a plethora of additional titles, as well as a “philosophy” category. And, just to contradict everything I said above, I don’t actually plan to read through perfectly chronologically. The fact is that this list will take me years to get through, and I’m not willing to wait 15 years before I “allow” myself to read some of the later books down the line! I’m mostly going to read in order, but if I suddenly feel compelled to read a more modern classic, I will without hesitation.\n\nBooks I’ve read are crossed out, and those for whom I’ve written up my thoughts are linked to that particular essay. (Note: I don’t bother with plot summaries because there are already hundreds of sites out there that do just that. My essays assume general knowledge of the work in question.)\n\nYear\n\n(From BCE to CE) Title\n\n(*denotes books not listed in TWEM) Author Genre 1 -2000 Gilgamesh unknown POETRY 2 -1500 The Rg Veda

That’s quite the list!\n\nBetween this and the SF&F sub-project list, it will take me ~20-30 years to read all of these books. In fact, my goal is to have read through my projects by 2050! That sounds like forever away, but it’s perfectly fine with me because the time will pass anyway. And let’s not forget: literature is to be relished, not rushed.\n\nBonus Reading List\n\nI continue to learn about classic literature from various cultures, perspectives, and countries. While I am incredibly tempted to add these to the above list, I realize I cannot keep changing the goal post on myself. In order the remain realistic with my reading goals, I’ve decided the above list can no longer increase. Instead, I’ll maintain the below “bonus” list to capture new-to-me classics that I hear about and am interested in reading. In this way, I won’t forget them, and I can work them in over the years as I please."
