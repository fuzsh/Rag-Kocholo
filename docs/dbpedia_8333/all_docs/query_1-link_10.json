        "text": "When I signed up to take a Survey of Chicano/Latino Literature course this fall, I imagined we’d spend the bulk of our time reading Mexican American authors from the 1980s to the present. I figured I would add a few books to those already on my bookshelf, written by Richard Rodriguez, Reyna Grande and Sonia Nazario.\n\nOh, how wrong I was.\n\nWhat I got instead was an introduction to a massive body of work encompassing over 400 years of writing in North America that transcends ethnicity and race while offering glimpses of Chicano, Puerto Rican and Cuban American identity — or just Hispanic or Latino identity.\n\nGuided by a broad-minded instructor, we did more than read a novel a week, as I’ve done in previous literature classes. Rather, we dipped in our toes in fiction, nonfiction, poetry and playscripts as we mined a 644-page anthology that reflected the rich diversity of Hispanic literature, going back before the founding of the United States. The book includes excerpts from dozens of writers.\n\nStep back for a moment, as I did, to visualize four overarching themes in our textbook “Herencia: The Anthology of Hispanic Literature of the United States,” edited by Nicolás Kanellos and published in 2002. (Herencia means “inheritance” or “heritage.”)\n\nThe Literature of Exploration and Colonization.\n\nNative Literature.\n\nThe Literature of Immigration.\n\nThe Literature of Exiles.\n\nThose four categories provided a sturdy framework for sampling the published work of everyone from the first Spanish explorers in Florida to native-born writers in the present-day Southwest to 20th century immigrant writers (heavily concentrated in Los Angeles and San Antonio) to exiled writers displaced from their homelands in Cuba, Puerto Rico and Central America.\n\nBefore 1960, roughly 90 percent of Hispanic literature was written in Spanish, which explains why so much of it has been overlooked by academics, let alone contemporary readers accustomed to English-language novels and newspapers. However, thanks to ten years of work by scholars and graduate students from throughout the U.S., Mexico, Cuba and Puerto Rico, the anthology we tapped into brims with material translated into English; in many cases, the book offers side-by-side English and Spanish text.\n\nThe breadth of all this work is impressive. “This literature incorporates the voices of the conqueror and the conquered, the revolutionary and the reactionary, the native and the uprooted or landless,” Kanellos says. “It is a literature that proclaims a sense of place in the United States while it also erases borders.”\n\n***\n\nThe Literature of Exploration and Colonization.\n\nFor better or worse, Spain was the first country to introduce a written European language into an area that would become the mainland United States. Beginning in 1513, with the travel diaries of Juan Ponce de León in Florida, the earliest writings about the Hispanic South and Southwest of the U.S. centered on descriptions of the fauna and flora of these lands, as well as of the indigenous people already here. (Not surprising to read condescending accounts of the colonizers’ encounters with indigenous people.)\n\nBy the mid-16th century, all the institutions of literacy — schools, universities, libraries, government archives and courts — had been introduced by Hispanic peoples to North America, and the publishing of books and newspapers was commonplace.\n\nNative Hispanic Literature.\n\nThe next phase, that of Native literature, developed first among Hispanics already residing in the Southwest when the U.S. gained a huge swath of territory including all of parts of eight present-day western states from Mexico in 1848, following the Mexican-American War. Many of these native writers exhibited an attitude of entitlement to civil, political and cultural rights. Keep in mind that these were the children of Spaniards who had earlier settled these lands and Mexicans, already living here, who suddenly found themselves occupying newly annexed areas of the United States north of the Rio Grande.\n\nOver the next century, U.S.-born writers of Puerto Rican, Cuban and Mexican heritage expanded the scope of literature about culture and folkways in those communities, as well as issues of acculturation, assimilation and citizenship facing all immigrant groups, whether in New York, Florida, California, New Mexico or Texas. Understandably, many of these writers spoke out against colonialism, segregation and exploitation, and several Chicano authors gravitated toward political activism.\n\n(Incidentally, Kanellos notes, the word “Chicano” is a working class derivation and abbreviation of the indigenous-based pronunciation of the name of the Aztec tribes, “Mechicano,” from which the name of Mexico is also derived.)\n\nIn time, the first generation of writers to cross over to mainstream publishing in English emerged in the 1970s, with several women among them. One of these, Denise Chávez, is part of my late father’s extended family. (More on her below.) During the ’80s, a new wave of Hispanic writers has emerged, almost all monolingual English-speaking and -writing. Among them Julia Alvarez, Sandra Cisneros, Gary Soto and Oscar Hijuelos, winner of the 1990 Pulitzer Prize for “The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love.”\n\nThese authors have produced coming-of-age novels and stories of immigrant adjustment to American society, similar to ethnic autobiographies written by other members of minority groups in the U.S.\n\nThe Literature of Immigration.\n\nThe next big development came at the turn of the 20th century. While New York had long served as a port of entry for people from Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, it was Los Angeles and San Antonio that received the largest number of Mexican immigrants and consequently became home to several Spanish-language publishing houses and newspapers.\n\nThese new arrivals wrote in their native language to maintain a connection with the homeland while attempting to adjust to a new society and culture here. Many authors protested discrimination, human rights abuses and racism; satirized or criticized the big cities they lived in; and typically grounded their work in the perspective of the working class.\n\nCulture conflicts of all types permeated much of their work; the most conservative of these writers even promoted the idea of a Mexican colony existing outside of Mexico and said people had a duty to maintain the Spanish language, keep the Catholic faith, and insulate their children from the allegedly low moral standards practiced by Anglo Americans.\n\nToday there is a cadre of immigrant writers like Junot Diaz, born in the Dominican Republic and raised in New Jersey, who are part of a generation educated in American colleges and who teach in university creative writing programs. Diaz won the 2008 Pulitzer Prize for “The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao” and teaches at M.I.T.\n\nThe Literature of Exiles.\n\nLast but not least, the literature of exiles is linked to significant moments in the political history of the Hispanic world from the beginning of the 19th century on. Initially, Spanish American colonies fought for independence from Spain, the French intervened in Mexico, and Spain and the United States went to war in 1898. Early in the 20th century, these events were followed by the Mexican Revolution, the Spanish Civil War, the Cuban Revolution, and repeated intrusions by the United States into the affairs of Central and South American countries.\n\nAll of these struggles contributed to hundreds of thousands of political refugees coming to the United States. The Spanish-speaking writers who emerged from these circumstances often expressed a yearning for their homeland, as well as sharp criticism of the political ideologies and repression they left behind. Further, many of these exiles have engaged in political fundraising, community organizing and plotting to overthrow regimes in their country of origin.\n\nL to R: José Marti (Cuba), Piri Thomas (Puerto Rican-Cuban-American) and Junot Diaz (Dominican American) are among the authors whose essays, poetry and fiction are featured in the “Herencia” anthology.\n\n***\n\nIf some or all of the above seems like a lot to absorb, you’re not alone.\n\nThis undergraduate course opened my eyes to the transnational and borderless nature of Hispanic literature of the United States. Certainly, I was well aware of many excellent books produced by Mexican American writers, but I hadn’t thought to expand the definition to include the early Spanish colonizers or to conceptualize the work of native, immigrant or exiled writers into distinct categories.\n\nFor this insight, I am indebted to Elena Aviles, an assistant professor of Chicano and Latino Studies at Portland State. who taught this course asynchronously during the fall term.\n\nAs a senior auditor, I’m not a big fan of online courses that don’t have a regular meeting time, but I understand why they’d appeal to many of PSU’s nontraditional students who are balancing work, child care and other responsibilities with their university classes.\n\nIn this format, students can access the course material any time they like — the syllabus, weekly assignments and key deadlines — and post their comments in discussion boards open to all.\n\nI took two classes during the fall term but realistically only had time to fully engage in one: The History of Now. As a consequence, I didn’t post any comments in the Hispanic literature class but did appreciate reading other students’ takeaways from the readings.\n\nDr. Aviles gave us a lot of freedom to choose the readings that most appealed to us from week to week. As a result, I sampled the work of as many different authors and topics as I could, including: “Two Views of Coney Island” by the Cuban essayist José Marti; “First Communion” by Tomás Rivera, a former Mexican American migrant worker who became an early leader of the Chicano literary movement; “How Poor Women Prostitute Themselves” by Luisa Capetillo, a feminist militant in Puerto Rico; and “Down These Mean Streets” by the native New Yorker Piri Thomas, born to a Puerto Rican mother and a Cuban father, who faced double racism because of his black skin and Hispanic background.\n\n***\n\nFamily ties.\n\nWhat a delight it was to see Denise Chávez mentioned in the “Herencia” textbook. Denise is an author, playwright and bookstore owner in Las Cruces, New Mexico, where she was born and raised. Her mother, Delfina, was a teacher and a cousin of my father, Catarino.\n\nDenise is 74 and still very active in the literary community and as a business owner. In a recent piece for New Mexico Magazine, she wrote about a refugee book drive that led to the establishment of a book distribution center in her bookstore serving refugees and asylum seekers making the same journey along a 1,600-mile road through Mexico, Texas, and New Mexico that served travelers for more than 200 years.\n\nRead the story here: “Libros para el viaje” (Books for the journey)\n\nThanks to that brief mention in the anthology, Denise and I have begun an open-ended conversation on social media with the hope of someday meeting in person"
