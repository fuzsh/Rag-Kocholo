        "text": "Well,\n\nWeek one is in the books, and I'm personally glad to have it behind us. I bet you are too. I want to thank you all again for persevering through all the difficulties and challenges of getting connected with our students during this first week of remote learning. We are so very grateful for all of you staying strong and continuing to find ways to navigate through all the glitches. I'm sure there are plenty of \"life lessons\" we can learn from this first week, and maybe we'll have time to reflect on those once we get into our groove, which I hope can happen in week two. Thank you all so much for everything you do. Remember, it's not how you start. It's how you finish!\n\nThoughts heading into WEEK TWO:\n\nThe most recent updates for student laptops is critical. Please, encourage all students to initiate this update.\n\nIf you are able, whether at school or working remotely, please hardwire your internet connection. This will help you to have a more steady video and audio connection.\n\nKeep setting the tone for our school. Be everything you want your students to be: Awake, Engaged, Positive, Enthusiastic, Prepared, Creative, and Optimistic.\n\nTaking attendance during the first few weeks of school is critical so that we can withdraw students who are not attending and get accurate enrollment counts.\n\nRemember to record at least one of your lessons for each course so that any students who need to access it due to absences or for review have that opportunity.\n\nDon't make your students \"sit and get.\" Have them moving, interacting, and talking.\n\nGive them reasons to have their cameras on. Make it important. As district devices are being updated, please encourage district laptop use and begin discouraging student cell phone use. One of the challenges with student cell phone use is that you cannot tell who the user is. As a result, we've been getting some Canvas bombing with inappropriate language and content.\n\nCheck in on your colleagues, especially any new members on your team.\n\nIn Skyward, you will see an \"A\" or \"B\" cohort designation for each student.\n\nAs always, stay tuned for more information as we receive it. Thank you all for everything you do!\n\nLatinX/Hispanic Heritage Month recognizes and celebrates the contributions of Americans tracing their roots to Spain, Mexico, Central America, South America and the Spanish-speaking nations of the Caribbean. The observance began in 1968 as National Hispanic Heritage Week. Two decades later, it was expanded to a month-long celebration, stretching from September 15 to October 15.\n\nThe timing is key. Hispanic Heritage Month — like its shorter precursor — always starts on September 15, a historically significant day that marks the anniversary of independence of five Latin American countries: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. The designated period is also a nod to those from Mexico and Chile, who celebrate their independence on Sept. 16 and Sept. 18, respectively.\n\nDid you know ...\n\n60.6 million Latinos make up 18% of our nation's population.\n\n12 states have a population of 1 million Latinos or more: Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Texas.\n\nThe terms \"Hispanic\" and \"Latino\" are often used interchangeably though they actually mean two different things. Hispanic refers to people who speak Spanish and/or are descended from Spanish-speaking populations, while Latino refers to people who are from or descended from people from Latin America. LatinX is the gender-neutral form of Latino/a.\n\nThere are 1.2 million LatinX/Hispanics serving in the U.S. armed forces.\n\nSpanish is the second most spoken language in the United States.\n\nDr. Ellen Ochoa was the first Hispanic woman astronaut to go into space.\n\nMario Molina won a Nobel Prize for his crucial work in understanding how the ozone layer is formed and depleted.\n\nRoberto Clemente was not only a famous baseball player, he was also a humanitarian who worked in the off-season organizing charity drives, donating his time and money.\n\nOctaviano Larrazolo was the first Hispanic woman U.S. Senator.\n\nJoseph Marion Hernández was the first Hispanic Member of U.S. Congress in 1822.\n\nIn 1990, Oscar Hijuelos was the first Hispanic writer to win a Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for his novel The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love.\n\nRomualdo Pacheco was the first Hispanic U.S. Representative, elected in 1876.\n\nJosé Ferrer was the first Hispanic to win an Oscar for Best Oscar in 1950 for the film Cyrano de Bergerac.\n\nCarlos Juan Finlay solved the mystery of what caused yellow fever in 1881.\n\nEzequiel Cabeza de Baca, New Mexico's second governor, was the first ever elected Latino governor in the United States.\n\nTom Fears was the first Hispanic Football Hall of Fame inductee.\n\nCarlos Santana was the first Hispanic Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee in 1998.\n\n(Source)"
