        "text": "American Chicano rock band\n\nFor other uses, see Los Lobos (disambiguation).\n\nLos Lobos (pronounced [los ˈloβos], Spanish for \"the Wolves\") is a Mexican-American rock band from East Los Angeles, California. Their music is influenced by rock and roll, Tex-Mex, country, zydeco, folk, R&B, blues, brown-eyed soul, and traditional music such as cumbia, boleros and norteños. The band rose to international stardom in 1987, when their version of \"La Bamba\" peaked at the top of the Billboard Hot 100, and also topped the charts in the United Kingdom, and several other countries. Songs by Los Lobos have been recorded by Elvis Costello, Waylon Jennings, Frankie Yankovic,[1] and Robert Plant.[2] In 2015, they were nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[3] In 2018, they were inducted into the Austin City Limits Hall of Fame. They are also known for performing the theme song for Handy Manny. As of 2024, they have been nominated for twelve Grammy Awards and have won four.[4]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\n1973–79: Formation and early releases\n\n[edit]\n\nVocalist and guitarist David Hidalgo and drummer Louie Pérez met at Garfield High School in East Los Angeles, California, and bonded over their mutual affinity for musical acts such as Fairport Convention, Randy Newman and Ry Cooder.[5][6] Pérez recalls, \"We're looking at each other, 'You like this stuff? I thought I was the only weird one.' So I went over to his house one day for about a year, which we spent listening to records, playing guitars, and starting to write songs.\"[5] The two borrowed reel-to-reel recorders from a friend and created multitrack recordings of music spanning from parody songs to free-form jazz.[5] They later enlisted fellow students Frank González, Cesar Rosas and Conrad Lozano to complete the group's lineup, in 1973.[6] Their first album, Los Lobos del Este de Los Angeles, was recorded at two studios in Hollywood in 1977 over a period of about four months. At that time, they all had regular jobs, and it was hard to get together for the sessions. To accommodate that situation, their producer Luis Torres would call the engineer, Mark Fleisher, who owned and operated a high-speed tape duplicating studio in Hollywood, to find a studio when he knew all the band members could get off work that night. Most of the songs were recorded at a studio on Melrose Avenue, located next to the Paramount studios at the time, and a low-priced studio on Sunset Boulevard.\n\nThe band members were unsatisfied with playing only American Top 40 songs and began experimenting with the traditional Mexican music they listened to as children.[6] This style of music received a positive reaction from audiences, leading the band to switch genres, performing at hundreds of weddings and dances between 1974 and 1980.[6] \"If you were married between 1973 and 1980 in East L.A., we probably played your wedding,\" said Louie Perez. \"They would pay us like $400 for the four of us, a case of beer, and all the mole we could eat...\" said David Hidalgo.[citation needed] However, Los Lobos took notice of the popular groups on the Hollywood music scene and added influences of rock to its sound.[6]\n\nOriginally, they called themselves Los Lobos del Este (de Los Angeles), which translates to The Wolves of the East (of Los Angeles), a play on the name of the norteño band Los Tigres del Norte. There was another conjunto band at the time named \"Los Lobos Del Norte\", which had released several albums already. The name was quickly shortened to Los Lobos.[7]\n\n1980–88: How Will the Wolf Survive? and commercial success\n\n[edit]\n\nThe band's first noteworthy public appearance occurred in 1980 at the Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles, when they were hired by David Ferguson and CD Presents to open for Public Image Ltd. On September 28, 1983, the band released an extended play entitled ...And a Time to Dance, which was well received by critics but sold only about 50,000 copies. Slash Records/Warner Bros Records was not confident enough in Los Lobos to release a standard 10-song LP. So they released a 7-song debut LP. Seven months after the release, the group won a Grammy Award for Best Mexican American Song in 1984[8] However, the sales of the EP earned the group enough money to purchase a Dodge van, enabling the band to tour throughout the United States for the first time.[8] Los Lobos returned to the studio in the summer of 1984 to record its first major-label album, How Will the Wolf Survive?[9] The album's title and the title song were inspired by a National Geographic article entitled \"Where Can the Wolf Survive,\" which the band members related to their own struggle to gain success in the United States while maintaining their Mexican roots.[8]\n\nLos Lobos were exposed to Rock and Roll audiences when they opened for The Clash, a punk/new wave group, and they later opened for a Los Angeles band the Blasters, with influences in rhythm and blues and rockabilly.[1] Steve Berlin, who was born in Philadelphia, played saxophone for the Blasters then left the group to join Los Lobos. When he joined the band, Berlin spoke about his similar record collection to the other members of Los Lobos, where they shared loves for George Jones and Hank Williams.[1]\n\nThe film Colors includes \"One Time, One Night\" in the opening credits, although the song was not included on the soundtrack album. In 1986, members of Los Lobos appeared alongside Tomata du Plenty in the punk rock musical Population: 1. In 1987, they released a second album, By the Light of the Moon. In the same year, they recorded some Ritchie Valens covers for the soundtrack of the film La Bamba, including the title track, which became a number one single for the band plus \"Come On Let's Go\" and \"Donna\" which also charted. In 1988, they followed with another album, La pistola y el corazón, featuring original and traditional Mexican songs. The album never peaked above #189 in the pop charts, but it did garner Los Lobos their second Grammy Award for Best Mexican American Album in 1990. Also in 1988 they contributed their cover of \"I Wan'na Be Like You (The Monkey Song)\", to the Disney tribute album Stay Awake: Various Interpretations of Music from Vintage Disney Films.\n\n1988–94: The Neighborhood and Kiko\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s the band toured extensively throughout the world, opening for such acts as Bob Dylan, U2 and the Grateful Dead.\n\nLos Lobos returned with The Neighborhood in 1990, and the more experimental Kiko (produced by Mitchell Froom) in 1992. Kiko sold more units (over 400,000 sold) than the previous two albums and was voted 'Album of the year' by the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Sun-Times.[citation needed] The band contributed a lively cover of \"Bertha\", a song which they often performed live, to the Grateful Dead tribute–rain forest benefit album Deadicated. In 1994 they also contributed a track, \"Down Where the Drunkards Roll\", to the Richard Thompson tribute album Beat the Retreat.\n\nOn the band's twentieth anniversary in 1993, they released a two-CD collection of singles, outtakes, live recordings and hits, entitled Just Another Band from East L.A.\n\n1995–98: Papa's Dream and Colossal Head\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1995, Los Lobos released the prestigious and bestselling record Papa's Dream on Music for Little People Records along with veteran guitarist and singer Lalo Guerrero. The album garnered a Grammy nomination for Best Children's Album. The band also scored the film Desperado. The album track \"Mariachi Suite\" won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance and was their 3rd Grammy Award.\n\nIn 1996, they released Colossal Head. In spite of the fact that the album was critically acclaimed, Warner Brothers decided to drop the band from their label. Los Lobos spent the next few years on side projects. The band contributed along with Money Mark to the AIDS benefit album Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin, produced by the Red Hot Organization, on which they performed \"Pepe and Irene.\"\n\n1999–2006: Mammoth Records, subsequent releases\n\n[edit]\n\nLos Lobos signed to Mammoth Records (a music division of The Walt Disney Company) in 1997 and released This Time in 1999. Mammoth also reissued 1977's Del Este de Los Angeles. In November 2000, Rhino/Warner Archives released the boxed set Cancionero: Mas y Mas.\n\nIn 2001, Los Lobos was awarded the El Premio Billboard Award.[10]\n\nThe band released their Mammoth Records debut, Good Morning Aztlan in 2002. They released The Ride in 2004 as an unofficial 30th Anniversary album. The Ride featured Tom Waits, Mavis Staples, Bobby Womack, Elvis Costello and others covering Los Lobos music with the band. They did a follow-up album in 2005, Ride This – The Covers EP featuring Los Lobos covers of songs by Dave Alvin, Waits, Costello and others.\n\nLos Lobos released its first full-length live-show DVD Live at the Fillmore in 2004. The DVD captures the band's act over a two-day period in July at the famed San Francisco venue.\n\nIn September 2006, Los Lobos released The Town and the City (Mammoth Records) to much critical acclaim.[11][12] The album's lyrics deal with Louis Perez's childhood in East Los Angeles, while the music provides complex and original soundscapes reminiscent of their previous release Kiko. Cartoonist Jaime Hernandez did the artwork for the album.[13] The album is told in the first person, with each song serving as an episodic step.[14]\n\n2007–present\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2007, Los Lobos performed a cover of Bob Dylan's \"Billy 1\" (from Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid) for the soundtrack to Todd Haynes's film I'm Not There. Also in 2007, they participated in Goin' Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino (Vanguard), contributing their version of Domino's \"The Fat Man.\"\n\nIn 2009, the group under contract to Disney Music released an album of Disney covers, Los Lobos Goes Disney (Disney Sound/Walt Disney Records)[15] and participated in a tribute album to the late Doug Sahm, Keep Your Soul: A Tribute to Doug Sahm (Vanguard). The same year, on October 13, they also played on the South Lawn of the White House during the \"In Performance at the White House: Fiesta Latina\" concert, celebrating Hispanic musical heritage.[16][17]\n\nIn 2010, Cesar Rosas and David Hidalgo were featured artists in the Experience Hendrix Tour.\n\nOn August 3, 2010, the group released their first album in four years, Tin Can Trust. In 2011, the group was nominated for two Grammy Awards for Tin Can Trust in the categories of Best Rock Instrumental Performance and Best Americana Album.\n\nIn 2011, the group was awarded the Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.[18][19]\n\nIn 2013, the group toured Europe supporting Neil Young and Crazy Horse.\n\nOn September 25, 2015, their album Gates of Gold was released.\n\nOn October 9, 2015, Los Lobos was nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for the first time.[3]\n\nIn 2017, Los Lobos appeared in the multi award-winning documentary film The American Epic Sessions directed by Bernard MacMahon, where they recorded \"El Cascabel\",[20] live direct-to-disc on the first electrical sound recording system from the 1920s.[21] During their session, the belt holding the 100Ib weight that powered the 1924 cutting lathe broke and Jack White had to rush to an upholstery shop to repair it.[22][23]\n\nLos Lobos was inducted into the Austin City Limits Hall of Fame in 2018.[24]\n\nOn October 4, 2019, Los Lobos released Llegó Navidad, an album of Christmas music from Central America and South America with Mexican folk songs, as well as an original song by Hidalgo and Pérez.\n\nOn January 1, 2020, Los Lobos performed on a Wells Fargo float in the Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California.\n\nThe band was a recipient of a 2021 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States government's highest honor in the folk and traditional arts.[25]\n\nOn July 30, 2021, Los Lobos released their 18th album, Native Sons, on New West Records. It is a collection of 12 songs written or performed by California based musicians (including Jackson Browne, The Beach Boys, The Blasters, Thee Midniters, Willie Bobo, and Lalo Guerrero) with one song written by Hidalgo and Pérez, the title track \"Native Sons\".[26]\n\nThe group's co-founder and former band member Francisco González died on March 30, 2022, at the age of 68.[27]\n\nOn April 3, 2022, at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards which was held at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas,[28] Los Lobos won their fourth Grammy Award for Native Sons, this time in the Best Americana Album category.[4]\n\nOn November 25, 2023, Los Lobos celebrated their 50th Anniversary at their alma mater, James Garfield High School in East Los Angeles with a sold out performance at the high school's auditorium. Two shows earlier that week in Los Angeles also sold out immediately: The Whisky a Go Go in West Hollywood and The Paramount Theatre in Boyle Heights.\n\nIn February 2024, Los Lobos were inducted into the California Hall of Fame.[29]\n\nIn April 2024, the 157-second trailer for a Los Lobos documentary titled Native Sons was released on YouTube. Among the people interviewed about Los Lobos are musicians Tom Waits, Linda Rondstadt, Ozomatli, Bonnie Raitt and actors Cheech Marin, Edward James Olmos and Chicano activist Dolores Huerta. The documentary will be released in 2025.\n\nMembers\n\n[edit]\n\nDavid Hidalgo – vocals, guitar, accordion, fiddle, requinto jarocho (1973–present)\n\nLouie Pérez – drums, guitar, jarana huasteca, vocals (1973–present)\n\nCesar Rosas – vocals, guitar, bajo sexto (1973–present)\n\nConrad Lozano – bass, guitarron, vocals (1973–present)\n\nSteve Berlin – keyboards, woodwinds (1982–present)\n\nFormer members\n\n[edit]\n\nFrancisco \"Frank\" González – vocals, mandolin, arpa jarocha (1973–1976; died 2022)\n\nRichard Escalante – bass, vocals (1973–1974)\n\nTouring musicians\n\n[edit]\n\nVictor Bisetti – drums, percussion (1990–2003)\n\nCougar Estrada – drums, percussion (2003–2011)\n\nEnrique \"Bugs\" González – drums, percussion (2012–2020)\n\nAlfredo Ortiz – drums, percussion (2021–present)\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nAlbums\n\n[edit]\n\nLos Lobos del Este de Los Angeles (Just another band from East L.A.), 1978\n\nHow Will the Wolf Survive?, 1984\n\nBy the Light of the Moon, 1987\n\nLa Pistola y el Corazón, 1988\n\nThe Neighborhood, 1990\n\nKiko, 1992\n\nPapa's Dream, 1995\n\nColossal Head, 1996\n\nThis Time, 1999\n\nGood Morning Aztlán, 2002\n\nThe Ride, 2004\n\nThe Town and the City, 2006\n\nLos Lobos Goes Disney, 2009\n\nTin Can Trust, 2010\n\nGates of Gold, 2015\n\nLlegó Navidad, 2019\n\nNative Sons, 2021\n\nLive albums\n\n[edit]\n\nLive at the Fillmore, 2005\n\nAcoustic en Vivo, 2005\n\nChuy's Tape Box, Vol. 1, 2005\n\nOne Time, One Night: Live Recordings Vol. 1, 2007\n\nOne Time, One Night: Live Recordings Vol. 2, 2010\n\nKiko Live, 2012 (Recorded February 24, 2006 at House of Blues, San Diego)\n\nDisconnected in New York City, 2013\n\nCompilations\n\n[edit]\n\nJust Another Band from East L.A. – A Collection, 1993\n\nEl Cancionero Mas y Mas, 2000 (boxed set)\n\nWolf Tracks – Best of Los Lobos, 2006\n\nExtended plays\n\n[edit]\n\n...And a Time to Dance, 1983\n\nRide This – The Covers EP, 2004\n\nSoundtrack, compilation, and guest appearances\n\n[edit]\n\nSi Se Puede!, Various Artists, 1977 (Pan American) – backing band on all tracks\n\nEating Raoul: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, 1982 (Varèse Sarabande) – \"Diablo Con Vestido\" and \"How Much Can I Do\"\n\nL.A.
