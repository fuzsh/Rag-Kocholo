        "text": "Finding a good book about Cuba not only transports you to the island but opens up a whole new cultural understanding about this island nation. I love to read books set in where I’m traveling to before the trip – and there is something special also about reading them while you’re there. Post-trip, reading books about Cuba takes me right back there in a heartbeat. Putting together a list of books to read about Cuba, is for me, not difficult. My reading habits go back decades and I’ve always read in the same way – full-on – binge reading on a topic. Visiting Cuba is an experience unlike any other and reading about it is the same. And so I’ve put together an eclectic list of books set in Cuba, books by Cuban authors, both classic and contemporary books about Cuba – and because for me it’s not complete without exploring the food – I’ve also included my favorite Cuban cookbooks. So what are you waiting for? Head on in and explore the best books set in Cuba!\n\nTHIS POST MAY CONTAIN COMPENSATED AND AFFILIATE LINKS. MORE INFORMATION IN OUR DISCLAIMER\n\nThe Best Books About Cuba\n\nYou simply cannot put together a list of books set in Cuba and books about Cuba without including Ernest Hemingway, but reading about Cuba shouldn’t be just based on him. So I’ve included some of the best-published Cuban authors as well as other established, but extremely readable authors.\n\nHere’s my ultimate Cuban Reading List. I’ll start with the best fictional books about Cuba because I love a good novel.\n\nThe Best Fictional Books About Cuba\n\nThe one thing that comes through when you’re looking at fictional books set in Cuba is the grittiness of them. The crime genre is strong in the best fiction books about Cuba, but also, too, is realism.\n\nThe Old Man and the Sea – Ernest Hemingway\n\nHemingway won the Pulitzer Prize for this novel, and it aided his Nobel Prize for Literature too. But more than those illustrious prizes, this is the quintessential Cuban novel. Hemingway lived in Cuba for about 20 years and he was a fisherman, so this tale, the Old Man and Sea, of an elderly Cuban fisherman who spends months trying to catch a giant marlin, albeit off the coast of Florida completely captures the spirit of Cuba.\n\nBuy the Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway here.\n\nOur Man in Havana – Graham Greene\n\nSatirical and set in Cuba before the Cuban Missile Crisis – this fabulous novel by English author, Graham Greene makes fun of intelligence services, especially the British MI6. Our Man in Havana, a black comedy is set in Havana during the Batista regime. It’s a fabulously entertaining read and was made into a film, set in Havana. This is truly one of the best novels about Cuba and a true classic.\n\nBuy Graham Greene’s “Our Man in Havana” here.\n\nHavana Bay – Martin Cruz Smith\n\nIn this, Cruz Smith’s fourth novel featuring investigator Arkady Renko, a decaying Cuba you’ll find gruesome murders, secret society ceremonies, international espionage, and a suicidal main character.

From Celia, the matriarch of the family who loves Cuba and Castro, to her daughter Lourdes, who fled to the USA. Celia’s younger daughter Felicia brings the Santeria religion into this sweeping Cuban novel. However, it’s Pilar, Celia’s granddaughter, based in New York, who does most of the “Dreaming in Cuban” in the novel. The highly charged family reunion – back in Cuba ends with the 1980 Mariel Boatlift. There’s dreams, idealism, corruption and more than a little magical realism involved in this novel set in Cuba.\n\nBuy Dreaming in Cuban here.\n\nThe Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love, Oscar Hijuelos\n\nHijuelos was the first Hispanic American to win the Pulitzer Prize. The Mambo Kings, as the 1990 Pulitzer Prize winner tells of Cuban brothers who move to the USA in the 1940s and pursue love and musical fame, appearing on the TV show, I Love Lucy. For the exploration of pre-revolutionary Cuba and the Cuban culture of the early and mid-20th century, there really isn’t anything better than the Mambo Kings and it will truly inspire you.\n\nBuy Oscar Hijuelos’s Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love here.\n\nThe Most Beautiful Girl in Cuba – Chanel Cleeton\n\nNew York Times bestselling author Chanel Cleeton’s may be fiction, but it’s inspired by true-life events – the story of Evangelina Cisneros, a legendary Cuban woman who changed the course of history. When American Publisher William Hearst learns of the light eighteen-year-old Cisneros, he publishes her image on the front page of his newspaper and proclaims her “The Most Beautiful Girl in Cuba”.

I’ll start with the history of Cuba because it is truly fascinating.\n\nCuba History Books\n\nThere’s no shortage of books about the history of Cuba – so we’ve focused on just a few that give you the history of some of her more famous residents and those which give an overall flavor of the history in an easy to read format.\n\nCuba – A New History – Richard Gott\n\nGott is a former Guardian Journalist who – amongst other things- was present in Bolivia to identify Che Guevara’s body when he was killed there. His seriously comprehensive Cuban history spans 500 years – right from the initial Spanish colonisation to today. This book on the history of Cuba covers the slaughtering of the indigenous population, slavery, racism before leaping into the war of Independence and occupation, however brief, by the Americans in 1898. Then on to Castro’s 1959 revolution, the Bay of Pigs Invasion in 1961 and how the country survived following the collapse of the USSR, on whom the country relied for so much. It is a rollercoaster of a ride through Cuba’s history – and if you can read one book on the history of Cuba, then you should make it this one.\n\nBuy Cuba A New History by Richard Gott here.\n\nBacardi and the Long Fight for Cuba, by Tom Gjelten\n\nYou’ll likely know the Bacardi name from their famous rum. And this is the story of that empire, which started in Cuba when Facundo Bacardí Massó moved to Cuba in the 9th century. At that time Rum was one of the least regulated spirits in the world. Bacardi is headquartered in Bermuda now and this book charts the history of the family’s relationship with Cuba. It’s also a fascinating understanding of Cuba’s economics.\n\nBuy Tom Gjelten’s “Bacardi and the Long Fight for Cuba” here.\n\nVoices from Mariel: Oral Histories of the 1980 Cuban Boatlift\n\nFrom April to September 1980 more than 125,000 refugees fled Cuba, to escape Castro’s dictatorship. The boats they fled in departed from the port of Mariel across the 90 miles of the Straits of Florida. This oral history is the story of the immigrants themselves. It is a sobering read that covers the largest overseas mass migration in Latin American history.\n\nBuy Voices from Mariel here\n\nBiographical Books about Cuba\n\nOften the spirit of a location comes alive with the biographical detail, we’ve collated our favorite books of a biographical nature about Cuba.\n\nChe Guevara: A Revolutionary Life, by Jon Lee Anderson\n\nYou can’t go to Cuba without understanding at least a little about the Cuban Revolution of 1959. Born into a rich family in Argentina, Guevara dedicated his life to overcoming oppression and championing revolution to overthrow those doing the oppressing. He eventually became the second most powerful man in Cuba and while he died pursuing another revolution in Bolivia, Guevara’s legacy remains influential in Cuba to this day. This is essential reading about Cuba.\n\nBuy Jon Lee Anderson’s “Che Guevara – a Revolutionary Life” here\n\nTrading with the Enemy – Tom Miller\n\nFor an account of life in modern Cuba, you won’t find anything better than Miller’s journalistic account. Miller traveled on his own, with no government minders – he explored Cuba for 8 months, and his entertaining, lively, and often gritty account of his travels through Cuba is a fascinating story of his time here. Miller convinced personalities and regular people to talk to him about food shortages, jokes, the black market, and everything in between. It’s a must-read for anyone considering a visit to Cuba.\n\nBuy Tom Millers “Trading with the Enemy” here.\n\nOne Day in December: Celia Sánchez and the Cuban Revolution\n\nSanchez played a pivotal role in the Cuban Revolution of 1959, but little is heard of her. She chose the historic Granma landing site. She fought with rebels. She collected documents that would become the official archives of the revolution. And after the revolution, she did much to enrich the lives of many Cubans – from launching literacy programs to creating parks and helping to develop the Cohiba cigar brand.\n\nBuy One Day in December: Celia Sánchez and the Cuban Revolution\n\nThe Best Books by Cuban Authors\n\nCuba has seen much turmoil throughout its history and there’s no better way to understand the country and how she has adapted than through her native authors. These authors are rarely heard of outside of Cuban literature, but these works by Cuban authors detail and document the struggles of the Cuban people and explore specific Cuban literary themes.\n\nJose Marti – Cuban national hero and author\n\nA Cuban national hero because of his role in the liberation of Cuba, Marti was also a Cuban journalist, poet, philosopher and publisher. Marti wrote a series of poems, essays, letters, lectures, novels, and a children’s magazine. He is most famous for one of his poems, “Simple Versus” – Versos Sencillos in Spanish which was adapted to the song “Guantanamera“, which has become the definitive patriotic song of Cuba.\n\nBuy books by Jose Marti, including Versos Sencillos here.\n\nAlejo Carpentier – creator of “Marvelous Real”\n\nThe concept of the “Marvelous Real” was defined by Alejo Carpentier as he attempted to understand the character of Latin America’s cultures, societies, nature and histories. Carpentier was born in Switzerland to Russo-French parents and grew up in Havana. His most famous work and example of the use of “Marvelous Real” is his 1949 novel, The Kingdom of this World, which covers the Haitian revolution of the late 18th century. This book of historical fiction wasn’t translated to English until 1957 and is a masterpiece of Cuban and Afro-Caribbean literature.\n\nBuy Alejo Carpentier’s The Kingdom of this World here.\n\nGuillermo Cabrera Infante\n\nCabrera Infante was a one time supporter of Castro but went into exile in London in 1965. His 1966 novel, “Three Sad Tigers” – Tres Tristes Tigres won the 1964 Premio Biblioteca Breve for the best-unpublished novel. It’s an experimental playful novel that is rich in literary allusions.\n\nBuy Guillermo Cabrer Infante’s Tres Triste Tigres here.\n\nReinaldo Arenas\n\nAnother opponent of the Castro regime, Arena didn’t actually leave Cuba until the Mariel boatlift of 1980, attempting to communicate his political ideas through a series of novels instead. He was initially a sympathizer then a critic of Castro and his work draws parallels between his life and the lives of his protagonists. His autobiography, Antes que anochezca (Before Night Falls) is a stark account of his struggles to be a gay writer in Cuba and beyond.\n\nBuy Reinaldo Arenas’ Before Night Falls here.\n\nDaina Chaviano\n\nCuba’s most prominent contemporary author of science fiction and fantasy was born in 1957 in Havana Cuba and has lived in the USA since 1991.
