        "text": "The four women of Las Migas come from four different cities that span not only the geography of Spain but also its cultural diversity. They all came to the group with one common passion: flamenco. You can hear it in the rhythms of the guitarists, the fluttering violin lines, and the raw power of the vocals. Carolina La Chispa is also a gifted dancer.\n\nThen the group started to evolve. Latin rhythms gave the music a happier, more upbeat sound. And a sensitive side began to emerge in beautiful ballads as Carolina expanded her emotional range, the violin lines grew more pensive, and the guitar arrangements turned more complex and intertwined. The dance also became more interpretive and free-flowing. The new Las Migas style was established, and has thrived.\n\nFrom the beginning, the Barcelona-based quartet has filled big theaters and performed in some of the most important world-music festivals. Their new music is more luminous, with a strong Latin touch. Their style on stage, from their clothing and makeup to their staging, reflects a richness that enhances the impact of the music.\n\nLas Migas is formed by Carolina La Chispa (vocals), Marta Robles (guitar), Alicia Grillo (guitar) and Laura Pacios (violin). After having been nominated for the Latin Grammy Awards 2017 with their latest album “Vente Conmigo” as the best Flamenco album, they begin 2018 with the new show “Érase una vez Las Migas”, prelude to what will be their fourth album, which is expected for the next winter. The 2018 tour will take them around Spain, Europe, USA and Mexico.\n\nThe band reconnects with its more flamenco roots incorporating Bego Salazar as her new vocalist, although always keeping that freshness and inimitable style that characterizes this Barcelonian quartet. The show is a journey through the most recognized and beloved songs of all their former albums, counting on the participation of their fans to elaborate a chosen repertoire, as well as some unpublished themes.\n\nCuration Note\n\nLas Migas brings a unique fusion of flamenco, Mediterranean, and folk influences to the stage, captivating audiences with their vibrant and soulful performances. Their innovative approach to traditional music aligns perfectly with ArtPower at UC San Diego’s mission to present diverse and boundary-pushing artistic experiences that inspire and engage. We are thrilled to welcome Las Migas to UC San Diego’s Epstein Family Amphitheater, where their dynamic energy and artistic excellence will undoubtedly leave a lasting impression on our audience.\n\n—Liz Bradshaw, Associate Director of Artistic Planning and Outreach"
