        "text": "Key Takeaways\n\nUna Stubbs and Emma Barton’s connection transcended the screen as they portrayed fictional relatives.\n\nStubbs’ portrayal of Barton’s aunt on EastEnders led some viewers to believe there was a familial connection outside the show.\n\nThe bond between Stubbs and Barton resonates deeply, with Barton affectionately referring to Stubbs as her “Aunt” even off-camera.\n\nDespite lacking a blood connection, Emma Barton and Una Stubbs are united by their mutual love for acting, forged further through their work together on the series ‘EastEnders.’\n\nTheir family backgrounds show that Emma Barton and Una Stubbs have no familial ties.\n\nThe Fictional and Real Bonds of Una Stubbs and Emma Barton\n\nIn 2006, Una Stubbs and Emma Barton played fictional relatives on screen (EastEnders), but their connection didn’t end when the cameras stopped rolling.\n\nWhile Stubbs portrayed Barton’s aunt for a brief period, their friendship continued beyond the set. However, it’s worth clarifying that they’re not related in real life.\n\nEmma joined the show in 2005, taking on the role of Honey Mitchell, a character central to numerous family-centric storylines.\n\nUna appeared on the show in 2006, appearing in only six episodes as Caroline, Honey Mitchell’s aunt.\n\nThis mistakenly led viewers to believe they have a familial tie outside the show, but that’s not the case.\n\nDespite their short on-screen time together, their bond felt like family.\n\nEmma affectionately refers to Una as her “Aunt” even when they’re not filming.\n\nIn interviews, Emma has openly expressed her joy in calling Una her aunt, reflecting the genuine affection between the two actresses.\n\nEmma Barton and Una Stubbs Don’t Share Any Familial Ties\n\nEmma Barton, daughter of Penelope and David Barton, was born on July 26, 1977, in Portsmouth, Hampshire, England.\n\nShe attended Horndean Community School from 1989 to 1993 before pursuing her passion for acting at the Guildford School of Acting, where she graduated in 1998.\n\nPreviously married to lawyer Nigel Stoat, the couple tied the knot in 2002 but sadly parted ways three years later, shortly after Barton’s debut on EastEnders.\n\nOn the other hand, Una Stubbs, born on May 1, 1937, in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, England, is the daughter of Clarence Reginald Stubbs and Angela K. Rawlinson.\n\nGrowing up in Hinckley, Leicestershire, she was enrolled in La Roche dancing school in Slough by her mother.\n\nStubbs was married to actor Peter Gilmore from 1958 to 1969, during which they adopted a son named Jason.\n\nFollowing their divorce, she wed actor Nicky Henson, though their marriage ended in 1975.\n\nDespite their split, Stubbs and Henson remained close friends.\n\nShe and Henson were blessed with two children: composer Christian Henson, born on December 25, 1971, and musician-composer Joe Henson, born on September 18, 1973.\n\nIn Case You Didn’t Know\n\nEmma has been in a relationship with Jason Perry, a music producer and former frontman of the British rock band A, for over a year."
