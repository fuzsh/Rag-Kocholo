        "text": "Actress Una Stubbs known for her TV roles in Sherlock and Fawlty Towers has died aged 84\n\nThe veteran actress, who grew up in Hinckley, had been ill for a few months, her agent told BBC News.\n\nA statement on behalf of the family said she died at her home in Edinburgh surrounded by her family.\n\nREAD MORE: O2, Three, Vodafone and EE mobile phone customers issued urgent warning\n\nIt read: \"Mum passed away quietly today with her family around her, in Edinburgh. We ask for privacy and understanding at this most difficult and sad of times.\"\n\nHer agent Rebecca Blond said: “We are desperately sad to have lost not only a wonderful actress, whose screen and stage career, spanning over 50 years, was so extraordinarily varied, from Till Death Us Do Part to Sherlock, as well as memorable performances in the West End, at the Old Vic, Donmar Warehouse, Sheffield Crucible and National Theatre, but also a wickedly funny, elegant, stylish, graceful, gracious and kind and constant friend.\n\nKeep up with the latest news with our email alerts directly to your inbox. Sign up here.\n\n“She was also a highly respected and exhibited artist. We will miss her enormously and remember her always.”\n\nUna was best known recently for her role as Mrs Hudson in the BAFTA award winning BBC show Sherlock, starring alongside Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman.\n\nShe was also very well known for starring in Summer Holiday, alongside Cliff Richard, as well as playing Rita Rawlins in BBC sitcoms Till Death Do Us Part and In Sickness and In Health.\n\nShe was also known for playing Aunt Sally in Worzel Gummidge, and appearing in other TV shows such as Fawlty Towers, Agatha Christie's Marple, and Call The Midwife.\n\nShe found fame in the 1960s and remained one of the UK's best-loved screen stars.\n\nFor several years, she was a team captain in the weekly game show Give Us A Clue in the 1980s and also made appearances in Heartbeat, Benidorm, Victoria Wood’s We’d Quite Like To Apologise and The Catherine Tate Show.\n\nShe also played Caroline Bishop in the BBC soap EastEnders and more recently appeared in The Durrells and Midsomer Murders.\n\nIn addition to her work as an actress, Stubbs was also a keen amateur painter who had her work displayed at the Royal Academy in London.\n\nStubbs was married to actor Peter Gilmore from 1958 to 1969, with whom she adopted son Jason, and then married Nicky Henson in 1969, before they split in 1975.\n\nThe couple had two sons, Joe and Christian, both of whom are composers."
