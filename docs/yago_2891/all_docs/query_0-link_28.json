        "text": "You might remember her as the sweet but feisty Mrs Hudson from BBC's adaptation of 'Sherlock', or if you are a fan of old British TV series, then you might know her as Aunt Sally from 'Worzel Gummidge'. We are talking about the incredible Una Stubbs, who died tragically on August 12, 2021, following an illness. The former dancer and seasoned thespian's death left an indelible loss for the artist community.\n\n\"Mum passed away quietly today with her family around her, in Edinburgh. We ask for privacy and understanding at this most difficult and sad of times,” read a statement from her children. She might have been the show-stealer on screen, but in real life, she was a doting mother of three. Stubbs is survived by her three sons Christian Henson, Joe Henson, and Jason Gilmore.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nCelebrity deaths in 2021: From Christopher Plummer to Larry King, the full updated list of stars who'll never fade\n\n'Freaky Friday' actress Barbara Harris dies at 83\n\nBorn in Hertfordshire and brought up in Leicestershire, Stubbs was the great-granddaughter of legendary urban planner Sir Ebenezer Howard and also the niece of cricketer Geoffrey Howard. She made her debut on television in 1956 at the age of 19 years. Her first TV appearance was on the music show 'Cool for Cats' as a Dougie Squires Dancer. In the initial days of her career, she also worked in cabarets and clubs across London while striving to make it as an actor. Her breakthrough role came in 1963 in Cliff Richard's film 'Summer Holiday'. By that time, Stubbs was already a married woman. She married fellow actor Peter Gilmore in 1958, well-known for portraying Captain James Onedin in the BBC period drama 'The Onedin Line'. During their marriage, the couple adopted their son Jason Gilmore. However, marital bliss was short-lived for the two as they divorced in 1969.\n\nThe same year, Stubbs got married to her second husband Nicky Henson, who was also an actor. She had two sons with Henson - Christian Henson was born in 1971 and Joe Henson was born in 1973. Stubbs and Nicky Henson divorced in 1975 and she has not married anyone since. Stubbs raised all her three sons on her own. In a 2017 interview, Stubbs remarked that she could not live without her sons, admitting all of them were still very close. \"I still have the most marvelous memories from their childhood. The bond you have with your children doesn't change as they grow older, and we are all still very close,\" she had added. She also recalled being a \"strict mother\" but in a \"sweet way\".\n\nAmong her sons, both Christian and Joe Henson are musically inclined and made their mark as composers. Christian, for instance, is well-known for rendering music to video games like 'Zubo', 'Assassin's Creed', 'Alien: Isolation', alongside TV shows like 'Fresh Meat', 'Home' and 'Inside No. 9'. Joe Henson has given music for projects like 'Ripper Street', 'Mongrels' and 'Drugsland'. Her adopted son Jason Gimore's profession is not clearly known. It is believed that Stubbs breathed her last in presence of her beloved sons and close members of the family."
