        "text": "One of my earliest memories is of the bombing of Coventry during the second world war. I grew up in Hinckley, in Leicestershire, and remember us all sitting under the great big dining table with our father, and you could hear the bombs dropping. I was very frightened and recall saying to my mother that if the war came again, please could we live in the country.\n\nI was the dreaded middle child. My sister Claire is two years older than me, and my brother Paul is two years younger. I say \"dreaded\" because the youngest is adored and spoilt, and the oldest is the boss, so you are not sure where you fit. I was bossed around and not quite sure of myself.\n\nMy childhood was not an easy one. I'm not sure my parents were happily married, but my father was very loyal to my mother, which was admirable. My mother, Angela, was quite a depressive and took to her bed a lot. I remember saying to her: \"Please be in a good mood today.\" That didn't go down well. I did everything I could to try to please her; I didn't understand that she was depressed. You always thought maybe it was your fault.\n\nMy father, Clarry – short for Clarence, which he didn't like – was in the Home Guard in London during the war, so he was away a lot at first. But he made sure he came back to us when he could, even sleeping rough on the way home. He was the most wonderful, jolly father. He always came home with toys he had made – Perspex toys from aeroplane windows, and bracelets and rings.\n\nI had always wanted to be a mother and have three boys, Jason, 45, Christian, 39, and Joe, 37. I was strict, but in a sweet way, I hope, because I was a single mother and couldn't have them running wild. My father was a wonderful role model for them, too – he and my mother would babysit when I worked.\n\nI was married twice [to Onedin Line actor Peter Gilmore and then to Nicky Henson] and I'm proud that Nicky remains a good friend. I was probably a boring wife. Once I saw Nicky with Marguerite [Henson's wife, ballerina Marguerite Porter] and I said: \"Nicky, is that how I was supposed to be?\" He said, \"I think so.\" I sort of realised where I'd gone wrong – being dull and too compliant, not speaking my mind.\n\nI learned a lot about myself when my son Christian had a brain aneurysm 13 years ago. When you have to hold everything together you realise how powerful you are. Christian was being strong, so we couldn't be drippy around him.\n\nHaving grandchildren is the biggest bonus. I have five and another on the way. I've realised that young people have a fixation with death. My four-year-old grandson said: \"I love you so much, Granny. I'm glad you're not dead yet.\" And I framed a letter from my granddaughter who lives in Spain – it says: \"You're the best English granny in the world. Please don't ever die.\"\n\nI suffer from melancholy, probably inherited from my mother. But I'm able to sort it out by walking a lot on my own or seeing friends. I truly believe happiness is a choice. You're not owed it. Apart from times when you're heartbroken and it's right to be sad, you realise you can either go on and on feeling sad and it affects everybody, or you think: \"Right, I'm going to start trying to pull myself together.\" You have a choice to go up or down."
