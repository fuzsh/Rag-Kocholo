It discussed several of her ancestors, including her great-grandfather Sir Ebenezer Howard, who was the founder of the garden city movement, and was the driving force in the design and creation of the first garden cities, Letchworth Garden City and Welwyn Garden City, situated in Hertfordshire.\n\nShe was married to the actor Peter Gilmore from 1958 to 1969: they adopted a son, Jason. After their divorce in 1969, she married actor Nicky Henson. They divorced in 1975 but remained good friends. She and Henson had two children: composer Christian Henson (born 25 December 1971), and musician-composer Joe Henson (born 18 September 1973)\n\nIn 2015, she co-presented The Big Painting Challenge on BBC One alongside Richard Bacon.\n\nShe was in the original cast of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time at the National Theatre in 2012, too."
