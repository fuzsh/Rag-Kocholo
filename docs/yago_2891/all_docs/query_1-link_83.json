        "text": "Actor Una Stubbs passed away on August 12 at the age of 84. According to a statement made by her sons Joe and Christian Henson and Jason Gilmore, the actor passed away quietly today with her family around her, in Edinburgh. She was recognised for her roles in TV shows like Till Death Us Do Part, Worzel Gummidge, Sherlock and EastEnders.\n\nThe statement by the actor's children added, \"We ask for privacy and understanding at this most difficult and sad of times.\"\n\nAccording to the British actor's agent, Stubbs died at her home in Edinburgh. Reportedly, Stubbs had not been keeping well for the past few months.\n\nWho Was Una Stubbs?\n\nHailing from the Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, a town in England, Stubbs started her career as a dancer and later switched to acting.\n\nThe actor first tied knots with actor Peter Gilmore (1958-69) and then to actor Nicky Henson (1969-75). She is survived by three children and two of them are music composers.\n\nStubbs adopted her firstborn Jason while she was \">married to Gilmore and then became a mother to Nicky and Peter during her marriage with Henson.\n\nInitially, Stubbs used to sketch vignettes of characters around London and held exhibitions near her home in Mayfair. Her paintings were also exhibited at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition on multiple occasions.\n\nStubbs' death is being mourned on every social media platform. The actor was reported to be seriously ill for the past few months.\n\nStubbs is also referred to as Aunt Sally by Millenials owing to her memorable performance as the same in Worzel Gummidge. She also played Alf Garnett’s exasperated daughter Rita in Till Death Us Do Apart. The show saw the 1980s follow-ups ‘Til Death and In Sickness and In Health. She garnered major recognition through these roles on the small screen.\n\nStubbs's last major role was playing Sherlock’s landlady Mrs Hudson in the BBC drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch."
