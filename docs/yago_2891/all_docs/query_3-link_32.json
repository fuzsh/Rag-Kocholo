In 2008 she joined Reader's Digest as a contributing editor and writer of fiction.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nImogen Stubbs was born in Rothbury,[1] Northumberland, lived briefly in Portsmouth, Hampshire, where her father was a naval officer, and then moved with her parents to London, where they lived on a vintage river barge on the Thames. She was educated at Cavendish Primary School, then at two independent schools: St Paul's Girls' School and Westminster School, and then Exeter College, Oxford,[2] gaining a First Class degree.[3]\n\nHer acting career started at Oxford, where she played Irina in a student production of Three Sisters at the Oxford Playhouse. After graduating, she enrolled at RADA, and while there had her first professional work, playing Sally Bowles in Cabaret at the Wolsey Theatre, Ipswich.[4] In 1982 she also appeared in her first film, Privileged.\n\nStubbs graduated from RADA in the same class as Jane Horrocks[5] and Iain Glen, and later became an Associate Member of RADA.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the 1980s Stubbs achieved success on stage with the Royal Shakespeare Company, notably as Desdemona in Othello, which was directed by Trevor Nunn. Other stage work includes Saint Joan at the Strand Theatre and Heartbreak House at the Haymarket, and in 1997 she played in a London production of A Streetcar Named Desire.\n\nIn 1988, Stubbs was a notable Ursula Brangwen in a BBC serialization of The Rainbow, and in 1993 and 1994 had the title role in Anna Lee. She played Lucy Steele in Sense and Sensibility (1995).\n\nIn July 2004, Stubbs's play We Happy Few, directed by Trevor Nunn and starring Juliet Stevenson and Marcia Warren, opened at the Gielgud Theatre, London, after a try-out in Malvern.[6] In September 2008 Reader's Digest announced that she had joined the magazine as a contributing editor and writer of adventure stories.[7]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1994, Stubbs married Trevor Nunn.[8] The couple have two children:[9] a son and a daughter, Ellie Nunn, who is also an actress.[10] In April 2011, Stubbs announced that she and her husband were separating.[11] Her partner is Jonathan Guy Lewis.[2][3]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1982 Privileged Imogen 1986 Nanou Nanou 1988 Megan David 1989 Erik the Viking Princess Aud 1991 True Colors Diana Stiles 1991 Narrator Voice 1994 Mother 1995 Jack and Sarah Sarah 1995 Sense & Sensibility Lucy Steele 1996 Twelfth Night Viola 2003 Collusion Mary Dolphin 2004 Dead Cool Henny 2011 Babysitting Mrs. Wollenberg Short 2014 Insomniacs Alice Short 2016 Stake Out Sally Short 2017 Kew Gardens Isabella Short, post-production 2018 London Unplugged Isabella Anthology film\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1985 Mrs. Gilbert TV film 1988 Ursula Brangwen TV miniseries 1988 Deadline Lady Romy Burton TV film 1990 Fellow Traveller Sarah Atchison In the Screen Two series 1990 Relatively Speaking Ginny Whittaker TV film 1990 Pasternak Lara / Olga (voice) TV film 1990 Theatre Night Desdemona \"Othello\" 1992 Sandra, c'est la vie Marie TV film 1992 Performance Helen Banner \"After the Dance\" 1993 Anna Lee: Headcase Anna Lee TV film 1994 Anna Lee Anna Lee Main role 1996 1914–1918 (voice) \"Total War\" 1997 Screen Two Suzie \"Mothertime\" 2000 Blind Ambition Annie Thomas TV film 2000 Big Kids Sarah Spiller Main role 2001 Lee Evans: So What Now?
