        "text": "Una Stubbs, the veteran British actress best known to American audiences for her role as Mrs. Hudson, the landlady to Benedict Cumberbatch’s Sherlock Holmes on the popular BBC series “Sherlock,” died on Thursday at her home in Edinburgh. She was 84.\n\nHer death was confirmed by her agent, Rebecca Blond.\n\nMs. Stubbs was a recognizable face in Britain, where she had appeared in comedic and dramatic roles onstage, onscreen and on television for more than half a century, including on the long-running soap opera “EastEnders” and the sitcom “Till Death Us Do Part,” the inspiration for the long-running American hit “All in the Family.”\n\nAmerican television viewers knew her best as the motherly landlady to the master detective Sherlock Holmes. on “Sherlock.” That show, which aired from 2010 to 2017, was an international hit, and Ms. Stubbs turned Mrs. Hudson into a fan favorite by making her a cheerful foil for the show’s darker themes.\n\nMrs. Hudson was a bit of a phantom in Arthur Conan Doyle’s famous stories about Holmes, on which the show was based. So Ms. Stubbs and the show’s creators built her into a comedic parental figure with a checkered past.\n\n“I am the mother of three sons, so I thought that would be a good angle to go on,” Ms. Stubbs told The New York Times in 2016. “I once told Benedict that my sons go straight to the fridge and make themselves sandwiches, and he did that in one episode.”\n\nShe added that the creators of “Sherlock,” Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat, “have made me more saucy now, and a bit grubby, which I enjoy.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
