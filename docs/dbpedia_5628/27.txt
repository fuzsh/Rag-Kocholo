We are happy to announce that as of this week, Vinçotte has been appointed as a certified body for nuclear inspections in the Netherlands.

As we are already recognised by the Belgian and French authorities, this designation by The Netherlands once again confirms our expertise and experience in this field.

Just before the start of the Summer holidays, we got invited to the Innoptus Solar Team 'Race to South Africa' partner event. A bright sunny day where we learned more about the history of the team, the upcoming challenge and a chance to see the solar car in action. Soon the car will be leaving for South Africa! Good luck to Innoptus. Let's hope the upgraded Infinite car can go for gold again!

Hard to believe it was already a week ago that Innoptus Solar Team invited us to their partner event to unveil the upgraded Infinite solar car in preparation of the Sasol Solar Challenge in South Africa later this year.

Looking forward to seeing you win the 2024 race.
