        "text": "If you’re looking for something to read during the holidays, I’d like to share with you my latest ‘Note to The B Team’ about how we can catalyze meaningful #leadership that leaves no one behind. It’s a privilege for me to be part of the #BTeam community co-founded by Sir Richard Branson and Jochen Zeitz. Together, we are working to redefine the role of business to make it more sustainable, equitable and accountable. As CEO of Syensqo and as a scientist, I see #sustainability through a humanist lens. Remember, true #leadership serves the business, the planet, and its people—not the other way around. Great leaders practice the power of AND. By this I mean embracing ideas and behaviors that others might perceive as opposite or in conflict. Leaders who are daring AND caring. Leaders who are guided by science AND deeply human. Leaders who are strong yet humble AND show vulnerability. The power of AND is about believing in and embracing both, demonstrating that business can be both sustainable AND profitable. At Syensqo we are proving just that! And we can’t do it alone. Achieving net zero is complicated in hard-to-abate sectors like ours, there’s no hiding the fact. With such ambitious goals, collaboration across companies and industries is mission critical. That’s why partnerships with change-makers like the B-Team, the WBCSD – World Business Council for Sustainable Development, the European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic), and the European Round Table for Industry - ERT, to name a few, demonstrate what we can achieve through the power of united leadership. Together we are driving change worldwide. There is little room in the world for companies that are not serious about sustainability, so let’s get back to it. We all have a role to play, more than ever. We are the very last generation who have the luxury to make a change. Let’s not waste this opportunity. Read more in the link below! #Syensqo #WeAreExplorers #AdvancingHumanity #ThoughtLeadership #Innovation\n\nOur Q2 #Results are now available! After seven months, we are proud to be an up and running company, delivering on our objectives and winning investors’ confidence as we accelerate the execution of our growth strategy. In Syensqo’s second quarter, we delivered results in line with expectations. While coping with headwinds, we saw an improvement in volume momentum, which led to an underlying EBITDA of €378M for the second quarter, an increase of 4% compared to the first quarter of 2024. We maintained solid margins and achieved a strong cash conversion of 88%. As an organization, we continue to execute on our strategy, innovating to accompany our customers’ needs, as we remain focused on outperforming our industry. Looking forward, we narrowed our outlook for the year, amid a challenging macroeconomic environment as we have yet to witness a recovery in demand. Let me emphasize one fundamental point: We remain confident that #Syensqo is on the right side of history. The #energytransition is happening; the world will utilize natural resources more efficiently, operate more sustainably – and Syensqo will play a pivotal role in making this happen! We believe our confidence is shared by #investors: in June, we successfully completed a 1.2 billion US dollar bond offering, which was more than four times oversubscribed. Above all, my heartfelt gratitude goes to our teams for delivering on our commitments. We are indeed explorers, and exploration was never meant to be easy. We’ll keep working towards our ultimate goal: advancing humanity. https://bit.ly/3WlHKU0 #WeAreExplorers #AdvancingHumanity #FinancialResults Christopher Davis Elizondo Rodrigo #customercentricity\n\nHuge congratulations to team Syensqo-DS PENSKE Formula E Team! As the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship's season 10 has come to an end, I am so proud of the DS PENSKE Formula E Team for securing 3rd place in the Team championship. This is a significant achievement! My heartfelt congratulations also go out to our drivers, Stoffel Vandoorne (Belgium) and Jean-Eric Vergne (France), for their personal achievement. Your hard work and fighting spirit have truly paid off. Jean-Eric, for example, made his mark on the history of the all-electric series with the highest number of pole positions in Formula E (17) as well as the record for the most points scored in the series (1133). At #Syensqo, we are living our mission as explorers and pioneers who advance electric technology and sustainable #innovation that will transform mobility. Our partnership with the DS PENSKE Formula E Team is an important part of it! And what I also love is the great sportsmanship mentality that comes with it. I saw it in action at the Misano E-Prix (Italy), and I think it applies brilliantly to Syensqo too. Success can only be achieved if you have the right team and promote continuous training. And like in sports, delivering peak performance also requires time to rest, recharge and focus. As we gear up for the next season, I feel truly proud to play a part in one of the world’s most sustainable #sports - and I can’t wait for season 11! #DSautomobiles DS Automobiles DS Performance #AdvancingHumanity #WeAreExplorer #EVs\n\nDo you read the label of your beauty products? I certainly do! Did you know that Syensqo’s guar-based ingredients are in one out of five hair care products, and that a whopping 90% of our #responsiblebeauty portfolio is #biobased? With consumers and brands pushing for more sustainable hair products and eco-conscious solutions, #Syensqo is here to help! We are leveraging the capabilities of our business and our Renewable Materials and Biotechnology growth platform to create safe and #biodegradable ingredients and processes that minimize waste and promote resource efficiency. That’s why we’ve launched a biodegradability score for our #beauty care ingredients. This score, ranging from A to D and based on OECD - OCDE testing standards, assesses how well materials break down through microbial action. For example, NaternalTM, our line of bio-based and biodegradable polymers stemming from Syensqo’s “Biodegradability by Design” approach, harnesses the power of guar - a versatile legume sourced through the Sustainable Guar Initiative, our #responsiblefarming program in Northern India - as a perfect thickener or conditioning agent for your hair… AND is safe for the planet! For us at Syensqo, beauty meets circular innovation to create products that are both sustainable AND profitable! https://bit.ly/3WmoBS1 #WeAreExplorers #AdvancingHumanity #circulareconomy\n\nI spotted this in The Nobel Prize! The 1927 Solvay physics conference photo is my favorite. It features no less than 17 #NobelPrize laureates and Google calls it “the most intelligent picture ever taken in the history of humanity.” Remember, it was our founder Ernest Solvay who brought together the greatest scientific minds of his time to share knowledge and ideas at the Solvay Conferences… including my personal hero, Marie Curie - the only woman to win the Nobel Prize twice. She inspired me, as a young girl in Morocco, to dream, and to dream big: she made me realize that I, too, could become a scientist. But I admired more than her scientific achievements. I loved her passion and her pioneering spirit. Through her determination and hard work she changed the world and inspired many young women scientists after her. And this legacy lives on at Syensqo: championing scientific originality, supporting cutting-edge research and rewarding risk-takers – to push the limits of science and create breakthroughs that advance humanity! #Syensqo #WeAreExplorers #AdvancingHumanity #STEM #innovation\n\nI’m thrilled to share the next #Andisthefuture #podcast with SIDDHARTH CHATTERJEE 常启德, whose story of #humanism and taking risks for the greater good, really touched my heart. I met Siddharth last September in Beijing, and I was truly inspired by him as a human being. In his role as the United Nations Resident Coordinator in China, he works tirelessly to improve the lives of children worldwide, ensure equality for women and girls, promote #health and well-being and drive progress on all the Sustainable Development Goals (#SDGs). One of his greatest professional achievements was the demobilization of more than 3,500 children from the conflicts in South Sudan. We had a great discussion about our progress on the SDGs and as he rightly said, “the world needs to unite” to achieve them “and this is where the role of the private sector becomes absolutely mission critical.” By the way, he’s not only interested in improving the health of others; he’s also a health and wellness enthusiast, and even shares some of his tips, which I’m definitely going to implement! Siddharth is one of those modern leaders who combines the perfect balance of mental and physical health - and he brings so many #leadership lessons. It's rare to find that in one person. This conversation made my day and I hope you enjoy it, too! Listen on Apple: https://spoti.fi/3YdDiZZ Spotify: https://apple.co/4d6UaG5 Or Syensqo’s website: https://bit.ly/3Y93S6o #Syensqo #WeAreExplorers #AdvancingHumanity #Healthcare\n\nAuguste Piccard, one of the great minds who attended the famous 1927 Ernest Solvay conference, once said: “Exploration is the sport of the scientist''. Like athletes, at Syensqo we are exploring cutting edge innovations with determination, passion and a winning mindset. Take the LOF - Laboratory Of the Future in Bordeaux, France, for example, which just celebrated its 20th anniversary! The lab is known for its advanced research in applying physical chemistry to formulations and materials, bringing new technologies to market in a wide range of sectors, including #agriculture, #automotive, #aeronautics, #construction, #healthcare, #electronics and the #environment. If exploration were a sport, winning would require strong collaboration between different teams and we are delighted to partner with CNRS - Centre national de la recherche scientifique, Université de Bordeaux, Région Nouvelle-Aquitaine, and local authorities to support the next generation of promising scientists. On that note, the LOF is also contributing to our Climate Impulse partnership by creating the next generation materials for the first non-stop flight around the world in a #greenhydrogen-powered airplane… with Bertrand Piccard, the grandson of Auguste Piccard! So as you can see, exploration is a sport we are in to WIN! As explorers and as athletes, we keep strengthening the muscles and teaming up with other brilliant innovators and scientific minds. #Syensqo #WeAreExplorers #AdvancingHumanity #innovation #talent #STEM #BeTheImpulse\n\nI am proud to launch the Syensqo Fund, a project very close to my heart. In partnership with the King Baudouin Foundation, the fund will support philanthropic initiatives that improve conditions for people AND the planet. It will provide funding for #innovation and #STEM education projects, community initiatives in areas where Syensqo operates, and importantly, Syensqo employees who are experiencing hardship. It will also support some of our flagship projects such as the Ernest Solvay Prize, as well as the Sustainable Guar Initiative, which significantly improves the lives of guar farmers in Rajasthan, India. And it will focus on four main pillars: Protecting the Planet, Nurturing Innovation, Fostering Education and Supporting Solidarity. This is an important part of our commitment to #advancinghumanity and addressing the world’s challenges, which goes back to our humanist founder Ernest Solvay who had a pioneering approach to social progress. We want to perpetuate our legacy of meaningful impact, driving progress and inspiring hope! #WeAreExplorers #Syensqo\n\n我们是探索者 – #WeAreExplorers – perfectly describes the Syensqo's teams I met in Shanghai and Zhenjiang, China. I was impressed with their energy and commitment to #innovation, #safety and #sustainability! China is set to reach 5 % GDP growth thanks to green industry and #artificialintelligence, as World Economic Forum’s #SummerDavos highlighted recently. With our team of 1,800 explorers, and our strong market presence and innovation capabilities across our six manufacturing sites and our Research & Innovation center in China, we’re accelerating our investments in growth and sustainable innovation. Our state-of-the-art application development lab in Shanghai, for example, leverages #AI and #robotics to meet the growing customer demand for high-performance, sustainable material solutions in #greenhydrogen, #electronics, and #semiconductors for #batteries and #cleanmobility. Our Zhenjiang site is exploring cleaner solutions for the coating industry with the opening of the Sipomer® PAM production line expansion, which I had the great honor to inaugurate. AND all of Syensqo’s sites in the country operate on 100% renewable electricity. In fact, our biomass boiler at our Zhangjiagang site has cut carbon emissions by half since 2018. We're advancing further by identifying new projects, establishing 2030 plant-level roadmaps, and targeting #carbonneutrality by 2040, all aligned with China’s significant strides towards a more sustainable future. I discussed this during my meeting with Jiangsu province Governor Xu Kunlin. I deeply thanked him –谢谢 – for the ongoing support in fostering fruitful relationships to further grow Syensqo’s business in China and for reinforcing our shared sustainability goals. The Jiangsu province, where four of our Chinese manufacturing sites are located, plays an important role for Syensqo China. The Governor and his team promised their support in various areas including the green energy supply (green steam and photovoltaic facilities), as well as collaboration with the local private-public regional ecosystem. With the right supportive ecosystem, including top-notch #STEM universities, the best talent pool, innovative startups, and an entrepreneurial spirit, I am confident that Syensqo is ready to seize strategic growth in China and beyond. Together, we will advance humanity. #Syensqo #WeAreExplorers #AdvancingHumanity Pu Chen\n\nI am pleased to announce the bolt-on #acquisition of AZERYS SA 🇲🇦, a specialist in rosemary extraction for food preservation. With assets in beautiful El Jadida, Morocco, Azerys stood out for 100% natural #plantbased, non GMO preservatives innovation to replace chemical additives. It aligns with consumer demand for more #ecofriendly ingredients, a fast-growing segment in the #bioeconomy. Additionally, Azerys relies on a state-of the-art facility and a strong network of local cooperatives supporting #responsibleagriculture - and this is in line with Syensqo’s Sustainable Guar Initiative in Rajasthan, India, where we’re promoting more eco-friendly agricultural practices to improve yields and revenues for guar farmers. For us, it’s about making businesses both sustainable AND profitable. The acquisition of Azerys is yet another significant milestone for #Syensqo which broadens our portfolio in renewable consumer solutions and complements our expertise in #biotechnology applied to the food market. Did you know that Syensqo is already the world's leading supplier of natural vanillin derived, through fermentation, from rice bran? And certainly, we won’t stop there! We are ready to explore the power of green extraction technologies further and scale up innovation capabilities of Syensqo’s Renewable Materials and Biotechnology Growth Platform. Congratulations to the team for successfully completing this M&A, which once again highlights our commitment to deliver sustainable, natural solutions to advance humanity. #WeAreExploreres #AdvancingHumanity #innovation #news Thomas Canova Michael Radossich https://lnkd.in/ernn637a"
