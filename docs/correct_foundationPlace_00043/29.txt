The Battleship Texas Foundation seeks to preserve, enhance, and develop the last of the historic Dreadnought battleships into a premier museum and visitor attraction in Galveston. With integrated Blackbaud software solutions, the foundation is able to manage ticketing and memberships through a system purpose-built for nonprofits, while effectively identifying supporters who can help make an ambitious restoration project a reality.
