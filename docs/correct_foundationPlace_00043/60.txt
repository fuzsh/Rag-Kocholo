With a variety of industries reinforcing their digital presence, Texas has emerged as a tech superpower, sitting at the #1 position among the fifty best destinations to kickstart a business in the United States.

The state is home to age-long organizations – Dell, AT&T, IBM, Texas Instruments, Rackspace Inc. – who have laid the foundation of its tech ecosystem. What makes Texas the sweet spot for entrepreneurs and engineering talent is its active community of 120,126 professionals. While the presence of the University of Texas makes it easy for startups and enterprises to engage fresh graduates, tech wizards and millennials get to explore opportunities at high-profile companies. What’s more, the colorful social scene and economical cost of living in Texas make for a perfect “work hard, play hard” lifestyle.

Simform is a custom software development company. We are excited to work with tech companies in Texas as their dedicated technology partner. With us, you get an exclusive team of software developers in Texas who have worked with B2B and B2C enterprises to build technologically advanced solutions to streamline their internal processes.

DevOps culture

We follow the DevOps culture to turn ‘IT War Rooms’ into a collaborative development environment and delegate shared responsibilities to the deployment and operations teams from the start. This allows us to handle large-scale, long-term projects that involve software upgradations at different stages of their growth.

The collaboration between dev team and quality experts has resulted in an early detection and resolution of bugs. Thus Simform successfully delivers your software at a higher quality – tailored to maintain confidentiality, productivity, and scalability.

Best-of-class quality assurance

Our QA experts set quality standards right from the start of the project, for we believe in a process that values quality as it does productivity.

Our Software Quality Assurance Management Plan (SQAMP) – with briefs of each sprint in the project lifecycle – makes development checkpoints full-proof. Our QAs follow an exhaustive two-tier-automation testing method to run regressive checks at night, giving us more time for trials of your software. This, in turn, allows our development team to promptly deliver a validated codebase, ensuring your software be delivered within the stipulated timeline.
