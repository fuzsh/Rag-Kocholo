        "text": "Are donations to Texas One Fund tax-deductible? The Texas One Fund has been granted tax-exempt status as an organization under the Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3) and continues to operate under its IRS approval. However, we encourage donors to consult a tax professional regarding the tax deductibility of donations to Texas One Fund. IRS approval is linked below. Please note that Texas One Fund is the successor entity of Horns with Heart, Inc. in conjunction with the merger of other nonprofits. Any nonprofit contributions may also be made to Horns with Heart, Inc. which can be received and credited to Texas One Fund, Inc.\n\nHow will my contribution be used? Donations are used to compensate student-athletes for their work with nonprofit partners. Contributions will also be used to support Texas One Fund operations and administration. Our operating costs are kept to a minimum, and include things like compliance and donor software, marketing, events, content creation, legal, accounting, programming, and more.\n\nDoes Texas One Fund control the things student-athletes spend their money on? Texas One Fund does not direct the personal spending of any student athlete. Texas One Fund encourages financial prudence for all student-athletes and many choose to spend their resources to help cost-of-living expenses and more in the Austin area.\n\nCan I pause, cancel, or change my contribution? Yes, donations can be managed via donor’s online account and paused or amended at any time. Donors can also email donations@texasonefund.org and we will be happy to assist with the process.\n\nHow do I access my donor profile? Yes, donations can be managed via donor’s online account and paused or amended at any time. Donors can also email info@texasonefund.org and we will be happy to assist with the process.\n\nWhere can I access receipts for my contributions? You can access your contribution details, including transaction history and receipts, by visiting your donor profile page (linked above). If you are still having trouble accessing your donor profile page, please contact donations@texasonefund.org.\n\nWhat kinds of NIL-related support can student-athletes provide for my nonprofit? Student-athletes utilize their NIL to promote our community nonprofit partners. In addition the student athlete can gain better understanding of the non-profit by volunteering their time. Some organizations request nonprofit client interaction such as reading to kids during a story hour or stocking the shelves at a food pantry. Other nonprofit partners request student athletes attend their fundraising events to raise awareness and garner attention to their mission. Each nonprofit partnership and area of support is determined on a case-by-case basis.\n\nCan I work with an individual athlete? Donors are not allowed to designate their donation to a specific student-athlete. Texas One Fund is solely responsible for determining which student-athletes are offered different opportunities to use their NIL with one of our community nonprofits. If you desire to work with a student athlete directly, you would need to contact that athlete directly. University of Texas has partnered with Opendorse to provide access through its Leverage Program. The Official Texas Longhorns Marketplace for NIL Deals - Opendorse.\n\nHow do I donate through Donor Advised Fund? Please recommend a grant to Horns with Heart through your DAF. If you need additional support, please email donations@texasonefund.org.responsible for determining which student-athletes are offered different opportunities to use their NIL with one of our community non-profits.
