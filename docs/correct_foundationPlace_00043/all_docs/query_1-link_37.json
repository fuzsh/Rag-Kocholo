        "text": "Since 1974, the Texas Department of Public Safety Officers Association (DPSOA) has been working to advocate on behalf of Troopers, Agents, Rangers, Officers, Communications Personnel and Forensic Scientists of the Texas Department of Public Safety. DPSOA is the largest organization representing commissioned law enforcement officers in Texas and includes more than 5000 men and women who daily pledge their lives to protect Texans across the state.\n\nIn addition to providing financial support for these important programs, joining the Foundation as a Corporate Partner ensures your company will receive widespread exposure as an important investor in our stateâs public safety community. There are several corporate funding levels and associated benefits and we welcome the chance to talk to you more about this opportunity. We appreciate your consideration of this important mission.\n\nCorporate Partner benefits include exposure on the website and in direct mail & e-mail communications, inclusion in press releases, meet & greets with a variety of relevant community stakeholders & more.\n\nNote: On February 5, 2012 the Austin American-Statesman published an article about telemarking abuse. As our press release stated, Neither DPSOA nor DPSTF conduct residential telemarketing and we are committed to being transparent and in full compliance with the law in all of of fundraising efforts. We applaud the Texas AGâs office for his actions against organizations that aim to diminish confidence in public safety officials."
