        "text": "The University of Colorado Boulder and Oregon State University have entered the planning stage for a new industry-focused Pervasive Personalized Intelligence center. The center would allow for interdisciplinary and collaborative research on machine-learning based software systems and aid in long-term partnerships between startups, corporations, universities and government agencies. Industry members involved leverage affiliate investment, have direct access to students, and enjoy company savings thanks to low risk and accelerated research and development.\n\nIf created, center headquarters would be at Oregon State with a site at CU supporting research under the supervision of the U.S. National Science Foundation using the Industry-University Cooperative Research Centers model.\n\nInterested industry partners and researchers are invited to join the group for a planning workshop in Portland on Oct. 11-12. For more information, visit www.ppicenter.org.\n\nTopics of focus in the center\n\nMachine Learning and Artificial Intelligence\n\nSecurity and Privacy\n\nEdge and Cloud Computing\n\nProgramming Languages and Verification\n\nSoftware Engineering and Human Computer Interaction\n\nCenter staff\n\nTwenty-nine faculty members across the focus areas, including ACM fellows Tom Dietterich and Margaret Burnett."
