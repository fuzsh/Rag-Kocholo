        "text": "This paper summarizes the discussions related to the panel “Contributions of GIScientists (or GIScience) over the past Twenty Years” at the 2015 Vespucci Institute. Reflections about the past not only provide an account of what occurred, but also may serve as a basis for comparison when in the future somehow related scenarios arise. Such histories may be detailed enumerations of chronological events or, more analytically, analyses of interactions that enabled or caused specific developments. The purpose of this paper is to account for some key developments in the academic field of geographic information science over the past twenty years (i.e., since 1995) and to assess some of the impact of these developments. The panel in Bar Harbor, moderated by David Coleman, included two invited presentations (by Max Egenhofer and Keith Clarke), and responses by two early career panelists (Song Gao and Teriitutea Quesnot), and by two senior panelists (Randolph Franklin and May Yuan).\n\nThis special issue is special not just because of the emerging theme of data-intensive geospatial computing, and but also in the sense that all the data and source codes used in the papers are made freely available. In the initial call for papers (http://fromto. hig. se/~ bjg/ijgis/), authors were encouraged to consider the option of support materials for archiving data and video clips. With the endorsement of the editor in chief, Dr. Brian Lees, a short note was inserted in the decision letter following the first round of review comments.\n\nHigher education has been charged with the development of professionals to serve the rapidly developing spatial technology industry, but is just beginning to arrive at a consensus concerning the types of courses, sequence of courses and specialty areas. Geographic Information Science and Technology Body of Knowledge (DiBiase et al., 2006) developed under the auspices of the University Consortium for Geographic Information Science (UCGIS) represents a major step in Geographic Information Science (GIScience) education which may lead to more consistency among programs in Geographic Information Science (GIScience.) Concurrently, there are movements for the accreditation of GIScience programs and formal GIS certificates. However, there is a significant gap from these promising but incipient efforts to the coherent development of GIScience programs at the university, college or technical school level. What should be the direction for those who are developing GIScience programs in institutions of higher education in the absence of more definitive direction? In this confusing transitory environment, the authors in this paper propose an outline or “road map” for the development of an interdisciplinary GIScience program.
