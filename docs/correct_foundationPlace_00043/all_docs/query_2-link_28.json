Engineers will be able to produce applications that provide real-time intelligence, situational awareness, and coordination at the edge not found today.\n\na distributed knowledge network (DKN) and Intelligent Sensor Network (ISN) offers new capabilities for more intelligent, more interoperable and more distributed processes for information gathering, data filter/analysis, information dissemination, and collaboration that ultimately results in faster and more efficient decision making in mobile, widely distributed, heterogeneous environments. These environments span many device types and wired and wireless networks.\n\nDKNs/ISNs may be developed on the proposed software platform, described below, that allows for decentralized, intelligent, mobile, high-performance, transaction-based applications.\n\nthe proposed pervasive platform will seamlessly interoperate with the hardware and software technologies of today to pave the way for next-generation solutions for commercial, government, and consumer development.\n\nthe resulting applications will provide quantum leaps in real-time intelligence capabilities and coordination among widely distributed groups, as well as offer greatly increased productivity and cost savings.\n\ndata may be gathered on edge devices, rapidly turned into actionable knowledge, and distributed efficiently to ad hoc, possibly dynamically assembled groups of interested participants, devices, and enterprise systems.\n\nMobile software components residing on these edge devices may continuously learn from the data they get and interpret. This can cause them to respond differently and possibly assemble and communicate with an ever-changing audience, forming a distributed knowledge-sharing network.\n\nSoftware agent-based technologies allow for complex or large software processes to be broken down into smaller components that can be mobilized and reused to enable dynamic decision distribution and integration capabilities via an intelligent software abstraction layer.\n\nData can be analyzed at the source or point of input to the network and prioritized and distributed in an automated process to appropriate consumers of the information on the network.\n\nthe information consumers can potentially be sensors, smartphones, PDAs, MIDs, UMPCs, Laptops, and an extremely wide array of wireless and embedded devices and systems.\n\nthe agent-based distributed knowledge network (DKN) and Intelligent Sensor Network (ISN) will provide the key enabling technologies for translating recent advances in automated data acquisition, digital storage, computers and communications into fundamental advances supporting data Filter/Analysis, dynamic process management, dynamic integration and collaboration for advanced enterprise, consumer, and government applications.\n\nIntelligent mobile agent technology utilizing dynamically loadable and mobile rule-sets, provides the intelligence behind the framework in the design and implementation of a DKN/ISN.\n\nAgent-based peer-2-peer peer-2-group and peer-2-enterprise system architecture provides the framework for varied, no-single-point-of failure, interconnection of computer ânodesâ.\n\nagent-based rule-sets to encapsulate logical processes or algorithms, programmable rules or processes can then be delivered to processing nodes that range from large computer servers to mobile phones and wireless sensors.\n\na true pervasive software platform that forms the foundation of a Distributed Knowledge Network will have extensive support for all devices, their operating systems and platforms, networks, distributed protocols, supported software languages and messaging capabilities.\n\ndevices and underlying operating systems it is meant those that power everything from servers to mobile and embedded devices.\n\nsoftware languages it is meant that the pervasive platform will support prominent languages such as Java, .NET, C++ and other appropriate language as well as scripting languages such as JavaScript, ActionScript, PHP and Ruby.\n\ndistributed protocols it is meant that the pervasive software platform can host Distributed Knowledge Networks via, e.g. Binary XML, SOAP, XML-RPC, IIOP and RMI.\n\ndevice-to-device a.k.a peer-2-peer\n\ndevice-to-device-group a.k.a peer-2-group\n\ndevice-2-enterprise peer-2-enterprise\n\nthis messaging will be via common and prominent standardized messaging protocols, be it IPv4/IPv6 based (TCP/IP, UDP, JMS, MSMQ, DDS) or not (Bluetooth, Zigbee, Near Field Communication).\n\nthe Distributed Knowledge Network may be built using an intelligent agent platform that runs devices ranging from servers, to laptops, PDAs, smartphones, Mobile Internet Devices, UItra Mobile PCs, and sensors.\n\nthe DKN System provides:\n\na true pervasive, peer-to-peer application will be able to run, in some form, on all devices ranging from smartphones, routers, MIDs, UMPCs, Netbooks, VoIP phones, sensors, and those found in, or coming soon, to automobiles and remote controlled machines, to name a few. To do so, its software platform will run natively on these same devices.\n\nSoftware agents comprising these applications also need to be able to run in the popular mobile/embedded software stacks, such as Java's Micro Edition, Android, Microsoft's Compact Framework, and OSGI Containers, on a wide range of mobile/embedded operating systems such as iPhone, Blackberry, Windows Mobile, Symbian, BREW, and Embedded Linux versions (Android, LIMO, Maemo, etc.) to name just a few. All of which will facilitate these pervasive services to function within smartphones, routers, MIDs, UMPCs, VoIP Phones, Telepresence, sensors, automobiles, bus stops, smart meters, and other ICT connected participatory nodes.\n\nmobile/embedded software stacks such as Java's Micro Edition, Android, Microsoft's Compact Framework, and OSGI Containers\n\nmobile/embedded operating systems such as iPhone, Blackberry, Windows Mobile, Symbian, BREW, and Embedded Linux versions (Android, LIMO, Maemo, etc.) to name just a few\n\nFIG. 1 Depicted in FIG. 1 is the proposed software architecture 10 for the nodes that comprise a Distributed Knowledge Network (DKN). It is described in detail in the sections below.\n\nDKN Distributed Knowledge Network\n\nthe architecture 10 includes a device API Abstraction layer 11 that provides an abstraction of at least the most common and prominent engines for each relevant capability.\n\nSpecific APIs include a messaging API 12 , security API 13 , discovery API 14 (e.g. white pages and yellow pages), transaction API 15 , universal user interface API 16 , ontology API 17 , database API 18 , rules API 19 and PIM API 111 .\n\nthe API Abstraction layer operates between a network layer 112 , representing the most common type of wired and wireless networks (a.k.a. Networks), and an operating platform layer 113 which represents the most common Operating Systems and software platforms (Operating Systems/Platforms).\n\nthe proposed pervasive platform 10 will enable communication and sharing of application data, between groups of devices/systems without the need of a centralized messaging server. It will support the creation of ad-hoc communities of devices or nodes, as well as the ability to support filtering of application messages across these communities. Support will exist for devices joining and leaving the network, which will result in changing âinternetâ addresses. Integration with a SIP/IMS Server is one way to provide dynamic IP support along with voice, data, and chat support over IP. The platform will also support passing messages over standard centralized messaging servers for integration with enterprise and legacy systems. More specifically, there needs to be seamless integration with Microsoft's Message Queue (MSMQ), Java's Message Server (JMS) and Object Management Group's (OMG) Data Description Service (DDS), etc.\n\nMSMQ Microsoft's Message Queue\n\nJMS Java's Message Server\n\nOMG Object Management Group's\n\nDDS Data Description Service\n\nthe messaging capability may be achieved by a Pervasive Software Platform Universal Peer-2-Peer Messaging Sub-Module 12 which is described in further detail below.\n\nthe proposed pervasive platform 10 will enable filtering and analyzing of data processing at the source to minimize network traffic, handle unreliable and/or limited network connections, and adjust to hardware failures or CPU load. Therefore, these devices will be able to persist data via a micro relational or objects database. Additionally, the software components or agents running on edge devices need to support multiple wireless protocols (GSM, CDMA, Wi-Fi, UWB, Bluetooth, NFC, RFID, 4G/WiMax/LTE, etc.) and associated networks (Telco, Wide Area, Local, Personal, etc.). Ideally, they will dynamically reconfigure themselves to use a communication protocol that best matches the capabilities of their current network connection and the current node(s) they are in communication with. These capabilities may be provided by Universal Core Request Brokering Sub-Modules such as a Universal Transport Interface, universal Serialization interface and Universal Distributed Protocol/Remote Interface, each of which will be described in more detail below.\n\nUniversal Core Request Brokering Sub-Modules such as a Universal Transport Interface, universal Serialization\n\nthe proposed pervasive platform will also provide an enhanced Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) that supports services running on mobile and embedded devices.\n\nSOA Service-Oriented Architecture\n\nany device will be able to host and access services.\n\nThese services will be accessible in a decentralized fashion directly to agents, exposed as services, that are running on edge and wireless devices.\n\nthe distributed agents will act more as providers of services and facilitators of exchanges and transactions versus a traditional client/server central provisioning approach.\n\nthe location of intelligent agents/services and the Mobile Web Services they expose will be irrelevant to the client or target device.\n\nall agents/services need to be accessible by a Service Description in adaptive directories, ideally ones with Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI) compliance.\n\nUDDI Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration\n\nThese services will be discoverable over SIP/IMS registries as well, along with network based discovery techniques for advanced abilities to compose and provision services across the layers.\n\nThese capabilities may be provided by a Universal White Pages and Yellow Pages sub-modules 14 , an Intelligent Agent software platform and a Universal Agent sub-module FIG. 13 .\n\nthe security concerns facing enterprises today will need to incorporate solutions that extend to a collaborative environment.\n\nthe proposed pervasive software platform will provide a high level of security to ensure privacy and protection from rogue/viral clients and software agents. This will involve security agents and agent managers that provide capabilities above and beyond the current encryption, authentication, and authorization that are currently employed in today's centralized client server applications.\n\nthe security capability 13 needs to be configurable and pluggable, to allow for adaptable and custom security features specific to the date and/or services being hosted on any particular node. For example, encryption, authentication, and authorization around peer-to-peer and peer-to-group application/event exchanges will all have pluggable security capabilities that tap into the various security services from networks, to clouds, to applications, and so forth.\n\nAdvanced pervasive applications cannot be limited to a single development environment and programming language. Furthermore, the same API will be provided to .NET, Java, C/C++ and JavaScript developers. The platform will support a common set of collections and algorithms across these languages as well. This would greatly increase programmer productivity and allow developers from all camps to easily work together and share software. The platform will seamlessly integrate with .NET, JEE and legacy (MVS, CORBA, etc.) enterprise systems and services, and any combination thereof, in either a traditional Web Services architecture, or in a high performance manner using binary protocols. Pervasive applications may need to communicate with more than one enterprise/organization or governmental entity.\n\nSAAS Software-As-A-Service\n\nIAAS Infrastructure-As-A-Service\n\nthe platform needs to extend from the fore-mentioned enterprise, desktop and mobile/embedded environments down to the very nodes, sensors, and devices. This paves the way of providing Distributed Knowledge Networks (DKN) that extend to and integrates with Intelligent Sensor Networks (ISN).\n\nDKN Distributed Knowledge Networks\n\nISN Intelligent Sensor Networks\n\nthe ISN will provide sensor instrumentation architecture with rules-based software agents that will provide self-monitoring, self-healing, non-intrusive data transfer methods.\n\nthe architecture will also describe data routing, multi level security and delivery rules for node collaboration on networks.\n\nThese robust ISNs will have the capability to reconfigure; self-heal/organize, and adjust to changing data needs and network node availability dynamically as an event evolves. They will do so by leveraging peer-to-peer and peer-to-group communication with like sensors nodes as well as more robust mobile and embedded devices. Logic to filter and analyze data, and distribution of more refined information the data, will occur where/whenever sufficient processing power and energy sources allow.\n\nthe proposed pervasive platform will provide location and PIM services that allows determination of any node's location from any other node, as well as sharing of such information as contacts, calendaring, tasks and files (audio, video, photo, etc.). These services will form the building blocks of many ad-hoc, community-based applications.\n\nThese APIs will be compliant with standards, such as BONDI, and be consistent across all platforms, languages and devices, and will be accessible by both peer-to-peer based messaging, peer-to-group messaging across dynamic communities and of course peer-to-enterprise/cloud for integration with enterprise systems, SAAS and IIAS clouds. In one embodiment, these capabilities may be provided by a Universal Location and PIM Sub-Module 29 .\n\nthe proposed pervasive platform will also provide a Universal UI API 16 , to compliment its Universal API's for discovering, accessing and hosting services and data across all devices.\n\ntechnology has been described in the Applicant's co-pending patent application Attorney Docket No. 20091117.1, referenced above, to make this feasible in a standards-compliant, truly ubiquitous manner.\n\nWebKit (based on HTML 5 and JavaScript 1.5) is becoming very prevalent on desktops and mobile devices.\n\nAndroid/Chrome, Apple/iPhone/Safari, Symbian/QT all have WebKit support within their corresponding platform's SDK via their own APIs and RIM have a similar platform under development.\n\nthe proposed pervasive platform will extend transactions from the enterprise to edge devices, allowing for distributed, but coordinated tasks and information sharing and collaborative communications among peers, peer groups, enterprise, cloud, and federated clouds.\n\nSupport will be provided to allow for intelligent agents/services running on the edge to participate in guaranteed service, message, and communication delivery either via an enterprise pub-sub JMS/MSMQ-like capability described above, or with XA-compliant enterprise transaction managers such as those provided in .NET's Microsoft Transaction Service (MTS), Java's Transaction Service (JTS), and OMG's Object Transaction Service (OTS).\n\nMTS Microsoft Transaction Service\n\nJTS Java's Transaction Service\n\nThis advanced platform will provide a simple way to access databases, regardless of the type of databaseâwhether it is a relational, object, XML or a multi-user enterprise database or single-user embedded. Developers need to be shielded from the intricacies that exist with these various flavors and have support for data synchronization between a mobile/embedded device, the communities of devices it belongs to, and enterprise systems such as Software and Infrastructure-As-A-Service (SAAS, IAAS) Clouds.\n\nSAAS Software and Infrastructure-As-A-Service\n\na next-generation application will need to utilize intelligent software agents/services that can gather data, respond quickly based on this data as it changes, produce and distribute knowledge, and even initiate other agent/service activities on another device or group thereof.\n\nthe underlying rules engine will be easy to use, provide very high performance against potentially large rule sets, and will be available in multiple languages. These agents will also be able to understand different ontologies as a powerful abstraction to the modeling of knowledge about different domains. This is accomplished by utilizing the Agents 110 , Rules 19 and Ontology 17 API modules depicted in FIG. 1 .\n\nthe proposed pervasive platform with the capabilities described has the ability to filter and analyze data on any node and distribute resulting universal business/data to any other node, or interested groups of nodes regardless of their location and software platform.\n\nthe data will often originate from a wide range of sources often from sensory/mobile/embedded devices.\n\nthe filtering, analyzing and distribution of information/events will first occur as close to the sensory/mobile/embedded device as possible (ideally on it). Such is the basis of the aforementioned ISN.\n\nthe proposed pervasive platform will support dynamic groups that represent connected and/or hierarchical analysis/decision support/collaboration groups.\n\nEach level of groups analyzes micro events in determining relevant, increasingly coarsely grained, macro events leading to additional data/event filtering, analyzing, collaboration, response and also for determining the routing of that information to enterprise systems/clouds (governments, corporations, research institutions, trading floors, health organizations, etc.).\n\nagent-based architecture provides a solid solution capable of being deployed on any industry computing domains (including those with multi-level security and need-to-know domains).\n\nindustry computing domains including those with multi-level security and need-to-know domains.\n\nTypical uses for agent-based computing techniques are:\n\nthis platform requires the ability to distribute the analytical or task-based software objects to the point of origin.\n\nthe software can perform initial sort and data Filter/Analysis required to refine the data set.\n\nthe refining of the data before transmission results in lower network bandwidth utilization and more effective routing to the appropriate systems and/or users for action.\n\nthe data and service delivery platform will require the capability to distribute software updates dynamically (at different security levels) without disrupting the system.\n\nTo efficiently distribute large volumes of data across a distributed network requires the capability to propagate messages across a connection of node âcommunitiesâ or âspacesâ that will increase speed and performance proportional to the number of nodesâin a sense creating a network of networks that scales dynamically.\n\na Distributed Knowledge Network including Intelligent Software Agents (ISAs) is a technical architecture and distributed Filter/Analysis capability that will provide some of the key enabling technologies for translating recent advances in automated data acquisition, digital storage, computers and communications into fundamental advances supporting data Filter/Analysis, collaborative reviews and related applications\n\nAn ISA is a named object which contains software code, a persistent state, data and a set of attributes (requirements, history, authentication keys, etc.) and can move from one device or system as needed for accomplishing its tasks.\n\nMobile agents provide an efficient framework for performing distributed computation at locations where the relevant data is available instead of expensive shipping of large volumes of data across the network.\n\nMost software agent designs consist of at least three components: agent servers, agent interfaces, and agent brokers (service directory). Agent servers support basic agent migration mechanisms, authentication, and sometimes provide other services. Agent brokers provide addresses of agent servers and support mechanisms for uniquely naming agents and agent servers.\n\nthe agent interface is used by application programs to create and interact with agents.\n\nISA architecture is a valuable strategy due to the ability to:\n\nthe agent performs its task and saves any results until its connection to the user is re-established.\n\nMobile agents provide a reliable transport between a client and server without necessitating a reliable underlying communications medium.\n\nAgents are software that assists with tasks and acts on behalf of the initiator. Agents are typically: goal-driven, reactive, social, adaptive and mobile. Agents have one or more of these characteristics:\n\nIntelligent software agents can reside on any heterogeneous device or node such as sensors, readers, cameras, PDA's, smart phones, desktops, laptops, tablets, servers and mainframes. Additionally they can execute effectively within any software architecture from thick and thin client-server applications to widely decentralized applications or DKNs. More specifically, at any point in time a node will be acting as a client or server. Briefly multi-level, role-based security is often accomplished as follows:\n\nDKN The innovative capabilities of a DKN will enhance advances in scientific research and military operational test and training applications (e.g., intelligence data handling, situation assessment, command and control, network centric warfare). DKNs will significantly reduce the total ownership costs of new weapon systems while enhancing force readiness in a non-intrusive manner. There is also opportunity in many other areas for enhancement and improvement of information retrieval, knowledge discovery, and distributed Filter/Analysis for problem solving and decision-making.\n\nthe proposed technology and design can improve crisis management and communications infrastructure, which offer numerous scenarios that require reactive as well as proactive decision-making, often under tight time, resource, and performance constraints to accomplish the desired objectives.\n\na software platform with the described pervasive features and inherit Distributed Knowledge Network and Intelligent Sensor network capabilities brings revolutionary capabilities and ease of use to today's application architects. It gives them maximum flexibility to develop dynamic, intelligent, and decentralized applications in .NET, Java and C++ on the devices and servers they need to target. Additionally, the extensive protocol supportâin combination with its multi-language support and SOAâallows the intelligent mobile agents in these applications to access systems written in any language. They can also be accessed by systems written in any language in a variety of ways and messaging techniques, be they centralized or decentralized. By leveraging the AI rules integration and the pervasive mobile agents residing on any and all targeted devices and servers, organizations could create applications that provide real-time intelligence, coordination, and capabilities not found today.\n\nThis platform would provide the capability to create a new set of applications that are distributed knowledge and problem-solving networks with dynamic and ad hoc participants using different devices and enterprise software systems. It's not hard to see where this could be of great benefit in the domains of disaster recovery, terrorist response, and homeland security to name only a select few applicable areas in the government.\n\nthe energy, transportation, insurance, education, telecom, healthcare, and finance industries are obvious verticals that could create vast new opportunities with such a platform.

These types of application range from the DoD, DHS, and Commercial and Consumer worlds. The need for a software platform that enables a Distributed Knowledge Network is now very evident.\n\nBut there is currently no Distributed Knowledge Network platform to enable intelligent applications that span these heterogeneous networks and devices, underlying operating systems, software languages, and software protocols.

These applications can be broadly categorized as Distributed Knowledge Networks and Intelligent Sensor Networks.\n\nNormally a developer would have to go through the arduous task of integrating ânâ software products and platforms to create such a platform, where ânâ is a very significant number and is growing constantly. Currently, there is no single platform that through a set of Universal API's, brings them together in a platform that extends from the sensor to the cloud, and every major device type in-between.\n\nThis single pervasive platform enables plug-n-play technologies, be they geared for the enterprise, mobile or embedded space. An intelligent, distributed computing platform that can provide these capabilities, will be the superhighway for software engineers to leverage in creating the next generation of applications.\n\nSoftware architects and engineers will have the flexibility to freely develop dynamic, intelligent, and decentralized applications in their language of choice, on the devices and servers they need to target, whether the device/node is a mainframe, desktop, PDA, Smartphone, RFID reader, camera, or embedded sensor.\n\nBy utilizing such a platform, developers will have at their disposal a choice of wireless networks, distributed protocols, and decentralized and centralized messaging capabilities to leverage in creating the ad-hoc and distributed social, knowledge, and problem-solving networks of tomorrow.\n\nUtilizing rules engines such as RETE-based rules engine integrated within this next generation platform, engineers can create artificial intelligence and cognitive capabilities into Mobile 2.0 software agents residing on all targeted devices and servers. Engineers will be able to produce applications that provide real-time intelligence, situational awareness, and coordination at the edge not found today.\n\nEnterprise software stacks, like software languages, continue to be born, but âoldâ ones never go away. J2EE and .NET architectures and related languages dominate, but CORBA and Mainframe systems and their associated languages, are still prevalent within many of these same organizations.\n\nA distributed knowledge network (DKN) and Intelligent Sensor Network (ISN) offers new capabilities for more intelligent, more interoperable and more distributed processes for information gathering, data filter/analysis, information dissemination, and collaboration that ultimately results in faster and more efficient decision making in mobile, widely distributed, heterogeneous environments. These environments span many device types and wired and wireless networks.\n\nThese DKNs/ISNs may be developed on the proposed software platform, described below, that allows for decentralized, intelligent, mobile, high-performance, transaction-based applications. The proposed pervasive platform will seamlessly interoperate with the hardware and software technologies of today to pave the way for next-generation solutions for commercial, government, and consumer development. The resulting applications will provide quantum leaps in real-time intelligence capabilities and coordination among widely distributed groups, as well as offer greatly increased productivity and cost savings. In this paradigm, data may be gathered on edge devices, rapidly turned into actionable knowledge, and distributed efficiently to ad hoc, possibly dynamically assembled groups of interested participants, devices, and enterprise systems.\n\nMobile software components (agents) residing on these edge devices may continuously learn from the data they get and interpret. This can cause them to respond differently and possibly assemble and communicate with an ever-changing audience, forming a distributed knowledge-sharing network.\n\nSoftware agent-based technologies allow for complex or large software processes to be broken down into smaller components that can be mobilized and reused to enable dynamic decision distribution and integration capabilities via an intelligent software abstraction layer. Data can be analyzed at the source or point of input to the network and prioritized and distributed in an automated process to appropriate consumers of the information on the network. The information consumers can potentially be sensors, smartphones, PDAs, MIDs, UMPCs, Laptops, and an extremely wide array of wireless and embedded devices and systems.\n\nThe agent-based distributed knowledge network (DKN) and Intelligent Sensor Network (ISN) will provide the key enabling technologies for translating recent advances in automated data acquisition, digital storage, computers and communications into fundamental advances supporting data Filter/Analysis, dynamic process management, dynamic integration and collaboration for advanced enterprise, consumer, and government applications.\n\nIntelligent mobile agent technology, utilizing dynamically loadable and mobile rule-sets, provides the intelligence behind the framework in the design and implementation of a DKN/ISN. Agent-based peer-2-peer peer-2-group and peer-2-enterprise system architecture provides the framework for varied, no-single-point-of failure, interconnection of computer ânodesâ. Using agent-based rule-sets to encapsulate logical processes or algorithms, programmable rules or processes can then be delivered to processing nodes that range from large computer servers to mobile phones and wireless sensors.\n\nIn order to implement these new applications, including a DKN/ISN, there is required a next-generation pervasive software platform that can operate seamlessly in the complex, widely distributed environment we find today. One aspect of such is software agent technology that will provide the mobility infrastructure for process mobility, code mobility, rule-set mobility and remote communications.\n\nA true pervasive software platform that forms the foundation of a Distributed Knowledge Network will have extensive support for all devices, their operating systems and platforms, networks, distributed protocols, supported software languages and messaging capabilities. By devices and underlying operating systems, it is meant those that power everything from servers to mobile and embedded devices. By software languages it is meant that the pervasive platform will support prominent languages such as Java, .NET, C++ and other appropriate language as well as scripting languages such as JavaScript, ActionScript, PHP and Ruby. By distributed protocols, it is meant that the pervasive software platform can host Distributed Knowledge Networks via, e.g. Binary XML, SOAP, XML-RPC, IIOP and RMI. And by messaging, it is meant device-to-device (a.k.a peer-2-peer), device-to-device-group (a.k.a peer-2-group) or device-2-enterprise (peer-2-enterprise). Additionally this messaging will be via common and prominent standardized messaging protocols, be it IPv4/IPv6 based (TCP/IP, UDP, JMS, MSMQ, DDS) or not (Bluetooth, Zigbee, Near Field Communication).\n\nThe Distributed Knowledge Network (DKN) may be built using an intelligent agent platform that runs devices ranging from servers, to laptops, PDAs, smartphones, Mobile Internet Devices, UItra Mobile PCs, and sensors. Specifically, the DKN System provides:\n\nAn Intelligent Software Agent platform that runs on the devices mentioned above, forming the foundation of an distributed knowledge network.\n\nA hardware-independent, Intelligent Agent Software abstraction layer for sensors.\n\nA network platform that contains meta-data about the systems, providing a self-describing capability that enables pluggable, non-intrusive communication with heterogeneous software and groups of heterogeneous nodes.\n\nAgents are responsible for integration and distribution of processing and knowledge between different systems.\n\nThe Agents for each of these systems would be a combination of the following types of Agents currently used, or planned for use within the DKN:\n\nData Gatherer Agents\n\nInterface Agents\n\nFilter/Analysis Agents\n\nDKN Controller Component Agents\n\nA true pervasive, peer-to-peer application will be able to run, in some form, on all devices ranging from smartphones, routers, MIDs, UMPCs, Netbooks, VoIP phones, sensors, and those found in, or coming soon, to automobiles and remote controlled machines, to name a few. To do so, its software platform will run natively on these same devices. Software agents comprising these applications, also need to be able to run in the popular mobile/embedded software stacks, such as Java's Micro Edition, Android, Microsoft's Compact Framework, and OSGI Containers, on a wide range of mobile/embedded operating systems such as iPhone, Blackberry, Windows Mobile, Symbian, BREW, and Embedded Linux versions (Android, LIMO, Maemo, etc.) to name just a few. All of which will facilitate these pervasive services to function within smartphones, routers, MIDs, UMPCs, VoIP Phones, Telepresence, sensors, automobiles, bus stops, smart meters, and other ICT connected participatory nodes.\n\nDepicted in FIG. 1 is the proposed software architecture 10 for the nodes that comprise a Distributed Knowledge Network (DKN). It is described in detail in the sections below.\n\nThe architecture 10 includes a device API Abstraction layer 11 that provides an abstraction of at least the most common and prominent engines for each relevant capability. Specific APIs include a messaging API 12, security API 13, discovery API 14 (e.g. white pages and yellow pages), transaction API 15, universal user interface API 16, ontology API 17, database API 18, rules API 19 and PIM API 111. The API Abstraction layer operates between a network layer 112, representing the most common type of wired and wireless networks (a.k.a. Networks), and an operating platform layer 113 which represents the most common Operating Systems and software platforms (Operating Systems/Platforms).\n\nA) Dynamic, Decentralized and Centralized Messaging Capability via Messaging API 12\n\nThe proposed pervasive platform 10 will enable communication and sharing of application data, between groups of devices/systems without the need of a centralized messaging server. It will support the creation of ad-hoc communities of devices or nodes, as well as the ability to support filtering of application messages across these communities. Support will exist for devices joining and leaving the network, which will result in changing âinternetâ addresses. Integration with a SIP/IMS Server is one way to provide dynamic IP support along with voice, data, and chat support over IP. The platform will also support passing messages over standard centralized messaging servers for integration with enterprise and legacy systems. More specifically, there needs to be seamless integration with Microsoft's Message Queue (MSMQ), Java's Message Server (JMS) and Object Management Group's (OMG) Data Description Service (DDS), etc.\n\nThe messaging capability may be achieved by a Pervasive Software Platform Universal Peer-2-Peer Messaging Sub-Module 12 which is described in further detail below.\n\nB) Network Scalability, Survivability and Discovery Capability via Discovery API 14\n\nThe proposed pervasive platform 10 will enable filtering and analyzing of data processing at the source to minimize network traffic, handle unreliable and/or limited network connections, and adjust to hardware failures or CPU load. Therefore, these devices will be able to persist data via a micro relational or objects database. Additionally, the software components or agents running on edge devices need to support multiple wireless protocols (GSM, CDMA, Wi-Fi, UWB, Bluetooth, NFC, RFID, 4G/WiMax/LTE, etc.) and associated networks (Telco, Wide Area, Local, Personal, etc.). Ideally, they will dynamically reconfigure themselves to use a communication protocol that best matches the capabilities of their current network connection and the current node(s) they are in communication with. These capabilities may be provided by Universal Core Request Brokering Sub-Modules such as a Universal Transport Interface, universal Serialization interface and Universal Distributed Protocol/Remote Interface, each of which will be described in more detail below.\n\nC) Mobile SOA Architecture Capability\n\nThe proposed pervasive platform will also provide an enhanced Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) that supports services running on mobile and embedded devices. In other words, any device will be able to host and access services. These services will be accessible in a decentralized fashion directly to agents, exposed as services, that are running on edge and wireless devices. The distributed agents will act more as providers of services and facilitators of exchanges and transactions versus a traditional client/server central provisioning approach. The location of intelligent agents/services and the Mobile Web Services they expose will be irrelevant to the client or target device. Finally, all agents/services need to be accessible by a Service Description in adaptive directories, ideally ones with Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI) compliance. Finally, these services will be discoverable over SIP/IMS registries as well, along with network based discovery techniques for advanced abilities to compose and provision services across the layers. These capabilities may be provided by a Universal White Pages and Yellow Pages sub-modules 14, an Intelligent Agent software platform and a Universal Agent sub-module FIG. 13.\n\nD) Configurable, Adaptable Security Framework via Security API 13\n\nIn a ubiquitously networked world, it will often be necessary to maintain data on edge devices. The security concerns facing enterprises today will need to incorporate solutions that extend to a collaborative environment. The proposed pervasive software platform will provide a high level of security to ensure privacy and protection from rogue/viral clients and software agents. This will involve security agents and agent managers that provide capabilities above and beyond the current encryption, authentication, and authorization that are currently employed in today's centralized client server applications.\n\nAs with every capability within the pervasive platform, the security capability 13 needs to be configurable and pluggable, to allow for adaptable and custom security features specific to the date and/or services being hosted on any particular node. For example, encryption, authentication, and authorization around peer-to-peer and peer-to-group application/event exchanges will all have pluggable security capabilities that tap into the various security services from networks, to clouds, to applications, and so forth.\n\nE) Universal Platform/Servicesâ.NET/Java/C++/JS from Clouds to Sensors\n\nAdvanced pervasive applications cannot be limited to a single development environment and programming language. Furthermore, the same API will be provided to .NET, Java, C/C++ and JavaScript developers. The platform will support a common set of collections and algorithms across these languages as well. This would greatly increase programmer productivity and allow developers from all camps to easily work together and share software. The platform will seamlessly integrate with .NET, JEE and legacy (MVS, CORBA, etc.) enterprise systems and services, and any combination thereof, in either a traditional Web Services architecture, or in a high performance manner using binary protocols. Pervasive applications may need to communicate with more than one enterprise/organization or governmental entity.\n\nWith the advent of Software-As-A-Service (SAAS) and Infrastructure-As-A-Service (IAAS) based cloud computing, there will be an evolving need for inter-cloud interoperability. This holds especially true since companies, organizations and governments are adopting cloud computing at every level. Protocol standards are being debated here, and likely will never be universally agreed upon. This all furthers leads to the need for pluggable protocol architecture since different nodes, systems, clouds and devices will need to communicate using different protocols, at different times, for different reasons.\n\nThe platform needs to extend from the fore-mentioned enterprise, desktop and mobile/embedded environments down to the very nodes, sensors, and devices. This paves the way of providing Distributed Knowledge Networks (DKN) that extend to and integrates with Intelligent Sensor Networks (ISN).\n\nThe ISN will provide sensor instrumentation architecture with rules-based software agents that will provide self-monitoring, self-healing, non-intrusive data transfer methods. The architecture will also describe data routing, multi level security and delivery rules for node collaboration on networks. These robust ISNs will have the capability to reconfigure; self-heal/organize, and adjust to changing data needs and network node availability dynamically as an event evolves. They will do so by leveraging peer-to-peer and peer-to-group communication with like sensors nodes as well as more robust mobile and embedded devices. Logic to filter and analyze data, and distribution of more refined information the data, will occur where/whenever sufficient processing power and energy sources allow.\n\nF) Location and PIM Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Group Services Module via PIM API 111\n\nTo enable location-aware, community-based, collaborative applications, the proposed pervasive platform will provide location and PIM services that allows determination of any node's location from any other node, as well as sharing of such information as contacts, calendaring, tasks and files (audio, video, photo, etc.). These services will form the building blocks of many ad-hoc, community-based applications. These APIs will be compliant with standards, such as BONDI, and be consistent across all platforms, languages and devices, and will be accessible by both peer-to-peer based messaging, peer-to-group messaging across dynamic communities and of course peer-to-enterprise/cloud for integration with enterprise systems, SAAS and IIAS clouds. In one embodiment, these capabilities may be provided by a Universal Location and PIM Sub-Module 29.\n\nG) Universal UI API Module 16\n\nThe proposed pervasive platform will also provide a Universal UI API 16, to compliment its Universal API's for discovering, accessing and hosting services and data across all devices. Considered nearly an impossible task, technology has been described in the Applicant's co-pending patent application Attorney Docket No. 20091117.1, referenced above, to make this feasible in a standards-compliant, truly ubiquitous manner. More specifically, WebKit (based on HTML 5 and JavaScript 1.5) is becoming very prevalent on desktops and mobile devices. Android/Chrome, Apple/iPhone/Safari, Symbian/QT all have WebKit support within their corresponding platform's SDK via their own APIs and RIM have a similar platform under development. So WebKit and Microsoft's Silverlight seem to be poised to be the two dominant âweb enginesâ across all devices. A Universal UI Interface that can communicate with WebKit and Silverlight, would allow developers to have their application process layer communicate with a JS/HTML presentation layer, all utilizing a single set of APIs.\n\nH) Transactional on Edge Devices and Ad-Hoc Communities Capability\n\nThe proposed pervasive platform will extend transactions from the enterprise to edge devices, allowing for distributed, but coordinated tasks and information sharing and collaborative communications among peers, peer groups, enterprise, cloud, and federated clouds. Support will be provided to allow for intelligent agents/services running on the edge to participate in guaranteed service, message, and communication delivery either via an enterprise pub-sub JMS/MSMQ-like capability described above, or with XA-compliant enterprise transaction managers such as those provided in .NET's Microsoft Transaction Service (MTS), Java's Transaction Service (JTS), and OMG's Object Transaction Service (OTS).\n\nI) Embedded and Enterprise Database Integration and Synchronization Module 18\n\nThis advanced platform will provide a simple way to access databases, regardless of the type of databaseâwhether it is a relational, object, XML or a multi-user enterprise database or single-user embedded. Developers need to be shielded from the intricacies that exist with these various flavors and have support for data synchronization between a mobile/embedded device, the communities of devices it belongs to, and enterprise systems such as Software and Infrastructure-As-A-Service (SAAS, IAAS) Clouds. By providing this level of abstraction, pervasive applications built using this platform will be able to leverage the high-performance, highly distributed databases being developed for advanced, high-speed full-text searches that are making their way into non-traditional environments such as smartphones and routers.\n\nJ) Artificially Intelligent, Cognitive Edge Processing Module\n\nA next-generation application will need to utilize intelligent software agents/services that can gather data, respond quickly based on this data as it changes, produce and distribute knowledge, and even initiate other agent/service activities on another device or group thereof. The underlying rules engine will be easy to use, provide very high performance against potentially large rule sets, and will be available in multiple languages. These agents will also be able to understand different ontologies as a powerful abstraction to the modeling of knowledge about different domains. This is accomplished by utilizing the Agents 110, Rules 19 and Ontology 17 API modules depicted in FIG. 1.\n\nK) Support for Complex Event Processing (CEP)\n\nThe proposed pervasive platform with the capabilities described has the ability to filter and analyze data on any node and distribute resulting universal business/data to any other node, or interested groups of nodes regardless of their location and software platform.\n\nThe data will often originate from a wide range of sources often from sensory/mobile/embedded devices. The filtering, analyzing and distribution of information/events will first occur as close to the sensory/mobile/embedded device as possible (ideally on it). Such is the basis of the aforementioned ISN.\n\nAdditionally, the proposed pervasive platform will support dynamic groups that represent connected and/or hierarchical analysis/decision support/collaboration groups. Each level of groups analyzes micro events in determining relevant, increasingly coarsely grained, macro events leading to additional data/event filtering, analyzing, collaboration, response and also for determining the routing of that information to enterprise systems/clouds (governments, corporations, research institutions, trading floors, health organizations, etc.).\n\nThis results in the transformation of sensory data to knowledge (DKN) and ultimately to situational awareness and actionable knowledge in real-time or near real-time (CEP). The data traversing this ISN/DKN/CEP needs to be able to navigate firewalls, support (NAT), and be transportable to communities of disparate devices applications, systems and clouds that have expressed interest in receiving such data.\n\nEvery aspect of the platform's flexibility and support for heterogeneous the nodes, protocols, networks, messaging and discovery capabilities is fully leveraged in such a scenario.\n\nCurrently, the process of recording limitless sets of data from sensors, weapons, and communication and intelligence systems results in enormous unique data sets requiring extensive data Filter/Analysis to derive conclusions. The technology of this proposal will provide the logistics community with a network centric communications capability leading to the establishment of a Distributed Knowledge Network, which can operate with any combination of sensors/nodes/participants at various security and need to know levels of information exchange. The use of intelligent mobile agents can move the conduct of multi-service or joint network centric logistics planning into a new level of capability allowing the commander to have real-time knowledge of logistics information during the course of any operation. The two main areas of investigation proposed are providing Synthetic Instrumentation and Self-describing Smart Sensors via Intelligent Mobile Agent Architectures and Intelligent Software Agents and Distributed Knowledge Networks.\n\nUsing an agent-based architecture provides a solid solution capable of being deployed on any industry computing domains (including those with multi-level security and need-to-know domains). Typical uses for agent-based computing techniques are:\n\nReliabilityâMobility and autonomy allow an agent to move from its point of origin into a network and continue to operate even if the originating device is disconnected from the network. By doing so, the agent provides services and satisfies predefined goals without user intervention.\n\nResource OptimizationâIf an agent's goals require extensive communication with a particular resource on the network, moving the agent closer to the resource reduces/eliminates network traffic allowing the agent to perform its duties more quickly. An agent can move from one node to another, so that it may communicate locally with a service resident on that node. Upon arriving at the node, the agent does not require a network connection and can communicate autonomously with the service to send or receive the desired information.\n\nDistributed Parallel ProcessingâAgents can clone themselves and use other agents, breaking a main task into smaller subtasks to distribute the subtasks for parallel execution. One or more agents on multiple nodes can each perform these subtasks\n\nSoftware DeploymentâMobility makes software deployment easy. Any application can be agent enhanced allowing the entire application to literally deploy itself to its final destination. This might be done to enhance performance, self-healing reasons, or for software updates of the agents themselves or the systems they are monitoring.\n\nRecent advances in sensors and instrumentation systems with high throughput data, and digital information storage technologies, have made it possible to acquire, analyze and store large volumes of data in digital form. Advances in computers, communications, Internet, and mobile computing have made it possible to have large volumes of data, Filter/Analysis and decision support tools residing on multiple, geographically distributed, heterogeneous, hardware and software platforms around the globe. However, leveraging the advances in our ability to acquire, store, and analyze into gains in understanding and knowledge requires sophisticated tools for information retrieval, knowledge discovery, and distributed Filter/Analysis solving and decision-making in multi-level security and need-to-know environments.\n\nRapid and constant changes in hardware and software technologies related to tracking systems, monitoring devices, sensors, and other situational awareness tools requires a Data and Service Delivery Platform that provides a flexible, standards based data communication and integration system. Because of the increasing data entry points into the systems and the networks, this platform will require a capability to easily distribute analytical software code or task-based software objects to the data entry points of the systems or networks to effectively sort and analyze data at the source and then communicate more mature or specific knowledge across the systems or networks to lower network bandwidth utilization and route and deliver detailed data or actionable knowledge to enable more effective consumption of the data by appropriate systems, applications or users.\n\nWith the users entering data from various locations, this platform requires the ability to distribute the analytical or task-based software objects to the point of origin. By co-locating at the source, the software can perform initial sort and data Filter/Analysis required to refine the data set. The refining of the data before transmission results in lower network bandwidth utilization and more effective routing to the appropriate systems and/or users for action.\n\nIn order to lower life cycle management and technology upgrade costs, the data and service delivery platform will require the capability to distribute software updates dynamically (at different security levels) without disrupting the system. To efficiently distribute large volumes of data across a distributed network requires the capability to propagate messages across a connection of node âcommunitiesâ or âspacesâ that will increase speed and performance proportional to the number of nodesâin a sense creating a network of networks that scales dynamically.\n\nUnique Capability Requirements:\n\nTurn data into intelligence on edge devices and sensors\n\nDistribute data using peer-to-peer and peer-to-peer group distribution paradigms\n\nDynamically aggregate network nodes into communities\n\nDecentralized messaging supporting all major protocols\n\nDistribute software updates dynamically to distributed devices\n\nEnable transactional data relationships on distributed heterogeneous devices\n\nProvide common, pluggable interface capabilities to heterogeneous devices and systems\n\nA Distributed Knowledge Network (DKN) including Intelligent Software Agents (ISAs) is a technical architecture and distributed Filter/Analysis capability that will provide some of the key enabling technologies for translating recent advances in automated data acquisition, digital storage, computers and communications into fundamental advances supporting data Filter/Analysis, collaborative reviews and related applications\n\nAn ISA is a named object which contains software code, a persistent state, data and a set of attributes (requirements, history, authentication keys, etc.) and can move from one device or system as needed for accomplishing its tasks. Mobile agents provide an efficient framework for performing distributed computation at locations where the relevant data is available instead of expensive shipping of large volumes of data across the network. Most software agent designs consist of at least three components: agent servers, agent interfaces, and agent brokers (service directory). Agent servers support basic agent migration mechanisms, authentication, and sometimes provide other services. Agent brokers provide addresses of agent servers and support mechanisms for uniquely naming agents and agent servers. The agent interface is used by application programs to create and interact with agents.\n\nISA architecture is a valuable strategy due to the ability to:\n\nEnable non-intrusive heterogeneous interoperability of devices, applications, databases and systems enabling ad-hoc integration and a pluggable architectureâthe best aggregation of components for the specific task.\n\nReduce network loadâDistributed instrumentation systems\n\noften require many messages to achieve a task. Agents work distribution and local completion of tasks.\n\nOvercome network latencyâNetwork latency is not an issue as the task is local.\n\nEncapsulate protocolsâDistributed systems use protocols to define how messages and data are transferred. Modifying a protocol requires changing the code on all the sensors and machines in the system. Agents eliminate the need to alter code through encapsulation, the protocol accepts the agent and allows it workâcreating a new agent can create new functionality.\n\nExecute asynchronously and autonomouslyâDistributed mobile devices are not continuously connected to a network. Systems that require constant connections will not work on mobile devices. With agents, a mobile device can connect to the network to check for work/messages. An agent can be sent to the device and work even after the device disconnects. The agent can wait until the device is reconnected to report the result of its task.\n\nAdapt dynamicallyâAgents can distribute themselves to networked machines that most effectively solve the current task.\n\nEnables dynamic reconfiguration of software across distributed nodes and creates an adaptable network.\n\nProvide scalability and fault-toleranceâIf a host is being shut down or additional resources are required, an agent can move on to another host to continue to operate.\n\nThe agent performs its task and saves any results until its connection to the user is re-established. Mobile agents provide a reliable transport between a client and server without necessitating a reliable underlying communications medium.\n\nIntelligent Software Agents & Knowledge Network Concepts\n\nAn Agent is software that assists with tasks and acts on behalf of the initiator. Agents are typically: goal-driven, reactive, social, adaptive and mobile. Agents have one or more of these characteristics:\n\nOngoing ExecutionâAgents run for a long time\n\nAutonomyâAgents do not require human supervision to function\n\nCharacterâAgents have personality, and exhibit human-like qualities\n\nAdaptiveâAgents adapt to their environment and customize themselves to the preferences of their user\n\nAgent awarenessâAgents can communicate and interact with other agents\n\nMobileâAgents can move around on the network\n\nThe many features of a robust, intelligent, self-managing agent platform and the various types of agents provide for a very powerful, non-obtrusive, monitoring, healing and problem-solving capability. Specifically, the more challenging and diverse an environment is, the more an intelligent, agent-based approach will be considered. Next-generation solutions for mobile applications will provide a high level of security to ensure privacy, and protection from rogue/viral processes. This is most effectively accomplished via security software agents and agent managers that provide capabilities above and beyond the current encryption, authentication and authorization that are currently employed in today's centralized client server applications.\n\nIntelligent software agents can reside on any heterogeneous device or node such as sensors, readers, cameras, PDA's, smart phones, desktops, laptops, tablets, servers and mainframes. Additionally they can execute effectively within any software architecture from thick and thin client-server applications to widely decentralized applications or DKNs. More specifically, at any point in time a node will be acting as a client or server. Briefly multi-level, role-based security is often accomplished as follows:\n\nAll node-to-node distributed communication is encrypted using a pluggable protocol framework that can allow for SSL, TLS or other government implementations utilizing public key cryptography. Intelligent mobile agents will travel with public keys, but only agent managers will contain private keys, which will be accessible to a simulation agent arriving or resident at a node, only upon verifying the agent with the security agent manager.\n\nAuthentication is accomplished using X.509 client and site certificates. Site certificates can be resident at each processing node, and again are overseen by security agent managers. Simulation agents will travel with client certificates containing its role information, as well as the identity and roles of the Administrator deploying it (see below).\n\nAuthorization of Users, Customers, Administrators and even DKN processes within applications or tools are based on assigned roles, using a Role-Based Access Control Architecture (RBAC). In turn, Super Users assigned to key applications, systems and/or domains, with the highest level of security clearance, will be responsible for assigning roles to Administrators.\n\nAgent managers' resident on nodes actually participating in a DKN network, will verify and validate any arriving intelligent mobile agents using the same RBAC architecture. The client certificate, containing identity, key, and role information will be used by the Security Agent Manager to determine if the Agent may arrive at its node and execute the process desired.\n\nA Software Agent Administrator assigns agent roles using Agent Monitoring tools. The Administrator uses the same tool for the creation of public and private keys and X.509 Certificates, as well as their association with Agents and DKN nodes.\n\nAdministrator tool-based security is performed by a security Agent Manager resident on the management application nodes. The role of the administrator will be used to determine w"
