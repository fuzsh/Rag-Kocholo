        "text": "Internet of Things (IoT) marks the dawn of a technological revolution that rivals the industrial revolution. In this new era, intelligent computing becomes anticipatory, proactive, and adaptive. The next big growth in IoT systems will come from pushing Pervasive Personalized Intelligence (PPI) to the edge of the network, where latency is critical, and mobility, privacy, and context awareness are essential qualities of the application. The PPI Center will support the thrusts that enable an entirely new class of applications with intelligence that is predictive instead of reactive, thus making processes more efficient and saving time, energy, and money.\n\nThe PPI Center is a multi-university, industry-focused research center under the supervision of the US National Science Foundation (NSF). We operate under the NSF IUCRC model. The pre-competitive (i.e., of interest to many companies) and industry-applied research projects we work on are funded by industry members, by our universities, and by the NSF.\n\nâ€‹\n\nOur 60+ companies represented at our meetings include many of the global high-tech companies, the leading companies in the IoT domain (smart buildings, smart home, smart city, Industry 4.0, smart health), and many medium-size and startups from Colorado, Oregon, Silicon Valley, and Japan. Our mission is to engage our industry members through twice-a-year workshops, progress reports, student internships, etc. We do not simply accept members as Corporate Affiliations; we want to work with engaged industry members. We are project-driven, and we stay accountable to our members for the progress we make. It is this accountability that makes us better and helps us to serve our members."
