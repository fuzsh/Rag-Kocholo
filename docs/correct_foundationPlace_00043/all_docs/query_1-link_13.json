        "text": "BGS-TxDOT Bridge Geometry System\n\nThe TxDOT Bridge Geometry System (BGS) is useful for bridge geometric design. Included in the text output are geometric data and reports that may be imported into various MicroStation design files to include angles, dimensions, elevations, etc. in the bridge plans as needed to accurately fabricate and place the various bridge elements during construction as well as determine bid item quantities during preparation of the PS&E package.\n\nBGS Version 8.1, the initial release of BGS (June 2007), was developed from TxDOT Roadway Design System (RDS) Version 8.0 by removing all non-bridge related RDS commands. The result of these changes to RDS is BGS, a \"scaled down\" implementation of TxDOT RDS that focuses on bridge geometrics. BGS v8.1.7.2 was deployed in November of 2011 as a technical release to address OS issues with v8.1.7 (i.e. 8.1) released June 2007.\n\nBGS, Version 9.1 includes a large number of fixes to bugs reported since the release of BGS Version 8.1 as well as enhancements to address user's concerns, including reducing system limitations on numbers such as the number of diaphragm lines that could be defined. Such limitation existed since long before the release of RDS Version 8.0. For a complete listing of the changes made to BGS Version 8.1 to yield BGS Version 9.1, see the Release Notes for BGS Version 9.1 installed with the software. This software product was developed by TxDOT for the use of TxDOT engineers and consultants and is maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation.\n\nThe current draft of the BGS v9.1 User Guide is over 360 pages long. Due to file size and for other reasons it is not deployed directly to the end user's machine but is rather stored on TxDOT_s FTP server. Users can access the guide via a link to it installed in the Bridge Geometry System (BGS) program group. This decoupling of the BGS User Guide from the packaging of the software allows for revision on an as-needed basis throughout the life of BGS v9.1. This BGS User Guide, like the old RDS User Manual, should provide all the information that the user will need to run the software.\n\nSee the BGS Support Information document, linked in the same manner as the BGS User Guide, for instructions on how to report bugs and wishes about program functionality or get technical support. Technical support is available to all TxDOT BGS users and any consultant BGS users designing bridges for TxDOT.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This 2/20/2020 release of BGS, Version 9.1.6 is a technical release intended to address Windows 10 compatibility and the false positives for malware by malware scanning software issues. The false positive for malware issue has persisted since shortly after the 02/12/2016 posting of BGS 9.1.6, as malware detection software began becoming increasingly more sensitive. The repackaging of the installer includes revised names and content for some documentation. The functionality of the compiled elements of the BGS software have not changed, hence the compile program version remains 9.1.6.\n\nBridgeLink v7.0.2 (PGSUPER - Prestressed Girder Superstructure Design and Analysis)\n\nPGSuper is now part of the BridgeLink application framework. BridgeLink is an integrated suite of bridge engineering software. BridgeLink links together several different bridge engineering software tools into one convenient and easy to use platform. The software tools included in BridgeLink are BEToolbox, PGSplice, PGSuper, TOGA, and XBRate.\n\nBridgeLink has been collaboratively developed and maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) and the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) under the Alternate Route Project initiated and managed by WSDOT. (http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/eesc/bridge/alternateroute/licenses.htm)\n\nBridgeLink User Guide (March 2020)\n\nThis TxDOT-customized version of PGSuper is versatile, user friendly, Windows-based software for the design, analysis, and load rating of multi-span precast-prestressed concrete bridge beams/girders in accordance with the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications (thru the 9th Edition, 2020) and by TxDOT design policies and guidelines. Properties of TxDOT standard I-girders (TxGirders), U beams, slab beams, decked slab beams, box beams, and X-beams and TxDOT specific design criteria are included in templates and libraries published by TxDOT on a server accessible via the Internet. Thus, the software is capable of periodically updating the installed templates and libraries with the most current versions published by TxDOT. Though these templates and libraries are subject to change, the user may save PGSuper project data with its associated templates, libraries and settings in a .pgs file which can subsequently be opened by PGSuper preserving the templates, libraries, settings and design data of the bridges as originally designed.\n\nCustom defined beam shapes that fit within each family of girder types supported by PGSuper can also be added to the user copy of the templates, thereby extending the girder shapes that the user can design, analyze, and load rate with the program.\n\nThe flexural design feature computes the required number and pattern of prestressing strands and the minimum required release and final concrete strengths. Specification checking evaluates girders for compliance with strength, serviceability, and detailing criteria. Horizontal and vertical shear design, analysis, and load rating is also facilitated.\n\nA variety of results reporting is provided, including exhaustive and comprehensive reports, reports tailored to specific design or analysis features, fabricator optional design evaluation reports, and a TxDOT Girder Schedule Report (\"TxDOT CAD Output\").\n\nCertain functionalities of this version of PGSuper have been enhanced over that of the previous release, and most known issues/bugs present in the previous release are fixed in this release. For a list of these changes see the PGSuper support Information Document.\n\nReport all bugs or request technical support via email to BRG_TxDOT_PGSuperHelp@txdot.gov\n\nPSTRS14-TxDOT Prestressed Concrete Beam Design/Analysis Program\n\nPSTRS14 has been developed and is maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). The program can design and analyze standard and user defined non-standard, simple span prestressed concrete beams having fully bonded draped or straight strands, or partially debonded straight strands, in accordance with the AASHTO Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) Specifications (3rd Edition, 2004-2006; 4th Edition, 2007-2009; 5th Edition, 2010; and 6th Edition, 2012), AASHTO Standard Specifications for Highway Bridges (15th Edition, 1994 Interim thru 17th Edition, 2002), or American Railway Engineering and Maintenance-of-Way Association (4th Edition, 2008-2009).\n\nProperties of standard I beams, Dbl-T beams, U beams, Slab beams, Box beams, TxGirders, Decked Slab beams and X-beams are included in the program's beam section library. User defined beam shapes can be designed and analyzed using the non-standard beam option.\n\nPSTRS14 Version 6.1, incorporates enhancements and modifications versus v5.2, including:\n\nconsideration of End Distance, Transfer Length, and Beam Length that were ignored in all prior versions of PSTRS14;\n\nupdating provisions of the AASHTO LRFD BDS (thru the 12th Edition);\n\nimplementing the new loss method proposed in Research Project 0-6374, \"Effects of New Prestress Loss Predictions on TxDOT Bridges\";\n\nbug fixes to the v5.1 implementation of the complex AASHTO LRFD loss of prestress methodology, that was introduced in the 4th Edition (2007) and remains the AASHTO method beyond the 6th Edition; and\n\nimplementation of an Optional Life Cycle Camber Report allowing PSTRS14 users to get a report on estimated time dependent camber history based on critical stages in the life of the beam/bridge, including at end of service life.\n\nPSTRS14 Version 6.1.1 is a repackaging of version 6.1 to all installation on Windows 10 systems.\n\nNote on appropriate use: PSTRS14 is not intended to take the place of PGSuper in production design but rather is a tool for doing comparison design and analysis, for investigating non-standard sections, for prestressed concrete beam design and analysis for railroad bridges, and for investigating existing bridges designed in accordance with either the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications or AASHTO Standard Specifications for Highway Bridges listed above.\n\nFollowing the precedent set by the release of BGS v9.1 the PSTRS14 v6.1.1 User Guide is not deployed directly to the end user's machine but is stored on the TxDOT FTP server. Users access the guide via a link installed in the Prestressed Concrete Beam Design & Analysis Program (PSTRS14) program group.\n\nSee the PSTRS14 Support Information Document, linked in the same manner as the PSTRS14 v6.1.1 User Guide, for instructions on how to report bugs and wishes about program functionality or get technical support. Technical support is available to all TxDOT PSTRS14 users and any consultant PSTRS14 users designing bridges for TxDOT."
