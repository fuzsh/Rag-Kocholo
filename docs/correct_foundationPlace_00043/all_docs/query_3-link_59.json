        "text": "Summary\n\nPervasive computing, where there is computation available throughout the environment requires an effective infrastructure to manage the information in each of the machines. This project creates the software infrastructure for creating software for smart buildings and spaces, so that they can deliver personalised services.\n\nSupervisor\n\nProfessor Judy Kay.\n\nResearch location\n\nComputer Science\n\nProgram type\n\nN/A\n\nSynopsis\n\nThis project builds on the CHAI group's Personis software framework for building pervasive systems. This has been used to address important problems in pervasive computing and is an excellent foundation for tackling many that still need to be addressed. The project scope also includes creation of \"appliance\" computers which are highly specialised to do a single, important task well. The core of these projects involves creation of new software systems and their evaluation, both in terms of classic systems aspects such as scalability and their usefulness.For more information, see:http://chai.it.usyd.edu.au/Projects/ONCOR\n\nhttp://chai.it.usyd.edu.au/Projects/KeepInTouch\n\nhttp://chai.it.usyd.edu.au/Projects/Personis\n\nhttp://chai.it.usyd.edu.au/Projects/Locator\n\nWant to find out more?\n\nOpportunity ID\n\nThe opportunity ID for this research opportunity is 510\n\nOther opportunities with Professor Judy Kay"
