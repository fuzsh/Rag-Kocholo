This document discusses key technologies for smart factories in Industry 4.0. It proposes a hierarchical architecture for smart factories with physical, network, and data application layers. At the physical layer, technologies like real-time information acquisition and fast reconfiguration are discussed. The network layer examines technologies like industrial IoT, wireless sensor networks, and software defined networks. The data application layer focuses on cloud platforms, data analysis, data mining, and ontology modeling. The document also provides an example application of these technologies in a candy packing line and discusses challenges in realizing smart factories.",
