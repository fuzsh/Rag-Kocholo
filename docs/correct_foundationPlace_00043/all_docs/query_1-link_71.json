If you are planning to start at a community college and then continue at a school of architecture, be sure to contact the university you wish to attend to confirm your coursework will be transferable.\n\nMany community colleges also contain additional related programs in drafting and construction that provide necessary technical skills applicable to the building industry, which also feed directly into the workforce. Visit the website or contact the school for more information.\n\nProgram Description\n\nThe Dallas College Architecture program is an opportunity for students to get exposure to the wide variety of skills that architects must master, through a curriculum of transferable college-level courses. The Architecture program specializes in architectural history, aesthetics, elements of design, hand-sketching techniques, computer graphics, and structural concepts, and the courses are transferable into any public university architecture program in the state of Texas.\n\nContact\n\nDouglas R.
