        "text": "Extended scale of space - Instead of being bounded within a customized space, a user could have the ¡§halo of computation¡¨ follow her from place to place, instantaneously exploiting whatever resources nearby.\n\nExtended scale of time - Computation would be used to serve our daily activities. Ideally, it should be always available on a 7*24 hr schedule, much like the electricity supply.\n\nExtended application domain - We do not directly interact with computation, but with the computation-enhanced physical world in a natural way. Empowered with various sensors, the surroundings are able to understand our situation, predict our intent, and act automatically.\n\nHeterogeneity - The range of computing devices widens, challenge to bridge those devices becomes imperative\n\nDynamism - From both the environment and the user side. A user might abruptly change his/her goal or adapt her actions to a changing environment. Mobility also introduces the explicit changing of execution environment.\n\nMobility - User¡¦s tasks will migrate from place to place. The environments on the trail will dynamically accommodate, execute and hand over the user¡¦s tasks.\n\nContext-awareness - A distinct feature of pervasive computing. It typically includes location, identity, activity and state of people, groups and objects. Context-awareness guides the appropriate adaptation of computation, similar to the way we adapt our behaviors to different situations.\n\nDynamic adaptation - the modification of an application during its execution due to significant mismatch existing between a resource¡¦s supply and demand.\n\nUser-level Mobility - Task mobility : enables a user to continuously interact with his/her task even on the move. Guarantee the user-perceivable continuity and maintain a certain level of user¡¦s satisfaction.\n\nSupport for context-aware applications - The efficient gathering context data from various sensors, the proper synthesis of information and the in-time delivery to context consumer.\n\nUser-centric (Task-driven, Goal-oriented) - requires the abstraction level of computation be raised, so that users could focus on the goals to accomplish.\n\nNov. 30, 2009: Dexter H.
