        "text": "In this paper, we recount our research on undergraduate mathematics students learning to use programming for mathematics investigation projects. More precisely, we focus on how a particular theoretical perspective (the Instrumental Approach) helps us better understand this student activity. Pulling data from students&#39; and instructors&#39; experiences in a sequence of courses (offered since 2001), our results expose, at the micro and macro levels, how the student activity is organized (through stable &#39;ways of doing&#39;), and highlights the complexity of this activity (as an intertwined web of &#39;ways of doing&#39; involving a combination of both mathematics and programming competencies). We end with concrete recommendations to instructors. Dans cet article, nous présentons notre recherche sur les étudiants de premier cycle en mathématiques apprenant à utiliser la programmation pour des projets d&#39;investigation en mathématiques. Plus précisément, nous nous concentrons su...\n\nIn the 1980s and 90s, the idea of engaging in computer programming for learning and exploring mathematical concepts became popular in mathematics education at basic levels, in what is now known as the constructionism paradigm. However, the teaching and learning of mathematics in higher levels was rarely influenced by that approach. Here I present some of the projects that I been involved with in the past few years, where this idea of students’ engaging in active computer programming, within structured learning environments, has been at the centre. One such project, involves engineering students engaging in the construction of video games, where they have to use mathematical models to create simulations of physical and engineering systems. Another is a virtual mathematics laboratory for continuing education distance students where they collaborate in building and exploring models of real phenomena. A third one is an approach for the teaching and learning of statistics where both under- and post-graduate students carry out sequences of tasks with the R programming environment for them to actively engage with both the statistical concepts as well as with a tool (R) for carrying out statistical analyses.\n\nIn this paper we explore the potentials for learning mathematics through programming by a combination of theoretically derived potentials and cases of practical pedagogical work. We propose a model with three interdependent learning potentials as programming can; (1) promote thinking in algorithms, (2) support abstraction and encapsulation, and (3) help reframe the students as a producer of knowledge and artefacts. Programming is a topic that has recently gained a lot of interest at primary and lower secondary level in various countries, and hence a specific analysis of the potentials in relation to mathematics is paramount. Analysing two cases we suggest a number of ways in which didactical attention to epistemic mediation can support the learning of mathematics.\n\nOne of my last assignments at the university of Gothenburg was to teach a sequence of three seminars in programming for prospective teachers (n=37). The three seminars are given in the introduction of this manuscript. Since this was a course for prospective upper secondary teacher of mathematics, it was decided that it should be a course in programming for learning mathematics. This manuscript is a research article but also a manuscript about programming in GeoGebra, Python, and Wolfram Alpha. The examples I shared with my students led me to write a book about programming. See the reference list.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to review the changes that computers have on mathematics itself and on mathematics curriculum. The study aims at investigating different applications of computers in education in general, and mathematics education in particular and their applications on mathematics curriculum and on teaching and learning of mathematics. There are three broad categories of the applications of computers in the field of mathematics education: computer assisted instruction (CAI), student (educational) programming and general purpose educational tools such as spreadsheets, databases and computer algebra systems (CAS). This study presents a historical background and attempts to describe the paradigmatic shift in the use of computers in mathematics education from behavioristicly oriented CAI movement towards constructivist based student programming movement.\n\nComputer technology is now an integral aspect of modern life. It is also a tool that can support the learning of different disciplines. Computer technology provides the possibility to display rich graphical images which may be especially important when teaching different branches of mathematics such as trigonometry. An on-screen image (diagram) clearly demonstrates the relationship between key learning points and how they interact. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of the associated program supports interactive learning in which the parameters may be modified and the result displayed - which is basis of the constructivist theory of pedagogy. This paper is a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the use of computer science as a tool to improve the teaching of trigonometry."
