Our research network was established in 2015 at the initiative of Victoria de Grazia under the auspices of Columbia’s European Institute with funding from the President’s Global Innovation Fund at Columbia University and the European Institute’s Initiative on Cultural Power in International Relations. With Burcu Baykurt’s coordination, this group came together at a series of workshops titled “De-Provincializing Soft Power: A Global-Historical Approach.” We met at Columbia University in January 2015, in Istanbul in June 2015, in Beijing in June 2016, in São Paolo in March 2017, and again at Columbia University in November 2018. Additional funding for the workshops in Beijing and São Paolo came from a grant from Alliance’s Trilateral Initiatives in Emerging Regions. A final meeting at Columbia, “Two Hegemonic Restructuring Projects in Diachronic Perspective: America’s Marshall Plan (1948–1951) and China’s Belt and Road Initiative (2013–),” had support from the European Institute, the Weatherhead East Asian Institute, the Institute for Social and Economic Research and Policy (ISERP), and the Department of History. We especially want to thank Safwan M. Masri, executive vice president for Global Centers at Columbia University, together with Ipek Cem Taha in Istanbul, Joan Kaufman and Bin Pei in Beijing, and Thomas Trebat in [ vii ]\n\nRio de Janeiro, the directors of the local centers, along with their staff, for their assistance in hosting these meetings. At the European Institute, Adam Tooze, the current director, gave his enthusiastic support, as did the institute’s peerless staff: François Carrel-Billiard in the lead, Sharon Kim, and their predecessors, Christopher Hill and Lily Glenn. The ideas shaping this book evolved through conversations with Richard Balme, Peter Katzenstein, Edward Keene, Monroe Price, Robert Vitalis, Vasilis Trigkas, and Yiwei Wang, and at Columbia University with Hisham Aidi, Charles Armstrong, Karen Barkey, Richard John, Andrew Nathan, Victoria Phillips, Pablo Piccato, and Anya Schiffrin. Victoria de Grazia gives special thanks to students in her courses and workshops on Soft Power in Historical Perspective for their lively critique of the mindset that has made “soft power” such a popular term and so easily misconstrued. As the chapters for the collection began to cohere, Martha Schulman offered her editorial assistance and deftly shepherded the project to completion. Emilie Yu Marine Xie provided sharp translation skills. Our editor, Caelyn Cobb, was thoughtful and responsive in every step of the process. Our warm thanks to the staff at Columbia University Press, and the Press’s outside readers, whose astute comments made the manuscript much stronger.\n\n[ viii ] A C K N OW L E D G M E N T S\n\nSOF T- P OW E R I N T E R N AT IO N A L IS M\n\nIntroduction Soft-Power Internationalism B U R C U BAY K U RT A N D V I C TO R I A D E G R A Z I A\n\nT\n\nhe last decade of the twentieth century started with anticipation— and foreboding—about the opening of a new world. The dismantling of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the resulting reforms in communist regimes all indicated that the threat of a cataclysmic confrontation between the two superpower alliances was over. Yet there was no settled agreement on what that meant. As journalist William Schmidt, after interviewing everyday Americans across the country, concluded in 1990, “While there was a strong sense that the Soviet Union had probably lost the cold war, few were willing to say the United States had won.”1 One reason surely was that U.S. foreign policy has a long history of interweaving hard-nosed interests and dulcet values, but this diplomatic deftness always depended on a clearly marked antagonist. “The problem for the United States will be less the rising challenge of another major power than a general diffusion of power,” Joseph S. Nye Jr. proclaimed in 1990, while calling for a reevaluation of foreign policy strategy.2 At the same time, the dissipation of that enemy figure presented the country’s policy makers with an opportunity to establish a more expansive, if looser, global hegemony. The unraveling of the Soviet Union without a military conflict and the growing attraction of democratic ideals around the world offered the glimpse of a more stable, less militarized, peace—but also of multiple countries attempting to stake out a role in shaping international politics. [1]\n\nNye coined the term “soft power” to characterize the policy the United States should employ to give order to the emerging new world. His simple definition of the concept—“getting others to want what you want”— aimed to provide a liberal blueprint for keeping a U.S.-led international system in place. Rather than military might or economic sanctions, Nye suggested, it was cultural attraction, ideology, and international institutions that could align a multipolar, multicivilizational world with the American imperium. Soft power was an attempt to define a new capacity for foreign policy analogous to military and economic power, one that would make the highly visible American leadership more palatable to the rest of the world. Very much bound up with rebuilding the U.S.-led liberal international order, the concept was offered as a supplement to, not a replacement for, military force and economic control. Soft power would aim to reinvigorate the United States’ ability to engage, assist, and communicate with a variety of states and nonstate actors. The effectiveness of this new power would derive from promoting democracy and human rights, collaborating with civil society actors and international institutions, and using information technologies to support cultural programs. In that sense, far from a radical revision of U.S. diplomacy, the United States aimed to mobilize its seemingly irresistible accumulations of symbolic capital and connect them to the surge of democratic feelings and institutions around the world, in tandem with American foreign policy and in the interest of legitimating American global primacy. Possibly beyond what Nye originally intended, the concept soon took on a life of its own, evolving into a plausible foreign policy agenda outside the United States. Countries engaged in what they called “soft strategies” to enhance their cultural influence and make it commensurate with— or even superior to—their economic, political, and military weight. Inside the European Union (EU), the agenda called for promoting “normative power.” As new economic powers began to emerge in the early 2000s, they invested significantly in cultural diplomacy and expanded their toolkits of cultural programs, humanitarian and development aid, public diplomacy, and information technologies to project their ambitions into the world. Academic and business consultancies began to draw up soft-power indices to establish new global hierarchies among nation-states. Civil society organizations and corporations also adopted the idea of soft power in their quest to assert influence worldwide and establish horizontal counterpower against governments. In the process, the term became a marker of a new [2]\n\nB U R C U B AY K U RT A N D V I C T O R I A D E G R A Z I A\n\nkind of global interstate political competition, and, potentially, a new model for multilateral global governance in the early twenty-first century— even as the United States has continued to dominate militarily. This book explores this rapid spread of the concept of soft power across the globe over the last thirty years, but also how it crashed. It traces how the communication networks, normative concepts, and diplomatic practices associated with it imagined—and to an extent made possible—a multilateral, liberal politics that mainly worked to build on the expansion of global markets and tried to mitigate the extremist political reactions, bumptious claims of rising economic powers, and cultural fractures generated by a new world. We start from the paradox that as the concept of soft power was disseminated globally, it became a key word that concealed more than it revealed. Through a comparative lens turned toward the United States, the EU, China, Brazil, and Turkey, we analyze what facilitated the adoption of the American notion of soft power and in what ways this notion evolved as a reaction to global and regional changes. The result is a study both of how a concept has taken hold worldwide and of a global moment in which many countries sensed a shift in international affairs and saw promise in this new phenomenon. It is also a study of the fateful trends undermining that promise. These include the battered economic growth ensuing from the financial crisis of 2008, frustrated regional hegemonic ambitions, and rising nationalism. They also include unabating militarization arising from the U.S.-led global war on terror and the weaponization of the global internet. Methodologically, we combine a transnational critical theory with a historical-sociological approach to examine soft power as a distinct historical period, from roughly 1990 to 2015. Our goal is to deprovincialize the concept from the Euro-Atlantic locus in which it was initially formulated and debated. These five cases display the range of soft powers that have appeared over the last thirty years at the global and regional level. While the United States tried to claim the original model of soft power, even as it has attempted to modify it several times, the EU sought to develop a coherent alternative to U.S. leadership through norms-making— that is, normative power. China and Brazil became formidable international actors over the last few decades, while Turkey tried to use its momentous economic growth in the 2000s to play an assertive role in the Middle East. All used the soft power turn as a way to rebalance the power of the United States and Europe, framing their values in postcolonial terms. Their I N T RO D U C T I O N\n\n[3]\n\nappropriations of the idea of soft power revealed dimensions that its American originator had perhaps not conceived of, while also shedding light on the increasingly globalized intrastate competition around the politics of persuasion. Our genealogy of soft power starts in 1990, following the fall of the Berlin Wall and the bold proclamations about the end of the Cold War; Nye first introduced the term at a time when many countries were trying to understand their place in the world. We end our analysis circa 2015, when a cluster of events challenged the foundations of each hegemon’s quest for normative leadership, thereby calling into question the premises of soft power as it originated in the 1990s and after it was taken up by several countries—namely, a multilateral liberal order in international affairs, multivocality in global organizations, and the democratizing capacity of information technologies. Rather than pinpointing a particular date that marks the concept’s demise, we note the resurgent nationalism in domestic and foreign affairs, heightened regional conflicts, and a far more conflictual use of digital technologies as indicators of the recent radical diversion. Turkey’s ambitions for regional influence were thwarted by domestic crises and the ongoing Syrian conflict; corruption scandals in Brazil exposed the vulnerability of the country’s claim to international leadership; the limits of the EU’s power were revealed especially sharply through the conflict with the Russian Confederation in Ukraine; and the weakening of U.S. dominion in global affairs became much more pronounced during the presidency of Donald Trump. Among our case studies, it is only China that continues its commitment to soft power, much reframed but also much more ambitious in scale. The period between 1990 and 2015 is defined by what we call “softpower internationalism,” wherein aspiring regional or global hegemons not only relied on cultural resources to wield influence, but also actively countered established powers through nonmilitaristic means. Similar to the liberal internationalist project of U.S. foreign policy that aimed for ascendance through the promotion of liberal principles, soft-power internationalism enabled emerging powers to mobilize their own cultural resources in order to project influence.3 More acutely aware of the history and changing character of American dominance, many countries recognized that conventional military means could not address complex policy conflicts demanding global leadership and interstate collaboration, even as they [4]\n\nB U R C U B AY K U RT A N D V I C T O R I A D E G R A Z I A\n\ncontinued to recognize the military superiority of the United States. These rising leaders turned to issues of human rights, public health, climate change, or cooperative development to pursue national and multilateral interests in international affairs. From the elegantly choreographed ceremonies during the Beijing Olympics to Turkey’s plans to reestablish the one-time unity of the eastern Mediterranean, Middle East, and the Horn of Africa to Brazil’s attempt at diplomatic leadership in South- South relations, soft-power internationalism became the way to claim a benevolent form of hegemony. Soft-power internationalism did not necessarily offer an alternative to either the so-called liberal international order or militarism, but it at least raised the prospect of a collective check to the unilateralist vision of American dominion after the Cold War.4 It offered a new framework and politics of persuasion, whose apparatus now expanded to cultural institutes, development aid, communication technologies, multinational companies, public diplomacy, nation branding, and trade policies. It promised to reinforce global governance and international civil society organizations. As each actor brought distinctive civilizational resources to their endeavors (coming out of metanarratives about their pasts, whether as empires or anticolonialists), staked out different modalities of influence, and developed paradigmatic institutional practices, soft-power internationalism became a terrain on which emerging powers could challenge the hegemony of the U.S.-led liberal international order. Four features distinguish soft-power internationalism as a mode of governance, the first and most fundamental being that it was unabashedly bound up with the neoliberal project coming out of the 1980s. We see the effort to mobilize normative values and institutions of norms-making as another dimension to the more or less coordinated political project to encase free markets within an interdependent world and to insulate the global economy from the whimsical decisions of nation- states.5 From that perspective, the development of soft resources went hand in hand with the notion of “sweet commerce,” meaning that accelerating global trade would generate a wealth of transnational and international connections. Though reflecting their own national interests, many countries would have to present themselves in the same normative language and thus be ancillary to the dominant nexus of global institutions, including the World Bank, the IMF, and the European Central Bank, and trade agreements like NAFTA and the WTO, to effectively protect international I N T RO D U C T I O N\n\n[5]\n\ncapital from infringement by domestic policies or the unpredictability of democratic politics. The institutional nexus of neoliberalism flourished with the booms and busts of the 1990s and early twenty-first century until the financial crisis in 2008, thereby accounting for the astounding economic growth of the BRICS, Turkey, and the EU. This cycle gave fresh legitimacy not only to these international organizations, but also to the promise that these new global actors— and their soft-power projects burgeoning from the commodity booms that made their states exceptionally well off in those years— could have a voice in them. Whether China’s legitimation of its international image through the WTO, the integration of Europe toward a single market, or Turkey’s use of its Ottoman imperial past to develop new markets in the Middle East, soft-power internationalism reshaped diplomacy into market-confirming practices. The relationship between neoliberalism and soft-power internationalism was mutually beneficial. In the 2000s, as more countries accessed international-capital flows, grew their exports, and benefited from rising commodity prices, they ramped up soft-power practices to advance their political and diplomatic standing around the world. The second feature is that soft-power internationalism created a new kind of interdependence that did not fit traditional definitions of actors, ideologies, and alliances. Not only have many governmental institutions become significantly globalized since the Cold War’s end; a new crop of actors shaping political demands and opportunities has emerged in international politics. Multinational firms, civic groups, trade consultants, and transnational NGOs contested and engaged more visibly with conventional diplomats and political leaders as they all grappled with the risks and benefits of globalization. This new “policy interdependence” led not just to forging new kinds of alliances in different jurisdictions, but also highlighted the significance of norms-making and consensus-building in international affairs.6 While soft-power internationalism generated a new kind of cooperation among state and nonstate actors, its modus operandi presented itself as a pragmatic approach of mutual benefits and shared values, as opposed to pure ideologies. Subalternity, South- South solidarity, or shared histories of poverty, for example, were taken up by countries like Brazil or China to build solidarity, in contrast to the way Western aid had been traditionally framed as unreciprocated gifts and used to reaffirm global leadership.7 The evolution of various information technologies into the global internet marks the third feature of soft-power internationalism. The [6]\n\nB U R C U B AY K U RT A N D V I C T O R I A D E G R A Z I A\n\nhyperconnectivity enabled by computer networks since the 1990s has led to an intensified circulation of ideas, money, and people. The communicative promises of the global internet to foster social change and cultivate liberal democratic values were deeply embedded within the U.S. narratives of expanding the liberal international order post– Cold War.8 Simultaneously a global broadcast medium, a gateway to competing in international markets, and a network that ties the critical infrastructures of nationstates to one another, the global internet has significantly changed the pillars of statecraft in the twenty-first century. It created new industries, recast older ones that traditionally relied on global supply chains, and centered strategic communication at the heart of diplomatic initiatives. The global internet was not just a conduit to circulate soft narratives and mold public opinion; it has also become a competitive terrain on which countries, companies, and civil society actors mobilize their values and norms to reshape governmental control over cyberspace as well as techniques of state-to-state and people-to-people communication.9 The fourth and perhaps most complicated feature of soft-power internationalism has to do with what it is not, or, better, what it claims not to be: war-making. While a soft approach to power was allegedly an antipode to warfare (“hard power,” as Nye called it), it never eliminated war, nor did it necessarily distance itself from the military. Of course, there is nothing new about the fact that soft forms of displaying foreign policy leadership often go hand in hand with making war— even when the link is not at the forefront. From state propaganda to private publicity, governments— and peoples— always mobilize values and belief systems to distinguish between friends and foe in the name of drawing up either alliances or antagonists. But the dialectical relationship between warmaking and diplomatic publicity became blatantly obvious in the period of soft-power internationalism. If Nye’s concept began to be bruited in the early 1990s, the moment it took hold was in the wake of 2003, when the U.S. military saw soft power as a complement to the global war on terror. Fighting against an unspecified enemy with an always- shifting geographic scope, the military incorporated the techniques and discourse of soft-power internationalism into its never- ending occupations and renamed them “peace-building.” As anthropologist Madiha Tahir astutely recognizes, the adversaries in this new war were rarely defined by their ideological or even legal status; they were merely against U.S. culture, or, as George W. Bush once put it, “they hate our way of I N T RO D U C T I O N\n\n[7]\n\nlife.”10 Technological infrastructures that facilitate this war-making from a distance, along with their promise of “precision,” were used to keep an illusory distinction between what the robots (making offensive attacks) and people (offering humanitarian support) did.11 But, in the end, military action always complemented, if not eclipsed, soft-power initiatives. Nye eventually labeled this co- constitution of soft power and warmaking “smart power,” which he described as “neither hard nor soft, but the skillful combination of both.”12 (The concept’s original inventor was Suzanne Nossel, a long-time actor in U.S. foreign policy, media and human rights advocacy).13 When Hillary Clinton became secretary of state, she immediately adopted this new term to emphasize the role of “technology, public-private partnerships, energy, economics” that prop up traditional diplomacy, even as she stayed committed to guns, bombs, and tanks.14 As soft-power internationalism extended beyond the Euro-Atlantic sphere, a similar conflation of humanitarianism with military interventions reverberated through Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and Turkey’s 2019 attack on northern Syria. Some soft-power critics point to the blurred lines between the soft, hard, and smart versions as indicators of the concept’s intellectual weakness, adding that it has always been challenging to measure soft power’s effectiveness. Yet we suggest that the vague premises and ambiguous boundaries of soft power are exactly what made the concept generative and appealing enough to cross borders. Even Russia, a country that has emerged as a significant critic of a West-centric liberal international order, has invested in soft-power internationalism to raise its profile in world politics. Stanislav Budnitsky and Melissa Aronczyk catalog Russia’s foray into soft power in three phases: “The humble and clumsy attempts to be liked in the West in the early and mid-2000s, the assertive promotion of Russia’s standpoint in the global media space after the 2008 Georgia War, and most recently the aggressive push to disrupt and divide the Western narrative following Putin’s 2012 return to presidency and especially with the beginning of the 2014 Ukrainian crisis.”15 Russia’s most recent soft-power initiatives aim not just to upset what it calls “Western narratives,” but also to use tools of the internet and cultural programs to sow suspicion and disarray, thereby challenging the legitimacy of dominant global communication channels.16 This emerging version of soft power—what some pundits call “sharp power”—appears more state-driven, more centralized, and significantly less [8]\n\nB U R C U B AY K U RT A N D V I C T O R I A D E G R A Z I A\n\nliberal, but it nonetheless showcases the deep appeal of managing political narratives, beliefs, and images in international politics. After a prolific reign around the world for twenty-five years, soft-power internationalism has given way to bellicosity as more countries have started gravitating toward more nationalist, if not authoritarian, styles of domestic governing and adopting inward-looking foreign policies. The new key terms are “trade war,” “cyber war,” “hybrid war,” and “sharp power.” This shift clarifies that the illusion of soft-power internationalism as a distinct order of multilateral diplomacy, networked communications, and international civil society was perhaps just that: an illusion. Globally, it seemed to license the belief that countries could substitute cooperation for hostility, generosity for retaliation, and trade partnerships for military force, but it also obscured the fact that the pursuit of geopolitical interests by nationstates would always predominate in international affairs. The paradoxes and contradictions of this international order were bared by the 2008–2009 financial crisis that made it harder to sustain public diplomacy budgets, fractured trade-led global integration, and intensified regional competition. While many countries scrambled to cope with the consequences of austerity, the United States and the EU— so-called protagonists of soft-power internationalism—failed to burnish themselves as models of international liberal order. But this sharp shift also underlines the fact that soft-power internationalism demonstrated, albeit briefly, that nations outside of the Euro-Atlantic context have the capacity not just to participate in, but to shape international politics. The new hegemons benefited from a thriving global capitalism, broke out of the traditional hierarchies of global governance, created new alliances among countries and peoples, and imagined global public goods collectively. This populist foreign policy environment—certainly not what Nye intended back in the 1990s— aimed to generate new solidarities and sociality outside of the old Western colonial legacies. Trying to bind the world horizontally through connectivity among different state and nonstate actors, soft-power internationalism attempted to even out the balance, despite the overwhelming military power exercised by the United States. Most important, this soft diplomatic vitality attempted to respond to the fierce challenges of the twenty-first century. Rather than deciding whether soft-power internationalism was a momentary illusion or a valid promise, this volume reveals the interlinked histories I N T RO D U C T I O N\n\n[9]\n\nof how this hierarchy-breaking period of foreign affairs took shape as an intellectual project as well as a diplomatic practice. The chapters in the first section probe the origins of culture, reputation, and global communication in post– Cold War international relations. Victoria de Grazia traces the genealogy of two key terms that appeared at the outset of the 1990s: “soft power” in the United States, and “normative power” in Europe. Through the distinct, yet intertwined, histories of these concepts and their intellectual architects, she reveals the divergent trajectories of Euro-Atlantic hegemony at the turn of the twenty-first century. While normative power fails to gain traction outside of Europe, its mere existence as a coherent program speaks to the rise of the EU as a new leader in international politics. Soft power, in contrast, elicits worldwide attention and cooperation, yet is ultimately a testament to the crisis of the U.S.-led post– Cold War global order. Burcu Baykurt then examines one of the structural elements of softpower internationalism: the making of the global internet as it was shoehorned into the larger ideal of creating horizontal, pluralistic, and democratic networks dominated by civilian power. The history of the global internet as a liberal myth parallels the history of soft-power internationalism: both projects began in the 1990s with the marriage of the technological and economic interests of the U.S. dominion; enjoyed a truly international, multilateral phase in the 2000s when various state and nonstate actors circulated across cyberspace even as U.S.- origin companies (and, to an extent, the U.S. government) orchestrated both the material network of internet infrastructures and the soft messaging of global connectivity as a civilizing virtue; and faced challenges from counterhegemons from 2010 onward, as the U.S. origins of both projects were unmasked and nation-states took issue with the mythology of a global internet and sought governmental control over digital information flows. Chapters on Turkey focus on how the country has asserted itself as a regional power since the mid-1980s (the “Turkish model”), and how it significantly revised its foreign policy (“neo- Ottomanism”) after a new government came into power in the early 2000s. After recounting Turkey’s long history of reputation-building in global politics, Dilek Barlas and Lerna Yanik suggest that a more pronounced adoption of soft power during the AKP government paralleled Turkey’s shift from trying to integrate itself into an international order led by the United States and Europe to claiming a more autonomous role. Its historical and cultural heritage was [ 10 ]\n\nB U R C U B AY K U RT A N D V I C T O R I A D E G R A Z I A\n\nan important soft-power asset in public diplomacy, and Turkey also exploited the opportunity of trade-driven foreign policy instruments as it tried to build ties with the Balkans, the Middle East, and Turkic-language areas of the former USSR. Mustafa Kutlay recognizes the influence tradeled powers like Japan and Germany exercised coming out of the 1980s to explore Turkey’s endeavors from the first decade of the twenty-first century. His chapter on the use of “economy as a problem-solving mechanism” in foreign policy discusses the limits of trade given the economic turbulence, as well as the identity concerns and geopolitical conflicts in the region. Priding itself on being the “republic of diplomats,” Brazil emerged as another ambitious regional influence in the mid-1980s, immediately after the country moved from dictatorship to liberal government. Despite Brazil’s uncertainty and suspicion about a new post– Cold War global order, it quickly, as Oliver Stuenkel observes, became a natural leader in South America. From leading the charge in global trade and diplomatic negotiations to opposing the U.S.-led Iraq War, to making winning bids to host the World Cup and the Olympics, Brazil exploited its soft-power capacity to project its regional and global ambitions. Particularly during the presidency of leftist populist Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the country expanded its humanitarian aid strategy and presented its domestic success in reducing poverty as a form of expertise in the Global South. Brazilian soft power mobilized a new kind of South- South diplomacy, in which commitment to democracy and liberalism went along with horizontal solidarity, as opposed to the more traditional North-South developmental aid marked by verticality. Yet, as Fernando Santomauro and Jean Tible point out, this radical reimagining of humanitarian aid and cooperation suffered from the structural demands of global capitalism, geopolitical tensions, and the historical legacy of the country’s peripheral status in international politics. What the authors call the country’s “hovering illiberal clouds,” its dependency on international finance, widespread corruption, selective scrutiny from international organizations, and clashing factions within the political establishment, brought first Lulismo and then the new model of diplomacy under attack. While Brazil’s assertive foreign policy in the 2000s had the potential to challenge the hegemony of the Global North, its experience with soft-power internationalism also demonstrates the deep-rooted effects of peripheral dependency. Among the countries we survey in the volume, China is the only one that has consistently and significantly invested in soft power even as similar I N T RO D U C T I O N\n\n[ 11 ]\n\ninitiatives in the United States, EU, Brazil, or Turkey were slowing down. Sustained development assistance in the African continent has been central to Chinese foreign policy. Martina Bassan reviews this relationship, which began in the mid-1950s as a shared struggle against Western hegemony and neocolonialism. Her analysis of China’s recent investments and cultural diplomacy efforts in various African countries demonstrates not only the extent of its economic heft and cultural sway, but also the persuasiveness of its alternative views on global issues. China’s rapid economic growth in recent decades and ambitions toward global leadership culminated in the 2013 announcement of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), intended to link the economies of Europe, Asia, and Africa with roads, rails, ports, and telecom networks. The economic promises and perils of the BRI are a work in progress, but its political message is obvious: China is attempting to build a new model of global leadership in its image. Zhongying Pang speaks to the paradoxical history of “soft power with Chinese characteristics.” When Nye’s original conception was first introduced into the People’s Republic of China, policy makers seized on it as useful in signaling that China would ease its way into the world order without disrupting it. In the 2000s, as China slowly developed its own understanding of soft power, it took up leadership positions in several regional and international organizations. As the country’s influence expanded into global trade, development, higher education, and the internet, however, Chinese soft power appeared to begin embarking on an ambitious project of global leadership (one that mixes the country’s soft and hard capabilities). Pang thus suggests that China’s path to its current status as an emerging imperium has been neither linear nor neat. He also questions the fluid boundaries between terms such as “soft,” “hard,” and “sharp” power, especially as they are applied to countries whose practices do not conform to Western traditions. Anastas Vangeli examines how countries in Central, East, and Southeast Europe (CESEE) have engaged with the BRI and how that reflects on China’s symbolic power. The BRI’s planetary vision for infrastructure growth prompts policy discussions that legitimate China’s centrality in global governance. It also introduces a new frame for partnerships between postsocialist Europe and China, one that, while awkward at times, nonetheless aims to upend established identities of the former socialist countries. [ 12 ]\n\nB U R C U B AY K U RT A N D V I C T O R I A D E G R A Z I A\n\nThe last two chapters of the volume turn to the so- called main protagonists of soft-power internationalism, the EU and the United States, and account for their failure in burnishing their leadership in international politics. If normative power in Europe had a radical vision, Thomas Diez asks what caused the crisis of EU foreign policy. Rather than placing blame on the waning influence of the United States or interference by domestic groups in EU policy, Diez’s answer is both a defense of the moral underpinnings of normative power and a realistic review of institutional capacity in global politics. There was, Diez suggests, a growing gap between the solidaristic vision of normative power, in which states look out not just for their own interests but those of others, and the structure of the EU as well as international society overall, which prioritizes preserving national sovereignty and nonintervention. The radical vision of normative power could only go so far when the structure of international politics remained stubbornly reformist. Jack Snyder grapples with the worldwide rise of illiberal populist nationalism, and what that means for soft power and international relations. Many countries, advanced democracies as well as rising semidemocratic or even illiberal states, enjoyed the growth and strong partnerships facilitated by soft-power internationalism since the 1990s. Nonetheless, the collective pull toward populist nationalism over the last few years is unmistakable. Drawing on Karl Polanyi, Snyder recognizes this divergence as a response to the tension between unregulated markets and demands for mass participation— a tension that is pervasive in all these countries, albeit in different forms. This contradiction between markets and politics is nothing new; neither is illiberal populist nationalism. But is there potential for building solidarity among these illiberal countries and transitioning to an illiberal form of soft power? Without the structural backbone of economic heft or military might, Snyder suggests, soft interventions alone do not carry much weight. More important, he argues that, without shared principles among illiberal actors other than their commitment to putting selfinterest above all else, it is impossible to conjure up an illiberal, nationalist international peace. Is soft power, then, only conceivable within a liberal international order? The evidence we have from the last thirty years points that way, but there is also emerging empirical work that examines illiberal countries’ soft interventions in the era of a waning worldwide commitment to liberal internationalism. Media scholar Bilge Yeşil, for example, investigates how Turkey’s I N T RO D U C T I O N\n\n[ 13 ]\n\nsoft-power interventions under an undeniably authoritarian regime exploit subalterity and deploy ressentiment to create regional solidarities.17 Soft power seems to be of use to harsh regimes, but we have yet to see how durable these new solidarities will be in an increasingly antagonistic global politics. Instead of being seduced by the soft interpretations of soft power, such as the effectiveness of messages or appeal of cultural frameworks, we focus on the political and economic conditions that made this particular epoch possible and how the practice of cultural power in international relations transformed global governance. By making the intellectual baggage and contradictory roots of soft power more visible and showcasing the varieties of soft powers in non-Western contexts, each chapter illuminates the underlying assumptions and expectations of a concept born of the post– Cold War period. At a time when there is a pervasive sense that the liberal international order is unraveling, we hope this book provides insights into what has happened over the last thirty years and what it meant to sustain peace in a multipolar world, in the immediate aftermath of the Cold War.\n\nNotes 1.

This chapter unpacks that baggage at its place of origin. It takes two related concepts— soft power in its original 1990 made-in-America formulation, and normative power, Europe’s home-crafted counterpart, a term that acquired currency circa 2005— and explores their genesis, their evolution, and the competition between them. Reputation, prestige, and legitimacy have always been a concern of statecraft. This chapter asks what historical forces made these two concepts so popular as new kinds of power in foreign policy making, each subject to particular practices and discourses, with specialized agencies, trained personnel, and freshly devised measures of success and failure. It asks what advantages their promoters believed their home countries and the world could gain from them, and who, ideally, they targeted domestically and abroad. What resources were regarded as necessary to turn them into effective instruments of foreign affairs and diplomatic practice? And, finally, how was their success or failure judged? At the risk of essentializing the differences between these two terms, turning them into yet another of the binaries which since the early nineteenth century have been used to explain the differences between Europe and the United States, it is important to underscore that, from the outset, [ 19 ]\n\nthe terms had a different valence. However differently they were conceptualized by the norm-entrepreneur promoters who are the main focus of this chapter, those differences have to take into account the contrasting cultures of war and peace coming out of the Cold War, the dissimilar traditions and methodologies in thinking about international relations, and the diverging political projects of the United States and the EU from the outset of the twenty-first century.1 Soft power starts from the realist premise that if you want power, defined as the ability to get the outcomes you want from others, you can achieve it either by coercion or by attraction and persuasion.2 While hard power— the ability to coerce— comes from a country’s military or economic might, soft power is the ability to attract and persuade. Soft power is the added inducement, the tactical advantage arising from the appeal of the country’s culture, values, and political ideals. It is used not to transform the core beliefs of others, but to encourage them to buy into a common logic, partake of a shared agenda, and, ideally, to build on the trust created by this transactional relationship. Soft power puts communication front and central, insofar as it assumes that differences of viewpoint are often caused by miscommunication and are thus surmountable once the proponent has grasped the target audience, honed the message, calculated how information travels (via the state, markets, civil society) and any possible obstacles (censorship, competing messages, or misinformation), and weighed how to calculate failure or success to account to the various stakeholders. Normative power also claims to work on the basis of shared beliefs, standards, and values, rather than on material incentives or physical force, to bring change in the international order and among or between the nations within it.3 However, it claims that its power of attraction arises from convincing others of the legitimacy of the principles underlying its agenda, and it adds that the only enduring way to achieve this convergence of interests is to promote these principles coherently and systematically. Normative power is thus best served by identifying itself with historically validated principles underlying international law and institutions— principles like multilateralism, national autonomy, human rights, and social justice. To work, it requires an element of shared ownership, and the measure of success is whether the shared values reproduce themselves institutionally, through, say, democratic regimes, or by establishing constitutional principles to end human rights abuses. Normative power often [ 20 ] V I C T O R I A D E G R A Z I A\n\nuses the language of solidarity rather than of transaction, and, to be effective, it calls for a long time frame, like the decades it took for the European Community to evolve into the European Union, or the half-century it took the Western Alliance arising out of Bretton Woods, the Marshall Plan, and NATO to become the spearhead of the anti-Soviet liberal world order. Its success is verified over time and is time- consuming and tolerant of putative missteps. That said, the origins of the two concepts— and the articulation of their differences—have much in common. Both were born of a desire to establish a new kind of global liberal hegemony and of the realization that, while the interests of different states might diverge, they were still compatible with a shared interest in reinforcing the transatlantic alliance. From the outset, then, both concepts underscored the desirability of foregrounding norms and values in foreign affairs, as if this was something new. Both were grounded on the belief that history had destined the relevant entities—the United States and the EU—to assume the leadership mantle for the new liberal order coming out of the Cold War (the United States, of course, has believed in its special destiny practically since its foundation; the EU’s conviction dates from the 1970s). Both presumed that market reforms were the major motor of global change, and both were shaped by rethinking their own and each other’s very different capabilities for war-making in this new order, as opposed to whatever other economic, political, and cultural resources they could use to exercise their influence. Both saw their power as based on the new needs they could address—for instance, agenda-setting around complex global problems like the climate, human rights, humanitarian disasters, aging populations, or women’s inequality, and by providing public goods toward their solution. Additionally, both recognized that they could capitalize on new institutional and technological means to promote themselves. On the one hand was the unsurpassed growth of international agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and people-to people civil society institutions. On the other hand was the new, more- or-less- direct access to innumerable people as consumers through deregulated markets, the World Wide Web, and the rapid advances in entertainment and cybercommunication industries spurred by both.4 For all these similarities, the two concepts evolved very differently. And, when “soft power” emerged as the generic term, the debate over what peaceable, just, and effective international governance might entail lost a S O F T- P OW E R U. S . V E R S U S N O R M AT I V E P OW E R E U\n\n[ 21 ]\n\ngreat deal of nuance. As “soft power” was succeeded by trivial notions like “smart power” and “sharp power,” etc., substantive debate over foreign policy in the United States collapsed. That trajectory, however, signals some of the paradoxes of soft-power internationalism. One is self-evident from the subject of this volume—namely, that soft power (which, in its original formulation, was regarded as a way for the United States to reaffirm its global leadership) was picked up elsewhere by rising hegemons to reinforce their prestige and voice and to rebalance against American military power. The other, which we examine here, sees the United States in the same period as giving a harder and harder edge to its so-called soft resources. This hardening has occurred on three levels: first, by the expanding of pseudoprivate media platforms that, left to their own devices on the pretense that they are unregulated, have intensified cultural and ideological conflicts transnationally via international civil society channels; second, as an effect of the militarization of cyber- and other public-diplomacy programs, thanks to the reaffirmation of the leadership of the Department of Defense in this domain of public affairs; and, third, through the armed battles sustained in pursuing the global war on terror. These battles, of course, have time and again called on civilian forces to develop a cultural rationale to fight and then to legitimate American power once the fighting ends. All of this has politicized Western norms and values and made them appear deeply imperiled by a complex of civilizational values variously called fundamentalist, tribal, totalitarian, illiberal, and antisecular. From the perspective of the North Atlantic World, then, the background for promoting the power of values, beliefs, culture, and communication as a foreign policy arm ought not be viewed as a product of the hopeful moment when the Cold War ended—when commerce, multilateralism, and the renewal of the U.S.-led Western alliance seemed almost inevitable— but, rather, as the opening of an interregnum that has seen huge uncertainty about the basis on which Western hegemony would be reinstated once the certainties of the bipolar Cold War world had to be abandoned.\n\nThe Great Divergence March 20, 2003, marks a key moment in this history. On that date, after a globally televised all-night countdown, the president of the United States, with bipartisan backing from Congress, flouted international law and [ 22 ] V I C T O R I A D E G R A Z I A\n\ndomestic and international protests to invade the Republic of Iraq and overthrow its president. For our purposes, the invasion can be seen as the capstone of the social engineering project that emerged from the Washington Consensus of 1989: Operation Enduring Freedom, a latter-day crusader coalition, would end Muslim resistance that saw the United States as the pinnacle of unholy modernity and made it the object of attacks by militarily insignificant states and nonstate actors that culminated in the Al Qaeda attacks on September 11, 2001. After the brief, successful military operation, the coalition would rebuild the country as a Western-aligned free market economy under liberal constitutional rule, and Iraq would pay for it, by selling its oil on the global markets that had been closed to it by Western economic sanctions. Crazy that it all seemed so simple. Robert Kagan, the well-known American foreign policy analyst, who was living in Brussels on the cusp of the invasion, vividly captured the way European political elites writhed over how to respond to their most important and long-standing ally. Despite the dozen European states (including Italy and Great Britain) that eventually joined the American-led coalition, Kagan announced that, “on the all-important question of power, the efficacy of power, the morality of power, the desirability of power, American and European perspectives are diverging.”5 Kagan’s 2003 book, Of Paradise and Power: Europe and America in the New World Order, is perhaps best remembered for its captivatingly sexist image of Europe as Venus and the United States as Mars. There was Europe lolling like some Rubenesque goddess of love in Kant’s utopia of perpetual peace, happy to exercise her seductive wiles and promote her “civilizing mission” as she undermined world order by denouncing American aggression— and here was the ever-vigilant United States, standing guard to prevent a Hobbesian world from descending into global chaos. Kagan also provided what realists on both sides of the Atlantic regarded as a satisfying account of the origins of this divergence: real differences in military capacity coming out of World War II and the early Cold War were then reinforced culturally as successive European generations became dependent on American might and repudiated their militaristic past so thoroughly that the United States had to act unilaterally to shake Europe back to reality. Though Kagan did not use the terms “soft” and “hard,” his images of an effeminate, seductively veiled Europe and a virile, transparent United States popularized the contrast between the two, while also fanning American nationalism.6 S O F T- P OW E R U. S . V E R S U S N O R M AT I V E P OW E R E U\n\n[ 23 ]\n\nReacting to both the Gulf War and American intellectual warmongering, historians sought to explain the divergence as related to loosely defined cultures of war: the United States, they said, seemed to want to reprise the ideological and cultural dynamics of the global Cold War in the global war on terror. John Dower, a U.S. historian of World War II, wondered if the cultural legacy of the United States’ annihilatory war against the Japanese explained the violent American reaction to 9/11. American political and military historian Andrew Bacevich asked why, in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet bloc, did American partisans of a new peace culture not prevail? And U.S. historian of Germany James Sheehan wondered how the belligerent Europe of the early twentieth century had been transformed into the peace-minded region of the early twentieth century, even writing a book called Where Have All the Soldiers Gone?7 Here I want to further the exploration of the evolving cultures of war across the North Atlantic by juxtaposing the intellectual moves of the people most responsible for the elaboration of our two concepts. They make an unlikely pair: Joseph S. Nye Jr., the Harvard University political scientist who coined the term “soft power” in 1990 and then in 2004 made it a byword not just of U.S. foreign policy debates, but international diplomacy; and Ian James Manners, an itinerant British professor of international relations. If Manners was not the first to conceptualize Normative Power Europe (NPE) as a way to identify and promote the EU’s capacities as a foreign policy actor, his assiduous promotion of the term led the EU’s political class, circa 2008, to adopt it to characterize the EU’s ambitions for global leadership. Bringing them together lets us consider not only differences of continent, disciplinary formation, political leanings, and cultural capital, but also the different class and generational cohorts leading the reconceptualization of international relations on both sides of the Atlantic in the wake of the Cold War. The patrician Nye was born in 1937, son of what we might call New Jersey gentry (his father was a stockbroker), and when he first proposed the term in 1990, he was a senior professor. He entered Harvard University in 1964 to study political science after graduating from Princeton summa cum laude and holding a Rhodes scholarship at Oxford, and it remained his academic base until he retired in 2010 as Distinguished Service Professor and Sultan of Oman Professor of International Relations. From the late 1970s on, he moved seamlessly between Harvard and Washington, DC, serving four years in Democratic administrations and [ 24 ] V I C T O R I A D E G R A Z I A\n\nspeaking at and to inside-the-Beltway think tanks and international forums like the Aspen Institute and Davos. His ideas were published in Foreign Policy and Foreign Affairs, in op-ed pieces in the East Coast press; he appeared on television and YouTube, and his charmingly written general audience books were well timed, well promoted, and globally disseminated by major commercial presses.8 Born in the mid-1960s, Manners, who had just defended his doctoral thesis when he started clarifying his project in the mid-1990s, was more a cobbler of ideas with ideals. His father was a civil engineer; he grew up with stints abroad in the port town/backwater of Portishead near Bristol. After graduating in 1988 from West Virginia University on a track- andfield athletic scholarship, he trained and conducted research in the public sector–led educational landscape of EU Europe. After a stint as a BBC correspondent covering European affairs and attending University College London and Bristol, where he received his PhD degree in international relations in 1994, he started his academic career in red brick universities and between 1995 and 2004 moved from Bristol to the University of Wales at Swansea to the University of Kent at Canterbury. From there he moved to Scandinavia, where, after a period at Malmo (2004–2006); the Danish Institute for International Studies, Copenhagen (2006–2009); and the Institute of Society and Globalization at Roskilde University (2009–2013), he settled into a professorship in the Political Science Department at the University of Copenhagen (punctuated by visitorships at Lund and Sydney). Manners always treated his workmanlike essays as a collaborative undertaking with like-minded scholars; many were elaborated in conferences and networks designed to forge the new field of European studies and disseminated through leading European academic journals, notably Millennium: Journal of European Public Policy, Journal of Common Market Studies, and Cooperation and Conflict.9 Manners’s passion was for a united Europe. He grew up in the peace culture of post-Vietnam Europe, which saw Soviet and American nuclear brinkmanship as a horror and had little or no contact with the British military. His training in critical security studies at the University of Bristol reinforced his skepticism about the utility of war, and, once he spelled out his concept of a “normative Europe,” he was always attentive to preventing it from being exploited to reinforce the hegemonic inclinations of Brussels Eurocrats. Nye was an American patriot comfortable with defense and national security issues and elites, both at home and abroad. He was always S O F T- P OW E R U. S . V E R S U S N O R M AT I V E P OW E R E U\n\n[ 25 ]\n\ntroubled by the specter of Vietnam, and how to resolve the question of what, in terms of American interests, constituted a good or bad war. Even when soft power acquired global currency, he continued trying to make its success and failure elsewhere a tool for and measure of American global influence. For all of their differences—for the purposes of this analysis—both are “norm entrepreneurs,” the term coined by IR scholars Martha Finnemore and Katherine Sikkink. Like promoters of human rights, sustainability, transparency, and environment, over time their ideas can be treated as having evolved “from hobby horses to common sense categories, the basis for reasonable political action at both the domestic and international level.”10 Both Nye’s “soft power” and Manners’s “normative power” originated as corrections of the IR discipline and critiques of foreign policy, and both men endeavored to define the terms coherently yet broadly enough so that not only individuals, think tanks, and NGOs, but also states and international agencies, could assimilate them more or less seamlessly into their rhetoric. That said, Manners’s goal was to conceptualize how the EU could exploit the processes to which it owed its existence—namely, treaty-making, negotiations, cooperation with international institutions, and the values like transparency that were inherent in them—to make itself more internally cohesive and more globally effective. Nye’s project was to convince a skeptical domestic elite that if the United States was to reestablish its leadership in a more interconnected and multilateral international order, it would have to supplement its immense military-political power with its cultural resources. As Nye eventually realized, this required the United States to undertake the kind of domestic reforms that had legitimated its claim to be the preeminent global model in the Progressive Era, under the New Deal, with the Marshall Plan, and as the founding force of the post–World War liberal order with civil society institutions that could be mobilized to operate in tandem with U.S. governmental forces and liberal international institutions globally.\n\nAmerica’s Way The origins of Nye’s conception of soft power take us back to 1970s Cambridge, Massachusetts, Nye’s academic and intellectual home base. Under the mentorship of the French- Jewish humanist- social scientist Stanley [ 26 ] V I C T O R I A D E G R A Z I A\n\nHoffman, Nye shook off the hard- edged realism of the Hans J. Morgenthau–Henry Kissinger school of thought. Steeped in the technocratic optimism of the Cambridge area of those years, he confessed that the Austrian political economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter of “creative destruction” fame was his first great intellectual passion. It was practically impossible in 1960s Cambridge not to embrace the cybernetic utopias of Norbert Weiner that held out the dream of feedback loops of perfect knowledge, nor the flowering of U.S. regional and development studies that brought Nye to study Kenya, Central America, and Japan. As much as any American social scientist of that time, as Nye embraced the master narrative of American progressivism he grasped its corollary that “the ability to persuade other people that you have a picture of the future which is plausible and that this is a way in which they can move, is an important source of power.”11 If concepts were patentable, Nye would have earned millions from branding “soft power.” As it was, his books on the subject were global bestsellers. In the debates about the discipline of international relations that followed the U.S. defeat in the Vietnam War, Nye sided with his cohort—colleagues of great rectitude and intellectual accomplishment like his long-standing collaborator Robert Keohane— against the swaggering realism of a field shaped by the Cold War’s brutal military confrontationalism, as if the fight for global order was still being waged against Nazi totalitarianism and the Axis. This older stance had led to the neglect of the problem of reputation and status and the way states regarded one another’s interests, prestige, and moral outlooks, thus offering an incomplete framework for analyzing international relations, especially considering the growing role of international institutions. While Nye’s first book, Power and Interdependence, written with Keohane, was still grounded in key realist tenets that emphasized the centrality of national self-interest and the use of power to satisfy it, it downplayed old winner-take all assumptions in the name of a more liberal give-and-take.12 In other words, if states regarded institutions like the International Atomic Energy Commission or World Bank as tools of their power and invested in their procedures, they might hesitate to contravene them, sacrificing some benefits for collaboration on issues deemed more important. Nye had experienced that kind of cooperative undertaking as national security advisor in the Carter administration. Based in the State Department, he liaised with the National Security Council Committee to deal with the S O F T- P OW E R U. S . V E R S U S N O R M AT I V E P OW E R E U\n\n[ 27 ]\n\nnonproliferation of nuclear weapons. In the face of the energy crisis, there was huge interest in building plutonium-powered reactors, which the United States feared could be converted to weapons manufacture. The problem, then, was how the world’s leading nuclear power—the United States— could sell the world on what was then a “wildly unpopular” idea—namely, restricting plutonium sales.13 Nye worked with the Ford Foundation, developed interagency state capacity to draw up guidelines, and coordinated a transnational study group called the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation “to buy time to get people to support the problem.” The eventual outcome was the launch of an International Atomic Energy Agency and a Nuclear Suppliers Group, meant to turn the “bad idea” of restricting plutonium sales into an international norm that the United Nations (UN) would eventually police.14 It was not until 1990, after several years of arguing against American “declinists” who compared Japanese and German prosperity with the United States’ slow economic growth, rusted Fordist industry, giant military expenditures, and mounting budget deficits and national debt, that Nye published his initial formulation of “soft power.” He was especially keen to respond to Paul Kennedy, the Yale historian, who, in his 1987 book The Rise and Fall of Great Powers, had argued masterfully that all empires eventually declined under the weight of their military obligations.15 In Bound to Lead, published just after the Berlin Wall came down, Nye responded that this would not— could not—be the United States’ fate. The problem, as his subtitle indicated, was The Changing Nature of American Power. The United States, in addition to its unsurpassable military power and economic resilience, possessed another kind of clout: the “soft” cultural resources of its democratic heritage. By virtue of this legacy, the United States was “bound” to renew its leadership as the “agenda- setting” power of the world, especially as the bipolar global order disintegrated. Given their lack of military power, Japan and Germany could never be more than “civilian powers” supportive of U.S. global leadership.16 In a 1990 article for Foreign Policy, Nye developed the soft-power theme of Bound to Lead in a winningly formulaic style that harried congressional staffers could quote to their bosses as they rushed through early morning policy briefings. It was true, he said, that, from the 1970s on, the United States had faced significant challenges to its superpower status, including declining economic competitiveness, overextended military budgets, and [ 28 ] V I C T O R I A D E G R A Z I A\n\nthe rise of new cross-national organizations like the OPEC Cartel and new regional powers like Japan and the EU. True, some colleagues thought that American foreign policy should rely more on a multilateral world system, respect Soviet Bloc arrangements, and demilitarize. But neorealist Nye wanted the United States to work with institutions of international governance and preserve its authority as the world’s “unique agenda setting power.” If the United States valorized not only its “hard command,” but also the soft power derived from liberal democracy and the American way of life, the nation could achieve its ends in a cost-effective, prudent, and nonideological way, with none of the redemptive crusader rhetoric employed by Woodrow Wilson (or Ronald Reagan).17 As a historian, I would tax Nye for being too vague about what he meant by soft-power resources. Let’s use Pierre Bourdieu’s notion of cultural capital and agree that the United States had accumulated a huge amount of symbolic wealth, in a way that allowed it to establish the master narrative for what the good society meant in terms of standard of living, technological innovation, consumer freedoms, and so on. If this symbolic capital was exhausted, could it be revived? Or did it have to be reproduced from new sources? Arguably, in the wake of great military victories or civic mobilizations of comparable importance, the United States had time and again reinforced its role as the world’s leading model, thus the original Wilsonian moment coming out of World War I, Roosevelt’s New Deal, and the Four Freedoms mobilizing against the Nazi-Fascist New Order— so, too, the launch of the Marshall Plan at the onset of the Cold War. Without the civil rights movement and the domestic mobilization against American apartheid, the American story of progress could never have responded to the aspirations of anticolonial movements worldwide. In sum, at every moment down to the 1990s, U.S. appeal abroad had been reshaped by social mobilization and reform at home. What old or new forces might be unleashed to mount an equivalent reform for the 1990s and beyond? Nye’s concept of soft power, insofar as it implied a wholesale overhaul of U.S. domestic policy to reposition the United States as a leading model, went nowhere for almost a decade. He ran up against the belief, promoted by pro- and anti-American pundits and political theorists, that, with the triumph of American consumer capitalism over Soviet socialism, the United States could basically rest on its laurels. Now that the barriers were down, market forces would do the rest, or so liberal regime theory in the hands S O F T- P OW E R U. S . V E R S U S N O R M AT I V E P OW E R E U\n\n[ 29 ]\n\nof American liberal pundits—notably Thomas Friedman—contended. The more states converged around the model of liberal capitalist modernity, the less likely they would come into conflict. “No two countries that both have a McDonald’s have ever fought a war against each other,” according to Friedman’s jokey “franchise theory of global conflict prevention.”18 The world had become flat, to recall another of Friedman’s conceits, and the 360-degree CNN eye took in everything twenty-four seven. The Economist developed “Burgernomics,” which used the local cost of the Big Mac to measure global purchasing power parity (PPP) in the face of volatile currencies. UBS developed its “Big Mac Index” to calculate local labor costs by pricing the time it took the worker to purchase one juicy hamburger with all of the trimmings. Walmart heading into China had no need of Uncle Sam as its political effigy when it had the avuncular “Papa” Sam Walton. On the other hand, Nye had to contend with American cultural pessimists. American materialism, its technological culture, and secular values were generating a huge backlash globally, generating conflicts among peoples that were more and more defined along civilizational and tribal lines. The progressive version came from Benjamin Barber. In his “Jihad vs. McWorld” (the article in 1992, the book in 1995), he argued that the only way to counter the mounting reaction was to forge a global democratic civic culture, drawing on American democratic solidaristic European cultures. The conservative version came in Samuel P. Huntington’s “Clash of Civilizations” (the article in 1993, the book in 1996), arguing that the West’s diffusion of valueless technology had debased its own humanistic culture and created an intractable antagonism in others, especially in the Muslim world. To defend the West involved a more farsighted, powerful military strategy and a more muscular, Christianized Americanism. In Washington, the path to foreign policy reform passes through the national security community. Having served in the Clinton administration (1994–1995) as assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, Nye understood that the Pentagon was a better lobby for new strategies than the State Department. Both departments needed to overhaul operating systems conceived in the early Cold War, when Eastern Europe was the main confrontation site and anticommunist radio information cum propaganda broadcasts were the main weapons. It was true that the military had more resources. It was also under strong pressure from neoconservatives to eliminate its “socialistic” giant bureaucratic apparatus, pursue [ 30 ] V I C T O R I A D E G R A Z I A\n\ncybernetic weapons systems, and outsource operations to private contractors. Historically, U.S. public diplomacy had always revved up in view of new military missions, starting from its first iteration during World War I in the Creel Commission. Conceivably, then, the Pentagon would be more receptive than the State Department.19 So it happened in the 1990s. As American troops were moved from western Europe into Russian-border states, they were tasked with the work of the diplomatic corps, whose arrival awaited the cessation of civil conflicts. Embracing the notion of the Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA), the military pushed ahead in cybertechnology, and, as it reorganized its bases abroad—moving from Europe to monitor the ex-Soviet space, the Horn of Africa, and the Indian Ocean—it developed its lily pad (as opposed to large footprint) style of small, numerous, flexibly organized, and closely networked bases.20 Arguably, the military establishment was in closer touch than the State Department with both foreign civil societies and U.S. domestic politics and could thus make a stronger claim than any other government bureaucracy for connecting the real United States (of democracy, upward mobility, and curiosity about the world) with foreign worlds. At home, it recruited, educated, and promoted a more socially and culturally diverse America, including people of color, and, unlike the State Department, it permitted them at their often early retirement to work in think tanks, teach in war colleges, and hold corporate consultancies, offering conduits for connection that were lacking in civilian administration. Perhaps also calculating that Congress would be more inclined to appropriate funds if soft power was shown to be efficient in military-security terms, in 1995–1996 Nye teamed up with Admiral William A. Owens, vicechairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to endorse the soft-power turn on military-technocratic grounds. Their Foreign Affairs article “America’s Information Edge” argued for piggybacking on the American-led cybernetic revolution to put U.S. global hegemony on a new footing militarily, culturally, and diplomatically.21 The so-called information edge was the perfect neoliberal invention. Militarily, it promised to transform the statebureaucratic, materièl-heavy mass army into a pared-down, flexible fighting force operating with precision, speed, and range. In terms of communications, the cyber revolution promised to establish an “information umbrella” as effective as the “nuclear umbrella;” it would enable the United States to share its “dominant situational knowledge” with “a wide range of friends, allies, and neutral nations.”22 Able to distinguish friend from S O F T- P OW E R U. S . V E R S U S N O R M AT I V E P OW E R E U\n\n[ 31 ]\n\nfoe in the face of the ever-more complicated alignments of the post– Cold War era, this umbrella would isolate and sanction rogue states like Iraq. At the same time, it would prepare the way for “people to build market societies when the opportunities arise.”23 In this technocratic formulation, there was no mention of the revival of the United States’ legacy of good values, democratic beliefs, or civic culture, nor of the Marshall plans being discussed at the time in Western Europe to salvage and restructure postSoviet bloc economies. In effect, the Nye-Owens article conceived the United States as having such a huge “information edge” at that moment that, as long as its incipient regulation favored American interests, it was suffused with democratic, open society values. If Congress and foreign policy–makers gave it its due place in the overhaul of foreign policy, as Nye and Owens concluded, “the 21st century (would) be the period of America’s greatest preeminence, not the 20th.”24 However, the desire to reap the peace dividend resulted not in the reform of the apparatus of public diplomacy so much as the bipartisan decision to downsize it. In 1998, a new Under Secretariat of Diplomacy and Public Affairs (sometimes called Press and Public Diplomacy) was established within the State Department and charged with bringing it up to date with new information technologies and using them to support cultural programs. But, between 1993 and 2001, government funding for information programs and educational and cultural exchanges declined by approximately one-third, and in 1999 the entity most responsible for public diplomacy, the United States Information Agency, was dismantled and absorbed into the very different bureaucratic culture of the State Department. By 2001, academic and cultural exchanges had shrunk from 45,000 to 29,000 annually. The State Department was pensioning off its aging Soviet experts, but had yet to hire Arabic speakers.25 Having returned to Cambridge in 1995 to take up the deanship of Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government, Nye thrust himself into national domestic affairs to explain the terrible loss of trust in government that had led Gulf War veteran Timothy McVeigh to bomb the federal office building in Oklahoma City that year. Dismayed at seeing President Clinton capitulate to domestic critics by withholding U.S. support for the World Trade Organization accords at the G8’s bumptious Seattle meeting, Nye came back to soft power in late 1999, writing an impassioned op-ed for the New York Times to enjoin Republican candidates—who were outdoing each another urging isolation and increased military spending— to [ 32 ] V I C T O R I A D E G R A Z I A\n\nremember that their idol Ronald Reagan had championed soft power. Soft power, Nye reminded them, “is our ability to get what we want through attraction rather than coercion.” He pointed out once more that, “when other countries want the same outcome we want, then we can get what we want without having to spend as much on coercion.” He insisted again on the importance of both dimensions of power, hard and soft, and explained that “they work best when they reinforce each other.” Rather timidly, as if not to inject too partisan a note into national security questions, he aligned himself with the Democratic party agenda to argue that “the quality of our domestic life—prosperity, social safety nets, equal access to justice, democratic elections—has a strong impact on our international position.”26 As a foreign policy realist, Nye was not arguing that U.S. global leadership depended first and foremost on its capacity to be a model both materially and ideally; that idea was left to constructivist IR theorists or Gramscian critics of U.S. hegemonic pretentions. But he was surely speaking to Harvard colleagues like Robert Putnam, whose book Bowling Alone: America’s Declining Social Capital (1995) registered the dwindling of Middle American civil society in the face of the crisis of great corporate employers like IBM and General Motors and the consequent social and cultural fragmentation of middle-class life. As much as restoring social justice at home, Nye wanted to restore America’s social honor abroad. Transparency was an age-old American liberal virtue. If the United States didn’t want to be seen as hypocritical, he said, the United States had to practice at home what it preached abroad— democracy, human rights, and social justice.\n\nEurope’s Turn Whereas the conceptualization of soft power was bound up with the evolution in the discipline of international relations at its highest academic level at the most elite American universities at the acme of postwar U.S. power, the conceptualization of normative power was built on a critique of the American version of the discipline mounted by a new trans-European middle class, almost all with positions in public universities, trying to reclaim a European voice in the EU and world affairs. While this endeavor dates to the 1970s, if not earlier, the momentum to define the EU as a repository of deeply held European beliefs and values grew over the 1990s. This S O F T- P OW E R U. S . V E R S U S N O R M AT I V E P OW E R E U\n\n[ 33 ]\n\nmomentum reflected the effort to compensate for what was called the democratic deficit in representative institutions, to make the EU less technocratic and more the sum of the concerns and interests of its citizenry. It was also part of the effort to confront the civil war and NATO intervention in Yugoslavia and give the EU more capabilities as an international actor. This trend accelerated with the Maastricht Treaty (1992), and gathered more momentum with the adoption of the single currency (2002). Ian Manners was teaching European studies at the University of Kent in 2002 when he published his first article on normative power. The milieu surely favored it: founded in 1965, the university had come back from the Thatcher-era cuts to higher education and repositioned itself in the 1990s as the most globally engaged institution of higher education in the British public system. Moreover, Manners was in the School of International Relations, a hotbed of critical security studies, Gramscian cultural critiques, and debates about the only real alternative to America’s hard-nosed and increasingly scientized realist international relations, the “English school,” identified with Australian-born Oxonian, Hedley Bull, heir to the historian of international relations, E. H. Carr.27 Manners’s decision to publish this first piece in the Journal of Common Market Studies was strategic— founded in May 1962, it was the oldest of the academic periodicals dedicated to studying European integration, born out of British academics’ deep curiosity about the European Community when Britain’s entry, though much debated, seemed near, until Charles de Gaulle vetoed it. The editors expected contributions to be nonpartisan in the British sense, meaning that their authors either announced their biases or cut out the parts that showed them too blatantly.28 Manners was straightforward about his. He wanted to repudiate Hedley Bull’s realism. The idea that an integrated Europe could present itself as a “civilian power” on the world stage was a “contradiction in terms,” Bull had insisted in 1982 in the Journal of Common Market History.29 The European Community might have defied both the well-known anarchy of the international system and historical good sense, but, short of having real military capabilities, it could not be a leading power. Bull’s primary target was Franco-British Europhile Francois Duchêne and his idealization of Europe as a “civilian power.”30 A former aide to Jean Monnet, Duchêne had advanced this idea on the fifteenth anniversary of the Treaty of Rome. 1972 was a good year for Europhiles: under German leadership, Western Europe was coping with Nixon’s devaluation [ 34 ] V I C T O R I A D E G R A Z I A\n\nof the dollar, and any plans to cut off oil to Europe if it joined the United States in supporting Israel in the event of war was still only a glimmer in OPEC’s eyes. Britain was entering the EU, and Charles De Gaulle’s “grand design” and the German Federal Republic’s Ostpolitik or “opening to the East” still held the promise of opening a third way between the superpowers. None of this convinced Bull, however. If the new Europe wanted to be an independent power, then it should develop a military force. Lacking one, the European Community could not pursue an independent course of action while the Reagan administration was reigniting the Cold War with the Soviet Union. If it remained Atlanticist, it was subordinated to the United States; if it turned neutralist, it risked subordination to the USSR. In the next half-decade, Bull’s— and British liberal skepticism—would be challenged from the Continent from the perspective of European capitalism and commerce. The first writer to speak of Europe as a normative power was American political scientist Richard Rosecrance, whose 1986 The Rise of the Trading State had spoken of the open trading system spearheaded by the German Federal Republic and Japan as a civilizing force, a contrast to the atavistic Hobbesian vision of the world ingrained in the U.S.-Soviet rivalry and revived under the presidency of Ronald Reagan.31 The notion that Europe, with its mixed capitalist economy and relatively good growth rates, could replace the United States as global economic leader dated back to British economist Andrew Shonfield’s impressive 1966 book, Modern Capitalism: The Changing Balance of Public and Private Power. This aspiration was given new currency in the wake of the dissolution of the Soviet bloc, as Europeans saw Europe, not the United States, as having held out the hope of human rights to the Soviet bloc nations. The victorious capitalist model was not the Washington Consensus with its primitive view of markets, short-term profit-taking, and indifference to societal cohesion, but, rather, as French economist Michel Albert argued, the crossnationally coordinated social market economies of “Rhineland Europe.”32 With their focus on societal consensus, an active state, and a long-term orientation, these economies had outperformed the United States on most socioeconomic indicators. It was the European standard of living—the combination of European style craft and mass goods, welfare state rights, and decent wages, not the American model of ever-cheaper mass goods, made in Asia and financed for the poor by cheap credit and huge trade deficits with China—that was the new Europe-wide standard. Europe’s big brands S O F T- P OW E R U. S . V E R S U S N O R M AT I V E P OW E R E U\n\n[ 35 ]\n\nlike Carrefour, Ikea, Parmalat, and Benetton saw themselves as post-Fordist and more competitive and innovative than equivalent U.S. firms. The breakup of the Soviet bloc forced Europeans to rethink foreign and security policy. First, there was the old German problem. It had been fine to theorize the German Federal Republic as the foremost European “civilian” power, to recall Rosecrance’s idealization of the German trading state, or to think of it as the pillar of NATO and Atlantic Alliance, as the Americans wanted. But, once the Federal German Republic had annexed the German Democratic Republic and united Germany acquired complete sovereignty in foreign and military affairs, the pressure was on to find new ways to reanchor it within the EU. Nobody wanted this rich, centrally positioned, and once-again-giant state to grow its power with respect to the post-Soviet states or favor the United States’ unipolar worldview. Another issue was what to do with the new Europe of the post-Soviet space: the nations of the Warsaw Treaty and Yugoslavia and former Soviet imperial dependencies like Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia and the Russian Confederation. Should Europeans embrace the Europe that not just Mikhail Gorbachev but many European socialists longed for, one that stretched from the Atlantic to the Urals? Should they create the European unity that the Cold War had forestalled in 1947? Before this could be answered, the urgent crisis in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had to be addressed. Arguably, no issue was more important to testing— and reinforcing—Europe’s desire for a foreign policy of its own. (And none, I will argue, would prove more important to reinforcing Europe’s development as a normative power). Suffice it to say that the EU stumbled in the face of its first post– Cold War foreign policy crisis. As the Yugoslavian conflict unfolded, Germany distanced itself from France and Britain’s hope of preserving the status quo, by encouraging the Croatian and Slovenian claims to independence that pitched the federation into a decade of civil conflict. Germany’s normative thinking on the matter could be characterized as rich and tragically overdetermined: there was the old imperialist Germany, acting out of sympathy for Croatia, its one-time protectorate; and there was so-called good nationalism of united Germany, wanting to demonstrate that its annexation of East Germany was an act of self-determination, not occupation, by supporting another European people’s human right; and there was the deep well of anticommunism that said that self- determination was especially important in the face of communist masters, meaning the Belgrade Serbs. [ 36 ] V I C T O R I A D E G R A Z I A\n\nHowever German rationales were understood, the FRG’s horrific bungle upped the pressure to generate a shared understanding of united Europe as a foreign policy actor. In the face of these challenges, the EU needed a foreign policy narrative. International relations as practiced by American social sciences had focused mainly on the nation-state, and the best and brightest of Keohane’s and Nye’s students, notably Andrew Moravscik, was painfully ahistorical even when proposing a historical account. If the EU was going to reject soulless American political science’s view that the “EU is best seen as an international regime for policy coordination,” it needed a narrative that was both historical and comparative, with a keen eye for member states’ peculiarities and affinities even as it created a plausible history of their convergence.33 Manners’s circle addressed the Europeanists’ need for a European account of the evolution of the EU on two levels. It built on the English School of International Relations’ interest in solidarist international norms, international law, and human rights by integrating into European studies the study of norms that, across the Atlantic, along with the work of Martha Finnemore and Kathryn Sikkink, had led sociologist Ann Florini to publish “The Evolution of International Norms” in 1996.34 And it collaborated on group projects like the volume Manners coedited with his University of Manchester colleague Richard Whitman to study the differences between, as well as the eventual convergences among, European member states’ foreign policies as they evolved in the wake of the Cold War.35 This work became an important political as well as scientific project. The more political elites spoke of their commitment to a Federal Europe and the importance of the European social model in resisting global market forces, the more they recognized that the EU needed a stronger cultural integration. Cultural heft would compensate for its institutional democratic deficit. A stronger cultural identity would offset the evermore-present Americanization in media and the cyberworld. It would help express the European liberal secularist beliefs and humanistic values that would counter Islamic fundamentalism. The second half of the 1990s was thus a godsend for academics and public intellectuals, as universities mobilized, with the EU supporting projects on Euro-identity and Erasmus student exchanges sending tens of thousands of students abroad for a year of schooling. S O F T- P OW E R U. S . V E R S U S N O R M AT I V E P OW E R E U\n\n[ 37 ]\n\nWhen Manners responded to Bull’s position in 2002, two decades after Bull had formulated it, he was thus in a solid position. In five decades of peaceful negotiations over rules, regulations, and norms, the EU had become a sovereign entity. More than that, it had become the de facto leader of the post-Westphalian world order. Insisting on the EU as “postWestphalian” let Manners make two points. The first was that all conventional IR theory started from the premise that the modern international order rested on the peace agreement signed by the belligerents at Westphalia ending the thirty-year religious wars of the first half of the seventeenth century. The pact stipulated that the sovereigns would cease interfering with each other’s religious practices and henceforth respect one another’s autonomy, equality before international covenants, and freedom from intervention. The second point was that the European Community, in becoming the EU, had turned its back on the balance-of-power and great-power politics that had devastated the continent and the world. For its negotiators to succeed in constituting a post- state entity, they had to operate according to shared values, practices, and rules within the framework of the post–World War II institutions, treaties, and conventions that stipulated them, including the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Helsinki Final Act, and the Charter of Paris. Having managed to constitute itself without force of arms, the EU was uniquely positioned to persuade other states and international entities to do the same.36 How distant, then, was Manners from Nye. Nye had never questioned the basic realist premises that the world was anarchic, that sovereign states were the basic unit of action, and that there was a hierarchy among them based on measures like gross national product and military power. From that perspective, soft power was another weapon. Constructivist Manners, by contrast, saw human interactions as shaping the world. The European Community had negotiated itself into existence via the ideals of the rule of law, human rights, social solidarity, and gender equality, as well as safeguarding the environment, cultural diversity, and privacy, to name a few. These norms, in turn, interacted with the same complex interdependency (as Keohane and Nye called it) being evolved by the UN and other international institutions and positioned New Europe to sustain a new global culture of norms. From this vantage point, Manners could fend off two groups of critics: the Marxists, who argued that normative power was just a jargony way to sanitize Europe’s inveterate imperialism; and the realists, [ 38 ] V I C T O R I A D E G R A Z I A\n\nwho said that Europe boasted of its normative capabilities to compensate for, and excuse, its lack of military might. Meanwhile, Romano Prodi’s term as the EU’s first “prime minister” (i.e., the first president of the European Commission), from 1999 to 2004, brought legitimacy to this normative vision. Elected in 1999 with the support of both conservatives and socialists, the one-time Christian Democrat turned Euro- communist was a Catholic in the spirit of the founding fathers (Alcide De Gaspari, Konrad Adenauer, et alia) and a social democrat in the tradition of Jacques Delors. Along with brokering the adoption of the euro in 2002, joining his voice to the many who hailed monetary unification as an act of idealism, Prodi oversaw the “big bang” eastward enlargement in 2004. From late April of that year, on a political tour of the region that started at Trieste and ended at Strasbourg, he told audiences how the EU’s quick response to the Soviet collapse had unified Europe, transforming the Europe divided by the Iron Curtain from Stettin on the Baltic to Trieste on the Adriatic into one unified from Tallinn to Valletta. Prodi also paid tribute to the citizens of the union for “developing market economies and open and democratic societies that meet the high standards we laid down in 1993,” meaning the Copenhagen meetings where the EU partners established strict EU entrance requirements. He implicitly compared Europe to the United States: “Our vision of integration has exerted an extraordinary power of attraction on neighboring countries. . . . We enjoy the peaceful rule of law. That means peace and dialogue, something the world today badly needs. It means the protection and defense of social rights and the rights of the individual. In the new world order dominated by a single superpower and the dynamics of globalization, our future depends on our ability to remain united.”37 On May 5, in the last speech of his tenure, he told the European Commission that the EU would seek “to extend to the whole of Europe the model of peace, democracy and prosperity that are the hallmarks of the Union” and “to promote across the world its model for managing relations between countries,” which he called a “practical response to the deteriorating intern"
