        "text": "Mobile, ad hoc teams are an increasingly common form of collaboration. Workers in such teams often are involved in several highly information-intensive projects. They work with people in several organizations, on short-term, goal-oriented tasks. Most of todayâ€™s information technology-based tools have been developed to support traditional, static, project-oriented teams. The support of mobile, ad-hoc collaboration offers many challenges to tool developers. The paper considers the application of pervasive computing services to the problem. The paper is speculative, but, I hope, stimulating."
