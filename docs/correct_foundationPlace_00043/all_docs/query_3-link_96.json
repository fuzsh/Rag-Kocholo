        "text": "Embodiment\n\nBelow in conjunction with accompanying drawing, the present invention is described further, software architecture of the present invention as shown in Figure 3, in framework, each Agent does not carry out direct interaction with Environment, each Agent is placed in corresponding Agent Slots, Agent Slots and Environment carry out alternately, receive perception information, and sending action information.\n\nIn this software architecture, an Agent Slots process of each equipment operation, according to the power of equipment operational performance, the calculating Agent that can load right quantity enters.As Agent Slots 0 has n Agent.Because the operating system of some general fit calculation equipment is not supported multi-process (as uCLinux), so generally, each Agent is the sub-thread being created by corresponding Agent Slots host process.And multithreading can allow the Agent under same Slots share more easily data.Except multithreading, the strategy that can also adopt each Agent to carry out in turn, first Agent 01 obtains its perception information, then calculates, then returns to an action.Then to Agent 02, obtain perception information ... carry out so in turn.\n\nEach Agent is by the result of thinking, and the action returned (Action Channel) is passed to ActionManager.Unified management is carried out in the action that Action Manager is responsible for each Agent to return, and then to Environment, sends all action messages.The action of Action Manager is according to different application systems and different, in general, Action Manager need to record the correspondence person of sending of the clear action receiving, and in sending to the action message of Environment, adds sender's mark, as Action01 etc.\n\nEach Agent Slots receives the perception information of corresponding A gent quantity from Environment, after reception information through the processing of Sense Manager, then according under perception information (Sense Channel), be forwarded to each corresponding Agent.Sense Manager can also preserve some public informations, offers each Agent share and access (for example a football match, competes the remaining time, and current ratio grading information can become the information of sharing and be kept in Sense Manager).Sense Manager and ActionManager are the processing modules of a pair of antithesis.\n\nThe present invention is also provided with manual control module Manual Agent.Manual Agent is different from other Agent, and its major function is to receive user's input, rather than autonomous thinking.\n\nBecause the action of artificial input can be different from the action that common Agent exports, for example people's incoming frequency generally can calculate lower than common Agent the frequency of action, in addition, be different from common Agent output microcosmic action (can allow realize combination of actions more flexible), artificial input is generally more prone to action in macroscopic concept (as in football game is controlled, user can be more prone to input the instruction of a dribble, and can not go to be concerned about how to move, how to football, to play gently this compared with the operation of microcosmic), so also increased Action Transform module in framework, this module is responsible for user's molar behavior to translate into a series of microcosmic action, and according to the frequency of common Agent, to Action Manager sending action information.Through after Action transform resume module, the action message that Action Manager is received and the action message of common Agent are unified, and Action transform has shielded the difference between Manual Agent and common Agent.\n\nSometimes user need to observe the ruuning situation of whole system or some Agent.And when needs are manually operated, operational process must be shown.Display is exactly for showing the module of operational process.In general, display module can show according to the perception information receiving.\n\nApplication of the present invention as shown in Figure 4, is the artificial intelligence teaching type software under a general fit calculation Environment developing based on above-mentioned framework, AI Eleven.User can write several football sportsmans' intelligence according to given interface, or by keyboard operation, controls some sportsmen.By internet, a plurality of users can form Yi Ge team jointly, and other teams on network play.AI Eleven provides the standard client operating on PC, and operates in the simple version client on mobile phone or PDA.But no matter be any client, can carry out interconnected match, user can be participated in into whenever and wherever possible.\n\nAI Eleven describes and constructs the framework of its software based on ADL, and realizes above framework at this.Thereby can reach the capable of dynamic configuration of Agent,, on different hardware platforms, can move and make several intelligent Agents that close its performance, then jointly complete this system object of a football match.Following table has been set forth the system architecture of AI Eleven and the corresponding relation that Wright/ADL describes, and the function of module.\n\nThrough the corresponding relation with each assembly foundation of Wright/ADL, can very clearly develop the software architecture of AI Eleven.In each client, move a Gamer (CAgentSlot) host process, the intelligent program that each Football Player (CAgent) representative of consumer of settling imports in Gamer.And Controller (CManualAgent) has realized the input function of user's operation.\n\nIn Environment, adopted ODE physical model to carry out the emulation of court state.In Environment, safeguarding a time manager, an emulation cycle of every mistake (0.1s) sends the perception information in court to the Football Player (CAgent) in all matches.And receive the action message after each Football Player thinking, the transmission of information is to carry out between Virtual Environment and Gamer (CAgentSlot), by the Actioner (CActionManager) of Agent Slots, Sensor (CSenseManager) manages.After all action messages receive, carry out ODE physical simulation, thereby draw the new court state in next emulation cycle, so circulation.\n\nFor the basic Action in AI Eleven, provide Kick (float Power, float Theta), two kinds of basic interfaces of Drive (Vector Power).These two operations that basic interface is microcosmic, are suitable for the Football Player that programming realizes, because realize out combination of actions more flexibly can allow like this user program time.But these microcosmic actions are not easy to user and directly control.So the several macrotechniques that can directly come into contacts with user are provided, as Pass, Shoot, Dribble operation, after Controller Adatper (CActionTransform) module, change into the combination of microtechnique, be sent in Actioner (CActionManager).\n\nThe benefit that the software architecture that AI Eleven has utilized the present invention to propose is fully brought.First, each client can be moved sportsman's intelligence of suitable number, and device resource effectively utilizes.Secondly, user controls and can be integrated into simply in system, has increased the dirigibility of system, and operability has fully demonstrated the advantage of framework on man-machine interaction cooperation.Have again, because display module is independently, thereby can according to different equipment, select a kind of applicable display technique easily.In addition, for the public information of football match in game, as ball match excess time, score, sportsman's current location, the current location of ball, and the common data of court specification etc. can be reached in same equipment and be shared between a plurality of Agent by Sense Manager, saving resource.\n\nSoftware architecture of the present invention is compared with traditional software, on to the adaptation of general fit calculation Environment feature, has obvious superiority.First be embodied in the adaptability of general fit calculation equipment, for the larger various general fit calculation equipment of system performance diversity ratio, this framework is more optimized in the utilization of device resource.Deviser can design the Agent of lightweight, the upper operation of the equipment relatively lacking in resource (as PDA, mobile phone etc.), and for the relatively sufficient equipment (as laptop computer) of resource, can move a plurality of Agent.Thereby reach the reasonable utilization of resource, use equipment still less just can reach the computing object of expection.\n\nIn this framework, display layer is a module independently, and the input of this module is the perception information of scene information or certain Agent.And the output of module can be used different display techniques according to equipment Graphics Processing ability, also embody the adaptation of this framework to general fit calculation device diversity.\n\nIn addition, the software architecture that the present invention proposes has increased manually operated Agent module, allow this framework have more dirigibility, adapt to more many application (especially for the game under general fit calculation Environment, or the application in the man-machine interaction cooperation field such as Industry Control).And owing to having used Agent Slots to carry out the centralized management of Agent, public resource shared convenient, the storage resources of saving equipment, and can be optimized belonging to communication between the Agent in same Agent Slots, the Internet resources of equipment saved."
