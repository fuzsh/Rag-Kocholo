        "text": "Products that include Apache Hadoop or derivative works and Commercial Support\n\nThe following companies provide products that include Apache Hadoop, a derivative work thereof, commercial support, and/or tools and utilities related to Hadoop.\n\nPlease see Defining Hadoop to see the Apache Hadoop's project's copyright, naming, trademark and compatibility policies.\n\nThis listing is provided as a reference only. No endorsements are given or implied.\n\nThe sole products that can be called a release of Apache Hadoop come from apache.org. Some companies release or sell products that include the official Apache Hadoop release files, and/or their own and other useful tools. Other companies or organizations release products that include artifacts build from modified or extended versions of the Apache Hadoop source tree. Such derivative works are not supported by the Apache Team: all support issues must be directed to the suppliers themselves.\n\nThe Apache Software Foundation strongly encourages users of Hadoop —in any form— to get involved in the Apache-hosted mailing lists. Even though you may only get support through the supplier of any derivative work of Apache Hadoop, by participating in the Hadoop user and developer lists, you can become an active part of the Hadoop community. Your needs may be addressed in future versions of the code, and you will be able to get in touch with many other users of the technology.\n\nThe Hadoop developers would like you to be aware that filing JIRA issues is not a way to get support to get your Hadoop installation up and running. Those bug reports are not bugs, and will be closed as invalid. Either use the hadoop-user mailing list, the organisations providing support listed below, or delve into the Hadoop source itself.\n\nEntries are listed alphabetically by company name."
