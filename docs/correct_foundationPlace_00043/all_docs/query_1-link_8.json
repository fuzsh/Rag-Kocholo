        "text": "AUSTIN, SXSW 2011 – Two leading non-profit news organizations will develop a free, open-source publishing platform to help other online news organizations more easily engage with readers, manage content and raise revenue, thanks to a grant from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.\n\nThe Texas Tribune in Austin and The Bay Citizen in San Francisco, both non-profit online journalism organizations covering regional civic news, will share the $975,000 grant and will co-develop the new open source platform.\n\nDozens of local online news organizations now exist, many of which launched within the last year. At the first Knight Foundation gathering of these news start-ups in Austin last spring, organizations revealed their struggles to find a publishing platform that is low-cost to implement, while flexible enough to allow constant innovation in content delivery, audience engagement and fundraising.\n\nThe Bay Citizen and The Texas Tribune, both known for quality journalism and strong investment in technology, were passionate about working together to develop an open-source software platform to freely share with the rest of the online news industry.\n\nThe grant is Knight Foundation’s latest effort to nurture innovation in the media field. Recently, the foundation launched the Knight News Innovation Laboratory at Northwestern University to speed media innovation in Chicago and beyond, as well as the Knight-Mozilla News Technology Fellowships to open-source solutions to technical problems at news organizations.\n\n“We hope this platform will help other online news start-ups stay technologically nimble and offer them a better opportunity to publish content and engage with their communities,” said John S. Bracken, Knight Foundation digital media director.\n\n“Knight Foundation’s generous support of technological innovation creates a bright future for online news organizations,” said The Bay Citizen’s CTO Brian Kelley. “Organizations will no longer be faced with the cost and expense of developing their own publishing platforms from the ground up, or tied to using systems that were not meant for online news. And, as an open source initiative, this will be a collaborative effort that engages developers, journalists and editors from all over the country to actively participate in ongoing development and enhancement.”\n\n“The technology team at The Texas Tribune has been working hard with the team at The Bay Citizen over the last year to create a single platform for high-functioning, demanding newsrooms,” said Founding CTO of The Texas Tribune Higinio Maycotte. “We are excited to develop what hopefully becomes a technology ‘blueprint’ for sustainable newsrooms and share it with the rest of the news industry so that online journalism can continue to find its way to readers that seek it.”\n\nThe new open-source publishing platform will:\n\nManage an integrated library of text, video and audio files;\n\nMaximize search engine optimization by improving the way articles are linked, aggregated and tagged;\n\nBetter integrate sites with social networks like Facebook and Twitter as well as bloggers; and\n\nOffer membership tools and integration with advertising networks to help online news organizations cultivate new revenue streams.\n\nThe Bay Citizen and The Texas Tribune are actively seeking partners for the initial release later this year. To find out more about how to participate or become a partner, please contact:\n\nBrian Kelley, Bay Citizen CTO; [email protected]\n\nHiginio Maycotte, Texas Tribune Founding CTO; [email protected]\n\nAbout the John S. and James L.
