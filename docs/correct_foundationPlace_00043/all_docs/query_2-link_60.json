        "text": "Pervasive computing is concerned with making our lives easier through digital environments that are sensitive, adaptive, and responsive to human needs. Different approaches have shown the suitability of the agent paradigm for the development of pervasive applications. However, so far no dominant approach has been adopted for the development of agent-based pervasive systems. In particular, two key classes of approaches exist, based on FIPA interaction protocols and tuple spaces. The contribution of this paper is the comparison and evaluation of tuple spaces and FIPA-compliant coordination mechanisms for the development of pervasive applications. We are therefore going to compare two approaches that exemplify these agent technologies: MalacaTiny-Sol and SAPERE."
