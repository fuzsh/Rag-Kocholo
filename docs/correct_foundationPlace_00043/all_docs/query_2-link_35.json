        "text": "We upgraded Sage 300 CRE Accounting from 9.7 to 13.1 a month ago and are also experiencing problems with the Pervasive Pre-Load not always starting up when PCs are restarted. Sometimes it starts and sometimes it doesn't. The problem seems to wander around the Payroll office cubes. We are at Update 5 (2013 year end upate). We know that Update 5 incorporates 'critical patching for Pervasive Licensing' in Update 1. Puzzlingly, we also get occasional repetition of the 'key activation' messages from the Pervasive Notification Viewer.\n\nThis morning, I responded to a help request from our Payroll Chief on Pre-Load launch failure at her PC. While investigating, after a reboot and not seeing the blue-green Pervasive Database - Pre-Load icon on the task bar, I ran Task Manager where I found McAfee on-access security scanner and w3dbsmgr.exe both gobbling CPU without end, until I rebooted again.\n\nWe have long known that the server side processes of Pervasive DB tend to spin the CPU after virus scanning of the DB, but this is first time we've detected what may be conflict between PC antivirus and Pervasive.\n\nHello Shane, when reinstalling Pervasive you may want to try installing it as a service from the prerequisites folder. Before the reinstall you should delete all leftover relevant folders and registry keys.\n\nFor uninstalling -\n\nMake sure all users are out of Sage if you are uninstalling on the server.\n\nGo to Programs and Features, uninstall Pervasive\n\nDelete these folders if they didn't already uninstall:\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\Pervasive Software\n\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Pervasive Software\n\nGo to Regedit.exe and check for a left over Pervasive registry key in this location and delete it: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Pervasive Software\n\nTo reinstall as a service (and you may want to go with the server install as a service on the workstaiton estimating sometimes prefers that, it runs fine as it would on the server)\n\nFor a Sage 300 CRE workstation on a non-server operating system such as Windows 7 (32-bit or 64-bit), install the PSQL v11 Workgroup Engine\n\n1.Pre PSQL Install\n\n2.PrePSQLInstall.exe\n\n3.Runs silently, you will not be able to see when it completes but you can monitor in Task Manager\n\n4.Pervasive PSQL v11 Workgroup as Service\n\n5.SetupWorkgroup_x86.exe\n\n6. Select Run as Service\n\n7. Pervasive PSQL v11 Workgroup Patch (x86)\n\n8. PSQLv11Patch_WGE_x86.msp\n\n9. Post PSQL Install\n\n10. PostPSQLInstall.exe\n\n11. Runs silently, you will not be able to see when it completes but you can monitor in Task Manager\n\nFor a Sage 300 CRE file server, such as Windows 2008 R2 (32-bit) or any 32-bit computer with Sage Estimating (regardless of operating system), install the Pervasive PSQL v11 Server Edition (x86)\n\n1.Pre PSQL Install\n\n2.PrePSQLInstall.exe\n\n3. Runs silently, you will not be able to see when it completes but you can monitor in Task Manager\n\n4. Pervasive PSQL v11 Server Edition (x86)\n\n5. SetupServer_x86.exe\n\n6.
