        "text": "The Master of Science in Software Engineering (MS SE) through the Computer Science department is intended to give the graduate a firm foundation in the definition, development and maintenance of complex software systems using traditional engineering process methods.\n\nThe degree plan specifies information, such as in the case of the master's thesis plan: the Thesis Advisory Committee, the title of the thesis, and the courses to be taken. The graduate school requires the degree plan to be submitted during the first semester of study. It also serves as the application for Admission to Candidacy. See the Undergraduate & Graduate Catalog for further details about the requirements for Admission to Candidacy.\n\nFor the thesis plan, students should make every effort to find a Thesis Advisor in an area of research compatible with their interests as soon as possible. Thesis Advisors may require students to take certain courses in order to prepare the student for research; therefore, students should allow the Thesis Advisor to assist in the selection of courses for their degree plan.\n\nMinor courses are, in general, not allowed in the degree plan of the non−thesis plan, but are allowed on a limited basis in the degree plan of the thesis plan, as long as those courses would support the student's research. No minor courses will be counted if an equivalent computer science course exists. Please see the Undergraduate & Graduate Catalog for the details of minors at the master's level. Please see the Graduate Advisor for minor course degree plan approval before taking the minor courses.\n\nIf a student switches from the thesis to the non−thesis plan, then any CS 6000 or possibly CS 7000 courses taken will be lost and not included on the non−thesis degree plan.\n\nThe degree plan may be modified later by filling out the degree plan change form. Any changes should be submitted before the graduation semester.\n\nAll requirements for all degree plans must be completed within a period of 6 years.\n\nLeveling Requirements\n\nStudents who do not hold a bachelor's or master's degree in computer science or a related field may be required to complete undergraduate leveling work.\n\nWithout mathematics background\n\nStatistics\n\nCalculus I\n\nDiscrete Math\n\nData Structures\n\nAlgorithm Analysis\n\nOperating Systems OR Computer Architecture\n\nWith mathematics background\n\nData Structures\n\nAlgorithm Analysis\n\nOperating Systems OR Computer Architecture\n\nDegree Requirements\n\nStudents in the MS SE program are subject to all Master's Degree regulations as outlined in the Graduate Catalog.\n\nThe Curriculum\n\nThe degree plan for students pursuing a MS SE degree must include the following courses:\n\nCS 5363 Software Project Management\n\nCS 5373 Software Modeling and Architecture\n\nCS 5374 Software Verification and Validation\n\nIn addition, students select electives from the following categories:\n\nSE Electives\n\nCS 5332 Special Topics in Software Engineering\n\nCS 5355 Real Time and Time Sharing Systems\n\nCS 5377 Distributed SystemsCS 5379 Parallel Processors and Processing\n\nCS 5380 Fault-Tolerant Computer Systems\n\nIE 5320 Systems TheoryOther Software Engineering electives\n\nComputer Science Electives\n\nCS Graduate courses\n\nStudents must take five courses from the SE electives and four courses from the CS electives. As non-thesis students, distance students cannot apply CS 6000 or CS 7000 toward their degrees. In addition, students must pass a written comprehensive examination near the end of their studies.\n\nFor More Information\n\nPlease visit the Master of Science in Software Engineering Department website\n\nThe graduate advisor for the Computer Science department is Jeannette Diaz.\n\nIf you have questions about the degree program, please contact him:\n\nJeannette Diaz | Graduate Chief Academic Advisor\n\nTexas Tech University | Computer Science\n\nMS 43104 | Lubbock, TX 79409-3104"
