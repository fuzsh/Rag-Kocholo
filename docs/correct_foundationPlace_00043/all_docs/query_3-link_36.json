        "text": "Abstract\n\nIn the near future, the \"computer\" as we know it will disappear. It will be hidden in everything around us to improve our sensorial and perceptive skills (reality augmentation). Pervasive computing (also known as \"ubiquitous computing\") is about distributed computing devices in the physical world: wearable computers, devices embedded in everyday objects, sensors located everywhere in our environment. In this vision, Pervasive computing is about both the devices and the infrastructures (de-centralized High Performance Computers and communication channels) needed to support ubiquitous applications such as the so-called \"pervasive GRID\". In the near future, the pervasive GRID infrastructure, which I prefer to define as a \"computational exoskeleton\", will be extended to many human activities and will represent an ideal starting point for the creation of a future class of applications and services. The development of these applications and services can be boosted and accelerated by the use of powerful tools like Eclipse, SODA and Java. These tools are the result of a new collective and collaborative approach in software development that is currently emerging in the software community, and whose drivers are the \"open source\" movement and the web 2.0 technologies.\n\nReferences\n\n[1]\n\nD.
