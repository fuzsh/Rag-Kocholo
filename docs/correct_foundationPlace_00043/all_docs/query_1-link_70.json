Visit the faculty list for current faculty and their research interests and contact information. Your mentor must email their letter of support directly to Graduate Admissions. This letter must be on file before the program's deadline.\n\nSince admission to this thesis-/dissertation-based program requires an intent to mentor letter (an agreement from one of our faculty members to supervise your research project) as part of the application process, we strongly recommend that applicants contact potential mentors by sending their CV and research interests and securing that agreement prior to submitting an admission application.
