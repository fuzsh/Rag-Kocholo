        "text": "The Stephen F. Austin State University Board of Regents has voted to affiliate with the University of Texas System.\n\nStrategic Priorities\n\nEnhanced financial position by leveraging economies of scale, group purchasing, and access to the PUF.\n\nIncreased opportunities for faculty, staff, and students to participate in multi-institution collaborations, partnerships, and communities of practice with a state-wide impact.\n\nImproved access, affordability, and success and expanded support services available to students.\n\nEnhanced ability to retain, recruit and reward high-quality faculty and staff.\n\nIncreased enrollment at a sustainable pace.\n\nGuiding Principles\n\nLeverage the size, strength, and excellence of the UT System and its thirteen institutions to accelerate the time it takes to achieve integration.\n\nMake all the benefits provided to PUF-eligible UT academic institutions available as soon as possible.\n\nMinimize operational disruptions for students, faculty, and staff.\n\nCommunicate openly, honestly, and at a regular cadence with stakeholders.\n\nUphold and honor SFA's rich history, traditions, and culture.\n\nCommon Questions\n\nAll changes resulting from system affiliation that are mentioned below will only take place after full approval from the Texas Legislature. SFA will continue to function operationally as is until that time.\n\nInstitutional Identity\n\nWill our name, logo, mascot or colors change?\n\nThe UT System respects and would support the university’s desire to protect all things Lumberjack, including the name of Stephen F. Austin.\n\nWill any names on degrees change?\n\nNo.\n\nLeadership\n\nWhen will the presidential search begin? How will it work? Who will be involved?\n\nThe UT System uses an inclusive process to identify and recruit university presidents. The Chairman of the Board of Regents appoints a presidential search advisory committee composed of current and former regents along with representatives of the university’s faculty, staff, student and alumni and civic communities. The committee engages in an intensive review process, identifies candidates, interviews them, and recommends a slate of top candidates to the regents to interview and select. This longstanding process is prescribed in Regents’ Rules. In the case of a new presidential search at SFA, members of its Board of Regents would be included in the search process, along with the appointment of faculty, student, staff, alumni and local civic representatives.\n\nBoard of Regents\n\nWhat will happen to the Board of Regents? Will meetings continue as scheduled?\n\nThe UT System Board of Regents will serve as the top administrative body once affiliation becomes effective. The SFA Board of Regents will remain in place until that time.\n\nWill our new Board meet on campus? How will it be similar/different?\n\nThe Chancellor conducts an annual evaluation of each academic president and reports it each August to the UT System Board of Regents. Each fall, presidents provide the UT System an updated description of strategic goals and priorities for the year and identify the steps they will take to achieve them. Each spring, presidents provide a self-assessment which includes a description of progress made on these goals. This assessment, as well as key performance metrics (including undergraduate and graduate student profiles; persistence, retention, and graduation rates; degree and certificate production; faculty hiring; research expenditures; and financial status and operational efficiency data) are discussed., In areas that will benefit from more attention, the UT System works closely with the campus to provide support to achieve it.\n\nOrganization\n\nWill any programs or departments get eliminated, merged or otherwise changed?\n\nThe six colleges of SFA (business; education; fine arts; forestry and agriculture; liberal and applied arts; and science and mathematics), represent a broad array of essential disciplines that enable students to explore many different critical fields. Several include signature programs that no other UT institution currently offers, and we find that very appealing. We appreciate the unique strengths that each UT institution offers. While we see immediate opportunities to expand SFA’s existing computer science, nursing, and education programs, University leadership would make their own assessment on the appropriate mix of academic program offerings to help drive enrollment and respond to workforce needs, and the UT System will provide support to enable the president to achieve those goals. The UT System is especially interested in helping SFA enhance enrollment growth and address the state’s pressing workforce needs.\n\nWill any departments/divisions be outsourced (Audit, Custodial, Landscaping, etc.)?\n\nNo SFA operations will be transferred to UT System Administration. The UT System Administration exists to provide support and resources to each of its institutions.\n\nAthletics\n\nHow does this affect athletics funding?\n\nAffiliation with the UT System provides opportunities for strategic funding and access to a deeper pool of funds to match potential private funding sources.\n\nHow does affiliation affect facilities?\n\nAccess to funds mentioned above will allow for a number of improvements, including enhancement of facilities. With the exception of the Naymola Basketball Performance Center, SFA Athletics hasn’t made major facility upgrades or builds since the current Homer Bryce Stadium press box was built in 2006. The field house hasn’t been upgraded since 1988, and the sports medicine and academic center constructed in 2004 is outdated and wasn’t constructed for current operations.\n\nHow does affiliation affect athletic salaries?\n\nAffiliation with the UT System provides the potential to increase staff salaries across the university, including in the athletics department.\n\nWhat does affiliation mean for the Purple Lights Fund?\n\nThe Purple Lights Fund will not be affected by the affiliation from a day-to-day standpoint. Since the PLF is not a separate entity, such as the SFA Foundation, it will continue to operate as normal through our current business accounting processes and procedures.\n\nWhat does it mean for student-athlete scholarships?\n\nSystem affiliation does not have any effect on student-athlete scholarships as they are managed within the athletics department operating budget. Affiliating with the UT System does provide athletics access to additional funding sources that could enhance additional scholarship awards to student-athletes based on meeting any stated requirements.\n\nHow will affiliation affect ticket costs?\n\nAffiliation will not affect ticket costs. Ticket prices are set and maintained by the athletics department on an annual basis. Ticket prices are researched and analyzed prior to each season based on a variety of factors.\n\nOther\n\nWill banking or other partnerships in the community change?\n\nThe UT System negotiates and executes systemwide depository agreements allowing UT institutions to utilize any contracted banking partner while benefiting from favorable pricing based on systemwide volumes. The System currently has master depository agreements with Bank of America, Frost Bank, J.P. Morgan Chase, and Wells Fargo. The master depository agreements extend through August 31, 2024 but may be extended until August 31, 2026. UT institutions benefit from aggressive pricing based on systemwide volumes. To the extent there is a need for UT institutions to use other banking institutions, this need is generally accommodated. The Office of Finance within System Administration manages collateral posted by the various banking partners to secure aggregate UT System deposits of public funds within these banks. If SFA were to join the UT System, we would suggest SFA enjoy the benefits of the System’s master banking agreements and related collateral management.\n\nWill we keep using mySFA/Concur/Banner, etc.?\n\nThe UT System leverages its scale in IT contracts for the benefit of UT institutions. UT System sponsored software contracts include:\n\nOracle Master Agreement, Oracle Database Agreement — paid by UT System $2.75 million for academic institutions.\n\nMicrosoft agreements — paid by UT System - $3 million for academic institutions.\n\nRecent uplift to Microsoft A5 licensing (from the lower cost A3) — paid by UT System — $3 million for academic institutions.\n\nInternet 2 — Eduroam (paid by campuses) and Certificates (paid by UT System).\n\nCleanAddress — paid by campuses that opt in.\n\nVMware ELA — paid by campuses that opt in.\n\nSkillsoft — paid by campuses that opt in.\n\nDoes the system pay for any system level contracts or does each system institution pay a prorated portion of the contract?\n\nThe UT System pays for many of the system level contracts for academic institutions. See above.\n\nIs a member institution required to participate in system level contracts?\n\nInstitutions are not required to participate in system level agreements but generally choose to opt in to benefit from the competitive pricing and/or financial support.\n\nIT services offered to UT System institutions include:\n\nUT Share — ERP and related services (applications that plug into PeopleSoft). Paid by UT System - $28 million annually.\n\nShared data center program — Arlington Regional Data Center (ARDC). Paid by UT System - $1.6 million annually.\n\nWide area network — Institutions pay for their own connections but the rate is subsidized by $2 million annually from the UT System.\n\nNetwork Operation Center (at ARDC) — available to UT institutions at no cost.\n\nIntrusion Detection System — funded by UT Board of Regents at no cost to institutions - $4 million annually.\n\nImmutable backup service (currently being implemented) — Paid by UT System - $1 million.\n\nHow will this affect marketing efforts and student recruitment?\n\nThe UT System works with its institutions to ensure a sustainable and manageable rate of enrollment growth consistent with the institution’s aspirations and goals. As a university system, we are committed to meeting the educational needs of the state, which will require each institution to increase both enrollment numbers and degree attainment.\n\nIn addition to Promise Plus, we provide additional support by bringing together leaders and staff from across the UT System to discuss their recruitment, enrollment, and retention strategies. Across the entire UT System, we have experienced enrollment increases of more than 6% among undergraduate and graduate/professional students during a time when institutions across the nation experienced enrollment decreases and program closures."
