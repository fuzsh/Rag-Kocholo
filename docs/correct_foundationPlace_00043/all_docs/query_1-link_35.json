(“TSRAF”) is a 501 (c)(3) tax exempt organization that raises contributions in support of a wide range of firearm-related public interest activities of the Texas State Rifle Association (“TSRA”) and other organizations that defend and foster the Second Amendment rights of all law-abiding Americans. These activities are designed to promote firearms and hunting safety, to enhance marksmanship skills of those participating in the shooting sports, and to educate the general public about firearms in their historic, technological and artistic context.\n\nFunds raised by TSRAF benefit a variety of constituencies throughout Texas including youth, women, individuals with physical disabilities, gun collectors, law enforcement officers, hunters and competitive shooters."
