See the Little LP page.\n\nCadence\n\nThe first stereo-33 singles had the maroon label with silver print.\n\nCadence released some five-disc juke box packages, but apparently issued other stereo-33 singles as well. The package envelope for the Chordettes juke box set is shown at left.\n\n1961:\n\nCSP-1: This package draws from three different Andy Williams albums. Discs 2501-2503 are from Lonely Street [Cadence CLP-25030], 2504 is from To You, Sweetheart, Aloha [Cadence CLP25029], and 2505 is from The Village of St. Bernadette [Cadence CLP- 25038]:\n\n2501 - Andy Williams - Unchained Melody/I'm So Alone\n\n2502 - Andy Williams - You Don't Know What Love Is/Say It Isn't So\n\n2503 - Andy Williams - In The Wee Small Hours Of The Morning/When Your Lover Has Gone\n\n2504 - Andy Williams - Blue Hawaii/Moon Of Manakoora\n\n2505 - Andy Williams - I Believe/You'll Never Walk Alone\n\nCSP-2: From The Chordettes Sing Never on Sunday [Cadence CLP-25056]. Our copy of this package contains 2606-2608, 2610, and 2511. Originally issued with 2606-2610, Archie Bleyer undoubtedly got pushback from the juke box operators that the big hit \"Never on Sunday\" wasn't in the package, but was advertised on the slick he provided for display. He apparently removed 2609 and substituted a new single, 2511.\n\n2606 - The Chordettes - The Exodus Song/Theme From Goodbye Again (Say No More-It's Goodbye)\n\n2607 - The Chordettes - Tammy/True Love\n\n2608 - The Chordettes - Fascination/Around The World\n\n2609 - The Chordettes - Que Sera, Sera/Theme From \"A Summer Place\"\n\n2610 - The Chordettes - The Song From Moulin Rouge (Where Is Your Heart)/Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo\n\n2511 - The Chordettes - Never on Sunday/Wooden Heart\n\nWhen Cadence changed to the red label in 1962, the stereo-33 singles changed labels, also.\n\n1962:\n\nFrom the Andy Williams album Andy Williams Sings Rodgers and Hammerstein [Cadence CLP- 25005]:\n\n25005-33 - Andy Williams - People Will Say We're In Love/We Kiss In A Shadow\n\nCapitol\n\nThe First Capitol stereo-33 label was black with silver print. There was a vertical line down the left side of the label, with the Capitol logo directly left of the center hole.

When stereo singles came out in 1958 on 45s, Columbia bided their time until mid-1959, when they re-introduced the 33 single, this time in stereo.\n\nColumbia started by issuing two special promotional singles, each with a different artist on each side. On each side of these promo singles, and also on the sleeve, the following information was printed:\n\n\"This is a completely new kind of record combining two great innovations - the convenient 33 RPM Lp speed and exciting Stereophonic sound. You can play this record interchangeably with your 12-inch stereophonic Lp albums. It is one of many new STEREO SEVEN releases available at your record shop.\"\n\nStereo Seven Promotional Issues:\n\nAugust, 1959\n\nS-7 - Johnny Mathis - Stranger In Paradise//Mitch Miller & The Gang - Meet Me Tonight In Dreamland\n\nNovember, 1959:\n\nSS-7 - Johnny Mathis - The Best Of Everything//Percy Faith & His Orchestra - Theme From \"A Summer Place\" (2/8/60)\n\nColumbia also issued a six-pack of promotional stereo-33 singles in a cardboard carrier box. These had different artists on each side of the singles, and the \"new kind of record\" blurb on each label. They didn't have record numbers, just a master number on each side.\n\n1959\n\nJohnny Mathis - Stranger in Paradise (ZSV-62118)/Mitch Miller - Meet Me Tonight in Dreamland (ZSV- 62141)\n\nMitch Miller - I'll Take You Home Again Kathleen (ZSV-62119)/Johnny Mathis - Hello, Young Lovers (ZSV-62120)\n\nThe Dave Brubeck Quartet - Blue Rondo Ala Turk (ZSV-62121)/Billy Butterfied & Ray Conniff - Rosalie (ZSV-62122)\n\nThe Dave Brubeck Quartet - Take Five (ZSV-62123)/Billy Butterfied & Ray Conniff - South of the Border (ZSV-62124)\n\nLes Elgart & His Orchestra - Cherokee (ZSV-62125)/The Percy Faith Strings - Autumn Leaves (ZSV- 62126)\n\nLes Elgart & His Orchestra - Poinciana (ZSV-62127)/The Percy Faith Strings - Laura (ZSV-62128)\n\nCommercial Issues:\n\nColumbia announced in the August 3, 1959, issue of Billboard that they were releasing eleven new stereo-33 singles commercially. These all had a multi-color \"Stereo Seven\" label with black print. These commercial singles did not have the juke box package numbers shown for the juke box issues below. The singles started showing up in Billboard the week of September 7 (dates in parentheses are first Hot 100 reference to stereo single). By the end of 1959, only two Columbia stereo- 33 singles had been mentioned on the Hot 100.

Others, which had regular series numbers, had a green label.\n\n1963:\n\nOrange/red label:\n\n3-8853 - Johnny Cash - (There'll Be) Peace In The Valley (For Me)/Remember The Alamo\n\n3-8854 - Barbra Streisand - Lover Come Back/Any Place I Hang My Hat\n\n3-8958 - Andre Previn - Around The World/Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah\n\nGreen label:\n\n3-38975 - Tony Bennett with the Ralph Sharon Trio - When Lights Are Low/On Green Dolphin Street\n\n3-39005 - Andy Williams - Show Me/Wouldn't It Be Loverly\n\n3-39020 - Marty Robbins - Change That Dial/You Won't Have Her Long\n\n3-42069 - Miles Davis - It Ain't Necessarily So/I Loves You, Porgy\n\nJuke Box Stereo Seven (JS7) Packages\n\nColumbia had extensive Stereo Seven releases targeted at juke box operators. The labels of these singles had the juke box package designation number (starting with \"JS7-\") on the left side of the label, in addition to the regular S7 number (see left).\n\nWe have not confirmed all the package numbers, nor have we identified all the tracks on each record. Any help in this area will be appreciated. Our guesses at the package numbers have a question mark after the number.\n\nEach group of juke box stereo-33 singles was packaged in a kraft paper envelope such as shown at left. The five-disc envelopes also contained the juke box title strips and a 5\"x5\" color photo of the album cover from which the single package was taken. These photos were used in some juke boxes to draw attention to the album and songs. There were apparently 85 such packages issued, or at least the numbers go up to 85. We haven't identified them all. There were also some issued on Epic.\n\nWe have not identified all the tracks for each record, although the record numbers and artists are known for the most part. Any help in this area will be appreciated. The packages by Trio Los Panchos and Los Cincos Latinos, while listed in the US catalog sequence, may not have been released in the US.\n\n1959:\n\nJS7-1: From the Johnny Mathis albums Heavenly and Faithfully [Columbia CS-8152/8219]:\n\nNote: This package contained one additional Johnny Mathis stereo single.\n\nS7 30598 - Johnny Mathis - Heavenly/Hello, Young Lovers\n\nS7 30599 - Johnny Mathis - Misty/Stranger In Paradise\n\nS7 30600 - Johnny Mathis - Tonight/Maria\n\nS7 30601 - Johnny Mathis - Secret Love/And This Is My Beloved\n\n1960:\n\nJS7-2: From the Ray Conniff albums Conniff Meets Butterfield and Concert In Rhythm, Volume II [Columbia CS-8155/8212]:\n\nS7 30602 -\n\nS7 30603 - Ray Conniff Singers - Love Is The Sweetest Thing/Rosalie\n\nS7 30604 - Billy Butterfield & Ray Conniff - You Must Have Been A Beautiful Baby/South Of The Border\n\nS7 30605 - Ray Conniff & His Orchestra & Chorus - An Improvisation On \"Liebestraum\"/An Improvisation On \"None But The Lonely Heart\"\n\nS7 30606 - Ray Conniff & His Orchestra & Chorus - Warsaw Concerto/One Fine Day\n\nJS7-3: From Mitch Miller & the Gang's album Fireside Sing Along with Mitch [Columbia CS-8184]:\n\nS7 30607 - Mitch Miller & The Gang - That Old Gang Of Mine/Down By The Old Mill Stream\n\nS7 30608 - Mitch Miller & The Gang - I'll Take You Home Again, Kathleen/Meet Me Tonight In Dreamland\n\nS7 30609 - Mitch Miller & The Gang - Juanita; Sweet Genevieve/When You And I Were Young, Maggie\n\nS7 30610 - Mitch Miller & The Gang - Now Is The Hour/I'm Looking Over A Four Leaf Clover\n\nS7 30611 - Mitch Miller & The Gang - Sing Along/Baby Face\n\nJS7-4: From the Dave Brubeck Quartet albums Gone with the Wind and Southern Scene [Columbia CS- 8156/8235]:\n\nS7 30719 - Dave Brubeck Quartet - Gone With The Wind/Camptown Races\n\nS7 30720 - Dave Brubeck Quartet -\n\nS7 30721 - Dave Brubeck Quartet - Deep In The Heart Of Texas/Little Rock Getaway\n\nS7 30722 - Dave Brubeck Quartet - Ol' Man River/At The Darktown Strutter's Ball\n\nS7 30723 - Dave Brubeck Quartet - Oh, Susanna/Jeannie With The Light Brown Hair\n\nJS7-5: From the Miles Davis albums Porgy and Bess and Kind Of Blue [Columbia CS-8085/8163]:\n\nS7 30735 - Miles Davis - I Loves You Porgy/Freddy Freeloader/\n\nS7 30736 - Miles Davis - Bess You Is My Woman Now/It Ain't Necessarily So\n\nS7 30737 - Miles Davis - There's A Boat That's Leaving Soon For New York/So What\n\nS7 30738 - Miles Davis -\n\nS7 30739 - Miles Davis -\n\n(JS7-6) See Epic SE-6.\n\n(JS7-7) See Epic SE-7.\n\nJS7-8:\n\nJS-9: From the Johnny Mathis 2-LP set The Rhythms and Ballads of Broadway [Columbia C2S-803]:\n\nS7 30828 - Johnny Mathis - Everything's Coming Up Roses/I Wish I Were In Love Again\n\nS7 30829 - Johnny Mathis - You Do Something To Me/Let's Misbehave\n\nS7 30830 - Johnny Mathis - I Could Have Danced All Night/A Cock-Eyed Optimist\n\nS7 30831 - Johnny Mathis - I Just Found Out About Love/Let's Do It\n\nS7 30832 - Johnny Mathis - I Am In Love/Love Eyes\n\nJS7-10: Probably from the Andre Previn Trio album Give My Regards to Broadway [Columbia CS-8330]:\n\nS7 30833 - Andre Previn & His Trio -\n\nS7 30834 - Andre Previn & His Trio -\n\nS7 30835 - Andre Previn & His Trio -\n\nS7 30836 - Andre Previn & His Trio -\n\nS7 30837 - Andre Previn & His Trio -\n\nJS-11: From the Les Elgart album Designs for Dancing [Columbia CS-8291]:\n\nS7 30838 - Les Elgart - Stumbling/The Nearness Of You\n\nS7 30839 - Les Elgart - Moonglow/\n\nS7 30840 - Les Elgart - East Of The Sun (And West Of The Moon)/\n\nS7 30841 - Les Elgart - Designs For Dancing/Stella By Starlight\n\nS7 30842 - Les Elgart - Anything Goes/The Mar-Cha-Cha\n\nJS7-12: From the Johnny Cash albums Ride This Train and The Fabulous Johnny Cash [Columbia CS-8255/CS-8122]:\n\nS7 30843 - Johnny Cash - Loading Coal/Slow Rider\n\nS7 30844 - Johnny Cash - Lumberjack/Dorrance Of Ponchartrain\n\nS7 30845 - Johnny Cash - When Papa Played The Dobro/Going To Memphis\n\nS7 30846 - Johnny Cash - Old Doc Brown/Boss Jack\n\nS7 30847 - Johnny Cash - One More Ride/Run Softly, Blue River\n\n1961:\n\nJS7-13: From the Carl Smith album The Carl Smith Touch [Columbia CS-8332]:\n\nS7 30848 - Carl Smith - I'm Not In Her Plans Anymore/Cut Across Shorty\n\nS7 30849 - Carl Smith -\n\nS7 30850 - Carl Smith -\n\nS7 30851 - Carl Smith -\n\nS7 30852 - Carl Smith - What A Way To Live/Past\n\nJ7-14 Leased to Columbia-Mexico.\n\nJ7-15 (mono): From the El Trio Los Panchos album Los Favritos de Todo El Mundo (Everybody Loves the Trio Los Panchos) [Columbia-Mexico EX-5012]:\n\nNote: This was released with the yellow mono Columbia-33 labels.
