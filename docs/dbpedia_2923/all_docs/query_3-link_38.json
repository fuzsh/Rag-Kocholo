Even before applying for certification, businesses can use these free documents to assess, develop, implement, and improve their food safety management systems. Developed through extensive and open consultation with global stakeholders, the FSSC 22000 Scheme uses international and independent standards such as ISO 22000, ISO 22003-1, and technical specifications for sector-specific Pre-Requisite Programs (PRPs), including ISO/TS 22002-1.\n\nAuditing\n\nFSSC licensed and accredited Certification Bodies use the Scheme Documents to assess and audit the applicant organizationâ€™s continuous compliance with the requirements of the FSSC 22000 Scheme. This way-of-working assures the performance of the food safety management system within certified organizations.\n\nFSSC 22000\n\nProviding trust to the food supply chain\n\nCompliance is monitored by the FSSC Integrity Program, Certification Bodies, and Accreditation Bodies. Compliance activities are used to identify trends and define improvements in conjunction with licensed partners. Together with our partners, we ensure a positive and sustainable impact on the consumer goods industry and the related supply chain worldwide.\n\nFoundation FSSC and FSSC 22000\n\nTransparent governance structure for your benefit\n\nThe FSSC 22000 Scheme is managed by Foundation FSSC and governed by an independent Board of Stakeholders comprising representatives from sectors across the consumer goods industry and related supply chain partners.\n\nTo ensure transparency and involvement of the industry, an Advisory Committee makes recommendations regarding several topics, including technical aspects like unannounced audits & food fraud, guidance documents, and Scheme revisions. The Advisory Committee reports to the Board of Stakeholders.\n\nWhy choose the FSSC 22000 Development Program\n\nTake your first step towards food safety certification\n\nSmall and medium-sized organizations (SMEs) play a significant role in the food supply chain. To support these organizations in the supply of safe food, we offer the FSSC 22000 Development Program. The FSSC 22000 Development Program provides a two-level approach to support SMEs in producing safe food. It is aligned with CODEX HACCP, GFSI Global Markets and fits into the FSSC 22000 structure."
