        "text": "From 1976 – 1978 * Almost Killed to Life in Exile to Movement of Jah People\n\nBy M. Peggy Quattro\n\nOpinion\n\nLike millions around the globe, I eagerly awaited the debut of the Bob Marley: One Love movie. Paramount Pictures took it on! A 70++ million-dollar budget! Wow! Reggae gone Hollywood! Yet, as intriguing and well-put-together as the movie trailers appeared, many fans were left wondering … Wait! What?\n\nI’ve watched One Love four times. Four times! Each time noticing something new, something not true, a disjointed timeline, events that never happened. Judging by the barrage of questioning comments on social, I know I’m not alone. From 1976 to 1978, we’re immersed in Bob’s Hollywood story world. Locations with stories created by screenwriters and coached by the Family.\n\nUnderstood, it is not a documentary. On the flip side, it’s a biopic. Claimed to be “based on a true story,” the biopic offers a creative version of a person’s life. An emotional and entertaining portrayal to hopefully engage audiences. Here, there are soppy scenes with mother, father, teen Bob, and Rita, of course.\n\nSo Bob Seh: “You should know and not believe”\n\nThis movie left me feeling Bob never got the profound radical story he deserved. Perhaps when interpreting a deceased icon’s life, the storyteller should not fabricate stories because they don’t like or don’t accept the truth of that life. Truths should not switch to untruths when it suits the situation.\n\nI get a bit ruffled when I see One Love tagged as a “biography.” It isn’t. A decent biography will contain only facts and tell how the person really was. This story does not do that. Bob Marley fans do not want to see their musical messenger, their Rasta rebel, be made lesser than or greater than he truthfully was. I don’t feel Bob would either. Bob’s life is the story. Sometimes truth is better than fiction. His fans deserve to know what’s fiction and be made aware of it outside the theater.\n\nI’ve seen on social that folks look forward to this review. Jah know, some will like it, some will not. Nuh mattah. I’m a long-time insider and a major Bob disciple.\n\nThe Back Story\n\nGrowing up a musician’s child – my dad was a guitar-pickin’ singer in a country-bluegrass band – all music became my source of joy. Still is. My Bob connection appeared in the mid-‘70s while living in Nürnberg. From the first spin on a friend’s turntable, Bob Marley & the Wailers captured my head, heart, and soul. I gravitated to that unfamiliar Reggae beat. The superb mix of instruments, booming basslines, and splendid harmonies blew me away. Add the biblical and revolutionary references woven throughout and I was hooked. I kick myself still for not going to see BMW while I was in Germany. That 1977 BMW European tour is a short yet essential inclusion in the One Love movie.\n\nBack in Miami, an opportunity appeared in 1981 to work for Don Taylor Artist Management. When I learned he represented Bob Marley and Jimmy Cliff – two absolute heroes – I said, this is my gig. Don and I talked on the phone often and at length. Finally sitting across from him, he asked, “Why do you want to work with these crazy Jamaicans?” Truthfully, I answered: “It’s the music … it’s the Bible … it’s uplifting the underdogs … it’s the message.” My first day was set for the following Monday, May 11, 1981.\n\nI’m giving you context because I want it to be clear that although I did not get to personally know Bob, we are connected. That said, I did know Don. I felt his character’s depiction here was a bit sleazy, possibly set to look that way. Through my position, I had the pleasure to know Bob’s mother. I call her Ms B. We connected and remained friends until her return to Zion in 2008.\n\n“My first day was May 11, 1981…” ~MPeggyQ\n\nRita and Chris made their appearance on my first day in Reggae. The Melody Makers, mothers and children, and the Wailers band members came into my orbit soon after. I became familiar with the people in Bob’s world. Many became friends. Many shared their stories and memories. For decades I interviewed innumerable Reggae artists and professionals. All these stories I published on the pages of Reggae Report Magazine.\n\nBut here, we’re talking Hollywood. Yes, I’ve said it before – this is a Hollywood movie with Bob’s music. New young audiences may think it’s true, as in “facts,” including my great-nieces and nephews, and likely yours. It is not. When I asked that question after one theater viewing, the 3-generation family of women told me, yes, they thought it was all true. I feel duty-bound to defend, impart, and hold up truth beyond the tale of Bob Marley: One Love story world.\n\nThe Team\n\nTo begin with, the film’s production team attracted my attention. Specifically, the Marley Family, who – after 43 years – said, Hell yeh! Let’s do this! (Paraphrasing here) Another big smile when I saw Plan B Entertainment (12 Years a Slave, Moonlight) credited as an executive producer – I mean, come on, Brad Pitt! Wait! What?\n\nTuff Gong Pictures and Orly Marley, wife of Ziggy Marley, are also credited as EPs. Ziggy, Cedella, and Rita are co-producers. I won’t bore you with the list of names you’ll find in the worthwhile credits – more producers, production creators, actors, staff, workers, crew – ‘cause a few persons of note will pop up as we go along.\n\nThe Theme\n\nBetween two Kingston concerts, we’re part of Bob’s journey circa 1976 to 1978. From Trench Town to London and back. The mission is to show the human side of Bob. A touchy-feely time while his world is on fire. In the UK, he’s an ex-pat, songwriter, singer, musician, lover, leader, Rasta, and rising Reggae rock star!\n\nAudiences will sporadically meet the gunshot survivor, revolutionary Rastaman, the conscious compassionate human. Bob Marley, the man, lives for peace and unity. The rebel who stands “for the people” is oddly overhauled by an exaggerated love relationship.\n\nSo Bob Seh: “Music you’re the key … Talk to who, please talk to me…”\n\nWe find redemption with the abundance of Marley music flowing from start to finish. The re-recorded and re-mixed songs are aesthetically mind-blowing.\n\nThe Stars\n\nOpening Day\n\nAs a reporter, a journalist, I am obligated to do my research. I watch, listen, and watch again. One Love’s opening day came on February 14, 2024, Valentine’s Day. I was there for the first A.M. showing; and a second one in the P.M. Then twice more. I endured taking notes in the dark, sometimes smiling, often singing, and sometimes confounded: Wait What?\n\nI get it. It’s V-day. The Day of Love. Bob’s favorite word, I bet. But, as a release date tie-in, I was confused.\n\nTwo life-altering concerts – Smile Jamaica and One Love – are the story’s bookends (and one is actually in the title.) The two-year back-and-forth sandwiched in between includes Bob’s horrifying assassination attempt, being exiled to London, various relationships, confrontations, flashbacks, a new hit album, major tours, and football matches. Re-injuring an old toe injury results in a shocking rare form of skin cancer diagnosis. It is not the merriest of times for Bob Marley. The meandering Hallmark-like love story with fluffy fill-ins has been noted as a love letter to Rita Marley from her children.\n\n“If my life is for me, I don’t want it … my life is for people…” ~Bob Marley\n\nThe cinematography in Jamaica is wonderful. Sadly, not enough of it. We’re soaring through Trench Town, beautiful Bull Bay, riding along the most perfectly blue Caribbean Sea. We jump over to the UK, where the footage is equally fetching. The colors and movements, performances and fictitious events are impressive. The story with many parts is awkwardly saturated with the Hallmark-ish tale.\n\nKeeping the momentum flowing is the more-than-capable director Reinaldo Marcus Green (King Richard).\n\nTurn the Lights Down Low\n\nThe movie begins with Ziggy Marley appearing on the big screen. He welcomes you on behalf of the Family to this way long-overdue film. I don’t think any or many of us had any idea of why or what to expect. I was there to find out.\n\nThe story opens with Bob announcing the Smile Jamaica concert at a Kingston press conference. It’s 1976 and violence and political mayhem is happening concurrently on Kingston’s streets. In hopes of calming the civil chaos, Bob, alongside manager Don Taylor, declares this concert will be free “for people.” Actual footage of Kingston’s violence, fighting, and fear appears, flooding memory cells with those real days never to be forgotten.\n\nOne picturesque day we watch Bob and his Rasta bredren as they run through the streets of Trench Town, alongside huge military vehicles, before transitioning to running along beautiful Bull Bay. Soon the band of dreadlocks spring into the welcoming waterfalls. The viewer leaves Kingston’s chaos behind and wishes they were there, in that waterfall, right now! But only for a minute.\n\nThe Assassination Attempt\n\nSoon we witness Bob’s benevolent side. While in his yard on Hope Rd., a local woman asks for his financial help. Without hesitation, he instructs Don to comply. Chris Blackwell (James Norton) appears, talking with the “scared” film crew he brought down to shoot the show. They were leaving the island. He’s concerned now about the concert and Bob being mistakenly connected to a certain political group. This is true, as officials were manipulating the timeline then, looking to capitalize on the people’s love for Bob Marley.\n\nOnly days later the unthinkable happens. Cut to rehearsals. There’s a creative collaboration going on between the Wailers band members. All is well. Drummer Carly Barrett (portrayed flawlessly by Hector “Roots” Lewis) is following the direction of Skip, Bob’s nickname. Marley takes a break and moves to the kitchen. Red flag> Not quite in line with reality, but you’ll get the picture.\n\n“There is no such thing as coincidence …” ~Haruki Murakami, Japanese Author\n\nAs Bob plays with grapefruit, gunmen storm his crowded house. In the tiny kitchen, you feel the intense, dramatic eye-lock between Gunslinger and Rasta singer. Reckless shots fly and Bob is hit once while Don Taylor takes six bullets and lies wounded on the floor. Sidenote: he told me five. Red flag> Must call out reality here, Don was standing in front of Bob, was hit first, in the back, and more than likely saved Bob’s life.\n\nIn the movie, Rita’s character is shot in the head; her dreadlocks save her brain. Bob is shaken up, but able to walk. He stays by Rita’s bedside. In this story world, she’s admitted to hospital and “lucky” to be alive. Red flag> Rita was grazed in the head, the bullet removed, head bandaged, and she was released from the hospital that night. It could be maybe her dreads saved her life?\n\nBob checked out of hospital and is driven up to Strawberry Hill. High in the Blue Mountains, Bob will figure out his next move. All his closest bredren are there. Rasta elder Mortimer Planno (a favorite character played by Jamaica’s Wilfred Chambers) is calming and wise. His last question in this scene wraps up the whole question on the real-life Marley assassination attempt: The question is not why. The real question is why they didn’t succeed.\n\nWith Nyabinghi, common sense, love, and inner guidance, the human side of Bob prepares for the concert. Thousands of people are waiting for their Rastaman hero. Dread and consternation surround him as he makes his way down the mountain. He’s ready to appear “for the people.”\n\nSmile Jamaica\n\nHemmed in by police, military, and gang leaders, Bob heads to the stage. Red flag> Rita’s character shows up bandaged to say (in movie-language), “I checked myself out of the hospital.” Considering all the worrisome conditions, the Smile Jamaica concert scene is bona fide. There are real musicians, an overcrowded stage, and thousands of extras enjoying themselves. Although too short, the concert is a high point.\n\nDramatic flashbacks ensue. First to Bob’s youth. He listens to his young black mother ask for help, and his elderly white father’s disturbing claim “he is not my son.” Sidenote: He is. Are seeds of insecurity planted? This singular flashback is pivotal in the telling of later flashbacks.\n\n“If puss and dog can get together, why can’t we love one another…” ~Bob Marley\n\nYou feel Bob when he visualizes the gunslinger assassin in the crowd. Kingsley is excellent at these close-ups and relaying Bob’s perceptive side. Bob Marley then shows his wounded chest and arm to his people and quickly leaves the stage.\n\nExodus\n\nFact: The next day Bob is off to Nassau, before London. In the movie, he’s off to London. He aims to put his life back together and record what became the Exodus album. Sidenote: He also recorded Kaya then, which isn’t mentioned. This ex-pat, injured footballer, is fast becoming a major rock star. His love affair with Miss World 1976, Cindy Breakspeare (Umi Myers), was written, shot and edited. Suddenly, anything containing her dialogue with Bob is cut from the final film. Cindy’s character is there, silent, visible in the background, like an extra. Sidenote: She was no extra.\n\n“Dem don’t haffi like it … when dem hear it, dem like it.” ~Kingsley as Bob Marley\n\nEmbraced by his Rasta beliefs, the holy chalice, Haile Selassie, and the emperor’s ring, Bob feels safe and empowered. He holds on to his sanity and sense of purpose. A next flashback is to Kingston’s Studio One, where a group of teenagers are auditioning for Coxsone Dodd and Lee “Scratch” Perry. The young Wailing Wailers deliver an upbeat, ska-fueled version of “Simmer Down.” Sung by teen-age Bob (skillfully acted and performed by Jamaica’s Quan-Dajai Henrique), the group lands a recording deal.\n\nBob’s days are full of music, business, football, love, and song. During a Paris football match, Bob’s big toe gets reinjured. “Old injury,” Bob mutters. There is Rita’s open hostility and financial confrontations with Don Taylor (Anthony Welsh). At a fancy Island Records party, Chris introduces Bob to society’s influencers. An attempt to pull the reluctant Rasta into this pop star orbit.\n\nI did feel all the feels when the famous Lion of Judah ring, once belonging to the late Emperor Haile Selassie I, was given to Bob as a present from Prince Asfaw Wossen. Sidenote: Not quite in time or reality, but a powerful scene still.\n\nThe flaming cane field is the scene for another pivotal flashback. Young Bob sees his father emerging on horseback, and without words, passes the child a ring. I did say it was a bit disjointed so bear with me.\n\n“Music run like river…” ~Kingsley as Bob in London\n\nThe recurring romantic story between Bob and Rita is disturbing. Red flag> Especially when Rita hauls off and boxes [hits] Bob for being “naïve.” In real life, I’d bet my house that that would never happen. The two characters are never paired in a way that audiences can follow comfortably.\n\nIt’s a story. I remind myself it’s based on a real life. But, a story written as a loving tribute to their mother. Ziggy and Cedella give Rita the relationship she never had with the wandering and womanizing Bob. A definite effort was put into rewriting history for new fans. This tale appears to sway from “Tuff Gong,” the smart, independent, strong man, toward affectedly giving Rita the power.\n\nOne Love\n\nThe two rival gang leaders meet Bob in a London park. They found peace in prison and asked Bob to come home. Kingston needs him. It’s time to once again bring unity “for the people.” Bob Marley returns to a hero’s welcome. His people turn out to cheer and follow the smiling Rastaman through Kingston’s streets. The One Love Peace concert is set for April 21-22, 1978. Sidenote: According to manager Don Taylor, Bob plans and pays for the production.\n\nAs the story draws to an end, Bob is seemingly enjoying his life back in Jamaica. Sadly, the story continues to lean more toward family man Bob and less toward revolutionary Rasta Bob. The schmaltzy campfire scene was borderline over the top. Ask yourself, who is the real revolutionary? Bob Marley is. He lived “for the people.” He lived for peace, love, unity, and music.\n\n“My life is only important if mi can help plenty people” ~Bob to Bruce Morrow, NYC, 3/16/78\n\nSuddenly, the young would-be assassin shows up unannounced inside Bob’s Hope Rd. house. Kingsley convincingly shoots him the “what the… you doin’ here?” look. Sporting baby dreads, the redeemed gunslinger steps forward to beg Bob’s forgiveness. Bob’s movie character recognizes that the Rasta seed has been planted and hugs the would-be killer. Sidenote: This never happened.\n\nThe One Love concert scene, although short, is exciting. The two rival party leaders are there. Tens of thousands of Jamaicans are there. Guitarist Junior Marvin is there (played by his son, David Davo Kerr), organist Tyrone Downie is there (Tosin Cole), and the I Three with Marcia (Naomi Cowan), Judy (Sevana), and Lashana as Rita are there.\n\nOn stage, Bob is on fire. He calls for Manley and Seaga to come forward. He must show the people that peace is possible. Kingsley continues to shine as folk hero Bob. Grasping the political leaders’ hands overhead, he prays for peace, love, and unity.\n\nSidenote: Stick around long enough to see the real Bob Marley on the One Love stage at the end. My heart skipped a beat when he appeared in all his frenzied glory. Dancing. Singing. Praying. Real footage with the real man. That moving clip is the story world we all hoped to re-live – or experience for the first time. To get the facts, I recommend watching the many Bob Marley documentaries.\n\nThe final flashback involves the burning cane fields once again. Yet another horseman rides out of the flames. Young Bob still stands silently. He looks up into the face of H.I.M. Haile Selassie I. A perfect Hollywood ending as Bob is swept up by the father he never knew and taken home. The End.\n\n“One Love. One Heart. One Aim. One Destiny” ~Bob to Bruce Morrow, NYC, 3/16/78\n\nI’m still talking, so if you want to stick around, read on >>>\n\nThe peace Bob brought to the One Love Peace concert in 1978 was short-lived. As was the life of brother Bob Marley. He died May 11, 1981, in a Miami hospital. He was 36 years old.\n\nI hold no ill will toward the children. The eldest, Cedella and Ziggy, are now in their 50s. They were 13 and 12 when I met them after their father passed; 9 and 8 when this story begins. They depended on the adults around Bob in ’76, ’77, and ’78, to tell the real story. A heavy influence in the narrative is attributed to their mother, Rita. It did not go unnoticed.\n\nHistory was rewritten by rearranging events and moving timelines. People who were there and mattered to Bob during those turbulent years were either left out (Cedella Marley Booker, Skill Cole, Bunny Wailer) or cut out (Cindy Breakspeare, Peter Tosh).\n\nIt appears Ziggy is the spokesperson for the Family. Buoyed by his wife Orly, also President of Tuff Gong Worldwide, the once-shy Ziggy has conquered live interviews. I’ve watched several since the release. One instance caused me some concern. In his final question from Charles Barkley on CNN’s “King Barkley” on February 14, 2024, Ziggy was asked about the 500 or so books out there on Bob Marley. Barkley asked if he had read any. Ziggy laughed at the question, quickly saying, “Nope.” He added, “I’m like … no … not even the best, I said no. I live with my experience with him. I love that.”\n\nThis made me think that since Ziggy was only 12 in 1981, how much experience did he live? He has missed out on volumes of valuable interviews, articles, and information that highlight and document his father’s life. There are many [mostly] serious writers and collectors who truly care for the sanctity of Bob Marley. They knew things, lived things, and experienced things that Ziggy and the Family may not have known.\n\n“So Much Things to Say” ~Robert Nesta Marley\n\nI recognize Ziggy’s core message is that he wants this story to show Bob as a human being. He acknowledges Kingsley for “going inside Bob to do that.” I think we all agree with Ziggy when he says the movie will connect with audiences: “The reason is because of who he is as a human being.” Adding, “People will think ‘he’s one of us’ and they will feel something.”\n\nIn that same Barkley interview, Ziggy claims: “We weren’t afraid of the truth. He wasn’t afraid of the truth … he lived his life like an open book.” From what I’ve read, seen, and know, there were truths overlooked and shape-changed to fit the story that the Marleys want you to know.\n\nUnfortunately, that message was not made clear enough or understood by many viewers, reviewers, and critics. Maybe due to the preponderance of relationship dialogue, the superstar trip, the made-up stuff, or the abundance of timeline jumps and flashbacks. There was a push for narrative, not necessarily the truth.\n\nConfirming my concern about twisted truths, Lashana Lynch did express on the Tamron Hall Show her actual belief that Rita had appeared at Smile Jamaica straight from the hospital. The facts say otherwise. I believe she truly wanted to represent Rita accurately and honestly. But coming in with no real knowledge of Rita and Bob’s background and their story, she believed what she was told. History cannot be changed because someone does not like or agree with the truth.\n\nI just heard this the other day (but can’t remember who said it…sorry) … “If you want to win people over and you want to grab people, tell them the truth so that they have a reason to be angry.” Adding, “Stick to the truth … Truth is too easy to check.”\n\nThe Chris character seemed quite saccharine and sympathetic. His display of quiet concern was off-putting for me. The good guy with high-society connections who all wanted to meet Bob, this was good for Chris, too. “Mi no have no friends in high society” Bob once sang. Never forget it was Bob’s music and message, leadership and vigor, that got him to that place in life.\n\n“Instinctively…from the 1st time I met him, I just knew there was $omething there” ~Chris Blackwell, CBS Sunday Morning 2/14/24\n\nThe real Chris Blackwell was interviewed on CBS Sunday Morning on February 11, 2024. Imagine my surprise when he began to weep as he remembered Bob’s massive show in Milano, Italy, Wait. What?! “He was barely touching the ground or maybe that was my image of him … because I saw him just going …” (begins to cry) as he points up to the sky. “It’s a lot,” he adds, “because it’s super rare that there is somebody to have what he had and to be able to touch the world.”\n\nYes, don’t we know. Chris is a wealthy man to begin with, but what he’s earned – and continues to earn – from Bob Marley’s music and message, leadership and vigor is unfathomable.\n\nThat super rare part of Bob Marley’s life was somewhat marginalized in this One Love story. Along with his revolutionary, rebel, and woman-loving side. If there is ever any future film or documentary produced, okayed, or licensed by the Family, I hope they show these realities, along with his relationships with the original Wailers, the incomparable Wailers band, management, his children, his record label, and his women.\n\nI’m curious why we did not see or hear much from eldest daughter Cedella, CEO of Tuff Gong International. She was absent at the premieres and numerous mainstream media interviews. I did notice where she said she wants “that little Jamaican boys and girls can look at him and say, ‘I want to be like Bob.’”\n\nThe timing for the release is on point. Forty-three years later his music and message are just as loved and needed today as they were in the ‘70s. More records will sell and songs downloaded. More releases from the vault, more compilations, more collaborations. The Family retains an extensive catalog of companies, merchandise and products that will sell. There is much more to come.\n\nMy hope is that the Family feels an obligation to give back to Bob’s people; to help those who need it. To live as Bob lived. To love as Bob loved. All that they have is attributable to Bob Marley, the poor “yellow bwoy” farmer kid from Nine Mile.\n\n“It’s gonna be a hit movie…they’re goin’ to see what you tell them about Marley” ~Allan “Skill” Cole to the Media\n\nBob Marley is so much more than human. He’s spirit, love, energy, joy, and hope … a musical prophet with a wicked smile and timeless songs.\n\nBob told us we’d get tired fi see his face. The success of this movie only goes to prove that we are not tired of seeing his face … or dancing to his songs … “…but you cyaan get me outta di race.”\n\nRoots Rock Reggae. It’s a Rebel Music."
