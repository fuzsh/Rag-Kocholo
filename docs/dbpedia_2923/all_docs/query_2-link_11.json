They released their debut single “Jimi Was” in June 2020.\n\nWith both feet firmly planted in the early singer/songwriter era of American folk music, Bradley Scott Malone is a folk/Americana singer-songwriter who blends rich storytelling with lofty and melodic guitar work heavily influenced by the late Maury Muehleisen. Brad is quietly carrying the torch of the Pete Seeger-Harry Chapin-Jim Croce style, story-telling folk singer to current generations. His song “My Name is Neville (Write It Down)” is a tribute to those who have served our country. It was relased on Veterans Day 2020.\n\nA Pittsburgh-based Trio, Brett McCutcheon (Piano and Saxophone), Luke Wood (Guitar and Bass) and Sophia Elliott (Drums) have been classmates and band mates at North Allegheny Senior High School for several years. Frequently performing together they decided to expand into studio recording with their first EP in December 2019. Follow that debut in 2019, they again released an interpretation of “Fibbage 3” from the Jack Box games in December 2020.\n\nLocal area musicians record original song “SOS 2020” (Save Our Stages 2020) to raise awareness, money and incite action all to benefit Pittsburgh music venues affected by the Pandemic.\n\nSOS 2020 was written by Eric Rodger (Royal Honey), Produced by Anthony (Rocky) Lamonde (The Borstal Boys) and recorded and mixed by Bob McCutcheon at The Vault Recording Studio, the project quickly grew to include more than 27 local bands and more than 60 artists. It is an all-star line-up of local musicians recorded over several weeks (with members from Rusted Root, The Granati Brothers, A Common Crown and the Legendary Hucklebucks)."
