If the directory creation fails or TiDB does not have the read and write permissions on that directory, Fast Online DDL might experience unpredictable issues.\n\nWarning\n\nSince v6.3.0, this configuration item is deprecated and superseded by the system variable tidb_enable_tmp_storage_on_oom. When the TiDB cluster is upgraded to v6.3.0 or a later version, it will automatically initialize the variable with the value of oom-use-tmp-storage. After that, changing the value of oom-use-tmp-storage does not take effect anymore.\n\nNote\n\nThis configuration item has been deprecated, and currently takes effect only when the value of @tidb_enable_clustered_index is INT_ONLY. If you need to add or remove the primary key, use the NONCLUSTERED keyword instead when creating the table. For more details about the primary key of the CLUSTERED type, refer to clustered index.\n\nNote\n\nTiDB nodes use the value of server-version to verify the current TiDB version. Therefore, to avoid unexpected behaviors, before upgrading the TiDB cluster, you need to set the value of server-version to empty or the real version of the current TiDB cluster.\n\nWarning\n\nWhen the number of TiDB instances in the cluster exceeds 2048 or the concurrent connection count of a single TiDB instance exceeds 1048576, the 32-bit connection ID space becomes insufficient and is automatically upgraded to 64-bit connection IDs. During the upgrade process, existing business and established connections are unaffected. However, subsequent new connections cannot be terminated using Control+C in the MySQL command-line.\n\nWarning\n\nThe table lock is an experimental feature. It is not recommended that you use it in the production environment.\n\nWarning\n\n\"TLSv1.0\" and \"TLSv1.1\" protocols are deprecated in TiDB v7.6.0, and will be removed in v8.0.0.\n\nNote\n\nStarting from v6.6.0, TiDB supports Resource Control. You can use this feature to execute SQL statements with different priorities in different resource groups. By configuring proper quotas and priorities for these resource groups, you can gain better scheduling control for SQL statements with different priorities. When resource control is enabled, statement priority will no longer take effect. It is recommended that you use Resource Control to manage resource usage for different SQL statements.\n\nNote\n\nStarting from v6.6.0, TiDB supports Resource Control.

In addition, using * might also cause the internal component that directly connects to TiDB (such as TiDB Dashboard) to be unavailable."
