        "text": "Starting in Phases 2a (equities) and 2b (options), orders received or originated prior to the date on which an Industry Member is required to begin reporting to the CAT and any subsequent events related to such orders, including those occurring on or after the required reporting date, are not required to be reported to the CAT. However, Industry Members may submit to the CAT events related to orders received or originated prior to the required reporting date and they will not be rejected.\n\nFor Phase 2a/2b reporting, if an Industry member chooses to optionally report subsequent events related to such orders, the orderKeyDate field must be populated with a date prior to the date on which the Industry Member is required to begin reporting to CAT, and the Industry Member will receive a warning that the Order Key references a date prior to CAT go-live. If the Industry Member populates the orderKeyDate field with a date on or after the date on which the Industry Member is required to begin reporting to CAT, the Industry Member will receive an error that the Order Key is not found.\n\nFor Phase 2a/2b reporting, if the sending firm chooses not to report the activity, but the receiving firm reports an MEOA to CAT, both parties will receive a linkage error as the CAT Plan Processor would have no way to distinguish that the original order was received by the receiving firm prior to CAT go-live. In this case, both parties that received an error should contact the FINRA CAT Help Desk. Industry Members should note that this issue will only impact CAT Reportable Events for orders received prior to the start of CAT reporting (June 22, 2020 for equities and July 20, 2020 for simple electronic options), which are routed on or after the date when interfirm linkage processing becomes effective (July 27, 2020 in Industry Test Environment and August 10, 2020 in the Production Environment).\n\nStarting in Phase 2c, for orders that originated/generated prior to April 26, 2021 and that remain open on April 26, 2021, Industry Members would be required to report any subsequent events in accordance with applicable Phase 2c reporting requirements. For example, if a trailing stop order received on March 3, 2021 remains open on April 26, 2021, then the Industry Member would be required to report an Order Effective event when all underlying conditions are met (e.g., the trailing stop is triggered) in accordance with Phase 2c requirements instead of via an Order Modified event (MEOM), as was required in Phase 2a. (See FAQ B62 for information related to the reporting requirements for Trailing Stop and Trailing Stop Limit orders.)\n\nStarting in Phase 2d, for orders that originated/generated prior to December 13, 2021 and that remain open on December 13, 2021, Industry Members would be required to report any subsequent events in accordance with applicable Phase 2d reporting requirements. For example, on December 14, 2021, a customer requests a modification or cancellation to a GTC order that was originally generated on October 5, 2021. In this example, the Industry Member must also capture the time that the cancellation or modification request was received from the customer either in the requestTimestamp field in the Order Modified event (MEOM) or Order Cancelled event (MEOC), as applicable, or in separate Order Modification Request event (MEOMR) or Order Cancel Request event (MEOCR), as outlined in the Reporting Technical Specifications for Industry Members document.\n\nFor orders that remain open on or after December 13, 2021, and that were not required to be reported prior to Phase 2d, then the subsequent events associated with such orders are not required to be reported if the primary event(s) associated with such activity was not reportable prior to Phase 2d. The Industry Member may choose to optionally report such secondary events to the CAT, but must populate the orderKeyDate field with a date prior to December 13, 2021, and the Industry Member will receive a warning that the Order Key references a date prior to CAT go-live. If the Industry Member populates the orderKeyDate field with a date on or after December 13, 2021, then the Industry Member will receive an error that the Order Key is not found.\n\nFor example, a Multi-Leg Order was generated on December 9, 2021and was not required to be reported to CAT prior to Phase 2d. The order remains open on December 14, 2021, when the Industry Member routes the Multileg Order to an exchange. The route is not required to be reported, as it relates to an order that was originated/generated and not reportable prior to Phase 2d. The Industry Member may optionally choose to report the route to an exchange via the Multi-Leg Order Route event (MLOR), but must populate the orderKeyDate field with December 9, 2021, the Order Key of the primary event which is being routed. The same guidance would apply to any other subsequent events on the multi-leg order.\n\nThe reporting obligation for the equity legs of complex orders beginning in Phase 2a is as follows. If a complex order includes an equity leg and the terms and conditions of the order are contingent upon the related option trade, the equity leg must be reported using the handlingInstructions value of ‘OPT’ starting in Phase 2a. This reporting obligation applies regardless of whether the complex order is split or not split into components.\n\nSpecifically, for a complex order that is routed or received as a complex order and not split into its constituent equity and option legs, the Industry Member must report the equity leg to the CAT in Phase 2a with the ‘OPT’ handlingInstructions value. For a complex order that is routed or received as a complex order and then split into its constituent equity and option legs and routed, the Industry Member must report the equity leg to the CAT in Phase 2a with the ‘OPT’ handlingInstructions value.\n\nIn Phases 2a and 2c, if the complex order contains a net price, Industry Members may report the receipt and route of the equity leg as either a market order, or as a limit order with a price of ‘0’ in accordance with FAQ B58 so long as the handlingInstructions field is populated with a value of ‘OPT’ (refer to FAQ E13 for additional information regarding the handlingInstructions requirements on Order Route events for the equity leg of a complex order). In Phases 2a and 2c, CAT will interpret the combination of a market order with a handlingInstructions value of ‘OPT’, or a limit order with a price of ‘0’ and a handlingInstructions value of 'OPT' as an order with a net price. In Phase 2d, a net price will be required. Refer to the Industry Member Reporting Scenarios document for additional information.\n\nIndustry Members will be required to report any simple option leg of a complex order in Phase 2b if the complex order has been split and is being worked as individual legs. Industry Members will be required to report complex orders that include both equity and option components to the CAT in Phase 2d. These reporting obligations apply to both FINRA and non-FINRA members that are Industry Members.\n\nAs stated in FAQ B44, any equity bid or offer that is accessible electronically by customers or other market participants and is immediately actionable (i.e., no further manual or electronic action is required by the responder providing the quote in order to execute or cause a trade to be executed) is reportable starting in Phase 2c; and any listed option bid or offer which is accessible electronically by customers or other market participants and is immediately actionable (i.e., no further action is required by the responder providing the quote in order to execute or cause a trade to be executed ) is reportable starting in Phase 2d. Accordingly, any response to an RFQ or other form of solicitation response provided in a standard electronic format (i.e. FIX) that meets this definition would be reportable starting in Phase 2c for equities and Phase 2d for options.\n\nResponses communicated in standard electronic format are reportable by both the CAT Reporter issuing the RFQ or solicitation (solicitor) and the CAT Reporter responding to the RFQ or solicitation (responder). Specifically, the solicitor must report the receipt of all responses, even those that were not ultimately selected.\n\nIt is important to note that regardless of the form (electronic or manual) of any RFQ or solicitation response, all orders received or originated as the result of such RFQ or solicitation process must be reported as set forth in the CAT Reporting Technical Specifications for Industry Members. For equities, both manual and electronic orders must be reported starting in Phase 2a. For options, simple, electronic orders must be reported starting in Phase 2b and all other orders, including manual, complex and paired orders, are reportable starting in Phase 2d.\n\nExample 1:\n\nA CAT Reporter issues an RFQ through a 3rd party vendor RFQ platform not operated by a broker-dealer. In response to the RFQ, multiple CAT Reporters respond by sending FIX messages directly to the requesting CAT Reporter. Upon selection of a response (either by the trader or automatically by the firm’s trading system), the FIX order from the winning bidder is executed (manually or electronically) OR is routed (manually or electronically) to another broker-dealer or exchange for execution without any further action required by the winning bidder.\n\nThe electronically provided responses are reportable by all bidders, even those that were not selected, starting in Phase 2c for equities and Phase 2d for options. Further, the CAT Reporter that issued the RFQ would report the receipt of all responses, as well as any subsequent actions taken to process the order starting in Phase 2a for equities, Phase 2b for simple, electronic orders and Phase 2d for all other options orders.\n\nExample 2:\n\nA CAT Reporter issues an RFQ and receives several quotes in response through a 3rd party vendor RFQ platform not operated by a broker-dealer. Upon selection of a response, the CAT Reporter either:\n\ninitiates and routes an order electronically to the winning bidder,\n\nthe RFQ platform automatically sends a routed order to the winning bidder, or\n\nthe winning bidder has standing instructions to create a new order acceptance once it receives a message from the RFQ platform that it has won.\n\nBecause the RFQ responses were sent through an RFQ platform and not via standard electronic format directly to the solicitor/CAT Reporter, none of the responses are reportable in 2c.\n\nHowever, the origination of the new order by the solicitor/CAT Reporter, the route of that new order to the winning bidder, and the acceptance of that order by the winning bidder are all reportable events in the phase that order would otherwise become reportable. The solicitor/CAT Reporter would report the new order and route events; the winning bidder would report the order acceptance, as well as any subsequent actions taken to process the order.\n\nExample 3\n\nA CAT Reporter issues an RFQ through a 3rd party vendor RFQ platform not operated by a broker-dealer. In response to the RFQ, multiple CAT Reporters respond by sending FIX messages directly to the requesting CAT Reporter’s OMS. Upon selection of a response, the solicitor CAT Reporter either:\n\ninitiates and routes an order electronically to the winning bidder,\n\nthe RFQ platform automatically sends a routed order to the winning bidder, or\n\nthe winning bidder has standing instructions to create a new order acceptance once it receives a message from the RFQ platform that it has won.\n\nAlthough the RFQ responses were sent via standard electronic format directly to the solicitor/CAT Reporter’s OMS/EMS, the responses are not reportable in Phase 2c because the CAT Reporters sending the responses would be required to take additional action by accepting a separate order from the requestor before any execution can occur, and would therefore not be considered immediately actionable.\n\nHowever, the origination of the new order by the solicitor/CAT Reporter, the route of that new order to the winning bidder, and the acceptance of that order by the winning bidder are all reportable events in the phase that order would otherwise become reportable. The solicitor/CAT Reporter would report the new order and route events; the winning bidder would report the order acceptance, as well as any subsequent actions taken to process the order.\n\nExample 4\n\nAn Asset Manager (non-CAT Reporter) issues and receives several quotes in response through a 3rd party vendor RFQ platform that is not part of any CAT Reporter’s OMS/EMS. Upon selection of a response, the Asset Manager either:\n\nsends a new order request electronically to the winning bidder,\n\nthe RFQ platform automatically sends the new order request to the winning bidder, or\n\nthe winning bidder has standing instructions to create a new order for this Asset Manager once it receives a message from the RFQ platform that it has won.\n\nBecause the RFQ responses were sent through an RFQ platform and not via standard electronic format directly to or from a CAT Reporter’s OMS/EMS, none of the responses are reportable in Phase 2c or Phase 2d.\n\nHowever, the receipt of the order from the Asset Manager, as well as any subsequent actions taken by the winning bidder to process the order are reportable events in the phase that order would otherwise become reportable.\n\nFor CAT reporting purposes, a Trailing Stop order allows the stop price to increase (or decrease) by a predetermined amount or formula (e.g., a specified dollar amount, a percentage of the market price, or some other predetermined criteria) as the market price of the security advances (or declines). Once the Trailing Stop price is triggered, the sell (or buy) order becomes either an executable market order or a limit order (e.g., a Trailing Stop Limit order).\n\nIn Phase 2a/2b, Industry Members are required to report a New Order event or New Option Order event (MENO or MONO) with a handlingInstructions value of ‘TS’ (Trailing Stop) representing receipt or origination of the Trailing Stop order. When the market price hits or goes through the highest (or lowest) calculated Trailing Stop Price, Industry Members are also required to report an Order Modified event or Option Order Modified event (MEOM or MOOM) with applicable updates to the price field. The MEOM/MOOM must not have a handlingInstructions value of ‘TS’ since the underlying condition of the order was triggered and the order is no longer a Trailing Stop order. Industry Members are not required to report additional MEOM/MOOM events each time the predetermined amount or formula is recalculated. The Industry Member is also required to report any subsequent actions taken on the order (e.g., executing, routing away or canceling).\n\nIn Phase 2c (equities) and Phase 2d (options), Industry Members will still be required to report a New Order event or New Option Order event (MENO or MONO) with a handlingInstructions value of ‘TS’ representing receipt or origination of the Trailing Stop order. Industry Members will also be required to report an Order Effective event or Option Order Effective event (MEOE or MOOE) when all underlying conditions (i.e., the Trailing Stop) are met and the order becomes and remains effective instead of an MEOM/MOOM (as required in Phase 2a/Phase 2b). Additionally, beginning December 5, 2022, the Multi-Leg Order Effective event (MLOE) is required to be reported to indicate that a multi-leg order, or an underlying condition of a multi-leg order, has become effective. The triggerPrice field on the MEOE/MOOE/MLOE event must be populated at the highest (or lowest) calculated trailing stop price. Refer to the Industry Member Reporting Scenarios document for additional information.\n\nSee also:\n\n• See FAQ B57 regarding how the orderType and handlingInstructions fields must be populated for Trailing Stop and Trailing Stop Limit orders.\n\n• See FAQ B60 regarding which party has the obligation to report the Order Effective event/Option Order Effective event/Multi-Leg Order Effective event (MEOE/MOOE/MLOE) to CAT.\n\n• See FAQ B63 for information on how the initiator field should be populated if an Industry Member modifies or cancels an order based on implicit customer instructions communicated with the order.\n\nIn an Order Modified and Cancel/Replace event (MEOM), the initiator field indicates who initiated the order modification. In an Order Cancelled event (MEOC), the initiator field indicates who initiated the order cancellation. If an implicit, unsolicited modification or cancellation action is taken by an Industry Member based on inferred customer instructions (e.g., Industry Member cancels an order associated with a particular ATS Order Type that articulates an expiry time), then the initiator field must be populated with a value of ‘F’ (Initiated by the firm).\n\nSimilarly, for actions initiated by the Industry Member unilaterally as a direct result of customer modifications or cancellations, such the cancellation of a representative order following the customer’s cancellation of the associated client order held at the firm, or the modification of an Internal Route following the customer’s modification of the associated client order held at the firm, then the initiator field must likewise be populated with a value of ‘F’ (Initiated by the firm).\n\nFor example, a customer requests that Industry Member Broker 1 cancel an order for which Broker 1 had previously generated an associated representative order. While the Order Cancelled event (MEOC) associated with the client order held at Broker 1 would be denoted with ‘C’ (as the cancellation was initiated by the customer), the cancellation of the corresponding representative order by Broker 1 would be denoted with ‘F’, as the cancellation was initiated by the Industry Member.\n\nThe same guidance applies for Trailing Stop and Trailing Stop Limit orders routed between Industry Members in Phase 2a. For example, Industry Member Broker 1 originates a Trailing Stop order, which is then routed to and accepted by Market Maker 2. Market Maker 2 monitors the market conditions and is holding the order at the time the market price hits or goes through the highest (or lowest) calculated Trailing Stop Price, at which point Market Maker 2 unilaterally routes the order to an exchange for execution based on the implicit instructions communicated with the Trailing Stop order upon receipt. In this example, Market Maker 2 reports the triggering event in Phase 2a via an MEOM event, with the initiator flag populated with ‘F’, and the receiverIMID, senderIMID, senderType, routedOrderID left blank, as Broker 1 did not communicate modification instructions to Market Maker 2 at the time of trigger. Note, reporting requirements for Trailing Stop orders change in Phase 2c (see FAQ B62).\n\nB57 and the Stop Orders section of Industry Member Technical Specifications note that the handling instruction of ‘STOP’ denotes the stop price and requires a numeric value representing the stop price (e.g., STOP=1.00). In instances where it is known that the order is a stop order, but the exact stop price is unknown because it is either based on an underlying condition or will be determined by the destination venue, Industry Members may populate a handlingInstructions value of ‘STOPF’.\n\nStarting in Phase 2c (equities) and 2d (options), in scenarios where the trigger price was not explicitly captured in the handlingInstructions field on the related new order or in order accepted events (e.g. Stop Formula, Trailing Stop), then the triggerPrice field must be populated on the Order Effective event/Option Order Effective event (MEOE or MOOE) to reflect the stop price.\n\nExample 1:\n\nConditional Order A is originated by Industry Member Broker 1 specifying that a stop price be calculated only after Order B is executed. In this example, Broker 1 reports a New Order event (MENO) event with the ‘STOPF’ and ‘CND’ handlingInstructions values. Broker 2 is holding the order at the time all underlying conditions of the order (Order B being executed and then the triggering of the Stop) are met, at which point Broker 1 would report an MEOE event with the stop price in the triggerPrice field.\n\nExample 2:\n\nA stop order is originated by Industry Member Broker 1 and routed to Industry Member Broker 2 with instructions communicated that the stop price be set at Ask-5 (Ask minus $5.00). Broker 1 relies on Broker 2 to calculate the stop price. Upon order acceptance, Broker 2 uses its market data feeds to determine that $5.00 from the current market price of the security is $10.00. In this example, Broker 1 reports a New Order event (MENO) event with the ‘STOPF’ handlingInstructions value, and Broker 2 would report an Order Accepted event (MEOA) with the stop price determined by Broker 2 upon acceptance of the order (e.g., STOP=10.00). Broker 2 is holding the order at the time the stop was triggered and (starting in Phase 2c) reports the MEOE event. Since the stop price was captured on the MEOA event, the MEOE event does not require a triggerPrice.\n\nSee also:\n\nSee FAQ B57 regarding how the orderType and handlingInstructions fields must be populated for Stop, Stop Limit, Stop on Quote, Stop Limit on Quote, Trailing Stop, and Trailing Stop Limit orders.\n\nSee FAQ B59 for information related to the reporting requirements when a Stop, Stop Limit, Stop on Quote, or Stop Limit on Quote order is triggered.\n\nSee FAQ B60 regarding which party has the obligation to report the Order Effective event/Option Order Effective event (MEOE/MOOE) to CAT.\n\nSee FAQ B62 for information related to the reporting requirements for Trailing Stop and Trailing Stop Limit orders.\n\nSee FAQ B66 regarding when the Order Effective event/Option Order Effective event (MEOE/MOOE) is required to be reported to CAT.\n\nSee FAQ B67 for information related to Stop orders when the exact stop price is unknown because it is either based on an underlying condition or will be determined by the destination venue.\n\nSee FAQ D26 regarding ‘CND’ and ‘CMC’ handlingInstructions.\n\nIf an equity order is tied to stock, fixed income, futures, or another product that is not reportable to CAT at a net price (or other formula such as a specific delta no later than Phase 2d), Industry Members must populate the appropriate handlingInstructions value of ‘TTS’, ‘TTF’, ‘TTO’, ‘TTU’, or ‘FUT’. This activity does not meet the definition of a multi-leg order, as these trading strategies do not contain an option leg, and must continue to be reported to CAT as equity order events in Phase 2d.\n\nIf a simple equity is tied to a simple option at a net price (or other formula such as a specific delta no later than Phase 2d) as part of a pairs trading strategy that does not meet the definition of a multi-leg order, the equity order must contain a handlingInstructions value of ‘TTSO’, and the option must contain a handlingInstructions value of ‘TTS’.\n\nThe equity leg of a multi-leg order is reportable in Phase 2a/2b/2c, and must include the handlingInstructions value of 'OPT', as outlined in FAQ B12. This activity will be reported to CAT as multi-leg order events in Phase 2d, and the handlingInstructions values ‘OPT’ and ‘TTSO’ will not be required to be captured on multi-leg order events.\n\nIf a single, simple option order is tied to futures, fixed income, or another product that is not reportable to CAT, Industry Members must populate the appropriate handlingInstructions values of ‘TTF’, ‘TTO’, or ‘FUT’ in Phase 2b.\n\nIf an option order is tied to stock and meets the definition of a multi-leg order, Industry Members will be required to report this activity to CAT in Phase 2d. The handlingInstructions value of ‘TTS’ will not be required to be captured on multi-leg order events.\n\nWhile this multi-leg activity may be optionally reported to CAT beginning in Phase 2b, the option legs must be reported as simple option events with a handlingInstructions value of ‘CMPX’. The handlingInstructions value of ‘TTS’ is not required.\n\nBeginning in Phase 2d, Industry Members will be required to populate the netPrice field on equity or simple option order events with the net price of the order if the order is tied to stock, fixed income, futures, or another product that is not reportable to CAT at a net price. The netPrice field will not be required if the order is tied to stock, fixed income, futures, or another product that is not reportable to CAT with another formula such as a specific delta.\n\nIf an issue symbol is delisted and is no longer tradable on any market because the security is no longer valid, then no MEOC is required for GTC orders in that symbol, as this scenario would be considered an implicit cancellation. Industry Members choosing to optionally report this activity should be mindful that any errors received as a result of the symbol having been delisted on the Event Date would not be repairable.\n\nSimilarly, if a corporate action (e.g., merger/acquisition) occurs in which a security is no longer valid, and the symbol becomes associated with a new security, no MEOC would be required for the original security. For example, if there is an open GTC order in symbol ABC and ABC is acquired and no longer trades on any market, no MEOC is required.\n\nHowever, explicit cancellations are required for any cancelled GTC orders and are reportable using the symbol on the list in the following scenarios.\n\n• If the issue symbol changed and there is no change to the underlying security. For example, if a security trades under symbol ABC and changes its symbol to XYZ. A cancel event is not required for ABC (the original order) but would be required for the new symbol, XYZ.\n\n• The symbol was delisted from one market and continued to trade on another market (either under the same symbol or a different symbol). For example, ABC traded over-the-counter and then listed on an Exchange under a new symbol XYZ. A cancel event is not required for ABC (the original order) but would be required for the new symbol, XYZ.\n\nIndustry Members are responsible for identifying material changes to an underlying security from corporate action announcements and taking appropriate action to ensure compliance with their books and records and CAT transaction reporting requirements.\n\nA mass cancellation is any process by which an execution venue (such as an ATS or exchange) automatically cancels all open orders or a group of open orders resulting from the receipt of a single mass cancellation message, whether communicated electronically or manually. Industry Members are not required, but may optionally choose, to report Route Cancelled events to CAT resulting from a mass cancellation message if the execution venue receiving the mass cancellation instruction is a CAT Reporter. If the mass cancellation instruction is sent to a foreign destination or other destination that is not a CAT Reporter, the Industry Member must report the Route Cancelled events to CAT.\n\nAll orders routed to an execution venue and subsequently cancelled by the sender without the use of a mass cancellation message/instruction must be reported to CAT as individual Route Cancelled events.\n\nExample 1: Exchange Member 1 routed orders to Exchange A on session EX1 and Exchange A accepted them all. Due to a connectivity issue, Exchange Member 1 must call Exchange A to cancel all open orders routed on session EX1. Exchange A verifies verbally that all orders on this session are cancelled but Exchange Member 1’s OMS cannot generate Route Cancelled events for the non-electronic/manual mass cancellation. Exchange Member 1 is not required to report Route Cancelled events in this case.\n\nExample 2: Exchange Member 1 routed orders to Exchange A on session EX1 and Exchange A accepted them all. For expediency, Exchange Member 1 sends an electronic mass cancel request to Exchange A to cancel all open orders routed on session EX1. Exchange A electronically cancels all open orders on this session. Exchange Member 1 is not required to report Route Cancelled events in this case.\n\nExample 3: US Broker-Dealer 2 routed orders to Foreign Exchange B on session EX2 and Exchange B accepted them all. For expediency, Broker Dealer 2 sends an electronic mass cancel request to Foreign Exchange B to cancel all open orders routed on session EX2. Foreign Exchange B electronically cancels all open orders on this session. In this case, Broker Dealer 2 is required to report all Route Cancelled events in CAT reportable symbols.\n\nFor CAT reporting purposes, the accountHolderType value of market maker (value ‘O’) is used to identify orders originated by registered market makers or firms displaying quotes on an IDQS in their market making account. The value of ‘O’ must be used for all activity in the firm’s market making account for a security in which it is registered, regardless of where the order is ultimately routed or executed, or whether the activity is directly related to maintenance of a firm’s market making obligations. For example, block facilitation and hedging activity in the market making account in a security the firm is a registered market maker should also be reported as ‘O’.\n\nBecause options market making is currently defined and identified through use of the OCC clearing range, a separate CAT reporting guideline for the use of the accountHolderType of 'O’ for options orders has been mandated.\n\nThe accountHolderType value of 'O’ is not intended to identify all forms of market making under various rules, such as short sales rules, Volker, etc. Further, it is not intended to identify all trading in any proprietary account that may be used for market making activity, including hedging activity in securities for which a firm is not a registered market maker or block positioning in securities for which the firm is not a registered market maker. It is also not intended to identify proprietary activity in securities in which a firm is registered as a market maker that originate from desks other than the Market Making Desk. For example, activity occurring on a program desk that is walled off from the market making desk in securities that a firm is a registered market should be marked with an ‘accountHolderType’ value of ‘P’ (Other Proprietary).\n\nSpecifically:\n\nFor CAT reporting purposes only, the accountHolderType value 'O' (Market Making) should be used as follows:\n\nSimple Equities: The value 'O' should be used for any order originated in an Industry Member’s market making account in a security for which the Industry Member is registered as a market maker, designated market maker, lead market maker or similar capacity on a national securities exchange or in which the Industry Member displays quotations on an IDQS in an unlisted stock.\n\nSimple Options: The value 'O' should be used for any order originated in an account of the Industry Member that clears in the OCC clearing range of 'M'.\n\nComplex Options: The value ‘O’ should be used for any order originated in an account of the Industry Member where the option leg(s) clear(s) in the OCC clearing range of ‘M’. This guidance is also applicable to the equity leg of a complex option in Phase 2d when complex orders become reportable to CAT.\n\nIn Phases 2a, 2b and 2c, the values of ‘P’ (Other Proprietary) or ‘O’ (Market Making) are both acceptable for the accountHolderType value for the equity leg of the complex order.\n\nSee FAQ B68 for more information on how to populate the accountHolderType field if an Industry Member uses the same account for both market making and non-market making proprietary activity.\n\nIn Phases 2a/2b/2c, these orders must be reported to CAT with a handlingInstructions value of ‘CNH’, denoting Cash Not Held. Starting in Phase 2d, these orders must be reported to CAT with a handlingInstructions value of ‘CASH’, denoting the “cash” order. If the order was also Not Held, the handlingInstructions value of ‘NH’ must also be populated.\n\nAdditionally, until December 5, 2022, they must be reported to CAT with a quantity equal to the number of shares that could be purchased with the specified dollar amount based on the best available market at the time of order receipt. For example, if an Industry Member receives a “cash” order for $1,000 when the best available market is $20, then the Industry Member must report a quantity of 50 in the New Order event or Order Accepted event.\n\nStarting December 5, 2022, Industry Members must begin reporting the ‘CASH’ handlingInstructions with the notional value of the order and may report a quantity value of ‘0’ instead of a calculated quantity. Industry Members should note that the option to report a calculated quantity for “cash” orders will be eliminated starting December 11, 2023, and Industry Members will be required to report a quantity value of ‘0’.\n\nIndustry Members need not submit an Order Modified event to reflect a change in share quantity due to market fluctuations during the life of the order. However, if a customer changes the dollar amount resulting in a partial cancellation, then an Order Modified event with a handlingInstructions value of ‘CASH’ must be reported to CAT to reflect that change. Order Cancelled and Order Adjusted events may not be used to report a change in dollar amount. Full cancellations of a “cash” order must be reported using an Order Cancelled event with a cancelQty of ‘0’ and leavesQty of ‘0’.\n\nThe infoBarrierID field allows firms to uniquely identify on an order-by-order basis each information barrier that meets the criteria of the “no-knowledge” exception for certain proprietary trading activity under FINRA Rule 5320. By identifying specific information barriers that are in place with respect to individual orders, both customer and proprietary, Industry Members will provide CAT with information that can be used when conducting reviews of compliance with FINRA Rule 5320. Specifically, on all events for orders received or originated at a desk or department with an information barrier in place, Industry Members must populate the infoBarrierID with the value assigned by the Industry Member to the specific information barrier in instances where the firm is claiming the “no-knowledge” exception. The use of this field allows each customer and proprietary order to be identified with a particular information barrier.\n\nFor example, if an Industry Member has two or more separate desks or departments that share a single information barrier, orders received or originated at these separate desks or departments may be reported to CAT with the same unique infoBarrierID. If, alternatively, an Industry Member has separate desks or departments that are not within the same information barrier, orders received or originated at these desks or departments would be reported to CAT with different Information Barrier IDs. Finally, if an order is received or originated within an Industry Member that has no information barriers in place, those orders must be reported to CAT with the inforBarrierID field left blank. To the extent that Industry Members populate the infoBarrierID field, the use of values must remain consistent. Therefore, once used, a value may not be reassigned to identify a different information barrier.\n\nReporting Scenarios\n\nScenario #1 – Desks or Departments Sharing an Information Barrier\n\n• Example: Firm A has a customer facing desk (Desk 1) and a proprietary desk (Desk 2) within the same information barrier that the firm has named “AB12”. Desk 1 receives an order from a customer and Desk 2 originates a proprietary order. The CAT reporting would be as follows:\n\nDesk 1: MENO from customerinfoBarrierID: AB12Desk 2: MENO proprietary orderinfoBarrierID: AB12\n\nScenario #2 – Desks or Departments Separated by Information Barriers\n\n• Example: Firm A has a customer facing desk (Desk 1) that is within an information barrier the firm has named “U89T” and a proprietary desk (Desk 2) that is within an information barrier the firm has named “4RYH”. Desk 1 receives an order from a customer and Desk 2 originates a proprietary order. The CAT reporting would be as follows:\n\nDesk 1: MENO from customerinfoBarrierID: U89TDesk 2: MENO proprietary orderinfoBarrierID: 4RYH\n\nScenario #3 – Desks or Departments with No Information Barriers Example:\n\n• Example: Firm A has a customer facing desk (Desk 1) and a proprietary desk (Desk 2), neither of which have information barriers in place. Desk 1 receives an order from a customer and Desk 2 originates a proprietary order. The CAT reporting would be as follows:\n\nDesk 1: MENO from customerinfoBarrierID: BlankDesk 2: MENO proprietary orderinfoBarrierID: Blank\n\nIn Phase 2a, if an order is received or originated with instructions to work the order using a Trading Algorithm as defined in the Industry Member Technical Specifications, a handlingInstructions value of 'ALG' should be populated on the New Order or Order Accepted event submitted to CAT along with any additional relevant handlingInstructions. For example, customer orders received with a counterparty restriction instruction and instructions to work using a trading algorithm should be reported to CAT using handlingInstructions values of ‘CPR’ and ‘ALG.’ Additionally, customer orders received with instructions to execute at TWAP or VWAP would be considered instructions to work the order using a trading algorithm and therefore any orders received with these instructions should be reported to CAT using a handlingInstructions value of ‘ALG.’ Firms should note that more granular handlingInstructions values may be required in future phases of CAT.\n\nStarting in Phase 2c, Industry Members will be required to populate the ‘ALG’ handlingInstructions value on Order Route events for orders that were sent to another broker-dealer with instructions to handle the order using a specific trading algo. The ‘ALG’ handlingInstructions value must not be used on routes that are sent by an algo. The same guidance for Order Route events outlined above applies to the ‘ALGMod’ handlingInstructions value. Specifically that the ‘ALGMod’ value should not be used on routes that are sent resulting from the use of a different trading algorithm or a change in the settings of the algorithm.\n\nExample 1: Broker 1 receives a customer order with instructions to handle the order using a specific proprietary algo. Broker 1 then sends the order through its algo, and the algo routes the orders to the street. In this example, Broker 1 is required to report ‘ALG’ on its MENO from the customer. ‘ALG’ must not be populated on the routes made by the algo.\n\nExample 2: Broker 1 receives a customer order with instructions to handle the order using a specific algo at another broker-dealer. Broker 1 routes the order to Broker 2, who sends the order through its algo. In this example, Broker 1 is required to report ‘ALG’ on its MENO and MEOR (in Phase 2c) to Broker 2. Broker 2 is required to report ‘ALG’ on its MEOA. ‘ALG’ must not be populated on the MEORs for the routes made by the algo.\n\nExample 3: Broker 1 receives a Not-Held customer order. The trader uses discretion and determines to route the order through a specific proprietary algo. ‘ALG’ must not be populated on the MENO in this scenario, since the order was not received with the instruction to handle the order via an algo. At a future date, a new field will be added to the MENO to indicate that an Industry Member applied discretion to use an algorithm in the absence of a customer instruction. ‘ALG’ must not be populated on the MEORs for the routes made by the algo.\n\nExample 4: Broker 1 receives a Not-Held customer order. The trader uses discretion and determines to route the order to a specific algo at another broker-dealer. Broker 1 routes the order to Broker 2, who sends the order through its algo. ‘ALG’ must not be populated on Broker 1’s MENO in this scenario, since the order was not received with the instruction to handle the order via an algo. ‘ALG’ must be populated on Broker 1’s MEOR and Broker 2’s MEOA, as the instruction to handle the order using a specific algo was applied and passed by the trader who had discretion over the order. ‘ALG’ must not be populated for the routes made by the algo.\n\nYes, if the Industry Member routes an order to another Industry Member or a Participant, the Industry Member must report the routing of the order to the CAT. The details that must be reported for the routing of an order are set forth in Section 6.3(d)(ii) of the CAT NMS Plan, as applied to Industry Members by Section 6.4(d)(i) of the CAT NMS Plan. While all routes are required to be reported to CAT, Order Route events for orders that were rejected by the Industry Member or Participant to which the order was routed are not required to be reported in Phases 2a (equity) or 2b (options).\n\nBeginning in Phases 2c (equity) and 2d (options), Industry Members will be required to report an Order Route event with the routeRejectedFlag populated as 'true.' An Order Route Supplement Event may be used in Phase 2c or 2d to populate the routeRejectedFlag. Further, beginning in Phase 2d, if a request to modify or cancel a route that was sent to another broker-dealer, exchange or ATS is rejected, Industry Members are required to report a Route Modified (MEMR)/Route Cancelled (MECR) event with the routeRejectedFlag populated as 'true.' A Route Modified Supplement (MEMRS)/Route Cancelled Supplement (MECRS) event may optionally be used to populate the routeRejectedFlag.\n\nIf an Industry Member chooses to optionally report an Order Route event for a rejected route early in Phases 2a or 2b, the routeRejectedFlag must be populated as ‘true’. As with all data reported to the CAT, Phase 2c or 2d activity voluntarily reported in Phase 2a or 2b must be timely, accurate and complete and will be included in the firm’s error rate. Any Order Route event representing a rejected route that is optionally reported in Phase 2a or 2b with a routeRejectedFlag of ‘false’ will result in an unlinked event that must be corrected and resubmitted accordingly.\n\nThe CAT reporting requirements depend on what reporting error(s) the Industry Member made as well as whether the FINRA Facility allows a trade report to be corrected without cancelling the original trade report. The different FINRA Facilities have different functionality with regards to correcting and cancelling trade reports. For more information on reporting cancellations, corrections, and reversals to the TRF/ADF/ORF, see Section 311 of FINRA’s Trade Reporting FAQs.\n\nBelow are descriptions and CAT reporting requirement for four different trade cancellation and correction scenarios.\n\nScenario 1: An Industry Member executes a trade for 1,000 shares and correctly reports the MEOT to CAT for 1,000 shares but incorrectly reports the trade to a FINRA Facility for 100 shares. The FINRA Facility allows for corrections of trade reports without cancelling the original trade report and links the corrected trade report by reference to the original trade report. The Industry Member corrects the trade report to 1,000 shares without cancelling the original trade report and the Compliance ID or FINRA Control Number on the corrected trade report remains the same as the Compliance ID or FINRA Control Number on the original trade report.\n\nIn this scenario, the Industry Member is only required to report a single MEOT linking to the original trade report because the data in the MEOT was correct and it will link to the original trade report which will link by reference to the new trade report.\n\nScenario 2: An Industry Member executes a trade for 1,000 shares and correctly reports the MEOT to CAT for 1,000 shares but incorrectly reports the trade to a FINRA Facility for 100 shares. The FINRA Facility does not allow for corrections of trade reports so the Industry Member must cancel the original trade report and enter a new one. The Industry Member enters the same Branch Sequence Number on the corrected trade report as was on the original (cancelled) trade report.\n\nIn this scenario, the Industry Member is only required to report a single MEOT because the data in the MEOT was correct and it will link to both the original (cancelled) trade report and the new trade report via the tapeTradeID/Branch Sequence Number since the Industry Member entered the same Branch Sequence Number on the corrected trade report as was on the original (cancelled) trade report.\n\nScenario 3: At 10 am, an Industry Member executes a trade at 9.99 and reports the MEOT to CAT with a price of 9.99. At 10:01 am, the Industry Member then realizes that the trade should have been executed at 9.98 so it cancels the original trade report and enters a new trade report at 9.98 and execution time of 10:01 am.\n\nIn this scenario, the Industry Member is required to report two MEOTs- one linking to the original (cancelled) trade report and a second linking to the new trade report. Otherwise, the Industry Member will receive trade linkage errors.\n\nScenario 4: An Industry Member executes a trade for 1,000 shares but incorrectly reports the MEOT to CAT for 100 shares and incorrectly reports the trade to a FINRA Facility for 100 shares. The FINRA Facility allows for corrections of trade reports without cancelling the original trade report and links the corrected trade report by reference to the original trade report. The Industry Member corrects the trade report to 1,000 shares without cancelling the original trade report and the Compliance ID or FINRA Control Number on the corrected trade report remains the same as the Compliance ID or FINRA Control Number on the original trade report.\n\nIn this scenario, the Industry Member is required to link the MEOT for 100 shares to the original trade report for 100 shares and then submit a correction (actionType= ‘COR’) of the MEOT to correct the share quantity to 1,000 shares. The ‘COR’ MEOT will link to both the original trade report and the corrected trade report via the tapeTradeID/Compliance ID or FINRA Control Number since the Industry Member entered the same Branch Sequence Number on the corrected trade report as was on the original (cancelled) trade report.\n\nAs stated in FAQ F5, Industry Members are required to link a Representative Order with the underlying order(s) that it represents. There are limited instances where linkage is required at the client fill level rather than the order level using the Firm Designated ID (“FDID”) of the firm owned or controlled account from which the customer order was filled. Specifically, for orders that are originated in different systems that are not linked in an Industry Member’s systems, such as a customer order originated in an Order Management System (“OMS”) and represented by a principal order originated in an Execution Management System (“EMS”) that is not linked to the OMS, Industry Members are required to link the fill of the customer order to the FDID of the firm owned or controlled account that was used to originate and execute the Representative Order. Further, such Representative Orders must be reported to CAT with an indicator reflecting the order is eligible for customer fills from an unlinked system. Appendix C of the Industry Member Technical Specifications provides details of the required linkages in these workflows. Note that all Industry Members will be required to provide representative order linkages to unlinked OMS/EMS and position fill scenarios no later than January 31, 2025, due to the expiry of the exemptive relief issued by the SEC on November 2, 2023 with an effective date of November 20, 2023.\n\nThe only Representative Order workflow in which linkage is not required at either the order level or the fill level is that in which a firm receives a client order, guarantees an execution price (e.g., GVWAP) and then originates proprietary orders in an effort to work the client order. Because the client order may not ultimately be filled from the proprietary order(s) if the guaranteed price is not achieved, direct linkage is not required. Although direct linkage is not required to the client fill, the proprietary orders originated to work the client order must be marked as a Representative Order and designated as part of a price guarantee scenario. Appendix C of the Industry Member Technical Specifications provides the specific reporting requirements for price guarantee scenarios. Note that all Industry Members will be required to provide representative order linkages to unlinked OMS/EMS and position fill scenarios no later than January 31, 2025, due to the expiry of the exemptive relief issued by the SEC on November 2, 2023 with an effective date of November 20, 2023.\n\nEach time an Industry Member reprices a peg order based on a market move (e.g., when there is a change in the national best bid or offer or the best bid or offer on a particular exchange, as applicable based on the terms of the order), the Industry Member must report a price modification of the peg order to the CAT pursuant to Section 6.3(d) of the CAT NMS Plan, as applied to Industry Members by Section 6.4(d)(i) of the CAT NMS Plan, if the price is modified. If the Industry Member does not reprice a peg order when the market moves, the Industry Member does not need to report a modification of the peg order to the CAT since the order was not modified by either the customer or the Industry Member. For example, for both displayed and non-displayed alternative trading systems (ATSs), if an ATS’s matching engine reprices a peg order when the market moves, the price modification must be reported to the CAT. If a matching engine does not reprice a peg order when the market moves, there is no requirement to report a price modification to the CAT.\n\nExample 1: A display ATS receives a buy order with a primary peg instruction and a limit price of $10. The current market is 9.98 and accordingly, the order is displayed at 9.98. The NBB subsequently moves to 9.99. The ATS reprices the order and re-displays it at 9.99. The re-pricing of this order must be reported to CAT by the ATS.\n\nExample 2: An ATS receives a buy order with a primary peg instruction and a limit price of $10. The order is not displayable or routable and the ATS has no sell orders that are eligible to trade with the buy order. The NBB subsequently moves to 9.99 and the ATS receives no other sell orders that are eligible to trade with the buy order. The ATS takes no action on the open buy order when the NBB moves to 9.99, therefore there is no CAT reportable event.\n\nExample 3: An ATS receives a buy order with mid-point peg instruction when the NBBO is 9.85 x 10. The order is not displayable or routable and the ATS has no sell orders that are eligible to trade with the buy order. The NBBO subsequently moves to 9.90 x 10. The ATS then receives a market order to sell that is eligible to trade with the buy order and the two orders are crossed at 9.95. Because the ATS did not re-price the buy order prior to executing it, there is no CAT reportable event required to reflect a price modification of the buy order to 9.95.\n\nPursuant to Section 6.3(d) of the CAT NMS Plan (“Plan”), as applied to Industry Members by Section 6.4(d) of the Plan, Industry Members must report certain details to the CAT for each order and reportable event. These requirements are applied to Industry Members via each Plan Participant’s CAT Compliance Rules.\n\n“Order,” as used in the Plan and the CAT Compliance Rules, is defined by SEC Rule 613(j)(8) to include “[a]ny order received by a member of a national securities exchange or national securities association from any person; [a]ny order originated by a member of a national securities exchange or national securities association; or [a]ny bid or offer.” SEC Rule 300 more specifically defines “order” as “any firm indication of a willingness to buy or sell a security, as either principal or agent, including any bid or offer quotation, market order, limit order, or other priced order.” Note that neither indications of interest (“IOIs”) nor requests for quotes (“RFQs”) fall within the definition of an order. See, e.g., CAT FAQs B3 and B38. A “reportable event” is defined by SEC Rule 613(j)(9) to “include, but not be limited to, the original receipt or origination, modification, cancellation, routing, and execution (in whole or in part) of an order, and receipt of a routed order.”\n\nMessages sent through OTC Link ATS constitute “orders,” as defined above, for purposes of CAT reporting obligations to the extent such messages represent a “firm indication of a willingness to buy or sell a security.” OTC Link ATS and the OTC Link ATS broker-dealer subscribers are required to report all applicable CAT reportable events relating to such orders, both executed and unexecuted.\n\nAs set forth in Table 1 (Industry Specifications Phased Approach) of the Industry Member Technical Specifications, all OTC Link messages are reportable as orders starting in Phase 2d. Detailed reporting scenarios are available in the Phase 2d Industry Member Reporting Scenarios document.\n\nOTC Link trade messages directed by an OTC Link ATS subscriber to OTC Link ATS in response to a Global OTC quote meet the definition of an order. Because an immediately actionable order is sent to Global OTC as the result of an OTC Link message, the OTC Link ATS subscriber must report the order and route, even if the order is not ultimately executed. Under the Industry Member CAT Reporter phasing schedule, OTC Link ATS subscribers would have an obligation to report to CAT a New Order event and Order Route event for each OTC Link trade message directed by the OTC Link ATS subscriber to OTC Link ATS in response to a Global OTC quote, both executed and unexecuted, beginning in Phase 2a.\n\nHowever, the Participants are aware that not all Industry Members fully understood that OTC Link trade messages directed by the OTC Link ATS subscriber to OTC Link ATS in response to a Global OTC quote constitute orders (and not negotiations). Given this, the Participants are deferring until Phase 2c the obligation for OTC Link ATS subscribers to report these messages as set forth above. In other words, in Phase 2a, Industry Members can either:\n\n-Report OTC Link trade messages that they direct to OTC Link ATS in response to a Global OTC quote to CAT as negotiated trades. If an OTC Link trade message directed by an OTC Link ATS subscriber to OTC Link ATS in response to a Global OTC quote results in an execution, the OTC Link ATS subscriber would report a New Order event and a Trade event to CAT. While this may generate interfirm linkage errors beginning in October 2020, Industry Members will not be expected to correct such errors, and such errors will not be considered for Industry Member compliance purposes.\n\n-An Industry Member would have the option – but would not be required to – report a New Order event and Order Route event for these messages in Phase 2a.\n\nBeginning in Phase 2c, OTC Link ATS subscribers must report a New Order event and Order Route event to CAT for all OTC Link trade messages that they direct to OTC Link ATS in response to a Global OTC quote, both executed and unexecuted. Further, the Order Route event must indicate a route to OTC Link ATS and contain the handlingInstructions value ‘J3’. Global OTC would have an obligation to report an Order Accepted event indicating receipt from OTC Link ATS for each trade message received. Further, the handlingInstructions value on the Order Accepted event must contain the value ‘J3’. Since OTC Link ATS does not have a CAT reporting obligation in Phase 2c, the ‘J3’ handlingstructions value is designed to prevent interfirm linkage errors in Phase 2c. Beginning in Phase 2d, OTC Link ATS will report receipt of the order from its subscriber and the route to Global OTC. Thus, in Phase 2d, the handlingInstructions value ‘J3’ will no longer be required and will be removed as an allowable value.\n\nPlease refer to the Phase 2c and Phase 2d Industry Member Reporting Scenarios for additional details.\n\nOrders submitted directly to Global OTC by Global OTC subscribers are reportable as all other orders commencing in Phase 2a.\n\nTo provide flexibility, CAT will accept the net price of a multi-leg strategy order as either a “per unit” amount, “total strategy” or “total cash” amount.\n\nIn most cases, a multi-leg strategy is represented with the leg ratios in their simplest form, and the order quantity representing the number of strategy “units” the customer or firm is looking to execute. The “per unit” price represents each set of legs as defined in the CAT MLEG record.\n\nOrder Quantity 200 -$0.35 -$70.00 -$7,000.00 B/S Instrument Leg Ratio Leg Qty Bid Offer Leg Price Full leg px Cost Leg 1 B XYZ 220123C00055000 1 200 1.10 1.15 1.15 $230.00 $23,000.00 Leg 2 S XYZ 220318C00055000 1 200 1.50 1.55 -1.50 -$300.00 -$30,000.00\n\nThe “Per Unit” priceType value indicates that the price provided is for the leg ratio as defined in the legDetails block. This example is selling a calendar spread for a $0.35 net credit 200 times.\n\nOrder Qty = 200\n\nLeg 1: Buy 1 XYZ Jan calls @ 1.15\n\nLeg 2: Sell 1 XYZ Mar calls @ 1.50\n\nPer Unit net price = $.35 Credit\n\nThe “Total Strategy” priceType value indicates that the price provided on the event represents the total execution price of fully executing all legs.\n\nLeg 1: Buying 200 XYZ Jan calls @ 230\n\nLeg 2: Selling 200 XYZ Mar calls @ 300\n\nTotal Strategy net price = $70 Credit\n\nThe “Total Cash” priceType value indicates that the price provided on the event represents the total dollar price to fully execute and clear all legs. This includes the option multiplier (generally 100) for all option legs.\n\nLeg 1: Buying 200 XYZ Jan calls for $23,000\n\nLeg 2: Selling 200 XYZ Mar calls for $30,000\n\nTotal Cash net price = $7,000.00 Credit\n\nThese numbers are mathematically equivalent and simply allow flexibility in CAT reporting to match how orders may be held in some trading systems.\n\nEquity Leg Calculations\n\nOrder Quantity 2 $6.50 $13.00 $1,300.00 B/S Instrument Leg Ratio Leg Qty Bid Offer Leg Price Full leg px Cost Leg 1 B XYZ 75 150 9.98 10.00 7.50 $15.00 $1,500.00 Leg 2 S XYZ 220318C00010500 1 2 1.00 1.10 -1.00 -$2.00 -$200.00\n\nEquity legs prices are normalized to option pricing conventions in strategy level pricing, meaning that the ratio adjusted equity leg price is divided by 100 to give a ‘contract adjusted’ value.\n\nIn the example above, the “Per Unit” priceType value indicates that the price provided is for the leg ratio as defined in the legDetails block. This example is selling a call and buying the underlying stock for a $6.50 net debit.\n\nOrder Qty = 2\n\nLeg 1: Buy 75 XYZ @ 10 = $750/100 = 7.50\n\nLeg 2: Sell 1 XYZ Mar calls @ 1.00 = 1\n\nPer Unit net price = $3.50 Debit\n\nThe “Total Strategy” priceType value indicates that the price provided on the event represents the total execution price of fully executing all legs.\n\nLeg 1: Buying 150 XYZ @ 10 = 1500/100 = 15.00\n\nLeg 2: Selling 2 XYZ Mar calls @ 2.00\n\nTotal Strategy net price = $13 Debit\n\nThe “Total Cash” priceType value indicates that the price provided on the event represents the total dollar price to fully execute and clear all legs. This includes the option multiplier (generally 100) for all option legs. There is no multiplier for the equity leg.\n\nLeg 1: Buying 150 XYZ for $1500\n\nLeg 2: Selling 2 XYZ Mar calls for $200\n\nTotal Cash net price = $1300 Debit\n\nSome Industry Members have systems that allow for the entry of algorithmic strategy trading instructions with parameters that do not include all material terms of a CAT reportable order for any component security, such as quantity. If an Industry Member has given instructions for such a strategy and no further action is required on the Industry Member’s part to generate an order for a particular component security, the Industry Member is required to report a new order event (MONO or MENO) and an order route event (MOOR or MEOR) for each component security included in the strategy as eligible to trade, even though all the material terms for an order in a given component security may not be known at the time. The Industry Member receiving such instructions is required to report order accepted events for each component security included in the strategy, again, even though all the material terms for an order in a given component security may not be known at the time. Although all material terms may not be known, both Industry Members are to report those material terms discernable from the strategy instructions.\n\nExample 1\n\nBroker 1 uses a Vega algorithm provided by Broker 2 and within Broker 2’s system stipulates a list of 10 option series that are eligible for Broker 2 to generate orders to trade on Broker 1’s behalf. No further action is required on Broker 1’s part to generate any order for a particular series. Broker 1 would report a MONO and a MOOR for each option series provided in the list of eligible securities within the algorithmic parameters, even though all material terms for an order in a given component security may not be known at the time.\n\nBroker 2 will report a corresponding order accepted event (MOOA) for each of the 10 option series provided as eligible component securities, again, even though all material terms for an order in a given component security may not be known at the time.\n\nEach order event above must be marked as follows:\n\nField\n\nValue\n\nWhen Broker 2’s algorithm generates specific orders for any of the eligible securities and routes those orders to an exchange or another Industry Member, Broker 2 must report an order route event (MOOR) related to the order accepted event (MOOA) for the specific eligible security reported to reflect receipt of the order from Broker 1.\n\nIf Broker 2’s algorithm does not ultimately generate any specific order(s) in an eligible option series, no further reporting is required by either Broker 1 or Broker 2 for that series. If Broker 1 or Broker 2 cancels or modifies the trading instruction, then a cancel or modify event would be required for each applicable component option series following existing guidance for the reporting of cancel events.\n\nExample 2\n\nA non-broker-dealer customer uses a Vega algorithm provided by Broker 2 and within Broker 2’s system stipulates a list of 10 option series that are eligible for Broker 2 to generate orders to trade on the non-broker-dealer customer’s behalf. No further action is required on the customer’s part to generate any order for a particular series. Broker 2 would report a MONO for each option series provided in the list of eligible securities within the algorithmic parameters, even though all material terms for an order in a given component security may not be known at the time. The MONO event must be marked as noted in the table above.\n\nWhen Broker 2’s algorithm generates specific orders for any of the eligible securities and routes those orders to an exchange or another Industry Member, Broker 2 must report an order route event (MOOR) related to the new order event (MONO) for the specific eligible security reported to reflect receipt of the order from the non-broker-dealer customer.\n\nIf Broker 2’s algorithm does not ultimately generate any specific order(s) in an eligible option series, no further reporting is required by Broker 2 for that series. If the non-broker-dealer customer or Broker 2 cancels or modifies the trading instruction, then a cancel or modify event would be required for each applicable component option series following existing guidance for the reporting of cancel events.\n\nAt this time, the above-described algorithmic strategy trading instructions are reportable to CAT. Should the Participants determine in the future that such instructions are not reportable to CAT, the reporting guidance may change.\n\nAn example of this might be an index option strategy where a particular option series is to be traded with a “delta hedge” combination where the specific option contracts that constitute the delta hedge are not predetermined. Net price and full leg details are known for at least one leg of the strategy (e.g., B/S, quantity, contract, open/close) when the sending Industry Member communicates the instruction to the receiving Industry Member and no further action is required on the sending Industry Member’s part to generate any order for the options series that make up the combination. Instead, the receiving Industry Member must determine the remaining legs (e.g., for the specific combination).\n\nAlthough this strategy does not contain the specific contracts used to form the delta hedge combination, the Industry Members must report the leg(s) that are known at the time the strategy is given. Once the receiving Industry Member selects the specific contracts that will make up the combination, the receiver must report a full multi-leg order with all leg details.\n\nExample\n\nBroker 1 calls Floor Broker 2 with a strategy to sell 200 INDX March 4250 calls along with a delta hedge. The delta hedge portion of the strategy has not been defined by Broker 1, and would instead be identified by Floor Broker 2 based on market conditions (e.g., after getting indications from the trading floor) using two option contract series - sometimes referred to as a “combo order” – buying a call and selling a put with the same expiration date and strike price, and having the same underlying index as the primary order.\n\nAt the time Broker 1 provides Floor Broker 2 with a firm authorization to trade, Broker 1 must report a Multi-Leg New Order (MLNO) event and a Multi-Leg Order Route (MLOR) event. Both events must be marked with the ‘SLL’ (Strategy Legs Later) value in the handlingInstructions field and the eventTimestamp of the MLOR event must represent the time Broker 1 instructed Floor Broker 2 to trade on its behalf.\n\nWhen reporting the MLNO and MLOR events, Broker 1 must include the full details of the leg(s) that are known at the time the instruction to trade is given. In the example above Broker 1 would report multi-leg order events that includes one leg – selling 200 INDX March 4250 calls.\n\nFloor Broker 2 reports a Multi-Leg Order Accepted (MLOA) event that includes the leg that is known at the time Broker 1 provided authorization to trade. The MLOA event must be marked with the handlingInstructions value of ‘SLL’ (Strategy Legs Later) to indicate that the original instruction to trade was provided without all leg instruments specified and the eventTimestamp of the MLOR event must represent the time Broker 1 instructs Floor Broker 2 to trade on its behalf.\n\nUpon determining the specific contracts that would make up the combo, Floor Broker 2 systematizes the receipt of an order for the entire strategy (i.e., the primary series and the two series that make up the combo). Floor Broker 2 then trades the order and reports any activity according to existing guidance.\n\nAt this time, the above-described multi-leg strategy is to have a CAT reportable event at the time the known legs are first communicated from Broker 1 and received by Floor Broker 2 and before Floor Broker 2 determines all legs of the strategy. Should the Participants determine in the future that such instruction is not reportable to CAT, the reporting guidance may change.\n\nAs described in the CAT Industry Member Technical Specification (“Tech Spec”) document certain events that occur within systems used by Floor Brokers on the NYSE’s equities or options floors are required to be reported to CAT pursuant to SEC Rule 613(c)(7). Generally, Floor Brokers on both the equities and options trading floors receive orders from one of several sources and such orders are processed via an order management system (“OMS”) before they are entered into an exchange for execution. For example, Floor Brokers may receive an order from within their own firm, which has electronically routed the order from one of its internal systems into the Floor Broker’s OMS. For CAT reporting purposes, that transfer of an order from the firm’s own internal system to that firm’s Floor Broker OMS on the floor of the NYSE is likely CAT reportable as an intrafirm transfer/internal route as described in the Tech Specs and required by Rule 613(c)(7)(ii)(F) and Rule 613(c)(7)(iii). In another scenario, Floor Brokers may receive an order from an outside source and enter it into the firm’s Floor Broker OMS. In this scenario, the Floor Broker must record and report the time of the order receipt as described in SEC Rule 613(c)(7)(i)(E), Appendix C at section A(1)(a)(iii) of the CAT NMS Plan and also described in the Tech Specs.\n\nAfter a Floor Broker receives the order and the order is in the Floor Broker’s OMS, the Floor Broker determines how to represent their order. A Floor Broker may, for example: 1) send the order back to the source if routed directly to the Floor Broker’s OMS by another desk within the Floor Broker’s firm; 2) electronically send the order directly to an exchange system for execution; 3) electronically route the order to a third-party provider that determines where to route the order (to an exchange or other execution venue); or 4) orally represent and then execute the order on the floor. Each of these scenarios may include events that trigger an obligation to report to CAT.\n\nIn the first three scenarios, electronically routing an order from the Floor Broker’s OMS to another of the Floor Broker firm’s internal systems, to an exchange, or to a third-party provider constitutes a CAT-reportable event pursuant to Rule 613(c)(7)(ii). For the fourth scenario, if the Floor Broker orally represents an order on the trading floor, no reportable events are occurring until an execution is reported. The execution triggers a CAT-reporting obligation for the Floor Broker, who is responsible for reporting the time of order execution pursuant to SEC Rule 613(c)(7)(v) and as described in the Tech Spec. The time of execution as required by Rule 613(c)(7)(v)(C) is the time at which the Trading Official (options floors) releases the order to the Floor Broker for reporting to the exchange, or is the time at which the DMM (equities floor) reports the matched trade to the exchange. The Floor Broker is responsible for reporting each CAT-reportable event required by Rule 613, although a Floor Broker may arrange for the exchange to report on the Floor Broker’s behalf. The Floor Broker should contact NYSE Member Services to ensure reporting by the industry member reporting deadlines.\n\nFirm Designated ID (FDID) is defined in Section 1.1 of the CAT NMS Plan as “(1) a unique and persistent identifier for each trading account designated by Industry Members for purposes of providing data to the Central Repository, provided, however, such identifier may not be the account number for such trading account if the trading account is not a proprietary account; (2) a unique and persistent relationship identifier when an Industry Member does not have an account number available to its order handling and/or execution system at the time of order receipt, provided, however, such identifier must be masked; or (3) a unique and persistent entity identifier when an employee of an Industry Member is exercising discretion over multiple client accounts and creates an aggregated order for which a trading account number of the Industry Member is not available at the time of order origination, where each such identifier is unique among all identifiers from any given Industry Member.” Under the CAT NMS Plan, broker-dealers are required to report the FDID on all Transaction Order events requiring the FDID submitted to the Central Repository and the Central Repository will associate specific customers and their CAT Customer IDs (CCID) with individual order events based on the reported FDID. Given the purpose of the FDID under the CAT NMS Plan, it is important that this identifier be unique, persistent and consistent within the firm and across all vendors and systems the Industry Member may use to report Transaction Order events requiring an FDID to CAT and associated Customer and Account information for the FDID to CAT CAIS, and unique across time.\n\nA change/replacement in the FDID value associated with a particular trading account would be an isolated event that is only permissible in certain limited circumstances, such as:\n\nSystem migration. For example, Industry Member 1 changes from System A to System B, which necessitates the generation of unique FDID values for accounts, and the system migration does not involve closing the underlying accounts.\n\nChange of vendors. For example, an Industry Member currently uses an Order Management System (“OMS”) provided by Vendor A but will change to Vendor B’s OMS. Vendor B’s OMS does not support some of the characters supported by Vendor A so the Industry Member must change the FDID. Please see FAQs B53 and Q53.\n\nChange in Clearing Firm. For example, an Industry Member changes from Clearing Firm A to Clearing Firm B. Clearing Firm B does not permit FDIDs in the same format as Clearing Firm A so the Industry Member must change the FDID.\n\nChange in masking methodology.\n\nChanging the algorithm which creates a new FDID value for the account\n\nMasking a previously unmasked FDID value\n\nOnly for proprietary accounts: unmasking a masked FDID value of a proprietary account.\n\nNote that the above limited circumstances do not include correcting an erroneously reported FDID, closing an account, or transferring the FDID to another CAT Reporter Firm. Please see the CAT Reporting Customer and Account Technical Specifications for Industry Members for more information on these scenarios.\n\nAlso, please see FAQ M16 for the requirements when replacing/changing an FDID.\n\nThe same guidance outlined above would apply to an FDID value representing a Relationship Identifier (“Relationship ID”).\n\nIndustry Members may resubmit the same record each business day but are not required to. If an Industry Member resubmits an identical record to one that already exists in CAT CAIS, CAT CAIS will overwrite the previous record with the new record with the same information.\n\nFor the LTID Phase, it was permissible to exclude optional or conditional attributes previously submitted for an FDID or LTID, and no implicit update was made to these values stored in CAIS. If an Industry Member intended to clear a previously submitted value, it was required to use the paired NULL attribute for the field.\n\nFor the Full CAIS Phase, Industry Members are required to include all attributes and associations for each record within the file. Industry Members are still only required to include records in their submission when changes occur to Active Accounts, however each record present in the file must contain the current state of attributes and associations of the record. The sole exception to this inclusion of all current attributes and associations is Customer associations that were previously stored, where the FDID is not included in the current submission but at least one of its associated Customers is included. For example, suppose a Customer Record was associated to both FDID 1234 and FDID 5678 and was previously accepted by CAIS. Later, the Industry Member must submit required updates for FDID 1234 but there were no changes to FDID 5678. All current attributes and associations for FDID 1234 must be reported to CAIS. Despite having a common Customer, the Industry Member is not required to submit all current attributes and associations for FDID 5678 because there are no changes to this FDID. Please see the Customer and Account Technical Specifications for Industry Members- Full CAIS for more information.\n\nConcurrent with Phase 2c (April 26, 2021), LTIDs or ULTIDs associated with FDIDs must be reported in the LTID Phase of CAIS (“CAIS LTID”) when all three of the following conditions are met:\n\na. The Industry Member is a Large Industry Member (which is an Industry Member other than a Small Industry Member); AND\n\nb. The FDID has an associated LTID or ULTID; AND\n\nc. The FDID is reported in equities and/or options events to CAT on or after April 26, 2021. CAT Reportable Events requiring an FDID include:\n\ni. New Order, Trade and Order Fulfillment events (MENO, MENOS, MONO, MONOS, MENQ, MEOT, MEOTS, MEOF)\n\nii. Equity Allocation events (MEPA, MEAA)\n\nFor an FDID reported in an equity and/or options event prior to April 26, 2021, the FDID is not required to be reported to CAIS until or unless that FDID is reported in an equity and/or options event occurring on or after April 26, 2021.\n\nFor example:\n\nA Large Industry Member has recorded FDID XYZ456 which has an associated LTID. On February 2, 2021, the Industry Member accepts a GTC order for FDID XYZ456. On April 26, 2021, FDID XYZ456 has no reportable activity even though the GTC order remains active. At 8:30 am ET on April 29, 2021, the GTC order for FDID XYZ456 is executed and reported on an MEOT. The Industry Member now has a CAIS reporting obligation and is required report this FDID and associated LTID information to CAIS no later than 8 am ET on April 30, 2021. For more information on reporting deadlines in the CAIS LTID Phase see FAQ Q21.\n\nConcurrent with Phase 2d (December 13, 2021), Large Industry Members must report any additional LTIDs or ULTIDs associated with FDIDs that have events reportable to CAT as of and including Phase 2d using the same conditions as above, with the addition of Option Allocation events (MOPA, MOAA).\n\nIn addition, Small Industry members must report LTIDs or ULTIDs associated with FDIDs that have events reportable to CAT as of and including Phase 2d using the same conditions as above, with the addition of Option Allocation events (MOPA, MOAA) by December 13, 2021.\n\nNOTE: All firms satisfying the above criteria, including introducing and non-self clearing executing brokers, are required to begin reporting in the CAIS LTID Phase.\n\nFor more guidance regarding an LTID or ULTID being associated with an account, contact the SEC or see the SEC’s Large Trader Rule FAQs at https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/large-trader-faqs.htm.\n\nBeginning with the implementation of Phase 2e (Full CAIS), the addressList field at the account level is required to be populated for each FDID reported to CAIS. Industry Members must report one mailing address associated with the account in the ‘ADDRESS1’ value of the addrType field. The mailing address submitted is the destination where account correspondence is sent at the account level. In addition to the requirement to distinguish a mailing address for the account, Industry Members have the ability to report an additional three addresses associated with the FDID at the account level via the ‘ADDRESS2’, ‘ADDRESS3’, and ‘ADDRESS4’ values. If multiple addresses are associated with a particular account, then Industry Members must submit these additional addresses to CAIS if such address information is reasonably available. For example, Industry Members that maintain three mailing addresses for a particular account would populate such address information as addrType values of ‘ADDRESS1’, ‘ADDRESS2’, and ‘ADDRESS3’.\n\nAs noted in FAQ M12, the Firm Designated ID applies to a trading account, not to a particular Customer. However, in addition to supporting address records maintained at the account level, CAIS supports the ability for Industry Members to report up to four addresses associated with a particular customer record via the addressList field. In instances where an Industry Member maintains separate addresses at the account and customer level, then all such reasonably available addresses must be reported to CAIS.\n\nFor more information on the requirements for the data attributes for Customer information pursuant to the CAT NMS Plan, see Sections 9.1 and 9.2 of Appendix D.\n\nThe Industry Member is required to report Customer information for the entity authorized trader for this account to the CAT. The Industry Member is not required to report Customer information for any natural persons who are employed by the entity authorized trader and who are authorized to trade for that account on behalf of the entity authorized trader, unless the account holder specifically designates the natural person employee as authorized to trade for the account independent of the authority granted to the entity authorized trader, in which case the Industry Member is also required to report Customer information for that natural person authorized trader to the CAT. These requirements apply regardless of whether the account holder is a natural person or a legal entity.\n\nThis FAQ response is based on the SEC Staff’s interpretation of the definition of “Customer” in Rule 613(j)(3) that natural persons who are employed by, and authorized to trade for an account on behalf of, an entity authorized trader are not considered different from the entity authorized trader. The SEC Staff’s interpretation is similar to and consistent with the guidance provided by the SEC in footnote 388 of the Rule 613 Adopting Release, which states that “for the purposes of Rule 613(j)(3), natural persons who are employed by an entity that is an account holder, and who are authorized to trade for that account, are not considered different from the account holders, and are therefore not covered by Rule 613(j)(3)(ii).”\n\nAs noted above, the Full CAIS Technical Specifications require the Natural Person first and last names be reported in two separate fields. In the scenario where the Industry Member has historically maintained the Customer name in an unparsed state and will not be able to complete parsing of all Customer names by the implementation schedule set forth in CAT Alerts 2022-01 and 2023-01, the Plan Participants will temporarily make available a value of ‘UNPARSED’ to be populated in the firstName field. The unparsed name must be populated in the lastName field. Further, as soon as practicable, but no later than June 12, 2023, the Industry Member must resubmit the Customer Record to CAIS with the first and last names parsed and in the required separate firstName and lastName fields.\n\nUse of the ‘UNPARSED’ value in the firstName field is only allowable until June 12, 2023. While the Plan Participants are providing this temporary solution to allow Industry Members to report the Customer Record to CAIS according to the implementation schedule set forth in CAT Alerts 2022-01 and 2023-01, an unparsed first and last name is not in compliance with the Plan and the Operating Committee-approved Technical Specifications which require that the first and last names be reported in separate fields. There is no exemptive relief that would allow the entry of Customer names in an unparsed state. Accordingly, use of the ‘UNPARSED’ value could be subject to review by Regulators.\n\nAn “Unparsed Names” Report will be made available to regulators and affected Industry Members. ‘UNPARSED’ will be retired from the Full CAIS Technical Specifications effective June 13, 2023.\n\nAll accounts, Relationships or Entity IDs (as represented by the FDID/Firm Designated ID) with any CAT-reportable activity (equities, options and/or multileg events) on or after June 12, 2022 must be reported to CAIS with the implementation of Phase 2e (Full CAIS). See CAT Alerts 2022-01 and 2023-01 for the Full CAIS Implementation Schedule.\n\nExample 1 (FDID in scope for Full CAIS reporting)\n\nOn June 22, 2020 (the Phase 2a Go-Live date), FRMA had an obligation to report a New Order event (MENO). The order remained open until August 17, 2022, when it was cancelled. Because the FDID had CAT-reportable activity after June 12, 2022, FRMA has a CAIS reporting obligation for this FDID. By contrast, if the open order did not have any subsequent CAT-reportable activity as of the date that FRMA was required to report this FDID to Full CAIS, FRMA would not have a CAIS reporting obligation for this FDID at that time.\n\nExample 2 (FDID in scope for Full CAIS reporting)\n\nFRMB received a customer order on June 12, 2022 and reported a MENO. The account was permanently closed off FRMB’s books on July 1, 2022. FRMB has a CAIS reporting obligation for this FDID because it had CAT-reportable activity on June 12, 2022. When FRMB is required to report this FDID to Full CAIS, it must submit this FDID Record with an fdidEndReason of ‘ENDED’ and fdidEndDate of July 1, 2022.\n\nExample 3 (FDID NOT in scope for Full CAIS reporting)\n\nFRMC is a clearing firm with an obligation to report post-trade allocation events (MEPA/MEAA/MOPA/MOAA). On June 22, 2021, FRMC allocated shares to FDID1234. As of June 12, 2022, there has been no further CAT-reportable activity for this FDID. Since there has been no CAT-reportable activity related to the FDID on or after June 12, 2022, FRMC does not have a CAIS reporting obligation for this FDID. However, should FDID1234 subsequently have any CAT-reportable activity, it will be in scope for Full CAIS reporting.\n\nExample 4 (Business Model with no Full CAIS reporting obligation)\n\nFRMD only accepts orders from other CAT Reporters and immediately routes them away for execution. Since FRMD only reports order accepted events (MEOA/MOOA/MLOA) and order route events (MEOR/MOOR/MLOR) which do not have the firmDesignatedID field on them, FRMD does not have a CAIS reporting obligation for this business model. However, if FRMD has firm-owned/controlled accounts (such as an error account) with activity on or after June 12, 2022, FRMD would have a CAIS reporting obligation for those firm-owned/controlled accounts.\n\nWhether the Industry Member should be identified as a CAT Customer on the FDID Record depends on whether the Industry Member is an account holder or has authority to place orders for the account without prior approval of the account holder(s). Absent this authority from the account holder(s) (and assuming the Industry Member is not an account holder in this scenario), the Industry Member is not required to be identified as a CAT Customer on the related FDID Record when there are standing instructions on the account (such as the Industry Member purchase of shares in an Automated Investment Plan or Dividend Reinvestment Plan) or when an order is placed by the Industry Member to satisfy a legal requirement or SEC/SRO rule, such as a liquidation to satisfy a margin call. In addition, assuming the Industry Member is not an account holder and has not been given authority to place orders for the account without prior approval of the account holder(s), the Industry Member is not required to be identified as a CAT Customer on the related FDID Record when liquidating fractional shares held in a Customer’s account to facilitate operational processes (e.g., ACAT, an Industry Member buying a fractional share from a customer upon receipt of an order to exit its entire position in a security, or orphaned fractional positions). If an Industry Member uses a firm owned or controlled account to trade fractional positions against a Customer account, the Industry Member must report that firm owned or controlled account to CAIS.\n\nSee the section titled “Fractional Share Scenarios” in the CAT Industry Member Reporting Scenarios document for more information regarding the transaction reporting requirements for fractional share scenarios.\n\nSee FAQ Q56 for more information regarding when a natural person who is employed by an Authorized Trader must be identified as a CAT Customer.\n\nIn the scenario where an Industry Member has systematized all data required to report a Natural Person Authorized Trader, it must report all information required for a complete Customer Record, including tidValue and yearOfBirth. However, in the scenario where an Industry Member has not historically collected and systematized all data required to report a Natural Person Authorized Trader and will not be able to collect and systematize the data by the Full CAIS Compliance Go-Live date per the implementation schedule as set forth in CAT Alerts – 2022-01 and 2023-01, the Plan Participants will have temporarily made available an Authorized Trader Names List on the FDID Record.\n\nThe Authorized Trader Names List will enable the Industry Member to report only the name of the Natural Person Authorized Trader having authority to trade on the Account, where they do not have all data required to report the Authorized Trader as a Natural Person CAT Customer. Each FDID submitted must still have at least one active association to a CAT Customer reported with a TID and all required data, with trading capabilities.\n\nUse of the Authorized Trader Names List is only allowable on a temporary basis and, with sufficient time and notice, will be retired from the Full CAIS Technical Specifications at a future date. Thus, Industry Members will be required to resubmit the FDID Record to CAIS with all required data for a full CAT Customer Record.\n\nWhile the Plan Participants are providing this temporary technical solution to allow an Industry Member to report an incomplete Customer Record for a Natural Person Authorized Trader to CAIS effective with the implementation of full Customer and Account Reporting (in lieu of having that Customer Record rejected), use of the Authorized Trader Names List is not in compliance with the Plan. There currently is no exemptive relief that would allow only the submission of an incomplete Customer Record for a Natural Person Authorized Trader. Use of the Authorized Trader Names List rather than the submission of all information required for Natural Person Authorized Traders could be subject to review by Regulators. Accordingly, Industry Members are encouraged to report all data required for Natural Person Authorized Traders as soon as possible before the Full CAIS Compliance Go-Live date.\n\nThe requirement to report to CAT CAIS a firstName, lastName, yearOfBirth, tidType and tidValue (i.e., a hashed version of an Input Identifier, such as a social security number) for all Natural Person Authorized Traders means that CAT may impose new recording and reporting obligations on some Industry Members with respect to obtaining Customer information to meet their CAT reporting obligations. Some Industry Members may have to change current onboarding activities to ensure Customer information is obtained and recorded for any Active Accounts with CAT Reportable Events, including for accounts that existed prior to the effective date of the CAT NMS Plan.\n\nIn this situation, the minor or incapacitated person must be reported to CAIS with a role of ‘TRDHOLDER’ with the doingBusinessAs field populated with the value of ‘PUBLIC ADMINISTRATOR’. The Authorized Traders Names List must be included with the submission, and include the name of the government employee public administrator (e.g., U.S. state, county or municipality government employee).\n\nIt is understood by the Plan Participants that a Customer Record with a role of ‘TRDHOLDER’ paired with the ‘PUBLIC ADMINISTRATOR’ value populated in the doingBusinessAs field represents a minor or incapacitated account holder who does not have authorization to trade on the account, and that the associated FDID Record is associated with a government employee Authorized Trader acting in the capacity as of a conservator or guardian for the account holder. This is an interim technical solution to allow these FDIDs to be accepted into CAIS prior to Full CAIS Compliance go-live. This guidance is specific to the scenario where the Natural Person government employee (rather than the Legal Entity) is appointed as the Authorized Trader.\n\nThe Industry Member may choose to report such Customer Records to CAIS in the manner outlined above so that the associated FDID Records can be accepted into CAIS and not be rejected due to Error Code 22071. However, given the limited number of FDID Records associated with this guardianship/conservatorship and government employee Authorized Trader fact-pattern, the Industry Member may also opt to resubmit such records to CAIS in the manner described above to CAIS following receipt of Error Code 22071 in its feedback. There currently is no exemptive relief that would allow an Industry Member not to report Customer Identifying Information for U.S. government employee Authorized Traders under Rule 613. In this situation, where the government employee Authorized Trader does not provide a year of birth or Input Identifier citing exemptions from the definition of “customer” under the Customer Identification Program Rule (31 CFR § 1023.100(d)), the Plan Participants are providing a temporary technical solution to allow an Industry Member to report the government employee Authorized Trader in the Authorized Trader Names List, rather than reporting a Customer Record. As noted in FAQ Q65, use of the Authorized Trader Names List is not in compliance with the Plan, is only allowable on a temporary basis and, with sufficient time and notice, will be retired from the Full CAIS Technical Specifications at a future date. Thus, Industry Members will be required to resubmit the FDID Record to CAIS with all required data for a full CAT Customer Record.\n\nThe Plan Participants will provide further guidance on this scenario before retirement of the Authorized Trader Names List and are evaluating the mechanism for reporting government employee public administrators to CAIS.\n\nPer the Full CAIS Technical Specifications, each CAT Customer must only have one active role in association to the FDID at a time. Therefore, an attempt to associate two or more active CAT Customers with the same EIN to the same FDID will result in a rejection.\n\nA disregarded entity is an entity that is disregarded as separate from its owner for federal income tax purposes. When a disregarded entity and its parent company have the same EIN and are both CAT Customers associated to the same FDID, Industry Members must report only one version of the Customer in association to the FDID, either the disregarded entity or the parent company. The CAT Customer must be identified in a role of ‘TRDHOLDER’, which indicates that the CAT Customer is a holder of the account that also has authorization to trade on the account. The data elements reported to CAIS (e.g., Address, Legal Name, LEI, etc.) in association with the Customer Record must be that of the chosen version of the CAT Customer. For example, when the disregarded entity and its parent company have the same EIN but different LEIs, and the Industry Member has reported the parent company as the CAT Customer associated to the FDID, the Industry Member must report the LEI of the parent company. See also FAQ Q4 for additional information regarding the reporting of LEIs for CAT Customers.\n\nWhile the Plan Participants are providing this temporary solution to facilitate the partial reporting of Customer information to CAT in the context of disregarded entities, the reporting of only one CAT Customer where two CAT Customers are associated to the same FDID is not in compliance with the Plan. Accordingly, the Plan Participants have requested a temporary exemption from the SEC with respect to certain provisions of the CAT NMS Plan relating to this scenario. The reporting of both the disregarded entity and its parent company as CAT Customers associated to the same FDID may be required in future phases of CAT.\n\nWhen the disregarded entity and its parent company have different EINs and are both CAT Customers associated to the same FDID, Industry Members must report both versions of the Customers in association to the FDID.\n\nPer the Full CAIS Technical Specifications, each CAT Customer must only have one active role in association to the FDID at a time. Therefore, an attempt to associate two or more active CAT Customers with the same SSN to the same FDID will result in a rejection.\n\nWhen multiple trusts (or sole proprietorships) and a Natural Person have the same Tax Identifier (i.e., SSN) and are all CAT Customers associated to the same FDID, Industry Members must report only the Natural Person in association to the FDID with the doingBusinessAs field populated with only one of the trusts that shares the Natural Person’s SSN. The Natural Person must be identified in a role of ‘TRDHOLDER’, which indicates that the CAT Customer is a holder of the account that also has authorization to trade on the account. The Plan Participants are not prescribing a specific methodology for which trust must be reported in the doingBusinessAs field, and any methodology must be applied consistently by the Industry Member.\n\nWhile the Plan Participants are providing this temporary solution to facilitate the partial reporting of Customer information to CAT, the reporting of only one CAT Customer where two or more CAT Customers are associated to the same FDID is not in compliance with the Plan. The reporting of the Natural Person and trusts with the same SSN as CAT Customers associated to the same FDID may be required in future phases of CAT.\n\nWhen the trusts and Natural Person have different Tax Identifiers and are all CAT Customers associated to the same FDID, Industry Members must report all versions of the CAT Customers in association to the FDID.\n\nAn Industry Member must satisfy the CAT clock synchronization requirements for all of its Business Clocks. Business Clocks are defined as clocks used to record the date and time of any Reportable Event required to be reported under SEC Rule 613. If an Industry Member relies on a third-party service provider’s clocks, including, but not limited to, third-party service providers that are registered broker-dealers, to record the date and time of any of the Industry Member’s Reportable Events required to be reported under SEC Rule 613, such clocks are considered to be the Industry Member’s Business Clocks for purposes of the CAT clock synchronization requirements. Accordingly, the Industry Member has the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that such Business Clocks satisfy the CAT clock synchronization requirements. Industry Members also must satisfy the documentation, certification and violation reporting requirements related to clock synchronization as set forth in the Compliance Rule with regard to such third-party service providers’ clocks.\n\nIndustry Members will need to obtain information regarding clock synchronization procedures from their third-party service providers to satisfy these requirements. The amount of information an Industry Member must obtain from a third-party vendor may depend on whether the vendor is itself a registered broker-dealer. Industry Members would be expected to obtain at least the information specified below to satisfy the clock synchronization requirements provided in the Participants’ common CAT clock synchronization rule, although Industry Members may employ their own reasonable arrangements with their vendors to demonstrate compliance. Third-party vendors are encouraged to provide this information to Industry Members to facilitate compliance. Industry Members also would be expected to document in their own procedures the steps they take to perform this oversight of their vendors with respect to clock synchronization.\n\nIf its vendor is not a registered broker-dealer, an Industry Member should:\n\nOn a reasonable periodic basis, receive and review the vendor’s clock synchronization procedures and copies of sample logs for consistency with the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of the clock synchronization rule.\n\nSpecifically, an Industry Member should confirm that its vendor’s procedures apply the correct clock synchronization standard, call for Business Clocks to be synchronized every business day before market open to ensure that timestamps for Reportable Events are accurate, provide for re-synchronization throughout the day as necessary, and provide for sufficie"
