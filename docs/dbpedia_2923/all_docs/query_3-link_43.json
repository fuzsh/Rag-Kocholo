        "text": "World-leading farm assurance solutions\n\nWhat is GLOBALG.A.P.?\n\nGLOBALG.A.P. is a brand of smart farm assurance solutions built on a portfolio of standards for safe and responsible production processes in agriculture, aquaculture, and floriculture. Our holistic approach to certification is developed through extensive collaboration with sector experts. GLOBALG.A.P. activities are supported by a rigorous integrity program and a network of more than 430 GLOBALG.A.P. Community Member organizations from across global value chains. In addition, our dedicated capacity-building program equips producers around the world with practical knowledge about responsible farming practices, enabling them to achieve certification, meet evolving market requirements, and contribute to international sustainability goals. Today, GLOBALG.A.P. solutions provide some of the most respected and internationally recognized standards that support the global trade of farmed products, counting almost 200,000 producers around the world under certification.Â\n\nWhat drives us?\n\nOur vision â What do we want to achieve?\n\nWe envision a world in which farms are recognized for their efforts to continuously produce enough safe food while safeguarding our environment and the welfare of farming communities.\n\nOur mission â How will we achieve our vision?\n\nWe collaborate with supply chain stakeholders to foster the global adoption of safer and more sustainable farming practices by providing industry-leading, cost-effective, and value-adding assurance and benchmarking solutions.\n\nOur purpose â What do we believe?\n\nEvery generation has a right to safe food. To protect this right now and for future generations, the worldâs farms must produce safe food in ways that are socially and environmentally responsible and resilient.\n\nFarm assurance fit for the future\n\nHow does GLOBALG.A.P. certification work?\n\nGLOBALG.A.P. standards and add-ons can be applied to the production processes of more than 700 different plant and aquatic species. Each species belongs to a product category with its own checklist that details the certification requirements. Every audit is conducted against the relevant checklist and in accordance with the GLOBALG.A.P. general regulations â a set of certification rules for checklist implementation. Audits are performed by independent and accredited third-party certification bodies (CBs), and the certification status of each registered producer is displayed in the GLOBALG.A.P. IT systems for transparency. This marks the GLOBALG.A.P. certification system as one of the most robust on the market.\n\nWhat are GLOBALG.A.P. smart farm assurance solutions?\n\nGLOBALG.A.P. standards and add-on are supported by a framework of interlinked IT systems which connect audit data and validation services to deliver transparent, trustworthy, and real-time information on certification status. As farm assurance evolves to more closely integrate farm-level data, the GLOBALG.A.P. system is evolving with it. The newest version of our Integrated Farm Assurance standard and our connected IT systems mark the introduction of a smarter portfolio of streamlined, intuitive, and digitalized farm assurance solutions.\n\nWhat is the âone auditor through the farm gateâ principle?\n\nWe operate a range of harmonization activities that aim to cut duplication for producers and enable simpler sourcing processes for buyers. This is achieved through add-ons to core solutions that can widen the scope of a single audit, as well as a benchmarking program that recognizes other global certification schemes as equivalent to GLOBALG.A.P. smart farm assurance solutions.\n\nWhat is the smart path to sustainability?\n\nSustainability is a journey, not a destination. We are committed to continuously improving our portfolio and supporting strategies that bring more sustainable farming practices to the mainstream. The next step for the GLOBALG.A.P. Secretariat on this path is the development of a dedicated environmental sustainability solution that builds on the rigorous criteria already contained in our flagship Integrated Farm Assurance standard.\n\nAfter extensive dialogue with stakeholders from all parts of the value chain, the GLOBALG.A.P. Secretariat has established a working group to drive the development process before the launch of the solution in 2025. If you would like to join us on this journey, learn more about participating in the Environmental Sustainability Working Group.\n\nGLOBALG.A.P. Community Members\n\nThe GLOBALG.A.P. certification system would not have achieved the widespread impact it has today without the support and contribution of value chain stakeholders.\n\nGLOBALG.A.P. Community Member organizations are vital in helping us to continuously improve our standards and add-ons, promote safer and more sustainable farming practices around the world, and collaborate on innovative solutions for the benefit of the entire supply chain.\n\nCommunity members are organized into three categories: producer/supplier, retail/food service, and associate. Learn more about the benefits of becoming a GLOBALG.A.P. Community Member.\n\nTargeted solutions to complex problems\n\nHow does GLOBALG.A.P. certification make a difference?\n\nWith a projected world population of 9.8 billion by 2050, the FAO estimates that we will require an increase in food production of up to 70% to feed the world. Given that 50% of the worldâs habitable land is already used for agriculture â a key driver of biodiversity loss and soil degradation (FAO) â we need to increase the accessibility of certification that enables producers applying responsible farming practices to be easily identified in the market. The GLOBALG.A.P. Secretariat responds to this challenge by setting reference standards for the implementation of safe and responsible practices at farm level. Already applied by almost 200,000 producers in more than 135 countries, we make a difference through six key focus areas: food safety, environmental sustainability, workersâ well-being, animal welfare, supply chain traceability, and capacity building.\n\nAdvancing safer and more sustainable farming worldwide\n\nFrom the shrimp farms of Vietnam and the banana plantations of Ecuador to the tulip greenhouses of the Netherlands and the mango orchards of Mali, the world of farming is incredibly varied. Farm types and sizes are as diverse as the ecosystems and communities in which they operate. We believe that protecting these environments is vital â both now and for future generations.\n\nSafer\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, 600 million people fall ill worldwide as a result of contaminated food each year. As global supply chains become increasingly complex and interconnected, safer farming means scaling up food safety and worker welfare practices. This helps to protect both the health and well-being of consumers as well as the producers who are engaged in production.\n\nMore sustainable\n\nMore sustainable means implementing practices that address the range of challenges that face the global farming industry and threaten its future viability, from water scarcity and deforestation to food waste and animal welfare. GLOBALG.A.P. smart farm assurance solutions offer a variety of ways to address the different aspects of responsible farming, and our science-based criteria provide practical steps to improve farm management.\n\nWorldwide\n\nWe combine targeted, cost-effective, and measurable solutions with a capacity-building approach that provides a pathway to recognition for producers regardless of size. Through our GLOBALG.A.P. Community Members, partner organizations, and national technical working groups, we aim to advance and accelerate global sustainability action.\n\nSee our solutions"
