        "text": "Use the COUNT function to get the number of records that satisfy the criteria in the select query.\n\nThe sample query retrieves the count of lead records with annual revenue over 25,000. The records are grouped based on the lead source using the group by clause. For example, you can see that there are two records with annual revenue over 25,000 whose lead source is \"Online Store\". Similarly, for the lead source \"Advertisement\", there are two records with annual revenue greater than 25,000.\n\nNote that you can use this aggregate function only for number, lookup, and picklist fields.\n\nYou have specified more than 50 values for the \"in\" or \"not in\" comparators of the select query.\n\nResolution: You can specify only a maximum of 50 values for the \"in\" or \"not in\" comparators.\n\nThe data type of the value of the select column is invalid.\n\nExample: \"select_query\" : \"select Last_Name from Leads where Last_Name is not null and No_of_Employees = 'adfkahfd'\"\n\nHere, the expected data type for No_of_Employees is a number, whereas the value given is a string.\n\nResolution: Provide the values of the select column corresponding to its data type.\n\nThe query contains duplicate select columns (field_API_names). Example: \"select_query\" : \"select Last_Name, First_Name, Full_Name, Created_Time, Full_Name from Contacts where Lead_Source = Advertisement limit 2\"\n\nHere, the query contains Full_Name twice.\n\nResolution: Ensure that there are no duplicate select columns in the query."
