        "text": "SMILE-UP, Inc. (株式会社SMILE-UP., Kabushiki gaisha Sumairu Appu), formerly known as Johnny & Associates, Inc. (株式会社ジャニーズ事務所, Kabushiki gaisha Janīzu Jimusho), is a Japanese talent agency formed by Johnny Kitagawa in 1962, which manages groups of male idols known as Johnny's (ジャニーズ, Janīzu). Until 2019, it was infamous for its strict policies involving their foreign distribution of music, as well as their strict control and influence on its members.\n\nIn the wake of continuing sexual abuse allegations directed against Kitagawa, who died in 2019, his niece, Julie Keiko Fujishima, stepped down as president in September 2023. In October 2023, new president Noriyuki Higashiyama announced plans to create a new company for managing its talent, while the current Johnny & Associates will be reformed for the purpose of compensating sexual abuse victims and be renamed SMILE-UP. effective October 17.\n\nOn December 8, 2023, STARTO ENTERTAINMENT was revealed to be the successor to SMILE-UP. as the agency housing curreny talents.\n\nCurrent Groups[]\n\nTOKIO (1994-present)\n\nKinKi Kids (1997-present)\n\n20th Century (1997-present, formerly part of V6)\n\nARASHI (1999-2020, on hiatus)\n\nKAT-TUN (2001-present)\n\nNEWS (2003-present)\n\nKanjani8 (2004-present)\n\nHey! Say! JUMP (2007-present)\n\nKis-My-Ft2 (2011-present)\n\nSexy Zone (2011-present)\n\nWEST. (2014-present)\n\nA.B.C-Z (2015-present)\n\nKing & Prince (2018-present)\n\nSixTONES (2020-present)\n\nSnow Man (2020-present)\n\nNaniwa Danshi (2021-present)\n\nTravis Japan (2022-present)\n\nHistory[]\n\n1962–1989[]\n\nIn 1962, Kitagawa launched his first group called Johnnys. However, it was not until 1968 did he see his first real success with Four Leaves. Since then, Kitagawa has formed many successful acts such as solo artist Masahiko Kondo, whose song \"Orokamono\" (愚か者,;;; Fool) won the Japan Record Award at the 29th Japan Record Awards in 1987, and Hikaru Genji, which became the first Johnny's group to achieve the rare feat of having three top-selling singles on the Japanese Oricon yearly charts in 1988.\n\n1990–2009[]\n\nBeginning in the 1990s, Johnny & Associates adopted a policy that they would decline the nominations of awards from organizations such as the Japan Record Awards and the Japan Academy Awards partly due to a dispute with the accurate music genre of one of their groups in the 32nd Japan Record Awards. Another reason was that the nominations would cause competition between Johnny's groups and other nominees.\n\n1991 saw the debut of SMAP and their expansion into many other areas of entertainment such as hosting their own regular television and radio shows, appearing in commercials and acting in dramas and movies. Due to their omnipresence on television, SMAP gained popularity and their 2003 single \"Sekai ni Hitotsu Dake no Hana\" (世界に一つだけの花, \"A Flower Unlike Any Other in the World\") sold over 2.57 million copies and became the ninth best-selling single in Japan. In 1997, the agency started its own record label \"Johnny's Entertainment\".\n\nIn 1999, the Japanese weekly magazine Shukan Bunshun ran a series of articles alleging that adolescent boy clients of the agency had been sexually abused and coerced into drinking alcohol and smoking tobacco. In response, Johnny's agency sued the magazine's publisher, Bungeishunjū. In 2002, the Tokyo District Court awarded the agency ¥8.8 million in damages from the publisher. Bungeishunjū appealed the decision to the Tokyo High Court. The high court reduced the damages to ¥1.2 million, concluding that the allegations of sexual exploitation were true, but that the reports of drinking and smoking were defamatory.\n\n2010–present[]\n\nOn November 19, 2010, Masahiko Kondo was elected as the winner of the award for the \"Best Vocal Performance\" at the 52nd Japan Record Award, becoming the agency's first winner of awards from the Japan Record Award in 20 years since Ninja, which rejected a live performance for an award in 1990.\n\nOn February 28, 2011, it was reported that Johnny's Entertainment had lifted the picture ban on their official website. Johnny’s Company is known to be the most strict company of not allowing any of their Johnny’s celebrity pictures in any sites. But recently, pictures of Johnny’s celebrity has appeared at their own site “Johnny’s net“. From the tab “Artist”, you can choose the Johnny’s artist you want to see and click “Profile” to go to the profile page. Though the pictures are small, they definitely have pictures of the artist from Smap, Arashi, V6 to Hey Say Jump on the pages.\n\nIn response to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami that has devastated much of northern Japan, Johnny's Entertainment has cancelled or postponed 18 of its upcoming concerts including those of Yamashita Tomohisa and Tackey & Tsubasa. Power generators and transporter trucks as well as two thousand litres of gasoline that would have been used at the concerts have instead been donated to the relief effort. Johnny's Entertainment members Takizawa Hideaki, Imai Tsubasa and Nakayama Yuma travelled with the trucks to see the disaster areas first hand. A manager at the company has announced the intention to release a charity single which is expected to involve every act signed with Johnny's Entertainment.\n\nIt was announced on the 29th that Johnny’s Company is going to start a new charity project called “Marching J“, a fundraising project for the Touhoku Earthquake victims. The first part of the project will start as an event which will be held from April 1 through April 3. From the company, SMAP, Tokio, Kinki Kids, V6, Arashi, Tackey and Tsubasa, NEWS, Kanjani8, KAT-TUN, Hey! Say! JUMP and some Johnny’s Juniors are going to participate in this first event. The first event will be held at Tokyo, in front of the first Yoyogi gymnasium. The event included talk sessions as well as small a capella performances. Groups will take turns according to their schedule and will have a talk session in front of the fans, also calling out for donations for the earthquake victims. The Johnny’s Company is planning to have an event once each month and is planning to continue this once a month event for an year. The next event is planned to be held on May 29, a baseball tournament event played by Johnny’s Juniors.\n\nOn September 18, 2011, it was revealed that Johnny Kitagawa has been presented with two Guinness World Record awards. Thus making him one of the most successful music producers in the world. The first award he received is for the ‘most No.1 singles produced by an individual’. He has accumulated an astounding 232 chart-topping songs (between 1974 to 2010). The second award is for the ‘most concerts produced by an individual’. Between 2000 to 2010, Johnny produced 8,419 concerts. He has produced shows for some of the top groups in JE, the concerts have an estimated attendance of 48,234,550.\n\nRelease[]\n\nDebuted Group/ Soloist[]\n\nDebut Artists Members Leader Disbanded Fanclub name 1962 Johnny's 4 Maie Hiromi 1967 - 1967 Four Leaves 5 - 1978 - 1973 Go Hiromi Solo - left the agency - 1975 LITTLE GANG 2 - 1976 - 1980 Tahara Toshihiko Solo - left the agency - 1980 Kondo Masahiko Solo - - - 1981 Shibugakitai 3 Yakumaru Hirohide 1988 - 1983 The Good-Bye ? - already disbanded - 1985 Shōnentai 3 Nishikiori Kazukiyo - - 1987 Hikaru GENJI 7 Oosawa Mikio 1994 became Hikaru GENJI SUPER 5 - 1987 Otokogumi 4 - 1993 - 1990 Ninja ? - already disbanded - 1991 SMAP 6 ® 5 Nakai Masahiro left the agency - 1994 TOKIO 5 Joshima Shigeru - - 1994 Hikaru GENJI SUPER 5 5 - 1995 - 1995 V6 6 Sakamoto Masayuki 2021 - 1997 KinKi Kids 2 - - - 1999 Arashi 5 Ohno Satoshi - - 2002 Tackey & Tsubasa 2 - 2018 - 2003 NEWS 9 ® 8 ® 7 ® 6 ® 4 ® 3 Koyama Keiichiro - - 2004 Kanjani8 8 ® 7 ® 5 - - - 2006 KAT-TUN 6 ® 5 ® 4 ® 3 - - Hyphen 2006 Yamashita Tomohisa Solo - left the agency - 2006 Tegomass 2 - 2020 - 2007 Hey!
