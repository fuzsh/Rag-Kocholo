        "text": "just a #defense mechanism by #smartsociety #CasteSystem India experienced raids for plunder, gold, and women. Once the reality of India's lack of unity, peaceful nature, and military weakness was thoroughly exposed, it led to wars of conquest. However, what protected us was our great Sanatan society. The Sanatan society embraces a secular approach, promoting religious and cultural tolerance while upholding timeless values and traditions, fostering unity among diverse belief systems for societal harmony. The Sikh Gurus in Punjab made the first attempt to downplay caste fault lines and do away with caste all together. In the bargain a new religion was created and the British tried energetically to prod the Sikhs into becoming a separate religion by way of promoting only \"Kesh Dharies\" and not \"Nam Dharies\" to be recruited for the Army. The next was Maharishi Dayananda, founder of the Arya Samaj who found caste to be fatal to Hindu unity as a people and worked energetically to homogenize Hindu society. Britishers decided to deepen Indian religion-based fault lines by providing community-based electorates. Thus, the Muslims were the first to get a separate electorate, followed by the Christians and Sikhs and then it was given to the Scheduled Castes and Tribes. reference book - Bose Or Gandhi: Who Got India Her Freedom? by Maj. Gen. (Dr.) G.D. Bakshi Sena Medal, Vishisht Seva Medal (RETD) https://lnkd.in/dAjYvWtE\n\n#ShauryaDivas Motivate Younger Generation to protect Temple Culture üö© 6th of December, On This Day, Hindus Reclaimed Shri Ram's Birthplace By Bringing Down The Invasive Babri Structure. The idea is to keep the temple movement alive. To see that the younger generations of devotees and Hindus in general will be inspired and motivated enough to pick up where the older generation left off. The future of the Vedic community, and of the temples, depends on the way the future generations get involved. But they have to understand the philosophy and the purpose and meanings of the traditions, perhaps more so than their parents. They can again start to participate in temple functions or even take on various volunteer duties to help keep things at the temple going nicely. This is extremely important today. VHP functionaries explain that the idea to mark Shaurya Diwas by remembering the demolition of the Babri Masjid structure is to ensure that people, especially the new generation, is made aware of the \"historic event\". Younger generation need to understand the meaning and usefulness behind the tradition. And there is nothing wrong with that. In fact, that is the basis for being properly educated in the culture. So it is up to the parents, teachers and gurus to find the ways in which the youth of today can understand and learn about the customs and history of the Vedic tradition in a way that makes sense to them, and how they can be proud of it. This Day Represents the End of Islamic Oppression and Realisation of Aspirations and Struggles of Millions of Hindus for over Centuries. The idea, Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) leaders say, is to inform people, especially the youth, about the importance and history of the Ram Mandir that is under construction in Ayodhya, and to encourage young people to protect Hindu religion and culture. Furthermore, younger generation should not see it as mere rituals, but as ceremonies and practices that uplift and purify the consciousness. They need to recognize and understand the benefits of it. Every attack on our heritage and civilization will suffer the same fate as 6th December 1992. It's not about the medium. It's about sending a message! No Regret, No Repentance, No sorrow, No Grief! Sources said the shaurya sanchalan events would also see young people take a pledge to protect Hindutva. Prabhu Shri Ram is the sole of this country. After the completion of Ram Mandir the Bharat will move towards Ram Rajya. Let it be kashi vishvanath of Varanasi or krishna janma bhoomi in Mathura. It is basically a matter of pride for Hindus to again built that holy temple which was earlier destroyed by foreign invaders. Younger generation need to see that Vedic culture is a dynamic and living tradition that holds eternal spiritual truths that are as relevant today as they were thousands of years ago. Jai Shri Ram #hinduism #shriram #Ayodhya #temple #jaihind #jaibharat\n\nüëã Why I think we should embrace Bharat as our official name üáÆüá≥ and why it is the right time to change it ? ‚úÖDid you know that the name India comes from the Greek word Indos, which was derived from the Sanskrit word Sindhu, meaning the Indus river? The British colonizers used this name to refer to the entire #subcontinent, even though it had many diverse #cultures, #languages, and religions. ü§î ‚úÖOn the other hand, the name Bharat has a rich and #ancient history that reflects our #heritage and identityüôè. It is associated with the legendary #king Bharata, who was the ancestor of the Rig Vedic tribe of the Bharatas and the progenitor of all peoples of the subcontinent. It is also mentioned in the Hindu scriptures as #Bharatavarsha, the land of dharma and righteousness. üôè ‚úÖThe #constitution of India recognizes both names as interchangeable, but I believe that Bharat is more #appropriate and meaningful for us. It is not a symbol of colonialism or foreign #influence, but a symbol of our #unity and #diversity. It is not a name given by others, but a name chosen by ourselves. It is not a name that divides us, but a name that unites us. üôå ‚úÖI think we can matter to India by calling it Bharat and #honoring its legacy and spirit. üáÆüá≥ What do you think?
