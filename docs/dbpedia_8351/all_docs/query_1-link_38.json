        "text": "I chose Emory Family Medicine Program because it would allow me to channel my diverse interest in family medicine. Having a strong interest in sports medicine, I would be able to get involved with sports medicine-related opportunities right from the beginning of residency. Moreover, after having an opportunity to meet and engage with the faculty, staff, and residents, I was comforted to learn about the positive and collegial atmosphere that support and encourage the pursuit of my ambitions. Family medicine offers me the privilege to treat the individual as well as the families. To know a patient's family is to gain a greater understanding of the patient as a whole, which I believe allows me to treat the patient better. I am drawn toward family medicine due to the variety and ability to address daily patient concerns. Family Medicine allows me to build strong relationships with my patients, and continuity of care is something I believe to be very important"
