        "text": "Could you tell us a little about yourself?\n\nI was born and brought up in Hamirpur district of Uttar Pradesh. I did my schooling in Hamirpur and Gwalior. I hold Masters in Public Policy from St. Xavier’s College, Mumbai and Bachelors in Sociology Honors from Lady Shri Ram College for Women, University of Delhi.\n\nI joined ABC in October, 2020 as a qualitative researcher and am now working as a consulting researcher.\n\nCould you tell us about the work you have done prior to ABC?\n\nEarlier I was working as an Assistant Editor – Research and Content for a digital publication based in Mumbai. My work involved writing research-based opinion pieces on socio-political matters and policy issues.\n\nHow did you find out about ABC? Why were you attracted to it?\n\nI heard about ABC during my Masters when it was conducting its Bootcamp called – iGnite. I was attracted to ABC primarily because of the work it has been doing and the projects which they have been undertaking. The very foundation of ABC is to contribute to impact and particularly to real world and grassroots issues. And this is exactly what I have been looking for.\n\nHow does the work you are doing at ABC relate to your interests (personal/academic)? What kinds of projects are you involved in?\n\nIn terms of interest, I think, one thing that has been of utmost importance for me is to be involved in action-research and I am so glad that this is also something which is central to ABC’s vision. Some of the projects that I have had an opportunity to engage in have been evidence based and impact driven.\n\nWhat do you hope to learn/achieve during your time at ABC?\n\nI have been interested in qualitative research and ABC has trained me wonderfully in the same. Thanks to the trainings I received, I have learned a lot more about the tools and techniques of qualitative methodology as well as analysis. I hope I keep learning many such skills. All the projects have been really engaging and I hope that I can be a part of several such projects and contribute in making some real impact.\n\nWhat have you enjoyed about your experience at ABC so far?\n\nThis could be a really long answer because I enjoyed a lot of things and if I could say, I really admired certain things. I started my journey with ABC during a pandemic and at a time when like most of us, I was also a bit disillusioned and the kind of support and warmth this team has shown is absolutely heart-warming. I instantly felt a sense of belonging-ness. Apart from this, it is commendable to see the honest investment that ABC makes in its team, the trainings that I have received have been amazing and very insightful. Moreover, the team is incredible and everyone’s opinions are not only heard but are also acknowledged. It is a great space to learn and grow and lastly, I enjoy being a part of the projects which aims for ground impact."
