        "text": "Shaheer Sheikh has been taking his fans down the memory lane with throwback pictures right from his childhood to his projects. For someone who doesn’t quite like sharing too much on social media, Shaheer Sheikh has left his fans in awe of him as he reveals an unseen side of himself. Playing the role of Arjun in Mahabharat is one of the major career highlights for Shaheer and his chemistry with Pooja Sharma and her character Draupadi is being loved by the fans yet again as the show has been re-telecasted.\n\nShaheer Sheikh is all praises for his Mahabharat co-star Pooja Sharma, says she is a wonderful co-actor\n\nSharing a few behind-the-scenes pictures with Pooja, Shaheer couldn’t help but highlight how she has been a wonderful co-actor and is one of the most sensible human beings he knows. The caption reads, “Girls just wanna have fun ???? #swipeleft @poojabsharma A wonderful co-actor, who would put up with all our madness & mischief and still stay calm. Her fantastic work is for all to see, but even behind it all she’s one of the most sensible, balanced human beings ???? #DownMemoryLane #fromthebeginning #bachpanse #stayhome #staysafe”\n\nPooja Sharma commented on the post and clearly, she has been missing the good old days. Her comment read, “@shaheernsheikh ...????❤️...fun days indeed. I miss those days dearly????...and thank you for such lovely words Shaheer. U are becoming kinder by the day ????”\n\nTake a look at the post.\n\nShaheer and Pooja had clearly outdone themselves with their performances in Mahabharat.\n\nAlso Read: Shaheer Sheikh shares candid pictures with the Pandavas from Mahabharat, calls it the art of chilling on the sets\n\nBOLLYWOOD NEWS - LIVE UPDATES"
