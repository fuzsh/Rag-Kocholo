        "text": "Telly actress Pooja Sharma is glowing these days. The reason. Well, the Diya Aur Baati Hum fame actress is pregnant with her first child. She tied the knot with Tu Mera Hero’s director Pushkar Pandit in February 2016, which was attended by close family and friends. Now Pooja, who is all geared up to embrace motherhood, recently hosted her baby shower in Mumbai amid glitz and glamour.\n\nTaking to her official Instagram account, the TV actress shared an adorable picture of herself with her husband by her side. The caption was even more sweeter, which read, “Cant wait for the little one to come out! Spark in our eyes and so much of love in our hearts already #godbharai #parentstobe #bestestfeeling”.\n\nThe baby shower ceremony was attended by the couple’s friends and families. In one picture, Pooja and Pushkar were seen posing with Ruk Jana Nahi co- star Annirudh Dave.\n\nShe announced her pregnancy in April by sharing baby bump pictures on Instagram. Pooja and husband Pushkar Pandit expecting their first child. “Finally we can reveal why we have not been posting that many pictures lately ;) It's probably the biggest moment of our lives and we are extremely excited to announce that our bundle of joy will be arriving pretty soon”, the actress wrote.\n\nPooja Sharma rose fame by playing the lead role as Sanchi in Star Plus’s popular show Ruk Jana Nahi. After that she came into modelling and did some TV serials.\n\nHer sister Megha Sharma is also an actress. They were seen together in the show Ruk Jaana Nahi Tu Kahi Haar Ke. She was last seen in the daily series Diya Aur Baati Hum."
