        "text": "Delhi: A 26-year-old woman from Delhi, Pooja Sharma tragically lost her mother in the year 2022. She faced immense challenges when her father’s health deteriorated following the murder of her elder brother. Her father eventually went into a coma. With no male members of the family present during her brother’s funeral, Pooja found herself shouldering the responsibility of the household. These tragic life events made her realize the plight of those who have no one to bid them farewell after death. Keeping this thought in mind, she began performing last rites of unclaimed bodies.\n\nAn encouraging story\n\nPooja Sharma performs the last rites as per the religion of the deceased. She shares a story that reaffirmed her belief in following this path. A son had left home without informing his family members, and despite the exhaustive efforts to locate him, the family was unsuccessful to find him. They received the news of their son’s demise and expressed deep gratitude to Pooja for performing the last rites of their son, bringing them solace in their time of grief.\n\nFamily’s support\n\nPooja Sharma holds a postgraduate degree in social work. She was working as an HIV counsellor at Safdarjung Hospital. She has been engaged with the work of cremating unclaimed bodies since 2022. Over the years, she has bid farewell to 4000 deceased people. Her father is a contract driver in Delhi Metro and her grandmother receives a pension. They both support her in this noble endeavour.\n\nBright the Soul Foundation\n\nPerforming the last rites of a dead body comes with a cost of approximately Rs 2,200, making it financially challenging for Pooja Sharma. She has significantly cut down her expenses to support this endeavour financially. Gradually, Pooja’s efforts are gaining recognition and are inspiring others to come forward to join the initiative. Moreover, she has established an NGO called ‘Bright the Soul Foundation’ to continue her work in an organized manner."
