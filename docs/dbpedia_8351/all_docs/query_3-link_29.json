        "meta_description": "Reflecting on the plight of those left without family for their final rites, Sharma has committed to being a surrogate family member. She maintains close ties with hospital mortuaries to learn about unclaimed corpses and arranges for their transportation to the nearest cremation ground, incurring costs for her compassionate mission. With expenses ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,500 for the hearse and Rs 1,000-1,200 for the last rites, Sharma conducts funeral rituals without discrimination based on caste or faith, dressed in a blue hoodie with plaited braids and silver nail paint. Having left her job as an HIV counselor two years ago, she sustains her mission through contributions from her grandmother, who receives a pension as a martyr's wife, and her father, a contract driver in the Delhi Metro. Exhausting her personal savings, Sharma has significantly cut down on materialistic expenses, and her consistent efforts have prompted some individuals to offer financial support. Additionally, Sharma has established an NGO named Bright the Soul Foundation, focusing on the welfare of marginalized communities, with the broader aim of inspiring and empowering people through her dedicated efforts.",
