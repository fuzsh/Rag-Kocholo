        "text": "Again, a \"mysterious fire\" in Kashmir has turned Hindu properties to ash. After charred temples, now \"accidental flames\" have engulfed the abandoned houses of Kashmiri Pandits.\n\nOn July 28, four houses in Anantnag belonging to the Kashmiri Pandit minority were gutted in an overnight fire. These houses, over 100 years old, were architectural marvels and belonged to Hindu owners who were forced to flee in the 1990s due to Islamic jihad sponsored by Pakistan. But the tragedy is not simply about houses.\n\nAs the administration and police assure that \"all angles will be probed\", frustration is visible within the community. Minority Hindus are asking if they are facing sabotage to intimidate those planning to return. Some Pandits have started to renovate their properties as the situation has appeared to improve in the Kashmir Valley since 2019, and they wonder if that has triggered a reaction.\n\nUmesh Talashi, whose maternal home was one of the burnt properties, shared heart-wrenching images on the social media site X. The National Conference leader, who continues to live in Kashmir, has asked the police to \"thoroughly investigate the incident\".\n\nRajat Razdan (name changed on request) was born in 1981 and spent his childhood in one of the now-burnt houses, believed to be over 100 years old. Razdan's family was forced to flee Kashmir, and he went on to live in Jammu. But these Hindu families never sold off the property.\n\nThe house lay abandoned for 34 years. Speaking to India Today TV, Razdan shared images from visits, posing with his children in the hope they might return to the ancestral home some day.\n\nRazdan confirms that Muslims continue to live in the same vicinity, but the fire was restricted, strangely, only to the houses of Hindus.\n\nThe coincidence is not easily accepted by the community members because Pandits quote past instances from the 1980s onward, when jihadist attacks targeted and massacred Hindu families, and their houses were burnt down or encroached upon.\n\nIn fire cases over the past decade, officials have usually cited \"short-circuit\" as the cause, which Kashmiri Pandits have widely dismissed.\n\n\"None of these charred houses had an electricity connection. How would a short-circuit happen?\" asks Razdan.\n\nArun Patwari (name changed) spent his entire childhood and youth in his ancestral house, believed to be at least 200 years old, where he lived in a joint family until 1985. Like most educated Kashmiri Pandits, Patwari was appointed as a school teacher in Kashmir and looked forward to a stable future.\n\nBut destiny had other plans.\n\nPatwari lived the rest of his life in a refugee camp in Jammu, teaching students who went on to become IAS and IPS officers -- a fact he mentions with pride. Recently retired as a lecturer, Patwari decided to focus on his ancestral property in South Kashmir and started renovations.\n\n\"We were forced to leave our homeland in the 1990s, but the dream of returning never faded. I renovated my part of the house this summer, hoping to start spending days in Kashmir. I also made an advance payment,\" Patwari said.\n\nAs Patwari returned to Jammu, he received a call. \"A caretaker informed me the houses had caught fire. Our heritage home and our family history, all gone,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked about who lit the fire, Patwari cautiously replied, \"I do not know.\"\n\nOld houses had a common compound, mainly built with wood. Owners wondered if someone lit the fire in the compound, and soon flames engulfed the houses.\n\n\"We are warmly treated to tea by the neighbours and face no direct threat. But the risk prevails as terror activities continue,\" Patwari said.\n\nWhen asked if the fire at his ancestral house would delay his return to the Valley, Patwari said, \"I am not scared because I have the support of local Muslims in the neighbourhood. This is my family's land. We have to perform our karma. I have walked these streets alone, I will keep returning.\"\n\nThe Patwaris and Razdans of this village are known to be the descendants of Saint Parmanand, a renowned Kashmiri Pandit seer. They realise the last thread connecting Kashmir's spiritual history to the future is turning thin.\n\nBefore 1990, Hindus say they were approximately 60 per cent in Mattan. During the 1990s' bloody ethnic cleansing, their villages were burnt down, and soon barely a few families continued to live there. Most Hindus, despite having a house in Mattan, live in the nearby temple premises for safety reasons, protected by the Armed Forces.\n\nBut what do Kashmiri Pandits expect now from the administration?\n\nPatwari said, \"We expect the government to take over and fence our area. Otherwise, I fear encroachment by miscreants. We expect the government to help us start rebuilding from the ground up because such old houses cannot be renovated but restored.\"\n\nRazdan adds, \"I expect an independent investigation into the case for accountability and so we may know what happened that night.\"\n\nA unanimous consensus among Kashmiri Pandits on why they do not believe the fire is accidental needs only recent incidents to understand.\n\nOn June 5 in Gulmarg, the iconic Shiv Temple (also known as Rani Ka Mandir) was a landmark for devotees and tourists. The popular song \"Jai Jai Shiv Shankar\" was filmed here. The fire turned the temple into ashes, and the reason attributed, again, was a \"short-circuit\".\n\nIn January 2022, the ancient Mata Tripur Sundari temple in Kulgam got engulfed in flames late at night (in the middle of a forest terrain). Police said it was an \"accidental fire\". The same temple was burnt down in the 1990s during the terrorism era. The Hindu community rebuilt it with donations.\n\nIn December 2014, the Mata Jwala Ji Bhagwati Temple in Khrew, Pulwama, Kashmir, was destroyed by an early morning fire. The police said it was due to a \"short-circuit.\" Local Hindus of Jammu and Kashmir rebuilt this temple, and now the Indian Army helps with daily prayers.\n\nDespite the Narendra Modi government's crackdown on the terror ecosystem and efforts to encourage nationalist voices, threats against the Hindu minority remain. Innocent residents like Ajay Bharti, Makhan Lal Bindroo, and Sanjay Sharma were targeted and shot dead simply for their faith as \"soft targets\" and as steps by separatists to intimidate Hindus against plans to return.\n\nMeanwhile, Kashmiri Pandits hold on to what is left of their heritage and pass it on to their children. Every generation of this minority has had to prepare a path to rebuild their home, their temple, and their life.\n\nOnly the walls in Kashmir know who lit the fire and who watched it burn."
