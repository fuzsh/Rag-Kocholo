        "text": "Why do you Choose Astrology?\n\nAstrology reveals the destiny that God has designed for us.\n\nAstrology is a proven science with its methods and way of interpreting the influence of stars and planets on earthly affairs and human destinies.\n\nAstrology, with its scientific method of calculation and prediction of actual events, is approving enough to make people start believing in it. And it has been doing the same since the early Vedic period.\n\nIt is the study of different planets of our solar system, excluding the earth and the combination of these planets, that affect the lives of an individual. However, there are nine planets in our solar system. Still, when you consult an astrologer, they will exclude the planet Earth while understanding your chart, but surprisingly, add Rahu and Ketu while making predictions.\n\nThe planets in astrology are Sun (Surya), Moon (Chandra), Mars (Mangala), Mercury (Budha), Jupiter (Brihaspati), Venus (Shukra), Saturn (Shani), Rahu (north node of the moon), and Ketu (south node of the moon). Rahu and Ketu are also called shadow planets.\n\nFor example, if you have talked to an astrologer/Consult with an astrologer, they must have told you that there are 12 houses in Kundli, all representing different aspects of your life. You can also check your free kundli online on our website or application. Like the first house on any kundli chart, it is also the ascendant of that person, which governs his most traits and personality. Similarly, the Seventh House in the Kundli chart sits directly across from the First House. It is about partnerships, relationships, and marriage and governs a person's kidney and lower back. But when a planet like Rahu or Ketu is placed in these houses, one should Talk to Astrologer Online to minimize the negative effect or get accurate predictions.\n\nAlso, there are many other things in astrology, like Moon Sign predictions and behavior, ascendant reports of an individual, numerology, tarot, name correction, and so much more that are next to impossible to wind up here.\n\nBest Online Astrology Consultation & Services\n\nThe online presence of things and people is growing year on year.
