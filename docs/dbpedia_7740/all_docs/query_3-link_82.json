        "text": "What people are saying about We Are Stronger\n\nVeterans\n\n“My name is Irving Locker and I am a World War 2 vet who served in the Army, 116 AAA GUN BATTALLION anti-aircraft, anti-tank and artillery. I landed on D-Day at Utah Beach, went on to the Battle of the Bulge, living in the ground (fox hole) during snow, rain and the worst weather preventing all supplies from arriving. Americans stopped at the Elbe River, and I then went into Berlin to try to settle all the small towns, as I could understand German. During my service I was present for the liberation of Gardelagon Concentration Camp. I have pictures I took with my own camera. As a staff Sargent, I had men under me who experienced what is today known as PTSD. Although we did not understand it at the time, it was as real then as it is now to the vets returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. Watching this incredible movie, We Are Stronger, I was engrossed and deeply moved by the depiction of Vic, the tormented vet's disturbing battle with PTSD. His journey and the tortured parallel journey of his unknowing wife truly brought the struggle to each of our seats in the theater. In my opinion this movie is NOT to be missed. I thank and am grateful to the producer, writers and wonderful actors who made this one of the most memorable movies I have ever seen. That says a lot, as I am 93 years old. The biggest message I got from the story was NEVER GIVE UP HOPE. I thank God everyday for bringing me home alive and without any physical or mental problems.”\n\nIrving Locker\n\nWWII Veteran - Battle of the Bulge\n\nResident of The Villages, FL\n\n“My husband is a combat veteran with PTSD and we were blessed with tickets to the We Are Stronger Premiere of this movie. We watched the trailer beforehand and immediately knew this was going to be a true depiction of the life we live. We were unable to control the tears as we sat, hand in hand, and watched our lives play out on the big screen. Every word was God ordained and spoke to our inner struggles. The message of hope and healing resounded deeply within our souls as we've seen the power of recovery transform our lives. I cannot express how vital this movie is for anyone who is walking a journey with PTSD and those who love them. There IS hope, there is normalcy, and there is healing...and it can be found through Jesus Christ. If you are on the fence, thinking this is just another movie, you need to go see it with an open heart and be ready for God to work! You are not alone and there is help for you!”\n\nBoni Atzen\n\nArmy Veteran Wife\n\nConroe, TX\n\nPASTORS\n\nPTSD has hit our veterans like a scourge. With the suicide rate 400% higher for men between 18 and 29 than the national average for the same age group and 200% higher for women, over twice as many veterans died in 2014 than in the World Trade Towers on 9/11. Twenty a day: 7,403. Clearly a plague. Can the church help? According to Sebastian Junger in his book Tribe, the most glaring holes in the armor of these veterans are the inner needs of belonging, competence, self-worth, a sense of being needed, and, of course, love. What each veteran needs is a band of brothers or sisters to help them transition back into civilian life. No one is better equipped to provide that than the church. As a pastor of over forty years and currently a seminary president (leave the previous 15 words out if they don’t fit) I strongly urge your church to watch and get behind the film WE ARE STRONGER. The life you save may be a veteran in your own church."
