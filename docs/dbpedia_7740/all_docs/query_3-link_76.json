I'm Terry Gross.\n\nMy guest, Sebastian Junger, is best known as the author of the best-seller,\n\n\"The Perfect Storm,\" a nonfiction book about commercial fishermen caught in a\n\ndeadly storm. It was recently adapted to a film.\n\nJunger's new book, \"Fire,\" is a collection of his reports about, as he puts\n\nit, people confronting situations that could easily destroy them, such as\n\nforest fires and war. One of those essays is about Ahmed Shah Massoud, the\n\nleader of the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan, the rebel group that has been\n\nfighting the Taliban. Massoud was assassinated earlier this month by suicide\n\nbombers posing as journalists.\n\nLast November, Sebastian Junger traveled with Massoud and the rebels in\n\nNorthern Afghanistan on assignment for a National Geographic magazine article\n\nand TV documentary. Many people had worried that the Northern Alliance would\n\nbe decimated without its legendary leader, Massoud. I asked Sebastian Junger\n\nwhat he's hearing about what's left of the rebel group.\n\nMr. SEBASTIAN JUNGER (Author, \"Fire\"): The last word that I've had from my\n\ncontacts in the Northern Alliance, they seem to be doing OK. I mean, they\n\nhave lost a very capable and charismatic leader, but someone has stepped in to\n\ntake his place, someone who--I think Massoud probably realized there was a\n\nrisk of his assassination. There have been many attempts against his life,\n\nand I think he made sure that there was someone designated to succeed him.\n\nHis name's Mohamad Fahil(ph). He has been with Massoud since 1973. He's\n\nfought alongside him all throughout this terrible past 22 years in Afghan\n\nhistory. I met him when I was in there. I didn't have any particular reason\n\nto talk with him, so I didn't get much of a sense of him, but I have been\n\nassured that he is a very, very capable commander.\n\nGROSS: What do you know about Massoud's assassins?\n\nMr. JUNGER: I know probably what most of the rest of the world knows.\n\nThat's they're (technical difficulties) origin, traveling on Belgian\n\npassports, and they said that they were working for a Saudi television\n\nnetwork. And they actually spoke with somebody who met them, who was waiting\n\nin Hodi Valdi(ph), where Massoud was killed--and he was waiting for Massoud to\n\nappear, along with these guys, and then this man that I talked (technical\n\ndifficulties) believe. But he said that they kept to themselves a lot. They\n\ndidn't act like journalists. They didn't talk to people. They weren't\n\ncurious. They kept to themselves, and they waited.\n\nAnd they--it was obviously meant to be a suicide bombing. As far as I know,\n\nthey had no plans for escape. They had packed their television camera with\n\nexplosives. It's ironic that one of Massoud's most powerful weapons against\n\nthe Taliban was his own tremendous charisma, both in person and in front of a\n\ncamera, and I find it as a terrible irony in the fact that that ultimately\n\nbecame the instrument of his destruction.\n\nGROSS: It's also interesting, too, because the head of the Taliban is\n\nsupposed to never appear publicly, or at least rarely appear publicly, so it's\n\nthe opposite of looking good on camera, nothing near a camera.\n\nMr. JUNGER: Yes. The Mullah Omar has never been photographed, at least not\n\nthat the West knows about. I frankly have never been in the Taliban\n\nterritory. I've spoken with prisoners of war who were fighting for the\n\nTaliban on Massoud's side, but I've never been in the Taliban territory, and I\n\nreally am not sure why Mullah Omar is so secretive.\n\nGROSS: You say you considered Massoud a genius guerilla fighter. Why was he\n\nconsidered such a genius?\n\nMr. JUNGER: Well, the Afghans in general fought off one of the largest\n\nmilitary powers in the world; it took them 10 years. The Soviet Union invaded\n\nit late, late 1979, and 10 years later, they left, having lost 15,000 men.\n\nAnd his--Massoud's--tactics in particular were very effective. He was\n\ndefending the Panjshir Valley, a mountain stronghold just north of Kabul, sort\n\nof at the crossroads of Afghanistan. And the Russians realized that without\n\ncontrolling the Panjshir Valley, they would never fully control Afghanistan,\n\nand they tried, I believe, nine, maybe 10 times, 11 times to invade the\n\nPanjshir Valley with forces of tens of thousands of men and tanks, artillery,\n\nair support. Massoud had 3,000 men, and of course none of the armaments, and\n\nhe repelled their attacks every single time.\n\nWhat he would do is allow them into the valley, a classic guerilla tactic--you\n\ndon't stand and fight. He would allow them all the way into the valley, they\n\ncould take anything they wanted. He would withdraw the population so that the\n\ncivilians didn't suffer, and then he would slowly start attacking the smallest\n\noutposts and then the next smallest. And ultimately, he's a genius because,\n\nin my mind, because his tactics worked, and I feel that's a good definition of\n\ngenius. And he was widely admired and emulated by other commanders.\n\nGROSS: But so he would withdraw from the Panjshir and then do what to attack\n\nthe Soviets?\n\nMr. JUNGER: He would withdraw up into the mountains, where it was too\n\ndangerous for the Russian soldiers to go, and often at night, he would come\n\ndown and start attacking the small outposts. These guys--the Russians did not\n\nwant to be fighting. They did not want to be there. It was very easy to\n\nscare them, to spook them.\n\nMassoud, for example, before attacking the outpost, would mine the road on\n\neither side of it so that reinforcements could not come. If he attacked a\n\nconvoy, a Russian military convoy, he would take out the first and last\n\nvehicles, so that the convoy was stuck. And instead of trying to wipe the\n\nwhole convoy out, he would attack them for a while, and then pull back. He\n\ndidn't want to lose men. He didn't want to lose ammunition. And he just\n\nbasically just kept harassing them.\n\nHe would buy information. He used every tactic imaginable. He would buy\n\ninformation from Soviet soldiers. He had great, great intelligence contacts\n\nin Kabul. Apparently there were Russian generals who were selling him\n\ninformation about Russian military operations. He used every conceivable tool\n\nto fight them.\n\nAt one point, just as an example, his men had downed a Russian helicopter, and\n\nsome ingenious mechanic in the Panjshir Valley turned the body of the\n\nhelicopter into a bus. They put a diesel engine in it and some wheels and\n\nwere riding this thing around the Panjshir Valley, using it as a bus, which of\n\ncourse, was tremendously humiliating to the Russians when they got word of\n\nthis. And the next time they invaded the Panjshir Valley, Massoud left the\n\nhelicopter in plain view, so of course, the top Russian brass wanted to see\n\nthis thing, and they all crowded inside to inspect this example of Afghan\n\ningenuity, and he packed it with explosives, and he killed any number of\n\nRussian officers ...(unintelligible).\n\nGROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Sebastian Junger. You probably\n\nknow him as the author of \"The Perfect Storm.\" In his new book, \"Fire,\" one of\n\nthe essays is about meeting and traveling with Ahmed Shah Massoud, who was the\n\nhead of the resistance in Afghanistan, and was assassinated earlier this\n\nmonth.\n\nMassoud first fought against the Soviets in the '80s after the Soviets invaded\n\nAfghanistan. But then Massoud ended up fighting the Taliban in the '90s.\n\nWere his warfare techniques different against the Taliban, who were familiar\n\nwith that kind of terrain, than the Soviets, who weren't?\n\nMr. JUNGER: Yes. I think his techniques--his strategies, did change. It\n\nmay have been forced to change. The Taliban were--are directed--were formed\n\nunder Pakistan's direction, and are still directed by them, and materially\n\naided by Pakistan. And so you had a conventional army, generals in a\n\nconventional army who are dictating the terms of war. The war was not a\n\nhit-and-run guerilla warfare against the Taliban. It ended up being real,\n\nalmost World War I front-line, entrenched positions, that sort of fighting,\n\ntremendous artillery bombardments.\n\nThe attacks, when they came, were sometimes across open grounds, masses of men\n\nrising up and charging the other side, and Massoud found himself locked into a\n\nreal front-line, conventional war situation. That was exactly the kind of\n\nfighting that I saw late last fall. What Massoud said was that that had\n\nworked to hold them off, hold off the Taliban, but in order to really start to\n\nchip away at their defenses, he was going to now, while holding the front line\n\nthat stretched from the Tajik border up to Kabul, he was going to initiate\n\nguerilla actions way in the rear of their territory, of the Taliban territory.\n\nAnd we've seen that in the past few months, a commander named Ishmael Han(ph)\n\nhas taken a large swath of territory in the far western part of Afghanistan,\n\nhundreds of miles away from the front line where the Northern Alliance\n\nsupposedly is positioned. The Northern Alliance has little spots of territory\n\nall over remote areas of Afghanistan, and again, it has gone back to classic\n\nguerrilla war, and that was Massoud's next phase for his grand strategy, that\n\nmay have taken years and years, to topple the Taliban.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Sebastian Junger. We'll talk more after a break. This is\n\nFRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: My guest is Sebastian Junger. His new book, \"Fire,\" includes his\n\nessay about traveling with Ahmed Shah Massoud, the leader of the Afghan\n\nresistance group fighting the Taliban. Massoud was assassinated earlier this\n\nmonth.\n\nDid you talk to Massoud about why he opposed the Taliban, because really, the\n\npeople in the Taliban and the people in the Mujahedeen were on the same side\n\nagainst the Soviets, although the Taliban were children in the war with the\n\nSoviets. They would have been too young to fight. A lot of the Taliban were\n\nthe grown-up version of the child refugees of the war with the Soviets.\n\nMr. JUNGER: Yes. Massoud told me this, but many other Afghans who I spoke\n\nwith in the northeast, in the territory of the Northern Alliance, also told me\n\nthis, that they were fighting the Taliban because they considered it a foreign\n\ninvasion. They considered it an invasion by Pakistan. The Taliban troops,\n\nthey felt, were being not just manipulated, but guided and materially\n\nsupported by the Pakistani army, and while I was there, a Taliban fighter\n\npilot had defected to Massoud's side, and the reason that he gave--he landed\n\nin the Northern Alliance territory--and the reason he gave was that he\n\nrealized that he was fighting for Pakistan, for a foreign invader, and he was\n\nan Afghan, and he wasn't going to do this any more.\n\nI think there are many, many layers and subtleties for the reasons that\n\nMassoud and other Afghans were fighting the Taliban, but that seemed to be the\n\nstrongest one. There also was, I should say, a very widespread belief that\n\nsociety in the Taliban areas was not a free society, it was not a benevolent\n\nsociety, it didn't have anything to do with Islam; the suppression of rights,\n\nthe suppression of education, of entertainment, the suppression of joy,\n\nalmost, that that really had nothing to do with Afghanistan and with Islam,\n\nand it really broke their hearts, that that was how Afghanistan was now\n\nbecoming characterized, by those strictures, and they wanted to retake not\n\nonly Afghanistan territorially, but they wanted to take over the spirit of it,\n\nand the heart of it and re-institute a fair and free society, which, in fact,\n\nwas what I saw in the Northern Alliance territories.\n\nI saw women working. Some women had veils, because it's a very traditional\n\nIslamic culture. But some women didn't. It really seemed to be the choice of\n\nthe woman, or at least her family. It certainly was not enforced by the\n\nauthorities, by the government. People played music. They played chess. It\n\nwas a very, very poor place and, as I said, quite traditional. But there was\n\na sort of light-heartedness to the society and a freedom that I really liked\n\nand I think would have been completely missing on the other side.\n\nGROSS: Let's get back to Pakistan. You said that Massoud saw the Taliban as\n\nalmost a foreign invasion, more of a Pakistani force than an Afghani force.\n\nWhat was the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan?\n\nMr. JUNGER: Well, I think it's been quite well established that the Taliban\n\nin the early '90s came out of the Afghan refugee camps along the\n\nAfghan-Pakistan border. And there's quite a lot of evidence that the\n\nPakistani intelligence service, the ISI, really had quite a lot to do with\n\nrecruiting those young men and giving them a very (technical difficulties)\n\neducation in the madrases, the religious schools in Pakistan. Of course, that\n\neducation had a heavily military agenda and by 1994 they were a force to be\n\nreckoned with in Afghanistan.\n\nThe ISI, the Pakistani government continued to direct them and ultimately when\n\nthey were locked in battle with Massoud, apparently they would overhear radio\n\ncommunications between Pakistani soldiers--I interviewed a Pakistani soldier\n\nwho had been taken as a prisoner of war by Massoud's forces. They could hear\n\nPakistani generals who apparently were on leave from their own positions in\n\nPakistan. They would go north to help the Taliban in their strategies against\n\nMassoud. And there is even evidence--I mean, I haven't seen this; I have to\n\ntake Massoud at his word--they even had intelligence that there were Pakistani\n\narmored divisions and regular Pakistani soldiers fighting alongside the\n\nTaliban.\n\nCertainly I can say from my own experience--I interviewed in a prisoner of war\n\ncamp about 20 foreign volunteers, many of them Pakistani. They were also from\n\nBurma, from North Africa, from Saudi Arabia. They said, `We are here to\n\nestablish a fundamentalist Islamic state in Afghanistan and to use that as a\n\nbase from which to export fundamentalist Islam throughout central Asia'--in\n\nUzbekistan Tajikistan, all of those countries--Garigezistan. All of those\n\ncountries have Islamic insurgencies within their borders. These men were\n\nvery, very frank about it, and they said, `Massoud is the last wall'--that was\n\nthe word they used--`the last wall that stands between us and what we are\n\ntrying to accomplish.'\n\nGROSS: Why would Pakistan want to train extremist Muslims to take over\n\nAfghanistan? What's in it for Pakistan? Or what was in it for Pakistan?\n\nMr. JUNGER: Well, the geopolitics of that area are incredibly complicated.\n\nOn a very simple level, I think they wanted to control Afghanistan because in\n\npart--this is what I heard--it provided them with a rear base in their\n\nconflict with India. The sort of religious extremism that characterizes the\n\nTaliban is, of course, a very easy force to harness if you want to throw young\n\nmen against, say, the Indian army in Kashmir or, for that matter, against\n\nMassoud. Massoud during the Soviet times, what they call the Soviet times,\n\nthe war against the Soviets in the '80s, was a very, very independent thinker.\n\nHe apparently even got a bit of a bad reputation with the CIA for not\n\nfollowing directions from foreign powers, from the CIA.\n\nWell, he didn't follow directions from Pakistan either. He really made his\n\nown decisions. At one point, he made a local peace treaty with the Russians\n\nfor the Panjshir Valley. The CIA considered that a tremendous betrayal. You\n\nknow, basically you were either with the Communists or you were killing them.\n\nAnd here was Massoud cutting a temporary local peace deal. What it enabled\n\nhim to do was to forget about the Panjshir Valley, which was so important and\n\ntaking up all of his time, and travel throughout the rest of Afghanistan\n\norganizing the kind of resistance that he had organized in the Panjshir\n\nValley. It was a brilliant move and I think that quality of Massoud's really\n\nspooked the foreign powers involved in Afghanistan. I think it continues to.\n\nI think for Pakistan, they were almost irrationally upset by the idea of\n\nMassoud controlling Afghanistan, even though he apparently had very little\n\npolitical ambition.\n\nThe impression I had of Massoud as a man is of someone who was just exhausted\n\nby over 20 years of war, living in very, very difficult conditions. And I\n\nreally had the feeling that he may not even have started his life in this way\n\nbut that he maybe even grown into the realization that peace was the most\n\nimportant thing. He seemed a man just absolutely desperate for peace. And I\n\nasked him, `What do you want to do after the fighting's over?' He said, `I\n\nwant to retire to the Panjshir Valley and read my books and that's just about\n\nit.'\n\nGROSS: Since Pakistan's in a really funny spot now, if Pakistan helped to\n\ncreate the Taliban and now we're insisting that Pakistan join our alliance and\n\nthey have, at least to some extent, that's a really paradoxical position to be\n\nin.\n\nMr. JUNGER: Yes. Pakistan is in an excruciating position. On the one hand,\n\nthey really do have--morally they have to help the West in the fight against\n\nterrorism. On the other hand, they did play a very strong role in creating\n\nthe Taliban. And there are many, many supporters of the Taliban in Pakistan\n\nand there is a very, very strong fundamentalist Muslim ideology in Pakistan.\n\nThe president of Pakistan, Musharraf, is not in a completely strong and stable\n\nposition. And he fears, I think many people in the State Department fear,\n\nthat it wouldn't take much to cause an overthrow of the Musharraf government\n\nand in its place there would be an extremely reactionary Islamic leadership\n\nwhich ultimately might create a more dangerous country than Afghanistan is\n\nright now. You could almost say it would be Afghanistan with nuclear weapons.\n\nFurther complicating the problem is there's about a third of Pakistan which is\n\nnot even directly controlled by the Pakistani government. It's called the\n\ntribal territories. It is filled with ethnic Pushtuns. Pushtuns make up the\n\nmajority of the Taliban population. And it is a very, very wild and\n\nungovernable place. It's the kind of place where if you were not hiding in\n\nAfghanistan, you might choose to hide along the Afghan border but inside\n\nPakistan, among the Pushtun people, who have a tremendous solidarity, a sort\n\nof tribal solidarity with each other. It's a very tricky force to tangle with\n\nand try to manipulate.\n\nGROSS: Sebastian Junger. His new collection of essays is called \"Fire.\"\n\nHe'll be back in the second half of the show. I'm Terry Gross, and this is\n\nFRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with journalist Sebastian\n\nJunger. He's the author of \"The Perfect Storm.\" His new book, \"Fire,\" is a\n\ncollection of his articles about people confronting situations that could\n\neasily destroy them, such as forest fires and war. One of the articles is\n\nabout Ahmed Shah Massoud, the leader of the Afghan resistance group fighting\n\nthe Taliban. Massoud was assassinated earlier this month. Junger went to\n\nAfghanistan last fall to talk with Massoud and observe him in action.\n\nDid you watch him directly in battle?\n\nMr. JUNGER: Well, he wasn't--he didn't have a gun in his hand charging the\n\nenemy, but, yes, I did. He was directing the attacks from command bunkers on\n\nhilltops. The attacks would start with tremendous barrages of Katusha rockets\n\nand tank fire and artillery fire. And then the men would attack on the\n\nground, generally at night. They were attacking a very strong, entrenched\n\nposition on a ridgeline that ran for miles and miles. And I was just amazed.\n\nI mean, we were just watching this sort of light show that was about a mile--a\n\ncouple of miles away and you could see this. Through the flashes of light you\n\ncould see this attack going on. These men just went straight up this hill\n\nthrough mine fields into machine gun fire and topped out on the ridge and took\n\nthese trenches. It was just tremendous, tremendous bravery.\n\nFortunately, the Taliban--the mood among the Taliban, even then, was quite\n\ndemoralized. And one of the reasons that Massoud's casualties were relatively\n\nlight was that the Taliban really would just run away. At times they would\n\njust run away. The guys who didn't run away were the foreign volunteers, the\n\nSaudis, bin Laden's men. Those were the really hard-core fighters. And when\n\nthey--when the Taliban really needed to hold a line, they didn't use local\n\nAfghan conscripts who were given a gun and stuck in a trench and maybe didn't\n\neven support the Taliban. They relied on the foreign volunteers. And those\n\nguys were scary. Massoud's men really had their hands full in dealing with\n\nthose guys.\n\nGROSS: Do you think that Massoud actually expected to win in his fight\n\nagainst the Taliban or do you think he just--it was just that he refused to\n\ngive up, even though he didn't expect to win?\n\nMr. JUNGER: I think that he--his long-term strategy was to remain in place\n\nlong enough for what is, frankly, a very unstable regime, to start cracking\n\nfrom within or long enough for Pakistan to realize that they could not\n\ncontinue--politically, financially, militarily could not continue pouring the\n\nresources into the Taliban movement, into Afghanistan that they had been\n\npouring for years. If the Pakistan support--Pakistani support dried up\n\neither from foreign pressure or just simply lack of will, that the Taliban,\n\non their own, really would not have presented much of a problem to him.\n\nThere were also armed insurrections within the Taliban territory, local\n\nvillages where they did not want their young men being sent to the front line\n\nto fight other Muslims. They just didn't want to do it. And the Taliban\n\nwould have to put down these rebellions with contingents of armed soldiers;\n\n300, 400 soldiers would have to go to these areas and put down the rebellion.\n\nThat was already happening within Taliban territory.\n\nYou have to understand that when the Taliban initially came in, Afghanistan\n\nwas just a lawless hell. I mean, I was there. Warlords controlled different\n\npieces of the highway. There was internal fighting. The would be villages\n\nfighting other villages, tremendous corruption and crime and violence and\n\npeople were sick of it. They had been through this for 15 years with the\n\nSoviets and now this. They were doing it to each other. And the Taliban came\n\nin and, OK, they were--they had a rather extreme vision of Islam, but they\n\npromised to, basically, clean up the town. They promised to bring peace and\n\norder to Afghanistan.\n\nAnd they made good on their promise, but they almost brought too much order.\n\nThe punishments for crimes were extremely severe. You'd get your hand chopped\n\noff. You'd be executed. Adulterers were stoned to death and the population,\n\nafter a few years of relief--`Well, thank God, you know, stability has\n\ncome'--I think they started to bridle under these new Taliban strictures.\n\nThey didn't realize that that actually was what they had coming to them with\n\nthe Taliban leadership.\n\nComplicating it further was there's been, I believe, five years of drought in\n\nAfghanistan, so the Taliban, through no fault of their own, did not bring\n\nprosperity. The time--forget the war. Just in terms of the drought, times\n\nare very, very hard there. There's a tremendous amount of hunger. And that,\n\nof course, doesn't help the mood of the population, either.\n\nGROSS: You must be wondering, as I am talking to you, if the United States is\n\ncovertly, now, sponsoring the Northern Alliance, which Massoud led until a\n\ncouple of weeks ago.\n\nMr. JUNGER: Yes. I think a lot of people are wondering that. I believe\n\nCondoleezza Rice was asked that on television yesterday and did a magnificent\n\njob of not quite answering it. And, of course, I listened because I was very\n\ncurious. I think maybe it's a wise thing that they're being a little bit\n\ncircumspect about this, but what the Northern Alliance--my contacts in the\n\nNorthern Alliance, people who were very, very close to Massoud, have said to\n\nme about it--I've been in contact with them a lot in the past two weeks. They\n\nsaid that they do not--it is not their wish that more Americans die; that\n\nenough precious American lives have been lost in this tragedy in New York and\n\nin Washington and they do not--it is not their wish that Americans come to\n\nAfghanistan to die like the Russians did. What they want is help. They want\n\nmilitary aid. Basically, what they are offering is, `We know the territory.\n\nWe know how to fight like this. We know our enemy. We will do the fighting\n\nand, if need be, we will do the dying for you. Just support us. Isolate\n\nPakistan and the Taliban militarily, economically, politically and help us on\n\nthe ground and we will do it for you.' I'm sure that the US government is\n\nconsidering that as an option.\n\nGROSS: Sebastian Junger, where were you on September 11th?\n\nMr. JUNGER: I was in Moldova. I was on an assignment on trafficking in\n\nwomen in the Balkans, a very, very sad story in its own right. And I was in a\n\nsmall city called Kahul in the south of Moldova. I got a call--my translator\n\ngot a call on her cell phone that something terrible had happened in the US,\n\nand we didn't quite believe it. And we rushed back to Kishnel(ph). And on\n\nthe way back my translator called her mother, who does not speak English but\n\nhad access to a television. And she said to her mother, `Please turn on CNN\n\nand just tell me what you're looking at.' And her mother did that and just\n\nstarted sobbing. And we knew it was true.\n\nGROSS: You live in New York. In fact, you own a bar in Manhattan. What was\n\nyour reaction when you found out what had happened?\n\nMr. JUNGER: My reaction wasn't so much as a New Yorker. It was more as an\n\nAmerican and, frankly, as a citizen of the world. It felt like, `My God,\n\nthis is a possible scenario for another global war.' I was really scared for\n\nus all. People in Moldova would come up to me, very, very sweetly, and say,\n\n`I'm so sorry what happened in your country.' And I wanted to say to them,\n\n`You know, we're now talking about all of us. There no longer is the welfare\n\nof one particular country or another particular country. We now see that it's\n\nall interrelated.' And we, the world, are in tremendous danger right now and\n\nwe have to handle--we, the United States and the entire world, has got to\n\nhandle this crisis correctly. We cannot do something that further fractures\n\nrelations between the West and the Islamic world. I fear that that may be\n\nexactly what bin Laden's trying to do and we have to take great care not to do\n\nthat.\n\nGROSS: What do you think would be playing into his plans?\n\nMr. JUNGER: This is purely conjecture from a man who reads the newspaper\n\nevery day, but I think that one strategy might be to provoke a massive\n\nmilitary response by the US and polarize the world between West--the West and\n\nthe Muslim world; to galvanize support even among Muslims who condemned the\n\nWorld Trade Center bombing, but, of course, they don't want their fellow\n\nMuslims to be subject to a military attack. And so there might be a--maybe\n\nthe thinking of these terrorists is, `If we can provoke a massive attack, we\n\ncan generate a unity among Muslims that overrides their own particular horror\n\nat what was done in New York.' That would be a terrible tragedy for\n\neverybody and I--again, I'm sure and I hope that the people in our government\n\nare thinking about that. I'm very heartened by the fact that our country is\n\ntaking its time in preparing a response. I think that's really a wonderful\n\nsign that we're proceeding very wisely and examining all the possible\n\nrepercussions, politically, socially, in a military action.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Sebastian Junger. His new book is called \"Fire.\" We'll\n\ntalk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Sebastian Junger. He's the\n\nauthor of the best-seller \"The Perfect Storm.\" His new book, \"Fire,\" is a\n\ncollection of essays and reporting. And one of the pieces is about Ahmed Shah\n\nMassoud, who was the leader of the resistance in Afghanistan, but he was\n\nassassinated a little less than a couple of weeks ago.\n\nI'm wondering about you and your interest in people in extremes. I mean,\n\nthis last extreme kind of came to you, but you've been in search of it for\n\nmany years, you know, in writing the book \"The Perfect Storm.\" Your new\n\ncollection, \"Fire,\" is reporting from various war zones, reporting on people\n\nwho fight huge fires. What attracts you to that state of extreme?\n\nMr. JUNGER: We'll have to go back 10 years. I couldn't make a living as a\n\nwriter, as a journalist and I was working as a climber for tree companies and\n\nwriting a little bit on the side, sort of struggling with it. And I hurt\n\nmyself quite badly. And it got me thinking many people in America don't\n\nrealize that there are jobs that are tremendously dangerous that people are\n\ndoing every day. They get hurt at them. They get killed on them. And there\n\nwas a time, the early '90s, in America when people were more and more sort of\n\nenamored of adventure sports, extreme sports, which, of course, are very\n\ndramatic and very impressive as sort of feats of human endurance and skill,\n\nbut they don't directly help anyone. Society doesn't need more people to\n\nclimb mountains, however impressive that is.\n\nBut they do need people to drill for oil, to fish, to farm and fight fires.\n\nAnd I thought in maybe a somewhat grandiose way, `I'm going to write a book\n\non dangerous jobs and I'm going to tell America how amazing these people are;\n\nhow important their jobs are.' They're running risks that sometimes\n\nare--outweigh the risks run by people in extreme sports and they're doing\n\nsomething necessary. They're doing maybe something even noble in doing the\n\nwork that needs to be done in our nation. And so I picked out forest\n\nfirefighters and commercial fishermen to start on. And I flew out West and\n\nhung out with these hotshot crews in 1992. And then after that I wrote about\n\ncommercial fishermen in my book, \"The Perfect Storm.\" That was the start of\n\nwhat is now my career.\n\nAnd I find it tragic and ironic that it took the death of so many good people,\n\nfiremen and policemen, at the World Trade Center to finally bring that\n\nrecognition. Look, this job is important. Think about these guys. Think\n\nwhat they're doing. They--I mean, they rushed--those guys--I don't know what\n\nthey're paid a year; $30,000 a year or something like that. They were rushing\n\nup 110 flights of a skyscraper to help people, some of whom made 10 times that\n\nmuch. And just the class issues alone really amaze me that the desire to save\n\nhuman life on the part of these guys transcends every other issue, including\n\ntheir own safety. I just found that incredibly moving, and I'm so glad that\n\nthe American public now is sort of become focused on that and is so\n\nappreciative. It's a wonderful thing.\n\nGROSS: Is physical courage something you feel you really understand or have\n\nmuch of, yourself?\n\nMr. JUNGER: No and no. I'm not sure what physical courage is. I think\n\nordinary people--and I think I might include myself in that--can do\n\ntremendously courageous things in a situation that demands it. And at other\n\ntimes they're just paralyzed by fear. And I've been in situations where I\n\nwas really, absolutely terrified. One was in Afghanistan during a certain\n\nnasty incident we were caught in. I was amazed at my capacity for fear. I\n\nmean, I was amazed that it could come--that the feeling of fear could\n\ncompletely fill me from my toes to the top of my head. I didn't know that,\n\nyou know.\n\nI've been in other situations where I think I acted--or rather that I\n\nresponded in a more sort of controlled and effective way. So I think it\n\nreally depends from moment to moment how any person reacts to danger. I think\n\nwe all have the capacity to face tremendous danger, tremendous fear, if\n\nsomeone--if another person is at risk, particularly someone we love. I think\n\nthat really transcends just about anything. But I've never been in that\n\nsituation, fortunately.\n\nGROSS: So what happened in Afghanistan when you were totally filled up with\n\nfear?\n\nMr. JUNGER: We were caught. We went up to the front line to a position that\n\nhad just been taken from the Taliban. I mean, the guns--the Taliban guns\n\nwere still pointing the wrong way. They hadn't even turned the guns around\n\nyet. It was a hilltop position and it took half the day to walk out there.\n\nAnd just as we got there the Taliban, who were not that far away, started a\n\nrocket attack. And these rockets were just raining down on the position and\n\nwe were all curled up in the trenches. And what scared me most was the idea\n\nthat we wouldn't be able to get out of there. The day was ending. It was\n\nstarting to get dark. I figured that they would probably keep this up all\n\nnight.\n\nAnd it's hard to explain how terrifying it is to hear a rocket come at you.\n\nYou could hear this whistling sound as it comes in and then this incredible\n\ndetonation. And it's absolutely terrifying. The idea of going through that\n\nall night just seemed to much to bear. And, of course, that would be a\n\nprelude to an attack on the ground. And I didn't know if the men I was with\n\ncould hold that position. And if they couldn't, if we were overrun, almost\n\nanything could have happened. And I was just curled up there thinking, you\n\nknow, I don't want to do this to my family, first of all, to die on this\n\nhilltop. This isn't my hilltop and this is not my country and I don't belong\n\nin this situation right now. I owe it to the people who love me to not be\n\nhere. I can do my journalism in a somewhat different way. And it was a very,\n\nvery valuable insight to have.\n\nGROSS: You have spent years travelling to places where people are working in\n\nextremes and where people are risking their lives for the work that they do.\n\nYou come home and your home, Manhattan, is--you know, has been the subject of\n\na terrorist attack. There have been a lot of people who have not only risked\n\ntheir lives, but given their lives in the hopes of saving others. And all the\n\nthings that you've gone for in other people's disasters are now on your\n\ndoorstep at home.\n\nMr. JUNGER: Yes. That made me very sad. It was--that was maybe--that was\n\none of the really difficult things to think about was that now none of us have\n\na refuge. One of the things that makes--psychologically speaking, makes war\n\nand reporting in war zones possible--at least for me--is that even if you\n\ndon't exercise this option, you know that you can leave and you can go home to\n\na refuge, the United States, this wonderful country with all its liberties and\n\nits safety and its freedom. That's what's waiting for you at home. And you\n\ncould spend a year in Rwanda, you know, or some terrible, terrible situation\n\nand you know that you can go back and (technical difficulties). Now I realize\n\nthat there is no place to go back to. And that's terrible for me. It's\n\nterrible for everyone. And it's gonna take a long time, I think, for me to\n\nfully digest the implications of that.\n\nGROSS: Well, Sebastian Junger, I want to thank you very much for talking\n\nwith us.\n\nMr. JUNGER: Thank you.\n\nGROSS: Sebastian Junger's new collection of essays is called \"Fire.\" It\n\nincludes his piece about Ahmed Shah Massoud. Junger's documentary on Massoud\n\nwill be shown tonight on the National Geographic Channel. Junger is also the\n\nauthor of \"The Perfect Storm.\"\n\nThe postponed new TV season has begun. Coming up, TV critic David Bianculli\n\ntunes in. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nReview: New fall TV season\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nThe fall TV season began yesterday, belatedly, and TV critic David Bianculli\n\nis starting to refocus on the new and returning shows, somewhat reluctantly.\n\nDAVID BIANCULLI reporting:\n\nI'm still not sure I'm ready for this. Does it really matter what the best\n\nnew show of the fall season is--or the worst? Do people care anymore how\n\nBuffy comes back to life on \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" or whether Rachel is\n\npregnant on \"Friends\"? And do I care?\n\nHere's what I do know. When I previewed all 10 hours of the HBO World War II\n\nminiseries \"Band of Brothers\" before the attack on New York and Washington, I\n\nremember one feeling very distinctly. The battle scenes in that drama were\n\nso intense and so unrelenting and frightening that I began to cherish the\n\nmoments when things were quiet. I became grateful for the peace. I became\n\nhungry for normal.\n\nThat's the way I feel today, two weeks after the terrorist attacks. When I\n\nlook up at my wall of TV sets right now, I don't see Dan Rather and Peter\n\nJennings and Tom Brokaw. I see \"Everybody Loves Raymond\" and \"Monday Night\n\nFootball\" and \"Frasier.\" What this means to me and, I suspect, to you is\n\nthings are better than they could be. Someday soon, I'm afraid, we're going\n\nback to wall-to-wall news and not for the last time. But in between, prime\n\ntime TV will serve up some moments of peace. So I guess just as I welcomed\n\nthe quiet in \"Band of Brothers,\" I should welcome the new and returning fall\n\nshows. I suspect as a country we're going to gravitate more immediately and\n\nemotionally to returning, familiar shows than to new ones; checking in on\n\n\"Frasier\" or \"Friends\" or \"Once And Again,\" all of which return with season\n\npremieres this week, will be a good thing.\n\nSo the worthwhile shows that are coming back this week, in case you want to\n\nfind them, include the following: \"Spin City\" and \"Frasier,\" tonight; Drew\n\nCarey in \"Law & Order\" tomorrow; \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" and the\n\nentire NBC lineup on Thursday; \"That's Life\" and \"Once And Again\" on Friday\n\nand \"Saturday Night Live\" this weekend, which ought to be really interesting,\n\nunder the circumstances.\n\nAlso, \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" returns a week from tonight with a two-hour\n\nseason premiere that is every bit as good as I'd hoped. Also next week, Aaron\n\nSorkin presents a special, last-second episode of the \"West Wing,\" reacting to\n\nthe terrorist attacks. So the old shows are not only coming back; some of\n\nthem are coming back with a vengeance.\n\nAs for the new ones, I'll keep it simple. Some of the best ones, \"24\" on Fox,\n\n\"Smallville\" on The WB, don't show up until the second half of October. The\n\nother premiere tonight and tomorrow; \"Undeclared\" tonight on Fox and\n\n\"Enterprise\" tomorrow night on UPN.\n\n\"Enterprise\" is the latest entry in the \"Star Trek\" franchise, but is fresh\n\ninstead of stale. It's a prequel, so we're setting out on the maiden voyage\n\nof the Starship Enterprise 100 years before Captain Kirk. Nothing works, no\n\none gets along and everything and every alien is new. It's an approach that\n\nreinvigorates the entire, well, I was going to say enterprise, but you get the\n\nidea. And it also works because of the new captain, played by \"Quantum Leap\"\n\nstar Scott Bakula. He's just right for this role, and UPN should have a hit\n\non its hands, by UPN standards, anyway.\n\nAs for tonight's \"Undeclared,\" it's the kind of comedy TV doesn't make much of\n\nanymore. In other words, it's a funny comedy. It stars Jay Baruchel as\n\nSteven, a college freshman sharing a co-ed floor with a half dozen other\n\nyoungsters seeking to define and redefine themselves. The humor comes not\n\nfrom punch lines, but from characters and by the time the first episode is\n\nover tonight, you'll know and like every one of them.\n\nTo me, though, the secret weapon is singer/songwriter Loudon Wainwright, who\n\nplays Steven's father. On his son's first night at college, he drops in with\n\nthe surprising news that Steven's mother has asked him for a divorce. They\n\nstart to have a father-son talk, but it doesn't last long.\n\n(Soundbite from \"Undeclared\")\n\nMr. JAY BARUCHEL (As Steven): What happens to mother now?\n\nMr. LOUDON WAINWRIGHT III (As Steven's Father): She says she's miserable;\n\ndoesn't want to have sex; she feels dead inside; life is passing her by. I\n\ndon't know.\n\nMr. BARUCHEL: I don't want to talk about this. Dad, we're in the middle of\n\na party, OK? This is my first day at school.\n\nMr. WAINWRIGHT: Steven, I've given my entire life to you, so if I need to\n\ntalk to you, you're gonna listen.\n\nMr. BARUCHEL: I'm sorry. So why do you think Mom feels dead inside?\n\nMr. WAINWRIGHT: I don't know.\n\nMr. BARUCHEL: Has she said why she doesn't want to have sex with you?\n\nMr. WAINWRIGHT: You know what? You're right. This is not the time. I\n\ndon't want to ruin your first night, so I'm gonna go crash at Uncle Bill's.\n\nMr. BARUCHEL: OK. Good stuff.\n\nMr. WAINWRIGHT: I just wanted to let you know that's where I'm gonna be in\n\ncase you want to get in touch, all right?\n\nMr. BARUCHEL: Cool. Thanks.\n\nMr. WAINWRIGHT: We'll talk about this tomorrow.\n\nMr. BARUCHEL: Right. Yeah.\n\nMr. WAINWRIGHT: All right. So have fun at the party.\n\nMr. BARUCHEL: Thank you. Have fun at Uncle Bill's.\n\nMr. WAINWRIGHT: All right. I will.\n\nMr. BARUCHEL: Cool.\n\nBIANCULLI: I laughed at \"Undeclared\" a lot and so did my high school and\n\ncollege-age kids when we first watched the preview tape before the attacks.\n\nI put the tape back in the other day and watched again and laughed again.\n\nThese days, I don't think there's any higher praise I can deliver.\n\nGROSS: David Bianculli is TV critic for the New York Daily News.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\n(Credits)"
