        "text": "Junger History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nGermany\n\nThe ancestral home of the Junger family is in the German province of Bavaria. Junger is a German nickname surname. Such names came from eke-names, or added names, that described their initial bearer through reference to a physical characteristic or other attribute. Junger is a name for a young person or the junior member of a family or community, being derived from the German word \"jung,\" which means \"young\" as in \"young man.\"\n\nThe root name Jüngling is typically Anglicized as Juengling, Jungling, Yuengling, Yungling, and Yingling.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Junger family\n\nThe surname Junger was first found in Bavaria, where this family name became a prominent contributor to the development of the district from ancient times. Always prominent in social affairs, the name became an integral part of that turbulent region as it emerged to form alliances with other families within the Feudal System and the nation. The name \"Jung\" (English: Young) had the original meaning of \"junior,\" an addition to a name which would reflect the bearer's status or age, as well as distinguish him or her from the father, or \"senior.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Junger family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Junger research. Another 74 words (5 lines of text) covering the years 1740 and 1817 are included under the topic Early Junger History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nJunger Spelling Variations\n\nMany cultural groups lived in the German states in medieval times. Each had its own dialect and traditions, and unique variations of popular names. Low German, which is similar to contemporary Dutch, was spoken in Westphalia. German names are characterized by additions such as regional suffixes and phrases that tell something about the origin or background of its original bearer. Further contributing to the variation in German names was the fact that there were no spelling rules in medieval times: scribes recorded names according to their sound. The recorded spelling variations of Junger include Jung, Juenger, Jungg, Junge, Jungge, Jungher, Jungblut, Jungbauer, June, Deyoung, Young, Jungbluth, Jungblud, Deshong, Jonker, Junker, Jungling, Jüngling and many more.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Junger family\n\nMore information is included under the topic Early Junger Notables in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nJunger migration to the United States +\n\nThousands of German settlers came to North America between the mid-17th and mid-20th centuries. The hardships of the long voyage were balanced by the opportunity to escape poverty and religious persecution. The descendents of these settlers still populate the states of Pennsylvania, Texas, New York, Illinois, and California. Many also live in Ontario and the prairie provinces of Canada. An inquiry into the early roots of North American families has revealed a number of immigrants bearing the name Junger or a variant listed above:\n\nJunger Settlers in United States in the 18th Century\n\nJohan Paul Junger, who landed in Pennsylvania in 1748 1\n\nPaul Junger, who arrived in Pennsylvania in 1748 1\n\nJacob Junger, who landed in Pennsylvania in 1749 1\n\nI Daniel Junger, who arrived in Pennsylvania in 1752 1\n\nJoh Fred Junger, who arrived in Pennsylvania in 1753 1\n\n...
