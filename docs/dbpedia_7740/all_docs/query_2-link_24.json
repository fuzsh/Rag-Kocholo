McMaster and Sebastian Junger discuss the necessity of unity, the importance of the tribe, and the future of American democracy, Wednesday, November 8, 2023.\n\nAward-winning journalist, bestselling author, and documentary filmmaker Sebastian Junger joins Senior Fellow H.R. McMaster to explore the lessons that can be drawn from his books on the necessity of unity and the importance of the tribe for the future of American democracy. Reflecting on his own observations about war, society, and freedom, Junger discusses how civilians can better understand the experiences of those who fight on their behalf, the importance of shared responsibility and communal values, and how Western societies can regain a sense of belonging.\n\nABOUT THE SPEAKERS\n\nSebastian Junger is a journalist and war correspondent, and the bestselling author of six books: The Perfect Storm, Fire, A Death in Belmont, War, Tribe, and Freedom. Junger has received the National Magazine Award and a Peabody Award. His debut documentary film, Restrepo, was nominated for an Academy Award.
