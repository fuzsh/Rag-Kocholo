        "text": "JUDY WOODRUFF:\n\nFinally tonight, we add another book to our summer reading list.\n\nIt's a modern take on what we can learn from tribal societies when it comes to loyalty, belonging and the quest for meaning.\n\nAt the recent BookExpo America in Chicago, Jeffrey Brown talked to journalist and author Sebastian Junger. His new book is \"Tribe: On Homecoming and Belonging.\"\n\nJEFFREY BROWN:\n\nStart with the definition. What do you mean by tribe?\n\nSEBASTIAN JUNGER, Author, \"Tribe\": The real an ancient meaning of tribe is the community that you live in that you share resources with that you would risk your life to defend.\n\nI mean, that's the real meaning of tribe. Of course, in modern society, that structure, that tribal structure has been lost. That loss of tribe also costs people psychologically.\n\nSEBASTIAN JUNGER:\n\nIt was a 20-man position, everyone sleeping basically shoulder to shoulder in the dirt at first and then in these little hooches.\n\nAnd it was very intimate, very close, very connected, emotionally connected experience. And after the deployment, which was — the deployment was hellish. And afterward the deployment, a lot of those guys missed the combat and they didn't want to come home to America.\n\nWhat is it about modern society that's so repellent even to people that are from there? And my book \"Tribe\" is an attempt to answer that question.\n\nSEBASTIAN JUNGER:\n\nWell, humans lose the ability to connect emotionally with people after a certain number, right at 150.\n\nSo there is a limit to the number of people we can connect with and that we can feel capable of sacrificing ourselves for if need be.\n\nSEBASTIAN JUNGER:\n\nI think the reason those things feel good is because they come close enough to replicating the connections of tribe that it's sort of familiar in human terms.\n\nThey're not tribes. Tribes, really, you have to live with the people in your tribe for it to be a tribe in the sort of ancient sense. Now, what happens when society experiences a collapse, like the Blitz in London or an earthquake or something like that, is that people are forced into communal situations with each other in order to survive.\n\nSEBASTIAN JUNGER:\n\nWell, the irony of modern society, for all of its very real benefits — I mean, modern society is a miracle in a lot of ways, right? But as affluence goes up in a society, the suicide rate tends to go up, not down.\n\nAs affluence goes up in a society, the depression rate goes up. When a crisis hits, then people's psychological health starts to improve. After 9/11 in New York City — I live in New York — and after 9/11, the suicide rate went down in New York, not up. It went down. It improved.\n\nViolent crime went down. Murder went down. There was a sense of everyone needs each other. And once you're called to serve your community, in some way, you sort of forget your own problems.\n\nSEBASTIAN JUNGER:\n\nIt's not enough.\n\nAnd, actually, I would say the Internet is doubly dangerous for all — and, again, for all of its miraculous capacity, not only does it not provide real community and real human connection. It gives you the illusion that it does, right?\n\nSo, oh, I have got lots of friends on Facebook, so I'm good. You're actually not good. And I'm not an expert in this, but from what I studied for my book \"Tribe,\" what you need is to feel people, smell them, hear them, feel them around you.\n\nI mean, that's the human connection that we evolved for, for hundreds of thousands of years. The Internet doesn't provide that.\n\nSEBASTIAN JUNGER:\n\nYes, it's a great question.\n\nI think what you're seeing in this political season are political camps deciding that they are their own tribe and it's us against them. And I think the trick — and this country is in a very, very tricky place socially, economically, politically — I think the trick, if you want to be a functioning country, a nation, a viable nation, you have to define tribe to include the entire country, even people you disagree with.\n\nDisagreement is great, debate is great, conflict is great. It's how we all get better.\n\nSEBASTIAN JUNGER:\n\nWhat you can't do is have contempt for your fellow citizens. That is destructive.\n\nNo soldier in a trench in a platoon in combat would have contempt for their trench mate. They might not like them. They disagree with them, but you don't have contempt for someone that your life depends on. And that's what we're falling into in the political dialogue in this country. And in my opinion, that is more dangerous to this country than ISIS is, I mean literally like more of a threat to our nation.\n\nSEBASTIAN JUNGER:\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nI mean, no one is saying this is going to be easy, but you do have — to understand the task, you have to understand your origins. You have to understand why humans are the way we are and what the cost of modern society has been.\n\nOnce you understand — and that's what my book tries to explain. Once you understand that, it's going to be much easier to devise, to jerry-rig a new solution to a new problem.\n\nSEBASTIAN JUNGER:\n\nI mean, sadly, I grew up in the — in the loneliest place in the world, an American suburb.\n\nLike, I wish I had a tribe. We don't. We just don't. That's the problem. That's why our depression rate, our suicide rate, all that stuff is through the roof. That's the tragedy of modern society.\n\nSEBASTIAN JUNGER:\n\nWell, I think if you try to — if you imagine your life in terms of the community you live in, and you try to connect personally to the people in your community, even though you drive 40 miles away to go to work, I think that's enormously beneficial and therapeutic."
