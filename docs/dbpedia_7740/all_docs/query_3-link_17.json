        "text": "The Joe Rogan Experience. Train by day, Joe Rogan Podcast by night, all day. Good to see you, man. How are you? Really good. Very good to see you, too. I see you're very prepared. Yeah, look at all those notes on those note cards. Yeah, serious stuff. We were talking before. There's so much to talk about, but we were talking before and you were\n\nsaying that, uh, over the last year you almost died because you had some crazy internal and, uh, you had an aneurysm in your pancreas. Is that what you said it was? Yeah. I had an undiagnosed asymptomatic aneurysm, which is a sort of ballooning in the blood vessel, in the artery, in my pancreatic artery. And out of the blue, it was a congenital thing. Like I apparently had developed during my whole life. It was just from a structural problem. And one afternoon, one beautiful June afternoon last year, it burst. And, you know, I just felt this pain shoot through last year at first. And, um, you know, I just felt this pain shoot through my stomach. I was like, damn, what is that?\n\nAnd within a few minutes I couldn't stand up. And within about 10 minutes I was started to go blind and my wife called the ambulance and, um, those guys got there and, and, um, you know, I was tanking really fast and the hospital is an hour away. And I said, by a miracle, I don't even think the doctors understand it, but by a miracle, I was still alive when I got to the hospital, I lost 90% of my blood into my abdomen. Um, and, um, I didn't know I was dying, but I was dying and I was right in that sort of twilight zone. And, um, the, uh, a black pit opened up underneath me and I felt myself starting to get pulled down into it. And I, I didn't want to go like it was cold and dark and black and bottomless. And I just knew like, do not go down there. I was getting pulled down into it. And right at that moment,\n\ndown into it. And right at that moment, my father, who passed away in 2012, my father sort of appeared next to me and started trying to communicate, trying to communicate with me and comforting me. And I sort of waved him away. And the last thing I remember saying to the doctor, I was sort of losing consciousness. And the last thing I said to the doctor was, you're losing me right now. You got to hurry. He was trying to put a, he'd cut my neck open. He was trying to put a line into my neck to, you know, they pumped 10, 10 units of blood into me. And that's what brought me back.\n\nIt was really close. Wow. Um, when you say you, you felt like you were sinking into a pit, like, do we seeing this? I, I, yeah, I mean? I mean, your perceptions are very weird because there's very little oxygen in the brain. I had a hemoglobin count of 1.2. If you're a doctor, you know what that is. It's almost unheard of.\n\nAnd so I just felt this pit underneath me and it was pulling me into it and I didn't want to go. And you can see a pit? Yeah, I mean, again, see slash feel. Your perceptions are very weird when you're like that. And then my father a pit? Yeah. I mean, again, see slash feel. Your perceptions are very weird when you're like that. And then my father also was sort of floating above me. He was a presence. I don't know if seeing him is quite the word. It's another perception. Wow. Yeah. So coming out of that, once you regained your health, you must have had an incredible newfound appreciation for all\n\nthe people in your life and just everything. It was a long path. You know, I mean, I'm a really healthy guy. Later, the doctor said, you know, it was your, you know, I was a marathon runner when I was young and, um, I don't drink. I'm, I'm athletic and I use my body pretty vigorously. And he said that saved your life. Like you didn't have a heart attack. Like you owe your life to that. Wow, wow. But the next morning, you know, I didn't know that I'd almost died. I had no idea.\n\nI have two little girls. I have a four-year-old and a one-and-a-half-year-old. And the most precious things to me, I mean, I can't even describe it, obviously. And the fact that they almost lost their dad was just devastating. When the ICU nurse came in and said, how are you doing, Mr. Junger? You're one lucky guy. You almost died yesterday. I had no idea.\n\nAnd then she came back an hour later. And she said, how are you doing? And I said, you know, physically, and I was throwing up blood. I was not doing very well physically, but I said I was. I said, but, you know, I'm really struggling with what you told me. And it's really terrifying. I didn't know. And, I mean, I said I almost died in my own driveway in front of my family.\n\nAnd I didn't even know. Like, I said, I keep thinking about it. I can't stop. And she said, the wisest things, one of the wisest things I've ever heard. She said, stop thinking of that moment as scary and start thinking of it as sacred. And she didn't elaborate. She didn't need to. And the next five days in the ICU, I thought about that word sacred and what the experience was now giving me access to. And, you know, not to sound sort of like trite, but life is a frigging miracle.\n\nAnd I'm not religious. You know, whatever. I don't think any of us, few of us, I certainly didn't quite understand what a miracle it is that we're alive, that we exist, that we draw breath, that we can think about ourselves, that we're here for even one day is a freaking miracle. And you can forget that because your life gets busy. And all of a sudden, I feel like life was sort of returned to me, meaning that I understood how sacred it is. And again, I'm an atheist. I don't mean sacred in a religious sense. I mean, in the sense that it has a profound value and you mustn't forget.\n\nIt's so easy to lose sight of that when you're caught up in your bills or traffic or your bullshit. Yeah. There's so much of life that is essential in order for you to just keep on existing in society, but not really important. Yeah. And, you know, we're humans. I mean, we're wired to react to things. You know, someone pisses you off or you're tired. It's not that we shouldn't have those reactions. Those reactions also keep us alive. I mean, our emotional and physical reactions are adaptive and they protect us, right? But at the end of the day, you don't want them to run away with your experience of life. You want to reclaim it and just go right, you know, all I have to do is go back to that moment of what happened in that driveway and that I was spared\n\ngetting pulled into that pit. That didn't happen. And my daughters get to have a father. I get to experience whatever the rest of my life is, whatever it is. Who knows how long I'll live, but that gift was returned to me. And I don't even know who to say thank you to other than I've started giving blood. 10 people donated blood and saved my life. I'll never know who they are. And that, um, you know, it makes you part of this sort of web of life, um, in a way that it's, you know, when I gave blood for the first time, you know, like after this happened, I gave blood and I've made me feel so good. Uh, and now I've, I can't wait to do it again. Like you're, I'm part of something bigger. And, and, and that's one of the most profound human joys is to be part of something greater than\n\nyourself. That is a beautiful thing and a beautiful way to think about it and i think i'm fine if this is true maybe someone told me this is giving blood actually good for you i think your body having the opportunity to replenish its blood supply actually stimulates some aspects of your system? Yeah, I can. I mean, I'm not a doctor, but I can imagine. You're not a doctor? I don't know if this is even true, though. I mean, it's one of those things where I'm like,\n\nit's in a dusty corner of my brain. I'm like, what is that? Is that real or is that horse shit? There's a lot of those things in my brain, by the way. Here it goes. Benefits of donating blood, side effects, advantages, and more. Side effects of donating blood, donation. This part here.\n\nOkay. Health benefits of donating blood, including good health and reduced risk of cancer, hemochromatosis. It helps in reducing the risk of damage to the liver and the pancreas. Donating blood may help in improving cardiovascular health and reducing obesity. So yeah. Okay, good.\n\nI'm always worried about my fucking memory. So there you go. I knew there was something there. Yeah, yeah. That's good news. It's actually good for people for you to donate blood and good for you as well. All right, let's donate blood, Jamie.\n\nAnd lower blood pressure. What do you got for what what kind of blood would type? Great question. You don't know he's how do you not know you're fucking grown-ass man now Sebastian and I know I Just found out a year ago Yeah, that's awesome though So this this experience, how long did it take you before you were fully recovered? Well, I had a gallon of blood in my abdomen. A gallon?\n\nWell, whatever the amount of blood in your body is. How do they get it out? Something like that. They can't. It's a hematoma and my body had to gradually reabsorb it. Whoa. So that takes months. had to gradually reabsorb it. So, you know, that takes months. And now I'm left with this sort of psychological residue of the experience, which is I have this, you know, renewed, reinvigorated\n\nappreciation for life. But also the truth about life is that none of us know for sure we're going to be alive at sunset. You know, I mean, we all know you can get cancer or you can die in a car accident or whatever. But really the truth is the thing, we're alive because the tiniest membranes in your body are not rupturing. You know what I mean? Like the system that your body is, is like incredibly complex. And if something goes wrong, you can be dead in minutes. And you can be totally healthy and that can happen. And the fact that the universe can just randomly take you out for no apparent reason, that's pretty startling news if you think about it.\n\nI didn't know it worked that way. And it can make you kind of paranoid. Did it make you paranoid? No, totally. Yeah? I mean, I just – every day I was like, I mean, this is gradually going away, but I just, I realized, like, you don't know.\n\nYou just don't know that you're going to be alive in an hour from now. And you're going running, you're reading a book to your daughter, you're whatever, having dinner with some friends, and now, I was like, an hour from now, I could be dead, or the guy I'm talking to could be dead, and none of us know, and none of us can do anything about it.\n\nAnd that's just what life is. We're living on a rock hurtling through the universe. I mean we're part of the universe and we exist at its mercy really. Were you afterwards contemplating what that pit was and what it means and what it means to slide into that? You know, I started to do a little research into the death. I want to write a book about this. I think I'm going to call it Pulse. Oh, I like that. The thing that keeps us alive. It's a good name. And why we're alive and what happens when you die. And I've just started doing some research into this. And the visitation by dead ancestors is very common for people.\n\nAnd often, I mean, there's all kinds of reasons that you might hallucinate when your brain's low on oxygen. But, you know, I didn't hallucinate anyone in my family. I didn't hallucinate my dead father. Right. And that's very, very common. And I didn't know I was dying. So it's not like I conjured him up because I knew I was headed somewhere. I was very confused. And there he was trying to comfort me. And that's a really common experience. So I looked into it. And so they have all these, you know, release of ketamine and all\n\nlike they have all these DMT and they have all these sort of neurochemical explanations for the subjective experience of dying for the person. And we have all these sort of neurochemical explanations for the subjective experience of dying for the person. And we only know this because people come back like I do and report what they saw. And it's usually pretty weird. But it's pretty weird in predictable ways. Like a lot of people see the dead. It's as if they show up to help. And I want to repeat, I'm an atheist. I'm not religious. I don't believe in anything. My dad was a physicist. So I want to sort of explain what happens in ways that he would respect scientifically. And so one of the things they said is that you can take low oxygen, ketamine, all these things that physically could happen in the brain.\n\nYou can subject a healthy person to those things and they don't have the same kinds of hallucinations. Those hallucinations are particular only to the dying. And I want to know, I want to try to figure out what is going on in that weird twilight space. You should, um, you should see if someone will do a therapeutic DMT trip with you. I've heard about that. Yeah. Yeah. They'll do it.\n\nYou know, they were doing it out of University of New Mexico. Rick Strassman was doing it, and he had full federal approval for these studies and there was a book called DMT the spirit molecule that he wrote about the the experience of taking these people and doing an IV drip dimethyltryptamine but they all had these insanely profound experiences that stayed with them for you know depending on the person but for long periods of time afterwards and profoundly changed their lives well an endogenous form of DMT is released in the brain of dying people. Maybe he wrote about that. But he, they speculated on it.\n\nSo what the problem was for the longest time is the pineal gland. And the pineal gland is what, you know, ancients used to call the seed of the soul. And it's this small gland that they think in in reptiles it actually has a retina and a cornea and i think even a lens it literally is a third eye yeah google that i think the pineal gland in reptiles has it definitely has a retina, I believe, and I think it has a lens. But it's like the third eye, the concept of the third eye, it actually is an eye in some strange way. And it also, just recently they confirmed, here it goes. The pineal complex of reptiles is a morphologically and functionally connected set of organs.\n\nand functionally connected set of organs and originates in an evagination? Evagination? Evagination? Hmm. Of the roof of the, oh boy. It's formed by two structures, the pineal organ and the parietal eye. Parietal?\n\nParietal? Parietal eye? Parietal. Parietal? Yeah. Both the pineal gland and the parietal eye are photosensitive yeah it it actually go there which reptile has a third eye like that um so there literally are well anyway point is this is always been thought of as the third eye if you look at you know eastern\n\nmysticism and whenever people are enlightened or depicted they're depicted with that third eye and this organ the Cottonwood Research Foundation was the first group that they actually discovered that for sure the pineal gland does produce DMT in living rats because before they knew that it was produced by the liver and the lungs, and there was a lot of anecdotal evidence that pointed to the pineal gland, but they couldn't prove it because you'd have to actually cut into someone's head. There was a lot of problems just based on the structure of the brain and getting in there.\n\nBut through this Cottonwood Research Foundation, which was working on different DMT studies. So they don't know why and they don't know what it is, but they think that this is also responsible for dreams. They think it's responsible for some of the insane visuals and weird things you experience in dreams, but they also, the really spiritual, the people that are willing to go way out on a limb, think it's a chemical doorway to the afterlife.\n\nWell, let me tell you, I mean, that's a pretty stunning thought. And we all, I mean, I'm not a mystic, but also we all need to be humble about what we know and don't know. And we have no idea what there is after death. And I mean, we might not even be able to be capable of understanding it with the brains that we have, you know. So maybe that's why we keep bumping into the unknowable because it's just unknowable to us. At any rate, let me tell you that two nights before I almost died, I had a pain in my abdomen for a year that I ignored. How bad was the pain? You know, it was – I could tolerate it, which to me meant, okay, well,\n\nif you can bear it, then it's not going to kill you. You know what I mean? And the other, the corollary to that is if you can't bear it, you should learn to bear it because you know what I mean? Like, so toughness will kill you. If it doesn't save you, it will kill you. And, um, so it just sort of came and went right in the area where the bleed happened. And I ignored it and ignored it. And then it kind of stopped happening for a month or so. And I had a dream right around dawn. And my family and I, we all sleep in the same, it's not even a bed. It's a, you know, like pad on the floor. And so I woke up, I was woken up around 6 a.m. by this dream. And the dream was that I died. And I died unnecessarily. I died. I made a? And I can't go back because I've crossed over and I'm, I'm just thinking, you stupid asshole, you, you screwed up and now you're dead and there's nothing you can do about it. And I woke up with a start.\n\nOh, thank God I'm not dead. I'm alive. And here's my, my daughter was right next to me. I put my arm around her. I was like, oh, thank God. About 36 hours later, I was dying. Wow. Yeah. Do you think that that was your body trying to tell you, hey, man, this shit's about to blow? Listen, I mean, for a year,\n\nmy body tried to tell me with pain that something was wrong and I ignored it. And then 36 hours left to go, it sent me a dream. And on the morning of the, um, on the morning of the day that it happened, you know, I, I, we live in a, I live partly in, we live partly in New York city and partly in a really remote area at the end of a long dead end dirt road in the woods. And it gets overgrown, right? And the fire department said, listen, you got to clear that because we can't get trucks in there. You're going to have to clear that dirt road.\n\nYou know, it's a small town. Everyone knows each other. It's like, listen, clear that stuff. And that morning, you know, I'd been meaning to do this for two years, right? I was an arborist for a long time. I know I've used chainsaws my whole life. Like I do all that work myself.\n\nAnd I'd been meaning to do it for two years. And that morning I was like, I've got to clear that damn driveway. And I took I'd been meaning to do it for two years. And that morning I was like, I've got to clear that damn driveway. And I took my chainsaw and I took a few hours and I cleared the whole length. There's a long dirt driveway through the woods. I cleared the whole thing. So emergency vehicles could get in. And a few hours, like three hours later I was dying. So imagine if you didn't do that. Well, exactly. Right. And so the thing is like the body, I think can communicate with the unconscious mind. And then the unconscious mind tries to communicate with the conscious mind.\n\nBut your conscious mind's a freaking idiot. Right. And it doesn't take little hints. It doesn't take clues. Bomb it with pain. It ignores it. Bomb it with dreams. It's like, wow, that was weird.\n\nBut at the end of the day, your body's trying to keep you alive, and it sent me out there with a chainsaw. And I don't, you know, I'm actively avoidant of mystical explanations for things, but I honestly don't know how to explain any of this. And I'm going to try to with my book Pulse. Like my whole life as a journalist, I've gone to front lines in wars in foreign countries and come back and reported what I saw there. Right. And this is the ultimate front line. It's that twilight place between life and death. And I was privileged that I could go there and come back. I made it back.\n\nAnd I want to report what I saw. Wow. I want to read it. It's a, it's the thing that we all wonder, what is this? Is this a pit stop or is this the life, you know, is the life a never ending infinite experience that goes on forever in many forms or is it just this, or is this a thing that you do over and over and over again until you get it right? I had that conversation with a friend of mine once and they were really, really bummed out about it. And I said, if this is life, if the life that we all live like right now, just you have to do this over and over again for infinity until you get it right. They're like, oh, fuck that.\n\nI don't want to keep doing this. I'm like, but wait a minute, don't you wanna do this right now? Because I wanna do this right now. I love life, I have great friends, I love my family, I love what I do for a living, I'm enjoying life. Why wouldn't I wanna keep doing this? Because if you told me I was gonna die tomorrow,\n\nI'd be like, shit, not yet, I have too much to do. But if you told me I have to do this forever, I'd be like, oh my God my god that's forever that's so long why why what is what is this is it the concept of infinity or infinite time is so enormous it's impossible for our puny little brains to grasp so we just we think of it as like a run that you can never end or an exercise program that's just going to drag you into the depths of hell. You're never going to get out of it. What is it that bothers us about the idea of living this life forever and ever?\n\nThat's a good question. I mean, for a lot of people, life is painful, and it may just be that they don't want to go through that their whole life. Yeah, but my friend doesn't have a painful life. Yeah, okay. Well, right. He's fine. He's a comedian. He's fine. I hear that comedians are in the most pain and they deal with it through comedy. Don't believe that.\n\nNo. Okay. No. There's a lot of mental illness. Right. Strong mental illness lines. That's probably the underlying... If there's one primary factor, mental illness is a big one.\n\nIt's usually from traumatic childhood. Yeah, right. Yeah, but overall, you know, fairly resilient because of the fact they have to deal with adversity constantly. Most people don't deal with the kind of adversity\n\nthat you deal with when you're bombing or you go on stage and you're dealing with hecklers and stuff. You're dealing with, it's a different level of adversity. And the adage of the tears of a clown, they're really depressed and on stage is the only place they get to be. Not really true either.\n\nYou get us together when we're around our people, pretty fun. I bet. We have a good time. I bet. That's awesome to hear. I'm glad to hear that. There's a tremendous amount of camaraderie in the comedy community. Right, right.\n\nBecause it's not that many of us. There's maybe on earth, I don't know, 1,000. I mean, I don't know. Maybe in other countries. I miss it. But I can tell you in America. In America, there might be legitimately 1,000 professional comedians. Out of those 1,000, maybe 500 of them are good.\n\nSo I might even be overestimating there. Like in terms of like who can make a living on the road. And it's not that many of us. I just watched on YouTube the beginning of Good Morning Vietnam. Oh, yeah. It's just sheer genius. I know he was in a lot of pain. He suffered, right?\n\nWell he had some serious physical problems. He had Lewy body syndrome, he had a heart attack. And then a friend of mine who's a doctor actually wrote a paper about the effects of long-term anesthesia. When someone's put under for a long period of time for like a heart attack, things like that, oftentimes depression follows. Yes. Yeah. And he was talking about that in terms of the impact on your endocrine system.\n\nSo he was writing about that and he was saying that there could have been, he was a Robin Williams fan as well, and he was saying there probably could have been a correlation between Robin Williams going through that heart attack, having open-heart surgery, and then depression following afterwards. Then there was the Lewy body syndrome,\n\nand then all this medication they had to take, which also had profound side effects. I lost a very dear friend who was the funniest man that I knew and pretty much, I think, the funniest person on the planet. You know, he just wasn't a professional comedian. But, you know, he had a long, long illness and some serious mental instability, and he took his own life. And, you know, he was the most brilliant among us.\n\nYou know what I mean? And so you guys, you comedians, there must be every once in a while like a real tragedy to process. That must be very hard. Yeah, I mean, it's not that common that comedians take their own lives. I mean, it does happen with Robin.\n\nRobin was a big one for a lot of people because he was not just a comedian. He was like a cultural icon in terms of like his films, you think all the different movies that guy was in. And he had such just a comedian. He was like a cultural icon in terms of his films, all the different movies that guy was in. He had such a range, too. To me, when you know how brilliant a person really is, do you remember that film that he did about the crazy film processing guy?\n\nIt was like a 24-hour film. You remember those little film booths, photo booths that people would go to? Back in the old days, you you youngsters we would have a camera and the camera would have film in it and you'd have to bring the film to a place for processing and robin williams did a film about a guy who was a psychopath who was obsessed with someone from processing their picture one hour photo that's what it was nice it was fucking great and you just from that film you realize the range this man had right right you know i mean from goodwill hunting from you know so many different yeah he was he was a genius yeah yeah and the human race\n\nis so lucky to have geniuses in it you know what i mean like we all feed off them yeah we do we get we they elevate us and it costs them sometimes but we all need we need those people you know yeah to be a guy like that to be is dealing with the kind of rpms he was dealing with yeah you know like it he would spit out these amazing works but you know just the cost on himself. You know, in Good Morning Vietnam, in the initial, you know, few minutes, like, it's pretty clear that it wasn't scripted because, you know, there's this, like, kid in the control booth. I mean, the conceit is that it's a military DJ, a radio announcer during Vietnam, right? And the military command didn't really like him because he was saying things that\n\nwere sort of like not sufficiently sort of respectful of the war or whatever. But of course, the troops loved him. He was a real guy, right? And so Robin Williams, it was pretty clear if you watch the beginning, it's worth watching. It wasn't scripted because the kid in the sound booth behind him, you could watch him react to this like three minute, like the outpouring from Robin Williams, where he's like channeling different people and it's all coming out. It's totally insane. And this kid can't even stand up. He's laughing so hard. I'm like, that's not acting. That's a guy who actually had no idea this was coming. Right, right, right. It's amazing. Yeah.\n\nI met him only once, and I met him after one of my shows. I didn't know I was talking to him until a couple minutes into the conversation. He had a crazy big white beard, and he waited in line with everybody else to meet me. Wow. And I was talking to him, and he was telling me, I was telling him, oh, I love this bit, I love that, and I love how you put that together. I was like, oh, thanks, man. Thanks. I love that and I love how you put that together. I was like, oh thanks man, thanks for pre.\n\nI'm like, holy shit, this is Robin Williams. I didn't know, I literally had no idea until like several minutes into our conversation. He must have loved that. That was pretty cool, man. Yeah, very cool. It was cool that, you know, first of all it was cool that he just went to the show by himself right you know\n\nhe decided he wanted to come see me maybe somebody told him i was funny and he came to and then he waited in line to meet me and then wanted to talk about individual bits and how he loved how i put this one together and that one it was crazy it was like i realized in the middle and i'm like oh my god that's awesome it was it was pretty, but that just shows you what kind of thoughtful person he was You know, he wasn't into being seen In fact, he had a baseball hat on and glasses and the crazy big white bushy beard couldn't even recognize him He snuck around. I mean, I think I think prominent people Have even more of a duty to be humble than people that aren't prominent. I mean the burden is more on them. Yeah, for sure. Right. It's a part of the responsibility of this unusual position.\n\nSo it is, you, you need to be in that sense. You need to be an example. Yeah. If you can. Absolutely. Absolutely. Do your best. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. I think just for his mental health, I think it was probably important to, I. I mean, the amount of fame that that guy experienced for the amount of decades that he had experienced. That's a it's a crazy intoxicant. It's not healthy. You know. Right. Right.\n\nYeah. I mean, there's something I write about a little bit in Freedom. I mean, I will be talking about that later. But just to sort of mention it, like real leadership, real leadership is someone who is willing to sort of put themselves last, you know. And you can see it in the military. Like I was watching this one officer, Lieutenant Piosa, and we were in a very bad situation. And he stood up in this situation. It was hard to imagine doing that. And he stood up because he needed to know where everyone was on the side of the mountain and we were about to get absolutely hammered and um\n\nand the sergeant said sir please sit down you it's our job to get shot at it's your job to stay alive and direct this show right and that's real leadership um there was a leader during the Easter Rising in Ireland that I write about and the head of the whole Easter Rising in Dublin, the head of the whole thing. I mean, the general Petraeus of the Irish rebels would go out into gunfire in the street to figure out where to put the positions and the guns and the sandbags and everything with bullets smacking all around him. He was head of the whole damn thing. And his like aides were like, sir, please take cover. We need you. And he wouldn't do it. That's real leadership. And that can be a military leader. It can be a comedian who's beloved by people. Like if you make yourself one of everyone else, then you're really, really a leader. Make yourself one of everyone else.\n\nyou're really, really a leader. Make yourself one of everyone else. Like when you use your position of power to protect yourself, to insulate yourself from things that everyone else is going through, you're actually not a leader. You're an opportunist. That's interesting. So how would you guide one to do that? How would you guide one to be a leader in that situation? You know, I think there are people that have that in them and people that don't. And I think there are people who want leadership positions because it gives them opportunity. I think there are people that are cowards that wind up in leadership positions, you know, and they're not going to do that. They're going to protect themselves. And that, you know, in Western society, we have huge margins between where we are and survival, right? Huge margins.\n\nSo we can have bad leadership that's sort of like opportunistic and self-serving, and it doesn't matter. We're going to muddle along okay. But the Easter Rising couldn't afford to do that. And when someone like Robin Williams comes along and does not privilege himself in a comedy club and just is like everyone else. I'm like, I really tip my hat to that. Like that's real grace and dignity. Yeah, I do as well. And this way you're describing leadership, like I think this is what everybody wishes we could recognize in our political leaders. Like we wish there was a shining example. And I think if there was one in the past election, it was Tulsi Gabbard,\n\nbecause you're talking about a woman who had served overseas twice in medical units, had literally worked with people, had been shot and blown up, and had served as a congresswoman for six years, or I guess eight years at the end. So she really was an example of that. But other than that, you saw just a lot of more of the same.\n\nAnd it was really frustrating for people. So they had to pick a horse and they had to pick a horse that they weren't exactly excited about. And that's what led us to what we have in the White House currently. It's not, it's like this fake excitement about this supposed leader that doesn't really exhibit any of these characteristics that we would be hoping to see in someone who's running the show. Well, you know, I think the, the, the willingness to tell the truth as a political leader, even if it puts you in disfavor with your own party is a, um, a strong indicator of, of moral courage. And, you know,\n\nboth parties, I think, have a deficit of that. And, you know, I mean, I'm a registered Democrat, you know, I've, whatever, not that it really matters, but just to be like in the open about it. But I think, you know, that, you know, Liz Cheney, I mean, she's possibly destroyed her political future i don't know and i i don't know what the truth about anything is but the fact that she's willing to go against the sort of republican orthodoxy to me means that she's putting what she believes to be the truth ahead of her own political um uh future i'm not totally aware of what's going on. Can you explain that? Oh, she, oh yeah. So she's been calling out, um, the, um, the January 6th uprising and calling out the sort of big lie, the election was stolen. Right. And you know, the entire Republican leadership has, has acknowledged\n\nthat it was a free and fair election. And then there's been a lot of sort of hemming and hawing and Liz Cheney is like, look, the democracy is more important than either political party. The country is more important than either political party. And the country will collapse if we keep feeding lies to it. And this is a really dangerous lie. And so she's like, I mean, I don't know where you are politically. It doesn't matter to me. None of this matters really other than to point out that she was saying something that she was gravely punished for.\n\nAnd she did it knowing she would be punished for it. And she did it anyway because she really believed in something. And, you know, there's examples on the left as well of that. And that to me is like that's leadership. It's putting what you believe to be the welfare of the group ahead of your own personal interests. And that is what I would look for in a leader. Yeah. And that's what it's, I just think by the time someone gets to the position that they're going to run for president, you've already been compromised. You've already gotten\n\nthrough all of the checks and balances that they've laid in place to make sure that you represent the interests of the special interest groups and all the powerful lobbyists and corporations and everybody who's gotten you to the position you're at. Well, right. I mean, the GOP yanked Liz from her position, from her role, right? So she does not have the establishment behind her. And without that, you're never going to be president. I don't know if she wants to be, but- Is it because they want to keep that narrative out there that the election was stolen? Or is it because they don't want to take credit or take responsibility for the Capitol Hill riot?\n\nI think it's a mix of things. I mean, honestly, they're in a really tough place. And I think it's a tough place of their own devising. But they're in a tough place. Something like 70% of Republican voters think the election was stolen. Is that real? Yeah.\n\n70%? Seven-zero, right. So what are you gonna do Is that real? Yeah. 70%. 7-0. Right. So what are you going to do with that politically? And then someone like Liz Cheney comes along and sort of calls out the lie. And that's a very tough position for the GOP to be in. And I think in the short term, it was probably a disreputable but smart move politically. In the long term, I don't think it's a good move. I think at the end of the day, truth wins out and it will catch up with them,\n\nyou know, as if things have caught up with their Democrats as well. When they say that 70% think that, is this just based on a narrative or is it based on something they believe in in terms of like they think there's an actual, like event that took place or series of events\n\nthat took place that stole the election or is it just a narrative that gets out there like the lib stole the election you know that kind of shit i mean i don't know if poll takers can make distinguish that i mean i don't know how you would phrase the question to sort of split that like what makes you i would like just to add that answer or even multiple choice what makes you think the election was stolen? Right. I mean, I think a lot of it is just sort of what's called virtue signaling. Like, I will say the election is stolen because that means I am part of the current sort of conservative ethos. Yeah.\n\nI'm part of the tribe, right? And so they might not even personally themselves think it was literally stolen, but that kind of mythic truth can be more powerful politically than the literal truth. And people go with it. We're humans. We're emotional creatures. So- Yeah, we love being tribal like that too. Right. So I think there's a lot of tribalism there, but nevertheless, people are saying the election was stolen. 70% of the GOP is saying it was stolen. So that's a tough demographic to go up against if you're a Republican politician who wants to get elected. Like, what are you going to do with that? You're going to kind of have to go along with it. Well, conceivably, what you would say is we have to try to steal it next time.\n\nThat's where it gets really scary. you believe, if you really believe that the other side is cheating and you say, well, we have to cheat because we have to win this back because we were the rightful winners of the 2020 election and they stole it from us. Right. It could get real squirrely. Oh, totally. And then you get, I mean, as I said, I'm a Democrat, but I'm particularly harsh with wrongdoing by my people, particularly harsh with wrongdoing by my people, right? And some of the, you know, sort of far lefty fringe woke stuff is really scary to me, you know, like, and I feel like they're a direct equivalent of the crazies on the far right. Like they kind of, they're sort of the mirror image of each other. And, oh, you might like this actually. I thought, I was like, there's MAGA, we know the word MAGA.\n\nThere should be a word for the sort of the mirror image of that on the left. Like, what is it? And I came up with WAGA. Woke America gets angry. Right. And the thing about them is, I mean, there was much smaller percentage of the Democratic vote. But it's the same kind of channeled thinking. of the Democratic vote, but it's the same kind of channeled thinking. Like on both sides,\n\nthe extremes feel like they personally own the truth and that they can dictate what this country should be. Right. And they sort of poison the like well of public discourse by rejecting any legitimacy to the other side. Yes. You know? And that public discourse is the only thing at the end of the day that's going to keep this country together and save us. And it's like we all get most, the vast majority of people that voted for Trump or voted for Biden are good, righteous, decent people. We need clean water to drink in our our public discourse, like we get thirsty, we need\n\nto drink out of that well, and the extremes on both sides have poisoned it. And I feel like if we were all in a big life raft and someone poisoned the water, we would throw them overboard. And at some point, this country is going to have to do that with the, politically speaking, with the extremists on both sides, because they're basically rejecting the idea that we can all get along. I couldn't agree more. And I think it highlights some of the problems with communicating in text form over the internet and social media websites because a lot of what these people have, whether it's the QAnon people or the woke people, you have extremely low status people who want to impart some control on other people. They want to get other people to listen to them.\n\nThey want to get other people to comply with whatever rules they're setting forward. They want to enact change. They want to grab power. Again, whether it's the people that storm the Capitol Hill or the wokesters, it's the same kind of mentality, it's just they've adopted different ideologies. But it's almost all low status people who have sought new meaning and virtue out of this form of control, attacking the left or attacking the right or attacking what they perceive to be outside of the boundaries of the right or attacking what they perceive to be outside\n\nof the boundaries of the accepted ideology that they'd like to enforce on everyone else. Totally. And you can tell it's not a good faith effort because they will... No good faith actor will tell you how you have to think. Exactly. actor will tell you how you have to think. Exactly. Right. They'll, you know, they will, they will make, give you their best pitch. They'll hope that you come to their, to their way of thinking. But when you're told, and this is one of the things I don't like about religion, when you're told, I mean, organized, established religion, when you're told you have to think like this, and if you don't think like this, you are Satan's spawn, or you are an\n\nenemy of the country, or you're a racist, or you're this or that. When you're told how to think and speak, or you're unworthy of being part of this community, that's how you know that that person does not mean the country well. Yeah, I think you just nailed it. I think that's exactly what's missing in both sides, the far left and the far right. And a big part of that is one of the core tenets of being a human being, which is compassion, compassion and empathy. Both of those sides with the far right people want death to the far left and the far left people want the far right to be ostracized. It's the same thing. It's like there's a complete lack of empathy and a complete unwillingness to accept that the other side are just human beings with differing opinions. And maybe there's some common ground.\n\nWe all have common ground, especially people with children, right? Your common ground is you want the world to be a safer place for these delicate little creatures that you love more than anything in life itself. Yeah, that's right. And I, you know, my fear is that, I mean, I feel like right now the sort of radical voice is now, is now speaking for a large proportion of the GOP politically. I mean, that 70% figure is like pretty, it's pretty alarming, right? My fear is that that will happen on the left. I mean, whatever you think about Joe Biden, he's not like that kind of liberal radical. But that way of thinking, that woke way of thinking, God forbid, that completely take over the Democrats.\n\nHe's complying with it, though. I don't think he thinks that way, but I think he thinks it's a good political strategy to get the really aggressive radicals on the left to go along with him. The perceived progressive, like the extreme end of it, like the tribe, like AOC and those type of people that really want a much more progressive,\n\nmuch more socialized medicine. It's a different strategy in terms of control of the left. Right. And he's complying with that, I think, to try to get a little bit of their base. Well, I mean, listen, I mean, every politician has to somehow collect as much of the caucus as possible under one tent. And so if you completely ignore that voice, of course, you're creating a splinter group that could be really dangerous to the party and the country. So I think he, you know, more, you know, he's, to me, he's a pretty\n\ncentrist Democrat. Well, one of the first things he did in office, he's a pretty centrist Democrat. Well, one of the first things he did in office though was make it so that biological girls had to compete against trans girls in sports. Right. I was so horrified by that. I actually thought that's – I mean I'm a former athlete, right? And I just – like the role of hormones. I mean you know more about this than me, but the role of hormones in athletics of testosterone is so dominant.\n\nAnd I mean, that's why at 59, I'm not the runner I was at 20. I used to have lower testosterone, right? And what that could do to girls' sports, to me, seems like really, really puzzling. Like, are you sure you want to do that? It's just ideologically driven. It's not not driven by science it's not driven by logic it's certainly not driven by compassion for biological women it's it's driven by what you would call the oppression spectrum right like who's at the highest end of the oppression spectrum trans people maybe interracial trans people would like,\n\nmaybe black trans people would trump that. What is the top perceived most oppressed? Everyone else has to sort of capitulate. Everyone else has to sort of figure out a way to comply with whatever rules are going to benefit them. Biological women are clearly not going to benefit from trans girls competing in girls' sports. They're just not. It's not good for them. Biological women are clearly not going to benefit from trans girls competing in girls' sports. They're just not. It's not good for them. And if you think it is good for them, then\n\nI get how you would want it to be inclusive and you would want everyone to just feel fully accepted. But we have to look at sports as a different thing. There's a reason why boys don't compete against girls. Right, right. You know, one thing that helps for me when I think about any kind of conflict or disagreement is to start out assuming that the other person or the other group that appears to be proposing something outrageous. Just start with the assumption they're trying to achieve something good and they're doing it through means that you don't think will work. And I do that with the right wing. I mean I can look at a bunch of policies that came in under Trump and think, oh, my God, that just seems cruel or that seems this or that. The border stuff. I mean there's so many things.\n\nThe world is complicated, right? And the solutions are complicated and messy and imperfect. But I really tried to think, okay, so are they just evil or are they trying to achieve a good thing by means that I don't quite understand or agree with? And I would say that about the gender issues. Some of it makes no sense to me. I mean, look, I'm an older white guy. I'm in a really lucky place in the world, you know? And I mean, people will tell me that, right? So I'm not even really going to judge, but what I would say is what are they trying to achieve that's good that we can maybe achieve without other girls paying a price in athletics? And\n\nmaybe it's not possible. I don't think it's possible right now because I think right now we have to wait until the water hits the wall before it pushes back. Right. Because right now the water is about to hit the wall in the Olympics because they are allowing this woman who was a elite male power lifter who transitioned over to female\n\nand now is going to compete in the Olympics. I think for New Zealand, I think that's the Australia or New Zealand, I forget which, but everyone's kind of freaking out about this because this person is just going to dominate. Especially in things like powerlifting, where there's so many advantages to being male. You know, I looked at that in my book, Freedom. So one of the things that I say in my book is that, you know, there's like three ways of maintaining your freedom, your autonomy in the face of a greater power. And one of them is literally running, like staying so\n\nmobile that the heavier, like the heavier entity, the bigger guy, the bigger the empire just cannot like find you. And that was the apache did in the southwest so at any rate i looked at the difference between male and female world records in running events compared to weight events and the difference if i'm remembering correctly the difference in running was about 11 in other words women were much closer to me that the top man the top female runners were much closer to the top male runners the top female runners were much closer to the top male runners than in the weight events that the split was like 30% or 50%. And so what I sort of hypothesized in my book is that it was more adaptive to have women be able to keep up with the men while they were\n\ntrying to avoid a threat than to be of equal strength to the men to share in the fight if they couldn't outrun it, that there was more adaptive to be mobile than to be big and strong. And it's a really interesting difference. And the other interesting thing about that is that as you increase body size, if you double body weight, you don't double strength, If you double body weight, you don't double strength, right? So if you go from 150 pounds to 300 pounds, the amount you bench press doesn't double, which is really interesting. But dependent upon what? See, because you could double your bench press if you don't lift weights.\n\nIt's like if you don't lift weights and you weigh 150 pounds and you bench 150, you could get up to 300 pounds in a few years. Oh, of course. But if you look at the world records for those weights, right? I see what you're saying. If you look at the world records, a 150 pound man can bench about two thirds of the weight of a 300 pound man. So the 300 pound man is stronger for sure. He's definitely stronger, But he has doubled his body weight, which means that he's a lot less mobile. And he burns through a lot more oxygen in a fight or in anything. So there's this interesting negative payoff for being stronger, which is that you burn through less oxygen. So if you don't win a fight in the first minutes, right, you're now struggling in terms of oxygen debt compared to the guy who weighs less than you. And there's a sort of sweet spot where you're smaller and have an oxygen saving but you're not completely dominated physically.\n\nThere's a sort of sweet spot where being a little bit smaller is actually a sort of tactical advantage in a fight. And so I looked at all that, and it made total sense because humans are pretty much the only mammal where a smaller combatant can defeat a larger one. You know, in chimpanzees, the smaller chimpanzee loses to the alpha male, right? Humans, that's not true. The smaller individual can win and wins about 50% of the time. I called ESPN and they're amazing. They gave me a statistician who looked at all this stuff, right? And he said, yeah, the larger, that size is not a predictor of weight.\n\nYeah, but in what sport? Boxing? No, MMA. In MMA? Yeah. Really? That's what he said. That doesn't make sense because there's weight classes. And on top of that, in the heavyweight division, the scariest guy is the biggest guy. The scariest guy is Francis\n\nNgannou. He has to cut weight to make the 265-pound weight limit. Right. I mean, there are limits, of course. So if you have a guy who's much, much stronger and you're in an enclosed space, I mean, look, if you and I had a fight in a phone booth, you're going to win, right? Like if we had a fight in a field, I would run away until you were – I ran a 412 mile. I'm going to outrun you, right? And when you're really exhausted, I'm going to turn around, right? Like that would be the tactic of the smaller adversary and it scales up. smaller, the smaller adversary and it's, and it scales up. Uh, so if there's too big a difference and you're in an octagon, there isn't a lot of room to move around. Eventually weight and strength\n\nwill dominate, but it doesn't always, I know what you're saying. It's like, there's, there's a borderline. Like for instance, there's a guy, uh, his name is Israel Adesanya. He's a middleweight stylebender is in my opinion, one of the most impressive and most interesting fighters. And he's so fucking smart. And one of the reasons why he's so interesting is how smart he is. He was facing this guy, Paulo Costa, who's this just behemoth of a man. Just supremely muscled, looks like an Adonis. I mean, he looks like a superhero.\n\nAnd Stylebender, although he's you know He's obviously very impressive He doesn't look like that and he doesn't have like this kind of same one strike knockout power But he said look everybody has power I have precision and I'm gonna fuck this guy up and he said just watch and in the fight He did and he did it by not hitting him as hard but hitting him much more than he could hit him right yeah and it's more technique right and you know as you as you as you use up oxygen your movements get slower and less precise right and yeah it takes less effort to slip a punch\n\nthan to punch right so if a guy if a guy if the big dude tries to punch you 10 times in a row and you slip all of them right he. He's going to be tired. He's going to be exhausted. So I looked at, I mean, this is really interesting. So I looked at reaction time, right? So they did a test with Muhammad Ali back in the late 60s or something like that. He was sort of in his heyday and early 70s, something like that. And so they put a balsa wood board in front of them, and they had some crazy camera timer thing, right? And they said, okay, hit the board with a jab,\n\nright, when you see the light flash. So the light would flash, and 15 hundredths of a second later, his glove would hit the board. So they broke it down. It took 11 hundredths of a second for his brain to perceive the flashing light and to trigger the punch. And only four hundredths of a second for the punch to travel from his resting position to the board. You see what I'm saying? It took longer to perceive the punch, to perceive the signal, a lot longer to perceive the signal than to deliver the punch, which means that if you're fighting Muhammad Ali or I'm fighting you or whatever, you're never going to beat a punch, right? The punch takes four hundreds of a second. Your brain takes 11 hundreds of a second. You will get punched every time, except that before you punch, you can't help it. Your body sends very subtle signals that you're going to punch. And it sends signals of which hand you're going to punch with.\n\nAnd the brain is really good at reading unconscious signals, right? So they did this thing where they had a videotape of poker players, right, putting their chips into a bet, right? And the people, the test subjects were watching the like two-second video clips of people just placing bets. And all they did was look at the arm and hand, move the chips. And people who didn't even know how to play poker were asked to assess the confidence with which they moved the chips. were asked to assess the confidence with which they moved the chips. And some incredible percentage of the time, they could tell who had the winning hand just by the way they moved the chips.\n\nIn other words, the brain's very perceptive. And the body is very, very, not the face, but the body is very, very revealing. So that means that in a fight, the big dude comes at you. And for any person, there's always a bigger person, right? I mean, I don't care how big you are. There's always a bigger guy out there, right? So that person comes at you and is about to throw a sort of haymaker right to end your life. Your brain will see that coming a mile away, and it's very easy to slip. And that's where a smaller person, if they really are adept at this can just win the guy and\n\ni interviewed a mma former mma fighter named kyle sonnet and he spoke about this really eloquently kyle sonnet son and son and chael sonnen is that oh chael yeah i'm sorry i didn't know how to pronounce it yeah chael sonnen yeah uh so he said you want to fight a guy that's one weight class above you that's the sweet spot he's out of his fucking mind. Let me tell you something right now John Jones beat the shit out of him and John Jones is bigger than him This I know I know what you're saying here, but in absolutes it's not applicable right this this thing of like there's actually an adage and that the bigger bet the bigger fighter will beat a smaller, better fighter.\n\nWell, statistically, it's 50-50. I don't know what that means, though, because there's weight classes. How is it possible that it's 50-50? It really depends on the skill level. There's incredibly skillful big guys, and then there's small guys that are fast, but they're not as technical. They're not as good. Well, of course. And that's why size doesn't always dominate. And either the split is within the weight class or mixing weight classes. Either way, what the statistician said was that size is not a good predictor of a win, as long as the differences aren't too extreme. And of course, the smaller the arena, the more size will dominate. And if you and I are in a shower stall, like I said,\n\nI'm not going to do very well. I just want to state, I'm a big fan of Chael Sonnen. I agree with most of the things that he says, and he's a real legend when it comes to fighting. And his prime, a tremendous wrestler and a beast of a fighter yeah yeah but he also he's a showman and he says a lot of crazy things sometimes because i think he thinks it's fun right and you know he gives hot takes and opinions on things and some of them are good and some of them aren't but well that fight you were talking about that's when he i think that's when he got out of mma i mean he was like no he fought after that fight oh did he yeah there was one there was one fight that really like put him MMA. I mean, he was like... No, he fought after that fight. Oh, did he? Yeah. He fought after that fight.\n\nThere was one fight that really put him over the edge, and his wife was like, you know, what are you doing? Well, I go back to the fight. He fought Nate Marquardt, and Nate Marquardt was in his prime, and he worked him. And Chael Sonnen came that close to beating Anderson Silva for the middleweight title. I mean, he's a beast.\n\nHe's a beast. But a good big man will almost always beat a smaller better man There's there's just things about size and strength and power and in MMA It's even more prevalent because there's so many things that go on like like you can slip a punch, right? But if you slip a punch that's designed to set you up for a leg break of course You're still stationary. You're gonna get cracked is but here's the thing is the guy you're fighting punch right but if you slip a punch that's designed to set you up for a leg right of course you're still stationary and you're going to get cracked is but here's the thing is the guy you're fighting one dimensional or does he have a comprehensive game is he throwing that punch\n\nnot really because he wants to hit you because he wants to set you up for a takedown is he throwing that punch because he wants to kick the outside of your calf like what is he actually doing with that punch well that well right and that's why fighting is so fascinating. It's complex. Right. And that's the difference between us and chimpanzees. Yeah, we can think about it and learn. And yeah, listen.\n\nThe smaller chimpanzee will never win. You know what I'm saying? I mean, that's the difference. And we can go around and around about how it breaks down. But the fact that a smaller human ever wins, that's what's uniquely human. What if you could teach a chimp jujitsu? Well, then you'd have a very scary chimp. Get a smaller chimp who decides, no, bitch, I'm the alpha.\n\nNo, that's right. Takes the big chimps back and strangles them. That's right. Listen, what will work with chimps is a coalition of males can dominate an alpha male. And it's crazy that they actually organize. That's right. Now, listen, what will work with chimps is a coalition of males can dominate an alpha male. And it's crazy that they actually organize. That's right. And that's where sociability and language and all these things come into play with humans because we're no longer – I mean, no group of humans can be dominated by a single alpha individual. Right.\n\nBecause a coalition can always take them down. And that makes society livable, right? We're not in this sort of horrible hierarchy where the biggest person gets to decide everything. Yes, yes. But what we're talking about, I mean, there's just, I just hate absolutes when it comes to fighting,\n\nbecause the variables are so extreme, and there's so many things that go into play. There's so many styles. I mean, there's a big man that will beat a better, smaller man in one way. And then a better, smaller man who has a different skill set will beat that big man in a different scenario. And then the way they interact will change. If they fight 10 times, one guy might win six. Right. And then the other guy might win four.\n\nAnd you can't predict. You have no idea. Right. Well, someone at ESPN crunched all the numbers and said that size wins about half the time. But when they say that, how much size are they talking about? Because of the fact that we're talking about weight classes, that's why I'm confused.\n\nUnless they study only the heavyweight division, which has the largest disparity in weight. It might have been that. I didn't ask him specifically, but he was pretty clear about it. It was like it's not, you know, if you're going to put your money on someone, weight is not necessarily the best variable. Skill is the best variable. Yeah, no, totally. Yeah, exactly.\n\nBut that's exactly what I'm saying about humans. It's skill. Yeah. It's not best variable. Yeah, no, totally. Yeah, exactly. But that's exactly what I'm saying about humans. It's skill. It's not physical dominance, necessarily. The problem that we were talking about with this trans athlete thing is just a problem of ideology. It's not a problem of fairness. If you talk to most people who actually understand sports, they don't think it's fair. But the people that want to support trans people and think this is a good time to make society more inclusive, they're the people that want to support trans people and think this is a good time to make society more inclusive, they're the ones who want to support it. Even though, like what's really fascinating to me\n\nis that Caitlyn Jenner is now being accused of being transphobic. Because Caitlyn Jenner stood up and said, I don't think it's fair, it's a question of fairness. And you're talking about someone who, when she was Bruce, was a fucking Olympic gold medalist, one of the greatest athletes the United States has ever produced, was on the cover of Wheaties. 1976, I remember, yeah, amazing, big athlete.\n\nThat same person is saying that it's a question of fairness and that you shouldn't have biological males competing against biological females. And they came after her yeah right which is crazy i mean this is if there is an icon in the 21st century uh of a true icon of transgender rights and of transgender acceptance it's caitlin jenner right no right i mean while they're calling her transphobic well what i mean what i mean you know again i don't have a dog in this fight so i don't really you know i i don't i don't really care what happens particularly, and I understand people are trying to usually do the right thing.\n\nBut, I mean, could there be a third competitive category of trans? That would be the best way to do it, for sure. But here's the problem. Even in that category, you would have to say, okay, we're going to have a trans category, but are we going to have trans males and trans females compete together? Well, if the answer is no, then that says a lot about trans competing in... Right. Right. I mean...\n\nWell, and also, do we have enough trans females and trans males to have a whole separate category for each of them? So you have biological males versus biological males, biological females versus biological females, trans females versus trans females, trans males versus trans males. I mean- There might be four categories at the Olympics. Look, if they do that, I'm 100% in favor of it. Yeah, totally. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's an interesting idea. I mean, these are very much first world problems, I think, right? Yeah, in many ways. And I think\n\nalso there's going to come a time where through CRISPR or through some other much more sophisticated form of manipulating the human body where we're going to be able to change what a person is, really, not just in terms of how they express and how they represent, but actually you can become a biological female. I don't know if that's going to be within our lifetime, but I think that's the future. Right. And then that really is a biological female, right? A hundred percent. Exactly. Yeah. A hundred percent. Yeah. I mean, the things that they can do now in terms of genetic manipulation are witchcraft compared to a hundred years ago, 200 years ago. So if we go into the future, another 100, 200 years, we might have no problem with this.\n\nIt might all go away. And we might be back to male versus female. Or, excuse me, male categories versus male, female versus female. You know, one thing that gets lost in all this is just what an extraordinary creation the human being is as an athlete. I mean, I was looking at athletic performance, particularly with running, because, you know, my book is divided into run, fight and think. Like the three ways you can defeat a greater power or at least have a chance of it. Right. And if you run, if you cannot run them, outfight them. If you cannot fight them, you're going to have to outthink them. And that's what happens with social change within a\n\nsociety like the labor movement in this country 100 years ago. But so I was, you know, I was looking at our capacity to run, right? And I mean, I'm a former runner, right? I ran competitively in college. I didn't even realize how amazing we are. There's an ultra-marathoner named Jim Walmsley who has won the Western States 100 a bunch of times. It's 100 miles over the Sierra Nevada, right? A huge elevation gain. His time is 14 hours and nine minutes, and he has beaten, and along the same course, they run horse and rider teams, like basically the same course. He beat the horse and rider team in his year and in almost every other year for the previous 20 years. He's a human being on foot.\n\nCan you imagine? That's so crazy. And the 1,000-mile world record is 10 days. God. A guy ran 1, thousand miles in 10 days. Do you know what the Moab 240 is? No, but I can almost guess by the name. It's a run through the Moab mountains.\n\nRight. There's a woman named Courtney DeWalter. I interviewed her in my book. She's in my book. She's a fucking monster. She's amazing. She's amazing. Yeah, she's incredible.\n\nShe beat the second place man by 10 hours. Yeah. 10 fucking monster. She's amazing. She's amazing. Yeah, she's incredible. She beat the second place man by 10 hours. Yeah. 10 fucking hours. So if she took an eight hour nap, just laid down for eight hours and just yawned, stretched her feet and put her shoes on and had breakfast and drank a cup of coffee, she's still beat him by two hours, which is fucking bananas. Well, think about this. So in the American Southwest, just that same area, right? There were two kinds of people when the whites showed up, when Europeans showed up, right? There were the Pueblo people who were very wealthy. And they irrigated. They cultivated.\n\nThey lived in towns. Towns that looked a lot like small towns in Europe, right? Up on top of mesas, very well defended. In material terms, they were doing very well, right? And then there were the Apache in the Navajo. They were complete nomads, very mobile, materially poor. I mean, they only had what they could carry, but no one could sort of catch them, right? So when the Spanish arrived in the late 1500s, what happened? They defeated the Pueblo communities immediately. Like sometimes within hours, they could roll these Pueblos, right? The Apache remained free until the last band of wild Apache were finally sort of cornered in 1886.\n\nThat's almost within my grandmother's lifetime. And they did that because they were so mobile. The whole community was expected to be able to move 40 miles a day on foot, whatever. The children, if the enemy was near, the children would sleep with food tied around their waist in case they had to run away in the middle of the night. And there was finally, the warriors were supposed to be able to go 70 miles in a day if they had to, and they'd keep that up, right?\n\nAnd so there was one war leader named Nana, N-A-N-A, Nana. And in the 1880s, I mean, the machine gun's been invented, the light bulb, the, what else, the four-stroke engine. Like, it was really modern society at that point, right? And he led like a dozen Apache warriors on a raid that over six weeks, they covered 1,500 miles. And Nana was 75 years old. So the human being, right, is meant to move. It's also really good at fighting. And it's also really, really good at thinking.\n\nBut if you just think of us as sort of animals, like one of the things that has allowed people throughout the ages to maintain their autonomy is that they were mobile. And big, powerful empires aren't that mobile. I saw that in Afghanistan. I mean, the American army is invincible until it's fighting a bunch of guys, you know, barefoot guys in the mountains who don't have an air force. You know, and then we're not so invincible. It's because they were so mobile. So this sort of like the discussion we had about MMA, it scales up, right? Like a small\n\ninsurgency can defeat an empire. And if that weren't true, if the empire always won, or if the largest person in the room always won, you mean there would be really no chance for freedom. And, you know, we defeated the British in 1776 precisely because a small mobile force can sometimes squeak out a victory. It's interesting that we keep bringing this back to fighting because I think in many ways fighting is an analogy. There's many comparisons for life. There's a lot of what takes place in life. It plays out in fighting and choices that you make in terms of strategy and also what you bring to the day, what skills. Like we were talking about Chael Sonnen before. Chael Sonnen was an elite wrestler. And in my opinion, wrestling\n\nis the single best skill for MMA because Right. Because the great wrestler dictates where the fight takes place. Right. He can decide to take the opponent down or if he's like a Chuck Liddell who's a superior striker who's also a wrestler, he can decide you have to strike with him. You can't take him down.\n\nRight. So it's just the single pillar. And it's, in life, there's things that you can be good at and there's strategies that you can apply that really they're it's very similar in that way it's like what you choose to be strong with you know whether it's strong with your willpower or your education or your your kindness your approach to life it's like these are all like interconnected skills and strategies that help you get through life. And you see this play out through one-on-one martial arts combat.\n\nRight. You see there's analogies there. There's things. There's comparisons there. Right. No, it's an amazing analogy for life. And that comes out in the more organized form of fighting, which is war. And again, I mean, like I looked at the Montenegrins who were these sort of wild mountain people in the 1600s.\n\nAnd the Ottoman Empire, which was the most powerful military force in the world at that time, kept invading Montenegro. And at one point, they outnumbered the Montenegrins 12 to 1. They had a cavalry, they had artillery, they had everything. And the Montenegrins just handed them their hat. I mean, they just destroyed them. They killed a third of the Ottoman forces. So it's just that has allowed humans, some groups of humans to maintain their autonomy in the face of a great power. And often great powers are very oppressive. And, I mean, sometimes people ask me, like, why write about freedom? Like, why now? What is it about freedom that's interesting to you?\n\nAnd, you know, my last book was called Tribe, and we talked about that. And I realized people are willing to die for their community, for their tribe, for their people, right? And people are willing to die for their community, for their tribe, for their people, right? And people are willing to die for their freedom. These two core things that without which life can seem not worth living. And people have struggled and died to defend both. And to me, if you start to understand both of those things, you start to get towards the sort of core of the human experience. Isn't it funny that someone would say why do you why is freedom interesting to you like that's that's like saying why is life interesting to you if you're if you just came back from your experience like you're with your aneurysm yeah and you realize like oh my god life is so precious it's so important right and then some person is just living normally like, well, what's so important about life? Like, what do you know? When, when, when freedom is taken away from\n\nyou, then you realize how crucial it is. That's right. That's right. Well, we're very lucky that we live in a, in a free society and a democracy and you know, it's imperfect obviously. And we're trying, you know, I think we're all trying to improve it. Most people are trying to improve it, but I think it's easy to take that for granted. We walked, part of the book is about this bizarre trek that I took. We walked along the railroad lines from Washington, D.C., me and a few other guys. We'd all been in a lot of combat and we weren't going back to combat and we were trying to figure out what to do with ourselves. And we walked along the railroad lines\n\nfrom DC to Philly and we're going to go to New York. Then we decided to turn West and we headed for Pittsburgh. We wound up right outside of Pittsburgh. So over the course of a year, trips of 50 to a hundred miles, we sort of like journeyed through America along the railroad lines. We were sleeping under bridges and abandoned houses and cooking over fires. It's really interesting. I just started it a few days ago, but it's really interesting. I'm enjoying it very much.\n\nThank you. When you did this, how old were you? A few years ago. And you just decided this would be a thing to do? I was taking the Amtrak down to D.C. with my buddy Tim that I'd been over in Afghanistan with. We made a film called Restrepo. And I was looking out the window.\n\nWe were trying to think of our next project. And I was looking out the window. I was like, Tim, man, you could walk this whole damn thing. Like there's a dirt bike trail or a maintenance road or a cornfield or whatever. And the thing about Railroad Line is it goes right through the middle of everything, right? Right through the ghettos, right through the suburbs, right through the farms. You see America from the inside out. And it's this weird swath of\n\nno man's land. Like the cops aren't really out there and it's illegal. So, you know, eventually people will spot you and you have to hide from them. We had a helicopter looking for us at one point. Why? I think they were worried we were up to no good. I mean, it was like, sometimes we walked at night when it was hot or if people were looking for us, we'd walk at night. And, you know, one in the morning, we were like along railroad lines that passed near an Air Force base, I think. I don't know. We were in some sensitive area. I mean, we didn't know that. We were just moving. And all of a sudden, this helicopter came riding up on us. And they didn't see us. We kind of crouched down and\n\nit did its grid and missed us with its floodlight. But the thing is, it's this weird no man's land. So you can sleep out, right? You can pump your water out of creeks. You can build a fire. You have to stay low. And we'd walk through towns and get food and we'd keep moving. And it was just this weird experiment in autonomy. And autonomy, I got to say, it's hard. It's physically hard, right? I mean, the safer and more comfortable you are, the more entangled you are in society, right? And in some ways, the less free you are. We were, like every night, we were the only people in the world who knew where we were. But that was hard one. We were carrying 70 pounds on our back and we were walking all day long and we were dodging the police. And you know, sometimes we drank pretty shitty water and it made us sick.\n\nReally? Did you have filters? We had a pump filter, but sometimes, I mean, we drank the Yucca Ganey River outside Connellsville, and one guy was sick for a week. I wasn't. I have a pretty strong stomach, but it really wrecked him. So it's a hard one, but look, we were on our own. No one knew where we were, and that's one definition of freedom. There are many, right?\n\nI mean, there are many definitions of freedom, but that's one of them. How long did you guys do? Like, how long was this journey? It was off and on for years, 400 miles. Wow. Yeah. And so part of my book, Freedom, is about that trek because it was my own personal experience with being physically autonomous. And it was hard.\n\nLike I said, it was a hard one. I write about the frontier as well, cause we walked through the, what used to be the Pennsylvania frontier. We, we, the railroad lines go along the Juniata river. It's the only, uh, waterway that trends East West in Pennsylvania. And, um, you know, the river is sort of carved through the mountains. And so the Indian trails follow the rivers and then the settlers roads follow the Indian trails. And so the Indian trails followed the rivers and then the settlers roads followed the Indian trails and eventually the railroads followed the settlers roads. And so we were walking up the Juniata River going west. And I wrote in the book, I write it because that was the heart of like the Indian Wars along the Pennsylvania frontier in the 1700s.\n\nAnd, you know, a lot of people that went out there, they were very poor. They were often immigrants. hundreds. And a lot of people that went out there, they were very poor. They were often immigrants. They were... And often there were people that just didn't want the colonial government breathing down their neck. That was one of the more interesting things about the beginning of the book where you were talking about a sign that you found on someone's property that says that they will resist the federal government by any means necessary. That's right. So fast forward 300 years, we pass a sign nailed to a tree, like along the Juniata Waterway.\n\nAnd it's very wild there, right? It's very, very beautiful. Yeah. And the sign saying, yeah, this is private property. We will resist the federal authority by any means necessary. How old do you think that sign was? Oh, it was contemporary, right? And this was a few years ago.\n\nThis is 2012, 2013 that we saw that sign was? Oh, it was contemporary. And this was a few years ago. This is 2012, 2013 that we saw that sign. But 300 years ago, the people that settled that area were absolutely like that was what they wanted. But the price that that came with was horrific. So basically, you go into the wilderness and you're a lot more free, but you're in a lot more danger. You go into the wilderness and you're a lot more free, but you're in a lot more danger. And danger is a loss of freedom, right? It's its own kind of loss of freedom. And so what the settlers did was they, for example, of course, there's no fire department.\n\nThese are people who are living in log cabins in the wilderness. So their chimneys were made out of wood, right? They're interlocking logs that they caked with mud, and the mud insulated the wood. It was like little tiny log cabins that ran up the side of the house. That was the chimney. And so they had ropes at the top of the chimneys, because if the chimneys caught fire, the whole house would go up. And if a chimney caught fire, they would pull the whole stack down with that rope. That was their fire department, was having a rope at the top of the chimney, right? So, but when it came to the Indian Wars, I mean, just you can't imagine how bloody this was, right? And no mercy given on anybody. People were tortured to death on both sides, right? It was absolutely horrific. So, what they did,\n\nthere was no colonial militia. There was nothing out there. They just had each other. So the settlers had a kind of mutual defense pact. And if you were out there, you owed your life to the common defense of the community. And if you didn't do that, you were an outcast. In fact, if you were an adult male and you failed to carry a gun and a scalping knife and a tomahawk in your belt at all times, if you didn't do that, you were mocked and you were cast out from the community, which obviously is not really a form of freedom. I mean, freedom includes the freedom to not fight if you don't want to fight, right? And so basically my point is pick your poison your poison you want the government to tell you what to do or do you want the community to tell you what to do and the more danger you're in you're in the more you need one or the other and there really is no way to be completely safe completely\n\ncomfortable and completely free without obligation to your tribe right Right. When you wrote this, how much studying did you wind up doing on the various North American tribes and their strategies? Because that's also something that you talk about in the Iroquois, and you go pretty deep into a lot of that as well. Yeah. I mean, I researched that after the trip. I mean, I did the trip years ago,\n\nand I wanted to write about freedom. And I thought, wow, interesting to – in the book itself, there's a lot of research into topics, right? So like MMA and the Apache and all that. I thought, well, it would be really interesting to sort of weave my narrative about this walking trip. We called it high-speed vagrancy. I mean, we really moved, right? 10, 20, 25 miles a day sometimes. We were really interesting to weave this trip\n\ninto the research that I did. And so that's how I came to form the book. But so the native tribes of that area, they were dominated by the Iroquois. And so this is where this great truth about freedom comes in. The more people you're with, the more – the better you can defend yourself, right? So the Iroquois were indomitable until the Europeans showed up. until the Europeans showed up.\n\nAnd one reason the Europeans couldn't be defeated was because they came with diseases that just decimated the ranks of the native people, right? So, you know, you can play the sort of thought experiment. If, say, smallpox didn't exist and the native peoples of North America had their original populations, the Iroquois were an extremely well-organized, huge, huge organization.\n\nAnd, you know, you can make a pretty good argument that the Europeans actually could not have defeated them militarily. But, you know, what was their strategy? I mean, for all those native people, the strategy was why fight a, quote, fair fight in the open when you could ambush people, surprise attacks, creep up on them at dawn? You know, like you're just going to lose more people if you fight in the open, you know, bows and arrows against firearms. Why would you do that? Yeah, of course. Yeah. And they were extremely effective at it.\n\nAnd the Iroquois as, or this applied to any of the tribes, five or 10 times as many men as they really were. That was the tactical advantage of that kind of mobility. Well, that was the issue with Texas and the Comanches was the tactical ability of the Comanche to fight off horseback when the settlers hadn't figured out how to do that yet. And they were still using muskets and the Comanche could launch multiple arrows. They would keep their arrows interlaced in their fingers and they would shoot one arrow and then another arrow. So these guys would shoot one musket and then they'd have to reload. It took\n\nlike 30 seconds. By the time that happened, the command sheet would be on them and filling them full of arrows. The settlers that I wrote about, some of them were able to load their rifle at a dead run. And this is with a ramrod, put the ball in the barrel and the patch and then pour the powder in or the other way around, the powder and then the ball. Anyway, they could do this at a dead run. But still, it was no match, in some ways, no match for a bow and arrow in the woods. But if you had ranks of riflemen who were alternating, firing and reloading, that is just suicide to charge them in a field. Of course, that's what happened in European warfare. The casualties were horrific.\n\nIt's really interesting about the Comanche. I'm sure you know Empire of the Summer Moon. Yeah, I was going to ask you about that. Yeah, yeah. Amazing writer. Amazing book. There's a direct equivalent in Genghis Khan in East Asia, a horseback culture that the European powers really didn't know how to deal with militarily. And in my book, Freedom, I talk about the sort of basic difference between mobile societies\n\nand sedentary ones. You know, like about 10,000 years ago, people started planting grains and settling down. And it allowed for an accumulation of wealth and in some ways, unfortunately, the beginning of a stratification of society. As soon as you can accumulate wealth, some people are going to accumulate more than others and they become rulers and they can oppress people, et cetera, et cetera. In mobile societies like the Apache, it's very hard to have social classes because you can't accumulate anything.\n\nAnd so in history, the sedentary people, although more powerful where they stood and more wealthy in material terms, often had this sort of like strange insecurity and about their – like if they were – like are we living better lives than the nomads? And the nomads themselves had an incredible arrogance about the settled people, right? And they just thought they were badasses and that the farmers were not. And it was very clear. There was a group called the Yamut in Northern Iran. And they had, I'm doing this by memory, but they had this sort of saying, this sort of song that dates back to this era, you know, hundreds and hundreds of years ago. The sort of eternal clash between the migratory nomadic people, herding cultures and the farming cultures. I do not have a mill with willow trees. I have a horse and a court. I will kill you and go. and a court, I will kill you and go.\n\nI will kill you and go. Wow. So, of course, those people lost. I mean, the world is dominated by sedentary people that accumulate wealth and can amass huge armies and blah, blah, blah. But it's good to keep in mind that mobility was, for a very, very long time, was a very effective and rational choice that some societies made and that they felt themselves to be superior to the wealthy settled people in the valleys. Yeah, that was Genghis Khan's thing. Yeah, totally. He had massive disdain for anyone who didn't live in a tent.\n\nOh, totally. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. And they thought they were weak. Yeah, that's right. And I mean, you can make an argument that wealth and sedentary life make people weak, right? I mean, you can make that argument, certainly from the eyes of a nomadic culture. That's what it looks like, right? And, you know, even the sort of ancient biblical story of fratricide of Cain and Abel, you know, even, I mean, you know, Cain was a farmer and Abel was a nomad. And it goes, you know, the thinking, the ethnographic thinking\n\nor the anthropological thinking about this is this story goes back to this original bifurcation between farmers, the sedentary people and the mobile ones. But Cain kills Abel because Abel is a shepherd and has sheep. And when it comes time to make a sacrifice to God, Abel can sacrifice a fat sheep and all Cain has is vegetables. And he's jealous. And he kills his nomad brother because he's jealous of what Abel can offer God. And there you see the affluence, but the insecurity that wealthy sedentary people have for those who, quote, have nothing left to lose. There's a great allure to the kind of freedom that we're describing, right? To the ability to just live off your back and go hiking and, and, and live in the mountains and,\n\nand do that kind of thing. It's like, it appeals to us in a strange way where we know there's something wrong with sedentary lifestyle and with living in a city and dealing with the, just the bullshit of traffic and, and this unnatural environment that we've created with concrete and asphalt and pollution, there's something massively appealing. Almost like your DNA, like your essence calls out for a time where life was simpler and more pure and more interconnected with nature.\n\nSo when you see someone who's doing that, there's a part of you that goes, ah, I want to do that. Right. Well, you know, it's the mobile, I mean, it's the mobile groups that we see as romantic, right? I mean, you know, motorcycle gangs and stuff like that.\n\nI mean, you know, they're bad actors, right? I mean, some of those guys don't necessarily bring a lot of joy and happiness to the world. Some do, I suppose. But whatever. The point is they're romanticized. Yes.\n\nRight? And the mobile groups are often romanticized. I mean, you know, the sort of like guerrilla fighters, you know, whatever. I mean, over and over again in our imagination. Like that's an appealing thing is the group that is over – that they're overmatched, they're the underdog, but they're so skilled and mobile that they eventually win. Like that's very, very appealing to humans. Yeah, that is, right? It's a classic tale. That's right. That's right. And it's even in the Bible, you know, that Cain and Abel,\n\nthe sort of seminal story of fratricide goes all the way back. That sort of division goes all the way back in the jealousy of the – the jealousy that we wealthy sedentary people have for the mobile people. Like it's very, very ancient. One thing I should point out, and I think it's worth talking about, we were talking about a little bit before that our safety in the world comes from the fact that we have people around us that we trust who will help defend our community, right? And because if we don't have a community, if we're not part of a tribe, if we're not part of some group, we're alone in the world.\n\nWe're very vulnerable. Humans die pretty quickly by themselves in the wilderness. And the larger the group, the safer it is from attack from other groups. I mean just as a basic fact of human existence. And so one of the things that – I mean, you can sort of divide it up in an interesting way. When you use the word freedom, freedom works in its sort of simple, the word freedoms works in the simplest form in the context of freedom from oppression by, freedom from being oppressed by an outside group, by an enemy group, right? When you're talking about your own society, the society that\n\nyou have signed on, born into and have signed onto, you're really talking about your rights. They're kind of different things. So as an example, I looked at a group called the Yamnaya and the Yamnaya were these nomadic horse culture from the eastern steppe, from the Russian steppe, 5,000 years ago. Okay? And they fought on horse-drawn chariots with battle axes. And they traveled without their women. They traveled without women. These groups of male raiders would go out and they swept through Europe.\n\nAnd they entered the Iberian Peninsula, Spain and Portugal, about 5,000 years ago. And they had a real warrior culture. And when they rode into Neolithic Spain, and they're very, very mobile, and they're very good fighters. And they rode into Neolithic Spain. And that society didn't even know what a horse was, right? They were completely overmatched. And over the course of about 100 years, the Yamnaya completely eliminated all the men in Iberia. Just think about that.\n\nTrue. All the men in Iberia. Just think about that. True. All the men, not the women, who clearly were mated with. And the Iberian population now are the descendants of the Yamnaya and the Neolithic women and then other population groups that moved in, the Moors and et cetera, et cetera. et cetera, et cetera. But the Neolithic men were completely scrubbed from the gene pool because they could not defend their territory. So one point I want to make is, and this isn't a pitch for militarism, it's a pitch for realism, which is a very important part of freedom comes from being able to defend yourself and the people you love. And if you can't do that, I mean,\n\nin ancient historical terms, you know, now there's international laws and there's defense pacts and there's NATO and, you know, whatever. Like, Lichtenstein does not really have to worry about being invaded because it's part of a, you know, an agreement between nations. But throughout most of human history, if you could not defend yourself, you were very, very vulnerable to having your freedom taken away and invariably would. There's a resistance in today's culture, particularly from people that are more in line with progressive thinking. There's a resistance to accepting the fact that the military is important. Right. I mean, I think there's a sort of lovely idea that peace is sort of the default state.\n\nAnd if you just don't have a military and start thinking in militaristic terms, that peace will take over and then no one will need a military and then we're all going to be fine. But that clearly has not been true throughout history. and then we're all going to be fine. But that clearly has not been true throughout history. I mean, you look at history and the nations that couldn't defend themselves. I mean, look, Montenegro was not overrun by the Ottomans because it could defend itself. Right. Right. Right.\n\nAnd for a lot of human history, and this is true in a playground fight as well. I mean, if you can't defend yourself, you might end up having to do what someone else tells you to do, right? That's just an eternal human truth. And so the trick is, how do you become well enough armed and militaristic enough and sort of badass enough and hierarchical enough because military groups depend on hierarchy in order to fight effectively? on hierarchy in order to fight effectively. A hierarchy of command, not of honor, but of command. How do you do that and also have a society which is just and egalitarian? And as I say in my book, a society that's well enough organized to defend itself can also oppress its own people under the wrong leadership. So how do you have it both ways? How do you defend yourself against outsiders, but also not use the apparatus of the military to then oppress your own people the way Pinochet did and Franco did and et cetera? I mean, that's the\n\nhistory of dictators. My father grew up in Spain and left when Franco took when the fascists took over in Spain I just wrote an article about how that happens you know the Spain had a democratically elected government and Franco came in and said that's bullshit that the it was a fraudulent election and we're going to take over\n\nand he took over with the military so that's an example of a military force that's used that was used improperly to oppress its own people. And so for me, that's the eternal human dilemma. If you'd be strong enough to defend yourself and not allow that to oppress your own people. Well, it's interesting too because what we're talking about here, this utopian concept of peace being a default state, there's a lot of people that they have similar utopian beliefs about policing in the United States. And that's one of the reasons why people think we need to defund the police.\n\nAnd that people, if you leave them alone, they're probably not going to commit the same amount of crime and will find a default state. And if you have social workers that deal with people that have domestic disputes instead of police officers, we'll probably have less confrontation. And I think there's also a deep resistance to avoid militarizing our police department. Right, right. our police department. Right, right. But there's a lot of confusion as to what's the correct way to go about this and what is the correct way of actually ensuring\n\nthat people are safe and protected and that law and order is achieved and that people respect this rule of land because it makes our society and our culture better and safer for everyone. It makes it easier for people to innovate and easier for people to live their lives. But how does that balance out? And how does that balance out without the kind of leadership that you do see being necessary in the military?\n\nWell, I mean, here's what I think is happening. I think the people that say defund the police i'm not even quite sure what that means right i mean i remember like during covid there was like a there was a phrase like abolish rent and i'm like what i'm not even sure what that means like what how would you implement that like what do you specifically you're talking about but likewise with the defund the i mean i sort of i get the gist of the idea like people are hurting abolish rent but then that has crazy unintended consequences. Right. Right. So likewise, with defund the police, I kind of know where you're coming from. I just don't quite know how it would work.\n\nSo I think what those people are doing is they're saying we have given up trying to reform the police. And clearly there are some police departments that need reform. We all remember Rodney King. Right. Yeah. And, you know, many, many other disgraceful incidents since then. I think what they're saying is we have given up trying to reform the police, police unions block any reform. All right, you know what? Fuck it. We're just going to defund you, right? Again, I don't think that's the right solution. There's good policing, bad policing, and no policing. We can look at situations with no policing. So one of the things I looked at in my book was,\n\nyou know, on the frontier in the 1840s, 50s, 60s, 1870s, on the American frontier out west, there was little to no policing. You know, a sheriff, you know, one sheriff in 500 square miles, whatever it was, minimal policing. And it was a largely male population. Okay. So there weren't even, you know, if you want to just put it this way, I mean, one of the constant causes of violence between individual men is competition over women, right? I mean, bar fights in all kinds of situations, that is one seed of conflict between men. So there were very few women out there to even have conflicts over, right? The murder rate was so high that, I mean, it completely eclipsed the highest murder rates in the eastern cities. There was one town, I mean, it completely eclipsed the highest murder rates in the eastern cities. There was one town, a railroad town, that killed 7% of the population died by murder in the first three months, if I'm remembering my numbers correctly.\n\n7%, right? Holy shit. Right. So, you know, in, what, a of years, if at that rate, without more people, the town's gone. They've killed them. That's so crazy. Bodies were piling up so fast. And these were virtually all male towns, right? With no police force. So you got to be careful about saying, oh, you know, if you take the police out of the equation, people will be peaceful. No.\n\nWe know that they won't be. They're a lot more peaceful when wo"
