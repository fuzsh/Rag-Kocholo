As an Amazon Associate I earn money from qualifying purchases.\n\nPublication Order of Non-Fiction Books\n\nPublication Order of Anthologies\n\nSebastian Junger\n\nSebastian Junger was born in Belmont, Massachussets the son of a painter (Ellen Sinclair) and a physicist (Miguel Chapero Junger). His father was born in Dresden, Germany and of Spanish, Austrian, Italian, and Russian descent, immigrated to America during the second world war in order to escape persecution due to paternal Jewish ancestry so he could study engineering at MIT.\n\nJunger grew up in the Belmont neighborhood, which he later learned was the Boston Strangler’s territory and was inspired to write “A Death in Belmont”.\n\nJunger graduated in the year 1980 from Concord Academy and got a bachelor of arts degree in cultural anthropology in 1984 from Wesleyan University.\n\nAs a contributing editor to Vanity Fair, an award winning journalist, and a special correspondent to ABC News, he has covered major international news stories all around the world, and has gotten a Peabody Award and a National Magazine.\n\nHe has also written for magazines like The New York Times Magazine, Harper’s, Adventure, National Geographic Adventure, and Men’s Journal.\n\nHe started working as a freelance writer, often attempting to publish articles on topics which interested him. Sebastian often took on other jobs for temporary periods of time to support himself. Researching dangerous occupations as a topic, he got deeply engaged in learning all about commercial fishing and all of its hazards.\n\nWith the success of his non-fiction book, “The Perfect Storm”, he was touted as being a new Hemingway. His work stimulated a renewed interest in adventure nonfiction. The book got a large pre-publication deal for film rights, was on the New York Times bestseller list for a year in hardback, and for two years in paperback. The book was turned into a movie that starred Mark Wahlberg and George Clooney released by Warner Brothers.\n\nSebastian said that when he was recovering from a chainsaw injury, he was inspired to write about some dangerous jobs. He had planned on starting with commercial fishing in Gloucester, Massachussets.\n\nHe turned this into a non fiction book called “The Perfect Storm”, while he became more involved with learning about the crew members and the different decisions and conditions which contributed to the deaths of the Andrea Gail. The fishing boat had gone down off of the coast of Nova Scotia during a storm in October of 1991, with all six crew members dying: Dale Murphy, Michael Moran, Alfred Pierre, Billy Tyne, Bobby Shatford, and David Sullivan.\n\nIn the year 2000, he published an article called “The Forensics of War” in Vanity Fair. He got a National Magazine Award for it.\n\nSebastian has also won a SAIS Novartis Prize for journalism. And his documentary film “Restrepo”, which he directed with Tim Hetherington, was nominated for an Academy Award and won the Grand Jury Prize for a domestic documentary at Sundance Film Festival in the year 2010. For “A Death in Belmont”, he won the 2007 PEN/Winship award for the book.\n\nHe has also received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement and the International Press Academy’s Humanitarian Award.\n\n“The Perfect Storm” is a non-fiction book that was released in the year 1997. October of the year 1991. It was truly “the perfect storm”, which is a tempest that might happen just once per century: a Nor’easter that was created by so rare that a combination of factors which it couldn’t possibly have been any worse.\n\nCreating winds of 120 miles an hour and waves ten stories high, the storm whipped the ocean to inconceivable levels few people on Earth have ever witnessed before. Few, save for the six man crew of the Andrea Gail, a commercial fishing boat tragically headed toward its hellish center.\n\n“A Death in Belmont” is a non-fiction book that was released in the year 2006. A deadly collision of three lives. During the spring of 1963, the peaceful suburb of Belmont, Massachusetts, has been rocked by a shocking sex murder which fits the Boston Strangler exactly. Sensing a break in this case which has paralyzed Boston, the cops track down Roy Smith, a black man that cleaned the house of the victim that same day and left behind a receipt with his name on the counter in the kitchen. Smith gets hastily convicted of this murder, however the horror of the Strangler continues on.\n\nAlbert DeSalvo, the man that would later confess in lurid detail to the crimes of this Strangler, is also in Belmont on the day of the murder, and works in the Jungers’ home as a carpenter. During this powerful and spare narrative, he chronicles three lives which that collide, and ultimately get destroyed, in this vortex of one of the first and most controversial serial killing cases in all of America.\n\n“A World Made of Blood” is a stand alone novel that was released in the year 2012. This is a brutal and intimate account of one young American journalist attempting to survive during his latest assignment.\n\nDaniel was looking to escape from the Midwest and its small town newspapers. However he never signed up for this. A war torn West African city that was strung in barbed wire, with its child soldiers brandishing guns in the streets, and embassies abandoned. The veteran photographer partnered with Daniel, named Andre, is conversant in all of this: the locals, the jungle, and particularly the attendant risks with covering the war.\n\nAnd it pushes them go even deeper into the conflict and go right to the front lines. Yet in a fight like this, there aren’t any reliable lines of safety. Western rules just don’t apply, and atrocity truly is color blind. Right when Daniel believes he has convinced his fearless partner to up and retreat, they show up at what might be the end of the road for each of them.\n\nThis is a powerful piece of short fiction that is both timeless and modern at the same time, combines the best elements of psychological horror and classic war literature. Sebastian’s unforgettable journey into the heart of darkness confronts mankind’s own unrelenting savagery and his unpredictable capacity for courage, as well as courage."
