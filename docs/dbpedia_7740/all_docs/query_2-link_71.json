He often took other jobs for temporary periods of time to support himself. Researching dangerous occupations as a topic, he became deeply engaged in learning about commercial fishing and its hazards.\n\nErnest Hemingway\n\nSebastian Junger: The Perfect Storm\n\nTim Hetherington\n\nSebastian Junger: War\n\nSebastian Junger: Tribe\n\nSebastian Junger: Freedom\n\nPersonal life\n\nBetween at least 2011 and 2014, Junger was married to writer Daniela Petrova.\n\nHis first daughter was born in 2016 when he was age 55. He is married and lives with wife and 2 children in Cape Cod. He co-owned a bar in New York called The Half-King. He is an atheist.\n\nNotable work\n\nSebastian Junger: The Perfect Storm\n\nIn 2000, the book was adapted by Warner Brothers as a film of the same name, starring George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg.\n\nSebastian Junger: The Perfect Storm\n\nJunger established The Perfect Storm Foundation to provide cultural and educational grants to children across the country whose parents make their living in the commercial fishing industry.\n\nJunger suggests that Smith's conviction for Goldberg's death was influenced by racism. The prosecution called witnesses who remembered seeing Smith chiefly because he was a black man walking in a predominately white neighborhood. (Eyewitness testimony has been shown to be notoriously flawed.) Smith had cleaned Goldberg's house the day she was attacked and left a receipt (for his work) with his name on her kitchen counter. No physical evidence, such as bruises or blood, linked Smith to the crime. In 1976, he was granted commutation of his life sentence. Before he gained release, Smith died of lung cancer.\n\nAlan Dershowitz\n\nTim Hetherington\n\nSebastian Junger: War\n\nSebastian Junger: Tribe\n\nRecognition\n\nIn 2015, Junger received the International Press Academy’s Humanitarian Award.\n\nExternal links\n\nSebastian Junger: War"
