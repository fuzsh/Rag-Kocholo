        "text": "Year after year, we hear arguments for taking the stink out of our sulfurous political rhetoric. It would be better for congressional productivity. It would be better for our international dignity. It would be better for our national literacy, our local advocacy, our general civility and the future etiquette of our children.\n\nBut the one argument I had not heard, until reading Sebastian Junger’s “Tribe: On Homecoming and Belonging,” is that we should clean up our act for the sake of our returning troops.\n\nMr. Junger never makes this point explicitly. What he writes, simply, is this: After months of combat, during which “soldiers all but ignore differences of race, religion and politics within their platoon,” they return to the United States to find “a society that is basically at war with itself. People speak with incredible contempt about — depending on their views — the rich, the poor, the educated, the foreign-born, the president or the entire U.S. government.”\n\nIt’s a formula for deep despair. “Today’s veterans often come home to find that, although they’re willing to die for their country,” he writes, “they’re not sure how to live for it.”\n\nWith that, Mr. Junger has raised one of the most provocative ideas of this campaign season — and accidentally written one of its most intriguing political books. All without mentioning a single candidate, or even the president, by name.\n\n“Tribe” is not a typical Junger book. He doesn’t tell one knockout story, as he did in the “The Perfect Storm,” which made him rich and famous, or as he did in “War,” which — along with his documentaries “Restrepo” and “Korengal” — established him as one of the country’s most mesmerizing chroniclers of the Afghanistan war. Rather, he gives us an extended-play version of an article he wrote last summer for Vanity Fair — one that’s part ethnography, part history, part social science primer, part cri de coeur.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
