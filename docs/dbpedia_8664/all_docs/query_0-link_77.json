        "meta_description": "The Sunset Limited- Steppenwolf Theatre- One man saves another mans life on a New York City subway platform.  Now, sitting in a room together these two strangers speak their deepest truths. Cormac McCarthy, the acclaimed author of All the Pretty Horses and No Country for Old Men, brings his trademark terse, masterful voice to this new dramatic work.  Ensemble member Austin Pendleton is featured in the two-person play; with a director to be announced at a later date.",

        "text": "Chicago Tribune - Somewhat Recommended\n\n\"...there are segments of monologue here--as spoken by the irrepressibly honest actor Austin Pendleton under the sympathetic direction of Sheldon Patinkin--that are nothing short of dazzling in their level of articulation. They're all pretty much in service of the same idea--that the more education you have, the harder it is to rationalize continuing to live.\"\n\nRead Full Review\n\n- Chris Jones\n\nChicago Sun Times - Somewhat Recommended\n\n\"...As an acting exercise that demands the utmost in concentration and listening skills by its two performers (not to mention its audience), McCarthy's play, staged in the Garage space, is certainly a formidable test. As an argument between the secular and religious approaches to existence it is challenging, and at times even playful, though it also can be sophomoric. And as an artificial dramatic construct it is, both literally and figuratively, cast in black and white.\"\n\nRead Full Review\n\n- Hedy Weiss\n\nDaily Herald - Somewhat Recommended\n\n\"...The play has a plain-spoken eloquence and a dry sense of humor - but at 100 minutes, this debate on suicide is overly long, redundant and generally comes across as more didactic than dramatic. Still, the honesty underscoring the performances and the graceful, sensitive writing make the play a debate worth pondering.\"\n\n- Barbara Vitello\n\nSouthtownStar - Somewhat Recommended\n\n\"...While this conflict of ideas, as directed by Sheldon Patinkin, is fascinating for the first half-hour of the 1 hour, 45-minute work, it soon turns repetitive. Black and White talk a lot  at the kitchen table, as they walk around the kitchen table and as they return to the kitchen table. There's little physical movement, except for the times that White rushes to the door and says he has to leave, but never does.\"\n\nRead Full Review\n\n- Betty Mohr\n\nChicago Reader - Somewhat Recommended\n\n\"...Actors Austin Pendleton and Freeman Coffey lend intellectual and emotional depth to this engaging, nuanced world premiere of novelist Cormac McCarthy's two-man play. They're so good they almost compensate for the script's inertia and racial stereotyping, as an uneducated, plain-talking \"old country nigger\" rescues a white New York intellectual from suicide, then spends 135 minutes trying to lead him to Jesus.\"\n\n- Justin Hayford\n\nWindy City Times - Somewhat Recommended\n\n\"...This all makes for an interesting Platonic dialogueWaiting For Godot on the IRTbut what makes it a PLAY is the interpretive schematic imposed on it by director Sheldon Patinkin and his two actors, both of whom have played these characters many times before.\"\n\nRead Full Review\n\n- Mary Shen Barnidge\n\nTime Out Chicago - Somewhat Recommended\n\n\"...as with most recent plays of this nature, splendid performances blur your vision. As a yarn-spinning, Jesus-loving ex-con from the capital-S South, Coffey invests a profound dignity. And the inestimable Pendleton, with his spindly voice and trademark quicksilver anxiety, activates most of the plays considerable spiritual metaphors without drawing attention to their prose-iness. (To be fair, of all the undramatic novelist-gone-dramatist plays Steppenwolf has produced of late, McCarthys meditation on emptiness contains the most resonant axioms.)\"\n\n- Christopher Piatt\n\nChicagoCritic - Recommended\n\n\"...It sure takes two terrific actors like Pendleton and Coffey and outstanding writing to hold our interest for one hour and forty-fine minutes. The ideas presented offer so much food-for-thought that youll be discussing them long after seeing The Sunset Limited. Only good can come from that. This is mind expanding theatre at its best. Put on your thinking cap and grab a seat at Blacks table  the debate begins.\"\n\nRead Full Review\n\n- Tom Williams\n\nChicago Stage and Screen - Highly Recommended\n\n\"...Thanks to the real and riveting work of actors Austin Pendleton and Freeman Coffey, we care greatly about what happens to the two men. Black and White may be the token names (and reflections of cultural prejudice), but in the hands of Pendleton and Coffey, they become fundamentally alive and human. A little opening night shakiness should dissipate as this terrific duo settles into their run. Director Sheldon Patinkin's unobtrusive touch allows the men to engage an intense conversation and struggle of wills that gets to the root of the human condition. Steppenwolf's \"The Sunset Limited\" is an amazing evening of theatre!\"\n\n- Joe Stead"
