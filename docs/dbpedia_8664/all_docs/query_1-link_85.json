        "text": "One does not approach a Cormac McCarthy novel lightly.\n\nFor starters, he writes bleak, bloody books. Anyone who has seen the Oscar award-winning No Country for Old Men starring Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem or The Road with Viggo Mortensen knows that these fun tales are not for the faint of heart.\n\nIt’s also hard reading.\n\nMcCarthy sometimes writes using stream of consciousness and very little punctuation — no quotation marks, very few commas. He also likes big words, sometimes. Hard words. Words like hackamore, cordillera, purlieus and adamantine. Or unnecessarily long smart-sounding words like bivouacked and adduced.\n\nWhich should be enough to steer you away from McCarthy territory. Except that sometimes we need to force ourselves out of our comfort zone — for our own betterment.\n\nIt’s like the blues. No one ever wrote a blues song that’s happy, but listening to the blues — good blues music, I mean — is nourishment for the soul.\n\nStill, it takes time to get up for a McCarthy novel (a phrase no one has ever used before) and the right attitude and maybe even time of year.\n\nA couple of years ago, I finally found the sweet spot — the right time, mood and season (winter, of course) — to crack open my copy of The Road. And while that post-apocalyptic view of what America may look like wasn’t fun, it was rewarding. I did find some small consolation in the human condition and a little bit of hope in the power of love, of father to son.\n\nIt also read like a cleaner, more mature version of the writer, written more than 20 years after an earlier Cormac McCarthy which was my second attempt at cracking his oeuvre.\n\nBlood Meridian, or the Evening Redness in the West was written in 1985 and touted as “epic,” a word much used and abused in civilized discourse these days. Harold Bloom, the esteemed critic and Shakespearean scholar, declared the book to be “clearly the major esthetic achievement of any living American writer.”\n\nAt least that’s what he says on the back of my Vintage International paperback edition of Blood Meridian. I didn’t read Bloom’s full review.\n\nI also didn’t finish reading this book.\n\nThat’s a hard thing for me to do, or rather not do, especially after investing time and mental and emotional energy reading almost half the novel. I feel a major sense of letdown, even guilt, whenever I abandon a book, especially one as highly regarded as Blood Meridian.\n\nI end up with a sinking feeling which slowly gives way to relief when I dive into my next novel. Or when I write about why I abandoned a book, which feels like catharsis.\n\nI read through almost 150 pages of Blood Meridian, about halfway through this 335-page “extraordinary, breathtaking achievement,” before I realized that like “muh proze” I don’t care what John Banville thinks.\n\nIt’s not the extreme, brutal violence and gore that got me to shut the book for good. McCarthy spares no detail in dispatching of his victims, for sure, but I knew going into this nightmarish anti-western novel what I was getting into so I accepted the ghoulish gore.\n\nNo, what finally got me to give up was his writing.\n\nTo be sure, McCarthy can write wonderfully — when he wants to. A paragraph likes this serves as a fine example of how vividly he can render a scene and its characters:\n\n“He went down a narrow sandy road and as he went he met a deadcart bound out with a load of corpses, a small bell tolling the way and a lantern swinging from the gate. Three men sat on the box not unlike the dead themselves or spirit folk so white they were with lime and nearly phosphorescent in the dusk. A pair of horses drew the cart and they went on up the road in a faint miasma of carbolic and passed from sight. He turned and watched them go. The naked feet of the dead jostled stiffly from side to side.”\n\nHe is also capable of writing pompously, using such antiquated expressions like, “Days of riding where there rode no soul save he.”\n\nBut it’s the utterly ridiculousness of some of his writing that can test the patience of a reader. Like this:\n\n“The survivors lay quietly in that cratered void and watched the whitehot stars go rifling down the dark. Or slept with their alien hearts beating in the sand like pilgrims exhausted upon the face of the planet Anareta, clutched to a namelessness wheeling in the night.”\n\nAnd this:\n\n“They rode through a narrow draw where the leaves were shingled up in ice and they crossed a high saddle at sunset where wild doves were rocketing down the wind and passing through the gap a few off of the ground, veering wildly among the ponies and dropping off down into the blue gulf below.”\n\nThe planet Anareta? Rocketing down the wind?\n\nHoly jumping anachronisms! Are we in 1850s America or in some Arthur C. Clarke’s warped space-time setting?\n\nThis kind of silliness in his writing is a shame, truly, because McCarthy’s prose reaches sublimity at times. His description of a massacre inside a church is bone-crunching good — “The primitive painted saints in their frames hung cocked on the walls as if an earthquake had visited and a dead Christ in a glass bier lay broken in the chancel floor” — but then you find yourself stumbling upon a line like this from the judge,\n\n“Whether in my book or not, every man is tabernacle in every other and he in exchange and so on in an endless complexity of being and witness to the uttermost edge of the world.”\n\nThat’s when you realize it’s okay to let go. To close the book.\n\nLife’s too short for tabernacled men, even if I were living on the planet Anareta."
