Only we do.\n\nRichard Rorty1\n\nCormac McCarthy is the most interesting of literary writers. In straightforward terms, his writing has all the ingredients that make good books. His books are exciting, well-paced, violent, intense and visceral; his characters reveal the most acute suffering, loss and redemptive longing of the human condition. Stylistically, McCarthy’s scriptural prose transports readers to monstrously enchanted reveries which are at once beautiful, sublime and terrifying in their vividness. It is not surprising, then, that McCarthy’s literary status as one of the most significant authors of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries is secure as both a popular best-selling author and as an artist who has achieved distinct literary recognition. Notwithstanding the Nobel Prize for Literature, which still eludes him, McCarthy has received a host of major awards and prizes, including the Saul Bellow Award for Achievement in American Fiction (2008), the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction (2007), the McArthur Fellowship (1981) and a Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Writing (1969). If the importance of literature were only measured by its timelessness, McCarthy might come up short. This would be not at all due to a lack of perennial appeal or relevance in his works, but instead concerns the unique way his literature endures. McCarthy’s work, his novels particularly, actively resist any ahistorical or literary classification. And this is precisely why McCarthy is endlessly fascinating: not simply because his writing appeals to classical enduring themes such as good and evil, love and mourning, redemption and fallenness, courage and tenacity, coming of age, revenge – although McCarthy is comfortable offering literary representation of these themes too – but because he is a profoundly historical writer. He writes with a sense of how through contemporary history, historical change itself is made manifest, whether in the guise of generational tension, technological change, economic displacement or class antagonism. McCarthy is\n\n2 Cormac McCarthy, Philosophy and the Physics of the Damned\n\nthus significant because his work is visceral, philosophical and reflective concerning new ways in which the great metaphysical questions of life and death are continually renewed. In his 2007 Rolling Stone interview with David Kushner, McCarthy says as much: ‘If it doesn’t concern life and death [. . .] It’s not interesting.’2 McCarthy judges the ultimate bar of significance in terms of questions of life and death, which begs the urgent question as to what philosophical resonance is present in his writing. That McCarthy has philosophical interests, or even is a philosophical novelist, engaging with issues which should be relevant to any philosopher, is obvious. If we assemble a cursory list of common themes in McCarthy’s writing, we can clearly see that he is broadly concerned with the nature of things. For example, his work encompasses questions relating to justice and law, metaphysics and ontology, the nature of language, the ethical status of human beings and the consequences of political organisation, all posed with his own distinctive bodily and geographical aesthetics. However, to say all this is not enough, because it does not get to the crux of McCarthy’s writing, nor more specifically to the philosophical concerns therein. What it is necessary to come to terms with, if we are to get to grips with the body of thought, writing and reflections which McCarthy bestows upon us, is the distinct synthesis of literature and philosophy which animates McCarthy’s work. Indeed, it will be my contention in this book that McCarthy offers a unique type of literary philosophy, one that transcends the conventional generic definitions of either ‘literature’ or ‘philosophy’ as distinct objects of study. However, to be clear at the outset, my approach will not preclude the study of McCarthy in literary or philosophical terms. For example, I do not flatly exclude any methods of critical analysis which examine assumptions, style or formal arrangements of a text, nor those which illuminate how McCarthy’s characters offer cascades of insight for how to examine philosophical themes of ethical deliberation, cognitive salience, the question of evil, linguistic communication, or the status of law and order. I will engage with some of these questions. I am merely suggesting that there is something more, something deeper, occurring in McCarthy’s work too. As a thinker, McCarthy is concerned with the health of the totality of phenomena in the cosmos. While admittedly the totality and status of all existing phenomena is a broad remit, it is nonetheless, in the end, the only destination, that which all aspects of philosophy return to: what is the point, and why do things matter? If we are to ascribe to McCarthy the unusual appellation of ‘literary philosopher’, it is therefore clear that this needs explanation.\n\nIntroduction 3\n\nSome claim could be made on the suggestion that McCarthy is a philosophical novelist of equal stature with the great writers in the canon of philosophical novelists, such as Margaret Atwood, Albert Camus, Herman Hesse, Ursula Le Guin, Toni Morrison, Thomas Pynchon and Jean-Paul Sartre. However, to classify writers in this way would be to miss something essential. My point is rather that McCarthy, as a writer, transcends disciplinary boundaries. While McCarthy is an extraordinary master of literary style and form, this is simply not sufficient if we are to appreciate the historical destiny which McCarthy announces in his writing for humanity. The status of literature for McCarthy exceeds mechanical aesthetic considerations. This is to say, McCarthy’s concerns with status and fate, life and death, clearly indicate that his work is not simply about subjective interpretations or examinations of the stature of works of literature. To the degree to which McCarthy dextrously adopts the mechanics of literary art such as style, form, character development and setting, this always simultaneously happens within a grander metaphysical style, pressing towards the status and nature of reality itself. Thus, McCarthy’s individual literary works are not reducible merely to questions of textual meaning, genre and narrative. These issues may certainly be explored; however, to understand McCarthy fully, it is necessary to attempt to transcend such classificatory constraints. Thus the crucial significance of McCarthy’s writing must, as McCarthy recommends himself, confront the most pressing and urgent questions of our age. So to take McCarthy’s cue, that literature is a question of life and death, must itself be bracketed. Ultimately, however curious we are, it matters little what McCarthy himself thinks or intends, nor what his biographical details reveal about his political views, interests and literary opinions. Nor, for that matter, does our own subjective reception and interpretation of his texts ultimately matter. Instead, the power of McCarthy’s writing itself is marked by brutal intransigence and resistance. McCarthy’s writing has a life of its own. His distinct accomplishment is to elevate his literature beyond bare formal considerations, letting language reveal both the long and short history of the fate of an unfolding humanity and the things which matter to it. Therefore, I will claim that McCarthy is a literary philosopher, rather than, say, solely a literary writer or a philosopher, as we might understand those terms in the conventional sense. If McCarthy is a writer who impresses on his readers the fate of humanity, and the decisive stakes of humanity’s past, present and future, then it is therefore necessary to fill out this picture. The argument of this study is thus that McCarthy holds a consistent\n\n4 Cormac McCarthy, Philosophy and the Physics of the Damned\n\nphilosophical orientation across the span of his literary output. My general aim is to explain how McCarthy’s literature (novels, plays, screenplays, philosophical essays and unpublished archive material) offers a ‘tragic ontology’. This tragic ontology refers to the titular ‘physics of the damned’ of this work. When using the term ‘physics’ I am not deploying it in its conventional usage, to describe a discipline of the material sciences. Instead, I am using the term in accordance with its roots in Ancient Greek philosophy, where physis is reality itself. Ordinarily this term is translated into English as ‘nature’, but it has a much richer resonance than we might associate with a normal understanding of nature as the domain of inquiry referring to the biological phenomena of the material world, or in the sense of phenomena which are designated as belonging to the elements of the natural world, such as trees, flowers, animals, rivers and mountains. Physis in its Ancient Greek rendering is a term that is simultaneously philosophical, scientific and religious, and therefore is an apt expression for conveying what I am attributing to the literaryphilosophical dimension of McCarthy’s writing and thinking. I argue that McCarthy offers a distinct blend of the spiritual and the material. That such ‘physics’ is ‘damned’ also takes its instruction from Ancient Greek philosophy. To say, as we conventionally do, that nature is a specific phenomenon relating to material and biological processes, would be to draw a stringent demarcation between thought and reality. Reality is effectively all that is the case, governed as it is by immutable laws. However, attributing ‘law’ to ‘nature’ would not really make sense for the Ancient Greeks as this would require the imposition of human constructs on nature. Strictly speaking, there cannot be laws of nature, since laws refer to the organisation of human communities as related to issues of sovereignty and obedience. Nature itself has no laws, nor indeed any requirement to obey such laws. To be specific, the ‘damned’ refers to physis as a domain of lawlessness affecting the human community. It is strictly not a question of salvation and redemption. Rather, my claim is that McCarthy, through his literary philosophy, or his literature as a form of thinking, aims to reveal how that domain of lawlessness affects, conditions and contests human communities. More practically, this study aims to elucidate how McCarthy articulates a consistent philosophical perspective pivoting on philosophical themes of mortality, the political, nihilism, materialism and language. Tracing these themes from the publication of his earliest novels to his most recent philosophical essays, it is my contention that McCarthy offers a unique synthesis of spiritual, political, ethical\n\nIntroduction 5\n\nand materialist concerns, the understanding of which is essential for coming to terms with the stakes of his literature. Insofar as McCarthy may be labelled a master of the English-language novel generally, and American fiction more precisely, this always occurs with respect to broader philosophical questions which McCarthy himself raises. In order to pursue this literary-philosophical line of inquiry further, I will draw on literary-minded philosophers – Plato, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jacques Derrida, Maurice Blanchot – to argue that McCarthy operates conceptually, stylistically and formally at the intersection of philosophy and literature. This will in turn allow me to argue as to how McCarthy blends the ‘material’ and the ‘metaphysical’ throughout his work. While in strict philosophical terms materialism and metaphysics are not normally held to be natural allies, this synthesis is precisely what I argue makes McCarthy’s work compelling, and in turn what makes it a critical exemplar of literary philosophy. By offering a nuanced appreciation of this singular mixture of materialism and metaphysics, I will be able to describe how McCarthy’s broader philosophical ontology plays out regarding questions of literary form, mortality, ethics, language and politics, arguing that it tackles the urgent and relevant questions of our age such as technology, the fate of politics, the environment, and the very possibility of language and community. There has recently been a definitive burgeoning interest in the philosophical dimensions of McCarthy’s work. While there are some books and journal articles which deal with how McCarthy deploys philosophy in his literature, these tend to remain isolated to specific issues and themes. Chris Eagle’s edited collection Philosophical Approaches to Cormac McCarthy: Beyond Reckoning (2017) provides a variety of contributions which explore the role of philosophy in the works of McCarthy from a variety of perspectives. In the main, however, existing theoretical scholarship on McCarthy tends to focus on theological, juridical, naturalist and postmodern readings of his work, or otherwise focuses on specific philosophers. To this end, I argue in this book that what distinguishes McCarthy’s work is a uniting of his novels and other outputs with key philosophical tropes from materialism, aesthetics, environmental ethics and existential philosophy. My aim is to show how McCarthy offers a specific ‘physics of the damned’, sowing consistent philosophical insights into the finite nature of human experience throughout his oeuvre. By examining his recent foray into the philosophy of language in Nautilus (2017), and through the incorporation of archival material, I aim to offer a distinctive account of how McCarthy views\n\n6 Cormac McCarthy, Philosophy and the Physics of the Damned\n\nthe intersection of language, metaphysics, materialism and science which is untheorised hitherto. Though there are some extended scholarly works examining the role of philosophy in McCarthy’s writing, there are currently none that articulate the centrality of materialism, language and ethics in McCarthy’s work in the way I attend to here. Most significantly, Ty Hawkins, Petra Mundik and Julius Greve offer important, valuable and insightful elaborations of the philosophical and spiritual import of McCarthy’s work. Ty Hawkins’s short treatise Cormac McCarthy’s Philosophy offers an attempt to render clear just exactly what McCarthy’s philosophy is. Hawkins argues that McCarthy is an actual philosopher, asserting that his work holds insights for questions of metaphysics, ethics, epistemology and narrative.3 While Hawkins’s basic thesis is brilliantly audacious and his insights on ethical subjectivity will inform my own work, I would have respectfully to disagree with the guiding spirit of his overall position. The philosophical inflection of McCarthy’s work does not equate with a systematic philosophy. McCarthy, in the novels which constitute the majority of his writing, does not write in a philosophical way; he does not construct and compose his prose in defence of arguments, nor is his work explicitly organised around the construction of systematic treatises concerning the different branches of philosophy such as metaphysics, ethics, metaethics, logic, aesthetics and politics. When he does write in a direct philosophical register, as he did in his essay ‘The Kekulé Problem’, as well as its rejoinder in Nautilus (2017), these are exceptional cases, and cannot be assumed to be representative of the entirety of McCarthy’s corpus even if, as I will show in this book, the latter essay is singularly useful for understanding McCarthy’s philosophical concerns. In addition, the prose of this essay is still infused with enough of an enigmatic and poetic quality to be able to situate it within a literary-philosophical tradition of philosophical writing, rather than as a purely analytic philosophical piece. Of course, philosophy is not necessarily restricted to written communication; it has a longstanding tradition of oral and dialogical thinking. On this point, Hawkins’s claim has much more purchase, especially when examining questions of narrative and dialogue. Still, in Whales and Men, where it should be noted McCarthy most extensively adopts philosophical dialogue, across the span of the various drafts, it is distinctly the case that philosophical dialogue is often removed between first and final drafts.4 To say categorically that McCarthy is not a philosopher, though, does not mean that we ought\n\nIntroduction 7\n\nnot to attempt to investigate how he deploys both philosophy and literature in order to offer a unique contribution to literary philosophy. The other most significant appraisals of McCarthy’s philosophical writing come from Petra Mundik and Julius Greve. Mundik’s A Bloody and Barbarous God: The Metaphysics of Cormac McCarthy (2016) explores theological themes in the work of McCarthy. Whereas much of Mundik’s book foregrounds important connections between the mystical, esoteric and gnostic tropes in McCarthy’s literature, my book will deviate from Mundik’s overall conclusion, which argues for the importance of religion to McCarthy’s work. Instead, I propose that while a spiritual reading of McCarthy is important – and Mundik provides a brilliant exposition of this line of enquiry – it is only one dimension of McCarthy’s writing. For a full philosophical understanding of all McCarthy’s literature, it is vital also to account for the ethical, materialist, linguistic, evolutionary and scientific elements when reading his oeuvre. Greve, for his part, offers a very important, imaginative and innovative analysis of McCarthy’s theory of nature. Greve’s analysis is restricted to reading McCarthy through the philosophical tradition of German Idealism and its legacy. In his Shreds of Matter: Cormac McCarthy and the Concept of Nature (2018), Greve makes special reference to the work of Friedrich W. J. Schelling, Lorenz Oken and debates pertaining to contemporary speculative realism. Largely, I find little to disagree with in Greve’s thesis concerning the status of nature, nor with his guiding intuition that there is a philosophical kernel, navigating a path between science and philosophy, in evidence in McCarthy’s understanding of nature across the span of his work.5 The conceptual focus of my work does, however, differ from Greve’s interpretation in a number of respects. By focusing on McCarthy as a literary philosopher, I aim to consolidate Greve’s analysis, especially by focusing on questions of ethics, language, nihilism, politics and evolutionary theory, and more generally by examining how McCarthy is more aligned with philosophers – Nietzsche, Derrida, Blanchot – who emerged in the twentieth century, in the wake of nineteenth-century German Idealism. In terms of what I am attempting to accomplish in this book, I will argue that what distinguishes McCarthy’s work is the uniting of his novels and other outputs with key philosophical tropes from materialism, aesthetics, ethics and existential philosophy. This involves showcasing how McCarthy, through the depictions of his characters and their physical, geographical and evolutionary setting, illuminates the finite and transient nature of human existence. I will\n\n8 Cormac McCarthy, Philosophy and the Physics of the Damned\n\ndemonstrate how McCarthy renders his characters at once archaic, mythic and contemporary in their efforts to transcend the predicament of existing in a physical universe. This is a necessary object of study because no philosophical novelist illuminates the tensions between humans as a frail sense-making animal and their participation in the long arc of the physical universe with such dramatic force as McCarthy. What underlines McCarthy’s unique contribution to the philosophical novel generally, and to American literature particularly, are the ways in which he depicts how moral psychology emerges as a struggle against, and with, the reproduction of life in a material and physical universe. Thus, I will make the case that McCarthy is one of literature’s ‘great unifiers’, uniting science and spiritualism, matter and spirit, nature and culture, as well as the ethical, literary and philosophical spheres. To accomplish my goal, this book is organised into seven chapters. Therein I engage in an in-depth investigation of McCarthy’s most philosophically pertinent texts, concentrating on key representative texts taken from his earlier, middle and later periods. Most extensively, I will be drawing on the following texts: Suttree, the unpublished screenplay Whales and Men, Blood Meridian, The Road, The Sunset Limited, No Country for Old Men and ‘The Kekulé Problem’.’ I will also draw on other significant texts to consolidate my argument such as The Orchard Keeper, Outer Dark, Child of God, The Stonemason and The Border Trilogy. I will also incorporate detailed archival research which I have carried out at the Wittliff Collections at Texas State University, where the ‘Cormac McCarthy Papers’ are housed. In this way, I aim to offer as complete a philosophical account of all of McCarthy’s work as possible. In Chapter 1, ‘Older than Language: Cormac McCarthy on Language and Evolution in Whales and Men and “The Kekulé Problem”’, I begin by showing how McCarthy brings different disciplines into dialogue with each other. Specifically, the chapter develops McCarthy’s philosophical enquiries into the relationship between language, evolution, science and the unconscious. The importance of this chapter rests on the fact that there has not until now been a thoroughgoing analysis in this vein. This, therefore, will be the first piece of research to articulate McCarthy’s philosophical approach to language. Building on McCarthy’s archival materials, specifically the screenplay Whales and Men, his recent essay in the popular science magazine Nautilus and its rejoinder, as well as the literary works themselves, I argue that McCarthy conceives of language, evolution and the unconscious philosophically. This chapter is necessary\n\nIntroduction 9\n\nto offer a distinct account of how McCarthy deploys philosophy. Particularly, regarding language, I assert that McCarthy attempts to subvert any easy distinction between thought and reality by showing how language acts as a mediator between the short and long history of human communication. Chapter 2, ‘Literature and Death: Suttree, McCarthy and Blanchot’, will build on the analysis in the preceding chapter on language to begin to explore how McCarthy understands language as literature. This chapter also uses Maurice Blanchot’s theory of literature as an interpretive tool to excavate how McCarthy’s work operates in both philosophical and literary registers. Blanchot explains that literary meaning emerges from a resistance to generic classification. I expand upon Blanchot’s position to offer an account of the ways in which McCarthy adopts a similar strategy. Pinpointing Suttree as the culmination of McCarthy’s early Appalachian period, I argue that McCarthy’s writing to this point, and Suttree especially, makes apparent the structure of his ontology and ethics through the novel’s execution of both form and content. Indeed, here I will show that McCarthy’s literature performs a metaphysical evacuation of form and content to broach questions of philosophical significance. We will thus begin to see how McCarthy, in his writings, is a thinker who consistently reveals the significance of philosophy for the practice of literature, illuminating in turn what literature unveils for philosophy. Chapter 3, ‘Spirits in Cinderland: Blood Meridian’s Nietzsche’, will argue that to understand the philosophical vision of McCarthy further, it is imperative to examine his most violent work, Blood Meridian. If McCarthy’s literature can be said to have an ethical perspective then it is necessary to tackle his literature precisely where it appears to be most nihilistic and cynical. This chapter shows that Blood Meridian can be understood as offering a cogent representation of Nietzsche’s accounts of active and passive nihilism. This analysis further enables me to outline how McCarthy conceives of the relationship between metaphysics, the natural world and ethics. If nihilism implies a repudiation of philosophy, metaphysics, knowledge and ethics, then I argue that we can detect clear evidence of how McCarthy offers a glimpse of how we can extricate ourselves from the predicament that Blood Meridian’s depiction of metaphysical collapse and amorality stages. The upshot of this reading is that it will provide a direct and nuanced response to Vereen Bell’s farreaching insight on the ambiguous nihilism of McCarthy in Bell’s landmark studies ‘The Ambiguous Nihilism of Cormac McCarthy’ (1983) and The Achievement of Cormac McCarthy (1988).6\n\n10 Cormac McCarthy, Philosophy and the Physics of the Damned\n\nIn Chapter 4, ‘In the Shadow of the Forms: The Sunset Limited as Educational Encounter’, I will turn my attention to McCarthy’s dramatic work The Sunset Limited. This is essential to my overall thesis as the play provides a nominally polar opposition between two distinct philosophical traditions. The Sunset Limited is therefore important for understanding the philosophical dimension of McCarthy’s oeuvre, since the play demonstrates his distinctive literary strategy of viewing humans as placed between spiritualism and materialism, matter and meaning, despair and hope. The play’s two central protagonists (Black and White) represent opposing forces of the theological and religious, the rational and materialist. This chapter argues that the apparent educational asymmetry of the two characters in fact reveals a more profound solidarity, albeit a solidarity tragically forsaken in the work itself. Furthermore, I scrutinise the ways in which The Sunset Limited adopts Platonic themes. While I argue that McCarthy falls short of a full-throated Platonism, I do find evidence in the text of how both characters educate each other beyond competing and antagonistic opinions. Chapter 5, ‘Anti-Matters: Mortal Ethics in The Road’, consolidates the analysis of the preceding chapter by showing how McCarthy’s synthesis of scientific and metaphysical themes has direct philosophical consequences for his understanding of the ethical relations between humans. My argument in this chapter is that there is an unambiguous material ethics on display in The Road. While McCarthy is not offering a naïve materialist reductionism, there is a sense that human endeavour is caught up in the wider material processes of the world. In a direct reversal of a theological cosmos, the characters of the novel participate in the broader material dissolution of the universe. The consequences of this weird metaphysics allow us to grasp more clearly the philosophical, ethical and political imaginary of The Road. This is particularly evident in relation to questions of structure, memory and a suspicion of community. The chapter concludes by explaining how The Road depicts a radical difference between those entrenched in cults and communities and those who are refugees, those without borders, those without walls. Having established McCarthy’s distinct mortal ethics, it is necessary to expand on this insight to offer a fuller account of his understanding of ethical deliberation, by examining No Country for Old Men. In Chapter 6, ‘Saving Sheriff Bell: Derrida, McCarthy and the Opening of Mercantile Ethics in No Country for Old Men’, I argue that rather than adopting the common strategy of viewing McCarthy’s novel as a paean to a lost conservatism, there is a subtler philosophical\n\nIntroduction 11\n\nreading available. Utilising Derrida’s account of ethics and responsibility, I argue that McCarthy offers a very rich account of ethical deliberation. On the surface the novel presents a putative conservative ethics, where Sheriff Bell laments the current state of social laws and yearns for the simplicity of natural justice. However, I contend that the moral fulcrum of the novel dwells in the deepening wisdom of Bell in the face of Chigurh’s mechanisation and naturalisation of ethics. In Chapter 7, ‘A Maelstrom of Doing and Undoing: McCarthy’s Political Imaginary’, I will extend my analysis of the ethical sphere to examine the political inflection of McCarthy’s writing. This chapter provides a summative account of themes developed throughout this book. I will begin by responding to the work of David Holloway and Dianne C. Luce, alongside a discussion of McCarthy’s The Orchard Keeper and The Stonemason. Concentrating on political philosophy, I argue that the best way to understand the political implications of McCarthy’s literature is by situating his work as a response to Alexis de Tocqueville’s Democracy in America. If McCarthy is one of literature’s ‘great unifiers’, uniting science and spiritualism, matter and spirit, nature and culture, then I argue that this tendency is replicated in the political sphere. The political dimension of McCarthy’s work can be understood as an effort to unite order and chaos, civility and anarchy, character and fate, and thus also the strained relations between the ruler, the ruled and the misruled. As mentioned, the realm of nature and reality itself is lawless in and of itself. It will therefore be important to understand how such lawlessness inflects McCarthy’s political aesthetic. Thus, I will conclude this work by illuminating the anarchic dimension of McCarthy’s oeuvre. While I do not think that McCarthy offers a philosophical or political theory about a feasible and workable anarchism, I will suggest that to understand the political imaginary of McCarthy’s writing it is crucial to comprehend the vibrant anarchistic spirit animating his work, which has hitherto been critically unacknowledged. One of McCarthy’s most incisive interpreters, Steven Frye, in his introductory essay to The Cambridge Companion to Cormac McCarthy, situates McCarthy somewhere between Nietzsche and Plato. Frye follows Luce’s suggestion in Reading the World: Cormac McCarthy’s Tennessee Period that the presence of philosophy in McCarthy is drawn directly from the various myths found in Plato’s dialogues.7 Frye also suggests that a necessary supplement to Luce’s reading is Nietzsche’s suspicion of philosophies that venerate a transcendent idealism. I think this is broadly right. McCarthy, as a writer, takes seriously Nietzsche’s dictum ‘God is dead’. As with Nietzsche,\n\n12 Cormac McCarthy, Philosophy and the Physics of the Damned\n\nMcCarthy, as thinker, writer, philosopher, is not making some spurious or simplistic atheistic claim about the existence or non-existence of God. He is merely asking, where can we go from here?\n\nNotes 1. Richard Rorty, ‘The Contingency of Language’, London Review of Books, 17 April 1986, 2.

Beginning with McCarthy’s most explicit philosophical engagements will enable me to sharply clarify the philosophical register of his work. If McCarthy’s writing attempts to draw different disciplines together, this impetus is clearest in his understanding of language, where we see him writing in a philosophical, literary and scientific manner. Working through McCarthy’s unpublished screenplay Whales and Men, his novels, and ‘The Kekulé Problem’ itself, I will argue that a longstanding concern of McCarthy’s is his effort to reconcile scientific, philosophical and literary discourse. More specifically, this chapter argues that McCarthy conceives of humans as retaining unconscious evolutionary forms alongside an explicit sense-making capacity. This position further enables McCarthy to develop a unique literary-philosophical discourse within his fiction and non-fiction. While McCarthy is widely renowned for his novels, screenplays and dramas, his work is of enduring interest to philosophers. As mentioned in my Introduction, there has been a variety of interpretations of his fiction ranging across existentialism, post-structuralism, theology, ecocriticism and psychoanalysis.2 However, there is no extended analysis of McCarthy’s philosophical observations on the relation between language, evolutionary science and the unconscious. This,\n\n14 Cormac McCarthy, Philosophy and the Physics of the Damned\n\ntherefore, is the first piece of research to articulate McCarthy’s philosophical approach to language. Building on McCarthy’s archive materials, specifically the screenplay Whales and Men, and his recent essay in the popular science magazine Nautilus and its rejoinder, as well as the literary works themselves, I examine herein how McCarthy conceives of language, evolution and the unconscious philosophically.3 Broadly, this research provides a novel method for integrating scientific insights with literary themes as a form of literary philosophy. By ‘literary philosophy’ I mean the way McCarthy writes in a distinctive register, stylistically and formally incorporating insights from evolutionary biology, metaphysics, philosophy and literature. Literary Darwinism, as advocated by Joseph Carroll and Dennis Dutton, might be considered an obvious precursor here.4 The argument that art and literature may solely be understood as an evolutionary phenomenon is a truism; evolution produced the human species, which in turn produced literature. However, this approach is too general for my purposes, serving only to level differences between science, linguistics and literary convention. I will use McCarthy’s example to demonstrate how an author can deploy philosophy in order to negotiate discourse that emerges from scientific knowledge, psychology, ethics and literary conventions without eliminating the respective differences of each discipline. McCarthy’s longstanding interest in science, evolutionary theory and linguistic acquisition provides a template to articulate a unique synthesis of literary and philosophical tropes. I will focus here on one example of McCarthy’s effort to unite literature and science, regarding the intersection of language and evolutionary theory. More specifically, this chapter demonstrates the philosophical significance of McCarthy’s reflections on language and science, making explicit his theorisation of humans as a nexus of both unconscious evolutionary forms and a distinctive sense-making capacity. This position enables McCarthy to develop a unique literary-philosophical discourse for illuminating his fiction as well as non-fiction. This analysis will therefore provide critical insights for unlocking the overall philosophical vision which informs McCarthy’s literary work, as well as permitting me to argue that he offers a distinctive philosophical register for conjoining literature and science.\n\nWhales and Men and language beyond thought One of McCarthy’s most sustained engagements with language, evolution and science is found in the unpublished and unproduced\n\nOlder than Language 15\n\nscreenplay Whales and Men. This is a ponderous screenplay set in Florida, the West of Ireland, Sri Lanka and the United Kingdom. The chief protagonists are marine biologist Guy Schuler, the Irish aristocrat and adventurer Peter Gregory, a wealthy former medical student called John Western and his soon-to-be ex-girlfriend Kelly McAmon. A minor character called Eric also features in the drafts. The action follows scientists and environmental activists aboard the Farfetched and the Albion who study and explore the life of whales. Beginning with Guy euthanising seventeen beached whales, the plot proceeds with a short trip on which the characters swim with and observe whales, then proceeds to a longer research voyage where they witness a massacre of a pod of whales, apart from a baby whale which Schuler is also forced to euthanise. Kelly develops a spiritual and emotional bond with this baby whale. The narrative concludes with a maiden speech by Peter addressed to the House of Lords, exhorting fellow politicians to save the whales. Throughout the piece, characters engage in long philosophical ruminations on scientific and metaphysical questions. Stylistically, the text is closer to a philosophical dialogue than a conventional screenplay. Platonic dialogues are the obvious comparison, although with its long discussions of purpose, cause and design, David Hume’s Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion is perhaps a more obvious philosophical forerunner of Whales and Men. As with all dialogue-driven narratives, characters’ opinions and perspectives do not necessarily coincide with the author’s viewpoint. However, the characters’ collective concerns indicate McCarthy’s views of the philosophical problems he was working through at this point of his career. Generally, characters are motivated by the physical and metaphysical wellbeing of whales. Their discussions refer to two key themes pertinent to this analysis. Firstly, the characters offer critical observations on the metaphysical consequences of humans acquiring language. Secondly, they discuss the limitations and benefits of scientific knowledge and evolutionary biology. Regarding language, there is an overt prelapsarianism in evidence in Whales and Men. Language, description and scientific explanation are secondary phenomena aberrating from an original reality. At one point, in an earlier draft, Peter evokes Genesis, suggesting that the human acquisition of knowledge is inherently corrupting: ‘There was no evil in the world until man sought knowledge.’5 In a pencilled marginal comment, McCarthy has Peter suggesting that humans are the evil serpent from the Biblical story: ‘We were the serpent. The bible is right. Evil is a man-made creation like argyle socks and\n\n16 Cormac McCarthy, Philosophy and the Physics of the Damned\n\nhydroelectric dams.’6 A direct equivalence is thus drawn between the world as it is and the derivative nature of language: Nomenclature is the very soul of secondhandedness. Everything that is named is set at one remove from itself. We endow all of creation with names and then carry the names away. We carry them off and file them away and stand watch over them. We experience nothing. Just names. The vicarious in possession of ersatz.7\n\nSimilar sentiments echo across McCarthy’s fictional work. In Suttree, when Suttree and his friends realise they are playing cards on a gravestone, they find the names of the deceased worn away, marking a difference between our powers of ascription and the world itself. The Road presents a world ‘shorn of its referents’.8 In The Border Trilogy, Quijada informs Billy Parham: ‘The world has no name. The names of the cerros and the sierras and the deserts exist only on maps. We name them [so] that we do not lose our way.’9 In The Border Trilogy’s epilogue, Billy meets a traveller who distinguishes between language as narrative and a deeper form of knowing where there are: ‘no idioms but only the act of knowing and it is this we share in dreams and out’.10 The consequence of having an advanced vocabulary is that humans exist in a fallen state. We use language as a tool for making sense of the world, but such sense-making abilities alienate us from the very reality we attempt to describe. Indeed, the very act of naming objects entails a form of ontological mutilation. Assigning names to particular objects implies a segmentation of reality. Kelly, the most theologically inclined character in Whales and Men, suggests that it would be pointless for God to name himself: ‘Why would he name himself anyway? To distinguish himself from what?’11 If God is another name for ‘oneness’, then oneness cannot be circumscribed by particular names, since particularity by definition indicates demarcation. According to McCarthy, language has further malign consequences. If language entails classifying, demarcating or fragmenting, then by necessity we are preordained to undermine the unity of reality. In other words, our urge to attach words to objects means we are inherently destructive. Such existential pessimism is essential to the moral force of the screenplay. The characters come to comprehend that since language is inherently destructive, the impending ecological catastrophe the characters worry over is inevitable. The mutilation of the reality language performs also extends to other communicative modes. For example, we are ‘enslaved by the history we write,\n\nOlder than Language 17\n\nnot freed by it’.12 Our desire to write, archive and record our expression divorces us even further from the world: ‘We live in our own archives. Not even among bones but among measurements of bones. A few sketches. Comments. Speculations.’ Elsewhere, ‘Then life is an illusion. Articulation masks the facts of the inner mechanism.’13 Even our use of symbolism does not escape the pernicious consequences of having language. Peter sees all modes of communication as the primary factors alienating us from the world. Language literally imprisons us, obstructing our way to deeper understanding: ‘I began to see all symbolic enterprise as alienation. Every monument a false idol. Language has conditioned us to substitute our own creations for those of the world. To replace the genuine with the ersatz. The living with the dead.’ For the jaded aristocrat Peter, effectively we turn the Garden of Eden into a ‘detention center’.14 There are three obvious points to draw from Whales and Men regarding how McCarthy philosophically conceives of language. Firstly, language is a human invention. It is a tool we use for making sense of the world, a tool peculiar to humans.15 This is a claim McCarthy repeats later in ‘The Kekulé Problem’. Secondly, language works as a system of signs. Signs imply reference to an object; however, the signs we use become so successful at substituting for the things themselves that we fail to notice they are an abstraction. We take the sign for the thing: What gradually became apparent to me was that language was a thing corrupted by its own success. What had begun as a system for identifying and organizing the phenomena that make up the world had become a system for replacing those phenomena. Language was like the evil aliens in the horror movie that take on the forms of things and gradually replace them altogether. They look like the thing but they are not the thing. Language usurps things.16\n\nThirdly, a tragic by-product of our use of language is the impetus it provides for hubris and domination. For Peter, language is a way of: ‘containing the world. Everything named becomes that named thing. It can never be something else.’17 The misanthropic Peter sees such hubristic desire as self-defeating: ‘We always knew that our desire to be God would finish us off.’18 We are dual creatures, beings alienated from the primordial unity of reality but complete with the desire to use our sense-making faculties to control and dominate that reality. Our desire to name the world obscures the very thing we are describing, because: ‘the name is not the thing’.19 John goes\n\n18 Cormac McCarthy, Philosophy and the Physics of the Damned\n\nso far as to suggest that only a complete negation of expression will restrict humans’ destructive tendencies: ‘nothing will stop us only silence itself’.20 The general misanthropy of Peter does not go unchallenged, however. Most obviously, Kelly offers a bulwark against the more cynical Peter’s reflections on language. Kelly’s character represents a purported oneness of reality. She is the screenplay’s avatar of a unified cosmos. Her attention to the nature of ‘creation’ and the future – she wants children, and has them by the end of the plot; she saves a lion cub from auction to send it to a nature reserve –­ offers an ethical alternative to Peter’s cynicism. By endorsing the existence of a unified underlying reality, she also gives voice to the fundamental connection between different species which exists prior to the veil language draws over the world: I see your and I see my hand. (She reaches out and puts their hands outstretched alongside each other) and I see that the similarities are so much greater than the differences that I know there is a connection there that no separation in time or space can invalidate or void. I know that you are at least my brother and at another level which is harder to reach but no less real I know that you are me. Not figuratively. Not a metaphor. For real. In the flesh. It’s an understanding that has nothing to do with problem solving. It’s an act of pure cognition. It’s an event. I guess what I think is that Yes I believe in God but I dont know how he is. I dont know what his name is.21\n\nKelly’s act of pure cognition, or intuition, is superior to the problemsolving nature of linguistic cognition. Julius Greve also confirms McCarthy’s strategy of adopting intuitions from a non- or prelinguistic realm outside of language as central to his poetics.22 We see direct evidence of this poetics in Whales and Men’s Kelly. For Kelly, we are owned by something other than us. Kelly represents a pantheistic stance in which reality is identical to divinity. The pantheistic cannot be located, since reality is ubiquitous and precludes location to a single point.23 Even if Kelly prophetically glimpses a more fundamental reality, this does not exclude her scepticism of language. Kelly offers her own sceptical take on language. Language individuates humans, deluding us with a sense of ownership and possession. A non-distinguished world is therefore also a moral good for Kelly, since it manifests the fundamental commonality we share with the world and other species. An absolute environmental cataclysm is presaged throughout Whales and Men. McCarthy will return to the aftermath of such an\n\nOlder than Language 19\n\nevent in the more pessimistic text The Road. The screenplay, however, offers clearer alternatives for how humans might respond to looming catastrophe. Despite the impending ecological collapse, Whales and Men offers concrete meaningful alternatives to the inexorable deterioration sparked by human impact on nature. McCarthy uses Kelly’s tentative mysticism to mitigate the dominant negativity of Peter’s nihilistic and gloomy musings, an opposition more decisively articulated in McCarthy’s drama The Sunset Limited. We also find a softening of outright pessimism in other characters. By the end of the screenplay the different characters adopt different approaches to achieving meaning and coherence, to combat the metaphysical and cosmological nihilism precipitated by the wanton slaughter of the whaling industry. If nihilism is essentially destructive, then the characters engage in creative tasks to combat the cosmological emptiness that resides at the heart of the screenplay. All the central characters engage in projects of renewal thanks to their encounter with the whales. Schuler continues to seek meaning through working with whales and through his activism. Kelly ends up marrying Peter, symbolically uniting their philosophical perspectives of life and death, creation and destruction. As Stacey Peebles notes: ‘Kelly’s visceral understanding of one-as-another is made material by the end of the story, when she is pregnant with her and Peter’s second child.’24 John ends up working in a hospital in a developing country near a war zone. He enters a caring profession and is last witnessed caring for the future by providing medical aid to a young girl. At one point, McCarthy has John writing to Kelly informing her of his redemptive longing which, even if dwarfed by the reality of evil, demonstrates his belief in the human capacity for renewal: ‘I know that we are lost but I no longer believe that we are doomed. That which we are lost to still exists and if there is a way out then there is a way back . . . I take back what I said about destiny.’25 Even the relentlessly cynical Peter turns to parliamentary politics to make a positive political intervention on behalf of the whales. The evidence for the more redeeming side of Cormac McCarthy’s work is on display in Whales and Men. This is also evident regarding questions of language and meaning. While language is largely considered a malevolent force, it is also the device through which characters gain an enlightened perspective on the deeper web of connections which bind humans with the physical and biological spheres. As mentioned, Whales and Men is closer to a philosophical dialogue than a workable screenplay, and it is dialogue which helps an ersatz community of interlocuters gain an obscure glimpse of humans’ deeper kinship with metaphysical and scientific conceptions of reality. This is what Peebles calls the ‘ties that bind humans and ecological sys-\n\n20 Cormac McCarthy, Philosophy and the Physics of the Damned\n\ntems together’.26 Writing in another context, Greve describes McCarthy’s binding impetus as the ‘entanglement of bios and logos’.27 In McCarthy’s screenplay we also find a unique meld of the Platonic and the scientific, of the metaphysical and the discourse of knowledge. Language is at a remove from reality, its function is instrumental, used for copying, mechanising, archiving and replicating. However, to suggest McCarthy endorses an outright Platonism would be to miss the point. The screenplay does not come down on the side of either Platonic ideas or the empirical world. Instead, McCarthy articulates a synthesis of both modes. This is especially evident in how McCarthy approaches scientific language in Whales and Men. On the surface, logical and objective disciplines are not exempt from McCarthy’s suspicion of the negative consequences enabled by language use. Mathematics is taken as just another form of linguistic symbolism. Eric echoes physicist Richard Feynman’s depiction of pure mathematics as an abstraction from the real world.28 He suggests: ‘I just think that things like mathematical equations only really exist in people’s heads. I don’t think the world knows anything about mathematics.’29 Equally, scientific discourse itself is taken as an elaborate form of language. There is a disjunct between our scientific description of the world and the world itself: ‘Eric is right. These laws we attribute to everything are our ideas. The way the world works is the way it works. It’s not a law.’30 Scientific nomenclature is limited to ostension only. What scientific discourse refers to can only ever approximate reality, rather than be reality itself. There is a further doubtful note struck on the limitations of scientific discourse: ‘I think science has a real problem in recognising its own shortcomings. No discipline has ever explained the world. To imagine that one can is the greatest superstition of all.31 The critique that science and religion are closer than either proposes is extended to evolutionary biology: Darwinism explains the mechanism of an elaborate system . . . It is a belief system, ultimately. Its adherents tend to militancy. They brook no contradiction. Their theory is unprovable in principle. You cant rewind the universe and run it over again. Scientific proofs are reproducible proofs, that’s what make them science isnt it? Darwinism dismisses the captain and puts the stoker at the helm. The conjugations of chance that it demands to fill in its schedule beggar belief. In the end it explains nothing but itself.32\n\nThus, McCarthy sees the scientific discipline of evolutionary biology as engendering the differentiating function of language.\n\nOlder than Language 21\n\nEvolution works through a specialisation of species, providing competitive advantage within different environments. The more complex and specialised our species become, the more difficult it becomes to discern commonality among ourselves and the world. Guy suggests: If you look at the history of species there seems to be no selective advantage to intelligence. Maybe for individuals, but not for the species. It’s the microbes who have largely ignored selection for three and a half billion years that remain with us and probably will remain when we are gone. They seem almost immortal. The process of evolution seems to be about specialization and adaptation and yet these are the very things that seem to mitigate against survival itself.33\n\nWhile intelligence and, as we have seen, language, have an evolutionary function at an individual problem-solving level, this is not necessarily the case at a collective species level. Hence the comparison with microbes. Microbes have less intelligence but are more resilient in adapting for survival. Microbial life is unburdened of the specialisation and differentiation which language has implanted in humans. The tragedy of human existence resides in our inability to bring together unity and division. The one and the many is one of the oldest philosophical oppositions in the Western philosophical canon, and McCarthy in Whales and Men sees the enduring value of this most primordial of paradoxes. When John asks the empirically minded Schuler about whether he believes in God, he says: ‘No. Larger questions again. I dont think that the world is made up of things. I dont think it’s that simple.’34 The trouble resides in our inability to reconcile the whole and the part.35 Humans are tragically trapped between oppositional traits: our ability to differentiate, demarcate and categorise and our desire to apprehend the unified, the common and the whole. It should be noted that McCarthy is not devaluing scientific activity.36 Evolution itself is not rejected. While the characters do question the potential of scientific exploration becoming hubristic, notwithstanding Peter, the characters of Whales and Men are resigned to the reality of the evolutionary status of human development. However, our desire to classify biological processes through evolutionary theory, rather than evolution per se, occludes our capacity to see the world in a coherent way. The specific by-products of evolutionary development, such as language and intelligence, dim our ability to discern our common heritage with other species. At one point,\n\n22 Cormac McCarthy, Philosophy and the Physics of the Damned\n\nSchuler recalls the debunked scientific theory that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, which suggests evolutionary stages are repeated in the gestation of foetuses. It is clearly not the case that McCarthy is endorsing a pseudo-theory – this is immediately pointed out in the script – but instead it is clear he is evoking how our current linguistic capacities and intelligence hold a muted kinship with the ancient evolutionary processes that continue to inform our current identity: And that was what I saw. A blue whale fetus. Curled up in a glass vial. Holding its hands out. I had an uncanny sense that we were somehow included in the whale’s history. That we were what the whale could have been.37\n\nMcCarthy holds an essentially tragic view of the universe and our place in it; the human is flawed due to the inevitable oscillation between the one and the many, the whole and the part, species and individual and system and component. For McCarthy, the tragedy of our existential status is that we lose sight of the common: The world we possess and cherish is not the world of possibility but the world accomplished. Because it is the sum of our memories we believe it to be communal in nature. Yet there is nothing more particular. Commonality is precisely what is lost. The past on the other hand does not exist at large.38\n\nSimilarly: ‘The future on the other hand because it is problematic and unexpressed is generic and impartial. The future is an equal opportunity employer. It is the same for all.’39 The point of McCarthy’s observations is to show how the human’s individual sense-making capacity, particularly as manifested in evolutionary explanation, does not make us exceptional creatures. Conventionally, human dexterity with language implies our intelligence and superiority over other species. McCarthy rejects this view in Whales and Men. Language is precisely the very thing which makes us less intelligent, confining us to a determined past which we in turn take to be all that there is, unable to glimpse beyond the world we name. It is language which predetermines us with the lesser and more self-destructive traits of our evolutionary nature. As argued above, there is a redeeming dimension to Whales and Men. Their encounters with whales prompt the characters to revitalise their activities, and the screenplay ends with them reaffirming\n\nOlder than Language 23\n\na pact with the future. Whales are taken as exemplars of a superior type of vocalisation and communication, one not individual but informed by a more generic communal longing. John reflects: ‘But the pain of one whale is the pain of all. A thousand miles across the sea the outraged blood and nerve and muscle convey their agony unchecked. And that is the meaning of their community.’40 A yearning of the personal and idiosyncratic for the common and whole underpins the literary-philosophical concerns of Whales and Men. Furthermore, biology and meaning exist in mutually complicated ways. The status of our evolutionary heritage engenders us with a drive for survival and destruction, caught between past and future, creation and dissolution. The traces of memory, language, history and our long past particularise us. They are written, so to speak. The future on the other hand is open, contingent and where we might potentially find a common destiny with the world and its species. The eponymous whales of the screenplay provide us with hints of how we can be otherwise. Peter suggests other places we may find similar counsel: ‘It seemed reasonable that there might still be hints of such a dialogue in dreams or in clairvoyance or ESP and that was why we dismissed such things. Even simple moments of peace.’41 Peter’s endorsement of pseudo-science is given a more plausible formulation when McCarthy examines language, science and the unconscious over twenty years later in the ‘The Kekulé Problem’. There we find language still as a secondary function, but in this essay, it is the unconscious which enables us to fuse metaphysical and scientific depictions of reality.\n\n‘The Kekulé Problem’ McCarthy’s most direct intervention on the nature of language and evolutionary science came in his recent popular science Nautilus article ‘The Kekulé Problem’. McCarthy writes in an explicitly philosophical and scientific register to examine a variety of themes pertaining to the operation of human language and the unconscious. What bonds Whales and Men and ‘The Kekulé Problem’ is McCarthy’s concern to show both the limitations and possibilities of the evolution of human language. Like the extended speeches in Whales and Men, ‘The Kekulé Problem’ is speculative in tone. The essay deals with the limitations of language, conscious and unconscious modes of expression, myth, signalling and the role of evolution. McCarthy’s underpinning observation in ‘The Kekulé Problem’ is that the unconscious is not a\n\n24 Cormac McCarthy, Philosophy and the Physics of the Damned\n\nlinguistic phenomenon. McCarthy argues that the ‘unconscious is a biological operative and language is not’.42 In itself, this is not a startlingly original point. We see varieties of this observation in a host of disciplines and sub-disciplines. For example, in phenomenology, the unconscious is not directly accessible to reflective awareness. Here we can recall Jean-Paul Sartre’s general scepticism of psychoanalysis.43 Psychoanalysis generally considers the unconscious as pre-linguistic, with its methodological emphasis on drives and desires. Behaviourism would see the unconscious as a by-product of instincts. Classical philosophical approaches to language configure the unconscious as comprising dispositions and inclinations. For example, Aristotle would classify ‘unthinking’ dispositions as second nature (hexis).44 Empirical accounts of the unconscious would distinguish between data received from the senses and their formation in consciousness.45 What then does McCarthy bring to the table? McCarthy begins ‘The Kekulé Problem’ discussing the myth of the ouroboros. When the chemist Kekulé dreamed of the mythical snake swallowing its own tail, he took the dream image as a eureka solution to a problem he was struggling with in molecular chemistry. McCarthy asks rhetorically why the unconscious did not just tell Kekulé directly that he was looking for a ring structure. The unconscious ‘spoke’ pictorially, via image rather than speech. Such unconscious thinking, McCarthy reasons, implies a gap between the unconscious and our interior monologue. The unconscious can be obstinately silent for McCarthy, presenting us with symbols, pictures and myths rather than words. For McCarthy, ‘the actual process of thinking – in any discipline – is largely an unconscious affair’.46 Language, as we have seen in Whales and Men, is considered as a form of differentiation, describing the plethora of objects we experience in the world. On the other hand, the unconscious ties us to biological processes which we are not reflectively privy to, but which necessarily inform our thinking. What we do with words and our immediate reflective language cannot be the foundational origin of meaning. What, then, does language do? For McCarthy, ‘language can be used to sum up some point at which one has arrived – a sort of mile post’.47 If all animals are waiting for language, the rapidity of the acquisition and transmission of language in humans is unique. For example, McCarthy draws a clear distinction between ‘signalling’ and language. Signalling in animals is considered less sophisticated. Even among more sophisticated animals such as bees, chipmunks and some birds, signalling remains restricted to survival behaviours such as warning of nearby predators. For humans, language does have an additional\n\nOlder than Language 25\n\ncomponent of substitution, or: ‘that one thing can be another thing’.48 Our signs make explicit things to which they refer. Any instance of language – speech acts, a linguistic thought, a phrase – substitutes for something else picking out a situation. Our sense-making linguistic activities therefore remain tied to the immediate world. For McCarthy, the ‘way in which the reality of the world becomes incorporated into our being, while poorly understood, is the salient fact of our existence’.49 Bluntly put, language makes sense of our immediate environment. Our linguistic capacity to make sense, to render explicit the exterior world, necessarily retains extra-linguistic traces of evolutionary development, because the unconscious is biological. The failure of language to make explicit deeper biological processes does not undermine the instrumental value of language. For McCarthy, the ‘invention of language was understood at once to be incredibly useful’.50 Language is simply practical: its primary function concerns naming and describing single objects in the world and thus language cannot be self-inaugurated or self-invented. McCarthy here remains an adherent to Ludwig Wittgenstein’s theory of language, where ‘meaning is use’.51 McCarthy endorses the context-laden view of language. Language is a sense-making mechanism whose primary task is picking out states of affairs in the world and rendering them meaningful as we adapt to different contexts. If language is restricted to making sense of where one is in the world, and what one does, then it is exceptionally useful in negotiating and problem-solving when confronted with the most pressing tasks of our immediate environment. There are further points which can be drawn from McCarthy’s observations here. Firstly, if language is a point at which one has arrived, a ‘mile-post’ as it were, then this means language is a transitional and differentiating phenomenon. The ways we gain sense evolve across contexts, describing different objects where advantageous. The language we use develops with the contexts we inhabit, describing and ordering the world as we find it. Consequently, if language is transitional and contextual it must, at least minimally, be malleable. Language changes and adapts, responding to whichever states of affairs are to hand. The point is that we are not generally aware of such contingency. We think language is immediately transparent to reflective awareness, picking out states of affairs in the world with precision and accuracy, but for McCarthy the sensegiving powers of language are limited to adapting to the immediate contexts of the world: ‘There is nothing else to describe.’52 Similarly, ‘Problems, in general, are often well posed in terms of language and language remains a handy tool for explaining them.’53\n\n26 Cormac McCarthy, Philosophy and the Physics of the Damned\n\nIf language is dependent on the different contexts and tasks it engages, this does not necessarily imply that the structure or form of language changes. McCarthy is decisive here: ‘There are no languages whose form is in a state of development. And their forms are all basically the same.’54 McCarthy expresses sympathy for the idea of an ‘ur-language’.55 This is the idea that all language is monogenetic, deriving from a single origin.56 While language may change with respect to idiom, accent and definitions, there remains a general structure of syntax and grammar. Despite language having a capacity to innovate, it remains limited in terms of its structural functions. As language is limited to making sense of the environments we inhabit, its focus on immediate tasks entails that language is automatically unaware of deeper instincts and patterns or how we are constituted by our evolutionary heritage. Therefore, thinking with language must be more than just language, as there is a host of other things that we do when we think. The idea that our thoughts can be reduced to linguistic utterances is a simplistic view of metacognition, one delimiting all kinds of reflective activity such as judgements, symbolic recognition, imagistic and visual thinking, as well as the evolutionary dispositions of our animal brain.\n\nThe silence of the unconscious For McCarthy, the unconscious is mostly silent, even resistant to language, imperceptible and non-verbal, impervious to the babble of interior life. With characteristic bleakness McCarthy suggests the unconscious draws on a: ‘pool of we-know-not-what’.57 He argues, ‘The truth is that there is a process here to which we have no access. It is a mystery opaque to total blackness.’58 This begs the question, how is it possible to talk of something immune to expression? When it comes to articulating what precisely the unconscious is, drawing upon McCarthy is not particularly clarifying. He notes that the unconscious knows a great deal. It has a diversity of functions, from the automatic regulation of breathing or scratching an itch, to solving mathematical problems; it may even be solemn or frivolous.59 That the unconscious is resistant to expression, however, is a positive for McCarthy. The silence of the unconscious has an operative function. The way McCarthy speculates about this is interesting. The unconscious is no doubt there to augment survival, existing alongside the sense-making capacity of language. That the unconscious is recalcitrant to expression injects a degree of contingency into our awareness.\n\nOlder than Language 27\n\nSuch contingency serves to ensure we are not absolutely determined by how language responds to our immediate environment. There is something uniquely human about how the human unconscious works, even if we do share an animal brain with our evolutionary ancestors. It is the conjunction between our invention of language and our own peculiar evolutionary development which characterises being human for McCarthy. McCarthy is keen to draw a sharp distinction between language as something unique to humans and how it operates for other creatures: ‘The other five thousand plus mammals among us do fine without it. But useful?’60 Distinctively, McCarthy sees the unconscious as a ‘benign’ agent guiding our thinking. The silence of the unconscious has a quasi-pedagogical function, imparting the ‘moral compulsion to educate us’.61 Language gets on with the immediate and pressing tasks of describing our world in all its diversity and nuance, while the more elliptical unconscious connects us, even haphazardly, to our broader evolutionary ancestry. Drawing on the repository of ‘we-know-not-what’ is valuable, since it means we are not strictly chained only to the pressing tasks of brute survival with which language occupies itself. We can unconsciously draw on a reservoir of myth, foundational narratives, symbols, biological instincts, patterns of struggle, fables and images which can provide us with wisdom, even if only if dimly so. It is because the unconscious is silent that it aids us in our struggles for survival. Where, then, does McCarthy stand on the relation between the unconscious and our conscious use of language? Firstly, even if McCarthy is acknowledging the relevance of a reservoir of evolutionary dispositions, his position precludes a basic empiricist account of the self. If the unconscious is a by-product of five million years of hominid adaptation, then it is not possible for our minds to be tabula rasa, as a behaviourist might conceive. As McCarthy resolutely suggests: ‘It is not true of course that we are born blank slates.’62 Equally, he is not working with a dualistic notion of the mind, where the mind would be an immaterial cognitive process distinct from our material bodies. Both approaches are exempt from the inherited traits of our evolutionary past. As McCarthy cautions: ‘You have to be careful about inviting Descartes to the table.’63 What is left is a view of self that operates between conscious linguistic awareness and dense repositories of evolutionary dispositions and tendencies. This is not an easy alliance. As with the protagonists of Whales and Men, we are stuck between the general and the specific, in this case between our animal brain and the linguistic capacities of individual reflective awareness.\n\n28 Cormac McCarthy, Philosophy and the Physics of the Damned\n\nTo make sense of McCarthy’s account of the unconscious, it is necessary to comprehend that our immediate awareness of the world is inflected with a deep repository of multitudinous iterations of evolutionary struggles. If the unconscious is a biological imperative then the way it manifests itself cannot be through language, but only in conjunction with the forms and traces of a long evolutionary past. Hence McCarthy takes the unconscious as having the ‘moral compulsion to educate us’.64 The ‘wisdom’ of the vast millennia of our mortal survival is functional; however, the unconscious presents this wisdom to us in elliptical and symbolic ways. As evolution requires deep time, and our animal brain retains millennia of information about how we have survived in the past, the unconscious works by testifying, prodding and nudging us through trial and error. It serves as McCarthy’s evolutionary version of a guardian angel, as it were. While the unconscious is biological, it also paradoxically directs us to transform our biological life. The unconscious is necessary for connecting us to a deep repository of survival patterns, patterns which in turn help us to transcend pressing material challenges. This is where the analogy of a benign unconscious stops. If the unconscious must resist expression, remaining opaque to sense-making, then it can only offer guidance in contingent and elliptical ways, offering thoughts, images, patterns, tests and trials to help humans transcend the immediate task of survival. As McCarthy suggests: ‘The unconscious wants to give guidance to your life in general but it doesnt care what toothpaste you use.’65 The path, the unconscious suggests, is broad but ‘it doesnt include going over a cliff’.66\n\nEvolutionary language In Whales and Men there is guarded scepticism about evolutionary theory. In the ‘The Kekulé Problem’ McCarthy still does retain some scepticism about evolutionary accounts of language. Language, for McCarthy, is not subject to selection pressures: ‘There is little evidence for selection in the shaping of language.’67 While this view would be challenged by evolutionary linguists, it does hold some sense on a long evolutionary timeline.68 Language is a relatively recent acquisition on an evolutionary timescale and the ways it is used must be preceded by a mass of evolutionary adaptation. As McCarthy suggests: The difference between the history of a virus and that of language is that the virus has arrived by way of Darwinian selection and language has\n\nOlder than Language 29 not. The virus comes nicely machined. Offer it up. Turn it slightly. Push it in. Click. Nice fit. But the scrap heap will be found to contain any number of viruses that did not fit.69\n\nAs with the characters in Whales and Men, McCarthy is not criticising evolutionary processes per se, but specifically evolutionary accounts of language that limit language to mechanical function and immediate use. He does not disavow the evolutionary formation of human identity, but instead tries to explain how our evolutionary lineage relates to the acquisition and use of language. Despite the acquisition of language, the unconscious is ‘mindless’ by definition. Daniel Dennett’s book Darwin’s Dangerous Idea is relevant here. For Dennett, life emerges from non-living matter.70 Consequently, irrespective of how complex our language becomes, irrespective of how sophisticated our intentional sense-making processes are, they are still rooted in the mindless repetition of evolutionary trial and error. Hence, McCarthy’s characters in Whales and Men come to accept that life is neither exceptional nor unique and is premised on how the organisation of matter allows genetic variation to take hold through mindless trial and error over the course of millions of years. Such organisation does not disqualify variation. In fact, the variation of traits is essential to allowing different species to evolve. If this variation were not the case, replication would merely clone parental information and evolution could not occur. These processes must remain obscure to linguistic articulation. It is the outcome of generations of biological mindlessness where McCarthy sees humans struggling to cope, caught between animal life and a desire to transcend it. If the unconscious is not linguistic for McCarthy, it can still complement linguistic awareness. Past evolutionary activity is retained through the unconscious, which presents itself through a variety of thoughts, pictures, symbols, images and judgements, drawing comparisons between the practical tasks that language concerns itself with and the ‘lessons’ of our evolutionary past. Since the ‘unconscious is a biological operative’, the functioning of the unconscious must be evolutionary, serving the transmission of biological life.71 If language arrived in our brain at some point in our evolutionary history, then McCarthy suggests that the brain ‘was not expecting it and had made no plans for its arrival. It simply invaded those areas of the brain that were the least dedicated.’72 If the unconscious is subject to evolutionary imperatives, then the brain is necessarily constrained by our evolutionary history. The brain is certainly a multi-functional organ and yet this does not imply that the brain can do anything.\n\n30 Cormac McCarthy, Philosophy and the Physics of the Damned\n\nWhile the ‘virus’ of language can change and mutate in innumerable ways, our brain is limited by the sedimented history of millions of years of hominid adaptations. These adaptations are the fruit of evolutionary trial and error, consisting of innumerable dispositions that aid ours and our ancestors’ reproductive success. What makes humans distinctive is the ability for language to change and adapt, yes, but additionally, to transcend selection pressures necessitated by local atmospheric, climatic, natural and geographical conditions. This point is crucial for understanding McCarthy’s philosophical disposition. He sees the human being as historical, operating at the intersection of biological striving, as repository of informational memory as well as cultural and linguistic development oriented towards the future. Therefore, what characterises the unconscious is its automatic persistence and a machinic urge to survive. Our evolutionary past is a necessary but not sufficient condition for thinking. It is necessary that evolutionary variation takes place to make us what we are, but this is not enough to explain how we act and make sense of the world. The unconscious speaks to the fundamental and generic parts of our biological status. It is consequently less interested in the specifics of subjective sense-making but instead works cryptically, offering hints and some orientation as we are confronted with the inevitable and objective project of mortal survival. Our lived existence therefore requires meaningful factuality in tension with the harsh reality of evolutionary struggle. Language helps us cope with the wild revolutions we experience by naming and controlling; evolution also connects us to deeper reservoirs of accident, survival and endurance. Therefore, McCarthy’s account of language and the unconscious helps unlock the central themes of his work, namely his persistent preoccupation with the tension between that which endures and that which changes. In literary terms, it is worth remembering that McCarthy is drawn to elemental tropes. He frequently draws on elemental myths, instincts, image and symbol and the way they exist alongside, and direct, moral and psychological thinking. This enables his prose and drama to depict with some acuity the conflicts of sense-making, depicting fraught moral psychologies alongside the archaic and elemental. For example, at the end of No Country for Old Men Sheriff Bell ruminates on a stone trough, taking it as a symbol of both endurance and change. At the conclusion of The Road, McCarthy uses fire as a symbol of promise and continuity in a bleak and hollow universe. In Child of God, McCarthy uses the forest as a backdrop for Lester Ballard’s psychological deterioration. In Blood Meridian, a mythological violence\n\nOlder than Language 31\n\npermeates the novel. The function of these mythic tropes is to bring into relief McCarthy’s broader concern, which is to depict human psychology as continuous with a struggle against – and with – the reproduction of life in a material and physical universe. McCarthy’s characters persist despite and alongside the Darwinian world they inhabit; they are frequently tragic, subjects of endurance and transformation, attempting to transcend the predicament of existing in a physical universe.\n\nConclusion The best way to comprehend McCarthy’s non-fiction is to view humans as beings who retain unconscious evolutionary patterns and are also explicit sense-making animals. Beginning with Whales and Men and proceeding to ‘The Kekulé Problem’, I have argued that what is distinctive about McCarthy’s writing is his willingness to wed philosophical and literary insights in his own unique form of literary philosophy. In his non-fiction, McCarthy’s authorial voice drifts between that of a detached scientist, poet, linguist and metaphysician. His work combines the opaque and mysterious with the mechanical. McCarthy’s intervention in evolution and cognitive linguistics is productive for understanding his literary output. The synthesis of evolutionary survival and linguistic comprehension which McCarthy proposes renders intelligible the recurrent themes of his fictional work: specifically, the finite and transient nature of human existence operating against a backdrop of deeper and longer patterns of evolutionary time. The contrast between frail sense-making animals and the deep well of survival instincts engenders the dramatic power of his novels. Humans are precarious, frail, otiose, engaged in persistent sense-making despite the sometimes inscrutable physical and biological processes of the universe. The long arc of the physical universe, as well as evolutionary and geological time, makes his characters at once archaic, mythic and contemporary. McCarthy retains the spirit of a naturalist, albeit a very unusual one, one who adopts a critical distance from the naturalism which he deems necessary for understanding our place in evolutionary history. McCarthy is not a naïve reductionist in his outlook on language. Language is a practical tool for coping with the vagaries of the world. Alongside language, the unconscious reveals mysterious and profound insights about our struggle for biological survival which are not readily apparent. For McCarthy, the silence of the unconscious is an absence at the core of\n\n32 Cormac McCarthy, Philosophy and the Physics of the Damned\n\nall speech. No linguistic speech pattern is only itself and such patterns remain dependent on the traces of prior evolutionary struggle. If we can cooperate with our unconscious, insofar as what it recommends works, then it can help us connect to universal, generic and primal human experience. Language is our disposition for making sense of our historical dwelling and exists alongside, and through, an overcoming of our basic biological imperatives. McCarthy’s writings on language contain some hopefulness despite his usual pessimism. We are evolutionary beings, but we also retain an evolutionary capacity to be wise as we survive. Such evolutionary wisdom might come to lead us away from the abyss we find in The Road. While I have outlined here how McCarthy brings literary, scientific and philosophical styles together, it is now necessary to account for how McCarthy’s understanding of our linguistic nature informs language as literature.\n\nNotes 1.

Interestingly, in a typed fragment in later drafts of Whales and Men, McCarthy engages with pantheistic sentiments regarding the impossibility of localising mathematical points. Within a pantheistic framework, reality cannot be localised to particular points: ‘Nothing exists in itself.

But this precise language is not precise in any sense if you deal with real objects of the world . . .’ See Richard Feynman, ‘New Textbook for the “New” Mathematics’, Engineering and Science 38, no.6 (1965): 14. It is no accident that this theme also appears in drafts of Whales and Men, given McCarthy’s longstanding interest in science and mathematics.

In the DVD extras of The Unbelievers documentary, McCarthy broadly defends the importance of science: ‘People who like science are all drawn to it for the same reason. It explains the physical world.

But if it’s not the last word it is at least the best word.’ See The Unbelievers, DVD, directed by Gus Holwerda (London: Revelation Films, 2014). 37. McCarthy, WM, Box 97:1.

Neuro-scientists often demarcate between information included and excluded in consciousness. For example, David Marr in Vision (San Francisco: Freeman, 1982) argues there is a host of neuro-computational processes which take place unconsciously between when light photons affect our retinas and the attendant construction of visual images in consciousness. Björn Merker argues that the biological origin of consciousness is linked to evolutionary use. Consciousness provides a stable locale for organising action in the world, but this excludes the sensory and sensorimotor data we experience.

This means that there is a mysterious silence at the core of all speech. This muteness may emerge from evolutionary struggles, residual mythological thought-patterns or primal experiences. This silence is the key to understanding.1 Thus, to appreciate the literary-philosophical dimension of McCarthy’s writing, it is necessary to explain how his reflections on language feed into language as literature. McCarthy uses the ‘unconscious’ as shorthand for ‘mystery’ or ‘silence’, as such silence accompanies all the things we do not immediately say, know or comprehend first-hand. It also informs any activities in which humans engage. However, we need to exercise some caution too; this form of poetic silence should not be considered as either bafflement or mystification. To consider it so would amount to saying that the silence that McCarthy acknowledges is comprehensible or may easily be explained away, or that it has a supernatural origin elsewhere. Instead, I will argue that the silence is kept live; our ability to understand the world in linguistic terms is accompanied by an inability to see deeper truths and therefore McCarthy is a distinctly literary-philosophical writer, since the origin and limits of what we know remain intimate with what we do not know. To understand how McCarthy’s literature uses the poetic, the lyrical and the philosophical, it is necessary to examine how his work combines our desire to understand the world linguistically in tandem with a deep dialogue with the mute, the silent and the unspoken. The best place to do this, I submit, is in McCarthy’s Suttree. McCarthy’s Suttree is an epic anti-novel, engulfing the reader in a tide of nihilistic deterioration, unconfronted death, teeming negation, loneliness and disenfranchised effluvial life.2 The power of negation\n\n38 Cormac McCarthy, Philosophy and the Physics of the Damned\n\nand the function of death have a unique place in this novel. Suttree, the novel’s anti-hero, confronts his own death as well as a more expansive cosmic negativity at the heart of all things. The novel itself stages a confrontation between silence, the unconscious and a mysterious emptiness which hums alongside all human action. For the purposes of explaining the literary-philosophical register of Suttree I will turn to the literary philosophy of Maurice Blanchot. I will argue that Blanchot’s reflections on literature equip us to articulate an original philosophical interpretation of McCarthy. I am not particularly concerned with elucidating how Suttree as a literary text represents specific philosophical themes. It is more productive to consider Suttree less as a text that offers a catalogue of philosophical themes, where we can elucidate philosophical theme ‘x’ and ‘y’, but instead as a form of writing which enacts philosophical questions in a hybrid of literature and philosophy. More specifically, I will argue that McCarthy’s writing in general – and Suttree in particular – makes apparent the structure of ontology and ethics in its execution of both form and content. In this sense McCarthy, in his literature, is a thinker who consistently reveals the significance of philosophy for the practice of literature, and in turn illuminates what literature unveils for philosophy. While much commentary on Suttree and on the McCarthy oeuvre in general places the novel in the context of existential individualism and alienation, I will argue that a more nuanced and philosophical reading of this text is possible through utilising Blanchot’s concepts. Examining the proximity of Blanchot and McCarthy offers a hitherto untapped resource for understanding the philosophical implications of McCarthy’s fiction, as well as providing a new way to think about his work. The philosophical force of the novel emerges from the very unworking of American idealism and individualism, as will become evident through the novel’s presentation of the persistent evacuation of Suttree’s subject"
