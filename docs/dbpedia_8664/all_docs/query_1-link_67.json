        "text": "We decided (mostly on the back of not being sent review copies, it should be said) to give Cormac McCarthy’s last two books a little time to settle. Coming, as we probably all know, 16 years after The Road – which did very well for itself, considering it was such a dark, dark book – both The Passenger and Stella Maris received something of a mauling (although The Passenger’s Wiki page says that it was reviewed broadly favourably – we must have been reading different reviews), which led to us finally approaching these books, shall we say, with trepidation. The paperback release seems as good a time as any to finally dive in, however. To begin with, let’s talk order. The Passenger was published first, originally, and Stella Maris followed. I’m aware of people who have read these books the other way around – and as time passes, it’s possible they will be read as standalone books by people who don’t know any better, so that has to be considered too – but we read them the way McCarthy intended – Passenger first, Stella Maris second. It’s also worth saying, finally, before we dive in, that McCarthy obviously died within months of publication so the view changes – these are no longer McCarthy’s latest books, they are his last books (unless there is something posthumous to be revealed at a later date).\n\nOk. The Passenger. Started, according to varying sources in either the 70s or the 80s. What we have here is, ostensibly, the story of Bobby Western and his sister Alicia. We meet Alicia first and her italicised instalments open every chapter except the last one. To begin with, and thanks to Alicia, it’s a little disorienting. Alicia, we learn, is subject to hallucinations – hallucinations that are essentially (and to begin with) a sort of ringmaster called the Thalidomide Kid (who irritatingly talks a little bit like Ned Flander’s dad) and a coterie of acts. Alicia we come to learn is something of a maths whiz and also a schizophrenic. The Alicia sections tend to be, for the most part, a back and forth between her and the Kid that surf the wave of her growing acclimatisation to the presence of these hallucinations, which recur whenever she ditches her medication.\n\nWhere the Alicia sections skip blithely through the years, the Bobby sections are a little more linear. When we meet him, Bobby is a deep sea diver on a salvage crew. Over the course of the book we come to learn that he was also a bright spark, that he gave up on his education and became a race car driver and that he has since sort of bummed around. We learn relatively early on that Alicia is no longer with us. This is the source of the abiding grief that drives some of the action of the novel. On the deep dive that opens the book, there is a private jet, 40 feet beneath the water, with a small group of dead bodies aboard. Bobby and his mate Oiler don’t like it and leave. This is the mystery that drives some of the action of the novel.\n\nNow, you may have noticed two similar sentences there. Consider those the broad narrative arcs of the book – the way in which the mystery impacts upon Bobby’s life and the way in which his grief for his late sister dominates mostly everything he does. As the book wanders, as Bobby spends time in bars drinking with friends, or visiting his grandma, or taking jobs on abandoned oil rigs, or talking about quantum physics or the Kennedy assassination, those two narrative arcs come and go like the small wooden figures that appear when a Swiss cuckoo clock rings the hour. It probably doesn’t need saying (given that we could probably assume a knowledge of No Country for Old Men if you read The Passenger) but if you come here expecting a neat mystery that resolves itself, you are going to be disappointed.\n\n“I hate shit like this, he said.\n\nWhat, bodies?\n\nWell. That too. But no. Shit that makes no sense. That you can’t make sense out of.”\n\nBut that isn’t to say that the mystery is a red herring as some reviewers have (although it is fair to say that The Passenger is a mystery in the way that The Counsellor is a mystery, in that it’s dysfunctional and refuses to even acknowledge genre expectations). Bobby and his buddy Oiler suspect someone was on the jet before they were (the avionics board is missing, the pilot’s flightbag) even though there is no obvious way they could’ve been. Later, Bobby is visited by a couple of Government sorts who think he knows more than he lets on. Bobby also makes a tour of the neighbouring islands and finds some footsteps that he thinks might have been the mystery passenger who escaped the plane. Some other people come looking for Bobby (and Bobby suspects they represent a different party from the first visitors). He talks to a lawyer called Kline who tells him he is on the run, already, before he is on the run, that he is arrested already, before he has been arrested. In time, his bank accounts are frozen and his car is impounded and he is warned about using his passport. He’s caught up in something but he doesn’t know what it is and neither do we. There’s a sense in which the mystery only matters as a way of propelling the tragic figure that Bobby Western cuts along his path (but there’s also a sense that the mystery recedes as Bobby engages more with the reality, if you can call it reality, of his late sister’s situation).\n\n“What you write down becomes fixed. It takes on the constraints of any tangible reality. It collapses into reality estranged from the realm of its creation. It’s a marker. A roadsign. You have stopped to get your bearings, but at a price. You’ll never know where it might have gone if you’d left it alone to go there.”\n\nThere is plenty here to like – from McCarthy’s sideswipe at the you-know-who’s:\n\n“I’ve seen hordes of families here that can best be explained as hallucinations. Hordes of drooling dolts lurching through the streets. Their inane gibbering. And of course no folly so deranged or pernicious as to escape their advocacy.”\n\nTo a view of the future that, you’ll be pleased to learn, is as pessimistic as we all know McCarthy can be:\n\n“Information and survival will ultimately be the same thing. Sooner than you think.\n\nWhat else?\n\nDifficult to say. Electronic money. Sooner rather than later.\n\nOkay.\n\nThere won’t be any actual money. Just transactions. And every transaction will be a matter of record. Forever.\n\nYou don’t think people will object to this?\n\nThey’ll get used to it. The government will explain that it will help to defeat crime. Drugs. The sort of large scale international arbitrage that threatens the stability of currencies. You can make up your own list.\n\nBut anything that you buy or sell will be a matter of record.\n\nYes.\n\nA stick of gum.\n\nYes. What the government hasn’t figured on yet is that this scheme will be followed by the advent of private currencies. And shutting these down will mean the rescinding of certain parts of the Constitution.”\n\nBy the time you reach the close, you will no doubt have wrestled with all of the back and forth involved in interrogating whether quantum physics and Kennedy and Oppenheimer and the bomb is pertinent or just backdrop – and you may ask yourself (as we did) what McCarthy wants us to take away from this, as a last word. You may also wrestle, as we wrestled, with the tonal shifts between the early sections of the book and the last sections of the book (which feel very post-Road McCarthy):\n\n“In the end, she had said, there will be nothing that cannot be simulated. And this will be the final abridgement of privilege. This is the world to come. Not some other. The only alternate is the surprise in those antic shapes burned into the concrete.”\n\nAnd so to Stella Maris, a prequel to The Passenger (and so, you could say, the end of The Passenger is actually the end to both of these books but we’ll leave that one to future readers to ruminate on). We’ll address one of the big criticisms early. Wah wah wah, this isn’t a novel, it’s a screenplay, it’s just people talking, wah wah wah. To which we will say, see also: The Sunset Limited or The Orchard Keeper. But – wah wah wah – The Orchard Keeper is a play. Okay, okay, see also Kiss of the Spiderwoman – Wah, wah, wah, that isn’t a book by Cormac McCarthy. True, but it’s a novel, recognised as a novel, that is just in speech. See also Philip Roth’s Deception. Wah, wah, wah – oh shut up.\n\nThis is basically a back and forth between Alicia and her doctor. She has checked herself into Stella Maris, which is a sanatorium that she has stayed in before. A lot of the chat is about mathematicians and physicists. (You might want to familiarise yourself with Benjamin Labatut’s When We Cease to Understand the World before you read this – it will help.) In counterpoint to The Passenger, which follows Bobby after his sister has taken her life, Alicia believes Bobby to be either dead or dying (as he is lying in a coma following a car accident that she believes he won’t wake from, but we know he does wake from).\n\nAlicia is, it should be said, quite annoying. She frequently snipes at her psychiatrist for not being able to understand the lofty things that concern her. To an extent, you could say that the path she chooses in some way apes the path Grothendieck (famous mathematician who turned his back on mathematics) chose.\n\nI remember the author Colin Barrett tweeting about these books, saying there was something so frightening in one of them he had to take a turn about the garden. I wonder if the thing he found so frightening was contained in Stella Maris (a dream or vision that Alicia has about sentinels outside a Judas hole). This is what reading Stella Maris is like at times. Your mind wanders.\n\nThe Spectator said that they felt Stella Maris wasn’t worth reading (that it was a disaster); we wouldn’t go that far, although it is the lesser work of the two. It might be that it’s worth trying to intersect the two books (read Stella Maris, say, as if it was the italicised section preceding the final chapter of The Passenger, so that you end your final experience of the duology with the best writing contained in either of these books)."
