        "text": "September 27, 2016\n\nFirst you get sick. Then the headaches come. Next thing you know you can’t read for more than ten minutes without feeling a jackhammering in your head. Bing bam boom…you’re reading a fucking screenplay! Eh. How low have I sunk?\n\nBut I hear your cries. ‘Cody! Cody! What of the book? Is it fantastic? Horrible? Will you please not answer our pleas and forgive us our homonyms?’\n\nNo.\n\nJune 5, 2017\n\n3.5\n\nThis is a short screenplay but packs a harsh punch like only Cormac can deliver.\n\nAnd now my next step, obviously, is to actually see the play.\n\nAugust 10, 2013\n\nLife. Death. Fathers. Sons. Inheritance. Murder. Sin. Death. Innocence. Memory. Community. Loneliness. Money. Poverty. God. Garden. Madness. Cormac McCarthy.\n\nNovember 9, 2023\n\nEntertaining play listening 🎶🔰\n\nThis is a novella kindle e-book from the local library.\n\nI don't know what I expected but plays are not my style of listening 🎶🔰.\n\nI would recommend that you give it a try and see 👀 if it works for you. 2023\n\nThis is my first book by this author. I will have to give another book a try.\n\nJanuary 2, 2015\n\nFirst off, I love Cormac McCarthy, I absolutely love his writing. No Country For Old Men. The Road. Oh My God The Road! There may not be a better written apocalyptic father and son tale of traversing across the country after desolation and anarchy have set in. The Road is, without the zombies, what the Walking Dead tries to be.\n\nThe screenplay; The Gardner's Son captures the style and oppression of a Cormac McCarthy story. The tale of regular men, doing what they feel must be the right thing, only to have it spiral out of their grasp as they fall victims to a situation that is far bigger than themselves.\n\nCormac McCarthy wrote the screenplay for The Gardener's son in 1976 and it was broadcast on PBS that same year. It received two Emmy award nominations.\n\nThe story of two families separated by wealth and privilege in a small Southern Mill town. The McEvoys and the Greggs. Robert McEvoy, as the story begins, is having his leg amputated due to a Mill accident thought to be caused by the affluent son of the Mill owner; James Gregg. In anger and bitterness, Robert leaves town, deserting his family.\n\nUpon the death of his mother, two years later, Robert returns. He is hardened from his time on the road. He learns that his father, a once proud gardener for the Greggs no longer works in the gardens but in the darkness of the Mill. Fueled by a simmering hate for the wrongs done to his family he confronts James Gregg and shoots him dead.\n\nThe trial and punishment that follows will consume what is left of the two families and the town itself, exposing the lies and secrets of a small Southern town.\n\nWritten as a screenplay and presented as such, it may not have the full sense of drama and flow as a novel would, but in the hands of McCarthy it is conveyed very well. Cormac McCarthy has a voice in his writing that is as unique and harmonious with the written page as anything being printed today. He may very well be the voice of that dusty little underbelly of small town America that we thought long dead. But in fact breathes very well still.\n\nAfter reading this screenplay I know I will be looking for the television movie in video or streaming.\n\nA very good read.\n\nJuly 7, 2019\n\nMy favorite author, hard for me not to appreciate his first screenplay (later came The Counselor, Sunset Limited and The Stonemason, all spectacular). The story is the conflict of the impoverished migrant worker family and the up and coming owner class family. Both are sympathetic and tragic. The gardener harkens to when the original owner tolerated in good times a garden but the owners eventually put him back on the assembly line, extracting his soul and maintaining the underclass and its seething anger, manifest by the injured son. Eventually the crippled and wounded ego of the son leads him to exact his revenge, is then executed by hanging, and the tragedy ultimately destroys both families. It is a tale of loss and the transient and cyclical nature of human endeavors. A beautiful tragedy, the language of the common folk in the post civil war south is a thing of beauty. McCarthy’s ear for dialogue in this era is almost supernaturally perfect and beautiful in its simplicity and clarity of expression. I’ve got only The Road of his, which I continue to hoard like the treasure I am sure that it is.\n\np. 42, an old man recalling the sanctity of the garden in a better time: “Back years ago of a winder day if it was sunshiny I’d come out here at dinner time and take my dinner here. It would be warm in here and you could smell stuff growin. I’d get a crate and set on it and take my dinner and just set here. It was an awful pleasant place. Your Daddy would come by sometimes and see me settin in there but he’d just go on. He never would say nuthin. Then here back last fall one evenin I was makin my rounds and I thought I seen a light down here. I come in and held my lannern up and there sat your daddy. He was just a settin there in the dark. I ast him if he was alright and he said yes. Said he just wanted to get out of the house for awhile.”\n\np. 68, the black lawyer philosophizing, and showing McCarthy’s future proclivities: “If men were no more than god there’d be no peace in this world. Everwhere I look I see men trying to set right the inequities that God left them with.”\n\np. 69, more from said lawyer, yet more spleen: “They say that Go sends no man a burden greater than he can bear.” The defeated father replies “Ay. Nor much less neither.”\n\np. 91, the daughter in old age, perhaps the only one left with any residual (and piquant) memory, sums up the theme to the young supplicant in the pure country idiom that the author specializes in: “I was always a fool about flowers. I guess I take after my daddy thataway. He was a nurseryman. He had peach orchards…you never seen the likes of peaches. They used to ship em out by train. Just carloads of em. He had a touch with anything growin. Just had a sleight for it.”\n\nJuly 20, 2016\n\nThe Gardener’s Son, McCarthy’s first screenplay, was originally adapted as a teleplay (starring Ned Beatty) for the show Visions in 1977. Like much of McCarthy’s other early work, the story is Southern Gothic in tone and explores how characters on the margins of society interact with a world that seemingly has passed them by. The Gregg and McEvoy families, two groups that live on very different sides of the proverbial tracks, find themselves in an unexpected and violent conflict. McCarthy builds the intrigue by only partially explaining the conflict's sources to the reader.\n\nAlthough I did not find this as engrossing as McCarthy’s early novels, this screenplay showcases many of his literary gifts: great (if understated) dialogue, a vivid setting, and the creation of a story that seems almost timeless. It would be interesting to see how this story ultimately translated to film, as the plot can be highly reflective. As a text, this is a short and worthwhile read that will interest fans of McCarthy’s more famous work. 3.5 stars, recommended.\n\nJanuary 8, 2024\n\nAbout as morbid and poignant as you’d expect from McCarthy; worth a read to see how he writes for such a different medium. Thematically this isn’t new territory for him but it’s a quick and worthwhile read. Round up from 3.5\n\nJanuary 2, 2022\n\n4.3 stars\n\nI did not really have any expectations when I picked up The Gardener's Son this morning, but I wasn't disappointed.\n\nCormac McCarthy's haunting tale of one family's misfortune is a bloody brilliant writing.\n\nI only wished though that the screenplay was much longer than it was; if it were, I would have given it 5 stars with no issue.\n\nBook #1 of 2022\n\nAugust 12, 2021\n\nI thought....lets try a screenplay after so many years just to confirm that I should have extended the years even more.\n\nAugust 19, 2017\n\nThis is one of McCarthy's earlier works; a screenplay about the son of a gardener. Despite such a cursory glimpse at the various characters I really felt for them by the end.\n\nDecember 25, 2023\n\nThe Gardener's Son is another captivating creation by the literary genius Cormac McCarthy. As someone on a personal quest to devour everything McCarthy has ever penned, I found this screenplay to be a solid addition to his impressive body of work. While it may not have left as indelible a mark on me as some of his other masterpieces, it still holds its own.\n\nSet in the post-Civil War era, The Gardener's Son explores the complex dynamics between two families, the Greggs and the McEvoys, in a small mill town. The story focuses on Robert McEvoy, the son of the mill's gardener, who, after an accident, loses a leg. This event sets off a chain of events that deeply affects both families. The screenplay delves into themes of class conflict, family loyalty, and the harsh realities of industrialization. The narrative is folded around the mysterious circumstances leading to the murder of the mill owner's son, James Gregg, for which Robert is implicated. As the story unfolds, McCarthy masterfully unravels the intricate relationships and social tensions within the town, leading to a climactic and thought-provoking conclusion.\n\nMcCarthy's signature style, characterized by a knack for exploring the darker facets of human nature, is without a doubt present in The Gardener's Son. The narrative unfolds in a way that draws you in, and as with all of his works, it is impossible to escape the haunting atmosphere he effortlessly conjures.\n\nThe characters, as expected from McCarthy, are multifaceted, leaving room for contemplation long after the story has concluded. While I may not have been as deeply affected by them as I have been by some of his other creations, they still left an impression.\n\nIn the grand scheme of Cormac McCarthy's literary brilliance, The Gardener's Son may not shine quite as brightly, but it is still a worthwhile and engaging read. For those on a journey to explore McCarthy's entire body of work, it is an essential piece of the puzzle.\n\nApril 9, 2022\n\n'The Gardener's Son' is a screenplay by prestigious author Cormac McCarthy and it was written in the spring of 1975, later published in 1996. With a prose that is lighter than usual, McCarthy relies on the showing method as there is limited time for telling. Subtle generational warfare quietly rages as seeds of class differences are presented through scene descriptions and stage directions. Displaying a prosperous setting that comes with a cost, the tale teeters between two families whose only similarity comes with the connection of occupation. With a clear line between superior and worker and drawing from historical sources, McCarthy creates a short fuse lit by a capitalist industry and questionable human behavior. ⁣\n\n⁣\n\nThe screenplay format makes for a quick read and actually enhances McCarthy's desire to create ambiguous people and the feelings that drive them. Parallels are drawn between characters despite their financial differences, they appear as bloodless relatives; parasites merely occupying the same host. ⁣\n\n⁣\n\nWith blurred intentions and a single burst of violence, death in both a physical and spiritual form are used as motivators. The legacies of fathers are polluted by the sons as inherited responsibilities are either altered or completely rejected. Consequences lead to bloodlines reaching their final destination unannounced as the actions of men leave the women to cope with tragedy, the familial line forever disconnected.⁣\n\n⁣\n\n'The Gardener's Son' is a taut and airy revenge tale in post-Civil War South Carolina. Focusing on the communal changes that comes with the existence of a patriarchy, McCarthy always speaks with authenticity and this well constructed tale should please any reader of his. While not as philosophically enlightening as 'The Sunset Limited, the primal behavior and economic disparities ultimately makes 'The Gardener's Son' a thematically heavy read.⁣\n\nApril 10, 2017\n\nThis is a very short dramatic work; very different of course from McCarthy's novels, and different also from The Sunset Limited - being a screenplay it contains not only dialogue but extensive directions on framing and character acting. Even in this condensed and inflexible format, McCarthy manages to capture much of what makes his novel writing so great. I believe that his real skill is not only in the telling, but in knowing what to leave out: he never exposes his characters' inner lives (desires, motivations, fears), but instead lets you simply observe them and draw your own conclusions. The Gardener's Son is haunting and unsettling in that it never really explains itself. In fact, its protagonist at the critical moment is actively prevented from speaking, leaving the observers (both the reader and the other characters) to struggle for understanding. Beautifully subtle and skillful storytelling.\n\nAugust 16, 2017\n\nIt is difficult to rate a screenplay in a system designed for rating books. In a sense, it's an \"apples and oranges\"-type comparison. But McCarthy's The Gardener's Son was masterful and literary and evocative. Oh, and of course \"McCarthian.\" Powerful feelings of family and justice and vengeance. Moving images. Does not have the same depth of imagery and symbolism as some of his longer literary works, but McCarthy perfectly captures tone and dialogue and conveys perception like no one else. Less is always more with him. And the vocabulary is downright simple compared to, say, Blood Meridian. Another must-read for any die-hard McCarthy fan. Hit it!\n\nApril 26, 2023\n\nThis was fine....writing-wise, it still had that McCarthy touch, but wasn't as impactful to me as his full novels. Maybe that was due to it being a screenplay but people read Shakespeare plays, right?\n\nThe story is set in 1865 in Graniteville, SC. This is a town near where I live so the setting was very familiar to me. The old mills still stand (a few of them) and one of those mills was a setting in this screenplay (turned film in the '70s). Two families, one who runs the mill and one who works at the mill, end up at odds and both families meet with tragic circumstances.\n\nJuly 14, 2023\n\nUnfortunately, THE GARDENER’S SON is just a rehash of themes McCarthy already explored at greater length, and with more poise, in THE ORCHARD KEEPER (anti-industrialism) and OUTER DARK (gnosticism). As scholar Dianne C. Luce notes, it also borrows too heavily from Camus’s THE STRANGER. Overall, it’s probably McCarthy’s least impressive work.\n\nSeptember 21, 2018\n\n2.5 stars for me. The screenplay thing is not really working for me with this one, rather watch the movie .\n\nDecember 24, 2020\n\nRich dialogue and a smooth Southern Gothic plot lend themselves to a detailed, albeit short read. Very immersive and well worth reading!\n\nOctober 4, 2023\n\nCormac would have loved Ethel Cain.\n\nJanuary 15, 2020\n\nHonor leads you nowhere but your head emo “And you have a good life. Little sister. The best that anybody ever had in this damned world.”\n\nApril 8, 2018\n\nSubtle, maybe too subtle. If you like Cormac McCarthy's gritty, accusatory style, this is a very quick read.\n\nAugust 27, 2018\n\nTimes past are fugitive. They caint be kept in no box.\n\nI'm not ordinarily one to read screenplays, but this is an unusual case. After his first three short novels, a still relatively unknown Cormac McCarthy was headhunted by the still relatively unknown documentary filmmaker Richard Pierce to write a telemovie script.\n\nTwo years and $200,000 later, it was a two hour episode of the PBS anthology series Visions. Unfortunately it's now exceedingly difficult to come by a copy of the video in any form, although some rare dvds exist.\n\nThere's no indication that the adaptation was anything special, so where that leaves us is to contemplate the screenplay in the context of McCarthy's oeuvre without the complication of actors, producers, and the rest of that circus.\n\nThe story is a fictionalised account of a historical murder and trial in 1876 in Graniteville, South Carolina. With reliable details being sketchy, there was plenty of room for artistic licence. And as might be expected under the circumstances, the brief was very much in McCarthy's wheelhouse. Hence he produced something of a streamlined and simplified version of a novel, still indelibly stamped with his signature.\n\nIf his hauntingly bleak depictions of humanity and the South are of interest, The Gardener's Son will not disappoint, regardless of its status as something of a curio compared to his more substantial works.\n\nJanuary 4, 2016\n\n4 jan 16, #12? from mccarthy for me.\n\nfinished...same day. based on the introduction or foreword whatever it is this screenplay is...old...sounds like the movie was made some time ago won some awards this that the other. based on something that happened once upon a time in the carolinas, sound of it. i liked it...is that a three? did i really like it, a four? maybe. bare minimum here, screenplay and all, though there are some protracted (for a screenplay but what do i know) descriptions, setting/scene. could be there's enough between the lines as they say here and there for one to ponder events. not that any conclusions can be drawn but that won't stop most.\n\nread it because i like all things on the mccarthy shelf and i liked this one. onward & upward\n\nDecember 23, 2014\n\nA screenplay is not my favorite format and I find the stage directions to be distracting and stop me from forgetting it's just a story I'm reading. But I still became involved in this play and cared about the characters, which is quite an accomplishment on Mr. McCarthy's part since the book is so very short. He manages to bring emotion, characterization and suspense into this short work with just a minimum of words.\n\nIt's not the best way to start off reading Cormac McCarthy's books but if you've read his others, don't miss this little gem.\n\nJune 1, 2016\n\nMy first reading of a screenplay. I didn't like it as much as reading a play—although the formats are similar, the end purpose isn't and it shows in the writing. I was often unengaged, Martha's story could have been stronger if there was more focus on it from the get-go; instead everything is left a bit of a puzzle and it all comes together at the climax, when we realise why Bobby did what he did.\n\nSeptember 24, 2018\n\nI've only read two of Cormac McCarthy's books - The Road and The Sunset Limited - and I've already become a huge fan of his. The Road was a bleak tale of a post-apocalyptic America shot through with streaks of hope, and The Sunset Limited was one of the most deeply affecting books I've read this year. I picked up The Gardener's Son hoping that it would be another treat at CorMacdonalds\n\nIt, uh, wasn't\n\nThis flimsy volume is a screenplay that McCarthy wrote early in his writing career based on the mill enterprise of William Gregg and his sons. William Gregg and The Graniteville Manufacturing Company actually did exist in the 1800s, and the story itself was inspired by a few footnotes in William Gregg's biography. This is the story of the Robert McAvoy, an employee who quits his job at the mill and leaves town. He returns on the occasion of his mother's passing, and while he's in the neighborhood, he decides to shoot James Gregg, the current owner of the mill. Yeah, I just spoiled the ending of the book, but who cares?\n\nSeriously, I never thought I'd say 'who cares' about characters in a Cormac McCarthy book, but no one in The Gardener's Son ever says or does anything for a reason - I guess I'd have to make an exception for the doctor who amputates Robert's leg, he would totally die if the infection in his leg spread. It's a McCarthy thing for characters not to have blatant and obvious motives, but good lord, the characters in this book are just difficult to figure out. Perhaps that's because this is a screenplay and a screenwriter can assume a lot of the work of conveying a character's thoughts will be done by the actors. In fact, one really annoying thing that keeps happening in this book is that a character will say something to another character, that character will understand the implication and the reader is just left to wonder what just happened\n\nI suppose a lot of the criticisms of The Gardener's Son can be hand-waved by saying 'it's just a screenplay', but The Sunset Limited was also just a script and yet it was absolutely engaging and impossible to put down. It also had more detailed stage directions, maybe that's what was missing\n\nIn terms of content, this was actually more of a one star for me, but I've been struggling a bit to keep up with my reading challenge and this book, at 96 pages long with not a lot of words, was an easy boost, so I'll give it a point for that\n\nThis doesn't change the fact that I still believe Cormac McCarthy is one of the great novelists of our time - why should a screenplay change my opinion of his novels? That being said, there's really nothing to see here, just move along"
