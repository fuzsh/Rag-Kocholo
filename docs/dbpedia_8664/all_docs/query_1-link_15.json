        "text": "I am a fat fan of Cormac McCarthy and I had a heart attack when I found out that he is working on his next novel which follows a man in New Orleans after his sister committed suicide.\n\nI am guessing we see how he deals with it etc...\n\nbut McCarthy is THE best living author of our time and one of the best American Authors that we have had. He falls in line with heart attack Faulkner and suicide Hemingway!\n\nmy TOP 3 favorite books of Cormac are Child Of God, The Road and Outer Dark.\n\nChicago Jones said:\n\nmy TOP 3 favorite books of Cormac are Child Of God, The Road and Outer Dark.\n\nBlood Meridian, Suttree, and The Border Trilogy. If I have to choose one: All The Pretty Horses.\n\n\"Wolves cull themselves, man. What other creature could? And is the race of man not the more predacious yet? The way of the world is to bloom and flower and die but in the affairs of men there is no waning and the moon of his expressions signals the onset of night. His spirit is exhausted at the peak of its achievement. His meridian is at once his darkening and the evening of his day. He loves games? Let him play for stakes.\"\n\n--Judge Holden, Blood Meridian\n\nthe opening line from Child Of God is fantastic: They came like a caravan of carnival folk up through the swales of broomstraw and across the hill in the morning sun...\n\nthe The Road: (This opening is the reason why I read the book. I was at borders and the title got my eye and I opened it and read the first page and was blown away.)\n\nWhen he woke in the woods in the dark and the cold of the night he?d reach out to touch the child sleeping beside him. Nights dark beyond darkness and the days more gray each one than what had gone before. Like the onset of some cold glaucoma dimming away the world.\n\nI read Blood Meridian recently and have several times since the first and I wish I had read it when it was first published. Such a terrible tale so beautifully written. It strips away many veneers of so-called civilisation and opened my eyes a whole lot more.\n\nThe Judge arched his brow. Did you post witnesses? he said. To report to you on the continuing existence of those places once you'd quit them?....Where is yesterday? Where is Glanton and Brown and where is the priest? He leaned closer. Where is Shelby, whom you left to the mercies of Elias in the desert, and where is Tate whom you abandoned in the mountains? Where are the ladies, ah the fair and tender ladies with whom you danced at the governor's ball when you were a hero anointed with the blood of the enemies of the republic you'd elected to defend? And where is the fiddler and where is the dance?\n\n- the Judge\n\nroundshort said:\n\nI am always surprised how few people talk about this book. Esp. givent he amount of survey level college classes read it.\n\nIt should gain popularity due to the surge in interest in Cormac McCarthy, what with the recent film adaptations of No Country For Old Men and The Road, and of course when the film of Blood Meridian itself comes out.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, it was on TIME's list of the top 100 English-language books published between 1923 and 2005.\n\nroundshort said:\n\nI am always surprised how few people talk about this book. Esp. givent he amount of survey level college classes read it.\n\nThe short answer is that literary fiction is dead. That said, I think for a large percentage of the population, the book is nigh impenetrable. With archaic language, a dense writing style, and fast n' easy with grammar rules, a lot of people are going to have a hard time getting past the first page. It's a damn shame, too. Is there a more frightening character than Judge Holden in all American literature?\n\nAnd if you don't have a copy of John Sepich's Notes on Blood Meridian, do yourself a huge favour and pick it up. It's been out of print for years, and they finally released a new edition two(?) years ago. If you can find the essay Gravers False and True: Blood Meridian as Gnostic Tragedy it's worth a read, as is Christopher Campbell's exploration of the epilogue.\n\nLe Saboteur said:\n\nThe short answer is that literary fiction is dead.

I have been looking for something to dig a bit deeper in!\n\nLe Saboteur said:\n\nThat said, I think for a large percentage of the population, the book is nigh impenetrable.

But very rewarding.\n\nAre Cormac McCarthy's other novels as hardgoing?"
