        "meta_description": "This article proposes a reading of The Counselor (2013) as an extrapolation of the frontier ethic animating much of Cormac McCarthy’s earlier writing. I will propose that echoes of Blood Meridian (1985), which presented the duality of barbarism and capital, are audible and perpetuated under digital capitalism, a condition encompassing the expansion of increasingly impersonal and anonymized capital under neoliberal socio-economics, empowered by digital globalization. Thus, the screenplay extends classic McCarthian themes, while expanding the remit of critique to class relations in contemporary cross-border, and global consumer economies. The subversive appetites of Western consumerism—focused around commodity fetishism and narcotics—symbolized by characters like Westray, Reiner, and Malkina, render a distinctly modern tragedy enabling a critique of how (and whether) it is possible to represent and oppose such a system of increasing ephemerality and correlative persuasion.",

        "text": "2Jonathan Elmore and Rick Elmore state that No Country for Old Men (2005) posits the emergence of Homo Economicus as a “‘new’ type of human being, one frighteningly devoid of any recognizable humanity, yet one that remains reasonable, principled, and calculating” (169). Anton Chigurh in the novel is symbolic of the emergent terror such an ideology represents and visits upon populations, to the extent that he is deemed a “true and living prophet of destruction” (5) by the narrator Sheriff Tom Bell. Chigurh’s professions about potential and inevitable victims of the philosophy he represents renders the sufferers merely victims of fate and natural order, as opposed to choice or emancipatory agency. As Elmore and Elmore aver, Chigurh’s words to Carla Jean near the conclusion of the novel attest to this: “The shape is drawn. No line can be erased. I had no belief in your ability to move a coin to your bidding. How could you? A person’s path through the world seldom changes and even more seldom will it change abruptly. And the shape of your path was visible from the beginning” (No Country 259).\n\n1. Digital Capitalism, the Global Frontier Ethic, and Gothic Capital\n\n4Dan Schiller, at the turn of the millennium, set about debunking the prophetic promise that the internet, with its capacity for positive deterritorialization, would lead us to “global brotherhood” and increased democratic consensus beyond the trappings of insular nationalisms (xiii). He states that “[t]his utopian vision—Internet as salvation—expresses ancient yearnings. Historical detoxification through scientific knowledge: the truth— information?—will make us free” (xiii). His assertion that “the Internet comprises nothing less than the central production and control apparatus of an increasingly supranational market system” (xiv) is now more obvious, and as such, I argue, it facilitates a global frontier ethic McCarthy capitalizes upon in The Counselor.\n\n8The Counselor, like many of McCarthy’s protagonists, acts as a liminal figure who travels between the U.S. and Mexico. This produces two noticeable outcomes: first, it highlights the privilege of white American identity in the racialized hierarchy. One must only recall Llewelyn Moss’s repatriation in No Country for Old Men (2005) by asserting his right to pass northwards through the border because of his status as a military veteran, while the cost to others is a seemingly invisible violence—illegitimate in the eyes of the regulatory framework controlling those in transit. This naturally produces the second circumstance, that of a spectral economy at work in matters concerning production, consumption, and transit—both in terms of material entities, and the obvious allusion to the marketability of human bodies as product when the operation of transit is reversed, from South to North. When the Counselor meets Westray—initiating the double-bind of law figure and transgressor (legitimated by class discourse)—their conversation illuminates the obfuscation of commercial product value as it travels from Columbia, through Mexico, and finally across the border to Texas and further north toward Chicago. Deciding upon the mitigating factors, the Counselor asks what net value his share in the proposed narcotics deal could fetch: “Westray: Hard to put a cold dollar on it. You don’t know what your expenses are until it’s actually delivered. It’s six hundred and twenty-five kilos. Pure uncut. It sells for about fifty bucks an ounce in Columbia and the street price in Dallas can be as high as two grand” (53).\n\n9The added value of such a transaction implied here is risk, alongside a natural McCarthian theme—the violence endured in transit, reminiscent of the barbarous economy of scalps in Blood Meridian. What is of primary interest here is the prism through which such a transaction, in fiscal terms, transcends pure criminality and is washed clean in the anonymity of raw capital. Westray explains:\n\nYou’ve got the money guys. You have to get cash in dollars into Mexico and then they have to get it out again. That’s all they do. You have to use US banks. This means you have to have a corporation. And to do that you have to have someone on the inside. You’d be surprised at the people who are in this business. (54)\n\n10Suarez-Villa makes an incisive point on the shift from industrial capitalist modes of production and trade to a more ethereal digital currency by citing the commoditization of more incorporeal entities and substances: “The tangible resources of industrial capitalism, in the form of raw materials, production hardware, capital, and physical labor routines are thus replaced by intangibles” (Technocapitalism 4). The result being a further reduction in the possibility of emancipation through technology or technologization. He elaborates on the condition as such:\n\nThe dominant influence that corporatism exerts over technological agendas today, in its quest for power and profit, implicitly invalidates the purely functionalist view of technology. The culturalist view, which assumes that technology is a system unto itself from which there is no escape as society is molded and controlled by technological forces, also seems unsuited to any consideration of an emancipative role for technology. From the culturalist perspective, attempting social interventions is pointless since there is no way to oppose technological forces, except to retreat to the primitive or the metaphysical. (4)\n\n11This retreat to “the primitive” and “the metaphysical” is evocative of the bind McCarthy’s protagonists have readily found themselves in, both culturally and socially—the Border Trilogy sees urban modernity extinguish a pre-industrial, agrarian mode of life for its characters. In this reading of The Counselor, I propose that McCarthy is attuned to the conditions of twenty-first century existence that have seen corporatization advance at a ferocious pace. If Anton Chigurh can be understood as the figure of neoliberal capital in No Country for Old Men (2005), with often quiet yet merciless violence—seemingly dissolving the border structure as a backdrop of 1980s Reaganomics—then the Counselor is a logical outgrowth of the internally contradicted figure of twenty-first century Homo Economicus, though his transgressions have been banalized through the ideological dominance of the economic structure.\n\n12The protagonist is at once compelled to participate in the economy’s dark foil—which, as we have established, is not so much the opposite of a functioning marketplace for McCarthy, as its villainous co-conspirator—and also become its victim. Not only this, but Laura (soon to marry the Counselor) is rendered an expendable cost in its standard operation. She becomes an element of human capital, subsumed into a subjugating and transgressive economy the Counselor is made aware of, and is yet enthralled by. What is more, this practice appears normalized, and the connection between femicide, narcotics, and capital is articulated by Westray prior to the protagonist’s agreed participation in the central narcotic shipment, which they will manage at a remove, evoking a critique of managerial distance, and the contingency of a subordinate class. Westray explains their venture into the passage of such substances in the lexicon of entrepreneurial self-interest. The Counselor will pursue his ascent in a bourgeois social hierarchy by entering into its shared marketplace of illicit capital—which will soon fuel his socially acceptable venture (a night-club) in Texas through demand for the product in fueling middle-class leisure activities (likened to primitive hedonism), with little regard for the human cost. Westray suggests that the movement of drugs is merely a transition from more insidious practices of the recent past:\n\nWestray:… Before the so-called drug wars who do you think was killing all those young girls in Juarez?\n\nCounselor: I dont know. Nobody knows.\n\n...\n\nWestray: Come on, Counselor. Hundreds of young girls? Thousands, most likely. Follow the money. If you have so much cash that you’re using it to insulate your house and you’ve bought all the cars and clothes and guns that you can find a place to put, and you are morally depraved beyond all human recognition, what then do you spend your money on?\n\nCounselor: Why do they kill them?\n\nWestray: Who knows. For fun. Snuff films. You’ll see. Those will start turning up. (58–59)\n\n2. Neoliberalism, the Global Frontier Ethic, and the Mechanics of Post-Industrialization\n\n14Definitions of neoliberalism, neoliberal capital, and the culture stemming from it (or rather, its impact upon the cultures and identities it affects) vary, but David Harvey’s still remains foundational and constant:\n\nNeoliberalism is in the first instance a theory of political economic practices that proposes that human well-being can best be advanced by liberating individual entrepreneurial freedoms and skills within an institutional framework characterized by strong private property rights, free markets, and free trade. The role of the state is to create and preserve an institutional framework appropriate to such practices. The state has to guarantee, for example, the quality and integrity of money. It must also set up those military, defence, police, and legal structures and functions required to secure private property rights and to guarantee, by force if need be, the proper functioning of markets. Furthermore, if markets do not exist… then they must be created, by state action if necessary. (Neoliberalism 2)\n\n15In Social Justice and the City (1973), he began his critical theorization against Henri Lefebvre, who suggested that urban living could present an opportunity to live over and against the demands of capitalism. Harvey disagreed, suggesting that modern urbanity was more likely to represent the apotheosis of how capital could organize us, dictate space, and how human beings orientate themselves (socially, culturally, economically, and physically) in relation to one another. It represents the absolute centering of capital as the chief organizing principle of modern society, and is thus the means through which urbanization is brought to those who remain outside modernity. This, for Harvey, among others, presents a false promise of inclusion. Thus, when a narrative of late capitalism, or perhaps (post) postmodernity is voiced from the perspective of an entrepreneur like the Counselor, and other similarly oriented characters like Westray and Reiner, a neo-frontier ethic becomes quite visible. In fact, working from Harvey’s definition, the term “human capital” becomes something else altogether in the context of McCarthy, and extends the gruesome metaphor of Blood Meridian even further—humans become capital. Such a system of exchange value is not so much adopted, but rather imposed, specifically from one dominant culture to another, in order to fortify a neo-imperialistic stance that is more tacit in appearance, and thus seemingly more palatable. This description further clarifies Malkina’s symbolic association with the ideology outlined above.\n\n16By now, readings of McCarthy as a chronicler of industrialization are well established (Holloway and Dorson, mentioned above, for example). Craftsmanship and the implements of labor are often apparent as corollary devices that reflect an expert practitioner’s remit within an economy, but also serve as modes of violently interrupting the civilized flow of ideology. They mark a precise rupture in the process of concept-design-manufacture-sale-use-expire symbolizing a functioning, logical economy of consumption, agency, and equitable justice. The latter is a problematic entity for McCarthy, and Dorson draws upon Derrida’s concept of “originary violence” to great effect in explaining the specter of violence surrounding human commerce, regardless of its distance (temporal or otherwise) from primitive trade and law, or the lack of it.\n\n[I]t’s a mechanical device. It had this small electric motor with this rather incredible compound gear that retrieves a steel cable. Battery-driven. The cable is made out of some unholy alloy, almost impossible to cut it, and it’s in a loop, and you come up behind the guy and drop it over his head and pull the free end of the cable tight and walk away. No one ever sees you. Pulling the cable activates the motor and the noose starts to tighten and it continues to tighten until it goes to zero… Mostly wretched excess of course. It’s just that there’d be no easy way to turn the thing off. Or reason to. It just keeps running until the noose closes completely and then it self-destructs…. The wire cuts through the carotid arteries and sprays blood all over the spectators and then everybody gets to go home. (36–37)\n\n18This method of decapitation—a theme resonating through much of McCarthy’s articulation of trade from Blood Meridian onwards—is grotesque, but also notable in its advancements on previous iterations. It is, first and foremost, a fictional device—a creation of McCarthy’s, but I would argue that it symbolizes and extends the metaphor of Darwinian capitalism outwards from jingoistic westward manifest destiny into a more impersonal structure. The Counselor muses on the nomenclature briefly: “A bolo is one of those skinny neckties. Or is it one of those things you throw? Argentina” (35; my italics). After a reference to formal working attire, the association is made with a type of knife, or machete, used variously in Central and Southern America, along with Cuba—often called a cane sword when deployed in agriculture, and regularly finds a use in transgressive (violent) behavior. Dismemberment from such an implement is remarked upon elsewhere in the text (Westray’s description of snuff films), but the more brutal and dramatic violence it inflicts is symbolic of a connection to something more primordial for McCarthy here. The bolito maintains the aura of previous instruments—the axe (Child of God) and shotgun (Blood Meridian)—but stands as an implement exclusively engineered for violence. It is depersonalized, in that it does not need wielding, or mastery—moral choice of purpose is negated, and consequently the transition to an altogether more ominous industrialized modernity is completed. The tools servicing such an economy represent a sense of bleak completion, or utter domination by what Fisher called “gothic capital” (15). This proposition encompasses the paradox of efficiency, dark potentiality, and sometimes vicious teleology of liberal capitalism, with various mechanics and implements of labor doubling as tools of increasingly impersonal systemic ferocity. It is hyper-violent, with McCarthy’s description cascading into near-cartoon horror, as opposed to the more menacing precision of violence inflicted by Judge Holden or Anton Chigurh (a device for dispatching cattle with minimum suffering is evocative of such a contrast) for example. Therefore, in McCarthy’s rendering of modernity, one’s fate is very much determined by capital and one’s interaction with it (quite literally, in the case of Chigurh’s coin in No Country for Old Men).\n\n19Temporal advancement, consequently, leads his protagonists to a reality described best by Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer in their Dialectic of Enlightenment (1944)—choice is somewhat of an illusion, and the only freedom gained is “the freedom to choose what was always the same” (136). An object like the bolito, then, inspires an interpretation of its design and function, but also a moment Walter Benjamin once called a “now of recognisability” (The Arcades Project 426). Benjamin’s desire to uncover the layers of political, social, and economic obfuscation remains specifically relevant here, as McCarthy’s unusual clarity of expression regarding the implements of work (and their various uses) appears to have reached an apex. The objectivity and submission to choice is present in previous implements, such as an axe, or even an ornate shotgun—both are objects of work, commemoration, sentiment, and perhaps some vague reminiscence of manifest destiny. Their deployment as a method of destruction is at the behest of those who wield them, and arguably support an association of work with a socio-economic system of uneven progress. The bolito suggests a point in McCarthy’s output representing a now (in Benjamin’s sense of the term) of closed potentialities. The design of this machine has a more overt purpose—“It just keeps running until the noose closes completely and then it self-destructs” (37).\n\n3. Natural Law, Digital Modernity, and the Closing Potential of Moral Action\n\n20We can say without speculation that The Counselor serves to further the existing assertions of McCarthy’s conscious elucidation of neoliberal realities. It now provides the vocabulary, script, and doomed agency of a new form of determinism—protagonists and associated actors see their gambits (largely attempts to succeed in an innately exploitative ecology) fail, rendering a form of tragedy now normalized in the structure of feeling McCarthy’s literary ventures routinely exhibit. A new sense of determinism is reified and perpetuated by the standard model of Enlightenment virtue—knowledge and inquiry begets liberated individualism, often through the production of technologies that limit human labor. The bolito is disconcerting in its ability to automatically complete the task that was previously the domain of rugged individual agency (often tethered to masculinity) in the guise of Judge Holden and Anton Chigurh. The Counselor is thus unique in McCarthy’s body of work in that it explores a paradoxical lack of identifiable accountability at the heart of post-FIAT politico-economic regimes, and the use of new technologies to create this strange set of circumstances. The modern citizen is—we are led to believe—empowered or buoyed by one’s extended privilege of property rights and right to pursue self-interest, leading to an erosion of the state as a social protection provider, in favor of an entity guaranteeing rights to increased privatization. In theory, this would amount to a greater level of responsibility, but in truth, the crisis in global capitalism since 2008 has made visible the inadequacy of this philosophy on a mass scale. It is the anonymity of capital as it is empowered in terms of protection, ease of movement tied to increased digitization, and ultimately decreased socialization of the resources it portends to represent, that receives explicit attention by McCarthy here.\n\n21Malkina is symbolic of natural law which imposes a Darwinian logic upon suffering, along with social, political, and economic hierarchies among various populations. Previously, McCarthy’s texts have focused upon the interchange between North America and Mexico. The exploitative relationship, drama of uneven development, and naturalization of the kind of hierarchies legitimating such a state of affairs has provided McCarthy with an enduring motif of cross-border trade at least since the publication of Blood Meridian. The conditions of Chigurh’s brutish yet precise impositions on previously essentialist borders, however, signaled a change in the presentation of trade relations and the movement of capital in the late twentieth century under the regime of Reaganomics. I would argue that The Counselor extends this metaphor even further through an increasingly anonymized presentation of capital—that is to say, identities receive protection above and in spite of misdemeanors such resources represent—and much of this is attributed to automated and digitized conceptions of modernity. The former is represented by the bolito, and the latter is signaled by the nature of Malkina’s ultimate trade. Her conversation with a computer engineer in a “world city” lends itself to the liquidity of capital as it is represented here—Chigurh’s coin is no longer a viable metaphor, as the substance of money is now represented more properly in “machine readable code” (169). Reminiscent of Holden’s erudition concerning more ancient crafts, Malkina demonstrates superior fluidity and an almost natural lexicon in digi-commerce and information technology, dismissing VPNs and routers as insufficient to the needs of her nefarious transaction. She explains the details of a transactional interception (with Westray as victim) by way of remote digital access to her tech-savvy interlocutor: “You can have a basic toolkit with Sequel servers and whatever, but a Remote Access Trojan Horse like Zrizbi or Torig is not for keeping track of your household expenses” (170). The ultimate benefit of these means is “[i]t’s not traceable” (170).\n\n22When the topic of law enforcement enters the conversation, Malkina is quick to dismiss the possibility of accountability further:\n\nI’m not worried about that. What’s out there is out there. They think their traffic analysis is sophisticated but by definition it has to lag the protocols that generate it. As for the physical computers, you put them in the oven, set it to four-fifty and walk away. Or just pour thermite on them. I can download everything I need to take with me onto a USB stick. (172)\n\n23The culmination of her scheme sees Westray beheaded, by employing a bolito serving as an ersatz remote or automated executioner, and distraction—he is beheaded in a very public and gruesome manner, “[h]is left carotid artery bursts and bright red blood sprays in a fountain into the air and splashes back on the sidewalk” (166). It is appropriate to employ Fisher’s assertion here:\n\nTo reclaim a real political agency means first of all accepting our insertion at the level of desire in the remorseless meat-grinder of Capital. What is being disavowed in the abjection of evil and ignorance onto fantasmatic Others is our own complicity in planetary networks of oppression. What needs to be kept in mind is both that capitalism is a hyper-abstract impersonal structure and that it would be nothing without our co-operation. The most Gothic description of Capital is also the most accurate. (15)\n\n24Westray’s execution is a functional symbol of the latter in its grotesquery and spectacle, and expands the narrative metaphor of commerce that has been explored by Elmore and Elmore, and more recently by Dorson, who expresses the suitability of Benjamin’s contention that modernity is intrinsically tied to barbarism. He pays particular attention to the following passage from Blood Meridian, proposing its resonance with the cold eye of calculability employed by Holden in his dominance, and an emergent power of gothic capital: “It is this false moneyer with his gravers and burins who seeks favor with the judge and he is at contriving from cold slag brute in the crucible a face that will pass, an image that will render this residual specie current in the markets where men barter” (Blood Meridian 310).\n\n26The new and updated class politics of neoliberalism is visible, but it is not merely an attenuation to expectations of high-budget screenwriting. Rather, I suggest, The Counselor is equally deserving of what Dorson has deemed McCarthy’s propensity for the presentation of “counternarratives.” There is a duality, he suggests, to much of McCarthy’s prose that represent, parody, and critique ideological structures and associated value systems from within. The Counselor too, based on the above exploration, performs this duty, rendering a tragedy within the trappings of digital modernity—the increasingly anonymized and impersonal nature of transactions and commerce can be seen, along with an extension of the frontier ethic to a global sphere of finance capital, enabled and facilitated by the technology that has always served a dual purpose of representing wealth acquisition and brutal inhumanity. Messianic promise, however, is an equally visible and problematic theme in McCarthy’s later prose. Does such an ordering system, mirroring the frontier ethic, expansionism, subjugation, and flawed justice it evokes, present an alternative to the reader or viewer in a similar manner to the child of The Road?\n\n27In Capitalist Realism, Fisher’s celebrated articulation of the apparent dominance of neoliberal cultural logic, he asserts that “emancipatory politics must always destroy the appearance of a ‘natural order,’ must reveal what is presented as necessary and inevitable to be a mere contingency, just as it must make what was previously deemed to be impossible seem attainable” (17). This sentiment espouses a tangible alternative or method of opposition to the conditions of McCarthy’s utterance of twenty-first century global capitalism. The protagonist is a symbol of an ordering system of law, but one rendered inherently flawed, insofar as it is equated within the realm of business. The question we are left with is thus: does McCarthy’s account of a human drama under capitalist realism, ensuring the opacity of unethical human relations (mainly centered upon commodity fetishism and its spectral violence), modes of consumption (a drug trade fueled by largely middle-class desire enabled by an invisible human cost), and uneven development, allow us to envision emancipation—that is, the promise of liberation? Elmore and Elmore claim that McCarthy’s philosophy of history, somewhat postmodern in its weakening of temporal structures, represents a method of resistance:\n\nIf human nature has always been competitive, then the current neoliberal structure of society is nothing but the expression of that human nature. However, by placing the past before the present, out in front of us in the dark, the novel concludes by questioning our understanding and relationship to our own cultural, social, and anthropological history, a questioning that strikes at the very heart of neoliberalism’s claims to naturalness and inevitability. (182)\n\n29A grim premonition is exhibited by Westray—if such media depicting gratuitous violence and suffering does exist, it would serve to reflect the true ferocity endured by subaltern communities and people. Their increasingly marginalized circumstances—supported by the fact that the fate of victims is shrouded in mythology, making the reality of the situation inherently obfuscated—invite a comment upon McCarthy’s stance on representation, and how such social inadequacies and depravity are to be understood beyond the veneer of progress imbued by technologized modernity as he renders it. Hillier (2017) asserts that McCarthy’s late writing, up to and including The Counselor, veers ever closer to the genre of fable—a tale that is “didactic and fiercely moralistic” (162). The “ethical entropy” visible in these later narratives, for Hillier, invites resistance from the reader to similar conditions they endure, thus rendering McCarthy a moralist (166). My understanding of The Counselor runs contrary to this, however, in that I believe the story incites rumination on the difficulty of moral action when faced with the confounding logic of neoliberal modernity in all that it represents—a global system of commerce paradoxically extending rights of privatization while also making the currency of its worth more opaque. The “ethical entropy” Hillier correctly denotes as an identifiable characteristic lends itself, I argue, to a tragic consciousness that is actually furthered by the author’s narrativization of twenty-first century globalism. The precariousness and contingency of individuals serves to limit the grounds for and ability to imagine concrete positive moral action, and it is this conundrum that makes the fable somewhat stultified as a model of storytelling—the only relevance of it in this reading is a reminder of its troubling yet impending redundancy. The errors and difficulties of comprehending such an ephemeral system of human organization become the defining feature of the tragedies the reader/viewer bear witness to.\n\n30Above I have argued that The Counselor provides a lucid articulation of neoliberal modernity, building upon the realities theorized by Elmore and Elmore in relation to No Country for Old Men, when Homo Economicus was a protean yet nascent figure. The Counselor presents implicit, paradoxical, yet natural horrors in the everyday reality of consumer etiquette, and class-oriented status of twenty-first century urbanite experience—classing the narrative as a functional critique of liberal modernity, with added emphasis on the enabling promise of digital globalism. The tenor of McCarthy’s representation, I suggest, is best understood through the ominous permutations of Fisher’s concept of “capitalist realism.” Consequently, I propose that the appearance of digi-commerce and technocapital is a new yet timely inclusion in McCarthy’s frame of reference. Its effect is a further obfuscation of the true or real cost of a system of global capital that, as Fisher asserted, is a “hyper-abstract impersonal structure” (15). Our inability to grasp it, despite our unyielding participation in it—as though it were a feature of natural or organically occurring competition (symbolized by Malkina)—is eventually presented as a deeply problematic state of affairs. McCarthy’s narrative, I propose, does not provide any simple paths to emancipatory moral action, but rather alerts us to the continually fraught duality of modernity and barbarism. Rather than uncouple them, increasingly complex mechanisms of distraction and hedonistic habits deflect our collective recognition of its reality and our unrelenting participation—viewed through the dialectical lens of drug culture, corporatism, and mechanisms of social class creation. Accordingly, The Counselor might not be such a departure from The Road, and is similarly keen to remind the consumer of the emancipatory potentialities of more grounded, socially engaged interpersonal relationships, the kind that recede from view and are continually disrupted by the trappings of digitally empowered modernity."
