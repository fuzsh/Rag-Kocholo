        "text": "The Southern Pacific's Sunset Limited began service from New Orleans to San Francisco via Los Angeles in 1894. The train was initially all-Pullman and at various times has had termination points in Jacksonville, FL and Los Angeles. When Amtrak inherited the route in 1971, it retained tri-weely service between New Orleans and Los Angeles. Service was extended to Jacksonville, FL from 1993 until track damage by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 returned the eastern terminus to New Orleans. Hopes of returning daily service were quashed in 2010 when the Union Pacific indicated tha $750 million woud be required for infrastructure upgrades to avoid interfering with heavy freight traffic."
