        "text": "Bayous lined with moss-covered oaks and cypress trees are crossed on causeways and trestles, and here and there are the trappings of offshore oil and gas rigs. The fields around New Iberia are thick with sugar cane (celebrated in a festival every September), while the salt dome of Avery Island, ringed by bayous, is the famous source of Tabasco sauce.\n\nThe crayfish that end up in so many Cajun and Creole dishes share with rice the flooded fields beside the line, and they feature in the many restaurants of Lafayette, at the heart of Louisiana’s Acadiana region, populated by descendants of exiles from the Canadian Maritime Provinces.\n\nThe border with Texas is crossed east of Orange, a deep-water port on the Gulf of Mexico and part of a major industrial area based on oil, which was first struck in 1901 at nearby Spindletop. Houston is the fourth-largest city in the US and has an impressive skyline, but San Antonio is a better place to break the journey, offering a historic downtown district, the Alamo and the River Walk of restaurants, bars and shops.\n\nThe Fairmount Hotel of 1906 is one of the largest structures ever moved; in 1985 it was eased on rollers for five blocks to its current site in La Villita National Historic District.\n\nAfter rain, pistachio trees provide splashes of green among the rolling hills of western Texas as the line starts to climb towards New Mexico. West of Del Rio is a spectacular crossing of the Pecos River canyon on the High Bridge, and far to the south can be seen the town of Langtry.\n\nThis was home to “Judge” Roy Bean, who held court in a saloon he named the Jersey Lillie because of his admiration for the British actress and courtesan Lillie Langtry. The town’s name was a coincidence; it was named after a railroad engineer, George Langtry.\n\nThe landscape becomes steadily more barren, the arid ground strewn with prickly pear, monumental cacti and Spanish dagger (Yucca gloriosa). Some passengers may alight at Alpine to visit Big Bend National Park, bordered by the Rio Grande and known for its geology and paleontology.\n\nThe climb continues to the highest point on the route, the 1,545m (1,074ft) summit at Paisano Pass in the Del Norte Mountains. Orchards of pecan trees herald the suburbs of El Paso, so extensive that the largest urban park in the United States, of 24,000 acres, is entirely within the city limits.\n\nThe first Hilton high-rise hotel was built here, in 1930, but it is the 1905–6 railway station, with its pyramidal-roofed tower that deserves attention; it was designed by the same architect as Union station in Washington, Daniel Burnham.\n\nThe railway leaves the Lone Star State and enters New Mexico at a crossing of the Rio Grande, and the railway comes within 30ft of the Mexican border. The landscape becomes quintessential Wild West country, and the keen-eyed passenger may spot both rattlesnakes warming themselves on trackside lava rock from an extinct volcano and “Window Peak”, a hole through a ridge in the Florida Mountains.\n\nThis is country associated with the Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa and Billy the Kid: Villa and his marauders attacked the town of Columbus, provoking a short conflict between the two countries; Billy the Kid was embroiled in the Lincoln County cattle wars.\n\nBetween Deming and Lordsburg the line reaches the continental divide, at 1,398m (4,587ft), before crossing into Arizona and what was once Apache country. It was in the Pelloncillo Mountains that Chief Geronimo surrendered to the US cavalry in 1886, bringing an end to the Indian Wars.\n\nJust before Tucson, hundreds of aircraft stored in the dry desert climate can be seen to the north of the line. Tucson was established as a Spanish fort in 1775; thanks to the five surrounding mountain ranges, its movie studio has been the setting and base for more than 300 westerns.\n\nA converted California Zephyr dome car stands beside the station at Maricopa, a reminder of the days when many long-distance trains had this panoramic facility.\n\nBy the time the train reaches the popular tourist resort of Yuma on the Colorado River, the railway is in the Sonoran Desert, renowned for its sand dunes and for being the wettest desert on earth. Eucalyptus trees herald the final state line, as the train enters California and the first stop at Palm Springs. This desert city is also a popular resort, famous with tennis-players and golfers, and has a two-and-a-half-mile cable-car ride that offers panoramic views over the Coachella Valley.\n\nGiant windmills generating green electricity flank the track as the train heads through Ontario (where Maglite torches are made) and Pomona before reaching the suburbs of Los Angeles. The huge complexes of the California State University and LA County Hospital are passed before arrival at Union station, opened in 1939 in a marriage of Spanish and art deco styles. Tinseltown awaits.\n\nHighlight\n\nFor many passengers the desert sections are the most appealing for their desolate beauty and unfamiliarity. Around Picacho Pass in Arizona there are great stands of the candelabra-like saguaro cactus, which can reach 50 feet (15 metres) in height and hold more than 2,000 gallons (9,100 litres) of water.\n\nBooking\n\nTo speak to an Amtrak specialist, call Holidays by Rail (0800 033 7810; amtrak.com), the leading British supplier of Amtrak tickets.\n\nAmong specialist companies that can organise tickets and other travel arrangements are Ffestiniog Travel (01766 772030; ffestiniogtravel.co.uk); International Rail (0871 231 0790; internationalrail.com); Holidays by Rail (0800 033 7960; holidaysbyrail.com).\n\nRailpasses are available for the whole of Amtrak or parts of the network.\n\nTiming\n\nThe westbound Sunset Limited (Train 1) departs from New Orleans at 09.00 on Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays. The eastbound Sunset Limited (Train 2) leaves Los Angeles at 22.00 on Sundays, Wednesdays and Fridays. The journey takes 44 hours, 35 minutes westbound and 47 hours, 40 minutes eastbound.\n\nCost\n\nA one-way fare payable by all passengers and providing access to a seat is $156. Prices to upgrade vary with the season; for a roomette they start at $256, for a bedroom at $957. Room prices include all food and other services such as bottled water and newspapers.\n\nOn board\n\nThe Sunset Limited has Superliner sleeping and dining cars and a Sightseer Lounge Car. There are three types of accommodation in the sleeping cars: roomette, bedroom and bedroom suite.\n\nA roomette accommodates one or two passengers in two reclining seats that convert to a lower berth supplemented by a fold-down upper berth; there is a shower and lavatory in the same car. Bedrooms have a large sofa with reclining sections that converts into a bed at night with second fold-down berth above; there is a private shower-room with basin and lavatory. A bedroom suite is two bedrooms combined.\n\nIncluded in all sleeping-car fares are use of the lounge car and all meals in the dining car. Menus change seasonally and include a chef’s special of the day as well as staple dishes such as the Amtrak “signature steak”, vegetarian linguini with peppers, and tilapia fillet.\n\nThere are also cars with comfortable seats, but they are not recommended for the full journey.\n\nAs part of a “Trails & Rails” partnership between the National Parks Service and Amtrak, NPS guides join the train between New Orleans and Houston, offering commentaries on nature, history and local culture.\n\nTips\n\nPacking\n\nTake a sun hat for strolling on the platform at stops.\n\nReading\n\nThe best guide to the railway journeys of North America is USA by Rail by John Pitt (Bradt), which also covers Canada’s main routes. Booked on the Morning Train by George F Scheer III (Algonquin Books) is a lovely account of Scheer’s rediscovery of the railways in the age of super-saver flights. Last Call for the Dining Car: The Telegraph Book of Great Railway Journeys (Aurum) includes an article on the Sunset Limited.\n\nAmong novels that touch on the route are A Confederacy of Dunces (New Orleans) by John Kennedy Toole, The Andromeda Strain (Arizona) by Michael Crichton, and Of Mice and Men and The Grapes of Wrath (California) by John Steinbeck.\n\nWhat to listen to\n\nYou are spoilt for choice. Start with New Orleans jazz – Dixieland bands such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band and Louis Armstrong’s All-Stars – and blues (which Jelly Roll Morton first heard in New Orleans in 1902). After Cajun music and the smooth Louisiana style of boogie-woogie performed by Professor Longhair, move on to the Texas blues style of Blind Lemon Jefferson, Lightnin’ Hopkins and T-Bone Walker. The honky tonk of Hank Williams is also associated with Texas.\n\nTune into a local radio station on the approach to California and you may hear Spanish-infuenced music, but for most people the state still means the Beach Boys and the numerous bands that came out of the Golden State from the 1960s onwards, such as Jefferson Airplane, Santana, The Byrds, The Doors and the Eagles with their album Hotel California.\n\nWhat to watch\n\nNew Orleans and the Louisiana bayous feature in the 1973 Bond film Live and Let Die, notably in the jazz funeral procession. For a flavour of post-Katrina New Orleans, see the acclaimed HBO series Treme (which also has a great soundtrack).\n\nRy Cooder’s haunting score for Wim Wenders’ Paris, Texas perfectly complements the film’s austere landscapes. The Coen Brothers’ No Country for Old Men was filmed in El Paso.\n\nYuma is on the Sunset Limited route and the 2007 film 3:10 to Yuma, starring Russell Crowe and Christian Bale, was that rarity – a remake that improved on the (1957) original.\n\nCountless films have been shot around LA; the area is graphically portrayed in The Big Sleep, Sunset Boulevard, The Graduate, Chinatown, Pretty Woman, LA Confidential and Little Miss Sunshine."
