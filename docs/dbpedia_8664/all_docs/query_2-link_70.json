The Haiku Rebellion When I was first invited into the anniversary hearings for Blood Meridian Or The Evening Redness in the West at the Southwestern Writers Collection in San Marcos, Texas, McCarthy’s Portuguese translator, my friend Paulo Faria, had recently embarked on his second offensive against the translational fortress we were going to celebrate, so I thought it might be interesting to follow up Paulo’s per diem queries to me with counter-queries of my own, as if I too were translating the novel—which I was, and always am, from pages of anamorphic Panavision to a brain of less spectacular proportions. In the matter of McCarthy, I am never shy of enlisting the aid of better minds.\n\n4 | cor m ac\n\nm c ca rt h y ’s hou se\n\nPaulo did not resist: his responses were based on the closest scrutiny and nearly a decade of pondering. “Translating Blood Meridian is the supreme ceremony,” he has told me. “I will do it for the rest of my life, always rewriting, always polishing, always from scratch, always the same but always different. I will burst into the temple again and again like Kafka’s leopards until my irruption will be part of the ritual of reading Blood Meridian in Portuguese. I will do it until I die.”1 I had one impediment. I was on strike against producing another work of prose until certain conditions in my professional life were met, and under this injunction I was writing a series of novels in haiku. As I am not a poet, and am disinterested in haiku beyond the Rule of 17, this, to me, was not actual writing—it was writing, so to speak, with the left hand. By the time three of these oddments were under way, with hundreds of haiku each, I started to reason, remember, read, even to see in haiku, fingers ever on the move unclenching to count my imprisonment in the number seventeen Still, the notion of giving a talk on Blood Meridian Or The Evening Redness in the West, fashioned to reflect a Q&A correspondence and yet consisting of haiku exclusively, seemed too perilous a stunt even for a Broadway prestidigitator such as myself. When Harold Bloom said: “All that Hamlet, Falstaff and Cleopatra require of you is not to bore them” (Genius, 21), he posed a standard for literary intercourse that’s easy enough to follow—if you are Harold Bloom. Can a scrappy New York vaudevillian engage with Judge Holden in a manner that would amuse the Judge himself? Haiku might be absurd enough to turn the trick for him, but would it for you? Probing the novel in haiku is barely a step above probing it in mime and, as with mime, haiku is annoying enough without it Zenning up a monument in Western literature. I envisioned a jetlagged McCarthy enthusiast on pilgrimage from, say, Barcelona, calling his wife and being asked how it’s going at the conference. “Well, Maria—I just heard a guy giving a talk in haiku.” “So then,” Maria says, “I was right— we should’ve taken the boys to Disney World.” As my self-assigned strike was not general, only against prose, I proposed an exhibition: new works on paper called The Lost Blood Meridian Notebook. For its title alone, how could the\n\nJudging Blood Meridian Or The Evening Redness in the West by Its Cover | 5\n\nhome of the McCarthy archive refuse me? I don’t know how, but it did. I was stranded in haiku. The haiku restriction might work better if I confined myself to the dustcover, a notion that had tempted me ever since I first adventured into McCarthy: to meditate the novels through their dustjackets—not as an opening into McCarthy’s picture plane or his framing devices. . . his use of black as a metaphysical color of depth and variety. . . his landscapes that are always dispatches from the interior—in other words, portraiture. . . or other paths of legitimate inquiry for readers who have legitimate minds—including the issue of whether McCarthy’s delicious lexiphantism asks you as much to hear his sentences as to picture their anecdotal content—in other words, whether he isn’t as much a musician as a painter—no, I would see what was there in the jackets themselves. In discussing what is between the covers of a book, can’t we carve out at least a little time for the covers? They are the first things we see when we sit down to read, the last that we see when we stop. Clothes make the man, Mark Twain famously said, but we forget, or never hear, the punchline: Naked people have very little influence on society. A stroll through any mass-market bookstore will show you how intensely, almost hysterically, this is now applied to the world of the book. Graphic novelists have been enlisted to illustrate and, really, to author covers and bookflaps for every kind of classic, from Tolstoy to Kerouac, and many of these are more than mere monetary charmers—the best of them have captured the spirit of the book as well as, or better than, decades of fine photography, inventive graphics, and pretty Impressionism from the Musée d’Orsay. On the other hand, for my own book Adventures in Reading Cormac McCarthy, after supplying my publisher with a range of images from paintings of McCarthy’s former home in El Paso to photographs of Suttree’s trolley token or kid McCarthy on the steps of his elementary school, I was shocked to see an ugly mushroom of a tree as the prominent feature of the design. It wasn’t me, wasn’t the book, wasn’t anything. A jacket can make and unmake the man, and a jacket can make and unmake a book. Unmake an author, too. If there is one thing I don’t write and don’t care about it is nature—certainly not these brown stalks of wood with leaves on them sprouting out of the ground. Tough guys don’t dance and my books don’t wear trees. Whose book is it now? Mine mostly—but that’s not enough. Luckily, that’s me and my own chickenscratch. What happens when we turn to Blood Meridian Or The Evening Redness in the West?\n\n6 | cor m ac\n\nm c ca rt h y ’s hou se\n\n2. Or The Evening Redness in the West We cannot escape the fact that the name of the novel and the name of the author appear on both the boards of the book and on its dustjacket, so for me the dustjacket is inseparable from the text of Blood Meridian Or The Evening Redness in the West, and from the broader—one might say the global—phenomenon and cultural commerce of the novel. . . in the same way that, once it sold one of its souls to cinema, the contracts for options, the preproduction plans for the film, the film itself, its promotions and its reviews are also a part of it, as will be emblemized by a frame from the film on future editions of the novel which, if it is defamed or distorted by that image, must abide it as its progeny the way that it abides the likes of us; or, in the same way that the novel’s exact title—so seldom said that my using it here might savor of the pedantic, even the contrary—is only dispensable, subsidiary, invisible, because we have made it that way. Well, wait—stop for a moment. Why do we make it that way? Do we think that McCarthy wrote it his way in order for us to ignore it? Would it change our perception of the novel if we never again severed seven words off its title? Is it of no significance that this novel, which was written with an authority seldom seen in American letters, has an act of indecision built into its title? Have we made the mistake of viewing the word Or in Or The Evening Redness in the West as existing outside the title itself, as if it were added by publishers who couldn’t make up their minds what to call it? Is the habit (not mine) of adding commas and colons to a title that has neither a cry of help from a world of grading one too many papers? Out of years of misunderstanding Derrida, have you confused deconstructing a title with dismembering it? Now that I have shifted from a we to a you, let me ask you another question: By expecting me not to bother you for stealing the complexity out of McCarthy’s title, are you warning me not to bother you for stealing the complexity out of McCarthy’s book? In his stimulating No Place for Home: Spatial Constraint and Character Flight in the Novels of Cormac McCarthy, my pal Jay Ellis at least remembers and discusses the rest of the title, and does so as early as Chapter 1, in which he\n\nJudging Blood Meridian Or The Evening Redness in the West by Its Cover | 7\n\ncalls it a “subtitle” (17), which it is in every respect: beneath the words Blood Meridian, beneath whoever can’t be bothered to say it. But Jay also labels it a “second” or “secondary” title (188). If there are two titles, can I choose the other? And are you inviting me to say: “When did you first discover The Evening Redness in the West?” or: “Did you read The Evening Redness in the West before you read All the Pretty Horses?” Is reading The Evening Redness in the West like going to the polls to vote for Spiro Agnew, Dan Quayle, Dick Cheney, or Joe Biden? In Dianne Luce’s thoughtful Reading the World: Cormac McCarthy’s Tennessee Period, Dianne’s list of abbreviations gives “BM” for Blood Meridian—really, an abbreviation of an abbreviation. My old friend John Sepich’s book is not called Notes on Blood Meridian Or The Evening Redness in the West. Even John’s revised and expanded edition, published under what we could call the moral sponsorship of the McCarthy archive, does not expand to include the title. Shane Schimpf ’s book is not called A Reader’s Guide to Blood Meridian Or The Evening Redness in the West, and Shane never acknowledges the phantom limb until it is thrown the bone of a sentence on page 58. It is dropped from the front flap of the original dustjacket, and mispunctuated for the Library of Congress in the book’s front matter, as it was in the Ecco Press paperback and has been in McCarthy criticism dating back to the issue of the Southern Quarterly that became Dianne Luce and Chip Arnold’s groundbreaking Perspectives on Cormac McCarthy, where none of the three authors who contemplate the novel even squeak out its title in passing. It is mispunctuated in both editions of Rick Wallach and Wade Hall’s Sacred Violence: A Reader’s Companion to Cormac McCarthy, where it is never once said by any author, including me, and only appears in “Works Cited” at the end, as in Barcley Owens’ Cormac McCarthy’s Western Novels, where the book is poked and prodded for seventy-five pages as if McCarthy’s title doesn’t exist—or as if, because it’s at the east end of the title, what is West in the title can be lost to what is West in McCarthy. This woefully neglected baptismal name is nowhere in either the contents or the index of Rick Wallach’s Myth, Legend, Dust, in which none of the authors critiquing the novel bother to say its name, and in Neil Campbell’s otherwise intelligent “Liberty Beyond Its Proper Bounds: Cormac McCarthy’s History of the West in Blood Meridian,” Campbell commits the logical gaff of calling the second half of the title a “qualification of the novel’s title” (221), as if its seven dwarfs\n\n8 | cor m ac\n\nm c ca rt h y ’s hou se\n\nhave decamped from the fiction to which they are attached and exist in some critical ether from which we can summon them if we need them. Rick has revered, discoursed, and broadcast the novel since buying it off a rack in an Australian railway depot in May 1991; he is currently writing a book about Judge Holden; and chatting in my livingroom the other day, he stated as true a half-truth as anything I’ve heard about the novel: “It doesn’t valorize anything about us.” But even Rick mispunctuates the title in his summary on the website of the Cormac McCarthy Society, where for decades now the title in full is rarely spoken and is excluded from the body of Rick’s entry. On the back of Rick’s old original Picador paperback, the heading over six quotations from reviewers reads: “Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy.”2 How do you like that? The title couldn’t survive the three-quarter-inch divide of the spine—on which, of course, there is the usual amputee. Harold Bloom has told me that he bows to no one in his admiration for the novel, but a reader of his Novelists and Novels would never know its title because it is not given anywhere, not even in the index. Neither the title of the anniversary hearings on the novel, nor any of the talks on its roster, represented the title as written by McCarthy and as printed on, and in, the book. When McCarthy—the man himself, in the flesh, our contemporary—packed his papers for the archive and handwrote thumbnail descriptions of each packet, for Blood Meridian Or The Evening Redness in the West McCarthy printed two words: Blood Meridian. If you think I am suggesting that you ought to feel bad about cleaving those sad seven words, you are justified in feeling that I ought to be indicting McCarthy as well. I am indicting him. Because McCarthy doesn’t mind the redaction doesn’t mean that his novel doesn’t mind. If you amputate one of your kid’s toes, doesn’t matter to me if you are the mother or the father. I indict me too: in the book that I, as a woodpecker, apparently wrote about trees in McCarthy, the truncated title is all over the place, as it is in this book. To argue that to say or to write Blood Meridian is simply a convenience, Peter (and can we move on?), begs the question, which is this: What has become of us that, in referring to a 337-page masterpiece of 116,900 words around which some of us have built our own work, words to which we return again and again to be seduced into its brawls and tournaments of sweet brutality with renewed admiration, wonder, delight—and, at times, with endoscopic penetration—we are all too lazy to say its actual name because nine words are too many for us?\n\nJudging Blood Meridian Or The Evening Redness in the West by Its Cover | 9\n\n3. The Other McCarthy To contemplate a title’s entitlements is more than to contemplate a cover, it is to contemplate an author. Is McCarthy saying of his novel You can call it this or you can call it that? Is he saying that The Evening Redness in the West is just another way of saying Blood Meridian? Is he signaling that his book won’t make up your mind about anything—that it will be polysemous even as it announces itself? Had he reread Twelfth Night, Or What You Will; Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus; Pierre; Or, The Ambiguities; Moby-Dick; Or, The White Whale, and decided it would be fun to have an Or of his own? As with Stanley Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove, Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, does the chutzpah with which McCarthy encumbers the title of his tale reflect the chutzpah with which he tells it? Of Joyce’s first book of poems Anthony Burgess said: “We can take Chamber Music in good heart when we have taken its title” (87), and I would say the same for McCarthy’s first Western, for the chamber of Joyce’s title was a kind of privy, and the music ( Joyce was a urolagniac) was a woman relieving herself—in other words, when a genius first opens the window and calls out the name of his book, he is still composing it even as he advertises. My own reading copy of Blood Meridian Or The Evening Redness in the West is a first edition with a terribly toned reproduction of Salvador Dali’s The Phantom Wagon on the recto of the jacket. On the verso is the author, his hairline receding but looking healthy, youthful, slouched comfortably in a chair in front of small collection of books stacked against a woodpaneled wall. My dealer in Heidelberg, Winfried Heid, is a cool guy who tends to inform me after an exhibition has closed—“Yah, I give you exhibition Baden-Baden, very nice”—and who surfaces in New York now and then and, over a cappuccino, passes me an envelope for the sale of a painting he can no longer describe and I can no longer recall. Winfried is a specialist in Dali who has curated many exhibitions of his work, so I asked him where the original La Charette Fantôme, a 1933 oil on wood, might be found, for I was more or less bound, now, to sniff around it for clues about the evening redness we love to contemplate but dare not speak its name. The imperfect English of Winfried’s response seemed perfectly apposite to a Dali motif. “Dalí’s intention, almost,” Winfried wrote to me, “introduction: pictures of concrete irrational are not with a rational mechanism explainable. For my\n\n10 | cor m ac\n\nm c ca rth y ’s hou se\n\nopinion this painting is a symbol for his ‘fall in love’ with Gala, which started at this time. Dalí shows us how the love coming together (as a fragile part—see the old and rattly cart). He paint as an old master, but he show things behind the figures.” When the novel appeared, the Dali was in the mansion of the Edward James Foundation at West Dean College not far from Chichester. Since then it has moved to a private collection in Geneva, where I have yet to be invited. This is no great loss. It’s an okay cover—Dali’s wagon on its way to a big city is a bit cartoonish and a bit too much of a longshot for me—but covers can be worse—at least it’s not a tree—and the luminescent lipstick font against a dark red ground is effective. As for what sort of image would invite the reader in while forcefully suggesting the feast of beautiful nightmares to which we are invited, that is not a challenge that I, as a visual artist, would undertake without trepidation. For Paulo Faria’s first Meridiano his publisher in Lisbon chose a horse. They do ride horses, but this was not a Comanche horse, a Toadvine horse, a tragic mount of any kind; it was a horse—the head of a horse—from another novel—the next one. Pondering my first edition, I was captivated more by the portrait of McCarthy, taken by Mark Morrow, than the lame reproduction of a Dali that was not among his best. This makes sense. In A Plea for Eros, Siri Hustvedt says: “In every book the writer’s body is missing” (102), and it would be nice if that were true, but it is characteristic of authors who are in my personal pantheon of able torturers, such as William Trevor, Joyce Carol Oates, Don DeLillo, Annie Proulx, Philip Roth, A. S. Byatt, Thomas Pynchon, that I never see a world when I try to read their work, I see a man or a woman in a chair, writing with a degree of fraudulence—I call it literary jerking off—that makes me hate even the word literature and hope that I am in another profession. When I read McCarthy at his best I do see a world, I don’t see a man in a chair, so it’s an interesting project for me to find him in one. And I did, in fact, write about Mark Morrow’s photograph in two pages of haiku. . . until it occurred to me to find out something about the photographer. Who is this Mark Morrow? How was he elected to point a lens at McCarthy when he was at the height of his powers, burning the darkest light in American literature? How did Mark Morrow come to be the other name, along with Cormac McCarthy, to be featured on the cover of this verbal sublimity? For all I knew he was a guy next door to whom McCarthy handed a camera:\n\nJudging Blood Meridian Or The Evening Redness in the West by Its Cover | 11\n\n“Mind taking a shot?” If he was a photographer, had he freelanced his way to the twisted keyboard that had hammered Harrogate and Lester Ballard into existence, or was he working for Random House when it was taking over half the world? Did he use a flash, or was the metered light off McCarthy brilliant enough to flare the lens and close down his aperture? Beyond his activity with the camera, was there more that he gleaned of his subject during the time that he was writing a masterpiece? What was it like to shake the hand that was forging the liquid iron of his prose? Did they toss down a few in a Knoxville snug? Did they, bachelors both without herselves to hinder them, sample some of the sluts on Magnolia Avenue, or a hundred-a-nighter working under Hazel Davidson out of Knoxville’s Meadows Condominiums? Might this Morrow have sacrificed a morrow of his own after his subject devoured him in a South Central privy? Did McCarthy mention his Western? Had he needed to lift chapters, maps, notebooks, sketches, obscure depositions and shards of Anasazi off a chair for Mark to sit—or was there not a second chair? Is there, in a cardboard box or a metal file cabinet, an Ilford or Kodacolor envelope of proofsheets filled with more Morrow versions of McCarthy? Are there clues\n\n12 | cor m ac\n\nm c ca rth y ’s hou se\n\nin them as to what Harold Bloom called “the mystery of why this astonishment was possible for him only that once” ( Josyph, Adventures, 89), or as to how it was possible at all, and if there are no clues, what might the fact that there aren’t tell us about the elusive, often invisible nature of genius? Adorning the best book, the First Folio, is an engraving by Martin Droeshout the Younger in which a cartoon head above a whaleboned supportasse and collar is too big for the body in the laced-up doublet, so that Shakespeare resembles more a Mayberry barber than the author of our humanity. No clues there, and yet the cover has not hurt the author’s reputation, despite that it does not say much for Martin Droeshout other than to have kept his name alive for four centuries. Still, if the discovery of a hitherto undisclosed portrait of Shakespeare when he was writing, say, Measure for Measure, Othello, or King Lear on Silver Street in London’s Cripplegate would constitute a seismic event, why should we wait another four hundred years before the Antiques Roadshow excavates and celebrates a lost Cormac McCarthy? I looked up this Mark Morrow and I ordered his book Images of the Southern Writer, a five-year project that features Mark’s portraits of Walker Percy, Eudora Welty, William Styron, Tennessee Williams, Robert Penn Warren, Shelby Foote, James Dickey, Erskine Caldwell—and Cormac McCarthy. The\n\nJudging Blood Meridian Or The Evening Redness in the West by Its Cover | 13\n\nportrait of McCarthy is not the one taken in the Colony Motel at 5102 Kingston Pike in the Bearden district of West Knoxville, and that was used by Random House for the jacket of the novel. It is an equally interesting—perhaps more compelling—portrait of McCarthy from around the same time, late spring of 1981. I wrote to Mark, proposing a conversation about the shoot, or shoots, and I wrote a version of the following passages for that book with the tree on the cover. In Images of the Southern Writer, McCarthy is pictured behind the ticket window of the old Southern Railway Terminal in Knoxville. “This is the window where you get a ticket with the destination left blank,” McCarthy told Morrow (52), and of course Blood Meridian Or The Evening Redness in the West is, itself, a ticket with the destination left blank. It’s an arresting photograph. When I taped a cropped copy of this picture to the original dustjacket—an act that would send any rare books collector into fits of apoplexy—the effect was so disorienting that I became nauseated, a reaction that I have whenever the universe appears unnaturally tampered with. McCarthy, smiling at the window, his striped shirt open to three buttons down, looks as if he has climbed out, or climbed up, to gaze at us for a moment before descending again into the depth of his narrative. What’s disturbing is that he is more looking at me than I am looking at him. . . looking at me trying to pierce the darkness behind him. . . bemused by the sight of a joker like me prehending this impossible object, this seanachie séance he has chosen to call Blood Meridian Or The Evening Redness in the West. It makes me want to say: “Don’t look at me like that—I haven’t used the word gnostic even once!” Of course to Mark Morrow this would have to be falderal: McCarthy is looking at the young man with a camera. Yes, but that was then, this is now. Today, the black behind McCarthy is no longer a room in an abandoned train station, it is the interior, or a passage to the interior, of something inscrutable, something that is, to this day, known only to the author. Susan Sontag identified art photography as “an enterprise of notation” (126), a good way of viewing either of Morrow’s images: for me they are both—to borrow that titular phrase from John Sepich—notes on Blood Meridian. If it is true that Judge Holden is a devil, or the Devil, or that there is, at least, a devil in the Judge, no need to look any farther than this image: there he\n\n14 | cor m ac\n\nm c ca rth y ’s hou se\n\nis, a big-eared handsome devil with a Warren Beatty mouth but a devil nonetheless. Perhaps many devils. According to railroad historians in Knoxville, McCarthy’s ticket window is really a taxi window under the stair to the second floor, a window that you passed before exiting into the parking lot beneath Depot Street. Wesley Morgan, indispensable aid to me in all things McCarthy, has sent me photographs. It is closed, all its glass is gone, but there it is, and it is not where you bought your tickets, it’s the booth from which the taxi caller signaled your ride and organized the loading of your luggage from the baggage room.3 The ticket counter was up on the second floor. Ticket indeed. Imagine—fiction from a novelist. Was McCarthy misremembering? Was he playing pretend and didn’t care what the window was for? Was he banking on a Nikon not knowing the difference? Was he accurate in that a taxi in Knoxville would have no choice but to take you to a blank destination, especially now that he had channeled it into a novel with such capacious ferocity that a man could no longer get there by going there? Here’s what he was doing: he was setting up a shot, orchestrating a career. No one else was doing it for him. The publishing industry, the critical establishment, the mainstream readership could as easily have killed him as build him a reputation. Self-promotion, one of the least attractive phrases in English, is also one of the least understood. We have abused it for so long that we no longer see that it denotes the most difficult and necessary skill for any artist to master honorably. Around Concord, Henry David Thoreau—a fellow New Englander born less than 75 miles from McCarthy—planted arrowheads that he could “find” when walking with a visitor. The butterfly perched on Walt Whitman’s finger in the famous photograph—Whitman’s favorite, taken in 1877 by W. Curtis Taylor (of Phillips & Taylor, Philadelphia)—a butterfly Whitman liked to say that he had tamed, was in fact an Easter novelty made of cardboard on whose wings were printed lines from a Christian hymn written by John Mason Neale. However allegedly uninvolved McCarthy was in the sales of his books, it is silly to think that he wasn’t engaged in shaping his image. We should also remember that a master of picturing world upon world for his readership is, of course, all the time, picturing himself.\n\nJudging Blood Meridian Or The Evening Redness in the West by Its Cover | 15\n\nIn 1971 a magazine—I believe Esquire—published a set of remarkable photographs of leading filmmakers, giving each one a credit line for the image, not as its photographer but as its director. Federico Fellini, in a shot taken by Carlo Bavagnoli, posed with Styracosaurus, and it made such subliminal—you might say autographical—sense that I never again pictured the Maestro on a set without Styracosaurus as a persuasive a.d. All of us who are in, or expect to be in, the public eye can be directors too—even when we know not what we do. Now, when I picture McCarthy, I often think of Frank Lloyd Wright because Wright’s Autobiography sits directly behind McCarthy’s head in Mark Morrow’s portrait in the Colony Motel. Filed as “McCarthy has read Wright,” it is a mildly interesting, potentially effervescent memorandum for the critical enterprise, but for me it is a moment, an image, complete in itself: McCarthy in the farthest back unit of a Knoxville motel, surrounded by the Appalachian Mountains, plunged into a bit of the old ultraviolence O my brothers in the old Southwest with Frank Lloyd Wright at his back—reminding me of something that Wright wrote to a client: All of the details are mine, in Wright’s case about houses but not a bad rule for a writer to remember when dealing with editors, agents, art directors, perhaps even photographers. In Richard Pearce’s The Gardener’s Son, McCarthy, under an alias, appears in the silent part of a tophatted investor being toured through the Gregg cotton mill in Graniteville by its manager, James Gregg, played by Kevin Conway. McCarthy is only a few frames of extra work—when I worked as an extra, I thought of myself as breathable furniture—but I have always liked the notion of McCarthy as an investor, for it is not only the mill in which he is invested, it’s the success of his own enterprise and its reputation. In preparation for making the film, McCarthy drove the South with Richard Pearce, collecting observations, exchanging ideas, and members of the cast and crew recalled to me fondly McCarthy’s positive presence on the set, much the way the director of The Road, John Hillcoat, appreciated the long conversations about the novel and the film in which McCarthy participated, as well as the fax that McCarthy typed up and sent to him suggesting quite specific alterations to the final cut of the film. In the matter of one’s image, as in the matter of one’s images, a writer cannot not be involved. At one time or another all writers are busy taming their cardboard butterflies. Even Salinger and Pynchon are tied to images that are indelible, and confining their visages to a few photographs\n\n16 | cor m ac\n\nm c ca rth y ’s hou se\n\nintensifies the few beyond measure. My favorite biography of Poe is not a biography at all, it is Michael Deas’s remarkable Portraits and Daguerreotypes of Edgar Allan Poe (which, as with Mark Morrow’s book, is sadly out of print, overdue for a new edition). As Sontag said: “To live is to be photographed,” and, as she shrewdly added: “to live is also to pose” (134). When Anaïs Nin said: “Nothing exists until it is on paper” (Fitch 4), she was speaking about her diary and other inventions, but photography is paper too. If you take a photographer to a railway station at which you are, for the moment, gainfully employed in striking a pose and telling a tale, that’s publicity—and it’s being a novelist.\n\n4. Mark Morrow None of this was haiku, but it was an insert into a finished manuscript, not a new work, so I had kept to my resolve. Given that, for me, dialogue is not prose—not exactly—I was hoping that Mark Morrow was alive and that he would speak to me. Fortunately Mark, no longer a photographer but an editor for hire, had plenty to say about McCarthy. “We became friends,” Mark told me. “I visited him twice in Knoxville and once or twice in El Paso. We corresponded regularly for several years, and he gave me advice about writing and handling girlfriends, and mused about the success of Blood Meridian.” When Mark was in Santa Fe recently he tried to reach McCarthy but nothing came of it. “Knowing Cormac, I suspect that he’s left our relationship behind—without malice, of course, but as part of the natural ebb and flow of friendships and relationships.” Opposite the depot picture of McCarthy in Images of the Southern Writer there is a brief text from which I have quoted McCarthy’s remark about the ticket window. “Someone else was to write the essays for the book,” Mark told me. “I took the pictures and made only a few notes. When I was finished with the photographs, the writer had not written a word, so I dropped him, I called the authors after the fact, propped the picture up on my desk, and I weaved the interview and other facts and comments into the picture and environs. Then I sent it to the author, who edited my essay for accuracy or additions.\n\nJudging Blood Meridian Or The Evening Redness in the West by Its Cover | 17\n\nSo you could say that Cormac McCarthy was my editor, as were Robert Penn Warren and Tennessee Williams. I don’t recall McCarthy having many changes.” In spite of the fact that Mark’s account of going to shoot McCarthy was proofed and approved by McCarthy, it misidentifies the Colony Motel on Kingston Pike as the Colonial Motel on Kingston Street, a street that doesn’t exist in Knoxville. There was in fact a Colonial on Kingston Pike but McCarthy wasn’t there in 1981 because it was torn down in the mid-1960s. More fiction from a novelist? By now, both of these one-story roadside motels have been demolished, but one can find them in archival postcards. In a card of the Colonial calling it “A Home Away from Home,” it is clearly the less depressing of the two, the sort of foliated, lounge-chaired court in which Faulkner might have stayed when he was working, or drinking, for Hollywood. Despite the motto “Pleasing You Pleases Us,” despite AC, TV, pool, and maid service, McCarthy’s motel, the Colony, doesn’t look like a home of any kind—it looks like a place to be drilled full of holes in No Country for Old Men. To those of us begging for the word, a genius in a small room can look like an act of charity, but it was home for McCarthy when Mark found him renting it for sixty dollars a week, pleased with its location near the two-story house that was Draper Books, the Capri multiplex with three films a day, affordable restaurants, and\n\n18 | cor m ac\n\nm c ca rth y ’s hou se\n\nworking well on the Western he had started seven years previous, years in which we tend to imagine him writing Suttree.4 Why didn’t McCarthy make the corrections? If you have written Suttree you are Mister Knoxville and you sure as hell know there is no Kingston Street and you don’t forget the difference between a Colony and a Colonial. Could McCarthy have left or added the error intentionally, perhaps as a strategy of avoidance—say, the way a woman, in a moment of hesitation while giving out her number, might alter one of the digits? “Cormac did edit the piece,” Mark said, “and maybe he did do that deliberately, or maybe he kept it for fictional purposes.” Mark showed me another shot from the Southern Railway Terminal: McCarthy with a plaque of four lines from Robert Burns in stanza 2 of “Is There for Honest Poverty.” WHAT THO’ ON HAMELY FARE WE DINE, WEAR HOODEN GREY, AND A’ THAT, GIE FOOLES THEIR SILK, AND KNAVES THEIR WINE, A MAN’S A MAN FOR A’ THAT.\n\nThe horrible engravure could have been done by one of the drunks in Suttree, and these lines—the entire poem—could be taken as an epigraph to Suttree. Who exactly in the Southern Railway had them bolted over the fireplace in a waiting room of light pink Tennessee marble for colored passengers in segregated Knoxville, where Robert Burns feels like Emma Lazarus on the Statue of Liberty: Give me your tired, your poor, of which there were plenty in anybody’s version of Knoxville? McCarthy’s hands are in pockets of what is not hooden grey, his eyes are piercing, and to say that he looks relaxed is an understatement: he looks transcendent. He certainly doesn’t appear to be looking at Mark or Mark’s Nikon, or to care whether he’s dining on homely fare. Every author writing a great book is, of necessity, an exile: wherever you find him, he is not really there. To paraphrase Alex in A Clockwork Orange, in this picture McCarthy is in the land all right, pregnant with a tangle of profane contingencies without a hint of the hidden reservoir of resentment that has made him a master of the novel as vendetta; and, too, without a trace of the bookhound creating his authority from years of doggedly tenacious research. Here is only the poet, the galliard in whose voice the marginalia,\n\nJudging Blood Meridian Or The Evening Redness in the West by Its Cover | 19\n\nthe scraps of rejectamenta, the napkins, the notebooks, are lifted into a score. In this picture, McCarthy is all nascency: his face is becoming what his novel is becoming. When I asked Mark whether McCarthy brought him to the Burns—for he must have known it was there—Mark’s memory was that they just happened to stumble upon it, but he also reminded me: “I really don’t remember who suggested what.” Having photographed Paulo Faria with McCarthy, who recommended a pleasing angle that included two Santa Fe icons—St. Francis Cathedral and a sign for the La Fonda Hotel—I would guess that the choice was McCarthy’s. Clearly, he has an eye. The other day I said to Wesley Morgan: “You should steal the McCarthy Burns. Go in there and pry it off. Better you than someone else.” “Someone already took it,” Wesley said. “I went hunting all of the plaques. The five others are still there. That particular Burns has. . . disappeared.”\n\n5. War Time Souvenir Shop At exactly this time I was renewing my studies of Bertran de Born, the twelfthcentury Provençal troubadour known for his meddling in royal succession and his lyric expressions of love for bloody war. With wonderful lines in my lap like: “I am always fighting and making war and fencing and defending myself and moving about” (49), or: “They shall see how my sword can cut, for on their heads will I make a broth of brains mixed with links of mail” (49), or: “When there is peace on every land, let there be a strip of war left for me. . . . I agree with war, for I neither hold nor believe any other law” (51), or: “Not so much joy in sleep have I/Eating and drinking please me less/Than hearing on all sides the cry/‘At them!’ and horses riderless/Among the woodlands neighing/And well I like to hear the call/Of ‘Help!’ and see the wounded fall/ Loudly for mercy praying/And see the dead, both great and small/Pierced by sharp spear-heads one and all.” (59)—with such lines aplenty, I wanted to situate de Born in relation to Judge Holden—to posit him as a model for the Judge. . . not for McCarthy in composing the Judge, but for the Judge in composing himself. After all, de Born moved Dante to the most amusing conceit in the Inferno: de Born turned into a cephalophore who not only carries his own severed head but, like Paul of Tarsus, speaks out of it, a Hell that would have to appeal to the Judge who, even as a corpse, would never quit talking.5\n\n20 | cor m ac\n\nm c ca rth y ’s hou se\n\nThe Judge and de Born. . . This was not one of those whisper connections of sequence and character or tone and atmosphere that give you an intellectual smile when they occur. . . such as when, in rereading A Portrait of the Artist, Stephen’s departure from Cranly circulates—like a faintly perceptible odor or current—around John Grady’s farewell to Rawlins. . . or when—to stay with Joyce for a moment—you read, in “A Portrait of the Artist,” the storyessay of 1904 that preceded A Portrait and Stephen Hero, “An impulse had led him forth into the dark season to silent and lonely places where the mists hung streamerwise among the trees; and as he had passed this amid the subduing night, in the secret fall of leaves, the fragrant rain, the mesh of vapours moon-transpierced, he had imagined an admonition of the frailty of all things” ( Joyce, “Portrait,” 262), and you realize that you are being rowed up the Tennessee River by Cornelius Suttree. . . no, this was more like the theatre exercise in which you render some offstage action that is implied or discussed but never seen in the play, or compose a biography or improvise a scene that gives your character a life before he or she walks under the floods. When, recently, I found a scrap from September 2004 filled with notes from my Ground Zero project, I was puzzled and surprised to find this disembodied sentence: “What does Suttree do when we aren’t looking at him?” If we can imagine the Judge as a youngster—and I am not sure that young Judge Holden isn’t a contradiction in terms—and if we can envision that tall young eitherhanded buck reading the afternoon away under a willow, what book can we place in his hands that would make good sense to his appearance in a rain-soaked oilcloth slicker under a Nacogdoches Bible tent in which—while smoking a cigar, and sheerly for the hellraising of it—he accuses a preacher of fucking a goat in Arkansas? Can we not at least consider de Born’s The Joys of War? And under his knee, or in his other hand, might not the Judge have had, as second best, those 241 decasyllabic verses in which an international fury of religious maniacs turns the beautiful countryside of Spain into a swirling sewer of blood, guts, and brain—I mean the Chanson de Roland, which appears to have been composed during de Born’s century? In an excellent introduction to the poem, Harold March says: Roland, aided by the relics in the hilt of his sword Durendal, specializes in the down-stroke through helmet, skull, body, saddle and horse’s back; this operation is performed three times by him. . . and once by Oliver. . .\n\nJudging Blood Meridian Or The Evening Redness in the West by Its Cover | 21\n\nwho, though just as brave as Roland, went in for brains more than brawn; besides, his sword had fewer relics than Roland’s. Some of the warlike materials are in the epic tradition extending back into classical antiquity, but the surgical details are not: entrails or broken spine protruding (lines 1201, 2247), the bared viscera (line 1278), brains bubbling down over forehead (line 2248). These matters are not for the squeamish, but the poet seems to be enjoying himself, as no doubt did the early hearers of his chanted lines. (xix)\n\nIt is that line the poet appears to be enjoying himself that puts me in mind of the Judge. Certainly whatever arguments we have about Blood Meridian Or The Evening Redness in the West, we would all have to agree that the poet appears to be enjoying himself. The poet of Roland even has his own savage ex-priest who is not even an ex, he is an archbishop, and with a name that reminds us of Tobin: Turpin, who impales the fierce pagan Abisme like a pig on a spit and tumbles him into a ditch for the love of “Mary’s holy son” (58). I said that I don’t mean to propose Bertran de Born or anyone else as a possible inspiration to McCarthy, but I can’t help thinking about a dream of the poet H.D. when she was in psychotherapy with Freud in Vienna: she was salting her typewriter. “So I presume,” she wrote, “I would salt my savorless writing with the salt of the earth, Sigmund Freud’s least utterance” (148). What a question to apply to McCarthy’s Olivetti: if he were salting it, with whom? Ah, but such probes were superficial to my task, concerning which not the Judge and war and his formative literature or the savoring of keys but photography was all. Lenses. Flashes. Dodging. Cropping. Memory motels and lost horizons in railway depots. And now listen to this from Mark: forty-five minutes of Mark in conversation with McCarthy in the Colony Motel, a living document with impossible sound that has me leaning into speakers, pressing headphones into my eardrums, at one point sobbing, not for its profundity— it’s just a chat—but for this seat in a time machine to where I should never be, that closet in the Colony, the growlery that knew that book before its tranks of Kid were finally cut, before the Judge was settled law, before it had an end and then another. . . knew that book when it was thickening with every drive in the mountains, every sit with a book in Emily Scott’s easy chair at Draper’s, every spark that flashed off a line in Chamberlain, every foray into fourth and fifth meanings in the microfont thickets of Webster’s unabridged, every bolt\n\n22 | cor m ac\n\nm c ca rth y ’s hou se\n\nof hubristic confidence daring him out of the corner and back into the ring with The Sound and the Fury or For Whom the Bell Tolls, every apparition at his seafoam blue Olivetti Lettera 32. . . a room that is knowing the novel that way now, today, because Mark and McCarthy are still there—we have this parachronic recording to prove it—for nothing that happens is ever not happening. . . and now look at this from Mark—O boy—a contact sheet with twenty shots of McCarthy in his Bearden scriptorium, with more books stacked up on the table behind McCarthy and me going blind as a monk trying to make them out—John McPhee’s Giving Good Weight, an old John Player Motor Sport Yearbook, Ernst Cassirer’s Substance and Function and Einstein’s Theory of Relativity, Banesh Hoffmann’s The Strange Story of the Quantum, Harold Blumenthal’s Sacco and Vanzetti, Hans Reichenbach’s The Philosophy of Space & Time, Carolyn Kolb’s New Orleans, Gregory Bateson’s Mind and Nature, Peter Forbath’s The River Congo, Freeman Dyson’s Disturbing the Universe, a book on Kant, John Locke’s Essay Concerning Human Understanding in two volumes, F. Max Muller’s translation of the Upanishads, also in two volumes, John R. Cooke’s The Border and the Buffalo, Weston La Barre’s The Human Animal, George F. Ruxton’s Adventures in Mexico and the Rocky Mountains, T. E. Lawrence’s Seven Pillars of Wisdom, the novel Silence by Shusako Endo—and, beyond that, views of McCarthy’s bed with the Hudson’s Bay point blanket on which he toned and tinted the shadowed land and convulsed the eternal discords of the novel, a Sony transistor radio, a cowboy belt, the motel phone, McCarthy’s shirts, a bathrobe—good God, McCarthy and I were practically living together!6 No, the beautiful sirventes of a twelfth-century Provençal apologist for war would have to wait. Do you see what happens when—to borrow a phrase from the samurai—you attack the corners? Trust me: attack the corners, there is always something there. Looking at these proofs, I think of number 29 of Kerouac’s slogans for the “Belief and Technique of Modern Prose”: “You’re a Genius all the time” (Ginsberg, 137). Yes, but few artists show it in their work, even fewer in their appearance, Picasso being the most compelling exception in both cases. What Mark’s recording and proofsheet tell me is what McCarthy’s first house in El Paso used to tell me before I, as a painter, let the paint see it differently: that when he isn’t impressing ink into paper, McCarthy—with exceptions, such as we have seen—impersonates an ordinary American. One sees this in his correspondence, where he is not a master of the epistolary art—he is not\n\nJudging Blood Meridian Or The Evening Redness in the West by Its Cover | 23\n\nFlaubert, not Henry Miller—so that if McCarthy is a genius all the time, he’s a genius at hiding it. Do you want an anecdote to back that up? In Paulo Faria’s correspondence with McCarthy, the one time that Paulo could not resist posing a truly interpretive question, he asked McCarthy what happens between the Judge and the Kid in the privy at the end of the novel. McCarthy answered him. It was simple and clear. Two words, handwritten beside Paulo’s question: “Don’t know.” Speaking of Dante the Florentine reminds me that when he was fine-tuning his tour through the sadistic, subterranean vengeance of Christianity, Dante was living in the Palazzo degli Scaligeri in Verona, whose viceroy, Can Grande della Scala, decorated Dante’s walls with murals of the Muses. Glorious. Audly David White, proprietor of the Colony Motel—well, I don’t need to finish that sentence. It doesn’t matter. I know this room at the Colony: I’ve spent much of my life in it. This is the room in which there is nothing on the walls because there are no walls. This is the room Henry Thoreau had in mind when he said that we live outdoors and we duck behind a panel. This is the room in which nothing is interesting until it burns to the ground. This is the room from which only your characters don’t wish to escape. This is the room in which Picasso hangs an invisible sign: NEVER GO DOWN TO THE BEACH. This is the room in which once you have written the first word you would have written them all, although you will be the only one never to know that. This is the room in which you pick up the phone and it’s Hemingway telling you that being a writer means finishing things. This is the room in which you formulate your own Occam’s razor: The number of obligations must not be multiplied beyond necessity. This is the room in which you have to be willing for everybody who loves you to hate you. This is the room in which you assassinate the man that the world would have you be, then you assassinate the world. This is the room in which you hear who you are and what you are making in the noise of the traffic, the caw of a crow. This is the room in which you do not swat flies, you swat jetliners with a broken tennis racket. This is the room in which you walk the plank backward and catch yourself before you hit the water. This is the room in which, as the pendulum swings from supreme self-confidence to kicking the shit out of your paragraphs, doubt is a luxury you can never afford. This is the room in which the dimensions of Manifest Destiny are measurable in inches: 8½\" x 11\". This is the room in which life, however close to the bone, can never be better. This is the room to which it is not the nine Muses but their wicked\n\n24 | cor m ac\n\nm c ca rth y ’s hou se\n\nstepsisters who come to copulate, and the prostitute pounded on the bed next door hears in the clack of your typewriter keys not the sound of your book but the sound of being booked. This is the room in which you redefine the seven sacraments, condense them into one, and receive it every day. This is the room in which you can only glory in, and glorify, the god of the good sentence.\n\n6. Shooting McCarthy “I have ten long letters from him,” Mark told me about McCarthy, “including one on a letterhead from Hotel Victoria, Chihuahua Chih, Mexico. He’s talking about his editor pressuring him to finish the book, Blood Meridian I’m fairly sure. He did write about his travels researching the book in his letters. It’s been a long time since I thought about those days so long ago. I should have written more down before I was 57. I can’t be sure even if my memories are factual—such as driving around El Paso with Cormac in his convertible El Dorado. Did I spend the night? Or two? I will have to take a detective approach to figure this out: scraps of paper, notes from long ago. Keeping a journal would have been a good idea.” When Mark and I lunched in the Skyline Diner on 34th Street in Manhattan, I asked him to sign his book for me, then I asked him to sign his and McCarthy’s dustjacket, which he did in the lower-left corner over his name, which appears in very small white print over the red of the jacket that borders his portrait of McCarthy and the Dali on the cover. I also gave him a poster I had painted for a 1998 conference on McCarthy, and I showed him the snapshot I had used as a motif, hoping that the image of McCarthy’s old house on El Paso’s Coffin Avenue might recall his visits there. “I remember that he had a shop,” Mark said, “and that he was building window frames for his house, by hand, from scratch, using mortise and tenon. I thought that was amazing.” As I want to give you the thrust of my exchanges with Mark, you can thank Mark Morrow for your not having to suffer six pages of haiku about Blood Meridian Or The Evening Redness in the West. As for Bertran de Born as an avuncular inspiration to Judge Holden, you should take him up. De Born’s a good guy. A little bloodthirsty. But so is McCarthy. So am I. So are you or you wouldn’t be reading this.\n\nJudging Blood Meridian Or The Evening Redness in the West by Its Cover | 25\n\nJOSYPH: (Referring to Images of the Southern Writer) This is an important book. Most of these writers aren’t around anymore. You caught them in time. MARK MORROW: It’s a Book of the Dead. JOSYPH: But McCarthy’s star is still on the rise. How did you get in touch with him? MORROW: I began this project in 1979 after my fiction teacher at the University of South Carolina, William Price Fox, told me that I was a better photographer than writer. So I determined to do a book on Southern writers. I am not sure whether McCarthy was on my initial list—I believe he was, and likely in the column of “unknown” authors or maybe even “minor” southern voices. This was all before email—thankfully, otherwise I wouldn’t have these dozens of letters from authors—but it was also before spellcheck, and my letters had a lot of typos in them. This is why for the first letter or two I misspelled his name either as “Cormick” or as “MacCarthy.” The first letter I wrote to him asking if he would let me photograph him for the book—it was so amateurish, I don’t know why he wrote me back. I have often thought that one of the reasons he agreed to see me was my obvious inexperience, lack of polish: I was not a threat because I did not know anything. JOSYPH: He might have found that charming, but he wouldn’t necessarily have wanted to be involved with you. He must have seen something. MORROW: I did treasure my friendship with him based on the fact that for some reason he liked me—and the fact that I had no idea he was such a genius. Of course after reading his books I was impressed, but it was only after all the attention to the trilogy that I recognized fully his position in world literature. I think part of our friendship was that he liked my honesty and near bumpkinness, and because I did not have an agenda. And, I read his books and I understood them. I was not just a photographer. JOSYPH: Did you read his novels after you knew you were going to see him? MORROW: Yes, I read all of his books. JOSYPH: Which would have included Suttree. MORROW: Yes, yes. I found them hard to read. (Referring to Blood Meridian Or The Evening Redness in the West) I really like that one. Is this a first edition? I can’t remember if I had him sign it for me. I have a letter here from Cormac postmarked May 13, 1981, indicating that he got a letter from me and some pictures. I always included a 5 x 7 of William Styron and Tennessee Williams to show writers that I was legit.\n\n26 | cor m ac\n\nm c ca rth y ’s hou se\n\nMcCarthy’s letter to Mark states that he wouldn’t object to being in Mark’s book, but that arranging the shoot might be difficult, “as my movements are uncertain and unpredictable.” McCarthy wonders whether Mark will be traveling up east, as McCarthy must go to New York to meet with his editor. “Other than that,” he says, “I will be in & out of Knoxville,” and he closes by saying that he might be going to Europe in July. MORROW: He’s always been a very private guy, apparently. He doesn’t like to do interviews. JOSYPH: Well, my understanding is that he’s extremely sociable—he just doesn’t talk to critics and journalists because he doesn’t want to interpret his work for them, and since they’re the ones writing about him, he gets this reputation. But if he lived even a portion of what’s in Suttree, you’d have to say that he was, at least then, strenuously sociable. It’s funny that Faulkner wanted the work to speak for itself but there are at least two volumes of interviews with him in which he talks about how he doesn’t want to talk about it. That was part of his self-image, part of his act. I get the sense that McCarthy has patterned himself after Faulkner in that respect, only McCarthy has stuck to it. MORROW: Yes, his reclusive reputation has more to do with his honesty and personal integrity than anything else. He just knows that if you open the door to all, no one benefits: he loses work time and gets off track, and the supplicant-fan-researcher gets a minimally engaged experience. It’s a practical decision. He really does like people and values relationships. He’s a good guy who just knows what he wants.7 I must have taken two trips to Knoxville, but it’s confusing because Cormac didn’t date his letters and my only clue to the date of a letter is the postmark, and I might have mixed up the envelopes. I wish I’d kept better notes. I do have a taped interview with Cormac that I used to create the essay that’s in the book. JOSYPH: People will be after that tape like the raiders of the lost ark. MORROW: We mostly talked about other writers and the nature of fame and what success means to other writers. JOSYPH: In the shots of McCarthy in the Southern Terminal, he is wearing a different shirt than at the Colony Motel: one with a collar, one without. MORROW: I am fairly certain that I took the depot picture on the second trip, after the first, failed attempt.\n\nJudging Blood Meridian Or The Evening Redness in the West by Its Cover | 27\n\nJOSYPH: You didn’t like this motel picture? MORROW: No, no I didn’t. For one thing, there’s a whole discussion in a letter of something which is embarrassing— JOSYPH: Is it all the white of the shirt? MORROW: No, he’s sitting with his legs open and he’s got his crotch right there in the foreground and it’s vulgar looking. JOSYPH: So you cropped it? Or they did? MORROW: I must have suggested it to the editor. JOSYPH: But if you didn’t like the shot from which this one derived, how did it get to Random House? Did McCarthy submit it? MORROW: Yes. JOSYPH: That’s interesting. MORROW: I think he wanted to help me succeed. And he did. JOSYPH: Do you remember what equipment you brought? MORROW: Yes, my daughter has the camera now. It was a Nikon F2 with a motor drive. I recorded this entire session—it was about an hour sitting there before we got into his car and drove someplace—so you can hear it, this camera, click-click-click. JOSYPH: Why did you record the shoot? MORROW: I thought I might write an article about him, but I decided against it. I did write one about Walker Percy. JOSYPH: Did you use a flash? MORROW: I had a Vivitar type of flash and a silver umbrella to bounce the light back onto my subject. I could set up and take down quickly. I didn’t have to plug anything in. I used a flash for all of them. (Referring to the depot shot) That one too. I like the effect of the black in the background. It focuses on him and everything else kind of fades away. JOSYPH: It’s a great picture. Was this one of the ones you sent to him out of the proofs? MORROW: Yes, and he was wondering which one to use. I don’t know why I did this, but I have all the letters that he sent to me, and I have all the letters that I sent to him, so I have the entire correspondence from introducing myself all the way up to the last letters we sent. In a letter to him I said, about the one in the motel, well, I’ve shown this to a bunch of girls and they didn’t find it too vulgar, but you might get some calls from them—something really\n\n28 | cor m ac\n\nm c ca rth y ’s hou se\n\nstupid like that. But he never said, well, you’re an idiot or anything like that. He was fine with me. JOSYPH: (Referring to the depot shot) Exactly the effect in the lighting that you’ve observed is why this one’s almost too strong for the novel. (Referring to the motel shot) This is such a different image. This is an author photo. (Referring to the depot shot) This is like: “O, man—who is this guy?” MORROW: That’s true. I’d never thought about that. JOSYPH: (Referring to the motel shot) So this was a wider shot? MORROW: Yes, it took in the whole room, including the telephone and everything. JOSYPH: (Looking at the wider motel shot) It certainly doesn’t look as if he’s there overnight. MORROW: O no, he was living there. In fact this letter—the postmark is two twelve eighty-one— JOSYPH: (Reading the postmark) Knoxville. MORROW: Yes. I must’ve been sending my letters to one of his brothers. JOSYPH: Did he handwrite to you, or did he type? MORROW: O, everything’s handwritten, just like this. There are no typed letters. So he says: (Reading) “Opinion seems to be divided as to the relative merits of the different black and whites. My brother, who is a photographer and serious amateur, expresses a preference for the one looking out of the Victorian hatcheck parlor. Actually, the one taken in the motel room when I was looking at the camera isn’t bad. Maybe it could be cropped to be long vertically and omit the lamp, telephone, bed. Or, is that not ethical?” (Laughter) JOSYPH: So he’s thinking consciously about what would make a decent photograph—he’s participating. MORROW: Yes, yes. (Reading) “Anyway, pick the one you like.” JOSYPH: This is prior to thinking about the novel, so he means for your book? MORROW: Yes. In that same letter, McCarthy critiques a first-person story that Mark had sent to him, saying: “I think you’ll have to write some more before you’re fully turned into the ‘I’ that writes.” MORROW: Interesting way of putting it.\n\nJudging Blood Meridian Or The Evening Redness in the West by Its Cover | 29\n\nJOSYPH: Before you’re fully turned into the ‘I’ that writes. MORROW: (Reading) “Some writers with a body of work behind them, and some considerable reputation, never have done it. It’s a perilous thing.” JOSYPH: (Reading) “They can write an essay in good sensible English but as soon as they sit down to write fiction. . . something strange happens to them and they begin to—” MORROW: (Reading) “—speak in tongues. Only literary persons can read their stuff. Children and dogs know immediately that it’s bogus.” These comments are comparable to what McCarthy told Morrow in the Colony Motel. “Even people who write well can’t write novels,” McCarthy said. “They assume another sort of voice and a weird, affected kind of style. They think, ‘O now I’m writing a novel,’ and something happens. They write really good essays. . . but goddamn, the minute they start writing a novel they go crazy. . . I don’t know what happens to them. . . but you know I just can’t read the damn stuff.” One exception with which McCarthy was impressed and recommended Mark to read is Ron Hansen’s first novel, Desperadoes. Published by Knopf the same year as Suttree, 1979, it is a brilliantly detailed first-person narrative about the Dalton gang that must have been an ally to McCarthy’s first Western, for they are both gangster yarns that make you feel the heat in both the blood that is spilled and the blood that spills it, and see some semblance of your sorry self in the victims, even as you root for their killers. . . in other words, they could both be viewed as highclass pulp sensationalism as morally concerning as anything in mainstream American entertainment to which they are otherwise superior. Also in his letter to Mark, McCarthy shares some tasty tidbits out of McCarthy’s Book of Love and, along with that, a critical piece of advice about women that would prove instrumental in shaping Mark’s future: “Find one who wears sensible shoes.” MORROW: Yes, you see, we were friends, and I was complaining about this idiot woman I was going out with. She was driving me crazy, so he would give me advice on women, and I took his advice and used it when I met my gorgeous, wonderful wife. JOSYPH: Was she wearing sensible shoes? MORROW: She was wearing sensible shoes.\n\n30 | cor m ac\n\nm c ca rth y ’s hou se\n\nJOSYPH: Did you know what he meant by that? MORROW: Yes. Somebody who was grounded, who had something going on besides being just pretty or— JOSYPH: Flirtatious? MORROW: Flirtatious. Something deeper than just the fact that you can’t wait to spend another minute with her. So, it was good advice, actually. JOSYPH: He’s writing to you as a buddy. You became friends, really. MORROW: O yes. I have dozens of letters like this. JOSYPH: So: you shot for about an hour, you taped him on a cassette, you got into the car and took a drive, then you went to the Southern Terminal another day. That’s when he said—or later, over the phone, you decided together that he might have said or could have said: “This is the window where you get a ticket with the destination left blank,” but that was the taxi caller’s window, and in this letter he knows it wasn’t where you got your ticket, because he calls it a Victorian hatcheck parlor. While McCarthy was posing for you, or while you were working on the essay together, he was playing—he didn’t necessarily mean it literally. He was playing with the abandoned train station—this is where, and how, a man or a woman got the hell out of Knoxville. In other words, he was using the Southern Railway Depot as a prop.\n\n7. Meridiano de Sangue Ou O Crepusculo Vermelho No Oeste I’ve been thinking about the fact that McCarthy gave Mark a chapter in Mark’s book, gave Mark the key to finding his wife, and attached Mark’s work to one of the great novels of the century—not bad for an hour in a roadside motel. And so I can no longer see one man in that room: Mark’s image, for me, is now a double portrait. One thing that Mark and I have in common is participation in dressing a book by McCarthy. I began this chapter with McCarthy’s Portuguese translator, Paulo Faria. I would like to conclude with him. The cover of Paulo’s translation of Suttree, published by Relógio D’Água in 2009, features a shot of the Tennessee River and the Gay Street Bridge, one of hundreds I had taken on the challenge to find a little of Suttree’s Knoxville in what is there today, but with no expectation of appearing on the book—although it did occur to me\n\nJudging Blood Meridian Or The Evening Redness in the West by Its Cover | 31\n\nthat it would be a thrill for that to happen purely by the accident of Paulo’s American friend, who is also a visual artist, having a few hundred funk-filled shots of Knoxville. I had no such totally surprising accidents planned for Paulo’s second Meridiano, but here’s what happened. When a Portuguese literary magazine, LER (Read), published a piece about Paulo’s visit to Knoxville, it used a few of my Knoxville photographs, including one of the model for J-Bone—James Long—shooting check pool with Paulo at the Fraternal Order of Eagles on Walnut Street opposite the church in which Long and McCarthy had been altar boys together. When Paulo’s publisher agreed to let Paulo translate Meridiano for the second time—from scratch, without consulting the first attempt—the deal was that Paulo would not be paid for the work and that he would travel to the McCarthy archive at the Wittliff Collections and write a piece for LER to generate publicity for the project. Among the pictures I provided for this second article, there was one that Paulo liked for the cover of his translation and that’s the one that was used. Trouble is, it was not only my image that was cropped to fit the format— once again it was the title, only here it had happened on the cover of the book. There was room for Peter’s picture, but Ou O Crepusculo Vermelho No Oeste could go screw itself. Now, because of us, all of Portugal has lost The Evening Redness in the West.\n\n32 | cor m ac\n\nm c ca rth y ’s hou se\n\nAs for that image, it’s a burntout waste of a church such as the Glantons might have passed in their travels across the Southwest. It’s a pacific image, but with a flavor of bleakness, abandonment, destruction; it is, at least, a little more germane than a pretty horse. And I am, of course, delighted to have it there. The fact that it was taken just off Centre Street in the Jamaica Plain suburb of Boston does not seem to have hurt the enterprise. we’re all in fiction— even those of us who are merely the dressers\n\nA Walk with Wesley Morgan through Suttree’s Knoxville | 33\n\nA Walk with Wesley Morgan through Suttree’s Knoxville\n\nDuring three days in November 2010, Wesley Morgan was kind enough to let me record the latest of the many excursions on which he has taken me to celebrate the novel that is, for both of us, the best of Cormac McCarthy’s masterworks, a book that continues to excite us and to inform our very different lives in very different parts of the world. About Suttree we have yet to disagree. In the novel our friendship was planted and has grown. Wherever we wander, to Suttree we return like brothers traveling home. As with the followers of Aristotle who were known as Peripatetics because of his habit of strolling as he taught, I am a Peripatetic in the School of Suttree, for with my learned master Wesley I am ever in motion through the streets, the alleys, the waterfronts, the railway sidings of Knoxville.\n\n34 | cor m ac\n\nm c ca rth y ’s hou se\n\nAs a professor at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Wesley has not formally taught a word of Suttree, for officially his field is psychology, but for decades now he has devoted much of his time to tracking down the people and places out of which the novel was built, and this is more than an avocation. His website is called Searching for Suttree, and indeed he has searched for him in the streets of the city he and McCarthy have shared, in archival newspaper articles, in courthouse records, in personal snapshots and professional photographs, in obscure graveyards, in school yearbooks, in junkshops, in maps, in stashes of letters for the viewing of which he has sometimes negotiated for years, and in the memories of past and present Knoxvillians. And his detective work has not been confined to Suttree. “I went out to Twin Creek Road and the Harris Chapel Baptist Church again today,” he wrote to me recently in a message that typified the spirit of his researches, in this case about The Orchard Keeper. “Nobody seemed to be around. Things look quite different with the leaves off the trees. It gave me some new ideas and perspectives on where Arthur Ownby’s cabin and the Green Fly Inn might have been. I will have to go back to the deeds office and see what I can dig up on a couple of the properties.” Four hours later there was this: “I got to thinking about what I have been told of the Green Fly Inn—that it was at Brown Gap. I have assumed that Brown Gap was right where the Orchard Road and Twin Creek Road intersect Martin Mill Pike. But now that I think of it, one could make the argument that the actual gap is maybe a hundred yards farther up the road nearer the top of the hill. There is still a steep drop-off by the side of the road there, as well on the Twin Creek and Orchard Road side. Coming up Twin Creek Road, I could see some stonework beside and above the road and below Martin Mill Pike, suggesting that something might have been there at one time. I will have to see who owned that land.” Wesley’s presentations and articles are always interesting and free of academic jargon or critical theory, sticking strictly to the facts as he has discovered them. Whenever I have a Suttree question, he answers immediately out of a resource that is truly staggering, and yet he is never proprietary or overly confident and is, in fact, fastidious at correcting his mistakes. The book in which he has gathered his findings is ever on the verge of completion, so that often I have told him that he is like Darwin, who couldn’t stop growing and tweaking his Origin of Species and might have continued to do so forever if Alfred Russel Wallace, another scientist who was onto something similar,\n\nA Walk with Wesley Morgan through Suttree’s Knoxville | 35\n\nhadn’t provided the impetus for Darwin to let go and to send his book into the world. Taking a psychological tack, the other day I said to him: “If you finish and publish the book, you will not die. In fact you will live a long life to write others.” Wes wrote back: “Perhaps I have not fully analyzed my hang-up about finishing,” but he thought that I might be mistaken. “I have material for The Orchard Keeper and Child of God waiting in the wings that should keep me going for quite some time.” There is no room here for our visit to the site of McCarthy’s childhood home along Martin Mill Pike, of which a chimney in the trees is all one can see\n\n36 | cor m ac\n\nm c ca rth y ’s hou se\n\nafter the fire that destroyed it. . . or to the freestone wall that McCarthy constructed for his home on Light Pink Road. . . or to the gate in front of Orchard Road where—supporting Wesley’s claim that the so-called water tower featured in The Orchard Keeper is, in fact, a Federal Aviation Administration facility—one can see on the chain a lock with the inscription FAA, and where one can see, along Martin Mill Pike, the steep declivity in the woods where the Green Fly Inn might have stood before it suffered the catastrophe that highlights the novel. . . or to the Presbyterian cemetery—the oldest in Knoxville— that is memorably evoked at the start of Suttree, and in which Wesley told me about the local bootlegger who left his moonshine whiskey under one of the ancient stones where, on what Wesley called “the honor system,” buyers were expected to leave their money. . . or to the former S&W Cafeteria—now a beautifully appointed restaurant and bar called S&W Grand that, although it has just opened, is soon to close down to nothing again—where men once left their flat straw hats on a counter, and where you could still weigh yourself on the scale on which Suttree seems to have gotten his “free weight”. . . or to the Bijou Theatre on South Gay Street above which Suttree roomed in a building that was owned by the Presbyterian Church when the theatre was a porno house. . . or to the engravures of lines from Robert Burns that we discussed in the last chapter—“Time comes wi’ kind oblivious shade/And daily darker sets it”—“Be ye not unmindful to entertain strangers”—“If ye hae made a step aside/Some hap mistake o’erta’en you/Yet still keep up a decent pride/ And ne’er o’er far demean you”—those encouraging Scotch oddments carved in marble and framed over fireplaces now in private offices in what had been the Southern Railway Terminal. . . or to Clancy’s Service Stamp Co. for a chat with Walt Clancy, one of the characters in the novel. . . but here is at least a sampling of what it is like to walk the great old Southern city of Knoxville with one of its most extraordinary gentlemen and, with every step, to be reading yourself deeper into the great American poem of Suttree.\n\n1. The Reality in Front of You (A restaurant on Kingston Pike in West Knoxville near the former location of the Colony Motel, where McCarthy worked on Blood Meridian Or The Evening Redness in the West)\n\nA Walk with Wesley Morgan through Suttree’s Knoxville | 37\n\nJOSYPH: You were in Knoxville when McCarthy was living here. Why didn’t you hang out together? Did you blow it? MORGAN: Yes, I really did blow it. We had a lot of mutual friends and must have crossed paths hundreds of times, but we never caught each other’s eye. JOSYPH: How did you learn that you had this genius writing in your backyard? MORGAN: In the old apartment I used to live in, a friend who lived upstairs had been an ex-military corpsman, a blood technician at the hospital, a student at the university, an alcoholic—and an aspiring writer and musician. He was perpetually broke. One afternoon he said: “Why don’t you come up with me to the mountains? I’ve got this friend up there living in a cabin I’d like you to meet. We can drink some, party some, and he’s a writer—he’s awfully good—he hasn’t published yet, but he’s going to be good.” Well, my schedule was pretty full, and I knew that it wasn’t my company he wanted—he wanted transportation up to the mountains. I begged off, but he did tell me that the guy’s name was Cormac McCarthy. I had never heard of him, but the name stuck with me. A year later my mother had a birthday. She was a heavy reader. A review in the Knoxville News-Sentinel said that Cormac McCarthy had published his first novel—it was Wilma Dykeman’s review of The Orchard Keeper—so I thought: “That’ll be a good thing to get her.”1 Miller’s Department Store had a bookstore on the Henley Street level, so I ran down and picked up a copy. When I started to wrap it up, I thought: “Well, maybe I’ll read it first.” I was captured by it. JOSYPH: Of course that was a first edition. Did it make it to Mom, then back to you again? MORGAN: I had reservations about giving it to her, but she read fairly widely, so there was a chance that she might like the writing style if not the content. She politely said that she liked it but the language was a little rough for her. Years later I did go back to her bookcases and look for it. It wasn’t there. JOSYPH: Was it the level of the prose or the raunch of the dialogue that put her off? MORGAN: The dialogue was too raunchy for her taste. My mother was more than a bit proper and prudish. JOSYPH: In Suttree, when he’s looking for J-Bone, who’s selling shoes in Miller’s, McCarthy refers to the “perfumed and airconditioned sanctuary” of Miller’s and a “cool opulence available to the most pauperized” (68). Is that the Miller’s where you bought The Orchard Keeper? MORGAN: Same business, different location. Rich’s moved from Atlanta to\n\n38 | cor m ac\n\nm c ca rth y ’s hou se\n\nKnoxville and built the store that I bought the book in. They didn’t do well, so Miller’s bought Rich’s and had two major stores within blocks of each other. The “new” Miller’s, where I bought the book, is now the University Conference Center. The old Miller’s on Gay Street is now offices. It still has signs calling it the Miller’s Building. JOSYPH: Where was McCarthy living at this time? To a New Yorker, cabin in the mountains sounds woodsy, bearful—isolated. MORGAN: That’s what it was. It was in a fairly remote area at the time called Waldens Creek, between Townsend and Sevierville or Pigeon Forge. He moved there with his first wife sometime in 1961 or ’62. It’s a beautiful spot. The creek runs along it, forming a valley. Recently, I went up looking for the cabin because I had heard that it was about five miles from a particular intersection. It was a road through the valley with a couple of cabins along the way. Some of them look like they could have been there when McCarthy was there, but I took some pictures and my source didn’t recognize any of them, so McCarthy’s place might be gone. JOSYPH: Is that neck of the woods in the early novels? MORGAN: That’s pretty much where Child of God is set. JOSYPH: So when Lester Ballard is running through the snow with a mattress on his back— MORGAN: That’s right nearby. I believe the book’s “Frog Mountain,” better known as Bluff Mountain, with the turnaround where Lester gets his women, is not too far from there. Fox’s General Store is at the intersection where I was told to measure from. There’s an old sawmill site up there where they take Lester after he’s been captured. And you can trace his route down that road to the store where Lester tries to sell the watches. JOSYPH: You feel strongly that the route of The Road reaches here. MORGAN: It’s from McCarthy’s descriptions that I’ve been able to have a mental picture of these places and drive the route myself. The first place that touches on his early novels is when the man and the boy go through Knoxville. They cross the Henley Street Bridge. The ragpicker in Suttree lives under that bridge. Then they go out to the McCarthy house, the family house on Martin Mill Pike, which is not linked with any of the earlier novels but is certainly linked with McCarthy. Then he goes along the highway to Sevierville, which is pictured in Child of God where the floods took place and the sheriff tells some stories. Then they go up to Gatlinburg, which is where Suttree takes his girl\n\nA Walk with Wesley Morgan through Suttree’s Knoxville | 39\n\nJoyce when they drive through the mountains. The Road continues through Newfound Gap, which is where Suttree travels with Joyce while drinking in the back of a taxi. When the man and the boy come down in North Carolina, there’s a pretty good chance that they go through Bryson City, which is where Suttree ends up after his transformative sojourn in the mountains. JOSYPH: Two years ago, when McCarthy’s childhood home on Martin Mill Pike went up in smoke, you witnessed the fire and you spoke to me from the ruins. Is that the home that the man and the boy in The Road visit?2 MORGAN: Yes, it is. I think The Road is the only novel in which it appears. JOSYPH: It never occurred to me to make the connection. You’ve trained yourself to pin these places down. MORGAN: That’s why I was so interested in the yellow firebrick. JOSYPH: This is the artifact that found its way onto the seat of your Volvo. In New York we say that things fell off a truck. Here, a brick fell into a “truck.” I remember encouraging you to curate the remains. What was the significance of the yellow brick? MORGAN: It’s a heavy yellowish facing brick for the outside of the fireplace under the mantelpiece, facing the room. So it’s kind of a fancy brick. In The Road, McCarthy describes a yellow firebrick—“They walked through the diningroom where the firebrick in the hearth was as yellow as the day it was laid” (26)—but I don’t know whether he means the actual high-temperaturehardened brick for inside the fireplace. Those I couldn’t get to: they were still cemented in, holding up the chimney. JOSYPH: Either way, you have a piece of the novel now. This has been one of my themes as a reader of McCarthy: how do you touch a novel beyond the book that’s in your hand—how do you walk it, live it, beyond the walls of your study and the armchair experience, enacting or reenacting it as a way of savoring it, absorbing it, understanding it beyond the verbal or the conceptual. Miller has a nice line in Tropic of Capricorn: “My understanding of the meaning of a book is that the book itself disappears from sight, that it is chewed alive, digested and incorporated into the system as flesh and blood which in turn creates new spirit and reshapes the world” (221). That’s more a Millerean than a Morganesque perspective, but it’s essentially the reader on his or her feet, taking the gloves off. MORGAN: I also have some charred oak flooring I’d like to work into frames for some of my pictures of the fire and the remains.\n\n40 | cor m ac\n\nm c ca rth y ’s hou se\n\nJOSYPH: To me this is more than a kind of fetishism, or being a fan. From reading McCarthy, you see that he knows what he’s talking about. Your researches establish that authority in other ways. To be able to go see it, touch it, load it into your truck, is additional verification—which is what you’ve been doing for years with McCarthy—showing that he’s not making it up out of whole cloth. MORGAN: Right. One of the things that struck me early on was something I had read in a review of Suttree: McCarthy’s colorfully imaginative characters. I said: “They weren’t imagined—most of them were people who were running around, identifiable.” I wanted to point out the actual things that McCarthy described very, very well—not to take anything away from him—but it’s a different kind of art when so much is based on—transformed from—the reality in front of you. JOSYPH: The fact that, say, James Long—the J-Bone of Suttree—was a friend of McCarthy’s doesn’t make it easier for Long to come alive on McCarthy’s page and to achieve the transcendence that makes him literature. But due to the fact that I was able to meet Jim when you brought Paulo Faria to play check pool with him at the Eagles Club, over on Walnut Street, I am even more moved when I find him in the novel, or the character who is based on\n\nA Walk with Wesley Morgan through Suttree’s Knoxville | 41\n\nhim, being such a really good pal to Suttree.3 It’s J-Bone’s name that Suttree gives to the bail bondsman—until he discovers that Long— MORGAN:—is in the cell right behind him! And it’s Long’s mother who takes care of Suttree. JOSYPH: Beautiful part of the novel, where Suttree allows himself a home for a while. You and I are privileged to be living at the time of the author, the time of the novel, the time of at least some of its characters, who we can meet in a poolroom and take a shot of rum with them—as we did with J-Bone, Big Frig, and Walt Clancy. MORGAN: Jim smiled and said: “Well, I’ll go get my stick.” JOSYPH: He was shooting so fast that it was only by taking 200 pictures that a few were in focus. He was playing beyond photography. “I guess sometimes you fall into a rhythm,” he said. “I was always pretty fast. Maybe I’d do better if I wasn’t.” But he must’ve been a firstclass hustler. I’ve always assumed that as you followed McCarthy after The Orchard Keeper there was a sea change with Suttree: you began to look for the novel in the city. Or were you scouting locations and characters before that? MORGAN: One of the things that appealed to me about The Orchard Keeper was that I believed I had recognized some places in the novel, and built up a fantasy that I knew the locale. I was wrong. I was way off base. But the idea of trying to find the locations in his novels occurred to me early. When I read Suttree it knocked me over. I didn’t have to search for those places. I was immediately aware of an awful lot, but I hadn’t yet made a quest out of it. That came much later. It links up with my professional research in the history of psychology. I was researching the Thematic Apperception Test, a personality test developed at Harvard by Henry Murray and his colleague Christiana Morgan in the 1930s.4 You show someone a picture and you learn about his or her personality by the stories that are told about the picture. Murray was a psychiatrist whose major interest in life was Herman Melville. Reading MobyDick was a turning point for him. He believed that you could read some of Melville’s works and determine a lot about Melville the man, and his goal was to write a psychobiography of Melville. The closest he came was an introduction to Pierre; Or, The Ambiguities.5 It struck me that nothing was known about McCarthy, and I thought: “Why don’t I select a novel of McCarthy’s and see what I can learn about him?” One thing you discover about Murray’s\n\n42 | cor m ac\n\nm c ca rth y ’s hou se\n\ntest is that the more imaginative the story, perhaps the more revealing it might be. So I thought it might be helpful if I looked at Suttree and identified those things that were a reflection of reality, and what I couldn’t find would be imaginative and perhaps more revealing. I haven’t carried that through, but that’s what got me started in finding out how much of the novel is based on real people, places, events. JOSYPH: You found more and more details that you could put your hands on. MORGAN: Sometimes I think I can see Knoxville through 1950s eyes. Other times I’m lost. They’ve changed the streets around, torn down buildings, built new highways, developments—it’s just so different. Where Suttree buries his son still remains a mystery. What might he have used to develop his description of it? Why might McCarthy have broken from his pattern, which was to have a place that was clearly identifiable? As far as I can tell, this McAmon Cemetery didn’t exist anywhere. In one manuscript it was originally McCammon. Maybe that scene was more meaningful to him. He describes it as being in “mid Americas” (152). To me that’s on the other side of the Mississippi. But why is he so vague about a location? JOSYPH: It’s a fascinating point, that everything else is made more real by setting it somewhere, and this is perhaps made less real to McCarthy by his not setting it anywhere. I’ve always felt that there’s a father-son scene near the end of The Gardener’s Son that is not in the film because McCarthy, who can write anything, avoided it, because being able to write everything doesn’t mean that you can bear to write everything. But there’s a lot of father-and-son-ness throughout Suttree. Where does Suttree go to jail and meet Harrogate? MORGAN: That’s on the other side of town. It was a workhouse. They have a new one now. The old building’s still there. JOSYPH: Early in the novel there’s a foreboding of Harrogate blowing himself up using underground caves for criminal intent. Do they exist? MORGAN: Yes, I’ve seen them. Knoxville’s built on all kinds of caves and caverns. There’s a popular one on the other side of the river, Cherokee Cave. It was under a couple of forts on the bluffs above the city. I brought Paulo out there and took his picture inside the cave. JOSYPH: Harrogate’s cave was meant to lead him to a bank. Is that possible? MORGAN: Yes, there were caves under downtown too. The cave-in on the street that gives Harrogate the idea—that really happened, I’ve got newspaper pictures of that. The Cumberland Hotel was on Cumberland and Gay,\n\nA Walk with Wesley Morgan through Suttree’s Knoxville | 43\n\nacross from the Bijou Theatre. The story is that when the hotel burned, bottles of whiskey from the bar broke and flowed down into the basement, through the caves beneath the town, and out through a spring near First Creek, so that people drank whiskey out of the spring. You can believe that or not. JOSYPH: One of the themes of Suttree is that life has an underworld to which you connect at your own risk, but if you don’t, that’s also a risk. Suttree connects with it in every way possible. He really wants to put himself through it, even if he has to beat himself up—and here he’s in a city that is built on all of these underground connections, so that even the psychological stream running through the novel connects to a physical reality. MORGAN: Yes. Even the scene of Harrogate in the watermelon patch. I got contacted once by a writer about Suttree. He said that he knew where that story about Harrogate screwing watermelons came from. One of his old fishing buddies used to tell the story in bars around Knoxville. So I called this guy up. It was a challenge to know how to phrase my questions. I don’t know how I had the chutzpah to ask him if it were a true story. Years of clinical practice, I guess. I said: “I’ve been told that you used to tell some stories in the bars around Knoxville.” Yes, he liked to tell stories. I said: “There’s one particular story about watermelons.” “Yeah.” “Can you tell me about that?” He said: “Wait a minute—let me see if my wife is around. Okay, she’s in the other room.” I said: “The story I had heard is about screwing watermelons.” He said: “Yeah, it wasn’t easy to get a piece in those days. I was raised out in the country. It was a long way between houses. We had to put our imaginations to work. Necessity is the mother of invention. It’s just what I did.” I said: “O—it was actually you?” He said: “O yeah. You know, it wasn’t any easy kind of thing to do. You didn’t want to get caught doin’ that, so you didn’t want to go out there in the middle of the day, screwin’ watermelons. But if you go too late at night, the watermelons are cold.” I said to myself: “There’s somebody who knows what he’s talking about.” I’m pretty confident that McCarthy heard it either firsthand or secondhand from this guy. JOSYPH: Talk about a writer not wasting anything! MORGAN: One of the stories I’ve heard about McCarthy is that he constantly took notes. JOSYPH: He must have. Every writer has to. But where the hell are his notebooks?\n\n44 | cor m ac\n\nm c ca rth y ’s hou se\n\nMORGAN: I was hoping to see some of them in the Wittliff Collections when I went to San Marcos. They’re not there. JOSYPH: If you read the early Whitman notebooks, you can find the exact page on which he begins to become Whitman: the first few lines of what we call “Song of Myself.” Prior to that, that Whitman doesn’t exist. In manuscripts for Cities of the Plain—the original screenplay, before the Border Trilogy— you can find the exact page on which the Wolf Trapper section of The Crossing begins. It’s a shift in how McCarthy has Billy answer the question whether he’s seen a live wolf: first it’s a no, then an addendum is made in which Billy says yes, and clearly that’s the origin of the story. Imagine having the notebooks for early Suttree.\n\n2. The Wesley Track (Next day, walking to Pete’s luncheonette on Union Avenue, where Morgan often encounters McCarthy’s brother Dennis) JOSYPH: Here’s my proposal about the cemetery. After he buries his son, Suttree is picked up by the local sheriff, driven to the bus station, and given five dollars to get out of town. Suttree gets off at Stanton, Tennessee, with three\n\nA Walk with Wesley Morgan through Suttree’s Knoxville | 45\n\ndollars left. Go westward, northward, southward from Stanton as far as you could for two dollars in 1951. How you find an old pricing chart— MORGAN: Yes, that’ll be a challenge. And that’s assuming that Cormac did it, and didn’t make it all up. (Entering Pete’s, Wesley is greeted by one of the waitresses) TISHA: Is it Friday? MORGAN: Not yet. TISHA: Are you sure? MORGAN: I hope not. (At Morgan’s table, second from back) JOSYPH: Two dollars worth of distance on a bus. What do you think? MORGAN: He bought whiskey out of the five too, didn’t he? JOSYPH: No, he bought whiskey out of the three. He travels on the two as far as Stanton. TISHA: (To Morgan) What brings you out during the week? JOSYPH: What brings him out is that I’ve dragged him out. The poor man is sick. His wife is sick. I’ll be the death of him. If you don’t see him again, it’s because I wore him out. (To Morgan, reading from Suttree) “He left the bus in Stanton Tennessee with three dollars still in his pocket” (158). I’m now on the Wesley track: I don’t think he made it up. Could be some small cemetery where the name wouldn’t show, but if you find the town. . . and if you do, I’ll drive there with you. We’ll be the only two people to visit the cemetery who don’t have someone buried in it. Here’s the "
