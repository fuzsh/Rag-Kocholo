        "text": "What is a novel in dramatic form? To the untrained eye, it looks very much like a play script. Indeed, The Sunset Limited was performed on stage by Chicago’s Steppenwolf Theatre Company in 2006 and it’s currently being made into a film starring Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L Jackson. Cinematically, it’s unlikely to offer much in the way of a visual feast: there are just two characters, Black – who is black – and White – who is white – and the action all takes place inside the tenement building where Black lives.\n\nIf there is a certain crassness in the naming of the two characters, Cormac McCarthy neatly subverts it by having Black as the cheery optimist while White is an irredeemable misery-guts. It soon becomes clear that Black has stopped White – a professor – from throwing himself in front of a subway train and taken him back to his apartment. There, he talks to him about the power of love and about his own religious conversion. Once, Black served time in jail for murder but God, he says, spoke to him setting him on a new path.\n\nBut White doesn’t believe in being saved – or in anything else. 'The things I loved were very frail,’ he tells Black. 'They don’t exist anymore.’ Any hope that Western civilisation may have had of tipping itself into moral credit 'went up in smoke in the chimneys of Dachau’. However, the chucklingly ebullient Black doesn’t just believe in redemption: he believes it’s his task to save White, to stop him from trying to kill himself again. Periodically, White tries to leave – albeit pretty half-heartedly – but Black persuades him to stay. To carry on listening.\n\nThere is both a richness and a sparseness here that will be familiar to McCarthy admirers. In theme and to some extent in tone, The Sunset Limited bears a close resemblance to his 2008 novel, The Road. The two books are effectively saying that everything is shot to hell and nothing is worth fighting for anymore. It’s all over bar the wailing.\n\nBut whereas The Road gave its readers some glimmer of hope, this holds out no consolation at all. Finally, White leaves, unmoved by Black’s arguments. Plainly, he’s off to finish the job he started earlier. Black, meanwhile, is left hurling questions at God, realising they will never be answered. He’s on his own. Movingly, and with a savage sort of glee, McCarthy draws down the darkness upon Black."
