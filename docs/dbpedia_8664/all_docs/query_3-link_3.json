Jackson\n\nMusic byMarco BeltramiCountry of originUnited StatesOriginal languageEnglishProductionExecutive producerTommy Lee JonesProducerBarbara A. HallCinematographyPaul ElliottEditorRoberto SilviRunning time91 minutesProduction companyHBO FilmsOriginal releaseNetworkHBOReleaseFebruary 12, 2011 ( )\n\nThe Sunset Limited is a 2011 American drama television film directed by Tommy Lee Jones, who also stars with Samuel L. Jackson. It was the duo's second collaboration, after the 2000 film Rules of Engagement. The screenplay was written by Cormac McCarthy, based on his 2006 play of the same name.\n\nThe film is about the relationship between a Christian African American who has a positive view of life and a nihilistic White man with a very negative view.\n\nThe film aired on HBO on February 12, 2011, and received generally favorable reviews.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nBlack and White converse about White's attempted suicide. White feels as though everything ends up in death, and that his life is minuscule in the throes of time.\n\nFrom White's point of view, no matter how great someone or something is, all that is created eventually fades away. This is the opposite of what Black believes. He believes that there is a God and that we all must go through the troubles of life to get to paradise (Heaven). By his own account, his story is that of a man who has committed murder and was far away from God, but has now changed.\n\nBlack feels that he can dissuade White from committing suicide. With Black stopping White right before he was about to kill himself, Black feels that this is destiny. In the end, Black is not able to dissuade White from suicide; he lets him leave the apartment. When White leaves, Black is left pondering why God would put him in a position to save this man's life knowing that there is nothing that he can do to stop White from going through with the suicide.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nSamuel L. Jackson as Black\n\nTommy Lee Jones as White\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 68% approval rating based on reviews from 28 critics. The website's consensus reads, \"The Sunset Limited's ambition is undercut by arch dialogue and a claustrophobic setting, but Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson's dueling performances bring heft to this battle of wills.\"[1] On Metacritic, it has a score of 67 out of 100 based on reviews from 15 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[2]\n\nVerne Gay of Newsday praised the film and called it \"grim, but a chance to see two magnificent actors at the peak of their powers.\"[3] Mike Scott of The Times-Picayune called the film \"A thinking man's drama that rolls deep, heavy thoughts around and around, trying to puzzle out where the truth lies. Or, indeed, if what we see as the truth is just that: a lie.\"[4]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
