        "text": "Set in the nineteenth-century American Southwest, Cormac McCarthy’s Blood Meridian rewrites the conventions of the western genre through a historically informed fictionalized account of the Glanton gang. As part of McCarthy’s subversive literary oeuvre, the novel intends to deromanticize the western’s underlying myths and dismantle its binaries, as well as to expose the brutality of the frontier and reflect on violence as a historiographic condition. Within studies of the western, McCarthy’s work, and transgressive literature, this article wishes to contribute to the existing discussions of McCarthy’s writing by examining Blood Meridian as a critical postmodern western or anti-western, and analyzing its strategies of demythologizing the West and the western.\n\nThe Road is a devastating yet surprisingly beautiful novel that raises many questions relating to our temporal presence on this planet and our ultimate destiny. McCarthy successfully utilises a variety of themes to deliver his message and generates ideas using simple, pared back prose to great effect. In fact the narrative contains so much inspiration that a single essay, such as this, is inadequate to fully address the issues arising. Instead a general exploration of the work is presented with the intention of encouraging further study.\n\nAmerican novelist Cormac McCarthy is a contemporary writer with notable works like Blood Meridian, All the Pretty Horses, No Country for Old Man and in particular his Pulitzer Prize winning novel The Road which was published in 2006. The critical reception of The Road has often tended to identify the novel as a post-apocalyptic, namely, it depicts a man and a boy in a bleak, desperate, catastrophic atmosphere, in a land deprived of civilization and culture. In addition to building up effects of post-apocalyptic fiction, the novel also has some features that could be attributed to postmodernism. Postmodernism is a late twentieth century movement characterized by skepticism, paradox, paranoia, irony and a general suspicion of reason as post war period makes it hard to allow any single defining source for truth and reality in an already fallen world. Accordingly McCarthy portrays such a world that values like humanity, morality gain paradoxical dimensions. In a desolate world where it is hard to attribute meaning to life itself, the man and the boy's strife to hold on to life through a metaphor of fire and belief in God equals to postmodernism's critical usage of irony in some conventions. Looking through such a perspective, McCarthy's work could be analyzed within the framework of the postmodern textual and stylistic features employed in the novel, exploring the ways in which the writer puts less reliance on traditional narrative form-through narrative strategies such as fragmentation, mingling of the past and present by means of recollected memories and dreams-and in doing so, raises questions on the issue of truth and existence in a dead world engulfed by constant state of paranoia and suspicion.\n\nIn this article, I argue that the character of Judge Holden in Blood Meridian ought to be regarded as the fictional author of the novel, and that the kid ought to be considered a sign of the reader of Blood Meridian within the text of Blood Meridian itself. I argue further that the particular challenge the novel presents its kid-as-reader, the act of critical judgment that it requires this figure to perform, is that of apprehending the judge, of judging him. I then argue that the difficulty of accomplishing such an act of judgment is due to the fact that it threatens to repeat the acts of judgment already performed by the judge in the novel, with the implication that if the reader is to avoid doubling such a regime of judgment and its specifically scriptural violence, then this judgment must be performed in a manner that is different to the judgment meted out by the judge in the novel. I conclude my argument by affirming the necessity of an ethics of reading that is in exception to the judge’s regime of textual violence, and offer a reading of the novel that demonstrates what such an ethics of reading may look like in practice."
