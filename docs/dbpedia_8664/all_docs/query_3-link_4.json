        "text": "Sunset Limited Amtrak trains travel between New Orleans and Los Angeles with stops in Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California. There are many cultural and fun attractions to visit along the route, or stay on board for unique desert and swamp views. Two levels tall, the trains use Superliner rail cars and have a sightseer lounge available to all passengers. Sleeping accommodations are also available at an extra cost.\n\nFun fact: The route is based on the oldest-named route in the United States; the Southern Pacific Railway provided similar rail service starting in 1894. Then like now, enjoy stunning mountain, desert and lake views as you travel across the country.\n\nThis website is reader supported and not affiliated with Amtrak.
