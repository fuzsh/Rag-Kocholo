        "text": "Boston Globe // Getty Images\n\nAs co-writer of “Good Will Hunting,” by the late 1990s Ben Affleck was already known for his staunch defiance of preconceived notions. He put any remaining doubts to rest with the rollout of his first three directorial features. What began in 2007 with “Gone Baby Gone” carried through to “The Town” and reached new critical heights with the Oscar-winning drama “Argo.” You may also like: Movie Trivia for the Top 100 Films of all Time\n\nHulton Archive // Getty Images\n\nSynergizing her many talents, Barbra Streisand co-wrote, directed, produced, and starred in 1983's “Yentl,” also performing some of the film's hit soundtrack. \"Yentl\" tells the story of a young Jewish woman (Streisand) who enters exclusive religious training under the guise of a man. As a result of her work, Streisand became the first (and, until recently, the only) female to win a Golden Globe for Best Director. She would later helm “The Prince of Tides” and “The Mirror Has Two Faces,” both of which were nominated for Oscars.\n\nBettmann // Getty Images\n\nBarring a few exceptions, Hollywood directors are often only as good as their ability to work with actors. Accordingly, actors themselves may seem particularly suited for the job of director. It's a transition much easier said than done, however, and one that tends to yield more misses than hits. Indeed, one needs to look no further than “The Jesus Rolls” to grasp that John Turturro is certainly no Coen brothers. Then again, most directors can't really act, with few even bothering to try. Yet an impressive number of actors have stepped behind the camera and proven themselves adept. Clint Eastwood, for example, has earned more Academy Awards and nominations for his work as a director than he has as an actor. Ben Affleck and Greta Gerwig appear to be following suit, with several major directorial efforts under their respective belts and more on the way. Who else has made the transition and yielded a great film in the process? Let's find out. Stacker researched multi-hyphenates, choosing 25 actors who have directed one great film. To be included, the actor had to have directed at least one movie with an IMDb user rating over 6.5 and a Metascore of over 65.

She put similar skills to use when crafting and starring in the atypical rom-coms “Two Days in Paris” and “Two Days in New York.” The films are among a number of directorial efforts from Delpy, who's been working in show business since the age of 14."
