        "text": "Beatty is one of very few people left in Hollywood who actually makes political movies about politics as well as about politicians. He is, after all, the man who dared to make Reds, an epic about lost-generation American Communists. What's trickier than his economic politics, though, is Beatty's handling of race. Like Norman Mailer's, Beatty's attitude toward poor blacks is one of both fascination and condescension. On the one hand, black culture saves Bulworth's soul. On the other, in this little fable, Bulworth is able to pacify a posse of aspiring gangstas by buying them all ice-cream cones and an inner-city drug lord decides to give up crime and rebuild his community after hearing Bulworth work the drug dealer's political views into a speech. Worst of all, Amiri Baraka plays a tired Hollywood clich√©: a homeless black sage.\n\nBut while all the great-white-hope dreaming rankles, it's still enormously satisfying to watch Bulworth use his clout to make a racist policeman apologize to one of the homeboys. In fact, it's so rare for Hollywood to seriously tackle race at all that it's a relief to see Beatty unrestrained by PC squeamishness. At one point, Bulworth sums up his philosophy this way: \"Everybody just gotta keep fucking everybody else till we're all the same color.\" And it's hard to argue with that.\n\nBulworth (R; 107 min.), directed and written by Warren Beatty, photographed by Vittorio Storaro and starring Warren Beatty.\n\n[ San Jose | Metroactive Central | Archives ]"
