        "text": "It may be no coincidence that Warren Beatty is playing famed Hollywood recluse Howard Hughes in his latest film, \"Rules Don't Apply,\" since Beatty is something of a recluse himself.\n\nThe film marks the first time in 15 years Beatty has appeared in front of a camera -- 2001's \"Town and Country\" was the last outing -- and nearly 20 years since he was in the director's chair. The last film Beatty directed was 1998's political satire \"Bulworth,\" co-starring Halle Berry.\n\nWatch the first trailer for interracial marriage drama \"Loving\"\n\nWith \"Rules Don't Apply,\" Beatty returns to both jobs, directing the film and starring as Hughes, famously portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in \"The Aviator.\" And from the looks of the film's first trailer, this take on Hughes will be a bit more lighthearted.\n\nThe film is a comic romance about an aspiring actress (Lily Collins) and one of Hughes' drivers (Alden Ehrenreich) pursuing their dreams in 1950s Hollywood. Beatty has enlisted a slew of famous friends to round out the supporting cast, including Annette Bening, Alec Baldwin, Candice Bergen, Matthew Broderick and Martin Sheen.\n\n\"Rules Don't Apply\" hits theaters November 23, 2016."
