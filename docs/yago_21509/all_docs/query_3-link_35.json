        "text": "There's a reason Warren Beatty has been nominated for a total of 13 Academy Awards in various capacities (acting, directing, writing, producing) throughout his career. He makes good movies, the best of which are challenging and take risks.\n\nSuch is the case with \"Bulworth,\" a top-notch political satire that skewers the current state of politics and its rather shady relationship with big-money groups and the media. Like his 1981 film \"Reds,\" this is a movie that only Beatty could have made. In \"Bulworth,\" which Beatty directed, co-wrote, produced and stars in, Sen. Jay Billington Bulworth is campaigning across California. He was once a staunch liberal in the mold of Bobby Kennedy, but now his campaign has grown stale from his allegiance to special interest groups, redundant campaign commercials featuring such sound-bite phrases as \"We stand at the brink of a new millennium\" and various other maladies. As the film opens, Bulworth is watching his commercials. He hasn't eaten or slept in days, and he's suffering a nervous breakdown. Tired of the process, Bulworth takes out a huge life insurance policy on himself in which his daughter is the beneficiary. He then arranges for a hitman to assassinate him along the campaign trail. His first stop is at a black church where he's questioned about the promises he and other politicians made during previous elections. Bulworth's response: The bitter truth. He tells the people they will never have the financial means to be a part of the political process. Later, he attends a Hollywood function where he tells a group of studio executives that their films are terrible. That night, he goes to a party in Compton where he meets a young lady (Halle Berry) and begins to embrace the rap hip-hop culture. The next day at a fund-raiser, Bulworth raps to his supporters. The first hour is extremely funny. There are so many ways Beatty could have stepped wrong, but he keeps on course. Later, Beatty gets a little more serious in his commentary about the state of political affairs, but he keeps the movie funny and loaded with bite. The performances are all strong. Oliver Platt is hilarious as Bulworth's frantic campaign manager who turns to cocaine once his candidate goes off the deep end. Berry is attractive and well-used. Still, everything hinges on Beatty and he uses his considerable (and underrated) comic strengths brilliantly. Beatty isn't afraid to look foolish as he dances around, trying to rap. As with most Beatty films, he has attracted top technical talent, and the film looks great. Like \"Network\" many years ago, \"Bulworth\" is an angry cry at a political world in which concepts such as conservatism and liberalism no longer have meaning as ideologies, and Republicans and Democrats are slavish pawns to the same big-money groups (and Beatty isn't afraid to name companies, either). It's also Beatty's best film since \"Reds\" and could very well be his most influential since 1967's \"Bonnie and Clyde.\" Rating: 4 stars."
