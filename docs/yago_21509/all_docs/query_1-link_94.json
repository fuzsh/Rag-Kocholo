        "text": "Dear Cinephiles,\n\n“If you were mine, I wouldn’t share you with anybody or anything. It’d be just you and me. We’d be the center of it all. I know it would feel a lot more like love than being left alone with your work,” says Eugene O’Neill (played by Jack Nicholson) who is part of the love triangle in Warren Beatty’s rousing and romantic historical epic “Reds” (1981). I find myself comforted by my repeated visits to this three-hour film. I saw it when it first came out while I was living in France taking a gap year before college. The story of an idealistic American wanting to change the world filled my head with ideas. Throughout the years I’ve returned to it during difficult times in my life as a reminder not to give up on my hopes and ideals. “Reds” is Beatty’s masterwork. He toiled for years to get it on the screen, and he co-wrote the script, produces, stars and directs. Set against the backcloth of an enormous historical moment, it’s one of the most ambitious, intelligent, and romantic sweeping political sagas.\n\nThe story begins in Portland – where Louise Bryant (Diane Keaton) encounters Jack Reed – a radical American journalist who has published a series of articles about the Mexican revolution and Pancho Villa. She is married to a dentist – and when interviewing Reed – she understands how unhappy she is and that she yearns for emancipation. She leaves her husband and joins Reed in Greenwich Village, New York, where she becomes acquainted with activists and writers with revolutionary ideas like Emma Goldman and playwright Eugene O’Neill. Through her writing she becomes enlightened and more restless. Reed gets involved in labor strikes of the Communist Labor Party of America. Determined to change the world, he heads for St. Louis to cover the 1916 Democratic Convention – leaving Bryant to entangle herself in a very complicated love affair with O’Neill. Eventually, Jack and Louise get married – but as the War starts they’re separated as she travels to France as a nurse and journalist. They eventually go to Russian to witness the October Revolution of 1917 when the communists seized power. He writes his famous book “Ten Days that Shook the World,” and they return to the US inspired to lead a similar revolution. This is only the first half of their journey – all taking place before the movie’s intermission.\n\n“Was that in 1913 or 17? I can’t remember now. I’m beginning to forget all the people that I used to know, you see?” utters one of the witnesses at the start of the film. Starting in 1971, Beatty captured on film about thirty real life colleagues of both Bryant and Reed – including novelist Henry Miller. They are interspersed throughout the narrative – giving us context, insight, moving the story along and setting the scene for us. “You have to be a rebel to be an artist of any kind, and everybody in Greenwich village was a bit of a rebel,” says one of them. They form a Greek chorus that adds a strong sense of historical perspective. It’s quite a powerful device – infusing the proceedings with solemnity as well as a reminder of the ruthlessness of the passage of time.\n\nBeatty’s vision is as lofty as Reed’s – and his command and voice as a director is inspiring. There are times that you don’t fully comprehend the politics, but you’re still swept up in the momentum as well as the ardor of the artist. This was obviously a passion project. I also have to hand it to him to have the chutzpah to make a film about an American communist at the height of the Cold War. He works with one of the best cinematographers – Vittorio Storaro – who won an Academy Award for his work here – as well as for “Apocalypse Now” and “The Last Emperor.” Storaro uses colors to influence our perceptions – notice his usage of white during the sequences in Provincetown – and when Bryant first meets O’Neill – he’s introduced with a blue filter. Of course, his usage of the color red in the last half of the film is symbolic.\n\nBeatty is dashing, arrogant and full of spirited enthusiasm as Reed. Keaton gives my favorite performance of hers in a very complicated role. Her character is the one we relate to the most – the point of view we follow for most of the film. Her eyes are so expressive – full of longing, frustration and so much devotion towards Reed. Keaton and Betty were dating at the time – and the production caused a strain on their relationship. Reed and Bryant’s love for one another is very palpable in this film. It’s one of my favorite romances. Jack Nicholson is haunting as O’Neill and Maureen Stapleton won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her no nonsense Emma Goldman.\n\nLouise Bryant: “I’d be a goddammed fool not to take you up on this offer. So here’s what I want. I want to sign my own names to my own stories, and I don’t want to use a double byline. I want to be responsible for my own time and my own actions.”\n\nLove,\n\nRoger\n\nReds\n\nAvailable to stream on Amazon Prime, HBO Max, Kanopy, Pluto TV, CBS All Access and DIRECTV.\n\nAvailable to rent on YouTube, Google Play, Vudu, iTunes, FandangoNOW, Microsoft and Apple TV.\n\nWritten by Warren Beatty and Trevor Griffiths\n\nDirected by Warren Beatty\n\nStarring Warren Beatty, Diane Keaton, Edward Herrmann, Jerzy Kosinski, Jack Nicholson, Paul Sorvino and Maureen Stapleton\n\n195 minutes\n\nAbout Journalist, John Reed\n\n“Born to comfortable circumstances in Portland, Oregon, Reed had gone to Harvard. Once he cast off the remnants of his bourgeois background—says Beatty, “It took me quite a while to get over the fact that he was a cheerleader at Harvard”—Reed came into his own as a journalist, poet, and radical, torn between his aspirations to art and to political activism, a conflict Beatty could relate to. And, like Beatty at the start of his career, when the actor’s dating games made him a fixture of the gossip columns and sometimes upstaged his considerable gifts as a performer, Reed had something to prove. He was too much fortune’s child—too good-looking, too well-off, too talented—to be taken seriously. Upton Sinclair once called Reed “the Playboy of the Revolution,” something else Beatty could relate to. Reed was also an adventurer, inexorably drawn to the action. And in the teens of the last century, the action was on the left, among American unions such as the Industrial Workers of the World (also known as the Wobblies) and, abroad, in places such as Mexico, where the peasants were making a revolution with machetes—and, better yet, the volcano that was czarist Russia. Reed went to Russia three times: in 1915 to cover World War I, in 1917 as a participant-observer in the Russian Revolution—he was in St. Petersburg when the czar’s Winter Palace fell—and in 1920 to plead for Soviet accreditation of his newly formed Communist Labor Party. When he wanted to return to America, the Soviets refused to let him go. He tried to cross the border into Finland and landed in a Finnish jail for his trouble. He was finally released to the Soviets, and spent what little was left of his life working in their propaganda ministry, writing and making speeches. He died of typhus in 1920, three days before his 33rd birthday.” (vanityfair.com)\n\nBringing “Reds” to the Screen\n\n“While Beatty was pitching “Reds” (which he might have described as the movie David Lean would have made had Gillo Pontecorvo, director of “The Battle of Algiers,” put a knife to his throat), United Artists was still looking down the barrel of Francis Ford Coppola’s troubled, much-delayed, and phenomenally expensive “Apocalypse Now.” Worse, UA was about to wade knee-deep into the quicksand of Michael Cimino’s studio-busting *Heaven’s Gate.*Universal, meanwhile, was still reeling from “Sorcerer,” Billy Friedkin’s expensive 1977 flop, and was about to lose a bundle more on Steven Spielberg’s…”1941.” “Reds” and Martin Scorsese’s “Raging Bull” would be exceptions that proved the rule…Beatty, who at the time was coming off the huge comedy hit “Heaven Can Wait,” which minted money for Paramount, was probably the only star with the clout (or desire) to launch a major motion picture that would dramatize the Russian Revolution from a not entirely unsympathetic perspective—and get a studio to pay for it. As former Paramount production head Bob Evans puts it in his inimitable fashion, “Warren could dictate what he wanted to make. [Reds] was his come shot after ‘Heaven Can Wait.’” Beatty recalls coming across Reed’s story in the mid-1960s. He says, “When you’re very, very young, you hear, ‘John Reed: Harvard guy gets over [to Russia] and ends up being buried in the Kremlin wall,’ and then you find out later that he traveled with Pancho Villa, so after you read “Ten Days That Shook the World,” you read Insurgent Mexico,” which was Reed’s first book. The film editor Dede Allen recalls Beatty’s mentioning the idea of putting Reed’s life on film as far back as 1966. “We were sitting in a Chinese restaurant having lunch when he said, ‘Have you ever heard of Jack Reed?’ “‘Yes.’ “‘I’m going to do his story one day.’”\n\nIn 1966, “one day” was still more than a decade off—Beatty was then in the midst of producing and starring in “Bonnie and Clyde”—but he was serious about Reed, whose story clearly had vivid cinematic potential. The actor had taught himself some Russian and in 1969 visited the Soviet Union with his then girlfriend Julie Christie. The Soviet director Sergei Bondarchuk, who had just filmed “War and Peace,” wanted to make a movie about Reed himself and asked the actor to star in it. But Beatty didn’t like the script and turned “Bondarchuk” down. Instead, Beatty told me, “I asked [the Soviet authorities], ‘Can I talk to some people who might have known Reed?’ They said there was this woman who claims to have had an affair with him. I said, ‘Can I meet her?’ They took me out to her apartment on the seventh floor of one of those temporary-looking postwar buildings. She was about 80. Her mother was close to Lenin’s wife, and there is a picture of her, at the age of 15, an incredibly beautiful little girl, standing next to Lenin. I said, ‘Did you have a romance with John Reed?’ She said to me in Russian, ‘A romance? I fucked him!’ I said, ‘Were you ever in a labor camp?’ And she said, ‘Oh, yes.’ I said, ‘How long were you there?’ She said, ‘Oh, 16 years.’ I said, ‘How do you feel about Stalin?’ She said, ‘Only hate. But of course the revolution is in its early stages.’ It was at that moment I thought, I have to make a movie about that kind of passion. I’m going to make it without the Russians. And just the way I want to make it.” In Beatty’s eyes, Reed had for too long been the exclusive property of the Soviet Union. “I felt some sort of need to protect this poor American who was buried in the Kremlin wall. His ideals were not owned by Soviet Communism.”\n\nHe worked on Reed’s story, fitfully, throughout the early 1970s, writing about 25 pages. At the time, he was hitting his stride professionally, a cinematic polymath who was able to do everything well and often did. Not only was he one of the most sought-after leading men throughout the late 1960s and the 1970s, but his love life was still manna to the gossip sheets. With “Bonnie and Clyde,” which had kicked off the New Hollywood revolution, in 1967, he had become one of the first actors to succeed at hands-on producing, so much so that on subsequent projects he was known as the equal of canny studio negotiators such as Frank Wells and Barry Diller. He produced, co-wrote, and starred in two successful comedies, 1975’s Shampoo and 1978’s “Heaven Can Wait,” the latter of which he co-directed as well, with Buck Henry. Nevertheless, according to Henry, while on the set of that film Beatty had to listen to Christie, his co-star, mock him for being lightweight. The John Reed film would be far from a comedy, and Beatty knew that if he was ever going to make it this was the time, when he had both clout and command of his craft. In 1976 he had finally found a writer for the project: Trevor Griffiths, a successful playwright whose London hit, “Comedians,” Mike Nichols was taking to Broadway. A Marxist intellectual, Griffiths wasn’t about to get his head turned by a movie star. According to Jeremy Pikser, a protégé of Griffiths’s, whom Beatty hired as a research consultant and who later went on to co-write “Bulworth” with Beatty, “Trevor felt, ‘I’m a historian, a playwright. You’re a Hollywood movie star. What can you tell me about how to tell the story of John Reed?’ I couldn’t imagine two less likely people to have an effective collaboration.” To Griffiths it was clear how much Beatty identified with Reed. “Warren spoke as if he was the reincarnation of Jack Reed,” Griffiths says. “Reed was a golden boy. I would get that sense as we talked that Warren had been born to play him. Or Jack Reed had been born so that at a later moment Warren could play him!” Griffiths’s wife was killed in an airplane crash while he was working on the script, which delayed a first draft considerably. He finally finished around the end of 1977. “Warren rang me up and said, ‘This is wonderful. This is just terrific. I’ve got to read it again,’” he recalls. “When he rang me again about it, a week later, there was a completely different tone to his voice. He basically wanted to start again, keep the outline, keep the shape, keep some of the characterizations, and begin again. And, indeed, that’s what we did.” (vanityfair.com)\n\nCasting Diane Keaton and Eugene O’Neill\n\n“Beatty…wanted Keaton to play Bryant. He regarded her as something of a muse, or at least that’s what he told the press at the time: “If Diane Keaton had not made Reds, I don’t know what I would have done.” He says now, “She’s always surprising. And that’s fun. It would have been kind of heavy going to have these two idealists go through this idealistic period without some surprises. And some laughs.” When Beatty had first asked Keaton to play Bryant, the actress was skeptical. “I didn’t really believe it was going to happen,” she recalls. “He would say, ‘We’re going to shoot now,’ and then we would not shoot now, and then he would say, ‘O.K., the next few months, probably,’ and it kept getting put off and put off for what seemed like an endless amount of time. So it really wasn’t a reality until we were actually in England, and we started to shoot. And then I believed we were doing it.”\n\nThe other key role was Eugene O’Neill, Reed’s friend and Bryant’s lover. The historical O’Neill was tall and lanky, with a boozer’s pallor. Beatty first thought of casting James Taylor, who had the look of an addict, someone who knew pain. Or Sam Shepard, of which the same was true. In the end he chose his pal Jack Nicholson, with whom he had appeared in “The Fortune” (1975) for Mike Nichols. As the story goes, Beatty tricked Nicholson into accepting the smallish but important part by ostensibly asking for advice. “I told him I needed someone to play Eugene O’Neill, but it had to be someone who could convincingly take this woman away from me,” Beatty once told an interviewer. Without missing a beat, Nicholson responded, “There is only one actor who could do that—me!” Nevertheless, says executive producer Simon Relph, “Warren worried and worried about casting Jack, because, frankly, both of them were too old to play the parts. When we met with Jack, he was doing “The Shining.” It was towards the end of the film, and Kubrick had got him into the most shambolic state. A kind of grotesque figure appeared. We only had three or four months before shooting. Warren said to me, ‘Do you think Jack can get in shape?’ I said, ‘If he wants to do it, I’m sure he can.’ He did really want to do it. When it was time, he appeared, having shed a huge amount of weight, and all the years. He was fantastic.” (vanityfair.com)\n\nAbout Writer, Director and Actor, Warren Beatty\n\nWarren Beatty was born in Richmond, Virginia. “The younger brother of actress Shirley MacLaine, Beatty played gridiron football in high school but was more interested in theatre. He attended Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, for one year before moving to New York City, where he studied with famed acting coach Stella Adler. He occasionally appeared onstage and from 1957 on television as well. In 1959 he earned a recurring role in the television series “The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis” but left the show before the first season ended to make his only Broadway appearance, in “A Loss of Roses” (1959). Beatty made a strong screen debut as a tortured teenager in love in Elia Kazan’s “Splendor in the Grass” (1961)…Beatty assigned himself the duties of star and producer for “Bonnie and Clyde” (1967)…It became a colossal hit and a milestone in cinema history, and it was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, including best picture and best actor (Beatty)…Beatty acted in only four films in the next seven years. He costarred with Julie Christie in Robert Altman’s revisionist western “McCabe & Mrs. Miller” (1971) and played the lead in Alan J. Pakula’s paranoid thriller “The Parallax View” (1974). His next big hit was “Shampoo” (1975), a comic sex romp, flavoured with a left-wing sensibility, that Beatty starred in, produced, and wrote with Robert Towne…Even more successful was “Heaven Can Wait” (1978), a showcase vehicle for Beatty’s comedic talents. For this film, Beatty was nominated for Academy Awards in four separate categories (best actor, picture [producer], writing, and direction), an unprecedented achievement in Hollywood history and an achievement he was to repeat with his next film, “Reds” (1981). “Reds” was the film that established Beatty as a serious filmmaker…the film received Oscar nominations in all the major categories and won for Beatty an Oscar for best director. He did not direct again for nine years, when he chose as his next vehicle a star-studded adaptation of the comic strip “Dick Tracy” (1990). His notable films of the 1990s included Barry Levinson’s “Bugsy” (1991), about the infamous gangster, and “Love Affair” (1994), both co-starring Annette Bening, whom Beatty married in 1992…In 1998 he cowrote, directed, and starred in “Bulworth,” …Beatty was also part of two of…”Ishtar” (1987) and “Town & Country” (2001). After a 15-year absence, he returned to the big screen with “Rules Don’t Apply” (2016)…In addition to starring as the eccentric millionaire, Beatty also wrote and directed the romance.” (britannica.com)"
