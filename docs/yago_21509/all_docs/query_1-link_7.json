In fact, idk if any major male star ever so cleverly used and subverted their public image on the screen. McCabe, Shampoo, and Bugsy, are like a trilogy of the myth of masculinity. And that's across genres. And there's Bonnie and Clyde where his lure itself is cornered and questioned. Those are four great performances, immensely charming and touched with unexpected sensitivity and humor. He's pushed himself - like Reds a palpable perf where he's driven and drained at the same time. Ishtar, alternatively, he's a childlike goof, lovable, hilarious, unafraid to look foolish. I've been impressed and surprised by all his perfs I've seen (still missing a few) except The Fortune, where he seems off.\n\nRedford, who's been in I think more than double the amount of movies, has never impressed me. He can be good, and has been a bunch, but mostly to me is an average, predictable actor. He bumps- and I'm talking frogs, folks.\n\nAs for directing, that's a closer one - but still Beatty. There's his towering Reds, the evenly poignant Heaven Can Wait, the grotesquely fun Dick Tracy, Bulworth a flawed but very interesting piece of political satire, and there's Rules Don't Apply which is half mush and half a revealing reflection of Beatty's own meek mystique.\n\nLookswise, I didn't know debates could be this easy:\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nAs an actor I think Beatty's leagues better and I'm of Pauline Kael theory on Redford that he never dug deep while making movies in an era where everyone was going deep in their acting.

Grrrrrrrr.\n\nPost by Tommen_Saperstein on\n\nQuintessential movie stars both but I've never been that impressed by Beatty outside of Reds and McCabe. Neither of these men are known for their range but Redford is sexier, more charismatic, and has the better slate of work IMO. I'll take The Sting, Three Days on the Condor and All Is Lost over any Beatty performance--McCabe perhaps being the only exception. I also appreciate that Redford turned in some of his greatest and most affecting work at the end of his career. The man aged like fine wine. Can't say the same for Beatty.\n\nPost by countjohn on\n\nAs with other people in this thread I'd say Beatty is clearly the better dramatic actor. He's been quite good a number of times. To me Redford is a great star, but just okay in terms of pure acting chops.\n\nI guess Redford for directing but it's not an entirely fair comparison since Beatty only directed like three movies. He also wielded a lot of control as a producer on a lot of his movies, like obviously Bonnie and Clyde, so you could almost say they were \"his\" even if he wasn't the director.\n\nPost by Javi on\n\nBeatty easily.\n\nRedford I suppose I just don't \"get\" as an actor. Take his recent acclaimed turn in All Is Lost for example. Absolutely nothing was going on there imo and he is the movie so there's no excuse. Not a single idiosyncrasy in sight, hardly a suggestion of an inner life, no texture... just a (dubiously) old guy withering away on a boat, yacht, whatever it was\n\nNewman vs. Beatty, now that'd be more even I think.\n\nPost by pacinoyes on\n\nBeatty easily.\n\nRedford I suppose I just don't \"get\" as an actor.

It's also why some think he's great and some don't. I wouldn't call him a \"deep\" actor and he certainly didn't challenge himself the way I wish he would have. But what he was extremely good at is simply being/existing on screen in a way that only true movie stars can be/do. No histrionics, no \"big\" moments, simply a character existing within a space with a presence that commands attention without begging for it.\n\nPost by futuretrunks on\n\nBeatty easily.\n\nRedford I suppose I just don't \"get\" as an actor.

Scott who is a lesser star) - we had that poll fairly recently too."
