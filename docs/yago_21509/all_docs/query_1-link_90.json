        "text": "Warren Beatty and Shirley MacLaine are the most unlikely celebrity siblings. They don't look, act or sound alike, and both have huge Hollywood reputations while taking separate paths in the same business.\n\nWhich one do you think is more talented?\n\nThey look somewhat alike (Shirl isn’t a real red head you know). Both have basically the same coloring (the type of fair skin you often only see with red heads, blue eyes that are small/almond shaped but wide set, and similar smiles).\n\nMore talented? I think Beatty is certainly more intelligent and I probably enjoy (most) of his best performances more than hers — he’s somewhat underrated as an actor, imo.\n\nThey are always there for each other at public tributes. I think they're quite close. It's Shirley who lives a less conventional life and is not so interested in family life. But if you've read her books, she loves her brother as much as she loves anyone. I admire her. She doesn't say things she doesn't mean. And Warren is deeply in love with his family. They are both devastatingly talented and unusually bright for showbiz folk.\n\nI enjoy Shirley much more, far better actor. I find that Warren ruins movies for me, he's so sleazy. He has the most stereotypical Baby Boomer-esque “I own the world, I want pussy” attitude. Bulworth and Bonnie & Clyde are the only things I ever enjoyed him in. He has a rather unimpressive filmography, he was the type who’s ego was too big and he only took on “passion projects” and made a film every 4-8 years. Town & Country is an abomination and still one of the biggest box office bombs of all time. Shirley has Steel Magnolias and I love The Evening Star.\n\nThose two movies were about it for Reynolds, R33. By NO MEANS was Burt a great actor or even a good actor except upon occasion. And he had the power as a top box office attraction in the 70s to buy some quality material get financing on his name and do something really above and beyond the usual crap.\n\nWhatever talent Shirley MacLaine had was overshadowed by her ability to be annoying every second of her damned life. Very unaffected and unmannered? Gee, that's a laugh.\n\n\"Redford was the golden boy from a popularity standpoint. He was the blonde Adonis but his performances lacked passion, as if he were always holding back. \"\n\nThere are actors who can stand still and let the audience see what's running through their heads without their moving a muscle. Redford was the actor who could stand perfectly still, and let the audience assume there was something running through his head. It's why he was always better at drama than comedy, in drama he could let the audience fill in the blanks, in comedy an actor actually has to do something.\n\nBeatty could do comedy, I'll give him that. He wasn't much of an actor, but he had enough superficial charm to put him over the top in the right role.\n\nR40 Paul Newman was truly the actor who could do that (and he’s a far better actor than all of the above). I’m not sure how much was actually going through Redford’s head a lot of those times. Like you said, I think the audience was doing a lot of that filling in for him.\n\nThere are a handful of performances of his that I really enjoy, though.\n\n\"Redford was the actor who could stand perfectly still, and let the audience assume there was something running through his head.\"\n\nUm, no. Even Streisand spewed that bullshit, \"there's something going on behind his eyes.\" Guess it made her believe that he wasn't ignoring her in The Way We Were. No one ever assumed anything about Redford, he was as stiff as a block and his acting was constipated. Pretty, but no sex appeal whatsoever. Moviegoers loved his looks and his peroxide, the end.\n\nWarren had a lot of sex appeal, so did O'Neal and Reynolds, though Burt was so bad as an actor he was unwatchable.\n\nI always found Beatty a very mannered, limited actor. I tried to watch McCABE AND MRS. MILLER again recently and could barely stand him - the film only comes alive when Julie Christie is onscreen. The only films where he is effective IMO are BONNIE & CLYDE, SHAMPOO (no stretch there), and to a lesser degree REDS.\n\nMacLaine is also pretty limited, really. Yes, she can be effective in drama and comedy, but her roles have generally been within a certain range. She is a good - not great - dancer (both Chita Rivera and Paula Kelly outdo her in SWEET CHARITY) and a passable singer. She did take some risks in the early 70's with films like DESPERATE CHARACTERS (where she's miscast but does pretty well) and the lousy POSSESSION OF JOEL DELANEY but when she tries to do \"character roles\" like MADAME SOUSATZKA, she's awful.\n\nOther than THE APARTMENT and TERMS OF ENDEARMENT, I liker her best in POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE.\n\nOne reason Shirley flopped in \"Sweet Charity\" is though she is a fine actress (her best talent), she was not a star dancer like Gwen Verdon, the role's originator who really was a star dancer who was a brilliant actress and an effective but limited singer because of smoking. But Shirley was a natural actress, terrific in things like \"The Apartment\", \"Gambit\", \"Some Came Running\" and \"Terms of Endearment\", among many others. Her film debut in Hitchcock's \"Trouble with Harry\" showed she was a natural with a kooky individual manner (though I wonder how original possibility Carol Haney might have been).\n\nBoth Shirley and Warren were grotesque narcissists. Apparently there mother was one too, and had little love to give them unless they achieved things. They grew up and spent their salad days being ridiculously self-centered.\n\nShirley still is--even in an industry famous for its narcissists, she stands out as a real piece of work. She is not going to be missed by many people when she dies other than gay men who liked her performances. Her daughter made very clear in her memoir what she thinks of her mother.\n\nFrom what I understand, Warren became a much more generous person once he married Annette Bening and they had children together.\n\nI believe that Shirley's New Age beliefs have cost her some popularity in Hollywood, some celebrities are wary of her, possibly including her own brother. How many UFO's can a person see in a lifetime, and in one book she even stated that President Eisenhower had a meeting with aliens back in the 1950's, and also claimed that when Hitler died his soul was put in a warehouse in the next phase of life. Reviewers of her books have not been kind to her. She seems to be a fount of information of the very strange type. She IS interesting but be a tad careful with her belief system.\n\nThey're both a hundred years old, but Shirley has had a spectacular career in film and beyond. Who the fuck is avoiding her because of her belief in past lives and UFOs? No one. She got every part for the acerbic, funny angry and unexpected woman, mother, grandmother, matriarch or dowager in your sixties and seventies that you can get. In FILMS. She was more enjoyable in all of them than Meryl is in anything.\n\nWarren doesn't know what to do. He's like Streisand. So concerned with his visage and image that he talks himself out of every good part. Once every 10 years he makes a film, vanity intact.\n\nEnjoy someone else's opinions, by all means R70. Where did I say that Shirley Maclaine was a \"great\" actress? You could check out her many talents. She's a unique performer. One of the true triple threats if maybe not the best at any one of them. But she is fantastically talented and accomplished. When she said that she deserved to win that Oscar, she wasn't wrong. Shirley can sing, dance, do comedy and drama - has been the Broadway and film ingenue of all times. Her story and life and personality and trajectory have been fantastically unique. Is she greater than Streep? No. Is she as dull and bad as Streep can be? No. It was a fucking comment you dead eyed weirdo R70. Watch her old films too. Shirley was always modern. And she's performed the world as a disciplined dancer and performer in unique stage shows. She's not the best at anything - but what other movie star does this?\n\nHer ordinariness and quirkiness and mob connections maybe worked against her. She's not a warm woman but funny and very intelligent. Few women in film are so multi talented. And yes, she is a deeply gifted actress too. Who cares what your article said R70? Streep is the most overpraised woman to ever make bad films. I imagine that's what set you off. Shirley doesn't give a rusty fuck what you think of her. She loved to perform. They do it for themselves you know. She's a dancer at heart. That's all showbiz without the Liza begging for applause or Meryl's fake humility for grande accolades. MacLaine is a most disciplined and appealing star. On screen.\n\nDownton Abbey work is not acting. Maggie Smith is no longer an actress either. She's a wind up hag of her greatest ticks and tricks. It's a stupid comparison regardless. Maclaine is much more American, entirely more physical and exuberant, a thoughtful actress but not a trained one. Maggie Smith shades and controls her farts. She's great on stage, but way too broad on screen. All those ticks and twitches, the swoop of her vulturous voice, the ridiculous crank of her neck mechanism. MacLaine is for the most part a far more natural and surprising actress. She's quite inspired a lot of the time. Just because she's not a tragedienne, doesn't make her a lightweight. There's pathos in her movement, seriousness in her small expressions and a sizable intellect in her approach to work. She's the star of one of the greatest tearjerkers of all time - and how she builds that performance is why she earns the tears. It's unclockable. And foolproof. To this day.\n\nPlus she was around in the 70s and 80s to make a few interesting choices that no one saw. I'm all for Shirley. So many old gays here with mommy issues. Judge her on her work. If you can separate actresses from you mommy.\n\nI always thought Shirley was one of the most dependable actresses out there. You knew that she'd at least give an entertaining performance even if the material wasn't great. I can't imagine anyone else playing Aurora in Terms of Endearment.\n\nAnd for all the stink about her not being a star dancer in Sweet Charity, she's one of the better examples of star casting in a big Hollywood stage to screen adaptation. She sings and dances the role very well and better than any other star would have at the time.\n\nIn real life, she strikes me as kooky and maybe a bit spoiled or self-centered at times, but not really narcissistic. Given the chances she's taken and the vanity she's shed in many of her roles, she doesn't strike me as someone who only makes movies to go on an ego trip. She's never done anything she wasn't capable of pulling off.\n\nI think they look alike. Now when I see Warren I can’t help but see Shirley in his face too. I like his films but I don’t find him to be a great actor. He’s serviceable in most of his films though and he picked roles well aside from a few flops I won’t mention.\n\nMy favourite films of his are “the parallax view” and “shampoo”. I’m also partial to “all fall down” but I think that’s for Brandon de Wilde’s character.\n\nI find Beatty a little hard to watch pre “Bonnie & Clyde” because he’s far too affected in his roles. I still love some of those films though but he’s often the weakest link in them acting-wise. By the time of “bonnie & clyde” he seemed more relaxed and I guess the role and the film fit him like a glove. Then in the 70s I can see his style had changed and his performances were more subtle and rivalling others at the time like Robert Redford and Paul Newman… the thing is in his early work he didn’t have a persona of his own it all felt learned and copied from others, as Hepburn would say: I could hear tick tick tick… I feel he found his own persona around the time of “bonnie”\n\nBoth are pretty limited all the way around. Beatty did manage to find someone who turned him into a father whereas Shirly sent her kid to live with her \"husband\" in Japan, so I guess he is slightly more of a human.\n\nI don't get the love for Maclaine in \"Terms of Endearment\", a predictable film (spoiler alert: the daughter dies in the end) where her innovation is to play an angry, brittle version of her old kook roles. Her subsequent roles were basically variations on this.\n\nI remember reading an interview with Shirley way back when, and the interviewer did that thing where she (or he) named people Shirley had been associated with, and she was supposed to respond with a one or two word answer describing them.\n\nWhen Warren Beatty came up, Shirley's response was \"unrequited love\".\n\nThat kind of made me sad to read. I think it was around the time of \"Terms of Endearment\" and Shirley's peak New Age kookiness. After reading that, I imagined they were somewhat estranged. In those days, you never saw them together, and they rarely spoke about each other, if ever.\n\nThe ex husband was a grifter, he roped MacLaine in and proceeded to rip her off for decades for an obscene amount of money. He lied about everything and lived a completely separate life from his wife in Japan with a side piece. Sashis' memoir is more damning against the dad when you get through it. Sashi accused dad of neglect,mental,physical and sexual abuse. Mom just wasn't there and when she was, Mom was a typical actor, self absorbed and competitive."
