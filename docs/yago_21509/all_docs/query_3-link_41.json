        "text": "One of the most ambitious challenges in Hollywood — actors doubling as directors on their films — has proved too much for Ben Affleck, who will no longer direct the coming movie, “The Batman.”\n\n“Performing this role demands focus, passion and the very best performance I can give,” Mr. Affleck said in a statement Monday night. “I cannot do both jobs to the level they require.”\n\nMr. Affleck — who will still play the title character as well as produce and co-write “The Batman” — has had solid outings as an actor-director before with films like “The Town” and “Argo,” which won the Academy Award for best picture in 2013."
