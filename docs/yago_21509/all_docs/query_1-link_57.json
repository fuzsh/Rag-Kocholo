        "text": "Henry Warren Beatty joined his parents and older sister, Shirley MacLaine, when he came into the world on this day in 1937. Beatty’s first noticeable role was on the CBS sitcom “The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis,” where he spent a short time as the resident heartthrob. His first feature, 1961’s Splendor in the Grass came soon thereafter. With longtime large aspirations, Beatty expanded his production role for his second movie, 1967’s Bonnie and Clyde. In addition to acting opposite Faye Dunaway, the actor produced the film. Both roles earned him Oscar nominations (the film was noticed for a total of 10).\n\nThroughout the years, Beatty has continued to challenge himself with roles and production credits from Shampoo (which he co-wrote and starred in) to Reds (for which he won the Oscar for Best Director). In total, Beatty’s films, including Heaven Can Wait, Bugsy and Bulworth have garnered 14 Oscar nominations. At the 2000 Academy Awards ceremony the accomplished moviemaker was honored with the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award.\n\nFactoid: In 1987 Warren Beatty hit a snag when Ishtar, the movie he produced and starred in, was deemed by critics as one of the worst ever made. Luckily he redeemed himself with such fare as Dick Tracy and a remake of Love Affair with his future wife, Annette Bening."
