        "text": "There was no one moment when Warren Beatty decided not to run for President. In the late 60's and early 70's, he was greatly distracted and intrigued by Presidential politics, working on the short-lived campaign of Robert Kennedy in 1968 and then, in 1972, for George McGovern. ''I enjoyed the tumult,'' he recalls. ''Partly it was because it didn't have to do with the work that I did.'' But he was never really tempted to run himself, for President or anything else. ''I've never seriously found it attractive,'' he says. ''Everyone who has any involvement with politics thinks about what it would be like to be stuck with having to get elected.''\n\nBeatty long ago decided he wasn't going to get stuck doing anything. He is, and has long been, a movie star, and he has used the power of that office to insure he would never have to do anything less than what he wanted to do. He would produce and direct his own movies as well as star in them. He would make movies when he wanted to -- only seven in the last 20 years. And in an era that would see the political center move to the right, he would make movies rooted in the ideas of the cultural and political left: ''Reds'' (1981), a sweeping romance about John Reed and the American Communists caught up in the Russian Revolution, and now ''Bulworth,'' a dark comedy about race and class in America, in which Beatty plays a corrupt Democratic Senator from California who, just days before an election, remakes himself as a rapping radical populist.\n\nAbout all this -- his politics, and how they find their way into his movies -- he would rather not say too much. Attention of this sort makes him squirm, and like any good politician, he dodges inquiry. Beatty is much more comfortable asking questions than answering them. ''Why do I feel like making movies instead of getting votes from people?'' Beatty asked one afternoon late last month, just a couple of weeks before ''Bulworth'' had its opening in New York and Los Angeles. He is in an empty suite at the Carlyle Hotel in New York. He is wearing all black -- black T-shirt, black exercise pants, black sneakers -- and he is munching on a carrot stick from the room-service tray. ''Well, the thought of having to buckle down and get things done in a political sense does not strike me as a thoroughly enjoyable endeavor. It's more fun to say what you think.''\n\nMuch of what ''Bulworth'' says is what Beatty thinks. ''Bulworth'' says, among other things, that America is divided by class, that elected officials serve mostly the interests of the rich and that black America has been ravaged by the globalization of the economy. This is not what the majority of Americans think or what the Democratic Party, with which Beatty has a life-long involvement, thinks."
