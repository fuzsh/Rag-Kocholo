        "text": "(born 1937). U.S. actor, producer, and director Warren Beatty’s film career included some of the brightest moments in movies as well as one of the most notorious failures in the history of the industry. As famous for his off-screen romances as his on-screen work, Beatty turned his fledgling acting career around when he assumed the duties of producer, writer, and director as well as star. Although his film debut in Splendor in the Grass (1961) was widely acclaimed by critics and viewers alike, it was not until he produced Bonnie and Clyde (1967) that he gained artistic credibility in the motion picture industry. Nominated for 10 Academy awards, the film was the first of several Beatty productions that would capture prestigious awards as well as box office dollars.\n\nHenry Warren Beaty (he added the extra “t” when he became an actor) was born on March 30, 1937, in Richmond, Virginia. Not long after his birth, his parents moved Warren and his three-year-old sister Shirley (who was to become the actress Shirley MacLaine) to Arlington, Virginia, where his father, Ira O. Beaty, was an educator, and his mother, Kathlyn MacLean Beaty, a drama teacher who directed amateur theater groups. Warren’s father taught him to read at the age of four, after which the young boy became a bookworm. He also began playing piano at a very young age. This combination of studiousness and devotion to music, as well as his shy nature, invited antagonism from local bullies, forcing his tomboyish older sister to defend him, sometimes with her fists, from harassment. At Washington and Lee High school—where his father was the principal—the shy, studious young boy developed into an outstanding athlete, becoming a football star as well as class president. Beatty turned down 10 football scholarships in favor of studying drama at Northwestern University. He left college after his freshman year, moving to New York City where he studied with the legendary Stella Adler.\n\nIn 1957, Beatty made his professional debut with a small role on a television drama. Over the next two years, he appeared in numerous television shows, including the acclaimed Studio One and Playhouse 90. He gained stage experience performing in winter and summer stock at New York area theaters. While appearing in the play Compulsion in New Jersey, Beatty was spotted by director Joshua Logan and playwright William Inge. Logan was so impressed with the young man’s performance that he arranged for a screen test in California. The test impressed executives at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) studio enough to sign Beatty to a five-year contract.\n\nWhen his first film was cancelled before work even began, Beatty borrowed money from a friend and bought his way out of the contract. He accepted a role on the television series The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, playing the role of Milton Armitage for half a season. He left the show to create the role of Kenny Baird in Inge’s Broadway play A Loss of Roses. Although the play itself did not fare well, closing after only 25 performances, Beatty’s performance impressed critics and theatergoers alike and ultimately brought him a 1960 Theatre World award.\n\nBeatty’s film debut in Splendor in the Grass was widely acclaimed by critics and the public alike. His next few films were uneven in quality, though he was continually paired with excellent actors and directors. He decided to take complete responsibility for his career by producing as well as starring in his next project. The result, Bonnie and Clyde was a resounding success. Beatty and actress Faye Dunaway portrayed the notorious bank robbers Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker with a glee that drew harsh criticism from the press for what was perceived as a glorification of violence. The controversy over the film attracted the curious public, which turned out in record numbers to see the film.\n\nWith the success of Bonnie and Clyde, Beatty’s future in Hollywood brightened. He starred in two more films before beginning a short hiatus during which he worked for Senator George McGovern’s presidential campaign. Along with his sister, who was a delegate to the 1972 Democratic convention, Beatty had developed an interest in politics in the 1960s, and he continued that interest throughout his life.\n\nBeatty scored another hit as a producer with the 1975 film Shampoo, a political satire veiled as a romp through the world of a womanizing Beverly Hills hairdresser, which Beatty co-wrote and starred in. The success of the film was countered by the disappointment of Beatty’s next project, The Fortune (1975), a black comedy that failed to generate critical or popular interest. Returning to production again, Beatty produced, co-wrote (with Elaine May), co-directed (with Buck Henry) and starred in Heaven Can Wait (1978), an update of the classic comedy Here Comes Mr. Jordan A hit at the box-office, Heaven Can Wait received nine Academy award nominations.\n\nHis interest in the life of American journalist John Reed inspired Beatty to create a film about Reed and the radical movement in the early 20th century United States. The result was Reds (1981), an epic film shot in four countries. In addition to winning the Oscar for best direction, Beatty also captured the coveted Directors Guild of America award for his work on the film.\n\nFollowing the triumph of Reds, Beatty made what is considered one of the biggest disasters in film history: Ishtar (1987). Written and directed by Elaine May, the film starred Beatty and Dustin Hoffman as a pair of bumbling musicians trapped in the intrigue of Moroccan politics. Conceived as an homage to the famous “Road” pictures of Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, the film failed to capture the latter pair’s comic spontaneity.\n\nOver the following years, Beatty conceived and produced some ambitious films, though these were not always well received. In 1992, he ended his long bachelorhood by marrying actress Annette Bening. In 1998 he wrote, produced, and directed the film Bulworth, a political satire in which Beatty starred as a politician who, using rap lyrics to drive home his political points, becomes a crusader for the people. In 2008 Beatty received a lifetime achievement award from the American Film Institute."
