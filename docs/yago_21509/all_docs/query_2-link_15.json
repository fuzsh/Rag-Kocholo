Believing his career is over, Senator Jay Bulworth (Warren Beatty) takes out an enormous insurance policy - and a contract on his own life.

With new enthusiasm to live, fueled in part by a beautiful woman named Nina (Halle Berry), Bulworth must now somehow stop the \"hit\" he has put out on himself before its too late.",

        "text": "...has a dynamic, if not revolutionary view of the political world, leavened with jokes and complete with a shock ending...\n\nJanuary 4, 2022\n\nBulworth is an angry and politically astute film. More than that, it is in many ways a liberating film.\n\nFebruary 16, 2021\n\nBeatty is to be congratulated on even attempting to prick America's conscience in these conservative times, but the real reason for seeing it is the panache with which it captures the irresistible flash and filigree of American politics.\n\nNovember 27, 2017\n\nThis charming, Capraesque political fable demonstrates the viability of Warren Beatty as writer, director and star; it's his last decent film.\n\nJune 22, 2017"
