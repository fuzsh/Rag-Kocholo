        "text": "Two days ago I regretfully passed along a Boxofficemojo report about Warren Beatty‘s Rules Don’t Apply having averaged $59 per screen in 1100 situations last Tuesday night. The hope was that things would improve once the Thanksgiving family crowd began going to the plexes. Well, maybe the numbers will uptick today and tomorrow but yesterday Rules, playing on 2382 screens nationwide, earned $285K for a $120 average. Which represented a slight decline over Wednesday’s haul of $315K and a $132 average. Again, I’m sorry.\n\nBoxoffice Mojo 11.25 update: “Rules Don’t Apply is looking rather disastrous, bringing in an estimated $285,000 on Thursday for a $600,000 two-day total from 2,382 theaters. At this point Rules Don’t Apply is looking at a three-day weekend around $2 million or so, which would make it one of the worst wide openings of all-time for a film playing in 2,000+ theaters.”"
