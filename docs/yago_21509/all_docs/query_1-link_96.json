        "text": "The Tan Aquatic with Steve Zissou\n\nWhen a bully begins to harass Chris, Peter goes to his defense, but the kid is so annoying that Peter beats him up. This is so satisfying that Peter realizes bullying is fun and begins to bully everyone in the house. Finally, Chris stands up to Peter and beats him senseless. Meanwhile, Stewie goes out without sunscreen and becomes obsessed with getting a tan. After Brian accidentally leaves him in the tanning booth for six hours, Stewie gets sunburned and fears he has cancer. While waiting for the results of his cancer screening, Stewie begins to live his life as if he had only days to live and drives Brian crazy with his demands.\n\nYou May Now Kiss The... Uh... Guy Who Receives\n\nWhile visiting the Griffins, Brian's gay cousin Jasper announces he's engaged to his partner and wants to be married in their home. But when Mayor West bans gay marriage in Quahog to cover up an unrelated scandal, Brian becomes a crazed activist and resorts to hostile ways to change the mayor's decision. Meanwhile, Lois questions her view toward gay marriage and Chris joins the extremist \"Young Republicans\" group to win a girl's heart.\n\nThe Finder\n\nThe remains of a maritime museum security guard are found in the Florida Everglades after an attempt to steal an obsolete 17th century nautical chart fragment used to find treasures. In order to solve the crime, Booth seeks out Walter Sherman (guest star Geoff Stults), a former Iraqi soldier with an uncanny gift to unearth anyone and anything. With Shermanâs help, as well as that of his colleague, Ike Latulippe (guest star Saffron Burrows), and his legal advisor, Leo Knox (guest star Michael Clarke Duncan), the team is led to a tattoo artist who points them in the direction of a tough young woman. But when the woman is found murdered with remnants of the map lodged in her remains, the team discovers centuries of history linked to the map and the suspect behind the crimes. Meanwhile, Brennan puts Shermanâs remarkable skill to the test, and Booth harbors cold feelings toward his former military comrade."
