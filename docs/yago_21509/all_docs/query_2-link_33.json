        "text": "Later, quoting Jefferson, Judson claims that he is aiming for \"a government for the greatest good to the greatest number of people.\" (It may be vague, but Jefferson said it, and that settles it.) Forming a Federal Police, Judson enlists firing squads for gangsters; his assistant Beekman (Franchot Tone) claims, \"We've eliminated the red tape to get us back to the first principles: an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\" Director Gregory La Cava, an ex-political cartoonist, stamps his approval on this dictatorship by framing the firing squad under the Statue of Liberty in the distance.\n\nWhat begins as a left-wing fantasy ends with a patriotic firing squad. Thanks to numerous close-ups on a bust of Abraham Lincoln (whom Huston played, under D.W. Griffith's direction) and much use of \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic,\" we're way ahead of the ending.\n\nYes, death comes to Judson. It comes to Paul Newman's Earl Long and to Peter Finch's Howard Beale; Tom Laughlin's Billy Jack is hauled away in handcuffs to face a capital charge; and the inevitable also arrives for Bulworth. Why is this such a powerful motif?\n\nMaybe it's the inescapability of history that makes these last acts always the same--the tragedies of Lincoln, JFK, King, RFK. It's rousing to hear \"socialism\" hollered in a mall theater, no matter what the circumstances, but what fun is it if the hollerer has to pay the ultimate price? In these populist political fantasies, it's always the same: those who speak the truth must die.\n\n[ San Jose | Metroactive Central | Archives ]"
