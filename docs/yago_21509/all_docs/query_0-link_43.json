Approximately 100 of the 2,000 release prints were made using the revamped IB Technicolor process, which makes full use of cinematographer Vittorio Storaro's expressive color palette.\n\nAwards & Nominations\n\nNominee - Best Original Screenplay, Academy Awards\n\nNominee - Gold Lion, Venice Film Festival\n\nCFS Technicolor Weekend!: In partnership with the Chicago Film Society, Technicolor Weekend! celebrates the longevity, beauty, and richness of the technicolor printing process. All presented on 35mm prints that were intended to last only through their initial runs, and have instead endured hundreds of projections, studio mergers, film exchange closures, and multiple private owners. These unlikely survivors offer us a view of what these films looked like before digital color correction and other modern restoration techniques, and are stunning examples of an incredibly complex industrial process that delighted millions.
