        "text": "Robert Redford: Beneath the golden boy veneer lurked an indie filmmaker: His first directing effort, 1980’s Ordinary People, captured four Oscars, including wins for best film and director. He’s helmed eight features since then.\n\nWarren Beatty: A notorious perfectionist, he hit his peak in 1981 with the epic Reds, which secured his directing Oscar. But its been 14 years since he last directed (Bulworth); a promised Howard Hughes project remains in development.\n\nJodie Foster: Her debut, 1991’s Little Man Tate, got respectful reviews, but her directing career has met obstacles. A dream project, Flora Plum, repeatedly collapsed, and last year’s The Beaver, starring Mel Gibson, whiffed at the box office.\n\nMel Gibson: He earned his director Oscar for 1995’s Braveheart, but his big score came with 2004’s The Passion of the Christ, which grossed $612 million worldwide. Personal problems have stalled his career behind (and in front of) the camera."
