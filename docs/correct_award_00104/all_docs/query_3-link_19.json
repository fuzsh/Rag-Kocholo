        "text": "The Juan Ramón Jiménez Distinguished Lectures and Seminars Series has since 2007 served as a forum for exceptional visiting writers and scholars whose work is centered on language, literature, philosophy, and the history of ideas in the context of Iberia and Latin America.\n\nWork threaded with the quintessential topic of Jimenez’s opus: “life, nature and the power of language and its inner life.” The invited writers/scholars-in-residence deliver a public lecture in English and offer two graduate-level workshops/seminars in Spanish on texts provided in advance to participants. Graduate students are encouraged to engage with the visitors during open office hours held throughout their residency.\n\nFor more information the public is invited to contact the Spanish Department."
