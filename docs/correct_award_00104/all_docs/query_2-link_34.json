        "text": "This is not actually a collection of poems by the Spanish Nobel laureate, it is instead a collection of aphorisms about work and writing and the quest for perfection. Juan Ramon Jimenez, with whom I was previously unfamiliar, was apparently obsessed by the thought that when he was gone all that would be left behind was his body of writings, his \"Obra\". This realization lead him to adopt a fierce work ethic and to seek perfection in his writing. His intent was not merely to leave a monument to himself but to reinvigorate Spanish writing and indeed to instill a revitalized devotion to work in the Spanish people.\n\nAphorisms are peculiar things. The Western version of Zen koans, they are intended to be brief but profound thoughts. However, their very brevity tends to work against them. Except in unusual cases, they seem alternately over broad or over obvious. In a book like this one, despite Maurer's effort to group them by themes, presenting all of Jimenez's aphorisms in clumps tends to detract from the impact that even the best of them might have had. The natural tendency in reading is to continue on to the next line; this book requires that you fight that inclination, that you instead pause frequently, that you set it aside and come back to it, in order that the ones which do grab your attention can truly be savored.\n\nHere are a few that I did like:\n\nWhen you feel hurried, walk more slowly.\n\nLet's not force things, but let everything arrive at its own moment, in its own peculiar manner,\n\nfusing its rhythms with ours.\n\nTreat the least significant things you do as though they were permanent, and they will endure.\n\nI don't want people to read everything that I have written. It is enough for some to read some\n\nthings, and others other things, reading here and there. My passion is for my readers to be here and\n\nthere in my work, but wherever their eyes rest, to find perfect beauty.\n\nOne must speak in such a way that although someone else, or many others, or an infinite number of\n\npeople, have said it before, it seems as though you said it first.\n\nA permanent state of transition is man's most noble condition.\n\nMany mistakenly think of memory as an activity, but not forgetting, as though the latter were not\n\nalso a reality.\n\nIf they give you ruled paper, write the other way.\n\nI think each of those, even if I disagree, contains a thought that is worth considering at some length. That said, by themselves they hardly justify a Nobel Prize. Of course, he won for his poetry, not for his aphorisms, but here are some of his poems that I found online; they just don't do much for me:\n\nTen Short Poems by Juan Ramon Jimenez\n\n1.\n\nRose of the Sea\n\nThe white moon takes the sea away from the sea\n\nand gives it back to the sea. Beautiful,\n\nconquering by means of the pure and tranquil,\n\nthe moon compels the truth to delude itself\n\nthat it is truth become whole, eternal, solitary,\n\nthough it is not so.\n\nYes.\n\nDivine plainness,\n\nyou pierce the familiar certainty, you place\n\na new soul into whatever is real.\n\nUnpredictable rose! you took the rose away\n\nfrom the rose, and you could give back\n\nthe rose to the rose.\n\nFrom Diario de Poeta y Mar\n\n2.\n\nto the bridge of love,\n\nold stone between tall cliffs\n\n--eternal meeting place, red evening--,\n\nI come with my heart.\n\n--My beloved is only water,\n\nthat always passes away, and does not deceive,\n\nthat always passes away, and does not change,\n\nthat always passes away, and does not end.\n\nFrom Eternidades\n\n3.\n\nThe dawn brings with it\n\nthat sadness of arriving, by train,\n\nat a station that is not one's own.\n\nHow disagreeable, those rumblings\n\nof a new day that one knows cannot last long--\n\n--Oh my life!--\n\nOverhead, as the day breaks, a child is crying.\n\nFrom Eternidades\n\n4.\n\nRosebushes\n\nIt is the sea, in the earth.\n\nColors of the south, in the winter sun,\n\ncontain the noisy shiftings\n\nof the sea and the coasts...\n\nTomorrow in the sea!--I say, rather, in the earth\n\nthat moves, now, into the sea!\n\nFrom Diario de Poesia y Mar\n\n5.\n\nFrom Dreaming\n\n--No, no!\n\nand the dirtyneck boy starts crying and running\n\nwithout getting away, in a moment, on the streets.\n\nHis hands,\n\nhe's got something in his hands!\n\nhe doesn't know what it is, but he runs to the dawn\n\nWith his hidden prize.\n\nEndlessly beforehand, we know what his trophy is;\n\nsomething ignored, that the soul keeps awake in us.\n\nWe almost start to glitter inside his gold\n\nwith extravagant nakedness...\n\n--No, no!\n\nand the dirtyneck boy starts crying and running\n\nwithout getting away, in a moment, on the street.\n\nThe arm is strong, it could easily grab him...\n\nThe heart, also a beggar, lets him go.\n\nFrom Diario de Poesia y Mar\n\n6.\n\nHow close to becoming spirit something is,\n\nwhen it is still so immensely far away\n\nfrom hands!\n\nlike starlight,\n\nlike a nameless voice\n\nin a dream, like faraway horses,\n\nthat we hear, as we breathe heavily,\n\none ear placed to the ground;\n\nlike the sea on the telephone...\n\nAnd life begins to grow\n\nwithin us, the delightful daylight\n\nthat cannot be switched off,\n\nthat is thinning, now, somewhere else.\n\nAh, how lovely, how lovely,\n\ntruth, even if it is not real, how lovely!\n\nFrom Diario de Poesia y Mar\n\n7.\n\nOn the city Ramparts of Cadiz\n\nThe sea is enormous,\n\njust as everything is,\n\nyet it seems to me I am still with you...\n\nsoon only water will separate us,\n\nwater, restlessly shifting,\n\nwater, only water!\n\nFrom Diario de Poesia y Mar\n\n8.\n\nStormclouds\n\ngive their morose faces to the sea.\n\nThe water, worked up out of iron,\n\nis a hard, flat landscape,\n\nof exhausted mines,\n\nin a state of collapse,\n\nruins.\n\nNothingness! That word, for me,\n\nhere, today, comes home,\n\nthe cadaver of a word,\n\nlaid out, naturally,\n\nin its own grave.\n\nNothingness!\n\nFrom Diario de Poesia y Mar\n\n9.\n\nMoguer\n\nMoguer. Mother and brothers.\n\nThe house, clean and warm.\n\nWhat sunlight there is, what rest\n\nin the whitening cemetery!\n\nIn a moment, love grows remote.\n\nThe sea does not exist; the field\n\nof vineyards, reddish and level,\n\nis the world, like a bright shining on nothing,\n\nand flimsy, like a bright light shining on nothing.\n\nHere I have been cheated enough!\n\nHere, the only healthy thing to do is die.\n\nThis is the way out, that I wanted so badly,\n\nthat escapes into the sunset.\n\nMoguer. If only I could rise up, sanctified!\n\nMoguer. Brothers.\n\nFrom Diario de Poesia y Mar\n\n10.\n\nLife\n\nWhat I used to regard as a glory shut in my face,\n\nwas a door, opening\n\ntoward this clarity:\n\nCountry without a name:\n\nNothing can destroy it, this road\n\nof doors, opening, one after another,\n\nalways toward reality:\n\nLife without calculation!\n\nFrom Eternidades\n\nPerhaps you find them profound and beautiful. I found them maddeningly obscure."
