        "text": "UNDER THE WATER\n\nI\n\nNo matter which poems of Juan Ramón Jiménez I had chosen, the collection would never be a heavy book, like a book of Neruda or Trakl. A single poem of Trakl’s would make a heavy book. Forty poems of Jiménez will be light as a feather. Juan Ramón Jiménez’ vision of poetry is very different from that of Neruda or Trakl. Neruda and Trakl take all their weight as men, and put that into their poems. Their love goes out as a form of occult energy into boulders, river, barges, crumbling walls, dining rooms, women’s clothes. When they step back they leave the energy there. Their poems, lie there separate from them, massive, full of grief. To Jiménez writing a poem means something entirely different. For him a poem has ecstasy: that is the difference between poetry and prose. Living as a poet means feeling that ecstasy every day of your life, every hour if possible. A poem flies out of the poet like, a spark. Whatever the poet writes down will be touched with ecstasy – the poem will therefore be light, not light in the sense of light verse that avoids seriousness, but light as a spark or as an angel is light. With one or two fewer words the poem would leap straight up into the sky.\n\nThe heavy poems of Trakl lie brooding in alleys or on mountain tops, and when the reader walks up to them they hardly notice him: they feel too great a sorrow. Jiménez’ poems on the other hand are nervous and alert and when we come near, they see us, they are more interested in us than in themselves—they try to show us the road, back to the original ecstasy. The poems are signposts pointing the reader back to the poet, that toward the life from which the ecstasy came. Juan Jiménez said that he lived his life in such a way as to most poetry possible out of it, and he loved solitude, private gardens, cloisters, silent women with large eyes.\n\nJiménez’ poems ask the question: what sort of life shall we live so as to feel poetry, ecstasy? His emphasis on how the poet lived, rather than on rhythm or technique, is precisely why so much poetry flowed from him into the young poets. In his life he embodied as Yeats did some truth about poetry that everyone, but especially poetry professors, try to ignore and do ignore.\n\nII\n\nWe can understand the subject matter of Jiménez’ poems if we understand that it is in solitude a man’s emotions become very clear to him. Jiménez does not write of polities or religious doctrines, of the mistakes of others, not of his own troubles or even his own opinions, but only of solitude, and the strange experiences and the strange joy that come to a man in solitude. His books usually consist of emotion after emotion called out with great force and delicacy, and it must be said that his short, precise poems make our tradition of the long egotistic ode look rather absurd. Seeing the beauty of a sunset, for instance, he does not, with many stanzas, complicated syntax, and involved thoughts, write a long elaborate ode on immortality-he simply says:\n\nSerene last evening,\n\nshort as a life,\n\nend of all that was loved,\n\nI want to be eternal!\n\nTranslated by Carlos Francisco de Zea\n\nThis is what he calls “naked poetry.” It is poetry near the emotion. He has a wonderful poem in which he says that, in his youth, when poetry first carne to him, she carne to him like a very young girl, naked, and he loved her. Then, later, she began to put on ornaments and become very elaborate, and he began to hate her, without knowing why. Then, years later, she began to trust him, and now, at last is a young girl, naked, again-“naked poetry, that I have loved my whole life!”\n\nIII\n\nJiménez, as a poet, was bom in the great and joyful reviving of Spanish poetry about 1905, led by Antonio Machado, Unamuno, and himself, who all dreamed of a new blossoming of Spain. Jiménez was not robust. He was delicate, neurasthenie, and slipped off into insanity more than once. Yet his devotion to poetry was healthy and rigorous. He was more generous to younger poets than Yeats was; he spent years editing poetry magazines and starting publishing ventures to get poets in print, endless afternoons poring over young poets’ manuscripts. His delight and Machado’s stubbornness prepared the way for the great generation of ’28: Lorca, Aleixandre, Salinas, Guillén. They all knew it. Lorca’ s early poems are imitations of Juan Ramón, as they always called him. Juan Ramón threw up light and airy houses made out of willows, and in so many different designs that all the coming Spanish poets found themselves living in one or another of his willow houses before they moved out to their own house. Jiménez even anticipated Lorca’s mature work. Juan Ramón Jiménez came to the United States in 1916 to marry Zenobia Camprubí, who was the sister of a man who owned a Spanish-language newspaper in New York. Jiménez lived in New York and Boston for a few months, and wrote Diary of a Poet Recently Married, a book about the United States still not well known here. Thirteen years before Lorca het met the “King of Harlem” walking up Fifth Avenue; he describes the meeting in his prose poem “Deep Night,” translated in this collection. The crippled Negro whom he calls “king of the city” is clearly the same Negro of whom Lorca said:\n\nTú, gran rey prisonero, con un traje de conserje!\n\n(Your great imprisoned king, dressed as a janitor!)\n\nAnyone who knows the work of Guillén, Salinas or Alberti will also see Juan Ramón Jiménez in their poems, seated quietly on the sandy bottom, clearly visible through the sunlit water like a magie water creature.\n\nIV\n\nBy 1940, most of the poets of that magnificent blossoming of poetry were either dead or in exile. With Rafael Alberti, Jorge Guillén, Pedro Salinas, Emilio Prados, Manuel Altolaguirie and Luis Cernuda, Jiménez went into exile. He lived for a while in Chevy Chase, Maryland, then in Puerto Rico. The American literary community ignored him, and not a book of hls had ever been published in the United States at the time he received the Nobel Prize.\n\nHis love for bis wife was one of the greatest devotions of his life and he wrote many of his poems for her. When he received the Nobel Prize in 1956, his wife was on her deathbed; he told reporters to go away, that he would not go to Stockholm, that his wife should have had the Nobel Prize, and that he was no longer interested. After his wife died, he did not write another poem and died a few months later, in the spring of 1958.\n\nV\n\nJiménez and Rubén Dario, the Nicaraguan, gave a great gift to Spanish poetry: an emphasis on pleasure. Herbert Marcuse in his Eros and Civilization talks of how many Americans are crippled because of the puritanical adherence to duty, to the reality principle. They are crippled because they are addicted to boring sobriety, harshness, duty, “responsibilities of life,” business. They think it is their duty to accept boredom in polities, to stay inside on a moonlit night, and to be miserable, selling or teaching, doing what they don’t want to do. If they avoid delight, they feel more mature. Americans are crippled because they give up, perhaps at ten or fifteen, all hope of being happy. Juan Ramón Jiménez is aware of all this-only the Spanish temperament is as puritanical as the American. His work pulls the psyche toward pleasure. His poems are an elaborate defense of the pleasure principle. He sees the humor and drama of making such a defense to day. He talks to the full moon:\n\nThe basil is not asleep,\n\nthe ant is busy.\n\nAre you going around naked\n\nin the house?\n\nROBERT BLY\n\n“VINO, PRIMERO, PURA”\n\nVino, primero, pura,\n\nvestida de inocencia.\n\nY la amé como un niño.\n\nLuego se fue vistiendo\n\nde no sé qué ropajes.\n\nY la fui odiando, sin saberlo.\n\nLlegó a ser una reina,\n\nfastuosa de tesoros . . .\n\n¡Qué iracundia de yel y sin sentido!\n\n… Mas se fue desnudando.\n\nY yo Ie sonreía.\n\nSe quedó con la túnica\n\nde su inocencia antigua.\n\nCreí de nuevo en ella.\n\nY se quitó la túnica,\n\ny apareció desnuda toda …\n\n¡Oh pasión de mi vida, poesía\n\ndesnuda, mía para siempre!\n\n“AT FIRST SHE CAME TO ME PURE”\n\nAt first she carne to me pure,\n\ndressed only in her innocence;\n\nand I loved her as we love a child.\n\nThen she began putting on\n\nclothes she picked up somewhere;\n\nand I hated her, without knowing it.\n\nShe gradually became a queen,\n\nthe jewelry was blinding . . .\n\nWhat bitterness and rage! . . .\n\nShe started going back toward nakedness.\n\nAnd I smiled.\n\nSoon she was back to the single shift\n\nof her old innocence.\n\nI believed in her a second time.\n\nThen she took off the cloth\n\nand was entirely naked …\n\nNaked poetry, always mine,\n\nthat I have loved my whole life!\n\n“INTELIJENCIA, DAME”\n\n¡Intelijencia, dame\n\nel nombre exacto de las cosas!\n\n… Que mi palabra sea\n\nla cosa misma,\n\ncreada por mi alma nuevamente.\n\nQue por mí vayan todos\n\nlos que no las conocen, a las cosas;\n\nque por mí vayan todos\n\nlos que ya las olvidan, a las cosas;\n\nque por mí vayan todos\n\nlos mismos que las aman, a las cosas . . .\n\n¡Intelijencia, dame\n\nel nombre exacto, y tuyo,\n\ny suyo, y mío, de las cosas!\n\n“INTELLIGENCE, GIVE ME”\n\nIntelligence, give me\n\nthe exact name of things!\n\n… I want my word to be\n\nthe thing itself,\n\ncreated by my soul a second time.\n\nSo that those who do not know them\n\ncan go to the things through me,\n\nall those who have forgotten them\n\ncan go to’ the things through me,\n\nall those who love them\n\ncan go to the things through me . . .\n\nIntelligence, give me\n\nthe exact name, and your name\n\nand theirs and mine, for things!\n\nMARES\n\n¡Siento que el barco mío\n\nha tropezado, allá en el fondo,\n\ncon algo grande!\n\n¡Y nada\n\nsucede!

In 1924, in La Verdad, a literary sheet from Murcia, I published several poems from my Marinero en tierra which had not yet appeared in book form. Someone told me that Juan Ramón had liked them very much. I paid him a visit.\n\nHe lived on the top floor of a house in a quiet neighborhood, a sort of penthouse. He received me there, among honeysuckles and morning glories which he himself, with his Andalusian homesickness for gardens, was guiding along the walls, and turning into fountains of leaves. That afternoon the writer Antonio Espina was with him.\n\nJuan Ramón was editor at that time of the literary review Indice and of a publishing house as well with the same name. Two books had just come out: Signario, by Antonio Espina, and Pedro Salinas’ Presagios. In his apartment, holding a copy of Signario, he complained about its typographical imperfections. He had found errata, smudged letters, sloping lines, and over all of this he would lose sleep.\n\n“In Alfonso Reyes’ edition of Góngora’s Fábula de Polifemo y Galatea he let some errata slip by him too: instead of ‘corona’ there is ‘corna’; for ‘entre’, ‘enter’, and so on. Spain had lost its tradition of great printing. Take a look at this English book. [He showed us a modern edition of Keats.] Look at the fine workmanship, and the grace, the delicacy of the type! I’d like to obtain the same results in the Indice books, but that’s obviously asking too much.”\n\nImaginary wind from the sea!\n\nStreet the sailors like-\n\nblue house, and against the his chest\n\nthe chain that works miracles!\n\nIn those days Juan Ramón’s beard was still black and rough; he had the perfect profile of the Andalusian Arab, and a soft, gloomy voice that sometimes rose into a scratchy falsetto. We talked about writing, and names from his generation came up: Pérez de Ayala, the Machados, Ortega y Gasset . . . During that visit I glimpsed for the first time-later I saw it often, throughout our friendship-the extraordinary Andalusian wit and venom that came out in making fun of people or doing imitations of them. The people I heard him laugh at most-and slander, in his poetic way-were Azorín and Eugenio D’Ors.\n\n“Have you seen the title of Azorín’s last book? El chirrión de los politicos. [The Ox Cart of the Politicians.] ‘The Ox Cart!’ I received a personally signed copy dedicated to me. Naturally, I went myself, in person, to his house to give it back to him. Azorín lives,” he continued, “in one of those houses that reek of the Madrid dish-boiled-meat-and-vegetables mixed with cat piss. He sleeps far far inside a bed whose mosquito netting is decorated with pink ribbons, and he keeps on bis night-table an object he considers to be in the most exquisite taste, a plaster of paris Negro painted black, the kind they use to advertise ‘La Estrella’ coffee, a gift from bis constituents when he was congressman for Monovar. No matter how simple the furnishings are, you can always tell a writer by his home.”\n\nHe broke off his friendship with Pérez de Ayala one day during a visit because Pérez de Ayala had showed him a room with various sausages hanging from the ceiling; for that he never forgave his friend. He noticed in José Ortega y Gasset’s home-remember the visitor is Juan Ramón Jiménez, not I-a small Venus de Milo, cast in plaster, on top of a piano, the sort of piece that sells for a few pennies in the square of Cibeles in Madrid. I believe there was also, a brass paperweight that undertook to be Don Quixote, and included a desperate Sancho Panza, shouting at the top of his lungs. These details of decoration gave occasion for biting jibes that Juan Ramón aimed at Ortega, using the details as glimpses into Ortega’s style and work.\n\nHis own home was very different. He and his wife, Zenobia Camprubí, had succeeded in keeping it with a taste and an elegance that were truly simple, natural. When Juan Ramón was working, and during this time he would work twenty-four hours of the day, it was impossible to see him; he turned away his visitors, sometimes refusing to let them in himself, The names of visitors would be conveyed to him by telephone from the porter’s lodge. Occasionally the visitor himself would speak:\n\n“This is so and so.”\n\nJuan Ramón would answer in a perfectly natural way, from upstairs: “Juan Ramón Jiménez has left me a message that he is out.”\n\nIn that sought-after solitude, he produced, polished, retouched reshuffled his work (or his Work, as he tended to call it) back and forth. In that darkroom of poetry, the poet from the country, the poet of purple and yellow sundowns, of walks with his silver burrow through the narrow streets of Moguer, worked on with the fervor of a mystic, of a solitary, listening to the circulation of his own blood, drawing out the poetry that rose from it. The poet of Arias, Pastorales, Jardines Lejanos became at this time drawing close to the flame of his work, the poet of Piedra y cielo, Poesía Belleza, Unidad.\n\nThis stanza was from one of the most transparent and lively of Juan Ramón’s poems; I had taken two lines from the stanza as an epigraph for a poem I had published in La Verdad, one of those he praised so much:\n\nblue blouse, and against his chest\n\nthe chain that works miracles!\n\nThe welcome Juan Ramón gave me, which was like the welcome he gave all the poets beginning to appear at that time, though he perhaps showed me preference over the others, was encouraging and warm, and inspired in me a faith and a self-confidence I hadn’t possessed until then. He asked me to let him see more of my things and so the next day I brought him a group of short poems from which he himself made a selection and published in SI, a review of poetry and prose he edited under the pen name of “The Universal Andalusian.”\n\nThose first poems of mine were from “Marinero en tierra (Sailor on land) a book that shortly after was given the National Award for Literature, together with Gerardo Diego’s Versos humanos. Offering me further proof of his esteem, Juan Ramón Jiménez wrote me the fine letter I have since published as a preface to my poems.\n\nIn Buenos Aires now, from my small balcony overlooking the River Plate, here among my red cardinals and my run-down pots of blackened geraniums, my memory goes northwards up the river, and takes me past the image I have of Juan Ramón in Madrid, lively-eyed in his roof-house of honeysuckles and morning glories, to the picture of the present Juan Ramón, a survivor in America of the immense Spanish catastrophe-living brother of Antonio Machado, who was a genuine piece of the earth sacrificed-like Machado he is a master, a wandering magnificent voice of our country.\n\nRAFAEL ALBERTI\n\nBuenos Aires, 1945\n\ntranslated by Hardie St. Martin\n\nJUAN RAMON JIMENEZ\n\nEn el blanco infinito,\n\nnieve, nardo y salina,\n\nperdió su fantasia.\n\nEl color blanco, anda,\n\nsobre una muda alfombra\n\nde plumas de paloma.\n\nSin ojos ni ademán\n\ninmóvil sufre un sueño.\n\nPero tiembla por dentro.\n\nEn el blanco infinito,\n\n¡qué pura y larga herida\n\ndejó su fantasia!\n\nEn el blanco infinito.\n\nNieve.
