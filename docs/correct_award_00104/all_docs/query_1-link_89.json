Instead, financialization, technological disruption, extreme inequalities and more frequent exogenous events accelerate the pace of change while making it more erratic. In this new world order, average no longer exists and standard deviations become meaningless. And as disoriented public sectors respond to conflicting and violent changes, investors and policy makers will likely swing from shortage to abundance, from inflation to deflation, from growth to recession, from calm to extreme volatilities, and from predictability to unpredictability. Unfortunately, the social cohesion will be a major task for politicians and governments globally, and investors should expect: (1) secularly higher bond yields, (1) moderately higher inflation (on average), (ili) much more volatile inflation, (iv) more frequent recessions, (v) higher average GDP growth, (vi) faster wage growth, (vi) a lower profit share, (vili) narrowing inequality.\".",
