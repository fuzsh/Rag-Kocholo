        "text": "Born. To Tenor Dennis Day (real name: Eugene Denis McNulty), 41, and Peggy Almquist McNulty, 34: their fifth son, seventh child; in Los Angeles. Name: Thomas Francis. Weight: 8 lbs. 13 oz.\n\nMarried. Marjorie Lord, 35, Comedian Danny Thomas’ TV “wife”; and Randolph Hale, 44, West Coast stage producer; both for the second time; in Los Angeles.\n\nDivorced. George (“Fanny”) Hearst, 54, eldest son of the late publisher, William Randolph Hearst, vice-president of the Hearst publishing empire; by Collette Lyons Hearst, 46, sometime actress, his fifth wife; after six years of marriage; no children; in Santa Monica, Calif.\n\nDied. Lionel Sebastian Berk Shapiro, 50, Canadian novelist, longtime foreign correspondent; of cancer; in Montreal. A top moneymaker among Canadian authors, Shapiro seined his best haul in 1955 when the Book-of-the-Month Club picked up The Sixth of June, the story of a love affair and its relationship to the invasion of Normandy, which also won the Governor General’s award for fiction, became a Hollywood movie.\n\nDied. Samuel Cardinal Stritch, 70, Archbishop of Chicago; in Rome (see RELIGION).\n\nDied. Juan Ramón Jiménez, 76, expatriate Spanish poet who won the 1956 Nobel prize for literature; of pneumonia; in San Juan, Puerto Rico. When the Nobel announcement came from Stockholm, it rattled the ice in U.S. literary tumblers because few readers had ever heard the name. Editorial researchers scrambled, learned that Poet Jiménez was known from Aragon to Argentina as a kind of melancholy, Andalusian A. A. Milne, particularly for Platero y Yo,* a collection of prose vignettes spoken by the poet to his burro about life and death in a Spanish town (TIME, Aug. 19, 1957). At the outbreak of civil war, Jiménez and his Vassar-educated wife (translator of Indian Poet Rabindranath Tagore) left Spain, lived thereafter in the U.S., Cuba and Puerto Rico, where she died three days after he won the Nobel prize, plunging him into a depression from which he never recovered.\n\nDied. Alfred Edward Webb-Johnson, Baron Webb-Johnson, 77, onetime (1941-49) president of Britain’s Royal College of Surgeons, longtime (1936-53) personal surgeon to the late Queen Mary; in London. When the stricken Rudyard Kipling was rushed to the Middlesex Hospital in early 1936, Webb-Johnson operated for a perforated ulcer, but was unable to save the patient.\n\n* Two U.S. translations made quick appearances, were published simultaneously in 1957."
