        "text": "From the Publisher\n\nDos Poemas De Juan Ramon Jimenez are settings of two poems by the Spanish Nobel Prize-winning poet, arranged for either Voice and Flute, or Voice and Piano (one hand). Written c. 1959, they were first performed in December 1962 in Valencia. A perfect gift for any young singer looking for quirky but easy performance pieces. Joaquin Rodrigo (1901-1999) was born in Valencia, and lost his sight to diphtheria at the age of three, which is believed to have heightened his hearing and inspired him to pursue a musical career. He began to study music five years later, and became one of Spain’s most distinguished composers, musicologists, and pedagogues."
