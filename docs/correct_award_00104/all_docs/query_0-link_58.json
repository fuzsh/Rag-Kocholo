Santiago Ramón y Cajal (1852-1934), Nobel laureate in Medicine in 1906, was the first president of the JAE (Junta para Ampiación de Estudios) and his prestige and influence were present in all the scientific and cultural centers founded by the institution. He maintained a close relationship with the Residencia (as shown by the only film images that remain of him sitting in front of the Central Pavilion). He taught scientists such as Pío del Río Hortega and Juan Negrín. The resident Severo Ochoa (1905-1993), who received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1959, was an assistant to Juan Negrín in his laboratory at the Residencia, where he lived until 1931. Juan Ramón Jiménez (1881-1958), Nobel laureate in Literature (1956), lived in the Residencia between 1913 and 1916. He helped design the gardens of the Poplars Hill (as he called it) and directed its publications. In 1977, the Swedish Academy awarded Vicente Aleixandre (1898-1984) the Nobel Prize in Literature as a member of the Generation of ‘27. He taught a course at the Residencia in 1920 and participated in many of its activities as a member of the Sociedad de Cursos y Conferencias."
