        "text": "Earl (Bertrand Arthur William) Russell awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature \"in recognition of his varied and significant writings in which he champions humanitarian ideals and freedom of thought\".\n\nThe first Elliott 152 computer appeared\n\nZuse sold first Z4 computer\n\nAt a Cold Spring Harbor Symposium, Ernst Mayr argues that all hominid specimens so far found should be categorized in the genus Homo: H. transvaalensis, H. erectus, and H. sapiens.\n\nE. Chargaff lays the foundations for nucleic acid structural studies by his analytical work. He demonstrates for DNA that the numbers of adenine and thymine groups are always equal and so are the numbers of guanine and cytosine groups. These findings later suggest to Watson and Crick that DNA consists of two polynucleotide strands joined by hydrogen bonding between A and T and between G and C.\n\nE. M. Lederberg discovers lambda, the first viral episome of E. coli.\n\nAll about Eve wins Academy Award for best picture. Three of the years five best picture nominees were dominated by great female performances: Born Yesterday, Sunset Blvd. and All About Eve. But Joseph Mankiewiczs witty tale about Broadway competition was the one that ended up in the winners circle.\n\nPär Fabian Lagerkvist awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature \"for the artistic vigour and true independence of mind with which he endeavours in his poetry to find answers to the eternal questions confronting mankind\".\n\nPainting by Salvador Dalí: Christ of Saint John of the Cross depicts Jesus Christ on the cross in a darkened sky floating over a body of water complete with a boat and fishermen. Although it is a depiction of the crucifixion, it is devoid of nails, blood, and a crown of thorns, because, according to Dalí, he was convinced by a dream that these features would mar his depiction of Christ. Also in a dream, the importance of depicting Christ in the extreme angle evident in the painting was revealed to him.\n\nOn May 24, a mob of 3500 whites attempt to prevent a black family from moving into an apartment in Cicero, Illinois. Illinois Gov. Adlai Stevenson calls out the Illinois National Guard to protect the family and restore order.\n\nOn May 24, the United States Supreme Court rules that racial segregation in District of Columbia restaurants is unconstitutional.\n\nFerranti Mark 1 delivered to Manchester University\n\nLEO I computer became operational\n\nThe first UNIVAC was delivered\n\nUNIVAC-1 goes online\n\nBarbara McClintock publishes a paper describing \"jumping\" genes that can move around within an organism's genome.\n\nAn American in Paris wins Academy Award for best picture. This Vincent Minnelli musical starring Gene Kelly, was a surprise winner. Producer Arthur Freed took home the Oscar, starting the Academys new policy of giving the award to an individual producer, rather than the studio. After Gone with the Wind, this was the second best-pic winner in color.\n\nFrançois Mauriac awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature \"for the deep spiritual insight and the artistic intensity with which he has in his novels penetrated the drama of human life\".\n\nPainting by Jackson Pollock: Number 11, 1952, also known as Blue Poles, is one of the most famous works by American artist Jackson Pollock. It was purchased amid controversy by the National Gallery of Australia in 1973 and today remains one of the gallery's major paintings. At the time of the painting's creation, Pollock preferred not to assign names to his works, but rather numbers; hence, the original title of the painting was simply \"Number 11\"' or \"No. 11\" for the year 1952. In 1954, the new title Blue Poles was first seen at an exhibition at the Sidney Janis Gallery and reportedly originated from Pollock himself. According to art historian Dennis Phillips, the specific rather than ambiguous title \"limits our field of comprehension and does the painting a singular disservice. Because we look for the poles and miss much of the rest, the name is simply too distracting.\"\n\nCBS News Uses UNIVAC Computer to Predict Election\n\nGrace Hopper completes the A-0 Compiler\n\nHeinz Nixdorf founded Nixdorf Computer\n\nBwana Devil, a low-budget polarized 3-D film, premieres in late November and starts a brief 3-D craze that begins in earnest in 1953 and fades away during 1954.\n\nA. D. Hershey and M. Chase demonstrate that the DNA of phage enters the host, whereas most of the protein remains behind.\n\nF. Sanger and his colleagues work out the complete amino acid sequence for the protein hormone insulin, and show that it contains two polypeptide chains held together by disulfide bridges.\n\nJ. Lederberg and E. M. Lederberg invent the replica plating technique.\n\nN. D. Zinder and J. Lederberg describe transduction in Salmonella.\n\nRussian geologist Boris Sokolov establishes the term Vendian. Based on rock strata in the Soviet Union, it designates the period immediately preceding the Cambrian, coinciding with fossils found near the Ediacara Hills.\n\nThe Greatest Show on Earth wins Academy Award for best picture. Director Cecil B. DeMille was a showman since the silent days of movies, but this was his first to take the Best Picture Academy Award, with his colorful and gaudy spectacle about life in the circus.\n\nSir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature \"for his mastery of historical and biographical description as well as for brilliant oratory in defending exalted human values\".\n\nPainting by Francis Bacon: Study after Velázquez's Portrait of Pope Innocent X shows a distorted version of the Portrait of Innocent X painted by Spanish artist Diego Velázquez in 1650. The work is one of a series of over 45 variants of the Velázquez painting which Bacon executed throughout the 1950s and early 1960s. The picture was described by Gilles Deleuze as an example of creative re-interpretation of the classical. When asked why he was compelled to revisit the subject so often, Bacon replied that he had nothing against the Popes, that he merely sought \"an excuse to use these colours, and you can't give ordinary clothes that purple colour without getting into a sort of false fauve manner\".\n\nIBM announces the Model 650 computer\n\nJay Forrester installed magnetic core memory at MIT\n\nDwight D. Eisenhower becomes thirty-fourth president of the United States.\n\nJ. D. Watson and F. H. C. Crick propose a model for DNA comprised of two helically intertwined chains tied together by hydrogen bonds between the purines and pyrimidines.\n\nW. Hayes discovers polarized behavior in bacterial recombinations. He isolates the Hfr H strain of E. coli and shows that certain genes are readily transferred from Hfr to F- bacteria, whereas others are not.\n\nPiltdown Man is determined to be a hoax: the jaw of an ape and a human skull.\n\nFiesel Houtermans and Clair Patterson publish independent estimates inferring the age of the Earth through radiometric dating of meteorites. Both estimates are over 4.5 billion years.\n\nFrom Here to Eternity wins Academy Award for best picture. Daniel Taradash adapted James Jones novel into a great screenplay, augmented by Fred Zinnemanns smart direction. Burt Lancaster topped a strong cast in the tale of military lives in Hawaii just before the bombing of Pearl Harbor.\n\nPainting by Jasper Johns: Flag is an encaustic painting created when Johns was 24 (1954-55), two years after he was discharged from the US Army. This painting was the first of many works that Johns has said were inspired by a dream of the U.S. flag in 1954. It is arguably the painting for which Johns is best known. The US flag was in the news repeatedly in 1954. The McCarthy hearings came to a close on 17 June 1954, only three days after Flag Day. On Flag Day, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed an amendment to the pledge of allegiance to add the words \"under God.\" The New York Times ran article on facts and myths associated with the flag on the day before Flag Day, and then an article on the \"discipline\" of the flag on Flag Day itself, saying, with reference to a national air-raid drill \"we are all soldiers now\". Francis Scott Key, composer of \"The Star Spangled Banner\", was born in 1779, 175 years before 1954. The Iwo Jima Marine Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery, with its large US flag, was dedicated on 11 November 1954. Johns and his father were both named after Sergeant William Jasper, who saved the fallen flag of the Americans at Fort Moultrie in the American Revolutionary War. The work measures 42.2 inches by 60.6 inches. It is made using encaustic, oil paint, and newsprint collage on three separate canvases, mounted on a plywood board. The painting reflects the three colors of the US flag: red, white and blue; the flag is depicted in the form it took between 1912 and 1959, with 48 white stars on a blue canton representing the then-US states (excluding Alaska and Hawaii), and with thirteen red and white stripes. Newsprint is visible under the stripes. Reading the texts, it is clear that the newsprint was not selected at random: Johns steered clear of headlines, or national or political news, and used inconsequential articles or adverts. The painting has a rough-textured surface, and the 48 stars are not identical. It is dated 1954 on its reverse.\n\nOn May 17, the United States Supreme Court, in Brown vs the Board of Education, declares segregation in all public schools in the United States unconstitutional, nullifying the earlier judicial doctrine of \"separate but equal.\"\n\n20th September First FORTRAN Program Runs\n\nIBM Announces Model 705 Computer\n\nJack Tramiel starts Commodore\n\nLeica M Introduced\n\nElso Barghoorn and Stanley Tyler report the discovery of bacterial cells in Canadian rock formations that are nearly 2 billion years old.\n\nPhilip Abelson and his team detect amino acids in fish that are over 300 million years old.\n\nOn the Waterfront wins Academy Award for best picture. Marlon Brando won his first Oscar as Terry Malloy, a New York dock worker. Elia Kazan directed from a script by Budd Schulberg, both of whom were targeted by the Hollywood blacklist; some have seen this film as a metaphor for their experiences and an explanation of their actions.\n\nJuan Ramón Jiménez awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature \"for his lyrical poetry, which in Spanish language constitutes an example of high spirit and artistical purity\".\n\nCollage by Richard Hamilton: Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing? measures 10.25 in (260 mm) × 9.75 in (248 mm). The work is now in the collection of the Kunsthalle Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany. It was the first work of pop art to achieve iconic status. Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing? was created in 1956 for the catalogue of the exhibition This Is Tomorrow in London, England in which it was reproduced in black and white. In addition, the piece was used in posters for the exhibit. Hamilton and his friends John McHale and John Voelcker had collaborated to create the room that became the best-known part of the exhibition.\n\nFirst keyboard used to input data\n\nIBM brings out the Magnetic Disk Memory\n\nIBM introduces the IBM 350\n\nJay Forrester Receives Patent on \"Core\" Memory\n\nPegasus, produced by Ferranti Ltd., went into service in March 1956\n\nWang Sells Core Memory Patent to IBM\n\nF. Jacob and E. L. Wollman are able experimentally to interrupt the mating process in E. coli and show that a piece of DNA is inserted from the donor bacterium into the recipient.\n\nFifteen-year-old English schoolgirl Tina Negus finds a specimen of the fossil species that will later be named Charnia masoni, from the geologic period that will later be named the Ediacaran. Unfortunately, Negus can't convince her geography teacher that the fossil she has found is Precambrian and gives up, leaving the fossil to be extracted by local schoolboy Roger Mason the next year.\n\nKeith Runcorn publishes a paper describing polar wandering based on paleomagnetic studies of Europe and North America. He suggests continental drift, but his paper attracts little attention.\n\nPaleontologist M. W. de Laubenfels publishes a paper suggesting that the dinosaurs were driven to extinction by a meteorite impact. His paper will not be taken seriously, but this hypothesis will be presented again in 1980 with more compelling evidence.\n\nBrian Logan and fellow geologists find living stromatolites in Shark Bay, Australia. The find is somewhat surprising as stromatolites have no defenses against mouth-bearing organisms and have probably been relatively rare since the Cambrian Period.\n\nAround the World in 80 Days wins Academy Award for best picture. Producer Michael Todd coined the term cameo to describe the multiple stars appearing briefly in small roles. This film, adapted from Jules Vernes novel, starred David Niven, Cantinflas and Shirley MacLaine, and featured dozens of stars like Frank Sinatra, Buster Keaton and Marlene Dietrich in brief (and sometimes wordless) appearances.\n\nAlbert Camus awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature \"for his important literary production, which with clear-sighted earnestness illuminates the problems of the human conscience in our times\".\n\nCongress passes the Civil Rights Act of 1957, the first legislation protecting black rights since Reconstruction.\n\nIn September, Pres. Dwight D. Eisenhower sends federal troops to Little Rock, Arkansas, to ensure the enforcement of a federal court order to desegregate Central High School and to protect nine African-American students enrolled as part of the order.\n\nBCS - British Computer Society is Founded\n\nCDC Introduces 1604 Computer\n\nDEC is founded\n\nFerranti Mercury Introduced\n\nFORTRAN-1 is formally published\n\nMay 1957 LEO II Installed\n\nFirst Asahi Pentax SLR introduced.\n\nFirst digital computer acquisition of scanned photographs, by Russell Kirsch et al. at the U.S. National Bureau of Standards (now the NIST).\n\nFrancis Crick proposes the \"central dogma\" of genetic information transfer: DNA specifies RNA and RNA specifies cell proteins.\n\nV. M. Ingram reports that normal and sickle-cell hemoglobin differ by a single amino acid substitution.\n\nThe Soviet Union launches Sputnik.\n\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai wins Academy Award for best picture. The big-scale drama, about the insanity of war, was directed by David Lean. The screenplay was credited to Pierre Boule, who wrote the novel. But in 1984, the Academy updated their records to acknowledge that the script was written by Michael Wilson and Carl Foreman, who had been blacklisted at the time.\n\nBoris Leonidovich Pasternak awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature \"for his important achievement both in contemporary lyrical poetry and in the field of the great Russian epic tradition\".\n\nJack Kilby created the first integrated circuit\n\nFrederick Sanger receives a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on the structure of proteins, especially that of insulin.\n\nGeorge W. Beadle, Edward L. Tatum, and Joshua Lederberg share a Nobel Prize in Medicine for Beadle and Tatum's discovery that genes act by regulating definite chemical events, and for Lederberg's discoveries concerning genetic recombination and the organization of the genetic material of bacteria.\n\nF. H. C. Crick suggests that during protein formation the amino acid is carried to the template by an adaptor molecule containing nucleotides and that the adaptor is the part that actually fits on the RNA template. Crick thus predicts the discovery of transfer RNA.\n\nF. Jacob and E. L. Wollman demonstrate that the single linkage group of E. coli is circular and suggest that the different linkage groups found in different Hfr strains result from the insertion at different points of a factor in the circular linkage group that determines the rupture of the circle.\n\nM. Meselson and F. W. Stahl use the density gradient equilibrium centrifugation technique to demonstrate the semiconservative distribution of density label during DNA replication in E. coli.\n\nGigi wins Academy Award for best picture. Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe, fresh off the success of Broadways My Fair Lady, wrote a score for this musical version of Colettes tale about a young girl being groomed to become a courtesan in Paris. The film made Oscar history by winning every award it was nominated for: nine for nine."
