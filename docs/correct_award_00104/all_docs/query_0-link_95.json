        "text": "2. José Echegaray y Eizaguirre (April 19, 1832 – September 14, 1916) was a Spanish civil engineer , mathematician , statesman , and one of the leading Spanish dramatists of the last quarter of the 19th century. Along with the Provençal poet Frédéric Mistral , he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1904, making him the first Spaniard to win the prize. His most famous play is El gran Galeoto , a drama written in the grand nineteenth century manner of melodrama . It is about the poisonous effect that unfounded gossip has on a middle-aged man's happiness. Echegaray filled it with elaborate stage instructions that illuminate what we would now consider a hammy style of acting popular in the 19th century. Paramount Pictures filmed it as a silent with the title changed to The World and His Wife . His most remarkable plays are Saint or Madman? ( O locura o santidad , 1877); Mariana (1892); El estigma (1895); The Calum ( La duda , 1898); El loco Dios (1900). The Echegaray street named after him in Madrid is famed for its Flamenco taverns.\n\n3. Jacinto Benavente y Martínez (August 12, 1866 – July 14, 1954) was one of the foremost Spanish dramatists of the 20th century. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1922. Born in Madrid , the son of a celebrated pediatrician, he returned drama to reality by way of social criticism: declamatory verse giving way to prose, melodrama to comedy, formula to experience, impulsive action to dialogue and the play of minds. Benavente showed a preoccupation with aesthetics and later with ethics. A liberal monarchist and a critic of Socialism , he was a reluctant supporter of the Franco regime as the only viable alternative to what he considered the disastrous republican experiment of 1931-1936. Benavente died in Aldeaencabo de Escalona ( Toledo ) at the age of 87. He never married. According to many sources, he was homosexual . Jacinto Benavente wrote 172 works. The most important works are: Los intereses creados (1907), comedy involving situations similar to those found in the Commedia dell'arte ; it is Benavente's most famous and often performed work. It has been translated as The Bonds of Interest . Rosas de otoño (1905), sentimental comedy. Señora ama (1908), La malquerida (1913), drama. La ciudad alegre y confiada (1916), continuation from Los intereses creados . Campo de armiño (1916) Lecciones de buen amor (1924) La mariposa que voló sobre el mar (1926) Pepa Doncel (1928) Vidas cruzadas (1929) Aves y pájaros (1940) La honradez de la cerradura (1942) La infanzona (1945) Titania (1946) La infanzona (1947) Abdicación (1948) Ha llegado Don Juan (1952) El alfiler en la boca (1954)\n\n4. Santiago Ramón y Cajal (1 May 1852 – 17 October 1934) Was a Spanish pathologist , histologist , neuroscientist , and Nobel laureate . His pioneering investigations of the microscopic structure of the brain were original: he is considered by many to be the father of modern neuroscience . He was skilled at drawing, and hundreds of his illustrations of brain cells are still used for educational purposes today Ramón y Cajal's early work was accomplished at the Universities of Zaragoza and Valencia , where he focused on the pathology of inflammation , the microbiology of cholera , and the structure of epithelial cells and tissues. It was not until he moved to the University of Barcelona in 1887 that he learned Golgi 's silver nitrate preparation and turned his attention to the central nervous system . During this period he made extensive studies of neural material covering many species and most major regions of the brain. Ramón y Cajal made several major contributions to neuroanatomy. He discovered the axonal growth cone, and provided the definitive evidence for what would later be known as &quot;neuron theory&quot;, experimentally demonstrating that the relationship between nerve cells was not one of continuity, but rather of contiguity. &quot;Neuron theory&quot; stands as the foundation of modern neuroscience.\n\n5. Vicente Pío Marcelino Cirilo Aleixandre y Merlo (April 26, 1898 – December 14, 1984) was a Spanish poet who was born in Seville . [1] Aleixandre was a Nobel Prize laureate for Literature in 1977. He was part of the Generation of '27 . He died in Madrid in 1984. Aleixandre's early poetry, which he wrote mostly in free verse, is highly surrealistic . It also praises the beauty of nature by using symbols that represent the earth and the sea. Many of Aleixandre's early poems are filled with sadness. They reflect his feeling that people have lost the passion and free spirit that he saw in nature. His works His early collections of poetry include Passion of the Earth (1935) and Destruction or Love (1933). In 1944, he wrote Shadow of Paradise , the poetry where he first began to concentrate on themes such as fellowship, friendliness, and spiritual unity. His later books of poetry include History of the Heart (1954) and In a Vast Dominion (1962). Aleixandre studied law at the University of Madrid . Selections of his work were translated into English in Twenty Poems of Vicente Aleixandre (1977) and A Longing for the Light: Selected Poems of Vincent Aleixandre (1979; Copper Canyon Press , 2007) (translated by Lewis Hyde ).\n\n6. Juan Ramón Jiménez Mantecón (23 December 1881 – 29 May 1958) was a Spanish poet , a prolific writer who received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1956. One of Jiménez's most important contributions to modern poetry was his advocacy of the French concept of &quot;pure poetry.&quot; Although he was primarily a poet, Jiménez' prose work Platero y yo (1917; &quot;Platero and I&quot;) sold well in Latin America, and in translation won him popularity in the USA. He also collaborated with his wife in the translation of the Irish playwright John Millington Synge 's Riders to the Sea (1920). His poetic output during his life was immense. Among his better known works are Sonetos espirituales 1914–1916 (1916; “Spiritual Sonnets, 1914–15”), Piedra y cielo (1919; “Stones and Sky”), Poesía, en verso , 1917–1923 (1923), Poesía en prosa y verso (1932; “Poetry in Prose and Verse”), Voces de mi copla (1945; “Voices of My Song”), and Animal de fondo (1947; “Animal at Bottom”). A collection of 300 poems (1903–53) in English translation by Eloise Roach was published in 1962. His literary influence on Puerto Rican writers strongly marks the works of Giannina Braschi , René Marqués , and Manuel Ramos Otero . The library at the main campus of the University of Puerto Rico in Río Piedras features the &quot;Sala Juan Ramón y Zenobia&quot;, a collection of many of Jiménez's personal belongings and personal library, as well as his wife's. A quotation from Jiménez, &quot;If they give you ruled paper, write the other way&quot;, is the epigraph to Ray Bradbury 's novel Fahrenheit 451 . The name of Juan Ramón Jiménez is familiar to students at the University of Maryland , the language building of which is named for the poet.\n\n7. Severo Ochoa de Albornoz (September 24, 1905 – November 1, 1993) was a Spanish - American doctor and biochemist , and joint winner of the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Arthur Kornberg . He then went to America, where he again held many positions at several universities.

In 1956, he became an American citizen. In 1959, Ochoa was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for his work on the synthesis of RNA . Ochoa continued research on protein synthesis and replication of RNA viruses until 1985, when he returned to Spain and gave advice to Spanish science policy authorities and scientists. Ochoa was also a recipient of U.S. National Medal of Science in 1979. A new research center that was planned in the 1970s, was finally built and named after Ochoa .
