        "text": "¡Viva La Vida Literaria!\n\nBy C.M. Mayo\n\nResources in the Washington DC Areafor Spanish Language Writers & Translators\n\nAn abbreviated version of this article was published in The Writers' Center Writers' Carousel, Nov-Dec 2004 as \"Found in Translation\"\n\nWashington is rich indeed. On a single day this past September, I had a choice of three outstanding Spanish language literary events: Ilán Stavans presenting his book on \"Spanglish\" at the Library of Congress Hispanic Division; a centennial celebration of the poetry of Pablo Neruda at American University; and a reading of a new Spanish language novel at the Instituto de México. Washington's Spanish literary scene is, as McLean, Virginia-based poet Luis Alberto Ambroggio says, \"vibrant, and it's growing.\" Many of the premier Spanish language literary venues are in embassies and universities. The Library of Congress's Hispanic Division, and university and public libraries have long been sources of books and magazines in Spanish, and many offer book presentations, lectures, and readings. But in just the last few years, there has been an explosion of independent readings series, institutions, groups, and even bookstores specializing in Spanish and literary translation from Spanish. Here is a sampling of some of the best and most active in the area.\n\nBOOKS, READINGS, AND LECTURES\n\nJiménez-Porter Writers' House\n\nNamed in honor of novelist and short story writer Katherine Anne Porter and Nobel Prize-winning Spanish poet Juan Ramón Jiménez, the Jiménez-Porter House is the University of Maryland's center for the study of creative writing across cultures and languages. Its reading series has included Forrest Gander, a poet and translator of Mexican poetry, and Mónica de la Torre, a Mexican poet and co-editor of the anthology Reversible Monuments: Contemporary Poetry. This November 11 at 7 p.m. Lee Gutkind and C.M. Mayo will present the \"Mexican Voices\" special issue of Creative Nonfiction. All events are free and open to the public. 0111 Dorchester Hall, Building 064, University of Maryland, College Park, MD. For more information call (301) 405-0675 or visit http://www.writershouse.umd.edu\n\nIberoamerican Cultural Foundation\n\nFounded by Alexandria, Virginia-based Argentinian poet and Spanish professor Gladys Ilauregui, the Iberoamerican Cultural Foundation plans to offer a fall calendar of tertulias, which she describes as \"a forum for Spanish writers in the area to present their work and get in touch with the public.\" Recent events have included a talk by Spanish language poet Nela Rio about the 15th century poet Leonor de Ovando, and a conference on literary translation with Margaret Sayers Peden, Jen Hofer, and Michael Miller, among others. For more information, contact Gladys Ilarregui at gladys@udel.edu\n\nInstituto de México (Mexican Cultural Institute)\n\nHoused in a historic mansion featuring stunning murals, this cultural arm of the Mexican Embassy offers both Spanish and English-language book presentations, readings, panel discussions, movies, concerts, painting exhibits and more, all focusing on Mexico and/or Mexican artists and writers. Recent events have included the bilingual presentation and reading of Tameme, the bilingual journal; a bilingual poetry reading with Mexican poets José Emilio Pacheco, Pura López Colomé, and Tedi López Mills. Fall events will include the presentation of Creative Nonfiction's special issue, \"Mexican Voices.\" Events are free and open to the public.

It was painted when his father was ambassador to the U.S. Look for it as you come up the grand staircase.\n\nInter-American Development Bank Cultural Center\n\nIn the past the IDB Cultural Center has presented Carlos Fuentes, Mario Vargas Llosa, José Saramago, and Ariel Dorfman, among many other outstanding writers from the Americas.

Giron, Publisher, Gival Press, and editor of Poetic Voices Without Borders, an anthology of poems in English, French, and Spanish, forthcoming Spring 2005.\n\nC. M. Mayo: What have you published in Spanish translation?\n\nRobert Giron: We have published Dreams and Other Ailments / Suenos y otros achaques by Teresa Bevin (short stories about the Hispanic experience in the USA) which won the Bronze 2001 ForeWord Magazine's Book of the Year Award for Translation and was a finalist in the 2002 Independent Publisher Book Award for Multicultural Fiction. We have also published Canciones para una sola cuerda / Songs for a Single String by the late Jesus Gardea with my translations, which was a finalist in the 2003 Violet Crown Book Award sponsored by Barnes and Noble and the Texas Writers' League. And also Dead Time / Tiempo muerto by Carlos Rubio, a novel, which won the Silver 2003 ForeWord Magazine's Book of the Year Award for Translation and was a finalist in the 2004 Independent Publisher Book Award for Multicultural Fiction.\n\nC.M.. Why are you interested in publishing Spanish language work?\n\nR.G.: Aside from being American, ethnically I have more Spanish ancestry than any other, though I'm quite a cultural mix. Having Mexican roots, of course, grounded me in the Spanish language as I heard it spoken and being fluent in Spanish also facilitates my interest. As the saying goes, the Spanish fire runs through my veins and trying to maintain the languageis enhanced through the publications since as an English professor, I confess, that I don't get many opportunities to practice my Spanish; but that can also be said about my French interests. So in short, one of the goals of Gival Press is to encourage the use of Spanish."
