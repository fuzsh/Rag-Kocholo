Singer, parents of the late Katherine Singer Kovacs. The prize will be presented on 8th January 2022, during the association’s annual convention, to be held in Washington, DC.\n\nThe judges’ citation for Kendrick’s book reads: “Anna Kathryn Kendrick’s study engages broadly and deeply with important developments in the field of education and developmental psychology and examines them in the context of a wide array of Spanish Silver Age sources. Meticulously assembled and written, Humanizing Childhood in Twentieth-Century Spain adds new dimensions to canonical texts (by José Ortega y Gasset, Jorge Guillén, Federico García\n\nLorca, Juan Ramón Jiménez, and others) while also introducing new texts into the discussion.”\n\nThe Modern Language Association of America and its over 23,000 members in 100 countries work to strengthen the study and teaching of languages and literature. The prize is presented under the auspices of the MLA’s Committee on Honors and Awards.\n\n*The picture above is taken from the book’s cover."
