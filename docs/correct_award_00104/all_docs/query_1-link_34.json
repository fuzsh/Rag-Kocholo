As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story. jAvoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.\n\nEnjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism.\n\nTake kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.\n\nYou are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.\n\nTherefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be careful. Strive to be happy.\n\nBy: Max Ehrmann\n\nEmbracing Formal Practice: Tasting Mindfulness by Jon Kabat-Zinn\n\nEmbracing Formal Practice: Tasting Mindfulness\n\nHave you ever had the experience of stopping so completely?\n\nof being in your body so completely,\n\nof being in your life so completely\n\nthat you knew and what you didn’t know\n\nthat what had been and what was yet to come,\n\nand the way things are right now\n\nno longer held even the slightest hint of anxiety or discord?\n\nIt would be a moment of complete presence, beyond striving,\n\nbeyond mere acceptance,\n\nbeyond the desire to escape or fix anything or plunge ahead,\n\na moment of pure seeing, pure feeling,\n\na moment in which life simply is,\n\nand that “isness” grabs you by all your senses,\n\nall your memories, by all your very genes,\n\nby your loves, and\n\nwelcomes you home\n\nBy: Jon Kabat-Zinn\n\nEnough by David Whyte\n\nEnough\n\nEnough.

Murray\n\nOn Commitment\n\nUntil one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back, always ineffectiveness. Concerning all acts of initiative (and creation), there is one elementary truth, the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans: that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then Providence moves too. All sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred. A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in one's favour all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance, which no man could have dreamt would have come his way. I have learned a deep respect for one of Goethe's couplets:\n\nWhatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it.\n\nBoldness has genius, power, and magic in it!\n\nBy William H.

Typically identified as an “If only . . .” seductive mentality. “When a pickpocket meets a saint, the pickpocket sees only the saint’s pockets.” Aversion, hatred, anger and ill will. Has a burning, tight quality to it that we can’t escape. Fear, judgment and boredom can all be forms of aversion, because they are based upon our dislike of some aspect of experience.\n\nFrom: Seeking the Heart of Wisdom, The Path of Insight Meditation\n\nBy Joseph Goldstein and Jack Kornfield, Shambhala Publications, 1987\n\nSloth and torpor. Includes laziness, dullness, lack of vitality, fogginess and sleepiness.\n\nRestlessness can be the opposite of sloth and torpor. Agitation, nervousness, anxiety and worry. The mind spins in circles or flops around like a fish out of water.\n\nDoubt. Can be the most difficult because when we believe it and get caught by it, our practice stops cold and we become paralyzed. Could be doubts about ourselves, our capacities, doubt about our teachers, doubts about the practice (“Does this really work?”)\n\nThe Five Remembrances\n\nThe Five Remembrances\n\nI am of the nature to grow old. I cannot escape growing old.\n\nI am of the nature to have ill health. I cannot escape having ill health.\n\nI am of the nature to die. I cannot escape death.\n\nAll that is dear to me and everyone I love are of the nature of change. I cannot escape being separated from them.\n\nMy deeds are my closest companions. I am the beneficiary of my deeds. My deeds are the ground on which I stand.\n\nThe God who only knows Four Words by Hafiz\n\nThe God who only knows Four Words\n\nEvery Child\n\nHas known God,\n\nNot the God of names,\n\nNot the God of Don'ts\n\nNot the God who ever does anything weird\n\nBut the God who only knows four words\n\nAnd keeps repeating them, saying:\n\n\"Come dance with Me\"\n\nCome Dance\n\nBy: Hafiz\n\nThe Guest House by Rumi (translation by Coleman Barks)\n\nThe Guest House\n\nThis being human is a guest house.\n\nEvery morning a new arrival.\n\nA joy, a depression, a meanness,\n\nsome momentary awareness comes\n\nas an unexpected visitor.\n\nWelcome and entertain them all!\n\nEven if they're a crowd of sorrows,\n\nwho violently sweep your house\n\nempty of its furniture,\n\nstill, treat each guest honorably.\n\nHe may be clearing you out\n\nfor some new delight.\n\nThe dark thought, the shame, the malice,\n\nmeet them at the door laughing,\n\nand invite them in.\n\nBe grateful for whoever comes,\n\nbecause each has been sent\n\nas a guide from beyond.\n\nBy Rumi, Translation by Coleman Barks\n\nThe Hippo by Steven Hickman\n\nThe Hippo\n\nThe hippo floats in swamp serene,\n\nsome emerged, but most unseen.\n\nSeeing all and only blinking,\n\nWho knows what this beast is thinking.\n\nGliding, and of judgment clear,\n\nLetting go and being here.\n\nSeeing all, both guilt and glory,\n\nOnly noting.

A hundred thousand new houses can be built from the transparent yellow carnelian.\n\nburied beneath it, and the only way to get to that is to do the work of demolishing and then\n\ndigging under the foundations. With that value in hand all the new construction will be done\n\nwithout effort. And anyway, sooner or later this house will fall on its own. The jewel treasure will be\n\nuncovered, but it won't be yours then. The buried wealth is your pay for doing the demolition,\n\nthe pick and shovel work. If you wait and just let it happen, you'd bite your hand and say,\n\n\"I didn't do as I knew I should have.\" This is a rented house. You don't own the deed.\n\nYou have a lease, and you've set up a little shop, where you barely make a living sewing patches\n\non torn clothing. Yet only a few feet underneath are two veins, pure red and bright gold carnelian.\n\nQuick! Take the pickaxe and pry the foundation. You've got to quit this seamstress work.\n\nWhat does the patch-sewing mean, you ask. Eating and drinking. The heavy cloak of the body\n\nis always getting torn. You patch it with food, and other restless ego-satisfactions. Rip up\n\none board from the shop floor and look into the basement.

The dog may obey when we say \"Stay!\" \"Come!\" \"Roll over!\" and \"Sit up!\" but he will also be neurotic and confused.\n\nBy contrast, training with kindness results in someone who is flexible and confident, who doesn't become upset when situations are unpredictable and insecure.\n\nSo whenever we wander off, we gently encourage ourselves to \"stay\" and settle down.\n\nAre we experiencing restlessness? Stay!\n\nDiscursive mind? Stay!\n\nAre fear and loathing out of control? Stay!\n\nAching knees and throbbing back? Stay!\n\nWhat's for lunch? Stay!\n\nWhat am I doing here?

When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real.”\n\n“Does it hurt?” asked the Rabbit.\n\n“Sometimes,” said the Skin Horse, for he was always truthful. “When you are Real you don’t mind being hurt.”\n\n“Does it happen all at once, like being wound up,” he asked, “or bit by bit?”\n\n“It doesn’t happen all at once,” said the Skin Horse. “You become. It takes a long time. That’s why it doesn’t happen often to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept.\n\n“Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby.

Then one day their horse comes running back over the hill with 6 other horses. The son exclaimed, \"What great luck, now we have all the horses we'll ever need!\"\n\nTo which the farmer replied; \"Good luck, bad luck, too soon to tell.\"\n\nThe next day as the farmer and son were working with the horses, one particularly difficult horse threw the son off his back and broke his leg. The son cried: \"Oh father, I am so sorry, now you have to work the farm all by yourself. What bad luck!\"\n\nOnce again the father replied: \"Good luck, bad luck, too soon to tell.\"\n\nSeveral days later the Civil War broke out and all the able bodied young men were sent off to war. The farmer's son, having a broken leg, was forced to stay at home.\n\nAfter the leg had healed, the father had the only farm around with a son to help and seven horses to boot.

Ardell\n\nUpstream Downstream a Contemporary Fable\n\nIt was many years ago that the villagers of Downstream recall spotting the first body in the river. Some old timers remember how spartan were the facilities and procedures for managing that sort of thing. Sometimes they say, it took hours to pull 10 people from the river, and even then only a few would survive.\n\nThough the number of victims in the river has increased greatly in recent years, the good folk of Downstream have responded admirably to the challenge. Their rescue system is clearly second to none: most people discovered in the swirling waters are reached within 20 minutes-many less than 10. Only a small number drown each day before help arrives - a big improvement from the way it use to be.\n\nTalk to the people of Downstream and they'll speak with pride about the new hospital by the edge of the waters, the flotilla of rescue boats ready for service at a moment's notice, the comprehensive plans for coordinating all the manpower involved, and the large numbers of highly trained and dedicated swimmers always ready to risk their lives to save victims from the raging currents. So it cost a lot, say to the Downstreamers, but what else can descent people do except to provide whatever is necessary when human lives are at stake.\n\nOh, a few people in Downstream have raised the question now and again, but most folks show little interest in what's happening Upstream. it seems there's so much to do to help those in the river that nobody's got time to check how all those bodies are getting in the river in the first place. That's the way things are sometimes.\n\nBy: Donald B.

But for practitioners or spiritual warriors, people who have a certain hunger to know what is true, feelings like disappointment, embarrassment, irritation, resentment, anger, jealousy, and fear, instead of being bad news, are actually very clear moments that teach us where it is that we are holding back.\n\nThey teach us to perk up and lean in when we feel we'd rather collapse and back away. They're like messengers that show us, with terrifying clarity, exactly where we're stuck. This very moment s the perfect teacher, and lucky for us, it's with us wherever we are.\n\nMost of us do not take these situations as teachings. We automatically hate them. We run like crazy.\n\nWe are use to all kinds of escaping - all addictions stem from this moment when we meet our edge and we just can't stand it.\n\nThere are so many ways that have been dreamed up to entertain us away from the moment.\n\nBy: Pema Chodron\n\nWhen You See Water by Alice Walker\n\nWhen You See Water\n\nWhen you see water in a stream you say: oh, this is stream water; When you see water in the river you say: oh, this is water of the river; When you see ocean water you say: This is the ocean’s water! But actually water is always only itself and does not belong to any of these containers though it creates them. And so it is with you.\n\nBy: Alice Walker\n\nWho Turns by Karen Maesen Miller\n\nWho Turns\n\nWho turns this into that? Sound into noise?\n\nAroma into odor?
