        "text": "2.1 Origen / Origin\n\nFecha de Constitución / Foundation Date: 12/11/1920\n\nEntidades Fundadoras / Founder Entities: King Alfonso XIII / President of Government Francisco Silvela\n\nPrimer Director/a / First Director: SANTIAGO RAMÓN y CAJAL\n\n2.2 Objeto con el que fue creado / Founding aim\n\nMission: Research at the Cajal Institute aims to provide basic knowledge about brain structure and function during development and in the adult. Providing a better understanding of the physiopathology of brain diseases of great social impact, and development of neurorehabilitation methods to improve the functional or health outcomes of people with physical disabilities is one of our major goals. Comprehension of basic mechanisms of nerve function will certainty provide cutting-edge opportunities to transfer leading-edge knowledge and technologies to society and industry. Following multidisciplinary approaches, the center is committed to promotion, coordination, development, dissemination, advice, personnel training and talent attraction, as well as reinforcement of social awareness about neurological diseases. Disseminating to society the importance of brain research through active collaboration with scientific societies and local associations of patients with neurological conditions is also actively pursued.\n\nBeing aware on the social role that any public research center must have, which implies a clear and visible return to society, in addition to fundamental and applied research, the IC considers the following aspects as part of its mission:\n\n1. TRANSFER: Transfer of research results to the clinic and industry, for example, through the creation of spin – off companies to exploit the results or promote trials is one of our priorities. The institute must become a scientific-technological tractor, collaborating with companies (pharmaceutical companies, scientific-medical- clinical equipment, neurorehabilitation technologies) and patient associations. The spaces that the new center has on the University Campus should be complemented by the location, in the facilities provided by the UAH and destined for innovation, of spin-offs and groups with a clear translational orientation, including spaces for the provision of services. In this sense, we understand that a business model can be developed based on the provision of services to third parties in which most of the services listed in the following section could be integrated.\n\n2. TRAINING: Neuroscience training at both undergraduate and postgraduate level is essential for a modern institution to thrive, both in its aspect of offering the knowledge acquired in the formats that society requires for students in training, as well as to connect with the university environment to recruit the best students to be trained in the IC laboratories. Regarding student formation, the Institute has strong links with neighboring universities in the Madrid region and aims to keep the same fruitful level of collaboration with all of them. Most research group leaders (PIs) in the Institute are already involved in different master courses and regularly receive students from national and international institutions. Establishment of new links with academical institutions is being actively pursued as well as keeping the current links. Also, Institute members regularly participate in different types of public events to disseminate our research activities. These include a variety of public activities (science fairs, public lectures, open-door sessions, media interviews etc.). Currently, the IC cooperates in teaching programs of university master’s degree in neuroscience. Also, it welcomes students from foreign institutions (undergraduate internships, final degree projects, end of master, doctorate, Erasmus + program, Fulbright … etc). Of particular interest is our post-graduate research program offering multidisciplinary teaching adapted to the new models of the Europe of knowledge. Also, specialization training for technicians is provided. In accordance with all this, the new IC at the UAH campus plans to lead a new International Master and PhD Program in Neurosciences in collaboration with the International University “Menendez Pelayo”, using when necessary the teaching collaboration of scientists from around the world. We seek to generate new professional opportunities inside and outside the academy, influencing the training not only of tomorrow’s scientists, but also future high-school teachers, journalists, philosophers, historians, etc. These training programs will be open to students from all countries of the world according to a strict selection\n\nIC – 2criterion. We aspire through this program to be recognized by the NENS Committee of the Federation of European Neuroscience Societies-FENS and to achieve collaboration systems that guarantee an associated scholarship program.\n\n3. HISTORY: The IC became heir to the work of Cajal and his Spanish Neurohistological School, receiving in inheritance his Legacy. Thus, the IC is and should be a flagship in neuroscience within our institution. Given the validity and timeliness of the” Cajal Legacy”, both in terms of the history of science and for current research, it is essential to have a “Cajal Museum”. In this regard, it should be pointed out that the “Archives of Santiago Ramón y Cajal and the Spanish Neurohistological School”, are included in the Memory of the World Register in 2017.\n\n4. DISSEMINATION: Quality scientific dissemination must be one of the essential elements of current and future scientific activity. The IC has a section of Scientific Culture as such, and we consider that its support is fundamental. This, without detriment to the already traditional participation of the IC´s personal scientist in outreach activities that seek to reach Spanish society and in particular patient associations related to the world of Neurology and Psychiatry\n\nVision: To be a reference international center in research, development and innovation in the field of Neurosciences, capable of attracting the best researchers, as a key to the development of its activity and sustainability.\n\n2.3 Reseña histórica extendida / Extended historical outline\n\n2.3.1. Sus primeras sedes / First headquarters\n\nThe IC is currently a center of reference in neuroscience, not only in Spain, but also internationally, protected by identity provided by the memory and legacy of Ramón y Cajal (1852-1934). His founder was Santiago Ramón y Cajal, the recognized pioneer of modern Neuroscience. The IC has a history that dates back to the end of the 19th century, when Cajal was recognized abroad, not only for his work on the fine structure of the nervous centers, but also for having received several scientific distinctions and for the accolade obtained after its intervention in the Congress of Anatomy, Berlin in 1889. The IC formally originates from the “Laboratorio de Investigaciones Biológicas” (1901, Laboratory for Biological Investigations, LIB), created to offer Santiago Ramón y Cajal the means with which he could work in Spain in the context of the renewal of scientific-educational policy, by the initiative of the President of the Government, Mr. Francisco Silvela, on the occasion of the Moscow Prize awarded to Santiago Ramón y Cajal, 1897. The LIB was settled in “Ventura de la Vega” street, then moved to the Velasco´s Museum, origin of the Anthropological Museum in Atocha neighborhood. In 1910, the LIB joined the so called “Junta para Ampliación de Estudios e Investigaciones Científicas” (JAE), an institution dependent of the Ministry of Public Education. Following the award of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (1906), and the creation of the JAE (1907), Cajal was appointed as President of JAE. The IC officially began its journey at the beginning of 1920. A royal decree by H.M. King Alfonso XIII promoted the construction of a new building dedicated to Biological Research and the appointment of Cajal as the first director, an Institute that would be called Cajal Institute. Works for construction began in 1922 on the hill of “San Blas”, next to the Astronomical Observatory and the previous one “Velasco Museum”, next to the “Retiro” Park, in Madrid. The IC incorporated various laboratories of other fields outside neurobiology, and it remained there until 1953. The old LIB, where Cajal had worked for almost thirty years, would move there. Cajal only entered his Institute on the day of its inauguration and little else, due to his precarious state of health. Cajal died in October 1934, a year after finishing the works of the new Institute. The building, of truly spectacular dimensions for the time and due to certain financing problems, was not inaugurated until 1933, more than ten years later, just when Cajal had appointed Jorge Francisco Tello director of the Institute. Following the steps of its founder, research in the IC initially focused in neurohistology and histopathology. On the first floor was the Neurohistology Laboratory directed by Prof. Fernando de Castro. During the Spanish Civil War (1936-39), the IC was badly damaged, even occupied by battle contenders and had to be rebuilt in part. In 1939, following the creation of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), the IC was incorporated to this national organization originated from the extinct JAE. José Ibáñez Martín, Minister of National Education and the first president of the CSIC, and José María Albareda Herrera, appointed secretary general of the CSIC, participated actively in his organization. Two years later, the IC was incorporated to CSIC. The Spanish Civil War interrupted the consolidation of a science that had been born under the cultural designs of the JAE . At the end of the War, Jorge Francisco Tello was ceased as director of the institute and from the Royal Spanish Academy of Medicine as well, being replaced by José María del Corral García in the chair of the Institute (1939). Later, Enrique Suñer Ordoñez was appointed director of the IC, holding the position until 1941 when he was replaced by Juan Marcilla Arrazola, professor of Microbiology and Enology at the Madrid School of Agronomists. After the disasters that occurred during the Civil War in Spain, the institutional scrapping of the Cajal School was completed, which practically buried the Institute in oblivion. Many members of the Cajal School went into exile, ie. Lorente de Nó had already went to the United States of America, Nicolás Achúcarro died very young, in 1918, at the only 37 years of age, José María Villaverde was assassinated at the beginning of the war, Gonzalo Rodríguez Lafora and Isaac Costero left for Mexico, Pio del Río Hortega went to Argentina, Ramón Rodríguez Pérez and Juan Miguel Herrera joined the Republican army, and so on. Francisco Tello and Fernando de Castro remained in Spain in the care of the IC and in 1947 Julian Sanz Ibañez was entrusted with the reorganization of the Cajal Institute of Madrid. In 1957, the IC was installed in a new building called “Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas” (Center for Biological Research, CIB), situated in Velázquez 144 street, inaugurated by F. Franco on February 8, 1958. In the CIB, the IC shared space with other newly created research institutes dependent of the CSIC, mostly devoted to Biology. In the brand new CIB building, the IC laboratories and supporting research services were located in the ground floor and portions of the second and third floors facing Velázquez street, and a part of the central tower where the “Animal Facility” (to call it somehow) was located together with the operating room. An electron microscope Zeiss© and old Reichert OMU© ultramicrotomes were located in the same floor of the tower. The Institute also had a space in the ground floor that housed the Cajal Museum. In 1960 the Cajal Institute did not meet the expectations (period 1977-89, H index=22). Professor Sanz Ibáñez died unexpectedly in 1963 and was succeed by Professor Alfredo Carrato, elected between known neuroscientists candidates, Fernández de Molina and Jabonero. Following Prof. Carrato´s retirement in 1981, there was a complete staff´s agreement on the need to appoint an “International Advisory Board” (SAB) to carry out the necessary administrative and scientific restructuration for upgrading of the Institute’s activity.\n\n2.3.2. Actualmente\n\nIn the late 1969 and early 1970s the traditional fields of Anatomy, Physiology and Psychiatry, among other disciplines related to the study of the brain and its diseases, experienced unprecedented growth that led to the emergence of a new science that became known as Neurosciences, a discipline that was consolidated mainly due to advances in molecular biology, electrophysiology, pharmacology and pathology, among others. At the beginning of 1980, with a practically new democracy, there was an atmosphere of renewal and change in Spain that, although for different reasons, was reminiscent of the regenerationism movement that occurred in Spain at the end of the 19th century and early 20th century. This renewal movement also meant a substantial change for the CSIC in the organization. At the CIB, CNB, and CBM there were a significant number of researchers who had completed their training abroad, evolving scientifically and incorporating new technologies and cutting-edge lines of research. However, the CI had not incorporated at that time the methods and techniques of state-of-the-art research, having remained anchored in the methodologies of the time of its foundation, so it was considered by the CSIC a renewal of the IC as a priority based on renovation experiences that were giving such good results in other research centers. The CSIC, chaired by Alejandro Nieto (1980-1983) as president, and Emilio Muñoz as vice president, considered that the renewal of the Institute could be a milestone well deserved. As a first step, a commission made up of several IC researchers was appointed, composed by José Gómez-Acebo, Ricardo Martínez (father) and Facundo Valverde. They were commissioned to carry out a detailed study of the situation of the Institute with an evaluation of the possibilities for the future according to the modern scientific trajectories that other research centers had carried out. Among several possible evaluators, they decided to invite W. Maxwell Cowan from the Salk Institute of San Diego, California (USA), and Hendrik van der Loos, professor at the University of Lausanne (Switzerland). They were committed to report proposals to promote the IC activity as a center of excellence. To be fair, it must be said that both reports were devastating for the Institute. However, several recommendations were drawn. Particularly noteworthy was the lack of scientific leadership detected, the isolation of some members of the Institute and the type of obsolete research, working on problems that would have been of interest 30 or 40 years ago, and frozen in procedures and techniques of past times (in words of Facundo Valverde). Both evaluators pointed considerable emphasis on the poor equipment and organization of many laboratories, the lack of space and the lamentable state of the animal facility. In 1985, the Institute was re-organized with the recruitment of scientists from other fields of neuroscience evolving scientifically and incorporating new technologies and cutting-edge lines of research in electrophysiology, cell and molecular biology, genetics, neural development, neuropharmacology and behavior. A complete agreement between staff scientists of the IC was the need to appoint a permanent SAB composed of half a dozen scientists of renowned prestige and knowledge of modern Neurobiology, who would provide assistance and advice in the administrative and scientific restructuring of the Institute and to monitor, through periodic evaluations, the Institute’s activity. In the process of renovating the IC and following the recommendations of the former evaluators, in 1985 an external evaluation committee was appointed composed by E. Costa, from the National Institute of Mental Health. (USA), C. Cuello from Oxford University (UK), H M Gerschenfeld from the École Normale Superieure de Paris (France), F. Reinoso-Suárez from the Faculty of Medicine of the Autonomous University of Madrid (UAM) and H. van der Loos from the Institut of Anatomy of the Faculty of Medicine of Lausanne (Switzerland). Following referee’s suggestions to promote the IC activity as a center of excellence, a new building on Avenida del Dr. Arce, 37 (third headquarters), in the heart of the Chamartín district was built with CSIC´s own funds. The new center was inaugurated in 1989, in Madrid in a building of 4,500 square meters, which is now quite tight owing to the increase of its staff during these last years. In 2020 the IC housed 28 research teams and around 41 researchers (staff, senior and postdoc researchers), with operating costs of 3,062 M€ in 2020. However, weakness of the IC at the present location is that it remains small and geographically and scientifically isolated, especially since the CIB moved to the UCM in 2004. The new IC in the Campus of the Alcala University (UAH) (fourth headquarters) is intended to be the house of a modern center with all the necessary equipment for the development of cutting-edge research in neurobiology. In 2020, the transfer of the IC to the campus of the UAH was announced. A research center called “Centro Internacional de Neurociencias Cajal” (Cajal Neuroscience International Center, CINC) will share space and technical facilities (CI2A) with the IC. IC and CINC will become world reference centers equipped with the most cutting-edge technology to collect the baton of more than a century of scientific efforts in the field of neurosciences. The new building, already finished in 2011, is expected to be occupied on 2022 by both Cajal´s centers.\n\n2.3.3. Among the most relevant scientific-technical milestones in its history, it is worth mentioning:\n\n-1902-41, Domingo Sánchez is one of the main specialists worldwide on the CNS of insects and other invertebrates. He performed prominent studies on the visual system (with Cajal, 1915) and motor system, as well as metamorphosis.\n\n– 1919-20, Pío del Río Hortega identifies the composition of the “third element of the nervous system¨ constituted by microglia and oligodendroglia. Therefore, he discovers two out of the four main cell types of the CNS. Nominated to Nobel Prize for this finding in 1929 and 1937. In the period 1920-28, Pio del Rio Hortega describes the function of oligodendrocytes, homologating them to the Schwann cells at the peripheral nervous system. His disciple Wilder Penfield, an American neurosurgeon who founded the Montreal Neurological Institute and worked at the IC in 1924, contributed to this finding. In addition, Pío del Río Hortega publishes five innovative scientific studies on the pineal gland. Pío del Río Hortega performs the first histogenetic classification of tumors of the nervous system (gliomas), which places him at the forefront of neuropathology. This classification remained in use until the latest biomarkers generation.\n\n-1920-30, Gonzalo Rodríguez Lafora and José María Villaverde published many works in the fields of neuropathology and psychiatry, and toxicology and neuropsychiatry, with great international impact.\n\n– Fernando de Castro devoted himself to the study the structure and organization of sympathetic, parasympathetic, and sensorial ganglia. His work is included in the Treatise on Neurology of Penfield, thus becoming acknowledged as world leader in the field of neuroscience. Described the innervation of the “glomus caroticum”. Although his studies, published between 1926 and 1928, should have led him to obtain the Nobel Prize, it was the Belgian C. Heymans, based on the chemoreceptor function first described by Fernando de Castro, who continued a series of works by which he obtained the Nobel Prize in 1938. It was always considered that Fernando de Castro should have shared this award with C. Heymans himself. He was an honorary member of the Faculty of Medicine of several national and foreign universities, awarded by the Royal National Academy of Medicine and, among other merits and distinctions, in 1966 he received the Grand Cross of the Civil Order of “Alfonso X el Sabio”.\n\n-Pioneering study of Rafael Lorente de Nó on the murine cerebral cortex in 1923, described the cortical columns, fundamental to Hubbel & Wiesel’s Nobel Prize in 1981. Lorente was Nobel nominee four times between 1949-53. Rafael Lorente de Nó publishes three fundamental works on the structure and connections of the labyrinth and audit ory nuclei, and explains ocular movements and labyrinth reflection. The IC enters, with these studies, into physiology.\n\n-1925-31, Francisco Tello stood out for his works on early neurogenesis, the degeneration and regeneration of the nervous system and on the hibernation processes of mammals.\n\n-1933, A year before he died, Cajal published Neuronism or reticularism? (1933), an exhaustive proof in favor of cellular theory in the central nervous system. The reticularists did not recognize their defeat until the 1950s, with the arrival of the electron microscopy.\n\n-1967, Facundo Valverde demonstrated for the first time that sensory deprivation produces morphological variations in dendritic spines (specifically, apical dendritic spines of the visual cortex and light deprivation in the mouse), suggesting their involvement in memory and learning processes: Exp. Brain Res. 3, 337-52, 1967 (up to 500 cites). In 1992, Facundo Valverde got the King Jaume I Award for his relevant studies in the anatomical organization of the cerebral cortex, with special attention to the visual areas.\n\n-1973, Ricardo Martínez Rodriguez, received the “Santiago Ramón y Cajal” award from the CSIC, in recognition of his studies on “Histochemistry of Neurotransmitter Metabolism”.\n\n-1994, Angela Nieto, described that the Snail superfamily of zinc-finger transcription factors is involved in processes that imply pronounced cell movements, both during embryonic development and neural differentiation. Also, in cell survival and in the acquisition of invasive and migratory properties during tumor progression. Science 264, pp.835-839, 1994; Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol, 3, 155-56, 2002; Oncogene, 21, 3241-3246, 2002; Science, 342, 708, 2013; Nat. Cell Biol., 2, 78-63, 2000. Papers with a number of references altogether of up to 4,500 citations.\n\n-1999, José Ramón Naranjo described for the first time that DREAM represents the first known Ca2+-binding protein to function as a DNA-binding transcriptional regulator. Nature, 398, 80-4. Paper with a number of references of up to 500.\n\n-2009, Alfonso Araque provided data supporting that brain function actually arises from the coordinated activity of a network comprising both neurons and glia: the “tripartite synapses”. Trends Neurosci. 32, 421-31. Paper with a number of references up to 1000.\n\n2.3.4.

The number of publications (total, first quartile and first decile) and the number of citations in the timeframe from publication are shown. Only publications by IC researchers are taken into account. H index=28\n\n5.1 Objetivos Generales / General Objectives\n\nSince its creation in 1920, the IC has developed cutting-edge scientific research producing a beneficial impact for the society, while maintaining strong links with academic institutions around the world. The leadership of the IC reached its climax in the 1990s, boosted by the move to its current headquarters in Avenída Doctor Arce 37, Madrid, and by the incorporation of numerous young groups that promoted the study of the brain towards the most modern standards of the time. This golden age of the institute, which casts its shadow over an unquestionable international prestige, is currently threatened by the vibrant scientific-technical revolution that Neuroscience is experiencing in the developed world. The need to incorporate new lines of research and management, to update and expand its facilities and to have an impact on this new time from clinical translationality and social commitment make the need for an ambitious strategic plan that consolidates the IC as an imperative international benchmark.\n\nYear of building-up 1989.\n\n2.545 m² built on two floors, which should accommodate:\n\n25 RESEARCH GROUPS\n\n11 CORE FACILITIES\n\n3 UNITS: Administration; General Services and Warehouse\n\nCAJAL LEGACY\n\nTo meet this objective, it has been considered necessary to move the current headquarters of the Institute in Madrid to a new headquarters and thus insert the research capacity of the IC in new niches of innovation, training and transfer through its future neighbor the Cajal International Neuroscience Center (CINC). This project will notably reinforce a University Campus of Biomedicine in which consolidated public organizations (Universit y and University Hospitals, and CSIC) would participate to ensure the success of the project. This multi-institutional and complementary environment in terms of its range of activities (academic, researcher and clinical) allows conceiving a development of an innovation network that, in short, aims to transfer to society the advances that affect the improvement of quality of life, and understanding our own human nature.\n\nThe objectives of the strategic plan of the IC 2022-2025 were designed in line with the global challenges of the strategic plan of the CSIC for 2022-2025, the forthcoming National Plan for Research and the EC Program Horizon Europe 2021-2027. The main aim of this alignment is to promote the participation of the research community at the IC in the three main research Pillars – Excellence Science, Global Challenges and Innovation – and to contribute to the Spanish scientific leadership. Based on the above analysis, six strategic objectives have been defined. These objectives (01-06) fulfil CSIC global challenges (GCh) A-C as follows:\n\nO1: Scientific integration. To implement a strategic scientific plan by integrating current and novel research lines to produce high-impact outcomes and to develop our capacity to generate and share data and knowledge globally promoting Open Science. (GCh A)\n\nO2: Strengthening of center facilities. Reinforce the center facilities and services to enhance structures for collaboration across departments and with international centres as well as to facilitate the implementation of the plan to attract and promote talent. (GCh C)\n\nO3: Talent attraction and promotion. Establishment of a strategic plan to attract and promote excellent talent to ensure the quality of education and experience which enables students to apply the values, skills, and intellectual discipline they have acquired in their professional careers, and to generate a lifelong sense of connection with the IC. (GCh B)\n\nO4: Internationalization and research alliances. Increase the capacity of the research teams for participating in high- level initiatives to ensure the International Spanish leadership and to reinforce the current collaborations and to establish novel research alliances. (GCh D)\n\nO5: Dissemination and Exploitation of project outcomes. Promote outreach activities in order to become visible the project results when achieved and to make use of or derive benefit from the projects results. (GCh E)\n\nO6: Ethics and Gender. Ensure an ethically compliant research center and promote gender equality and diversity. A total of 27 main Outputs are expected to be achieved to meet the above objectives. These outputs are listed at the end\n\nof each relevant section of this proposal.\n\nWe will monitor progress against our priorities, commitments, and will aim at using relevant performance indicators, specific targets, and milestones to ensure that final quality outputs are released in due time to meet the proposed objectives. This monitoring system will cover all the activities proposed in this strategic plan and will enable us to respond to the external environment to apply contingency measures and to update the process as appropriate.\n\nIt is worth to point out that the IC is aware about the importance of the digital resources. Drawing on the COVID19 crisis, the activities proposed in this strategic plan will be able to use the state-of-the-art digital technologies planned in this proposal when needed.\n\n5.1.1. The objectives of the center are mostly related to the Global Challenges A-E\n\nSpecifically, the IC addresses five main scientific GLOBAL CHALLENGES (GCh):\n\n-Consolidate the leading role of the CSIC in scientific policy at an international level with eight relevant contributions in the 2022-25 period. (GCh D). The center expects to coordinate four EU (1-4) and one (5) international research projects:\n\n1- We have been coordinating since 2020 in Spain the initiative “FETOPEN-899616. European coordinated FET Open project of the H2020 program, 2020-2023. “New Blue Revolution through a pioneering pathogen-trapping technology based on bioselective hydrogel-forming proteins”. Scientific Coordinator: Mariano Carrión-Vázquez (PathoGelTrap consortium). We will consolidate it by requesting an EIC Transition project to achieve TRLs 3 and 4 in the period 2022-25. (GCh A1, D2)\n\n2- We have been coordinating since 2018 in Spain the initiative “To determine the role of astrocytes in neurodegenerative diseases”, and we will consolidate it in the period 22-25. Furthermore, we plan to ensure the continuation of existing collaborations and to foster the involvement of the IC researchers in other national and international neuroscience projects such as the US BRAIN Initiative, the EC Human Brain Project, Korea Brain Initiative and Japan BrainMINDS. (GCh A1)\n\n3- In 2020 we opened a translational line of research in “New strategies to combat microbial infections in farmed fish” and we are confident that in the period 2022-2025 we will initiate new disruptive initiatives. One of them can be anticipated: “Enhancers of the enzymatic activity based on low complexity domain proteins” in the area of Biocatalisys”. (GCh A2)\n\n4- In 2019 we opened a line of research to the study the “Regulation of neuronal intrinsic properties by gliotransmitters”.

(GCh A3, C2)\n\n5- We intend to lead from 2022 the international initiative: “Role of astrocytes in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease” within the framework of the ASAP Call, Michel J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson´s Research. (GCh A2 C2)\n\n– Attracting and retaining talent: We promote the recruitment of talent by encouraging the incorporation of R&C contracts by providing a €50,000 startup, provision of laboratory space and constitution of an independent group. Two R&C contracts are being incorporated along 2022. (GCh B3).\n\n-Promote the reinforcement of interaction with universities and research centers (GCh A3 and B5). -To promote the scientific infrastructures of CI2A (GCh A4 and B3).\n\n-Encourage the transfer of knowledge to the productive sector (GCh C2)\n\n-To increase the visibility of the IC research results to the society through social communication media, and informative seminars: “Feria de la Ciencia”, “Open Doors Day”, Researchers’ Night. We have settled a Communication Unit in the IC to coordinate the dissemination of our scientific news on social networks: Twitter, Facebook and You -tube). Also, promotion of the Cajal Legacy exhibitions (GCh B6 and E3).\n\n-Participation in research and innovation initiatives at regional, national and European level (GCh C3).\n\n5.4 Actuaciones Científicas Propuestas / Scientific Proposed Actuations\n\nAt present there is a lively debate about how we could overcome the problem of unraveling the extraordinary structural and functional complexity of the brain. For this reason, several big international projects have been established prompted by the magnitude of the mission and based on the great scientific and social importance of the new strategies developed to explore and better understand the normal brain function and dysfunction.\n\nThere are literally thousands of very good and important subjects and many excellent scientists that can generate plenty of interesting results. However, the original global problem would remain if we do not focus on strategies for the integration of the different results at the multiple levels of complexity. If this is not achieved, it can be said with absolute certainty that we will publish nice papers but we will lose the unique opportunity to go beyond the state of the art in the study of the brain. The question is what can be done with the data and how can it be interpreted.\n\nIt seems that the most appropriate approach is to integrate neuroanatomical information with genetic, molecular and physiological data. This integration would allow the generation of models that present the data in a form that can be used to reason, make predictions and suggest new hypotheses to discover new aspects of the structural and functional organization of the brain (e.g., Markram et al. 2015; DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.09.029). Thus, in our opinion, one of the most important aims of the IC would be to promote interdisciplinary collaboration and data sharing and to demonstrate that close collaboration between groups with expertise in quite different areas —like specialists in neuroanatomy, molecular biology, physiology, data analysis, among others— is the best strategy to take advantage of the expertise of the IC. At the same time, this would contribute to accelerate the study of the brain in both health and disease. In this regard, a major strength of the IC is the great variety of research interests of its investigators within the broad topic of Neuroscience. This allows a strong level of in-house collaborations and availability of complementary expertise. Indeed, over the last few years, we have already established collaborations between different laboratories of the IC, and our plan is to foster these in-house collaborations. Also, it is important to point out that even though the number of PIs of the IC is relatively small when compared to other institutions with similar output and international profile, many of its PIs have a good reputation in their respective fields. This translates into a wide impact of the institute at a national and international level. The current IC faculty has been ranked top as either “very good” or “excellent” by CSIC intra-mural scoring. The rate of success of IC researchers in applications at national research funding agencies is 100%, which an outstanding achievement on all counts.\n\nConsidering the extraordinary complexity of the brain, we will particularly focus on four major brain regions: neocortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and olfactory pathways. These regions have also been selected because they are involved in a number of devastating brain and spinal cord disorders (including Alzheimer’ disease, epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, stroke and multiple sclerosis) and because research teams of the IC are highly qualified scientists specialized in these regions and brain disorders.\n\nThe integration of the research activities is based on the collaborative network between research groups. The general objectives of the scientific strategy as well as the work plan broken-down into tasks were outlined above, see Section 5.3.\n\nOpen Science\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, this plan follows an open-science approach. The research results will be publicly available following the CSIC policy set up at this end. Research results will be uploaded to the institutional repository Digital. CSIC, which organize, preserve and spread the research results produced at CSIC. As well as that, other thematic repositories, such as such as Zenodo, bioRxiv or arXiv, could be used if needed. Specifically, the IC will encourage the Open Access publications of the peer-reviewed publications, as well as other publications, generated within this plan.\n\nCoordination and management\n\nThe coordination and management of the strategic plan will be carried out by a Coordination Team that will be led by the director of the IC in close collaboration with the scientific committee of the Institute and the Scientific Faculty.\n\nReinforcement of the IC: Facilities (GCh B3)\n\nThe IC is a well-equipped research center (though in many technologies we are well far from reaching top-notch state- of-the art) to develop the current research activities. To implement the present strategic plan, a reinforcement of these facilities is foreseen to ensure the accomplishment of the planned activities. This effort will be focused on the move, the upgrade of the existing facilities and the acquisition of new equipment. Particularly, The IC will promote the creation of new services, including:\n\n1. Analysis of functional image and chemo/optogenetics;\n\n2. Functional phenotyping;\n\n3. Bioinformatics and Omics Hub TECHNOLOGY UNIT;\n\n4. Nanomanipulation;\n\n5. Mechanics and Electronics Service;\n\n6. Service of neuronal actuators;\n\nThe goal of this reinforcement is to facilitate addressing neuroscience challenges by using multidisciplinary approaches. Furthermore, this update will ensure the continuation of existing collaborations and to foster the involvement of the IC researchers in other national and international neuroscience projects such as the US BRAIN Initiative, the EC Human Brain Project, Korea Brain Initiative and Japan BrainMINDS, etc.\n\nThe move to a new building is a cornerstone in this plan. This move constitutes a great opportunity to launch the activities proposed and mainly for those related to the Program to attract and retain people as well as for the scientific activities with respect to the scientific facilities. The move will facilitate the incorporation of new staff as well as the setting up of the research facilities. Supporting funds from the CSIC and from this action will cover the update and acquisition of new equipment. Specifically, the state-of the-art technologies, opto-chemo genetics and cutting-edge microscopy (high-resolution, two-photon, clearing, etc.) will be upgraded. In addition, the Imaging Core will be expanded by adding a Functional Unit with dedicated equipment for head-fixed and freely moving live cellular imaging. This upgrade will allow flexible access to an expanding toolbox of cell-specific viral transducers to perform multi- cellular, cell-type specific imaging, and to combine it with optogenetics studies and behavioral tests. Moreover, a Neuroinformatics Tools Unit will be set up in collaboration with IT experts to ensure the accomplishment of the scientific plan. Also, promotion of the Cerebral Image Unit by installing together with the Albira II SPECT-CT a modern transmission electron microscope together with RMI (ICON Bruker) is essential for a modern international research center. A new omics Hub TECHNOLOGY UNIT, equipped with massive genome sequencers, flow cell sorters and specialized bioinformatician personnel will introduce IC and CINC researchers and other collaborators on the biomedical big data research."
