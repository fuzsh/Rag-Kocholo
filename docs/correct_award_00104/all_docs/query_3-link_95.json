        "text": "Deborah Tall’s final collection Afterings, is a remarkable volume by a poet and nonfiction writer at the peak of her powers. Eavan Boland has called it \"an essential collection,\" and Mary Ruefle says the poems have \"not what is to be expected – hints of cessation – but an overwhelming sense of blossoming.\"\n\nDeborah Tall edited Seneca Review for twenty-five years, until 2006. Her previous book of poems Summons was chosen by Charles Simic for Sarabande Books’ Kathryn Morton A. Prize. From Where We Stand: Recovering a Sense of Place was reprinted recently by Syracuse University Press. Her final book of nonfiction, A Family of Strangers, a book length lyric essay, was a finalist for the National Jewish Book Award in biography/autobiography in 2006.\n\nClick Here to Buy Afterings\n\nDrinks at the Stand-Up Tragedy Club by Jim Crenner\n\n\"Jim Crenner's is a poetry that sees through civilization and time while employing all the graces and grace notes available to both. . . . Here are the detailed days of our lives and our larger culture. Here is an educated wit applied to a learned self-awareness. Here are mythological characters reborn alongside our versions of their lives. Here, too, one will come upon an amazing reincarnation of an erotic Emily Dickinson. Try doing that.

Click here to order.\n\nThe poetry of Eleanor Ross Taylor has been acclaimed for decades by such poets as Randall Jarrell, Richard Howard, and Adrienne Rich. Now fifteen poets and critics join those luminaries in celebrating her distinct and dazzling poems in this collection of essays edited by Jean Valentine. A beacon for Southern writers, feminists, and those who hunger for a linguistically rich and musical poetry, Eleanor Ross Taylor is, as Adrienne Rich has said, one of the poetic \"lighthouse keepers\" of the century.\n\n\"Eleanor Taylor is a national treasure, a major figure among the generations of American poets, one who deserves our full appreciation and gratitude. The Lighthouse Keeper, a gathering of gifted poets and critics celebrating her art, each viewing it from a different angle, adds directly to our pleasure and understanding of her extraordinary accomplishment. She has given us a lifetime's wealth of wonderful poems, and it is an honor for me enthusiastically to recommend this \"first bright book of homage,\" The Lighthouse Keeper, to serious readers everywhere.\"-George Garrett\n\nFor decades, Elanor Ross Taylor's remarkable poems have followed the mind's passionate and peculiar motion, extending a classical Modernist tradition to the underground life of women, loosing raw nerves, dangerous loyalty, bitter love, and trust in disruption, hesitation, silence. These essays recognize Taylor's habit of thinking and speaking-her vividly strange, brilliantly complex, elegant and colloquial collages-as necessary to our measure of contemporary poetry. This is an essential book for and about an essential poet.-Joyce Peseroff\n\nBorn in 1920 in North Carolina, Eleanor Ross Taylor has lived for many years in Charlottesville, Virginia. She has published five volumes of poems: Wilderness of Ladies, 1960; Welcome Eumenides, 1972; New and Selected Poems, 1983; Days Going / Days Coming Back, 1992; and Late Leisure, 1999. Her awards include the 1998 Shelley Memorial Prize from the Poetry Society of America.\n\nTHE FIFTIES and THE SIXTIES\n\nA complete reprinting of The Fifties and The Sixties, that dramatic and influential magazine edited by Robert Bly and William Duffy.

Click here to order.\n\nISBN: 0-934888-01-9.\n\nAlbert Goldbarth's innovative book examines Paris of the '20's through the comings and goings of one of the most striking characters of that brilliant time, Vander Clyde/Barbette, the lonesome youngster from Round Rock, Texas, and the brilliant entertainer celebrated by Cocteau, Janet Flanner and others. A combination of history, reportage, imagination, energetic prose and marvelous poetry, Different Fleshes is a daring achievement.\n\n\". . . a crazily associative narrative of remarkable inventiveness and energy\"-Library Journal\n\n\"Different Fleshes comes closest to recounting a historical narrative but . . . takes as much pleasure in pursuing a sheer wealth of suggestive tangents and backwaters in the material, merely because they are there . . . [This] habit of discovery is Goldbarth's own 'secret mark'; he is an encyclopedist of the imagination . . . .\"-American Poetry Review\n\nTO KEEP MOVING -- ESSAYS 1959-1969, by Donald Hall. Paperbound, $5.95. Click here to order.\n\nISBN: 0-934888-02-7\n\nThe essays collected in this book range from Hall's influential introduction to the 1961 Penguin Anthology, Contemporary American Poets, to considerations of both past and present English and American poets. \"Typically the modern artist... has acted as if restlessness were a conviction, and has destroyed his own past in order to create a future. He has said to himself, like the policeman to the vagrant, 'Keep moving.'\" Full of provocative ideas and ruminations in Hall's inimitable style.\n\nIn Place: Poems by Toni Flores, edited by Deborah Tall. Paperbound, $10. Click here to order.\n\nISBN 0-934888-16-7\n\nIn Place is a collection of poems by the late Toni Flores, an anthropologist with a special interest in folklore, folk art, and traditional life, particularly as experienced by women. Her poetry was often occasioned by her fieldwork, though in later years her poems turned increasingly inward. Flores's scholarly work was published widely in her lifetime and included research on humanistic anthropology, field poetry, ethnicity and gender, the birthing movement, ethnic cooking, Mexican folk artist Teodora Blanco, and nineteenth-century feminist Matilda Joslyn Gage. She was the influential poetry editor of Anthropology and Humanism Quarterly, and taught from 1971 until her death in 1997 at Hobart and William Smith Colleges, where she was treasured by generations of students.\n\n\"When an anthropologist of her kind finds she has to come out with poetry, we should listen carefully because such a person is super-excellently informed about how the world is . . . Such a poet has her ear to the ground of the planet itself. She is making nothing up.\" -From the Introduction by Edith Turner\n\n\"Those who did not know Toni Flores in life can gain a keen sense of her from the lines of her poems. An unobtrusive style, yet with quiet music (\"all the sweet secretions\"), description that can become depth, depth of joy arriving (\"I am drunk on bread . . . \") and of life ending (\"My own death uncurls inside me . . . \"). One has a sense of someone who lived and wrote with uncompromising clarity, as if there were no other way.\"-Dell Hymes, University of Virginia\n\nA blacksmith once told me\n\nthat iron is stupid.\n\nIt cannot tell the hammer\n\nfrom the anvil\n\nbut takes it blows\n\nfrom both sides at once.\n\n-\"What the Blacksmith Said,\" by Toni Flores"
