        "text": "October\n\nA translation by Grecia Alvarez\n\nBU Today regularly publishes pieces of student scholarship and creative work. Grecia Alvarez (CAS’07) hopes to use her education in English and Spanish literature to work as a librarian in a Spanish-speaking country. She is from Miami and is passionate about prodemocratic movements in Cuba. She has been a contributor to, and editor of, Pusteblume, a student journal of translation, and has also contributed to The Journal of the Core Curriculum.\n\nThe translation of this poem by prolific Spanish poet Juan Ramón Jiménez is reprinted from The Brownstone Journal No. 13, Spring 2006, BU’s journal of undergraduate scholarship and research. Published under the auspices of the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program, it can be found online at http://bu.edu/brownstone. Jiménez (1881–1958), who received the Nobel Prize in 1956, was a principal collaborator, along with Baudelaire, Valéry, and Guillén, in the development of “poesia pura.” This concept of “pure poetry” turned away from what its proponents decried as the convention and affect of Romanticism, striving for an unornamented and more genuine poetic work.\n\nOctober\n\nBy Juan Ramón Jiménez\n\nTranslated by Grecia Alvarez\n\nI was laying on the ground, facing\n\nThe infinite countryside of Castile,\n\nEnveloped by autumn in the yellow\n\nSweetness of its clear setting sun.\n\nSlowly, the plough, split in parallels\n\nThe dark earth and the simple\n\nOpened hand released the seed\n\nInto its honorably broken bosom.\n\nI thought I’d rip out my heart, and put it,\n\nFull of its high and deep feeling,\n\nIn the wide and tender furrow of dirt;\n\nTo see if once broken and planted\n\nThe spring might show the world\n\nThe tree of pure and eternal love.\n\nOctubre\n\nBy Juan Ramón Jiménez\n\nEstaba echado yo en la tierra, enfrente\n\nDel infinito campo de Castilla\n\nQue el otoño envolvía en la amarilla\n\nDulzura de su claro sol poniente.\n\nLento, el arado, paralelamente\n\nAbría el haza oscura, y la sencilla\n\nMano abierta dejaba la semilla\n\nEn su entraña partida honradamente.\n\nPensé arrancarme el corazón, y echarlo,\n\nPleno de su sentir alto y profundo,\n\nAl ancho surco del terruño tierno;\n\nA ver si con romperlo y con sembrarlo,\n\nLa primavera le mostraba al mundo\n\nEl árbol puro del amor eterno."
