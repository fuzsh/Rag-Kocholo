        "text": "Kaigado Gallery is pleased to announce that Yoko Yamamoto’s solo exhibition is held in this month as usual. This year, we will introduce a series of the copper paintings from a Spanish book of poems and drawings “Platero and I”.\n\n“Platero and I”, a collection of prose poems written by Juan Ramón Jiménez (1881-1958), the Spanish poet who won the Nobel Prize for Literature, was originally published in 1917. A new Japanese version of “Platero and I”, which translated into Japanese by a soprano singer, Mutsumi Hatano, and its illustrations are drawn by Yoko Yamamoto was published last year. This time, Kaigado Gallery introduces some of the paintings of the main character, Platero the donkey. At the same time, we are exhibiting a selection of beautiful and playful works from Tashinami, Shakespeare, and Home series. Please feel free to stop by.\n\nArtist profile\n\nA copperplate artist.\n\nBorn in 1952 in Saitama, and raised in Osaka, Japan.\n\nGraduated from Kyoto City University of Arts, majoring in Western-style painting.\n\nThe Seibu Prize of the Japan Contemporary Print Award Exhibition, 1978\n\nKyoto City Art Newcomer’s Award, 1980\n\nKorea International Print Biennial Award of Excellence 1983\n\nKodansha Publishing Culture Award, Book Design Award 1992\n\nKyoto Prefecture Culture Award for Distinguished Service 2007\n\nKyoto Art and Culture Prize in 2011\n\nKyoto City Cultural Merit Award in 2013\n\nYoko Yamamoto has established her own world of copperplate printing with urban, light and stylish colors, and she has developed a genre-crossing collaboration that fuses painting with music and poetry.
