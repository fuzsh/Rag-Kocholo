        "text": "(1881–1958). One of the Spanish-language poets strongly influenced by the Nicaraguan poet Rubén Darío, Juan Jiménez rejected his early sentimental and ornate poetry in the middle of his career for the lyrical and pure free-verse form. He was awarded the Nobel prize for literature in 1956. (See also Spanish literature.)\n\nJuan Ramón Jiménez was born in Moguer, Spain, on Dec. 24, 1881. He attended the University of Seville, and at the invitation of Darío went to Madrid to write. His first two books, Almas de violeta (Souls of Violet, published in Spanish in 1900) and Ninfeas (Water Lilies, 1900), are so sentimental that he later came to despise them. His other early works—Jardines lejanos (Distant Gardens, 1905), Elegías (Elegies, 1908), and Pastorales (Pastorals, 1911)—reflect the influence Darío had on him.\n\nIn 1916 Jiménez went to the United States, where he married Zenobia Camprubí Aymar, a translator of Hindu poetry. In 1916 he published Diario de un poeta recién casado (Diary of a Poet Recently Married), which marks his transition to free verse. After the Spanish Civil War ended in 1939, he and his wife went into voluntary exile in Puerto Rico. In 1957 he published an English translation of his novel Platero y yo (Platero and I, 1914), the story of a man and his donkey. His later books of poetry include Poesía en prosa y verso (Poetry in Prose and Verse, 1932) and Voces de mi copla (Voices of My Song, 1945). Jiménez died in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on May 29, 1958."
