        "text": "Research and Teaching\n\nProfessor Maurer teaches and writes about Spanish poetry with special emphasis on poetry’s relations with music and painting, translation, and textual criticism. He also teaches in Boston University’s MFA program in Literary Translation. His first book was a biography and edition of the sixteenth-century poet Francisco de Figueroa and his most recent, with Andrew A. Anderson, Federico Garcia Lorca en Nueva York y La Habana: Cartas y recuerdos.\n\nMaurer is the editor of García Lorca’s Collected Poems and Selected Verse; his lectures (Conferencias); his early prose (Prosa inédita de juventud), and editor, with Andrew A. Anderson, of García Lorca’s complete letters (Epistolario completo). His translated books include New Letters to a Young Poet by Joan Margarit; Lorca’s Deep Song and Other Prose, In Search of Duende; A Season in Granada; a collection of letters between Lorca and Salvador Dalí (Sebastian’s Arrows published by Swan Isle Press), The Art of Worldly Wisdom by Baltasar Gracián; an anthology of Gracián’s other writings (A Pocket Mirror for Heroes); Running Back Through the Rain (co-translated with Ben Heller) by Raúl Barrientos; and The Complete Perfectionist: A Poetics of Work by Juan Ramón Jiménez (Spanish translation by Andrés Soria Olmedo, 2016, Madrid, Fundamentos). His biography of American painter and writer Walter Inglis Anderson won the 2003 Eudora Welty Award and the Non Fiction Prize of the Mississippi Academy of Arts and Letters.\n\nMaurer’s digital humanities project “Streets and Dreams” mapped Lorca’s movements in New York (1929-30) and coincided with the exhibition “Back Tomorrow: Lorca, Poet in New York” at the New York Public Library, co-curated with Andrés Soria Olmedo. In 2019, Maurer curated the exhibition “Jardín deschecho: Lorca y el amor” at the Centro Federico García Lorca, Granada. He is an Académico Correspondiente of the Real Academia Española, ‘Official’ in the Orden de Isabel la Católica, and Académico Electo of the Academia Norteamericana de la Lengua Española.\n\nMaurer’s courses and seminars have studied the 20th-century reception of Baroque authors in Spain and Latin America, the uses of archives, Spanish language poets in New York, contemporary adaptations of works by Lorca, the historical avant-garde, and the intersection of lives and texts (biography, epistolography, and textual criticism.)\n\nIn 2022, Maurer was inducted into the Academia Norteamericana de la Lengua Española as “Académico de Número”."
