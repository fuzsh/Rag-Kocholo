        "text": "I TOOK OFF PETAL AFTER PETAL\n\nby Juan Ramon Jiminez\n\nTranslation by Robert Bly\n\nI took off petal after petal, as if you were a rose,\n\nin order to see your soul,\n\nand I didn’t see it.\n\nHowever, everything around-\n\nhorizons of fields and oceans-\n\neverything, even what was infinite,\n\nwas filled with a perfume,\n\nimmense and living.\n\nThe original Spanish:\n\nTe dehojé, como una rosa,\n\npara verte tu alma,\n\ny no la vi.\n\nMas todo en torno\n\n–horizontes de tierras y de mares–,\n\ntodo, hasta el infinito,\n\nse colmó de una esencia\n\ninmensa y viva.\n\n© 1973, 1997 by Robert Bly.\n\nJuan Ramon Jimenez (1881-1958) was a member of the modernistas, a group of writers who, in the wake of Spain’s loss of her colonies to the United States in 1898, staged a literary revival. He published his first two books of poetry at the age of eighteen in 1900, and went on to author an extensive library of books of poetry as well as to translate works of other authors. Jimenez is considered one of the greatest Spanish poets of the 20th century, and he won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1956.\n\nEditor’s Note: In addition to his poetry and his translations, Jimenez is perhaps best known for some of his famous quotes. Among them is the quote that inspired today’s post: “If they give you ruled paper, write the other way.” (Thank you to my mother for the quote.) I also quite appreciate this one: “Literature is a state of culture, poetry is a state of grace, before and after culture.”\n\nFor a fun experiment in translation, visit this Google translation of some of Jimenez’s poems. I think it shows that the modern world is not ready to replace translators with technology just yet, particularly in the medium of poetry. A great companion read is Okla Elliot’s article, “The Art of Translation.”"
