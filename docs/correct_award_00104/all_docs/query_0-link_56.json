        "text": "Juan Ramón Jiménez (1881-1958) was a prolific Spanish poet, translator and critic who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1956. He was an advocate of the concept of ‘pure poetry’— lyrical poetry that celebrate and explore the musical nature of language itself, rather than encumbering it with the burden of didacticism. Jiménez married Zenobia Camprubi Aymar, who translated the works of Rabindranath Tagore to Spanish.\n\nThe Street Is Waiting For The Night…\n\nThe street is waiting for the night.\n\nAll is history and silence.\n\nThe trees along the walk\n\nare asleep along the sky.\n\nAnd the sad sky is violet.\n\nan April sky, beautiful\n\nviolet sky with gentle\n\npreludes of starlight.\n\nNow the lamps are shining\n\nat the barred windows. A dog whines\n\nat a closed door. A black cat\n\ntwirls in the smooth sky …\n\nAh! that yellow lamp,\n\nthe peace of the blind children,\n\nthe nostalgia of the widows,\n\nthe presence of the dead!\n\nAnd the stories that we told\n\non those April evenings\n\nthat have never returned,\n\nwhile we gazed at the stars!\n\nAnd the darkness is falling,\n\nsweet and great and peaceful,\n\namong the distant murmurs\n\nof the little villages …\n\nTranslated by Lysander Kemp\n\nWho Knows What Is Going On\n\nWho knows what is going on on the other side of each hour?\n\nHow many times the sunrise was\n\nthere, behind a mountain!\n\nHow many times the brilliant cloud piling up far off\n\nwas already a golden body full of thunder!\n\nThis rose was poison.\n\nThat sword gave life.\n\nI was thinking of a flowery meadow\n\nat the end of a road,\n\nand found myself in the slough.\n\nI was thinking of the greatness of what was human,\n\nand found myself in the divine.\n\nTranslated by Robert Bly"
