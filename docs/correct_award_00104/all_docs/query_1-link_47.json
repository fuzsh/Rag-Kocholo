        "text": "My research is interdisicplinary — it overlaps computational/theory, organic chemistry and physical/inorganic chemistry. It is international — I have coauthored papers with other researchers from over 20 countries. It is eclectic — it spans the periodic table as well as the gas and condensed phases. These studies involve the Interplay of molecular structure and energetics; chemical bonding theory; quantum chemistry and calorimetry; rules and regularities of chemical phenomena. We have investigated the energetics of neutrals and related ions; species stabilized by aromaticity and/or those destabilized by antiaromaticity and strained rings; compounds containing novel functionalities and their energetics. Not merely organic compounds, but also those of the nonmetals and metalloids, we have especially explored species containing fluorine, the noble gases and boron — we have generally been interested in exotic structures and corresponding energetics.\n\nSelected Journal Articles\n\nM.
