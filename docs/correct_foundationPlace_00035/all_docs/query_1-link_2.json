Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA grants you a non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable (except as expressly granted in this Agreement), license to:\n\nFor non-production use without an NVIDIA AI Enterprise subscription: (a) install and use copies of the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models, and (b) create Derivative Models (as defined below), all the foregoing for non-production uses, including test and evaluation uses; and\n\nFor production use with an NVIDIA AI Enterprise subscription: (a) install and use copies of the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models, (b) create Derivative Models (as defined below), (c) deploy NVIDIA AI Foundation Models, and Derivative Models you develop as authorized in this section, on infrastructure you own or lease to offer a service, without distributing NVIDIA AI Foundation Models and Derivative Models, and (d) distribute the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models or Derivative Models in each case with a copy of this Agreement, all the foregoing in production uses in combination with an NVIDIA NIM (an NVIDIA inference microservice runtime), available through a paid subscription of NVIDIA AI Enterprise except as otherwise expressly permitted in section 1.1.3. Contact NVIDIA sales for NVIDIA AI Enterprise (see https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/).\n\nFor production use on PCs or workstations with NVIDIA RTX GPUs without an NVIDIA AI Enterprise subscription: (a) install and use copies of the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models, (b) create Derivative Models (as defined below), (c) deploy NVIDIA AI Foundation Models, and Derivative Models you develop as authorized in this section, on infrastructure you own or lease to offer a service, without distributing NVIDIA AI Foundation Models and Derivative Models, and (d) distribute the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models or Derivative Models in each case with a copy of this Agreement, all the foregoing in production uses solely on PCs or workstations with NVIDIA RTX GPUs.\n\nLimited Grants. The grants above are further limited as follows:\n\nYou may use certain NVIDIA AI Foundation Models to create a Custom TTS Application for your own use but cannot offer it as a service to third parties or distribute the Custom TTS Application. You acknowledge and agree that it is your obligation to have sufficient rights or licenses for content used with a Custom TTS Application to generate new content. “Custom TTS Application” means a custom text-to-speech application that enables the creation of synthetic voice output that resembles an input voice.\n\n“Derivative Models” mean all derivatives, adaptations, extensions or enhancements to the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models, works based on the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models, or any other model which is created or initialized by transfer of patterns of the weights, parameters, activations or output of the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models, to the other model, in order to cause the other model to perform similarly to the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models, including - but not limited to - distillation methods entailing the use of intermediate data representations or methods based on the generation of synthetic data by the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models for training the other model.\n\nUse and Distribution. The following terms apply to the use or distribution of the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models and Derivative Models you develop as authorized in Section 1, and you are responsible for the consequences of non-conformance with these terms:\n\nThe NVIDIA AI Foundation Models and Derivative Models must only be used or distributed for purposes that are: permitted by this Agreement, consistent with the rights of others, and do not violate any applicable laws or regulations.\n\nYou may not use the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models, Derivative Models or any output or results of them to develop or improve any other large language or generative AI models (excluding NVIDIA AI Foundation Models or Derivative Models).\n\nYou may not change or remove copyright or other proprietary notices in the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models or misrepresent the authorship of the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models, and you must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files such that modifications are not misrepresented as an original NVIDIA AI Foundation Models.
