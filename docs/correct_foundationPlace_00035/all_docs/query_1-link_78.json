        "text": "Overview#\n\nThe U.S. government regulates the transfer of information, commodities, technology and software considered to be strategically important to the U.S. in the interest of national security, economic and/or foreign policy concerns. Many countries outside of the U.S. have similar controls on exports for the same reasons.\n\nThere is a complex network of U.S. agencies and inter-related regulations that govern exports collectively referred to as âExport Controls.â\n\nIt is the policy of Mattermost to comply with all export compliance laws in all countries in which it transacts business. Because Mattermost is a U.S.-based global company, our products, collectively referred to as âCommodities,â which include our software as well as our equipment, materials and services, are subject to the export laws and regulations of every country in which we conduct business. Non-compliance with export control regulations can subject Mattermost and its affiliates, including its customers, employees and business partners to criminal and civil penalties, the seizure of assets, the denial of export privileges, and suspension or debarment from Government Contracts.\n\nFor these reasons, please take the time to familiarize yourself with applicable export (and import) controls in the jurisdictions in which you operate. Although Mattermost cannot provide advice on export matters, this web page provides the information needed in order to export Mattermost products.\n\nThis overview is specific to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR), however, business operations may subject you to other regulations such as the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.\n\nExport classification and licensing#\n\nAlthough what is subject to the Export Administration Regulations is quite broad, that does not mean an export license is required for every transaction. The foundation of understanding export controls related to hardware, software and technology can be found within the Commerce Control List (CCL), which has 10 categories, 0-9, and is set up as a positive list. The first step is determining if the item to be exported is subject to the EAR.\n\nAt Mattermost, our fully open source, publicly available software is outside the scope of the EAR, as it is derived from publicly available encryption source code and the complete software package for both the source code (https://github.com/mattermost/) and binary versions are publicly available. Mattermost enterprise software is found in Category 5, Part 2 of the CCL as Telecommunications and Information Security items (hardware, software and technology). Most items in this category have encryption.\n\nOften a license exception under Part 740 is available where a Commerce Control List item lists the available license exception(s) specific to an Export Control Classification Number (ECCN), based on a combination of factors.\n\nMattermost Enterprise Edition (includes Mattermost Professional & Enterprise) is found under ECCN 5D002, with a license exception available from âENCâ for our Enterprise and Professional software, with encryption features derived from open-source software. Encryption products, under the export regulations, have multiple levels of controls and requirements. BIS has a separate section of their website that has an overview, and many links, covering encryption under Encryption and Export Administration Regulations (EAR) that you may want to review. These guidelines include helpful flow charts for determining if an item is subject to encryption controls, tables and other details.\n\nThe other key areas to be aware of for an export of Mattermost software or technology are:\n\nSanctions: There are comprehensive sanctions to Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and other countries/territories with specific prohibitions, such as Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, Venezuela, Myanmar/Burma, and Cambodia. Details can be located at BIS and OFAC. The countries and their sanctions are subject to change.\n\nWMD (Weapons of Mass Destruction): Mattermost, its customers and its business partners may not export to parties involved in proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, along with other prohibited end-uses under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (âEARâ).\n\nGeneral Prohibitions: Information on General Prohibitions under the EAR is located here. Application of the applicability of these General Prohibitions is based on a combination of factors. These include: classification of the commodity, destination, end-user, end-use and conduct.\n\nRestricted Parties: You may not export to parties listed on the US governmentâs restricted parties lists, and should be screening against these prior to export. There is a consolidated screening list provided by the U.S. government at export.gov at no charge that can be used for screening. Additionally, there are specific restrictions on export to military end-users and military intelligence end-users.\n\nDeemed Exports: Release of controlled technology to foreign persons in the U.S. is âdeemedâ to be an export to the personâs country or countries of nationality and is found in 734.2(b) of the EAR, which you can read about under the Export Administration Regulations on the BIS website.\n\nKnow Your Customer: By reviewing the BIS website, you will notice that it is very important to âknow your customers,â and to be aware of âRed Flagsâ. Be sure to screen business partners and customers to ensure compliance.\n\nHow do you ensure personal data stays within European Union?#\n\nWhen the customerâs installation of Mattermost is self-hosted, Mattermost does not process any personal data under the jurisdiction of the data privacy laws governing within the European Union. The Mattermost support team leverages Zendesk customer service software, which hosts Mattermost information within the United States. For more information on Zendesk, please see their Privacy and Data Protection page.\n\nZendesk privacy and data protection safeguards notwithstanding, the provision of support services is part of the contractual obligations between Mattermost and its customers. In order for Mattermost to provide such support, a customer must be able to identify as a licensed user, therefore requiring the user to provide personal data to the support agent. Regardless of where the support agent is located, the personal data will indeed be hosted outside of the EU.\n\nHowever, pursuant to Section (b) of Article 49 of GDPR, transfers of personal data which are ânecessary for the performance of a contract between the data subject and the controllerâ may be transferred to a third country or international organization. Accordingly these transfers would be done in alignment with the requirements of GDPR. For more information, see our Mattermost Privacy Policy page.\n\n*DISCLAIMER: MATTERMOST DOES NOT POSITION ITS PRODUCTS AS âGUARANTEED COMPLIANCE SOLUTIONSâ. WE MAKE NO GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL ACHIEVE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE USING MATTERMOST PRODUCTS. YOUR LEVEL OF SUCCESS IN ACHIEVING REGULATORY COMPLIANCE DEPENDS ON YOUR INTERPRETATION OF THE APPLICABLE REGULATION, AND THE ACTIONS YOU TAKE TO COMPLY WITH THEIR REQUIREMENTS. SINCE THESE FACTORS DIFFER ACCORDING TO INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES, WE CANNOT GUARANTEE YOUR SUCCESS, NOR ARE WE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OF YOUR ACTIONS. NO GUARANTEES ARE MADE THAT YOU WILL ACHIEVE ANY SPECIFIC COMPLIANCE RESULTS FROM THE USE OF MATTERMOST OR FROM ANY RECOMMENDATIONS CONTAINED ON OUR WEBSITES, AND AS SUCH, THIS SHOULD NOT BE A SUBSTITUTE TO CONSULTING WITH YOUR OWN LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE REPRESENTATIVES ON THESE MATTERS."
