        "text": "IMPORTANT: Please read this End User Agreement (“Agreement”) before installing or using any Products or services that you or the entity that you represent (“End User” or “Customer”) obtain from Pure Storage, Inc. (“Pure”) or from any third party authorized by Pure to resell the Products and services. By installing or using the Products or services, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind End User and agree that End User is bound by this Agreement with Pure, unless a separate written agreement is in effect that specifically governs the subject matter of your purchase.\n\n1. UNIVERSAL END USER TERMS (APPLICABLE TO ALL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES).\n\n1.1 Purchases Made Via Pure’s Authorized Resellers. Except for Pay-As-You-Go Software Licenses (as described in the Portworx Terms), all other Products and services are purchased via a Pure authorized reseller. All pricing, payment, and delivery terms (including risk of loss) for all Products and services are set forth in the order between End User and the applicable Pure authorized reseller.\n\n1.2 Pure’s Retained Rights. Except for title to the underlying hardware for hardware purchases (as described in Section 2 herein) or Evergreen//Flex (as describe in Section 3.3 herein), Pure and its suppliers exclusively retain all right, title and interest, in all intellectual property rights, including, without limitation, patent, trademark, trade name and copyright, whether registered or not registered, in and to the Products and related documentation, and any modifications, improvements, enhancements, customizations, updates, or derivative works thereof. Pure and its suppliers reserve all rights not expressly granted herein, and no other license or other implied rights of any kind are granted or conveyed. In the event that items of software code provided with the Products are subject to “open source” or “free software” licenses, nothing herein limits End User’s rights under, or grants rights that supersede, the applicable license therefore. End User grants to Pure a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, sublicenseable, fully paid-up and royalty-free right to modify and use any Feedback in any manner, provided that Feedback is anonymized and does not identify End User.\n\n1.3 Product Restrictions. End User shall not directly or indirectly (a) reproduce, modify, distribute, assign, disclose or make available any portion of the Products (or any related documentation) to any third party (except as otherwise authorized herein); (b) rent, lease or sublicense the Products; (c) reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any portion of the Products, or otherwise attempt to decrypt, extract or derive source code for, or any algorithms or data structures embodied within, any portion of the Products (except to the extent the foregoing restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law); (d) use the Products to develop a similar product or service; (e) transfer or copy any software in the Products to, or use such software on, any other product or device, including any second-hand or gray market hardware that End User has not purchased from Pure or a Pure authorized reseller; or (f) publish or disclose to any third party any technical features, performance or benchmark tests, or comparative or competitive analyses relating to the Products, except for internal use by the End User or as may be authorized by Pure in writing. End User will remain fully and primarily responsible to Pure for compliance with this Agreement if End User permits any third party to access the Products or services. Any future release, update, or other addition to functionality of the Products made available by Pure to End User shall be subject to this Agreement, unless Pure expressly states otherwise. End User shall preserve and shall not remove, obscure or alter any copyright labels or other proprietary notices in the Products or related documentation.\n\n1.4 Data Privacy. If End User provides personal data to Pure, the parties will ensure that such personal data is disclosed and handled in accordance with all applicable data protection laws and the confidentiality provisions set forth in this Agreement. End User acknowledges and agrees that Pure does not host or have read or write access to the End User data stored on the Products. End User is solely responsible for data (including personal data) managed or stored using the Products and for compliance with all applicable data privacy laws related thereto, and where required by applicable law, additional terms and conditions may apply. To the extent Pure receives personal data from End User, the Pure Storage Privacy Notice shall apply to Pure’s management and usage of such data.\n\n1.5 Products, Services, and Subscriptions in the Data Center. End User acknowledges and agrees that it is exclusively responsible for backing up its own data and placement and use of all Products and services in a secure network environment with security access controls and data back-up processes consistent with then-current data center and network security policies and procedures. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, it is expressly understood by the parties that Pure does not host or have read or write access to the End User data stored on the Products.\n\n1.6 Product Diagnostic Reporting. End User acknowledges that the Products store certain diagnostic information about the routine operations of the Product, including performance, capacity usage, data reduction ratios, configuration data, and hardware faults (“Pure1® Reports”) and, when enabled by End User, periodically transmit these Pure1 Reports to Pure and authorized End User partners. End User understands and agrees that End User data stored on the Products is not accessed, transmitted or provided to Pure or any third party as part of the Pure1 Reports. Pure retains all rights, title, and interest in the Pure1 Reports. End User agrees that the collection and transmission of such Pure1 Reports is necessary to facilitate any subscription services and certain support services under an Evergreen subscription.\n\n1.7 Unsupported Third Party Products. Pure will use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the Services for any Unsupported Operating Systems. Pure’s ability to provide any Services or Products is contingent upon all items in End User’s environment, including non-Pure hardware, products, and operating software, being up to date with the current supported version by the original manufacturer. End User is responsible for informing Pure of any connection to, interaction with, or dependency upon any expired or Unsupported Operating Systems or hardware in End User’s environment. “Unsupported Operating System” or “Unsupported OS” means any operating system for which the original manufacturer has declared it to be unsupported or otherwise outside of support options provided by the original manufacturer. End User shall notify Pure of any expired or Unsupported OS or hardware at least 14 days prior to the installation of any new Product or the commencement of any Services. End User assumes all risks, and Pure disclaims any and all liability associated with or related to any expired or Unsupported OS or hardware, regardless of whether Pure is informed or not.\n\n1.8 Purity Versions. Pure reserves the right to require End User to upgrade their version of Purity in order to provide any Products or Services described in this Agreement. Applying Purity software updates may include improvements to address security vulnerabilities, whereby upon installation End User acknowledges and agrees that the specific nature of such updates is Confidential Information of the parties and cannot be disclosed as disclosure exposes both parties to mutual risk exposure.\n\n1.9 Equipment Trade-Ins and Loans. End User must return any hardware Product within 100 days from the date of such order acceptance by Pure, where such order included a credit, discount, or other incentive in exchange for End User’s commitment to return such hardware Product to Pure.

This Section 8.3 states Pure’s entire liability, and End User’s sole and exclusive remedy, for infringement claims and actions.
