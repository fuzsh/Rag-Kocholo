        "text": "My father took photos and developed black and white film by himself. Sometimes he let me click the shutter. I liked the sound of the old Soviet rangefinder camera, the Zorkiy (Vigilant).\n\nI learnt to photograph by myself, with the help of Google. Using the internet, I studied the work of classic photographers, like Robert Capa, Don McCullin and James Nachtwey. Later, I started to watch news feeds of top agencies and discover for myself contemporary photojournalists.\n\nI became a photographer to meet interesting people and observe historical events with my own eyes. In addition, it is very interesting to visit a variety of places I would never have been without being a photographer â from sport competition to frontline conflict.\n\nCovering the Eastern Ukrainian conflict for me is a proficiency test. These events influenced me both as a photojournalist and as a person. From one point of view, it is big historical news and I am proud to cover them. But from another â great sorrow of my Motherland, and I wish these events had never happened.\n\nAny kind of assignment is like a challenge for me. So I try to do different kinds of photography. Documentary stories need more thinking, but shooting breaking news is about reflexes and fast interacting. Both kinds are available in hostile environments, which interests me the most.\n\nThe importance of photojournalism is in its ability to empathize different emotions with people who are depicted in the photo. In addition, it is a window into other cultures."
