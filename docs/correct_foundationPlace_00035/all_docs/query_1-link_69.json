        "text": "This is an ADVANCED elective course within the International Development Track of the MITx MicroMasters program in Data, Economics, and Design of Policy (DEDP), which provides a path toward the Masterâ€™s in DEDP at MIT. Five total courses (3 core, 2 electives) are needed to complete the International Development MicroMasters Program Credential in DEDP. For more information on DEDP MicroMasters program requirements, please visit our FAQ page.\n\nIn this course, we will study the different facets of human development in topics such as education, health, gender, the family, land relations, risk, informal and formal norms, public policy, and institutions. While studying each of these topics, we will delve into the following questions:\n\nWhat determines the decisions of poor households in developing countries?\n\nWhat constraints are poor households subject to?\n\nWhat is the scope for policy interventions (implemented by the government, international organizations, or NGOs)?\n\nWhat policies have been tried out? Have they been successful?\n\nAt the same time, you will discover modern empirical methods in economics, in particular Randomized Control Trials (RCTs). Throughout the course, we will expose you to all facets of empirical projects, from experimental design and ethical issues, to data collection and data analysis. You will have the chance to gain experience working with real data using software for statistical analysis during weekly assignments.\n\nCourse Previews:\n\nOur course previews are meant to give prospective learners the opportunity to get a taste of the content and exercises that will be covered in each course. If you are new to these subjects, or eager to refresh your memory, each course preview also includes some available resources. These resources may also be useful to refer to over the course of the semester.\n\nA score of 60% or above in the course previews indicates that you are ready to take the course, while a score below 60% indicates that you should further review the concepts covered before beginning the course.\n\nPlease use this link to access the syllabus and this link to access the course preview. Once you have completed this preview, use the answer key to check your answers.\n\nComparing the Audit and Certificate Tracks"
