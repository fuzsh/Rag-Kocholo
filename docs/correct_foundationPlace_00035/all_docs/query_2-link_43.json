The city used to be one of the largest in the country but currently it has turned into the arena of the conflict of the Russian-Ukrainian war. With the population exceeding 1 million people, before the war Donetsk was one of the most important industrial hubs in Ukraine, the capital of coal mining and metallurgy. There were plenty of parks, universities, modern airport and up-to-date world-class stadium in the city. However, as the war is ongoing and the area is administered by pro-Russian self-proclaimed authorities, the city is declining and a large portion of the residents has left to continue living in other places.\n\nWhere is Donetsk, Donetsk Province, Ukraine on Map?\n\nRoad map of Donetsk, Donetsk Province, Ukraine shows where the location is placed.\n\nSatellite Map of Donetsk, Donetsk Province, Ukraine\n\nDonetsk, Donetsk Province, Ukraine Lat Long Coordinates Info"
