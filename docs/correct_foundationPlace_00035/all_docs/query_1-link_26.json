        "text": "The US-based International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) supports citizensâ€™ rights to participate in free and fair elections. Ahead of the 2020 local elections in Ukraine, IFES joined forces with the Ukrainian Central Election Commission and developed voter information posters containing QR codes, which linked to corresponding audio and sign language formats. This information was also published in an official voter education portal called CEC Prosvita. Statistics showed that approximately 6,000 persons used the QR codes.\n\nProblems Targeted\n\nA lack of accessible voter education materials in Ukraine can make it difficult for citizens with auditory and visual disabilities to vote.\n\nSolution, Innovation and Impact\n\nVoters could scan the QR codes with their mobile devices on election day or in advance to access audio and sign language content that outlined the procedures for voting, which took place on 25 October 2020. On election day posters with QR codes were present at every one of the more than 29,000 polling stations across Ukraine, with the exception of the occupied territories of Donetsk, Luhansk, and the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. Volunteers helped visually impaired persons to access the QR codes. The adapted voter education posters were developed as part of a consultative process between the Ukrainian Central Election Commission (CEC) and DPOs that participate in the CEC-led Election Access Working Group. This consultative body was established in December 2019 with the support of the International Foundation for Electoral Systems as a forum for the CEC and DPOs to collaborate on election-related policies, procedures, and regulations aiming to make them more accessible for voters with all types of disabilities.\n\nFunding, Outlook and Transferability\n\nThe CEC requested budget funds from the Ministry of Finance at the beginning of the 2020 election cycle to cover the costs of election-related processes and procedures, including the posters. The Commission plans to use the voter education posters with QR codes again as a tool for reasonable accommodation during the next national elections. The use of QR codes has proven to be an efficient and cost-effective way to disseminate accessible voter education information and could therefore easily be replicated in other countries."
