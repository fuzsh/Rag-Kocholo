The other $10,000 will be provided to other libraries soon.\n\nHere is the list of libraries that have received financial support:\n\nHorodnia Centralized Library System, Horodnia, Chernihiv oblast. The town is situated near the border with Russia and Belarus. It was under occupation for 41 days and continues to be under threat of shelling.

They will purchase equipment (a laptop with accessories and a flipchart) and stationery to be used for programming. Using local community costs and involving volunteers, the Library will open a Hub with free access to the Internet, provide free consultations with psychologists and legal specialists, run cultural, educational and leisure programming helping IDPs and war veterans to adjust the local community and to cope with psychological problems caused by the war.\n\nIzum Central City Library, Izum, Kharkiv oblast. It oversees 10 libraries of the Izyum territorial community. The town was occupied on March 07-September 22, 2022. During the period of hostilities and occupation, the Library suffered great destruction and losses, namely: the library premises were damaged, 40% of the book collection, library furniture, computers, and copying equipment were destroyed.

A vertical lift for the disabled is a specialized mechanism in the form of a cantilever platform.\n\nArbuzynka Central Library, urban village Arbuzynka, Mykolayiv oblast. Mykolayiv oblast is on the front line. To help to reduce the tension and to provide psychological relief to IDPs, the library will organize training for IDPs and interactive games, master classes, competitions, and entertainment events for IDP children and young adults. The library will purchase an interactive whiteboard, educational board games for children and will update its book collection.\n\nNational University “Zaporizhzhia Polytechnic” Scientific Library, Zaporizhzhia. Part of the Zaporizhzhia oblast is occupied by Russian invaders. Zaporizhzhia city is under shelling. From September 2022, educational hubs of the Melitopol and Vasyliv districts of the Zaporizhzhia region, which are currently under occupation, are operating at the library.

They will purchase a projector, a projector screen, and a laptop with accessories.\n\nMyroniv Basic Library, Obukhiv rayon, Kyiv oblast. The Library includes the Myroniv Basic Library (for adults), a branch library for children, and 24 rural branch libraries. At the beginning of the full-scale war, when Russian invaders were near Kyiv, the library opened a Crisis Center, which is still functioning. IDPs, soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine turn to the library’s Crisis Center where they receive psychological and other support as well as take books for reading. The Library will purchase Ukrainian language books to update its book collection so it will be able to continue to provide services to IDPs encouraging them to take books home, become members of library clubs and reading groups, and participate in various leisure programs.\n\nTokmakivka Central Library, Nikopil rayon, Dnipropetrovsk oblast.

Librarians free of charge, within the limits of their competence, help IDPs and other socially vulnerable residents of the community in applying for assistance from international organizations, paying for communal services, searching for job vacancies, and receiving various certificates (about income, about criminal records, details of payment cards). This library will purchase a copying machine with stationery to continue to provide these services to vulnerable population because the outdated library equipment was out of order due to heavy use.\n\nOkhtyrka Public Library, Okhtyrka, Sumy oblast. It includes the Central library and four branch libraries. During the full-scale Russian invasion into the territory of Ukraine, the city of Okhtyrka firmly resisted, its defenders successfully repelled the offensive of the invaders. The city suffered from bombings and Russian airstrikes. Three vacuum bombs and rockets from Russian aircraft partly destroyed the Okhtyrka Public Library’s branches No. 2 (for children) and 3 (for adults). The shock wave knocked out the balcony and entrance doors, seven windows, walls and ceiling; the heating system froze. In 2022, the local authorities provided funding to restore several broken windows and doors and partially carried out the restoration of walls and heating. The library will use funding from the ALA Ukraine Library Relief Fund to repair three library rooms, lighting and to change windows.\n\nMore is needed. Please consider donating.
