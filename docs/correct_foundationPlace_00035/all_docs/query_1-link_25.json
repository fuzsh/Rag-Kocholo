The Ukrainian reconstruction ministry said that Russia had effectively stopped the Black Sea grain deal by refusing to register incoming vessels.\n\nMariupol, a port city on the Sea of Azov, witnessed some of the most intense fighting since Russia launched its invasion. At the time of the siege, Mariupol’s mayor estimated that 90% of the city’s infrastructure had been damaged, 40% of it beyond repair.\n\nUkrainian authorities said the grain being exported from Mariupol was “stolen” from the country, but added that the move is mostly for the purposes of propaganda, as the port is not fully operational.\n\nThe first three and a half thousand tons of Ukrainian grain from Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions were stolen with the help of the Mariupol seaport.\n\n…Petro Andriushchenko, an advisor to the Ukrainian Mayor of Mariupol said."
