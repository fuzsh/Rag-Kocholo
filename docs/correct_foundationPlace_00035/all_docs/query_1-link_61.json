        "text": "ENKA was the prime contractor for the prestigious Shakhtar Donetsk Stadium in Donetsk, Ukraine, the construction of which began in 2006 and was completed in 2009. In order to erect the five-star arena in such a tight schedule, over 1,600 people had to work on site at peak times.\n\nThe stadium has an oval shape with an inclined roof. Inside the stadium there are restaurants, bars, cafes, fast food facilities, a sports center, club museum and shops. The eye-catching stadium was designed by Arup Sport. It is built turnkey as an Elite Class stadium in UEFA Standards.\n\nWith its three-dimensional, structurally efficient design, the roof appears to float above the building at an altitude of 50 m. The shape inclines towards the south, resting on a dozen 60-metre steel support trusses that were manufactured and erected by Çimtaş and maneuvered into place with a giant, 600-ton mobile crane able to lift steel structures in excess of 230 tons. Designed and manufactured by Mero-TSK, these steel support trusses have a combined weight of 4,000 tons and carry the 1,600-ton space-frame structure of the roof. The roof is covered partly with transparent glass panels to allow daylight through and support natural grass growth.\n\nThe pitch infrastructure makes use of the latest technology available at the time. The drainage system incorporates huge blower systems, which suck water from the surface of the pitch and blow it into the drainage piping. This system enabled the very fast dry-out during the EURO 2012 Group Games."
