        "text": "УКРАЇНСЬКОЮ МОВОЮ НА РУССКОМ\n\nDespite the difficult security conditions, our teams are working around the clock to help as many people as possible. Please remember all services provided by humanitarian organizations are free of charge.\n\nMany families are contacting us about their missing loved ones. Due to the exceptionally high volume of requests, it is taking longer for us to respond to requests than expected. If you have already sent an email or left a message, please rest assured that we will contact you as soon as possible.\n\nThis page will be updated frequently as the crisis evolves. Latest update: 28 October 2022.\n\nHow can I contact the Red Cross?\n\nIf you have lost contact with a family member due to the armed conflict in Ukraine, the ICRC's Central Tracing Agency Bureau for the International Armed Conflict between the Russian Federation and Ukraine can help.\n\nTo contact the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) from inside Ukraine:\n\n• Main number 0 800 300 155\n\n• Donetsk 0 800 300 185\n\n• Luhansk 0 800 300 195\n\nIf you are not in Ukraine and need information, you can call our ICRC hotline at +41 22 730 36 00 or send us an email at ctabureau@icrc.org.\n\nIn Ukraine, you can contact the Ukrainian Red Cross Society at 0 800 332 656.\n\nIn Russia, you can contact the Russian Red Cross for questions about humanitarian assistance for migrants, legal residence status, and access to medical services.

We also support hospitals and primary healthcare facilities with medical equipment and emergency preparedness. We repair water stations and support households to rehabilitate their damaged homes. We also help families separated by the armed conflict reconnect.\n\nThis is an extremely dangerous time for families caught in the fighting, and a dangerous time for aid organizations too. However, we are doing our best to scale up our work by deploying more staff and supplies to the region.\n\nHow can you help me find a family member?\n\nIf you lost contact with a family member due to the armed conflict in Ukraine, the ICRC's Central Tracing Agency Bureau for the International Armed Conflict between the Russian Federation and Ukraine can help.

We hope you can stay safe until the situation improves. Unfortunately, we currently don't have any program or capacity to provide individuals and families with transportation or resources for leaving the country.\n\nSince the escalation of the crisis, we have helped facilitate the safe passage of civilians from Sumy and Mariupol to other locations in Ukraine. On all occasions, people willingly took buses leading them to another Ukrainian location.\n\nWe are in constant dialogue with the parties to the armed conflict to facilitate more safe passages for civilians that are voluntary, safe, and based on well-informed consent.\n\nTo know when future evacuations might happen, we suggest you keep listening to announcements from your city administration in this regard.\n\nIf you are leaving Ukraine, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) has the following hotline numbers: 527 (free from mobile phones) and 0 800 505 501 (free from mobile and fixed phones).

Make sure each child carries this information with them on a piece of paper.\n\nI need mental health support\n\nWe are very sorry to know that you are experiencing distress and that it's been difficult to cope with the crisis. For the moment, given the security situation, we are unable to provide mental health support directly.\n\nOur partners of the Ukrainian Red Cross are doing their best to provide psychosocial support. Their hotline is 0 800 333 161. They are currently receiving a large number of calls. Thank you for your patience.\n\nIn Russia, the Russian Red Cross has the hotline 8 800 234 07 07.\n\nWe can encourage you to follow these prevention recommendations while you get the direct support your need:\n\n• Acknowledge your feelings: Accept the level of distress or uncertainty you and those around you may feel at the moment.\n\n• Be mindful of your news consumption: Being overexposed to news may be repetitively triggering you.\n\n• Find hope in what you can do: There's a lot that you cannot control, but positive action can be an outlet to your feelings. Whether by helping or being kind to others, every act of kindness is significant.\n\n• Reach out for help: Be kind enough to yourself to reach out for professional help if your feelings of worry start to impact your daily life, especially if you felt vulnerable before the crisis.\n\nWhat can I do if there is fighting?\n\n• If there is fighting and shelling, crawl to safety. Stay in a basement or lower ground. Stay as far as possible from windows.\n\n• Lie down, wrap your arms around your head, and cover your ears.\n\n• Open your mouth to avoid internal injuries, it can reduce the impact of the explosive wave on your body.

Things that may look harmless could potentially be explosive.\n\n• Call 101 to report an explosive hazard.\n\nHow can I get medical aid?\n\nThe emergency line in Ukraine is 112.\n\nIf someone is injured, here is what you can do to assist with first aid while more help arrives:\n\n• Using a clean piece of cloth: Ask the injured person, or proceed yourself, to press directly with the cloth on the wound.\n\n• Swap out physical pressure with a compressive bandage and wrap it around the wound.\n\n• If you notice any of the following signs, loosen the bandage immediately: Any swelling or cyanosis (skin going blue) around the wound. You must loosen the band.\n\n• If blood continues to leak through the bandage: Roll an additional bandage or clean cloth over the first bandage you applied.\n\nWhere can I find shelter?\n\nIf you are trying to find shelter in Ukraine, State authorities can provide you with information on availability and updates.
