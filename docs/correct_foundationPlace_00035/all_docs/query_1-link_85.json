        "text": "Donbas, a region shrouded in controversy, has been at the center of international attention for years. We’re here to unravel the intricate story of this area with the insights of team members who have deep connections to Donbas.\n\nThe Name “Donbas”\n\nDonbas, a name often associated with conflict, has its roots in the term “Donets Coal Basin.” This title originates from the region along the Donets River, which was historically rich in coal reserves. The Donbas region spans parts of Luhansk, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, and Kharkiv in Ukraine and part of the Rostov region in Russia.\n\nA Tapestry of History\n\nDonbas has a rich historical tapestry that includes the presence of various nomadic tribes, such as the Scythians, Alans, and Huns. Its strategic location near the Azov Sea and several rivers, including the Siverskyi Donets, Don, and Kalmius, made it a significant trade hub. The late 17th century saw the establishment of the first permanent settlements in the region, marked by the founding of Soledar, a city near Bakhmut, built for rock-salt exploitation.\n\nThroughout history, control over Donbas transitioned between the Ukrainian Cossack Hetmanate, the Turkic Crimean Khanate, and the Russian Empire.\n\nIndustrial Transformation\n\nThe 19th century witnessed a significant industrial transformation in Donbas, attracting foreign investments. The region’s unofficial capital, Donetsk, was founded by Welsh businessman John Hughes. This rapid industrialization created a demand for a substantial workforce, leading to an influx of landless peasants, primarily of Russian origin, seeking employment.\n\nDespite this migration, Ukrainians remained the majority in the region. The 1897 census of the Russian Empire in Katerynoslav province, encompassing most of Donbas, reported a Ukrainian population share of 69%.\n\nThe Soviet Era and Russification\n\nIn 1918, the Soviet regime came to power and aimed to alter the demographic composition of Donbas. To suppress Ukrainian resistance, they inflicted the Holodomor, a man-made famine that led to significant Ukrainian casualties in Donbas.\n\nTo compensate for this loss, the Soviet regime encouraged Russian migration to the region. They offered jobs and incentives to Russian settlers.\n\nThe Assimilation Agenda\n\nAs Ukrainians maintained their majority in Donbas, the Soviet authorities initiated a policy of russification. This policy sought to assimilate non-Russian populations, pressuring them to adopt Russian culture and language. The policy involved conducting teaching in Russian, requiring Russian for employment, and promoting Russian culture while suppressing Ukrainian culture.\n\nThis oppression led to a decline in the number of Ukrainian speakers in Donbas, mainly due to the intensity of the russification policy in the region.\n\nUkrainian Dissent\n\nResilient Ukrainian dissidents, known as the “60s generation,” opposed these oppressive policies. Many of these dissidents hailed from Donbas, including renowned figures like poet Vasyl Stus and literary critic Ivan Dzyuba. Their courageous stance led to sentences and persecution, with Vasyl Stus tragically dying in prison.\n\nThe Choice of Independence\n\nIn 1991, Ukraine held a pivotal independence referendum following the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Donbas voted overwhelmingly in favor of Ukrainian independence, with 83.9% support in the Donetsk region and 83.8% in the Luhansk region.\n\nRussian Influence and Conflict\n\nPost-Soviet, Russia invested resources in fostering pro-Russian sentiments in Donbas. Local pro-Russian elites threatened regional separation whenever Ukraine pursued NATO or EU membership. This tactic peaked during the “Russian Spring,” culminating in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and a full-scale war in 2022.\n\nAmidst Conflict: Pro-Ukrainian Resilience\n\nDespite the turmoil, many Donbas residents remain staunch supporters of Ukraine. Those who fled the occupied territories still carry pro-Ukrainian sentiments. They endure challenging circumstances, awaiting liberation and returning to peace in their beloved Donbas.\n\nSupporting Ukraine: The Role of Dzyga’s Paw\n\nAs we explore the multifaceted history of Donbas, we also want to emphasize the role of organizations like Dzyga’s Paw. Dzyga’s Paw is dedicated to providing essential support to the Ukrainian military.
