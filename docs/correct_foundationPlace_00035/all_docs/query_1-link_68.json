In addition, we have set up employee support services to ensure the safety and relocation of our employees and their families based in Ukraine.\n\nJuniper has suspended all sales, product deliveries and support services for customers in Russia and Belarus until further notice. Juniper will continue supporting our customers and partners in Ukraine, other than the regions of Donetsk, Luhansk and Crimea.\n\nJuniper stands with our employees in Ukraine and Russia alike, and along with so many of our peers, is calling for the restoration of peace and safety."
