        "text": "Promised to suspend investments, marketing and launch of new products. The company not excluded the possibility of a suspension of its manufacturing operations in Russia. But is still operating in Russia with increasing revenue volumes in 2022 vs 2021 (+$1.5bn or +26%). NACP included Japan Tobacco International in the list of international sponsors of the war. The Director of Corporate Affairs and Communications at Japan Tobacco International (JTI), Sergei Glushkov, informed journalists that the company has decided to maintain its business operations in Russia. According to him, JTI does not want to 'deprive consumers of the products they are accustomed to,' despite 'events of two years ago.\n\nChery is ready to organize the release of its cars in Russia. The Chinese car concern can start assembly at another Sollers plant or buy out the assembly facilities. There are already eight brands from China in the top ten best-selling new cars in Russia at the end of 2023. Or even nine - depending on how you consider Moskvich: it is produced in Moscow and is considered Russian, but copies of Chinese JAC JS crossovers come off the assembly line under this name. Each of the top three Chinese brands in sales - Haval, Geely and Chery - sells more than 10,000 cars per month. Significantly increased revenue in 2023 vs 2022 (more than 3x! times). The ex-Mercedes plant in Yesipovo near Moscow, which was transferred to Avtodom, will assemble premium cars from the Chery concern under a contract assembly agreement.\n\nOn March 11, 2022 Leroy Merlin announced that it does not plan to reduce its operations in Russia, where it operates 143 stores. On March 17, 2022 they disconnected the Ukrainian office from corporate communications and announced that they would increase deliveries to the Russian Federation. Stopped new investments, imports, and financing in Russia. But the latest video investigation confirms that a French company is supporting Russia's war effort in Ukraine. On March 24, 2023 ADEO announces its intention to transfer control of Leroy Merlin Russia to the local management. The company Scenari Holding, registered in the United Arab Emirates, became the main owner of \"Leroy Merlin Vostok\", the Russian structure of the chain of stores, according to the data of the EGRUL. 12.2023: The record about the founder of JSC \"BRICOLAGE INVESTISSMAN FRANCE\" has been deleted from EGRUL. SCENARI HOLDING LP (UAE) becomes the new founder of the organization. 19.12.2023: The status of a legal entity is changed to \"The legal entity is in the process of reorganization in the form of joining it with other legal entities.\" In the course of a detailed investigation, it turned out that the company signed a technical agreement on the alleged sale of the main business in Russia (SCENARI HOLDING LP from the UAE), but the CEO (Defassier Laurent, Louis, Claude) stayed the same since 2019, the company signs new contracts with the group and authorities of the Russian Federation (including the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Internal Affairs), trademarks are extended in Rospatent until 2031. In addition, as the L'Express investigation showed, SCENARI HOLDING LP has the same General Director as in Russia - Laurent Defassier, so the company used a tax optimization scheme, also called layering. Also, most of the imports in 2023 by Leroy Merlin Vostok in Russia was received from ADEO.\n\nThe company announced the suspension of the sale of Pepsi-Cola, 7Up and Mirinda (replacing them with Evervess and Frustyle). The company continued to produce other products in Russia. It also suspends capital investments and all advertising and promotional activities in Russia. In September 2022 PepsiCo Inc has stopped making Pepsi, 7UP and Mountain Dew in Russia nearly six months after the U.S. company said it would suspend sales and production after Moscow sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine. For 11 months, from the beginnig of the war, the company has not taken any visible steps to exit and continues to sell chips and dairy products in Russia. Still operating in Russia with increasing revenue volumes in 2022 vs 2021 (+$223mn or +5%). Profit volumes also significantly increased in 2022 vs 2021. The National Agency on Corruption Prevention (NACP) has included two leading food corporations, PepsiCo and Mars, on the list of international sponsors of the war. SAS is taking swift action and have already announced a boycott of Pepsi products due to their continued business in russia and financially fueling Russia's war. In 2024, the American company PepsiCo started the operation of the first phase of the factory of snacks and salty snacks in Russia, near Novosibirsk. Despite the war, the company has been operating in Russia for over 60 years, and opened a new plant with a production capacity of 60,000 tons per year.\n\nHaval Motor remained on the Russian market. There are already eight brands from China in the top ten best-selling new cars in Russia at the end of 2023. Or even nine - depending on how you consider Moskvich: it is produced in Moscow and is considered Russian, but copies of Chinese JAC JS crossovers come off the assembly line under this name. Each of the top three Chinese brands in sales - Haval, Geely and Chery - sells more than 10,000 cars per month. Significantly (more than 3x! times) increased revenue in 2023 vs 2022.\n\nStill operating in Russia due to \"unimaginable leaving from a human point of view\" working for the benefit of the civilian population. The latest video investigation confirms that a French company is supporting Russia's war effort in Ukraine. The National Agency for Prevention of Corruption included the French corporation \"Auchan\" in the list of international war sponsors. \"Auchan Retail Russia continues to work on the Russian market and does not plan to change either its strategy or its work organization. Auchan in Russia works autonomously, without investments from the parent company. There are no plans to open new stores. At the same time, all existing stores continue their work and there are no plans to close them,\" the retailer noted. Ceetrus, owned by the Auchan group, may sell its assets in Russia. The Ceetrus group, which owns and operates almost 300 shopping centers in Europe, is considering the possibility of selling its assets in Russia. Retailer Auchan refutes rumors about leaving the Russian market, the company continues its work in Russia and plans development in the country, the retailer said in a statement. Auchan made the corresponding statement against the backdrop of recent news about transactions in the real estate market. Earlier it became known that the French company Ceetrus, part of the Auchan Holding group, closed a deal to sell Russian assets. According to the Unified State Register of Legal Entities, from April 12, 2024, the Trade Galleries company became the new owner. “The change of founders, as well as any other structural or organizational changes occurring in third-party companies, do not in any way affect the activities of Auchan in Russia,” the release adds. The retailer also reminds that since 2023, Auchan Retail Russia has been operating in the Russian market independently from the parent company.\n\nThe unprecedented situation leads RBI to consider its position in Russia. We are therefore assessing all strategic options for the future of Raiffeisenbank Russia, up to and including a carefully managed exit from Raiffeisenbank in Russia. RBI and its subsidiary banks continue to operate in compliance with local and international sanction laws. The Russian subsidiary of JSC Raiffeisenbank not only officially recognizes the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk \"people's republics\", but also provides favorable credit terms to the Russian occupiers in Ukraine. Raiffeisen Bank's Russian branch halts opening of new corporate accounts. The National Agency on Corruption Prevention included the Austrian banking group Raiffeisen Bank International in the list of international sponsors of the war for the continuation of the bank's work in Russia and the official recognition of the so-called \"DPR\" and \"LPR\". As reported, Raiffeisen paid 4.8 times more to the Russian budget in 2022 than for the entire pre-war year - 559 million euros (~$615million). It should be noted that this is equal to the cost of about 95 Kalibr missiles, with which the terrorist state regularly fires at peaceful Ukrainian cities. In addition, the bank plays along with Russian propaganda, calling the war a \"special military operation\". Raiffeisen Bank boosts pay for Russian staff by €200mn. Austria's RBI says Russian spin-off unlikely in 2023.
