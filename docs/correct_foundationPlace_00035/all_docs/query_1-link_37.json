Specialized activities typically pertain to the installation and routine configuration of ICT system components and user orientation. Procedural activities include all other processes that may not require the application of specialized information technology training and knowledge, such as maintaining technical and user documentation and/or serving as focal point for receipt and processing of user requests.\n\nUNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.\n\nAcross 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.\n\nAnd we never give up.\n\nFor every child, hope\n\n[Include information about the country/specific programme.

UNICEF strongly encourages the use of flexible working arrangements.\n\nUNICEF has a zero-tolerance policy on conduct that is incompatible with the aims and objectives of the United Nations and UNICEF, including sexual exploitation and abuse, sexual harassment, abuse of authority and discrimination. UNICEF also adheres to strict child safeguarding principles. All selected candidates will be expected to adhere to these standards and principles and will therefore undergo rigorous reference and background checks. Background checks will include the verification of academic credential(s) and employment history. Selected candidates may be required to provide additional information to conduct a background check.\n\nRemarks:"
