        "text": "Russia’s Defense Ministry said its forces captured a village in the Donetsk region near the town of Toretsk as Ukraine reportedly struck the occupied peninsula of Crimea and inside Russia.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nRussia announced on June 29 the capture of Shumy, a settlement located about 7 kilometers southeast of the mining town of Toretsk. The open-source intelligence group DeepState UA had already confirmed Russia’s capture of Shumy on June 21.\n\nMoscow intensified its attack in the direction of Toretsk on the night of June 18 after having been inactive on this section of the front for most of the year, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based think tank, said in its June 27 update on the war.\n\nToretsk is part of a Ukrainian salient that gives Ukrainian forces the possibility of striking in the rear of Russian forces attacking in the direction of Chasiv Yar and northeast of Avdiyivka, ISW said in the report.\n\n“Russian offensive operations near Toretsk likely aim to reduce the threat posed by this Ukrainian salient while Russian forces continue to pursue gains in the Avdiyivka and Chasiv Yar directions,” the ISW said.\n\nRussia has yet to commit significant forces in the direction of Toretsk, limiting its chances of making major gains in the area. Moscow may also be seeking simply to tie up Ukrainian forces in the Toretsk direction, preventing it from reinforcing other parts of the Donetsk front, the ISW said.\n\nDeadly Air Strikes\n\nAlso on June 29, Russia struck the town of Vilnyansk in Zaporizhzhya region, killing seven civilians, including two children, and injuring 18, Ukrainian authorities said. Five more civilians were killed in other attacks along the front the same day.\n\nA day earlier, a Russian strike on the city of Dnipro killed at least one person died and wounded 12, including a 7-month-old girl.\n\nRussia has stepped up airstrikes this year in a bid to drain Ukraine’s resources, often targeting energy facilities and other vital infrastructure, and crush morale.\n\nUkrainian officials have said that half ot the nation's power system has been damaged by Russian strikes, leading to shortages that are constraining the economy and testing citizens' reslience.\n\n\"Our cities and communities suffer from such Russian strikes every day,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a June 29 post on X that included photos of the strike on Vilnyansk.\n\nZelenskiy said Ukraine must strike Russian missile launchers with long-range weapons and strengthen its air defenses. The United States on June 28 said it will provide Ukraine with $150 million worth of weapons and ammunition, including HAWK air defense interceptors.\n\nKursk Governor Aleksei Smirnov said a Ukrainian drone hit a house in a Russian border village, killing five people, including two children. The June 29 incident occurred in Gorodishche, located just meters from the border with Ukraine. Smirnov said the incident appeared to come from a \"copter\"-style drone, fitted to carry explosives that are then dropped over targets.\n\nUkraine's domestic drone industry has made major advancements over the past two years, turning out an ever larger number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) that can fly further and carry greater payloads, putting a significant portion of Russian military targets within striking distance.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters, AFP, and Kommersant\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Ukraine respects U.S. President Joe Biden's \"difficult but strong decision\" to withdraw his candidacy for reelection.\n\nBiden, who is 81, on July 21 dropped his bid for reelection in November and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party's nominee amid an erosion of support over concerns about his fitness to run because of his age.\n\n\"Ukraine is grateful to President Biden for his unwavering support for Ukraine's fight for freedom, which, along with strong bipartisan support in the United States, has been and continues to be critical,\" Zelenskiy wrote on X on July 22.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nUnder Biden's leadership, the United States has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine in its war against Russia's unprovoked invasion and its main provider of military and financial aid.\n\nIn what is likely to be one of his enduring legacies as president, Biden was able to quickly unite allies to support Ukraine with tens of billions of dollars in military and financial support after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\n\"Many strong decisions have been made in recent years and they will be remembered as bold steps taken by President Biden in response to challenging times. And we respect today's tough but strong decision,\" Zelenskiy wrote.\n\n\"We will always be thankful for President Biden's leadership. He supported our country during the most dramatic moment in history, assisted us in preventing Putin from occupying our country, and has continued to support us throughout this terrible war.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, who is vying for reelection as the Republican Party's candidate, has repeatedly said that if he was elected president again, he would end the war Russia launched against Ukraine.\n\nTrump repeated the pledge on July 19 in a phone call with Zelenskiy that both men described as good.\n\nHarris has strengthened her international profile during her three years in office and represented the United States at Ukraine's peace summit in Switzerland last month.\n\nIn his statement, Zelenskiy voiced hope that Washington would remain at the helm of the Western allies' support for Ukraine's response to Russia's aggression and would not abandon Ukraine.\n\n\"The current situation in Ukraine and all of Europe is no less challenging, and we sincerely hope that America's continued strong leadership will prevent Russian evil from succeeding or making its aggression pay off,\" Zelenskiy said.\n\nWASHINGTON -- With just over 100 days left before U.S. voters cast their ballots in a presidential election, U.S. President Joe Biden dropped his bid for reelection and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party's nominee amid an erosion of support over concerns about his fitness to run because of his age.\n\nBiden had been under pressure for weeks since a horrendous performance at a debate with his rival, Republican candidate Donald Trump.\n\nThe 81-year-old appeared frail and confused at times during the June 27 debate, raising questions about his physical and mental state.\n\nThe president did not give a reason for withdrawing his candidacy, but he immediately endorsed Harris, to be the party’s candidate, which she vowed to \"earn and win\" as the August 19-21 Democratic National Convention approaches.\n\n\"I have decided not to accept the nomination and to focus all my energies on my duties as president for the remainder of my term,\" Biden, who is recovering at home in Delaware from COVID-19, said, adding he was acting in the \"best interest of my party and the country.\"\n\nMany Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton, immediately backed Harris to become the Democratic Party's candidate, though it remained unclear whether she would face a challenge to top the election ticket.\n\nThe chair of the Democratic National Committee, Jaime Harrison, said the party would comment soon on the path forward for the nomination process after Biden became the first incumbent U.S. president to give up his party's nomination in more than five decades.\n\n\"The bottom line is that it's going to be very hard to dislodge her [Harris] from the top spot for all kinds of reasons,\" Matthew Dallek, historian and political science professor at George Washington University, told RFE/RL.\n\n\"She got Biden's endorsement. She can have access to the campaign infrastructure and the campaign dollars. She's been vice president for four years. There's not a whole lot of time. It would be very hard for the Democratic Party, I think, to replace the first African American woman vice president at the top of the ticket with a white man.\"\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:03:27 0:00\n\nAdding to the situation's urgency, Democrats say too much is at stake -- including democracy itself -- to lose the election.\n\nThroughout his nearly decade-long political career, Trump has praised authoritarian leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin, Turkish President Tayyip Recep Erdogan, and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.\n\nDuring his term in office from 2017-2021, Trump undermined NATO unity, tilted the Supreme Court to the right of the political spectrum, and sought to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nBiden beat Trump in 2020, narrowly edging him out in the key swing states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan.\n\nHowever, polls showed Trump, 78, expanding his lead over Biden, including in some of those key states, especially after the Republican nominee survived an assassination attempt during a campaign rally on July 13 in Pennsylvania.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:01:43 0:00\n\n\"Biden was really fighting two wars at the same time, one against Donald Trump and the Republican Party, and then one against his own party, the Democrats. I think that that was just too much to keep an election campaign going heading into a general election,\" Thomas Gift, associate professor of political science at University College London, told RFE/RL.\n\nRepublican leaders immediately attacked Harris over the Biden administration's policies, with some saying that if Biden was not fit enough to run for president, he should step down from the position, a move analysts said was unlikely to happen.\n\n\"There's been a lot of evidence, I think, that Biden is really diminished as a campaigner. But in terms of his ability to govern and to make decisions, and to make informed decisions, I don't think we've seen that,\" Dallek said.\n\nIf chosen as the Democratic candidate, Harris, a 59-year-old former prosecutor and California senator, would become the first black woman to run at the top of the election ticket for a major party in the country's history.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:04:44 0:00\n\nHarris oversaw several key issues in the administration, including immigration, voting rights, and reproductive rights. She also strengthened her international profile during her three years in office, making more than a dozen trips abroad and meeting about 150 leaders.\n\nHarris also represented the United States at Ukraine's peace summit in Switzerland last month.\n\nOther names commonly floated as potential contenders for the Democratic nomination have included governors Gavin Newsom of California, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, and J.B. Pritzker of Illinois.\n\nHarris shares a similar disapproval rating as Biden. However, experts say she is still not well-known to many Americans and can improve her image as she campaigns around the country.\n\nBiden's backing of Harris gives her a clear path to the nomination, likely avoiding an intraparty brawl, Gift says.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:04:36 0:00\n\n\"These last few weeks have been bad enough for Democrats. The last thing they needed was a really bruising convention. So I think that it made sense for Biden to go ahead and endorse Harris,\" he said.\n\nDemocrats also risk alienating black voters, a key part of their base, if they pass up on Harris, analysts say.\n\n\"He has done one of the most difficult things for any political leader, and has done so in the national interest,\" presidential historian Michael Beschloss said in a post on X.\n\nBiden's announcement means his political career of more than half a century will finally come to an end in January 2025 when his successor is inaugurated.\n\nIn 1972, at the age of 29, Biden won the Delaware Senate race. He held that seat for the next 36 years, serving as chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He ran for the Democratic nomination in 1988 and 2008, losing both times.\n\nObama, considered a novice in foreign affairs, tapped Biden to be his running mate in 2008. Biden served as vice president for the next eight years, overseeing White House policy on Ukraine and making several trips to Kyiv.\n\nLike most vice presidents, Biden wanted to run for the nation's top office in 2016 but was encouraged to make way for former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, something he is reportedly still bitter about. She was beaten by Trump in one of the biggest upsets in presidential history.\n\nIn his third bid for the presidency in 2020, Biden beat incumbent Trump in a close race, becoming the oldest person to hold the top office. He immediately sought to rebuild relations with European allies damaged under his predecessor.\n\nWith Biden bowing out before officially becoming his party's nominee, Trump, 78, is now officially the oldest presidential nominee in U.S. history.\n\nIn what is likely to be one of his enduring legacies as president, he was able to quickly unite those allies to support Ukraine with tens of billions of dollars in military and financial aid when Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nBelarus and Germany are holding \"consultations\" over the fate of a German man reportedly sentenced to death by a court in Minsk last month, the Belarusian Foreign Ministry said on July 20.\n\n\"There were, of course, contacts with the German side on this topic. This criminal is a German citizen, and we understand the German side's concern for him,” said Anatoly Glaz, spokesman for the Belarusian Foreign Ministry.\n\nThe Belarusian side has proposed “concrete solutions on the available options,” Glaz said, adding that consultations were being conducted by the foreign ministries of the two countries.\n\nBelarus has provided consular access to the individual “in full compliance with international norms and bilateral agreements,” the spokesman said.\n\nThe German Foreign Ministry confirmed on July 19 that a German national has been sentenced to death in Belarus and said Berlin was in intensive contact with authorities in Minsk over his fate.\n\nThe German ministry did not identify the man, but earlier on July 19 the Minsk-based Vyasna human rights group said the man sentenced to death was Rico Krieger. Vyasna said Krieger, 30, was taken into custody in November 2023, went on trial on June 6, and was sentenced on June 24 by the Minsk regional court.\n\nThe human rights group said it was the first trial in Belarus for \"mercenary activity.\"\n\nIt said Krieger had been charged additionally with terrorism, creating an extremist group, intentionally damaging a vehicle, and illegal operations with firearms and explosives.\n\nVyasna said the charges were connected to the Kalinouski Regiment, a group of anti-government Belarusian exiles fighting for Ukraine. The Kalinouski Regiment denies any connection to the case.\n\nThe German Foreign Ministry said on July 19 that it and the German Embassy in Minsk were giving \"the person in question consular support and...working intensively with Belarusian authorities on his behalf.\n\nHuman rights activist Leanid Sudalenka told RFE/RL that he believed the death penalty sentence was not accidental and that Belarusian authorities are counting on using the case to bargain with Germany, noting the lack of a death penalty there.\n\nThe German Foreign Ministry statement said Berlin considered the death penalty \"a cruel and inhuman form of punishment\" and that Germany rejected it in all circumstances.\n\nBelarus is the only European country that continues to use the death penalty.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters\n\nResidents of the Russian city of Krasnodar on July 20 staged a rare public protest to vent their anger over recent power cuts affecting southern Russia.\n\nAn estimated 200 to 300 people turned out for the protest to demand that the authorities resume the supply of electricity and water. They blocked a street in the north of the city as they voiced complaints about the cuts to services, which they said are becoming more frequent, Russian online media reported.\n\nThe protesters said that this summer their lights initially were turned off once a week, then three times a week, and now there is no electricity for 12-15 hours a day, the Baza Telegram channel reported.\n\nPeople demand that they be given electricity for at least three hours, the online publication 93.RU reported.\n\nPublic protests are rare in Russia given the risk of arrest and detention and in light of a clampdown on dissent since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nThe protest in Krasnodar appeared to have been peaceful, though there were reports of two arrests.\n\nKrasnodar Mayor Yevgeny Naumov, police officers, and members of the National Guard were at the scene, according to Russian media reports. The authorities promised to ensure the supply of water.\n\nAuthorities in the Krasnodar region earlier this week said the electricity blackouts were necessary due to restrictions on the supply of electricity from other regions and a heat wave in southern Russia.\n\nExtreme temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius and a decrease in the flow of power to the region have meant “the equipment of the unified power system is under significant loads, especially in the daytime,” Krasnodar’s Ministry for Energy and Public Utilities said in a statement quoted by Interfax on July 17.\n\n\"There has been abnormal heat in the Krasnodar region for a week now. The load on the energy system is colossal. I know and understand all the indignation of residents due to power outages,\" regional Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said on Telegram.\n\nThe system operator said on July 16 that the energy system of the south of Russia set a power consumption record.\n\nThe following day, Russia's nuclear energy operator, Rosenergoatom, said a unit of the Rostov Nuclear Power Plant was switched off. The shutdown left some 1 million people in southern Russia and parts of occupied Crimea without electricity.\n\nRosenergoatom later said the shutdown was due to a \"false alarm” but did not elaborate on the cause. The unit has been put back into operation.\n\nThe Rostov Nuclear Power Plant, also known as the Volgodonsk Nuclear Power Plant, has four units with a total capacity of more than 4,000 megawatts. The plant is located on the left bank of the Don River near the city of Volgodonsk, some 1,100 kilometers south of Moscow.\n\nIn recent months, Ukraine, whose energy infrastructure has been relentlessly pummeled by Russian strikes since the start of Moscow's unprovoked invasion, has in turn resorted to targeting Russian energy facilities, mainly oil refineries and those that work for the Russian military.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters and Interfax\n\nThousands of demonstrators in northwest Pakistan are participating in a sit-in protest after authorities fired on participants of a “peace march” in the Bannu district of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province on July 19.\n\nLeaders of the rally told RFE/RL’s Radio Mashaal that the Pakistani military fired on participants of the peace march, held as the region has experienced a spike in militant attacks.\n\nDoctors at the Bannu district hospital said that they had received one dead body and 27 injured people following the march.\n\nThe military has so far not commented on allegations that it was responsible for the violence.\n\nThe Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government, which has shut down mobile and Internet services in the Bannu district amid the unrest, on July 20 announced the formation of an investigative commission to look into the incident.\n\nNasir Bangash, a leader of the sit-in protest, told RFE/RL that the sit-in will continue until the government provides assurances that peace in the restive province can be restored.\n\nAmnesty International sharply criticized the authorities’ use of violence to break up the march, saying that the “use of lethal force at a peaceful rally advocating for peace is unlawful” and calling for a prompt investigation to “hold to account officials responsible for the attack.”\n\nThe rights watchdog further said that restrictions on mobile and Internet services in Bannu “curtail the people’s ability to mobilize” and also “increase the spread of misinformation during emergencies and create panic.”\n\nThe Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has also urged the government to “hold to account those responsible for protesters' deaths and injuries.”\n\n“This seemingly state-sanctioned violation of citizens' right to life and right to freedom of peaceful assembly is reprehensible and reflects a dangerous contempt for citizen-led calls for peace,” HRCP said in a statement on X on July 19.\n\nThe provincial assembly of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa denounced the violence against “peaceful protesters” in a session held late on July 19, as demonstrations spread to other cities in the province, including the regional capital, Peshawar.\n\nLeaders of Pashtun nationalist political parties have also condemned the violence used against protesters in the Bannu district.\n\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa Province has seen an increase in deadly attacks in the past two years, mostly blamed on Islamist extremist groups, including the Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan and affiliates of the extremist group Islamic State.\n\nA number of deadly incidents have taken place in recent months, leading to reports that the military is considering an operation to turn the tide of rising terrorism.\n\nWhile residents of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province have complained that Islamabad is not doing enough to provide security, they have also expressed fears of a large-scale operation.\n\nPakistani security forces have recently said they have conducted targeted operations against militants in several parts of the province.\n\nOn July 15, eight Pakistani soldiers were killed when a militant rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the outer wall of a garrison in Bannu.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he spoke with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and agreed to a face-to-face meeting to discuss steps to a lasting peace with Russia.\n\nZelenskiy spoke with Trump on July 19, a day after the former U.S. president and again Republican candidate accepted his party’s nomination and vowed to end the war in Ukraine if elected.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\n“I spoke with @realDonaldTrump to congratulate him on the Republican nomination and condemn the shocking assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. I wished him strength and absolute safety in the future,” Zelenskiy said in a post on X, referring to the July 13 shooting at a Trump rally that slightly injured the candidate.\n\nZelenskiy said he agreed with Trump “to discuss at a personal meeting what steps can make peace fair and truly lasting” without giving any details on when and where such a meeting would take place.\n\nTrump said in a post on Truth Social on July 19 that he had a “very good call” with Zelenskiy in which they discussed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nTrump vowed to “bring peace to the world and end the war that has cost so many lives” through negotiations.\n\n\"Both sides will be able to come together and negotiate a deal that ends the violence and paves a path forward to prosperity,\" Trump said.\n\nRussia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which has killed tens of thousands on both sides, is now in its 29th month with no end in sight. Russia currently occupies about 17 percent of Ukraine.\n\nZelenskiy’s call took place as worries grow in Kyiv and other European capitals about another four years of Trump in the White House. The Republican’s chances of winning the November 2024 election improved following 81-year-old incumbent President Joe Biden’s poor performance in a debate last month that raised questions about his physical and mental state.\n\nLawrence Freedman, emeritus professor of war studies at King's College London, said there is interest in how Trump would sort out the war now that it appears \"as likely as not\" that he will win the election.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:00:34 0:00\n\nIn a post on the social media platform Substack, Freedman cited reports about a rudimentary plan drawn up by two members of the White House National Security Council during Trump's 2017-21 presidency that calls for a cease-fire based on prevailing battle lines.\n\nKeith Kellogg, who drew up the plan with Fred Fleitz, has said it would be crucial to get Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table quickly if Trump wins. According to a Reuters report in June, Kellogg has advocated telling the Ukrainians that if they don't come to the negotiating table, U.S. support would dry up, while telling Putin that if he didn't come to the table, the United States would give the Ukrainians \"everything they need to kill you in the field.\"\n\nNATO membership for Ukraine would be off the table as part of the incentive for Russia to come along; putting it back on would be punishment for holding back.\n\nBut Freedman, a distinguished military analyst, is skeptical of the plan, which would mark a major shift in the U.S. position on the war.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:02:44 0:00\n\n\"These coercive measures might possibly get the parties to the table, but it does not point to any actual agreed deal,\" Freedman said on Substack on July 20.\n\nThe Kremlin has said any peace plan proposed by a possible future Trump administration would have to reflect the reality on the ground but that Putin remained open to talks. Ukraine has rejected holding talks with the current battle lines as a starting point.\n\nTrump-Putin Relationship\n\nTrump has expressed admiration for authoritarian Russian President Vladimir Putin, called the Kremlin leader’s preinvasion tactics “genius,” and has repeatedly criticized NATO’s European allies for not spending more on collective defense.\n\nRepublican lawmakers in the House of Representative who are closely aligned with Trump blocked Biden's $61 billion aid package for Ukraine for months, leaving Ukraine’s force short on ammunition and air defense. Ukraine’s ammunition hunger contributed to Russian territorial gains this year, experts have said.\n\nTrump has not made his opinion on future support to Ukraine clear, though this week he picked Senator J.D. Vance (Republican-Ohio), an outspoken opponent of aid to Kyiv, as his running mate. The 39-year-old senator has said the United States does not have the military capacity to support Taiwan, Israel, and Ukraine and should prioritize the first two.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Ukraine maintains bipartisan support in Congress and any future U.S. president will have to take that into account.\n\n\"Any administration has to ask hard questions. If we stop, if we reverse ourselves, if we let Ukraine down, what will Putin do? He will then really resume the aggression and possibly have a chance of succeeding where for now he’s failed,\" Blinken said on July 19 at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado.\n\nBlinken said Putin would be \"likely to go at other countries in the region, including NATO allies.\" He also said other would-be aggressors are \"taking lessons from this too.\"\n\nDuring his 92-minute-long acceptance speech on July 18, Trump said he would usher in global peace and stability if elected. He previously said he would “settle” the Ukraine war, should he win the election, before even setting foot in the White House in January 2025.\n\nHowever, Trump has not said what terms he would propose to Russia and Ukraine. Zelenskiy has said his goal is to drive Russian forces out of Ukrainian territory, including Crimea, which the Kremlin seized in 2014. Following Ukraine’s failed counteroffensive in 2023, some experts say Ukraine’s objectives are unrealistic and that Kyiv will have to make concessions.\n\nBlinken noted that last week on the margins of the NATO summit in Washington more than 20 countries announced that they had negotiated and signed 10-year bilateral security agreements with Ukraine. All of these countries, including the United States, have committed to help Ukraine build up its defenses for the next decade, Blinken said.\n\nIf the United States were to renege on that, there are more than 20 other countries that would continue their support, he said.\n\nZelenskiy and Trump have a complicated relationship going back to the Ukrainian president’s first days in office.\n\nIn a July 2019 call, two months after the former comedian became Ukraine’s president, Trump asked Zelenskiy to look into the Ukrainian business dealings of Biden’s son Hunter Biden.\n\nTrump was charged by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives with using the power of his office to pressure Zelenskiy to interfere in U.S. politics in exchange for a White House visit, becoming the third president in U.S. history to be impeached. However, he was acquitted by the Senate.\n\nA gunman on July 19 shot and killed a former member of Ukraine's parliament known for campaigns to promote the Ukrainian language.\n\nIryna Farion, 60, was shot in the head on a street in the western city of Lviv. She died after being transported to a hospital, Lviv regional Governor Maksym Kozytskiy said on Telegram.\n\nNatalya Matolinets, head of the anesthesiology service at the First Medical Association of Lviv, said Farion arrived at the hospital in critical condition \"with a severe penetrating gunshot wound to the brain.\"\n\nShe was immediately operated on and then transferred to the intensive-care unit for continued treatment, but her heart could not take the strain, Matolinets said.\n\n\"Unfortunately, despite all the efforts of the doctors, despite all resuscitation measures, Iryna Farion's life could not be saved,\" Matolinets said.\n\nInterior Minister Ihor Klymenko said that the shooting was being treated as an assassination. Police launched a wide search for the gunman.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he was receiving regular reports on efforts to capture the gunman. He added that any act of violence was to be condemned.\n\nFarion, a linguist, became a member of the nationalist Svoboda (Freedom) party in 2005 and was elected to parliament in 2012 but failed in subsequent attempts to win reelection.\n\nShe gained notoriety for frequent campaigns to promote the Ukrainian language and discredit public officials who spoke Russian.\n\nFarion’s views were seen as radical by some critics, and some of her statements caused controversy.\n\nIn 2018, when Ukraine was fighting Russia-backed separatists who had seized territory in the east, she called for a drive to \"punch every Russian-speaking person in the jaw.\"\n\nIn 2023, she was dismissed as a professor at the Department of Ukrainian Language at the Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Lviv Polytechnic University due to her controversial statements.\n\nAt the end of May, the Lviv Court of Appeal issued a ruling reinstating her to the position.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz on July 19 said a proposed lithium-mining project in Serbia was \"an important European project\" that is also good for Serbia, despite opposition from environmental activists and opposition parties.\n\nScholz attended a Critical Raw Materials Summit in Belgrade, where a memorandum of understanding between the European Union and the Serbian government on a \"strategic partnership\" on sustainable raw materials, battery supply chains, and electric vehicles was signed.\n\nThe mining of lithium is necessary for Europe \"to remain sovereign in a changing world and not be dependent on others,\" Scholz said after the signing ceremony.\n\nGermany is seeking to secure lithium for the manufacture of electric vehicles as the EU aims to reduce its dependence on imports from China of the critical substance used in batteries for electric vehicles.\n\nScholz and European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic attended the summit in Belgrade three days after the Serbian government reinstated a plan for the lithium mine in the west of the country near Jadar operated by the Anglo-Australian metals and mining giant Rio Tinto.\n\n\"I'm glad the decision was made,\" Scholz said, speaking at a joint news conference with Sefcovic and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic. \"I admit, this decision required courage, but it was made at the right moment.\"\n\nScholz pledged that mining would be carried out \"in compliance with the highest standards of environmental protection, and Germany will help in this.\"\n\nAsked how Germany can guarantee environmental protection, Scholz said that he asked the president of Rio Tinto to respect all environmental standards during exploitation and said that he had received guarantees for this.\n\n\"The standards for protecting the climate, the environment, and biodiversity are high. That's why I spoke very early with the head of Rio Tinto,\" Scholz said.\n\nAs the summit took place, environmental activists opposed to lithium mining gathered near the venue in central Belgrade. One banner said the EU should \"leave lithium and democracy to the Serbian people.\"\n\nThe Serbian government rejected the project in 2022 after massive environmental protests, but on July 16 it reinstated the plan days after the Balkan state's Constitutional Court said the government of then-Prime Minister Ana Brnabic had acted unconstitutionally when it withdrew permits for Rio Tinto.\n\nScholz said that among the other reasons to support the project are that it will create new jobs in Serbia and help Europe meet its climate goals.\n\nSefcovic said that it was a historic day for both Serbia and the European Union.\n\n\"This will open the door for investments in Serbia. European companies will come and create jobs and create new economic growth,\" he said.\n\nSerbia will occupy a central place in the most important strategic value chains and will be the first country in Europe with the entire value chain once batteries are produced in Serbia, Sefcovic said.\n\nAccording to him, the first goal is to strengthen the Serbian economy with high-quality jobs throughout the supply chain.\n\nHe also said the memorandum of understanding and another signed agreement will further highlight the partnership between the EU and Serbia, which is a candidate for membership in the EU.\n\nVucic said he was proud of \"what we started today,\" calling the memorandum of understanding important for Europe and Germany, but most important for Serbia. \"This represents a turning point and a big change for us.\"\n\nHe said that lithium mining represented billions of dollars in direct foreign investment and Serbia should not miss this chance.\n\nHe added that Serbia did not hide the difficulties the government is facing in its support for the mining project but insisted that it was doing everything transparently.\n\n\"Never at any stage -- and there is a long way to the opening of the mine -- will we hide anything from our people,\" he added.\n\nWith reporting by AP"
