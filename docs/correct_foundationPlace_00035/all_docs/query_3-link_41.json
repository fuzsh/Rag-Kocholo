We protect displaced people and support them as they build a new future.\n\nNever before have more people been forced to leave their homes and everything they own behind. Support our work to make sure they get the help they need.\n\nWe started our relief efforts after World War Two. Today, we work in both new and protracted crises across 40 countries, where we help save lives and rebuild futures.\n\nNRC works to protect the rights of displaced people during crisis. We specialise in six areas: food security, education, shelter, legal assistance, protection from violence, and water, sanitation and hygiene.\n\nNORCAP works to better protect and empower people affected by crises and climate change. We collaborate with partners on finding solutions to meet the needs of people at risk."
