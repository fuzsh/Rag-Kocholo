        "text": "Most western powers, including the United States, have imposed heavy economic sanctions on Russia for invading Ukraine, hoping that crippling its economy will slow down or end the war. But as the war presses on, Ukrainian citizens face devastating consequences.\n\nMany of us are watching from afar and wondering how we can help Ukrainian people whose homes, cities and lives are being destroyed before our eyes.\n\nIn crises like this, acts of compassion and generosity can make a huge difference. There are dozens of organizations working directly in Ukraine or in bordering nations to provide aid to Ukrainian refugees.\n\nIf you’re looking to support people affected by the war in Ukraine, consider volunteering or donating money directly to the following organizations.\n\nHow to Donate to Organizations in Ukraine\n\nThe Ukrainian Red Cross\n\nThe Red Cross is often on the front lines of war, serving to help those affected by armed conflict. The Ukrainian Red Cross is assisting people inside the country by aiding with collecting blood, mobilizing volunteers and resources and conducting emergency activities.\n\nDonate to the Ukrainian Red Cross here.\n\nWorld Central Kitchen\n\nWorld Central Kitchen (WCK), established in 2010, is an organization that deploys chefs directly to disaster areas to provide hot meals to those in need. Since February, WCK has provided over 100 million hot meals and meal kits to those in need in Ukraine and neighboring countries.\n\nDonate to World Central Kitchen here.\n\nGlobalGiving Ukraine Crisis Relief Fund\n\nGlobalGiving is raising funds to support locally-led organizations throughout Ukraine. Donations to the fund will provide essentials for refugees, plus health and psychological support as well as access to education and economic assistance. To date, the fund has raised more than $54 million.\n\nContributors can also donate directly to GlobalGiving partners for specific projects, including helping Ukrainian children with cancer, providing transport for rescued pets, evacuating orphans and more.\n\nDonate directly to GlobalGiving’s Ukraine Crisis Relief Fund here.\n\nVostok SOS\n\nVostok SOS is a Ukraine-based non-governmental organization (NGO) that assists areas of conflict within Ukraine. The organization accepts donations to help aid local people, evacuate the vulnerable and provide trauma support after shelling.\n\nDonate directly to Vostok SOS via bank transfer.\n\nCredit card payments are also accepted through Libereco, a Vostok SOS partner.\n\nVoices of Children\n\nCreated in 2015, the Voices of Children Foundation has been providing psychological support to children affected by war in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine through art therapy, video storytelling, mobile psychology access and more.\n\nAccording to an August report, the organization has helped hundreds of families since the start of the war, providing financial assistance, psychological support and rehabilitation courses for children with disabilities.\n\nDonate to Voices of Children here.\n\nMedia Support\n\nDonating directly toward the media in Ukraine can help fight Russian misinformation and keep Ukrainians informed of the latest developments. A GoFundMe has been launched by various organizations to help Ukraine’s media outlets relocate and continue their operations from European Union countries.\n\nDonate to the media support GoFundMe here.\n\nKyiv School of Economics\n\nThe Kyiv School of Economics has created an initiative to provide equipment and services to those directly involved in the war through its charitable foundation. This equipment includes supplies for medics, basic necessities and psychological support for civilians, and purchasing and repairing off-road vehicles for the military.\n\nDonate to the Kyiv School of Economics’ initiative here.\n\nHumanity & Inclusion\n\nHumanity & Inclusion (H&I) is an international nongovernmental organization that works to support people with disabilities in areas of conflict, poverty and disaster. H&I workers have arrived in Ukraine to assess how it can help distribute medical equipment, provide post-operative care for the injured and offer mental health support. Donations go toward supplying emergency kits and rehabilitation and mental health support sessions.\n\nDonate to Humanity & Inclusion here.\n\nFuture for Ukraine\n\nAfter hiding in bomb shelters and fleeing Ukraine, a group of displaced Ukrainian women founded Future for Ukraine to support those continuing to suffer from the war. Now, they’re organizing efforts to aid displaced Ukrainian children and women coping with the psychological consequences of the war. Future for Ukraine also helps provide prosthetics for wounded Ukrainians abroad, and humanitarian aid to affected regions within Ukraine.\n\nDonate to Future for Ukraine here.\n\nHow to Support Ukrainian Refugees\n\nAccording to a tracker from the United Nations refugee agency, over 7.6 million Ukrainian refugees have been recorded across Europe. Many have fled to neighboring countries, including Poland, Hungary, Moldova and Romania.\n\nMany refugees are in dire need of basic supplies, food and resources as they’re forced to rebuild their lives. You can volunteer or donate to the following organizations to help them do this.\n\nENGin\n\nENGin is a nonprofit organization that pairs Ukrainians with English-speaking volunteers for free online conversation practice.
