This significant day is a celebration of the courage and vision of the Founding Fathers who envisioned a country where freedom and equality would flourish. ✍🏼 As fireworks light up the sky, and the American flag waves proudly, we honor the enduring spirit of independence and the relentless pursuit of a more perfect union. Congratulations to the United States and its people on this momentous occasion! Happy Independence Day! 🌎 #IndependenceDay #July4th #Freedom #USA #WaverleySoftware\n\n☀ 🏳️🌈 We have entered the summer and June, which means it is Pride Month! It is a time to celebrate and honor the LGBTQ+ community. It’s a month dedicated to promoting equality, acceptance, and love for all, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. 💙 At Waverley, we believe in creating a workplace where everyone feels valued, respected, and free to be themselves. This Pride Month, let's come together to support our LGBTQ+ colleagues and friends, celebrate diversity, and continue our commitment to fostering an inclusive environment. Pride Month is celebrated in June in the United States and elsewhere around the world. The organized pursuit of LGBTQ rights in the United States dates back to at least 1924 and the founding of the Society of Human Rights in Chicago by Henry Gerber. But the event that catalyzed the LGBTQ rights movement came in June 1969 in New York City’s Greenwich Village, at the Stonewall Inn. In the early morning hours of June 28, police raided this popular gathering place for young members of the LGBTQ community—arresting the employees for selling liquor without a license, roughing up many of the patrons, and clearing the bar. Outside, the crowd that watched the bar’s patrons being herded into police vans became enraged. Previously witnesses to police harassment of members of the LGBTQ community had stood by passively, but this time the crowd jeered the police and threw coins and then bottles and debris at them, forcing the police to barricade themselves in the bar to await backup. Before long some 400 people were rioting. Although police reinforcements dispersed the crowd, riots waxed and waned outside the bar for the next five days, and these Stonewall riots (also called the Stonewall uprising) provided the spark that ignited the LGBTQ rights movement in the United States. Happy Pride Month! Let's celebrate love, diversity, and inclusion. 🏳️🌈"
