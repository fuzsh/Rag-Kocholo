        "text": "The Donetsk People's Republic (Russian: Донецкая Народная Республика, romanized:Donetskaya Narodnaya Respublika, IPA: [dɐˈnʲetskəjə nɐˈrodnəjə rʲɪˈspublʲɪkə]; abbreviated as DPR or DNR, Russian: ДНР) is a republic of Russia, comprising the occupied parts of eastern Ukraine's Donetsk Oblast,[8][9] with its capital in Donetsk. The DPR was created by Russian-backed paramilitaries in 2014,[10][11] and it initially operated as a breakaway state until it was annexed in 2022. The entire territory of DPR is viewed as sovereign territory of Ukraine by nearly all UN member states.\n\nQuick Facts Донецкая Народная Республика, Country ...\n\nClose\n\nFollowing Ukraine's Revolution of Dignity in 2014, pro-Russian, counter-revolutionary unrest erupted in the eastern part of the country. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine, while armed separatists seized government buildings and proclaimed the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) as independent states. This sparked the war in Donbas, part of the wider Russo-Ukrainian War. The DPR and LPR are often described as puppet states of Russia during this conflict.[12][13][14] They received no international recognition from any United Nations member state before 2022.\n\nOn 21 February 2022, Russia recognised the DPR and LPR as sovereign states. Three days later, it launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, partially under the pretext of protecting the republics. Russian forces captured more of Donetsk Oblast, which became part of the DPR. In September 2022, Russia proclaimed the annexation of the DPR and other occupied territories, following referendums widely described as fraudulent by commentators. The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution calling on countries not to recognise what it called the \"attempted illegal annexation\" and demanded that Russia \"immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw\".[15][16]"
