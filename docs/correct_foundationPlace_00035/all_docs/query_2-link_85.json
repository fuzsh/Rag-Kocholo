        "text": "Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu asserted reportedly that Russian forces have seized Mariinka, a strategically vital town near Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. The area, described as “powerfully fortified,” was reportedly taken by assault units, according to Shoigu’s statement to President Vladimir Putin.\n\nMariinka, seen as a gateway to Donetsk, has suffered extensive destruction, with conflicting reports emerging.\n\nUkrainian military spokesman Oleksandr Shtupun denied the claim, stating that the fighting for Mariinka was ongoing. The town, crucial for defensive purposes since 2014, had become a key stronghold for Ukrainian forces.\n\nIn a separate incident, the Russian-installed head of Crimea reported an “enemy attack” and a fire in the port of Feodosiya, with unverified footage showing a significant explosion. Simultaneously, the head of the Ukrainian Air Force claimed the destruction of a Russian landing warship in the city.\n\nThese developments come amid an intensified Russian offensive along the more than 1,200km battlefront, targeting key areas like Mariinka and attempting to encircle Avdiivka. President Putin hailed the reported capture as a “success,” pushing Ukrainian troops further away from Donetsk.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently announced plans to mobilize up to 500,000 additional people as the country faces ammunition shortages and aid setbacks from key allies. Kyiv’s counter-offensive has slowed, raising concerns that Russia could outgun Ukraine in the ongoing conflict."
