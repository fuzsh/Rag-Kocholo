        "text": "Original Settlers of Norwalk\n\nEast Norwalk Historical Cemetery, From Find a Grave\n\nBirth: October 1636, Hartford, Hartford County, Connecticut, USA\n\nDeath: January 1707, Norwalk, Fairfield County, Connecticut, USA\n\nThe son of JOHN & ALICE (KELLOGG) BOUTON, he married ABIGAIL MARVIN on January 1, 1656 in Norwalk, Colony of Connecticut.\n\nIn 1671/2, Norwalk Town Records shows that he had an estate of 100Â£ and five children. On January 31, 1678 at a town meeting, he was named as part of a committee of six men to oversee the work on the meeting house in Norwalk. He was a selectman and a reprentative for Norwalk to the General Assembly in Hartford many times between 1671 and 1685. At a meeting in the town of Norwalk on January 16, 1694, \"Serj'nt John Bouton\" was chosen to be one of ten inhabitants as the \"Towne commitee\" which also included Matthew Marvin, John Benedick, Ralph Keeler, and others. Part of their duty was to secure a minister.\n\nFind A Grave Memorial# 37642641\n\nfound on findagrave.com\n\nThe Acient Historical Records of Norwalk Connecticut\n\nI have included this information even though some of it seems to be wrong. According to probated wills (found under stories) John the Second had a son John and a son Richard. Third John had a son Eliazer, his son Ezra was the father of Seth Bouton. According to the info below a Joseph Bouton was the father of a Seth Bouton. Either this is a different Seth, the record is wrong, or my family information is in error. The possibility is that Jakin and Joseph did name their children the same as John and his family, I have seen that often with other families. If anyone has an answer to this I would appreciate it. Also Ezra Bouton's wife is listed as Mary Bouton. Ancestry has listed her family as that of Jachin (Jakin) and Joseph decended from the first and second John. Is this an error or was she a cousin to Ezra?

If you have any questions, corrections or additions, please contact Barbara Kaye.\n\n/ 2 / THE GENEALOGICAL REGISTRY of NORWALK\n\nJohn Bouton was among the first settlers of Norwalk. He was a French Protestant, and it is said there are many of the same name still living in France and Germany, and that a great similarity exists between the families there and here.\n\nHe had five children after his marriage as here recorded, viz. John, Matthew, Rachel, Abigail, and Mary.\n\nHis son John Bouton had two children, Jakin Bouton and Joseph Bouton, and no others appear on the record.\n\nHis grandson Jakin Bouton, had two children by his first wife, Joseph Bouton and Sarah Bouton, and by his second wife, two sons, Esaias Bouton and Moses Bouton, and seven or eight daughters.\n\nJoseph Bouton, his great-grandson, married Susannah Raymond, August 25, 1748, daughter of Joshua Raymond, and had eleven children, six sons and five daughters. The sons were William Bouton, Joshua Bouton, Joseph Bouton, Seth Bouton, Ira Bouton, and Aaron Bouton. The daughters were Rebeckah Bouton, Betty Bouton, Nancy Bouton, Susannah Bouton, and Deborah Bouton. He was an officer in the expedition sent against the French Provinces in 1758/59, and kept a journal of the service, which was unfortunately lost in pulling down the old family mansion, a few years since, which stood on the spot where Deacon John Bouton, his grandson, now resides.\n\nfound on ancestry.com\n\nMade Free\n\n1636-1665, Connecticut\n\nPublic Records of Connecticut Volume One April 1636-April 1665\n\nPage 433\n\nFor Norwalke, Dan Kellog, Math: Maruen, Thomas Betts, Mark Senssions, John Bouten, Edward Nash, Thomas Lupton,\n\nAre excepted to be made free, and Mr. Campfeild is to administer the oath of freedome to them in May next, if nothing fall in\n\nas a just exception against either of them in the interrem.\n\nhttp://www.colonialct.uconn.edu /ViewPageByPageNew.cfm?ID=101&Volume=1&Master=77&Letter=B&v=01&p=433&c=4\n\nfound on ancestry.com\n\nProbate records\n\n1665-1675, Connecticut\n\nThe first probate is for Richard, the brother of John and the Son of John, The second is for the wife of Richard where custody of her daughter is given to Matthew Marvin, Father of John Boulton's wife, leading one to wonder if she was a sister of John's wife.

His lot of four acres was opposite Matthew Marvin, Jr.'s, a little further west, on the corner of the Stamford road, with the minister's and John Ruscoe's on the east. Thomas Lupton was on the south, who sold to Platt in 1665, and in 1674 Bouton purchased of Platt. In 1675 his estate of \"commonage\" was oe339;100, and in 1687, oe339;184., 15. He was chosen \"survaior\" in 1670; was selectman in 1671, '74, '79, '83, '84, '85 and '89, and represented Norwalk in the General Court in 1671, '73, '74, '75, and again some years later, until 1685. In 1678 he was on a \"comite chosen to oversee the work about the meting-house,\" and one of those to entertain the gentlemen called to settle the differences about moving that building. In 1686 he was on the committees to seat the new meeting-house, and to \"settle the differences about the head-lynes,\" and 16 Jan'y, 1695, to obtain a minister. He was \"serjeant\" of the Norwalk train-band. John \"of Norwalk\" mentions in his will, then wife Mary; sons Matthew, Joseph, Thomas and Richard; daughters Rachel Sension, Abigail Smith, Hannah Betts, Elizabeth Warrin and Mary Bouton; grandchild John Bouton, of Danbury; it was witnessed by William Haines and John Gregory. Joseph his son, and Mary his widow, approved it when presented, but \"Matthew Sension, Edman Warrin and James Betts, sons-in-law to the deceased John Bouton, agrieved, appealed.\" Joseph approved the inventory 18 February, 1707. The will as allowed was recorded 7 February, 1709.\n\nJohn Bouton was among the first settlers of Norwalk. He was a French Protestant, and it is said there are many of the same name still living in France and Germany, and that a great similarity exists between the families there and here. He had five children after his marriage as here recorded, viz. John, Matthew, Rachel, Abigail, and Mary.***Somehow daughter Elizabeth Bouton born1681 is overlooked. Birth, death and burial data for Elizabeth Bouton from Jacobus(1), p. 4. Birthplace from LDS 8726104/23, which says born in 1673. Marriage date could be October 16, 1698.***Sergt. John Bouton 2d (John1) was born in 1636. He married (1) Abigail Marvin, daughter of Matthew Marvin and Elizabeth Gregory, on 1 January 1656/57 in Norwalk, Fairfield County, Connecticut. He married Mary after November 1689 (Mary was the widow of (1) Thomas Allen and (2) Jonathan Stevenson). He died after 27 January 1706/7 and before 25 December 1709 in Norwalk, Fairfield County, Connecticut.\n\nThe John Bouton who received a home lot in Norwalk seems to have been the son -- widow Alice remarried by 1647 and Norwalk was not settled until 1650. He was one of the first settlers of Norwalk. He was Deputy to the Connecticut Legislature between 1669 and 1685 from Norwalk, Fairfield County, Connecticut, and Sergeant of the Norwalk Trainband. The will of John Bouton Sr. of Norwalk is dated 25 December 1706; probated 27 January 1706/7. He mentions wife Mary, grandchild John Bowton of Danbury, sons Mathew and Joseph Bowton; daughter Rachel Sension, son Thomas Bowton, daughter Elizabeth Warrin, son Richard Bowton, daughter Mary Bowton; three sons: Joseph, Thomas and Richard; Matthew Sension, \"Edman Waren,\" and James Betts, sons-in-law to the deceased. Appealed.\n\nOn 16 July 1720, Mary Bouton of Norwalk distributed property to son Thomas Bouton, daughter Mary Morehouse, to \"Thomas and Richard,\" geese to Thomas Bouton, he to give one gander and two geese to John Betts' wife; my three grandchildren Thomas Bouton, Richard Bouton and Mary Morehouse land at \"Compow in Fairfield\"; my grandchildren Mary Hayes, Ruth Bouton, and Gabriel Morehouse.FROM: http://www.theellisons.net/ghtout/npr21.htm#rnn3524\n\nOn 13 October 1664, he was made a freeman. Once he was enfranchised, he became active in town affairs. John served as a Deputy to the Connecticut Legislature on many occasions. He was elected to that position on October 1669, October 1671, October 1673, May 1674, May 1675, October 1676, May and October 1677, May 1678, October 1679, May 1680, May 1681, May and October 1682, May 1683, May and October 1685. He was chosen Surveyor on 21 February 1670; and Selectman in 1671, 1674, 1679, 1683, 1684, and 1689.\n\nOn 2 June 1666, John and several others (including his brother-in-law Daniel Kellogg) were granted all that creek lying between Thomas Seymour's barn and the Barren Marsh, for which they were to procure a highway to Bowton's Island. On 4 December 1668, he drew lot number 26 in the division of the winter wheat field. In 1671, his land was appraised at Â£100. In 1674, he purchased the lot to the immediate south of his from a Mr. Platt, who had purchased it from Thomas Lupton in 1665. In 1685, a \"Cattelog of a division of land agreed to be layd out at three acors to the hundred: with the severall lotts as they were drawn by the inhabitants\" listed John as John Bouton 16.\" On 12 December 1687, town records show the following:\" All common land Over the River, leaving sufficient for highways, to be laid out, to the inhabitants, according to their estates. Three score acors of the same sequestered for the Indians. A division granted of 20 Acres to the hundred. The number of Lotts and the order as they were drawn, of that Division of Land over Norwalk River below the path leading to Meadow field . . . John Bouton, senr., 49.\"\n\nBy 3 January 1687, his land value had risen to Â£184.15.00.He also served on a number of committees, many of which revolved around the town meeting house. On 31 January 1678, he was named to a committee \"chosen to oversee the work about the meting-house,\" and to entertain the gentlemen called upon to settle the differences about moving that building. In March 1678/9, it was voted that the Committee \"should goe on with the worke Comitted to them, in refference to the meeting house, and to goe on with the worke forthwith according to their best Discression.\" In 1686, he was on a related committee formed to seat the new meeting house and to \"settle the differences about the head-lynes.\" Finally, on 16 Januray 1694/5, he was on a committee formed to \"exercise their best prudence for to look out for, and endeavorr what in them lyeth, in the use of all lawfull meanes, for to obtaine a faithful Minister and dispenser of the word of the Gospel to us in this place; and they are to take care for his entertainment when obtained.\" He also served as a sergeant in the Norwalk Train Band.\n\nFROM: Will of John Bouton of Norwalk.
