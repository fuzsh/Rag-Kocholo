        "text": "Moved from New London to Norwich to become one of the 35 original proprietors. At the age of 22 in the year 1660, he was one of the youngest of the proprietors.\n\nThere is not a great deal of information known about Jonathan Royce’s occupation or contributions to Norwich. However, it was recorded that he was made a freeman in October 1663. The designation of “freeman” gave him the right to vote and the responsibility to serve as a jury member. It is believed that he was a farmer.\n\nFAMILY\n\nJonathan Royce married Mary Spinning Royce (1638/9-1658) in June 1656. Jonathan and Mary were about 18 years old when they married.

Soon thereafter, he became one of the first religious teachers in Marshfield Massachusetts. Two years later he was appointed to a committee that was charged with viewing and measuring all the meadows of Green Harbor (a.k.a. Marshfield) which had not yet been granted.\n\nAfter moving to New Haven, Connecticut, he agreed to care for the town’s sheep in exchange for the use of a pasture. The Smith family later moved to Long Island, New York where he also tended sheep. Later in 1652 to New London, Connecticut and finally settled in Norwich in November 1659.\n\nFAMILY\n\nReverend Nehemiah Smith married Ann Bourne Smith (1615-1684) in Marshfield, Massachusetts in 1640.

In 1659, he received a twelve-acre house-lot, however, by his death in 1702 he had accumulated seventeen parcels of land that encompassed 3,000-4,200 acres. The title to parts of his land in the Quinebaug River region of Windham County was later disputed.\n\nThroughout his lifetime he served the community in several capacities. In 1681, he was made a freeman, this gave him the right to vote in town matters and the responsibility to serve as a juror, if called. He later became the Justice of the Peace and also represented the town in the Connecticut Colony Legislature for six years.\n\nIn the latter years of his life, John Tracy worked with several other church members to make improvements to the church building and the surrounding land. In 1689 the group enlarged the building by adding a “lean-to”, into which new pews were added. Later, in 1697, the group built a “seat” on the church grounds for their “convenient sitting on the Lord’s Days”. In 1698, at a town meeting, it was decided that members of the church should be seated according to rank. The seats varied in “dignity”. There were eight tiers of “dignity”. Refer to Info Source 2 for details.\n\nFAMILY\n\nJohn Tracy Sr. was born in 1642 and was the son of Lt. Thomas Tracy. He married Mary Winslow Tracy in 1670.

Thomas Tracy was a member of Lt. Thomas Leffingwell’s relief party to Uncas when the Mohegan were besieged at Shattucks Point (modern-day Fort Shantock) by Narragansetts.\n\nLater, in October 1666, Thomas Tracy was confirmed as the Ensign of the first train-band (a.k.a. militia) organized in Norwich. A train-band of 32 members had only one Lieutenant, one Ensign and two Sergeants. Lt. Francis Griswold was confirmed as the Lieutenant in the same train-band by the same General Court Order.\n\nIn August 1673 Thomas was confirmed as a Lieutenant in the New London County Dragoons. He served as their Quartermaster. The Dragoons were enlisted to fight in King Philip’s War against the Dutch and Indians.\n\nAs a young man Thomas Tracy was a ship carpenter. He was also one of the Founders of Saybrook before becoming one of Norwich’s first proprietors. Thomas Tracy was evidently a man of talent, skillful in the management of various kinds of business, both upright and discreet. The confidence placed in him by his associates is manifested in the great number of appointments which he received. His name is on the roll of the Connecticut Legislature as representative from Norwich at twenty-seven sessions.\n\nIn 1678, he was appointed as the Norwich Justice of the Peace.\n\nFAMILY\n\nThomas Tracy was born in 1610. The name of his first wife is unknown. However it is known that she was born circa 1620 and she died sometime prior to 1676. She was the mother of their seven children. Their names were :\n\n1) John Tracy Sr. (circa 1642-1702) : Husband of Mary Winslow Tracy\n\n2) Ensign Thomas Tracy Jr. (circa 1644-1721) : His wife’s name is unknown, but it is believed to have been Sarah .

After her death, he married Mary Foote Stoddard, in 1680, the widow of John Stoddard Sr.\n\nEARLY NORWICH INNKEEPERS\n\nThomas Waterman became the first innkeeper in Norwich in 1679. Innkeepers were thought of as town officers. The appointment was one of honor and respect. To obtain and maintain a “House of Entertainment” a man had to be of good character and possess a comfortable estate.\n\nThe privilege was later granted to Deacon Simon Huntington in 1690. And, later still in 1700, the liberty of keeping an inn was given to Ensign Thomas Leffingwell. The photo on the left shows the Leffingwell Inn, built in 1675.\n\nLike most, if not all of the early settlers, Thomas Waterman was also an active member of the church. In 1689 he and three other of the first proprietors, were appointed to a committee “to consider and contrive to the enlargement of the meeting-house”. Soon thereafter a lean-to along with several new pews were added to the Church on the Hill.\n\nIn 1709-1710 the church members voted to build a new meeting-house. The new church, also located on top of the hill, was completed in 1713. Lands were granted to help repay all who had contributed their labor or money towards its erection. Thomas Waterman, “for his labor and cost in providing stones for steps at the meeting house doors” received 22 acres at the Landing Place (near the present-day Norwich Police Station).\n\nUpon his death the inventory of his belongings included £855 pounds sterling (approximately $82,000 in today’s dollars), ten oxen, ten cows and abundant household goods. He also left three sons and five daughters who became ancestors of a long line of the Waterman family.\n\nFAMILY\n\nThomas Waterman was born in 1644. His father was Robert Waterman and his mother was Elizabeth Bourne Waterman. Thomas married Miriam Tracy (1648-1732), the only daughter of Lt. Thomas Tracy, in 1668 in Norwich.
