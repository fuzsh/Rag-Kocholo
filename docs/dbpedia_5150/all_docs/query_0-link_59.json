On January 23, 1874 he married Jemima Saunders of Burlington, a daughter of Walter and Margaret (Toole) Saunders. They then lived at the corner of the Shore Road and what was later to become known as the Nollet Beckwith Road. Samuel was a farmer and fisherman. After his wife died in 1891, Samuel continued to live with his son Nollet until his death on June 1, 1905. He was then buried beside his wife in the Burlington Cemetery. They had nine children.

Cain and lived in Connecticut while Amina married Edward Ahern and died in Florida. It should be noted that John Kane and William C. Cain were in fact brothers. The true spelling of their surname was Kane, however for some reason, William chose to spell his name as Cain.\n\nJemima (Saunders) Beckwith was a daughter of Walter and Margaret (Toole) Saunders. She was born on January 31, 1853 in Annapolis County. On January 23, 1874 she married Samuel Beckwith of Long Point, a son of Samuel and Mary (Sanford) Beckwith. They then lived at the corner of the Shore Road and what was later to become known as the Nollet Beckwith Road where Samuel farmed and fished.

She was born in Woodlawn on April 18, 1875. Bertha then lived with her family at the corner of the Shore Road and what was later to become known as the Nollet Beckwith Road. After 1891 she moved to Saint John, New Brunswick to further her studies. From there, Bertha moved to the United States where she became a registered nurse. After that she attended New York University where she received her doctorate in medicine. Unable to serve overseas as a medical doctor in World War I, she went and worked as a nurse. At that time she was the first person to use physiotherapy treatment for patients who were wounded soldiers. It is believed that she then lived the rest of her life in New York City where she died on August 20, 1967. Following her service at Riverside Church in New York City she was buried in the Burlington Cemetery. Her cemetery inscription indicated her birth year to be 1876 when in fact the birth records for Kings County shows her correct year of birth to be 1875.

Mathew BECKWITH (of the eighth generation from Adam BECKWITH, who was born in Pontefract, Yorkshire, England, 22nd Sept. 1610, emigrated to New England in 1635 and resided for a short time at Saybrook Point. He moved thence to Bramford in 1638; was among the first settlers of Hartford, Conn. in 1642 and finally settled at Lynne in 1651. He purchased large tracts of land on the Willimantic River. For him was constructed the bark \"Endeavor\", the first vessel launched from New London. He traded largely with Barbados and was of the class known as 'planters'. Mathew Beckwith died 13th Dec. 1681. His grandson, James BECKWITH was born at New London, June 1st, 1671, removed to Lynne in 1692, married Sarah GRISWOLD, Sept. 16th, 1693 and died in 1719. His wife died Oct. 10th, 1714. He has a large family. Two of his sons, Samuel BECKWITH and Renald BECKWITH migrated to Nova Scotia in 1760 and became the founders of the Beckwith families in the Maritime Provinces. Samuel was born at Lynne, Conn. May 14th, 1709 and in 1740 married Miriam MARVIN d/o Capt. Renald MARVIN of Lynne. They had three sons, Samuel BECKWITH, Marvin BECKWITH and John BECKWITH. When the French were expelled from Horton and Cornwallis, the British government held out strong inducements to New Englanders to occupy the land, and one of the results was the sailing of a fleet of 22 vessels from Connecticut, carrying a large colony. This fleet arrived June 4th, 1760 and the colonists landed near the town plot of Cornwallis. Among this goodly company was Samuel Beckwith and his two sons, Samuel and John. Marvin, the other son, remained in the United States. Samuel Beckwith, Sr. received a large grant of land from the British government. His son, Samuel, who became a merchant and extensive farmer of Cornwallis, married Miss Rebecca CHIPMAN who was born at Newport, Rhode Island, Nov. 21st., 1750. They had four daughters and one son, Marvin H. BECKWITH, who settled at Halifax. One of his sons, Rev. William BECKWITH, a Baptist clergyman has been in the province many years. Mrs. WORTMAN, one of the daughters of Samuel Beckwith, lived in St. John some time, removed to Moncton and died there. John Beckwith became a wealthy land owner. He owned all the dike land on the Canard River above what is now called Middle Dike. He married Miss Catherine CHIPMAN, sister to his brother's wife, by whom he had issue, two sons, John C. BECKWITH and Handley BECKWITH and six daughters. Five of the daughters married respectively, Mr. SANFORD, Mr. PINEO, Mr. BARNABY, Mr. MORSE and Mr. COGSWELL. His son, John C. had one son, Chipman BECKWITH who at one time conducted a hotel in St. John and three daughters who married Mr. CALHOUN, Mr. WELLS and Mr. STEVENS, all of Albert Co. His other son, Handley, born at Cornwallis, March 6th, 1770, married a Miss NEWCOMB by whom he had 13 children, but only six lived to mature age. He died Feb. 29th, 1860, and his wife died March 19th, 1863. Joseph BECKWITH, his second son, was called 'the sweet singer of Israel'. He has a daughter and three granddaughters residing here, Mrs. STARR and her daughter, Mrs. John MITCHELL of Rothesay, Mrs. Walter MITCHELL of this city and Mrs. Allen SHARPE, Carleton. His third son, Mayhew BECKWITH, born at Cornwallis in 1798 and who died April 7th, 1871, was a prominent merchant in that community, a leading Baptist and took a leading part in the organization of Acadian University and represented Kings Co. in the N.S. Legislature about 20 years. He married Miss Eunice RAND, sister of Hon. Caleb RAND of Kentville, March 21st, 1829. She died Feb. 8th, 1852. They had eleven children, nine of whom are still living. His eldest son, John A. BECKWITH, once a merchant of Cornwallis, is now one of the most celebrated fruit growers and packers, as well as farmers of Nictouax, N.S. He married Miss Barniby of Cornwallis and had seven sons, all of whom, following Horace Greeley's advise went west. Two are at Victoria, B.C., two at Portland, Oregon and one in Montana. One is dead. Mayhew's second child is the wife of James E. MASTERS of St. John; his third, Robert Nelson BECKWITH of the customs dept., Halifax is father of the popular purser of the \"Duart Castle\"; his fourth is the wife of T.H. RANDALL of Lawrencetown, N.S.; his wife is the sixth of V.A. LANDRY, proprietor of the Weymouth, N.S. 'Free Press' and L'Evangeline newspapers; the seventh is the wife of M. SHEFFIELD, M.D. of St. John; the eighth, Edward M. BECKWITH, is a flour merchant, ship owner and acting J.P. at Canning, N.S.; the nighth, Mayhew Burpee BECKWITH is in the employ of the British government, as government physician at Jamaica and the tenth is the widow of W.A. SHEFFIELD, Shieffield's Mills, Cornwallis, N.S. There is nothing in the records or tradition to show that Renald Beckwith, born at Lynne, Conn. Feb. 6th, 1706 ever went to Cornwallis, N.S. with his brother Samuel, and it is clear, that he never settled there. Records state, however, that he went to Fredericton, N.B., where he married Miss Mary HANDLEY. One of his sons, Nehemiah BECKWITH, who was born in Connecticut, but settled in Fredericton, met his death by drowning, married Miss Julia LeBRUN, a descendant of C.L. LeBRUN de Du Plessis, cousin and provate secretary to the great Cardinal de Richelieu. One of Nehemiah's sons, the late John A. Beckwith, who born at Fredericton, Dec. 1st, 1800, filled many high offices. He represented York Co. for eleven years, was a member of the Excutive Council and Provincial Secretary from 1867 to 1871 and was called to the Legislative Council in 1874. He was for a time mayor of Fredericton, chairman of the provincial board opf agriculture, a director of the Quebec and N.B. Railway, and also held office of the agent of the N.B. and N.S. Land Co. Hon. John A. Beckwith was twice marriage. One of his sons is mayor of Fredericton, one city clerk of Fredericton and another chief engineer of the provincial public works department. A fourth son resides in Boston. One of his daughters married James HAZEN of Oromocto (Sunbury Co.) and is the mother of J.D. HAZEN, M.P. for St. John.\n\nDate July 2, 1810\n\nCounty York\n\nPlace Fredericton\n\nNewspaper The New Brunswick Royal Gazette\n\nEst. John BECKWITH, Cornwallis, N.S.; Exec.

O. PARKER.\n\nWednesday, May 5, 1897\n\nAsa Beckwith.\n\nHere Asa Beckwith was a bold and enterprising man,\n\nHe sought to make his fortune by a new projected plan;\n\nHis enterprise was this, to make his hens lay golden eggs,\n\nBy giving them a wide, but guarded use of wings and legs.\n\nTo bring about and realize this enterprising scheme,\n\nAnd demonstrate to all this was no idle dreamerÂ’s dream,\n\nOld slabs he hauled in heaps for days, and weeks from distant mills,\n\nThen round his acres wide he stood them up like corn in drills;\n\nAnd here his flocks in freedom sweet from stones and dread alarm,\n\nDid cackle, scratch and crow and never did his neighborÂ’s harm;\n\nAnd that was all, though richly fed and watched with patient care,\n\nAlas, for him! The golden eggs he dreamed were never there.\n\nAnd then he sought a better home, but one he never found;\n\nAnd while abroad he lived an honest worker of the ground,\n\nSo central here, so rich his wide domain of fertile land,\n\nHe might have lived in lordly ease and died a wealthy man.\n\nDr. Kerr Beckwith.\n\nHis brother Kerr forsook the family farm and chose the healing art,\n\nHe wore fine clothes and had a gentle maidenÂ’s heart;\n\nWhen for a nervous, suffering, howling, growling, frenzied youth,\n\nHe would relieve the pain by taking out a naughty tooth,\n\nThen in his sympathy I have heard his neighborÂ’s loud assert,\n\nHeÂ’d take the turnkey off and ask the patient, \"does it hurt?\"\n\nÂ‘Twas meant for him a slur, but was indeed a compliment,\n\nOne which no honest, earnest prudent doctor would resent;\n\nFor doctors with their nerves of steel should have a womanÂ’s heart,\n\nFor pity softens pain and helps alleviate the smart.\n\nHe was the first of the great doctor harvest gathered here;\n\nA harvest like the orchard fields, enlarging every year.\n\nA useful life he lived \"in practice\" on the southern shore,\n\nAnd toiled with windmills there to supersede the sail and oar,\n\nAnd on the water made his little model boat to ride,\n\nThe genius of his scheme to prove against the wind and tide.\n\nNotes. Â– Mr. Asa BeckwithÂ’s home was nearly opposite the Baptist parsonage. He owned the land on which a large part of the village is built west of Commercial St. His poultry yard which was about opposite his house in the eyes of a child was then a great enterprise; it however proved a failure.\n\nHis brother Kerr was for many years an esteemed doctor in Lockeport and had great faith in wind as a motive power and claimed much for a windmill of his own construction. He actually propelled a small boat with a windmill.\n\nBefore passing on to the Institutions of the Long Ago, I will give as representing the \"Deacon\" the lines revised with additions which have already imperfectly appeared in print, entitled \"The Old Homestead.\" Rev. Wm. Chipman and wife, though not residents of Berwick, were so closely associated with all its social, educational and religious interests, that they will be given a liberal place in these Reminiscences.\n\nThere were others in the vicinity of Berwick but the most I remember of them is their names. Andrew Woodworth in the west, Holmes Morton on the old Valley road, Solomon Crocker and Benjamin Killam on CrockerÂ’s lane and Wm. Woodworth across the river at the end of Woodworth lane.\n\nJuly 20th 1898 Register\n\nDEATH OF DR. BECKWITH. - Dr. Burpee Beckwith son of the late Mayhew Beckwith, Esq., and a former resident of Berwick, died very suddenly last week while on a journey from Jamaica to Halifax. He was apparently in the best of health, and on Wednesday at 7.30 was on deck talking to the mate. He went below to his room and one of the stewards asked him if he would have some coffee.\n\nHe replied in the negative, but said he would have some seltzer instead. He afterwards went to lie down, and when his daughter, who was accompanying him, went to his room less than two hours later, she found him stretched out, appearing ghastly white. She called the steward, who found that he was quite cold, and had probably expired within a half hour previous. The body was brought to Halifax whence it was sent to Canard for burial. Dr. Beckwith leaves a widow - a sister of the Misses Musgrave, of Aylesford.\n\nJuly 27th 1898 - On Wednesday, 13th July, on board the S.S. Beta, on voyage from Jamaica to Halifax, Burpee Mayhew Beckwith; M.D., son of the late Mayhew Beckwith, of Canard, in the 51st year of his age.\n\nWednesday, September 27, 1899\n\nThe Wedding.\n\nThe marriage ceremony was performed on Saturday last at 8.30 oÂ’clock between Harvey Reginald Fuller, son of L. Fuller, Esq., of Welsford, and Miss Lalia Beckwith Reid, daughter of Mr. W. D. Reid, of the same place.\n\nThe ceremony took place at the residence of the brideÂ’s parents, in the presence of a few relatives and friends of the family. The parlor had been neatly decorated for the occasion, the bridal party taking its place under a floral arch.\n\nThe bride, who was tastefully attired in a travelling suit of blue cadet cloth, entered the room while the wedding march was played by her sister, Miss May Reid. The ceremony was performed by the Rev. D. H. Simpson, assisted by the Rev. J. W. Prestwood. At its close, the newly married couple, after receiving congratulations and best wishes of friends, partook of a wedding breakfast with the family and guests, a number of whom drove with them to Berwick station, where Mr. and Mrs. Fuller took the morning express for Yarmouth, en route to their future home in Charlestown, Mass.\n\nExtract from September 13, 1933 article by Rev. D. O. Parker in 1900 - \"Early in the 1820Â’s came the Beckwiths', also United Empire Loyalist, and laid claim to territory extending west to Andrew MortonÂ’s. There were three brothers, Asa, Samuel and Kerr. Asa BeckwithÂ’s home was on the site of J. M. PattersonÂ’s house. Kerr became a doctor and practiced a number of years in Lockport. Samuel, the father of Mr. James Beckwith, lived where L. D. Robinson now lives. He was a Justice of the Peace, taught singing school and understood the art of road-building. It was he who first surveyed and laid out Main Street.\""
