His mother's maiden name is UNKNOWN and assignment of her last name (LNAB) of \"Gillyat\" is highly speculative at best.[2] He was baptized at St Marys Church, Great Bentley, Essex, England on March 25 or 26, 1600.[3][4]\n\nBy the will of his father, who died in 1615, Matthew received the \"mentchon house called Edons alles (alias) Dreybrockes, and in Croftes of land called Hartles and Brocken Heddes\", on the condition that he pay to his mother yearly during her life \"the fulle sume of Sexe Poundes\", in default of which it was to pass to his brother Reinold with a like condition. He was then about fifteen years old. He probably resided there with his mother until her death in May 1633.\n\nHe married Elizabeth _____ by 1622. Her maiden name is unknown.[5][6][7][8] Torrey's New England Marriages to 1700 gives her surname as [?Gregory], which is certainly not very confident,[9] supposedly Elizabeth Gregory, daughter of Henry Gregory. See G2G\n\nElizabeth and Matthew had seven children.\n\nHe served as \"sydeman\" at St. Mary's in 1621; \"overseer\" in 1627; senior warden in 1628.\n\nMatthew embarked for New England after the death of his mother in 1633. We know he was made a Freeman before departing England as Robert Lea, Master of the Increase proved that his party had taken the oath of Allegiance and Supremacy prior to sailing. Matthew sailed from London on the Increase for Boston, in April 1635, with his wife Elizabeth (aged 32), his five oldest children[3] and two men servants (Jo Warner, 20 yr and Isaac More 13 yr old). In 1638, Reinold, Matthew's older brother, also moved to New England.\n\nThe western movement of colonists to the Connecticut River region had already begun and from the vicinity of Boston, in the early autumn of 1635, a group of pioneers made their way along Indian paths to the Great River and thence down toward the Dutch fort or trading post which had been built on the southern side of the Little River which flows into the Connecticut and which became a bisecting line through the later city of Hartford. The newcomers laid out their home lots and built their dugouts upon the ridge above the meadow and back from the Little River, on its north side. How many remained all through the bitter winter is not clear. The greater, and better-known, migration came the next summer, when the Rev. Thomas Hooker with the larger part of his congregation left Newtown, Mass. the 31st of May for the new plantation, where most of the families settled south of the Little River. Known as Suckiaug to the first comers, the name Hartford was given, February 21, 1636/7, to the town.\n\nMatthew Marvin was one of the original settlers of Hartford (about November 1635) and resided for some years on the corner of Village and Front Streets. Surveyor of Highways in 1639 and 1647. On 9 November 1640, Matthew and a neighbor were fined five shillings \"for putting over of their hoges over the great [Connecticut] river.\" In March 1641, in an agreement about fencing land to the corner of John Clark's lot in the Soldier's Field, Matthew agreed to maintain a common gate with the caveat that \"if any children shal be taken [found] swinging [on the gate] by the said matthew mervill [sic], he shall complayn to their parents or masters and if they doe not restraine them the second time it shall be lawful for him to prevent them, and if they brake the gate ther parents or masters shall make it good.\" The family attended the Hartford First Church.\n\nThe Founders' monument in the city carries the names of both groups and the names of others who arrived individually and helped in establishing the settlement.[10] In the Adventurers' Green on Hartford's main street, has been set up in recent years a stone bearing the names of the Adventurers, those who arrived in the autumn of 1635, the North-siders. Matthew Marvin's name appears on the Founders' monument and on the Adventurers' stone.\n\nElizabeth died around 1642, probably in Hartford. About 1647 at Hartford, Connecticut, he married Alice, the widow of his daughter-in-law's father John Bouton. Matthew and Alice had three children, and Alice brought three Bouton children from her first marriage. There is question as to Alice's maiden name. Some say it was Alice Kellogg, b. March 26, 1600 in Essex, England. See Research Notes for a full discussion of Alice (___) (Bouton) Marvin.\n\nIn 1648/9, he received a bounty of ten shillings from the town for killing a wolf. On 22 April 1649, he sued Matthew Beckwith for defamation of character and recovered damages in the amount of Â£50. The Court remitted the fine on condition that Beckwith make a public retraction of his slander. Matthew apparently contemplated moving to Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut, where his brother Reinold had settled; he owned both lands and dwelling houses there. He decided against the move, and before 1653, the date the transfer was recorded, he sold his Farmington holdings to Nathaniel Kellogg. Instead, on 19 June 1650, he was one of those who signed an agreement for the founding of Norwalk, Fairfield County, Connecticut, where he was one of the original grantees. His name also appears third on a deed dated 15 February 1651 from the sachem Runckiriheage. He is remembered as a First Settler.[3]\n\nHe was a settler on the original Ludlow Agreement lands. His four acre homelot in Norwalk -- No. 10 -- was in a place of honor next to the meeting house. On May 19, 1654, he was \"freed from watching and training\". In 1664, when the meeting house was enlarged, he and Thomas Fitch were appointed \"to call out as many men as they think fitt . . . to fell and cutt the timber and allso to summon each to draw saied timber,\" and to \"provide a luncheon and a barrel of good beans for the help.\"\n\nTowards the close of his life he made a series of land transfers to his daughters, and the appraisal list of 9 February 1671/2 showed that the value of his estate had shrunk to Â£169. He still owned land in adjacent villages. Records show that on 11 July 1672 he sold a farm at Saukatuck of about forty acres to Peter Clayton.\n\nHe died at Norwalk, Connecticut, between December 20, 1678, the date he signed his Will, and July 12, 1680, the date the inventory of his estate wake taken. [3]\n\nMatthew's wife Alice died December 17, 1680.[3][11]\n\nWill\n\nMatthew's will was dated 26 Dec 1678[12] and the inventory, July 12, 1680 in Norwalk, Connecticut.\n\n\"To all Christian people to whom these presents shall come greeting -- I Mathew Marvin Senr of Norwalk in the County of fairfield in the Colleney of Connecticot being aged fourscore years or ther aboute though weake and feeble in body yet through the mercy of God of perfect mind and Memory disallowing disowning cancelling and making void all former wills and writings of this kind hitherto made by me doe make ordayne and appoint this present wrighting to be my last Will and Testament.\n\n\"First I doe bequeath and resigne up my soul unto God who gave it and doe commit my body to the duste from whence it came to be Interred by desent and comely buriall hoping and Trusting in the Lord of a happy Resurrection at the Last day: and as for the Temporal effects wherewith the Lord hath blessed me I doe will and dispose thereof as followeth.

[citation needed]\n\nResearch Notes\n\nDisputed Wife's maiden name:\n\nThe following book has a compelling discussion on the Bouton Marvin relationship. A study of the sources mentioned may provide new evidence for this marriage. [24] Archive.org link\n\nMatthew Marvin and his Second wife, Widow Alice Bouton by Wiliam T. R. Marvin.[25] [1] Publication date 1944.\n\nTorrey's New England Marriages Prior to 1700 records[26] indicate a marriage between Mathew Marvin born 1600 and Alice (____) Bouton.\n\nThere appears to be no solid evidence for the identity of Matthew Martin's second wife, Alice. There are theories that she was Alice Kellogg. Due to the lack of proof, Matthew's wife Alice is shown here as Alice Unknown. Please read the discussion that follows to the see the research into the dispute.\n\nAmong family historians, the notion that Matthew Marvin's second wife, Alice, had been previously married to John Bouton wasn't known until 1897. The earlier Kellogg association likely springs from a reference in her will to a daughter, Bridget Kellogg. In hindsight, others suppose an early author and/or his correspondents thought Alice might have been the widow or mother of Daniel Kellogg, thus Alice (____) Kellogg or, \"Mrs. Alice Kellogg.\"\n\nSome years later, updated family associations connected Alice as the first wife of John Bouton and, thus, the mother of Bridgett (Bouton) Kellogg. For those interested only in the published correction, see the work below, others may want to read on.\n\nWilliam T. R. Marvin, \"Matthew Marvin and his second wife, widow Alice Bouton,`\" New England Historical and Genealogical Register 51 (1897):330-334. At p. 330 he writes of the \"Mrs. Alice Kellogg\" identification saying, \"I have recently found that this was an inference made by one of his [T. R. Marvin's] correspondents--whether based on inspection of the will of Alice Marvin, or from some other source, cannot now be determined.\" Marvin\n\nAs early as 1845 and 1848, T. R. Marvin printed and distributed small books about the Marvin family. The author's son later described the early material as \"one of the first family-histories ever published in this country.\"[27] In 1862, T. R. Marvin authored âDescendants of Reinold and Matthew Marvin, who came to New England in 1635,â published and distributed in_New England Historical and Genealogical Register_ 16.[3] The later article cited globally, \"authentic sources,\" and it identified Matthew Marvin's second wife as \"Mrs. Alice Kellogg.\"[3]\n\nUpon request thirty years later, William T. R. Marvin recompiled his father's notes and correspondence. Again the notion of \"Mrs. Alice Kellogg\" became published distributed, this time by Edward E. and Evelyn (McCurdy) Salisbury as \"Marvin-Marvyn-Mervyn,\" in the third volume of Family histories and genealogies. A series of genealogical and biographical monographs on the families of ...â¦ (1892).[28]\n\nBy the time the oversight about Alice was discovered (1897), information confused about John Bouton in Savage (1860)[29] had advanced to an all but fictional account of the immigrant in James Bouton's Bouton--Boughton family ...[30] Of this work, one author later wrote \"The account of the origin of the Bouton family and its founder in New England given in James Boutonâs Bouton-Bouhton Family (1890) contains so many mistakes that it has to be disregarded.â[31]\n\nSometimes a good genealogical mistake, once documented and outdated, takes on a life/notion of its own. That seems to be the case with Alice's identity. Ala, \"if she was not 'Mrs. Alice Kellogg,' let us cling to the notion she was 'Alice Kellogg' and thus seek a daddy!\"\n\nFor dear Alice, this might explain the apparent oversight by Charles Arthur Hoppin, who set out to correct James Bouton's record. In 1932, Hoppin wrote, \"One cannot but be amazed at such unintelligent interpretations of history and such unscientific misapplications of records as appear in the book by James Boughton [Bouton-Bouhton Family, 1890] and elsewhere.\"[23] In want of correcting the earlier 1890 tale of John Bouton's three wives, Hoppin unfortunately continued his criticism with the statement, \"It entirely omits his only known wife, Alice Kellogg â¦\"\n\nAttempting to weave pre-1897 references with later dated materials, some of which he mis-quotes or mis-cites; adding his own supposition, Hoppin advances a discussion of about the possible parentage of \"Alice Kellogg.\" In his otherwise oft-cited work Hoppins wrote,\n\n\"Doubtless, [Alice Kellogg] came to New England 1635/36 with Nathaniel Kellogg; but it is not clear whether she was his sister, niece, cousin, or granddaughter of William and Alice Kellogg of Saffron Walden, Essex England. Nathaniel Kellogg was born about 1600, evidently at Braintree, Essex, England, where his parents resided after leaving the adjacent Great Leighs, where their earlier children were baptized. The Braintree vital records are lost prior to 1660, and the births and baptisms of some of Nathaniel's known brothers and sisters are not recorded. The vital records of Debden, Great Leighs, and Saffron Walden reveal the Kellogg connections there. Alice (Kellogg) Bowton-Marvin, from the American viewpoint, seems to have been a granddaughter of William and Alice, or a sister of Nathaniel, or a daughter of Thomas and Annis (Hare) Kellogg, daughter of Nathaniel's elder brother Robert of Braintree â¦ [chart appears].\"[32]\n\nIn the years since the correction about \"Mrs. Alice Kellogg\" was published (1897), countless authors have made attempts to correct the record. I hope the WikiTree community helps broadcast that corrected record and thank Vic Watt for providing the opportunity.\n\nIt seems highly doubtful there was an Alice Kellogg born \"March 26, 1600 in Essex, England.\" Essex, England is the location given for Matthew Marvin's birth, the date of which is at times written \"March 26, 1599/1600.\"\n\nT. R. Marvin's early 1848 work, the contents of which mostly pertain to the family of Matthew's brother, Reinold, does not mention the name Kellogg.\n\nSources\n\nâ Roberts, Gary Boyd; Ancestors of American Presidents\n\nâ Marvin, William T.
