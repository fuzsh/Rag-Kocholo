        "text": "The stage was being set for the emergence of American Impressionism years before the artist Henry Ward Ranger came to visit the Griswold House in Old Lyme. As early as the 1830s, Hudson River School artists were glorifying the land and its spiritual link to humanity. In the 1850s, Ralph Waldo Emerson was writing of the sacred unity found in communion with nature. On Christmas Day, 1850, an event occurred that would be remembered for its influence on the course of American art history: In a wonderful house on the main street of Old Lyme, Connecticut, Florence Griswold was born.\n\n1905\n\nWoodrow Wilson visits Old Lyme with his wife and daughters. They visit again in 1908, 1909, and 1910, staying at the Florence Griswold House. Wilsons first wife Ellen Axson Wilson enjoyed art and took lessons from members of the Lyme Art Colony. (Read more about the relationship between Miss Florence and the Wilsons on the Museums online learning guide, Woodrow and Ellen Axson Wilson in Old Lyme.)\n\n1906\n\nWillard Metcalf paints “May Night,” a moonlit view of the Griswold House. He offers it to Miss Florence to pay his bill. She refuses saying, “It’s the best thing you have ever done.”\n\n1907\n\nThe Congregational Church at Old Lyme, made famous by Lyme artists, burns to the ground. Three years later, with the help of artists and the community, the church is rebuilt.\n\n1936\n\nDue to Miss Florences failing health and deteriorating finances the Florence Griswold Association is formed by townspeople, friends, and family. Its goals are to provide for Miss Florence by purchasing and maintaining her family home and eventually operate as an art museum. However, the FGA loses the bid to purchase the property to Judge Robert McCurdy Marsh. He allows Miss Florence to live in the house.\n\n1937\n\nOn December 6, Florence Griswold dies at the age of 86, at home, in her own bed, with Dr. Griswold, artist Gregory Smith, and her favorite cats at her side—and in familiar and well loved surroundings. Within a year, her belongings are sold at auction.\n\n1955\n\nThe Florence Griswold Association and the Lyme Historical Society merge on the 100th anniversary of the incorporation of Old Lyme. In 1973, the name of the Association will be changed to the Lyme Historical Society.\n\n1982\n\nIn Open Air: A Portrait of the American Impressionists is filmed by the Smithsonian. Old Lyme: The American Barbizon exhibition is called by The New York Times: a considerable achivement, wide-ranging, scholarly and scrupulously fair…beautifully installed in the Florence Griswold Museum.\n\n2001\n\nThe Hartford Steam Boiler and Inspection Company gives its entire holding of American art — 188 paintings and two sculptures— to the Museum. The collection showcases Connecticuts importance to American art history from the late 18th to the early 20th centuries. As a result, The Museum broadens the scope of its acquisitions and exhibitions to encompass Connecticuts role in the history of American art.\n\n2006\n\nAfter 14 months of restoration, the Florence Griswold House reopens as a country retreat for artists. The $2.5 million project preserves the National Historic Landmark and allows visitors to fully immerse themselves in the culture and daily life of an American art colony unlike anywhere else in this country. The House is accurately furnished to its appearance circa 1910, when the colony was the center of Impressionism in America.\n\n2010\n\nCafé Flo opens. A partnership between the Museum and River Tavern in Chester, Connecticut, Café Flo is located in the Rafal Landscape Center with seating available in and around the building. It is open seasonally, June through September."
