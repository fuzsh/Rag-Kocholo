Others arrived at different times until 1639, when the Rev. Ephraim Huit came from England, and was settled as a colleague with Mr. Warham, at Windsor, in 1639. A part of his church came with him, viz: Edward Griswold, John Bissell, Thomas Holcomb, Daniel Clark, and Peter Tilton.

The Narragansetts had restored the two boys taken from Mr. Oldham, and made such satisfaction as had been accepted by the Englishbut no compensation had been made by the Block Island & Pequott Indians. Mr. Endicott was therefore ordered to go to Block Island and put all the men to the swordto spare the women and children, and take possession of the Island; after which to go and demand of the Pequotts the murderers of Captain Stone, Norton and others who had been murdered on Connecticut Riverto demand of them several of their children as hostages, and 1000 fathoms of wampum for damages, for the delivery of the murderers, and if refused, to take them by force of his arms. The Indians at Block Island at first resisted their landing, but at a show of their arms the Indians took to the woods, thickets and swamps, and could not be found; but the troops burnt their wigwams, destroyed their corn, broke their canoes, and then sailed for Pequott. When arrived, they informed the Pequotts the object of their visitmany gathered upon the shore, and as soon as they had withdrawn, they shot arrows at them. Endicott burnt their wigwams, killed a few of them, and returned to Boston in September, all well. The names of Endicott and Indicott are the same, as Capt. Endicott was the ancestor of Mr. William Indicott, of this city, upon the male line of his ancestryand the change has grown out of some strange fancyas it has in the name of Hurlbut, which is the original name, yet it is spelt by some of the name, Hollabird, Hollaburt and Holleburd.\n\nEly, Nathaniel Hartford, 1635a constable in 1639townsman in '44, also in '49juror in '43was in the division of land in '39.

The company appointed Mr. Winthrop not only an agent for the above named purpose, but appointed him Governor for one year after his arrival, of the River Connecticut, and of the harbors and places adjoining. Mr. Fenwick within a short time after came to the Fort (Saybrook,) but for several years did not acknowledge the territory over which he had control as strictly under the government of the Connecticut colony. Though the fort at the mouth of the river was a great protection to the river towns, against the Dutch and Indians, yet Mr. Fenwick gave great trouble to the Connecticut colony, by offering to sell not only the Fort, but all the lands of the company upon the river, to the Dutch. In 1644 an agreement was made by the Connecticut colony with Mr. Fenwick for the purchase of the fort, guns, &c.; also that all the lands upon the Connecticut River should be under the jurisdiction of the Connecticut colony. The mode of payment having failed in some measure on the part of the colonya second contract, or an alteration of the first took place in Feb. 1646, when it was agreed that the colony should pay to Mr. Fenwick, or his assigns, for the term of ten years, £180 per annumone third in good wheat, at 4 shillingsone third in peas, at 3 shillings and 2 penceone third in rye or barley, at 3 shillings per bushel, with some other considerations. In 1644 he was made an assistant. In 1642 the General Court requested Mr. Fenwick to unite with the Connecticut colony, in answering letters which had been received by the colony from some Lords in England. In 1639, Mr. Fenwick was nominated for a magistrate in the colony, and was to have been appointed the next April, provided he should then be a freeman of the colony of Connecticut.\n\nHe was afterwards a magistrate, and was an assistant in the General Court, in 1644 5-67 and 8. He was twice a member of the Colony Congress, in 1643 and 1644was also appointed on several important committees by the General Court at different times. The first few years of his residence at the Fort (Saybrook) he was not a favorite of the colony, but after he disposed of his lands and the fort to the colony, he was shewn all the honors and favors due him from Connecticut. No taxes had been paid by the inhabitants at the fort, or in Saybrook, to the colony, until after the fort and lands were sold by Mr. Fenwick to Connecticut, in 1644, as the town had been entirely independent of the colony. Many of the inhabitants of Windsor and Hartford moved to Saybrook in 1646-7. After this Mr. Fenwick was much noticed in the colony. In 1643, the object so much desired by the colonists of Connecticut and New Haven, viz. the Union of all-the New England Colonies in a General Congress was effected, and met at Boston for the first time; Gov. Haynes and Mr. Hopkins appeared there for Connecticut, and Mr. Fenwick from Saybrook, represented his own jurisdiction. Amongst the many salutary provisions contained in the Articles of Confederation of the United Colonies, it was provided, that each colony should send to their conventions two Commissioners only, who should in all cases be members of the church. At the time of the death of Mr. Fenwick, the purchase of the fort and the lands upon the River, had not been closed between the contracting partiesand was afterwards closed by his son in law Mr. Cullick, whose wife was the principal legatee of the personal property of her father. Fenwick, Mrs. Mary, was slandered by Bartlett, in 1646; for which he was ordered to stand in the Pillory during Lecture, whipt, fined £5 with six months imprisonment. This was not the day to speak evil of dignitaries. Friend, John, Hartford, 1639, an early settlerancestor of F. Humphrey, of Albany, on the female side.

He at once suspected they had murdered Mr. Oldham; he bore down upon them, and though he had but three with him, two of them boys, yet being a bold and daring man, he fired duck shot so fast and thick, that the deck was soon cleared. Some of the Indians jumped overboard, others crowded below, and some hid under the hatches; but Capt. Gallup run down with a brisk gale upon her quarter, and gave the vessel so severe a shock, that those who leaped overboard were drowned. He repeated running against the vessel twice or thrice, and upon the third shock, other Indians leaped into the water and were drowned. He then boarded the vessel, and bound two of them, and threw one overboard;two or three were in a small room in the cabin, armedwith swordsthese he could not drive out(he probably fastened them in)and he found on board the corpse of Mr. Oldham, with his head split and his body badly bruised and mangled; he cast the body into the sea, and took Mr. Oldham's vessel in tow, after stripping off her rigging, and put what few valuables the Indians had left, on board of his vessel; he set sail, but night coming on and a high wind, she was set adrift, with the Indians on board; she of course soon went to pieces- This was unquestionably the first man by the name of Gallup that came into the colony, and he proved himself a brave ancestor to those now in the country.Capt. Gallup was educated in a military school in Holland, and rumor has said he was in Holland with Major Mason, and that they were intimate friends after they arrived in this country.Colony Rec. and Dr. Trumbull.\n\nGaylord, Lay married Elizabeth Hull, of Windsor, 1646.\n\nGaylord, Samuel 1640.\n\nGibbs, Giles Windsor, 1640his children were, Gregory, Samuel, Benjamin, Sarah and Jacob.\n\nGibbs, Francis 1640\n\nGunn, Thomas Windsor, 1643juror in '41, and often afterwards.\n\nGardner, David came to the Fort at Saybrook, in 1635, and was the principal architect and builder of the fort, and buildings erected under the care of Mr. Winthrop.

In 1662, he with Thomas Tracy and James Morgan, were appointed to aid and establish the bounds of New London, assisted by the most able man in N. London, by order of court. The same year Mr. Griswold had a severe lawsuit with Reinold Marvin, concerning a large number of horses. The arbitrators awarded that one half the horses should be equally divided between them, and the other half should go to the colony, and Marvin should look them up, and appointed a committee to sell the horses and execute the award. (The arbitrators must at least have resided at Dutch Point, if they were not Dutch justices.) Mr. Griswold was the ancestor of Gov. Griswold, and many of the leading men of Connecticut, viz. Griswolds, Parsons and Wolcotts.\n\nGreen, John a freeman in Fairfield, in 1662.\n\nGilbert, Jonathan Hartford, 1635came in the first colony.

Being an elder in Mr. Hooker's church, he was as active in matters of the church, as he was in the affairs of the town and colony. In '44, as no gallery had been built in the church, he was appointed to build it, and stairs to enter it. In '39 he with Mr. Stone, deacon Chaplin and George Hubbard, were appointed by the General Court, \"to gather those passages of God's providence, which had been remarkable, since the first undertakings of the Plantations, and report them to the General Court.\" In the early part of the settlement, he was one of the most active as well as useful settlers in the colony. During the great dissension in the church at Hartford, which lasted for a considerable period of time, and caused much anxiety not only to the church in Hartford, but to all the churches in New England; for some cause about this time deacon Goodwin moved his family to Hadley, but afterwards returned into the colony, and died at Farmington in '73.
