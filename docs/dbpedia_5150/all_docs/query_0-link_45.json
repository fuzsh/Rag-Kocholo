        "text": "Ralph, son of Wimund II, Seigneur de Haye-Pensel (Paynel) assumed the St. John surname by 1054. Ralph became the 'man' of St.John at the end of the sea near Mont St. Michel in Normandy, France but he is more prominently known as Ralph de Brehal and Ralph Paynel, the Domesday Tenant, [a merge with his son Ralph Paynel, Jr.]. Another son, Thomas of St. John, is remembered in the renaming of the village to St. Jean-le-Thomas. Ralph St. John-Paynel married the sister of Gilbert d'Lacy of Stantone in Domesday, Emma de Lacy.\n\nOne of Ralph's younger sons, John St. John, I of Stanton-St. John married the daughter of Hugh Plugenet of Headington and founded the St. John family of Stanton-St. John, Lageham, Instow, Barton, Godstow, and Swallowfield in England. He is the ancestor of the St. Johns of Uchel-olau (High-light), Glamorgan, Wales, Weobley Castle in Swansea and the American Immigrants: (brothers) Mathias St. John (1601-1669), Thomas St. John (1613-1698), and Nicholas St. John (1617-1689) and their paternal cousin, Mathew St. John (c. 1578-15 Dec 1669). He is also the ancestor of the descendants of James St. John and Thomas St. John from St. Johnstown, Tipperary, Ireland.\n\nWait! What about the Dutch Santken Family?\n\nDebunking Dutch-Santken Mythical Claims\n\nSupport the St. John DNA Project & Big Y Testing\n\nSt. John DNA Testing General Fund at FamilyTreeDNA: Donate Now\n\nRules>\n\nOrthography\n\nSt. John\n\nPronounced /ˈsɪndʒɨn/ or /ˈsɪnʒən/ , as if written Sinjin or Sinjun -\n\nis an English polygenetic surname: a surname that has more than one source or origin. Our St. John surname, however, comes from a village in Normandy formerly known as “Saint John at the end of the sea,” making it a toponymical surname because it is a surname derived from a place name. These surnames originated as non-hereditary personal by-names, and only subsequently came to be family names. For the nobility of St. John, it became a marker of their social status. St. John originally included the article, ‘de,’ in French, to mean ‘of’ [the village] Saint John [at the end of the sea].\n\nEven Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) has trouble pronouncing St. John\n\nJames Bond as James St. John Smith (James Sinjin Smythe)\n\nSpelling Conventions\n\nAll phonetic variations of confirmed St. John who descend paternally from Ralph St. John are in this database as St. John or St. John-[surname]\n\nAll phonetic variations of confirmed St. John who descend paternally from Adam de Port are in this database as de Port-St. John\n\nKnown Phonetic Spellings of St. John click here\n\nSecondary St. John Surnames\n\nSeveral secondary St. John surnames have been created through the years including: St. John-Paynel, de Port-St. John, Mewes-St. John, Poynings-St. John, Mildmay-St. John, and possibly others. While this project's main goal focuses on the original St. John lineage, it does include those other paternal families that share the St. John surname.\n\nReliability\n\nThere are many false claims regarding persons of the St. John surname. Historians have confounded specific individuals with others. Articles and books often describe confusing and conflicting claims. Unsubstantiated theories have been added to research sites as legitimate records. This site attempts to fix these issues with primary records and DNA testing by identifying as many living descendants and their direct lineages as possible.\n\nCheck Out - Debunked Claims\n\nGenetic Genealogy"
