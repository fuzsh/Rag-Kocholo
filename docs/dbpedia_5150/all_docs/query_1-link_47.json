Thomas' father, John Trowbridge, died at Taunton, Somersetshire, England in July 1649 at the age of 79. Thomas, being his father's only living son, inherited substantial wealth, which is probably what kept him at Taunton, England, until his burial at St Magdelen Church on 7 February 1673.\n\nWilliam Trowbridge and his two brothers also were left at New Haven, Ct. under the care of Henry Gibbons, a servant. Gibbons mismanaged the affairs of Thomas' property. The courts put William and his brothers under the care of Sergeant Thomas Jeffery and his wife.

Homes with unpainted clapboards, narrow, unshuttered windows, and dignified doorways lines the mile-long street reflected life on the frontier 75 miles west of Boston.\n\nDuring King William's War hostilities broke out in America between the English and French and between the Iroquois Indians and the French in the area from the Mohawk to the St. Lawrence. The French struck with their Indian allies along the northern frontier with raids in New Hempshire, New York and Massachusetts.\n\nOn 26 September 1696, his wife and three of his children were killed by French Mohawk Indians. Young Daniel was sixteen, John was three and Thankful was one year old when they were killed by the Indians.

William and Richard were thirty-something; Mary was nineteen; Sarah was fourteen and Samuel was nine years old.\n\nMary Belding married at Wilton, Ct., on 19 April 1698 to James Trowbridge (as his third wife). Apparently she left Deerfield after the 1696 Indian raid.\n\nDaniel Belding and his three children were held captive in Canada until they were released in 1698. They returned to Deerfield to pick up their lives. Daniel married again, on 17 February 1699, to Hepzibah Buel (widow of Lt. Thomas Wells), who was born in 1649 to William Buel. His son, William, married in 1700 to Margaret Armes. His daughter, Sarah, married in 1702 to Benjamin Burt. Little did they know they were about to face another Indian raid - \"Deerfield - a massacre in the wilderness\".\n\n\"An ox sledge creaked under the last load of the wood, women served supper from the glowing hearths, and by nine o'clock Deerfield's 290 settlers were abed on the cold bitter night of February 28, 1704. Toward dawn the sentinel dozed at his post.\"\n\n\"Stealthily a horde of Abenakis, Caghnawagas, and French Canadians crept over drifted snow and dropped inside the palisade. Shrieking hideously, they fell upon settlers in their beds. ... Torches fired 17 houses. Leaping flames sent a vivid message, and mounted men from other Connecticut Valley settlements finally routed the attackers.\"\n\n\"They say the moon was red over Deerfield the night of the slaughter. The Massachusetts village left a smoking ruin with half its inhabitants killed or dragged off to the north. Deerfield's wretched survivors refused to abandon their wilderness outpost, and a farm village rose again, prospering from the rich soil.\" - America's History lands\n\nDaniel's second wife was captured by the Indians on 29 February 1704 and was killed enroute to Canada. His daughter, Sarah, was captured by the Indians in 1704. Daniel married a third time to Sarah Hawkes, the daughter of John Hawkes and the widow of Philip Mattoon.\n\nDaniel Belding died at Greenfield (or Deerfield), Mass., on 14 August 1732 and Sarah on 17 September 1751.\n\nGo to TOP\n\nThe 1620-1696\n\nNathaniel Foote Jr. was born in England about 1620.

Nathaniel Foote Jr. was about fourteen when his mother gave birth to his youngest sister, Rebecca, at Watertown about 1634.\n\nIn 1635, Nathaniel Foote and John Strickland, and their families, ventured out from Watertown and were among the first settlers on the bank of the Connecticut River, at Pyquag, Ct.

Samuel Smith was a tanner by trade and a dealer in skins and furs. He figured in a number of land transactions and commercial enterprises. As a result he became one of the wealthiest men at Wethersfield.

He never settled there, but his son-in-law - John Williams, settled on Dr Alcock's share in 1670.\n\nSarah Alcock died on 27 November 1665. Mary Alcock was only thirteen at the time. Her older twin sisters were fifteen and baby brother was only three. John Alcock died at Boston on 27 March 1667 and was buried at Roxbury. He left his estate to their nine children.
