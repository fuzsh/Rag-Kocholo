CONN. FOREWORD In August, 1939, Milford, the sixth oldest town in Connecticut, will celebrate the three hundredth anniversary of its founding. In preparation for this anniversary, the citizens of the town, on November 9, 1936, authorized the Selectmen to appoint a Tercentenary Committee to formu- late and carry out plans for an appropriate observance of this important event in the life of the town. Although the outstanding facts concerning the settle- ment of Milford and its history, growth and development are well known to many of the present generation, no at- tempt had ever been made to compile those facts into a historical work dealing with Milford alone. Many excellent historical sketches and papers concerning the town and its people have been written from time to time, and Milford has always had its place in the chronicles of Connecticut and of New Haven Colony, but no complete history of Milford, assembling into one volume a systematic account of events affecting the town, had ever been written and published. The definite need, indeed positive demand, for an au- thentic history, which should cover the three centuries of the town's life, prompted the Tercentenary Committee to undertake the preparation of this book as one of its first and most important projects. As a part of this Tercentenary observance, there could be no more appropriate gift for the Milford of the Present to hand to the Milford of the Future than an accurate account of the Milford of the Past. The Tercentenary Committee was fortunate in obtaining the services of the workers and writers of the Federal Writers' Project of the Work Projects Administration, first, FOREWORD to do the vast amount of necessary research workj then, to assemble the material, discriminating between fact and fic- tion j and, finally, to compose and complete this first History of Milford. The Committee expresses the thanks of the townspeople to the Federal Writers' Project for this valuable contribution to the Milford Tercentenary. Chairman of Milford Tercentenary Committee. July i, 1939. VI PREFACE On this Tercentenary, the people of Milford have reason to be proud of the length and serenity of their history. In writing this brief account the Federal Writers' Project has made use of Lambert's History of the New Haven Colony written a hundred years ago, of Barber, of Trumbull, and of the various works mentioned in the Bibliography. Mostly, however, we have followed the lines of the Town Records which constitute an unusually full and valuable body of in- formation concerning events in Milford from the time of its founding. Here in gnarled authenticity, in sometimes refrac- tory spelling, is revealed the sturdy grain of the ancestral stock. The things which they took care about in their town meetings, their interests, their judgments are matters of con- cern and precedent to their grateful descendants and to all who live in Milford and are susceptible to its traditions. There could be no more fitting act of commemoration than to remove their words from the crumbling edges of the original volumes and to publish them for the use of his- torians. Few towns can have such important material to offer the legal scholar, the historian, and the antiquarian. It is greatly to be hoped that a memorial volume may be brought forth containing the Town Records from 1639 into the 19th Century, as well as selected deeds, land records, and other documents of prime importance. If the writing of this his- tory should pave the way for such a publication, it will have served perhaps its most useful purpose. The Federal Writers' Project wishes to thank the citizens of Milford who have given us this opportunity and have helped us to live up to it. In particular, thanks are due to vii PREFACE the Tercentenary Committee, Inc., and its committee on pub- lication, who have been of all possible assistance to us in this work. The following Milford residents, under the chair- manship of the Reverend Roy M. Houghton, composed the committee on publication: Norman S. Buckingham, Fred- erick S. Gorham, Mrs. Morris W. Abbott, Mrs. C. Robert Chase, Miss Annie D. Nettleton, Mrs. H. Franklin Norton, Mrs. Frederick M. Smith. We are indebted to Mr. Paul Reilly of the Federal Art Project for his pen-and-ink drawing of the Old Academy; to the Yale University Press and Prof. Leonard W. Labaree for a map cut; and to Mr. J. Frederick Kelly, who has read the section on Old Houses and Churches. The following members of the Federal Writers' Project contributed to the making of this book: the Milford staff of C. Lay Roosevelt, Supervisor, Walter Carleton, the late Joseph B. Carroll, Byron A. Guthrie, and Louis R. Tierney; the State editorial staff of William H. Garrigus, Virgil Geddes, Iveagh H. Lewis, and Grace T. Shailer; Elmer D. Keith, architectural editor; Russell Piatt, who made the in- dex and bibliography, and Harry Terrill; William T.

The river wound through meadow and woodland, spill- ing its waters, by way of a deep, rocky gorge, into a long arm of the sea. Though not navigable above the gorge, the stream was large enough to furnish abundant water for livestock and the necessary power for turning mill wheels. A half mile farther to the east was another small stream. Their two inlets almost completely surrounded a triangular neck of land. The inlet of the Wepawaug River formed a natural harbor for more than a mile upstream, sufficiently deep to permit the entrance and anchorage of vessels. The other inlet, very shallow and at low tide a wide expanse of mud and marsh, formed the mouth of the East (Indian) River, later the eastern boundary of the settlement. The shore line with its sweep of curving beach extended west- ward from the mouth of the harbor to the Housatonic River. A long narrow peninsula at the extreme west, now Milford Point, had been for many years the site of a large Indian village and the scene of many an Indian oyster feast. The shells were scattered thickly over nearly twenty-four acres. i HISTORY OF MILFORD A mile and a half southwest from the mouth of the har- bor, an island of about fourteen acres, partly wooded and partly open meadow, rose from the sea; a rocky bar awash at half-tide connected it with the mainland. The beaches abounded with clams ; the harbor and the East River, with blue crabs j and the waters of the Sound, with lobsters and fish of many kinds. Game was plentiful in the surrounding forests. There was an abundance of both hard and soft woods — oak, chest- nut, butternut, hickory, maple, red cedar, hemlock, and elm. Wild beach plums, growing in profusion along the shore, offered fruit for preserves and jelly. Who were the first settlers in Milford? Where did they come from? During the reign of Charles I, increasing num- bers of people were migrating to New England because they were no longer willing to accept the tenets of the estab- lished Church of England, and had been persecuted by the prelates of the English Church for their non-conformity. In May, 1637, the Hector sailed from London to Boston, carrying a company gathered by John Davenport and Theo- philus Eaton of London. Five weeks later another ship arrived with a group headed by Peter Prudden, a native of Hertfordshire. Among the original Milford settlers known to be of this company were Edmund Tapp, James Prudden, William Fowler, Thomas and Hannah Bucking- ham, Thomas Welch, Richard Piatt, Henry Stonehill, and William East, all from Hertfordshire. The new arrivals stayed in the Massachusetts Bay Colony for almost a year, and were considered such desirable colonists that efforts were made to induce them to settle there permanently. Davenport and Prudden, however, desired to establish their own colony, and when the potentialities of the region at the mouth of the Quinnipiac River in Connecticut were verified by an expedition made in August, 1637, by Eaton 2 A LITTLE REPUBLIC and several others of the Davenport company, they decided that was the place to found their colony. Seven of Eaton's group stayed through the winter to hold the territory for the others. In April, 1638, Peter Prudden and a number of his followers sailed with the Davenport group from Boston, bound for the Quinnipiac. From April, 1638, to the fall of 1639, the Prudden group was a part of the New Haven Colony. A separate allotment, known as the Hertfordshire section, was granted to them. They cleared the land, built houses, and planted crops. During the summer of 1638 Mr. Prudden preached at Wethersfield, and there attracted a devoted following, many of whom wished to found a new settlement where he would be their pastor. This crystallized the movement to found a separate colony among the Hertfordshire group in New Haven. Of the original settlers of Milford, Thomas Tapping, Robert Treat, John Sherman, Thomas Tibbals, John Fletcher, George Hubbard, Richard Miles and Andrew Benton were Wethersfield recruits. Zachariah Whitman, Benjamin Fenn, and Thomas Sandford, from Dorchester, Massachusetts, and John Astwood, John Peacocke, Thomas Baker, Jasper Gunn, John Burwell, and Thomas Uffot from Roxbury, joined the Prudden group and went to the mouth of the Wepawaug. The Milford Colony was thus a settle- ment of Mr. Prudden's followers, recruited from towns in England and NevvEngland where he had preached, and held together by personal devotion to their leader. <£: Sergeant Tibbals suggested the region about the mouth of the Wepawaug River, ten miles west of New Haven, for their plantation. On February 12, 1639, Edmund Tapp, William Fowler, Benjamin Fenn, Zachariah Whit- man, and Alexander Bryan from New Haven, journeyed to the Wepawaug and purchased land from Ansantawae, a 3 HISTORY OF MILFORD sachem of the Paugusset Indians who had a village on the banks of the river. The price was six coats, ten blankets, one kettle, twelve hatchets, twelve hoes, two dozen knives, and a dozen small mirrors. The tract bought was bounded by the East River, the Housatonic River on the west, the Sound on the south, in- cluding Poquahaug (Charles) Island, and by the \"two mile Indian path that goeth to Paugusset (Derby),\" on the north. The location of the \"two mile\" path is a matter of conjec- ture.* A study of the boundaries and acreage in subsequent purchases of land for Milford indicates that the northern boundary of the original purchase was the road which today leaves New Haven by way of Fountain Street, passes through the lower part of Woodbridge, and runs west to meet the * In his History of the New Haven Colony (1838), Edward R. Lam- bert does not attempt to locate that two mile path in any way. \"The first purchase was made of the Indians on the 12th of February of that year (1639). ^ comprehended the tract of land lying between the East river and the Housatonnuc, and the sea with the Island south, and the two mile Indian path to Paugusset (Derby) north.\" In his History of Connecticut (1797), Dr. Benjamin Trumbull says, \"They first purchased of the Indians all the tract which lies between New Haven and Stratford river, and between the sound on the south, and a stream called two mile brook on the north which is the boundary line between Milford and Derby. This tract comprized all the lands within the old town of Milford, and a small part of the town of Woodbridge.\" Trumbull does not use the two mile Indian path as the boundary, but a brook called Two Mile Brook. This is a much more definite boundary, as the Two Mile Brook is still in existence, and is located in the western end of Orange. Edward L. Clark of Orange has traced the path or road as follows: \"It extended from the northwesterly section of New Haven, perhaps over what is now called Long Hill, past the house of Newton J. Peck, to a point now within the present limits of the City of Ansonia, thence in a southwesterly direction until it reached that section of Derby formerly called the 'narrows.' \" This road would go through the lower part of Woodbridge. The two mile path, according to Lambert, is used as a boundary in three different purchases of land. In the first purchase, 1639, xi 1S tne northern boundary; in the second, 1655, the eastern boundary; and in the third, 1685, the southern boundary. 4 A LITTLE REPUBLIC Two Mile Brook. From this point to the Housatonic River the brook served as a boundary. The first purchase included nearly all of the present towns of Orange and Milford, and part of the town of Woodbridge. Deeding the land to its new owners was effected with the old English \"twig and turf\" ceremony. After the customary signing of the deed by both parties, Ansantawae was handed a piece of turf and a twig. Taking the piece of turf in one hand, and the twig in the other, he thrust the twig into the turf, and handed it to the English. In this way he signified that the Indians relinquished all the land specified in the deed and everything growing upon it. The Paugusset In- dians sold the Wepawaug land in the hope that they would enlist English protection against the Mohawks, who were continually raiding their territory. Title to the region was based solely on land purchase from the Indians and not upon any grant from the English Crown. The later purchases of 1655, 1659, 1660, and 1661, rounding out the boundaries of the settlement over a period of six years, were also made directly from Indian posses- sors.* As Isabel M. Calder, in her recent History of the New Haven Colony points out, \"The hodge-podge of Indian deeds by which the greater part of the lands of the colony were held would have received no recognition outside of New England, and would never have stood the scrutiny of an English Court of law.\" Several months of planning and labor followed the pur- chase of the Wepawaug land before the settlers took actual possession of their new home. On August 22, 1639, while they were still living in New Haven, those intending to move to Wepawaug met in council in Robert Newman's barn and formed the First Church of Milford. The organ- * These purchases are referred to in an Indian deed of 1682. See Appendix. 5 HISTORY OF MILFORD ization followed the plan adopted by the New Haven Church that same day. \"Seven Pillars\" were chosen as the govern- ing body, the idea being derived from the Scripture, \"Wis- dom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars.\" The \"Seven Pillars\" of the Milford Church were Peter Prudden, Zachariah Whitman, William Fowler, John Astwood, Edmund Tapp, Thomas Welch, and Thomas Buckingham. Upon them rested the responsibility of exam- ining and passing upon the qualifications of all members. As part of the ceremony of organization, these men ap- peared before the council of the church, gave a detailed account of their religious experience, made a profession of faith, and ended by reciting the covenant, written by Peter Prudden.* The church was not only a dominating first cause for *This appears in the first book of church records in Prudden's own handwriting: \"Since it hath pleased ye Lord of his infinite goodness and free grace to call us (a company of poor miserable wretches) out of ye world unto fellowship with himselfe in Jesus Christ, and to bestow himself upon us by an. everlasting covenant of his free grace sealed in ye blood of Jesus Christ, to be our God, and to make and avouch to us to be his people, and hath undertaken to circumcise our hearts, that we may love ye Lord our God and feare him, and walk in his wayes; we, therefore, do this day avouch ye Lord to be our God, even Jehovah, the only true God, the Almighty Maker of heaven and earth, the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ; and we do this day enter into an holy covenant with ye Lord and one with another, through ye grace and help of Christ strengthening us (without whom we can do nothing), to deny ourselves and all ungodliness and worldly lusts, and all corruptions and pollutions wherein in any sort we have walked. And do give up ourselves wholly to ye Lord Jesus Christ, to be taught and governed by him in all rela- tions, conditions and conversations in this world; avouching him to be our only Prophet and Teacher, our only Priest and Propitiation, our only King and Lawgiver. And we do further bind ourselves in his strength, to walk before him, in all professed subjection to all his holy ordinances, according to ye rule of the gospel, and also to walk together with his church and ye members thereof, in all brotherly love and holy watchfulness, to ye mutual building up one another in Faythe and Love. All which ye Lord help us to perform, through his rich grace in Christ according to his covenant. Amen.\" A LITTLE REPUBLIC settlement, but also the controlling force in colonial govern- ment, education, and social life. The leaders in the church were the leaders in civil affairs. Except for allegiance to the English Crown, which did not weigh too heavily upon the Fathers, they acknowledged no authority but the word of God, and \"combined into a little republic.\" Their constitu- tion was the Scriptures. Prolonged discussions had occurred as to whether or not voting and office-holding should be confined to church mem- bers. The policy of excluding non-members from civil rights was finally adopted. The first General Court (town meet- ing), held on November 20, 1639, granted forty-four church members the franchise as \"free planters.\" Following is the list taken from the town records: Zachariah Whitman Thomas Welsh Thomas Wheeler Edmond Tappe Thomas Buckingham Richard Miles Richard Piatt Thomas Topping Mr. Peter Prudden William Fowler John Astwood Richard Baldwin Benjamin Fen Samuel Coley John Peacocke Henry Stonhill Nathaniel Baldwin James Prudden Thomas Baker George Clarke, Senr.

His son Jared was a lawyer, and located himself in New Haven. § Governor Gideon Tomlinson was a descendant of his. || He was ancestor of General David Wooster, of New Haven, who was killed at Danbury in 1777. 8 A LITTLE REPUBLIC The General Court declared: \"The power is setled in the church to chuse persons out of themselves to divide the land into Lotts, as they shall have light from the word of God, and to take order for the timber.\" The town chose five men \"for Judges in al civill affaires [who] Are to try al causes Between man and man as A Court to punish any of- fence and Sin against the commandments.\" The judges named were William Fowler, Edmund Tapp, Zachariah Whitman, John Astwood, and Richard Miles, all but Rich- ard Miles being \"Pillars of the Church.\" Until a body of laws should be established, the judges were \"to observe and Apply them Selves to the rules of the written word of god.\" With land purchased and church organized, the main body of planters migrated from New Haven in the late sum- mer or early autumn of 1639.* Lambert, who probably had access to documents which we do not possess, gives this ac- count of the migration: The body of planters moved from New Haven by land, following the devious Indian foot-path, driving their cattle and other domestic animals before them, while their household and farming utensils, and the materials for 'the common house' were taken round by water. Serg. Thomas Tibbals piloted the com- pany through the woods to the place, che having been there a number of times before.' All safely arrived, the planters erected their common house at the head of the harbor, on the west side, and a few rude huts for temporary residence. The second General Court was held in March, 1640, and the foundations of the settlement were laid. Since the settlers were in immediate need of a mill to grind their grain, the following vote was passed: * C. M. Andrews, Colonial Period of American History, vol. 2, pp. 158, 159 (note). 9 HISTORY OF MILFORD It is Agreed between William Fowler and those of the Bretheren that he shall build A Mill and A house for it and to doe all the worke to her for Stones and Iron-worke and all other Materialls fit for her: and substantially done and to be goeing By the last of September. When it is finished the towne is to take it off if they will For 1 8o£ or else the Brethren Are to appoynt what towle he shall take: compareing the profits of the Mill, and the land Allowed, with the money disbursted. In recompense, William Fowler was granted the land for a mill site on the Wepawaug River and was later given perpetual use of the stream. Mr. Fowler had taken upon himself no small task. He had to build a mill dam, erect the mill, have the iron fittings forged in New Haven, and find the proper rock from which to hew the millstones. The mill dam was built just above the rocky gorge through which the Wepawaug rushed to the harbor. The original millrace is still in existence, running under the present New Haven Avenue and into a pond which empties into the har- bor. The mill, the first gristmill in New Haven Colony, was built just to the west of the raceway, and if standing today would be in the middle of New Haven Avenue, just east of the Memorial Bridge. The town's right to purchase the mill was never exercised, but the judges did establish the miller's fees which were to be three quarts of raw grain for every bushel brought to be ground. A sawmill, built soon after on the other side of the millrace, was operated for only a short period. Throughout the spring and summer of 1640 roads were made along both banks of the Wepawaug and of West End Brook and house lots were laid out facing the roads. Forty- one plots, long narrow strips of land, averaging three acres each, were staked out on the Wepawaug, and twenty-four on 10 PLAN OF THE ORIGINAL TOWN PLOT OF MILFORD (After Lambert) a, part of fresh meadow; b, part of dreadful swamp; c. part of Eastfield common line fence; d, part of Westfield common line fence.

Each lot owner was required to build a substantial home within three years, or his land reverted to the town. The extent of each man's land was determined by the \"rule of persons and estates,\" that is, by the relative size of his estate, by the amount he contributed to the initial general expense of the colony, the number of persons in his family, and his standing in the community. On these homelots, the settlers built their first homes and barns and made their first plantings. All the expenses incident to the running of the settlement were paid by a property tax. Life in the little village during its early years was simple, though one of arduous toil. There were no extremely wealthy settlers, neither were there any who were very poor. No man asked any other man to do work which he himself was not able and willing to do. The majority were farmers, but every farmer had to be a \"Jack-of-all-trades,\" to cut his own timber and mill it, to build his own house and barn and fences, and to make many of his own tools and equipment. Practically all of the food consumed by his family was raised on his own land or obtained by hunting and fishing. There were few skilled artisans in Milford, only one carpenter, George Clark, Sr., one cooper, Nathaniel Baldwin, and one tailor, John Baldwin. Not until 1643 did a blacksmith, John Smith, join the colony. Prior to that date, all forging had to be done in New Haven. The first church services in Milford are believed to have been held in the \"common house.\" The Reverend Peter Prudden served as preacher and pastor from the time of the organization of the church in August, 1639. Mr. Prudden had previously been ordained in England as a priest of the Church of England. His ordination as pastor of the Milford church took place in New Haven, probably because Milford lacked the proper building in which to meet. He was or- dained by Zachariah Whitman, William Fowler, and Ed- n HISTORY OF MILFORD mund Tapp as instructed by the Milford church. The Reverend John Davenport, the Reverend Samuel Eaton, and the Reverend Ezekiel Cheever were present at the service. Mr. Prudden was both leader and advisor of the little flock, taking a keen interest not only in affairs of the church but in everything that concerned the life of the community. There is no record that he ever received a salary. The people raised and gathered his crops and carted his firewood. He paid his taxes and, though exempt from regular military duty, kept his arms and ammunition in good order. Extensive commerce with other ports was not developed until later in the century, but trade with the Indians dates from the earliest days of the settlement. One colonist was quick to capitalize on the value of the furs received in trade. \"In 1640, Ensign Bryan sent a vessel to the Bay (Boston) laden with beaver, otter and other precious furs and in re- turn brought back such goods as were needed by the planters for their own use and for trade with the Indians.\"* The third General Court met on November 24, 1640. Up to this time the cluster of dwellings had been called \"Wepowage\" from the Indian name of the river that flowed through the village. It was now voted to change the name to Milford and adopt as the official seal of the Colony the letters \"JVF.\" The need for a meeting-house for religious worship was urgent, so the Court instructed the five judges to let out and build a meeting-house thirty feet square \"after such manner as Shall be Judged most convenient for the publique good.\" Following the lead of New Haven which had adopted a standard of weights and measures to prevent the use of short weight by unscrupulous traders, the Milford court adopted * \"Alexander Bryan of Milford, Connecticut, his ancestors and his de- scendants,\" By Charles Candee Baldwin. Cleveland, Ohio, 1889. 12 A LITTLE REPUBLIC the standard in use in New Haven and appointed Jasper Gunn, the town's first physician, sealer of weights and measures. A fine of five shillings was imposed for selling or buying from an unsealed measure. The administration of the five judges had been so satisfactory that, with one excep- tion, they were again chosen to act in the same capacity until the following October. John Sherman was chosen to suc- ceed Richard Miles. Although the river was not navigable, it was too deep to cross except by fords, of which there were many. The cross- ing was easy for riders on horseback or in wagons, but the slippery \"stepping stones\" made it difficult for those on foot. During spring freshets the stream was not fordable. The Court, therefore, instructed the judges \"to consider in what place, and after what manner, a bridge may conveniently be made over the mill [Wepowage] river, and let it out to be don with convenience and Expedition.\" A site for the church had already been selected about one hundred and fifty feet south of the present church building at the junction of West Main and West River streets. Nearby was a small island, suitable for the location of bridge piers. The bridge afforded easy access to the church for those living across the river, and successive bridges at this point have been appropriately called \"Meeting House Bridge.\" In 1 64 1 a young surveyor of uncommon ability, Robert Treat, was called upon to assist in the laying out of the land. He was destined to become one of the most colorful and prominent figures in the affairs of New Haven Colony and later of Connecticut. The original grant of homelots sufficed only for the first year or two, while the settlers were occupied clearing the land, building homes and barns, and raising crops. Soon a further division of land was demanded, and twice before 1 643 additional grants were made in the outlying sections of 13 HISTORY OF MILFORD the purchase. The original plan of allotting acreage in pro- portion to a settler's wealth and importance was again fol- lowed. As all of the land was not equally desirable, the lots were \"sized\" according to value ; if a piece of land were rocky or a long distance from the homelot, the settler who received it was given a larger portion than the man who received a piece of well-watered, easily accessible bottomland. A map of Milford for this period would show the rectangular strips of each man's land-holdings scattered here and there about the settlement. In this manner, two tracts, called Eastfield and West- field, lying southeast and southwest of the village center, were allotted. The next division covered other lands south of the homelots and other sections to the north and east. A large tract of meadow, south of Westfield, called the Great Meadow, was also apportioned among the settlers and en- closed by a common fence. Each landowner was compelled to keep up that part of the common fence which bounded his land. Each section was marked with a landowner's initials on an end stake and a penalty of two shillings sixpence was imposed for failure to keep this initialed stake in place. The owner of a section of fence was required to repair any break within sixteen hours or pay a fine of five shillings. Certain designated individuals built and maintained gates instead of a specified footage of fence. Early in 1641 the building of the meeting-house was begun. It was a two-story frame building, forty feet square, with a four-sided peaked roof, topped by a small tur- ret. The structure was framed of huge timbers, and covered with clapboards. The single door was on the west side of the building. An aisle led to a high pulpit, in front of which was a place for the ruling elder. Below this, just behind the communion table, were seats for the deacons. Crude 14 ] 1 w# South View of First Meeting House and Ground Plan A, the pulpit; B, deacon's seat; C, D, guard seats; E, gallery stairs. Robert Treat House Jonathan Law House A LITTLE REPUBLIC benches, each accommodating four or five persons, stood on either side of the aisle. Long benches flanked the side walls, and there were short seats on either side of the pulpit. No provision was made for heating the church in winter, except individual foot-stoves filled with live coals before the parishioners left home. As in other Connecticut churches of the day, there was no church bell. Rolling drumbeats called the settlers to church and to town meetings. The long, tedious Sunday services, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, afforded a chance to exchange pleasantries and gossip. As outlying sections were settled, those who came from a distance brought lunches and spent the recess between morning and afternoon services visiting with their neighbors. During services, guardsmen in butter- nut-dyed homespun, wearing knee-breeches, long woolen stockings, and buckled shoes, with powder horn and bullet- pouch slung over their shoulders, and matchlock muskets in hand, were seated near the door, prepared to repel Indian attacks. There is little on record about schools in the first few years. Higher education was important chiefly as prepara- tion for the ministry. Ministers, usually the best-educated men in a colonial community, served as teachers. Jas- per Gunn, credited with being the first Milford school teacher, in 1642 conducted a school at his house, near the \"common house\" at the head of the harbor j he was assisted for a time by the Reverend John Sherman. In comparison with other towns Milford suffered few attacks from the Indians. The Milford Indians were friendly, but the Mohawks were so hostile that the planters lived in constant dread of them. In 1624 the Dutch had settled at New Amsterdam, and in 1633 had established a trading post on the Connecticut River at the present site of Hartford. The Dutch continued to claim all the interven- 15 HISTORY OF MILFORD ing land after the English were in possession of the territory. There were many disputes and minor clashes between the Dutch and the English and their Indian allies over the own- ership of the region. To guard against surprise attacks from the Indians, and to be ready in the event of armed conflict with the Dutch, palisades, ten to twelve feet high, were built around the homelots, and for further protection the settlers organized a train band. The band, commanded by Captain John Astwood, was composed of every able-bodied male citizen between the ages of sixteen and sixty. Members were required to train six times each year, or oftener, at the discretion of the authorities. Every male citizen over sixteen was ordered to have in readi- ness \"a pound of powder, and two pounds of bullets or shott, and two fathoms of match, for a matchlock, on penalty of 5s. a month for such default.\" Drastic regulations stipulated that It is likewise agreed that no man shall either give or trucke with any Indian powder, shott, pistolls or any sort of gunns, sword, daggers, rapier, Iron Brass, or any other weapon or Ammunition as alsoe gold Silver, upon the paine of five pound loss and if any under goverment either Child or Servant Shall without their parents or master knowledge brake this order shall be liable to the whipp or any other sentence of the court. For some time settlers in Massachusetts and Connecti- cut had urged the formation of an alliance of Massachu- setts Bay, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven Colonies, in order that they might more effectively resist Indian attacks and present a united front against the claims and encroach- ments of the Dutch. In May, 1 643, this confederation of the New England colonies was consummated. Each colony kept its separate identity and government, but was bound to help 16 A LITTLE REPUBLIC the other members of the confederation in case of attack or invasion. Milford was still a separate colony and not included in this confederation. The majority realized the advantages of joining the larger, stronger colony of New Haven and thus securing the protection of the New England Confederation. The town therefore applied for consolidation, but difficulties arose over the question of the franchise. The town had given full privileges in civil affairs to six persons who were not members of the church. This liberalism shocked the stricter Puritans of the New Haven Colony, and they refused to permit Milford to join with them, unless the six non- churchmen were disfranchised. Milford refused. A com- promise was finally reached, whereby the six were allowed to keep their civil rights in purely local affairs and to vote for deputies to the General Court at New Haven, but were not permitted to vote for magistrates or to hold office \"for the Combination.,, Milford also agreed to admit only church members as freemen in the future. Under this agreement Milford sent deputies, William Fowler and Edmund Tapp, to the General Court at New Haven on October 27, 1643, and thus voluntarily ended its existence as an inde- pendent colony. 17 Chapter Two MILFORD IN NEW HAVEN COLONY i 644-1 665 During its first four years Milford developed from a wilderness, inhabited by wild animals and Indians, to a healthy, thriving village. The settlers had built dwellings, mostly of the \"lean-to\" type, with rent oak shingles and diamond-pane windows.* The church, the backbone of every New England community, had been organized, the meeting- house raised, and Peter Prudden ordained and installed as pastor. Trade was established, mostly coastwise to the east- ward, although a few voyages are reported to have been made to far-off Virginia. The Fowler gristmill was busily engaged in converting the harvests of corn, buckwheat, and rye into flour and meal. The town founders welcomed newcomers to the com- munity, but they were careful to see that only those who had the proper qualifications were admitted. Applicants for residence had to present credentials of good character and godly life. They were required to join the church and to possess sufficient property to insure the town that they would not become public charges. Once admitted, the newcomers were granted land on equal terms with the other planters. The early settlers were mostly farmers. Their first can- 't1 This is Lambert's description of the early houses. Probably only the better houses had glass in their windows at this time. The earliest houses built by the pioneers had oiled paper in place of glass for windows. 18 MILFORD IN NEW HAVEN COLONY cern was to provide food for the community. As more land was cleared and the planters managed to produce a food surplus, artisans were in demand to meet other requirements of the town, and they were encouraged to come to Milford. Since the town was without anyone who knew the art of dressing skins and hides, Edward Adams was urged to learn the tanner's trade and to follow it in Milford j as an induce- ment, he was granted on March 1 6, I 646, two acres of land in Mill Neck, with a proportionate piece of meadow land. In December, 1652, Henry Tomlinson, a weaver, made ap- plication for a homelot so that he might settle in the town and follow his trade. In return for agreeing to set up a weaver's shop, the town granted him a plot of land from the \"elders' lot,\" with the proviso that if he should move away, he would surrender it to the town. He was also granted some farm land. A second tanner, Miles Merwin, set up his business in Milford in 1654, the town granting him an acre of land on the west side of Dock Lane, next to Alexander Bryan's warehouse. Fowler's Mill continued to hold a prominent place in the simple economic life of the town. In the fall of 1645, when a freshet partially destroyed the mill, the town, realiz- ing what a loss this meant to the community, voted at a meeting held on December 22: . . . that all the town shall help Mr. Fowler to repair the mill, and he is to call for them everyone a day, till he have gone through the towne and these he is to have when he needs. If it goeth not thorow the town in one year the same is granted him till he hath gone through the towne. The only gristmill in New Haven was destroyed by fire in 1 662 j during the rebuilding, the farmers brought their grain to Fowler's Mill. Milford soon developed a thriving trade for so small a 19 HISTORY OF MILFORD village. Alexander Bryan and his son Richard, the town's first merchants, who had been engaged in fur-trading with the Indians from the beginning of the settlement, carried on a rapidly growing commerce with Boston, New York, and the West Indies. The elder Bryan's reputation and credit standing was so high that his notes of hand passed as cur- rency in Boston. He is said to have had as large a business as any merchant on the American coast outside of Boston. In May, 1650, the town granted Alexander Bryan a plot of land for a warehouse site at the head of what is now Fac- tory Lane. He erected a building, sixty feet long by twenty feet wide, on the west side of the lane at the corner of Broad Street. At the same time he built a wharf at the foot of the lane where his ships took on and discharged their various cargoes. In October, 1653, he offered to relinquish all right and title to the wharf, provided the town kept it in repair. The town accepted the offer and for many years this was the public wharf. On December 13, 1655, the town granted Richard Bryan leave to build another warehouse, thirty by eighteen feet, near his father's. Sergeant East also was permitted to build a warehouse between Ensign Bryan's and the house of Miles Merwin, the tanner. These items indicate not only a grow- ing trade in Milford, but also that the town regulated such details as the size and location of buildings to be erected. The planters experimented with new crops. Charles Deal requested and received permission from the town, March 17, 1657, to purchase Poquehaug or Milford Island (Charles Island) from Richard Bryan, who had acquired the island from George Hubbard to whom it had been originally allotted. The town specified that he must use the island only for tobacco-raising, that he should not \"sell or truck with either Indians, English or Dutch nor suffer any disorderly resort of meetings of seamen or others there.\" This is one 20 MILFORD IN NEW HAVEN COLONY of the earliest recorded instances of tobacco-raising in Con- necticut by white men. The venture was a failure. Local prohibition of trade with the Dutch resulted in the arrest in April, 1654, of Captain John Manning, charged with \"trading with the Dutch and furnishing enemies of the Commonwealth of England with provisions.\" Trumbull relates the story with some detail: One captain Manning, master of a ten gun ship, had been apprehended for an unlawful trade with the Dutch, at the Manhadoes. While the affair was up- on trial before the court at New-Haven, his men ran off with the ship from Milford harbour. The people completely armed and manned a vessel, with so much dispatch, that they pressed hard upon the ship before she could reach the Dutch island. The men, perceiving they must be taken, unless they im- mediately abandoned the ship, made their escape in their boat. The ship, thus left adrift, was recovered, and brought into Milford harbour, and, with all her goods, condemned as a lawful prize. The Court at New Haven found Captain Manning guilty, fined him twenty shillings and costs, and ordered that his ship and all her goods be sold at public auction in Milford on \"Tuesday next\" at three o'clock in the afternoon. \"By an inch of a candle he that offers most shall have her, and that the price as it shall fall, shall be paid in Beef, Pork, Wheat, pease, of each a like quantity, all of it good and merchant- able and at current price as it goes at time of Payment.\" All the costs of seizure and auction were paid out of the proceeds of the sale, and twenty shillings was awarded to each Milford man who had taken part in the ship's capture. In one instance the early Milford settlers resorted to agricultural control measures. A town meeting held No- vember 27, 1645, \"ordered that the major part of any quar- 21 HISTORY OF MILFORD ter may make agreements between themselves for the Sowing of their crops, And the minor part to yeeld unto what they so agree, Or to bear all damages that may be by their decenting (sic).\" Raising hops for yeast and ale was another agricultural experiment. On April 22, 1652, the town granted Edward Worster \"a peece of land up the Mill River about an acre or an acre more or less for an hopp garden which peece of land the town gave to the said Edward Worster according to his desire therein.\" An early record shows an attempt at conservation of natural resources. So much timber had been destroyed by a fire set by the Indians in 1646, that by 1655 the planters feared a shortage of building material. Upon Information given to the court of the great ex- pense of timber ... It is ordered therefore that no man that is not either a planter or A Covenant Servant for a year within the town of milford shall not here- after fell any timber or make any Improvement Being felled for either pipe staves heading barrel staves or Shingles under the penalty of ten shillings fine to the towne of Milford for every tree. Economic development through this period depended upon territorial expansion. When the first tract was pur- chased from the Indians, it seemed large enough for many years to come. But increase in population, together with an insistent demand for greater acreage, made necessary addi- tional purchases from the Indians, and further divisions by action of the town. A fourth division in 1 646 granted to the planters all the land that was still available. In 1655, when the demand, \"more land,\" was again heard, Mr. Fenn, Ensign Bryan, Sergeant Baldwin, and Sergeant East were appointed to act as agents in the purchase of additional territory. On June 22 MILFORD IN NEW HAVEN COLONY 10, 1655, they bought from the Indians, for five pounds, the region between Paugusset and the \"two mile path,\" giving the town more acreage to the north. By 1659 tne popula- tion had increased to over five hundred, and again there were demands for more land. Robert Treat and Ensign Bryan negotiated with the Indians for the tract lying between the Indian River and the New Haven line, and extending from the New Haven-Derby path on the north to the Indian path to Oyster River on the south, and purchased it on December 20, 1659, for twenty-six pounds in goods. In 1660 Indian Neck, lying between the Indian River and the Sound, was bought, the Indians reserving twenty acres for planting ground, agreeing \"to defend the land, with the swamps, timber, trees, and all the privileges, from the claims of any Indian whatsoever.\" This twenty-acre reservation was bought from Ansantawae and his son on December 12, 1661, for six coats, three blankets, and three pair of breeches. The town then sold it \"by an outcry\" for twenty-one pounds six shillings to Thomas Welch, for whom the point was named. This established Milford's territorial bounds as they are to- day, with the inclusion of the present town of Orange. The local Indians were granted the right to fish in their old waters, and protection was promised for Chief Ansantawae and his family. Constant disputes over the boundaries of the grants made to the settlers accompanied the rapid division of the land of the community. \"Boundary fixers\" were in constant de- mand. To clear up the confusion, in 1646 the first map of the town was made, showing the location of each homelot, the name of the owner, and the number of the lot. In the same year laws were passed regarding the sale and transfer of property. Owners were forbidden to sell or transfer land to anyone not a resident, without first filing the name of the prospective buyer. If the sale was not approved within 23 HISTORY OF MILFORD twenty days, the town was required to buy in the property. Residents were allowed to transfer land among themselves without restriction. On December 24, 1646, it was ordered by the General Court that every transfer of property, whether by sale, gift, or inheritance, should be recorded in a special book. The fee for recording the transfer was to be twopence, and two- pence for a copy of the deed. Two months was the time limit allowed for recording a land transfer, with a fourpence penalty for failure to comply with the law. A report of land transfers was made by the recorder at each meeting of the judges, so that proper tax assessments could be levied. The record for December 24, 1646, reads: . . . and he who is appoynted to enter the afforesaid lands, or Meadow, shall give into the next particular court, after such Allianations Exchanges or gifts, a copie of such allianations, exchanges or gifts, as have been before, that accordingly the court may levie, or dispose such rates as are due upon the right and proper owner of the land, from time to time, and may cause the treasurer to require, that which is Just upon every man . . . Thus the early court of five judges was not only the first board of selectmen, as the body is known today, but also the first board of assessors. Communication between Milford and other colonies was usually by way of the old Indian trails. Within the town, instead of first laying out roads, and then apportioning land with reference to the roads, the land was laid out first. The planters then made their own paths or wagon tracks to meet their needs, using Indian trails as much as possible. Broad Street was originally forty rods wide, with the land between it and the harbor left in common as a drill ground for the train band. While the opening up of roads and paths was 24 MILFORD IN NEW HAVEN COLONY left largely to the planters to suit their own convenience, in one instance the town took a hand in the matter. On Febru- ary 7, 1643: It is Agreed that a footway to the meeting house (shall be alowed and mayntayned with Convenient Stiles) from the west end. The Stiles to be main- tayned by bro: Nicholas Camp at the west end, and by bro: Thomas Baker at the meeting house for the outside Stiles, and for the Inward fence each man shall maintayne their severall Stiles in the most con- venient places. The building of more bridges across the lesser streams and the establishment of a ferry across the Housatonic River facilitated communication. When Milford joined the New Haven Colony, there was but one bridge across the Wepa- waug River, the \"Meeting House Bridge.\" At certain times of the year the journey to the mill was difficult for those living in the West End. To benefit these planters, Fowler built a wooden bridge over the river on the site of the present Memorial Bridge. The town assumed responsi- bility for maintenance of the bridge in 1648. Beyond the Indian River lay the section of land pur- chased in 1659. Planters in this region found the Indian River impassable at high tide. In 1662 the building of the Indian or Great Bridge on the BurwelPs Farm road made the region more accessible. Beyond the Housatonic River to the west, a settlement, Cupheag, later named Stratford, was founded in September, 1639. On May 18, 1648, Roger Ludlow, in behalf of Moses Wheeler of Stratford, petitioned the General As- sembly for a charter to operate a ferry between Milford and Stratford. The next court sitting at Fairfield granted the request, and the ferry started in 1649 or 1650 with a flat-bottomed scow for the transportation of animals and a 25 HISTORY OF MILFORD canoe for foot-passengers. The fare was a halfpenny for a person and twopence for a horse or beast. Milford had no part in the operation of the ferry for many years. To improve communication between the towns of the New Haven Colony, on May 25, 1653, tne General Court ordered that: twelve horses shall be kept in the five townes in this jurisdiction that are upon the maine, vizd: foure at Newhaven, two at Millford, two at Guilford, two at Stamford & two at Brandf ord j with sufficient furniture for travell, and to bee allwayes in a readines as the publique occasions of the cuntry may require j and for the hire of the horses, the owner shall have from Newhaven to Connecticote tenn shillings, from Mill- ford to Stamford ten shillings, from Newhaven to Millford two shillings eight pence, or foure pence a mile, according as it is usually accounted. The charge of keeping the horses is left to every towne to con- sider j the hazard of the horse to be upon the owner, but the charge of hiring men, whether messengers or others, to bring horses backe againe, to bee at the publique charge, as the authority of the place from whence they are sent shall agree with them. By 1645 the \"common house,\" which was still used for town meetings, was not large enough to accommodate all who were entitled to attend. In that year a larger structure was erected on approximately the site occupied by the present municipal building, and was called the \"East Town House.\" This building was used not only for town meetings, but also for the sessions of the first public school. After the erection of the new town hall, the \"common house\" became guard quarters until June 22, 1648. Then it was sold for twenty- one shillings to James Rogers for use as a warehouse. The church strengthened its organization by the election of two new officers. Zachariah Whitman, one of the \"Seven 26 MILFORD IN NEW HAVEN COLONY Pillars\" was \"pitched upon\" as presiding elder of the church in January, 1645. On January 26 he was ordained with solemn ceremony by a council composed of the elders and messengers from the churches of New Haven and Strat- ford. The office of deacon went unfilled for a time because the church could not decide between Benjamin Fenn or George Clark, Jr. Fenn was finally chosen and installed in 1647. In 1646 the Indians went on the warpath and tried to burn down the town by setting fire to the countryside. For- tunately the settlers managed to check the fire at the swamps that lay to the west and north before any damage was done to the palisades, but much valuable timber was destroyed. After this evidence of Indian hostility, sentries were posted along the entire line of palisades. Each household was required to furnish one watchman, who did sentry duty every fifth day. The planters did not venture outside the pali- sades, except in armed parties. While at work on the farm one of the men would stand guard against a surprise attack. In spite of the hostility of the Indians there is no record of any fatalities in Milford at any time due to Indian attacks. Nevertheless, the whole colony of New Haven lived in con- stant fear. In the summer of 1648 the Mohawks, who had been quiet for some time, attacked the Milford Indians in an at- tempt to capture their fort on the Housatonic River, but were driven off with heavy losses. The story goes that one of the settlers had sighted the invaders hiding in a swamp about a mile from town, and had warned the Milford Indians that the Mohawks were waiting to make a surprise attack on the fort by night. Thus prepared, the Milford Indians were able to meet the Mohawks with such war whoops and volleys of arrows that the enemy fled, leaving behind many dead and several prisoners. 27 HISTORY OF MILFORD One of these Mohawk captives was tied to a stake on the salt meadows and left to die. He was found unconscious the next morning by Thomas Hine, who released him, fed him, and put him ashore on the other side of the Housatonic River. For this act of mercy the Hine family were ever after venerated and respected by the Mohawks. It is a tribute to the hardiness of the settlers, and perhaps to the skill of Dr. Jasper Gunn, that there were no deaths in the community for the first five years. The first death, that of Solomon East, the year-old son of William East, occurred on June 18, 1644. The first death of an adult was that of Sarah, wife of Nicholas Camp. \"She had twins on the second of September, 1645, and was doing well till the night of the fourth, when she was taken very ill with a cold. She died on the sixth (being the last day of the week) in the morning and was buried the evening after, in the garden of Mr. Peter Prudden, Pastour.\" Mr. Prudden's garden, used as the first burying ground, was situated about a hun- dred feet east of the former residence of Samuel L. Bald- win now the home of Dr. DeWitt B. Nettleton on Prospect Street. John Astwood, one of the original \"Seven Pillars\" and one of the first five judges, died in 1654 while in En- gland on a mission for the colony. The town was deeply grieved in July, 1656, by the death of its beloved pastor, the Reverend Peter Prudden, at the age of fifty-six. For almost seventeen years he had been the leader and advisor of the little flock. Cotton Mather paid the pastor a tribute which has been inscribed on a tablet, erected in the Church of Christ in Milford by Prudden's descendants. Peter Prudden — Founder and Pastor of this Church from its establishment in 1639 till his death in 1656. I am sure 'tis a blessed child of God whose name is before us 5 who besides his other excellent qualities 28 MILFORD IN NEW HAVEN COLONY was noted for a single faculty to sweeten, compose, and qualify exasperated spirits, and stop or heal all contentions — whence it was that his Town of Milford enjoyed peace with truth all his days. He continued an able and faithful servant of the churches until the 56th year of his age when his death was felt by the colony as the fall of a pillar which made the whole fabric to shake. The First Church of Milford remained without a settled pastor from the time of the death of Peter Prudden in 1656 until 1660. The congregation finally agreed upon the Rev- erend Roger Newton of Farmington, who was \"received\" July 29, 1660. Of his ordination it is recorded: Aug. 22 of the same year, he was ordained Pastour with praise and fasting and ye layeing on of ye hands of Zach. Whitman, Elder, John Fletcher, Deacon, and Mr. Robert Treat, Magistrate — though not as magistrate and deacon, but as appointed by ye church to assist ye Ruling Elder in ye layeing on hands in ye name of ye church. The town government kept a regulatory finger upon the tavern and inn, where travelers and their mounts sought accommodation and townsmen gathered of an evening to discuss affairs over a mug of ale. Milford had been without a tavern until June, 1654, when Henry Tomlinson, the weaver, made application to the judges for permission to open an \"ordinary.\" The town was both willing and anxious to grant the request, but neither Tomlinson's house nor its location was suitable for the venture. On West Main Street, then the main road through the town, was a house near the present \"Grey Court\" apartments owned by Richard Bryan that was better situated for the purpose. Tomlinson opened the tavern late in 1654, but his inn- keeping was not to the satisfaction of the town. He served 29 HISTORY OF MILFORD meagre and unappetizing meals and overcharged his cus- tomers. Furthermore, he allowed the young people of the village to congregate there to dance and play cards. In 1655 the town sold the property back to Richard Bryan and William East, with the understanding that they maintain it as a tavern. Since Tomlinson refused to give up the prop- erty, claiming it as his own, a court order was necessary be- fore he could be evicted. This non-conformist community was sympathetic to Cromwell's rebellion and gave protection to two of the regi- cides, William Goffe and Edward Whalley. After the Restoration they had fled from England to escape arrest and execution, arriving in Boston on July 27, 1660. When it became dangerous for them to remain any longer in Massachusetts, the two left secretly for New Haven, arriving there March 7, 1661. The Reverend John Davenport wel- comed them and hid them in his house until April 30. In May agents with warrants for their arrest left Boston for Hartford and New Haven, arriving in New Haven on May 13. Warned by friends, the regicides took refuge in hideouts near New Haven, moving frequently to escape capture when the search came too close. The most famous of these hide- outs was Judge's Cave on West Rock, which sheltered the men from May 1 5 to June 1 1 . During the summer of 1661 the people in New Haven who had harbored the regicides became uneasy about pos- sible dangers to the Colony because of their defiance of royal orders, and Whalley and Goffe went to Milford on August 19, 1 66 1. Here they were given shelter by Micah Tomp- kins in his home on West River Street, on the site now occupied by the High School. A bronze tablet marks the spot where the house stood. Their secret was kept so well that for more than two years only a few of the townspeople were aware of the 30 MILFORD IN NEW HAVEN COLONY regicides' presence. Benjamin Fenn knew their secret and was friendly to them. He was one o£ the two delegates from New Haven to the New England Confederation. When the commissioners of the Confederation offered a dec- laration at their meeting of September 5, 1661, urging a thorough search for Whalley and Goffe, and the punishment of their protectors, Fenn stayed away and refused to sign the declaration. The regicides remained in Milford until July, 1664, when they were again forced to flee; this time to Hadley, Massachusetts. In 1662 Charles II conferred a charter upon the Con- necticut Colony, with its General Court at Hartford, grant- ing it all the territory of the New Haven Colony. This led Connecticut to claim jurisdiction over its neighboring Colony, and to invite all the towns within it to send deputies to the General Court of October 9, 1662. All but New Haven, Branford, and Milford accepted. Milford wished to join the Connecticut Colony, but New Haven and Bran- ford bitterly opposed the union. The Reverend Davenport of New Haven and the Reverend Pierson of Branford were \"jealous that a union would mar the purity, order, and the beauty of their churches and have an ill influence on the civil administration,\" and used all the power at their command to block the proposed consolidation. Officially, New Haven still had jurisdiction over all the seceding towns and resisted the Connecticut claims to them. The struggle that ensued lasted almost two years. When Robert Treat was elected magistrate from Milford to the New Haven General Court on May 25, 1664, ne refused the office because he was in favor of union with Connecticut. On March 12, 1664, King Charles granted his brother, the Duke of York, all the recently acquired Dutch settlement at New Amsterdam and most of the territory involved in the dispute between Connecticut and New Haven. On July 20, 3i HISTORY OF MILFORD 1664, four royal commissioners with extraordinary powers arrived in Boston to inquire into the affairs of the New En- gland Colonies, threatening their self-government. New Haven and Branford still held out against the union with Connecticut which would have strengthened both colonies in any resistance to royal encroachments. At this point Milford grew impatient at the delay and, through the efforts of Benjamin Fenn and Robert Treat, severed all ties with the New Haven Colony and united separately with Connecticut. After months of further negotiations between New Haven and Connecticut, the differences of the two colonies were finally adjusted, and on May 11, 1665, New Haven gave up its independence and merged with Connecti- cut. By this act New Haven abandoned its adherence to the principle of absolute union of church and state. The ecclesiastical character of civil government was modified. Property rather than church membership became the basis on which the franchise was granted. 32 Chapter Three MILFORD IN THE CONNECTICUT COLONY i 666-1 783 Milford in 1666 was an extensive township stretching nearly fourteen miles north of Long Island Sound, but with the community center still behind the palisades. Dwellings sprawled along the banks of the Wepawaug River and West End Brook, the little church sheltered a goodly multitude on the Sabbath, and the East Town House served as a public school. The town boasted three bridges, many miles of rough roads, a tavern, and several commercial establishments for preparing grains, hides, timber, and the necessities of life. Alongshore, wharves, warehouses, fish pounds, oystermen's huts, and heaps of shells testified to the industry of the plant- ers who had found treasure in and beyond the sea. Dissatisfaction was voiced by some men who had not approved of Milford's union with the Connecticut Colony, or who were displeased with the division of lands. These Milford residents had twice sent Captain Robert Treat to New Jersey to negotiate with the Dutch governor for a prospective settlement site. Accompanied by Ben- jamin Fenn and Deacon Gunn, the Captain was taken on a tour of inspection on the Governor's private barge to examine the harbor now known as Newark Bay. In the spring of 1 666 Captain Treat and thirty pioneers from Mil- ford, Connecticut, sailed into the Passaic River and settled at Four Corners, later called Milford. The Yankees bought practically all of the lands now included in Essex County 33 HISTORY OF MILFORD by giving the Indians 50 double hands of powder, 100 bars of lead, 20 axes, 20 coats, 10 guns, 20 pistols, 10 kettles, 10 swords, 4 blankets, 4 barrels of beer, 10 pairs of breeches, 50 knives, 20 horses, 1,850 fathoms of wampum, 6 ankers of liquor, and 3 troopers' coats. Milford, New Jersey, was christened Newark in 1 667, in honor of the English home of the Reverend Abraham Pierson, of Branford, who was the spiritual leader of the party. Robert Treat was the prime mover, not only in the found- ing of Newark but also in all phases of its early develop- ment. He played a leading role in the life of the town until 1672, when he returned to Milford where he had retained his property. Several of his children remained in Newark and took a prominent part in the affairs of that community. A statue of Treat, erected by that city, stands on his original homelot there. Before his departure for Newark, Robert Treat had served Milford in many capacities — as its first surveyor, one of the five judges, captain of the train band, deputy to the General Court at New Haven, and later as magistrate of the Colony. When Winthrop secured a charter for Connecticut from Charles II in 1662, Treat, whose father and brothers-in-law were named as patentees, vigorously advocated the union of New Haven with Connecticut and refused election to the General Court at New Haven. After his return to Connecticut from Newark he was again active in Milford affairs and became one of the most distin- guished men of the Colony. Appointed a major in the colonial militia in 1 670 and a colonel in 1 674, Treat was in command of the Connecticut forces in King Philip's War, and was second in command of all New England troops. His forced marches, resulting in timely arrivals at Spring- field and Hadley, turned rout to victory and are credited with having saved those towns from destruction.

' .\\ '; Robert Treat Tablet MILFORD IN THE CONNECTICUT COLONY Great Swamp Fight near Kingston, Rhode Island, where 3,500 Narragansett warriors were concentrated within the Indian fort, Treat's men assisted by Mohegan Indians gained entrance to the fort from the rear, opening the way for the assault of the Colonial troops. Of the 4,000 warriors and squaws within the fort only 200 survived. Thereafter Treat served the Colony as governor and deputy governor for a period of thirty-two years. While governor, his tactful and shrewd delays and evasions of Andros' demands helped to preserve Connecticut's rights. When the impatient British Governor-General finally ar- rived at Hartford to demand that the charter be surrendered, it was Treat who courteously pleaded at such length that darkness fell, giving his associates an opportunity to extin- guish the candles and whisk away the charter. Despite his occupation with colony affairs, Treat was con- tinually relied upon for guidance by his townspeople. He was frequently called upon to act as executor, trustee or appraiser and his name appears on the majority of land records between 1672 and 1700. Again and again he was called upon to settle boundary disputes between various towns and asked to arbitrate between ministers and dissatis- fied parishioners. Robert Treat died July 12, 1710, and is buried in the Milford cemetery. The Indian fort on the Housatonic, which had been at- tacked by the Mohawks in 1648, was burned down by boys in 1 67 1. This wanton destruction angered the friendly Milford Indians, who protested to Benjamin Fenn and Robert Treat asking for redress. The guilty boys were ar- rested and fined ten pounds in the General Court at New Haven. The Indians rebuilt the fort, complained that as they had sold all of their lands they had no place to live and to hunt, and asked the white men to set aside a place for them. One hundred acres at Turkey Hill, in the western 35 HISTORY OF MILFORD part of North Milford, on the Housatonic River, were thereupon reserved for the exclusive use of the Indians. Ephraim Strong, Esq., Joseph Woodruff, Esq., and Colonel Benjamin Fenn were appointed to look after the land and to see that it was not encroached upon by outsiders. Milford's part in the Indian wars was slight, but the train band was kept in fighting trim to meet possible attack and to furnish aid to other colonies when called for. Com- pulsory military training was enforced by means of numerous fines and penalties. Many men found that the drilling in- terfered with other occupations and would gladly have evaded the irksome duty. Though none of the battles of King Philip's War in 1675 were fought in Milford territory, Milford men were mustered in the Connecticut quota. Following this war the townspeople ceased to feel the need of palisades, and Mil- ford had little trouble with the Indians until 1700, when two houses were fortified — Prudden's house in the cen- ter of the town and George Clark's house in the West End. The settlers on BurwelPs Farms had \"liberty to fortify a place among themselves.\" On March 15, 1704, the Gen- eral Court in New Haven passed the following ordinance: It is ordered and enacted by this court that the civill and military commission officers of each town shall take all due care concerning the friend Indians be- longing to their towns, and assign them their limitts to the intent that none of them be exposed or the enemies escape under the pretense of being friends and that the said officers do strictly charge said friend Indians not to move out of their respective limitts or bounds assigned them without order in writing under the hands of such officers as they tender their own safety and at their perill and all friend Indians are hereby forbidden to hold any communication with or harbor or conceal any of the enemy Indians, requiring 36 MILFORD IN THE CONNECTICUT COLONY them to seize and secure all such as may come among them, and to deliver them up to justice, and for their encouragement they shall have ten pounds for every enemy Indian they shall so seize and deliver up. In May of the same year the Court decreed that For the encouragement of our forces, gone or going against the enemy, this court will allow out of the publick treasury, the sum of five pounds for every man's scalp of the enemy killed in this Collony, to be paid to the person that does the service over and above his or their wages and the plunder taken by them. When Captain Kidd, the pirate, cruised up Long Island Sound in 1699, according to legend he put in at Milford at about seven o'clock one evening, strode up the street, and boldly kissed a young lady. A letter found in the garret of one of Milford's oldest houses records this unexpected visit. ^y Aunt Prudence has told you of the visit from Capt. Kidd, from the craft wh. was seen to come in the har- bour at 7 of the clock in the evening. He stayed in the house till in the early morning and sat all the night by the fire with Jacobeth and Thomas Welsh carrying himself in an uncivil and bold manner. I told Aunt Prudence that he will come to trouble in the sinful way, wh. he has done, — for Zachariah Whit- man has told us all about him. I asked Jacobeth the next day if that Robert Kidd was to come in the town of Milford any more — for noe one will have him in this plantation. I want to tell you, cousin Thankful, what he did: when he came in the room he put his arms about my waiste, and kyssed me, wh. made Jacobeth laugh and Thomas Welsh cough. Jacobeth says that Capt. Bob is not so bad as the folks say, and that he was a little wild. But Aunt Prudence will not hear any good word spoken of him whatsoever, and has told Thomas Welsh what she 37 HISTORY OF MILFORD heard about him. I overheard Jacobeth say that Kidd was going on a long cruise, and that he had left some things with him. I am going to tell Aunt Pru- dence all about it, and find out what they are. . . . Your cousin, Patience Tuttle. During the last quarter of the seventeenth century and to the end of. the colonial period, Milford was still primarily an agricultural community. The thrifty Milford farmers had horses, cattle, pork, beef, mutton, flour, and corn meal, as well as furs obtained in Indian trade, barrel and pipe staves and fish to ship away in exchange for sugar, rum, and molasses from the West Indies, manufactured goods from England, and wines from France. The well- protected harbor was navigable for the good-sized vessels which tied up at the wharf to load and unload. The need for ships in which to carry these goods made Milford a busy shipbuilding port. The first shipyard was built just east of Fowler's Mill, where the sloping banks provided a suitable place for building and launching. An- other shipyard was later established between Factory Lane and the present Town Wharf, and still another on the banks of the Housatonic River near the ferry at the foot of Oronoque Road. The first ship on record to be built and launched in Mil- ford was a 150-ton brig, constructed for Richard Bryan in 1690 by Bethuel Langstaff. In 1695 Langstaff built a brig for Elisha Bennill of Boston. Richard Bryan added another vessel, the Sea flower, to his fleet in 171 7. From that time until 1820 many ocean-going and coast- wise ships were constructed for Milford, New York, and Bos- ton traders. In 1762 the Sarah Ann, a 35-ton schooner, was built and launched by Jonas Green, captain and owner. The 57-ton sloop Sea flower and the 20-ton schooner Nancy built and launched in 1763, the 45-ton schooner Easter which slid 38 MILFORD IN THE CONNECTICUT COLONY down the ways in the local shipyard in 1764, the 18 -ton sloop Betsey, and the 18 -ton sloop Sea flower, all belong on the list of ships known to have been built and launched in Milford. During this period more than forty vessels, most of which were Milford-built, were owned and sailed by Milford skippers. Interest in shipbuilding brought about an early attempt at conservation of Milford's natural resources. The timber used in the construction of the vessels was cut in the sur- rounding forests. To protect the supply the town voted on March 2, 1696, to prohibit ... all and every man from getting any sort of timber usefull for the building of any sort of boats or vessells fitt to goe to sea in, without the consent of the town or the major part of the sellectmen of the town, . . . this above order not to extend to those vessels upon the stocks. Richard Bryan and William East, business partners, both with warehouses on Dock Lane, still held their positions as the town's leading merchants. They owned two brigs and a sloop making regular trips to Boston and the West Indies. Business prosperity attracted new merchants, among them John Maltbee. In 1696 Mungo Nesbitt made application to become a resident of the town, was accepted, settled here and opened a trading business with New York. In 1714 Samuel Clark purchased Richard Bryan's warehouse, and continued to carry on the business. Peter Pierett, a wealthy Huguenot, built a wharf on the site of the present town wharf about 1730, and a few years later gave it to the town with the provision that it be kept in repair. One of his vessels returning from Bordeaux with a cargo of wine was wrecked in Fisher's Island Sound. This is the only record of a vessel lost by a Milford merchant, although a number of seafaring men who sailed from Milford lost their lives 39 HISTORY OF MILFORD at sea. Another merchant, John Gibbs, opened a commercial trade with Holland in 1 73 1 . One of the adventurous spirits of this period was Peter Pond, born in Milford on January 18, 1740. He early listened to the song of the bugles when in 1756 a few British survivors of Braddock's unfortunate adventure were quartered in the village and recruited colonials for the expe- dition against Crown Point. Young Pond enlisted, received a regimental coat, bounty money, and was forbidden to ap- pear at his home again. Fortified by gingerbread and small beer, the young adventurer left for the Lake George and Champlain country by way of the Hudson Valley, cam- paigned for a year, experienced severe hardships, and re- turned to Milford in 1757. Again in 1758 some 18,000 British and provincial troops were in the field against Ticon- deroga, and Peter Pond signed on for the campaign and fought French and Indians with the ferocity of a trained frontiersman. He was present at the slaughter of one war party of five hundred Frenchmen, witnessed the defeat of the British by an inferior force, but survived the disastrous campaign and returned to Milford. In 1759 another expe- dition against Fort Niagara was recruited; no Connecticut troops were included, but Pond repaired to Long Island and enlisted with the New York contingent. After this cam- paign the lad again returned to Milford where he passed the winter. Veteran Pond received a commission in 1760 and joined the army at Oswego under General Amherst. The following year the adventurer made a voyage to the West Indies, returning to Milford to find that his father had gone to Detroit on a trading expedition and that his mother had died of a fever. For three years Pond remained in the little village, the only three years that he had spent in one place since his sixteenth birthday. Restlessness and desire for ad- 40 MILFORD IN THE CONNECTICUT COLONY venture again possessing him, he went to Detroit, traded for six years in many parts of the country, fought a duel, went into the West Indies trade, shipped up the Mississippi and the Missouri, traded in the Great Lakes region, and retraced his steps back to Lake Champlain and Montreal. Trader, organizer, explorer, Peter Pond's formation of a pool with Henry Cadotte and Joseph and Henry Frobisher in 1783 was his greatest exploit. This pool was the initial unit of the powerful Northwest Fur Company, comparable to the East India Company in financial strength and influence. Pond left the pool in 17875 the Hudson Bay Company absorbed the Northwest Fur Company in 1824. Peter Pond died March 6, 1 807. Together with trading and shipbuilding, other business activities in Milford expanded and became more varied until weaving and fulling of cloth, tanning of hides, brewing, harness-making, tailoring, building, blacksmithing, and coop- ering were among the well-established industries. To meet growing needs, on September 29, 1674, the town authorized the building of new mills. It was propounded to the town by Major Treat, Elder Buckingham, Lieut. Fowler, and Thomas Hays to build a Fulling Mill and Saw mill in the Most Con- venient Place near the Island in the Town and to have the Liberty to make use of all sorts of timber for the use of the Inhabitants of the Town, and that if they sell any sawen Timber out of the Timber it shall be of Timber taken upon their Own ground or purchase of other men — which was Granted to them by the Town. On May 27, 1689, permission was granted to Timothy Baldwin, Captain Samuel Eells, and Samuel Couch to erect another fulling mill on Baldwin's property. This mill was built on Beaver Brook in the western part of the town, 4i HISTORY OF MILFORD near the site of the reservoir of The Milford Water Com- pany. These fulling mills were necessary because the home- spun cloth of the time was loosely woven. The process of \"fulling\" was devised to wash away the grease and to thicken the material after weaving. The finished product was much superior in appearance and wearing qualities to the rough homespun that was produced by the hand looms. On December 7, 1702, the town ordered Robert Treat, Elder Buckingham, Lieutenant Fowler, and Thomas Hayes to erect a gristmill near their fulling mill, and to provide two sets of stones, one for English and one for Indian grain, also a \"good boult\" so that the men of the town could bolt their own flour. They selected a site at the rear of the town house, on the bank of the river. On Rose's Mill Road, about a half mile from the New Haven Turnpike, on East or Indian River, are the remains of a mill that was built in 1707 by John Plumb, Sr. The first of several mills built on this site was a gristmill ; in authorizing the building of the mill, the town required that Plumb complete the structure in twelve months and that he build a good causeway over the river \"for foot, cart and horse, and to be always maintained in good repair.\" Milford's only tide mill was built at the mouth of the Indian River just north of the present Gulf Bridge. At a meeting of the voters held February 18, 1714, the town granted the privilege of using the stream to any inhabitants who, within a period of eight days from the date of the vote, would sign their names to a copy of the grant. There were several provisions embodied in the franchise: the mill to be built within twelve months j the cost of erection to be borne proportionately by the subscribers ; the grain of Milford inhabitants to be ground before that of outsiders ; and any damages to the highway or meadows adjoining the Indian River to be made good. About forty names were signed to 42 MILFORD IN THE CONNECTICUT COLONY the grant and the mill was erected, but it never was a pay- ing investment. Oystering did not develop as an industry until about 1752. In that year some fifty oystermen lived through the winter at Milford Point in small huts banked with seaweed. The industry was considered of sufficient importance for the town to pass a law in 1763 which imposed a penalty of one pound, \"lawful money,\" on anyone taking oysters from Mil- ford waters between April and September. Those who were sick, however, were permitted to take oysters out of season, provided they obtained special permission to do so from a committee appointed to enforce the oyster laws. In 1767 the fine for taking oysters out of season was raised to five pounds, and at the same time the use of a rake or tongs was made unlawful. In 1768 the exclusive right to plant and take oysters in a limited area in Indian River was granted to \"certain persons.\" Fishing, especially in the Housatonic River, was an in- dustry of importance. A dispute between Stratford and Mil- ford over fishing rights in the Housatonic River was carried to the General Assembly in 1768, when Milford petitioned the Assembly to grant a certain section of the river for a fish- ing place to Israel Curtiss and others. Milford did not differ much from the rest of New En- gland in its attitude toward hired labor. There were a few negro slaves, and some indentured servants — persons who sold their services for a period of years, usually for passage money from England ; but these two sources of cheap labor were never used as generally in New England as in the southern colonies. Marked class distinctions were not notice- able j everybody worked, and the social life of the town was democratic. Labor was scarce and wages relatively high. The housework was done by the women of the family, and farming by the landowners and their families. 43 HISTORY OF MILFORD Milford grew rapidly during the latter part of the seven- teenth century. Prior to 1666 only the Deacon George Clark house had been built outside the palisades. Others soon followed Deacon Clark's example. Samuel and Nathan Burwell, in 1690, started the settlement known as Burwell's Farms 5 in 1700 Richard Bryan, Jr., settled in North Mil- ford, beginning a settlement that for years was called Bryan's Farms j in 1705 Joseph Wheeler settled to the north in the district still known as Wheeler's Farms. The town popula- tion had increased to about 800 by the beginning of the eighteenth century, and was 1,633 m r75^- One of the old houses still remaining in Milford was built in 1750 by Garitt DeWitt, a rich merchant of Dutch extraction, who was so confident that the town would \"build up\" rapidly that he refused to put windows on one side, because he thought that \"soon his neighbors' dwellings would close up the view.\" A line on an attic window pane of this house reads: \"Patty Pond made a hoop-skirt in this room, 1782.\" The East Town House or Town Hall, built in 1645, had become so dilapidated after eighty-nine years of service that a new and larger hall was erected in 1734. According to tradition, one night in the winter of 1757-8, when British soldiers were drinking and carousing in the building it caught fire and burned to the ground. The British govern- ment paid an indemnity of fifty pounds, and the money was applied toward constructing a new town house, the third in the history of the village. A town record of December 10, 1759, tells the story: The Town agreed and voated to lay out the fifty pounds granted by the Government to buld a Town House. The town agreed and voated that Mr. John Harpin Junr Should buld the Town house so far as the above 44 MILFORD IN THE CONNECTICUT COLONY sd fifty Pounds Shall go. Mr. Harpin is to have no reward for his Troble. Agreed and voated that Mr. Robert Treat & Capt Joseph Woodruff should be a Committee to direct Mr. Harpin in the bulding of the Town house & to inspect his Acounpts and to curtail the Same if they think them to be Unreasonable. Three new taverns were licensed during this period. John Camp opened the second \"ordinary\" in 1705 in a building on West Town Street. On the corner of West Main and High Streets stands an old house, gray from exposure to the weather and almost hidden from view by the large trees that fill the yard, which is credited with being the third tavern or \"ordinary\" in Milford, opened by Samuel Miles in 171 0. Ini76i Peter Hepburn, ferryman, was granted the right to keep a public house and tavern at the ferry. From that time until the building of the present Washington Bridge in 191 9, there was always a tavern at that location. With town expansion came a demand for more bridges and roads. One over the Wepawaug was built in 1723. The town voted, December 9, 1723, \"that there shall be a cart bridge over the pond from the point of land by John Fowlers to Samuel Oviatts.\" According to Lambert this bridge was located a short distance to the south of the Epis- copal Church, crossing the river to a point called Blue Rock. Construction of two bridges, one over the Mill River and the other over the East River, was voted December 10, 1764. The Town agreed and voated that they wold have a Bridge bult ove the Mill River in the parrish of Amity in the Country Road from New Haven to Derby below Major Allins Saw Mill provided these Conditions be fulfiled that Major Allen Give the Sawing all the plancks for sd bridg and that sume 45 HISTORY OF MILFORD other person or persons Give all the timber for sd bridg and do the work of sd bridg by Highway Worke. Further attention was given to the need for bridges in January, 1768: Agreed and voated by the Town that the Serveyers Should buld a bridg a crosse the Guile that runs be- tween the bridg against Capt Fenns and the Lain by Jehiel Bryans in the Most Convienant place. Agreed and voated by the Town that they would have a foot Bridg bilt a crosse the River against the House formerly belonging to John Baldwins in the Most Convenient Place. A new layout of the road from BurwelPs Farms to Oyster River, \"right where the path now goeth toward Oyster River,\" was ordered in 1750. In 1756 the selectmen were ordered, \"with others to assist,\" to lay out a highway to the Oyster Banks at Stratford Point (Poconoc or Milford Point) at the mouth of the Stratford or Housatonic River. The General Assembly, in October, 1723, granted Zachariah Baldwin of Oronoque, in the township of Strat- ford, \"liberty to set up a ferry at the said Oronoque, being about four miles northward of the ferry called Stratford ferry. The fare shall be the same as Stratford Ferry.\" The landing on the Milford side of the river was at the point where Oronoque Road goes down to the river bank. As early as 1674 the town had taken the first step to- ward establishing a ferry house and boat on the Milford side of the Milford-Stratford ferry, when it sequestered forty acres of land for the purpose. The house was not finished until 1 76 1, although repeated attempts were made in the intervening years to complete it. On December 10, 1759, a tax of a halfpenny on the pound was levied and collected 46 MILFORD IN THE CONNECTICUT COLONY \"on all the poles and ratable estates\" for \"finishing the ferry house.\" A boat was provided in 1759, Peter Hepburn being the first Milford ferryman. The fare to be charged was set by the General Assembly, as follows: \"Man, horse and load, four pence j led horse, two pence ; footman, two pence j ox or neat kine, five pence j hog, one penny j sheep or goat, one half penny.\" It was about 1772 that the first New York to Boston stagecoach, carrying mail and passengers, stopped at Milford. The arrival of the stagecoach and the delivery of the mail at the inn was always an important event in the quiet life of the town. From the earliest days funds for town use had been raised by a tax levied in proportion to the property ownership of the residents. In addition to taxation, Milford had a novel source of public revenue — the profits from a large flock of sheep owned by the town. The flock, numbering sometimes as many as fifteen hundred, was cared for by hired shepherds and pastured on \"common land,\" since sheep-grazing had proved ruinous to the pasture lands. To preserve the \"com- mon land\" for cattle grazing, a special allotment two miles wide was made on January 11, 1675, as an exclusive pasture for the sheep. The town records having become worn and fragile after ninety-six years of handling, it was decided in 1736 to have them transcribed by John Fowler, Town Clerk. The town desired that only those things that the clerk \"might think necessary and proper\" be included in the transcript. The result was the loss of some records. This may have seemed trivial at the time; but these lost records would now be of great value to historians. A curfew law in 1759 instructed the sexton to toll the bell at \"nine o'clock o'nights.\" This local law was adopted 47 HISTORY OF MILFORD because of an act passed by the General Assembly which inv posed a severe penalty upon any person found after nine o'clock at night in a house where strong drink was sold, and a more severe penalty upon the owner of the house. Milford women sometimes held town office. In January, 1768, it was Agreed and voated by the Town that the widow Rebeckah Clark the profites of that Pound which Leiut. George Clark bult in the westend of the Town So Long as She Shall Keep the Same in Repare So that it answers the End for a pound. The first ordinance relating to public health was passed in 1774, when smallpox broke out, and a pest-house, eighteen by forty feet, was ordered built. Whereas the Small Pox is at Present in this Town and many persons are with it infectioned and the in- habitants are put in great Fear . . . Voted, to keep a constant watch around ye infected places at this Description and to punish all disorderly persons leav- ing without leave first obtained by the Authority of Selectmen aforesd. Price-fixing to combat profiteering was adopted in 1777. Under date of March 27, Milford citizens voted, \"that we do agree to abide by and Strictly to adhere to the Law of this State that Regulates the Prices of the necessaries & Conven- iences of Life, & that we will Prosecut every Breech thereof.\" One of the town's problems that steadily became more important was provision for a school system. As early as 1696 an appropriation of thirty pounds was made from the treasury to support a school the entire year. The matter was left in the hands of the selectmen who were instructed to provide an able teacher. As the existing schools taught only the rudiments, a desire for more advanced instruction led 48 MILFORD IN THE CONNECTICUT COLONY the town on December 27, 1697, t0 appropriate thirty-five pounds ... to maintain a Latin School if it can be attained and the matter of a school and the providing of a school master is left to the Selectmen to act therein on the advice of the Honorable Governor and the Revd. Mr. Samuel Andrew and to see that the school is daily attended by a good master and by scholars that need learning. Expansion to the westward by 1699 made necessary a school in the west end. The schoolhouse was erected on Beaver Road west of the present site of the Seven Gables Inn. The school in the east end, or the center of the town, was maintained throughout the year and the one in the west end during the winter mo"
