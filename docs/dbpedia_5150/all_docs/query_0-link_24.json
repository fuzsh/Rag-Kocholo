        "text": "II EBENEZER SEAMORE AND HIS ASSOCIATES\n\nEarly in the eighteenth century a new and fertile field was opened to counterfeiters. As Roger Wolcott put it, \"in 1702, the Massachusetts put out bills of credit to pay their public debts; this was followed by the other New England governments. Connecticut came into it in 1709.\" 1 The Connecticut authorities had had a taste of what they might expect to befall their paper money, for on August 10, 1704, at Stonington they captured Thomas Odell, who had been concerned in forging the twenty shilling bills of Massachusetts and for whose capture the governor of that province had offered a reward of £30. 2 The criminal promptly broke jail and fled to Philadelphia , where he was taken up and forwarded to Boston . There he was finally delivered into the hands of the law, after having once escaped and been recaptured at Newport while in transit. He was tried on November 6 at the Superior Court of Judicature in Boston , was convicted and sentenced to pay a fine of £300 and costs and to spend one year in prison. Nine years later he was again in the Boston jail on the charge of counterfeiting but escaped and apparently was not retaken despite the offer of a reward of £30 for his capture. 3\n\nTo protect its new bills against the machinations of such rogues as Odell the Connecticut Assembly in May, 1710, passed a law to this effect: Be it also enacted by the authority aforesaid, and it is hereby enacted, That such person or persons as shall be convicted before the courts of assistants of counterfeiting any of the bills of credit created by the aforesaid acts, or confirmed, ratifyed and made good by this present act, shall pay all damages that shall accrue thereby, to be adjudged and awarded by the said court, upon conviction as aforesaid, and suffer six months imprisonment, and such other penalty, or corporal punishment, as the said court (respect being had to the degrees of such crime,) shall judge meet, or inflict; one moiety of the said fine to the publick treasury aforesaid, and the other moiety to him or them as shall in the said court sue for the same and prosecute his suit to effect. 4\n\nThe first person to suffer the penalties prescribed by this law was Ebenezer Seamore of Farmington . On June 10, 1710, Joseph Shepard of Hartford showed to William Pitkin, assistant, a Connecticut 3s. bill altered to 10s., which he had lately received from Seamore. Pitkin at once issued a warrant for Seamore's arrest, and the same day the suspected counterfeiter was taken up and brought before Pitkin, who proceeded to examine him. The prisoner pretended innocence, though admitting freely that he had paid out a 10s. bill to Shepard the previous day. He explained that he had lately received bills of the treasurer, of Thomas Burd, of George Kilborn, of George Stillman, of Constable Sam Woodruff and of Josiah Woolcott. He admitted that he had tried to pass one 10s. bill to Mr. Dod, who said it was counterfeit, and that he then showed it to John Woodruff, who thought it genuine. It was possible, he granted, that this was the same bill that he paid to Mr. Shepard.\n\nThe next day, however, Seamore was examined again and then broke down, making the following confession: he had been at expense in court and, being in want of money, he decided to try his hand at counterfeiting. Thereupon he approached his cousin, John Woodruff of Great Swamp in Farmington , who at first cautioned him against the business and expressed the opinion that it was a cheat. Finally, however, they went to work, turning a 2s. bill into a 40s., a 5s. into a 40s., a 2s. into a 20s. and a number of other small bills into 10s. each. Woodruff, it seems, altered only two or three bills, then became penitent, tried to dissuade Seamore from passing further altered notes and put off none himself. Seamore acknowledged himself alone to be at fault in the matter and added that he had passed the following counterfeits: one of 10s. to Mr. Stillman, a 10s. and a 20s. to the wife of John Curtiss, Sr., one of 10s. to Thomas Moore, one of 40s. to Mrs. Allyn, one of 40s. to Jonathan Bidwell, one of 10s. to Captain Williamson, one of 10s. to Joseph Shepard and one of 10s. to Symon Chapman ( Plates I-II), while he still had at home one of 10s.\n\nPitkin at once caused John Woodruff to be apprehended on June 18. The next day the prisoner made a full confession, stating that sometime in the spring Seamore came to him and showed him two bills which he, Seamore, had altered \"when he was a dressing Shingles.\" The two men then tried to alter a 10s. bill to 20s. but could not make it do, whereupon Seamore tore out the figures he had written and put off the bill to Mr. Judd. Later on Seamore came again to Woodruff's house and, learning from Mrs. Woodruff that her husband was in the lot, Seamore came to him there with a number of small bills on which he had already scraped out the figures, and the men made a 40s. bill out of a 10s. note. Still later Woodruff remonstrated with his cousin about the counterfeiting and refused to have any further part in the business.\n\nAs it appeared to the county court that one or more of the counterfeited bills had been burnt by Zachariah Seamore of Hartford , Zachariah was summoned and questioned about the matter. He admitted that on the night of June 17, at the desire of his brother, Richard Seamore, he had gone to the house of Ebenezer, searched among his bills of credit and, finding one that was counterfeit, burnt it.\n\nOn June 24 warrants were issued to summon the witnesses against Seamore at the court of assistants to be held in Hartford on Monday, June 26, at ten in the morning. These evidences were Jonathan Hollister, the wife of John Curtis, Sr., George Stillman, all of Wethersfield , John Hollister, Jr., of \"Glassenbury ,\" Symon Chapman and his wife, Thomas Moore, Widow Elizabeth Allyn, all of Windsor , Zachary Sandford of Hartford , Mary Wells and Edward Dod. In addition Zachariah Seamore was required to attend to answer to whatever might be objected against him relating to the bills of credit.\n\nAt the session of the court the Queen's Attorney charged Ebenezer Seamore, husbandman, with counterfeiting and passing. Seamore pleaded not guilty but was tried, convicted, and, on the following day, was sentenced to spend six months in prison, to pay a fine of £25, costs of £14/14/7 and prison fees and charges, while the keeper of the jail was instructed to secure him in irons. John Woodruff, who volunteered to turn Queen's evidence, was accepted as such, admitted his guilt, stated that he had burned the two bills he altered. Orders were given that he be not indicted, and he was discharged on payment of costs of £6/15/– and prison fees and charges. Zacharias Seamore was let off with the payment of costs of 50s. 5\n\nEbenezer Seamore found the Hartford jail anything but comfortable and his fine and costs more than he cared to pay, so after a few months he petitioned the Assembly to release him and to abate his fine, requests which were denied on October io. 6 As it was, his punishment was not severe enough to lead him to mend his ways, as will be seen later.\n\nNaturally persons to whom he had passed altered bills had suffered loss, and on March 9, 1711, the governor and council ordered the secretary, Caleb Stanly , to reimburse some individuals out of the fine paid by Seamore. They were Richard Lord, who was to receive 40s. for a 2s. bill altered to 40s. ( Plate III) and Mr. Eliot, who was granted 10s. for a 2s. bill altered to 10s. 7 Similar reimbursements were made by Stanly on March 27, 1711, as follows: to Elizabeth Wilson for a 2s. billaltered to 10s., to Symon Chapman for a 3s. bill made into a 10s., to Thomas Moore for a 3s. altered to 10s., to Joseph Shepard for a 3s. bill altered to a 10s., to Zachariah Sandford for a 2s. bill altered to a 10s. ( Plate IV), to Elizabeth Allyn for a 5s. bill altered to 40s., to John Curtis, Sr., for a 3s. bill altered to 10s. and a 2s. bill altered to 20s., to Elizabeth Marshall for a 2s. bill altered to 10s. and to Captain Joseph Whiting for a 2s. bill altered to 10s. 8 Joseph Shepard not only recovered his ten shillings but also in October, 1712, was voted by the Assembly a reward of £3 for informing against Seamore. 9 Of the notes altered by Seamore six have been preserved, those passed to Lord, Moore, Shepard, Whiting, Sandford, 10 and Symon Chapman. 11\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1\n\n\"Memoir Relating to Connecticut,\" Connecticut Historical Society Collections 3 (Hartford : The Connecticut Historical Society, 1895), p. 332.\n\n2\n\nRichard LeBaron Bowen, Rhode Island Colonial Money and Its Counterfeiting (Providence: Society of Colonial Wars, 1942), pp. 8–9.\n\n3\n\nIbid., 9 and Kenneth Scott, Counterfeiting in Colonial New York (New York: The American Numismatic Society, 1953), pp. 11–12.\n\n4\n\nCol.

In May, 1711, the Assembly took steps to rectify this situation, and a law was passed to the following effect: Be it Declared and Enacted by the Governour, Council and Representatives, in General Court Assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That whosoever shall presume to Forge, Counterfeit or Utter, any Bill or Bills (Knowing the same to be False and Counterfeit) of the Tenour, or in Imitation of any of the Bills of Credit of this Colony, or of the Bills of Credit of the Provinces of the Massachusetts-Bay , New-Hampshire , New-York, Rhoad-Island , and the New-Jersies, that now are, or hereafter shall be, by the Law Established, either in this Colony, or either of the aforesaid Provinces; or that shall Counsel, Advise, Procure or in any ways Assist in the Forging, Counterfeiting, Imprinting, Stamping or Signing, of any such False Bills; or Engrave any Plate, or Make any other Instrument to be used for that purpose, every person or persons so Offending, being thereof Convicted before any of the Superiour Courts in this Colony, shall suffer Six Months Imprisonment, and such other Fine, Penalty or Corporal Punishment, as the said Court (Respect being had to the degree of such Crime) shall Judge meet or inflict: The said Fine to be to the Publick Treasury of this Colony: And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That whosoever shall make Discovery, and give Information of such Vile, Wicked Practises, of Making, or Knowingly putting off any False and Counterfeit Bills, so that the person or persons guilty thereof, be Tendered to Justice, and Convicted; every such Informer shall have and receive, as a Reward for his good Service therein, the Sum of Twenty Pounds, to be Ordered out of the Publick Treasury; and to be Re-payed into the Treasury out of the Offenders Goods or Estate, so far as that will extend, by Order of the Court where the Conviction shall be. And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That every person Convicted of Altering or Increasing, the Sum of Figures set and expressed in any of the aforesaid Bills of Credit; or Forging or Counterfeiting, any Name, Hand, Stamp or other private Mark, that are, or may hereafter be Ordered to be made or set thereon, shall be Punished for either of the Offences aforesaid, in the same manner as is provided by Law, for the Punishment of Forgery; and be further Sentenced by the Court before whom the Conviction is, to pay Treble Damages to the Parties Injured thereby. And it is further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That the Last Paragraph of an Act made May the Eleventh, One Thousand Seven Hundred and Ten; Entituled, An Act for the better Regulating and giving a more Effectual Currency to the Bills of Publick Credit; (which Paragraph respects the Punishment of such as Counterfeit the Bills of Credit on this Colony) be Repealed; and it is hereby Repealed accordingly. 1\n\nWilliam Barker and Samuel Munn\n\nEarly in January, 1712, William Barker and Samuel Munn, who were thought to have come together from Okinoke to Milford , were at Mr. Richard Bryant's house, where Munn paid the reckoning. Both men passed altered bills of credit, and on January 8 a complaint against Barker was made to John Ailing, assistant, at Guilford , who at nine o'clock that evening ordered a hue and cry after Barker, who was said to be a trader from Rhode Island and was thus described: \"of red hair, a well made portly man, black wigg, light collourd loose Coat, dark Colourd straight Coat, speckled vest dark Colourd stock Stockings washt leather Breeches who is Charged with ye Crime of Counterfeiting or altering a five Shillings bill of this Colony to five pounds ...\"\n\nThe object of the hue and cry was apprehended at Lyme the next day and was taken before Captain Ely, J.P., of that town, who, after examining the prisoner, ordered the constable of Saybrook to take him to New Haven . On the road Barker broke away but was soon retaken and brought again before Justice Ely. The magistrate now ordered the captive's portmanteau searched, and in Barker's pocket-book were found three counterfeit bills, one of 3s. made into £5, one of 3s. altered to 20s., and one of 2s. raised to 10s. ( Plates V-VI).\n\nThis paper money was sealed up by the justice, and the criminal was sent off again under guard to New Haven , where he was examined by Warham Mather, J. P. It was discovered that Barker had stopped at a tavern in Killingworth , at Eastchester and at the house of Abraham Chanker, to whom he had passed a counterfeit 10s. bill to pay a reckoning of about ⅛. He likewise had uttered to Tavernkeeper Stiles in Milford a counterfeit 10s. Connecticut bill, no. 3931, which is preserved in the Connecticut State Library. 2\n\nJustice Mather and John Ailing committed their prisoner to the jail in New Haven on January 11 but three days later, as was reported by Sheriff Joshua Hotchkiss, Barker broke prison and made his escape despite a vigorous pursuit, in the course of which three men set out from Branford in the hope of overtaking the fugitive, Seth Morse and John Hoadly to Guilford and Jacob Carter to Killingworth , all under the supervision of Constable Isaac Foot. 3\n\nBarker's acquaintance, Samuel Munn of Woodbury , was not as fortunate as his companion. At Milford on January 7, 1712, Samuel Eells, assistant, acting on a complaint lodged by Samuel Stone of that town, issued a warrant to Deputy Sheriff Gideon Buckingham to arrest Munn. Stone charged that on the morning of January 7 at the house of Edward Wilkinson in Milford Munn offered a Connecticut 5s. bill altered to £5 to Wilkinson, who refused it, and then to Samuel Clark, Jr. About nine or ten o'clock John and Samuel Stone arrived and together with Wilkinson pointed out to Munn that the bill was altered. Munn told them that he had received it from Samuel Hawley, Sr., of Stratford and that he would go at once to Stratford to induce Hawley to take back the bill.\n\nMunn was apprehended the same day that the warrant was issued and he was examined before Justice Eells and Jonathan Law, J.P. At first he told the magistrates that he got the counterfeit bill from \"old Mr. Samll Hauley,\" who, he explained, owed him £5 and sent the money by Jonathan Stiles to Francis Stiles, who delivered it to him (Munn). He intended, in case he could not pass the bill in Milford , to destroy or burn it. Finally, however, he confessed that he had bought the bill for 40s. from a stranger from Long Island at Mr. Richard Bryant's house.\n\nMunn was bound over to the next Superior Court to be held at New Haven on the second Tuesday in March but was released on bail provided by Daniel Munn and Ephraim Warner. His sureties brought him into court, where he was indicted for having on January 5 altered a 2s. Connecticut bill to 10s. and passed it to John Camp of Milford ; also for having on January 7 altered a 5s. Connecticut bill to £5 (Plate VII) and passed it to Samuel Clark. The witnesses against him were Sergeant John Camp, Edward Elberton, mariner, Edward Wilkinson, Samuel Clark, John Stone and Gamaliel Prime. He pleaded not guilty, was tried, convicted and sentenced to be imprisoned for six months and to pay a fine of £45. The informer against him was granted the reward of £20 established by law. 4\n\nBarker, doubtless encouraged by his escape, continued his career of crime but on November 15, 1717, made the mistake of passing a counterfeit 20s. bill of Rhode Island to Captain John Raymond, Jr., in Norwalk . Raymond quickly detected the cheat and sent his son after Barker, while he himself hastened to make a complaint to Major Peter Burr, J.P., of Fairfield .\n\nThe suspected counterfeiter was soon seized and, when he was searched, two more false 20s. Rhode Island bills were found on him, as well as three 5s. Connecticut bills, a half crown Connecticut bill, three 10s. Boston bills, one 10s. Rhode Island bill and one 5s. and one is. Boston bill. At his examination before Major Burron November 16 he said that he was from Rhode Island , where he had a father and brothers. He had, he admitted, been in jail in New York and his father had sent £70 there to redeem him. About five years before, he confessed, he had escaped from the jail in New Haven in order to save his life, as he was like to freeze to death. He added that he had not been to Rhode Island for thirteen months and that he came last from the Widow Mead's at Horseneck on Long Island . As for the counterfeit bills, he claimed that he had received two of the 20s. bills from Charles Congrove at the Oyster Pond on Long Island and that he had changed silver with a Hartford man for two 20s. bills. He planned, he said, to obtain money from his father to buy land for a settlement in the \"New Country.\"\n\nJustice Burr was not favorably impressed, especially when a bill, not quite finished, was found in Barker's pocket, so he ordered the prisoner committed to the jail in Fairfield . On the night of November 20, however, Barker broke out but this time was recaptured and returned to prison on November 23 by John Bagly and Lieutenant John Taylor. Now he was confined in irons.\n\nAt the Superior Court held in Fairfield on December 11, 1717, Barker, described as late of Newport, Rhode Island , was indicted for having, about November 15 at Norwalk, counterfeited four 20s. Rhode Island bills and for having uttered one of them. He pleaded not guilty, was tried, convicted and at the next sessions of the court on February 5, 1718, was sentenced forthwith to be given thirty lashes on the naked body and again, during the first week in March, to receive another thirty stripes. In addition he was to be imprisoned for six months and to pay costs of £14/0/4. The informer had some difficulty in obtaining his reward, as well as his 20s. and the treble damages due him by law.

In the latter part of November, 1711, he had altered three Connecticut bills, one of 2s. to 20s., one of 3s. to 30s. and one of 5s. to 50s. The first he passed to Thomas Atwell in New Haven , the second to Sergeant Strickland and the third to Richard Christophers. Christophers at once detected the cheat and bound Rowly over to appear at the next Superior Court. Shubael Rowly, Sr., and Joshua Hempstead provided bail in the amount of £40. The following day, according to Christophers, young Rowly confessed that he had altered the bills and had passed two of them, of which he had taken up one and was desirous of taking up the other.\n\nAt the March session of the Superior Court Rowly was called three times but neither he nor his sureties appeared. He was, however, indicted, his bail was declared forfeited, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. Sometime later, probably in September, John Reed, the Queen's Attorney, recovered from Shubael Rowly, Sr., £36 of the forfeited bond and, apparently because of a deal between Read and the father of young Rowly, the Assembly in October, 1712, was persuaded to pass a resolution that Shubael Rowly, Jr., should not be further prosecuted on his indictment. As Christophers pointed out, the Assembly seems to have considered the answering of the bond as equivalent to the miscreant's conviction. Christophers was, as the informer, entitled to the reward of £20, which the Court advised him to seek of the Assembly and which that body finally granted him in May, 1713. 6\n\nEnd Notes\n\n5\n\nC. & M.

Elderkin, however, was indicted for uttering a 2/6 Connecticut bill altered to 20s., to which charge he pleaded not guilty. He was tried, convicted and sentenced to spend six months in prison and to pay a fine of £15 and costs of £10/18/6. Paul Wentworth, who had informed against Elderkin, in open court requested that his costs and those of Hambleton be deducted from the reward of £20 due him as informer, and the court ordered Elderkin to pay £20 to be turned over to Wentworth. 7\n\nElderkin, who was in poor health and feared the consequences of spending the winter in what was doubtless an unheated jail, petitioned the Assembly for \"the abatement of his imprisonment,\" and in October it was voted that \"if the petitioner shall give bail to any of the judges of the superiour court to render himself to him or any of the said judges upon command at any time within a twelve month after the session of this Court, the time yet to come of his imprisonment, according to the sentence given against him, shall commence when the prison and weather will allow him to be imprisoned without danger of hazarding his health.\" 8\n\nEnd Notes\n\n6\n\nRecords, Court of Assistants and Superior Court 1687–1715, pp. 242, 244; Records, Court of Assistants and Superior Court 1710–1749, pp. 54, 59, 73; C. & M.

When the prisoner was on his way to jail, he fled from the constable and made good his escape. The governor and council, meeting in New London on March 4, ordered that a proclamation be published offering a reward and reasonable charges to anyone who should take the fugitive and bring him before any justice of the peace in the colony. 9 The proclamation brought results, for Parkhurst was captured and then indicted at the Superior Court in New London on March 23, 1714, for having passed two counterfeit Massachusetts bills, one of 15s. and one of 10s. He pleaded not guilty, was tried, convicted and sentenced to be imprisoned for six months and to pay a fine of £35 and costs of £10/15/5. 10\n\nParkhurst, like Elderkin, was desirous of selecting a favorable season in which to serve his sentence in the New London jail. He therefore petitioned the Assembly at its May session, 1714, for the abatement of his imprisonment, and his request was granted on the same terms stipulated with regard to Elderkin. Hence his term in jail could commence when the prison and weather entailed no hazard to his health. In his case, however, there was a proviso that he must pay the fine and costs before he could be released. 11\n\nThe altering of Connecticut bills from a lower to a higher denomination \"by some evil persons\" and the \"considerable damages\" suffered on that account by various individuals caused the Assembly in May, 1713, to vote that £20,000 in bills be emitted and used by the treasurer for one and a half years after May 14, 1713, to redeem the bills outstanding, holders of which were to be notified by proclamation to bring them to the treasurer to be exchanged. 12 Following upon the action of the Assembly, the governor and council at a meeting in New London on June 11.1713, ordered that the plates formerly used for printing bills should be altered \"for the preventing of such cheating practises\" and that the following devices should be put on the plates: on the 2s. a dove, on the 2/6 a cock, on the 3s. a squirrel, on the 5s. a fox, on the 10s. a lamb, on the 20s. a deer, on the 40s. a horse and on the £5 a lion. 13\n\nAlmost a year later, at a meeting held in New London on June 2, 1714, the governor and council had further cause for concern. Richard Christophers laid before them a 40s. bill of the first emission of Connecticut which bore the date of July 12, 1709, only and not the additional date of May, 1713, \"over the names of the committee signing, as in all the late emitted bills.\" The bill in question was examined and, on comparison with a true bill, was found to be taken from a false plate, as was shown by the bad cut and unevenness of the letters making up the body of the counterfeit bill. The council at once resolved that a proclamation be issued signifying the cheat and instructing all holders of Connecticut bills of the first emission to take them to the treasurer and have them exchanged by him for bills of the same value of those lately emitted. 14\n\nEven the treasurer, Captain Joseph Whiting, had been deceived by some counterfeit bills, for William Pitkin and Joseph Talcott, a committee for drawing out of the treasury and destroying the dead stock of bills that had been drawn in by the constables in several rates, in June, 1714, came upon six 5s. bills altered to 40s., five half crown (2/6) bills altered to 40s. and four 3s. bills also altered to 40s. On June 26 they likewise drew out of the hands of Mrs. Mary Haynes of Hartford £975/3/-, in which sum they discovered two counterfeit 40s bills. 15\n\nThe situation in 1717 was serious enough to warrant action by the Assembly. This body, by an act of October, 1714, had extended to June 1, 1715, the time for exchanging bills of the emission of 1709. It now, in October, 1717, extended the time for exchange to May 15, 1718, after which date it was provided that the bills need not be accepted by creditors. In taking such action the Assembly noted that some persons had been negligent about bringing in the bills to have them exchanged by the treasurer, whereby opportunity had been given to evil-minded persons to practice cheats and forgeries by means of false plates and otherwise, all of which had proved and might still prove to be of great damage. 16\n\nIn May of 1717 the Assembly had also passed an act \"for the more Effectual preventing the Spreading or Passing of False, Altered, or Counterfeited Bills of Credit.\" The preamble read: \"This Assembly considering the great Mischief Suffered both by the Publick and by particular Persons, by reason of the many Altered, False and Counterfeit Bills that are Passing among the People, notwithstanding the great Care which has been taken to Suppress all Evil Practices upon the said Bills.\" Then the text continues: It is further Provided by this Assembly, and the Authority thereof, That when and so often as it shall happen, that any such False, Altered or Counterfeit Bills, shall be brought to the Treasurer of this Colony, or Offered to him in Payment of Rates, or to be Exchanged, he shall Secure them; and he is hereby Authorized to Seize and Retain them, entering the Name of the person in whose Possession the Bill or Bills were, on the Backside thereof. And further, Every Assistant and Justice of the Peace in this Colony is hereby also Authorized and Impowred to Seize or take into his Custody every such Bill as aforesaid, which he shall See, Observe, or have Cognizance of, and the same to Retain, Entring on the backside thereof the Name of him from whom he takes the said Bill, and at his Discretion to Administer an Oath to him to Declare the person of whom he Received it, and to send forth his Precept, or otherways to Cause the Person to come before him to be Examined in the Premises, and to proceed in his Inquiries after the Author of this Mischief as far as his Discretion will guide him. 17\n\nEnd Notes\n\n9\n\nIbid.

As the bills of the emission of 1709 were not all in by July, 1718, the governor and council, meeting at Guilford , ordered that the treasurer and all officials appointed to receive public debts should take the 1709 bills in payment (Col. Rec. Conn. VI, pp. 66–67). The time limit for exchanging the bills was later extended to Nov. 1, 1719 (Col. Rec. Conn. VI, pp. 129–130.).\n\nThomas Banks, John Andrews and the Greenman Gang\n\nOne Connecticut bill, that of the denomination of 10s., had been counterfeited by the Greenman gang, which had secured the plate from Freelove Lippencott, along with plates for bills of Rhode Island and Massachusetts . This ring of money makers included Captain Edward Greenman and his sons, Silas and Edward, Jr., all of Kingstown, Rhode Island , Joseph Atwood of Newport , Joseph Jones of Boston , Thomas Banks of Branford , Connecticut , and others. The three Greenmans were tried and convicted at Newport on November 28, 1718, and Connecticut sent Thomas Banks to testify against them. 18 On December 1 the father was sentenced to stand in the pillory and have his ears cropped and be whipped twenty-five lashes or pay £600 by January 1, 1719, and give bond with sureties in the amount of £700 to pay double damages for all bills that appeared to have been made from his plates. The sons received the same sentence, save that they were only to pay £300 each and give bond with sureties in the amount of £400 each to pay damages. 19\n\nThe Governor of Connecticut and Council in New London on January 25, 1720, ordered that \"the counterfeit ten shilling bill taken off Greenman's plate, which is in the files of the superiour court and upon which Banks was taken up and prosecuted, 20 be transmitted to Coll. Fitch at Boston , for a pattern to distinguish those bills from the true bills in exchanging the two hundred and fifty pounds committed to his care for that end.\" Colonel Fitch was also to be sent very detailed information about the Connecticut paper money and likewise six bills of different denominations: a true 40s. bill of some of the former emissions; a 40s. bill from a counterfeit plate, which plate had never been found, while the counterfeits from it had not been known to be uttered for a considerable time; a true 10s. bill of the former emissions; it had a character on its face by which the false 10s. bill from Greenman's plate could easily be distinguished, as the counterfeit was of a paler ink than the true bill (It was pointed out that no counterfeits of any Connecticut bills by false plates had been discovered save these two, the 40s. bill and the 10s. bill struck from Greenman's plate.); a 10s. bill from Greenman's plate; a 3s. bill raised to 40s.; a 5s. bill altered to 40s. The memorandum to Colonel Fitch read: \"There has been no late practice of this kind taken notice of here, nor anything of this nature attempted upon the bills of the later emission, which have the forms of living creatures on them.\" 21\n\nTwo Connecticut men involved in passing Greenman's paper money were Thomas Banks and John Andrews (or Andross). Banks, who was a tailor of Branford , got into difficulties through carelessness. On Saturday, July 6, 1717, he lodged at the house of John Hill and early in the morning set out for Stonington . After his departure Hill's eleven-year-old daughter picked up a piece of paper that Banks had dropped and brought it to her father. It was a letter dated June 21, 1717, and signed by John Lovel. Inside was a counterfeit 10s. Connecticut bill which was neither numbered nor signed ( Plates IX-X). Lovel was a tailor, a servant for debt to a tailor in New London named Farrand, from whom he ran away, presumably a short time before or after Banks dropped the note. In the note Lovel asked his wife for eight or nine pounds, with which he wanted to pay Mr. Thomas Farrand in order that he might be released and come to join his wife and child.\n\nOn Thursday, July 11, John Austin and a fellow traveller named Aply stopped on their way from New London at Justice Hill's \"in Naragansett country.\" Hill was not at home but his wife showed them the counterfeit bill dropped by Banks. The following Saturday, on his way back to New London , Austin again stopped at Hill's and Justice Hill gave him the spurious bill to be sent to William Pitkin. Austin reported to Pitkin that people said Banks \"was very great with one Leepincutts Wife who is now att New London , She is ye Woman ytt was accus'd, & imprison'd att Rhoad Island for counterfeiting Bills.\" One Meergratt, keeper of a coffee house in Rhode Island , told Austin that he and his wife suspected Banks of being \"naughty\" and that Banks had been in Rhode Island to get a sloop built.\n\nBanks was soon arrested and on July 20 was examined at Branford before William Pitkin, assistant, and two justices of the peace, Edward Barker and John Hall. The prisoner said he had come to Branford about three years before, admitted dealings with the Lippencotts but claimed he had received only an insignificant sum from them for keeping Mrs. Lippencott at his house. Then he recounted in some detail a trip he had made to Rhode Island about three weeks before, with special explanation of his finances on the journey.\n\nAt the October sessions of the Superior Court at New Haven he was indicted for having, about July 8 at Groton, passed a false 10s. Connecticut bill to Mrs. Savell Latham, widow of Samuel Latham. His indictment, however, was returned ignoramus by the grand jury.\n\nFurther information on Bank's activities subsequently came to light through the arrest of John Andrews (or Andros) of Milford . A warrant for his apprehension was issued at Milford on August 9, 1718, by Samuel Eells and Jonathan Law to the constables of that town. One Jones at Boston , who confessed himself a member of the ring of counterfeiters, apparently stated that Andrews had secured plates from Banks. Andrews was taken into custody and on August 11 was examined before Justices Eells and Law. His press was found and he said that Banks, who owed him money, had sent him plates and told him to make bills with them. Instead, he maintained, he threw them into his well and never made any money with them. He was sent with an officer, and the plates were recovered from the well. Andrews was then released on bail of £40, furnished by Samuel Baldwin and John Harpin of Milford , for his appearance at the next Superior Court to be held at New Haven in September.\n\nOn September 9 he was indicted for having on the last day of May passed counterfeit bills of several New England colonies to the value of £29. At this he made a full confession, which was as follows: When he was once at the house of Samuel Miles in Milford , Thomas Banks showed him a letter he had received from Silas Greenman of Kingstown, Rhode Island , in which Greenman wrote that he had a horse for sale for £20; Banks explained that by \"horse\" Greenman meant \"paper money\" and by \"£20\" that he would provide £100 in bills of his own making for £20 of good money. Andrews then agreed to a proposition made by Banks that they go shares in procuring and passing some counterfeits. In March, 1716, Banks went to Greenman for some money but came back empty-handed, since Greenman had no money made. Captain Greenman, however, promised to have some bills ready by May 8 and that one of his sons would then meet Banks between the New London ferry and Edward Dennison's at the bridge.\n\nBanks and Andrews at the appointed time and place met Edward Greenman, who gave Banks only £40, explaining that his brother Silas, who signed the bills, had been chosen justice of the peace and was unwilling to sign any more. Later on Banks went in company with Jones to Captain Greenman's and brought back plates for making the following bills: £3 Rhode Island ; 10s. Connecticut ; 3s., 3/6, 20s. and 50s. Boston . Soon after this Banks was arrested for passing false money. In October, Andrews said, Banks gave him the plates to keep and then went away with his family to New York, whence about the end of July Banks wrote asking Andrews to send the \"things\" to him to New York. Andrews himself had had £29 in bogus money from Banks, who, incidentally, told him that Mr. Lippencott had secured false money from Captain Greenman.\n\nThe judges had promised to intercede in Andrews' favor because he made this confession and produced the plates. The court sentenced him to be imprisoned for six months and to pay a fine of £50 and costs of £5/4/0. The governor and council on October 28, 1718, heard a petition from the counterfeiter and because of his confession of guilt ordered his release from the jail in New Haven on condition that he furnish to the jailer satisfactory security for the payment of £30 of his fine and costs of prosecution to the next Superior Court to be held in New Haven . 22\n\nEnd Notes\n\n17\n\nActs and Laws of His Majesties Colony of Connecticut in New-England (New-London : Timothy Green, 1715), p. 236; Col.

Three persons were involved, Lieutenant Richard Higgenbotham, Sergeant Richard Lockwood and Ann Lockwood, the wife of Gersham Lockwood, Jr., of Greenwich . Higgenbotham was cleared by proclamation and it was ordered that the charges of prosecution be paid out of the public treasury. 23 Richard Lockwood gave bail for his appearance in the amount of £100 but did not come into court, sending a note to the effect that he was too ill to attend because of pains in his neck. His bond was declared forfeited, and a scire facias was issued for his appearance before the next sessions in March. At that time he was brought into court, when his case was continued until September. He appeared then but his case was apparently dropped, and there is no further notice of it. 24\n\nAnn Lockwood was the real culprit. It was revealed that about the beginning of July Mrs. Richard Higgenbotham went from Cos Cob with four pairs of stockings for Mrs. Lockwood to sell in Greenwich . While in Greenwich Mrs. Higgenbotham sold two pairs of the stockings, one to Joseph Knap for Indian corn and another to Mr. Jessup for four shillings. She left the money and the remaining two pairs of stockings with Mrs. Lockwood. A few days later Lieutenant Richard Higgenbotham and his wife went to Ann Lockwood and gave her a 2s. bill and a 2/6 Rhode Island bill. She was to add this to the 4s. she already had from them and was to purchase for them some wool. When Mrs. Lockwood looked at the Rhode Island half crown bill, she remarked that it was a fair opportunity to change the 2 to a 10 because of a vacancy in the paper. At this Mr. Higgenbotham told her not to do so and she said that she would not.\n\nThe temptation, however, proved too strong. She altered the bill and paid it out, together with three 2s. bills, to Benjamin Hobby for nine and a quarter pounds of wool. But soon Hobby found that the altered bill would not pass and returned it to her. Ann, thoroughly frightened, on Saturday, July 13, took the altered bill to the Higgenbothams. She told them it was the way the apple tempted Mother Eve and that she would never do such a thing again. She talked with them for about an hour under a green tree, asking them to take back the bill and to stretch the truth by saying that they had the bill of a stranger. If they would do this, she promised them £20 and said they could live at one end of her house and have the use of her cows. Her husband knew of her crime and so did his brother Joseph, who had informed her that he had a good mind to knock her on the head because her husband was like to be ruined by her confounded tricks. Subsequently Gersham Lockwood begged Higgenbotham to burn the bill and to say nothing about Ann's confession.\n\nEventually Ann was taken into custody by Constable Joshua Reynolds. In September she was indicted for having altered the bill, pleaded not guilty, was tried, convicted and sentenced to stand in the pillory on three several lecture days or days of public meeting for a half hour each day. She was further to be disabled to give any evidence before any court, magistrate, or justice of the peace and was to pay costs of prosecution amounting to £6/13/6. On Saturday, September 7, she was discharged on bail provided by her husband on condition that she would appear at Fairfield on the public days appointed by the Deputy Governor to receive such parts of her punishment as had not yet been executed. 25\n\nEnd Notes\n\n22\n\nS.C.

Fairweather, finding that the bill had been raised, on October 29 lodged a complaint with James Bennet, J.P., who had Peat arrested. Peat at once swore the false bill on Beach, who was taken into custody, examined and then released on bail of £50 furnished by himself and Fairweather. He was indicted at the Superior Court held in Fairfield on March 4, 1718, at which the witnesses summoned against him were Lieutenant James Bennet, Major John Burr, William James, Samuel Wheeler, Louis Lyron, Job Sherman and Jonathan Styles. Beach pleaded not guilty, was tried and acquitted, being discharged on payment of costs of £5/3/6. 26\n\nAt about this time or a little later the Connecticut 40s. bill was being counterfeited, for the Boston News-Letter of June 9, 1718, printed the following dispatch from Piscataqua, dated June 6: Yesterday two Young Men were Impillored here, and had their Ears cut off, for Forging and uttering a Connecticut Forty Shilling Bill and a Fifteen Shilling Bill of this Province ... Their Names we forbear incerting, hoping they;l Repent of their Wickeness, and relate the Facts as a warning to all others both in this & in the Neighbouring Provinces to prevent others from committing the like Crimes; who if should, being fairly warned are not to expect the like Indulgence.\n\nBenjamin Simpson\n\nOn January 12, 1719, Samuel Miles gave entertainment in his house at Milford to Benjamin Simpson of Weston and John Cole of Wells , and Simpson paid out to Miles a 15s. bill of New Hampshire . After their departure Miles discovered that the bill was counterfeit, secured a warrant for their arrest and during the night pursued them to Stratford , where he seized them at the house of Mr. Burroughs and brought them before the authorities. Upon examination Simpson owned that he had passed the bill to Miles and said that he had obtained it, along with two other 15s. New Hampshire bills, among the notes making up £6 paid him near Groton for a horse. He did not know who the purchaser was but thought him a sailor lately come from England . He could not tell what he had done with the other two bills and demanded to be searched. This was done, and no paper money was found on him. Cole, however, was also searched and on him was discovered a 20s. Boston bill judged by all the spectators to be false. Cole said that the money was not his but Simpson's, to which Simpson agreed.\n\nIt appeared that Simpson had offered one 15s. bill to Mrs. Burroughs, who refused it, telling him it was false. Further Joseph Blackledge and several others testified that after Simpson's arrest they had seen a considerable number of bills in his hand and Blackledge had looked at several of them and handed them back to Simpson. When he was questioned about them, Simpson admitted that he had burned the 15s. bill he had offered to Mrs. Burroughs and he finally requested liberty to go look for the rest of the money, which, he said, he had dropped along the way.\n\nIn company with the constable and Samuel Whitney he went back to Mr. Burroughs' house, where, behind the log, they found one 15s. bill partly burnt, and, when Mrs. Burroughs swept the hearth, another 15s. bill came to light. Then a careful search along the road produced a bundle of good bills amounting to fifty-nine shillings, wrapped up in paper and lying in the snow, as well as eleven 15s. New Hampshire bills. Then one more 15s. bill was located in the snow. Simpson admitted that the money was his and finally confessed that he had passed one 15s. bill before coming to Milford . This was scrupled but accepted, so that he feared all the bills were false and therefore burnt some and dropped the others. He was then committed to prison to remain there until the next Superior Court met at Fairfield , while Cole, who had readily answered the questions put to him and had been fully cleared by Simpson of having owned any of the paper money, was released. 27\n\nWhen the Superior Court met at Fairfield on March 3, 1719, the keeper of the jail, Samuel Hubwell, being ordered to produce the prisoner, \"declared that the sd. Prisoner had broken Goal and made his Escape out at the Chimney as he apprehended.\" Joseph Curtis of Stratford in reporting by letter to the Honorable Nathan Gold, Esq., in Fairfield , commented that Simpson's escape was a \"great pittee,\" since such escapes encouraged criminals. Miles, because of Simpson's flight, had lost the reward due to him as informer, so upon his petitioning the Assembly in October that body voted him the sum of £5. 28\n\nThe concern of the authorities over the steady circulation of false paper money is indicated by the action of the governor and council at a meeting held at Saybrook on December 4, 1718, when it was resolved that a proclamation should be made requiring all persons in authority who had secured any counterfeit bills to have them returned to the treasurer of the colony before a certain day in May that the General Assembly might decide what should be done with them. 29\n\nIt is quite likely that Ebenezer Seamore was responsible for some of the counterfeits. He was arrested in 1718 on suspicion of altering and putting off paper notes. He retained as his attorney John Read of Lone Town and gave Read his promisory note for £20. Read, however, went off to Springfield and Seamore had to secure the services of another lawyer, As it transpired, Seamore was not brought to trial but was dismissed, though he had to pay Read the £20, much to his chagrin. 30 Before long he was to get into serious trouble through his connection with Ovid Rushbrook.\n\nEnd Notes\n\n26\n\nS.C.

The sheriff was likewise commanded to search for false bills or instruments for making them and, if necessary, to break open any house, chest or other place in the course of his search. On February 29 Deputy Sheriff Thomas Spencer reported that he had arrested Thomas and Abraham Whipple , Ovid Rushbrook and Benoney Blodget and had seized two copper plates found hidden in Thomas Whipple's house. 3 The persons taken up were examined, and from their answers it appeared that visitors at Whipple's home of late had been William Cromey from Coventry , Benoney Blodget and Joshua Booth. Rushbrook, who had followed the clothing trade in Springfield , had come away from that town to avoid paying money upon a charge laid upon him and had been boarding at Whipple's for about a month. All the witnesses professed great ignorance about the provenance of the two copper plates, and, when they were questioned as to how a certain board came to be as black as it was, they professed that it was from powder for making a skyrocket. After the examination of the suspects, it was decided by Pitkin, Joseph Talcott and Aaron Cook, J. P., that Thomas Whipple, Sr., and Ovid Rushbrook should find surety in the amount of £20 each to appear at the Superior Court to be held at Hartford on the third Tuesday in March or otherwise be committed to jail. Samuel Whipple of Groton furnished the bail of £20 for Whipple but Rushbrook was locked up in jail. Whipple's sons, Thomas, Jr., andAbraham, were discharged on payment of costs.\n\nBefore the meeting of the court in Hartford considerable evidence was collected by Justice John Pyncheon in Springfield and sent to the Connecticut authorities. David Ingersoll of Springfield testified that Rushbrook seemed to have money, slyly looking at it in his pocketbook and taking great care that no one should get a good look at it. Ebenezer Stebbins, who had worked together with Rushbrook much of the past winter, swore that Rushbrook was very remiss in his business yet seemed to have money from some source.\n\nOther witnesses before John Pyncheon gave more damaging details. Jonathan Merrick stated that Rushbrook had told him it was an easy thing to alter bills by taking pieces of small bills and grafting the pieces onto bigger bills. On one occasion he examined Rushbrook's pocketbook and found in it pieces of bills, some with the word \"shillings\" on them and some other words or figures. He took them to Rushbrook and told him he thought he was engaged in altering bills with these pieces but Rushbrook made no reply.\n\nMargaret Merrick testified that during the summer of 1719, when Rushbrook was boarding at the home of her father, Lieutenant John Merrick, Rushbrook, who owed her father fifteen pence, seeing her with a fifteenpenny bill, told her that if she would turn it over to him he would give her a half crown bill and thus pay his debt. This was done, and soon after, on entering the shop where Rushbrook worked, she saw behind his loom his open pocketbook. She took it up and saw in it the fifteenpenny bill, now raised to fifteen shillings, and she recognized the bill by a particular mark which she had observed on the note which she had given to Rushbrook.\n\nRobert Carton gave evidence that the night before Rushbrook left Springfield in company with Thomas Whipple the two men were at Ingersoll's, where they called for a private room and a fire. Carton, who was waiting on them, observed to Rushbrook, when Whipple had stepped out, that \"they were about Roguery.\" Rushbrook said that he would like to secure three shilling and half crown Rhode Island bills if the house had any. Later, on passing through the chamber, Carton heard Rushbrook tell Whipple he, could make New York money easily.\n\nMary Day, wife of Lieutenant John Day of Springfield , stated under oath that one evening Rushbrook and Jonathan Old were at their house whispering together. Old asked her for a light that they might go aside into another room, a request which she refused. The next morning Old came asking after his pocketbook, which he said he had lost the night before. This same pocketbook was found by Henry Rogers of Springfield , who brought it to Justice Pyncheon and told him that papers in it indicated that the owner was Jonathan Old. In the purse were also two counterfeit 40s. ( Plate XI) Rhode Island bills. Pyncheon kept the matter secret until he received a message from Justice Wolcott of Windsor asking for information about Rushbrook. Old was then summoned and examined, first by Pyncheon and later by Pyncheon and Major Stoddard together. After many shiftings and evasions Old admitted receiving the two forged bills from Rushbrook and that Rushbrook later begged him to keep silent about the loss of the pocketbook lest Rushbrook get into trouble on account of the bills. Pyncheon had Old sign an acknowledgment on the back of each bill that he had received it from Rushbrook. The justice then sent the money to the judges of the Superior Court in Hartford , where one of the bills in question is still preserved in the Connecticut State Library.\n\nIn Connecticut new evidence against Rushbrook came to light, for it was discovered that he had passed to Joseph Hatch of Hartford a fifteenpenny New Hampshire bill altered to three pounds ( Plate XII), a bill which Hatch had passed to Widow Abigail Baker of Windsor , who discovered the cheat and brought the matter to the attention of Justice Aaron Cook.\n\nOn May 20, 1720, Thomas Whipple was indicted for having prepared, together with Rushbrook, copper plates for counterfeiting the bills of the colonies in New England . On the twenty-sixth of the same month Rushbrook was indicted for counterfeiting bills, making copper plates for such purpose and for passing counterfeit money.\n\nA report reached Rushbrook in prison that his trial was to be put off to a later session, whereupon he petitioned the judges, asking for a prompt trial along with Dr. Whipple and closing with these words: \"I remain in a friendless and Moneyless, and almost in an Lunitick Condition thinking what will Become of me who Sprung of so Noble a stock.\" The trials of both men, however, did not take place, for Peter Pratt, the King's Attorney, stated that at the moment certain witnesses could not be had and therefore moved that the trials be deferred until the witnesses might be procured. As Rushbrook escaped and there is no record of a trial of Whipple, it is probable that Whipple's case was dropped. 4\n\nIn May, 1720, a law was passed to the following effect:\n\nWhosoever shall Stamp, or any other ways Counterfeit any of the several sorts of Coin, mentioned in a certain Law, Entituled, An Act for Ascertaining the Value of Coins Currant within this Colony; or any other Species or sort of Coin; or that shall Utter or put off any such Counterfeit Coin, knowing it to be Base, False and Counterfeit; and shall be thereof Convicted before any of the Superiour Courts in this Colony, shall be Sentenced to suffer Six Months Imprisonment, or such other Fine or Corporal Punishment (respect being had to the degree of the Crime) as the said Court shall judge meet or inflict: Such Fines to be to the Publick Treasury of this Colony. 5\n\nIt may be presumed that there was some suspicion that counterfeit coin was being made or uttered, though the extant records give no evidence on the point.\n\nBy September it was discovered that the 10s. bills of Connecticut were being forged. Samuel Shute, Governor of Massachusetts , on September 5, 1720, issued the following procamation: Whereas notwithstanding the Care of this Government to prevent and punish the Counterfeiting and Falsifying the Bills of Credit, (more especially of this Province,) a Discovery has been lately made of a considerable number of Forged and Counterfeit Bills, in Imitation of the Five Pound Bills of this Province, Signed by Four Hands; and others in Imitation of the Ten Shilling Bills of the Colony of Connecticut ; Which Counterfeit Bills have been Uttered by One John Bishop of Guilford (as he calls himself) who is supposed to be the Forger and Counterfeiter thereof, and to have been assisted by one Joshua Booth of Enfield, and one William Tucker: I have therefore thought fit by the Advice of His Majesty's Council to issue forth this Proclamation, hereby to give Publick Notice of the said Counterfeit Bills, in order to prevent the Inhabitants of this and the Neighbouring Provinces from being imposed upon and cheated thereby, and to call upon all His Majesty's good Subjects, as they will do their Duty to the Government, and as they tender the Interest thereof, to use their utmost Endeavour to make Discovery of the Authors and their Accom- plices in such Wicked and Detestable Practices; Hereby also promising a Reward of Ten Pounds, and the necessary Charges (to be paid out of the Publick Treasury) to such Person or Persons as shall discover and apprehend the abovesaid John Bishop (as he is called) so as he be rendered up to Justice: The said John Bishop is described as follows, viz. He is of the Age of about Twenty one Years, of middle Stature, having short brown Hair somewhat curled, and having on a blue Cloth Coat, Leather Breeches and light coloured Du Roy Jacket. 6\n\nJohn Bishop, alias John Blyn, had been arrested at Woodstock on September 2 and taken before the authorities. At his examination he was found to have some of the counterfeit 10s. Connecticut bills on his person but in some fashion he managed to flee, and the same day a hue and cry was issued after him. 7 While the search was on in both Massachusetts and Connecticut , Benjamin Judd, a constable of Farmington , learning of the affair and making inquiries, discovered where Bishop was concealed and with the aid of others found and apprehended him. The prisoner was taken before Major Talcott to be examined. Bishop confessed that he had counterfeited and passed many bills of Connecticut and other colonies. There is no record of his punishment and he very likely escaped by breaking jail, as happened so often because of the weakness of the prisons. His captor, Benjamin Judd, petitioned the General Assembly for some reward for his services. 8 It will be recalled that the name of Bishop's associate, Joshua Booth of Enfield, had been mentioned in the examinations made into the counterfeiting activities of Rushbrook and Whipple. It is not known whether Booth and Tucker were captured but presumably they escaped arrest, since there is no further mention of them in the court records.\n\nIt was anticipated that there might be occasion to employ persons in the colony's service \"in bringing such as are or may be taken up for counterfeiting bills... to just punishment,\" for on November i, 1720, the governor and council placed a sum of money at the disposal of Joseph Talcott to be used on orders of the governor and council. 9\n\nIt was probably the activity of Bishop and his associates which on November 2, 1720, prompted Governor Shute of Massachusetts to say in a speech to the General Assembly of that province: The Vile practice of Counterfeiting the Province Bills, is carrying on not only in many parts of these Provinces; but also in Great Britain, which if not timely prevented must prove very fatal to most of the American Settlements, whose Medium of Trade are Bills of Credit, I therefore recommend it to you, as one of the best Expedients to prevent the growth of this wicked Practice, to make it a Capital Crime by a Law, and strictly to put it in Execution, without which, making of good & wholsome Laws, will be of no signification, and instead of tending to strengthen the hands of Government, which is the principal design of making them, will rather render the Government weak and feeble. 10\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1\n\nBoston News Letter, Dec. 8, 1718, p. 2.\n\n2\n\nC. & M.

On January 24 James Smith of Bellingham , Massachusetts , complained against Denison to Richard Christophers, assistant. Smith charged that at Stonington , on December 30, 1720, in the presence of Samuel Rich, Denison, in paying off a bond, gave Smith a 3s. Massachusetts bill which was found to be altered to 30s. ( Plates XIII-XIV). Smith scrupled it but Denison said he did not have enough money to take it back and had his son write his (the father's) name on it. Denison, who claimed that he had borrowed the bill from someone, was bound over to appear at the March sessions of the Superior Court to be held at New London and was released on bail of £100 furnished by himself and James Packer of Groton. It would seem that the evidence was insufficient, for the grand jury returned the indictment ignoramus. 11\n\nEnd Notes\n\n9\n\nCol. Rec. Conn.

The same newspaper of December 19, 1720, p. 2, notes that the governor had assented to an act against counterfeiting the bills of credit of Massachusetts and the neighboring governments.\n\nJohn Thomas\n\nToward the close of the same year John Allison, a wigmaker of Wethersfield , complained on December 20 to Justice John Goodrich at Wethersfield that John Thomas, a laborer of Middletown, had on the previous day passed him a Connecticut half crown bill altered to 40s. One witness, Mehitabel Rose, swore that Thomas had said the bill he gave to Allison was good and that, if it were not, he would take it back and also that he had received it from Mr. Watson. Other witnesses, John Francis and Luther Latimer, stated that in their presence on December 19 Thomas offered 20s. to Solomon Gillman for an altered half crown bill and that Gillman warned Thomas that the bill was altered and that he must not put it off for 40s.\n\nA warrant for the arrest of Thomas was issued and he was apprehended and examined by Justice Goodrich on December 20. The magistrate set bail of £200 for the appearance of Thomas at the Superior Court to be held at Hartford in March. On December 23, however, Joseph Talcott, assistant, released Thomas on bail of £50 furnished by Thomas Binen of Middletown and Joseph Baker of Hartford . At the March sessions Peter Pratt, the King's Attorney, informed against Thomas for uttering the altered bill, 12 but as there is no further record of the case it is possible that Thomas fled or that the grand jury failed to indict him.\n\nJoseph Drake, Jr.\n\nOn August 2, 1722, William Pitkin issued a warrant to either of the constables of Windsor to arrest Joseph Drake, Jr., of that town and bring him before Pitkin in Hartford at eight o'clock on the morning of August 6. Zebulon Taylor and Samuel Piney, Jr., both of Windsor , were also summoned to give evidence against Drake for having sometime in April passed a counterfeit dollar to John Smith of Windsor . On August 6 Pitkin adjourned the court to Monday, August 13, when Drake appeared and was questioned. During his examination Drake admitted having sold a piece of pewter in the shape and form of a dollar to Smith for five shillings, a sum which Smith had not yet paid him.\n\nTaylor and Piney testified that once in the house in Windsor where Jonathan Day lived they heard Smith speak to Drake \"about his puting off false Dolers or false Money.\" At this time Drake pulled out a piece in the shape of a dollar, which Smith said that Drake dare not pass. Drake affirmed that he did and offered to let Smith have it for five shillings and claimed that it was good money.\n\nPitkin thought the evidence against Drake so strong that he required his appearance at the next Superior Court to be held in Hartford on the second Tuesday in September. The prisoner was then released on bail of £50 provided by Drake and his father, Joseph, Sr. When the Superior Court met, the King's Attorney informed the justices that he was of the opinion that there was not sufficient evidence to support a prosecution of Drake and therefore had nothing to object against him. 13\n\nEnd Notes\n\n11\n\nS.C.

II, 225–230.\n\nSamuel and Abel Chapin\n\nOvid Rushbrook, while being examined at Springfield , had confessed that he had concealed two plates, one for making the £5 bill of Massachusetts and the other for forging the 10s. Connecticut bill. One Samuel Chapin of Springfield , who happened to be present at the examination, went out and found the two plates. Together with a cousin named Abel he then struck off some £5 notes but he found that the plate for the Connecticut bill had a crack in it which rendered it useless. In May, 1723, the cousins were arrested in Newport , Rhode Island , for passing bad money, were tried, convicted, pilloried, cropped and required to pay double damages to all whom they had defrauded, as well as costs of prosecution. 14\n\nEnd Notes\n\n13\n\nC. & M. II, 223–224b.\n\nMary Peck Butterworth\n\nAnother counterfeiter of this period was Mary Peck Butterworth of Rehoboth , Massachusetts , who as early as 1716 was forging paper money of Rhode Island . She later made bills of Massachusetts and the £5 Connecticut bill. She did not employ a plate but did the work with a pen, selling her product at half the face value but not passing it herself. One of her agents, Nicholas Camp of Rehoboth , was caught passing bad money and was examined at Newport in August, 1723. He confessed that he had uttered about £50 in false Connecticut £5 bills made by Mrs. Butterworth, and one of her products may well be the counterfeit Connecticut £5 bill, dated 1713, now in the possession of the Connecticut Historical Society in Hartford . 15\n\nThe New England governments had good reason to be alarmed by the activities of Mrs. Butterworth and others. Governor Dummer of Massachusetts on August 9, 1723, issued a proclamation designed to protect not only the bills of his province but also those of the other colonies in New England . It read: Whereas notwithstanding the Care taken by the several Governments to secure their Bills of Credit from Forgery and Corruption, by ordaining such Punishments as were thought sufficient to deter all Persons from that wicked and villanous Practice, and altho' the same by a late Law of this Province is to be punished by Death; And notwithstanding the former Examples of Justice inflicted on such Offenders, Divers Persons have of late been so bold and hardy as to Counterfeit the Bills of this and the Neighbouring Governments; more especially the Five Pound and Thirty Shilling Bills of this Province, and the Five Pound Bill of the Colony of Rhode-Island ; several of which Bills have lately pass'd to the manifest Lessening the Credit of the true Bills, as well as to the Loss and Wrong of particular Persons: I have therefore thought fit, with the Advice of His Majesty's Council, and at the Desire of the Representatives in their present Session, to issue forth this Proclamation, Hereby Requiring all Officers and Others His Majesty's good Subjects to use their utmost Endeavour to discover and bring to Justice all Persons whatsoever that may be concern'd in the said wicked Practice of Forging and Counterfeiting the Bills of Credit of this Government, and the Neighbouring Governments of New-Hampshire , Connecticut and Rhode-Island ; Hereby likewise Engaging that such Persons shall receive the Rewards provided by Law for such Services, and promising pardon to any One or Two Persons that have been concern'd in the Making or Uttering Counterfeit Bills, as aforesaid, who shall on or before the First Day of October next make a plain and full Discovery thereof, and as far as they know of their Accomplices, or Other Persons concern'd in those vile Practices; And in Case the said Accomplices or Others concern'd, shall be thereby detected and by Law convicted of the said Crime, the Person or Persons making such Discovery, as aforesaid, shall be Entitled to the Reward of Fifty Pounds each, and their necessary Charges. 16\n\nEnd Notes\n\n14\n\nKenneth Scott, \"The Counterfeiting Venture of Abel and Samuel Chapin,\" Rhode Island History II (1952), pp. 93–95.\n\n15\n\nRichard LeBaron Bowen, op. cit., esp. pp. 63–78.\n\nOvid Rushbrook and Ebenezer Seamore Again\n\nNot much later, on October 25, 1723, Daniel Tuttle of Wallingford, Connecticut , yeoman, was arrested and examined in Boston concerning his passing to Elizabeth Ellis a false £5 bill of Rhode Island . He claimed that Francis Brown of New Haven had given it to him some ten days before and had asked him to purchase handkerchiefs with it in Boston . During the examination he tried to chew up a 40s. bill, which he managed to reduce to pulp before it was taken from his mouth. Three days later he was further examined by Justice Habijah Savage and he told how Ebenezer Seamore that summer had brought back £5 and 40s. bills of Rhode Island from the Jerseys and had later showed him, Tuttle, plates for making them which had been engraved by Rushbrook. Tuttle had kept the plates for Seamore under straw in his barn. On November 9 Tuttle petitioned Governor Dummer and his council to be permitted to give information against Seamore. Tuttle was tried in Boston on December 13, 1723, and was acquitted, for the jury decided that his putting the bill in the hands of Elizabeth Ellis was not \"uttering\" it. 17\n\nBy the end of December Tuttle was back in Connecticut giving evidence against Seamore and his associates. Seamore was taken up at Wallingford, sent to Hartford and, after his examination on November 3, 1723, was committed to jail. The next day John Wyard (or Wiard) of Wethersfield was examined by Joseph Talcott, assistant, who also at that time questioned James Poisson (or Pison). Wyard was arrested and examined again on November 6, 7 and 13. He had put off false bills, obtained from Seamore, in Waterbury and in Woodbury . At Seamore's request he later sent John Hurlbut to get back the bills uttered in Woodbury . At his first examination he admitted having gone to Philadelphia with Seamore and mentioned Seamore's having made a trip to Egg Harbor in the Jerseys, but he confessed to nothing damaging either to himself or to Seamore. On November 6, however, when he was offered a reward of £20 and promised that all possible favor would be shown him if he could apprehend the principal actor and bring about the seizure of the press, he hesitated but said he was as capable as anyone of being King's Evidence in the matter. His further examination was then postponed until the seventh, when he was released in bail of £200. On that day he was closely questioned about a bill he had passed and was finally released again on bail of £250. At his final examination on November 13 Wyard admitted that he had been together with Seamore and Daniel Tuttle in Wallingford, and, with respect to a £5 bill he had passed, he explained that he had originally received the money from James Poisson and later got him to take it back. Still, however, he revealed nothing dangerous to himself or Seamore.\n\nJames Poisson, who was examined on November 4, told quite a different story. Wyard, according to Poisson, brought him a Rhode Island £5 bill which Wyard had passed to Hezekiah May and May had returned. Poisson inspected it, declared it to be false and tore it to pieces, acting thus as a friend to Wyard to keep him out of trouble. May confirmed the fact the Wyard had given him a counterfeit bill, which he had returned, and Elnathan Strong told also of receiving a 40s. Rhode Island bill from Wyard which proved to be forged and which Wyard took back. In like fashion John Hurlbut and Ensign Curtis had received false Rhode Island paper money from Wyard.\n\nDaniel Tuttle, who was back in Connecticut on December 31, was apparently quite willing to talk freely and told what is probably the true story, which is as follows: in the spring of 1723 he was hired by Seamore to pilot him through the woods to Guilford , where Seamore said he was going to get John Blyn, the same man who had been formerly prosecuted for making money. Seamore planned to send Blyn to get Ovid Rushbrook to go with him, Seamore, to the Jerseys to make plates and money. A short time later Seamore informed Tuttle that Blyn would not go to Rushbrook and that Rushbrook would not be concerned with Blyn because Blyn had once before betrayed him. So Seamore went himself to Rushbrook in Springfield . Rushbrook promised to meet him soon in Wallingford and presently came there. At the end of May or beginning of June, 1723, Seamore, Rushbrook and one Robinson of Wallingford set out for the Jerseys. On the way, as Seamore said, he bought \"half a pint of Lincott oyl att Mr. Jeremiah Attwaters in New Haven to do the flourishes of the bills on the back sid.\"\n\nSeamore, on his return to Wallingford about June 12 or 14, told Tuttle that they had made a £5 plate of Rhode Island and had struck from it six or eight bills which he thought would pass. They had made the money \"near Thirty miles from any place,\" cutting a hole in a hollow tree and putting in a pry to press the bills. One or two of the notes had been passed off at Egg Harbor to a man named Risley from Wallingford, who later returned the bills to Seamore. Rushbrook and Seamore together made another trip to the Jerseys about the beginning of July.\n\nOn the second trip they made more money, of which Seamore passed one bill at Fairfield and another at Danbury . Seamore stated to Tuttle that every time he came up from the Jerseys, John Wyard got part of the bogus money; Wyard, sometime in August, accompanied Seamore to the Jerseys, where Rushbrook made a plate for the 40s. Rhode Island bill and Wyard had a press made. Seamore returned to Wallingford alone, while Wyard, coming later, brought with him fifty £5 Rhode Island counterfeits and fifty 40s. bills of that province made from the new plate; he left both plates and half of the bills with Seamore.\n\nSeamore gave Tuttle a number of the false bills and on the Sunday night after Wyard's return asked Tuttle to keep the plates in a chest under lock and key. Tuttle took them but hid them in his haymow, where they were found later when a search was made for them. Seamore, as he told Tuttle, put off a 40s. bill to Ensign Nathaniel Roy, another to John Ives, Jr., and a £5 bill to a person whose first name was Jeremiah, all inhabitants of Wallingford. On a trip to Boston and Salem Seamore had put off some £60 in counterfeit bills, one of which was passed to a Mr. Lewis of Boston .\n\nEvidence secured by the authorities from John Blyn largely confirmed Tuttle's account. Blyn, moreover, added a number of details: Seamore and Wyard promised Rushbrook a horse and clothing for his services and Seamore gave Rushbrook a watch and £4 in New York money to encourage him. Despite this Rushbrook gave him the slip and afterwards, when Seamore had been arrested and broken jail and escaped, he told Tuttle that when he (Seamore) and Wyard were in Philadelphia they heard that Rushbrook was also there. They went to the house where he was said to be staying but the residents denied that he was there, so the two men went away. Coming again a half day later, they entered and saw Rushbrook run upstairs, so they followed him and asked him why he had taken their money and then left them in the lurch. He maintained that he was afraid but they finally won him over and he made the two plates for them. Tuttle added that Seamore had offered him his expenses and a horse if he would go down to Rushbrook and get more plates but Tuttle refused to have anything to do with the business.\n\nAs a result of the investigations Wyard was indicted in March, 1724, for uttering a false bill, and James Poisson, shopkeeper, was presented by the grand jury in September of the same year, also for passing. Poisson, at an examination on March 30, 1724, when asked where and when he got the counterfeit £5 Rhode Island bill he had passed to Caleb Bull ( Plate XV), replied that he had picked it up on the highway between Hartford and Wethersfield and that he had found in all nine £5 and seven 40s. Rhode Island counterfeit bills, all wrapped up in a paper. When further pressed by the examining magistrates, he made it clear that John Wyard, who owed him money, had dropped it for him to pick up. The name of John Pierce had been written on the bill passed to Caleb Bull, and Poisson admitted he had written the name on the money in order to swear that he had the counterfeit from Pierce. Poisson said he suspected the bills because he did not believe Wyard had so much good money also and because the false bills were paler than true ones and because they looked so new. Poisson, at the conclusion of his examination, was released on bail of £200 provided by Jonathan Easton for his appearance at the September session of the Superior Court in Hartford .\n\nAfter his indictment he pleaded not guilty but was tried, convicted and sentenced to be imprisoned for six months, to stand an hour and a half in the pillory at Hartford between the hours of ten and one on some day in November, to have the lower part of his right ear cut off and to pay costs of £9/10/–. When, however, he was called three times, he failed to appear, and the bond given by Easton was declared forfeited. 18 Easton died soon after and the recognizance was sued out against his administratrix to final judgment. Peter Pratt, the King's Attorney, therefore, informed the Assembly in October, 1725, that Poisson was \"like wholly to escape punishment for his flagitious crime, and the innocent widow and fatherless made the only sufferers.\" The Assembly then had a warrant issued for the immediate arrest of Poisson, who was to have the sentence of the Superior Court against him executed unless he should pay the £200 and sheriff's costs before December 31, 1725. 19 The sum was evidently paid by Poisson, for in April of the next year thirty pounds of it, by direction of the governor and council, was ordered paid to Major Roger Wolcott for official business. 20 Apparently, if Easton had not died, Poisson, by his non-appearance in court in September, 1724, would have escaped punishment altogether, and justice would have been satisfied by the forfeiture of the bail. After his absconding Poisson had been living unmolested in New Haven , apparently with the full knowledge of the authorities. 21\n\nSeamore also was an elusive person. He was arrested 22 and was to be tried at the Superior Court held at Hartford on March 10, 1724, but broke out of the Hartford jail and fled. Bail for his appearance in the amount of £150 had been provided by Samuel Seamore (or Seymour), and when Ebenezer was thrice called and failed to appear, this bail was declared forfeited. 23\n\nSeamore was, however, again taken into custody and at a Superior Court held in Fairfield on August 25, 1724, was indicted for having, on July 1, 1723, in Danbury tried to cheat Samuel Starr by putting off to him a counterfeit £5 Rhode Island bill. He was called, appeared, pleaded not guilty, was tried, convicted and sentenced to be imprisoned for six months, to stand an hour and a half in the pillory near the court house in Fairfield in November on some day between the hours of ten and one, to have the lower part of his right ear cut off and to pay costs of £9/6/6. 24 Unhappily for the cause of justice he escaped from jail, though it is npt stated whether any of the pun- ishments had been inflicted on him. 25 In May, 1726, the Assembly considered a request of Samuel Starr that he be awarded £5 in lieu of the counterfeit £5 bill he had received from Seamore and had turned over to Joseph Talcott, Esq., and that he also be granted the reward of £20 due to an informer. The Assembly voted him the £5 but refused him the reward. 26\n\nDaniel Tuttle, who had given such damaging evidence, does not seem to have been prosecuted by the Connecticut authorities. Wyard, too, escaped punishment, for after his examination on March 30, 1724, it did not appear to Joseph Talcott, assistant, that there was enough evidence to convict him, so he was released on bail of £500 to appear before the Superior Court to give evidence against Seamore, Poisson or any other person guilty of making plates, counterfeiting or passing. 27 Despite the fact that Wyard, who seems to have been deeply involved in the affair, was indicted by the grand jury in March, 1724, there is no record of his trial and the case was probably dropped, as he was to give evidence against Seamore and Poisson. 28 With regard to James Poisson, it would be interesting to know why he and his brother, described as \"French refugees residing at Wethersfield ,\" were late in 1708 or early in 1709 warned out of that town by the selectmen. 29 Possibly the selectmen had more foresight than the General Assembly, which voted these refugees permission to live where they pleased in Connecticut .\n\nThe Connecticut authorities were alarmed by the counterfeiting which was being carried on, and the governor and council on February 20, 1724, ordered that a proclamation be issued \"for the more effectual discovery and conviction of such as have been guilty of counterfeiting bills of credit, or of uttering them willingly, or of making any plates or other instruments for such an end, or of counselling, aiding, or abetting any such wickedness.\" 30\n\nIt was natural, no doubt, that the colony should decide on more severe penalties as a deterrent to counterfeiters. In May, 1724, the following law was enacted: Be it Enacted by the Governour, Council and Representatives, in General Court Assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That whosoever shall presume to Forge, Counterfeit, Alter or Utter any Bill or Bills of Credit of this Colony, or of the Bills of Credit of the Provinces of the Massachusetts-Bay , New-Hampshire , New-York, Rhode-Island and the New-Jersies, knowing them to be such, that now are or hereafter shall be by the Law Established, either in this Colony or either of the aforesaid Provinces; or that shall Council, Advise, Procure, or any ways Assist in the Forging, Counterfeiting, Imprinting, Stamping, Altering or Signing of any such false Bill or Bills, knowing them to be such; or Engrave any Plate, or make any other Instrument to be used for that purpose, every Person or Persons so offending, being thereof Convicted before any of the Superiour Courts in this Colony, shall be Punished by having his right ear cut off, and shall be Branded on the Forehead with the Letter C. and be committed to a Work-house and there be confined to Work under the care of a Master till the day of his Death: and never depart from said House without special Leave from this Assembly, under the penalty of being severely Whip't; and that all the Estate of any Person offending as aforesaid, shall be Forfeited to this Government: also the Person so offending as aforesaid, shall be for ever debarred of any Trade or Dealing within this Colony in any wise, upon the penalty of being severely Whip't. 31\n\nEnd Notes\n\n16\n\nBoston News-Letter, Aug. 15, 1723, p. 1.\n\n17\n\nRichard LeBaron Bowen, op. cit., pp. 82–83.\n\n18\n\nS.C.

XV, p. 557.\n\nEphraim Shevie\n\nIn addition to Rushbrook, Seamore, Tuttle, Wyard and Poisson, others were suspected of counterfeiting at times. One such person was Ephraim Shevie, alias John Rideout, who was arrested by Benjamin Judd on December 13 and taken, along with Thomas Stedman and Israel Scias (or Sias), who were with him, to Major Talcott, assistant. The three men were closely questioned by Talcott, who ordered Shevie to be confined in the Hartford jail.\n\nShevie was by profession a maker of sundials, although he had also probably taught school and apparently felt qualified as a teacher. He had been acquainted with Dr. Whipple of Tolland and John Blyn and seemingly knew much about Rushbrook. At his examination he admitted that he had hidden his tools some thirty rods from his lodging but was full of excuses and lies and claimed that he had boasted that he would make a plate for counterfeiting only in jest.\n\nStedman and Scias told a different story, for Stedman said that Shevie had asked if he could have a private room at his house and had told Scias he would make the room into a mint room for making bills. Their account was that Shevie asked Stedman for a new 10s. bill and claimed he would make a plate for it. He also wished Stedman to have ready for him 30s., 20s., and 10s. bills. Shevie likewise had told them he had made a £5, a £3/10 and a £3 plate and had struck off bills from them, the best bills ever made, When asked to show the plates, he said they were in the woods some two miles away. He also promised he would make £300 in bills for Scias and asserted that the best place to finish his plates would be in the chamber of Joseph Butler.\n\nThe authorities now began to question other persons thought to have knowledge of Shevie's money making, among whom was Abigail Conwell of Middletown. She seems to have interested Israel Scias in trying to benefit by Shevie's work and she declared that she had heard Shevie and Daniel Martin talking of making false money and that Shevie had affirmed he could make £1,000 of bills that would not be suspected.\n\nFor some time Shevie had boarded at the home of Nathaniel and Hannah Barns in Middletown. Now Constable Thomas How of that place brought them before Justice Hamblin to be questioned. According to the Barns, Shevie boasted he could engrave a plate for making money if Barns would give him new bills. Barns did give him a 5s. Connecticut bill and presently Shevie produced a plate he had made to print such money and also showed another plate with flowers engraved on it. Barns took the plates away from Shevie's workshop and hid them under the roots of a tree, whereupon Shevie became angry and protested that the plates were worth £50. Once Shevie tried to persuade Barns to ride to New York to bring him supplies for making bills, \"Indian black\" and \"Linset oyl.\" Mr. and Mrs. Barns admitted that they had passed off half of a 5s. Connecticut bill to Captain Nols, the tailor, but, when he declared it false, they took it back. They explained that they got the half bill from Jonathan Prat, a shopkeeper in Wethersfield .\n\nAt his examination on December 20 Shevie admitted he had engraved letters on a plate and also an escutcheon, but only to try his skill. Towards the end of the month, however, he sent the jailer to Talcott to say that he would make a confession. Talcott, accompanied by Justice Cook, went to the jail and Shevie told them that Nathaniel Barns induced him to make the 5s. plate, since Barns wanted to make money to redeem his mortgaged land. The bills came off blotched and Shevie burnt them, while Barns carried away the plate.\n\nShevie was most indiscreet, for at the house of Obadiah Allyn he \"bragged\" in the presence of Daniel Marcom to one Thankful Baker that he could make £5 bills and pulled some from his pocket. When the persons present said they would complain of him, he threw the bills in the fire. On another occasion, at the house of John Williams in Middletown, when Ebenezer Hubbert, Joseph Starr, Williams, Ebenezer Robind and Moses Bidwell were there, Shevie pulled out about £10 in bills and asked Williams if he could change a £5 bill, a £3 bill or one of 40s. or 20s.\n\nAt the next Superior Court in Hartford in March, 1724, Shevie, formerly of Middletown but lately of Wethersfield , was indicted for having made a plate to print the 5s. bill of Connecticut ( Plate XVI). He was tried, convicted and sentenced to be imprisoned, to stand in the pillory and to have his right ear cropped. That same month, writing in prison, he addressed a petition to the judges of the Superior Court. He pointed out that he had already spent sixteen or seventeen weeks in a dark, stinking and nasty jail, with only a little straw for a bed and with poor clothing on him. This was also in the winter, and his bodily health and mind had suffered. He requested that he be not maimed by cropping so as to be debarred from earning his daily bread in any honest employment of schooling or other labor. What town, he asked, would receive him as schoolmaster with a cropped ear? He begged to be released from payment of fines or costs and asked to be allowed to take an oath in secret never to counterfeit and also to act as an informer and agent to seek out counterfeiters and denounce them to the authorities.\n\nBy May he had stood in the pillory and had been cropped. He then petitioned the Assembly, asking to be released and complaining that he now had no straw on which to lie, that he was always in iron chains, that it was bitterly cold and that there had been no fire in March and April. His old outer coat had not been off him at all, and, of late, he had received a short allowance of food, so that he suffered gripes within his body as well as anguish of mind. Perhaps Shevie exaggerated when he wrote of the prison fare, for James Henderson, keeper of the Hartford jail, said he spent seven shillings on Shevie for food and drink instead of the 2/6 allowed. 32\n\nIn September Shevie directed a last desperate appeal for mercy to the Assembly. He had been, he wrote, a prisoner in the Hartford jail for nearly eleven months in close confinement and all the time in iron chains; his suffering was more than tongue or pen could express; he had received his public punishment in May and since March had been given only bread and water, supplemented by a little food sent him by charitable persons; he had no bed to lie on; his breeches were nearly worn off him; his strength was weakened, his understanding was impaired and he was perplexed with vermin. This time the Assembly harkened to his prayer and ordered his release on condition that he leave the colony within one month and with the under- standing that he be imprisoned again if he did not depart within that time or if he again came into the colony. 33\n\nIsrael Scias had the effrontery to ask for the £20 reward as informer against Shevie, 34 but this was denied and it was granted, properly enough, to Benjamin Judd. 35 Barns was indicted in March at the Superior Court held in Hartford for having printed a 5s. Connecticut bill upon a plate of pewter, 36 but there is no record of any trial.\n\nEnd Notes\n\n30\n\nIbid.

At its October, 1724, session the Connecticut Assembly considered the letter which requested that two of the signers of the Connecticut bills be present at Boston on the first Tuesday in November to convict Gardner. Mr. Secretary Wylly, one of the signers, was clerk of the county court to be held at Hartford , and the court was adjourned that he might go to Boston . 39 The Assembly also instructed Timothy Green, printer of the Connecticut bills, to attend the court in Boston to testify against Gardner and to take with him the plate from which the genuine £5 bills were struck. 40 Despite the efforts made by Connecticut , the jury saw fit to acquit Gardner. 41\n\nEnd Notes\n\n33\n\nCol.

( Plates XVII-XVIII) and now in the Connecticut State Library, involved three persons, David Colver of Groton, John Stevens of Windsor and John Williams of Stonington , in considerable difficulty. The story of the bill would seem to be as follows: Stevens got it from one William Dyer in Rhode Island , probably at Kingstown, where a Mr. Sheffield saw it and said he thought it might be false; about January 10, 1724, at the house of John Williams, Stevens offered the bill in payment of his reckoning to Desire Williams, wife of the landlord. She took it to her husband, who questioned it and offered to give 20s. for the 40s. note. At once David Colver, who was present, took it off Williams' hands, giving him an additional five shillings for it, and then passed it later to Jonathan Colver. Jonathan discovered it was false, and, when David refused to take it back, he showed it to Nehemiah Smith, J.P., who went with Jonathan to David. When David again refused to take it back, the justice of the peace took possession of it and it was shown to the treasurer of the colony and declared false.\n\nWarrants were issued for the arrest of David Colver, John Williams and John Stevens, all of whom were bound over to appear at the Superior Court to be held in New London in September. Colver was released on bail provided by himself, John Williams and Moses Fisk of Groton, while Stevens was freed on bail in the same amount provided by himself and John Dean of Groton; Williams also secured a bail bond in the amount of £150.\n\nBoth Colver and Stevens were indicted at the September session of the Superior Court but the grand jury returned both indictments ignoramus and the prisoners were freed by proclamation upon payment of costs. Williams did not appear at the March session of the court in 1725 but his wife informed the judges that he was too ill to attend and he wrote the court a letter to that effect, so that his case was continued to September, when he was indicted, pleaded not guilty, was tried, acquitted and discharged on payment of costs. 42\n\nEnd Notes\n\n42\n\nS.C.

The disposition of the case is not recorded but the informer, Joseph Dewèy of Hebron , asked and received from the Assembly in October, 1726, the sum of £4. 43 Since he did not obtain £20 it is likely that Carrick was arrested and then escaped from jail.\n\nAnother affair of which the outcome is not recorded concerned a Dr. Holloway, who lived in Pomfret or Killingly . An informer complained against him to the governor, who laid before the council an information that Holloway with some other persons in company, have got ingraving irons, molds to cast plates in, colours to print with, and are intending to print false bills in imitation of the true bills of this Colony. The matter of information appears so credible, that 'tis believed something of that nature is practicing. Whereupon it is resolved, That the Governour direct the informer to go to Pomfret t to said Holloway, make furt"
