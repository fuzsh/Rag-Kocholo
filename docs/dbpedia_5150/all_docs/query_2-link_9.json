        "text": "The first English settlers arrived in 1635 and their settlement was originally called Newtown, but was renamed Hartford in 1637. The name \"Hartford\" was chosen to honor the English town of Hertford, home of Samuel Stone, one of the settlers. The congregation of Reverend Thomas Hooker and Reverend Samuel Stone traveled along the Old Connecticut Path from Cambridge to Hartford.The leader of Hartford's original settlers from what is now Cambridge, Massachusetts, Pastor Thomas Hooker, delivered a sermon which inspired the writing of the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, a document (ratified January 14, 1639) investing the people with the authority to govern, rather than ceding such authority to a higher power. Hooker's conception of self-rule embodied in the Fundamental Orders went on to inspire the Connecticut Constitution, and ultimately the U.S. Constitution. Today, one of the Connecticut's nicknames is the 'Constitution State'.\n\nThe Founders of Hartford provides more information about the early history of Hartford at their Early History of Hartford web page\n\nThe Lord family web site provides a special glimpse into the life of Thomas Lord and Hartford in from the time of settlement.
