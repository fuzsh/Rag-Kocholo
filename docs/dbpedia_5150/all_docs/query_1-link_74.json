M. and Elizabeth (Elliott) Hastings.\n\nMr. Elliott's grandfather, John Hastings, who was born in England, came to America, and made his home for some years in Albany, where his son James M. was born about 1797. In 1798 the family removed to the town of Bovina. Here they acquired some wild land, mostly woods, in which bears, wolves, and deer abounded, agreeing to pay the rent for it in wheat. It was in school district No. 14, then known as the town of Delhi. The grandfather cleared a portion of this place, which is still owned by the Hastings family, built a log house, and became an innkeeper as well as a farmer. It was not till 1813, during the last war with Great Britain, that the town was laid out, the first town meeting being held on October 28 of that year. The school-house was furnished with fuel by the farmers, in proportion to the number of scholars sent by their families. Bovina was separated from Delhi in 1820. The pioneer and his wife were Presbyterian church members. He died at a good old age, leaving three sons-- James Madison, John, and Thomas. John Hastings was killed by the fall of a tree which he was hewing down. Their brother Thomas Hastings went to Texas before its annexation to the United States and fought in the Mexican War, but died in Cincinnati, Ohio, on his way home.\n\nJames M. Hastings was brought to Bovina by his parents when very young. Here he grew to manhood, and here he always lived on the same estate, much respected and revered with increasing length of days. In all he cleared two hundred and fifty acres of its timber, and gradually brought the place into order for general agriculture, though with special reference to dairy work. His wife, Elizabeth Elliott, a Scotchwoman bore him four daughters and three sons, of whom five are yet alive. One of the daughters, Magdalen Hastings, living in Kortright, is the widow of James Miller. Janet is the widow of Andrew Armstrong, of the town of Andes. Elizabeth resides in Bovina, the wife of William T. Miller. The two surviving sons are Thomas Elliott and his brother, James Edward Hastings, who resides on the old homestead. The father lived to a serene old age. He was a Republican in politics from the time the party started, and had held minor town offices; but the mother, who, like her husband, was a Presbyterian church member, died in 1865, having been born with the century. James M. Hastings died September 15, 1892, lacking three months of his ninety-seventh birthday.\n\nThomas E. Hastings was born on the homestead, went to the district school, and lived at home till 1852, when he was nearly twenty-three years of age. Then he took up his residence in Bovina Centre, where he opened a store for general merchandise, beginning with a stock worth only twelve hundred dollars. At this time he was in partnership with James Elliott. Two years later, in 1854, Mr. Elliott sold out to W. D. Telford, and the new alliance lasted six years. Then, in 1860, Mr. Hastings bought Mr. Telford's share, and for five years carried on the business alone. In 1866 Mr. J. K. Hood joined him, and they worked together two years, till 1868. Then came another change. This time it was the senior partner who sold out to the junior, Mr. Hood. Mr. Hastings retiring from trade for nearly two years. In 1870 he put up new buildings, where he opened a store which he carried on till 1893, when he sold out to A. T. Doig: who still owns it. There are not many older traders than Mr. Hastings in the county. Though no longer selling general merchandise. he deals in agricultural implements, cattle feed, and land fertilizers. In all his busy years he never kept a clerk, he and his partners preferring to do the work themselves; yet in his last year as a storekeeper the business amounted to forty thousand dollars.\n\nIn 1859, at the age of thirty, he was married to Jane S. Blair, a daughter of Peter Blair, one of the early settlers of Bovina. Mrs. Hastings died at forty-five years of age, in 1886, leaving five children, who all received an excellent education. James Blair Hastings. born in 1860, and a graduate of Hamilton College, is a professor in Franklin. Elmer Ellsworth Hastings, born in 1862, lives in Bovina. He is a graduate of Poughkeepsie Business College. William Elliott Hastings graduated from the Franklin Institute, and is now a clerk in Delhi. Milton Hastings is a pupil at the same school. Their sister, Jennie Mabel Hastings, is at home. Their father is a Republican, and was several years Town Clerk. He is a reliable Presbyterian, as was Mrs. Hastings. Mr. Hastings is never without some good story to tell of the early days of the town; for he is well informed about everything and everybody in town, and can narrate the history of four generations.\n\nAs may be seen from this account of him, Thomas E. Hastings is a very self-reliant man, who might adopt as his own the saying of the celebrated author of \"Don Quixote,\" \"He is best served who has no occasion to put the hands of others at the end of his arms.\" His portrait, with that of his daughter, Jennie Mabel, is a pleasing accompaniment of this outline sketch of his life.\n\nGEORGE AUGUSTUS JUDD, a much respected citizen, and widely known as one of the largest landowners of Middletown, Delaware County, N.Y., is a native of that place, his birth having occurred there August 11, 1825. He is the son of Truman and Lucy (Johnson) Judd, his paternal grandparents being Demas and Elizabeth Judd. The grandfather, Demas Judd, was born in Schoharie County, and was a prosperous farmer, a Whig in politics, and a soldier of the Revolutionary War. He lived to be over eighty years old, his wife being eighty-two at the time of her death. A family of seven children were born to this worthy couple; namely, Demas, Hamilton, Parmalee, Anthony, Marena, Marvin, and Truman. The last named, father of Augustus, was born April 30, 1800. He learned the art of dressing cloth, and found employment in Halcottsville, in Woodstock, Ulster County, Olive, Greene County, and various other places. At last he bought a farm for himself at Red Kill, now owned by George G. Kelly. This he greatly improved, and sold within five years, moving to another farm about a mile away. After residing here some years, he bought a farm in Lexington, Greene County, and lived there ten years. During this time he lost his wife, who died at the age of seventy. Since leaving Lexington, he has resided in Bushnellville, Ulster County, and has now attained the remarkable age of ninety-four. He is a Republican in politics, and is held in high esteem by his fellow-townsmen, who, during his active career, called upon him to fill several town offices. His wife was Lucy, daughter of Luther Johnson, a Revolutionary patriot and soldier. Their family of seven children inherited the sterling qualities of their ancestors, both in independence of mind and business ability, each rearing a family, whose respective members were in their turn prominent and valuable citizens in the localities where they settled. They were as follows: Emily, who married Eli Jenkins, and died, leaving five children; G. Augustus; Demas, who chose for his wife Caroline Garrison, and removed to Minnesota, and had a family of eight children; Elizabeth, who became the wife of Henry G. Cartright, removed with her husband to Illinois, and is the mother of four children; William, who settled in Athens, Greene County, N.Y., and married Hannah Winter, and has one child; Truman, who took to wife Margaret Mabee, and lives in Bushnellville, having two children; Lucy A., who married James Sharp, and went to Illinois, and has two children.\n\nG. Augustus Judd grew to manhood in his native town. Of the first three hundred dollars he earned he lost two hundred by the failure of his employer; but, not discouraged, he kept on in the path which was to lead to success. He began business for himself at the age of nineteen, farming and dealing in cattle and horses, for which he found a market in Dutchess County, but finally buying a farm at Red Kill. This was the beginning of his investments in real estate and in the accumulation of property, in which he has since been so successful. After buying and selling various farms, his operations extending over a period of fifty years, he is now the owner of one thousand acres of land, most of which is highly cultivated and improved. This he has accomplished by enterprise, industry, and good management.\n\nNovember 5, 1884, he married Nancy J. Osterhoudt, daughter of Solomon and Nancy Ann (Bookhoudt) Osterhoudt. Her father, Solomon Osterhoudt, was born in Woodstock, Ulster County, N.Y., and was engaged in the clothing business at Clovesville, Delaware County, N.Y. He married Nancy Ann, daughter of John Bookhoudt, one of the first settlers of Roxbury, and the father of nine children, by name James, Margaret, Sarah, Sidney, Anthony W., Augusta, Jackson, Albert, and Nancy Jane. The maternal grandmother of Mrs. Judd, Nancy Ann Bookhoudt, was born in Ireland.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Judd have two children: Harold O., born April 10, 1888; and A. Hillis, born November 2, 1891. Mr. Judd is a prominent man in Middletown, and highly esteemed for his personal qualities. He has lived an industrious life, making the best of his opportunities; and his example is worthy of emulation by the rising generation. His home is at Griffin's Corners, where he lives a retired life.. He takes an interest in politics, and is a warm supporter of the Republican party. In his religion he is liberal in his views, taking little interest in dogmatic theology, but striving so to live as to have a conscience \"void of offence toward God and man.\"\n\nJOSEPH DARROW, a much respected farmer of Hancock, Delaware County, N.Y., was born December 2, 1818, at Cannonsville, in the adjoining town of Tompkins. His father, Ebenezer Darrow, a descendant of an old family who were among the first settlers of New England, was born in New London, Conn., and followed the trade of carpenter and joiner in Cannonsville and vicinity, having here located his home early in the nineteenth century. He married Electa Lowrey, daughter of Memucan Lowrey. Her father was also a carpenter and joiner, who followed that occupation all his days, and whose family were pioneers of the town of Tompkins, coming there from Connecticut about the year 1800. Ebenezer Darrow died in early manhood. leaving his wife with four children, namely: Joseph, the subject of this sketch; Nancy, who married Nelson Chamberlin, of Cannonsville; Catherine, who is unmarried, and since their mother's death has kept house for her brother Joseph; and Caroline, who married William LaBarr, of Hancock, Delaware County, and moved to Belvidere, Boone County, Ill. Mr. and Mrs. LaBarr have two children: Bradley B., hardware and stove dealer in Belvidere, who married a Miss Jones, of the same town; and Ella, who married a Mr. Cleveland, also a resident of Belvidere, Ill.\n\nJoseph Darrow was educated at Cannonsvillle, and first worked in saw-mills, spending a part of his time farming for Daniel Chamberlin, of that town, the brother of Nelson Chainberlin. Joseph's mother married for a second husband Solomon Jones, of Hancock, and removed to the Jones homestead, which Joseph afterward bought from the heirs of his step-father. After Mr. Jones's death, in the spring of 1845, Joseph went to Hancock to work the farm for his mother. When not farming, much of his time was spent on the river, working as raftsman and steersman for Marvin Wheeler, then the most extensive lumber dealer in this section. He has been through many perilous adventures on the river, the Delaware raftsmen being noted far and wide as a hardy and brave class of men. Often in the roughest weather he was obliged to make the return journey from Philadelphia on foot, sometimes walking fifty miles in a day, carrying his purchases on his back. But in spite of these hardships he is now hale and hearty, and is highly esteemed by all who know him. Unmarried, he lives with his sister on the farm which he has won by his untiring industry. The natural beauty of his estate, which is pleasantly situated on the river, has been greatly increased by tasteful cultivation.\n\nGEORGE G. KELLY is the enterprising and prosperous proprietor of a five-hundred-acre farm on Batavia Kill, in the town of Roxbury. His grandparents were Edmond and Lovina (Liscomb)Kelly, the former of whom during the early part of his life worked on a farm in Putnam County. When the Revolutionary War broke out, he took up arms and went forth to the defence of his home and his country. Edmond Kelly served through the struggle for American independence, and then, with what worldly effects they could bring, plunged into the wilderness with his little family, and at length, after a long and toilsome march through the thick, entangled forests, infested with wild beasts, they reached what is now known as Roxbury. Four or five other families only were settled, so that they had to cope with the rough, rude forces of nature almost alone. The rifle and the axe were equally necessary while Mr. Kelly was erecting his first log house for the protection of his family. Often at night the stealthy step of the prowling panther could be heard as he made the rounds of the little cabin. Game was so plentiful that they lived for weeks on the flesh of deer and bears, and the fine trout which swarmed in the brooks. Mr. Kelly was an indefatigable worker, a man of great energy, with an iron constitution. Politically he was a Whig. He and his wife were both deeply religious. They were members of an old -school Baptist church, and brought up their ten children in that faith. These children were: Charles, William, Abigail, Amy, Martin, Ezekiel, Susan, Edmond Jr., Thomas and Hannah. Edmond Kelly lived to the age of eighty-six, and his wife to about the same age.\n\nMartin Kelly was the second son of Edmond and was the father of George G. Kelly. Martin was born in Putnam County, and came Wet with the father, sharing the hardships, and afterward the blessings of the pioneer home. He assisted his father on the farm and when the opportunity came, worked for others and saved his earnings. When he was old enough he bought his father's farm and a piece of an adjoining one in addition. Martin had had some educational advantages in a district school, and he supplemented what he had there learned with so judicious a course of reading that he became a well-informed man. He had good business ability, his agricultural methods were the best, and he obtained excellent crops from his fields.\n\nMartin Kelly married Alvira Stewart, who lived in Pennsylvania. She bore him eight children--- Edmond, Julia Ann, Syrenus, Stewart, Anna, Ezekiel, George G., and Abigail. As he had become very well-to-do, Martin sold the farm to his son, Edmond L., and moved to Griffin's Corners, where he lived a quiet life. He was a Republican, and held the offices of Supervisor and Constable of the town of Roxbury. Both Mr. and Mrs. Martin Kelly followed their early training, and were loyal members of the old-school Baptist church.\n\nGeorge G. Kelly was born March 18,1836, at Red Kill, on the farm now owned by E.L. Kelly. He received a good education at the red kill district school, and worked at home till he was of age. Then he worked for various people for six years. When he was twenty-seven, he purchased two hundred and seventy acres of and in Middletown. When he had owned this place but a short time, he was offered a price much higher than what he had paid for it, and accordingly, he sold out and bought one hundred and ninety-six acres near Griffin's Corners, owned by John Bookhout. Here he lived twenty years and ten months, putting up substantial buildings and making wise improvements. Finally he sold that estate, and bought his present splendid farm of five hundred acres on Batavia Kill, near the post office of Denver. He has greatly improved this farm since it came into his possession, and it is an interesting place to visit. It is well stocked, well watered and well cultivated. Mr. Kelly keeps seventy-five milch cows, and has large and roomy barns and several other buildings. His house is beautifully located facing the valley, commanding a wide vista of the neighboring farmlands.\n\nAt the age of twenty-seven, Mr. Kelly was united in marriage with Susan Carman, daughter of Richard and Sally (Covell) Carman, who cane from Fishkill on the Hudson. The Carmans were of English descent. Mrs. Carman was a daughter of Samuel and Eleanor Covell. Samuel Covell was born on Cape Cod, October 15, 1779. He died April 15, 1852. His wife Eleanor was born March 1, 1783, and died August 4, 1859. They had seven children--- Edwin, Electa, Caroline, Priscilla, Amanda, Mary, and Sally. Mr. and Mrs. Kelly have four sons, as follows: Derwood B.Kelly married Ida Johnson, lives at Griffin's Corners, and has one child. Delvern H., a farmer married Nettie Hinckley, and lives in Middletown. Ward Kelly lives at home, is a wide-awake, capable young man, and a great help to his father. Cornelius, named for his mother's brother, also lives at home, and is still in school.\n\nMr. George G. Kelly is a Republican. He is an Assessor of the town, and has always been active in politics and interested in the welfare of the community. He is hale and hearty, and has inherited a sound constitution, will no doubt live to a good old age, respected and beloved by his friends and fellow-citizens.\n\nEPHRAIM DANIEL McKENNA, M.D., a successful medical practitioner of Walton, is a man of strong mental calibre, well endowed by nature, with the talents requisite to make him a leader among men. He was born and reared among the picturesque scenery of the Green Mountain State, his birth having occurred in the town of Goshen, Addison County, Vt., April 8, 1860. He is the scion of an ancient Scotch family, and the son of John McKenna, who was born in Canada in 1825.\n\nJohn McKenna left his Canadian home when a small boy, and grew to manhood in Brandon, Vt., receiving his education in the public schools. In 1851 he was united in marriage with Miss Mary Hooker, a daughter of Samuel and Sarah (Joy) Hooker, the latter being a life long resident of Vermont. Mr. hooker was born in Massachusetts, and when a young man removed to Goshen, Vt., where he was one of the very earliest settlers, and built the first framed house erected within the town limits. Thirteen children were born to him and his wife, and eleven of these grew to maturity, the following being their record: Daniel, who settled in Goshen, married a distant relative, Fannie Hooker, of Cattaraugus County, New York Thomas, who remained single, died in Goshen. Joseph, now a resident of Goshen, married a Michigan lady. Heman, who enlisted as a soldier in the late Rebellion, is supposed to have been killed in battle. Rebecca, the wife of Nathan Capen, who has held the office of Town Clerk in Goshen for the past fifty years, died in that place. Sally is the wife of Noah Bisbee, of Brandon, Vt. Levina married Stillman Jones, for many years a hotel-keeper in West Rochester, Vt., but now a resident of LeRoy, Mo. Jane is the wife of Riley Blodgett, of Rochester, Vt. Susan, the wife of James Washburn, a farmer lives in Goshen. Laura died in early womanhood, unmarried. Mary is the wife of Mr. McKenna.\n\nMr. and Mrs. McKenna have spent the many years of their wedded life in the towns of Goshen and Sudbury, Vt., and are highly esteemed citizens. Five children besides the Doctor have been born to them, as follows: Mary J., the wife of Albert Sumner, a prosperous farmer, resides in Brandon, Vt. Annis R. is the wife of the reverend M.M. Mills, a Baptist minister in South Otselic, N.Y. Rev. Erwin J., pastor of the Union Square Baptist Church, Somerville, Mass., married Frankie Jordan, of Newburg, N.Y. Frank J., a railway postal clerk, running from Kansas City to Council Grove, Kan., married Alice Smith of Iola, Kansas. Thomas J., a graduate of the Boston School of Pharmacy, is at present in the drug business with C.E. Browne at Beverly, Mass.\n\nDr. McKenna received his collegiate education at Colgate University, in Hamilton, N.Y. having decided to adopt the profession of medicine, when twenty-two years of age, he became a student in the office of Dr. L. Haseltine, of Brandon, Vt. In 1885 and 1886 he attended two courses of lectures at the Albany Medical College, and subsequently continued his studies at the University of Vermont, receiving his diploma from that institution in 1887. Dr. McKenna then took an examination at Bellevue Hospital Medical College, in New York City, and there received a diploma. He very soon after began his professional career in the town of Hamden, in this county, where he remained until September 1893, when he came to Walton. He has here gained an extensive patronage, and has earned a reputation for professional skill of which a much older physician might well be proud. He is a man much esteemed in the medical fraternity, and is a valued member of the Delaware County Medical Society. He is a prominent member of the First Baptist Church of Walton, In politics, the doctor is a stanch supporter of Grover Cleveland, for whom he cast his first Presidential vote. He is a member of the Walton Lodge of A.F. & A.M. In 1891 he was a candidate for the office of County Coroner, running against a Republican majority of one thousand five hundred, and in the unequal contest went so far ahead of his ticket that he cut down the majority to one hundred and forty-three votes in a most emphatic manner his popularity in this section of the county. He is now Health Officer of Walton.\n\nDr. McKenna was married on February 23, 1887, to Miss Mary Traver. The daughter of Alvah Traver, a well-known attorney of Troy, N.Y. Their pleasant home has been brightened and cheered by the birth of two winsome children, namely: Florence, born September 29,1888, and Jessie, born August 12, 1890.\n\nDAVID G. JENKINS, a prosperous and well-known farmer of Union Grove in the town of Andes, was born in Roxbury, in the eastern part of Delaware County, March 26, 1845, son of James and Mary (Garrison) Jenkins. He was born on the old home farm, and removed when four years of age to Andes, where he grew to manhood, and was educated in the common schools of the town. When twenty years of age, he began lumbering, cutting timber for the manufacturers. He subsequently bought a farm, located one mile from the river on Barkerboom Creek, where he erected buildings, cleared his land and engaged in dairying. He now keeps thirteen fine Jersey cows, his dairy being one of the best in the vicinity.\n\nIn 1863 he married Julia M. Hanmer, by whom he has had nine children, namely Elmer R., who was born January 17, 1865; Egbert P., who was born May 29,1867, and died April 27, 1871; Ada I., who was born January 15, 1870, and married George P. Doolittle, of Fleischmanns, Middletown; Maggie M., who was born February 11, 1875; Mary E., who was born May 5, 1879; J. Garfield, whose was born August 14, 1881; Laura B., who was born December 15,1884; and Bertha V., who was born October 3, 1887. Mrs. Jenkins is a daughter of Robert M. Hamner, whose sketch is given elsewhere in this volume. She and her husband are members of the Baptist church. Mr. Jenkins is a Republican in politics, and was Collector of the town for one term, and has also held the office of Postmaster for four years. He is energetic and industrious, and enjoys well-deserved prosperity, being held in high regard by all who know him.\n\nGEORGE S. ANDREWS, and enterprising and highly intelligent farmer, has resided for fifty-four years on Hamden Hill, in the town of Hamden, Delaware County, N.Y. He comes of good old New England stock, being a grandson of Samuel Andrews, who was born in Fairfield, Conn., about 1766, and married Elizabeth Marion, also of Connecticut. Thirteen children, eleven sons and two daughters, were the fruit of their union. One daughter died at the age of twelve; but all the other members of this large family lived to marry and have children of their own. One son, in fact, still survives, Benjamin Andrews, aged seventy-two, a coal dealer in Brooklyn, New York. Samuel Andrews was a small boy at the time of the Revolution; and in his old age delighted the hearts of his children and grandchildren with exciting tales of those stirring days, the burning of his native town by the British, his escape from the redcoats, and many equally thrilling adventures which he and his parents could vividly remember. He died at his farm home in Stamford, N.Y. where he had been successfully engaged in clearing and cultivating the land; but his wife lived to reach the advanced age of ninety-six.\n\nAndrew Andrews, a son of Samuel and Elizabeth, and the father of the subject of this biography. Was born in Stamford, April 9,1802, and in 1830 married Maria Peak of Hamden, who became the mother of six children, three sons and three daughters, all of whom, with the exception of George S., have passed away. One of the daughters, Docia Ann, lived until her thirty-sixth year. Joseph, a son, died unmarried in 1872, aged forty years. Daniel B., also unmarried, served one year as a soldier in the Civil War, and passed away when forty-five years of age, in 1884. Delia A., wife of William F. Close, died July 23, 1884, in her forty-first year. Hannah, the third daughter, lived to reach her sixty-second year, dying March 3, 1893. Mrs. Andrews died January 29,1859, when fifty-five years of age, her husband outliving her many years, and dying in Hamden, May 23, 1894, at the advanced age of ninety-two. Parents and children sleep side by side in the cemetery at Hamden Hill, resting in peace after lives of faithful toil.\n\nGeorge S. Andrews was born in Hamden in 1833 and here attended the district school, which he afterward taught for four terms. He enlisted in 1864 in the One Hundred and Forty-fourth New York Volunteers, Company C, and served until the close of the war, when he was discharged from the general hospital at Hilton Head, S.C., June 15, 1865. On April 25, 1865, Mr. Andrews married Miss Eunice Ellis of Hamden, daughter of Miles and Ann (Van Akin) Ellis, both of Middletown, Delaware County. Mrs. Andrews was one of nine children, of whom all have passed away, except herself and her brother, Elijah Ellis, of Harpursville, Broome County. Miles Ellis was a volunteer in the Civil War, during which he died of fever in 1864, aged forty-five years, his death being followed by that of his wife three months later. Mr. Andrews first farm consisted of one hundred and thirty acres, which he bought in 1866 of Ely Kent. Besides that he now owns the old home farm of two hundred and ten acres. He carries on a finely appointed dairy, keeping fifty cows, grade Jerseys, and manufacturing superior butter for the market.\n\nMr. Andrews is a Republican, of firm party principles, and has held the position of Assessor for nine years. He is an active member of Bryce Post, Grand Army of the Republic, of Hamden, of which organization he is now serving his second term as Commander. Judicious in the outlay of money for improvements, energetic and industrious, he deserves the success won by his unwearied labors and strictly honorable dealings.\n\nHIRAM H. SILLIMAN, who owns the Silliman homestead in West settlement, is the grandson of Eben Silliman, who came in 1810 from Fairfield Conn., to Delaware County, and settled in the town of Stamford, where he bought a tract of some hundred and fifty or two hundred acres, and laid it out for a farm. The neighbors, among whom Mr. Silliman cast his lot proved very pleasant, and the best of feeling and the most cordial relations were kept up. Mr. Silliman used to tell how he became acquainted with Seth Lyon. He lost his pocket book while surveying his new land; and Mr. Lyon, finding it immediately hunted him up, and in a pleasant cordial way, restored it to him. This little incident was the beginning of a firm friendship. Mr. Silliman lived prosperously and well on his Stamford farm all his life. His wife, whose name was Anna Gould, bore him ten children--- Eben, Jonathan, Abraham, Benjamin, Daniel, Alexander, Anna, Catherine, Caroline, and Ellen. Mr. Eben Silliman's death was a great shock to his people. It occurred in this manner. He was painting a building, when he lost his balance and fell, striking on a picket fence. He was so lacerated and bruised by the paling that the accident was fatal. Mr. Silliman was a Whig, and a member of the Presbyterian church.\n\nAlexander Silliman, whose name is sixth in the above list of the children of Eben, was born in Fairfield, Conn., April 29, 1806, and came to Delaware County when he was but four years of age. He received a scanty education at school, though he afterward became a well-informed man by proper use of his opportunities. At maturity he came into possession of the Silliman estate; but after a short period he decided to sell this property and move away. This he accomplished February 5,1837. He worked farming for a little while, and then went to Michigan, prospecting. He soon returned and bought a farm of one hundred acres in the town of Jefferson, Schoharie County. Here he lived for ten years, working on the land and getting good crops. Then he came back to Roxbury, and bought the present homestead of two hundred acres, one hundred acres of which he purchased of J. Collins, and the other hundred of E.D. Hunter. This land under a system of skilful and thorough cultivation has yielded very gratifying results. The place has been improved by additional buildings and alterations in those already standing. A part of the present dwelling house was built in 1795, and is still in good condition. Here Mr. Silliman lived until shortly before his death, which occurred on August 11, 1882, at the age of seventy-six.\n\nMr. Alexander Silliman was in his early days a Whig, but later he became a Democrat.

Silliman was born in Jefferson, Schoharie County, in the same year in which his father came to Roxbury. The family had been left behind until the new home should be in readiness, and it was while they were waiting that Hiram was born. He received a good education in the district school. At twenty-five he bought the old homestead from his father, and began the management of the farm, which has steadily grown in value and productiveness, year by year the abundant crops bearing testimony to intelligent and faithful work.. On January 5, 1869, Mr. Silliman was united in matrimony with Ruth Keator, a daughter of Daniel, and Mary Keator, who lived at Batavia Kill. Mr. Keator was born in 1800, and lived to the age of sixty-nine years. His father was one of the earliest settlers. Mrs. Silliman had twelve brothers and sisters. Mr. and Mrs. Silliman have two sons.

WHITE, a successful business and popular citizen of Downsville, was born in the town of Colchester, June 28, 1834, a son of PeterV.G. and Charlotte (Sutton) White. He is a grandson of Benjamin and Lovince Sutton, whose genealogy may be found in the biography of Benjamin Sutton, Jr., of Trout Creek. He grew to manhood on his father's farm, and was educated in the public schools of the town. When a young man, he visited his uncle, John White, in Ohio, and there engaged in agricultural pursuits, later taking charge of his uncle's farm of one hundred and thirty-two acres, on which new buildings were being erected. In 1860 he made a visit to his native town, and was there united in marriage to Mary E. Radeker. Returning with his wife to Ohio, Mr. White again assumed the management of the farm of his Uncle John, and cared for him and his aunt until they died, when he sold their farm and removed to Delaware County, settling in Downsville. Here he purchased property in the village, one hundred and seventy-seven acres of Farmland outside the town, and eighty acres of timberland.\n\nMrs. John S. White is the daughter of William and Jane (Campbell) Radeker, biographies of whom are given elsewhere in this volume. She and her husband have one son, Horton V.G. White, who was born March 28, 1868. He received his elementary education in the schools of Downsville, and later attended Walton Academy, and graduated at Eastman's Business College, Poughkeepsie. He married Alice Kater. In company with his son, Mr. White started a hardware store at East Branch, Delaware County, of which they are still the proprietors. They deal extensively in hardware and agricultural implements, and their store is one of the best in the town.\n\nMr. John S. White has been Town Clerk for three terms. He is liberal in religious views, and is highly esteemed throughout the community for his business ability, integrity, and sound judgement.\n\nTHEOPHILUS F. McINTOSH, editor and proprietor of the Delaware Republican, one of the leading papers of the county, has exercised a marked influence on the affairs of this section of New York as a progressive, public-spirited citizen, having aided in guiding its political destiny as well as in promoting its interests materially, socially and morally. Mr. McIntosh is the representative of a well-known family and comes of sterling Scotch ancestry. He was born in the town of Kortright, near Bloomville, November 30, 1829. His father, George McIntosh, was born in the same town, and was a son of Simon McIntosh, whose father emigrated from Scotland, and was a pioneer of Dutchess County. After attaining manhood, Simon McIntosh served as a militiaman in the war of the Revolution, and, subsequently coming to this county as a pioneer leased land from the Kortright Patent and made this his permanent abiding place.\n\nGeorge McIntosh was a life-long resident of this county, and held a good position amongst successful agriculturists. He married Sarah Jaquish, daughter of John Jaquish, a native of New Jersey and the son of a French sailor who made visits to the United States but never settled in America. Mr. Jaquish spent the early years of his life in New York City, but afterward became an honored resident of Delaware County. In the Revolutionary War he served seven years nine months and a day being Orderly Sergeant in General Poor's Brigade, and an active participant on the battles of Monmouth, Saratoga, and Yorktown, besides being in many minor engagements. He also served with General Sullivan in his campaign against the Indians. Six children were born to George and Sarah (Jaquish) McIntosh, the following being a brief mention: Theophilus Fletcher, the subject of this sketch; Perry H., a resident of Chico Cal., unmarried; Delia, who married A.L.Hagar, of Hobart New York and died in 1889 leaving no children; Sophronia, the widow of Joel B. Carpenter, who resides in Walton, and has two children; Walter. who died at the age of twenty-five years, twin brother of Olive, who married Reuben H. Dart, and now lives in Albany, N.Y., with her daughter.\n\nTheophilus F. McIntosh acquired his education in the district schools and the printing office, in the latter place gleaning a vast fund of general information. In February 1843, being then a sturdy lad of thirteen years, and thrown somewhat upon his own resources, he came to the village of Delhi, where he secured the position of \"devil\" in the Gazette printing office. He worked for his board, with an allowance of twenty-five years for clothes, for a period of seven years, becoming well versed in the various duties of a newspaper office, and an expert in the art of printing. With a view to establishing himself permanently in journalism, he next attended school awhile, and then entered the Express office as a compositor, remaining there four years, during that time also serving as assistant Postmaster of Delhi. The succeeding five years Mr. McIntosh spent in Bloomville, working with Mr. Champion of the Mirror. While there he met with gratifying success, and made many warm friends. Among other prominent men of the time with whom he was brought in contact was the late Jay Gould, who was there surveying for a railroad, and who spent most of his leisure time in the office of the Mirror.\n\nIn September, 1858, the Rev. C.B.Smyth established a paper at Delhi, called Star of Delaware, and this was published in the Mirror office, Mr. McIntosh being engaged to do the typesetting. In May following, he and Mr. Smyth purchased a press and material at Walton, and, moving it to Delhi, established a plant which was the nucleus of the present Republican office, Mr. Smyth being editor, and Mr. McIntosh the publisher of the Star of Delaware, which was a small five column, four page weekly paper. In the spring of 1860 Alvin Sturtevant and Mr. McIntosh forming a copartnership, purchased the plant and interest of that paper, and started the Delaware Republican, issuing the first number May 14, 1860. From the first the paper has been strongly Republican in its politics, and during the Lincoln campaign of that year was largely instrumental in arousing the people to a realizing sense of their duties, and spurring on its party to victory, its influence being felt throughout this section of the county. It was then a seven column, four page weekly, and the third Republican paper of the county. In 1864 the Franklin Visitor was purchased and merged into the Republican. The firm of Sturtevant and McIntosh continued until 1868,when the senior member of the firm disposed of his interest to Mr. Joseph Eveland, now proprietor of the Franklin Dairyman. In January, 1869, Mr. McIntosh became the sole proprietor of the Republican, which under his management has lost none of its former prestige, but has steadily gained in strength and popularity. Soon after taking possession of the paper, he enlarged it by one column; and in the spring of 1893 it was changed to a nine column, four page weekly, beginning with the first number of the present volume (xxxiv).\n\nMr. McIntosh has dewvoted his best energies to his work of making a newspaper that should educated its constituency, and keep its readers well informed on current topics and the affairs of this and other countries. This he has accomplished, and the paper is read far and wide, its circulation being fully equal to that of any other paper in the county. Mr. McIntosh, who is a man of undoubted integrity and sound convictions, has served on the Republican County Committee several times, and been delegate to as many as six state conventions, besides numerous county conventions. He was elected County Treasurer in 1869 for a term of three years, and served so satisfactorily that in 1872 he was re-elected for another term of three years. During the Warner Miller Senatorial contest Mr. McIntosh, who was a warm personal friend of Mr. Miller, took and active part in the campaign, which was conducted in a most able manner, although Mr. Miller was finally defeated by Mr. Hiscock.\n\nMr. McIntosh was married in 1858 to Miss Frances S. Keeler, of Bloomville, a daughter of the Hon. Stephen H. Keeler, of Bloomville, and a grand-daughter of the Hon. Martin Keeler, a former Sheriff and judge of Delaware County, and one of the most prominent and influential men of his day. Into their pleasant household circle six children have been born five sons and one daughter. Robert P., the eldest son, is clerk of the town of Delhi, and assists his father on the Republican. Charles K., a railway postal clerk. running between Syracuse and New York City, married Nellie Rogers of Syracuse, and they have one child, Walter. Henry M., who resides in Dexter, Mo., is one of the firm of Frisbie and McIntosh, lumber dealers. George W., formerly an assistant in the Republican office, is now with his brother in Missouri. Frances S., who was graduated from the Delhi Academy, married, and resides at Cazenovia, N.Y. And Frank E. is a student at the Delhi Academy. Mr. and Mrs. McIntosh are held in high regard throughout the large circle of their friends and acquaintances. Religiously, they are both members of the Methodist Episcopal church, of which he is a Trustee.\n\nALBERT P. MINOR, a senior member of the firm of A.P. Minor & Son, of Deposit, N.Y., if the veteran hardware dealer and one of the principal businessmen of the village. The firm has a large trade in stoves, ranges, furnaces, paints and oils, agricultural implements, barbed wire, builders' and blacksmiths' supplies and other goods. Mr. Minor takes a lively interest in all things beneficial to the village, and has aided by his influence and material support the various public enterprises which have made Deposit a prosperous and thriving place.\n\nGeorge Minor, father of Albert P., was born in the town of Coventry, Chenango County, and was very well known in Broome County, having been in business there while a young man. He was twice married. By his first wife, Maria L. Wattles, a native of Walton, Delaware County, N.Y., the mother of our subject, he had two children--- Albert P. and Lydia M. His second marriage was to Ann Eliza Smith, also of Delaware County, by whom he had three children: James S., a sketch of whom appears elsewhere in this work; Henrietta; and the sister with whom she Makes her home, Julia E., wife of William L. Laman, of Coventryville, N.Y. The daughter, Lydia M. is the widow of Sherman Piersol, who was a farmer in Bainbridge, N.Y. Mr. George Minor was a very enterprising man, and engaged extensively in the lumber business in this county. He bought up large quantities to be rafted down the river and to the Philadelphia market. Having made considerable money in various speculations, he put it nearly all into rafts of lumber, which were unfortunately overtaken by an immense flood, and lost. The prospective profits as figured by him had been very large, and the disappointment occasioned by the loss of all was great. This disaster interfered materially with his subsequent business career, for being a strictly honest man, he could not take any of the advantages resorted to by many men under similar circumstances, but as quick as a dollar was secured, it went to pay his debts. The money earned by the boys not of age was used for the same purpose, and to fully meet his obligations was to him the work of life. He was able in this respect to be satisfied, for when he died, all debts had been fully met, everyone of his creditors having received one hundred cents on the dollar. He died in his seventy-seventh year, and no man has ever left a better record for straightforwardness and scrupulous integrity.\n\nAlbert P. Minor was born in Coventryville, Chenango County, N.Y., January 11, 1830. His mother died when he was but nine years old, and he was only fifteen when his father was overtaken with misfortune. So that early in life he was thrown upon his own resources, not having the paternal hand and purse to assist or the advice and love of a mother to encourage and sustain. Having spent the first twelve years of his life in Coventryville, he came with his father to Deposit, returning to his birthplace when fifteen, and when nineteen, coming again to Deposit, to enter in good earnest upon the tasks of real life. He engaged in a hardware store as clerk for Elias Childs, who was doing business on the identical spot where his own store is now situated. He had received a common-school education, supplemented by a brief course of study at Oxford Academy in Chenango County. He had no practical knowledge of business methods; but by diligent application to his work he soon mastered the details, and became an efficient and valuable help in the store.\n\nHe had but five dollars in his pocket to begin with, and his wages were not large, but he managed to save in a few years the sum of five hundred dollars. He had by this time become so thoroughly conversant with the trade that he felt competent to go into business on his own account. Accordingly, in 1853 he formed a partnership with John M. Smith, the style of the firm being Minor and Smith. They put in a new stock of goods at the old stand, and were successful from the first, having a liberal patronage, and realizing handsome profits year by year. They continued in business together for twenty years, and among other additions to it, had built up a carriage manufacturing enterprise, to which upon the dissolution of the partnership, John M. Smith succeeded; and Mr. Minor retained the hardware and other trade in the store. After continuing the business for some years under his own name, in the spring of 1888 he associate with him his son, Clinton S., the style of the firm being then established as it now remains. The firm of Minor and Smith were burned out in 1869, and did business on the other side of the street until the completion of the Minor Masonic Block, into which they moved in the following year. This building, which has since been occupied by the store, is of three stories, forty-five feet by sixty-five, and was erected in 1870 on the spot of the old hardware store.\n\nMr. Minor was married in 1856 to Emily L. Ogden, a daughter of John Ogden of Deposit, and they have one son, Clinton S., who is a graduate of Eastman's Business College at Poughkeepsie, and as above mentioned, the junior member of the firm of A.P.Minor & Son. He was married to Ida S. Dean of Deposit. Albert P. Minor owns, besides the building where he does business, a good residence property on Front Street and the building now occupied by the Courier printing office. He and his brother, James S. are owners of the Deposit Marble Works. He is a member of Deposit Lodge, No. 396, A.F. & A.M. He has held the office of Supervisor, and has long been an active member of the Board of Education, having served continuously since the grading of the schools in 1875. In politics he has been a Republican since the time John C. Fremont was a candidate for the Presidency.\n\nMr. Minor has reached his present comfortable position I life by personal effort, and is held in universal regard as a man of integrity, honor, and ability. He believes the Golden Rule to be the sufficient law for the conduct of social life, and is disposed to judge people rather by their acts than by any profession they may make. He is genial and generous, not given to criticism, but liberal in his views, and willing that others should enjoy that same freedom. A kind neighbor, a judicious counselor and faithful friend, his advice is much sought after, especially in money matters by widows and orphans. It may well be said of him that he has served those truly who have put him in trust.\n\nThe publishers of this \"Review\" are happy in being able to present to their readers a life-like portrait of this enterprising business man and public-spirited citizen, who has done so much toward making Deposit what it is--- one of the most lively and prosperous villages in the Empire State, an important trade center, the seat of pleasant homes and flourishing schools.\n\nWILLIS CRONK, a well-known manufacturer of Grand Gorge, N.Y. was born in this place, May 4, 1855. The great-grandfather of Mr. Cronk was Lawrence Cronk, who with his wife, Nancy Crary, came to New York from Connecticut, and settling near Grand Gorge, carried on one of the earliest taverns in this part of the country.

John, the grandfather of Willis, was born on Clay Hill in the town of Roxbury. When ready to start out in the world for himself, he bought one hundred and twenty-four acres of the D.Lee farm, owned by the Dent family. Selling this later, he bought one hundred and forty acres nearby, put up new buildings, improved the farm, and here lived until his death at forty-four years of age. His wife lived to be sixty years of age, and was the mother of eight children--- Hiram, David, Almanran, Harrison, Lawrence J., Eliza J., John and Isaac.

He attended the village school until thirteen years of age, when he commenced working in the tannery of D. Lafrom, his duty being to grind the bark for the tanning. He afterward was employed by A. Moore in the tannery business and later went west to Oxford, and for three years drove a stage. Returning then to Grand Gorge he worked in the tannery business for some months, after which he bought a farm of sixty-four acres near the village, and for a while employed his time in so improving it that he was enabled to sell it to good advantage. After engaging in several farming investments, he removed to Schoharie County, and thence went to Greene County, where he dwelt for six years, having a farm of three hundred acres, and carrying on a large dairy. Again he came back to Delaware County, and after a short residence here bought the house in which he now lives. His wife was Frances, daughter of Philip and Priscilla (Bangs) Sines, by whom he had eight children---Nettie, John, Willis, Addison, David, Ella, Roma and Frank. Mrs. Cronk died at the age of sixty-three, but her husband is still living. He is a Democrat, and has held the office of Constable several times.\n\nWillis Cronk was educated in Grand Gorge, and worked at home on the farm until twenty-three years of age, when he began working at the carpenter's trade. After two years thus employed, he went into the factory of W.P. Moore, a manufacturer of sashes and blinds. Here he rose to be foreman, and in 1887 bought out the business. He has enlarged and remodeled the factory, and continues here engaged, making sashes, blinds, doors, mouldings, and other accessories of buildings. He has an excellent trade, and all his work is done in the best style and with the greatest thoroughness.\n\nWhen thirty-eight years old, Mr. Cronk was married to Jennie West, daughter of Theodore West, a carpenter of New Haven. Mr. Cronk is a Democrat, and has held several minor offices. Notwithstanding his many business responsibilities, he has shown himself to be a public-spirited man, who his at heart the welfare of his native town\n\nHERMAN F. INDERLIED, of the Inderlied Chemical Company at Rock Rift, Delaware County, N.Y. with his residence at Walton, was born at Lienen, Germany, April 12, 1827, a son of Henry Casper Inderlied, born in Newkirchen, Germany, and Elizabeth Tigges, a native of Lienen.

BOOKHOUT, one of Delaware County's prosperous and progressive dairy farmers, finely located at Batavia Kill, was born in this same town of Roxbury, January 31, 1838, and inherits the blood of two races, the Irish and the Dutch, combining characteristics of the Gaelic and Teutonic peoples. His paternal grandfather was John T. Bookhout, a Hollander, whose wife was a native of Ireland. Both came to America in the latter part of the eighteenth century, after the Revolutionary War, and met for the first time aboard ship, the voyage occupying thirty-six days.\n\nSoon after their arrival on these shores John T. Bookhout and Nancy Smock were married, and at once began farming in Westchester County, New York, where they remained a number of years. In 1808 they came to Delaware County, and bought a hundred acres of wooded land, which lay about two miles above the village of Roxbury. This land they cleared and made arable, putting up new buildings, and making many improvements, Mr. Bookhout having the reputation of an industrious and successful farmer. He lived to the ripe old age of eighty-seven years, and his wife to about the same age. Politically he was a Whig, and supported that party from its organization. Enlisting as a private, he served through the War of 1812, an to the day of his death was a respected and honored citizen of Roxbury. He and his wife had a family of ten children of whom eight grew up; namely, William, James, John, Peter, Anna, Jane, Margaret, and Mary Bookhout.\n\nWilliam Bookhout, the eldest son, was born in Westchester County in 1790, and was therefore eighteen years of age when his father moved to Delaware County. Although young, his labor was equal to any man's in clearing and working the farm, There were no roads by which the farmer could drive to town and exchange his produce for wares that he needed. Every farm had to supply its occupants with nearly all their necessities. To get meal to make the daily bread for the family, William had to carry a sack of grain on his back to a mill some distance away to be ground, his path leading through the woods, and marked by blazed trees.\n\nWhen William was twenty years old, he married Caroline Hull, and bought a farm of one hundred and thirty-six acres in the same section of the county. This farm, which is now owned by Michael O'Hair, was then nearly all new land. Mr. Bookhout cleared it and erected substantial buildings, proving himself a sagacious farmer, and was well known throughout the neighborhood. Like his father, he supported the Whig party in politics; and both he and his wife were members of the Methodist church. He died at the age of sixty, and his wife at sixty-five. They had eleven children, all of whom have married.\n\nIsaac S. Bookhout received only a common-school education; but by home study he prepared himself for a business career, and, being very ambitious, was always on the lookout for a chance to improve himself. When he was fourteen years old, his father died; and he at once took charge of the farm, and looked after the interests of the children. When he was twenty-five years old, he married and bought an adjoining tract of two hundred acres, which is now owned by Caleb Reynolds, in North Roxbury. After clearing and improving the land he sold it, and bought a farm of one hundred and thirty-six acres on Hubble Hill, where he stayed ten years. He then sold that farm and bought his present place at Batavia Kill. The farm is about two hundred and forty-four acres in extent; and it was the first farm settled in this beautiful valley, the former owner having come here in 1794. It is finely located; and Mr. Bookhout has improved it very much, so that it is now reckoned as one of the best dairy farms in the valley. Mr. Bookhout has an excellent dairy, owning many fine cows of different breeds, the farm being well adapted for grazing.\n\nMr. Isaac S. Bookhout married Eusebia Craft; and they have four children, namely: Charles, who was born July 8, 1866; W. Ward, born January 1, 1869, and died October 29, 1889; Lillie F., born May 2, 1871, and died April 13, 1880; and Raymond, the youngest, who was born July 22, 1884, and now lives on the farm. Mr. Bookhout is a Republican, and he and his wife are both members of the Methodist Episcopal church. He is a respected citizen, and a popular man throughout the neighborhood.\n\nJAMES W. PIERCE, a well-known and respected farmer residing in the town of Hamden, about six miles from Walton, was born in Dutchess County August 8, 1822. His father Daniel, and his grandfather, Timothy, were natives of the same county. Daniel Pierce was brought up as a farmer, residing with his grandfather until he came of age, his mother having died when he was quite small. He then started out in the world for himself, first working by the month. Being of a frugal and saving turn of mind, he was soon enabled to purchase a farm in Andes, upon which he resided for some years, then moved to Meredith, where he rented a farm. He spent his last years with his son, James W., dying at the advanced age of seventy-eight. He married Miss Mary Reynolds, a daughter of James and Sarah (Campbell) Reynolds, and a native of Dutchess County. Of this union there were eight children; namely, James W., Elizabeth, Timothy, William, Robert, Daniel, Lavinia, and Marcus. Three of them are still living, namely: James W.; Lavinia, who is the wife of George Foster, and lives in Nebraska; and Robert, a prominent farmer of Walton. Mrs. Pierce died in Meredith, at the age of forty-four years; and Mr. Pierce married for his second wife, Betsey Lockwood, a native of this county. She died at the home of James W. Pierce, aged sixty-two.\n\nJames W. Pierce spent his early years in the town of Andes, where he acquired a common-school education. He assisted his father for a time, afterward working on a farm by the month. He then turned his attention to the blacksmith trade, working at that business for sixteen years. In 1859 he purchased the farm of two hundred acres which he now occupies, upon which he has built a fine residence and commodious barns. He is specially interested in butter-making, shipping it by wholesale to New York City and Newburg.\n\nMr. Pierce was married in 1849 to Miss Frances C. Clark, a daughter of Charles and Catherine (Gay) Clark. The Clark family originally came from Connecticut, the parents of Charles Clark coming to Franklin when he was but eight years old. The mother of Mrs. Pierce was the daughter of Edward Gay, a school-teacher, and the first to teach school in the village of Franklin. Mr. Clark reared a family of seven girls, namely: Clarissa, the wife of Jacob Warner, of Walton; Amanda, who is married to Sylvester Brown; Amelia, married to P. Young; Mary, the wife of Aaron Houghtaling; Aurelia, the wife of William Fisher of Croton; Frances, Mrs. Pierce; Kate, married to Stephen Benedict, of North Walton.

Newton, a daughter of Dr. Newton, and has two children - Sterling and Gertrude F.; Marcus, who married Lulu Frick; Frederick, who is a veterinary surgeon at Oakland, Cal., who married Alice Palmeter, and has one child - Lena; Kate, the wife of the Rev. F. I. Wheat, a pastor of the Congregational church at Woodhaven, and the mother of one son - Charles Irving; Frank, who married Lillie Cook, and assists his father on the farm; Clarence W., who is a clerk; and James R., who is residing with his brother at Oakland, Cal., and is studying for the ministry.\n\nIn 1864 Mr. Pierce enlisted in Company D, One Hundred and Forty-fourth New York Volunteer Infantry, and served for about eleven months, fortunately escaping being either wounded or taken prisoner. He was honorably discharged from the service at Elmira in 1865. He is a member of Benjamin Marvin Post, No. 209, Grand Army of the Republic, of Walton. He is a strong supporter of the Republican party, but has never aspired to any official position. The family are active members of the Baptist church, Mr. Pierce having been a Deacon for a number of years. He is one of the strong representative men of his district, and all his life has been a respected and honored citizen, ever forward and active in those matters pertaining to the good of the community.\n\nCHARLES G. MEEKER, one of the prosperous farmers of the town of Roxbury, was born at the old Meeker homestead, June 27, 1855 being the son of Hiram and Sarah (Montgomery) Meeker, and the grandson of Lyman Meeker. The grandfather came from Fairfield, where he was giving his attention to farming, to Delaware County, and settled on Ross's Brook. The whole place was then a wilderness; and, in looking back, one can but wonder at the courage which so bravely faced the hardships and privations incident to such an undertaking. Nevertheless, he prospered, and cleared the way to a home for himself and a heritage for his children. Lyman Meeker had ten children - Hiram, Abraham, Edwin, Gorham, Philo, Ahaz, Adad, Pauline, Olive, and Deborah. These all lived to grow up.\n\nHiram Meeker, son of Lyman, received his education at the district school in his native town of Roxbury, and commenced farming as an occupation by working for his brother-in-law, Jeremiah G. Benton. At the age of twenty-one he bought one hundred and eighty acres of partially cleared land, and, taking hold of the laborious task, finished clearing the whole tract, laying it out in fields, gardens, and hay-producing meadows. Later in life he took down the old farm-house which had served him and his wife in their first laborious days, and erected a large and attractive new one, with modern conveniences. He also built two barns and a wagon-house, partly of stone. Thus, commencing slowly at first, and steadily progressing, he developed a very fine estate. This energetic and enterprising man lived to be eighty years old.\n\nHis widow, Mrs. Sarah M. Meeker, is still living, at seventy-six years of age. She resides with her son, Charles G. Meeker. Her other children were: Mary, who married C. O. Kilpatrick, lives in town, and has one child; and Emma, deceased at the age of nineteen. Mr. Hiram Meeker was a Democrat. He was Supervisor and Justice of the Peace a long time, and also served as an Assessor. Both parents were members of the Methodist Episcopal church.\n\nCharles G. Meeker was educated in the district school and at the Roxbury Academy. After leaving school, he employed himself about he farm until he was of age. Then he took entire charge of it, and has since been steadily going on with improvements and developing its various resources. Mr. Meeker's farm is a specimen of a fine type of American agriculture. It supports an attractive dairy, and a carefully selected herd of thirty cows, twenty-six of which are pure Guernseys. The farm, being partly in the corporation of Roxbury, is distinguished by the convenient walks which lead all about it. Mr. Meeker deserves commendation for his earnest endeavor to beautify and improve his place, and is an example to those who, having estates, are indifferent to their appearance, or to the improvement of that which they must pass on, as they finally leave them, to their descendants.\n\nCharles G. Meeker married Miss Isabella Cartwright, who was born November 24, 1860, daughter of Almarion and Hannah (Cowen) Cartwright. Mrs. and Mrs. Cartwright had two children - Eber and Isabella. The father lived to be sixty-four years old. The mother makes her home with the son and daughter. Mr. Cartwright was a Republican, but at the time when Horace Greely was so active in politics he changed to the Democratic side. He was a man of use in town affairs. At one time he held the office of Provost Marshal. He was also Justice of the Peace three years, and Supervisor the same length of time.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Meeker have one child, a daughter named Jennie, born September 16, 1878. Mr. Meeker is a Democrat in politics, and he has been a Trustee of the village. He is a member of the Roxbury Lodge, No. 608. He and his wife are both attendants of the Methodist Episcopal church.\n\nTHOMAS H. SCOTT, who owns and occupies a fine farm about four miles from the village of Walton, is by trade a carpenter and builder, and has erected many fine buildings in this vicinity, among others being the United Presbyterian church and parsonage at Walton. He was born in Bovina, June 23, 1852, son of James R. Scott, who was a native of the same town, born there in 1824. His paternal grandfather, Adam Scott, who was born in Deenburnhaugh, Roxburgh County, Scotland, in 1795, emigrated to this country in 1818, and was among the original settlers of Bovina. His marriage with Nancy Russell, which was performed by Squire Maynard, the grandfather of Judge Maynard, was the first marriage in Bovina. He took up a tract of wild land, and began to clear a farm; but, while yet in the vigor of manhood, he was accidentally killed, the pair of horses which he was driving taking fright and running away, and he, being thrown from the sleigh, struck on his head and went through the ice. He left a widow and eight children, the eldest of whom was a boy of twelve years old. A year afterward the mother of these children was likewise taken away by death, leaving the family orphans indeed.\n\nJames R. Scott resided with an uncle after the death of his parents, and, on leaving school, learned the trade of a carpenter and joiner, which he carried on in Middletown and Bovina. For seven years he also engaged in general farming, but never really relinquished his trade. He lived until sixty-five years of age, departing from the scenes of his earthly labors in 1889. His wife was Mary Winter, a native of New Kingston, and one of ten children born to Thomas and Isabelle Winter, who emigrate to New York from England, and, settling in New Kingston, there engaged in agricultural pursuits. They reared eight children, four sons and four daughters, namely: James A.; Thomas H.; Gilbert T.; Andrew; Annabelle, deceased; Mary E., the wife of Jacob N. Thompson, of New Kingston; Fanny, deceased; and Elizabeth. The mother spent her last years in the place of her birth, passing on to the higher life at the age of threescore years. Both parents were conscientious members of the United Presbyterian church.\n\nThomas H., the second son of James R. and Mary Scott, lived on a farm in New Kingston until sixteen years old, acquiring a good common-school education, and, after completing his studies, taught school in the winter for several seasons. He learned the carpenter's trade of his father, as did each of his brothers, and subsequently entered into partnership with him, continuing thus to work until 1884. He then established himself in the village of Walton, where his reputation as a skilled mechanic had preceded him. Many of the finest residences and other buildings of this locality have been built under his supervision, and are standing monuments of his skill and industry. For ten years he conducted the business, being the leading carpenter of the town; but early in the present year, 1894, he removed to his farm, which contains one hundred acres of choice land. He carries on mixed farming and dairying, his specialty being butter-making; and in this business, as in every other in which he has engaged, he is meeting with unqualified success.\n\nThe marriage of Mr. Scott to Jennie Ormiston took place in 1880, when he was about twenty-eight years of age. Miss Ormiston was one of seven children born to her parents, James and Rebecca (McFarland) Ormiston, who were natives of Broome County, and were pioneer settlers of Bovina. Mr. and Mrs. Scott have had their family circle enlarged by the birth of six children, of whom the following are living: Mary; Ralph and Rebecca, twins; and Helen. Mr. Scott is a straight-forward business man, highly esteemed among his friends and fellow-citizens, and in politics is an influential member of the Prohibition party. He and his estimable wife are both members of the United Presbyterian church, in which he has been an Elder for many years, having been elected previous to his removal to Walton. He was superintendent of the Sunday-school for seven years, and Mrs. Scott was one of its most efficient teachers.\n\nGEORGE G. DECKER, one of the shrewd, energetic business men of Middletown, and President of the People's Bank at Margarettville, is a native of Delaware County, having been born in the town of Roxbury, February 15, 1824. His parents were William and Jane (More) Decker, at one time residents of Taghkanick, Columbia County, New York., the former of whom was born January 1, 1795, and was the son of Lawrence Decker, whose wife was by maiden name Caroline Hollenbeck. The latter died before her husband; and Lawrence Decker married again, his second wife being Lucretia Fowler. He was of Dutch ancestry, and came from Columbia to Greene County, buying a small farm near Prattsville, which he cultivated with that untiring industry characteristic of the race from which he sprang. He and his wife Caroline were the parents of five children, one son and four daughters, whose names, reversing the order of sex, were Caroline, Ann, Christina, Phebe, and William.\n\nThe last named, the date of whose birth is given above, was on the death of his parents adopted into the Hardenburgh family, and acquired a practical education in the common schools of Prattsville. His strong commercial instincts prompted him to seek the avenues of trade as the road to fortune; and with but a slender capital he started in the mercantile business, opening the first general store in Roxbury. For some time all went well with the youthful merchant; but his good fortune did not last long, his store being destroyed by fire, with all its contents. Not relishing this experience, he turned aside from the paths of commerce to those of agriculture, and purchased a farm in the town of Andes, the property being known at the time as the Chapman farm, and now forming a part of the site of the village of Andes. Here he resided, engaged in agricultural pursuits, from 1832 to 1843. About the latter year he sold his farm, and, feeling inclined for a change, became the proprietor of the Andes Hotel, which he conducted for some three years. In 1846 he removed to Hancock, and conducted a hotel there for one year, but at the end of that time returned to farming, and died on his son's farm, February 27, 1852. He was an old-time Democrat, and had served in the War of 1812. He held the office of Deputy Sheriff of his county. His wife, formerly Jane More, was born June 8, 1805, and attained the ripe age of eighty years, dying May 28, 1885.\n\nGeorge G. Decker acquired a fair amount of elementary knowledge in the common schools of his native town of Roxbury and Andes, and added to his mental equipment by a course in the Delaware Academy at Delhi. He then took a position as clerk in the general store of the Hon. E. J. Burhaus, remaining so employed for eight years, at the end of which time he became a partner in the business, the firm being known as E. J. Burhaus & Co. Not long after, obtaining an interest in the business, he came to Margarettville, in 1849, and opened a branch store, of which he took personal charge for six years, it being one of the first stores in the village. He then built a store for himself, and continued in the mercantile business until 1876, when he sold out the stock to Mr. Swart, about this time being made Postmaster of the village, an office which he resigned in 1884. The Western loan business occupied his attention from 1889 to 1891, in which latter year he organized and became President of the People's Bank of Margarettville. He was elected President, April 10, 1891; and the bank building was erected in the following year. The bank is a prosperous institution, much patronized by the business men and citizens of Middletown; and Mr. Decker ably fills the office of President. That he has the good will and confidence of his fellow-townsmen is attested by the fact that he has served a term as member of Assembly, and has held the town offices of Supervisor and Commissioner of Schools.\n\nMr. Decker was married in 1849 to Catherine H. More, daughter of Alexander and Sarah (Church) More. The father of Mrs. Decker was a thriving and well-known farmer of Roxbury, and was later a dealer in farm produce. He was the son of Robert and Susannah (Fellows) More, and was born in Roxbury in 1799. His paternal grandparents were John and Bessie (Tyler) More. Robert More, father of Alexander, was a Revolutionary soldier serving in the patriot army, and later becoming one of Delaware County's first settlers. He took up wild land, which he cleared, and became a thriving and substantial farmer, surviving to a good old age. He and his wife reared the following children: William C., who married Susan Newkirk; Susan A., who became the wife of O. A. Preston; Catherine, now Mrs. Decker; Abigail C., who married A. A. Crosby of Rondout; and David F., who married Sarah Hubble, and now resides in Newark, N.J.\n\nMr. and Mrs. George G. Decker are the parents of three children: Susie M., who became the wife of S. W. Marvin, a publisher of New York City, and has four children, whose names are George Q., Alexander B., Eleanor, and Samuel W.; Augusta A., who married O. A. Ewart, and died October 22, 1893, leaving three children - Howard D., Fred M., and Katherine; William M., who married Bessie Smith, is now a prominent physician in Kingston, and has two children - Dorothy and William.\n\nMr. Decker, although engaged in active business, is not unmindful of the things pertaining to the higher life, and exemplifies a practical Christianity in is dealings with his fellow-men. He is a member of the Methodist Episcopal church, and is a power for good in the community in which he dwells.\n\nNATHANIEL CURTIS MARVIN, attorney-at-law of the town of Walton, is a lineal descendant of Reginald Marvin, who sailed from England for America early in the seventeenth century. The emigrant chose New Haven as the place best adapted for his new enterprise; and hither he was soon followed by his brother Matthew, whose permit to cross the Atlantic was dated April 15, 1635. Here Reginald Marvin reared his family; and his son Reginald, who lived at Lyme, and was known in the Indian wars as Lyme's Captain, became the father of Samuel Marvin, who was born in 1671. Thomas, son of Samuel Marvin, and the great-grandfather of the subject of this sketch, was born March 4, 1703, resided at Simsbury, Conn., and died in 1754, having amassed a comfortable fortune.\n\nHis son, Matthew was born at Simsbury, June 7, 1754. When the Revolutionary War broke out, and so many were ready and anxious to fight for their freedom, Matthew was too young to be accepted as an active soldier; but, with praiseworthy longing to take a part in the struggle, he persuaded his uncle to take him as Orderly. And thus he participated in several battles, among which were Long Island, Trenton, Red Bank, Princeton, and Germantown. He was also one of those brave, daring fellows who followed Lafayette in the memorable storming of the fort at Yorktown. He was married at New Canaan, Conn., in 1784, to Mary Weed, of that town. In 1799 they removed with a yoke of oxen and a horse to Walton, N.Y., where he took a grant of one thousand acres of timber land in company with his brother-in-law. This they cleared and improved, transforming it into fine, fertile farms, which continued in the possession of the family until 1865. Mr. and Mrs. Matthew Marvin buried an infant daughter, but reared five sons - Joseph, Jared, Thomas, the father of the subject of this sketch, William and Lewis.\n\nTheir son Thomas was born at Cambridge, Washington County, N.Y., April 20, 1791, and died March 25, 1891. In 1813 he married Dency Tiffany, who was born September 5, 1795, in he town now known as Hamden. She passed away in 1846, leaving eight children: William, born November 28, 1814, who died March 30, 1889; Thomas Edwin, born in 1816, who resides in Walton; Andrew J., who was born in 1819, and died in Brooklyn, N.Y., in 1877; Joseph Tiffany, who was born in 1822 and now lives in Kansas; Nathaniel Curtis, the subject of this sketch; Frederick Foote, born in 1828, at present also in Kansas; Elizabeth Crane, born in 1830, who is the widow of the Rev. J. P. Root, of Boston, and has two daughters, both of whom are missionaries in India; and Matthew W., of Walton.\n\nNathaniel Curtis Marvin was born March 3, 1826, in Walton, and grew up on his father's farm, receiving his education in the district school and in the academy of Franklin. When but twelve years of age, he began to read law with Judge Isaac Ogden, and at sixteen entered the law office of N. K. and T. H. Wheeler. He lived at home, and his time was fully occupied with farming and reading law. He was deeply interested in the State militia, and in 1849 was elected Captain of Company A, Sixty-ninth Regiment, being made Colonel in 1851. November 7, 1850, he married Miss Julia A. Fitch, who was born in Walton on Christmas Day, 1831, daughter of Nathaniel and Sally (Benedict) Fitch, both of whom were natives of Connecticut, but removed to New York when very young.\n\nNathaniel Fitch was born in 1797, and brought to Walton when but five years of age. The Benedicts had moved here in 1797, and Sally was born in 1799; and here both Mr. and Mrs. Fitch died - she, February 16, 1879; and he, August 12, 1872. They were the parents of five children, namely: Sarah, wife of Dr. E. Southard of Franklin; Julia, Mrs. Marvin; Lyman M. Fitch, of Kansas City, Mo.; George and Augustus, both of Walton. The ancestors of the Fitch family were silk manufacturers in France, who at the time of the Huguenot persecution fled to Germany, and thence to Holland and England.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Marvin buried their only son, Nathaniel Curtis, Jr., aged two and one-half years, on October 20, 1869. They have living four daughters: Alice Augusta, widow of T. Porter Lanfield, who has one daughter, Ella: Eliza Flora, wife of Charles B. Bassett; Julia Fitch, wife of Benjamin G. North; and Cora Belle, who married Mr. J. Terknile, [Jacob TER KUILE] and resides in New Jersey, being the mother of two sons and one daughter.\n\nMr. Marvin was a radical Democrat of the old Jackson and Jefferson school, voting for Martin Van Buren and Fremont; but on the organization of the Republican party he espoused its cause as that of true Democracy, and has ever since been its stanch defender. Although he never aspired to be an office-holder, he reluctantly consented to serve as a candidate for State legislature, taking the field only nine days before the election, and was elected in a Democratic district. He served in this position during 1878 and 1879, his influence for good being felt throughout that body. Mr. Marvin is an honor to the worthy name he bears - generous, manly, judicious, and conscientious; a devoted husband and father, and a faithful friend; a citizen whose life is an example of integrity and uprightness which young men might be commended in following.\n\nJAY GOULD was born at West settlement, Roxbury, Delaware County, N. Y., May 27, 1836, son of John Burr and Mary (More) Gould. The Gould family is of English extraction, its founder in this country, Major Nathan Gold, having left St. Edmundsbury, County Suffolk, England, in 1646, to settle in Fairfield, Conn., where he soon made his influence felt as a foremost citizen. He was one of the signers of the petition for the charter of the Connecticut Colony, 1654, which petition \"was signed by no gentleman unless he had sustained a high reputation in England before he came to New England.\" From 1651 until his death in 1694 he was a member of the Connecticut Colonial Council, which corresponded to the State Senate of to-day.\n\nA grandson of Major Gold, Colonel Abraham Gold, married Elizabeth Burr, thus connecting the Gold family with another of equal prominence. Abraham Gold was Colonel of the Fifth Regiment in the Revolutionary army, receiving his commission from Governor Trumbull. Early in the war he was killed while leading an attack against the English under General Tryon. His sword is still preserved, now being in the possession of his namesake, Abraham Gould Jennings. The Colonel's fourth son, Abraham, was commissioned as Captain. At the close of the war, when New York was the \"West,\" and sturdy men from Connecticut were pushing their way across the border, this Captain Gold led a party from Fairfield into Delaware County, where he took upland in what is now known as West settlement, Roxbury. Here was born his eldest son, John Burr Gould, the father of the subject of this sketch. The wife of John Burr Gould was a grand-daughter of John More, a Scotchman of Ayrshire, who emigrated in 1772, and of whom a sketch is to be found elsewhere in this volume.\n\nAlmost all of Jay Gould's school education was received before he was fifteen at the schools of the district, the private school supported by his father, and a few other progressive men of the settlement, and at the Hobart Academy, where he partially paid his own expense by keeping books outside of school hours. As John Burr Gould had succeeded Captain Gould in the ownership and care of the farm, so it was expected that Jay would, in turn, succeed his father; but he showed such a distaste for farm life that his father exchanged the farm for a store in the village of Roxbury. At the age of fifteen Jay not only kept the books, but did all the buying; and he was soon taken into partnership. His extra time was spent in the study of surveying; and before he was sixteen he was doing practical work, at first as an assistant, then as a projector and leader of expeditions. He made several maps, the most important being that of Delaware County, which is still a standard.\n\nWhile travelling over the country as a surveyor, he became interested in the reminiscences of the old settlers. He took notes, followed up lines of investigation, and in an incredibly short time he had ready the first History of Delaware County. To state that the manuscript was burned at the printers, and that nearly all of it had to be rewritten from memory, is to give but one instance of these remarkable Traits of energy and perseverance and power of concentration and memory which were key-notes to Mr. Gould's character. Before this book had been returned from the printers, Mr. Gould had met Colonel Zadock Pratt, of Prattsville, who, recognizing at once the young man's ability, did not hesitate to enter with him into a large tannery enterprise in Pennsylvania. With almost the quickness of thought, a village sprang up in the forest, with its tannery, church, school-house, and post-office, with a plank-road leading to the nearest town, and a stage route connecting with the outside world.\n\nThe prosperity of the business world soon enabled Mr. Gould to purchase Colonel Pratt's interest, and enter into partnership with a New York firm. The partnership and the necessary dealing with the wholesale houses led Mr. Gould frequently to New York. Here he met men of larger interests, one of whom, who had watched Mr. Gould's astuteness and quickness in dealing with difficult situations, asked his assistance in extricating from financial embarrassment a small railroad in Vermont. The accomplishment of this undertaking gave evidence of Mr. Gould's peculiar ability to build up a flagging enterprise, and it launched him on his life work. Henceforth his interests were centered in railroads and kindred enterprises, as steamship and telegraph lines. To enumerate in order the railroads that gradually came under his management would be to trace the development of those parts of our country through which those railroads run, especially of the great West and South-west.\n\nThe Vermont railroad on a firm footing, Mr. Gould became interested in the Cleveland & Pittsburg road, which he built up in the same way. The Erie next engaged his attention, then the Union Pacific. At the time of his death Mr. Gould was a director in numerous railroad and other companies. But his greatest enterprises, familiar to all, were the Union Pacific, the Missouri Pacific, the Texas & Pacific, the Western Union Telegraph Company, and the Manhattan Railway. He amalgamated rival telegraph companies, and became the head of the Western Union Telegraph system. He obtained control of the Union Pacific and the Manhattan when they were on the verge of bankruptcy, and soon made of them paying companies. And he laid the foundation of the great Missouri Pacific system.\n\nMr. Gould amassed a colossal fortune, and died at an age when many men are but beginning to reap the fruit of their labors. But into his first twenty-one years had been crowded the work and experience of many an average man's lifetime. Denied the longed-for educational advantages, and busy all day, he grasped every opportunity to learn, spending the early hours of the night in reading and study. He had a remarkable knowledge of human nature, gained by his business contact with men of all classes. And, aside from the practical use of his knowledge of surveying, his work in that line had quickened his natural capacity for detail.\n\nJanuary 22, 1863, Mr. Gould was married to Helen Day Miller, of New York, daughter of Daniel S. Miller, a descendant of an English family which settled at Easthampton, L. I., in early Colonial days. The children of this union are: George Jay Gould, born in 1864; Edwin Gould born in 1866; Helen Miller Gould, born 1868; Howard Gould, born in 1871; Anna Gould, born in 1875; and Frank Jay Gould, born in 1877. Mrs. Gould died January 13, 1889; and Mr. Gould survived her but a few years, his death occurring December 2, 1892.\n\nMr. Gould had promised to assist the congregation of the Reformed church of Roxbury in rebuilding their church, which had been burned to the ground with all its furnishing. This society is the oldest of the Reformed Church in Delaware County. Jay Gould's mother had been a member of it; and, as a boy, he had attended its services. But his death occurred before any plans for rebuilding had been matured. To fulfil his promise and to erect a desirable memorial, his children built at the expense of about $100,000, and deeded to the church, a house of worship which is the pride of the village. The corner-stone was laid September 20, 1893; and the services of dedication were held on October 13 of the following year. The infinite care and loving thought bestowed upon ever detail has resulted in making this church not only an object of great beauty, but one most perfectly adapted to all its uses. It stands on a slight eminence, surrounded by a well-turfed lawn, in the most attractive part of the village, and is built of St. Lawrence marble, the interior being finished in Indiana limestone and quartered oak. The tiled aisles, the mosaic floor of the pulpit, the six large windows of stained glass, add to its beauty. The minister's study and the church parlor and kitchen are also supplied to the minutest detail. The church throughout is lighted with gas, to which convenience are added a good water supply and perfect drainage. In one transept is the pipe organ. The other is arranged for a Sunday-school room, with all appropriate furnishings.\n\nREV. JULIUS PATTENGILL, of Walton, Delaware County, N.Y., was born in the town of Canterbury, Conn., February 20, 1810. His father Horatio, who was born in Lisbon, Conn., in October, 1777, was a son of Lemuel Pattengill, a native of the same town. Three of his sons - John, Benjamin, and William - were soldiers in the Continental army, serving all through the war. John settled in Lawrence County, New York, and was nearly one hundred years old when he died. He was one of the last eleven pensioners of the Revolutionary War, all of whom passed away within one year of his death. Benjamin went South, where all trace of him was lost. William settled on the Green Mountains, dying there at an advanced age. Lemuel was Captain in the War of 1812, and was wounded and taken prisoner at the battle of Queenstown, Canada, and was soon afterward paroled.\n\nHoratio Pattengill was married to Miss Thankful Cady, who was born February 24, 1783, at Stephentown, Washington County, N. Y. She was the mother of six children, namely: Evan, died, aged eight months; Horatio, died at Corning, N. Y., in his eighty-seventh year; William, died at New Lisbon, in his eighty-sixth; Pauline, wife of Parker Scott, died in Milford, Otsego County, 1842, aged twenty-eight years; Eliza, wife of D. de Forest, died at Oberlin, Ohio, in 1873, aged fifty-six years.\n\nJulius Seneca Pattengill, the fourth member of the family, was engaged on the home farm until he arrived at his twentieth year, when he taught school for some ten or more terms. In 1838 he graduated from the Oneida Institute and commenced the study of theology with the Rev. A. E. Campbell, of Cooperstown, N. Y. He was ordained in 1840 at New Berlin, where he was engaged in pastoral work for nine years. Coming to Walton in 1848, he remained as pastor of the Congregational church for twenty years. He next went to Homer, N.Y., where he was employed by the State Temperance Society for one year, and from there went to Bainbridge, and was afterward two years at Holland, Oneida County. Returning to Walton in 1883, he was for seven years pastor of the Cannonsville Presbyterian church, and from that time has not been in continuous active work, but has preached as an occasional supply, having been a servant in the vineyard of the Lord for fifty-six years. He was instrumental in establishing the academy at New Berlin, and obtained every one of the pledges for the erection of the Walton Academy, which school is one of the best of its kind in the State.\n\nRev. Mr. Pattengill was married on October 8, 1839, to Miss Phoebe H. Mosher, of Laurens, Otsego County, N. Y. Four children were the fruit of the union, namely: Frances A., wife of George O. Mead; Catherine E., who died, aged eighteen years; Mary M., wife of Charles Norton, died in 1881, aged thirty, leaving two children; William H., a resident of Walton.\n\nMr. Pattengill is possessed of a physical and mental vigor which years have not seriously impaired. He has been indefatigable in his labors as a sower of precious seed, having on occasion preached the word four times in a long summer day, and three times in winter days. Full of years and meekly wise, he is justly venerated as one who has led many in the way of righteousness.\n\nWILLIAM BRINKMAN, the competent Postmaster of Franklin, N. Y., is one of the best known and most highly esteemed citizens of this place. His father, Dedrick Brinkman, was a native of Prussia, where he was born in 1806, and learned the trade of cabinet-maker, at which he worked for seven years near the family home. In 1830, with no fortune except his own willing hands, he sailed for America, the voyage being an unusually quick and pleasant one. He married in this country Elizabeth Vareschorst, of Germany; and until 1844 they resided in Catskill, after which they removed with their three children to Roxbury, Delaware County.\n\nHere for eight years Mr. Brinkman followed his trade, and then purchased a small farm in that town, which he sold at the expiration of two years to buy a larger one of three hundred acres near by. This the family occupied until the fall of 1865, disposing of it then, to remove to their new home of one hundred and sixty acres, about two miles above Franklin village. This, also, was sold two and a half years later, when Mr. Brinkman bought the farm on which he resided until his death, resulting from an accident with a runaway horse in 1880. His widow now lives with her daughter in Roxbury. Mr. and Mrs. Brinkman buried and infant, and reared ten children to maturity, seven sons and three daughters, of whom six sons and two daughters still survive. They are: Lewis, Otis, George H., and William in Franklin; Edward and Charles in the West; Mary, wife of George Silvernail, in Florida; and Eliza, wife of Joseph Dart, at Roxbury. One of the sons, Henry C. Brinkman, was a volunteer in the Civil War, enlisting in the Eighth Independent New York Battery, and dying of malarial fever at Whitehouse Landing, June, 1862, when but twenty-one years of age. A daughter, Clara, for many years a successful teacher, died in the prime of life.\n\nWilliam Brinkman was born in Catskill, Greene County, July 8, 1840, and received his early education at the district school and the Roxbury Academy. In October, 1861, he enlisted in the same company with his brother Henry as a private, re-enlisting November 21, 1863, and serving to the close of the war, when he was discharged, in June, 1865. Although he was in active service throughout the terrible struggle, with the exception of three months during which he was a patient at the Chesapeake Hospital, a victim to malarial fever, he escaped shot, shell, and prison, and, after peace again reigned in the land, returned to Roxbury, later removing to Franklin, where he was engaged on his father's farm. Mr. Brinkman then spent six months sight-seeing in Nebraska and the West; but, as this was at the time of the great grasshopper scrourge, his impressions of that extensive region were not as favorable as they would have been under different circumstances.\n\nOctober 5, 1869, he married Miss Marion E. Kingsley, of Franklin, who received her education at the Delaware Institute, and taught seven terms previous to her marriage. Mrs. Brinkman was the daughter of Bradford Kingsley, of Franklin, who died in 1877, aged seventy-three years, his father, Bradford Kingsley, Sr., having moved from Connecticut and settled on a farm in Franklin over ninety years ago. Her mother Mary A. Greene, of Saratoga, passed away when seventy-eight years of age at the old homestead in Franklin, which passed out of the possession of the family only a few years ago. Mrs. Brinkman has two sisters and one brother, George B. Kingsley, of Coventry, now living. Her maternal grandfather was Roger Able, the first white person to be buried in the town of Franklin. He died at twenty-eight years of age, soon after settling here; and his remains were drawn on an ox sled to Bartlett Hollow, where it was then supposed the town would be built. The wife of Roger Able experienced an exciting adventure in the early pioneer days. She was riding her horse along the bridle-path just over the hill from Franklin, when a panther sprang before her with flashing eyes and open jaws. The screams of the frightened woman drove the ferocious creature from the path, and brought to her rescue a workman from the neighboring forest. In the excitement Mrs. Able had lost her saddle, but had clung to her horse. After her husband's death she removed to Saratoga County, where she died at an advanced age.\n\nIn 1873 Mr. Brinkman sold his farm and, with his family, removed to Franklin, of which town he was appointed Postmaster in 1885, serving four years, being reappointed in October, 1893, and still serving in that capacity. He is a charter member and First Adjutant of the Grand Army of the Republic, Post 132, of Franklin, of which he has been Commander for six years. He is an enthusiastic Mason, having belonged to that organization for the last twenty-nine years, and having served as Master of the Lodge at Franklin for five years. He is a Royal Arch Mason, being a member of Unadilla Chapter, No. 178, and also is a member of the Susquehanna Lodge, of the Scottish Rites degree. About thirteen years ago Mr. Brinkman purchased his present home in "
