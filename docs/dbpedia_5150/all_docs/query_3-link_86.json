        "text": "Like John Singer Sargent, Boscoe Holder painted a large number of. dynamic male nudes, boasting a deft spontaneity and fluid sensuality. Not exhibited during his lifetime, apparently, they were painted purely for the artist’s pleasure.\n\n“I met Boscoe at a party in Port-of-Spain.” said a man who encountered Geoffrey Holder’s then still charmingly spry older-artist-dancer brother in 1990. “Afterwards, he invited me to his home for drinks, where I met his wife as well. Besides having some of his paintings on display, his house, in an older, mixed-income section of the city, struck me as a treasure trove of memorabilia.”\n\n“Boscoe, was pretty openly bisexual. If you met him, you would assume he was gay. We had lunch a few days later, at which he offered to procure for me as a favor whatever I wished in the way of a male Trinidadian…His attitude towards gayness was what I would call “old school”: It was a recreation, a pleasure, but the idea of a committed gay couple seemed an absurdity, to him…”\n\nOne hardly overlooks the long and productive marriage, the evident enduring love and commitment of Geoffrey Holder and Carmen de Lavallade, the beautiful and gifted dancer and choreographer, or their son Leo Holder. But it is this attitude and taste, for casual, recreational homosexual activity, that I believe Geoffrey Holder shared in common with his older brother and many others\n\nEight years ago Geoffrey Lamont Holder was laid to rest. Some might imagine that raising the question of his sexuality lacks respect and is immaterial to his greatness, or anyone else’s. But whatever he was, and all that he was, made him the person we so esteem. To hope to alter any part of his makeup is as futile as attempting to hold back the tide at full moon. Still many people, particularly, of a certain age, contend sexuality is of little consequence today. “Gays march nearly naked on parade!”, they say, and “marriage equality has become the law of the land.”\n\nSome years ago a great pal of mine and his wife of 20 years divorced. Most of his friendships, including our friendship, precluded his revealing the cause of his traumatic feelings of hurt and loss. But he did confide in his cousin, who revealed what had happened to my friend’s mother. She told me my shocked friend’s wife had informed him, out of the blue, apropos of nothing, one night following a delicious dinner:\n\n“I’m not happy, I want a divorce…” ‘But, how long? How long have you felt this way?’ “For about the past 18 years,” ‘But, that’s most of the time we’ve been together!’\n\nMy friend answered, starting to weep. Only once they sold their green shingled house in Berkeley, after my friend moved back to Harlem, did he learn that his ex was a lesbian. She married her girlfriend soon after their breakup.\n\nAs for Mr. Holder, whatever he was: Gay, straight, bisexual, larger than life, extraordinary, difficult, a joy; unhappy, he was not!\n\nNot everyone is. In his final decade, by which time he was a multi-millionaire, without a trace of irony or even a hint that he recognized how ridiculous his denial might appear to many, my friend Bobby Short, who nearly married, more than once, commented\n\n“I have a living to make! I can’t afford to march in the Gay-Pride Parade.”\n\nUndoubtedly in part motivated from fear of such changes as much as from malice, on Malcolm X Boulevard, in the heart of Harlem, a church displays an enormous sign as hateful as any message ever offered by the KKK. Surmounted by a lighted cross, it’s changed periodically. When he started campaigning and afterward all during his administration, routinely it denounced President Obama. Today mostly it incites, supposedly Biblical based, violence towards “white gentrifiers” and “homos.” “Jesus would stone homos…” is one example but, “Obama has released the homo demon on the black man, look out black woman. A white homo may take your man.”, is my favorite. Reminiscent of sermons I have listened to exasperated, calling out the “sin” of a “man lying with a man” while giving a pass to far, far more pervasive heterosexual “fornicators”, it prompted me, well knowing my community, to think, ‘what about white women?’\n\n‘DL’, down low, undercover same-sex activity is, all the same, a constant of black life. With the advent of the internet indeed, all manner of unconventional sexual expression has found an outlet to flourish. Transgendered, Islan Nettles, just 21, was befriended by Paris Wilson on Facebook. Some say they started a relationship, that Wilson had reason to be fully aware of Nettles’ identity. But it’s alleged, that gathered with his friends, across the street from the A6 police headquarters, a public housing police station on Frederick Douglas Boulevard near West 147th Street, things were different. Confidently, he made a pass at his Facebook friend. But once one of his crew announced Islan was a “faggot”, transgendered, Paris Wilson, to save face some say, struck her forcefully. Once, and then again, He continued the beating after she had fallen to the ground, leaving Islan unconscious, with one eye swollen shut and her delicate face streaming with rivulets of blood. Rushed to Harlem Hospital, falling into a coma, Islan died the following week.\n\nInitially charged with misdemeanor assault, when another man came forward to say he was the culprit, too drunk to remember what exactly had happened, college bound Wilson was let go. Prosecutors declining, to bring either man before a grand jury, the sordid case remains open.\n\nThinking of innumerable luminaries over the centuries, Oscar Wilde, Stanford White, Adrian, Cary Grant, Patrick Dennis, Countee Cullen, Lorraine Hasberry, Leonard Bernstein, Audre Lorde, David Hicks, Samuel Delany, Carter Burden, Nick Ashford, John Travolta, and many more, youth today, unencumbered by yesterday’s shame and stigma, might ponder, ‘Why on earth would someone gay pretend they were not, even going to the great lengths of marrying someone straight and having children together?’ Michael Jackson’s and Whitney Houston’s singular saga’s often give rise to this dogged conundrum. Gore Vidal said it might be due to how once men near 50, troubled thoughts of reproducing oneself become ever more acute.\n\nDiffering doctrines aside, almost everywhere around the globe, gays are despised! Keeping women submissive and hating gays seems to be something all religions can agree on. However weird or odd or scary Michael Jackson became, irrespective of disfiguring mutilations and seemingly aberrant behavior, by the ruse of maintaining he was straight, Michael continued to be loved. Conversely, the contempt of gays is so potent that questioning if someone regarded as heterosexual, might instead to have been gay, is considered by some a libelous condemnation, an unforgivable slur.\n\nHowever, question one must, the lives of those suspected of seeking to ‘pass’ undetected. Believing black is beautiful, and gay is good, there is neither judgement nor denigration intended in this exploration: merely a reclamation by which heroes are acclaimed, and gays are redeemed.\n\nMarvin Smith and his twin brother, Morgan, are a good case study. Marvin was gay and Morgan was straight. But soon after they ventured from Kentucky to Harlem seeking greater artistic opportunities as photographers, they married the Brown twins.\n\n“I was just going along with my brother. The night before our double wedding I spent the night with a fellow I picked up in Central Park. We married in 35 and we both divorced in 1938.”\n\nAfter Morgan Smith remarried Monica Myles, without consulting him, Marvin Smith retaliated. He enlisted in the Navy. In the Second World War’s segregated military, as ship’s photographer, with a dark room where even officers were obliged to knock when the red light outside was on, Marvin had numerous joyful escapades. Meeting him, gaining his confidence and having him relate his “secret” gay life to me, while there was still time, was the most marvelous gift I’ve ever been given. For one thing, he reinforced what I already suspected, that not everyone is gay, but in his day, lots of men would lay back and allow one to go down on them. “That never turned them gay, but they enjoyed it and so did I,” he told me:\n\n“Harry Belafonte was a big friend of ours. Our studio was next to the Apollo on the second floor. If he was performing or seeing someone at the theater, often he’d crash at our place. Without discussing it we developed an understanding. The time was going to come for us to be together. And then, the moment did come. But, just then a mutual friend appeared out of nowhere. And, Harry went off with him. The next morning he returned to have breakfast with me and my brother and proceeded to give a blow-by-blow account of the night before’s action. “That faggot did this!” he said. “And, that faggot did that.”\n\n“I determined in an instant, then and there, I would never have anything sexual to do with Harry; I did not want him talking about me the way he spoke of our friend.\n\nAh, but as for Sidney, in the privacy of the studio, that was an entirely different story!”\n\nWith the gay identity of Langston Hughes and George Washington Carver down-played, a concurrent effort to retroactively “straighten out” august gay icons of longstanding, is gaining intensity.\n\nExperiences in the military and prison show conclusively, that sexual relations between men do not inherently ‘betray’ a gay identity. They do however show something more valuable, the humanity of those who are LGBT. We posses no malevolent ability, to either diminish or harm heterosexuals, not to any greater degree than straight women or men at least. This is why same-sex adventures enjoyed by colossal personalities like Josephine Baker, Malcolm X, Chester Himes, Maya Angelou, Harry Belafonte and Sidney Pottier are so illuminating. Nowadays though, even the bold James Baldwin’s sexuality is often obscured, by those out to manufacture a more palatable type of hero.\n\nThe inducement of a family fortune helped to influence many white gays like Carl Van Vechten, Harold Vanderbilt, and Cole Porter to ‘settle down’.\n\n.\n\nThe life-long lesbian lovers were introduced at one of the phenomenal parties of heiress A’Lelia Walker, by Edna’s husband, Lloyd Thomas.\n\nOlivia immediately expressed her pronounced attraction and in un-uncertain terms. Taken aback momentarily, Edna’s reaction was an aloof iciness. But, calling to apologize, asking if she might come over to say goodbye, Olivia was not rebuffed a second time. No sooner had Edna related that even her “initial response had not been as indifferent as I’d pretended,” than Olivia had aggressively pounced and ravaged her! Married to a man for the third time, Edna confessed how never before that day had she ever experienced an orgasm.\n\nMarried to distinguished black research scientist Elmer S. Imes, who taught at Fisk University, novelist Nella Larsen, was a member of the ‘sisterhood’ headed by Thomas and Wyndham that centered around intimate weekends parties at Minedo Farm, their country place near Sandy Hook, Connecticut.\n\nWinning the Harmon Foundation’s bronze medal in 1929, a few years later, accused of plagiarism, Larson was disgraced and abruptly cut ties to all her former friends including Wyndham, Thomas and the Van Vechtens. Divorced and working as a nurse in obscurity, this writer whose work explored the confused social, sexual and racial boundaries of 1920's Homo-Harlem, died alone.\n\nAs for Philip Johnson and Jimmie Daniels, whom the architect later termed “the first Mrs. Johnson”, gradually they too drifted apart. Johnson maintained, that when they parted, “I was sadder than I’d thought I might be,” and that the passionate youth Jimmie had, “probably left me for someone who was better in bed…”\n\nJohnson’s inability to protect his black boyfriend from the indignity of fancy restaurants failing to provide service on account Jimmie’s color and his admitted failure to consult, consider, or always include him at parties and on trips, seems a more logical reason for their breakup. Replete with a very rich and encouraging lesbian wife, the acclaimed poet, ‘Brynher’ [nee Winifred Ellerman] Daniels was more fortunate in his choice of his next long-term lover, Kenneth Macpherson, the Scottish poet.\n\n“I’ve been happily married, to Carmen, for a thousand years. We have a son. What do you mean by asking me, if I, am gay?”, replied Geoffrey Lamont Holder the first time I asked him directly. Earlier queries had been more oblique, more circumspect: ‘There is a nude photograph of you in the James Weldon Johnson Collection at Yale, by Carl Van Vechten.’ “You must mean my brother, Bosco?”, he’d said. ‘No, it’s you…I’m amazed at how many people involved in Harlem’s artistic past were gay!’\n\n“What? How do you make the connection between a photograph, and being gay? …In earlier times, people did not have the hang-ups they do today. People were artists. One appreciated the beauty of bodies. It had nothing to do with who was gay. If you appreciated a fine body, you ask your friend to photograph, or to paint them. A man, or a woman, it was about beauty, it wasn’t necessarily about sex. Everything is not always about sex… “\n\nJust beginning research for a book entitled Homo Harlem: A Chronicle of Lesbian and Gay Life in the African American Cultural Capital, 1915–1995, either as a participant, or as a talisman-like role model, I felt confident that Geoffrey Holder had a place in my story. For, brandishing bravura and poise, the un-Cola Man of my youth appearing on TV to sell Seven-Up soda, had shown an entire generation of questioning boys another way to fabulously be a man.\n\nUntil. I was 24 and came out to myself, I felt sure I’d marry some beautiful girl. My furtive, fumbling, fugitive and few searches for sexual fulfillment were primarily with young women. Even latter, once I knew the score, friends advised, “why yes you’re gay, but you’d make such a wonderful father. You’re kind and have so much to offer a woman. There are many who would be understanding, you should get married. It will help to protect you”\n\nFor the longest time such advice was widely taken as gospel. The person with whom most gays and lesbians wished to establish a marital alliance in the past, invariably was someone of the opposite sex able to offer plausible deni-ability.\n\nFamed as a booster of Harlem and African Americans, Iowa native, critic and novelist Carl Van Vechten, was emphatically gay.\n\nYet, he married twice with deliberation. His marriage to his first wife, a long-time friend from home, lasted only a few years, while marriage to the petite actress Fania Marinoff endured for a lifetime, from 1914 until Van Vechten died in 1964.\n\nAffairs, fights, and copious drinking, like many involved in old-style ‘gay marriages’, the Van Vechtens were, in their way, a deeply dependent and devoted couple.\n\nAs they preferred cats to infants, the hook for them, seems never to have involved any hopes of offspring. Instead, it was how the ‘respectability’ of matrimony made inheriting a million-dollar-plus trust fund more secure. These riches seem to have helped sustain their attraction.\n\nNone of Holder’s depictions of abstracted naked, men that I’ve come across, are more than passively erotic\n\nMysterious and exotic naratives, none of Van Vechten’s nude and semi-nude portrayals of Holder were as revealing or as blatantly salacious as the images he made to titillate and trade with gay friends. Nor are any of Holder’s depictions of naked men that I’ve come across, more than passively erotic.\n\nAs much as Carl Van Vechten loved to make photographs of the famous and promising, Negros and nude portraits and figure studies were his speciality\n\nThere never was a more emphatic denial expressed to me as to his sexuality by Geoffrey Holder. Yet, what actually do artistic sensitivity or flamboyant dandism prove alone? Were it not for the casually tossed off comments of certain friends and acquaintances, people who were Holder’s contemporaries, other artistic types who knew him or people who did, I might have abandoned my quest. Alvin Ailey, Henry Van Dyke, Freddie Hamilton, Bobby Short, Walter Nicks, Grafton Trew, Marvin Smith; all had their tales to relate. It was important for me to learn at first, not to probe too much, attempting to discover history that validated gays. Lest my wary informants retreat, it was essential to learn restraint and discretion. For these were men who spent a lifetime strategically hiding, or at least compartmentalizing, their true identities behind a public persona. Resolute not to “hurt” anyone with outing, even when dead, finding my interest appealing and suspect at the same time, to “protect a friend’, they were easily liable to amend or even to retract a revelation in its entirety! If seeking out history, discovering those who have come before one, is generally daunting for African Americans, for gay people of color, the task is more perilously elusive still.\n\nAlthough their mother was from Martinique, a French colony, prodigious brothers Boscoe and Geoffrey Holder were born into a middle-class Trinidadian family. That ultimate emblem of Victorian respectability, a piano graced the Holder’s parlor. Both Boscoe and Geoffrey, younger than his brother by ten years, played piano and danced. Inasmuch as Boscoe taught himself to paint, as Geoffrey emulated everything Boscoe did, Geoffrey painted too.\n\nTo be gay is still taboo in Caribbean counties. Initially Boscoe’s inevitable marriage failed to separate the inseparable pair. Inspired by the western elegance espoused by movies, local folk lore, African rhythms, ritual and music also informed the Holder brother’s artistic pursuits. At the forefront of a movement that showcased Afrocentric artistic expression, Boscoe, with his wife Sheila and Geoffrey each left home. Going their separate ways they disseminated a sparkling outpouring of joie de vire and theatrical creativity into the warmly welcoming wider world.\n\nOne might say that Boscoe Holder’s profusion of gay friends from the theatrical sphere, such as Noël Coward and Oliver Messel, was telling. Geoffrey and Carmen, also darlings of the world of theatre and as prominent and stylish fixtures in fashionable society as Amanda and Carter or Wyatt and Gloria, surly had their quotient of gay friends too. Of Messel, the facile designer who created the fairytale-like stage setting for House of Flowers, also known for his fetishistic enthusiasm for Caribbean men, Holder was adamant: “He was a condescending bitch!” More mixed was his regard for fellow dancer Alvin Ailey.\n\nIn a way, one might say that Geoffry Holder could afford to be somewhat sanguine and magnanimous towards Ailey because despite his colleague’s early and longstanding friendship, since George Washington Carver Junior High School, with Carmen, she had chosen him to marry and make a home and family. Aware of Alvin Ailey’s troubled life as a black gay man, his driven pursuit of drugs and countless, endless and empty assignations with youth encountered in pinball arcades and “bookstores”, one might doubt that he’d ever wished he was in Geoffrey’s place, married to Carmen. While it’s uncertain that such an alliance would have brought him the calm of mutual reinforcement, the sustenance of shared admiration and love, it’s beyond doubt that Alvin too had wished to marry Carmen. Her rejection left him distraught, dejected and suicidal.\n\nDe Lavallade was born on March 6, 1931 in Los Angeles, California, to Creole parents from New Orleans, Louisiana. Her father, Leo de Lavallade, was a postman and bricklayer. Before her early death Carmen’s mother, Grace Grenot de Lavallade, was in ill health. Born between sisters Yvonne and Elaine, it was Carmen’s father, and his sister Adele de Lavallade Young, owner of the Hugh Gordon Book Shop, one of the first African American bookstores in LA, who reared her. If Geoffrey had had Boscoe as a model to emulate, immense inspiration was derived by Carmen from her cousin, Janet Collins, who became the first full-time African American prima ballerina at the Metropolitan Opera Ballet! Just 14 de Lavallade began ballet training with Melissa Blake, and two years later she won a scholarship to study modern dance with Lester Horton. Joining the Lester Horton Dance Theater de Lavallade became its lead dancer . Besides taking private ballet lessons with Carmelita Maracci, she also studied a variety of dance styles, and took acting lessons with Stella Adler who once lived in the same building where Leo Holder lives today on Riverside Drive. Carmen won dancing parts in several minor Hollywood movies early in her career. In 1954, Carmen Jones gave her the chance to dance with Alvin on screen and led to their being invited to dance in the Broadway musical House of Flowers by the same choreographer, Herbert Ross. This was how Carmen and Alvin first met fellow cast member Geoffrey Holder.\n\nDetermined, tall, talented, persisting, after a four-month courtship Geoffrey Holder wed Carmen de Lavallade, in 1955.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nA good deal more happened after Geoffrey and Carmen married. It’s delightfully related in their compelling documentary from 2004, Carmen and Geoffrey. Their’s is also a saga interwoven with the life of Alvin Ailey as depicted in Jamila Wignot’s well revived documentary film Ailey.\n\nTheir accomplishments have also filled numerous appreciations which quickly followed Geoffrey’s passing. Utterly unrelated, it was a piece by a young journalist, Alvin McEwen, called The Erasure of ‘Gay’ From Black History & the Black Community Must Stop that mostly prompted this blog post. Hidden in the past, gays are also deliberately erased in the present. As most black people know, and all African American gays learn, the most vexing and prevalent form of bigotry at play today, is the passive-aggressive oppression of being dismissed to the point of being ignored completely, as if one did not exist. It’s not just the history books, but in the Times Home Section or Style Magazine that this occurs for blacks. Similarly for African Americans who are LGBT, our disappearance is in plain sight. We are everywhere, from church on Sunday, to the football arena on Monday, but officially, we are nowhere. As Mr. McEwen puts it:\n\n“As a gay African-American, I’ve heard the argument about how “you can’t compare the gay civil rights movement to the African-American civil rights movement” more times than I care to count. in the black community where LGBT people of color run up against a massive brick wall. There is a pattern of erasure which strips our presence from the majority of black history…”\n\nWhen African-American civic organizations talk about “the state of Black America,” we are omitted. We are talked about as examples of how tolerant the black community is becoming…\n\nTo some African-American heterosexuals, we are mere sidebars or addenda. We are objects they hurl Biblical scripture at to cover up their own religious shortcomings or soulless reservoirs of salacious gossip holding court in places like beauty parlors…\n\nNo matter what, no one ever, nor ever will, ignore a true original, Geoffrey Holder or Alvin Ailey. And seeing and appreciating their gifts and humanity, the brilliance of the celebrated, that’s the beginning of learning about the value of ordinary LGBTQ+ folks too.\n\nMontero Lamar Hill, aka, Lil Nas X"
