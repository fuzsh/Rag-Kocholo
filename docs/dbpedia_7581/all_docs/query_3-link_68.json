        "text": "Zagreb used the political momentum in Brussels to push for the interests of Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) at EU summit on Thursday (25 March).\n\nWhile Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and skyrocketing energy prices dominate the agenda of the European leaders’ meetings on Thursday and Friday, Croatia is using the political momentum to put the protracted political crisis in BiH back on the agenda of the EU.\n\n“For years, there has been no such formal discussion on the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina“, Croatia’s Prime Minister Andrej Plenković told EU leaders as he arrived at the Council on Thursday (25 March).\n\nThe loose central institutions of BiH hold Serb-Dominated Republika Srpska in an uneasy state alliance with the other entity, the Bosniak-Croat federation.\n\nThe HDZ, the biggest Bosnian Croat party, and its leader, Dragan Čović, who despite claiming support of the majority of Croats is not a current member of the country’s tripartite presidency representing the Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs, has been pushing for electoral reform in the country.\n\nThe HDZ refuses to acknowledge the current Croat representative in the presidency, Željko Komšić, saying he was elected thanks to Bosniak votes.\n\nWith general elections scheduled for October 2022, the Croats are worried that they could lose precious seats in state and Federation-level parliaments.\n\nČović and the HDZ have demanded an overhaul of the electoral law to bolster Croats’ position in elections in the Federation, where Bosniaks represent a sizeable majority.\n\nEURACTIV understands that the latest round of negotiations in Sarajevo ended with little progress on the issue, with electoral reform likely on ice until after the elections, angering the Croats.\n\nIn a letter addressed to Croatian and EU institution leaders, Čović said attempts to reduce Croats to “status of a national minority” could lead to the ethnicity calling for “territorial reorganisation of the country”.\n\nCroatia wants a “united message from the Council to all BiH politicians about the need to quickly finalise electoral reform, while eliminating all forms of inequality or discrimination of the three constituent peoples and other citizens”, one EU diplomat familiar with Zagreb’s aims told EURACTIV in the run-up to the summit.\n\nPlenković, hailing from the Croatian HDZ, has also found allies in Brussels to put Bosnia on the agenda, particularly among his Christian conservative political family of the European People’s Party (EPP).\n\n“Russia’s recent threats against Bosnia and Herzegovina leave no doubt that Putin is ready to continue his destructive campaign also in the Western Balkans,” European Parliament President Roberta Metsola from EPP said during her brief appearance in the room with EU leaders.\n\nHowever, boosting the ethnicity-based logic in Bosnia’s legislative institutions has met opposition in certain ranges of the European political spectrum, particularly the Greens.\n\n“We see a push from Croatian Prime Minister Plenkovic to question the legitimacy of the elections, but I sincerely hope that this will be strongly rejected by the other member states,” Green MEP Tineke Strik told EURACTIV.\n\nAccording to the Dutch politician, the electoral reform deal the EU was pushing “was problematic, and would cement an undemocratic voting system and power for the Croat HDZ party for the coming years.”\n\n“So I’m glad that these talks failed, and hope that the EU will now fully focus its engagement on enabling democratic elections to take place in October”, she added.\n\nHowever, for both Brussels and Washington, the rules set by the Dayton agreement continue to set the scene for diplomatic engagement with the country.\n\n“Anything that happens in Bosnia Herzegovina now has to be voted on. In other words, it has to be acceptable to the ruling coalitions,” a senior US Government official told EURACTIV.\n\n“We have to be realistic about what we want to achieve. That is why we say that the answer is limited constitutional reform and limited electoral reform to get a least in compliance with the European Commission”, they said.\n\nThe compass points to Dayton\n\nCroatia’s move to put Bosnia on Brussels’ agenda in the second half of the week was accompanied by a last-minute demand to mention the country in the EU’s new military strategy, the Strategic Compass, at the meeting of EU ambassadors on Monday.\n\nThe document’s final text now includes an explicit mention of the “three constituent peoples”, reflecting the wording used by the Dayton agreement to refer to the country’s three main ethnic groups, entrenching the Croats’ equal status within the country.\n\n[Edited by Alice Taylor]\n\nRead more with Euractiv"
