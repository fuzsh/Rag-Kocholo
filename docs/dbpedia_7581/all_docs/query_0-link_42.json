        "text": "The consociational model in Bosnia-Herzegovina (BiH) has not produced liberal democracy in the country despite significant involvement by the international community. The rule of three autarchic, ethnonationalist leaders has led to a communitarian model of democracy through populist mobilization. These processes have effectively established three parallel, ethnic societies in one state. Overall, a process of autocratization by mismanagement at the subnational level has continued to take place in BiH.\n\nYet the country’s consociation prevents full autocracy at the state level. This informal mode of rule is prevalent in the three parallel societies. Institutions are weak, while theocratic influences are strong. Democratic features are nonetheless present, and the hybridity of the model was reflected in the general elections in October 2022. These were conducted under theoretically democratic conditions although with deep-rooted informal ruling party networks and influence, if not full control over local electoral boards.\n\nThe European Council granted candidate status to BiH in December despite its failure to implement most of the 14 key priorities set out in the European Commission’s opinion. The boycott of state institutions by political parties from the Republika Srpska (RS) had continued until the spring of 2022, and the policy dialogue with the European Union (EU) was unblocked only in June, while the state budget was adopted in July after an 18-month delay. A caretaker government found itself serving another four years in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) since the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) blocked the new government’s formation. These divisions in the country were also reflected in the stalled process of joining NATO, which is opposed by the RS.\n\nAttempts by EU and US envoys to bring the parties to an agreement on required constitutional and election law changes failed during the year. Thus, the state constitution and other legislation, especially the election law, remained in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and unaligned with rulings from the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) since December 2009. High Representative Christian Schmidt—chosen by the international community and given powers to impose decisions in the name of protecting the 1995 Dayton Accords—enacted controversial amendments to the FBiH constitution and election law in the evening after polls were closed but before votes had been counted in the October 2022 general elections.\n\nThe political parties accepted the changes but with different reactions. Party of Democratic Action (SDA) leader Bakir Izetbegović claimed the changes “strengthened the position of HDZ.” The Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) spokesperson repeated the party’s position that “Schmidt is not High Representative and has no rights to impose any decision.” Croatian EU parliamentarian and former Bosnian diplomat Željana Zovko supported the decision, which she saw as “an introduction into the real work that should begin now.” A more cautious reaction came from EU representatives, who stressed that “it was exclusively the High Representative’s decision.” The US and UK administrations expressed strong support.\n\nThe electoral decision certainly showed flaws within Bosnian democracy. Political parties are unwilling to compromise, and seize on solutions that suit only their own leadership. The presence of the High Representative in BiH, and his power to impose decisions on his own, reflects a potentially unchecked and unbalanced dynamic with no place in a democratic country. It does, however, theoretically speed up governance processes and prevents future blockades from the leading nationalist parties. The entire situation reflects the duality of Bosnian governance: full external sovereignty in foreign affairs, but domestic sovereignty is restricted by the powers of the international community (expressed through the High Representative) and the leading powers’ ambassadors to the BiH.\n\nPolitical figures show little sign of accountability to citizens. Following the elections on October 2, several elected leaders switched parties in a matter of days, effectively betraying their voters. This is a long-standing practice in Bosnian politics, usually for politicians’ personal gain.\n\nThe independence and impartiality of the judiciary remained problematic in 2022. The chief prosecutor of the RS was demoted for disciplinary offenses. The state Parliamentary Assembly rejected amendments to the law on the High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council (HJPC) that would have created a rigorous and credible system for verifying financial statements of judicial officeholders. The newly elected state prosecutor was named from only a single candidate after others were disqualified or gave up seeking the position.\n\nPoor functioning of the judiciary, and no political commitment to reform the justice system, undermine the fight against corruption and organized crime in BiH. The state parliament rejected a law on conflict of interest. The state Minister for Human Rights and Refugees was arrested in December as part of an investigation into organized crime and corruption. Despite this and similar cases, the country’s overall record of preventing and fighting corruption remains insignificant. In Europe, only Russia and Ukraine have worse corruption perception indexes.\n\nLegislation securing and protecting fundamental rights is generally provided, but practices differ from entity to entity. In 2022, an action plan for the social inclusion of the Roma was adopted in April, and for LGBT+ people in July. National minority rights for 17 recognized groups are legally provided, although discrimination often continues, especially towards Roma people and migrants. The main issue domestically is the equality and rights of “constituent peoples” when they are in the minority in a local community.\n\nFor several years now, BiH has been the only country not to nominate candidates to the Council of Europe (CoE) expert agencies monitoring minority rights, democracy, rule of law, and human rights. The mandate of a BiH judge at the ECtHR expired in 2021, and replacement candidates have not been nominated for two years, although the related election commission submitted its report to the state presidency.\n\nSeveral cases of femicide brought women and activists out into Bosnian streets, although the turnout for these demonstrations was small, reflecting a general inertia in the society despite reported levels of domestic violence. The protesters asked for femicide to be defined as a criminal offense and to harmonize criminal laws with the CoE’s Istanbul Convention on combatting violence against women.\n\nThe civic sector and independent media are present in society, but governing bodies and the international community have learned the tactics of ignoring civil society actors and media or restricting resources. Independent media is saturated with administrative controls and pressures, and the advertising policies of major public companies avoid campaigns in independent media, thus increasing their financial pressures. Questionable practices and editorial decisions plague public service broadcasters, while a former director of BH Radio accused the whole of BHRT of acting against Serb journalists.\n\nDespite support from the West to “counter Russian malign influence” and disinformation, BiH has not developed a countrywide strategy to tackle these issues, nor has it aligned its foreign policy with the EU position on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) estimated BiH’s population losses at 1.5 percent annually, making it the highest depopulating country in the world. There are estimates that some 500 villages have zero inhabitants, while less than 10 people live in 1,500 villages. Emigration figures over the past decade show that 485,000 Bosnians left the country between the last census in 2013 and 2021. The state and entity governments have taken no action to reverse this trend, which actually suits the ruling parties, whose voters are rewarded with positions, jobs, and contracts and remain in the country—thus further strengthening the electoral basis of the ruling nationalist parties."
