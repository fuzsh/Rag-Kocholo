        "text": "Short description of the task of EUDEL and projects in BiH\n\nMission Statement\n\nThe 27 Member States of the European Union fully and firmly support Bosnia and Herzegovina’s EU perspective as a future member state of the European Union, consistent with the Thessaloniki Declaration of 2003. Along with international partners, it is the EU’s aim to support and embed a stable and viable Bosnia and Herzegovina co-operating peacefully with its neighbours and irreversibly on track towards EU membership. EU membership for Bosnia and Herzegovina is firmly tied to the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of the country.\n\nPartners on behalf of BiH are threefold. Firstly, the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, who are the main motivation for and beneficiaries of the country’s EU integration. Secondly, the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina at all levels. Thirdly, the civil society of the country including NGOs, the academic community, the business community, political parties and associations dealing specific interests.\n\nThe Delegation of the European Union to Bosnia and Herzegovina is one of more than 130 Delegations that exist worldwide. Its role in Bosnia and Herzegovina is primarily aimed at:\n\n• presenting, explaining and implementing EU policy;\n\n• analysing and reporting on the policies and developments in the country; and\n\n• conducting negotiations in line with its mandate.\n\nIt operates under the overall leadership of the High Representative of the Union for the Common Foreign and Security Policy/Vice-President of the Commission. It promotes the EU’s interests that are embodied in common policies relating to, among others, foreign and security issues, commerce, agriculture, fisheries, environment, transport, health and safety. It plays a key role in the implementation of the EU’s external financial assistance. This primarily relates to the funds allocated under the Instrument for Pre-Accession (IPA).\n\nOffice of the European Union Special Representative\n\nThe European Union Special Representative (EUSR) is mandated by the Council of the European Union to reinforce the EU’s political support for its policy objectives in BiH: ‘BIH’s progress in the Stabilisation and Association Process, with the aim of seeing a stable, viable, peaceful, multi-ethnic BiH, co-operating fully and peacefully with its neighbours in the region’.\n\nThe EUSR offers advice and facilitation support in the political process to institutions at all levels, aimed at ensuring greater consistency and coherence of all political, economic and European priorities – particularly in the areas of the rule of law and security sector reform.\n\nThe Delegation of the European Union and EUSR in Bosnia and Herzegovina also have regional offices in Banja Luka, BrÄko and Mostar.\n\nEU projects in BiH\n\nThe EU in BiH - FACTOGRAPH"
