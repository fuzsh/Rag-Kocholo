The agreement paved the way for the\n\ndeployment of a 55,000-strong NATO Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia for\n\none year. While IFORâs military tasks focused on keeping the peace and providing\n\nfor a secure environment, the implementation of many other civil tasks, coupled with\n\nan inflow of humanitarian and reconstruction aid, was seen as essential to building\n\na lasting peace in Bosnia. NATO deployed a smaller Stabilization Force (SFOR) in\n\nDecember 1996 in order to continue to provide a stable and secure environment for\n\nongoing civil peace efforts. SFORâs mandate will expire in June 1998. NATO is\n\nexpected to approve a successor force to SFOR by March 1998, following President\n\nClintonâs announcement in December 1997 that U.S. will participate in a post-SFOR\n\nmilitary presence in Bosnia. President Clinton stated that the mission of the new\n\nforce should be tied to specific benchmarks in the peace implementation process.\n\nSince Dayton, the civilian side of peace implementation has been challenged by\n\nthe scope of the tasks, and by the lack of commitment demonstrated by the Bosnian\n\nparties to various aspects of the peace agreement. IFOR and SFOR have focused\n\nprimarily on the military tasks of the peace agreements, but have also lent selected\n\nassistance to civilian agencies. Many international organizations have been involved\n\nwith assisting with other aspects of the peace agreement. Many countries and\n\nfinancial and development institutions have provided reconstruction assistance.\n\nTwo years of peace implementation have produced many positive results. IFOR\n\nand SFOR have successfully carried out their missions. Agreements on confidence-\n\nbuilding measures and arms control were concluded and implemented. National and\n\nlocal elections were conducted peacefully and joint political institutions were created.\n\nEconomic indicators have improved, especially in the Federation. On the negative\n\nside, ethnic divisions between the three Bosnian communities have not been\n\novercome. All parties have resisted the resettlement of displaced persons and\n\nrefugees and freedom of movement across entity lines. Numerous human rights\n\nviolations persist. Nationalist parties won dominant shares in the elections and some\n\npoliticians have continued to advocate ethnic separation. Over fifty indicted war\n\ncriminals have remained at large, most notably the former Bosnian Serb leaders\n\nRadovan Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic.\n\nThe international community and the Bosnian authorities have identified\n\nnumerous priority areas, such as: building functioning governmental structures,\n\nfurthering democratization and the protection of human rights, reforming the police,\n\nencouraging economic growth, and fostering the return of refugees. The obligation\n\nto turn over indicted war criminals remains a key priority. Overall, many\n\ninternational policymakers have determined that the progress made in Bosnia after\n\ntwo years is still not irreversible, and not at a point where peace in Bosnia is self-\n\nsustaining. This premise forms the basic justification for some form of continued\n\ninternational military force to remain in Bosnia in order to provide a secure\n\nenvironment for continued peace consolidation efforts.\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1\n\nInternational Framework . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3\n\nLondon Peace Implementation Conference, December 1995\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4\n\nFlorence Mid-term Review Conference, June 1996\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5\n\nCivilian Consolidation Plan And Second London Peace Implementation\n\nConference, November-December 1996 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5\n\nSintra Review Conference, May 1997 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6\n\nBonn Peace Implementation Conference, December 1997 . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7\n\nStatus of Selected Implementation Provisions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8\n\nFormation of Governmental Institutions\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8\n\nThe Federation and Croat-Bosniak Relations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9\n\nMostar and Sarajevo . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10\n\nForming a Unified Federation Army and Police Force . . . . . . . . . . . . 11\n\nThe Republika Srpska . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11\n\nStatus of Implementation and Future Milestones . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12\n\nStatus of the Brcko Region . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12\n\nArms Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13\n\nOSCE Role . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16\n\nStatus of Implementation and Future Milestones . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16\n\nConfidence-building Measures . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17\n\nOSCE and ICRC Roles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18\n\nStatus of Implementation and Future Milestones . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19\n\nElections . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19\n\nNational and Entity Elections, September 1996 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 21\n\nMunicipal Elections, September 1997 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24\n\nRS Special Elections, November 1997 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25\n\nStatus of Implementation and Future Milestones . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 27\n\nCivil Police Task Force . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 28\n\nU.N.

The agreement paved the way for the deployment of a\n\nNATO Implementation Force (IFOR) of about 55,000 multinational troops in Bosnia\n\nunder a one-year mandate. IFORâs mission was limited to military tasks, such as\n\nenforcing the cease-fire and a zone of separation between forces, outlined in Annex\n\n1A of the peace agreement. IFOR was to provide a secure environment to allow\n\npeace to take hold in Bosnia, but its deployment was not intended to serve as an end\n\nin itself. Rather, implementation of the vast array of civil tasks outlined in the peace\n\nagreement, coupled with an inflow of reconstruction aid to redress the physical\n\nconsequences of four years of war, were regarded as essential to securing long-term\n\npeace in the Balkans. Less than satisfactory progress in civil implementation by the\n\nend of 1996 provided the justification for a follow-on NATO Stabilization Force\n\n(SFOR), smaller in size than IFOR and under an eighteen-month mandate, to\n\ncontinue to provide a secure environment in Bosnia.3 A similar justification is\n\nexpected to be invoked for a successor force for SFOR after June 1998. NATO will\n\nbe deciding among various options for a successor force in early 1998.4\n\nSince Dayton, implementation of the civilian aspects of the peace agreement has\n\nbeen challenging for several reasons. First, the sheer size and scope of the many\n\nimportant tasks to be implemented was daunting. The tasks included negotiating\n\narms stabilization and confidence-building measures, managing the return of\n\ndisplaced persons and refugees, holding free elections, establishing new\n\ngovernmental institutions, and securing observance of human rights, among others.\n\nMeanwhile, NATO troops have contributed to a secure environment for these tasks\n\nto progress, but have not been directly responsible for their implementation.\n\nAlthough NATO has been adverse to any broadening of its mission, it has\n\n1Prepared by Julie Kim, Specialist in International Relations.\n\n2The state is referred to as âBosnia and Herzegovinaâ in the peace agreement.\n\n3 For further information on SFOR, see U.S. Library of Congress.

December 23,\n\n1997.\n\nCRS-2\n\nacknowledged that military and civilian implementation plans must complement each\n\nother. Both IFOR and SFOR have lent selective support to civilian agencies.\n\nSecond, full implementation of the civilian tasks was always expected to take\n\nlonger than any particular deadline set for both IFOR and SFOR. While the peace\n\nagreement set some ambitious deadlines on certain civilian tasks, a complete\n\nrestoration of civil conditions and the construction of durable governing structures\n\ncould only begin during the first two years after Dayton. In November and December\n\n1996, the international community endorsed a civilian consolidation program in\n\nBosnia for the next two year period. U.S. policymakers have emphasized that the\n\nmandate for any military force that succeeds SFOR after June 1998 will not be tied\n\nto a set deadline, as IFOR and SFOR were. Rather, it is to be linked with established\n\nbenchmarks that would measure progress in establishing a self-sustaining peace. The\n\nexact date by which the entire peace process can be declared complete cannot be\n\ndetermined.\n\nThe international apparatus that was constructed to oversee civil implementation\n\npresented another challenge. Unlike IFOR and SFOR, the civilian side of\n\nimplementation enjoys no unified âcommand and controlâ apparatus. Dozens of\n\ncountries and numerous international organizations and agencies are involved with\n\ncivil implementation. Their efforts are linked by an ad hoc coordinating structure,\n\nthe Peace Implementation Council, and its steering group, which provide political\n\nguidance for continued progress in the peace process. The High Representative\n\n(formerly Carl Bildt and now Carlos Westendorp) coordinates the activities of the\n\ninternational organizations and agencies.\n\nMoreover, while international organizations have consistently assisted with\n\nmany civil tasks, primary responsibility for implementation and compliance has\n\nrested with the Balkan parties. This fact has been repeatedly invoked by international\n\nofficials. Top U.S. and other officials have led numerous missions to the region to\n\nrepeat their insistence to the Bosnian parties on full compliance with various terms\n\nof the peace agreement. Numerous implementation conferences have produced\n\nstatements recommitting the Balkan parties to implementation of the peace\n\nagreement. In general, however, constructive and consistent political will on the part\n\nof the Bosnian parties to implement all aspects of the peace agreement has been\n\nlacking, reflecting the staying power of the partiesâ different strategic objectives. The\n\nBosnian Serbs in particular have blocked most minority refugee returns to the\n\nRepublika Srpska, and have refused to turn in indicted war criminals to the war\n\ncrimes tribunal. Most observers believe that the continued presence and influence\n\nof war criminals severely undermines peace consolidation and reconciliation\n\nprospects.\n\n5\n\nThe international community has very few âenforcementâ mechanisms at its\n\ndisposal to encourage or compel compliance with the peace agreement outside of\n\n5 For detailed information on the war crimes tribunal and status of war criminals, see U.S.\n\nLibrary of Congress.

The lifting of economic sanctions in October\n\n1996 removed a major lever of influence on the Bosnian Serbs and Serbia-\n\nMontenegro. At the December 1996 London conference, the international\n\ncommunity, in an attempt to wield greater influence on the Balkan parties,\n\nconditioned international reconstruction assistance on demonstrations by the Bosnian\n\nauthorities of compliance with and commitments to the peace agreement. Economic\n\nconditionality was further emphasized at the May 1997 meeting in Sintra, Portugal.\n\nAt the December 1997 Bonn conference, the powers of the High Representative were\n\nenhanced to enable him to impose binding solutions on the Bosnian parties in order\n\nto break through ongoing stalemates.\n\nAlongside the implementation of civilian tasks, economic recovery and\n\ndevelopment are viewed as essential to chances for lasting peace in Bosnia and\n\nHerzegovina. Reconstruction aid provided by the international community plays a\n\ncritical role in securing and implementing the overall peace. Pledging and disbursing\n\nreconstruction funds has been slow, however. A major donorsâ conference was held\n\non April 12-13, 1996, in Brussels. The conference met 1996 goals for the Priority\n\nReconstruction Program that outlined over $5 billion in emergency reconstruction\n\nneeds over the next three-four years. A pledging conference for 1997 was repeatedly\n\npostponed because of delays in getting essential economic legislation passed by the\n\nBosnian government. The donorsâ conference was finally held on July 23-24, 1997.\n\n$1.24 billion was raised in pledges, of which $1.1 billion was committed to the\n\nPriority Reconstruction Program. The conference emphasized political conditionality\n\nto the disbursement of reconstruction aid.\n\nThis report provides a status report on the international framework for peace\n\nimplementation and on selected civil aspects of the peace agreement: the formation\n\nof governmental institutions, arms control and confidence-building measures,\n\nelections and election results, civil police, refugees and displaced persons, and human\n\nrights.\n\n6\n\nInternational Framework7\n\nIn contrast to the NATO peace forces in Bosnia, the international effort to assist\n\nwith civilian tasks had no prior preparation or organizational resources. Rather, it\n\nhas been managed by an ad hoc institutional structure spanning dozens of countries\n\nand international organizations. International leaders have repeatedly emphasized\n\nthat progress in implementation largely rests with the Bosnian parties themselves, but\n\nwith the assistance of the international community.\n\nThe peace agreement established the post of High Representative (Annex 10)\n\nto facilitate the efforts of the parties and to mobilize and coordinate activities of\n\ninternational organizations involved in implementing civilian aspects of the peace\n\nagreement. The High Representative is considered to be the final authority regarding\n\n6 See relevant cited CRS Reports for more detailed information on the subjects of war\n\ncrimes, SFOR, and reconstruction assistance.\n\n7Prepared by Julie Kim.\n\nCRS-4\n\ninterpretation of the agreement on civilian implementation. He has no command\n\nauthority over NATO forces. Appointed in December 1995, Carl Bildt of Sweden\n\nserved as High Representative until June 1997. As the Bosnia peace process slowly\n\nprogressed, Bildt acknowledged that the trend toward ethnic separation persisted, but\n\nurged that international attention and commitment to the Dayton goals continue\n\nbeyond arbitrarily-set deadlines. He predicted that the overall peace process may\n\ntake âyears, if not decades or generations,â and called for a strategic concept to\n\nremove both the military option and the secession option from the still-distrustful\n\nBosnian parties. Bildt was replaced as High Representative by Carlos Westendorp,\n\n8\n\nof Spain, on June 20, 1997. Jacques Klein of the United States, formerly U.N.\n\nAdministrator in Eastern Slavonia, and Gerd Wagner of Germany were later\n\nappointed co-deputies to the High Representative. Hanns Schumacher of Germany\n\nreplaced Wagner after his untimely death, with eleven other passengers, in a\n\nhelicopter crash on September 17, 1997.\n\nAt regular intervals, the international community has convened ministerial\n\nmeetings and summits to review and guide the Bosnia peace process. In addition to\n\nsuch large-scale conferences, the United States and other countries have held\n\nimpromptu summit meetings with the Balkan presidents to press for progress in\n\npeace implementation and compliance with various commitments. These\n\nâimplementation summitsâ have intended to focus attention on particular current\n\nproblems relating to the peace process. Some of the conferences and meetings have\n\nestablished various deadlines for compliance in specific areas of civil\n\nimplementation. Beginning in December 1997, the High Representative can impose\n\nbinding arbitration on the parties when they fail to meet deadlines established by the\n\ninternational community or the Office of the High Representative.\n\nLondon Peace Implementation Conference, December 1995\n\nFollowing conclusion of the peace agreement at Dayton, on November 21, 1995,\n\nrepresentatives of over fifty countries and international organizations met at a Peace\n\nImplementation Conference in London, on December 8-9, 1995. The conference was\n\nmeant to mobilize the international community behind the goal of a durable peace in\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina and in support of the peace agreement. Conference\n\nparticipants reached agreement on a number of conclusions. The London conference\n\napproved the appointment of Carl Bildt, the European Union mediator for the former\n\nYugoslavia, as High Representative.\n\nThe London conference set forth new structures to manage civil peace\n\nimplementation. A Peace Implementation Council (PIC) composed of all of the\n\nstates and organizations represented at the London conference was established, taking\n\nthe place of the International Conference on the former Yugoslavia, which had been\n\njointly sponsored by the United Nations and the European Union. A Steering Board\n\nof the PIC was established. The boardâs members â representatives from Canada,\n\nFrance, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, the\n\nUnited States, the European Union, the European Commission, and the Organization\n\nof the Islamic Conference â have provided political guidance to the High\n\n8Remarks to the National Press Club, Washington, D.C., May 1, 1997.\n\nCRS-5\n\nRepresentative on peace implementation, convening about once a month. The\n\ninternational âcontact groupâ (France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and\n\nthe United States) on the former Yugoslavia, which led international diplomatic\n\nefforts on Bosnia in 1994-1995, also continues to meet on Bosnia peace\n\nimplementation.\n\nOther major international conferences launched in December 1995 were the\n\nBrussels conference on short-term financial assistance (December 20-21) and the\n\nBudapest ministerial meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\n\nEurope (OSCE, December 7-8). In Brussels, donor countries pledged over $600\n\nmillion for immediate humanitarian and refugee assistance needs; this meeting was\n\nfollowed up in April 1996 by a major pledging conference among donor countries\n\nthat raised $1.2 billion for the rest of 1996. At the Budapest OSCE meeting, OSCE\n\nmembers accepted the various mandates requested of the organization in the peace\n\nagreement. They established an OSCE mission to Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nresponsible for implementing OSCE tasks such as arms control and confidence-\n\nbuilding negotiations, elections, and human rights. Robert Frowick of the United\n\nStates was named head of the OSCE mission. In December 1996, OSCE extended\n\nits mandate in Bosnia for a second year. Frowick to be replaced in January 1998 as\n\nhead of the OSCE mission in Bosnia.\n\nFlorence Mid-term Review Conference, June 1996\n\nForeign ministers from over 40 countries comprising the Peace Implementation\n\nCouncil (PIC) met in Florence on June 13-14, 1996. The meeting was intended to\n\nreview progress after six months in meeting the terms of the Bosnia peace agreement.\n\nMuch of the focus of the conference was on prospects for holding elections on\n\nschedule and on the problem posed by the continued leadership of indicted war\n\ncriminal Radovan Karadzic. Antonio Cassese, president of the war crimes tribunal\n\nat the Hague, called for the arrest and extradition of indicted war criminals as a\n\nprecondition for elections. Cassese repeated his recommendation that economic\n\nsanctions be applied to enforce compliance with the tribunal.\n\nThe Florence conference concluded that cooperation with the war crimes\n\ntribunal, a requirement under the peace agreement, remained substantially unfulfilled.\n\nIt specified that Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic should no longer hold a\n\nposition of leadership in the Republika Srpska. Conference participants, however,\n\ndid not agree to call for a re-imposition of sanctions against violators, but rather\n\nreferred to sanctions as a measure of last resort. Finally, the Florence conference\n\nrecommended to the OSCE that elections in Bosnia should take place on schedule on\n\nSeptember 14.\n\nCivilian Consolidation Plan And Second London Peace\n\nImplementation Conference, November-December 1996\n\nPrior to the second full meeting of the PIC in December 1996, the PIC Steering\n\nBoard convened a meeting with the newly-elected Bosnian presidency and other\n\nBalkan ministers on November 14, 1996, in Paris. The meeting produced a set of\n\nCRS-6\n\nguiding principles for civilian consolidation of the peace process over the next two\n\nyears.\n\nThe civilian consolidation plan identified thirteen priorities for the two year\n\nperiod: implementing regional stabilization agreements; creating a secure\n\nenvironment and re-establishing law and order; ensuring respect of human rights;\n\nbuilding and promoting democracy, including an independent media; conducting\n\nmunicipal elections in 1997 and general elections in 1998; increasing freedom of\n\nmovement; facilitating the return or resettlement of refugees and displaced persons;\n\nfully cooperating with the International Criminal Tribunal; facilitating reconstruction\n\nand other economic assistance; creating conditions for a market economy; promoting\n\nlong-term reconciliation; re-establishing educational systems; and making further\n\nprogress in removing mines in Bosnia. The two-year period was divided into two\n\nâaction plansâ of twelve months each, with mid-term reviews.\n\nThe PIC meeting in London on December 4-5, 1996, lauded the progress made\n\nduring the first year, especially the ongoing cessation of hostilities, the holding of\n\nelections, the establishment of common institutions, and the start of reconstruction.\n\nIt noted, however, still little progress in refugee returns, observance of human rights,\n\nand freedom of movement, among other areas. The PIC endorsed the two-year\n\ncivilian consolidation plan and outlined a specific action plan for 1997.\n\nThe PIC noted again that the task of consolidating peace was primarily the\n\nresponsibility of the Bosnian authorities. The conference stated that the international\n\ncommunityâs willingness to expend human and financial resources would be\n\nconditional on the commitment of the Bosnian parties to implementation of the peace\n\nagreement.\n\nSintra Review Conference, May 1997\n\nForeign Ministers representing the Steering Board of the PIC met in Sintra,\n\nPortugal, on May 30, 1997, to review peace implementation in Bosnia. The ministers\n\nconcluded that all of the authorities in Bosnia were failing to live up fully to their\n\nobligations under the peace agreement, and that this was âunacceptable.â They\n\ndemanded a âsignificant accelerationâ in implementation in numerous specific areas,\n\nsuch as the development of governmental institutions and the ability of refugees to\n\nreturn to their homes. For the former, numerous deadlines were established fo\n\n9\n\nr\n\npolicy decisions to be made by the common Bosnian governmental institutions. The\n\nHigh Representative was charged with establishing further deadlines for decisions\n\nthat remained outstanding.\n\nAt Sintra, the ministers re-emphasized the conditionality of international\n\nassistance on the partiesâ compliance with and implementation of the peace\n\nagreement. In particular, assistance for housing and infrastructure was to be\n\ndependent on the acceptance of return. Moreover, aid priority was to be given to\n\n9 Communique, Declaration from the Ministerial Meeting of the Steering Board of the PIC,\n\nSintra, May 30, 1997.\n\nCRS-7\n\nmunicipalities receptive to the return of ethnic minorities. The Sintra meeting also\n\n10\n\nappointed Carlos Westendorp to replace Carl Bildt as High Representative.\n\nPrior to the Sintra meeting, the U.S. Administration announced a renewed effort\n\nto accelerate progress in peace implementation in Bosnia. The top priorities for this\n\nnew push included bringing war criminals to justice, developing self-sustaining\n\ndemocratic institutions, promoting the safe return of refugees, enhancing public\n\nsecurity, and establishing a military balance.11 The U.S. initiative did not address\n\nplans for possibly maintaining an international security presence in Bosnia after\n\nSFOR. In early April 1997, the State Department appointed Ambassador Robert\n\nGelbard to be Special Representative of the President and Secretary of State for the\n\nDayton Accords.\n\nBonn Peace Implementation Conference, December 1997\n\nThe Peace Implementation Council met in Bonn on December 9-10, 1997, to\n\nreview progress in implementing the peace agreement. At Bonn, the Council noted\n\nprogress in the following areas: municipal elections in September and early elections\n\nin the RS in November; arms control measures, police reform and restructuring;\n\nsome progress in minority returns; economic revival in the Federation; the\n\ndevelopment of independent media; and the rise in the number of indicted war\n\ncriminals in custody at the Hague. The Bonn meeting also specified areas where\n\nmore progress was needed, especially in governmental structures, the protection of\n\nhuman rights, and refugee returns.\n\nThe Bonn conference enhanced the existing authority of the High\n\nRepresentative. It welcomed the High Representativeâs intention to make binding\n\ndecisions, when necessary on certain issues. In a speech before the PIC, High\n\nRepresentative Carlos Westendorp stated that his ability to execute decisions would\n\nâbreak the log-jamâ in areas where other approaches have failed. The initiative to\n\nstrengthen the Office of the High Representative received strong backing from the\n\nUnited States, among others. The High Representative is now able to adopt interim\n\nmeasures to take effect when the Bosnian parties are unable to reach agreement. He\n\nis also able to make binding decisions on âother measures to ensure implementation\n\nof the peace agreement...as well as the smooth running of the common institutions.â\n\nSuch measures may include actions, including the dismissal from office, against\n\npersons in violation of their commitments under the peace agreement.\n\nThe Bonn conference established numerous additional deadlines for specified\n\nimplementation measures. It invited the High Representative to take appropriate\n\nmeasures in case of non-compliance. In December, High Representative Westendorp\n\nutilized his enhanced authority by imposing interim laws on citizenship, customs\n\ntariffs, and landmines. These laws are to remain valid until the central Bosnian\n\npolitical leaders can come to agreement on final laws.\n\n10Ibid., paragraph 46.\n\n1 1âU.S. to accelerate efforts to implement Dayton Peace Accords,â USIS Washington File,\n\nMay 22, 1997.\n\nCRS-8\n\nStatus of Selected Implementation Provisions\n\nFormation of Governmental Institutions12\n\nThe Dayton peace agreement affirmed the continued existence of the state of\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina. The state consists of two Entities, the Federation of Bosnia\n\nand Herzegovina (largely inhabited by Croats and Bosniaks) and the Republika\n\nSrpska (RS-the Bosnian Serb Republic). The central Bosnian government has very\n\nlimited powers, as specified in the new Bosnian constitution, which forms part of the\n\npeace agreement. All other powers are held by the two Entities. The Entities are\n\nentitled to establish âspecial parallel relationshipsâ with neighboring states (i.e.,\n\nCroatia and Serbia-Montenegro).\n\nThe Bosnian Constitution called for the establishment of six main central\n\ngovernmental institutions: the Presidency, the Council of Ministers; the\n\nParliamentary Assembly; the Constitutional Court; the Central Bank and the Standing\n\nCommittee on Military Matters. The first step to form new Bosnian central\n\ngovernment institutions after the September 14, 1996 elections was taken with the\n\nfirst meeting of the three-person Bosnian collective Presidency on September 30,\n\n1996 in Sarajevo. The Presidencyâs three members are Bosniak Alija Izetbegovic\n\n(who is chairman of the Presidency), Serb Momcilo Krajisnik and Croat Kresimir\n\nZubak. The Presidency approved the membership of the countryâs new central bank\n\non October 29, 1996. The bank is charged with setting Bosniaâs monetary policy.\n\nThe formation of the Council of Ministers for the central government was\n\nrepeatedly delayed due to disputes over issues such as who would chair the body,\n\nwho would be appointed as ministers and where the government would meet. After\n\nthree months of deadlock (due in large part to Bosnian Serb obstruction), the 42-\n\nmember Bosnian House of Representatives met for its first working session on\n\nJanuary 3, 1997, and approved a Bosnian central government. The new government\n\nis led by two co-chairmen. Bosniak Haris Silajdzic and Serb Boro Bosic alternate on\n\na weekly basis in chairing the government. Croat Neven Tomic is the vice chairman\n\nof the government. The government has only three ministries. The Minister of\n\nForeign Trade and Economy is Bosniak Mirsad Kurtovic. The Bosnian Foreign\n\nMinister is Croat Jadranko Prlic. The Minister of Civil Affairs and Communications\n\nis Serb Spasoje Albijanic. Each minister has two deputies representing the other two\n\nethnic groups. The other house of the Bosnian Parliamentary Assembly, the 15-\n\nperson House of Peoples, met for the first time on January 3, 1997.\n\nIn October 1996, the European Court of Human Rights nominated three judges\n\nas the international members of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Constitutional Court. The\n\nHouse of Representatives of the Federation elected two Bosniak judges to the Court\n\non January 24, 1997 and two Croat judges on March 18. The judges from Republika\n\nSrpska were appointed by the National Assembly of Republika Srpska on March 16.\n\n12Prepared by Steven Woehrel, Specialist in European Affairs.\n\nCRS-9\n\nThe first working session of the Court, devoted to organizational issues, was held on\n\nMay 23, 1997.\n\nOn June 1, 1997, the Standing Committee on Military Matters was formed. The\n\ncommittee is charged with coordinating the activities of the two entities. It consists\n\nof the three Presidency members, the defense ministers of the entities, the\n\ncommanders of the armed forces of the entities, and a representative of the Bosnian\n\nforeign ministry. The establishment of the committee completed the setting up of the\n\nkey governmental institutions called for in the peace agreement.\n\nThe protracted delays in forming these common institutions have been followed\n\nby even more glacial progress in taking concrete action. Wrangling over a package\n\nof critical economic legislation submitted by the Office of the High Representative\n\n(the âQuick Start Packageâ) continued for months. The package (including laws on\n\nthe central bank, foreign debt, foreign trade, customs policy and tariffs, a Law on\n\nImmunity, and a Law on the Budget and Budget Execution) was only approved by\n\nthe Parliamentary Assembly on June 20, 1997 after warnings by the international\n\ncommunity that a Bosnia aid conference could not go forward without passage of the\n\nlegislative package. Action on other critical legislation continued to be stymied,\n\nhowever.\n\nFrustrated at the deadlock, the High Representative, with the backing of the\n\nPeace Implementation Council, said at the December 1997 Bonn peace\n\nimplementation conference that he would exercise his authority to set the timing,\n\nlocation and chairmanship of meetings of the common institutions; to impose interim\n\nmeasures on the parties until they reach agreement on an issue; and remove from\n\noffice officials who are absent from meetings of the central institutions without good\n\ncause or who are in violation of legal commitments made under the Peace Agreement\n\nor the terms for its implementation. The warning appeared to be aimed at Bosnian\n\nSerb officials, who have obstructed the central government's work. On December 16,\n\n1997, the High Representative imposed an interim law on citizenship. On December\n\n24, the High Representative imposed three more laws: a customs tariff schedule and\n\ntwo laws on land mines. It is unclear how interim laws will be implemented if a side\n\nrefuses to abide by the High Representative's decision.\n\nThe Federation and Croat-Bosniak Relations. The Federation was established\n\nin March 1994 with the mediation of the United States, but continuing Bosniak-Croat\n\ntensions stymied efforts to fully implement it. One stumbling block has been the\n\ndesire of Croat nationalists, particularly in western Herzegovina, to unite with Croatia\n\nrather than form a federation within Bosnia with the Bosniaks (Muslims).13 Under\n\nU.S. pressure, Bosnian Croats agreed to dissolve their Herceg-Bosnia para-state and\n\nmerge its functions into the Federation by August 31, 1996. Little discernable\n\nprogress toward this goal was achieved until December 19, 1996, when Bosnian\n\nCroat leader Kresimir Zubak announced that Herceg-Bosnia had been abolished, that\n\nits government and ministries had stopped functioning, and that power had been\n\n13For background information on the Federation, see Congressional Research Service.\n\nBosnia Muslim-Croat Federation: Key to Peace in Bosnia?, by Steven Woehrel. CRS Report\n\n96-526F. June 7, 1996.\n\nCRS-10\n\ntransferred to Federation institutions. Despite this announcement, Herceg-Bosnia\n\ninstitutions (as well as institutions of the wartime Bosniak government) continue to\n\nfunction. An October 1997 report by EU investigators charged that both Bosniak and\n\nCroat officials have diverted Federation revenues to finance these institutions. At its\n\nDecember 1997 meeting in Bonn, the Peace Implementation Council (PIC),\n\ndemanded their elimination.\n\nOn September 14, 1996, voters in the Federation elected a new parliament and\n\nnew canton legislatures. The newly-elected Federation parliament held its first\n\nsession on November 6, and approved a federation flag, coat-of-arms and seal. The\n\nparliament also chose the Federation members to the Bosnia-Herzegovina House of\n\nPeoples. On December 18, 1996, the Federation parliamentâs House of\n\nRepresentatives approved a new post-election 14-minister Federation government.\n\nBosniak Edhem Bicakcic was elected as Federation Prime Minister. Croat Drago\n\nBilandzija was elected as Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister. Croat Ante\n\nJelavic was elected as Federation Defense Minister. Bosniak Mehmed Zilic was\n\nchosen as Interior Minister. Each minister has a deputy from the other ethnic group.\n\nA key aspect of setting up Federation government structures is the establishment\n\nof canton and municipal governments. Under the Federation constitution, the\n\ncantons have their own constitutions, legislatures, governments and courts, as well\n\nas wide-ranging powers in police matters, education, housing and other areas.\n\nDuring the September 14, 1996 elections, voters chose new cantonal assemblies.\n\nFormation of canton constitutions and governments, as well as determining cantonal\n\nand municipal boundaries, has been a difficult process, particularly in two formerly\n\nethnically mixed areas where the Croat-Bosniak conflict was especially bitter, in\n\nCentral Bosnia canton and Neretva (central Herzegovina) canton. Similar difficulties\n\nhave occurred in forming municipal governments in some areas after the September\n\n13-14, 1997 municipal elections.\n\nMostar and Sarajevo. A particularly contentious issue has been the\n\nreunification of Mostar. This city, the second-largest in the Federation, has been\n\ndivided since brutal Croat-Bosniak fighting and ethnic cleansing in 1993-1994\n\ncreated a purely Croat western Mostar and a crowded, impoverished, Bosniak eastern\n\nMostar. Croat leaders in Mostar have strongly resisted past U.S. and international\n\nefforts to reunite the city. The European Union administered the city beginning in\n\n1994. Efforts focused on freedom of movement between Croat and Bosniak areas,\n\nthe establishment of a unified police force, a crackdown on organized crime (rampant\n\nin west Mostar and reportedly linked with local government officials), and the return\n\nof refugees to their homes. However, few of these objectives were achieved (with\n\nthe exception of token joint police patrols), due mainly to the intransigence of\n\nMostarâs Croat leaders, many of whom view the Federation with deep suspicion.\n\nEuropean Union-monitored local elections for Mostar took place on June 30,\n\n1996 without incident, a positive sign. However, the big winners were the main\n\nCroatian and Bosniak nationalist parties, while non-nationalist groups did poorly.\n\nThe Bosniak Party of Democratic Action (SDA) won a slight majority over the\n\nCroatian Democratic Union (HDZ), due to large Bosniak majorities from polling\n\nplaces set up in Western Europe for refugees. The HDZ refused to recognize the\n\nfinal results of the vote, complaining of irregularities. After intense U.S. and\n\nCRS-11\n\nEuropean Union pressure, the HDZ reversed its position. The city council met and\n\nelected Croat Ivan Prskalo as mayor and Bosniak Safet Orucevic as deputy mayor on\n\nAugust 14. On December 31, 1996, the European Unionâs mandate to administer\n\nMostar expired. The city is now administered by still bitterly divided local\n\nauthorities, with the assistance of a local office of the High Representative. New\n\nlocal elections were held in Mostar on September 13-14, 1997. Another threatened\n\nHDZ boycott was avoided after a last-minute change of the election rules.\n\nThere has also been controversy over the Federationâs largest city, Sarajevo. In\n\nMarch 1996, Bosnian Croat leaders protested against the formation of a cantonal\n\ngovernment for Sarajevo composed largely of Bosniaks, which they viewed as\n\nignoring Croat interests. The two sides subsequently agreed to jointly work out a\n\ncomplex, multi-layered administration for Sarajevo, including canton, city and\n\ndistrict governments. However, talks over the next year moved very slowly. On\n\nOctober 25, 1996, the sides agreed on a Protocol on the Organization of Sarajevo.\n\nOn March 27, 1997, leaders of the parties represented in the Sarajevo Canton\n\nAssembly signed an agreement on establishing a City Council, electing a mayor of\n\nSarajevo and his Deputies, and to amend the Federation and canton constitutions.\n\nHowever, the city council of Sarajevo was not established, and the Bonn peace\n\nimplementation conference called for the council to be established by December 31,\n\n1997.\n\nForming a Unified Federation Army and Police Force. Creating a joint\n\nFederation army from the Bosniak-dominated ARBiH and the Bosnian Croat HVO\n\nhas been one of the most difficult issues in integrating the Federation. Mistrust\n\nbetween the two armies still lingers from the war they fought against each other just\n\nover two years ago. The ARBiH wants the Federation Army to be as integrated as\n\npossible at the lowest levels, while the HVO wants to keep its army intact, under a\n\nnominal joint Federal high command. After months of pressure from the United\n\nStates, the Federation parliament passed a Defense Law on July 9, 1996 that\n\nestablished a Ministry of Defense and a joint command structure. Slow\n\nimplementation of the law prompted further U.S. pressure, and Bosniak and Croat\n\nleaders agreed on October 2, 1996 to establish a joint command for the federal\n\narmy. On January 29, 1997, the two sides announced an agreement on the\n\norganization of the Federation Ministry of Defense and the Joint Command.\n\nBoth sides also have also agreed to build common police forces. Earlier\n\ndiscussions on this issue had been stymied by issues as trivial as the color of the\n\nuniforms to be worn by the police officers. The formation of ethnically balanced\n\ncantonal police forces have encountered particular difficulties have occurred in the\n\nNeretva and Central Bosnia cantons, and in Sarajevo and Mostar.\n\nThe Republika Srpska. The Republika Srpska, the other entity within Bosnia-\n\nHerzegovina, moved more rapidly to set up its structures and start legislative work\n\nafter the election, largely because the government and parliament are dominated by\n\nthe nationalist Serbian Democratic Party (SDS). Bosniak members of the RS\n\nNational Assembly (elected by refugees from the RS living on Federation territory)\n\nparticipate in the work of the National Assembly, despite having refused to take an\n\noath of office that would have required them to pledge loyalty to Christianity and kiss\n\na crucifix.\n\nCRS-12\n\nHigh Representative Carl Bildt expressed concern in a April 1997 report to the\n\nU.N. Security Council that many Republika Srpska laws and institutions continue to\n\nrefer to RS statehood, and assert some control over issues such as foreign affairs,\n\nforeign economic policy and foreign exchange that are in the jurisdiction of the\n\nBosnian central government, according to the peace agreement. Bildt also criticized\n\nthe February 28, 1997 agreement between the RS and the Federal Republic of\n\nYugoslavia and Republika Srpska on establishing a âspecial parallel relationship,â\n\ncharging that provisions on setting up a customs union between the RS and FRY\n\nwere contrary to the peace agreement, and that the agreement must be reviewed by\n\nthe Bosnia-Herzegovina Parliamentary Assembly and brought into line with the\n\nBosnia Constitution. In addition, Bildt noted that the fact that the agreement was\n\nsigned not by RS President Biljana Plavsic, but by Momcilo Krajisnik, the RS\n\nmember of the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina, was a violation of the RS\n\nConstitution.\n\nA constitutional crisis emerged within the Republika Srpska in June 1997 during\n\na power struggle between RS President Plavsic and fellow SDS members who\n\nsupport ousted SDS leader and indicted war criminal Radovan Karadzic. Plavsic\n\nattempted to fire RS Interior Minister Dragan Kijac for obstructing an investigation\n\ninto two Bosnian Serb companies associated with Karadzic and Krajisnik, who\n\nPlavsic charges have been engaged in massive corruption. Plavsic also charged that\n\nKaradzic continues to control the SDS, the government and police from behind the\n\nscenes. Plavsic ordered the dissolution of the RS National Assembly on July 3 and\n\nnew elections. The RS government, led by Karadzic supporter Premier Gojko\n\nKlickovic, canceled Plavsicâs decree, in violation of the RS Constitution.\n\nNew elections for the RS parliament were held on November 22-23, 1997.\n\nNeither the SDS and its hard-line ally the Radical Party, nor Plavsic's supporters were\n\nable to win a majority in the sharply divided parliament, which held its inaugural\n\nsession on December 27, 1997. President Plavsic has proposed a non-party RS\n\ngovernment of experts, but the hardliners have expressed opposition to the idea.\n\nStatus of Implementation and Future Milestones. The main central and\n\nentity governmental institutions have been formed, after long delays. Problems\n\ncontinue to exist in disputed cantons and municipalities within the Federation. While\n\nsome progress has been made in formally creating new institutions, it should be\n\nstressed that they are very far from functioning effectively. Central government\n\ninstitutions have been stymied by the refusal of Bosnian Serb representatives to\n\nattend meetings of the presidency, government and parliament. The passage and\n\nimplementation of key legislation needed to integrate Bosnia and revive its economy\n\ncontinues to lag. Central government ministries and the Constitutional Court have\n\nnot been properly financed and staffed.\n\nStatus of the Brcko Region\n\nAt the Dayton peace talks, perhaps the most intractable issue was the status of\n\nthe strategic Brcko region in northeast Bosnia, which forms a key corridor between\n\nSerb-held regions in western Bosnia and Serbia. The peace agreement did not\n\nresolve the issue, but called for binding international arbitration by December 14,\n\nCRS-13\n\n1996 to determine who would control the region, held at that time by the Bosnian\n\nSerbs. The three-member arbitral tribunal would include one member from the\n\nFederation, one member from the Republika Srpska and one member chosen by the\n\nPresident of the International Court of Justice, who would serve as presiding officer.\n\nU.S. mediator Roberts Owen was chosen for this post. On December 8, 1996, the\n\narbitral tribunal postponed its decision for another two months.\n\nFaced with the irreconcilable positions of the two sides, who threatened to go\n\nto war over the issue, Roberts Owen announced on February 14, 1997 that a final\n\ndecision on the status of Brcko would be postponed until March 15, 1998. Until\n\nthen, a Deputy High Representative for Brcko would supervise the implementation\n\nof the peace accord in the region, with the authority to issue binding orders to local\n\nauthorities that would supersede local laws, if necessary. Implementation tasks\n\ninclude ensuring freedom of movement, the return of refugees, preparing the way for\n\nfree and fair local elections in September 1997, and promoting economic recovery\n\nin the region. An expanded international police presence in the region is aimed at\n\neasing the process. At a Brcko implementation conference on March 7, 1997, High\n\nRepresentative Carl Bildt appointed U.S. diplomat William Farrand as the Brcko\n\nsupervisor. On March 31, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1103,\n\nincreasing International Police Task Force (ITPF) strength by 186 police and 11\n\ncivilian personnel for deployment to Brcko. The Brckoâs supervisorâs office was\n\nopened on April 11, 1997. Municipal elections were held in Brcko on September 13-\n\n14, 1997, without major incidents. On December 31, 1997, a 230-man, multi-ethnic\n\nBrcko police force began operations and Farrand appointed judges for Brcko's multi-\n\nethnic judiciary. On January 5, 1998, a multi-ethnic Brcko government held its first\n\nsession.\n\nArms Control14\n\nAnnex 1-B of the Dayton peace agreement covered so-called âregional\n\nstabilizationâ efforts, referring to arms control at regional and sub-regional (within\n\nformer Yugoslavia) levels and confidence-building measures (see following section).\n\nThe purpose of the arms control negotiations was for the parties to achieve balanced\n\nand stable force levels at the lowest possible numbers.\n\nArms stabilization measures were launched in mid-December 1995 with a\n\nconference in Bonn, Germany. The Balkan parties agreed to engage in separate\n\nnegotiations on sub-regional arms control (âArticle IVâ) and on confidence-building\n\nmeasures (âArticle IIâ). Negotiations on regional (involving the former Yugoslavia\n\nand neighboring countries) arms control (âArticle Vâ) were to be undertaken under\n\nthe auspices of the OSCEâs Forum for Security Cooperation.\n\nThe objective of the sub-regional level of negotiations was to establish a regime\n\nof limits on military equipment in the categories laid out in the 1990 Treaty on\n\nConventional Forces in Europe (âCFE treatyâ). The parties and OSCE were given\n\n180 days to conclude negotiations. The annex did not specify any enforcement\n\nmechanisms for compliance with the future accord. Were talks to break down or fail\n\n14Prepared by Julie Kim.\n\nCRS-14\n\nto conclude by 180 days (June 11, 1996), the annex provided a fail-safe formula on\n\narmaments limits along a 5:2:2 ratio: the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia would be\n\nlimited to 75 percent of a predetermined baseline of collective arms holdings; Croatia\n\nwould be limited to 30 percent; and Bosnia and Herzegovina 30 percent. Within\n\nBosnia, the ratio of holdings between the Federation and Bosnian Serb Republic\n\nwould be two to one.\n\nNegotiations in Vienna got off to a rocky start in early January 1996. First, the\n\ntalks were delayed one day over a dispute over the use of the term âRepublika\n\nSrpskaâ at the talks, and compromise arrangements on terminology had to be made.15\n\nFurther progress became stalled after the Yugoslav delegation did not provide OSCE\n\nwith information on its holdings of heavy armaments by the 30-day, or January 13,\n\ndeadline. Yugoslav authorities insisted that technical difficulties, not a lack of\n\npolitical will, prevented them from meeting the deadline. Talks briefly adjourned,\n\nwhile Yugoslavia was given more time to turn in its data lists to negotiations\n\nchairman General Vigleik Eide, but resumed on January 23. In February, however,\n\nthe Bosnian Serbs suspended all contacts with the Bosnian government in protest of\n\nthe capture of a few top Bosnian Serb military leaders (two of whom were eventually\n\nbrought to the Hague tribunal). The Bosnian Serbs briefly boycotted further\n\nstabilization talks in Vienna. Bosnian Serb leaders have repeatedly expressed\n\ndissatisfaction with the default disarmament terms within Bosnia (2:1 between the\n\nFederation and Bosnian Serb republic) outlined in the peace agreement.\n\nOSCE negotiators aimed to have an agreement initialed on June 6 and signed\n\non June 11. The basic principles for arms limitations were agreed to on June 6.\n\nHowever, last minute disputes broke out over the political status of the Republika\n\nSrpska; this time it was over whether the RS should be considered an equal party to\n\nthe agreement or an âentityâ subordinated to Bosnia and Herzegovina, as demanded\n\nby the Bosnian government. The Bosnian Federation also disputed the weapons\n\nstocks that were reported by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n\nFinally, the accord on sub-regional arms control was signed on June 14 at the\n\nFlorence Peace Implementation Council review meeting. The agreement set ceilings\n\non five categories of armaments (tanks, armored combat vehicles, artillery, combat\n\naircraft, and attack helicopters) along the same ratio as in the Dayton agreement (see\n\ntable, below). The agreement did not apply to small arms or military equipment\n\ncomponents. The terms of the accord were to be implemented in phases and\n\ncompleted within 16 months from July 1, 1996 (November 1997). Notwithstanding\n\nthe agreement, implementation of the build-down and verification mechanisms will\n\nultimately determine the success of the accord. The accord named the parties to be\n\nresponsible for verification, with the assistance of the High Representative.\n\n1 5 The agreed designations were âparties to the Dayton agreement Annex 1B, Article 4.â\n\nReuters, January 5, 1996.

In October 1996, the United States charged that the Bosnian Serb armed\n\nforces were under-reporting their equipment holdings âto an egregious degreeâ and\n\nwere thus not meeting their treaty commitments. The Bosnian Serbs were allegedly\n\n16\n\nunderreporting their holdings and attempting to retain their heavy weapons by\n\nexploiting accounting rules in the arms control agreement. Firm accounting of\n\nequipment holdings remains a difficult task. Estimates on the actual holdings of\n\nBosnian Serb artillery pieces, for example, vary significantly. In April 1997, High\n\n17\n\nRepresentative Bildt noted that equipment reporting needed improvement, and that\n\nFederation authorities still needed to determine allocations within the Federation.\n\nNATO forces have seized and destroyed unauthorized weapons found in Bosnia. In\n\nNovember, the OSCE determined that the former Yugoslav parties had fully\n\ncomplied with their treaty obligations.\n\nPrior to Dayton, many observers of the Bosnia conflict believed that the arms\n\nimbalance favoring the Bosnian Serbs, coupled with the U.N. arms embargo holding\n\nthe imbalance in place, were major contributing factors to the outbreak and duration\n\nof the war. A Clinton Administration priority, shared by many in Congress, has been\n\nto promote an equilibrium of forces on the ground via a program to train and equip\n\nthe Bosnian Federation forces. While the Administration supports arms control\n\nnegotiations to bring about and implement a âbuild-downâ of Bosnian forces and\n\narmaments, it has asserted that arms control measures would not preclude\n\ninternational efforts to equip and train the Bosnian Federation forces, provided such\n\nefforts remained consistent with the terms of lifting the arms embargo. The United\n\nStates and Turkey co-sponsored an international conference on raising financial\n\nsupport for a train-and-equip program for the Bosnian Federation armed forces on\n\nMarch 15, 1996. On June 26, President Clinton certified compliance with the\n\n16Department of State Daily Press Briefing, October 29, 1996.\n\n17The New York Times, October 19, 1996, p.

After the Federation\n\nparliament passed a common defense law on July 9, President Clinton gave final\n\napproval for the train and equip program, which subsequently included two\n\nshipments of military equipment. The Dayton peace agreement itself does not\n\ncontain any provision corresponding or referring to the U.S.-led program to equip and\n\ntrain the Bosnian federation to establish a self-defense capability.\n\n18\n\nIn the Dayton peace agreement, the parties agreed not to import any arms for 90\n\ndays, and any heavy weapons for 180 days. The U.N. Security Council passed a\n\nresolution on November 22, 1995, lifting the U.N. embargo on armaments and\n\nmilitary equipment to the former Yugoslavia in phases consistent with the peace\n\nagreement. The arms embargo was fully terminated on June 18, 1996.\n\nOSCE Role. Germany sponsored an initial disarmament conference in Bonn\n\non December 18, 1995. The parties agreed to commence regional stabilization talks\n\nin two groups: one on arms control, and one on confidence-building measures, both\n\nunder the auspices of the OSCE. Negotiations for sub-regional arms control resumed\n\non January 5, 1996, in Vienna.\n\nThe OSCEâs Forum for Security Cooperation (FSC) was tasked with organizing\n\nand conducting negotiations on an arms control agreement. General Vigleik Eide of\n\nNorway was named OSCE Personal Representative of the OSCE Chairman-in-Office\n\nand chair of the negotiations.\n\nThe Agreement on Sub-Regional Arms Control created a sub-regional\n\nconsultative commission, headed by the OSCE Personal Representative, to oversee\n\nimplementation of the provisions of the accord.\n\nStatus of Implementation and Future Milestones.\n\n! Within 30 days of the Paris peace conference, the five parties (representing\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the\n\nRepublika Srpska, Croatia, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) were to\n\nhave commenced negotiations, under OSCE auspices, on armaments levels.\n\nBoth sets of negotiations began before the deadline. By the same time, they\n\nwere to have submitted information on their holdings of heavy weapons. This\n\nrequirement was met on January 23, after Yugoslavia was given an extension.\n\n! The December Bonn conference set a deadline for arms control negotiations\n\nfor June 6, 1996, with a signing on June 11. After some last-minute disputes,\n\nthe arms limitation agreement was signed on June 14. The limitation levels\n\nare to be implemented in phased stages within 16 months from July 1, 1996.\n\nThe agreement adhered to the default ratio of 5:2:2 of the baseline of\n\narmament holdings among Serbia-Montenegro, Croatia, and Bosnia and\n\nFor\n\n18\n\nfurther information on the equip and train policy, see Congressional Research Service.\n\nBosnia: U.S.-Led Train-and-Equip Program, by Steven Woehrel.

The U.N. ban on the import of small arms ended on March 13, 1996, or 90\n\ndays after the Paris peace conference, while the ban on heavy weapons\n\nremained in force for another 90 days. The arms embargo was fully lifted on\n\nJune 18, 1996.\n\n! The baseline validation period extended from August 18 until October 31,\n\n1996. Numerous inspections were carried out during this period. Reductions\n\nof arms stockpiles covered by the accord began in October. First phase\n\nreductions, with a target of 1,700 pieces of military hardware, were to have\n\nbeen completed by December 31, 1996. Before leaving his post in June 1997,\n\nHigh Representative Carl Bildt charged that both Bosnian parties were not\n\nmeeting agreement deadlines. All reductions were to be completed by\n\nNovember 1, 1997.\n\n! On November 21, 1997, OSCE reported full compliance by the parties on\n\nfulfilling their reduction requirements under the arms control agreement. A\n\ntotal of nearly 6,600 heavy weapons were neutralized, and most of these were\n\ndestroyed.\n\n! At the Bonn PIC conference, the Council underlined the importance of starting\n\nthe Article V process, regional arms control, without delay.\n\nConfidence-building Measures19\n\nArticle II of the annex on regional stabilization addresses confidence-and\n\nsecurity-building measures (CSBMs) in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Negotiations,\n\nconducted under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\n\nEurope, were to devise an agreement on a series of measures to enhance mutual\n\nconfidence, increase military transparency, and reduce the risk of renewed hostilities.\n\nNegotiations were to draw fully upon the OSCEâs 1994 Vienna Document of the\n\nNegotiations on Confidence- and Security-Building Measures.\n\nNegotiations on confidence-building measures aimed to increase transparency\n\nthrough the exchange of information on numbers and locations of weaponry, troops,\n\nand arms production facilities. They also sought to impose restrictions on military\n\nmovements. At Vienna, the parties (from the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina,\n\nthe Muslim-Croat Federation, and the Bosnian Serb Republic) agreed first to set up\n\nmilitary liaison missions in Sarajevo.\n\nOn January 26, 1996, the parties signed an agreement outlining a set of\n\nconfidence-building measures focusing on information-sharing, consultation and\n\ncommunication mechanisms, constraints on military operations and exercises,\n\nmilitary contacts and visits, and a verification and inspection regime. Fifteen areas\n\nof confidence-building measures were covered by the agreement. They included: the\n\n19Prepared by Julie Kim.\n\nCRS-18\n\nexchange of military information; notification of changes in command structure or\n\nequipment holdings; risk reduction; notification of certain military activities;\n\nrestrictions on military deployments; restraints on reintroduction of foreign forces;20\n\nwithdrawal of forces and heavy weapons to barracks; restrictions on locations of\n\nheavy weapons; notification of disbandment of irregular armed groups; identification\n\nand monitoring of weapons manufacturing; military contacts and cooperation; non-\n\nproliferation; verification and inspection regime; communications; and\n\nimplementation assessment. The agreement went into force immediately. Lead\n\nnegotiator Istvan Gyarmati of Hungary hailed the âsubstantial packageâ and\n\nespecially noted the accompanying verification regime.\n\nOn March 13, Ambassador Gyarmati expressed satisfaction with cooperation\n\non implementing the agreement on CSBMs. International teams arrived in Bosnia\n\non March 11 to conduct verification inspections on military data on both Federation\n\nand Bosnian Serb republic territory. OSCE reported that the parties had carried out\n\nall of the agreementâs inspections in 1996. In April 1997, the High Representative\n\n21\n\nreported that implementation of the CSBMs continued to proceed satisfactorily.\n\nA different kind of confidence-building measure contained in the peace\n\nagreement addressed prisoners of war. Annex 1A on military aspects included\n\nprovisions on the mutual commitment to release and transfer all prisoners within a\n\nset time frame. At the time of the deadline, only some 200 persons had been\n\nreleased, leaving about 700 still in detention. The Bosnian government expressed\n\nreluctance to release all of its prisoners before it received information from the\n\nBosnian Serbs on tens of thousands of missing persons. In early 1996, the U.S.\n\nAdministration strongly pressed for the immediate release of all prisoners, in\n\naccordance with the peace agreement, which did not link prisoner release to the issue\n\nof missing persons. Then-Secretary of State Christopher indicated that the provision\n\nof U.S. reconstruction and military aid would be conditional on the partiesâ\n\nadherence to the peace agreement. Later, the contact group threaten\n\n22\n\ned to put off the\n\ndonorsâ reconstruction aid conference scheduled for mid-April until the Bosnian\n\nparties had met their obligations to release all prisoners. Under ICRC supervision,\n\nover half of the remaining 200 prisoners were released by the end of March and early\n\nApril. ICRC has emphasized that no party has any valid reasons to continue to detain\n\nprisoners. By the end of 1997, approximately 1,100 prisoners of war were released\n\nunder ICRC supervision.\n\nThe issue of missing persons remains important to the Bosnian parties. In\n\nOctober 1996, ICRC estimated that approximately 14,000 persons remained missing,\n\nsome of whom could be subjected to hidden detention. International observers have\n\nalso reported numerous incidents of arbitrary arrest and detention.\n\nA\n\n20\n\nll forces of foreign origin were required to leave the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nby January 13, 1996, a requirement that remained unfulfilled for months.\n\n2 1 General Accounting Office (GAO/NSIAD-97-132), Bosnia Peace Operation, May 1997,\n\np. 39.\n\n22Reuters, January 23, 1996; State Department Daily Press Briefing, January 24, 1996.\n\nCRS-19\n\nOSCE and ICRC Roles. The Organization on Security and Cooperation in\n\nEurope opened confidence and-security-building negotiations in Vienna on January\n\n4, 1996. Negotiations, chaired by Istvan Gyarmati of Hungary, concluded on January\n\n26 with an initial set of measures to enhance mutual confidence. The Vienna\n\nagreement established a Joint Consultative Commission (JCC), comprised of high-\n\nlevel representatives of each party and the High Representative, to oversee\n\nimplementation. The JCC met for the first time on February 28, in Sarajevo. OSCE\n\nhas also established international monitoring and verification teams to implement\n\nterms of the agreement.\n\nWith regard to prisoner exchanges and missing persons, the International\n\nCommittee of the Red Cross has been the lead international agency overseeing this\n\nprocess. The peace agreement stated that the ICRC was to enjoy full and unimpeded\n\naccess to all paces where prisoners were being kept.\n\nStatus of Implementation and Future Milestones.\n\n! As required by the peace agreement, lists of prisoners were provided to the\n\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross on January 4, 1996. Since Dayton,\n\napproximately 1,100 prisoners have been released.\n\n! On January 5, at the Vienna negotiations, the parties agreed to set up military\n\nliaison missions in Sarajevo within ten days. The missions were established\n\non January 15.\n\n! By thirty days of the transfer of authority, or January 19, 1996, all prisoners\n\nwere to have been released. On the day of the deadline, ICRC representatives\n\nreported that less than one-third of registered prisoners had been released. By\n\nDecember 1997, about 1,100 prisoners of war had been released. The High\n\nRepresentative has cited evidence of detained persons who had not been\n\nregistered with the ICRC.\n\n! Within forty-five days of the peace conference, negotiations on confidence-\n\nand-security-building measures were to have been completed. Negotiations\n\nin Vienna were concluded on January 26. The first on-site inspections were\n\ncarried out on March 11-12. Ambassador Gyarmati has reported full\n\ncompliance thus far with the Vienna agreement on CSBMs. Further military\n\ninspections, one on Federation territory and one on Bosnian Serb territory,\n\nwere successfully carried out in mid-March. OSCE-led inspections continued\n\nuntil the end of June 1996.\n\nElections23\n\nThe early holding of free and fair elections was considered to be an essential\n\nprecondition for stable, democratic and representative governance in Bosnia and\n\nHerzegovina. The Peace Agreement called for open contests for representatives in\n\nnewly-created institutions and offices. Elections were envisaged for: the three-\n\n23Prepared by Julie Kim.\n\nCRS-20\n\nmember presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina; the 42-seat House of Representatives\n\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina (which will then select delegates to the 15-seat House of\n\nPeople); the House of Representatives of the Bosnian Federation; the National\n\nAssembly of the Bosnian Serb Republic; the Presidency of the Bosnian Serb\n\nRepublic; and, for local municipalities and cantonal governments within the\n\nFederation. Elections for political institutions at all levels above the municipal level\n\n(i.e., state, entity, and Federation canton) were held on September 14, 1996. The\n\nmunicipal vote was repeatedly postponed and is currently scheduled to be held on\n\nSeptember 13-14, 1997.\n\nIn Annex 3 of the peace agreement, the parties agreed to ensure that conditions\n\nexist for the organization and conducting of free and fair elections. They requested\n\nthat the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) provide\n\nassistance in organizing and supervising elections. Elections were to take place six\n\nmonths, or no later than nine months if a delay proved necessary, after the agreement\n\ncame into force. An OSCE election commission was to adopt electoral rules on party\n\nand candidate registration, on voter and candidate eligibility, and on voter\n\nregistration. OSCE was to supervise an open and fair campaign as well as all other\n\naspects of the electoral process, and organize elections monitoring missions.\n\nThe elections annex defined an eligible voter to be any citizen of Bosnia and\n\nHerzegovina aged 18 or older and registered in the 1991 census for Bosnia and\n\nHerzegovina. A provisional electoral list containing approximately 3.2 million\n\nvoters, based on the 1991 census, was drawn up by the provisional election\n\ncommission. As a general rule, citizens were expected to vote where they lived in\n\n1991. They could alternatively submit an absentee ballot for that municipality, or\n\napply to the commission to cast their ballots elsewhere. About 4,000 polling stations\n\nwere opened throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina. The constitution (Annex 4 of the\n\nDayton peace agreement) barred persons indicted by the International Tribunal for\n\nthe Former Yugoslavia from holding or seeking appointive, elective, or other public\n\noffice.\n\nPost-Dayton conditions in Bosnia and Herzegovina posed severe challenges to\n\nthe effort to hold prompt elections. Lack of progress in certain areas of peace\n\nimplementation and the general environment on the ground threatened to put off a\n\ndecision to hold elections on schedule. Certain pre-conditions for a free, fair, and\n\ndemocratic vote were outlined in the peace agreement: a politically neutral\n\nenvironment free from fear and intimidation; freedom of expression, association, and\n\nthe press; freedom of movement; and freedom of return for displaced persons and\n\nrefugees.\n\nOSCE was to decide by mid-June 1996 whether or not to approve of holding\n\nelections that September. Many observers, including OSCE officials, questioned\n\nwhether elections should go forward under such adverse conditions. They pointed\n\nto the lack of progress in refugee return, restrictions on freedom of movement,\n\nrestrictions on the independent media, and the continued political control practiced\n\nby indicted war criminals. The Clinton Administration was strongly in favor of the\n\nvote, arguing that delay would not improve the situation, but would rather strengthen\n\nforces for ethnic separation and partition. The United States also argued that\n\nelections were a prerequisite to the formation of the necessary political institutions\n\nCRS-21\n\nand entities envisaged by the peace agreement. OSCE Chair-in-Office Flavio Cotti\n\neventually on June 25 issued certification for the elections to take place on September\n\n14, 1996, even though he asserted that virtually none of the prerequisites for a free\n\nand fair vote had been fulfilled. Cotti concluded, however, that âthere are no\n\nconvincing alternativesâ to holding elections.24\n\nThe decision to hold elections in September was most seriously challenged by\n\nthe continued presence in power of Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and\n\nGeneral Ratko Mladic, both indicted by the Tribunal and ineligible by the Dayton\n\nagreement to run for or hold political office. At the end of June, Radovan Karadzic\n\ndevolved most presidential powers to the RS Vice President, Biljana Plavsic, but did\n\nnot formally resign. Moreover, Karadzic was elected to chair his party, the Serbian\n\nDemocratic Party (SDS). Most international officials deemed Karadzicâs move\n\nunacceptable, and called for his full resignation as president and leader of the party.\n\nOSCE officials threatened to disqualify the SDS from the elections as long as\n\nKaradzic retained a position in the party. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, chief\n\narchitect of the Dayton peace agreement, returned to the former Yugoslavia in mid-\n\nJuly to pressure Serbian President Milosevic with sanctions unless Karadzic was\n\nremoved from power in Republika Srpska. On July 19, Karadzic signed an\n\nagreement on fully relinquishing his positions as president of Republika Srpska and\n\nof the SDS. Karadzic also pledged to withdraw from all political activities and not\n\nappear in the media. A shortcoming of the Holbrooke agreement was that it did not\n\ncall for Karadzicâs extradition, leaving open the possibility of continued, âbehind the\n\nscenes,â activity by the former RS president. The agreement also did not address the\n\nstanding of General Mladic who remains in firm control of the RS armed forces.\n\nA sort of âtest caseâ for the September elections were the municipal elections\n\nin Mostar. After some delay, elections were held in the European Union-\n\nadministered city of Mostar on June 30. The cityâs Muslim, Croat, and Serb voters\n\ncast ballots for the city assembly and local administrations in six municipalities. The\n\nresults largely confirmed Mostarâs split along ethnic lines between Muslims and\n\nCroats. Moreover, the Croatian HDZ party at first refused to accept the election\n\nresults. EU administrator for Mostar Ricardo Perez Casado nevertheless pointed to\n\nmany successes in the voting process. Voter turnout was about 60%, a good deal\n\nhigher than anticipated. Voters were able to cast ballots where they had resided in\n\n1991, even when this involved crossing ethnic lines within the city. A strong IFOR\n\npresence and numerous EU and other international monitors contributed to area\n\nsecurity and other practical challenges to the voting process in Mostar. In addition,\n\nrefugees were able to cast remote ballots in designated European cities.\n\nNational and Entity Elections, September 1996. As the September 1996\n\nelection date approached, evidence mounted of âelection engineeringâ through the\n\nregistration process. In an apparent attempt to skew the district voting results in\n\nstrategically located municipalities, significant numbers of refugees, primarily ethnic\n\nSerbs, utilized the option of registering to vote where they âintendedâ to live. While\n\nthe Dayton agreement allowed for the possibility of registering in a different location,\n\ninternational officials viewed that widespread manipulation of the registration\n\n24Declaration of the OSCE Chairman-in-Office, Vienna, June 25, 1996.\n\nCRS-22\n\nprocess would seriously distort the elections at the local level. As a result, OSCE\n\nchair Ambassador Frowick formally postponed the municipal elections on August 27,\n\nbut reaffirmed higher level elections for September 14.\n\nAbsentee balloting for refugees living abroad commenced on August 28. Over\n\n640,000 refugees from 55 countries had registered to vote. The absentee vote\n\nconstituted a substantial portion of the overall vote.\n\nElections in Bosnia and Herzegovina were held on September 14, 1996, under\n\nOSCE supervision with IFOR assistance. OSCE, IFOR, and the IPTF designated and\n\nestablished 19 secure routes across the IEBL for persons voting across entity lines.\n\nFewer security problems than expected surfaced, in large part due to the relatively\n\nsmall number of persons (about 20,000) who crossed the IEBL to cast their ballots.\n\nAccording to the High Representative, the elections were held in a âcalm, orderly and\n\ndignified manner,â with âno serious restrictions to freedom of movement.â Th\n\n25\n\ne\n\nCoordinator for International Monitoring, Edward van Thijn, assessed that the\n\nelections went well from a technical viewpoint, but that the general climate\n\nsurrounding the elections indicated numerous imperfections. Clinton Administration\n\nofficials called the elections a âremarkable achievement,â and a âvictory for the\n\ndemocratic process.â\n\nIn contrast, some human rights observers reported numerous instances of\n\nirregularities at the polling stations, cases of voter intimidation, and extensive\n\nlimitations on freedom of movement. After the vote, one international monitoring\n\ngroup, the International Crisis Group (ICG), asserted that the preliminary election\n\nresults, when considered against OSCE estimates on the number of eligible voters,\n\nrevealed a voter turnout of well over 100%, indicating likely fraud. OSCE officials\n\ncountered by revising their estimate on the number of eligible voters. The ICG also\n\nasserted that the elections should not have been declared free, fair or democratic.26\n\nIn response to complaints filed by the Party for Democratic Action and by the\n\nInternational Crisis Group, the election appeals subcommittee issued a\n\nrecommendation on September 27 that the ballots be recounted in order to rebuff\n\ncharges of voter fraud. The provisional election commission, however, overruled the\n\nrecommendation, and Ambassador Frowick certified the election results on\n\nSeptember 29. The results provided by the OSCE are as follows:\n\n2 5Report from the High Representative for Implementation of the Peace Agreement,\n\nSeptember 29, 1996, S/1996/814.\n\n26ICG Bosnia Report No. 16, Elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina, September 22, 1996.\n\nCRS-23\n\nResults: B-H Presidency\n\nWinner\n\nNo. of votes\n\napprox % of vote\n\nw/in group\n\nChairman: Alija Izetbegovic (SDA)\n\n730,592\n\n80%\n\nMomcilo Krajisnik (SDS)\n\n690,646\n\n90%\n\nKresimir Zubak (HDZ)\n\n330,477\n\n65%\n\nResults: B-H House of Representatives\n\nParty\n\nNo. of votes\n\nSeats/42\n\nFederation: SDA\n\n725,417\n\n16\n\nHDZ\n\n338,440\n\n8\n\nJoint List\n\n105,918\n\n2\n\nParty for B-H\n\n93,816\n\n2\n\nRS: SDS\n\n578,723\n\n9\n\nSDA\n\n184,553\n\n3\n\nAlliance for\n\n136,077\n\n2\n\nPeace/Progress\n\nResults: RS Assembly\n\nParty\n\nNo. of votes\n\nSeats/83\n\nSDS\n\n568,980\n\n45\n\nSDA\n\n177,388\n\n14\n\nAlliance for Peace/Progress\n\n125,372\n\n10\n\nSerb Radical Party\n\n72,511\n\n6\n\nDemocratic Bloc\n\n32,895\n\n2\n\nParty for B-H\n\n25,593\n\n2\n\nResults: RS President\n\nCandidate\n\nNo. of votes\n\napprox % of vote\n\nBiljana Plavsic (SDS)\n\n636,654\n\n60\n\nAbid Djozic (SDA)\n\n197,389\n\n18\n\nZivko Radisic (Alliance for\n\n168,024\n\n16\n\nPeace/Progress)\n\nResults: Federation House of Representatives\n\nCRS-24\n\nParty\n\nNo. of votes\n\nSeats/140\n\nSDA\n\n725,810\n\n78\n\nHDZ\n\n337,794\n\n36\n\nJoint List\n\n105,897\n\n11\n\nParty for B-H\n\n98,207\n\n10\n\nAs widely expected, the nationalist parties and candidates won majorities in\n\neach entity. The term of office for all of those elected in September 1996 is two\n\nyears. Some observers feared that the results would further mark the differences\n\nbetween the ethnic groups and facilitate an eventual division of Bosnia along ethnic\n\nlines. At the national Bosnian level, the political will of the elected officials,\n\nespecially the Bosnian Serbs, to construct and support joint governmental institutions\n\nhas been weak at best. Other observers pointed to the gains of the opposition\n\nparticularly in the Serb republic as positive signs of fledgling political plurality. The\n\nruling SDS received less than a two-thirds majority in the entity parliament, and the\n\nMuslim vote via absentee balloting secured a second-place showing for the SDA.\n\nOpposition parties are expected in some areas to make a stronger showing in the\n\nmunicipal vote.\n\nMunicipal Elections, September 1997. In October 1996, the municipal\n\nelections were postponed for a second time until 1997. In January 1997, the\n\nProvisional Election Committee set July 12-13, 1997, as a target date. In March,\n\nhowever, the OSCE ruled that additional time for preparation was needed, and further\n\npostponed the election date until September 13-14.\n\nThe problem of voter registration options for refugees and displaced persons\n\nwas reviewed by the OSCE. The ruling Bosnian Serb party conditioned its\n\nparticipation in the municipal vote on the continued option for refugees to vote in\n\nareas of intended residence, while the Muslim SDA insisted on the abolition of this\n\noption. On January 28, 1997, the PEC adopted new rules and regulations for the\n\nmunicipal elections. All prospective Bosnian voters had to re-register for the local\n\nvote. The PEC upheld the principle of allowing refugees to register where they\n\nintended to live, but established stricter rules for this option. Refugees must prove\n\nwith documentation legitimate reasons for registering with a particular municipality.\n\nVoter registration opened on May 5 and extended to June 28. Ethnically mixed\n\nor disputed cities, such as Brcko, were considered to be especially susceptible to\n\nattempts at registration manipulation, since the voting outcome in these cities may\n\nbe especially significant for both entities. In response to specific cases of registration\n\nviolations, the Election Appeals Sub-Commission has imposed penalties on Bosnian\n\nSerb and Bosnian Croat political parties, primarily by striking various party\n\ncandidates from party lists. Pervasive registration violations observed in Brcko\n\nprompted the OSCE to close registration centers in that city in June and establish a\n\nnew registration process.\n\nCRS-25\n\nOSCE estimated that approximately 2.5 million persons had registered for the\n\nSeptember vote. 93 parties registered to participate in the vote in a total of 136\n\nmunicipalities. As IFOR had, SFOR assisted OSCE with security and logistical\n\nassistance for the elections, and little violence was reported on the election days. An\n\nestimated 87% of registered voters participated in the vote. OSCE mission chief\n\nRobert Frowick called the September vote a âgreat achievement.â\n\nOverall, nationalist Serb, Muslim, or Croat parties won the largest shares of the\n\nvote. Only in Tuzla did non-nationalist parties win a majority in the local council.\n\nIn Brcko, Bosnian Serb parties won a majority of city council seats. In Srebrenica,\n\nthe Muslim Party for Democratic Action won a majority, even though virtually no\n\nMuslims have returned to Srebrenica since they were driven out in mid-1995. The\n\nMuslim victory was achieved through the option of absentee voting. Ethnic Serb\n\nparties won a majority in the western city of Drvar, currently controlled by Croats but\n\nformally with an ethnic Serb majority. In Mostar, the Muslim Party for Democratic\n\nAction won a majority over the Bosnian Croat party.\n\nImplementation of the municipal election results was thought to be problematic.\n\nThe OSCE pressed for swift formation of the local councils and assemblies, holding\n\nout on final certification until the local political bodies were in place and functioning.\n\nBy the end of 1997, 133 out of 136 municipal councils had convened their inaugural\n\nmeetings. The exceptions were Srebrenica, Zepce, and Vares.\n\nRS Special Elections, November 1997. In July 1997, President Biljana\n\nPlavsic dissolved the RS parliamentary assembly and called for new elections. Mrs.\n\nPlavsicâs new party, the Serb Peopleâs Alliance, aimed to break the stronghold of the\n\nhardline Serb Democratic Party (SDS), the party of Radovan Karadzic. Javier\n\nRuperez was appointed Special Representative of the OSCE to supervise the RS vote\n\nscheduled for November 22-23. Nearly 70% of voters in the RS participated. On\n\nNovember 24, Mr. Ruperez stated that the election represented âa step forwardâ, and\n\ndetermined that is was well administered from a technical standpoint. He noted,\n\nhowever, that the political environment in the RS fell short of democratic standards.\n\nOn December 7, OSCE announced the provisional results of the RS vote as\n\nfollows. No single party won a majority. An estimated 75% of the population\n\nparticipated.\n\nCRS-26\n\nResults: RS Assembly\n\nParty\n\nSeats/83\n\nSDS\n\n24\n\nCoalition for a Single and Democratic Bosnia\n\n16\n\nSerb Peopleâs Alliance\n\n15\n\nSerb Radical Party\n\n15\n\nRS Socialist Party\n\n9\n\nIndependent Social Democrats\n\n2\n\nOthers\n\n2\n\nOSCE Role. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe was\n\nrequested by the peace agreement to assist in preparing for, organizing, and\n\nmonitoring free elections. OSCE has twice extended its mandate in Bosnia, which\n\ncurrently runs through December 1998. In late 1996, all Bosnian authorities agreed\n\nto OSCE supervision of the municipal elections to be held in 1997. In September\n\n1997, the OSCE agreed to supervise the special Republika Sprska elections in\n\nNovember; 150 international observers monitored the vote\n\nThe Annex on elections in the peace agreement called for the establishment of\n\na Provisional Election Commission. The commission is led by the head of the OSCE\n\nmission. On January 30, 1996, the OSCE designated a seven-member international\n\ncommission to prepare for and supervise elections. It is comprised of OSCE mission\n\nhead Robert Frowick of the United States, representatives from Britain, Germany,\n\nand Canada, and three Bosnian representatives (one from the Bosnian Serb republic,\n\nSlobodan Kovac, one from the Bosnian government, Kasim Begic, and one from the\n\nMuslim-Croat Federation, Mate Tadic). The provisional election commission is\n\neventually to be replaced by a permanent elections commission, comprised of both\n\ngovernment and opposition representatives, after the municipal elections are held.\n\nOSCE fielded 1,200 international monitors to supervise the September 1996\n\nelections out of over two dozen field offices throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina. A\n\nCoordinator for International Monitoring (CIM) office, headed by Edward van Thijn,\n\nwas in charge of the campaign and election day monitoring missions. OSCE has also\n\nsponsored an Open Broadcast Network project to assist in providing television access\n\nto non-governing political parties and candidates. The OSCEâs Media Experts\n\nCommission (MEC) is charged with monitoring media compliance with election\n\nrules and regulations.\n\nIFOR, SFOR, and the IPTF provided extensive support to OSCE in both the\n\nnational/entity and municipal votes. In the September 1996 vote, IFOR units\n\nprovided area security for 19 designated routes across the IEBL, guarded selected\n\npolling stations, and transported ballot boxes and other supplies relating to the\n\nelections. SFOR extended similar assistance to OSCE for the September 1997 local\n\nvote and the November 1997 elections in the Republika Srpska.\n\nCRS-27\n\nStatus of Implementation and Future Milestones.\n\n! On February 23, 1996, the provisional electoral commission adopted a\n\nframework electoral code which established basic rules and regulations for the\n\nBosnian elections. The framework document included decisions on several\n\nissues, including the basic approach to voter registration, the registration of\n\npolitical parties, and access to the media. The provisional election\n\ncommission published a provisional voter list, based on the 1991 census, at\n\nthe end of March.\n\n! On April 22, the provisional election commission adopted formal rules and\n\nregulations for the elections. All Bosnian citizens were to be given the option\n\nof voting where they were registered, or by applying to vote by absentee ballot\n\nor in a different municipality (i.e. where they currently live).\n\n! Originally scheduled for May 31, the Federation held municipal elections in\n\nMostar, which has been under European Union administration, on June 30.\n\nThe EU validated the election results.\n\n! Italian Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti, the OSCE Chairman-in-Office, certified\n\non June 25 that elections would go forward on September 14, 1996.\n\nAmbassador Robert Frowick announced the start of the campaign on July 19,\n\nthe day that Radovan Karadzic agreed to relinquish political office. On\n\nAugust 27, OSCE election commission chairman Robert Frowick postponed\n\nmunicipal elections due to widespread abuse of the rules and regulations at the\n\nmunicipal level, but confirmed that elections at the higher levels would\n\nproceed.\n\n! National and entity elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina were held on\n\nSeptember 14, 1996. Elected officials will serve a two-year term.\n\n! On September 29, OSCE chief Robert Frowick certified the results of the\n\nSeptember 14 elections. The validation came in spite of the recommendation\n\ntwo days earlier by the elections appeals subcommission that all ballots be\n\nrecounted. Certification paved the way for the United Nations to terminate all\n\nsanctions against Serbia-Montenegro on October 1.\n\n! After numerous delays, municipal elections were held on September 13-14,\n\n1997.\n\n! Special parliamentary elections were held in the Republika Srpska on\n\nNovember 22-23, 1997.\n\n! At the December 1997 Bonn PIC conference, the PIC established a deadline\n\nof December 31, 1997, for the full implementation of the local election results.\n\nIt also declared that the High Representative and the OSCE would impose\n\nfinal and binding arbitration in places where the local councils and assemblies\n\nhave not yet been certified by February 28, 1998.\n\n! The next national and entity elections are to be held by September 1998.\n\nCRS-28\n\nCivil Police Task Force27\n\nThe Dayton Peace Agreement requested that an international police task force\n\n(IPTF) be formed to assist the Bosnian parties establish a safe and secure\n\nenvironment. The task forceâs program of assistance outlined in Annex 11 included:\n\nmonitoring and observing law enforcement activities, advising and training local\n\nenforcement personnel and authorities, facilitating law enforcement activities, and\n\naccompanying local law enforcement personnel in joint patrols as they carry out their\n\nresponsibilities.\n\nIn the first year, the task forceâs limited mandate involved primarily monitoring\n\nand observing. As in other U.N. civilian police operations, IPTF officers are\n\nunarmed. The task force does not have any executive authority in a law enforcement\n\ncapacity, and therefore cannot arrest or detain persons (including war criminals). It\n\nis intended not to establish conditions of law and order by itself, but to assist Bosnian\n\nFederation and Republika Sprska law enforcement agencies achieve this and to report\n\non any violations.\n\nIn view of the importance of an effective police force to establishing and\n\nmaintaining conditions of peace and security, many observers have criticized the\n\nweak mandate of the U.N. police task force, as well as its small size. NATO and\n\nU.N. officials at first expressed dissatisfaction with the slow arrival and small size\n\nof the U.N. police task force.28 Some police forces from contributing countries\n\nlacked language and/or driving skills. Since mid-1996, however, the U.N\n\n29\n\n.\n\nSecretary-General reported improvements in regard to the problem of unqualified\n\nmonitors.30 Overall, however, many observers have noted a âpolicing gapâ in the\n\nDayton accords, and have advocated a stronger mandate for the IPTF. In December\n\n1997, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen urged a greater commitment and\n\ncontribution by the European countries to the IPTF.\n\nPolicing functions were explicitly excluded from the mandate of NATOâs\n\npeacekeeping missions. NATO has drawn a sharp distinction between establishing\n\nmilitary security (part of IFORâs and SFORâs mandate) and securing law and order.\n\nNATO officials have insisted that IFORâs and SFORâs role is not to stop crime.\n\nHowever, various cases have demonstrated that policing needs in Bosnia remained\n\nbeyond what the police task force could or was supposed to address. For example,\n\nthe violent and unruly unification of Sarajevo in early 1996 demonstrated a complete\n\nbreakdown of law and order. IFOR expanded its troop presence in the capital\n\nsuburbs, but did not intervene during the incidents of violence and arson in the\n\n27Prepared by Julie Kim.\n\n28The Washington Post, February 2, 1996.\n\nSee\n\n29\n\nThe Washington Post, February 6, 1996, and The New York Times, March 21, 1996.\n\n3 0 Report of the Secretary-General pursuant to Security Council Resolution 1035,\n\nS/1996/460, June 21, 1996.\n\nCRS-29\n\nSarajevo suburbs. In early 1997, SFOR units disengaged from violent incidents in\n\n31\n\nMostar and Gajevi, both involving attacks on unarmed civilians, citing them as\n\nâcriminal acts.â SFOR has taken action against paramilitary, or âspecial policeâ\n\nunits, such as the kind that guard certain indicted war criminals. In August 1997,\n\nSFOR determined that âspecial policeâ forces would be considered as regular\n\nmilitary units and subject to the same restrictions under Dayton as regular armed\n\nforces.\n\nAnother problem has been that local police personnel themselves have been\n\nresponsible for most of the human rights abuses or other violations that obstruct\n\npeace implementation. International agencies have criticized the local police\n\nauthorities of both Bosnian entities for setting up illegal checkpoints, restricting\n\nfreedom of movement, especially for displaced persons, and imprisoning persons\n\nwithout cause. The High Representative has also noted an increase during 1996 in\n\nincidents of police beatings and police participation in politically motivated crimes.\n\nIn some security concerns, the IPTF has worked with the NATO force and other\n\norganizations. In May 1997, IPTF, SFOR, and the High Representative established\n\na Freedom of Movement Task Force that has, among other things, removed illegal\n\ncheckpoints that limit freedom of movement. In December 1997, the High\n\nRepresentative noted improvement in freedom of movement as a result of this\n\nstringent removal of illegal checkpoints. Beginning in August, the IPTF and SFOR\n\nhave conducted weapons inspections in local police stations. Illegal weapons found\n\nduring these inspections were confiscated. The IPTF has also assisted the OSCE in\n\nenhancing security for elections, and has worked with other U.N. agencies on human\n\nrights violations by law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe second functional component of IPTFâs mandate concerns advising and\n\ntraining local police. The IPTF is assisting the parties in planning the reduction,\n\nrestructuring, screening, and training of their police forces. Training and\n\nrestructuring at first progressed only with Federation police. A formal agreement on\n\npolice restructuring between the IPTF and the Republika Srpska was reached in\n\nSeptember 1997. On occasion the IPTF has sought from the respective internal\n\naffairs ministries the removal of certain local police personnel who were not in\n\ncompliance with the peace agreement.\n\nThe December 1996 London Peace Implementation Council conference called\n\non the international community to support IPTFâs continuing efforts to implement\n\nAnnex 11 tasks. It called on the IPTF to focus on the restructuring of local police\n\nforces, including giving advice on the selection, promotion, and dismissal of local\n\npolice officials, investigating allegations of human rights abuses by law enforcement\n\nofficers, and monitoring the treatment of persons detained by local law enforcement\n\nauthorities. In view of this request, the U.N. Secretary-General later recommended\n\nan increase in the size of IPTFâs personnel to fulfill these expanded responsibilities.\n\nIPTF has carried out investigations into human rights abuses by local police\n\nauthorities in Mostar, Brcko, Drvar, and Gajevi.\n\n31For example, see The New York Times and The Washington Post, March 18, 1996.\n\nCRS-30\n\nU.N. Role. The Peace Agreement requested that an international police task\n\nforce be established by the United Nations as a U.N. Civilian Police operation to\n\nadminister a program of assistance. On December 21, 1995, the U.N. Security\n\nCouncil passed Resolution 1035, which authorized the establishment of the\n\nInternational Police Task Force for one year at a strength of 1,721 persons. The U.N.\n\nmandate in Bosnia, including the IPTF, currently extends through June 1998.\n\nThe U.N. police task force is headed by a Police Commissioner who reports to\n\nthe High Representative. The U.N. Secretary-General appointed Peter Fitzgerald of\n\nIreland to be Police Commissioner on January 15, 1996. Manfred Seitner of\n\nDenmark replaced Fitzgerald on March 3, 1997. The IPTF is headquartered in\n\nSarajevo, with five regional headquarters, 17 central police districts, and 109 police\n\nstations, corresponding with locations of local police offices. 40 nations currently\n\ncontribute monitors to the IPTF. Its strength in December 1997 was just over 2,000.\n\nIn March 1997, the U.N. Secretary-General recommended to the Security\n\nCouncil that the IPTF be enlarged to address two additional police tasks: to expand\n\nthe international police presence in Brcko as a result of the February 1997 arbitral\n\ndecision; and to carry out investigative tasks into human rights violations assigned\n\nto the IPTF by the December 1996 London conference. For the former task, the\n\nSecurity Council authorized IPTF strength to be increased by 186 civilian police and\n\n11 civilian personnel on March 31, 1997 (S/Res/1103). On May 16, 1997, the\n\nSecurity Council authorized an additional 120 police personnel for the addition of the\n\ninvestigative function (S/Res/1107). Total authorized strength for IPTF stands at\n\n2,027.\n\nStatus of Implementation and Future Milestones.\n\n! Within 30 days, the Bosnian parties were to have provided the Task Force\n\ncommissioner with information on their law enforcement agencies. This\n\ninformation was provided to the United Nations through a U.N. police\n\nreconnaissance mission conducted in December 1995.\n\n! The task force was assembled and deployed somewhat slowly at first. U.N.\n\nofficials attributed the delay to the reluctance of member countries to release\n\nactive duty police officers from service and to the lack of qualifications of\n\nsome of the monitors.\n\n32 In December 1997, the strength of IPTF reached just\n\nover 2,000 from 40 countries.\n\n! Representatives from over thirty countries met in Dublin, Ireland on\n\nSeptember 28, 1996, to raise funds for the development of a democratic police\n\nforce in Bosnia. The conference sought to raise $99 million in pledges for\n\ntraining and equipping Bosnian civil police.\n\n! The Western European Union (WEU), which had deployed civil police\n\nmonitors to Mostar, transferred authority to the IPTF on October 15, 1996.\n\n32Reuters, January 15, 1996.\n\nCRS-31\n\n! On September 24, 1997, the IPTF concluded an agreement with RS authorities\n\non a police restructuring program in the Republika Srpska.\n\n! At the December 1997 PIC conference, High Representative Westendorp\n\nreported progress in police restructuring in the Federation, and recent\n\nagreements with the RS to begin similar restructuring. However, he noted that\n\nthe police by and large continue to fall below basic standards of conduct.\n\nRefugees and Displaced Persons33\n\nAnnex 7 of the Dayton Peace Agreement states that all refugees and displaced\n\npersons have the right to return to their homes and have their property restored, or\n\nreceive financial compensation. The accords direct UNHCR to repatriate refugees\n\nand return displaced persons to their homes. The agreement also established a\n\nCommission to receive and decide on claims for the return of property or for just\n\ncompensation to these persons. While progress has been made in restoring the\n\ninfrastructure of the country and returning the refugees and displaced to their homes,\n\nit is clear that the process will not be finished as quickly as the international\n\ncommunity anticipated during the peace negotiations.\n\nSince January 1997, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees\n\n(UNHCR) estimates that 110,000 persons from Bosnia from outside the country and\n\n60,000 internally displaced have returned to their areas of origin. In 1996, 88,000\n\nrefugees and 164,000 displaced returned. Most returns have been to areas where the\n\nreturnees are of the same ethnic background as the local majority population, the so-\n\ncalled âmajority return movements.â UNHCR plans to help up to 220,000 refugees\n\nfrom abroad to return to Bosnia-Herzegovina during 1998.
