        "text": "In an emergency meeting today called by the Russian Federation, the Security Council assessed the true level of tensions between the two entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina and debated how the proposed General Assembly resolution on the Srebrenica genocide remembrance could impact that country’s reconciliation and stability. The draft resolution in question, circulated by Germany and Rwanda, would designate 11 July as the “International Day of Reflection and Commemoration of the 1995 Genocide in Srebrenica”.\n\nMiroslav Jenča, Assistant Secretary-General for Europe, Central Asia and the Americas, Departments of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and Peace Operations, noted both positive and worrying developments since July 2023. He cited the European Council decision in March 2024 to open accession negotiations with Bosnia and Herzegovina as “a unique chance for the continent to bridge divides”. However, he warned, “in recent months, we have witnessed actions and statements contradictory to the positive developments.”\n\n“Only by promoting the understanding of the past and addressing the root causes and the continued impact of such violence on society, can sustainable peace be achieved,” he said, pointing to the judgements of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the International Court of Justice that acts of genocide against the Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina were committed in and around Srebrenica in July 1995.\n\nŽeljka Cvijanović, an elected Serb member of the tripartite presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, who was invited to speak in her private capacity, criticized attempts to centralize power by the Bosniaks and their elected representatives. She also warned that High Representative Christian Schmidt, a “colonial governor” and a “classic despot”, interfered in the internal democratic and decision-making processes, thus undermining political consensus which fueled the progress on the country’s path to European Union membership.\n\nSimilarly, the General Assembly resolution on a Srebrenica Remembrance Day is “a blatant example” of foreign interference and disrespect for the country’s constitution, undermining peace and stability. While the Republika Srpska — one of the two entities of the country — advocates for peace and stability, certain Western ambassadors in Sarajevo “seek to instil fear in Serbs” and give credence to the hopes of radical Bosniak forces who seek the elimination of the Serbian entity, with help from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\n\nFor his part, Christian Schmidt, High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, rejected Ms. Cvijanović’s words as “insultation and bad-intended misinterpretation”. He stressed that under the Dayton Agreement, he is the guarantor of the existence of the entities. Warning against continuous inflammatory rhetoric from the Republika Srpska, he recalled that the President of that entity recently declared publicly that Bosniaks can have 25 per cent of the territory, but the rest does not belong to them — a statement seen as “a call for ethnic cleansing.”\n\nHe further warned of challenges to the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina, citing Ms. Cvijanović’s provocative calls to protest and block the administrative inter-entity boundary line. While the security situation has steadily stabilized in military terms, he warned that “Bosnia and Herzegovina can slip into serious political instability”, with denial of genocide, glorification of war criminals and persistent advocacy for dissolving the State creating a divisive environment. This, however, can be prevented by returning to fulfil the requirement of the Dayton Peace Agreement, he said, observing that the warnings of escalation presented today are misleading.\n\nIn the ensuing debate, the representative of the Russian Federation expressed grave concern that the country’s sovereignty has been undermined by “a citizen of Germany, who portrays himself as the High Representative” and operates as “an absolute monarch” on behalf of the United States and the United Kingdom. Turning to the proposed General Assembly resolution on Srebrenica, he warned that if put to vote, it would generate a chain reaction throughout the world, adding: “The people of Bosnia and Herzegovina first need to reach a consensus themselves when it comes to the assessment of their history.”\n\nThe representative of the United States warned against the denial of genocide — including by Republika Srpska President Milorad Dodik. “Srebrenica was not simply a mistake as he [Mr. Dodik] stated — it is an indisputable fact that genocide was committed.” The meeting called by the Russian Federation “is an attempt to use this Council to amplify one party’s ethnonationalist rhetoric and threats”.\n\nSimilarly, France’s delegate rejected Moscow’s depiction of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina as “on the verge of collapse” and stressed that the Assembly draft resolution is not an indictment against any particular people. It is a duty to remember, she added. The speaker for the Republic of Korea raised questions about the necessity of holding today’s meeting, noting that the Council’s regular briefing on the country is already scheduled in two weeks.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina’s representative stated that the true reason for the meeting was to pressure the co-sponsors of the Assembly resolution to withdraw the text. Denouncing the narrative that this resolution is a controversial issue, he stressed: “to allow a failure of this resolution, will, in fact, cause irreparable damage to the credibility of the United Nations as a bastion of rules-based international order.\"\n\nIn response, Marko Đurić, Special Envoy of the President of Serbia, emphasized that all victims of the bloody civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina deserve equal justice and remembrance “regardless of their nationality, race or religion”. He asked “all those who proposed the untimely and uncoordinated draft resolution” to reflect deeply on their “divisive” initiative. Ethnic tensions already ignited by the proposed text are “wreaking havoc in the country”, he stressed. “Healing is impossible if we continually reopen old wounds,” he declared, reiterating a call to put aside the resolution that serves “only to divide”.\n\nCroatia’s representative said that the progress in the European Union integration process proves that “the existing constitutional and political framework of Bosnia and Herzegovina is sufficient to move the country forward if dialogue prevails, cooperation replaces divisions, and when compromise is not considered a failure, but a joint success”.\n\nTHE SITUATION IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA\n\nBriefings\n\nMIROSLAV JENČA, Assistant Secretary-General for Europe, Central Asia and the Americas, Departments of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and Peace Operations, noted both positive and worrying developments since the Security Council briefing in July 2023. He cited the European Council decision in March to open accession negotiations with Bosnia and Herzegovina, based on the bloc’s assessment of progress made on key legislative and judiciary reforms. There is consensus among the political leadership in that country that European integration is the best route for ensuring its future stability and prosperity — a unique chance for the continent to bridge divides despite ongoing challenges. The country’s Council of Ministers in late 2022 sought the support of the United Nations through the Peacebuilding Fund to contribute to strengthening social cohesion, respect for diversity, understanding and trust, especially among young men and women in different communities — with initiatives having begun.\n\nHowever, he warned, “in recent months, we have witnessed actions and statements contradictory to the positive developments outlined above.” The Secretary-General’s Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide has noted concerns about repeated threats of secessionism, promotion of hate speech, denial of genocide and glorification of war criminals who were convicted by local and international courts. She recently issued statements on the dangers of these trends, stressing the importance of addressing the legacy of the past, including of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. “Only by promoting the understanding of the past and addressing the root causes and the continued impact of such violence on society, can sustainable peace be achieved,” he said, affirming that the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the International Court of Justice have established that acts of genocide against the Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina were committed in and around Srebrenica in July 1995.\n\nHe recalled that Secretary-General António Guterres has consistently called on everyone in the region and beyond to counter hate speech and the rhetoric of division and narratives of mistrust and fear. Many people in Bosnia and Herzegovina have for decades undertaken remarkable work to promote trust and reconciliation. He noted that it is primarily the responsibility of authorities and institutions to help the whole of society constructively deal with the past, demonstrate respect for all victims and survivors, and work towards a prosperous and peaceful future for all citizens. He further recalled that the United Nations is not a signatory to the Dayton Peace Agreement, nor a member of the Steering Board of the Peace Implementation Council.\n\nŽELJKA CVIJANOVIĆ, speaking in her private capacity, said that the presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina acts as the collective tripartite Head of State and she is elected from the Republika Srpska, one of the two entities that make up the country. The other two members of the presidency are elected from the entity known as the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. She observed that the country’s constitution was designed to establish a system of these two highly autonomous entities and three constituent peoples with important power-sharing mechanisms. This principle of equality has been the major keeper of peace and stability in the country, where most of major challenges to peace and stability were manipulated and initiated by foreign and domestic political actors seeking to “rewrite” the Dayton Agreement alongside the country’s constitution, laws and international law. These include interference in internal political and democratic processes, use of threat of force, disrespect for the rule of law, and interference in elections.\n\nOn the issue of foreign interference, she criticized attempts to centralize power by the Bosniaks and their elected representatives, stating that such efforts undermine the constitutional framework established by the Dayton Accords. She further cited instances where High Representative Christian Schmidt, a “colonial governor” and a “classic despot”, interfered in the internal democratic and decision-making processes, thus undermining political consensus, which fuelled the progress on the path to European Union membership. Similarly, the General Assembly resolution on a Srebrenica Remembrance Day — drafted without consultation or authorization from the country’s presidency — is “a blatant example” of how foreign interference and disrespect for the country’s constitution undermines peace and stability.\n\nTurning to the use of threat of force, she noted that while the Republika Srpska advocates for peace, stability and the resolution of political and military issues through democratic means, certain Western ambassadors in Sarajevo “seek to instil fear in Serbs” and give credence to the hopes of radical Bosniak forces who seek the elimination of the Republika Srpska with help from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). At the same time, senior Bosniak officials openly threaten violence and war, with the Minister of Security stating that he would “lead 10 Corps [of fighters]” in eliminating the Republika Srpska.\n\nExpressing concern over radicalization and terrorist threats emanating from Bosnia and Herzegovina, which undermines peace in the Western Balkans and across Europe, she said the country has the highest per capita number of citizens who left to wage jihad in Syria and Iraq. Also pointing to the violations of the rule of law, she accused Mr. Schmidt of using “absolute power and no accountability” and amending the criminal code of Bosnia and Herzegovina “to use it as a weapon to punish anyone who disobeys his dictates”. Similarly, the changes to the election law “forced” by the High Representative represent “a clear attempt to interfere with and fix election results in upcoming local elections”. Continual violations of the Dayton Accords by him and his allies pose direct threats to peace and stability in the country, she stressed, demanding immediate condemnation and cessation of these actions.\n\nCHRISTIAN SCHMIDT, High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, said that he was not prepared to answer Ms. Cvijanović’s words, “which I would categorize as insultation” and “bad-intended misinterpretation”. He stressed that under the Dayton Agreement, he is the guarantor of the existence of the entities which are a constitutional part of the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina, “and nobody has any intention to dissolve any of these parts”. He confirmed that there are threats to the peace agreement, as the President and other officials of the Republika Srpska offer continuous inflammatory rhetoric about the dissolution of the State. He recalled that the President recently declared publicly that Bosniaks can have 25 per cent of the territory, but the rest does not belong to them — “which some saw as a call for ethnic cleansing”.\n\nHe further warned of challenges to the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina, citing Ms. Cvijanović’s provocative calls to protest and block the administrative inter-entity boundary line. According to the official EUFOR assessment, the security situation has steadily stabilized in military terms but challenges arise from political tensions between the stakeholders. “Fortunately, so far those tensions have not translated into violence,” he stated. However, he warned that violence against returnees of all ethnic origins has occurred, and “it is my assessment that Bosnia and Herzegovina can slip into serious political instability — but this can be prevented by coming back to fulfil the requirement of Dayton, especially in a time that European Union offers the way to its European integration.”\n\nThe warnings of escalation presented today are misleading, he said, while noting the challenge of historical revisionism via denial of genocide and other war crimes, the glorification of war criminals and the persistent advocacy of dissolution of Bosnia and Herzegovina — which have created a divisive environment. He noted that under the Dayton Agreement, no convicted and sentenced war criminal should run for any public position. The security situation in the country is stable but fragile, with, fortunately, no response to provocations. The project of European Union accession is a way to a promising future for the country, which can only be done on the basis of the Dayton Agreement. “There is a long and bumpy road ahead,” he confirmed, urging all political actors to fully comply with the Agreement and their treaty obligations and cooperate with his Office.\n\nThe confidence of all citizens in stability, democracy and a peaceful future for them and the next generation is paramount, and “such letters as the one we had to take note from Ms. Cvijanović do not serve the solemn duty of all those staying in responsible positions for the well-being of the country — just the opposite,” he stressed.\n\nStatements\n\nThe representative of the Russian Federation pointed to the deterioration of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including the “systematic unforgivable breach” of the core principles of the Dayton Agreement, calling on the Council to play a role of prevention. He expressed grave concern about the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which has been undermined by “a citizen of Germany, who portrays himself as the High Representative” and operates as “an absolute monarch” on behalf of a small group of foreign States, namely the United States and the United Kingdom. Turning to the proposed General Assembly resolution on Srebrenica, he warned that if put to vote, it would generate a chain reaction throughout the world, adding: “The people of Bosnia and Herzegovina first need to reach a consensus themselves when it comes to the assessment of their history.” Accusing Western capitals of ongoing efforts to centralize the country, which contradicts the polycentric structure envisioned for a multinational Bosnia and Herzegovina, he urged the international community to facilitate an equal and respectful dialogue among the country’s peoples.\n\nThe representative of Japan said that since 1995 — when the brutal conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina ended — the country has transitioned from conflict to peace. Sustaining peace and stability is a prerequisite for the future prosperity of the country, the Western Balkans and beyond. As a member of the Peace Implementation Council Steering Board, Japan supports Bosnia and Herzegovina’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and national unity, she said, expressing concern about the recent heightened tension in the country. “Any attempt to undermine the Dayton Peace Agreement should be avoided,” she stressed, voicing support to the role of High Representative while also urging all parties to continue peaceful and constructive dialogue.\n\nThe representative of Ecuador noted with concern the divergences in the tripartite presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the tensions and divisions that challenge peaceful and multiethnic coexistence in the country. He called on all stakeholders to constructively address current political disputes and avoid the use of any inflammatory rhetoric, ethnic or religious, that could fuel tension. Underlining the importance of strengthening implementation of the Dayton Agreement to ensure respect for aspirations and rights of the two entities and the three constituent peoples, he further urged all parties to cooperate with the Office of the High Representative and avoid unilateral actions that could violate the constitutional, legal and institutional order under the agreement.\n\nThe representative of Algeria said that the Dayton Agreement succeeded in ending the war and laying the foundations for a democratic Bosnia and Herzegovina, where Bosnian, Croats, and Serbs live side by side in harmony. Stressing the importance of respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, he underscored the importance of State-owned solutions to issues facing sovereign countries. “The Dayton Agreement remains the only consensual basis containing vital provisions for Bosnia and Herzegovina,” he emphasized, calling on all parties to work together and preserve consensus, especially on issues that could lead to political tensions. Political parties and constituencies should avoid antagonism and favour dialogue and negotiations, especially about questions that could trigger controversy, he stressed.\n\nThe representative of Switzerland stressed the importance of political stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina, expressing “full confidence” in EUFOR Althea, which has indicated a steady improvement in the country’s security situation. Voicing concern about the actions emanating from the Republika Srpska, which “promote division and undermine the institutions of the State,” she called on all leaders “to give priority to the interests of the country”. For that reason, she stressed the need to refrain from any secessionist action or threat, safeguard human rights, ensure justice and promote social cohesion. “Historical revisionism, the glorification of war criminals and the denial of genocide and war crimes have no place in a peaceful, multi-ethnic society,” she stressed. Commending Bosnia and Herzegovina on the progress it has made in key reforms, she encouraged all parties to focus on the opportunities arising from the decision on accession to the European Union.\n\nThe representative of the United States stated that “today’s meeting called by the Russian Federation is an attempt to use this Council to amplify one party’s ethnonationalist rhetoric and threats”. He warned that the continuation of actions — by some political leaders, including Republika Srpska President Milorad Dodik — that deny genocide was committed during the war is a serious concern. “Srebrenica was not simply a mistake as he [Mr. Dodik] stated — it is an indisputable fact that genocide was committed,” as established by international criminal tribunals and the International Court of Justice. He thereby welcomed the decision by the High Representative to prohibit persons who have committed genocide from standing for elections. Mr. Dodik has taken steps to undermine State institutions and regularly calls for the dissolution of the country, with his secessionist rhetoric threatening peace and stability in the region. Noting that the United States has sanctioned Mr. Dodik to induce him to operate within Bosnia and Herzegovina law, he affirmed that the Office of the High Representative plays a central role in ensuring implementation of the civilian aspects of the Dayton Agreement. The Office must remain until the country fulfills the agreed-upon criteria.\n\nThe representative of Guyana warned that an uneven implementation of the Dayton Agreement, divisive rhetoric and rising political and ethnic tensions are stymieing the country’s development. Noting that signing of the Agreement represented a commitment to peace and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Balkan region, she emphasized the need for ongoing efforts towards its complete implementation through constructive interethnic dialogue. Noting the long-lasting repercussions of using threats of secession as a political instrument, particularly in a multi-ethnic society, she urged all parties “to work assiduously” to mitigate possible negative consequences, respect diversity and prioritize nation-building. Further, she called on the parties “to engage in dialogue and redouble efforts around genuine reconciliation” and make all efforts towards de-escalation of current tensions.\n\nThe representative of Mozambique observed that human rights violations, attacks against returnees and discrimination persist, casting a shadow over Bosnia and Herzegovina’s development. That country’s experience demonstrated that nation-building is not possible without reconciliation, healing, trust-building and political commitment. Voicing concern that the fundamental rights of freedom of peaceful assembly and association are not adequately guaranteed under current legislation, he called on all parties to renounce nationalist and divisive rhetoric and uphold the principles of the Dayton Accords. Comprehensive transitional justice measures, including urgent substantive reforms to the rule of law, are crucial to preventing further deterioration and fostering stability. In addition, concerted efforts are needed to repair the harm resulting from past violence and work towards fostering stability, inclusion and cooperation. Against that backdrop, he called on the international community to support peaceful and multi-ethnic coexistence in the country.\n\nThe representative of Slovenia said his country “spared no effort” to help initiate Bosnia and Herzegovina’s accession to the European Union. Membership is a “powerful motivation for reforms” that would allow all ethnic groups, particularly their youth, to pursue their dreams within their own country, guaranteeing the country’s long-term stability, peace and development, he stressed. Underscoring that “the Dayton Peace Accords remains the cornerstone of peace and post-war institutional framework of the country,” he warned against “de-legitimizing the presence of international community and perpetuating conflicting narratives.” For that reason, “the Council must be careful not to give platform to an alternative, politically biased narrative”, which only deepens the divisions within the country. Instead, the Council should support the Dayton Agreement and the High Representative’s work, focusing on “the most important for Bosnia and Herzegovina — its European future”.\n\nThe representative of the Republic of Korea raised questions about the necessity of holding today’s meeting, given that the Council’s regular briefing on the country is already scheduled in two weeks. Nearly three decades since the signing of the Dayton Agreement, sustainable peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina remains elusive. For that reason, it is “essential to not forget the past and learn lessons from it,” he said, calling on all parties to redouble their efforts to achieve a full implementation of the Agreement. Voicing concern about the recent increase in separatist rhetoric, he opposed any action that undermines or jeopardizes the Agreement. “To turn a new page and move forward, it is incumbent on all political leaders to encourage tolerance and inter-ethnic understanding,” he stressed.\n\nThe representative of China noted that Bosnia and Herzegovina is a sovereign State and its internal affairs should ultimately be managed by its people independently. He expressed concern that the recent violations and challenges to the tripartite system established under the Dayton Agreement have further deepened ethnic divisions in the country. The international community should respect the views and concerns of the three ethnic communities of the country. Imposing external solutions or even unilateral sanctions will only exacerbate tensions. “The armed conflict that took place in former Yugoslavia in the 1990s is a dark chapter in history, marked by casualties among innocent civilians from all ethnic groups,” he recalled. His country has long advocated never forgetting history to prevent recurrence of such tragedies. Sponsors of the General Assembly resolution should fully consult with key parties concerned, as the differences are inconsistent with maintaining peace and stability in the Western Balkans and Europe.\n\nThe representative of the United Kingdom affirmed that the Council is set to discuss Bosnia and Herzegovina in two weeks, expressing doubt that the current situation warrants urgent discussion. Despite current tensions, the overall situation remains stable. Encouraging Bosnia and Herzegovina authorities to work together on the necessary steps to enable the negotiating framework to be adopted, he called on the leaders of Republika Srpska to cease their secessionist rhetoric and actions, which threaten this progress. “What happened in Srebrenica was one of the worst crimes in Europe since the Second World War,” he said, recalling that the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia Appeals Chamber unanimously found in its judgment of April 2004 that genocide was committed in Srebrenica. “That is not a political statement,” he stressed. “It is the judgment of an international court. And to say so is not a criticism of Serbia.”\n\nThe representative of France noted that while the Russian Federation called an emergency meeting, depicting Bosnia and Herzegovina on the verge of collapse, his delegation does not share that dramatic assessment, even if the attitude of Republika Srpska leaders arouses concern. The European Council’s decision to open accession negotiations sent a clear signal: the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina is in the European Union. She voiced regret that this was followed by serious threats from the President of the Republika Srpska entity, Milorad Dodik, against the unity of the country. It is regrettable that Moscow is once again seeking to exploit the work of the Council, in the context of the General Assembly draft resolution — which is not an indictment against any particular people, calling on the duty to remember. An international presence in Bosnia-Herzegovina remains necessary for the stability of the country and the region, she affirmed.\n\nThe representative of Sierra Leone noted that the establishment of the entities of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska was not intended to perpetuate ethnic or political divide or reinforce separatist sentiments, deploring all actions that threaten the territorial integrity and stability of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He commended that country’s Government on progress made in the implementation of the Dayton Accords, highlighting the creation of its constitution and the establishment of a constitutional court. He also commended steps taken for its candidacy for accession to the European Union. Underscoring the Council’s role in supporting de-escalation of tensions and encouraging dialogue among the key actors, he emphasized the need for cooperation with all other actors within the Steering Board of the Peace Implementation Council for full implementation of the 5+2 agenda and in resolving the deepening gridlock between State actors and the Office of the High Representative.\n\nThe representative of Malta, Council President for April, spoke in her national capacity to voice concern over setbacks that risk jeopardizing progress achieved over the past months. Hoping that any rifts at the political level do not translate into heightened tensions, she called on the country’s leadership to refrain from inflammatory rhetoric and divisive actions. All parties must work constructively within the parameters of the Dayton Agreement, she said, adding: “In this context, we have strong reservations about the value of this meeting in contributing to defusing tensions, especially since it was neither requested nor supported by Bosnia and Herzegovina.” While welcoming the decision to open European Union accession negotiations with the country, she encouraged the adoption of necessary reforms and emphasized the need for them to be meaningful and inclusive. On that, she voiced concern over recent legislative initiatives, encouraging all parties to focus efforts on enacting coherent legislation through coordinated institutions.\n\nThe representative of the Russian Federation, taking the floor a second time, expressed concern about Western permanent members of the Council showing no interest in stabilizing Bosnia and Herzegovina but rather focusing on blaming one of its constituent peoples and turning a blind eye on the “egregious violations” of the country’s constitution and the Dayton Agreement. He criticized the participation of Mr. Schmidt in the meeting, accusing him of subversive actions without repentance. Likewise, Western countries camouflage their illegal actions in Bosnia and Herzegovina by accusing the Russian Federation of instrumentalizing the Council’s meeting to spread disinformation. At the same time, Western countries push their own rules-based order, which “has nothing to do at all with the international law”.\n\nThe representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina said that today’s meeting has nothing to do with concerns over the situation in his country but rather represents an abuse of power in the Council to promote a one-sided narrative. By convening this meeting in the absence of a clear request from the Head of State or a communication from EUFOR Althea, the Council has “degraded” the institution of the presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He further criticized the circulation of a letter from a member of the presidency of Republika Srpska as a pretext for the meeting, noting that the letter represents the territorial unit rather than the official State positions, and thus undermines the constitutional order.\n\nTurning to the critical challenges faced by the country over the past few years, he detailed violations of the Dayton Agreement by the Republika Srpska, including through creating preconditions for the possible future secession as well as by denying the verdicts of the United Nations courts on the genocide. The true reason of this meeting was an attempt to pressure the co-sponsors of the General Assembly resolution on the “International Day of Reflection and Commemoration of the 1995 Genocide in Srebrenica” to withdraw the text, he stressed. “The culture of remembering the victims of the genocide in silence is not and must not be a culture of denial but culture of memory,” he said, noting that the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia confirmed the fact of genocide in its judgements, which form the rationale for establishing the international day. Denouncing the narrative that this resolution is a controversial issue, he stressed that its goal is to encourage the process of justice, truth and trust in the country and the wider Balkan region. “To allow a failure of this resolution, will, in fact, cause irreparable damage to the credibility of the United Nations as a bastion of rules-based in international order […],” he concluded.\n\nMARKO ĐURIĆ, Special Envoy of the President of Serbia, said he was addressing the Council to protect the Dayton Agreement, peace and stability in the Balkans region, and to protect the memory and the dignity of more than 100,000 victims of the bloody civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. “All of these victims, regardless of their nationality, race or religion, deserve equal justice, deserve equal treatment and deserve equal remembrance and respect in front of the international community,” he stated. Bowing his head equally and unequivocally to all the victims of the war in the country, he asked “all those who proposed the untimely and uncoordinated draft resolution on Srebrenica to reflect deeply once again on their divisive initiative.” The resolution, launched without consensus within Bosnia and Herzegovina in clear and blatant violation of its constitutional order, has, instead of reconciliation, caused the convening of an emergency Council session – which should be sufficient for its initiators to withdraw the proposed text and go back to the drawing board.\n\nThe degree of ethnic tensions already ignited by the proposed resolution “is wreaking havoc in the country,” he stressed. The proposed resolution was drafted, proposed and cosponsored by Mr. Zlatko Lagumdzija without the legally required consent from the tripartite presidency of the country — without consulting the Serbian entity, or any attempt to acknowledge more than 100,000 other victims of the war. He noted that Serbia has continuously and consistently condemned all crimes of the tragic conflict, particularly the Srebrenica massacre, horrific and standing out by its scale and cruelness. He further asked those who initiated the resolution what they would say to Serbian victims of torture and slaughter. “Are these victims less worthy of remembrance?” he asked, calling for putting aside “resolutions that serve only to divide”.\n\nThe representative of Croatia congratulated Bosnia and Herzegovina on the opening of accession negotiations for membership in the European Union this March, adding that such progress demonstrates how far the country can advance, once there is sufficient political will and cooperation. In that context, he commended the crucial role played by the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina, led by Chairwoman Borjana Krišto. Such progress proves that the existing constitutional and political framework of Bosnia and Herzegovina is sufficient to move the country forward if dialogue prevails, cooperation replaces divisions, and when compromise is not considered a failure, but a joint success. He went on to encourage focus on European integration and further reforms, including electoral reform, which should establish genuine equality among constituent peoples — Croats, Bosniaks and Serbs — and guarantee the fundamental rights of each citizen as a cornerstone of political stability.\n\nMs. CVIJANOVIĆ, taking the floor a second time, noted that she and Mr. Schmidt are present in a personal capacity. She criticized the lack of reaction from the country’s leadership to the threats of violence and war made by senior officials against the Republika Srpska and expressed regret that Mr. Schmidt did not comment on these issues."
