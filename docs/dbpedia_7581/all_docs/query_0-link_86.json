        "text": "Literally this entire project was inspired by this Tweet. I started thinking about it and before I could help it I’d made a map and a flag and then some more maps and then a list of Prime Ministers and then—well, this post. I put a ridiculous amount of effort into this and I tried to be realistic within the parameters I set up but it should be understood totally as a Alien Space Bats timeline without much attempt at plausibility.\n\nThe United Federation of Democratic States is a trans-continental union of forty-four states, stretching across much of Europe, North America, Australia, and parts of Latin America and Northeast Asia. The UFDS has land borders with Mexico, Colombia, Nicaragua, Brazil, Suriname, Switzerland, Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, Morocco, Moldova, Serbia, Turkey, North Macedonia, Albania, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Malaysia, and North Korea. It is the largest country on Earth in terms of area, containing 33,983,617 km2, and the third-largest in population, with 1,146,700,000 people as of the 2020 census.\n\nFormed in 1997 initially as a union of twenty-five states, the UFDS brought together most of the world’s leading democracies and high-developed economies into a single superstate ostensibly dedicated to fulfilling the post-WWII and post-Cold War promises of a united, democratic, and prosperous world.\n\nThe UFDS is a federal parliamentary constitutional republic, with an elected President, Prime Minister, and bicameral legislature. It is a liberal democracy, and scores well on most measures of quality of life, human rights, economic freedom, judicial independence, and education. It has the largest GDP in the world, is the world’s largest importer and exporter of goods, and holds over 50% of the world’s total wealth. The Federal Defense Force is responsible for over 50% of the world’s military spending, and maintains bases in at least twenty-one other countries. The UFDS’s economic and military position has been described as ‘hegemonic’, and many scholars consider it to be the world’s first true hyperpower.\n\nHistory\n\nOrigins: 1941-1997\n\nThe End of History: 1997-2001\n\nHegemony: 2001-2008\n\nCrisis & Consolidation: 2008-2020\n\nThe Uncertain Future: 2020-2022\n\nMember States\n\nCompacts of Free Association\n\nAffiliated States\n\nGovernment & Politics\n\nPresident\n\nPrime Minister\n\nFederal Parliament\n\nPolitical Parties\n\nCulture\n\nEconomy\n\nForeign Affairs\n\nForeign Policy\n\nGlobal Responses\n\nHistory\n\nOrigins : 1941-1997\n\nThe roots of the United Federation of Democratic States can be traced back to the Allied Powers of the Second World War, when President Roosevelt of the United States of America and Prime Minister Churchill of the United Kingdom first began to trace the outlines of what a postwar world might look like in documents such as the Atlantic Charter and the Declaration of the United Nations. Together, they began to assemble a set of governing principles: international cooperation, self-determination, freedom of trade, peace among nations, social welfare, and democratic self-government. These would go on to become, at least in theory, the foundational beliefs of the so-called ‘Free World’.\n\nThe rapid spiral of tensions between the United States and USSR starting in 1945 after the defeat of Nazi Germany, and the onset of the Cold War soon afterwards, put an end to initial hopes of a new global era of peace and cooperation, but the Western Powers continued to pursue the work begun in Newfoundland and Arcadia. In 1957, the Treaty of Rome was signed by Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, founding the European Union. In 1962, Canada, Mexico, the United States, and the Bahamas joined together as the North American Community. Efforts at integration between these supra-national organizations began almost immediately, and during the 1970s a number of agreements were signed on tariff standardization, ease of immigration, defense planning, and political economic coordination. However, hopes of a more permanent global union remained unfulfilled.\n\nThat began to change, however, with the end of the Cold War, the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The sudden triumph of liberal capitalist democracy had created a new world, one in which the dreams of liberal internationalism seemed achievable. Many scholars referred to this concept as “The End of History”. Under this rubric, the 20th century had seen a series of global ideological conflicts between liberal democracy and its enemies; first dynastic monarchism, then fascism, finally communism. Now, it was time for the “Free World” to take its place as the rightful guider and governor of the world. This first received high-level endorsement in President George H.W. Bush’s “New World Order” speech on September 12th, 1990, during the First Gulf War. Three months later, the U.S. President, High Commissioner Jacques Delors of the European Union, and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan signed the Washington-Brussels-Tokyo Accord, declaring their intention to establish a “general union of states”.\n\nActual implementation of the Accord would take years, and it was not until 1993 that the Treaty of Maastricht was ratified, committing its signatories to establishing a federal government. The process was not without controversy–most notably Mexico’s withdrawal from the North American Community in protest–but the complex, multifaceted work of writing a new constitution and convincing twenty-five sovereign states to accept it continued apace. On January 1st, 1997, the Articles of Federation came into force, formally establishing the United Federation of Democratic States.\n\nThe End of History: 1997-2001\n\nThe early years of the UFDS were marked by a sense of national optimism and a firm belief that the Federation was marked by “destiny” as the inevitable future of the world. The merger of sovereignty had instantly capitulated the new Union into position as the richest and most powerful nation on Earth, by virtually any metric, and almost immediately a dozen other nations filed petitions of membership. The advent of the Digital Revolution played into this sense of a ‘New Era’ that would bring mankind together, and the explosion of economic growth fueled by the establishment of a Free Trade zone covering virtually every developed economy in the world created a belief in limitless future prosperity.\n\nFormer U.S. President Bill Clinton served as the UFDS’s first Prime Minister, leading a National Unity coalition of all parties. Despite perennial problems of gridlock and infighting within the Federal Parliament under the surface, Clinton’s avuncular personality and loose ideological convictions helped sell the post-partisan dream. Federal intervention in the breakup of Yugoslavia was only intermittently popular, but helped create the image of a UFDS that could serve as the ‘World’s Policeman’ without domestic blow back or consequences. Relations with the People’s Republic of China remained bitterly chilly over the accession of Taiwan to the Federation (it is believed that only the simultaneous British cession of Hong Kong prevented war) but the former countries of the Soviet Union proved fertile markets for Federal goods and corporations.\n\nClinton’s tenure as Prime Minister ended in June, 2000, with the collapse of his National Unity coalition after a dispute between the Liberal-Democratic Bloc and the Conservative Alliance over funding for social insurance and an attempt to standardize criminal justice laws. British politician Tony Blair replaced him, leading a sprawling Center-Center Left-Left coalition. Whatever his hopes or plans for his government had been, they were entirely upended a little over a year later, when the 9/11 terrorist attacks sent a permanent shock wave through the body politic of the UFDS.\n\nHegemony: 2001-2008\n\nMore than the physical damage, the true toll of September 11th was the blow to the UFDS’s naive self-confidence of the 1990s. Far too many citizens had become convinced of the Federation’s invulnerability, and the images of falling skyscrapers on TV made an impression that would never go away. The Clinton Government had seem itself as the rightful and inevitable inheritors of the world. The Blair Government increasingly saw its role as “spreading democracy” by whatever means necessary, and sought to do to this with the declaration of a ‘Global War on Terror’ and the launch of a series of military campaigns around the world designed to destroy the specter of ‘Radical Islamic Terrorism’.\n\nFor better and worse, this will probably always be remembered as the main legacy of Tony Blair’s time in office. Almost immediately, the Federal Defense Force responded with an invasion of Afghanistan, overthrowing the Taliban and beginning an Occupation that would last until 2013. A further series of air-strikes and small-scale interventions would occur across Northwest Africa and the Middle East; most notably the 2006 Invasion of Lebanon, the intervention in the Somali Civil War that continues until today, and the deployment of the Federal peace-keeping troops to South Sudan and Darfur in 2006 that continued until the Juba Peace Accords of 2011. Other theaters of operation included Pakistan, Mali, Libya, Yemen, and Syria, but the fighting reached its peek in the 2004-2005 Second Gulf War with Iran.\n\nThere continues to be considerable disputes over the cause of the war. The UFDS maintains that it took actions to prevent the Islamic Republic of Iran from developing ‘weapons of mass destruction’, the Iranian government continues to maintain that this was a pretext to justify attempted regime change. Clashes in the Persian Gulf in the summer of 2004 soon spiraled into a short but ugly exchange of airstrikes, naval actions, and missiles attacks that criss-crossed the Gulf and the Straits of Hormuz until a Swiss-brokered cease-fire in April 2005. Losses were heavy for both sides, but especially traumatic for the Federation, who were unused to taking heavy casualties. In particular, the loss of the UFS Chancellorsville and UFS Surcouf to Iranian fast-attack boats at the Battle of Bandar Abbas caused a brief media panic. Both Tehran and Brussels declared victory, but this proved to be the high-water mark of Federal military intervention.\n\nThe Global War on Terror was, and remains, controversial, especially in terms of how effective it actually was. It is noteworthy, however, as an indicator of the power and influence of the UFDS. No country before in history had been capable of fighting a war on multiple continents simultaneously without mobilization or notable effects on the civilian economy or population.\n\nFor all the differences in rhetoric and tone, in many ways the Blair Government continued to maintain most of the policies and goals of the Clinton Government. Sometimes called ‘New Liberalism‘, it worked to support free trade worldwide, streamline government services, and privatize many existing government-owned assets and industries, a set of priorities deeply controversial among the Social Democratic factions of Blair’s coalition. On the flip side, he also vastly increased government investment in green energy initiatives and other climate change programs and established a unified Federal Health Service. Blair saw the UFDS as the legitimate ‘Leader of the Free World’, and his government oversaw a vast expansion in membership, with fifteen new states joining between 2002 and 2007.\n\nTop-line economic growth numbers continued to be strong, but criticism built up over underlying trends, most notably spiraling inequality and the de-industrialization driven by globalization and free trade. Disputes also emerged between the individual member states over perceived inequalities, with claims from a number of smaller European states and many representatives of the United States that the Southeast Asian members were “taking advantage of them” to achieve economic dominance, a claim that South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan vigorously denied.\n\nAfter seven years, the Blair Government ended in October 2007, when Donald Tusk‘s Conservative Alliance was able to put together a coalition. The Conservatives return to power after nearly a decade in the wilderness would not last long however—less than a year later the global economy collapsed.\n\nCrisis & Consolidation: 2008-2020\n\nIn September 2008 a series of interlinked financial crises hammered both the United Federation of Democratic States and the world at large. Beginning with the collapse of the housing market in North America, ripples effects swept through the financial sector, causing a wave of bankruptcies, devaluations, and collapses. Caught almost totally by surprise after a decade of loose regulation, the Federal government struggled to respond initially. Three days after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers the Tusk Government fell.\n\nAn emergency National Unity coalition was established under the leadership of non-aligned representative Mario Monti, who established a technocratic cabinet of all parties to address the crisis. A series of bail-outs and other stabilization measures were able to prevent the entire global financial system from collapsing, but the world still entered a major economic recession for the next several years.\n\nMonti did not stand for reelection in 2010, and the Conservative Alliance, now led by German politician Angela Merkel was able to establish a minority government. Merkel would go on to lead the Federation for the following decade; the longest government in the UFDS’s history thus far. For voters exhausted by a decade of war and the collapse of the financial system, Merkel’s promises of stability and consensus were deeply appealing.\n\nThe Merkel Government enacted sweeping policies of austerity and fiscal control, as well as new and tighter financial regulations. This was successful in stabilizing the Federal budget and restoring confidence to shaky markets, but many critics criticized her for extending the impacts of the Great Recession by eschewing more direct economic aid and stimulus. The impact was especially severe in Greece, Italy, and the Balkans, where austerity lead to a series of rolling economic crises throughout 2010-2012, and prompted mass protests and the rise of populist political movements. Despite this, Merkel maintained popular, and her government was careful to avoid alienating any power bloc or faction too openly.\n\nIn terms of foreign policy, Merkel sough to follow a more cautious path than the Blair Government had. She oversaw a total withdrawal of Federal troops from Sudan by 2011 and Afghanistan by 2013, sought rapprochement with Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, and aimed to wind-down or at least drastically reduce the involvement of the UFDS in overseas military conflicts. In this, she was only partially successful. The outbreak of the Arab Spring in 2010 sent waves of unrest and chaos across the Middle East, and like many imperial hegemons before, the UFDS found it difficult to end an involvement once begun. The Federal Defense Force intervened in 2011 to support anti-Gaddafi forces during the Libyan Civil War, leading to a permanent military presence in Tripoli and Benghazi, and provided support to Free Syrian and Kurdish factions in the Syrian Civil War that erupted in 2011. Beyond the military sphere, Merkel sought to improve economic and political ties with Russia and China. Like many of her policies, it was widely popular at the time but has since faced criticism.\n\nIn domestic affairs, Merkel sought to pursue a path of consensus and compromise. Her two most notable accomplishments were the legalization of same-sex marriage in 2017 and her consistent support for liberal immigration laws despite fierce opposition; allowing large numbers of Central American and Syrian asylum-seekers to settle in the UFDS. This led to considerable backlash, even within the Conservative Alliance.\n\nBacklash became the watchword of the last years of the Merkel Government, as the front of stability began to crack. Protests over police brutality and ongoing racial discrimination in North America led to the emergence of the Black Lives Matter protest movement in 2014. In South Korea, the administration of President Park Geun-hye became embroiled in corruption scandals and mass protests until her impeachment and removal in 2016. Despite the Oslo Accords and the official end to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, outbreaks of violence in the West Bank have continued, and Jerusalem has shown little interest in maintaining the peace. In both Europe and America, right-wing populist and separatist movements gained considerable ground, including Fidesz in Hungary, the United Kingdom Independence Party in the UK, and America First in the USA, which gained a Congressional majority in 2016. Merkel’s own Conservative Alliance has consistently lost ground to more right-wing parties over the last five years.\n\nIn 2020 the Federation, along with the rest of the world, was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, and struggled to contain and respond to it. The economic and human costs have been severe, despite herculean quarantine efforts early on and the extraordinarily rapid development of several vaccines, and the response has helped fuel anti-government opposition across the board.\n\nThe Uncertain Future: 2020-2022\n\nIn 2020 Merkel announced that she would be stepping down after that year’s election. The ensuing results were inconclusive, with no natural coalition emerging with anything close to a majority. In the end, a unwieldy and rough compromise was worked out, with the Liberal-Democratic Bloc and Conservative Alliance forming a coalition together with the French centrist En Marche! party. En Marche! leader Emmanuel Macron became Prime Minister after brokering the agreement. The new government has been described as a desperation move by the political establishment as it loses ground to both the Left and the Right.\n\nSo far, the Macron Government has mainly had to contend with the lingering affects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine, widely seen as the most blatant challenge to Federal hegemony since 1997.\n\nMacron commands a large majority in both the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate, but it is so ideologically incoherent that decisive action is difficult. His own politics are hard to discern, as he attempts to steer the UFDS into an increasingly uncertain future. Where only a few decades before the leaders of the Federation looked forward and saw only inevitable triumph, few now are so blindly optimistic. The UFDS is threatened from within by increasingly radical politics, and from without by increasingly belligerent autocracies.\n\nThe future of global civilization will depend on if it is up to the challenges.\n\nMember States\n\nAs of June 2022, the United Federation of Democratic States consists of forty-four member states. Members of the UFDS accede to the Federation through ratification of the Articles of Federation by their respective governments and agreement by the Parliament and Government of the UFDS. Members must meet the Copenhagen Critera, a set of conditions laying out standards of democratic governance, rule of law, and economic freedom that must be met for a prospective member to be granted admittance. Since the original establishment of the Federation, a further nineteen states have joined. Members retain internal self-government and wide latitude in how they organize and administer themselves but cede sovereignty and the right of self-defense to the Federal government. Federal law supersedes state law in almost all categories. Member states have the right to secede from the United Federation, though none have yet taken this option. Officially, the UDFS maintains an ‘Open Door’ policy, in which any state is allowed to freely apply. In practice, admittance requires meeting strict conditions, and even countries that wish to join have increasingly met resistance. Between 1999 and 2004, fifteen states entered the UFDS. Since then, only four have been able to join.\n\nWhile many of the founders of the UFDS envisioned it as a proto-world government that would eventually encompass the world, it is believed that many current governments and politicians fear the dilution of their influence if more states accede to the Federation.\n\nCompacts of Free Association\n\nThere are currently four states that maintain a Compact of Free Association with the UFDS: Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Bosnia & Herzegovina. States in Free Association receive access to Federal economic aid and educational programs, access to the common market, and the right to residency, in return for military basing rights and Federal oversight of their foreign and economic policy. Palau, Micronesia, and the Marshall Islands were all in Free Association with the United States prior to the ratification of the Articles of Federation, and transferred their agreements to Brussels. Bosnia & Herzegovina signed their Compact in 2002. Outside observers have often described the Associated States as a form of ‘Protectorate‘.\n\nAffiliated States\n\nA state that has been approved as an official candidate for membership in the United Federation can sign a Treaty of Affiliation with the UFDS, which includes an Economic Integration Agreement and a Membership Action Plan. Currently Ukraine, Georgia, Albania, Macedonia, Andorra, Barbados, and South Africa have Affiliated status. Turkey signed a Treaty of Affiliation in 2001 but withdrew from the membership process in 2017.\n\nGovernment & Politics\n\nPresident\n\nThe Head of State of the United Federation of Democratic States is the President, who is directly-elected by a majority of voters in a two-round election. Presidents serve one six-year term and are not eligible for reelection. The President of the UFDS serves as a unifying figure for the Federation who can represent the country abroad and embody the will of the people, but their actual powers are quite limited. In theory, Presidential assent is required for legislation to become law, for new governments to form, and for Treaties to be ratified, but these powers may only be exercised by the President with the advice of the Prime Minister. In most respects, the President’s duties are purely ceremonial.\n\nPrime Minister\n\nThe Head of Government of the UFDS is the Prime Minister, who must command the confidence of a plurality of seats within the Chamber of Representatives. As Head of Government, the Prime Minister chooses the ministers of their cabinet, has the power to introduce legislation into Parliament, and is responsible for directing and coordinating the activities and agenda of the Government they lead. The Prime Minister is the key architect of policy both foreign and domestic, and has executive authority of the departments and ministries of government. In practice, they may well be constrained in their authority by the dynamics of their political coalition. The Prime Minister must be a sitting member of the Chamber of Representatives, and is usually the leader of the largest party. This is not a strict rule, however. Current Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron’s En Marche! party is substantially smaller than either of its coalition partners, but he received the post as a part of a compromise agreement between them.\n\nThe Prime Minister has the power to call general elections, these may be called at any time but one must be held at maximum every five years. The Prime Minister may be removed by a no confidence vote at any time, which often (though not always) triggers a general election.\n\nFederal Parliament\n\nParliament consists of two houses, the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate. The Chamber consists of 850 deputies, directly elected via a proportional representation system. Each member state of the UFDS is guaranteed at least one Representative, with more added for additional population. The Chamber of Representatives appoints the Prime Minister, and also controls the power of the purse. It has sole jurisdiction over most legislation, resolutions, or regulations.\n\nThe Senate consists of one hundred Senators. Each member state is guaranteed at least one Senator, with more added for additional population. Senators are not elected, but appointed by the governments of the states. They do not sit for fixed terms, but serve at their home governments’ pleasure. The Senate has sole right of approval for foreign treaties, constitutional amendments, and judicial appointments, and has a joint vote on applications for membership and measures “affecting the basic law of the United Federation.”\n\nFor a breakdown of the current 950 seats of Parliament by member state and party, please see:\n\nPolitical Parties\n\nAs of 2022, there United Federation of Democratic States has five recognized major political blocs. Because of the vast size of the Federation, and the massive cultural and economic differences between many of its constituent states, politics tend to be highly decentralized, with separate politics parties in each state forming permanent coalitions on the federal level. For example, the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom and the Christian Democratic Union in Germany are both members of the Conservative Alliance, but each maintain their own separate party apparatus, platform, and leadership on the national level. Because of this, even seemingly large majorities are even less uniform than they appear. Currently, the major factions are:\n\nConservative Alliance: The Conservative Alliance represents parties ranging from the Center to the Right of the political spectrum. The Conservative Alliance supports the existence of the United Federation and basic democratic governance, but tends to advocate for conservative social policies, fiscal austerity, a smaller and less powerful federal government, lower taxes, and a smaller welfare state. The CA is one of the historically dominant political blocs in the UFDS, and has been part of governing coalition except for Blair’s 2000-2007 government. More recently, the CA has been under pressure increasingly hard-right factions both within the Alliance and without that have strained relations between the different wings of the party. The Alliance’s current leader is Fumio Kishida.\n\nLiberal-Democratic Bloc: The Liberal-Democratic Bloc is the home for parties from the Center to the Center Left. It stands for traditional left/liberal values and goals; such as support for a strong welfare state, a willingness to intervene in the economy when necessary, Keynesian economics, social liberalism, more robust taxation and spending, immigration reform, and combating poverty and other social ills. The LDB is the UFDS’s other historically dominant political bloc; it has been part of every governing coalition except between 2007-2008 and between 2010-2020, and LDB Prime Ministers led the Federation for its first eleven years. Polarization along the lines of education and the rural/urban divide have left the LDB unable to compete to many areas, leading to accusations that the Bloc has ‘lost touch’ with its roots amidst a surge in support for the Far Right among traditional Liberal constituencies. The Bloc’s current leader is Justin Trudeau.\n\nSocial Democratic Labor Front: The Social Democratic Labor Front is an alliance of parties of the Center Left to the Far Left. It represents socialist, social democratic, and labor parties across a wide spectrum of ideological permutations, united in support of a pro-worker and pro-socialist agenda, including support for a strong welfare state, economic management for the good of the people, and the redistribution of wealth. In theory, the party platform also calls for nationalization of major industries and centralized economic planning, but actual support for that among member parties is far from unanimous. Despite usually managing strong showings in elections, the Front has generally been locked out of power, and has been seen as “out of step” with the neoliberal mainstream consensus. With the more recent populist backlash happening across the Federation, that may be changing. The SDLF’s current leader is Pedro Sánchez.\n\nLaw & Justice: Law & Justice is the newest major political bloc, emerging around 2010 as a challenger to the hegemony of the Conservative Alliance. It represents political parties from the Right to the Far Right. L&J has been described as “reactionary” or even “fascistic” by critics. It is strongly opposed to immigration or accommodations for ethnic or religious minorities and calls for the restoration and protection of “traditional” culture and society. The bloc is firmly opposed to social liberalism, has been accused of being anti-democratic by opponents, and has links to far-right organizations in several countries. Their rise has been a major challenge for the Conservative Alliance, and has prompted a split in the older, larger organization between politicians willing to work with L&J and those who shun them. The current leader of Law & Justice is Viktor Orbán.\n\nUnion of Nations: Cataloging where exactly the Union of Nations lies along the ideological spectrum can be difficult. The Union is an alliance of separatist, regionalist, and nationalist parties that support their state either seceding from the United Federation entirely or at least having a significant degree of Federal powers devolved back to the state level. In general, their politics tend to trend right-ward, but there are exceptions, and some of the member parties are essentially ideologically incoherent outside their area of focus. Due to its inherently anti-Federal posture, the Union has been locked firmly out of government since the beginning of the Federation. The Union’s current leader is Nigel Farage.\n\nThere are a number of smaller political parties that refuse membership in one of the recognized blocs and instead directly compete on their own. In some cases, such as the Italian Five Star Movement or the Taiwanese Kuomintang, this is because their ideology does not properly align with any of the mainstream factions. Others, like Donald Trump’s America First movement, simply have no interest in cooperation or collaboration. The most successful of these is the French En Marche! party. A centrist coalition with little to unite it but a charismatic founder, En Marche! appeared out of nowhere in 2017 to win control of the French government, and then secure the Federal Premiership for its founder. It is an open question how long this can last.\n\nCulture\n\nIt is an almost impossible task to describe “the culture” of the United Federation of Democratic States; a nation consisting of forty-four separate states spread out over every continent, with over a billion people speaking twenty-seven languages. The defining attribute of Federal culture is diversity; a multitude of peoples, societies, beliefs, and philosophies. That said, the dominant cultural ethos of the UFDS tends to be American-Western European derived, with increasing influence from Japan, as reflected in the four official state languages: English, French, German, and Japanese. There is also outsized cultural from the African-American community, especially in regards to popular music.\n\nThe United Federation is largely Christian in terms of religious background, but with sizable communities from every other major (and most minor) faiths. More than 90% of the world’s Jewish population lives within the United Federation. There is also a large and growing Muslim minority, which has led to tension in parts of Europe and North America. In recent years there has been a growing divide between Europe and North America in terms of religious belief; while American Christians remain largely observant and faithful, there has been a noticeable trend towards secularization across the Atlantic. An overwhelming majority of Japanese people still profess belief into Shintoism, though Christianity has had more of an impact in South Korea and Taiwan.\n\nProfessional sports are a major aspect of Federal culture and entertainment, with football being by far the most dominant. Other popular sports include basketball, ice hockey, baseball and American Football, which has been gaining ground in Europe and Australia since unification.\n\nIn general, the UFDS maintains a dominant position in terms of global cultural impact and influence. Hollywood, in Los Angeles, USA, remains the global capitol of film. The Japanese anime industry is hugely influential in the world of animation, and Europe is the source of premium foodstuffs around the world. Federal corporations and brands are present in almost every country, ensuring a ubiquitous presence.\n\nEconomy\n\nBy every metric, the United Federation of Democratic States is the largest and most powerful economy in the world. The UFDS has the largest GDP in the world, both nominal and PPP, nearly twice the size of its closest competitor, the People’s Republic of China. The UFDS is the world’s largest importer and exporter of goods, holds more than 50% of the total global wealth, and the Federal Dollar is generally regarded as the world’s reserve currency.\n\nThe states that formed the United Federation were already some of the world’s wealthiest and most-developed economies. Of the 38 OECD countries, all but four become members of the UFDS. The creation of a trans-continental Common Market and Free Movement Zone has helped stimulate these economies to greater heights, even in the face of increased competition from China and the developing countries of Africa and Latin America.\n\nOf the twenty busiest seaports in the world, all five that lies outside of China are within the UFDS (Rotterdam, Singapore, Port Hedland, Busan, and Gwangyang). Of the world’s 500 most profitable corporations, 330 have their headquarters in UFDS territory. Of the twenty-one top stock exchanges in the world, eleven are within the UFDS, with a joint market capitalization of $81 trillion. The UFDS’s economy has been called ‘post industrial’, with much of its value coming from finance, technology, and the service industry. The ‘Silicon Valley’ region of the San Francisco Bay Area remains the global hub of technological and digital development. Deindustrialization and outsourcing of factories to Latin America and East Asia has caused major economic impacts throughout much of Western Europe and Midwestern North America, with spiraling rates of poverty and joblessness afflicting former manufacturing centers. That said, major regional industries do remain, such as the Taiwanese semiconductor industry, which accounts for 20% of global production. The UFDS is agriculturally self-sufficient, and is a net exporter of foodstuffs to the rest of the world, especially corn, soy, and sorghum.\n\nDespite considerable domestic production of oil and natural gas, the UFDS remains a net importer of fossil fuels, mainly from the Middle East and Russia. Critics have long complained of the influence this casts on Federal foreign policy.\n\nLiving standards in the UFDS are generally quite high, though there is considerable regional disparity between Western Europe, parts of North America, Australia and East Asia on one hand and Eastern Europe, Latin America, the American South and Appalachia on the other. Despite this, income inequality is quite high and rising, and severe shortages of housing in major cities has been causing a growing crisis of affordability in some urban areas.\n\nThe economy of the UFDS has been described as a social market system; in which free-market capitalism is combined with extensive regulation and a welfare state but without any central planning or economic management. Since the Great Recession of 2008-2009 the skyrocketing wealth of the 1% and ongoing corporate consolidation has prompted concerns about a the possibility of a new era of monopolies and corporate capture of the government.\n\nForeign Affairs\n\nForeign Policy\n\nThe UFDS’s relationship to much of the rest of the world has been described as ‘hegemonic’ or ‘imperialist’. Due to the Federation’s overweening economic might, it exerts considerable influence throughout the Developing World, shaping economic and political policy in its favor. The Federation also maintains a considerable military presence overseas. Since the end of the Blair Administration the number of overt “humanitarian interventions” has declined, but the Federal Defense Forces maintains bases in at least twenty-one other countries, and is engaged in police actions and anti-terrorism campaigns across much of Africa and the Middle East. In theory, every Government of the UFDS has pledged to support self-determination and sovereignty of all other nations, but many critics have described these principles as a facade to cover a more imperialistic agenda.\n\nIn general, the UFDS has supported policies of international cooperation and free trade, with most Governments subscribing to a theory of “peace though economic integration”, which they have tried to codify through a network of regional trade deals and multilateral partnerships. This system has come under increasing pressure of late, with protectionist political parties such as America First condemning these policies as as a “giveaway” to foreigners, and many other countries seeing them as emblematic of First World imperialist hegemony.\n\nThe size and power of the UFDS has meant that a number of International Organizations have increasingly come to be seen and understood as simple outgrowths of the Federal government. This is true of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and other “economic development organizations”, which are headquartered out of UFDS territory, run mostly by Federal citizens, and whose economic policies in the Developing World have been criticized as supporting domination by Federal multinational corporations. Other International Organizations have found themselves sidelined or hollowed out, rendered irrelevant by the emergence of the hyperpower. The Commonwealth still exists, but mostly just as an international sports league. When the UFDS formed, it caused a crisis within the United Nations Security Council over how to deal with the UK, US, and France amalgamating. Though proposals were raised to elevate new countries to Permanent Status on the UNSC, the end result has simply been that the Security Council has not met since 1997. The United Nations still exists, and the General Assembly still meets, but its influence on international affairs has been minimal. Today it is mostly dominated by a club of nations from the developing world who use it as a forum for protesting against Federal hegemony.\n\nThere is no precedent for a nation with territory as widespread as the United Federation of Democratic States, which has led to a bewildering array of relationships. The UFDS has important bilateral treaty relationships with Vietnam, the Philippines, Turkey, Egypt, Colombia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine, Switzerland, Pakistan and the Gulf States. It has ongoing territorial disputes with Argentina over the Falklands, with North Korea over South Korea, with the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus over Cyprus, with Syria over the Golan Heights, and with the People’s Republic of China over Taiwan. It currently does not maintain diplomatic relations with Cuba, North Korea, or Iran.\n\nGlobal Responses\n\nMany of the founders of the United Federation of Democratic States hoped and believed that their union would be the nucleus for an eventual world state. At least so far, the Federation has served to drive many of its peer nations into deeper opposition to what they saw as a threat to their sovereignty and power. The People’s Republic of China has never forgiven the UFDS for the annexation of Taiwan, which they view as an integral part of Chinese territory, and though the two countries have a fair amount of economic cooperation these days, diplomatic relations remain bitterly antagonistic. During the 1990s and 2010s many saw Russia as more of a success story, a trading partner and emerging democracy that could ally with and perhaps even eventually join the UFDS. But since General-Secretary Vladimir Putin has secured control over the Russian Republic, relations have gone downhill as he attempts to reassert Russian power in Eastern Europe and the Caucuses. With the UFDS now providing open military support to Ukraine in its resistance to Russian invasion, relations are at an all-time low. India, a democratic country and a longstanding American ally, has been less hostile, but even there, relations between New Delhi and Brussels have noticeably cooled as India seeks to avoid becoming a Federal client state.\n\nSince 1997, there have a number of proposed alternatives to the UFDS by other regional powers or alliances, hoping to establish supranational unions of their own that could challenge the Federation for hegemony. The most ambitious of these would be the Eurasian Union, proposed by Putin in 2005. An amalgamation of Russia, China, India, and most of their allies and client states, the Eurasian Union would have double the UFDS’s population and be a formidable rival. Unfortunately for Putin’s dreams, the proposal has never gotten past the occasional summit meeting. The countries involved simply have too many differences to make it practical.\n\nIn South America, offers of membership in the UFDS were initially made to Argentina and Chile. Instead, those governments have spent the last twenty years deeply involved in the quest to establish a United States of South America. A major breakthrough was achieved in 2009, when seven Latin American countries signed the La Paz Declaration, committing themselves in principle to forming a federal government. There has been little action taken since then, however.\n\nThe African Union came into existence in 1999, as an organization representing the interests of (most) African states. As it exists now, it is simply a coordinating and voluntary cooperation organization, with no sovereignty vested in the Union itself. Since 2014, a total of twenty-one members have signed on to the Kinshasa Protocol; which calls for the Union to be converted to a federal government by 2030, but talks within the African Union Commission to achieve this have been desultory at best."
