This commitment includes further engaging in policy dialogue and setting up a high-level political forum to monitor the implementation of the steps outlined in the recommendation and report on further progress on the ground.\n\nFollowing the High-Level Political Forum, at 17:30 CEST, the Commissioner and the Chairwoman of the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina will give press statements, which will be covered by EbS. Photo and video material of the visit will also be available on EbS."
