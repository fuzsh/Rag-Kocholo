Her political motivation stems from growing up in a war-torn society and her ambition to facilitate positive change and a better environment in her homeland. Although initially challenged by the complexities of governance and economy, Vujovic is deeply committed to creating people-oriented budgets and being an empowering voice for her constituents, especially young women. She emphasizes collaboration across party lines and leveraging media presence for effective public policy advancement, never compromising on her ideals and mission for the nation’s betterment.\n\nVedrana Vujovic serves as a Member of Parliament of Bosnia and Herzegovina after being elected in 2022. She dedicated her time in civil service to advancing youth and women’s movements and working to expand pro-democracy networks within her country. Vedrana continued her fight for democracy by becoming the youngest person elected to the Democratic Front Party’s Main Board. In her new capacity, Vedrana can make change and strengthen democracy from within the institutions that maintain it."
