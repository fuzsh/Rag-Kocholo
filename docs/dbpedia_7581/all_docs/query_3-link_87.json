        "text": "On Sunday, Oct. 2, voters in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) will have the opportunity to decide the presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the BiH Parliamentary Assembly (national level); the House of Representatives of the Federation of BiH Parliament and the National Assembly of the Republika Srpska (entity levels); the president and vice presidents of the Republika Srpska; and 10 cantonal assemblies in the Federation of BiH. In total, 518 positions are open across the state, entity and cantonal levels, with 7,258 total registered candidates.\n\nPreparations for the elections are taking place amid deep political and social polarization, along with controversy surrounding a series of recent High Representative decisions, which drew protests and backlash. A revised amendment came in late July, two months after the CEC announced that general elections would take place Oct. 2. Amended provisions strengthen electoral legislation — specifically, to limit the abuse of state resources in elections; provide clarity regarding the regulation of electronic, online, social and print media and the use of hate speech in elections; strengthen the CEC’s sanctioning mechanism; and expand the CEC’s mandate to address vulnerabilities related to poll worker nomination processes.\n\nTo help you understand this important electoral process, the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) provides Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on Elections in Bosnia & Herzegovina: 2022 General Elections. IFES FAQs include:\n\nWhy are these elections important?\n\nWhat is the electoral system?\n\nWhat provisions are in place that support the equal rights of women, persons with disabilities and other marginalized groups?\n\nHow will election disputes be adjudicated?\n\nLearn more about IFES' programs in Bosnia and Herzegovina and follow @IFES_Europe on Twitter.\n\nAdditionally, visit IFES' Election Guide for the most comprehensive and timely verified election information available online.\n\nPublished September 27, 2022."
