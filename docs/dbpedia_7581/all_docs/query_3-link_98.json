        "text": "For over 30 years, the British Westminster Foundation for Demo­cracy (WFD) has been dedicated to promoting democratic values in numerous countries. This includes the Western Balkans region, where, among other things, it created HUGEN, a network that serves as a plat­form for informal exchange for the human rights and equality Committees of eight Parliaments in the six Western Balkan countries. In the framework of a cooperation initiated in 2021 between the Austrian Parliament and the WFD, two inter­parliamentary meetings took place - virtually, due to COVID - for the first time in 2022. At the first exchange, general human rights issues that are currently particularly relevant from the perspective of Austria or the Western Balkan countries were discussed. The second Committee meeting was dedicated to the topics of \"human trafficking\" and \"violence against women.\" Further cooperation of the Austrian Parliament with the WFD is anticipated.\n\nIn cooperation with the French National Assembly, the Austrian Parliament completed a European Commission TAIEX project with the Parliament of North Macedonia in December 2021.\n\nThe two‑day seminar on \"EU Accession, Revised Methodology and the Funda­mentals: What Changes for the Parliament of the Republic of North Macedonia\" was held with the participation of, among others, MP Lopatka in his capacity as Chair of the EU Subcommittee. Together with the Vice‑Chair of the EU Committee of the Assemblée Nationale, Liliane Tanguy, the tasks of the respective EU committees of both Parliaments as well as the experiences in the course of the EU accession process and the role of the Parliament were presented. The aim was to focus explicitly on the necessities of the Macedonian Parliament and its crucial role in the EU accession process, and to raise awareness both at the political and administrative levels.\n\nMore information about TAIEX (europa.eu)\n\nThe Twinning project \"Empowerment and further support to the Parliaments of Bosnia and Herzegovina in EU integration tasks\" was implemented in 2019-2021. Tendered by the European Commission, this initiative was conducted by a consortium of the Hungarian Parliament as Project Leader and the Austrian and Croatian Parliaments each as Junior Member State Partner.\n\nThe participation of Austria under­lined the commitment of the Austrian Parliament in the region of the Western Balkans. The Hungarian Parliament, which has been active in numerous Twinning projects for many years, aimed to have Austria on board because of its commitment to the Western Balkans, its long‑standing EU member­ship, and its good bilateral relations. In addition, Austria was invited due to its having a bicameral Parliament main­taining close coordination with the provincial parliaments in the EU area through the Federal Council. Three Provincial Parliaments (Vienna, Lower Austria, Styria) also participated in activities such as a study visit of a delegation to Austria. Croatia was selected as a Junior Member State by Hungary, because it can share very concrete experience and support in the pre‑accession process to the EU due to its accession just a few years ago.\n\nThe aim was to strengthen the parliamentary structures in Bosnia and Herzegovina by sending experts from various fields such as EU participation, ICT, electronic legislative process, budget, communications, and human‑resources development.\n\nProject Content\n\nBased on the Stabilization and Association Agreement (in force since 1.6.2015) and the European Commission Country Report 2018, the third project was aimed at strengthening the four parliamentary administrations (the 10 cantonal Parliaments of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina were also included in individual areas), especially in the field of EU integration. The following four topics were addressed:\n\nexpansion of the competencies of the EU organizational units in the parliaments\n\ndeepening the cooperation of parliaments in EU affairs\n\nimprovement of the competencies of the administrative structures in the legislative process related to the pre-accession to the EUdevelopment of competencies of cantonal assemblies\n\nThe Parliaments of the Czech Republic, Belgium (both Chambers and the Flemish Parliament), France (National Assembly), Portugal and Slovakia also participated in the project with experts.\n\nIn the course of the project, concrete implementation plans were developed at the administrative level; in addition, priorities were set at the political level and forums for regular exchange and cooperation were established. Furthermore, the project accompanied the ongoing work process (committee support, preparation of meetings, staff recruitment, conference preparations).\n\nMore information about Twinning:\n\nWebsite of the European Commission and the BMEIA\n\nTwinning Project - EU support to the Parliaments of BiH in EU integration tasks"
