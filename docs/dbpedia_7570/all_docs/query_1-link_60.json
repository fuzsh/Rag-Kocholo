She may have become known for her no-holds-barred exploration of taboo subjects, but an incisive and brave performer lives underneath all that controversy. She rose through the stand-up ranks in the 00s, and created her own eponymous Comedy Central show, The Sarah Silverman Program. Be warned though - no subject is taboo for this leading comedian!\n\nNo stranger to the stage or screen, she's also appeared on Saturday Night Live and in numerous films such as School of Rock, A Million Ways To Die In The West and Wreck-It Ralph, as well as the recent I Smile Back, which was a showcase for her considerable dramatic range."
