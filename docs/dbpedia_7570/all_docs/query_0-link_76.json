        "text": "The following was first published by the Jewish Women’s Archive, by Sascha Cohen\n\nSilverman was born to a middle-class Jewish family of Russian and Polish ancestry. The youngest of four daughters, she was raised in the mostly Catholic town of Manchester, New Hampshire, and attended the Derryfield School. “We grew up in a place with very few Jews. I didn’t look like the other kids. I had hairy legs, hairy arms, hair everywhere. I looked like a little monkey,” she explained in an interview.\n\nSilverman’s mother, Beth Ann, was a photographer and the founder of a theater company, where she produced and directed plays. Her father, Donald, sold discount clothing and furniture. Donald and Beth divorced when Silverman was six years old.\n\nSilverman’s older sisters include Susan, a feminist Reform rabbi now living in Jerusalem, Laura, an actor, and Jodyne, a screenwriter.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2010, Silverman produced The Sarah Silverman Program, an offbeat single-camera sitcom in which she played a more arrogant and oblivious version of herself, or as the Village Voice put it, “an indulgent, whiny rapscallion…the uber-bitch of our darkest dreams” (Musto). The series ran for three seasons. Silverman was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress, and the show was nominated for a GLAAD Media Award for its portrayal of gay and lesbian characters.\n\nSilverman identifies as ethnically and culturally Jewish, but her upbringing was secular, and she is not religious and does not believe in God. She has been vocally supportive of the LGBTQ community and open about her use of both marijuana and anti-depressant medication, the latter of which keeps her from experiencing “that complete downward spiral into despair about nothing.”"
