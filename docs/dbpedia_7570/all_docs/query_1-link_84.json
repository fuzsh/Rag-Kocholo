        "text": "Save This Article! Share it with Others!\n\nTake a look at Emily Zemler’s article in Esquire on Louis C.K., Sarah Silverman, Amy Schumer and others on how and what they did before they became famous.\n\nI always love reading about this stuff!\n\nMost of us get acquainted with notable comedians only after they hit it big. The challenge and the mystery of their success can be so ominous and make us feel like we could never do it.\n\nEarly in our careers, every show seems so crucial. In the article Louis C.K. talks about his first time on stage and how he couldn’t fill five minutes and then didn’t do stand up for another two years!\n\nHe also talks about other failures.\n\nThis should instill in all of us how important the journey is. That not every or ANY show is a “do-or-die” moment, that mistakes can happen and they can be BIG. I mean how many of us even knew that C.K. made a movie, let alone a couple?\n\nThere Are No SINGLE Opportunities\n\nEvery career has its ups and downs. Some of us put so much faith in that ONE opportunity we had and blew.\n\nThere are no ‘single’ opportunities.\n\nThere is the journey of ups and downs. Some ‘downs’ feel catastrophic when they happen, but none except death can keep you down forever.\n\nIf I were you; which I’m notâ€”Thank Godâ€”because I’ve seen the way you dress and that deep v-neck shirt does not look good on meâ€”but if I were you, I would link that article, screenshot it, save it and use it for a reference each time you feel that you’ve failed or that your career is going nowhere.\n\nRead the article, understand that the great ones failed too. Then get out, get up and do your funny.\n\nAnd if they don’t laugh, rewrite, get up and do your funny again!\n\nGreat article Emily Zemler! Thanks for instilling hope in all comedians who are pounding it out."
