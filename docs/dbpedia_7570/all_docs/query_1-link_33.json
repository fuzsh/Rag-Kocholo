Make that the funny, thin, pretty, edgy genius of Sarah Silverman, who incidentally has marvelous thighs.

        "text": "What Silverman does (and this is what makes her \"edgy,\" as she jokes) is not to simply turn \"PC\" on its head, but to take your head and twist it 360 degrees (rather than the comedy-standard 180), so that you're back where you started but can see how you got there -- as in the bit cited above in which she corrects her niece on the number of Hitler's Jewish victims. I suppose this sort of unblinking satire of over-privileged ersatz morality and cluelessness can be called \"irony,\" but if so it's double-reverse backflip super-stealth irony.\n\nOther times the approach is a little more straightforward, as in her song that mixes simplistic romantic and racist clich√©s with an irresistibly bubble-gummy pop tune:\n\nI love you more than bees love honey\n\nI love you more than Jews love money\n\nI love you more than Asians are good at math\n\nI love you even if it's not hip,\n\nI love you more than black people don't tip...\n\nAfter the world premiere screening of \"Sarah Silverman: Jesus is Magic\" at the Toronto Film Festival in September, a fan in the audience hailed her as \"the true heir to Lenny Bruce.\"\n\n\"Wow, thank you, that is the ultimate compliment,\" she said. \"I'm actually not that familiar with Lenny Bruce's work, but from what I understand, he was a really great singer.\""
