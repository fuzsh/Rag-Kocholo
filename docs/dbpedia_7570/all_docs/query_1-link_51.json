        "text": "Sarah Silverman ticks a lot of boxes for me: she's subversive, consistently inventive, politically right-on and sexy. I'm not normally a big fan of the taboo-busting comedy that's her stock-in-trade (for me, it too often ends up being queasily taboo-confirming), but since her turn in The Aristocrats, where she spun a crafty tale mixing up child rape and the American light entertainment industry, I've been one of Silverman's increasingly numerous British fans.\n\nIncreasingly numerous until her UK debut at the Hammersmith Apollo, that is – when she, or perhaps her promoters, did everything possible to shake as many of us off as they could. Demand for tickets was high – the presence of so many comedy A-listers inside, from The Mighty Boosh to Chris Morris, showed that this was one of the most eagerly-anticipated events of the year. Eagerly anticipated by promoters Live Nation, too, who were able to sell the 3,500 tickets at prices (once booking fees were taken into account) close to a cool £50.\n\nSo, what kind of an evening's entertainment does that get you? It began with a wait of over an hour due to a \"technical fault\". We got into the venue at 8pm and half an hour later, the show started. Kind of. Matt Berry and Rich Fulcher from BBC3's Snuffbox came on and engaged in three minutes of forced banter with the audience. Then they introduced the proper support act, Steve Agee. Who wasn't there.\n\nIt's not Agee's fault he was ill, but who decided not to bother booking a replacement? We got a blink-and-you'll miss-it video message from Agee, a trailer for Silverman's new TV series, and then the headline act herself. All 40 minutes of her. Factor in an encore consisting of five minutes of Q&A, hastily improvised after it became clear that the slow-handclapping crowd weren't going to leave otherwise, and the evening ended with Silverman telling the audience to go home at 9.25pm. Ken Dodd it isn't.\n\nAs responses to Steve Coogan's tour have made clear, comedy fans want value for money. After all, £50 isn't too far off the price you'd expect to pay for a top-level band at somewhere like the O2. And if you turned up at a rock gig to be rewarded with barely an hour's entertainment, you'd expect to see bottles hitting the stage. The Apollo audience were relatively restrained.\n\nOf course, the negative reaction may not matter too much to Silverman herself – with her movie career and US sitcom, she's under no obligation to play in the UK any time soon. But her British peers in the audience must have been wondering how many people were being turned off live comedy by this exercise in larceny."
