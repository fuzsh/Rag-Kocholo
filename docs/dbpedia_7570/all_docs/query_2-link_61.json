        "text": "North Carolina: The Sarah Silverman Tour Is Coming, What To Know\n\nThis fall, there are two North Carolina Sarah Silverman tour dates you need to know about. The comedian has just announced her the Sarah Silverman: Postmortem tour.\n\nNot many states have multiple dates booked on this extensive run of shows. Although we do, the bad news is that we have to wait until November for them to take place.\n\n“Looking forward to hitting the road and connecting with human beings in a live setting,” Silverman said in an official press release.\n\nIn total, Silverman will hit the road for the better part of four months. The gigs kick off on September 19 in St. Louis and then will navigate through every other region of the country.\n\n“The two-time Emmy winner has been a staple in the comedy world for over two decades, with a reputation for tackling subject matters with her unique and provocative perspective.,” her official press release explains.\n\nEach show will follow a strict no cellphone or camera policy, and guests are directed to secure their devices, including smart watches, in a Yondr pouch. Although ticketholders are allowed to maintain possession, they can only utilize the phones in a designated area of each venue.\n\nHere Are The North Carolina Sarah Silverman Tour Dates\n\nAfter starting off November in the northern region of the country, Silverman will dart south for the weekend before heading out west again.\n\nFriday, November 8 in Durham at DPAC\n\nSaturday, November 9 in Charlotte at Ovens Auditorium\n\nThe general public on-sale for tickets will be Friday June 14 at 10AM.\n\nIn addition to prepping for a new tour, Silverman has been recognized a lot recently. “Her most recent special Sarah Silverman: Someone You Love was nominated for a Grammy, Golden Globe and Critics Choice Award.\n\nSilverman also “continues to host her critically acclaimed, weekly podcast, The Sarah Silverman Podcast, which relaunched on October 19 through Lemonada on all platforms and TBS’ Stupid Pet Tricks, an expansion of the famous David Letterman late-night segment,” her press release explains.\n\nSilverman’s last film work was a supporting role in the 2023 romantic drama Maestro starring Bradley Copper, and a supporting role in the 2022’s Marry Me, alongside Jennifer Lopez and Owen Wilson..\n\nIn anticipation of catching Silverman’s stand-up show later this year, you can find clips of her podcast in addition to throwback moments such as Silverman’s best bits on Saturday Night Live via her Instagram.\n\nJeff Gorra is a Boston-based writer who has been with Beasley Media Group since the beginning of 2023. He writes about restaurants and food, as well as sports and rock music. His experience also includes show hosting and in-depth creative writing in rock and reggae dub music. Jeff’s an avid surfer, New York Giants, and Pearl Jam fan, however, if you make unforgettable pizza, he is sure to find you."
