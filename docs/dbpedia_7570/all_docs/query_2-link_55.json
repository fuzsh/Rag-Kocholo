If we know anything about the two-time Emmy Award-winning comedian, actress, writer, and producer, we know she will blow the incredibly ornate roof of the place with a provocative and effortlessly clever set.\n\nSarah Silverman: Postmortem follows the comedian’s last HBO special Sarah Silverman: Someone You Love which was nominated for a Grammy, Golden Globe, and Critics Choice Award. Beyond stand-up, Silverman also hosts the critically acclaimed The Sarah Silverman Podcast as well as an expansion of the David Letterman late night segment, Stupid Pet Tricks, on TBS."
