        "text": "The 11-day Hell Yes Fest will close out with quite the bang on Sunday when comedy titan Sarah Silverman takes the stage at the Saenger Theatre. Over 20 years after she first broke into the mainstream on Saturday Night Live, Silverman has held down roles in movies like School of Rock, Wreck-It Ralph and A Million Ways to Die in the West. She’s also scored a recurring role on HBO’s Masters of Sex and wrote, produced and starred in her own show, The Sarah Silverman Program, which ran on Comedy Central from 2007 to 2010.\n\nThe past two decades have also seen Silverman perfect her brand of sarcastic and controversial stand-up comedy, making her a perfect fit to close out the Hell Yes Fest. Recent years have also seen her become increasingly vocal about her politics. It’s a side of her that was taken to the next level back in August when she was invited to speak at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, which must have been a far cry from the stages she usually graces (fellow comedian-in-politics Al Franken was hanging out behind her while she spoke).\n\nWe caught up with Silverman via email ahead of her upcoming set at the Saenger. Here’s what she had to say.\n\nYou’ll be headlining the Hell Yes Comedy Festival in New Orleans. Have you spent much time here? Do you have any good stories?\n\nA friend took me to Jazz Fest in the early 90s and I went back by myself the following next two years. I loved it so much. Joni Mitchell on one stage, Buddy Guy on another… it was heaven.\n\nWhen you do stand-up, do you cater any jokes to the location or stick with the same set?\n\nWell I’m always in the process of figuring out stuff and honing and the audience and the place is everything. I don’t usually do the tricks of finding out the local buzz words blah blah blah but I try to be in the moment. I’m talking to the people I’m looking at, you know, so even with material it’s always a different conversation.\n\nA lot of people are familiar with your work in TV and movies. Are there any similarities between your stand-up persona and, for instance, your character on The Sarah Silverman Program?\n\nSure. Probably less so than ever. That character was based on who I was onstage at that time- an arrogant ignorant kind of asshole named me. I love that combination in comedy and drama. It’s, to me, interesting both to play and to watch. The real life version is actually our republican nominee, and that’s far less funny. My stand up now is more of a reflection of who I am now. It was a slow gradual change for me because I’m me but I suppose if you haven’t seen me since 2007 I may be slightly more sincere and less of the character who says the opposite of what I mean.\n\nYou’ve been pretty vocal about the upcoming election from the beginning, first as supporter of Bernie Sanders, then as a supporter of Hillary Clinton, and always as an opposer of Donald Trump. Do you have any thoughts on why this election has been so ridiculous?\n\nIt’s an honest and ugly reflection of our country and unless we look in that mirror and realize we’ve hit bottom we’re doomed. Money and greed at any cost and by any means is looked at as “success” and has taken the place of empathy, acceptance, kindness and gratitude. But I still think there’s goodness in people.\n\nComedy has gotten pretty diffuse in recent years with the proliferation podcasts, web series and other mediums beyond traditional TV, movies and stand-up. Is there any particular medium that you prefer? Is stand-up where you are most comfortable?\n\nI love stand up obviously, but I love the other mediums too. You gotta embrace that shit. Twitter really serves me in ways stand up can’t. It’s like a message in a bottle for me. Can also be a place to try jokes. And I love making videos too. Movies are fun though more fun when they’re done. Movies take a whole new level of patience for me. You have to get real zen to survive it and that’s been good a good lesson for me.\n\nDo you plan on sticking around New Orleans for a little bit after your performance? Is there anything in particular that you look forward to doing while you’re here?\n\nI love the music and the vibe but I don’t drink and I’ve never even tried seafood DONT JUDGE ME. I love to hit New Orleans streets in that in between time when the sun is dropping. Heaven."
