        "text": "Thirteen minutes into Sarah Silverman's set at PrideFest, it started to rain.\n\n'This is not going to help with my abandonment issues,' the comedian joked to the scattering crowd.\n\nHuddled under the awnings of nearby vendors, many in the distracted audience began to loudly debate leaving. Meanwhile Silverman, housed by the stage, soldiered on with a story about a drunken evening for one of her sisters.\n\nThose hiding from the rain re-emerged just in time to catch Silverman saying that the lingering laughter from the joke was 'relief laughter' that her sister hadn't been raped. Needless to say, without the full story, it was a bit uncomfortable.\n\nAnd so the tone was set for the evening. Four experienced comedians with massive bravado had to compete with the weather, a nearby dance party and an inattentive audience to land punch lines — some of which still felt like misses. Yet those who remained through non-ideal circumstances were treated to a worthwhile show.\n\nSilverman took to the stage first, hoping to warm it up for her accompanying friends, comedians Dwayne Kennedy, Lizz Winstead and Todd Glass. Sound problems were present from the beginning. Music from the Dance Pavilion at the Johnson Controls Stage rang throughout, and Silverman — who was sucking on a Ricola at one point — struggled to deliver her trademark deadpan comments in the less intimate outdoor setting.\n\nBut when she did, they came in full force.\n\n'You can do whatever you want to me,' she said. 'I will never sue you. I don't want to be a litigious Jew.'\n\nKennedy followed Silverman's opening set, but his commentary on race didn't seem to register with the predominantly white audience. Silverman would later joke that the three black audience members in the front row couldn't leave; turns out they were just getting drinks.\n\n'Milwaukee: This is where everybody in Chicago comes when they want to have fun and not die,' the African-American Kennedy said to the loudest cheers of his set. 'That's on the brochure.'\n\nFollowing Kennedy was Winstead, co-creator of Comedy Central's 'The Daily Show' and an abortion rights advocate. Winstead delivered the most political set of the night.\n\n'We do not need government regulating our bodies. We have Activia for that,' Winstead joked.\n\nBy the time Glass took the stage, the sound issues had evened out. Glass talked about how he was comfortable coming out in later in life, but he's not a fan of the language used to describe it. 'Can't it be, 'Hey, he bused out of the (expletive) shed?''\n\nFinally, Silverman — who made brief appearances between her friends' time on the mic — returned to close things out. It was her time on stage that the audience reacted to most, a testament to the comedian's star power. A 'Game of Thrones' fan, Silverman was astounded by the lack of neck protection armor provides in the show given the tendency for characters to be beheaded or have their throats slit.\n\nWith her voice unchanged, Silverman said, 'I am Lewis Black mad about this.' It was her most precise deadpan of the evening.\n\nFor the audience who made it through the weather and sound issues, it was the exact kind of joke they had come for."
