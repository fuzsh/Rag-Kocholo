        "text": "Sarah Silverman is returning to HBO.\n\nA year after the premium cable network passed on People in New Jersey, HBO has picked up an untitled comedy starring the comedian-actress, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.\n\nThe untitled comedy is described as a comedic look at a pathologically honest woman (Silverman) having a modern midlife crisis.\n\nSilverman will star and executive produce the comedy. Secret Diary of a Call Girl‘s Lucy Prebble will pen the script and exec produce alongside Silverman, Ash Atalla (Trollied, Cuckoo) Silverman’s manager Amy Zvi and Dan Hine (Cuckoo).\n\nSee more 40 Years of HBO\n\nThe new Silverman vehicle brings the actress back into the HBO fold following People in New Jersey, the comedy pilot from SNL’s Lorne Michaels and Bruce Eric Kaplan (Girls) that did not move forward. That comedy centered on life today as told through the prism of an adult brother (Topher Grace) and sister (Silverman) living in New Jersey.\n\nShould HBO’s new Silverman vehicle go to series, it would mark her first small-screen series role since Comedy Central’s The Sarah Silverman Program.\n\nRepped by CAA, Thruline and Ziffren Brittenham, Silverman’s credits include a recurring role on Showtime’s Masters of Sex, Bob’s Burgers and Wreck-It Ralph. She recently picked up an outstanding writing in a variety special Emmy for her HBO comedy special Sarah Silverman: We Are Miracles, which was also nominated for best variety special. We Are Miracles recently earned a Grammy nomination for best comedy album. She’ll next be seen in the Sundance drama I Smile Back.\n\nFor HBO, the Silverman vehicle marks its second comedy pilot in the works, joining its untitled newspaper entry from Diallo Riddle and Bashir Salahuddin (which is being redeveloped). On the drama side, the cabler still has Laughs Unlimited in the works.\n\nThe pilot order comes as HBO is preparing its next batch of offerings after picking up comedies Togetherness, The Brink and Ballers to series in addition to reviving The Comeback."
