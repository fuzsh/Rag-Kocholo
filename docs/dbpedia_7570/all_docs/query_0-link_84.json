        "text": "Community Auditions Was The Best\n\nIf you grew up in New England in the '70s and '80s, especially Massachusetts and Southern New Hampshire, chances are you watched Community Auditions on Sunday mornings at 11am with its beloved host, Dave Maynard. Dave was hilarious, may he rest in peace. If you watch the full show below, you will see that Dave is just doing a radio show, but he's doing it in front of the camera.\n\nThis Boston Show Was American Idol Before American Idol\n\nThe show ran from 1950-1987, according to the IMDB. From what I remember, if you were a theater kid or some variation in the chorus or marching band, you wanted to be on Community Auditions.\n\nThere were mostly kids who auditioned, but anyone was welcome. Kind of like American Idol, The Voice and America's Got Talent all rolled up into one!\n\nBoston could have been the birthplace of reality TV (I know, say it isn't so!).\n\nSarah Silverman Won First Place\n\nSarah Silverman, a Bedford, New Hampshire, native, was on the show sometime in the '80s and won first place.\n\nI can imagine that she didn't think she would reach the level of fame that she has. Otherwise, she may have asked to keep the original tape from WBZ-TV.\n\nThe audition became nationally known when in 2009, her friend, Jimmy Kimmel, put it on his late-night talk show, much to her dismay.\n\nIf you don't remember this absolute GEM of a TV show, lucky for us, there's YouTube.\n\nSing it with me:\n\nStar of the day, who will it be?\n\nYour vote may hold the key, it's up to you.\n\nTell us who, will be Star of the Day.\n\nEveryone knew that theme song. This video is hilarious, so enjoy.\n\nDave Maynard passed away in February of 2012, and WBZ honored him:\n\nNew England should bring this show back. They tried to do it once in the early 2000s, but it lost Dave's magic. Were you ever on the show? Would you want it to come back?"
