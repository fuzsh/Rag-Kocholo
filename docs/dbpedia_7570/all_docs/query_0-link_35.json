        "text": "Jerry Seinfeld, Kevin Hart, Sarah Silverman and Bill Burr will perform at the first “Comedy Central Presents Colossal Clusterfest,” a new comedy and music festival taking place June 2nd through 4th in San Francisco.\n\nComedy Central organized the three-day event with Bonnaroo organizers Superfly and Outside Lands co-producers Another Planet. The Clusterfest will feature stand-up, sketch comedy, podcast recordings, music performances and interactive attractions across five stages at the San Francisco Civic Center Plaza and Bill Graham Civic Auditorium. Tickets go on sale March 2nd at 10 a.m. PT via the festival’s website.\n\nAlongside the headliners, the lineup boasts Hannibal Buress, Broad City‘s Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer, Bob Odenkirk, Chris Hardwick, Fred Armisen, Tig Notaro and Anthony Jeselnik. Among the musicians set to appear are Ice Cube, Tegan and Sara, Vince Staples, Chromeo, Jidenna, Ty Segall and even a Bonnaroo-style Superjam with Les Claypool’s Bastard Jazz. The Clusterfest also promises special collaborations between musicians and comedians, as well as acts at the intersection of the two, including Reggie Watts and Princess, the Prince cover band fronted by Maya Rudolph and Gretchen Lieberum.\n\nBroad City‘s Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer will also stage a live reading of Wayne’s World for the film’s 25th anniversary at the festival.\n\nThe interactive attractions, meanwhile, will offer fans a chance to immerse themselves in the worlds of South Park, Seinfeld and It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia. For instance, the South Park exhibit will feature special food and drinks tied to the show – including a tribute to Cartman’s notorious Chili con Carnival – while the Seinfeld attraction will boast a full-scale recreation of Jerry’s apartment, food from Monk’s Cafe and a Festivus celebration.\n\nTrending\n\nFor those unable to attend the Clusterfest, Chris Hardwick will host a live 90-minute special on Comedy Central June 4th. The show will feature interviews, on-the-ground reports from various comedians, behind-the-scenes segments and highlights from throughout the weekend.\n\nThe Clusterfest also unveiled a frenetic festival trailer teasing the lineup as a life-changing experience. As one narrator put it, “It’s like glitterbombs that will live inside every one of your orifices for weeks.”"
