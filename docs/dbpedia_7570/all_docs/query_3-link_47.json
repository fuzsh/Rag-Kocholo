        "text": "Tampa: Sarah Silverman Is Coming To Town With 2 Shows On The Same Day\n\nThis fall, there are two Tampa Sarah Silverman shows you need to know about, and they are both on the same day. The comedian has just announced her the Sarah Silverman: Postmortem tour.\n\nNot many states have multiple dates booked on this extensive run of shows. Although we do, we have to wait until early next year for them to take place.\n\n“Looking forward to hitting the road and connecting with human beings in a live setting,” Silverman said in an official press release.\n\nIn total, Silverman will hit the road for the better part of four months. The gigs kick off on September 19 in St. Louis and then will navigate through the country.\n\n“The two-time Emmy winner has been a staple in the comedy world for over two decades, with a reputation for tackling subject matters with her unique and provocative perspective.,” her official press release explains.\n\nEach show will follow a strict no cellphone or camera policy, and guests are directed to secure their devices, including smart watches, in a Yondr pouch. Although ticketholders can maintain possession, they can only utilize the phones in a designated area of each venue.\n\nHere Are The Tampa Sarah Silverman Tour Dates\n\nSilverman will start her 2025 off on the road with her second week being in sunny Florida. Here are the dates.\n\nTampa – Thursday, January 9 at Hard Rock Event Center at Seminole Hard Rock. There will be two shows on this date. The first one will start at 6:30PM and the second show is at 9:30PM.\n\nOrlando – Friday, January 10 at Hard Rock Live Orlando.\n\nMiami – Saturday, January 11 at The Fillmore Miami Beach at Jackie Gleason Theater.\n\nIn addition to prepping for a new tour, Silverman has been recognized a lot recently. “Her most recent special Sarah Silverman: Someone You Love was nominated for a Grammy, Golden Globe and Critics Choice Award.\n\nSilverman also “continues to host her critically acclaimed, weekly podcast, The Sarah Silverman Podcast, which relaunched on October 19 through Lemonada on all platforms and TBS’ Stupid Pet Tricks, an expansion of the famous David Letterman late-night segment,” her press release explains.\n\nSilverman’s last film work was a supporting role in the 2023 romantic drama Maestro starring Bradley Copper, and a supporting role in the 2022’s Marry Me, alongside Jennifer Lopez and Owen Wilson..\n\nIn anticipation of catching Silverman’s stand-up show later this year, you can find clips of her podcast in addition to throwback moments such as Silverman’s best bits on Saturday Night Live via her Instagram\n\nJeff Gorra is a Boston-based writer who has been with Beasley Media Group since the beginning of 2023. He writes about restaurants and food, as well as sports and rock music. His experience also includes show hosting and in-depth creative writing in rock and reggae dub music. Jeff’s an avid surfer, New York Giants, and Pearl Jam fan, however, if you make unforgettable pizza, he is sure to find you."
