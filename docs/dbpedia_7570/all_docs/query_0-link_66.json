        "text": "Sarah Silverman has delivered an ode to Americans to promote her upcoming weekly Hulu show I Love You, America.\n\nIn a nearly five-minute music video “I Love You, America: The Song” that is dedicated to everyone from the east coast to the west and “whatever’s in between,” the comedian calls out people from every race, nationality and sexual orientation before having a moment of reflection: “I’m categorizing human beings and putting them into little, individual boxes. Whether I mean it or not, I’m part of the problem.”\n\nThroughout the song, she calls herself out for white privilege and a late awareness to the Black Lives Matter movement, spurring a cameo from Parks and Recreation star Retta for an instructional moment: “I’m not all black people,” she tells an inquisitive Silverman.\n\nAfter her song and dance commentary is done, the star pauses the tune for an ending rant to Americans who accuse her of being a part of the Hollywood elite.\n\n“Sometimes I get really, really mad at you and the stupid shit that you do, and how you vote for these rich fucks who lie to your faces and then systematically rape you of your rights and your job and your healthcare,” she said. “And then you call me Hollywood elite? Dude, I’m from fucking New Hampshire.”\n\nShe then continues, before having an aha-moment: “And you’re mad at me for wanting the best for you and getting pissed when you vote against your own interests? I’m caring about you. I’m condescending to you.”\n\nDuring Silverman’s weekly series, which premieres Oct. 12 and will stream weekly on Thursday nights, she’s looking to connect with people who may not agree with her personal opinions through honesty, humor, a genuine interest in others and not taking herself too seriously.\n\nInitially, the show was not intended to be “overtly” political, but it appears that may have changed. “We pitched it, saying, ‘With this show, I’m hoping to connect with un-likeminded people.’ And networks went crazy because they haven’t heard anything like that before,” the comic has previously said of the 10-episode series, which will tape on Tuesdays and air on Thursdays. She did, however, set the tone early on: “What is really important is that it will be funny and silly and aggressively dumb, which is my favorite kind of comedy. And anything smart that’s in there will be served in a big, fat, bread-y sandwich of super, super dumb, because that’s how I like my comedy.”\n\nI Love You, America is produced by Funny or Die and is executive produced by Silverman, along with Adam McKay, Will Ferrell, Amy Zvi, Gavin Purcell and Joe Farrell.\n\nWatch the music video below."
