        "text": "One of the more entertaining celebrity feuds recently conducted on Twitter was a dust-up between Chris Anderson, curator of the elite techno-centric lecture series known as the TED conference, and Sarah Silverman, the boundary-busting comedian. (Can you tell already that this isn’t going to be a fair fight?)\n\nIn February Mr. Anderson took to his Twitter feed to criticize Ms. Silverman, the Emmy-nominated star of Comedy Central’s “Sarah Silverman Program,” for her casually vulgar TED presentation that month, which included a riff on “adopting a retarded child.”\n\nMr. Anderson wrote, “I know I shouldn’t say this about one of my own speakers, but I thought Sarah Silverman was god-awful ...”\n\nIn response on her Twitter account, Ms. Silverman sarcastically thanked Mr. Anderson for making the conference “an unsafe haven for all” and told him he was “a barnacle of mediocrity” on the rear end of Bill Gates.\n\nThe moral to that story may be that you should never engage in a war of words with Ms. Silverman without being prepared to unholster a few linguistic constructions not found in Bartlett’s Familiar Quotations.\n\nBut it also makes you wonder: who, in this day and age, has heard of Ms. Silverman without knowing of her aggressively silly, button-pushing comedy style? And who would be so naïve as to provide her with a platform and then criticize her for being herself?\n\nSimilarly, if there is a lesson to Ms. Silverman’s often hilarious and occasionally revelatory memoir, “The Bedwetter: Stories of Courage, Redemption, and Pee,” it is more profound than that its author is funny when she uses words she’s not supposed to. (Not for nothing does her list of alternate titles for the book include “Sarah Silverman: I Said ‘Vagina,’ Now Make Me Famous.”)\n\nMore than just a collection of gags and stand-up leftovers, “The Bedwetter” is a mostly cohesive narrative of how a rebellious comic perspective evolved and became inseparable from the person who employs it, and how anyone who could find offense in that is really the butt of the joke.\n\nReaders of “The Bedwetter” who share Mr. Anderson’s ignorance of Ms. Silverman’s work, including 20 years of caustic stand-up and viral videos like the 2008 pro-Obama pitch “The Great Schlep,” may wish to start at Page 179. There they will find a set list for her 2005 concert film, “Jesus Is Magic,” that reads like an inventory of her psyche, cluttered with phrases like “Porn song,” “Racism is bad,” “Low self- esteem” and “Hitler’s b-day.”\n\nWhen you return to the start of the book and Ms. Silverman’s account of her John Irvingesque upbringing in New Hampshire, it’s not hard to see how she accumulated such a strange catalog of fixations. While her father sold furniture from a store called Crazy Sophie’s Factory Outlet, and her mother recorded phone announcements for the local movie theater, Ms. Silverman was encouraged to crack precociously obscene jokes and rewarded with laughter for enunciating the word tampons or telling her Nana just where she could put her freshly baked brownies. Not even an early bomb — a failed joke about the accidental death of her baby brother, Jeffrey — could discourage Ms. Silverman’s youthful showmanship.\n\nDespite her assertion that she has tragically “never struggled with addiction and I was never molested,” there is a darkness to her adolescent memories. She was plagued by depression, she began taking Xanax at 13, and her therapist committed suicide. After she recounts being told about her doctor’s death by his shrieking colleague, Ms. Silverman writes with characteristic mordancy, “There needs to be some protocol, some set of standards, for how we tell depressed teenage girls that their shrinks have killed themselves.”\n\nWorst of all, from her childhood through her teenage years, Ms. Silverman suffered from the book’s titular affliction, which she equates with a death sentence. (“At least with liver cancer, people gather at your bedside instead of run from it,” she writes.) But when she watched the actress Jane Badler joke on “The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson” about her own battle with bedwetting, Ms. Silverman came to a crucial realization about taking ownership of her embarrassments — an insight that helped make her a stand-up comic unafraid of failure.\n\nAs she writes later in the book, “My early trauma was a gift, it turned out, in a vocation where your best headspace is feeling that you have nothing to lose.”\n\nOnce Ms. Silverman has established herself as a performer unafraid to discuss unpleasant truths and bodily functions and has risen from New York University dropout to staple of the New York comedy scene, a reader’s interest in the rest of her memoir may depend on having a curiosity about the inner workings of show business.\n\nFor such readers there’s a sweet and self-deprecating chapter about the fruitless year Ms. Silverman spent on “Saturday Night Live” (your loss, Lorne Michaels), as well as a surprisingly sincere discussion of her and her colleagues’ fights to preserve the absurdist sensibilities of “The Sarah Silverman Program” amid a writers’ strike, budget cuts and the editorial intrusions of network pinheads unnerved by the word “labia.”\n\nBut parts where Ms. Silverman revisits some of her most controversial appearances — a 2001 booking on Conan O’Brien’s show in which she used a racial slur to refer to Asian people; gigs for MTV awards shows at which she insulted targets like Paris Hilton and Britney Spears — seem self-indulgent, if not unnecessary. Who was it who once astutely noted, “There is nothing more pointless, and nothing less funny, than defending your own material”? Oh, right, it was Ms. Silverman, in this very book.\n\nSuch minor lapses are handily offset by memorable passages like the one in which Ms. Silverman and Louis C. K., a fellow comedian with a penchant for relentless truth telling, repeatedly strip off their clothes and toss them from the balcony of his Bleecker Street apartment, “giggling with terror” as they ride an elevator to retrieve their garments and fear that they may be discovered at any moment.\n\nIn its crude and frantic brilliance, the scene is a perfect metaphor for the peculiar and productive pathology of most great stand-up comedians: driven by the need to reveal layer after layer of themselves and hoping in the end to be caught with their pants down."
