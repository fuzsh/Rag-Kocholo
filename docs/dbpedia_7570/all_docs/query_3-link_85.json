        "text": "If you’re a fan of hilarious, and somewhat raunchy comedians, then this is your month to enjoy. We have on the calendar Lisa Lampenelli, Lewis Black, and Sarah Silverman. All are brilliant humorists who are highly successful at their craft and aren’t afraid to “twist the knife” a little.\n\nIn Pittsburgh we don’t just celebrate Earth Day, we have a full-on four day party. We’ve highlighted an Earth Week Fashion show, Elocution, and an Earth Day pub crawl put on by Great Lakes Brewing.\n\nWe also give the details on Pittsburgh Craft Beer Week and the new City Works Eatery and Pour House at Market Square. For a fun night on the town there’s Howl at the Moon and for good bluegrass, try the Bluegrass Jam at the Park House.\n\nFriday, April 7\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmoVKswuviE\n\nThe name of Lisa Lampanelli’s website, insultcomic.com, should give you an idea of what kind of comedy she performs. She began to perform stand-up in the early ’90s in New York City and perfected those insults at numerous roasts, including roasts of Chevy Chase, Flavor Flav, and Donald Trump. The Donald got the last laugh, firing her during the 12th season of “The Apprentice.” Before she became a comedian, she worked as a journalist. She was a copy editor at Popular Mechanics, an assistant at Rolling Stone, and a fact-checker at Spy. She returned to the printed word in 2009 with her memoir, Chocolate, Please: My Adventures in Food, Fat, and Freaks. She’s starred in a number of comedy specials, and her 2015 comedy album, “Back to the Drawing Board,” received a Grammy nomination. She brings her insults to The Palace Theatre. 8 p.m. 21 W. Otterman St., Greensburg. (CM)\n\nSaturday, April 8\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5LJbXyphA0\n\nThere is an F-word that comedian Lewis Black loves to use, and it’s not “funny.” Although Black himself is. Some have even said he’s funnier than the S-word he also likes to use, and if you’re in the mood for a rant, Black is your man. This is the technophobic guy who brought his iPhone to an Apple store to ask for “an app that will turn this piece of [S-word] into a TELEPHONE.” On social and political topics, Black is belligerently liberal—don’t get him started on religion, or on Donald Trump, for he is a self-starter who needs no encouragement. And what makes his ranting effective, as comedy, is that he doesn’t only foam at the mouth and scream. He is a finely controlled ranter with a dead-on sense of comic timing. Black has also appeared in over 40 films and TV shows and written six books. He has a sizable amount of fans, and his official fan club is named Frustrated Union of Cynical Kindreds Universal. Black is ranting at Heinz Hall on his The Rant, White & Blue Tour. 8 p.m. 600 Penn Ave., Cultural District. (MV, RH)\n\nThursday, April 20\n\nThere are many ways to celebrate Earth Day and pay tribute to our beautiful and delicate planet. One interesting manner is Pittsburgh Earth Day’s Ecolution Fashion Show, which kicks off four days of events for Pittsburgh Earth Day 2017. The main event begins in the beautiful, airy lobby of the Fairmont Hotel at 7 p.m. and is curated by Richard Parsakian and styled by Izzazu Salon, Spa, & Serata. This year’s theme, Planets–Preserving the Wonders of the Universe, is destined to give you an out-of-this-world experience. Musical heat will be generated by the noted DJ Soy Sos and attendees will enjoy performances from the Staycee Pearl Dance Project. The main highlight of the evening, from 7 to 10 p.m., will be a runway fashion show. It will feature models sporting stylish clothing made from recycled and reused materials created especially for the event by talented local designers. There is a VIP part of the evening, which begins at 6 p.m. and features complimentary cocktails and appetizers. VIP ticket holders will also get a seat next to the runway for the fashion show. Fairmont Hotel, 510 Market St., Downtown. (RH)\n\nFriday, April 21\n\nYou made it through winter cold and April showers, so now reward yourself with a tasty local brew. Pittsburgh Craft Beer Week 2017 begins on April 21 and continues through April 27. The week-long celebration of Western Pennsylvania’s craft brew culture features education, collaboration and cooperation, and responsible consumption of fine craft beers. The many events take place at various times and locations throughout the greater Pittsburgh area. See their website for a complete rundown. (RH)\n\nSaturday, April 22\n\nCity Works Eatery and Pour House is a restaurant chain with only four locations across the United States. Lucky for us, one of those locations opened in Pittsburgh in March, and it has plenty of fun planned for April. City Works has 15 flatscreens, 11,200 square feet of floor space, and an outdoor patio. Whether for lunch, happy hour, or dinner, expect classic American food with brilliant twists. Of notice to beer geeks—90 craft beers. 25 percent of its tap list is reserved for local breweries; expect that number to increase April 21-30 during Pittsburgh Craft Beer Week. The restaurant will raffle off Pirate tickets during that time. City Works is also participating in a Great Lakes Brewing Sustainable Sips Pub Crawl on Earth Day (April 22, 1-5 p.m.) in Market Square. For every passport completed by participants, a tree will be planted. Enjoy either one of these events or book a private party of your own. All in scenic Market Square. Sunday – Wednesday: 11 a.m. – midnight. Thursday – Saturday: 11 a.m. – 2 a.m. 2 PPG Place, Downtown. (CM)\n\nTuesday, April 25\n\nSarah Silverman exudes comedy. Everything she does, says, and wears (“Beer Nuts” hat, anyone?) will make you laugh. For proof, see her appearance on Jerry Seinfeld’s web-series, “Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.” Her stand-up career began in 1992, and her concert specials include 2005’s Jesus Is Magic and 2013’s We Are Miracles, which won an Emmy. Her television show, The Sarah Silverman Program, ran for three seasons on Comedy Central. She’s appeared in many other shows and movies, including “Seinfeld” and School of Rock. While dating Jimmy Kimmel, she and Matt Damon recorded a music video titled “I’m F*cking Matt Damon,” which quickly went viral. Her memoir, The Bedwetter, was published in 2010, and she voiced Vanellope von Schweetz in the Disney animated film Wreck-It Ralph in 2012. Is there any medium she can’t master? Probably not, but to see her in her original element, check out her appearance at Heinz Hall. 7:30 p.m. 600 Penn Ave., Cultural District. (CM)\n\nAll Month\n\nMost nightclubs rely on DJs for music. Not Howl at the Moon, where an in-house band covers your favorite hits. And what hits they are, running the gamut of ‘80s pop to today’s hip hop to even some classic rock in between. Howl at the Moon began in 1990 just down the Ohio River in Cincinnati and has since spread to 18 locations and the Norwegian Cruise Line. Aside from the live music, the establishment is also known for its 86 oz. mixed drink buckets. The venue is available to rent Sunday through Tuesday for different events, like bachelorette and birthday parties. Friday and Saturday, both table reservations and Jump the Line packages are available, allowing patrons to get a great view of the band. Howl 2-Go offers a dynamic and unique event experience with dueling piano entertainers brought to your next event. They offer several customizable dueling piano packages for Howl 2-Go. Regular hours are Wednesday through Friday, 5 p.m. – 2 a.m. Saturday, 6 p.m. – 2 a.m. 125 7th St., Downtown. (CM)\n\nCheck out the Bluegrass Jam at the Park House, which bills itself as Pittsburgh’s oldest and friendliest tavern. The Shelf Life String Band hosts this weekly event where you can relax and enjoy the music or join the jam. Either way, Yuengling pints are only $2 from 9 p.m. to midnight. Jam starts at 9 p.m. Enjoy complimentary peanuts and popcorn. 403 E. Ohio St., North Side.
