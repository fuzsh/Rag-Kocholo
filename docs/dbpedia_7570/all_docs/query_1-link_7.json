        "text": "Highest Rated: 100% Michael Bolton's Big, Sexy Valentine's Day Special (2017)\n\nLowest Rated: 8% The Bachelor (1999)\n\nBirthday: Dec 1, 1970\n\nBirthplace: Bedford, New Hampshire, USA\n\nActor and bawdy comedian Sarah Silverman built her career tackling controversial subjects head-on. While most comics only scratched the surface of the joke, Silverman dove into the murky depths of race, religion and sex and with her blas√©, seemingly prejudiced outbursts, effectively deflating taboos. However, taking on these issues was not without its controversies. Silverman was fired from her regular gig on \"Saturday Night Live\" (NBC, 1975- ), and in 2001, while appearing on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" (NBC, 1993-2009), she uttered a racial slur against Asian-Americans and was immediately castigated for it. Through it all, however, Silverman rarely checked her sharp tongue or curbed her cutting-edge comedy, making even the lewdest male comics blush on occasion - including on-and-off boyfriend, comedian-host, Jimmy Kimmel, to whom she dedicated the Internet video sensation, \"I'm F*cking Matt Damon.\"However, Silverman also had a more serious side, as shown in her political activism on behalf of the Democratic party, and on work such as the series \"I Love You, America\" (Hulu 2017- ), in which she tried to find common ground between political parties in the wake of Donald Trump's divisive political rise.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n100% Michael Bolton's Big, Sexy Valentine's Day Special\n\n100% Sarah Silverman: A Speck of Dust\n\n95% The Muppets\n\n94% The Bitter Buddha\n\n92% The School of Rock\n\n86% Yearly Departed\n\n84% Battle of the Sexes\n\n80% Sarah Silverman: We are Miracles\n\nPhotos\n\nSarah Silverman at arrivals for 2019 Writers Guild Awards WGA Los Angeles, The Beverly Hilton, Beverly Hills, CA February 17, 2019.
