        "text": "More to enjoy!\n\nExplore Hodgenville...\n\nAbraham Lincoln Presidential Statue\n\nSince 1909, a bronze presidential statue of Abraham Lincoln has been a welcoming point for millions of visitors from around the world.\n\nDesigned by A.A. Weinman, the 6-foot sculpture sits atop a marble pedestal in the center of historic, downtown Hodgenville — in front of The Lincoln Museum. (View map here)\n\nThe statue was commissioned to commemorate the 100th celebration of Abraham Lincoln's birthday with funds raised by residents of LaRue County in conjunction with Congressional and state support.\n\nThe statue was officially dedicated on May 31, 1909. Lincolnâs son, Robert Todd Lincoln, attended the ceremony, and Lincolnâs sister-in-law, Mrs. Ben Hardin Helm, unveiled the statue. More than 10,000 people witnessed the ceremony.\n\nBoy Lincoln Statue\n\nTo commemorate the bicentennial (200th anniversary) of Abraham Lincolnâs birth, a nationwide contest was conducted, with 77 artists from around the country submitting proposals.\n\nHe is depicted as a boy, shortly before his 8th birthday, on the family farm, reading from Websterâs Elementary Spelling-Book, with his dog Honey, whose broken leg he splinted.\n\nThe book is open to a Noah Webster fable of two dogs. Corn for the family dinner is in the linen satchel, and his stick-fishing pole is leaning against the tree trunk.\n\nThis winning design was created by the California firm of Daub-Firmin-Hendrickson. The statue of \"Boy Lincoln\" faces the 1909 Presidential Statue on the town square.\n\nDowntown Walking Tour\n\nThe museum has developed a downtown walking tour highlighting the historic downtown commercial district that has been part of the National Register of Historic Places since 1988.
