Book your room at our romantic Bed and Breakfast today!\n\nVisit Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Park\n\nOne of the signature places to visit on the Lincoln Heritage Trail in Kentucky is the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park. Here, the humble beginnings of our nation’s 16th President are on display. Lincoln was born on Kentuck’s frontier in what is now known as Hodgenville – and it was here that the forces of life in rural Kentucky shaped him into the man and leader he’d later become. Not only was this the site of his childhood, but the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park is also home to the first-ever Lincoln Monument, a monument later replicated in Washington, D.C.\n\nThere are two main units of the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Park. There’s the Birthplace Unit, the site of the first Lincoln Memorial, and the Boyhood Home Unit, which features a replica of Lincoln’s childhood home. The first Lincoln Memorial was built here between 1909 – 1911 and is constructed from Pink Granite and Marble. As you climb the steps to the memorial – 56 of them to represent the short number of years in his life – you’ll begin to feel the enormity of the legacy Abraham Lincoln left behind. Inside the memorial in Kentucky is a symbolic cabin meant to represent the one-room cabin he was born in on his father’s Kentucky farm.\n\nJust as you’d expect, the Boyhood Home Unit features a restored historical cabin similar to the one Lincoln and his family lived in from when he was two until he turned eight. This unit of the park is about 10 miles away from the birthplace unit in Knob Creek. Lincoln wrote of many of his earliest memories at this location, and it’s also where he saw Africans for the first time as they were taken to be sold into slavery. Among other things, this cabin serves as a poignant symbol of Lincoln’s humble beginnings.\n\nIn addition to these structures, visitors can use their time at the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park to explore various exhibits of his early life, the Lincoln family’s time in Kentucky, and the broader historical context of the early 19th century. Guided tours through the park also provide more details of his young life and how it influenced his later years.\n\nVisiting the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park is not just about seeing where Lincoln was born; it’s about connecting with the essence of his character and the roots that shaped a leader who would go on to face one of the nation’s most challenging periods. History comes alive in this special place, offering lessons that remain relevant today and foster a deeper appreciation for his enduring legacy.\n\nMore to See on the Lincoln Heritage Trail in Kentucky\n\nAbraham Lincoln may only have lived in Kentucky for his first eight years, but they were formative years that left a lasting impression on the future President. However, as significant as the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park is to our nation’s history, it’s just one of the attractions worth seeing along the Lincoln Heritage Trail in Kentucky.\n\nBelow, you’ll find more notable stops along the Lincoln Heritage Trail, each offering its own unique perspective on one of America’s most enduring historical figures.\n\nNot too far away from the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park is the Lincoln Museum, which features even more detailed exhibits about Lincoln’s life and times.\n\nIn Springfield, you’ll find the Lincoln Homestead State Park, which preserves the original homesteads of Lincoln’s family. There, you’ll find replicas of the 1782 cabin and blacksmith shop operated by his father and the home of his uncle, Mordecai. The site provides insight into the family’s life and the environment that influenced Lincoln’s early years.\n\nAnother stop worth making on the Lincoln Heritage Trail in Kentucky is visiting the Mary Todd Lincoln House in Lexington. This house belonged to Mary Todd Lincoln’s family and offers a unique glimpse into her family life before she became the First Lady. The restored residence displays period furniture and personal items of the Todd and Lincoln families, illustrating the domestic life of the era.\n\nIn Harrodsburg, you’ll find the Lincoln Marriage Temple, which houses the original log cabin where Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks were married, thus marking the beginning of the Lincoln family story.\n\nIf you’re looking to gain context into the era in which Lincoln lived and which ultimately shaped who he became as the 16th President, we recommend heading to the Farmington Historic Plantation in Louisville. It was the home of the Speed family, close friends of Lincoln, and offers insights into the agricultural and social history of Kentucky, themes pertinent to understanding Lincoln’s views on slavery and the economy. Another informative place to visit is the Perryville Battlefield State Historic Site, which is one of the most significant Civil War Sites in Kentucky.\n\nThere’s plenty to unpack along the historic Lincoln Heritage Trail in Kentucky, and that’s to say nothing about all the other great things to do in the area.
