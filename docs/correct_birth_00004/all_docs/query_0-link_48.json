        "text": "Tuesday, June 8, 1993\n\n93-331 - Abraham Lincoln Birthplace (Kentucky) - Severe Thunderstorm\n\nAn intense thunderstorm with winds of up to 100 mph struck the park on the afternoon of June 4th. Park maintenance foreman Russell Flanders sustained a minor head injury which required nine stitches when he was hit on the head by a falling branch. Downed trees led the superintendent to close all park trails until trees and snags can be cleared. It's estimated that the cleanup will cost about $15,000. [Carolyn Link, Superintendent, ABLI, 6/7]\n\nTuesday, March 4, 1997\n\n97-76 - Abraham Lincoln Birthplace NHS (Kentucky) - Storm Impacts\n\nThe park received 9.35 inches of rain over the period from March 1st to the 3rd. The basin area of the park was flooded by a knee-deep pool of water covering three acres on Saturday, March 1st. Sections of the Sinking Spring retaining wall and the split rail fence encircling the area were destroyed by water spilling over the top of the stairwell. A portion of the Boundary Oak retaining wall was also destroyed by runoff; wooden foot bridges over the Boundary Oak trail were relocated by the raging torrent, and trails were severely damaged, with sections completely washed away. Damage to the park has been estimated at approximately $25,000. Rain continued to fall on Sunday and Monday. The governor has declared a state of emergency, and efforts are underway to have much of Kentucky declared a disaster area. [Karren Brown, Superintendent, ABLI, 3/3]\n\nThursday, March 7, 2002\n\n02-053 - Abraham Lincoln Birthplace NHS (KY) - Special Event\n\nThe park celebrated the 193rd birthday of Abraham Lincoln on February 12th with numerous events in the park and in nearby Hodgenville. Director Mainella was on hand to place the annual ceremonial wreath at Lincoln's cabin with the assistance of a group of local school children. After the ceremony, she met with park employees and volunteers who organized the event. The highlight of the day was the ceremony officially transferring the deed to Knob Creek farm to the National Park Service. Lincoln spent his early childhood on the farm. A partnership among state legislators, park friends and the NPS cleared the way for the farm to be purchased and transferred to the service to become part of the park. The director was the keynote speaker at the ceremony; dignitaries included former senator Wendell Ford and former governor Louie B. Nunn, both of whom were instrumental in efforts to acquire Knob Creek farm. Rangers from Mammoth Cave NP handled traffic control and security for the events. [Gary Talley, Ops Chief, ABLI, 2/27]\n\nWednesday, June 5, 2002\n\n02-205 - Abraham Lincoln Birthplace NHS (KY) - Special Event: First Amendment Demonstration\n\nA special use permit was issued to an individual to hold a First Amendment demonstration in the park on May 26th. The permittee claimed that he would be speaking about Abraham Lincoln's historical stance on slavery and raising public awareness and support regarding proposed reparations to the descendents of slaves. As the event drew near, intelligence information indicated that the permittee was affiliated with the World Church of the Creator (WCOTC), a recognized white supremacist group that has a history of violence against minorities. Since the park has no law enforcement staff at present, assistance was sought from Mammoth Cave NP and ICS was put into effect. Of additional concern to park management was the possible presence of the Anti-Racist Americans (ARA), a group which has shown up at WCOTC demonstrations to protest against the racist philosophy of the WCOTC. These meetings have resulted in violent confrontations between demonstrators and law enforcement. The event was scheduled to coincide with the annual NordicFest celebration in Powderly, Kentucky. NordicFest espouses \"white power\" and is attended by such groups as the Imperial Klans of America. A third potential source of confrontation was a Ku Klux Klan rally held in nearby Sheperdsville, Kentucky, the previous day. Law enforcement rangers from Mammoth Cave NP and officers from the Kentucky State Police and the Larue County Sheriff's Office provided on-site security and response. The main speaker for the event was Matt Hale, the leader of the WCOTC and also the main speaker for the Nordic Fest celebration. Six individuals, identified as being supporters of Hale and his philosophy, attended the demonstration in the park. After the speech, Hale immediately left the area. There were no problems. Rangers remained in the area for the rest of the afternoon to prevent any possible confrontations. [Chief of Operation, ABLI, 5/29]\n\nTuesday, October 01, 2002\n\n02-501 - Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site (KY) - Suspicious Person\n\nA man walked into a restaurant in Hodgenville on the evening of September 23 and asked the night manager for directions to Lincoln's birthplace. The manager provided directions to the man, who then asked if the site was \"well ventilated.\" The manager assumed that he was talking about the park itself, which is located in a wooded area outside of town, so answered in the affirmative. The man replied: \"Good, good, well ventilated, that's all I need to know.\" He then walked out of the restaurant without purchasing anything. The manager was unable to see his vehicle, but was subsequently able to provide a description to state police the next day, including the fact that he appeared to be of Middle Eastern ancestry. State police officers in turn notified the park, and staff conducted a quick search of the facility. No suspicious items were found, nor have there been any suspicious persons in the park since the incident occurred. Rangers at nearby Mammoth Cave NP will be notified of any further developments. [Submitted by Brad McDougal, SA, MACA]\n\nFriday, July 16, 2004\n\nAbraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site (KY)\n\nStorm Damage\n\nA thunderstorm with high winds passed over the park on the evening of July 13th, uprooting many trees and tearing down powerlines throughout the area. The park reports many trees down and limbs and debris scattered throughout the site. The visitor center suffered roof damage from falling limbs, but water damage was minimal due to the limited amount of rain accompanying the storm. The park has been closed since the storm's passage and efforts are currently underway to remove downed trees and debris and fix the roof. Due to the extent of power outages, the power company has not been able to specify when power will be restored.\n\n[Submitted by Ken Apschnikat, Superintendent]\n\nThursday, July 29, 2004\n\nAbraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site (KY)\n\nRecovery from Wind Storm Damage\n\nThe park is recovering from major storm damage inflicted when a severe thunderstorm with hurricane-force winds passed through the park on the evening of Tuesday, July 13th. The park was closed due to loss of power and telephone service until the afternoon of Saturday, July 17th. Numerous trees were uprooted and limbs and debris scattered throughout the park, forcing the closure of the Birthplace Unit until the afternoon of the 17th, when only the visitor center, memorial building and grounds were reopened. The visitor center roof was damaged and park features suffered minor damage from downed limbs and trees. Fortunately, the park had a contract with a local tree service, which assisted with the cleanup effort beginning on July 14th. The removal of debris and downed trees from the grounds and trails was continuing at the time of the report (July 23rd). Approximately 35 trees are still down across trails, with over 15 on the grounds. Major park trails will be closed for the foreseeable future due to the large number of uprooted and downed trees. Cleanup and repairs will be ongoing within the coming weeks.\n\n[Submitted by Ken Apschnikat, Superintendent]\n\nThursday, July 29, 2004\n\nAbraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site (KY)\n\nRecovery from Wind Storm Damage\n\nThe park is recovering from major storm damage inflicted when a severe thunderstorm with hurricane-force winds passed through the park on the evening of Tuesday, July 13th.

Although park buildings appear to have escaped with minimal damage, tree damage has been extensive. More is considered probable, as the temperature is forecast to remain below freezing through tomorrow, the ice and snow coating park trees is not melting, and increased wind speeds are predicted. Electrical outages are widespread and include the park, which remains closed. The trees that were recently planted (2006) to restore the cultural landscape have been severely damaged, and it appears that it will not be possible to salvage many of them. Additional reports from this park and Mammoth Cave will appear next week. []\n\nMonday, February 9, 2009\n\nSoutheast/Midwest Regions\n\nParks Rebound From Ice Storm\n\nThe three parks most affected by last month's big ice storm - Abraham Lincoln Birthplace NHS, Buffalo NR and Mammoth Cave NP - have all made substantial progress in efforts to return to normal operations, but all report continuing closures and ongoing recovery operations. Here's how things currently stand:\n\nAbraham Lincoln Birthplace NHS - The park, which is scheduled to host a Lincoln bicentennial event this week, is slowly recovering from the storm. Electrical and telephone service have been restored and limited visitor services resumed last Friday. Visitors have access to the main parking lot, the visitor center, and the memorial building in the Birthplace Unit. The Knob Creek Unit, picnic area, all unpaved trails, and most park lawns will remain closed until debris is removed and safety considerations are addressed. A regional incident assessment team traveled to the park last Friday to assess and document damage.\n\n[Jeff West, Buffalo; Vickie Carson, Mammoth Cave; Keith Pruitt, Abraham Lincoln Birthplace]\n\nWednesday, January 10, 2024\n\nAbraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park\n\n\"Credible threat\"\n\nOn December 26, the park's Birthplace Unit closed due to a \"credible threat.\" Law enforcement made an investigation and determined that the threat was no longer credible. The park reopened after that determination. Source: The News-Enterprise\n\nMay 15, 2024\n\nAbraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park\n\nStorm\n\nOn May 8, the park closed due to incoming storms and severe weather. As of May 10, the park had reopened most areas, with the Loop C trail at the Birthplace Picnic Area closed due to standing water. By May 13, all areas of the park were open.
