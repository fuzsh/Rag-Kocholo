        "text": "President Theodore Roosevelt, a well-known Lincoln admirer, spoke when the cornerstone was laid on February 12, 1909, the centennial of Lincoln's birth. President William Howard Taft dedicated the completed building on November 9, 1911. The memorial building and farm, managed by the National Park Service, became a national park in 1916. You can read the fascinating story of the park's history in Merrill Peterson's book, Lincoln in American Memory.\n\nA few months before Lincoln was born his parents and sister moved from nearby Elizabethtown to the property, known as Sinking Spring Farm. His father paid $200 for 348 acres of stony ground on the south fork of Nolin Creek. The farm's name came from a spring on the property which emerged from a deep cave, still visible today. However, Lincoln did not remember living on the farm because his family moved down the road to Knob Creek Farm when he was only two years old.\n\nIf you visit the site, you will find information and exhibits in the reception center near the memorial building. Among the artifacts is the Lincoln family Bible with the signature of his father and mark of his mother and the tiny tombstone of his infant brother. Many visitors stay to see a brief orientation film about Lincoln's early life in Kentucky.\n\nHours: This historic site is free of charge and open daily between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.; it is closed on New Year's Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas.
