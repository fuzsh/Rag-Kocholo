Their story is often overshadowed by Theodore Roosevelt’s visit, but for the first time we’ll shed light on their importance.\n\nLike many of those dignitaries who came here for the 1909 dedication, Revered J. Edmund Wood came from a strong religious background. He was the president of the National Baptist Convention for several years, and was also the pastor of the First Baptist Church in Danville, Kentucky. However, he also had a variety of other experiences, including as a teacher, undertaker, printer, and as an editor of a newspaper in Danville and Lexington. \n\nHis education background was also impressive; he graduated from the Kentucky Normal and Industrial Institute, National Correspondence College, and State University. His accomplishments reflected the legacy of opportunity for all Americans after the Civil War, a legacy Abraham Lincoln would have embraced.\n\nImage description: photograph of a mustached Reverend Wood, wearing a suit and tie.\n\n#BlackHistoryMonth #KentuckyHistory #AmericanHistory #History #UndiscoveredStories\".",
