        "text": "Early Days\n\nSettlers arrived in our area in the late 1780s and founded a community that relied on common goals and individual resilience. Our rich history is preserved in a variety of attractions and unique destinations.\n\nAbraham Lincoln\n\nThe sixteenth president was born on February 12, 1809 in a small cabin three miles from our present-day downtown. Today, our community is home to three unique Lincoln destinations: Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park, Abraham Lincoln Boyhood Home at Knob Creek, and Kentucky’s Official Lincoln Museum."
