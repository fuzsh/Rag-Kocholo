        "text": "On February 12, 1809, Abraham Lincoln was born in a one-room log cabin on Sinking Spring farm near present-day Hodgenville. When Abraham was two years old, the Lincoln family moved to a farm at nearby Knob Creek, leaving what would become known as Lincoln’s “birthplace cabin” behind.\n\nPublic interest in the presidential birthplace began with Lincoln’s election in 1860 and intensified greatly after his assassination in 1865. By the 1890s, artists were creating illustrations of the cabin like this one by an unknown artist and romanticized birthplace scenes like this one by L.H. King.\n\nIn 1927 Lincoln scholar Louis A. Warren published this story of the cabin, confident that he had established its authenticity.\n\nUltimately that confidence was misplaced. The search for the “birthplace cabin” was, according to National Park Service historian Richard Sellars, “a historical maze of profit-seeking and truth-seeking, cross-pollination with Confederate relics, uninformed commemoration and bureaucratic entrenchment.”\n\nThe original log cabin had been dismantled long before 1865, but according to local tradition, some of the cabin’s logs had been used in the construction of a house built nearby. In 1894 A.W. Dennett, a New York businessman and promoter, purchased the Sinking Spring farm and the logs reputed to be from the birthplace cabin. He reconstructed a cabin using those logs on the farm property, hoping to draw the adoring and the curious to the presidential site. When the crowds did not come, Dennett dismantled the cabin and sent it on tour to Nashville, New York, Buffalo, and other cities. In the process, the cabin’s “Lincoln logs” got mixed up with the logs from another cabin Dennett had purchased and sent on tour—a cabin reputed to be the birthplace of Confederate president Jefferson Davis. Finally, around 1900, all the logs were put into storage.\n\nPublic interest in the Kentucky birthplace site continued, even without the reconstructed cabin, as this souvenir booklet published in 1903 attests.\n\nSo in 1906 the recently established Lincoln Farm Association purchased all the “birthplace cabin” logs. The Association believed that the logs were authentic and set about reconstructing the cabin.\n\nThey placed “the original log cabin in which Abraham Lincoln was born” inside a granite and marble neo-Classical Memorial Building on the birthplace site near Hodgenville, Kentucky. At the entrance to the Memorial Building is the inscription, “Here over the log cabin where Abraham Lincoln was born, destined to preserve the Union and free the slave, a grateful people have dedicated this memorial to unity, peace, and brotherhood among the states.”\n\nThe existence of an authentic “birthplace cabin” had been questioned as early as the 1860s, and in a 1919 letter, Lincoln’s son Robert Todd Lincoln had bluntly declared, “the actual cabin was a decayed ruin long before my father's election as President. The structure now enshrined in a great marble building in Kentucky is a fraud when represented as the actual home.”\n\nStill, the aura of the “birthplace cabin” clung to the enshrined log structure as the Memorial Building’s cornerstone was laid by President Theodore Roosevelt on February 12, 1909, President William Howard Taft dedicated the completed building on November 9, 1911, and the site was turned over to the federal government in 1916 and to the National Park Service in 1933.\n\nIt wasn’t until 1948 that the Park Service undertook an investigation of the cabin’s authenticity, and the resulting report concluded that the evidence against the cabin actually being Lincoln’s birthplace was overwhelming.\n\nAnother report published in 1991 reached the same conclusion. Finally in 2004, tree-ring sampling of some of the logs revealed they dated only to 1848."
