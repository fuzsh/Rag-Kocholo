        "text": "Abraham Lincoln traveled an uncommon course from the Kentucky frontier to the highest office in the nation. At a critical time in our history, Lincoln preserved the Union, led America out of slavery and shaped the destiny of millions. In telling Lincoln's Kentucky story, we sense the ambition, perseverance and moral courage of this remarkable leader.\n\nIn addition to being the birthplace of Lincoln, Kentucky was home to his wife, best friend, law partners and business associates. Although he left the Bluegrass State as a boy, these relationships with Kentuckians played a major role in forging his personal and political life. Lincoln's connections to Kentucky and his appreciation for the importance of the commonwealth to the Union cause further strengthened Lincoln's bonds to the history of this state.\n\nToday, dozens of counties in Kentucky have Lincoln and Civil War sites that tell the story of this extraordinary man.\n\nThrough \"Explore Kentucky History,\" you can experience the people and places of Kentucky with connections to the 16th president."
