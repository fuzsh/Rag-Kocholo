        "text": "Hodgenville, city, seat (1843) of Larue county, central Kentucky, U.S. It lies along the Nolin River just southeast of Elizabethtown. The area was settled in 1789 by Robert Hodgen, who moved there from Pennsylvania and erected a mill and tavern. The city is now an agricultural trading centre (beef, dairy products, tobacco, corn [maize], soybeans, and alfalfa), and natural-gas wells are nearby; wearing apparel (industrial uniforms) is also manufactured there. Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site is 3 miles (5 km) south on the Old Sinking Spring Farm; established in 1916, the site preserves about one-third of the original farm where Abraham Lincoln was born. The Knob Creek Farm, where Lincolnâ€™s family moved when he was two, is 10 miles (16 km) northeast. Inc. 1839. Pop. (2000) 2,874; (2010) 3,206."
