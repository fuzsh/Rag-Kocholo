        "text": "Abraham Lincoln was born in a log cabin near Hodgenville, Kentucky, on February 12, 1809. His parents, Thomas and Nancy Hanks Lincoln, were pioneer farmers. In 1816 the family moved to Indiana. After Abe’s mother died, his father married Sarah Bush Johnston. In all, Abe went to school for less than a year.\n\nIn 1830 Lincoln moved to New Salem, Illinois. He tried several jobs and began to study law books. After becoming a lawyer in 1836, he moved to Springfield, Illinois. In 1842 Lincoln married Mary Todd. They had four sons.\n\nIn 1834 Lincoln was elected to the Illinois legislature. He was reelected three times. In 1847 he entered the U.S. House of Representatives. In 1849 he returned to his law practice.\n\nThe issue of slavery brought Lincoln back to politics. In 1856 Lincoln helped to organize the Illinois branch of the new Republican Party. Republicans wanted to stop the spread of slavery. In 1858 Lincoln challenged the Democrat Stephen A. Douglas for a seat in the U.S. Senate. The two candidates took part in several debates on slavery. Douglas won the election, but the debates made Lincoln famous.\n\nLincoln ran for president in 1860 and won. The Southern states feared that a Republican president would abolish slavery. They decided to secede from, or leave, the Union. South Carolina seceded in December 1860. By the time Lincoln took office in March 1861 six more Southern states had seceded. The Southern states organized a separate government, the Confederate States of America.\n\nThe Civil War began in April 1861, when Confederate troops fired on Fort Sumter, a Union fort in South Carolina. Lincoln’s main goal in the war was to save the Union. However, he knew he had to settle the slavery question in order for the United States to survive. In 1862 Lincoln promised freedom for enslaved people in any Confederate state that did not return to the Union that year. When the South paid no attention, Lincoln freed those enslaved people with the Emancipation Proclamation, signed on January 1, 1863.\n\nIn November 1863 Lincoln delivered a speech—called the Gettysburg Address—at a battlefield in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. He promised to save the United States’s “government of the people, by the people, for the people.”\n\nIn 1864 Lincoln was elected to a second term as president. On April 9, 1865, General Robert E. Lee surrendered his Confederate army to Union leader General Ulysses S. Grant. To celebrate the end of the war, Lincoln went to Ford’s Theatre in Washington, D.C., on the night of April 14. During the play John Wilkes Booth, a young actor and slavery supporter, shot Lincoln in the head. Lincoln died the next morning. Vice President Andrew Johnson became president."
