        "text": "HODGENVILLE, KENTUCKY\n\nThe Memorial Building at the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site in Hodgenville, Kentucky was designed by architect John Russell Pope and completed in 1911. It houses a log cabin that is comprised of some logs which was once believed to have been part of the original Lincoln birth cabin. It is located approximately 3 miles from Lincolnâ€™s birthplace on Sinking Spring Farm. The War Department managed the site until 1933 when it was transferred to the National Parks Service, who continues to oversee the site today. The park was designated a national historic park in 1939. Our work on the project, contracted through general contractor, Lightsey Restorations, included masonry restoration, plaster restoration, metal fabrication, complete window and door restoration, glazing, and interior painting."
