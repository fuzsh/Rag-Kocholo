        "text": "Spend the weekend in Abraham Lincoln's hometown\n\nThis weekend, you could hit the sales at your favorite department store. Or, you could go on a getaway to Abraham Lincoln's hometown of Springfield, Ill.\n\nThe nation's 16th president lived in Springfield from 1837 until his election to the presidency in 1860, and today the city offers numerous historic attractions.\n\n\"It's a chance to see once-in-a-lifetime sites related to Abraham Lincoln,\" said Alicia Erickson, marketing specialist for the Springfield Convention and Visitors Bureau. \"In downtown Springfield, you're walking around in the same area that Lincoln walked.\"\n\nStart your visit at the Lincoln Home National Historic Site, the only national park in Illinois. The four-block historic district includes the home where the Lincoln family lived starting in 1844. It has been restored to its appearance in 1860, the year of Lincoln's first presidential election.\n\nThe site offers free guided tours, and its visitor center screens several films about Lincoln's life and political career. Several other restored homes in the district have Lincoln exhibits, as well.\n\nFrom there, you can follow in Lincoln's footsteps to the reconstructed Old State Capitol just a few blocks away.\n\nIt's where Lincoln served as a state representative, and where he delivered his famous \"House Divided\" speech in 1858. After Lincoln's assassination in 1865, his body lay in state here for two days.\n\nNext, visit the Lincoln Tomb at Oak Ridge Cemetery — the nation's most-visited cemetery after Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. It is the final resting place of Abraham Lincoln, Mary Todd Lincoln and three of their four sons.\n\nAnother popular spot is the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, which celebrates its 10th anniversary this year.\n\nThe museum's current exhibition, \"Undying Words: Lincoln 1858-1865,\" focuses on five Lincoln speeches that highlighted his evolving views on slavery.\n\nThe exhibition also includes more than 120 Lincoln artifacts, including the bed in which he died and a pair of his bloody gloves from the night of the assassination. Lincoln devotees will love the gift shop, which stocks everything from Lincoln-related books to Lincoln-shaped salt and pepper shakers. The shop also stocks jams, jellies and preserves inspired by Mary Todd Lincoln's recipes.\n\nWhat else to see: Twenty miles northwest of Springfield, Lincoln's New Salem is a Conner Prairie-style living history museum. It showcases the Illinois community where Lincoln lived for six years in early adulthood. The site includes 12 log homes, 10 artisan workshops, a schoolhouse, a tavern and more — all constructed and furnished as they would have been in 1830.\n\nWhere to stay: For historic ambiance, try the Inn at 835. The turn-of-the-century Classical Revival building has 13 rooms and suites, and it's a 15-minute walk to the Old State Capitol or the Lincoln Home National Historic Site.\n\nWhere to eat: For old-fashioned charm, try Maldaner's Restaurant. Open since 1884, it is the oldest restaurant in Springfield. The dinner menu includes dishes such as beef Wellington, rack of lamb and stuffed quail. \"They do some traditional things, but they're very farm-to-table focused,\" Erickson said.\n\nIF YOU GO\n\n• Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum: 112 N.
