        "text": "Abraham Lincoln was humbly born, self-taught and ambitious—he seized the opportunities of an expansive society to rise the country’s highest office. Over 150 years after his death, people from around the world continue to take inspiration from the principles, words, and resolute leadership of the sixteenth President of the United States. He is frequently invoked by political and social leaders. Lincoln’s words have shaped the way we think about our country and ourselves as citizens, and few figures loom larger in the American imagination.\n\n—The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History\n\nAbrahamLincoln.org brings together the scholarship and resources of The Lincoln Institute and The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History. Here you’ll find timelines, documents, essays, lesson plans, video, and multimedia presented both by theme and type of featured resource."
