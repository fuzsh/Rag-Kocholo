Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, near Hodgenville in Hardin County, Kentucky. The Lincoln family moved to Little Pigeon Creek, Indiana, in 1816. Two years later when Lincoln was nine years old, his mother Sarah died. The family moved again in 1830 to Illinois, where Lincoln resided until moving to Washington, DC, in 1861.

His entire pre-presidential political career involved representing the people of Illinois, leading to the state’s official slogan “Land of Lincoln.” Though Illinois played a vital role in Lincoln’s life, it can not be forgotten that the state of Kentucky is the president’s birthplace.

Lincoln's Kentucky birthplace has been showcased on numerous worldwide postage stamps and event envelopes, like the two shown here.
