Remnants and pieces of history remain throughout the state of Kentucky with fascinating museums and meaningful historical sites. Many historic figures have ties to the Bluegrass State and perhaps the most well known and significant is Abraham Lincoln. Our 16th President was born in Kentucky and spend his first years in our state. You can visit sites that remember and honor Lincoln’s life and they can be found around the town of Hodgenville. In downtown Hodgenville, the Lincoln Museum was recently named the best museum in Kentucky, so if you haven’t visited, you may want to add it to your list.
