Josef Elliott Using HP ControlPoint to find, analyse & classify unstructured enterprise data Dominic Johnstone Using AIO to analyse and manage database and application content Mark Gower What do I do with the data I find? Dominic Johnstone Securing and managing data with HP Records Manager Craig Adams Hosting your data in the secure HP Cloud Bharat Mistry Putting it all together DEMO of ControlPoint and Records Manager Dominic Johnstone Arthur Leclerc-Chalvet Q&A and Prize Draw for HP Tablet Device Josef Elliott 1\n\n2. Today’s Information Reality Overload or opportunity? EXPLOSION OF DATA • Data doubling every 12-18 months • New, unstructured data types to manage • Storage growth is outpacing IT budget • Growth of ungoverned structured data DATA EVERYWHERE REAL-TIME ACCESS INCREASED REGULATIONS • Mobile, virtual, cloud joins physical and onpremise • New Data Security considerations • 67% of users have three or more computing platforms • Always-on applications and users • Users have high up time expectations • Business continuity moves to forefront • Escalating regulatory and higher volumes • Find the “needle in haystack” • Utilize corporate information assets Growing IT Burden, Business Inefficiency and Risk Exposure driving Information Governance 2\n\n3. Enterprise Information Environment “Missed Opportunity” Social Media “Increased Risk” “Cost & Complexity” Video HRMS Supply Chain Management/ Inventory Mgmt Email Texts Messages Procurement CRM ERP Images Word, Excel Audio Transactional Data Human Information 90% Logs Clickstream Data Structured Information Organisations need to handle 100% of this information 10% 3\n\n6. Why is it growing…..? Current behaviour leads to over-retention The myth of cheap storage, coupled with lack of clear policy creates confusion We are running out of capacity Let„s add more disks Applications are slowing down Upgrade infrastructure Backup takes longer and longer Change backup infrastructure We need to retain information... Keep tapes …For a certain period of time We keep everything forever We need to be compliant Implement archive, DMS, RM,... We need to retrieve information... Look into different sources …Historical information Recover tapes 6\n\n7. Dark Data “like our own physical universe, the digital universe is rapidly expanding and incredibly diverse, with vast regions that are unexplored and some that are, frankly, scary”. (IDC, Digital Universe, 2013) 7\n\n9. Defining Dark Data Characteristics of dark data What is it? • • • • • • Human readable Unstructured Not indexed Unmanaged Inactive Orphaned Where is it? • • • File Servers SharePoint Email Servers 9\n\n10. Opportunities and Risks of Dark Data What lies hidden in your dark data? Understanding your dark data can have significant benefits: • Cost savings through the reduction of storage and management overhead by allowing the defensible destruction of non-required data • Prepares and organizes valuable legacy information to provide insight into current and future business processes • Allows you to recognize information types and structures and develop policies to properly govern information in future Data that remains dark has the potential risk of: • • • • Containing sensitive information that is unprotected from data leakage and misuse Information being used out of context Decisions are based on outdated versions of information Duplicate effort is spent in producing the same information again 10\n\n11. Confusion, Cost, Risk The Information Paradox Information Gartner Inc 2012 11\n\n12. Document Production Document Production Requirement Applicable for Litigation, Regulatory Submission or Internal enquiry purposes Major financial benefit accrues when “document production” becomes a repeatable, defensible process 12\n\n13. It’s actually all about Information Management 13\n\n14. Six Steps to Redemption 1. Understand the logical information environment 2. Identify existing information repositories 3. Index to understand your existing data 4. Deep dive analysis and advanced content analytics to extract meaning 5. Archive, Protect, Dispose 6. Secure the benefits 14\n\n15. Applying Information Governance to Dark Data A stepwise approach to making sense of your dark data 1. 2. 3. 4. Identify your dark data sources Create a light metadata index Reduce obvious ROT Perform deeper analysis, incorporating advanced data analytics to add meaning and context to the data (data becomes information) 5. Categorize the information 6. Define and apply auditable policy to the information Analyse Execute Sample Auditable Policy Approve 15 © Copyright 2012 Hewlett-Packard Development Company, L.P. The information contained herein is subject to change without notice. Tag\n\n16. Reducing Redundant, Obsolete and Trivial Data Freeing up space and reducing volumes in preparation for in-depth analysis Redundant: • • • 16 Obsolete: Identify duplicate • documents Identify the master (assess against obvious • master sources) Get rid of the copies • Identify documents that haven‟t been accessed for a long time Compare against your retention schedules Get rid of the ones that are obviously past their use by date © Copyright 2012 Hewlett-Packard Development Company, L.P. The information contained herein is subject to change without notice. Trivial: • • • • Identify documents that have no valuable content System Files, Crash Dumps, Thumbnails etc. Assess on the basis of file types Get rid of the obviously trivial ones\n\n17. Use Advanced Content Analytics to Extract Meaning Develop an understanding of the business context of your dark data Clustering • • Visualize common content patterns in your dark data Identify groupings for policy development and application Trained Categories • • • Leverage your investment in records management Use known documents to train categories Identify category matches in your dark data Eduction • • Identify sensitive information in documents e.g. Credit Card Numbers, Social Security Numbers etc. Secure documents appropriately 17 © Copyright 2012 Hewlett-Packard Development Company, L.P. The information contained herein is subject to change without notice.\n\n18. Policy Application and Execution Dealing with the categorized information Defensible Destruction • • • Seek approval from identified owners Provide audit reports on all stages of your decision process (identification, sampling, tagging etc.) Maintain audit logs of deletion process Migration • • • Migrate to records management, archives or secondary storage system according to the business value of the information Migrate metadata and tags if possible Maintain audit logs of the migration process In-Place Management • • • 18 Use a policy engine to enforce future application of the policy you have selected now Quality of information and policy application depends on the capabilities of the system under management Maintain audit trails of any actions applied © Copyright 2012 Hewlett-Packard Development Company, L.P. The information contained herein is subject to change without notice.\n\n19. Ongoing Information Governance Keeping everything under control Identify how business processes use and generate information • • Adjust ongoing information governance policies according to business and regulatory requirements Cover both structured and unstructured information Keep indexes up to date • • • Leverage for enterprise searching Keeps data accessible Allows ongoing categorisation Automate as much as possible: • • • • 19 Implement performance and compliance archives Apply ongoing policies based on indexed categories Auto-capture records Manage records in-place © Copyright 2012 Hewlett-Packard Development Company, L.P.

Reduce Cut down on the data volume Provide defensible deletion • Apply deletion and deduplication based on ControlPoint policy • Standard ControlPoint policy review step is available • Use ControlPoint workflow policy actions for extended review processes (requires APA) 30 © Copyright 2012 Hewlett-Packard Development Company, L.P. The information contained herein is subject to change without notice.\n\n31. Manage/Migrate Taking the step from cleanup to ongoing information governance Merge legacy data into current information governance policies • Declare move, secure move, hold, manage in place through ControlPoint policies • Migration of organised legacy data between repositories(e.g. File System to HP Records Manager SharePoint, Exchange to ACA etc.) • Declare legacy data as records (in place or migration) • Ongoing application of ControlPoint policies to new data identified based on trained categories 31 © Copyright 2012 Hewlett-Packard Development Company, L.P.
