        "text": "The article goes on to make the observation:\n\n\"Take three or four of the best universities in the world, put them in a city with a seaport, and voilà!\" says Lobo. But copying the region's formula is quite another matter. How can one city start to emulate another that attracts the most research funding in the United States and has been built up over centuries?”\n\nFrom the article: Cities: Building the best cities for science\n\nThe quote teases the question about how another city can copy some of the same ideas from successful cities like Boston, or Austin, which tend to \"punch above their weight\". We'll take a look at the recommendations later on in this article.\n\nBeyond citations, we also see large investment dollars by large technology companies in new research labs clustered in these same cities and emerging regions like Toronto[footnote:Toronto], Canada:\n\nFacebook opens new lab in Seattle, WA\n\nToronto gains significant investment\n\nFacebook opens Paris, France AI Lab\n\nThese lab investment tend to cluster in cities that house high-end research institutes that produce specific types of STEM research. In the examples above, we see the investment largely cluster around graduate programs producing deep learning research, as the field of deep learning is largely credited for advances in computer vision, robotics, and advanced sensor analysis (among others).\n\nCorrelating High-Output Research Regions with Key Technology Company Formation\n\nNow let's correlate these high-producing research cities with key large technology companies, and trace those back to the ones that were founded from students at the schools.\n\nSan Francisco Area (Silicon Valley)\n\nBoston, MA\n\nSeattle, WA\n\nAustin, TX\n\nIn San Francisco we have more core companies than we can exhaustively list, but setting schools aside for a moment, easy names to throw out that are based in the Silicon Valley area:\n\nGoogle[footnote:Google]\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nUber\n\nOracle\n\nCisco\n\nVMWare\n\nAlong with their class of 2017 IPOs:\n\nCloudera\n\nOkta\n\nMongo\n\nMuleSoft\n\nSo let's take a closer look at how many of these are tied to schools in the region. The key schools[footnote:Schools] in the area are Stanford and University of CA at Berkeley. This region was home to an early wave of key technology companies based out of Stanford:\n\nHewlett-Packard\n\nVarian Associates\n\nWatkins-Johnson\n\nMore recent notable companies that trace their origin stories back to those schools include:\n\nGoogle - Stanford[footnote:Google]\n\nCisco - Stanford\n\nTrifacta - Dr. Joe Hellerstein via Berkeley, Sean Kandel via Stanford\n\nLinkedIn - Stanford, and then Confluent was spun out of LinkedIn\n\nCloudera - Dr Amr Amadallah, Stanford, Mike Olson, Berkeley\n\nDatabricks - multiple founders via Berkeley AmpLab team\n\nThen we have prolific researchers whose careers spanned multiple schools (Berkeley, MIT) and created multiple companies at both school, most notably Dr. Michael Stonebraker:\n\nDaniel Abadi, co-founder of Hadapt (acquired by Teradata)\n\nRobert Epstein (founder and former VP of engineering of Sybase)\n\nDiane Greene (co-founder and former CEO of VMWare)\n\nPaula Hawthorn (founder of Britton-Lee, formerly VP of engineering of Informix)\n\nGerald Held (former VP of engineering of Oracle)\n\nJoseph M. Hellerstein (faculty at UC Berkeley, co-founder of Trifacta)\n\nMike Olson (former CEO of Sleepycat Software and founding CEO of Cloudera)\n\nMargo Seltzer (Professor of Computer Science at Harvard, founder and former CTO of Sleepycat Software)\n\nDale Skeen, founder of Tibco, founder and CEO of Vitria\n\nAnupam Bhide, founder and CEO of Calsoft\n\nCombined, Cal Berkeley and Stanford have likely incubated more tech success stories than any other region in the world in terms of pure market cap valuation. When you have 50 years of compounding effects of private and public joint investment in a region (and favorable market trends), we see a region create economic output that is likely unique in the world today (translation: its hard to replicate this easily).\n\nWe can go on to examine some of the success stories in the Boston region[footnote:Boston] :\n\nAkamai Technologies (students out of MIT)\n\nEMC\n\nSkyworks\n\nWayfair\n\nTripAdvisor (Harvard)\n\nMathWorks\n\nHubSpot\n\nBoston Dynanics\n\niRobot\n\nRaytheon\n\nPowerhouse research programs such as Harvard, MIT, and more call the Boston area home. We not only see many companies formed in the area around this cluster of research output, but we also see a lot of companies like Amazon and Microsoft putting labs in this regions as well.\n\nWith Seattle, WA, obviously the two most famous technology companies would be Microsoft and Amazon. Jeff Bezos is on record as saying engineering talent availability was a major factor in starting Amazon in Seattle[footnote:Seattle] with the University of Washington as a fertile computer science recruiting ground.\n\nAustin, TX is another interesting case where we don't see as many of the companies formed there, but we see nearly every major tech company with a large office in Austin. Companies founded in Austin, TX Area:\n\nDell\n\nIndeed.com\n\nHomeAway\n\nNetspend\n\nQ2ebanking\n\nMajor companies with large offices in Austin, TX:\n\nFacebook\n\nAmazon\n\nMicrosoft\n\nGeneral Motors\n\nCloudera\n\nApple\n\nOracle\n\nIBM\n\nWhile not every single company was founded by 2 people out of a garage in Palo Alto, a lot of these companies have at least part of their origin story connected to research produced by high-performing graduate programs. These people ended up in the area specifically for those graduate programs, and ended up staying close to found key technology companies.\n\nA counter-argument to the relationship between these cities and high output graduate programs might be the argument that these cities have well-funded computer science programs due to the abundance of wealthy tech companies pouring in money; its more likely that these programs feed the region with candidates, pulling in companies, who pour money back into programs in a virtuous cycle. What we do not see are regions that have robust tech sectors without high-producing regional phd programs in computer science.\n\nThe compounding and derivative effects of regional graduate research, research labs, and the formation of key technology companies created tend to show yeild over time in certain key cities. We believe investment in specifically graduate research programs is how these ecosystems of technology are booted up for the long-run. Those things being said, these are long-term-class investments, which are not easy to make. Let's take a look at what factors have contributed to success in fostering research output in regions (and then what did not work)."
