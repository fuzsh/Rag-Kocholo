        "text": "Kiem-Phong Vo, AT&T Labs혰Research\n\nLibraries are integral to software development. Successful libraries arguably achieve the right balance among these software engineering dimensions:\n\n1. requirement, i.e., fulfilling the correct anticipated needs;\n\n2. architecture, i.e., being easily composable with others and evolvable as new requirements surface; and\n\n3. scalability, i.e., using efficient algorithms and providing further means to customize and compose them for performance. This talk relates software engineering lessons learned by the speaker while writing a number of widely used libraries.\n\nGerald (Jerry) Carter, SAMBA Team\n\nGerald Carter has been a member of the SAMBA Team since 1998. He is employed by Hewlett-Packard as a Software Engineer, where he works on Samba-based print appliances and acts as the release coordinator for the SAMBA project. He is currently working on a guide to LDAP for system administrators with O'Reilly Publishing and is the author of \"Teach Yourself Samba in 24 Hours\" for Sams Publishing. Gerald holds a master's degree in computer science from Auburn University, where he was also previously employed as a network and systems administrator.\n\nWilliam A. Arbaugh, University of Maryland, College Park\n\nComputing devices are shrinking while becoming more powerful. At the same time, several forms of wireless networking are experiencing exponential growth. What happens when these two trends converge, and what does it mean for security? This talk will provide a short (and pitiful) history of wireless network security, followed by the speaker's view of the future of wireless network security and what security challenges must be solved before true ubiquitous computing can emerge.\n\nRadia Perlman, Sun Microsystems Laboratories\n\nProblems in network security systems tend not to be subtle mathematical flaws in the cryptography, but instead broader system issues. This talk discusses deployed systems or standards with such flaws. It includes a public-keyxbased system with no advantages over a secret-keyxbased system, one in which encryption was used where what was really needed was integrity protection, one in which adding security decreased the reliability and did nothing to enhance the security of the system, unmanageable or unscalable PKI models, and an email standard that allowed forging signatures.\n\nScott Long, FreeBSD Project\n\nScott's experience with FreeBSD dates back to the fall of 1992, when he discovered 386BSD-0.1. Since obtaining his src commit privileges in 2000, he has contributed to and maintained RAIDframe, the UDF filesystem, and several hardware drivers. In November 2002 he joined the FreeBSD Release Engineering team and quickly assumed the lead for the 5.0 release. He is currently working with the FreeBSD community to define the path for the 5.x series. His day job is as a software engineer for Adaptec, Inc., writing Linux and FreeBSD drivers and doing Open Source evangelism.\n\nPhilip Papadopoulos, San Diego Supercomputer Center\n\nThe Rocks toolkit allows users to stand up small, medium, and large-scale x86 and IA64 clusters in a short period of time. It starts with the assumption that clusters are heterogeneous in both hardware and functionality. Rocks decomposes the configuration of nodes (termed appliances) into small, reusable building blocks that include both software package and configuration information. Using a graph construction, shared configuration information across appliance types can be easily expressed. Utilizing the extensive hardware probing of modern OS installers, heterogeneous nodes become no harder to support than assumed homogeneous nodes. Installation and reinstallation performance figures will be given.\n\nSteve Hotz, New.net\n\nNaming is a fundamental concept for systems architects, a critical decision for marketers, and a requirement for operating networked computers. Quite simply, we care about names. Consequently, it is no surprise that control of the DNS, the primary Internet namespace, is a morass of highly charged technical, financial, legal, and political issues. This talk discusses issues surrounding alternative top-level domains, and the somewhat controversial approach New.net has taken to expanding the operational DNS namespace.\n\nHarry DeLano and Peter H. Salus, Matrix NetSystems\n\nIt's a bird! It's a plane! Look! Up in the sky . . .\n\nIf no one could agree on Superman, no wonder we aren't quite certain what the Internet looks like when it goes home to Smallville and takes off its Clark Kent suit. Thirty years ago, when the ARPAnet had well under 50 hosts, the diagram was easy; 20 years ago, when the number was 400, it could still be mastered. But today there are well over 200 million hosts.\n\nSeveral different approaches are currently being pursued to represent the stucture and population of the Internet, and much of the data is muddled and inconsistent. Thus, part of the challenge is to gather it into a coherent representation of what's out there.\n\nJ. Storrs Hall, Institute for Molecular Manufacturing\n\nDesigning a microprocessor has more in common with programming than it does with designing a steam engine. Similar tools혰specification languages, simulators, rule checkers, profilers혰and a similar level of complexity dominate over the distinction between matter and bits as the output. As nanotechnology advances to the point where we can specify and construct large, atomically precise systems, the same will become true of nanomachine design. This talk will describe such systems and the process of designing them.\n\nDavid Parter, University of Wisconsin, Madison\n\nDavid has been a system administrator at the University of Wisconsin Computer Science Department since 1991, serving as Associate Director of the Computer Systems Lab since 1995, guiding a staff of 8 fulltime sysdamins and supervising up to 12 student sysadmins at a time. His experiences in this capacity include working with other groups on campus; providing technical leadership to the group; managing the budget; dealing with vendors; dealing with faculty; and training students. As a consultant, he has dealt with a variety of technical and management challenges.\n\nWook, Consultant\n\nContemporary feature film visual effects generally require a large digital (CGI혰Computer Generated Imagery) component. The peculiar economics of this sector and how to scale to provide near-real-time response in addition to generating and integrating complex image sets will be discussed. The major infrastructure issues in this talk have to do with networking, multi-terabyte storage, the futility of backup, distributed processing, and asset management. A brief tangent on software for film restoration will be included.\n\nGarry Zacheiss, MIT, and Derrick Brashear, Carnegie Mellon University\n\nGarry Zacheiss has spent four years working for MIT Information Systems doing both development and system administration. As a member of the Athena Server Operations team, he works on maintaining and expanding the AFS cells used by Athena, MIT's Academic Computing Environment.\n\nDerrick Brashear is a systems programmer with the Computing Services division of Carnegie Mellon University and is on the OpenAFS Council of Elders, the guiding body for OpenAFS development. He claims to have his fingers in too many pies."
