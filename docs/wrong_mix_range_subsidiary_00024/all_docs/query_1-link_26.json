        "text": "Linux and Business\n\nAnnouncements from O'Reilly Convention. At this writing the O'Reilly Open Source Convention is in full swing. Now O'Reilly Con isn't one of those big commercial events like Comdex or LinuxWorld where you can see all the latest toys and snappy apps and the press releases swell this section to two or three times normal size. The O'Reilly conference is a place where developers go to talk about new technologies and open source projects. This year's conference, however, has been generating a buzz in the commercial world.\n\nPerhaps it started with the debate between Red Hat CTO Michael Tiemann and Microsoft Senior Vice President Craig Mundie. The topic: \"Shared Source vs. Open Source\". Interesting, no doubt, but most developers have already made up their minds on the topic, and they are not likely to be swayed by any arguments given here. What is more exciting are the open source announcements from Hewlett Packard Company and Sun Microsystems.\n\nHP Labs created cooltown, a developer's community with a \"vision of a technology future where people, places, and things are first class citizens of the connected world, wired and wireless\". The CoolBase open source project, launched at O'Reilly Con, provides the initial set of building blocks for researchers and advanced developers to create cooltown services and environments, and to participate in a community of like-minded experts. So CoolBase isn't really the sort of product usually covered here, but it may well be used to develop those future products that will drive the crowds at Comdex wild. LinuxDevices also has more information on CoolBase.\n\nSun Microsystems first introduced the Sun(TM) Grid Engine software in September 2000. The Sun Grid Engine is a resource management system. It makes systems more productive by putting idle resources to work. The program has always been freely available, but this week Sun announced the release of the source code for the Grid Engine. CollabNet will be helping Sun to manage the code which will be licensed under the Sun Industry Standards Source License.\n\nLPI Announces New President And Director. The Linux Professional Institute (LPI) announced the appointment of Chuck Mead as President and of James Lacey to the LPI Board of Directors. Mead is LPI's second President, replacing Dan York who has held the position since the Institute's inception in 1998. Mead is a co-founder of LPI, the CEO of Moongroup Consulting and former CTO of LinuxMall.com. James Lacey has been involved with LPI since 1999 and is CEO of Bradford Learning, a company formed by the spinoff of Linuxcare University.\n\nA new boss at SuSE. SuSE has announced that Johannes Nussbickel, previously chief financial officer at the company, will be taking the chief executive officer position. Former CEO Roland Dyroff is taking a seat on the board of directors.\n\nSleepycat Releases Berkeley DB version 3.3. Sleepycat Software, Inc. announced Berkeley DB version 3.3, which provides features for high availability and support for the Lineo Embedix embedded Linux operating system.\n\nSair Linux and GNU Newsletter #9.
