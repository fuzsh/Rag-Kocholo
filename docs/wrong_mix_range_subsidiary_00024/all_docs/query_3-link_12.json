        "text": "Well, we find ourselves at the midway point of another year as we are now officially half way through 2009. And like we do each quarter, it is time for us to take a look at the activities within the\n\ndatabase market over the past three months. This past quarter was very active, with acquisitions (including one huge acquisition surrounded by rumors and industry giants), announcements, and more\n\nlayoffs due to the economic downturn, among other “stuff.” So let’s dive right in and see what happened during April, May and June of 2009.\n\nThe Sun Sets on IBM as it Rises on Oracle\n\nThere is no way we can start this edition of The Database Report without beginning our coverage with the colossal acquisition of Sun Microsystems that went\n\ndown this quarter. Over time it became evident that Sun Microsystems – server manufacturer, owner of MySQL and originator of Java – was unlikely to be able to survive and thrive as an\n\nindependent company. Its server sales were lagging behind HP and IBM, and Sun as a company seemed to be confused as to its future direction. Over the past couple of years, industry pundits ruminated\n\nover which companies might be able and, more importantly willing to acquire Sun. This talk heated up considerably early in the second quarter of 2009, with the early favorite being IBM to take over\n\nailing Sun.\n\nIn late March 2009, the Wall Street Journal reported that IBM is in talks to acquire one of its arch-rivals in the server space, Sun\n\nMicrosystems. Now there were a lot of reasons why IBM would be interested in Sun. The server business is obviously Sun’s biggest business, and it would benefit IBM to expand in this area by\n\ntaking out a rival (Sun), growing against a large rival (HP), and positioning against a new entrant (Cisco, more on them in a moment). Additionally, one of Oracle’s largest hardware platforms for\n\ntheir DBMS is Sun, so if IBM acquired Sun it could give them some leverage in dealing with Oracle. Although IBM has a version of DB2 that runs on Sun’s Solaris operating system, it has not been\n\nwidely adopted or implemented. IBM’s Informix DBMS actually has a bigger footprint on Sun than does DB2.\n\nSun has also been busy offering cloud computing and storage offerings, which is something that IBM has not yet aggressively pursued. Acquiring Sun would offer IBM a shortcut into that business.\n\nBut if you look past the server side of the equation, Sun offered some interesting technology, hardware and software that IBM was probably very interested in. A couple years ago Sun bought\n\nStorageTek, and IBM’s very healthy storage business would be happy to add Sun’s storage business. Last year Sun bought MySQL, and IBM’s data management group would be very happy to add the number\n\none open source DBMS to its line of offerings. IBM tried to enter the open source DBMS fray a couple years ago with its Derby/Cloudscape offering, but it has not been very successful. And let’s not\n\nforget than Sun created Java, and IBM would be happy to add that feather to its software cap.\n\nThe bottom line would be the price of the deal: how cheaply can IBM snag Sun? And would there be any other suitors? And what about Cisco entering the server business? Ill-advised, in my opinion.\n\nCisco partners with all of the server providers to sell its networking hardware. Does Cisco really want to take the risk that HP and IBM would get irked at them for competing in the server business\n\n(no matter what the public stance of the companies) and have them more aggressively partner with a Cisco competitor? And even if you look at it from just an internal Cisco perspective, the server\n\nbusiness is a mature market with very large incumbent players. How many Cisco customers would rather have a server from a brand new player (Cisco) rather than an entrenched, solid company like IBM or\n\nHP? Some, perhaps, but I doubt enough to make Cisco a credible player in this market.\n\nBut back to IBM and Sun for a moment: If this acquisition could have been closed, there would have been immediate, loud opposition… most likely with Microsoft and HP leading the chorus saying this\n\nwould be too much of an IBM monopoly in servers and cloud computing. Oracle, too, might join in worried that IBM would boost the capabilities of MySQL so much that it would drive down the price (and\n\nearnings) of Oracle’s DBMS.\n\nAnd antitrust experts predicted that IBM would have a difficult time getting the deal cleared by both the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Union because of the many overlapping product\n\nlines. Problem areas cited by these experts included Sun’s tape-based storage systems (giving IBM a near monopoly in that market) and Unix-based servers (giving IBM about 65% of that $17 billion\n\nmarket according to figures from market research firm IDC).\n\nIt would have been interesting to watch. But it never happened. The reported price tag for IBM to buy Sun was $6.5 billion. That sounds like a nice price for IBM given all they stood to gain. But not\n\nall parties could agree on that price tag.\n\nIn early April, the talks between IBM and Sun broke down as Sun’s board rejected a formal offer from IBM to acquire Sun, which then led IBM to withdraw its offer. But rumors still swirled that\n\nsomething might yet happen between IBM and Sun. When the news broke that the deal was off, Sun shares sunk by $1.90 the next day, off 22% to $6.59 a share.\n\nEvidently Sun’s board was split over whether to approve the deal or not. News leaked that Sun’s chairman and co-founder, Scott McNealy, opposed the deal, whereas Chief Executive Officer Jonathan\n\nSchwartz favored the deal. And it was also leaked that price was not the overriding factor that killed the deal. It seems that the group siding with McNealy felt that IBM had too much leeway to walk\n\naway from the deal.\n\nAround the same time as the IBM deal died, news started circulating that Oracle and Hewlett-Packard might have made a joint offer to acquire Sun Microsystems. Evidently Oracle would have snagged\n\nSun’s software portfolio for $2 billion, and HP would acquire the hardware business. So even as one deal died, the rumor mill kept swirling… and, as it turned out, rightly so!\n\nBut then things got quiet for a couple of days. And just when it seemed like nobody was interested in acquiring Sun after the IBM deal fell through, Oracle started singing “Here Comes the\n\nSun” and swooped in with a bigger offer on April 20th. The price for Sun? $9.50 per share, or approximately $7.4 billion.\n\nAlthough an IBM acquisition of Sun probably made more sense, there are definite positives for the Oracle deal. Both Oracle and Sun sell mostly to larger enterprises. Many of Sun’s servers run\n\nOracle software – both the DBMS and the applications. By adding Sun hardware to the mix, Oracle can now offer completely integrated systems – including server, storage, OS, DBMS,\n\nmiddleware and applications – without having to involve any other vendor. In point of fact, Larry Ellison highlighted this very notion saying, “Oracle will be the only company that can\n\nengineer an integrated system – from applications to disk – where all the pieces fit and work together so customers do not have to do it themselves.” Not even IBM can claim that.\n\nWhat else does Oracle get by acquiring Sun? Well, it gets a huge piece of the open source DBMS market by adding MySQL to its DBMS portfolio. Remember way back in the fourth quarter of 2005? That is\n\nwhen Oracle acquired Innobase. Innobase was the maker of InnoDB, an add-on storage engine for MySQL. InnoDB is distributed under the GNU GPL open-source license. InnoDB is one of several storage\n\nengines used by MySQL for handling more complex transaction processing requirements. Now Oracle “controls” both Innobase and MySQL.\n\nOracle also later acquired Sleepycat Software another provider of open source DBMS software. Berkeley DB is the open source, embedded database software offering of Sleepycat Software. Berkeley DB is\n\npervasive in the open source world as it is embedded in several popular open source products including Apache web server and the OpenOffice productivity suite, among others. Oh, and by the way, with\n\nthe acquisition of Sun, OpenOffice is now under Oracle’s purview. So we see Oracle becoming not just the biggest DBMS software provider on the planet (open source or otherwise), but also\n\nexpanding its open source coverage.\n\nStill on the DBMS area for a moment, it will be interesting to see what steps Oracle takes to bolster its “database machine” strategy. Late last year Oracle announced the Oracle Database\n\nMachine, touted as the world’s fastest database machine. It boasts eight Oracle Database servers on 64 Intel processor cores running Oracle Enterprise Linux and Oracle Real Application Clusters. In\n\nthe first quarter, Oracle sold its first Oracle Database Machine. Will Oracle adapt or augment that strategy with its newly acquired Sun Solaris hardware? I don’t know why they\n\nwouldn’t.\n\nCloud computing is another interesting area to analyze here. Sun has some nice cloud computing and virtualization technologies that Oracle now owns. So Oracle could become a leading provider of cloud\n\ncomputing offerings with this acquisition.\n\nBy acquiring Sun, Oracle also stops IBM from acquiring the company. Stopping a competitor is not usually the most compelling reason to acquire a company; but when there are as many synergies as this\n\none for Oracle, throwing up that roadblock for IBM must only have been viewed as additional gravy when they made the decision to pull the trigger.\n\nAnd, indeed, this acquisition is very disruptive to the market, for a number of reasons. One fails to see how Oracle won’t take advantage of Open Office and Star Office (the productivity suites\n\nit gains from Sun) to throw a wedge into Microsoft’s best selling Office productivity suite. Java developers will be wondering just what the heck Oracle will do now that it controls the Java\n\nreigns. The non-IBM server big boys, HP and Dell, have got to be re-evaluating their long-term plans for partnering with Oracle.\n\nWhat are the risks for Oracle in acquiring Sun? Oh, there are some. Oracle has no experience with hardware, but hardware and related sales account for 80% of Sun’s revenues. Oracle can mitigate\n\nthis risk by leveraging the experienced folks it acquires from Sun. And Oracle has always been savvy about adding executives with skills it lacks when it needs to. Oracle also must contend with the\n\ndeteriorating market share for Sun servers if it wishes to halt the erosion.\n\nAnother point of consideration is what will happen to Oracle’s relationship with HP. I’m sure the acquisition of Sun will strain that relationship, perhaps considerably. But both\n\ncompanies will want the relationship to continue. Oracle has for years sold itself as a DBMS that works across all types of heterogeneous hardware. And HP really has nowhere else to go for database\n\nmarket share.\n\nAnd what of the relationship between SAP and Sun? Oh, that is dead, dead, dead!\n\nThe deal is quite costly – one of the biggest Oracle has taken on. But as Oracle points out in the press release, when Sun’s cash assets are taken into account, the deal is valued at $5.6\n\nbillion. Oracle expects Sun to add at least 15 cents to its income on a non-GAAP basis in the first full year after closing, and $1.5 billion to its non-GAAP operating profit… and $2 billion\n\nin the second year. Even though Oracle is confident it can achieve these goals, actually doing so may prove to be difficult. Some analysts estimate that Oracle may need to cut up to 10,000 former Sun\n\nemployees (from a staff of 30,000) to make its profit targets. But how can Oracle do that and maintain the hardware expertise it needs to maintain Sun’s primary business?\n\nSo what will happen next? Well, Oracle could be on the lookout to bolster its services offerings if it is truly looking to become the next IBM; Microsoft will probably start to eyeball some\n\nenterprise hardware and software companies (Cisco? EMC?); and HP and Dell will scurry around looking for ways to replace Oracle as a partner. I bet that Dell will try to marry itself closer to\n\nMicrosoft.\n\nOracle has now acquired 55 companies since 2005, and Sun Microsystems is the biggest. But Oracle’s users are intrigued. “The Sun acquisition is very exciting news for Oracle users,”\n\nsaid Ian Abramson, president of the International Oracle User Group. I doubt that Sun’s customers are as “excited,” though.\n\nOne thing is for sure, the rest of this year could get very interesting indeed!\n\nOh, There Were Other Acquisitions in the Second Quarter, Too!\n\nIBM did make an acquisition in the second quarter though, just not one the size of the Oracle/Sun deal. In early May, IBM announced that it had acquired Exeros, a private company that produces\n\nExeros Discovery X-Profiler. Financial details were not disclosed.\n\nThe Exeros technology helps organizations uncover hidden relationships between databases, helping users make sense of disparate data sources much faster than otherwise possible. The capabilities\n\nprovided by Exeros seem to match up well with IBM’s recent spate of acquisition in the data management space. Look for IBM to integrate Exeros into its Optim product line.\n\nIBM claims that the acquisition of Exeros will further IBM’s Information on Demand initiative, which is aimed at enabling customers to use information as a competitive and strategic business asset.\n\nAmbuj Goyal, general manager of IBM’s Information Management groups stated that “(t)he combination of IBM and Exeros will enable companies to more intelligently manage their data across\n\nall formats and computing platforms, creating a smarter enterprise.” For more information about Information on Demand and IBM Information Management, click here.\n\nIncidentally, Exeros Discovery X-Profiler is the product upon which CA’s ERwin Data Profiler is based. It will be interesting to see what happens to the CA offering as I’m guessing it will be\n\nunlikely that IBM will want to continue that relationship.\n\nAnd Oracle was not content to simply acquire Sun Microsystems, they announced yet another acquisition this past quarter, too. In mid-May the company acquired Virtual Iron Software, Inc., a provider\n\nof server virtualization management software that enables dynamic resource and capacity management in virtualized data centers.\n\nVirtualization management looms as one of the next big frontiers for server virtualization vendors. “Industry trends are driving demand for virtualization as a way to reduce operating expenses\n\nand support green IT strategies without sacrificing quality of service,” said Wim Coekaerts, Oracle Vice President of Linux and Virtualization Engineering. “With the addition of Virtual\n\nIron, Oracle expects to enable customers to more dynamically manage their server capacity and optimize their power consumption.”\n\nThe combination of Oracle and Virtual Iron supports Oracle’s strategy to provide complete, full stack management across the virtual and physical enterprise and should help to provide customers\n\nwith comprehensive and dynamic virtualization management. Oracle intends the combined suite of products (Oracle’s VM coupled with Virtual Iron software) to simplify the deployment and\n\nconfiguration of physical servers, virtual machines, and applications while providing a highly available platform for hosting Oracle software and other enterprise applications.\n\nOracle also specified that it intends to combine Virtual Iron technology with Oracle Enterprise Manager to enable customers to be more agile in meeting application service levels for virtual\n\nenvironments.\n\nAnd Yet the Layoffs Continue…\n\nRegular readers of this column will recall the biggest DBMS news of the first quarter was the economy and its impact on the database software sector. Oracle, IBM and Microsoft all announced\n\nlayoffs in the first quarter. And the economic impact – most notably, more jobs being cut – continued in the second quarter of 2009.\n\nEarly in the quarter, details of internal IBM documents outlining layoffs were leaked. And the news was grim, at least if you were an IBM employee. Those internal documents indicated that IBM would\n\nbe eliminating more than a thousand positions (1,674 cuts) in its Global Business Services unit alone.\n\nInformation Week reported, “In an effort to rebalance skills, eliminate redundancies, and deliver greater economic efficiencies, IBM Global Business Services is announcing a resource action\n\naffecting U.S. employees in Application Services,” says an IBM document dated March 26, 2009. Don’t you just love the term “resource action?” No? Neither do I! I can understand\n\nthat a company might have to lay people off, but at least treat them like humans and call it what it is – a layoff, not a “resource action.”\n\nEvidently those resources impacted by this action are eligible to receive one week of pay for each six months worked, but\n\nnot more than 26 weeks. The company will also offer some healthcare and retraining benefits. Of course, axed employees will have to sign away their rights to sue the company. But that is standard\n\noperating procedure for most layoffs when a severance package is offered.\n\nNot everyone sees these layoffs merely as a reaction to the current economic conditions, though. Alliance@IBM, an IBM employee group, believes that IBM is eliminating U.S. jobs and moving the same\n\njobs to low-cost overseas locations, such as India. There was also a political reaction to IBM’s “resource action” and Alliance@IBM’s allegations. New York State Assembly\n\nmember Greg Ball, a Republican whose district includes IBM’s home county of Westchester, questioned how a company that receives taxpayer assistance can cut employees and move jobs overseas. Ball\n\ncalled for a legislative hearing into the matter.\n\nIn July 2008, New York said that it would provide $140 million in grants to IBM, which in turn was investing $1.5 billion to create 1,000 new jobs in nanotechnology. The agreement also included $65\n\nmillion in provisions to help IBM retain jobs at its East Fishkill plant in Dutchess County, an area also represented by Ball.\n\nOf course, IBM was not the only company “in the news” this quarter for laying folks off. In early May, Microsoft continued with the job elimination it announced in the first quarter. The\n\ncompany cut over a thousand positions (1,200 cuts), mostly at its headquarters in Redmond, WA.\n\nRemember that in January 2009, Microsoft indicated that it would cut as many as 5,000 jobs by June 2010. About 1,400 jobs were cut worldwide in January. More interestingly, perhaps, is the memo sent\n\nby Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer to Microsoft employees on May 5th letting them know about the latest round of layoffs. The full text of the email can be read online at:http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2009/01/steve_ballmers.html.\n\nSo it looks like there will be more layoffs at Microsoft. At least that is what I would take away from this email if I were a Microsoft employee reading it at my desk. How about you?\n\nHow About Revenue at the Big Three?\n\nNow, as we do each quarter, let’s turn our attention to the revenue announcements of the Big Three: Oracle, IBM and Microsoft.\n\nIn late March, Oracle announced its fiscal third quarter numbers, and they were not too bad given the current economic climate. The company reported a 1% decline in net income to $1.32 billion,\n\ncompared to $1.34 billion in the year-ago quarter. Revenue was up 2% to $5.45 billion. The decline was attributed to declining value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar.\n\nOracle’s operating income during the quarter came in at $1.94 billion, up 4%. And software revenue grew 5% to $4.4 billion, but new software license revenue was down 6% to $1.5 billion;\n\nsoftware license updates and support revenue was up 11% to $2.91 billion. And quarterly revenue from services dropped 8% to $1.02 billion, down from $1.1 billion from the same quarter last\n\nyear.\n\nOracle president Charles Phillips said: “If you look past the effect of exchange rates, our new software license revenues for this quarter were higher than our new software license revenues for Q3\n\nof last year. Achieving constant currency growth in new software license sales in this very challenging economy shows that we continue to beat our competitors in both technology and\n\napplications.”\n\nAnd Oracle announced it would pay out its very first dividend, which is interesting since the recession has caused many organizations to eliminate dividends. Oracle will pay five cents per share,\n\nstarting in May 2009; this will cost the company about $1 billion per year.\n\nThe news at Microsoft was not nearly as “good,” where the company reported its worst third quarter earnings ever in late April. Revenues came in at $13.65 billion for the third quarter\n\nended March 31, 2009, which is a 6% decline from the same period last year. Operating income was $4.44 billion, an increase of 3%; net income was $2.98 billion, which is a drop of 32%; and, diluted\n\nearnings per share for the quarter were $0.33 per share, which represented a decline of 30% (all compared with same period last period). This is quite a change from the third quarter of 2008 in which\n\nMicrosoft touted its “record third quarter revenue.”\n\nThis was Microsoft’s first ever year over year quarterly sales drop. Bad news, but actually quite impressive given that Microsoft has been publicly traded for 23 years! And keep in mind that\n\nthe financial results for the quarter included $290 million of severance charges related to Microsoft’s plan to eliminate up to 5,000 jobs. It also reflects $420 million of investment losses.\n\nThese two charges reduced earnings per 6 cents per share.\n\n“While market conditions remained weak during the quarter, I was pleased with the organization’s ability to offset revenue pressures with the swift implementation of cost-savings\n\ninitiatives,” said Chris Liddell, chief financial officer at Microsoft. And the company also provided updated guidance for operating expenses ranging from $26.7 billion to $26.9 billion,\n\nincluding severance charges, for the full year ending June 30, 2009.\n\nIn late April, IBM reported its fiscal first quarter earnings, which were basically flat, but reasonable in this economy. IBM reported diluted earnings of $1.70 per share compared with $1.64 per\n\nshare in the first quarter of 2008, which is an increase of 4%. But first quarter net income was $2.30 billion compared with $2.32 billion in the same quarter last year, which is a decrease of 1%.\n\nTotal revenues for the first quarter of 2009 came in at $21.7 billion, a decrease of 11% from the first quarter of 2008.\n\n“IBM continued to perform well in a very difficult economic environment. This was due to our long-term strategic focus: shifting into software and services, divesting of commodity businesses,\n\nand creating solutions that help clients reduce cost and conserve capital. At the same time, we have a disciplined approach to cost and expense management giving us a strong financial position,”\n\nsaid IBM chairman, president and chief executive officer, Sam Palmisano.\n\nIBM indicated that it is ahead of pace for its 2010 road map of $10 to $11 per share, and that it expects full year 2009 earnings of at least $9.20 per share.\n\nGiven the state of the economy then, it appears as if the Big Three DBMS vendors are performing reasonably well… or, at least, things could be a lot worse!\n\nWhat’s New Brewing with DB2?\n\nThis quarter also saw the announcement of a new point release of DB2 – Version 9.7 – from IBM. The announcement of DB2 9.7, also known by the code name Cobra, was made in late April\n\nand it offers some interesting new functionality.\n\nProbably at the top of the new features list are the workload management capabilities. Among the new workload management features in DB2 9.7 is the ability to set different priorities for different\n\ntypes of applications. DB2 users will also get the ability to set with conditional workloads so that can applications can change when a workload threshold is exceeded. Mainframe users will recognize\n\nthese capabilities because they’ve been available there for years with Workload Manager, but they are new to the Linux, Unix and Windows world. The bottom line is that DB2’s workload\n\nmanagement features can improve the performance of mission critical applications by better balancing system workload.\n\nAdditionally, IBM is claiming that improved autonomics and system administration capabilities can help DBAs better manage their growing data, leading to a reduction in the time it takes to complete\n\nadministrative tasks by up to 35%.\n\nA particularly interesting new capability built into DB2 9.7 is its ability to simplify the migration of data from other DBMS platforms (well, Oracle mostly) to DB2. What IBM did here is license\n\ntechnology from EnterpriseDB, the open source database vendor that makes its living off of mimicking Oracle. The capabilities in this licensed technology enable customers to run applications written\n\nfor Oracle Database even though they are using DB2 9.7.\n\nOther new features include new user interface that simplifies administrative tasks, new technology for analyzing XML data, more effective data compression, more online schema operations, support for\n\nweak data typing, new data types, new built-in functions, lots of SQL enhancements and more.\n\nAt the same time, IBM also announced a new release of its InfoSphere data warehousing technology. Both DB2 9.7 and the new release of InfoSphere were supposed to be generally available by the end of\n\nJune (which will be in the past when you read this, but is in the future as I type this)!\n\nThe IBM press release announcing DB2 9.7 is available online at: http://www.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/27279.wss.\n\nMicrosoft SQL Server 2008 Service Pack SP1\n\nAnd IBM was not the only DBMS provider with a new “release” this quarter. In early April Microsoft unleashed the SP1 service pack which rolls up all the fixes since the initial\n\nlaunch of SQL Server 2008.\n\nOf course, this announcement was not as significant as the DB2 9.7 announcement, but it has the benefit of actually being released this quarter. And it could have a big impact on the uptake of SQL\n\nServer 2008. Many SQL Server 2000 and 2005 shops have been waiting for SP1 before upgrading to SQL Server 2008.\n\nOther than the rollup of fixes, SP1 also introduces at least one new feature called Slipstream, which should make it easier to deploy SQL Server 2008. Slipstream enables users to install the DBMS and\n\nthe service pack all at once.\n\nThis approach is basically a new one for Microsoft – delivering a service pack that consists almost exclusively of fixes, instead of a combination of fixes and new functionality. Microsoft is\n\nhoping that this approach will deliver a more stable environment which will lure users to upgrade. Finally! In my opinion, new functionality should be delivered in new releases, not fix packs.\n\nAmazon Cloud Database\n\nIn early April, Amazon announced its new cloud database offering. Amazon Web Services is probably the biggest player in the cloud computing market. Most of Amazon’s cloud business is for\n\nits S3 storage service S3 and its EC2 computing power as a service offerings. Prior to April, Amazon also had a cloud-based database offering called SimpleDB. SimpleDB is a key-value pair database\n\nthat targets web developers who don’t need or want a relational database.\n\nThe new hosted service from Amazon is designed to simplify the use of the Hadoop implementation of the MapReduce programming model for processing large data sets in processor clusters. The offering\n\nis called Amazon Elastic MapReduce, and it is aimed at developers whose applications need to process very large amounts of data.\n\nAmazon’s new cloud database offering is a relational DBMS deployment delivered in partnership with IBM. As with other Amazon Web Services cloud offerings, Amazon charges for Elastic MapReduce\n\nbased on usage, without requiring any minimum fee.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether database implementations will grow and prosper in the cloud; but if they do, Amazon appears to be ideally suited to benefit. So this looks like a good move to me.\n\nThe Open Database Alliance\n\nAnd in mid May, in a move not un-entirely unrelated to Oracle’s acquisition of Sun Microsystems, Monty Program Ab, a MySQL database engineering company, and Percona, a MySQL services and\n\nsupport firm, announced “The Open Database Alliance.” Monty Program Ab was founded by Monty Widenius, the originator of the MySQL DBMS.\n\nThe alliance is promoted as a vendor-neutral consortium designed to become the industry hub for the MySQL open source DBMS. The alliance hopes to promote MySQL and derivative code, binaries,\n\ntraining, support and other enhancements for the MySQL community.\n\nThe Open Database Alliance will work cooperatively to provide software, support and services for MariaDB, a community-developed branch of MySQL. More information about the alliance can be found on\n\nthe web at opendatabasealliance.com."
