        "text": "Image courtesy of wikimedia.org\n\nVerônica Ferriani was born on February 7, 1978 in the inner city of Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo.\n\nHis first professional season was held at Traço de União, an important stronghold of samba in São Paulo, opening and acting as master of ceremonies at shows featuring the likes of Monarco, Nelson Sargento, Riachão, Wilson Moreira, Wilson das Neves, Tia Surica, Billy Blanco, and others.\n\nShe began singing in 2004 after graduating from the Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism of USP earning a degree in Architecture, at the invitation of composer and guitarist Chico Saraiva, winner of the Visa Award the year prior.\n\nHe recorded the music for Som Brasil, a program that aired on TV Globo in 2007. Ironically, the show aired before his CD was released. Verônica also teamed up with Gafieira São Paulo and later on managed to network with other fellow samba players looking to make a mark of their own such as Fabiana Cozza, Roberta Sá, Moyseis Marques, to name a few. In 2011, the group was winner of the Brazilian Music Award in the Best Group of Samba. Saraiva shared the stage with an array of artists including Francis Hime, Beth Carvalho, Jair Rodrigues, Martinho da Vila, Tom Zé, Élton Medeiros, Moacyr Luz, Mart’nália, Moska, and Criolo, among others.\n\nHis debut album was released in 2009. Later that year, another album titled Sobre Palavras (translated meaning “About Words)”, of which the website peoplepill.com mentioned that the album was, “in partnership with the composer and guitarist Chico Saraiva, of unpublished compositions of him with the lyricist Mauro Aguiar, recorded as an Award by the Pixinguinha Project (Funarte, 2008/2009). The album gave Verônica the Catavento Award, from Radio Cultura, in the best singer category.”\n\nAn authorial album came out in 2013, with a rather long title “Because the mouth speaks of what the heart is full.”\n\nFollowing Veronica’s debut album in 2009, she produced more work in 2013 and 2018 (which included an Ao Vivo performance). A pair of albums were released in 2022 before the album I am reviewing, which translated means “Whispering In The silence Becomes Noise, Irma.”\n\nThe album is split into two, the first one with 10 tracks and the second with 11. Several of the tracks feature playful melodies and a few commerical teasers are included on the first disk. One of them sounds like a lullaby with two ladies (presumably one of Veronica’s friends) giggly uncontrollably.\n\nOverall, this dual set of disks is great for entertaining or just relaxing on a lazy Sunday afternoon (of which in the United States have not had the pleasure of for over a month, considering how divided everything is right now.) Every song was just the right blend of typical sounds you would hear at a small party or just driving around seeing the sand on either side of your car.\n\nIf I had to choose a few tracks that are worth listening to are the title track leading off and Track 7 on the first disk, “Foto Linda” (the first word translating to “Photograph.”\n\nFor those looking for the physical CD’s, Amazon only has her self-titled debut. Otherwise, you are resorted to looking to second-hand websites where maybe just maybe you could find that one hidden gem.\n\nWith her entire discography available to stream on Spotify and Apple Music, it is definitely worth an addition to your Brazilian jazz library.\n\nEnjoy the rest of the Paris Olympics, and cheer on both Team USA and Brasil/Brazil to see how many medals they would take home before the next Summer Olympics in 2028 at the hometown of some of my former jazz subjects from a decade ago that call Los Angeles home.\n\nSee you again next month.\n\nReleased on May 14, the translation of Tiago’s latest album is “Before The World Ends.”\n\nI prefer instead to think of it as a new beginning. A endless amount of positivity and fun. If you noticed the album cover image of nothing but clear, blue water going on for miles and miles (kilometers for those reading in Brazil)–you couldn’t help think of this as simple coffeehouse music on any typical Sunday morning.\n\nIt is light enough not to interfere with any chores you might be doing around the house, but not as bubbly as the entire discography of Sergio Mendes and his many groups from the 1960’s through the 1980’s.\n\nFiguring the way our world has been going since the guy who was recently convicted on 34 counts in the hush money trial prior to the 2016 United States Presidential election, this album is an excellent sense of relief. Call it as a much needed release from the garbage (I’m referring to most of the hate and espeically the trolls on X, the siter formerly known as Twitter) we as Americans and practically most of the world all have to put up with on a daily basis.\n\nSeveral songs definitely qualify as put up your feet and read a good book on your Kindle/Nook device. Track 2, “Besame, Esqueca-Me” (translated meaning “Besame, Forget Me” was a nice duet with Julia Mestre. If you are into kids chanting, then the closing seconds of track 4 is for you–“Crianças Crescidas” (translated meaning “Grown Up Children”.\n\nThe one song that picked up the pace was Track 7, “Suave Suave”. Without digging too deep into the lyrics, it provides plenty of refreshing vibes and good flow without taking you off guard.\n\nThe other song I really enjoyed was Track 10 (the one following the beautiful ballad featuring one of today’s top Brazilian pop stars in Anitta), “Tudo Volta Ao Que Era” (translated meaning, “Everything Goes Back To The Way It Was.”\n\nIt can mean so many things. The most obvious is what I usually think of as having a series of commas in this complex journey called life.\n\nThe obvious ones are walking your first steps as a baby, learning to count, putting words together to form sentences, graduating grade school, high school (hopefully college as well), finding that significant other, maybe having children of your own, and getting that well earned job promotion.\n\nIt could mean anything you want it to be.\n\nHere are some of my proudest accomplishments in the first half century of being on this planet Earth:\n\nAble to count to 100 by age three,\n\nDeciphering a baseball box score by age six,\n\nUnderstood the basic ins and outs of the stock market by age seven,\n\nWon spelling bee contest in both fifth and sixth grade,\n\nOnce reached honor roll during junior year in high school,\n\nSports writer during senior year in high school newspaper,\n\nWorked at small town radio station for over a year covering high school and professional sports\n\nFive trips to the Dean’s List, five other times came close during college,\n\nWrote sports in school newspaper final three years in college,\n\nSpent one summer as self-employed tutor helping high school students and adults in three different subjects,\n\nWas one of four hired in 100 job applicants working for a labor law publishing company,\n\nSeven years later, began blogging on a periodic basis on Myspace,\n\nBegan running my own small business by age 34,\n\nEight years later, discovered WordPress and began publishing blogs about Brazilian jazz and ten months later covering men’s college basketball,\n\nBy late 2010’s, began journey into doing podcasts. One awkward experience using equipment and two successful platforms later, several nations around the world are discovering and liking what I have to say,\n\n…To be continued,\n\nObviously, we know what would happen if you put a period at the end\n\nWith all that said, I will be back sometime in July with another cool review.\n\nHope to see you then.\n\nImages courtesy of G1.globo–glbimg.com\n\nThroughout his storied career, Dori Caymmi has been a producer and arranger for big artists during the 1960’s such as Edu Lobo, Eumir Deodato, and Nara Leão and as a composer with Nelson Motta.\n\nOn his Wikipedia page, it mentioned that he was a guitarist and arranger for Paul Winter’s band. He also went on tour to get his first taste of playing in the U.S.\n\nIt went on to say:\n\n“He arranged albums by Caetano Veloso, Gal Costa, and Gilberto Gil. He was involved with musicians associated with the tropicalia movement of the late 1960s but did not record in this style because he disliked pop music. During the 1970s and ’80s, he composed TV and movie soundtracks, including Crônica da Casa Assassinada (1971), which wrote with Antonio Carlos Jobim. In 1989, he moved to Los Angeles, California.”\n\nHe also was nominated for numerous Latin Grammy Awards, most notably on his 2013 album Caymmi, with siblings Nana Caymmi and Danilo, was nominated for the 2014 Latin Grammy Award for Best MPB Album but lost to a former subject of this blog Marisa Monte with her album Verdade, Uma Ilusão.\n\nThe album review here was released on April 12 on streaming services. It has a bit of a mariachi vibe, considering this blog was published on May 5–Cinco de Mayo (and for some this day is also Greek Easter, so happy times indeed for those who celebrate considering the fragile state of our world.)\n\nEach song has a nice ebb and flow to it, and is great for being in a very calm state. I especially recommend if you have had a nervous, anxious time in whatever is going on in your life and while your heartbeat hopefully goes down to mostly normal levels, the duet sounds of MP84, Joyce Moreno, Renato Braz, and Monica Salmaso sprinkled throughout should pique your curiosity after a few listens. It is another excellent addition to any jazz library, along with his other work spanning over six decades dating back to 1960.\n\nEven better, this album clocks in at 34 minutes, 28 seconds–or 7 minutes and 11 seconds more than Jessica Pratt’s soothing, suave indie pop album Here In The Pitch, which was released this past Friday (May 3.)\n\n*********************************************************************************\n\nSomething huge happened in Rio on Saturday night\n\nPop star extraordinaire in Madonna played her biggest show in wrapping up her extensive “Celebration” world tour\n\nThe Reuters news agency reported on Saturday that this free concert had “The sand and oceanfront boulevard around Rio de Janeiro’s famed (Copacabana) beach were filled for several blocks by a crowd the city estimated at 1.6 million (people.)\n\nMany had been there for hours or even days to get a good spot, while richer fans anchored in dozens of boats near the beach and onlookers crowded beachfront apartments.”\n\nTemperatures ranged in the evening from the upper 20’s to around 30 Celsius/81 to 86 Farenheit–similar temperature range you would find at Chicago’s world famous Lollapalooza each August.\n\nNME, the popular indie music website in Great Britain had an excellent account of the festivities–which included a bunch of X/Tweets and some awesome YouTube videos of Madonna performing a few of her biggest hits during the 1980’s:\n\nhttps://www.nme.com/news/music/madonna-plays-biggest-show-of-career-to-1-6million-people-in-brazil-3753562\n\nPlease stay safe if you are walking near any college campus considering the state of our world. Otherwise, I will see you again in June with another cool album review. Take care.\n\nCover image courtesy of grandvision.org\n\nBorn in the southern end of Brazil to an Italian family that was in the shoemaking business. For the unitiated, it requires very intense work–from using sewing machines, cutting machines, skiving machines, lasting machines, and finishing machines (not to mention various types of glue to make the soles firm.)\n\nShe grew up immersed in the family business, with her father owning a manufacturer of all things shoe soles. Get this, even the whole town was involved. Similar to those who spend most, if not all their working hours in working their craft does not lead to much in terms of having a social life.\n\nEventually, she grew tired of the business and decided to break out on her own. In a 2018 interview with Voyage LA, she thought that there were bigger things in life that would be awaiting her, even though she was happily married and carried a steady paycheck.\n\n“I basically did not know who I was without that mask I had been putting on for so long. All I know I couldn’t keep going on with that reality.\n\nSo I gathered the courage to quit my job, I sold everything I had and left that stage. I wasn’t going to play that role anymore. I needed a fresh start. I needed a clean slate. So I moved to LA, which was where I had gone to school, and I took the chance to write my own story.”\n\nThat led to a 4 credit course on being a member of a local choir. She was good at it, but needed more. Learning about music theory and getting along with other similar minded people brought her to realize a newer chapter in her life, a longing to stick it out when times are rough.\n\nEven when that university cut the funds for the choir was crushing. The stress was unbearable, so she decided to leave her friends and family and moved to Los Angeles hoping to make it on her own.\n\nShe then mentions in the same interview how difficult that path was to achieving her true dreams in becoming a full-time singer:\n\n“After a couple of weeks of hiatus, I started to miss the choir. I missed having that time for myself. It was then that I realized that, whenever I was singing, I didn’t feel like anything was missing, I felt whole. And then I thought, maybe that’s what I’m supposed to be doing. I was only used to sing in the choir, I had never sung publicly by myself. But again, this was a moment of reinventing myself, so it really didn’t matter what I had done or had not done before. What mattered was what I was gonna do, from then on, so I went for it.”\n\nWhatever Caro decided to do, that difficult time has shaped her to be more confident and believing in herself that great things can happen if you put in the time and the effort, no matter what job or pursuit you are trying to achieve.\n\nAnd how did she latch on to finding some albums beyond the classics? It wasn’t with eBay or Amazon.\n\nNot even one of the great online sites with Connect Brazil.\n\nOf all places, it was Craigslist was her first true discovery.\n\nShe then hooked up with Antonio Cruz and a few other similar minded people. He worked for a bank, so it wasn’t much of an issue regarding financing. All Caro had to do was come up with songs, for fun. Once they recruited a drummer and a bassist, gigs at House of Blues, The Mint, the upstairs room at The Roxy followed.\n\nIt all led to her first album in 2013 under the band named Marbella, titled Volta ao Mundo. Cruz then departed a few years to finish his Master’s degree and then she met Grecco Buratto, another Latin Grammy nominated producer, that encouraged her to start writing by herself. She is embracing doing live music, but her main emphasis is adding Brazilian rhythms to cover songs along with originals that became her signature talent.\n\nShe produced her first album in 2020 during the pandemic Em Portugues.\n\nHer latest album for this month’s review Sambalismo (briefly translated to sambalism) that was released on May 26, 2023 is a refreshing listen. Similar to many albums I have profiled in this blog before, it provides excellent background listening at a party, if you are shopping at a farmer’s market in the warmer weather months, or feel like taking off your shoes/heels after a hard day at work.\n\nAll of her songs are in Portuguese, and there are plenty of fun songs to sink your teeth into. I like Track 2 “Mal Acostumado”, and especially Track 4 “Nesse Jogo.”\n\nIn an interview with Scott Adams of connectbrazil.com, there are some unique stories behind the songs:\n\n“The common thread of the album are the rhythms derived from the Samba root.”\n\n“‘Mal Acostumado’ came as a little song I’d sing to my beloved dog, Max,” she explained. He passed away in 2020 after 13 years of a long, great life. I don’t have kids, so Max was well-loved. That is where “mal acostumado” – spoiled – comes from! I used to sing just the first part of the song to him all the time! When it came time to choose the songs for Sambalismo, we thought it would be a great idea to include his song as an homage. Then we dressed it in the Samba beat. That’s a great way to remember Max.”\n\nWhat a nice tribute who really got into the music for her four-legged friend.\n\nSadly, her dad died in 2021 due to COVID. But she has gained a deeper appreciation, because he led the effort to bring her to the United States, similar to many other countless artists before and certainly after her.\n\nAnother song that is poignant in nature, similar to what I was going through in 2010 with Patricia Talem penning a song on her album “Olhos” to my late grandmother is a nice tribute to her father:\n\n“‘Sei La’ is a realization of how good it is to be able to remember all the moments we had together. And of how once one is gone, the love we felt for each other remains. All the judgments just disappear. So, ‘Sei La’ is a celebration of that too.”\n\nAnother one of life’s lessons is that we need to treasure those that are closest to us, and appreciate the little things in life.\n\nBecause we all know precious and fragile life can be.\n\nMike Greenberg of ESPN Radio in 2010 mentioned in a 4 CD set with fellow Radio Hall of Famer Mike Golic, Sr. on “Rules and Sports And Life” that life has a series of commas.\n\nThink of it as links on a chain. Every major life moment, you add a comma–like when you graduate, get that promotion at your job, get married, have kids, achieve something noteworthy in your community, etc.\n\nBut the period is what we hope not to do until we get beyond retirement age. That is the hope of many of us, myself included.\n\nWithout digging too deep into my past.\n\nSports Editor senior year in high school, three year Sports Editor for campus newspaper in college, 18 months as assistant producer for local radio station covering about 2 dozen high school football and men’s basketball games, self-employed tutor, phone representative specializing in labor law books and monthly newsletters, working for myself, doing blogs in Brazilian jazz and men’s basketball, meeting lots of great friends online, hoping to find a woman that I can call my own…\n\n…To Be Continued next month with another cool blog.\n\nThanks again for reading, as we are 125 days before the first NFL football game takes place on Brazilian soil with an NFC matchup featuring two traditional powers with Green Bay as the visitors taking on the Philadelphia Eagles–who are giving up a home game at Lincoln Financial Field and their crazy fanbase to play the first football game on the South American continent. The simple reason why, this is all because of the NFL hoping to become a true global power (but I am sure a lot of futbol/soccer fans will say otherwise.)\n\nSee you in May.\n\nImage courtesy of apple.com\n\nIn all of my years doing Brazilian jazz, this is the first time that I was unable to find a basic bio of this fine artist. Instead, Google led me to several links that features an adult film star. (Really gross, don’t you think?)\n\nAfter all, since this is a family type blog–what I can tell you is that his rookie album titled Depois de Ipanema (translated meaning “After Ipanema”) was released on December 27, 2023, and it is a really awesome hidden gem.\n\nAfter spending the first track mostly talking similar to Lisa Stansfield in the opening 30 seconds from her memorable 1989 single “All Around The World”, the album pivots the listener from Tracks 2 to 8 as if you were traveling me back to the 1990’s. The cool sounds of the saxophone provided by artists ranging from Steve Cole to Steve Lorber and Jessy J of California provided lots of cool vibes to my ears–at a time I really needed it a lot due to many stressful moments going on in our world. Those seven tracks are excellent with a nice rhythm, just fast enough but not too slow–which I felt all along is perfect for while you are at work.\n\nThen on Track 9 “Flor de Laranjeira” (translated meaning “Orange Flower”) brings on the soothing sounds of Camiela Eisenmann. She can be found on both Instagram and Facebook. The final two tracks feature duets with Eric Marienthal and the Outro with Rubinho Antunes.\n\nDefinitely gets five stars in my book. From first listen after the Amigo Leo intro to the final Outro track, it is a true keeper to add to your library. The album is available on Spotify.\n\nHopefully, I will be back on the 411 train sometime in April as I continue to find some newer artists and maybe a few of my favorites producing new work. Please continue to check your inboxes periodically so you can stay up to date.\n\nIn the meantime, enjoy March Madness (sorry to all fans of World Cup soccer/futbol) as the 68 team NCAA Tournament is one of the greatest events in all of sports. Unlike in soccer where there is mostly little to no action, the action this time of year is fast paced, unpredictable, and the sight of Cinderellas is very common.\n\nYou can catch many of the key updates about men’s college basketball at both my other blog here on WordPress along with the Jetpack app. Not too late to fill out your brackets. The dealine is this Thursday, March 21 at noon Eastern/11 a.m. Central/9 a.m. Pacific (and for those who follow in Brazil, the coverage on ESPN International will start at 2 p.m. Rio time.)\n\nAlso, check out my podcast called Big Z College Hoops Central–of which you can find on both Spotify and Apple Music.\n\nHere below is the link to my blog. Please enjoy what I have to say, and I hope you can comment on some of my posts–especially since last October and subscribe, rate, and review my podcast. It will really a lot to me going forward. Take care and I will see you again next month.\n\nhttps://fortyminutesofhoopsfun.wordpress.com\n\nBorn as Thomas Richard on April 8, 1946 in Cleveland, Ohio, this pop-jazz singer and pianist began singing professionally at age 15. Five years later, he began life on the road and in 1952, he was named as house singer at the Three Rivers Inn in Syracuse, New York The location was popular until it closed in 1973. Their self proclaimed “Home of the Stars” featured the likes of Nat King Cole, Tony Bennett, Connie Francis, Bobby Darin, Connie Francis, Johnny Cash, Paul Anka, Peggy Lee, and others.\n\nDuring his time working with a big band, he collaborated with Gregory Hines, Ray Charles, Buddy Greco, and a group simply known as the Four Freshmen He later traveled the country to lead small house bands in clubs across the United States.\n\nTom began intensive piano instruction in 1970. Great fortune again arrived three years later when he was opening for Dizzy Gillespie, Jimmy Smith, and Bill Evans. This was around the same time he moved to New York City. His first album made it big across the pond in London’s jazz discos during the early 1980s. He was voted to Down Beat’s International Critics Poll in 1994.\n\nHis discography includes the boxing themed title And in This Corner in 1979; the Los Angeles-based Inner City label released it on LP in 1981. The album would finally arrive in CD in 2002, thanks in large part to it being reissued by the Japanese P-Vine label. Acoustic bassist Eddie Gomez (who is best known for his long association with pianist Bill Evans) and drummer Jack DeJohnette were among the improvisers who backed Lellis on his debut release. His second album, Double Entendre was released by Beamtide Music in 1991 and was followed by his only Concord Jazz release, Taken to Heart two years later. (which came out in 1993 and found the singer doing some collaborating with Brazilian great Toninho Horta). After parting company with Concord, Lellis went on a heavy touring scheduling and would not produce another album until Skylark arrived in 2001.\n\nMy review is from his seventh and last album, The Flow which came out on January 29, 2016. The songs remind me of being in a club setting or carefree dinner party from an earlier era where the drinks would be flowing and laughs a plenty from the crowd.\n\nA sped up version of Frank Sinatra and Sergio Mendes instantly crossed my mind, especially with “Dance With Me” on Track 2 and the often covered “Dawn of the New World” (which is not related to the Astro Boy TV series theme.) The rest of the songs are laid back and great for relaxing with your friend or lover by your side. Overall, it is an excellent album for any jazz lover’s library. I found it to be a fun listen, and I am sure you will agree.\n\nIt is available in both vinyl and CD on Amazon and eBay. His entire discography is streamable on both Spotify and Apple Music.\n\nWhat album will I uncover shortly after America’s unofficial national holiday known as the Super Bowl makes its’ first ever trip to Sin City in Las Vegas, Nevada on Sunday, February 11.\n\nIf it is anything like it was in Miami during Super Bowl LIV when the Kansas City Chiefs outlasted the San Francisco 49’ers in the last major sporting event before this living, breathing thing called COVID-19 took over our lives, this rematch in SB LVIII promises to be a great game.\n\nBut we will see how it turns out, as CBS along with separate coverage from dozens of countries in the rest of the world like Sky Sports in the United Kingdom will be tuning in on the fun.\n\nSee you again next month, hopefully in time for Valentine’s Day–if not, sometimes thereafter.\n\nImage courtesy of btwberkshires.com\n\nCafuné started out in 2014 as a duo consisting of singer-songwriter Sedona Schat and producer Noah Yoo. They both met while studying at New York University. They actually appeared in the same viral video with Pharrell who made Maggie Rogers famous. Eight years later, they hit it big going viral with TikTok on the song “Tek It” from their 2021 album Running.\n\nThe band’s name is from the native Brazilian Tupi language, and later was adopted into Portuguese. In rough translation, it means the gesture of a person running one’s fingers through a lover’s hair. Oooh la la, I bet you can picture those romantic movies and old television commercials from decades past.\n\nOn both their album and their Love Songs for the End EP, which debuted on October 13, 2023–they bring a club, dance like atmosphere on every song. They fall into more specific types like dream pop, indie-pop, and alt-pop.\n\nIn a June 3, 2021 article on the indie rock website Stereogum, longtime columnist Chris Deville described the single “High” as:\n\n“What begins as a languid, Blonde-esque minimalist guitar swoon quickly evolves into something more like indie-pop bossa-nova, then pivots into an even dreamier sound somewhere between Clairo and Alvvays.”\n\nThink of acts like Magdalena Bay, Sofi Tukker, Slowdive, or some favorites on the indie rock music scene in 2023 such as Mitski, Caroline Polachek, and Sophie Ellis-Bextor, just to name a few.\n\nAmong the favorites from their album that I enjoyed were on Track 4, “Everyone Knows” and Track 2 from their EP titled “Demise.” A true New Year’s Eve type feeling, or music for any party that your heart desires. I feel this is a great album for summertime at the beach or tapping in your car with the Spotify app ready to go.\n\nIn a May 2016 article on The Fader, Schat in an email response had this to say about the song “Don’t You Forget.”\n\n“‘Don’t You Forget’ is about self-love as a continual act, something that you have to work at. In a world that makes you feel like you should hate yourself, you have to actively make the decision that you’re going to love yourself— and then you do things to reinforce that.”\n\nIsn’t that what the magic of Christmas is all about? Loving each other and loving yourself–even though you may not receive everything on your holiday list.\n\nPersonally, I find many indie rock artists pursuing similar avenues for success. But the line between the next breakout act and those struggling even to put a tour together, the lines are getting further apart more than ever.\n\nThanks in large part to Spotify paying only something like 0.00000037 cents for each play of a song makes zero sense. There is a lot of money to go around, just ask college athlete in the United States taking full advantage of their Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL.) It is a major difference in putting your heart and soul into creating a piece of music that they enjoy sharing with the world or just a small group of people inside a neighborhood bar.\n\nIn my Christmas message on my other blog covering men’s Division I college basketball, I spoke about why those who are struggling just to put food on the table and have a roof over their heads at night should not be ignored. One artist in particular came out with a great album in the summer of 2023 that deals with the dominant topic on why temperatures have gotten warmer by the month, in what turned out to be the warmest global temperatures on record.\n\nHere is the link, and please feel free to leave some comments there if you get some time:\n\nClimate change is still real, it always has been and hopefully things will turn in the opposite way to protect our dear and precious Planet Earth.\n\nBesides, we need to continue to support others, not just during times of disaster–but also in calmer times. Think also about those who might be struggling–whether mentally, physically, or financially speaking. Ask for help. If you feel things are spiraling out of control, call 988 or chat online at 988lifeline.org and try to get therapy 24/7/365, even during holidays.\n\nEvery year during the Christmas season, I always think to myself that things are going to get better. And every year, it feels the opposite in that we set high expectations and the results fall way flat or we make multiple attempts similar to having to scale a very large wall with very little rope. No matter what obstacles that life throws at you–even if things are bleak, never ever give up.\n\nA saying I have attached over my desk says:\n\nGood ones do for themselves\n\nGreat ones do for others\n\nTo remind me of a baseball statistic, I am batting over .500 in terms of opening presents that match my holiday wish list. Some years, I am totally surprised and hearing the stories behind how they found each gift that I didn’t see coming makes me appreciate that the older I get, I understand why the spirit of giving is what makes this time of year truly magical.\n\nAs the timeless holiday saying goes,\n\nPeace on Earth, Good Will Towards Men (And Women.)\n\nMerry Christmas/Feliz Natal to all and hopefully Santa will get what you want underneath your Christmas tree.\n\nHopefully, the Brazilian bossa nova scene will dig for more in 2024.\n\nWe will get back on the jazz train sometime in January. Have a safe, healthy, and prosperous New Year."
