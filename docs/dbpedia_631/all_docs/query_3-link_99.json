The book and accompanying audio CDs contain the scores, mixed audio tracks, and component audio files of 41 contemporary grooves. The major styles covered include Afro-Caribbean, Afro-Cuban, Brazilian, rock, funk, soul, hip hop and jazz. The history, context, and stylistic characteristics for each major style are presented, along with a number of different grooves typical of each style.\n\nW\n\nriters. The groove is the heart of contemporary music. Composers and arrangers must understand the essence of a wide variety of grooves to write contemporary music effectively. Writers can study the grooves presented here and use them as the basic rhythmic material for their work, creating arrangements and original compositions based on these grooves. In addition, by developing an understanding of the roots of these grooves, writers can then create original groove hybrids, expanding the vocabulary of their music. Writers will also find the scores valuable in learning how to notate various aspects of these grooves, including the notation of Afro-Cuban, Afro-Caribbean, and Brazilian percussion instruments. The resource section contains additional materials that writers can consult for more in-depth information on writing in specific styles.\n\nP\n\nlayers. Instrumentalists can learn to play these styles from the book’s scores and audio tracks either by playing along with the mixed audio tracks or by using the component audio files. The audio CD contains a one-minute version of each groove; the book has the corresponding score. The component audio files on the DVD contain the individual instrumental tracks for each groove and can be manipulated in a variety of ways to create custom play-along tracks: the tracks can be looped to create longer versions of the groove; the keys and tempos can be changed; and individual instruments can be muted. All this can be done in both basic audio programs like Amazing Slow Downer and GarageBand, and in more advanced digital audio workstations (DAWs) like Logic or Digital Performer. In addition, the resource section lists a number of books, CDs, and DVDs that provide further information about the various styles covered in this book.\n\nP\n\nroducers. Producers will find the component audio files useful as raw material for creating original music. The individual instrumental tracks of the component audio files can be looped, edited, transposed, time-shifted, and manipulated in other ways to create grooves, fills, and other elements of their own arrangements and compositions. The resource section lists some materials producers that will find useful in exploring this aspect of the book.\n\nN\n\note: The mixes on the CD are intended for educational listening and are not meant to reflect the production standards of each style.\n\nEssential Grooves\n\nvii\n\nnotation key Drumset (hands stems up, feet stems down) Cymbal\n\n/\n\nHigh Hat\n\nx\n\n> x\n\nRide Cymbal\n\nCrash Cymbal\n\n+ x\n\n% x\n\nClosed Hat\n\nOpen Hat\n\n(Ride Bell)\n\nx\n\nx\n\nRide Cymbal Bell\n\nSnare Drum\n\nœ\n\nTom Toms\n\nœ\n\nx Crossstick\n\nœ\n\nHigh\n\nœ\n\nMid\n\nLow\n\nOther (Cowbell)\n\n/\n\n!\n\n(Shell)\n\nKick Drum\n\nx\n\nx\n\nœ\n\nShell of Drum\n\nCowbell\n\nHat with Foot\n\nTrac Percussion Congas\n\n/x\n\n>x\n\nHeel Slap or Toe\n\nTimbales\n\n5 High Open\n\n5 Low Open\n\n!

These islands include what are now Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, and the Virgin Islands. Cuba is the largest of the Caribbean Islands and African-influenced music from Cuba, called “Afro-Cuban music,” has exerted a powerful influence on contemporary popular music. Spain began the colonization of Cuba in the 17th century. As happened during colonization throughout the New World, the indigenous population was either eradicated or enslaved and West African slaves were brought as laborers to “develop” the region. The colonists attempted to sever the slaves’ ties to their African roots. Slaves were forced to speak Spanish and convert to Christianity. They kept their native religions alive by giving their deities the names of Christian saints and preserved many of their cultural and religious traditions through the religion of Santería. The slaves were not allowed to bring their instruments from their native countries and so were forced to recreate these instruments with materials in the New World. The African-derived instruments of Cuba include drums, bells, and shakers from four principle African cultures: the Yoruba, Dahomean, Congolese, and Abakuá.\n\nD\n\nanzón. The danzón, a popular dance genre, developed in Cuba in the late 19th century from the contradanza, a dance form brought to Cuba by French colonialists in 1790. The earliest known example of the Cuban contradanza is the song “San Pascual.” The Cuban contradanza was performed for dancing by an ensemble called the orquestra típica, an ensemble consisting of two clarinets, cornet, ophicleide (a kind of brass instrument with keys), trombone, and paila (an early type of timbales). The cinquillo, a fundamental rhythmic cell that is part of the foundation of traditional Cuban music, was introduced into the Cuban contradanza at the beginning of the 19th century. The cinquillo is a one-measure, five-note pattern that was brought to Cuba by black slaves from Haiti that emigrated to Cuba.\n\n1. afro-cuban\n\n2\n\nCinquillo\n\n/ 42 ¿\n\n¿ ¿ ≈ ¿ ¿\n\nThe Cuban contradanza later came to be called simply danza, though there are essentially no differences between these two styles. The earliest danza was “El Sungambelo,” written in 1813. Influential composers of the danza include Ignacio Cervantes and Ernesto Lecuona. The habanera, a precursor to the danzón, was also derived from the contradanza but was a slower and more graceful dance style. The habanera was the first Cuban dance to be exported from Cuba to the rest of the world. “La Paloma,” written by Sebastian Yradier, is the first known habanera. In the habanera, the basic habanera rhythm replaced the cinquillo pattern.\n\nHabanera rhythm\n\n/ 42 ¿\n\n.\n\n¿ ¿\n\n¿\n\nThe habanera was replaced by the danzón in 1870. Around 1920, a smaller version of the orquestra típica, called the charanga francesca, developed to play danzón. The typical charanga francesca consisted of violins, viola, flute, piano, double bass, timbales, and guiro. Ernesto Simpson wrote the first danzón, “Las Alturas de Simpson,” in 1891. Two other important innovators of this style were Manuell Saumell and Miguel Failde.\n\nC\n\nuban son. Afro-Cuban music developed from the combination of African and Spanish influences. The most important musical form to arise from this mixture is the son, the root style of many forms of Afro-Cuban dance music. Son, a combination of the music of the campesinos (farmers) of Spanish descent and the African slaves, originated in the rural parts of Cuba in the 19th century and migrated to Havana by the turn of the century. Son was originally called sabrosur, mambo diablo, and later son montuno. Son was revolutionized in the ‘30s by Arsenio Rodriguez. Rodriguez played the Cuban tres, an instrument derived from the Spanish guitar consisting of three pairs of strings. Rodriguez was responsible for a number of innovations in the son. He created the conjunto tipico, the standard ensemble of son, by adding trumpets, congas, piano, and timbales to the son sextet/ septet formation. He added two new sections to the son form—the montuno and mambo, open vamp sections featuring instrumental improvisation­­—and crystallized the form of the son to include an introduction, verse, mambo, interludes, and a variety of breaks that aligned with the clave. He introduced moñas (horn lines played during the mambo section) and variations of the tumbao (a repeated pattern played by the bass, cowbells, and congas). The most important rhythmic aspect of son is the clave—a two-measure pattern of five notes with a strong measure of three notes (the Cuban tresillo) and a weak measure of two notes. The clave pattern can begin either with the strong or weak measure, creating the 3-2 or 2-3 clave.\n\nEssential Grooves\n\n3\n\nSon Clave 3/2 Clave\n\n/ 44 œ\n\n2/3 Clave\n\n/ 44 Œ\n\nCuban tresillo\n\n‰ œJ Œ\n\nœ\n\nœ\n\nœ\n\nœ\n\nŒ\n\nCuban tresillo\n\nœ\n\nŒ\n\nœ œ Œ J\n\n‰\n\nŒ œ\n\nRodriguez also integrated a popular rumba form, guaguanco, into the son. The rumba clave is slightly different from the son clave, though it can also begin with either the weak or strong measure. Rumba Clave 3/2 Clave\n\n/ 44 œ\n\n‰ œJ Œ .\n\n2/3 Clave\n\n/ 44 Œ\n\nCuban tresillo\n\nœ\n\nœ\n\nœ J Œ\n\nŒ œ\n\nœ\n\nœ\n\nCuban tresillo\n\n‰ œJ Œ .\n\nŒ œ J\n\nThe rhythms of all the elements in the ensemble exist in an important relationship to the clave. Not only does the clave control the percussion parts, the basslines, and the piano montunos and comping rhythms, but the melodic rhythm, the solos and fills, and the background lines all must be “in clave.” A complete explanation of how to compose and arrange with the clave is beyond the scope of this book—interested writers should consult the books by Mauleón and Gerard listed in the appendix. The son provided the basis for many styles of Latin music, including the Latin jazz of the ‘40s; the dance bands of Machito, Tito Puente, and Tito Rodriguez in the ‘50s; and the salsa bands of the ‘60s.\n\nM\n\nambo. One of the most important dance forms to develop from the son was the mambo, an up-tempo dance form blending elements of North American instrumentation and harmony with the son. (The mambo dance form should not be confused with the mambo section of the son.) Derived from the danzón, the mambo appeared in the late ‘30s in Havana, principally through the work of the bassist Cachao. Pérez Prado, the Cuban band leader, composer, and pianist known as the “King of the Mambo,” popularized the style through his recordings and tours of North America. Prado’s writing was strongly influenced by Stan Kenton’s approach to big band harmony and scoring, creating a bridge between Latin mambo\n\n1. afro-cuban\n\n4\n\nand American big band jazz. Another important figure in the development of mambo was Benny Moré, the greatest of the Cuban singers during the mambo era. Both Prado and Moré emigrated to Mexico in the late 1940s.\n\nC\n\nha-cha-chá. In the ‘50s, the cha-cha-chá, which developed from the early Cuban danzónmambo, became an important component in the charanga repertoire through the music of violinist Enrique Jorrín and others. The cha-cha-chá became an internationally popular dance through television and commercial recording.\n\nS\n\nongo. The songo is a relatively recent development that combines elements of the rumba and son with jazz and funk. The principal innovators of this style were drummers José Changuito and Blas Egues, bassist/musical director Juan Formell (of the Cuban group Los Van Van), and the percussionists in the groups La Ritmo Oriental, Los Latinos, and Grupo Irakere. Unlike the other Cuban dance styles in which the percussion parts were later adapted to the drumset, the songo was actually created for the drumset in the ‘70s.\n\n6/8\n\nAfro-Cuban. The bembe is one of the fundamental African rhythms to appear in folkloric (rural) Cuban music. Originally played on hoe blades, shekeres (gourds wrapped loosely with beads), and conga drums, the bembe is organized around the 6/8 clave, or key rhythm. Later, this rhythm was used a basis for the bembe when played with modern instruments.\n\n6/8 Clave\n\n/ 68 ¿\n\n¿ J\n\n‰\n\n¿\n\n‰\n\n¿\n\n¿.\n\nThe Grooves Danzón Basic instrumentation: • • • • •\n\nviolin, viola, cello acoustic bass wooden flute piano timbales and guiro\n\nHarmony: The harmony of the danzón shows the distinct influence of classical music.

In the 1st four measures, the comping pattern plays almost the complete clave; the 2nd four-measure pattern is more sustained but plays the accents of the 2nd half of the clave. • Notice the strong, poly-rhythmic feel: the bass part contributes a 3-over-2 layer, while the drums and percussion accent the dotted quarter-note pulse. • The simple, two-chord vamp is typical of the style.\n\nEssential Grooves\n\n11\n\nTrack 5 6/8 Afro-Cuban\n\nq. = 120\n\n.j - . œœœ ‰ œœœ œœœ œ œ œ\n\nF7 6 & 8 .. b œœœ œ F ? 68 ..\n\nPiano\n\nBass\n\nDrums\n\nConga\n\nœ œ œ J J\n\nCabasa\n\n/\n\n˙. & .. ˙ .

As in the colonization of other parts of the Americas, the native inhabitants were enslaved or eradicated and thousands of African slaves were brought to the territory to provide the labor for the colonists. Most of these Africans came from West Africa, including peoples of the Bantu, Yoruba, and Fon tribes. Brazilian popular music can be understood as the result of a mixture of European, African, and native musical traditions (though the influence of the musics of the indigenous people is relatively weak in contemporary Brazilian music). From the European tradition came the harmony, dance and song forms, and the use of stringed musical instruments. The African influence provided the rhythmic basis, the percussion instruments, and certain performance practices such as call-and-response singing, the use of music and dance in religious rituals, and multi-layered, polyrhythmic textures. Since the 16th century, these elements have combined and fused to form a rich, stylistically diverse world of popular music.\n\nS\n\namba. One of the most important Afro-Brazilian music/dance styles, samba remains a vital influence in Brazilian popular music today. Samba developed in the favelas (slums) of Rio de Janeiro in the early part of the 20th century. The early samba still had much in common with other earlier styles, particularly the maxixe and marcha, but quickly developed into a recognizably discrete form. By the late 1920s samba had achieved widespread popularity throughout Brazil and the batucada (heavily percussive samba played by a large bateria or percussion section) had become the dominant style of the carnaval celebration.\n\n2. brazilian\n\n14\n\nIn the 1930s, middle- and upper-middle class musicians became involved in writing, arranging, and producing sambas for radio and recordings. The samba-canção developed through the work of songwriters like Noel Rosa, Ary Barroso, Ataulfo Alves, Dorival Caymmi, and many others, and flourished throughout the 1930s and 40s. Their samba-canções had greater emphasis on melody, had more complex harmony and more sophisticated lyrics, and they were cooler and softer. Through carnaval and the growing popularity of radio broadcasts and phonograph recordings, samba became an essential component of Brazilian culture. The samba-canções played on the radio and at dance clubs were usually orchestrated for ensembles modeled after the dance bands common in the United States, but they also included a samba bateria. At the same time, small groups playing samba were also extremely popular. The typical small group instrumentation included guitar, cavaquihno (a small, four-stringed instrument similar to a ukelele), tamborim (not the same instrument as the tambourine—a small hand drum without jingles, played with the fingers of the one hand and a stick in the other), and pandeiro (a hand drum similar to a tambourine, with a single, tunable head, and jingles). Often, one or more of the instrumentalists also sang.\n\nB\n\noss Nova. The Golden Age of samba lasted through the end of World War II. In the early ‘50s several international influences had a strong impact on Brazilian popular music. The first was a “cool” performance aesthetic, first popularized by the vocal style of Frank Sinatra and later the cool jazz of Miles Davis. In addition, the increasingly sophisticated harmonic concepts found in much modern music—jazz, in particular—began finding their way into the samba-canção. In the late 1950s, Antônio Carlos “Tom” Jobim and João Gilberto distilled these influences and created a cool, sophisticated type of samba that came to be known as Bossa Nova (New Thing or New Way). Gilberto created a new batidinha (beat)—an intimate, rhythmic approach to playing samba on guitar which included a system for voicing the new, more sophisticated harmonies—that distilled the complex, multi-layered batucada to its essence. Jobim, a master songwriter, was the leading composer in crafting a repertoire of music in the new style. In addition, through his work as an arranger and producer he made an essential contribution to the development and world-wide popularity of Bossa Nova. Until the development of Bossa Nova, the international spread of samba was limited by its instrumentation—to play samba required a bateria (or at least a few percussionists) playing Brazilian instruments. In Bossa Nova, however, the samba groove was “transcribed” for the instrumentation of the typical jazz small group: guitar, piano, bass, and drumset. This shift in orchestration allowed Bossa Nova to be played by non-Brazilians and facilitated its spread outside of Brazil. Bossa Nova is essentially a guitar-based style. While João Gilberto was the originator of the Bossa Nova guitar style, a number of other guitarists quickly followed in his footsteps, including Luiz Bonfá, Oscar Castro-Neves, and Roberto Menescal. In the 1970s, Helio Delmiro recorded with Jobim, playing electric guitar. Delmiro, a viruoso, was tremendously influential on the next generation of Brazilian guitarists. Although the guitar was the dominant instrument in Bossa Nova, a number of important pianists also contributed to the development of the style, including Jobim himself (piano was his primary instrument but he also played guitar), Johnny Alf, João Donato, Luiz Eça, Antonio Adolpho, and Sergio Mendes.\n\nEssential Grooves\n\n15\n\nAfter the commercial popularity of Bossa Nova peaked in the mid-’60s, both samba and Bossa Nova continued to develop in Brazil. While Bossa Nova was one way of playing samba with a contemporary rhythm section, other “transcriptions” of the batucada rhythms to rhythm section soon emerged. Drummers such as Milton Banana, Dom Um Romeo, and Airto Moreira were influential, both inside and outside of Brazil, in transferring authentic Afro-Brazilian rhythms to the drumset. In the 1970s, Romeo’s work with the jazz fusion group Weather Report and Moreira’s recordings with Chick Corea’s Return to Forever spread the influence of Brazilian music throughout the world. Since that time, a number of great drummers, including Paulo Braga, Teo Lima, Tutty Moreno, Wilson das Neves, and many others, have continued adapting and developing the great samba tradition for the contemporary rhythm section.\n\nM\n\nPB. Bossa Nova had a powerful impact on the musical style that followed it. MPB (música brasileira popular) can refer to popular Brazilian music in general, but is most commonly used to describe a generation of musicians that became popular after Bossa Nova. These artists include Edu Lobo, Chico Buarque, Gilberto Gil, Caetano Veloso, Milton Nascimento, Djavan, Ivan Lins, Elis Regina, Gal Costa, João Bosco, and many others. These musicians were heavily influenced by samba and Bossa Nova, but also assimilated a number of other styles from both Brazil (especially from the Northeast region) and the wider world, including rock, funk, and avant-garde and experimental music. The repertoire of these musicians included samba and Bossa Nova, as well as the many other styles they were assimilating. The Brazilian styles they played were strongly influenced by rock, funk, and other North American song styles. But just as important, their songwriting and production reflected a growing mastery of the production values (especially in the quality of the recording, mixing, and mastering) of North American and European artists. By the late ‘70s and early ‘80s, these artists’ recorded production reached a level of maturity and sophistication equal to that of any artist in the world. New variants of samba, the result of a fusion of samba with various other styles, appeared after Bossa Nova. Partido alto is one important type of samba to develop through the influence of North American funk. The term denotes both a type of urban samba song form—often involving a duel between two singers improvising their lyrics—and a rhythmic variation on samba. The guitar retained its dominance in MPB. In interviews and liner notes, all these musicians cite the powerful effect of João Gilberto’s guitar style on them when they first heard “Chega de Saudade.” In fact, most of them recount stories of where they were when they first heard the song on the radio. All of the songwriters of this generation can play guitar in the Gilberto style and many of the arrangers and musical directors for their recordings and live performances were guitarists, such as Dori Caymmi, Lula Galvão, and L.C. Ramos. Of course, a number of keyboardists were also important arrangers and producers of MPB, including Sergio Mendes, Cesár Comargo Mariano, and Wagner Tiso. Samba is essentially an urban style of music that developed in Rio de Janeiro. However, Brazil is a huge country and the northeast of Brazil, including the states of Bahia, Pernambuco, Maranhão, and Ceará, have a rich musical tradition of their own. While there are a large number of styles from this region, in this book we present two of the most common and influential: baião and afoxé.\n\n2. brazilian\n\n16\n\nB\n\naião, a musical song style from the sertão (the arid interior of northeast Brazil), was popularized by accordianist Luiz Gonzaga. Gonzaga came to Rio de Janeiro in the early 1940s and had a number of commercial hits playing in this style. He adapted the folkloric instrumentation to include accordian, triangle, pandeiro, and zabumaba (a kind of bass drum). Like samba, contemporary musicians have found ways to capture the essence of the baião while playing contemporary rhythm section instruments rather than the authentic instruments of the folkloric style. The baião is often fused with jazz, samba, funk, and other styles to create hybrid grooves.\n\nA\n\nfoxé is derived from the ceremonial music of candomblé, the Afro-Brazilian religion of Bantu origin popular in the northeast of Brazil. The candomblé ensemble includes atabaques (similar to conga drums), gonguê (a low-tones bell, similar to ago-gos), and a variety of shakers, including the afoxê (notice the different accent on the “e”) also called a shekeré. Afoxé groups were a new kind of bloco afro (Afro-Brazilian carnaval group) to appear in Carnaval in the mid-70s. The most famous afoxé is The Filhos de Ghandhi (The Sons of Ghandi). Like other forms of Afro-Brazilian music, musicians quickly found a way to play afoxé with contemporary rhythm section instruments, creating many variants of afoxé fused with other styles.\n\nThe Grooves Samba Basic instrumentation: • One or more guitars: nylon string guitars and/or electric guitars (the nylon string is more traditional and less pop-oriented). • Electric bass or acoustic bass: electric for pop- and funk-influenced samba and acoustic bass in more jazz- or acoustic-oriented settings. • Piano or electric piano, occasionally synthesizer (in more pop-oriented production). • Drumset. • Hand percussion: especially pandeiro, tamborim, and/or shaker; occasionally cuica, congas, or surdo (with surdo, the mix has to be handled carefully to avoid conflicts with the bass). • Vocals. Harmony: The harmonic language of samba can vary somewhat depending on style, but is similar to Bossa Nova in that chromatic and non-diatonic chords frequently occur, but always function strongly within the prevailing key. While diatonic chords are sometimes triads, 7th chords with chord tensions and altered tension—particularly on dominant and secondary dominant chords—are common. Secondary dominant chord functions, including diminished 7th chords, and chords borrowed from the parallel minor key (modal interchange chords) are also common. Melody: Particularly in more traditional sambas, the melody is strongly diatonic. The use of chromatic notes in the melody most often occurs against modal interchange chords. Meter: Samba is felt and written in 2. The most common meters are 2/4, 2/2, and 4/4 (samba is traditionally written in 2/4 in Brazil).\n\nEssential Grooves\n\n17\n\nKey rhythms: Contemporary samba is derived from the rhythms of the samba batucada, a percussion ensemble playing syncopated, interlocking patterns that subdivide the pulse and play a particular set of accents. In 2/4, the pulse is subdivided into a steady stream of sixteenth-notes, usually played by the snare drum, shakers, cuica, and pandeiro.\n\nGanza\n\nSnare\n\nCuica\n\nPandeiro\n\n2¿ ¿ ¿ ¿ ¿ ¿ ¿ ¿ /4\n\n¿ ¿ ¿ ¿ ¿ ¿ ¿ ¿\n\n> > > 2> /4 œ œ œ œ œ œ œ œ\n\n>œ œ œ >œ >œ œ œ >œ\n\n> 2 > /4 œ œ œ œ œ œ œ œ\n\n> > œ œ œ œ œ œ œ œ\n\n2 /4 œ œ œ œ œ œ œ œ\n\nœ œ œ œ œ œ œ œ\n\nThe tamborim and ago-go bells play a syncopated pattern that includes the “fork” rhythm (called this because of its visual similarity to the tines of a fork), one of the most important samba rhythms.

This part typically has a muted, unaccented note on beat 1 and an accented open note on beat 2. Often, a sixteenth-note pickup precedes beat 2.\n\nLow Surdo\n\n. 2 ¿ /4 .\n\n¿\n\n> œ\n\n¿. .\n\n¿\n\n> œ 2. brazilian\n\n18\n\nTrack 6 Samba q = 130 C\n\nGuitar (Nylon String)\n\nBass\n\nDrums\n\nTamborim\n\nCongas\n\nª Gtr.\n\nœ\n\n2 & 4 .. œœ F ? 42 .. œ F 2 / 4 2 / 4\n\n& œœ .\n\n? œ Bs\n\nœ. # œœ œœ\n\nœ\n\n> ≈ ¿ œ\n\n> .. œœ œ œx œœ F .. x x\n\nœ\n\n# œœ\n\nF\n\n¿\n\nœœ\n\n> ≈ ¿ #œ\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\n¿\n\nœ ¿ œ\n\nx\n\nœ œ. œ\n\n> ≈ ¿ œ\n\nx x\n\n¿ œ œ\n\n1\n\nœ\n\nC6\n\n.\n\nC+\n\nœ œœ.\n\nœœ\n\nœ\n\nœ\n\n> ≈ ¿ œ\n\nb œœ œœ œ .\n\nœœ.\n\nb œœ > ≈ ¿ bœ\n\nœ\n\n> > > > > > > œœ œ œx œœ œœ œ œx œœ œœ œ œx œœ œœ œ œx œœ œœ œ œx œœ œœ œ œx œœ œœ œ œx œœ\n\nBrushes\n\n2 / 4 .. ¿ F C\n\nC+\n\nœ œ.\n\nx ≈ x ≈ x ≈ x x\n\nœ. # œœ œœ .\n\nœ\n\n# œœ > ≈ ¿ #œ\n\nx\n\nx x\n\n3\n\n.\n\nœœ\n\nx\n\n¿ œ ≈ ¿ ¿ œ œ ¿ ¿ œ œ ¿ ¿ œ œ ¿ ¿ œ\n\n2\n\nC+\n\nx\n\nC6\n\nœ œœ.\n\nœœ\n\nœ\n\n.\n\n> ≈ ¿ œ\n\nœ\n\n4\n\nC+\n\nb œœ œœ œ . .\n\nœ\n\nb œœ > ≈ ¿ bœ\n\nœœ.\n\n.. ..\n\nDr.\n\n/\n\n> > > > > > > > œ œ xœ œ œ œ œx œ œ œ œx œ œ œ œx œ œ œ œx œ œ œ œx œ œ œ œx œ œ œ œx œ .. œ œ œ œ œ œ œ œ œ œ œ œ œ œ œ œ\n\nTamb.\n\n/\n\n≈ x ≈ x ≈ x x\n\nx\n\nx\n\nCon.\n\n/\n\n≈ ¿ ¿ œ œ ¿ œ ¿ œ\n\n¿\n\n5\n\nEssential Grooves\n\nx x œ œ 6\n\nx ≈ x ≈ x ≈ x x\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx x\n\nx ..\n\n¿ œ ≈ ¿ ¿ ¿ ¿ œ œ ¿ ¿ ¿ ¿ œ .. œ œ œ œ 7\n\n8\n\n19\n\nNotes on Samba (Track 6): • Notice the low surdo part in the bass and kick drum.

Notice the difference between the grooves. • The surdo part is played by the bass and the kick drum. The kick and bass parts change in the second four-bar groove to a longer note in the bass, supported by two quarter-notes in the kick drum. • As is typical when piano and guitar play together in the rhythm section, the piano part is smooth and legato, contrasting the rhythmic quality of the guitar part.\n\nPartido Alto Basic instrumentation: • One or more guitars: nylon string guitars and/or electric guitars. • Electric bass. • Piano or electric piano. • Drumset. • Hand percussion: shaker, pandeiro, and tamborim are sometimes used. • Vocals.\n\nHarmony: In contemporary versions of partido alto, the harmonic language of samba and Bossa Nova is often influenced by funk and jazz. The harmony can range from fairly simple to complex. Melody: The melodies of partido alto are derived from samba, but can be more complex and chromatic to match the harmonic context. Meter: Partido alto is usually notated in 2/4, but sometimes in a pop or funk context is written in 4/4, with the same value of subdivision so that two bars of 2/4 equal one bar of 4/4. Key rhythms: These are found in variations on the samba batucada. One important characteristic of partido alto is that it has a pickup beat, starting on beat 2 of the pickup measure. The subdivisions and accents are played by the pandeiro and the ago-go plays the essential partido alto rhythm.\n\nTamborim\n\nAgo-go\n\n.. >œ œ œ œ œ >œ œ >œ\n\n/ 42 Œ / 42 œ\n\nœ\n\n.. œ\n\nœ\n\nœ\n\nœ\n\nœ >œ œ >œ œ >œ >œ œ .. œ œ\n\nœ œ\n\nœ\n\n..\n\n2. brazilian\n\n22\n\nTrack 9 Partido Alto Partido Alto, q = 110\n\n.\n\nGuitar (Nylon String)\n\nBass\n\nDrums\n\nCongas\n\nª Gtr.\n\n2 & 4 b œœ F ? 42\n\nF\n\nGÑ ^\n\nœ #œ\n\nF\n\n.. ’\n\nCon.\n\n/\n\n.. ’\n\nœ\n\n¿\n\nœœ\n\nœ #œ\n\n.. œ\n\n>x\n\nœ œ\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nœœ ≈ b œœ œ œ\n\n^ œ\n\nœ\n\nœ J\n\n>x x œ >x x> x x œ ≈ œ .\n\n.\n\nœœ ≈ œœ œ œ\n\n.\n\n¿\n\n^ œ\n\nœ #œ\n\n..\n\n’\n\n’\n\n..\n\n’\n\n’\n\n’\n\n’\n\n..\n\n.\n\nœœ ≈ b œœ œ œ\n\n..\n\n’\n\n3\n\n.\n\nœœ\n\nœœ\n\n^ œ^ œ ≈\n\nœ\n\n.\n\n’\n\n2\n\n.\n\n≈\n\n>j œœ ≈ b œœœ... .\n\n.\n\n4\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nœœœ ≈ œœœ\n\nœœœ ≈ b œœœ\n\nœœœ ≈ œœœ\n\n≈\n\n^ œ^ ≈ œ\n\n¿\n\n.\n\nœœœ ..\n\n^ œ^ ‰ ≈ J œ \n\nœ\n\n’\n\n’\n\n’\n\n’\n\n’\n\n’\n\n’\n\n..\n\n’\n\n’\n\n’\n\n’\n\n’\n\n’\n\n’\n\n..\n\n≈\n\n5\n\nEssential Grooves\n\nœœ\n\n^ . œœœ ≈ œœ\n\nb œœ\n\n.\n\n.. yœ y yx y y œy y yœ y yx y y yœ y yœ y Œ ≈\n\nœœ ≈ œœ œ œ\n\nGÑ ^\n\n/\n\nœ\n\n.\n\ny œ\n\n.\n\n& .. ≈ b œœœ\n\nDr.\n\n≈\n\n^ œ^ œ ≈\n\n.\n\n1\n\nG Ñ.\n\n? .. œ\n\nœ\n\n.. œ\n\n≈ œœ\n\n>j œœ ≈ b œœœ ...\n\n.\n\nœœ œ\n\n.. b œ œ\n\nœœ\n\ny / 42 œ F / 42 ‰\n\nBs.\n\nG- Ñ ^\n\n.\n\nœ\n\n6\n\n#œ\n\nœ\n\n7\n\nœ\n\nœ\n\n8\n\n#œ\n\n..\n\n23\n\nNotes on Partido Alto (Track 9): • The ago-go part is played by the drums (the composite rhythm of the kick and snare) and the electric bass. • A variation of the pandeiro accent pattern is played on the congas. • Notice the two different comping patterns in the guitar: the first plays the ago-go part, while the second is an all-off beat pattern.\n\nBossa Nova Basic instrumentation: • One or more guitars: nylon string guitars and/or electric guitars (a single nylon string guitar is more common in older styles of Bossa Nova; in jazz-influenced Bossa Nova, it’s most common to find a single guitar—either electric or acoustic—in the rhythm section). • Electric bass or acoustic bass (in more jazz- or acoustic-oriented Bossa Nova). • Piano or electric piano. • Drumset. • Hand percussion: since Bossa Nova often has a light, cool feel, percussion is used sparingly. Shaker is most common, though pandeiro and/or tamborim are sometimes used. • Vocals. Harmony: The harmonic language of Bossa Nova is similar to standard jazz harmony, but is arguably more nuanced and subtle. Chromatic and non-diatonic chords frequently occur, but—as in samba—always function strongly within the prevailing key. Diatonic chords are usually 7th chords, often with tensions. Altered tensions on dominant and secondary dominant chords are frequently used. Secondary dominant chord functions, including diminished 7th chords and minor 6th chords (bVI-6 functioning as V7 (b9) in particular), are common, as are chords borrowed from the parallel minor key (modal interchange chords). Melody: Like samba, most Bossa Nova songs are written with a vocal melody (though they may often be played instrumentally) and so melodies are often strongly diatonic. (The exception that proves the rule is Jobim’s “Desafinado” in which the chromaticism of the melody enhances and supports the meaning of the lyric.) The use of chromatic notes in the melody most often occurs against modal interchange chords or during brief modulations. Meter: Bossa Nova is traditionally felt and written in 2, though many musicians—particularly in North America and Europe—play Bossa Nova with more of a 4 feel. Early in its development, the most common meter used in Bossa Nova was 2/4. Currently, Bossa Nova is written in 2/4 or 4/4. Occasionally, 2/2 meter is used.\n\n2. brazilian\n\n24\n\nKey rhythms: Bossa Nova is a form of samba and so—like samba—its key rhythms also come from the batucada. João Gilberto distilled the batucada into a form playable entirely on the guitar: the Bossa Nova groove comes from this guitar style. In his style, the guitar provides the bassline and chords.\n\n& b 42\n\nA !∂\n\nFÿ\n\nG !∂\n\nC Ñ/G\n\nœœœ œœœ œœœ œœœ n œœ œœ .. n œœ œœ œœ .. œ œ. œ œ œ. bœ œ œ œ\n\nœœ œœ œœ œœ .. bœ œ œ œ . bœ œ\n\nœœ œœ œœ œœ . b œ œ œ b œ .. œ œ\n\nThe bassline, played by the thumb of the right hand, is a version of the low surdo that deemphasizes the accent on beat 2, making beats 1 and 2 equal. (This was part of the general “cool” quality of Bossa Nova.) He distilled the syncopations and accents (the “fork” rhythms) of the batucada into a comping rhythm, played by the fingers of the right hand. The comping rhythm of the guitar is a recurring pattern, usually one or two measures long, in which each chord has a duration of either two or three subdivisions of the pulse. In 2/4, for example, each chord has a duration of either two or three sixteenth-notes. In the absence of guitar, the piano can play these comping rhythms. Here are some typical comping rhythms.\n\nOne-bar comping patterns A.\n\n& 42 .. Û\n\nÛ\n\nÛ\n\nB.\n\nÛ.\n\n.. .. Û .\n\nÛ\n\nÛ\n\nÛ\n\n..\n\nÛ\n\nÛ\n\n..\n\nTwo-bar comping patterns\n\n& 42 ..

In early versions of Bossa Nova, in which the drumset was often absent, the tamborim, woodblock or clave played what became the cross-stick part (see the Bossa Nova grooves on the next page).\n\nEssential Grooves\n\n25\n\nTrack 10 Bossa Nova #1 q = 120\n\nAÑ\n\nGuitar (Nylon String)\n\n4 & b4Û\n\nP\n\nAÑ\n\n4 & b4’\n\nP\n\nPiano\n\nÛ ’\n\n? b 44 Bass\n\nDrums\n\nShaker\n\n? b 44\n\n’\n\n‰\n\nÛ\n\nA b∂\n\n’\n\n’\n\nÛ ’\n\n’\n\n∑ AÑ\n\n˙\n\n‰ Û\n\nÛ\n\nGÑ\n\n’\n\n’\n\nA b∂\n\n’\n\n’\n\nÛ Û J ’\n\nC7\n\n’\n\nÛ\n\nÛ Û J\n\n’\n\n’\n\n∑ GÑ\n\nj œ b˙\n\nC7\n\nÛ Û J\n\n∑\n\nœ.\n\nP\n\nGÑ\n\nÛÛ J\n\nœ bœ œ ˙\n\n‰ ’\n\n∑ C7\n\nœ.\n\nœ J ˙\n\nœ\n\nœ œ\n\n/\n\n44 yx y yy yx y y yxy y œ œ œ œ\n\ny y yx y y yx y y œ y œ œ y œ ’\n\n’\n\n’\n\n’\n\n’\n\n’\n\n’\n\n’\n\n/\n\n44 >x x x x >x x x x\n\n’\n\n’\n\n’\n\n’\n\n’\n\n’\n\n’\n\n’\n\nP\n\nP\n\nª Gtr.\n\nÛ Û J\n\nA b∂\n\nAÑ\n\n& b ..

The guitar plays two one-bar patterns, then a two-bar pattern. Compare this to the guitar comping pattern in measures 5–8. • The bass part plays the “Bossa Nova surdo,” a distlled version of the low surdo part with a long notes on beat 1 and an unaccented note on beat 3. When playing with the bass, the guitarist usually does not double the bassline. • Notice how the piano part is smooth and legato, contrasting the rhythmic quality of the guitar part.\n\nNotes on Bossa Nova 2 (Track 11): • • • •\n\nThough this track is notated in 4/4, it is felt in 2. On this track, the guitar plays a simple one-bar comping pattern. The bass plays long, legato notes, without the eighth-note pickup to beats 1 or 3. The drummer plays brushes, giving the track the light, gentle feel typical of Bossa Nova.\n\nEssential Grooves\n\n27\n\nTrack 11 Bossa Nova #2\n\nq = 120\n\nAÑ\n\nGuitar (Nylon String)\n\n4 & 4 ..

Diatonic harmony was also common. In contemporary versions, the harmony can range from simple diatonic triads and 7th chords to the more complex harmony of Bossa Nova and jazz. Melody: Simple diatonic melodies were common in roots versions of the baião. With a tonic mixolydian (#11) chord, the melody would include diatonic notes of that chord. In contemporary versions, the melody can be as complex as the harmony. Meter: Baião is felt in 2, so 2/4 and 2/2 are the most common meters. Key rhythms: Contemporary baião is based on the roots baião rhythms popularized by Luiz Gonzaga and others. The subdivisions of the pulse are played by the triangle and sometimes the pandeiro. The zabumba, a type of low drum common in the northeast of Brazil, plays the most important baião accents.\n\nTriangle\n\nZabumba\n\nœ+ œ œ% 2 /4 / 42 œ\n\nœ+ œ œ%\n\n> ¿ œ œ\n\n¿\n\nœ+ œ œ%\n\nœ\n\nœ+ œ œ%\n\n> ¿ œ œ\n\n¿\n\nNotes on Baião (Track 12): • Notice the zabumba rhythm in the bass, and kick drum, and the comping pattern of the piano and guitar. • The high hat plays the triangle rhythm. • The tamborim and cross-stick snare supply further accents of the subdivision.\n\nEssential Grooves\n\n29\n\nTrack 12 Baião\n\nh = 96\n\nGö .\n\n(Top Note)\n\nGuitar (Nylon String)\n\n2 & 4 .. # œ F\n\n> ≈ œ œ\n\nGö\n\nBass\n\nDrums\n\nTriangle\n\nª\n\n? 42 .. > ≈ œ œ F x x x ÷ 42 .. œ x œ F x x >œ x ÷ 42 ..

Like Afro-Cuban and Brazilian music, these styles were formed from the combination of African and European influences brought about through the colonization of the New World. The two most influential styles that we will consider here are reggae and calypso.\n\nR\n\neggae. Jamaica has an early history similar to other colonies in the New World. Christopher Columbus claimed the island of Jamaica, then called Santiago, as a Spanish colony when he landed there in 1494. The island became a British Crown colony in 1665. Like Cuba, Jamaica was a major producer of sugar, and slaves were the principle laborers in the commodity. Jamaica became an independent country in 1962. Reggae emerged in Jamaica in the late 1960s through the fusion of R&B and several Jamaican styles. The poor residents of Trenchtown, Kingston’s largest ghetto, listened to American music on the radio as well as the folk and dance music that were part of their everyday lives. Mento, a combination of R&B and European and African folk dance music, was popular in Jamaica in the early ‘50s. As the role of the bass became more important in the mento ensembles, a new style evolved in the early ‘60s called ska, reflecting the relatively peaceful and optimistic attitude of the times immediately following the country’s independence. Many of the early ska players, like Bob Marley and Peter Tosh, were later instrumental in shaping reggae. As a variety of social problems arose in the mid-’60s, young Jamaican musicians began writing more socially-conscious lyrics. At the same time, soul music from the U.S. grew increasingly popular. Through this combination of influences, ska developed into rocksteady. Rocksteady had a slower tempo than ska and electronic instruments (primarily electric guitar and bass), assumed a dominant role. Horns, common in ska, were used less often in rocksteady.\n\n3. afro-caribbean\n\n34\n\nThe first reggae recordings were made in the late ‘60s. In recordings like “Nanny Goat” by Larry Marshall and “No More Heartaches” by the Beltones, the tempos were slowed down even further than rocksteady and a new rhythmic approach appeared. Chris Blackwell, a producer who founded Island Records in Jamaica in 1960 and moved to England in 1962, was influential in the development and spread of reggae. The Wailers, a band formed by Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, and Bunny Wailer, first began as a ska band, and then produced recordings in the rocksteady style. Their first reggae record, The Best of the Wailers, was released in 1970. Reggae was popularized in the U.S. through the 1972 film The Harder They Come, featuring the music of Jimmy Cliff, and Eric Clapton’s hit recording of Bob Marley’s “I Shot the Sheriff” in 1974. Bob Marley is perhaps the best-known reggae artist, but a number of other Jamaican reggae musicians achieved some measure of commercial success, including Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh, Jimmy Cliff, the Abyssinians, Black Uhuru, and Toots and the Maytals.\n\nC\n\nalypso. The Caribbean island of Trinidad has a history somewhat different than the other Caribbean islands. Like Jamaica, Trinidad was originally colonized by Spain and later became a British colony. However, the Spanish colony on Trinidad never thrived. The island was sparsely populated by a few Spanish settlers and their slaves until the late 18th century when Spain made free land grants available to Roman Catholic settlers. Families from England, Scotland, Ireland, Germany, and Italy immigrated to the island. Later, at the time of the French Revolution, a number of French plantation owners and their slaves immigrated from Martinique and established a trade in sugar and cocoa. Trinidad became a British Crown colony in 1802 and Tobago became part of the colony in 1889. African slaves and workers from China, India, and Portugal were used to supply labor in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The cultivation and trade in cocoa dominated the economy until the Great Depression in the late ‘20s, after which oil became the principle export. Trinidad and Tobago became an independent nation in 1962 and became a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations in 1976. Like samba, calypso developed in the context of Carnival, which was brought to Trinidad by the French. Songs sung during the celebration of Carnival began being called “calypsos” around 1900. Calypso songs have their roots in the songs of Trinidad’s stickfighters and African-influenced folk song and dance. While slaves were often not allowed to talk while they worked, they could sing. Their songs, many with improvised lyrics, were often used as a way to spread news around the island (and to ridicule each other). Many of the early calypsos were sung in a French-Creole dialect called patois, the language used by many slaves in the 19th century. By the turn of the century, English had become the predominant language of calypso. The first calypso recordings were made early in the 20th century and became extremely popular. Competitions for calypso bands were held during Carnival and by the late 1920s calypso tents, where calypso musicians practiced and gave performances to prepare for the competitions, had become common. Beginning in the late ‘30s, a number of calypso musicians, including Lord Kitchener, Attila the Hun, Lord Invader, and Roaring Lion, achieved popularity in the international market. Calypso reached the height of its commercial success in the U.S. with the release of Harry Belafonte’s Calypso in 1956.\n\nEssential Grooves\n\nTrac\n\nck #\n\n35\n\nCalypso reached the height of its popularity outside of Trinidad in the late ‘50s and early ‘60s. By this time, the steelpan, a pitched percussion instrument made from an oil drum—a common piece of equipment in Trinidad’s petroleum industry—had been developed and refined. Extended calypso arrangements played by steelpan bands became common during Carnival. The rise in popularity of reggae in the early ‘70s eclipsed calypso as the dominant musical genre from the Caribbean. However, calypso continued to evolve. Influenced by soul and funk from the U.S., a new style of calypso evolved, called soca, through the work of artists like Lord Shorty, Shadow, and Blue Boy. Soca continues to be fused with other contemporary elements like rap, Jamaican dancehall, and East Indian music, creating genres (or offshoots) such as ragga-soca and chutney that have become vital to the music of the Caribbean.\n\nThe Grooves Track # Track #\n\nReggae\n\nBasic instrumentation: • One or more electric guitars. • Electric bass. • Piano, organ, or, less commonly, synthesizer. • Drumset. • Hand percussion, including bongos, shakers, claves, and shakers. • Lead vocal, often with background vocals. • Small horn section, typical trumpet, sax and trombone.\n\nHarmony: The chord progressions common in reggae are usually simple, repetitive patterns using just a few diatonic chords. Melody: Melodies are often simple and diatonic, sometimes with blues-inflections. Meter: Almost all reggae tunes are in 4/4 with either straight or swing eighth-notes. Tempos are usually fairly slow. Key rhythms: The rhythm guitar provides the most characteristic rhythm in reggae, a short, accented chord on the backbeat (beats 2 and 4). This rhythm is called the skank or the bang. The skank is often doubled by the keyboard. While the rhythm of the bassline varies depending on the song, the bass has a dominant role in the reggae groove. Skank or bang\n\nB-\n\nGuitar\n\n& 44 ..

Both gospel music and R&B have roots in the music of the African-American churches of the southern United States, particularly in the Mississippi Delta area. While the subject matter of R&B is secular and that of gospel music is sacred, the musical qualities of these two styles are markedly similar. Both have a strongly rhythmic quality, vocal call and response, vocal improvisation, and an intensity of emotional expression. Ray Charles, one of the first popular singers in the soul style, has said that some of his early soul tunes were very close to existing gospel songs, but the lyrics were slightly altered. For example, “Oh sweet Jesus” became “Oh sweet baby.” Beginning in the 1940s, there was a strong market for blues and gospel music among AfricanAmericans. Record labels like Chess, Atlantic, and Vee Jay all recorded and marketed black music, primarily to black audiences. In the ‘50s, black music began crossing over into white markets. Atlantic records, formed by Ahmet Ertegun and Herb Abramson in 1947, had a number of crossover hits in the mid-‘50s with artists like Ray Charles and La Vern Baker. In 1948, a young journalist named Jerry Wexler writing for Billboard magazine coined the term “rhythm and blues,” or R&B, to describe this new music, replacing the name “race music” that was used until that time. Wexler joined Atlantic Records as a producer in 1953 and brought a new and highly successful approach to record production. He took artists like Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, and Sam and Dave down south—to Stax Records in Memphis, Tennessee, and Fame Studios near Muscle Shoals, Alabama—to record. The music they recorded was called soul music. Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, and James Brown are perhaps the most famous artists to be associated with soul music in their early careers. The southern session players who recorded with these Atlantic artists came from a background\n\n4. soul and motown\n\n42\n\nof blues, gospel, C&W, and R&B. The Stax house rhythm section was a band called Booker T and the MGs, with Booker T. Jones on organ, Steve Cropper on guitar, Donald “Duck” Dunn on bass, and Alan Jackson on drums. They backed up many southern soul artists, like Wilson Pickett and Sam and Dave. Stax Records was originally named Satellite Records and during this period was distributed by Atlantic Records under Jerry Wexler. In Muscle Shoals, it was bassist David Hood and drummer Rogers Hawkins who supplied the grooves for the Atlantic artists. The work of these two rhythm sections essentially defined many of the grooves of soul music.\n\nM\n\notown. Another center for black music production was in Detroit. Berry Gordy formed his first record company in 1960 and by the late ‘60s his Motown Records, along with several subsidiary labels, was producing more hit records than any other record company in the U.S. One of Gordy’s most important artists was Smokey Robinson. While Robinson was known to the public as the lead singer of the group, The Miracles, he was also a talented songwriter and produced hit records for a number of other Motown artists, including the Temptations, the Marvelettes, Marvin Gaye, and Mary Wells. The songwriter/producer team of brothers Eddie and Brian Holland and Lamont Dozier was another important addition to the Motown production team. The team wrote and produced hit records with the Supremes, the Four Tops, the Miracles, Marvin Gaye, and Martha and the Vandellas. Stevie Wonder also started his career with Motown, as did Michael Jackson as a member of the Jackson 5. While the music of the Motown artists was coming from the R&B tradition, it had enormous crossover appeal and achieved tremendous commercial success in both R&B and pop markets. One of the keys to Motown’s success was the great session players who recorded with the large roster of Motown artists. Bassist James Jamerson essentially created a new style of bass playing on the recordings he made at Motown. The energy and linear sophistication of his basslines were a hallmark of the Motown sound and his style was widely imitated. Jamerson and drummer Benny Benjamin, known collectively as the Funk Brothers, created unique, profound grooves that provided the foundation for dozens of hits during the ‘60s and ‘70s. Soul music flourished until the mid-‘70s, when the black music scene began to change. By this time, a number of Atlantic-Stax artists had died or moved to other labels, and the partnership between the two labels ended. Many of the Motown artists had also moved on, though Gordy continued producing records until he finally sold the failing company in 1988. Disco music was becoming more and more popular and audience tastes were changing. The transition to funk had begun.\n\nEssential Grooves\n\n43\n\nThe grooves Basic instrumentation: • • • • • •\n\nDrumset. Electric bass (played with the fingers rather than a pick). Piano, Rhodes or Wurlitzer electric piano, or Hammond organ. Two electric guitars. Lead and background vocals. Sometimes sweetened with horns and strings.\n\nHarmony: The harmonic language of soul and Motown includes diatonic triads and 7th chords, with occasional chromatic chords such as secondary dominants and blues chords. Melody: While rhythm and harmony are important, soul and Motown tunes are melodicallydriven. Melodies tend to be diatonic, with frequent blues inflections.

The ghosted snare sixteenth-notes around the backbeat on 2 and 4. The displacement of the backbeat off of beat 4 in the first bar of the pattern. The emphasis on the “and” of three in the bass and kick drum in the first bar.\n\n4. soul and motown\n\n48\n\nEssential Grooves\n\n49\n\n5. funk Origins and Development As early as the 1950s, the term funk was used to describe the syncopated, danceable grooves of soul music and R&B. As a discrete style, however, funk emerged in the late ’60s and early ’70s through the combination of some of the rhythmic aspects of soul and R&B with a jazzlike approach to lines and solos. The harmonies of early funk were often based on extended, single-chord vamps with the different instruments of the band playing syncopated parts locked together in an intricate repeating patterns. The main innovator of funk was James Brown. While he started his career in the soul/ gospel tradition, he consciously left this approach behind to focus on the rhythm and groove. Brown’s biggest hit was his 1965 hit single, “I Got You (I Feel Good).” While the tune is based on a 12-bar blues like many soul and R&B tunes, the heavy funk groove is already present. By 1970, Brown’s tunes were characterized by extended one-chord vamps. The melodies were primarily rhythmic in nature, often involving call and response between Brown and the horn section or background singers. Brown was well-known for his rhythmic vocals sounds—grunts, screams, shouts, etc. Brown used a number of different players in his rhythm section, but the most influential drummers include Melvin Parker, who played on “I Got You (I Feel Good)” and Clyde Stubblefield, who played on the Brown classic, “Cold Sweat.” Bassist Bernard Odum played on both of these tunes. In the ’70s, Brown had perhaps his heaviest-grooving rhythm section with drummer John “Jab’o” Starks and bassist Bootsy Collins (who later played with P-Funk). Other bands contributed to the development of funk in the late ’60s. Between 1967 and 1969, Sly and the Family Stone released a series of albums that combined funk, R&B, and\n\n5. funk\n\n50\n\nrock. The band included Larry Graham, the bassist often credited with creating the slap bass technique. George Clinton, who had done some writing and producing for several Motown artists, including the Jackson 5 and the Supremes, formed his own funk band, The Parliaments, in 1964. After his record label folded, he re-formed the band under the name the Funkadelics. His highly idiosyncratic approach to production and performance of his band, often referred to as “P-Funk” or “Parliament-Funkadelics,” was widely influential in the early ’70s. In the city of New Orleans, European, Latin American, and African cultures mixed. The blending of European instruments and African rhythms and the tolerance of the French helped New Orleans generate an extensive amount of American music. The New Orleans band the Meters released funk/R&B albums of their own and also backed artists like Allen Toussaint, Dr. John, King Biscuit Boy, and Robert Parker. Some of the other names associated with New Orleans funk are Professor Longhair, the Neville Brothers, and Lee Dorsey. “Second line funk drumming” is an important type of funky drum groove that developed in New Orleans. Its roots are in the New Orleans marching or street bands and the second line groove reflects simple cadence, marching-band snare beats and patterns that were adapted to the drum set. This new funk style emerged when drummers like Zigaboo Modeliste and Johnny Vidacovich mixed second line with other syncopated rhythms. The second line funk drumming style that was popularized by the Meters and many other New Orleans bands often contains the 3-2 son clave. One famous groove that has this pattern is the so-called “Bo Diddley Beat.” Two ’70s bands, Tower of Power (TOP) and Earth, Wind, and Fire and played highly polished, sophisticated funk with tight arrangements. Earth, Wind, and Fire was known for carefully crafted vocal harmony and harmonically complex songwriting. Tower of Power’s music, similar in some ways to Earth, Wind, and Fire’s, featured complex horn-section writing with independent baritone sax lines reminiscent of early James Brown and New Orleans music. As funk became more popular, bands like Tower of Power took the style to a new and more intricate level. This refinement never took away from the feel and TOP are still masters of this genre after 40 years of performing. Drummer Dave Garibaldi and bassist Rocco Prestia created complex funk grooves typified by straight sixteenth-note drum parts (heavily influenced by the James Brown style of drumming) and intricate, syncopated basslines in the style of James Jameson. Many other artists released funk recordings throughout the ’70s, including Stevie Wonder, the Commodores, Gladys Knight and the Pips, the Ohio Players, and Michael Jackson. At the same time, funk was having a strong impact on jazz, and players like Herbie Hancock, Grover Washington, Cannonball Adderley, and Miles Davis were making records mixing funk grooves with jazz harmony and improvisation. Hancock’s albums Head Hunters (1973) and Thrust (1974) were enormously influential in both funk and jazz circles. Head Hunters was also a commercial success and was the first jazz album to go platinum. Funk remains a vital influence on pop music and is an important component of the styles of many artists. In addition, early funk recordings, particularly James Brown’s, have been heavily sampled by hip hop artists since the ’80s. As with other styles of popular black music, there has been a tendency for record companies to commercialize the recordings of funk artists and bands, often resulting in the loss of the essential roots of the style.\n\nEssential Grooves\n\n51\n\nThe grooves Basic instrumentation: • • • • • •\n\nDrumset. Electric bass (played with the fingers rather than a pick). Electric guitars (usually two). Keyboards, including synthesizer, in later versions. Lead and background vocals. Horns.\n\nHarmony: In early funk, chord progressions are usually limited to blues progressions or onechord vamps with a bridge and release. In later versions, the harmony can be more varied and jazz-influenced, including diatonic triads and 7th chords, chromatic chords like secondary dominants, blues chords, and borrowed chords (modal interchange). Melody: Funk melodies are often rhythmic in nature with a call-and-response approach between lead vocal and band. Vocal scats and screams are common. Meter: 4/4 is most common. Key rhythms: Usually a sixteenth-note groove with multi-layered parts connecting in various ways from a tight-to-loose approach. The downbeat of the measure, called “the one,” is an important focus. Drums play kick drum on beat 1 and snare on beat 2 with ghosted notes in the snare displaying the New Orleans march influence. Sixteenth-notes sometimes swing displaying the later influence of hip hop. Usually one guitar is more percussive (playing a “scratch” figure) and the other more melodic, but this approach can vary.\n\nTrack 22 q = 130\n\nC7\n\nGuitar\n\n4 & 4 ..

While this approach is similar to the samba bassline, there was probably no conscious intent for the bassline to display a Brazilian influence.\n\nTrack 23\n\nq = 100 Guitar\n\nBass\n\nDrums\n\n& 44 ? 44 / 44\n\nD 7. .\n\nSeventies Funk in the James Brown Style\n\nœ œ. œ . œ. .. ≈ œœ .. œœ # œœœ ... œœ ‰ œ œœ œ # # œœ œ J F D 7 >œ >œ .. œ œ œ ≈ œ^ œ œ œ œ F % > % >+ + + .. yœ œ y œy y œ y œ yœ œy œy œ Œ ‰ J ‰ J F 1\n\nœœ. .. ≈ œJ .\n\nœœ. œ\n\nœœ .. # œœ ..\n\nD7 œœ. œœ ‰ œ œœ ’ # # œœ œ\n\nSimile\n\n’ ’\n\n>œ ^ œ œœ œœ œ œ œ œ œ % >+ % >+ y œ y œy y œ y œ y œy y œ œ Œ ‰ œJ ‰ œJ ’Simile ’ ’\n\n’\n\n>œ\n\n2\n\n3\n\n’\n\n’\n\n’\n\n’\n\n2 « ’\n\n’\n\n.. ..\n\n’\n\n’\n\n’\n\n..\n\n4\n\nNotes on ’70s Funk (Track 23): • This groove is dominated by a swing sixteenth-note groove. • As in all funk grooves, the syncopations are strongly felt because the non-syncopated rhythms provide a rhythmic anchor. • The kick drum and snare patterns are syncopated, while the steady eighth-notes in the high hat provide a constant, non-syncopated background. • The “one” (the downbeat of the measure) in the bass and kick drum is the re-occurring focus of each measure. The absence of the beat 3 in the kick drum helps the groove float through the measure to again land on the “one” of the following measure. • The focus of the snare is the backbeats on 2 and 4, embellished by ghosted notes (reminiscent of New Orleans drum styles). • The guitar and bass parts accents are both on and off the beat, sometimes syncing up and playing the same accent (beat 2, the last sixteenth-note of beat 3, and the “and” of beat 4), and other times playing on different beats. The interplay between the bass and drum parts is similar.\n\nEssential Grooves\n\n53\n\n• The guitar acts as a balance to the groove by playing a combination of syncopated and non-syncopated rhythms. The 13-to-5 top-note voicings in the guitar are typical of James Brown’s ’70s style. • The static harmony, also typical of Brown’s grooves in the ’70s, can create a hypnotic, trance-like effect.\n\nTrack 24 Seventies Urban Funk\n\nq = 104\n\nGuitar 1\n\nGuitar 2\n\nE.

In addition, the band plays with more of an edge. • The swing is missing from the sixteenth-notes and the groove in general is less syncopated. • The eighth-notes in the high hat and the 2 and 4 backbeat in the snare give the drums more of a rock feel. • The rhythmic layers are tighter and the band connects in more ways. The two-measure phrase helps keep the groove interesting and the snare alone on 2 of the second measure helps add to the edge.\n\n5. funk\n\n54\n\nTrack 25 Straight Funk\n\nq = 84.5\n\nGuitar 1\n\nGuitar 2\n\nG7 44 ..

The snare, in particular, is reflective of the New Orleans marching band tradition. Note that unaccented notes in the snare are ghosted. • Every instrument operates in a two-measure phrase. • The layers above the drums are mostly concerted but the drums seem to generally groove on their own. This type of loose relationship between the drums and the other instrumental layers is typical of New Orleans funk.\n\n5. funk\n\n56\n\nTrack 27 Second Line Funk\n\nSwing 16ths, q = 88\n\nGuitar\n\nG7 > > > 4 ˚j . . ‰ ˚ . . j & 4 œ œœœœ œ œ bœ œ œ F œ œ œ\n\nOrgan\n\nG7\n\n.. . ‰. œœ ... œœ œ œ F ? 44 .. 4 &4\n\nG7\n\nBass\n\nDrums\n\n? 4 .. œ . œ 4 F > y y yy 4 / 4 .. œ . œ F\n\n˚j Œ œœ œ ∑\n\nœ> œ œ > bœ œ œ > > y y y y œ .œ œ œ œ . ≈J 1\n\n.\n\nj‰ œœ œ\n\nF .

Note that unaccented notes in the snare are ghosted. • The bassline syncs with the drums in various places, but its most important function is to provide a strong sixteenth-note pulse to anchor the groove. • The organ provides a rhythmic pad with sustained chords, while the syncopated rhythms and use of chromatic approach chords in the guitar reflects the James Brown influence that permeated funk during this time.\n\n5. funk\n\n58\n\nEssential Grooves\n\n59\n\n6. hip hop Origins and Development Hip hop is a cultural movement with many varied artistic and lifestyle aspects that emerged in the early ‘70s in New York City, particularly in the Bronx, Harlem, and Brooklyn. The music of hip hop, which includes rapping (also known as MCing) and DJing (creating music live with turntables, mics, and speakers), is arguably the most important and commercially visible expression of hip hop culture. However, there are a number of other aspects of hip hop culture that are also important, including graffiti art, b-boying (sometimes called breakdancing), and beatboxing (imitating percussion and other sounds by using the mouth and the body). Hip hop has also spawned a unique approach to fashion and developed its own spoken and written vocabulary. In its early stages, hip hop involved DJs creating rhythmic loops from soul, funk, R&B, and rock records using multiple turntables. They picked the drum breaks—short segments where the drums played a groove—from a wide variety of sources and created extended grooves from these short fragments. Finding obscure and hip breaks was an essential part of the DJ’s gig. In a later development, the MC rapped over the DJ’s groove. Jamaican-born DJ Kool Herc (Clive Campbell) is usually recognized as one of hip hop’s earliest innovators and his Bronx block parties are legendary in hip hop culture. A number of artists were responsible for bringing hip hop and rap out of New York and to the attention of the commercial music industry in the U.S. and, later, the rest of the world. The Sugar Hill Gang’s “Rapper’s Delight” (1979), arguably the first commercially released rap record, became a huge hit in 1980, going platinum and getting significant airplay in multiple markets. Afrika Bambaata’s widely influential 1982 album Planet Rock integrated synthesizers and electronic textures into hip hop.\n\n6. hip hop\n\n60\n\nBy 1985, hip hop had achieved world-wide popularity and a number of sub-styles of hip developed. The group Run DMC brought rap to the white audience with its 1986 album Raising Hell. The Beastie Boys, a white trio of rappers, had a number 1 album, License to Ill, in 1986. L.L. Cool J’s Bigger and Deffer (1987) also reached a wide audience, peaking at number 3 on the charts. Public Enemy’s Fear of a Black Planet (1990) brought “gansta” rap to a wide audience. Other more mainstream rappers also had hits in the ‘90s: M.C. Hammer (Stanley Burrell), Dr. Dre, Ice T, Easy-E MC Ren, Notorious B.I.G., and many others. Contemporary hip hop has mixed and fused with a wide variety of styles, including jazz, funk, rock, and world music. Hip hop is especially prevalent in R&B, which often mixes rap sections with more traditional R&B song forms.\n\nThe grooves Basic instrumentation: • Drums, either samples, sequenced, or recorded by a live drummer. A combination of these three is often used. • Bass, either a sequenced synth bass, samples of electric and acoustic bass, or recorded by a live player. • Electric guitar, sampled or recorded live. • Synthesizers, especially replicating “vintage” keyboards like the Fender Rhodes, Wurlitzer, RMI, Hammond organ, Hohner clavinet, and others. • Turntable is often present. • Vocals, both raps and lead and background sung vocals. • Samples, found sounds, and other unusual elements often provide a signature sound or hook for a particular track. Harmony: The harmonic language of hip hop uses many of the same chords and textures as the music from which it is based: soul, R&B, funk, rock, as well as various eclectic sources. Because of the collage-like production techniques, in which samples and loops from different sources are combined, hip hop tunes often have a somewhat loose approach to harmony, occasionally resulting in relatively greater dissonance than other contemporary popular music. Melody: The melodies and lines of hip hop resemble those of other contemporary pop styles. Meter: Most hip hop tunes are in 4/4, but other possibilities exist. Key rhythms: There is no one key rhythm of hip hop, but the backbeat is often part of the drum groove.\n\nEssential Grooves\n\nTrac\n\nck #\n\n61\n\nTrack 29 Hip Hop #1\n\nq = 92, Swing 16ths\n\nF #\\\n\nBÑ\n\nKeyboard\n\n& 44 .. # # www F ? 44 ..\n\nww\n\n∑\n\nBÑ\n\nBass\n\nDrums\n\nŒ\n\nœ œ\n\nŒ\n\n4 y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y / 4 .. œ œ . œ œ . œ œ œ œ œ œ . œ œ . œ œ œ œ ‰ J ≈ ‰ J ≈   1\n\nŒ Ó\n\n..\n\n∑\n\n..\n\n∑\n\nF #\\\n\n#œ nœ\n\nœœ\n\nww ##w\n\n∑\n\n? 44 .. œ œ ‰ . # œ˚jœ œ Œ F\n\nF #\\\n\nBÑ\n\n2\n\nBÑ\n\nœ œ ‰ . # œ˚jœ œ Œ\n\nF #\\\n\n#œ nœ\n\nŒ\n\nœ œ\n\nŒ\n\n..\n\ny y œy y y y œy y y y œy ‰ y œy y .. œ ‰. œ œ. œ ≈ œ œ œ Œ ‰. œ ≈œ œ J J 3\n\n4\n\nNotes on Hip Hop 1 (Track 29): • Notice the strong backbeat. This is characteristic of most hip hop. • The bass and drum track is a sampled loop: from a production standpoint the sample gives the track a gritty, urban quality. The bass has a dark sound with a lot of low frequencies, characteristic of hip hop. • Notice the turntable sample and the vintage Rhodes keyboard sound. • Notice the dissonance between the F natural in the bass against the F#7 chord in the keyboard.\n\nTrack 30 Hip Hop #2\n\nq = 92, Swing 16ths (Clavinet)\n\nKeyboard\n\nC]\n\n& 44 .. ≈ œ œœ b œ F ? 44 ..
