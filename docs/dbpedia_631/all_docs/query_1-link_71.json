The audience will have the opportunity to attend one unique performance: on October 25 at Union Chapel in London. 27 years after the passing of the author of \"Águas de Março,\" \"The Girl from Ipanema,\" or \"Insensatez,\" Stacey Kent and Danilo Caymmi celebrate in the best possible way the great songs of Tom Jobim. It is a meeting of cultures that celebrates, through the unique voices of Stacey Kent and Danilo Caymmi, the rich and wonderful musical universe of Tom Jobim.\n\nDanilo Caymmi, the youngest son of Dorival Caymmi, grew up very close to Tom Jobim due to his father's great friendship with Tom. At the age of 15, he participated in the album \"Caymmi visita Tom e leva seus filhos Nana, Dori e Danilo,\" and in 1983, he joined the Banda Nova, remaining with Tom until his death in 1994, serving as artistic director. It was through Tom Jobim himself that Danilo would eventually make his debut as a singer.\n\nStacey Kent needs no introduction, as she is one of the most respected and popular voices in contemporary jazz, who has never hidden her great admiration and fascination for Brazilian music. Named for a Grammy with the album \"Breakfast on the Morning Tram,\" winner of the BBC Jazz Awards, and appointed Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters of France, throughout her career Stacey Kent has sold over two million albums, reaching the top position in the charts of various countries.\n\nThis is a great opportunity to feel and relive great bossa nova classics with the sophistication and boldness of jazz in a concert that will deeply touch your emotions.\n\nPromoter: Backstage Productions Live\n\nBook For A Pre-Show Dinner\n\nMake your free dinner reservation to eat at our Margins Café before the show!\n\nYou must have a general admission ticket for the show to gain entry for dinner.\n\nDoors will open for early dinner ticket holders at 18:00.\n\nThe Margins Café serves delicious, freshly prepared food at gigs and events.
