        "text": "This week's service featured quite a bit of special music, so that has been included in this episode of the podcast for all the enjoy! We started with a special Opening Voluntary, with Marian Steed, soprano, singing “O Gracious Light” in an arrangement by Dorothy Papadakos that features a Whale Recording by Dr. Roger Payne. The unpublished music setting by Dorothy Papadakos offers us the opportunity hear the voice of the whale in the vastness of the ocean. The text (Phos Hilaron) from Ancient Greek praises the light that shines on all creation. Biologist and environmentalist Dr. Roger Payne (1935-2023) is famous for his discovery of whale songs while researching and recording humpback whales. The Phos Hilaron, Gladdening Light, is a Greek song of devotion and prayer. Dorothy Papadakos, Juilliard trained, has served as organist of St. John the Divine in New York City and also worked with Paul Winter. “O Gracious Light” was commissioned for the 60th Anniversary of the Alston Memorial Organ at St. Luke's Episcopal Church in Atlanta, GA, and dedicated to Paul Winter. Papadakos has graciously allowed Dawn McCord to adapt “O Gracious Light (With Whales)” for our worship today. Marian Steed collaborated on the adaptation of the choral score; Jim Leake and Jeff Williams contributed significant time to sound production. The scripture reading came from Jonah 3:1-10, followed by the rest of the song \"Jonah and the Whale\" as a scripture response. This week's response was lead by Kathy Roberts, Joanna Sherer, and Henry Roberts, who also sang an anthem earlier in the service. Verse 3 In the cold and briny deep Tears of grief did Jonah weep, And prayed a prayer that God his skin might save; Three long days and three long nights Jonah bargained for his life. God delivered him to shore from a watery grave! Chorus Over there, In that land both bright and fair, Oh, he'll tell me all about it over there. On the hallelujah strand God will take me by the hand, And he'll tell me all about it over there! Verse 4 Toward the Ninevites he still felt mean– Didn't want God's grace to intervene– So he preached the shortest sermon ever spoke. But wouldn't you know it, the Word took hold; Like a fire can't be controlled! Away from evil turned the king and all his folk!\n\nOn this episode we talk to the purveyors of Little Lost Records in Stafford Springs, CT. Musical folks looking to spread their love of music in the North East corner of CT opened their store just about a year ago. Conor and Abbie discuss meeting through their connection to Paul Winter! Through that connection they opened this new store. Randy (previously on our podcast in 2017 as a member of the band Cable) visited their shop opening day and quickly became a regular and soon partner! Listen to all the details on this episode! We talk about the music we're listening to. We talk about the music they make outside of the shop. We talk about the music that happens in their shop! We talk about the music made by another shopkeep, Ian of Records the Good Kind (check out his episode on the podcast here and his musical project, The Aspersions here and his previous group Musical Chairs here). We talk about the town of Stafford Springs and what they'd like to see move in to their town. We go off in a few directions. Take a listen!

Singer-songwriter-guitarist Crispian Mills & drummer Paul Winter-Hart excitedly lay out the 15 super-cool albums that made them who they are today. In this episode, we discuss: The ace up Crispian's sleeve when he's stuck on how to work his way out of a guitar break; The album he refers to as “secret ingredient X for Kula Shaker”; And Crispian's vote for the greatest psychedelic song of all time. If you're a Kula Shaker superfan like me, you'll want the DIRECTOR'S CUT of this episode.

Paul is an independent historian, an author who specializes in wartime intelligence and military history, and a Red Team consultant. He's published articles in several journals and has written two books about World War II called D Day Documents and Defeating Hitler, as well as a third book called First In, Last Out, The Post War Organization, Employment, and Training of Royal Marines Commandos. He has also been an affiliated academic with the British Royal Marines, assisting with professional military education and officer career development, and was a member of the Land and Littoral Strike Team at the Maritime Warfare Center in Portsmouth in the United Kingdom. Today, Paul discuses a subject he has previously taught a course on: the Cambridge Five, arguably the most famous spiring of the Cold War. They were a group of men who did an astonishing amount of damage to British Intelligence and the Foreign Office, and all of them were recruited while studying at Cambridge University in their youth.Connect with Paul:IG: @drpaulwinterConnect with Spycraft 101:Check out Justin's latest release, Covert Arms, here.spycraft101.comIG: @spycraft101Shop: spycraft-101.myshopify.comPatreon: Spycraft 101Find Justin's first book, Spyshots: Volume One, here.Download the free eBook, The Clandestine Operative's Sidearm of Choice, here.A podcast from SPYSCAPE.A History of the World in Spy Objects Incredible tools and devices and their real-world use.Support the show\n\nPeter May received a Bachelor of Science in architecture from the University of Michigan in 1988. In 1990, he began consulting on, designing, and building passive solar and bioharmonic structures. He is a meditation teacher, triathlete, natural alchemist, fire manager, wilderness guide, and Grammy award winning producer and musician. He teaches Conservation Biology and Spirituality at Colorado College. His work with Paul Winter and Richard Cooke on the album “Crestone”, which received a Grammy award in 2008, helped him refine his art of playing and recording music with animals out in nature. His current work is expanding to playing and recording music with the plant and mineral kingdoms. He has also been facilitating Paul Winter's Adventures in SoundPlay sessions since 2006 and sound journeys since 2008. In 2006, Peter began distilling essential oil from several native Rocky Mountain plant species. He continues this distillation art and produces one of the finest piñon pine (Pinus edulis) oils in the world. Peter creates acoustically tuned plant and mineral alchemies with essential oils and offers them in his Sound Journeys to support increased awareness and healing on the levels of body, energy, and mind. His new endeavor in creating sonic alchemies is available through his nature fusion band, The Sonic Apothecary.

He not only rode the folk wave of the early 1960s with such indelible songs like \"Puff the Magic Dragon,\" \"If I Had a Hammer\" and helping popularize a young Minnesotan bard who went by the stage name of Bob Dylan, but helped created it. He shares the iconic trio's origin story as well as his own, and the many memories of a life, well lived, in music. Peter, Paul & Mary's long, legendary career was cut short with Mary Travers' tragic death in 2009, but their place in the cultural zeitgeist is eternal. Noel, a part-time Ojai resident, joins us to talk about his new album, \"Fazz: Now & Then\" and to reflect on the experience of collaborating with fellow musicians during the pandemic to create this nuanced, wide-ranging collection of 20 original songs with talented musicians such as Kent Palmer, Paul Winter, Paul Sullivan, David LaPlante and Edward Mottau. Fazz, as Noel explains, was christened by Paul Desmond of the Dave Brubeck Quartet to explain Peter, Paul & Mary's distinct fusion of jazz and folk. Noel picks up the resident Ojai podcast guitar (be still, my heart) to explain the shadings of alternate chord structures that inform much of the color of the album, as illustrated by the A Major, and the A Major 7th, its \"smoky, mysterious cousin.\" Noel talks about writing \"The Wedding Song: There is Love\" - for Peter Yarrow's wedding, and his reluctance to perform it again until urged by Peter, and how it has made many, if not most, of the lists of most beautiful songs of all time, right up there with fellow Ojai resident Amanda McBroom's \"The Rose.\" He also discusses his Christian faith and the epiphany he had at age 30 after a decade of fame, and the toll it took on his well-being. There's relevant folk music news: Noel's good friend John McCutcheon just released “Ukraine Now.” We did not talk about Ron DeSantis' fading aspirations, the Buffalo Bills abysmal overtime record or the enduring mystery of who ordered the hit on Tupac Shakur.\n\nPeter May is an alchemist, a Grammy award-winning musician, a tree whisperer, a firefighter (and firemaker), an athlete, an architect, and an all around fascinating human being. Peter and I discuss how his love of ecology first developed as a kid living outside Detroit on Lake St. Clair, and how this passion later influenced almost every aspect of his life. From his multiple careers in natural building, native permaculture, sustainable landscape design, and land management, to helping produce and create a Grammy-award winning album with Paul Winter, to the creation of E3 Ecologic, a Crestone-based ecological nonprofit, it's hard not to be inspired by Peter's dedication to following a path dedicated to holism, intuition, and shameless curiosity.Find Peter May at windhorsealchemy.com, and e3ecologic.orgSongs featured: “Awaken and Allow” by Shannon Lay and “Woods Rose and Evening Primrose” by The Sonic ApothecaryJoin myself and Christopher Ryan + Cameron and Melayne Shayne in Montana this summer for the 2023 Sex at Dawn Retreat, August 20-25.

Produced in collaboration with local communities and local scriptwriters, these shows share a common thread in that the audience are invited to consider positive family planning decisions through the role modelling of engaging and identifiable characters. PGAP was very fortunate to be joined by special guest Bill Ryerson (https://www.populationmedia.org/people/william-ryerson-mphil), President and Founder of PMC. He talks us through the ‘stories behind the stories' of PMC's many award winning and popular projects. PGAP would like to give a shout out to Paul Winter (https://paulwinter.bandcamp.com/?src=email_link2), who is not only on the program advisory board at PMC, but is also a Grammy winning saxophonist, whose music is inspired by the cultures and creatures of planet Earth. He kindly shared the track ‘Talkabout' for this episode of PGAP, which we played an extract from after Bill's interview. We would also like to give a shout-out to Cody Peluso (https://www.populationmedia.org/people/cody-peluso), Digital Advocacy & Mobilization Manager at PMC, without whom this episode would not have been possible. PGAP co-host Michael Bayliss interviewed Cody for a recent edition of the Sustainable Population Australia (SPA) newsletter (https://population.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Feb-SPA-150.pdf). SPA kindly supports PGAP and we encourage you to consider giving SPA a donation (https://population.org.au/donate/) for their end of financial year donation appeal. PMC kindly provided an excerpt from the Hulu series ‘East Los High', courtesy of Hulu, that we played at the start of this episode. A trailer for the series can be viewed on YouTube here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQnXknnCdoc). We hope you will join PMC in celebrating their 25th anniversary. There are many events lined up, including their Zoom birthday party, held on Zoom on the 15th of June, which you can RSVP here (https://populationmedia-org.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZckcuqqqDksH9dPOk5QqBmQ4yFufDT1JSrT?utm_medium=email&_hsmi=261340862&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8c1MKvoihjFYez5RIgNY_e-JAtwz6TP64-Ys4QfmPdlSm9KYSyTPnirf5azcmoTzXyM8yxJdhMwYN2gRhEPjTuAbbfEdaZpU0ceUn6A-Hvm1U9E6U&utm_content=261210068&utm_source=hs_email#/registration). Unfortunately for Australian listeners, this is well after midnight for us so perhaps one for the night owls. Otherwise you can keep track of PMC's activities on their website here (https://www.populationmedia.org/). Otherwise, please check out PMC's award winning podcast, Crossing the Line (https://ctlpod.com/). Excellent stuff. While PMC celebrate their 25th anniversary, PGAP will be taking a very short break. This is the last episode of season 4 of Post-Growth Australia Podcast. We made some changes to the format of this podcast, including welcoming co-host Mark Allen.

Special Guest: Bill Ryerson.\n\nDavid Rothenberg is a writer, philosopher, ecologist, and musician, speaking out for nature in all aspects of his diverse work. He investigates the musicality of animals and the role of nature in philosophy, with a particular interest in understanding other species by making music with them. As a professor of philosophy and music at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, he “teaches engineers nonquantifiable things.” He is also an acclaimed composer and jazz clarinetist known for his integration of world music with improvisation and electronics. Originally intending to be a scientist, music pulled Rothenberg away during his high school years – ultimately becoming the modality through which he would explore nature and deep ecology. Looking back at those high school years of the 1970s, Rothenberg told The New York Times, \"I was influenced by saxophonist Paul Winter's Common Ground album, which had his own compositions with whale and bird sounds mixed in. That got me interested in using music to learn more about the natural world.\" As an undergraduate at Harvard, Rothenberg created his own major to combine music with communication. He traveled in Europe after graduation, playing jazz clarinet. Listening to the recorded song of a hermit thrush, he heard structure that reminded him of a Miles Davis solo. Because of Rothenberg's study of animal song and his experimental interactions with animal music, he is often called an \"interspecies musician.\" He is said to \"explore the sounds of all manner of living things as both an environmental philosopher and jazz musician.\" Rothenberg's book Why Birds Sing: A Journey into the Mystery of Bird Song (Basic Books 2005) was inspired by an impromptu duet in March 2000 with a laughingthrush at the National Aviary in Pittsburgh. A CD accompanying the book also featured Rothenberg's duet with an Australian lyrebird. The book served as the basis for a 2006 feature-length BBC documentary of the same name. His next book, Thousand Mile Song (Basic Books 2008), reflects similar curiosity about whale sounds considered as music, from which both scientific and artistic insights emerge. It was turned into a film for French television. Philip Hoare of The London Telegraph said of the book, \"while Rothenberg's madcap mission to play jazz to the whales seems as crazy as Captain Ahab's demented hunt for the great White Whale, it is sometimes such obsessions that reveal inner truths...I find myself more than a little sympathetic to the author's faintly bonkers but undoubtedly stimulating intent: to push at the barriers between human history and natural history.\" His book Survival of the Beautiful: Art, Science and Evolution (Bloomsbury Press 2011) was described by the journal Nature as exploring the theme that beauty is not random but is intrinsic to life—and that evolution proceeds by sumptuousness, not by utility alone. His remarkable output in books is matched by his creative output in other areas. As a composer and jazz clarinetist, Rothenberg has sixteen CDs out under his own name over the past 30 years. His 2020 releases include In the Wake of Memories and They Say Humans Exist, named best jazz album of the year by Stereo+ Magazine in Norway. He has performed or recorded with Peter Gabriel, Pauline Oliveros, Ray Phiri and Suzanne Vega. As a musician, Rothenberg tries to blend the indigenous energy of the world's primal music with the exploratory spirit of improvisation. He has studied jazz clarinet professionally, as well as Tibetan ritual wind music in Nepal and folk music in Norway. Since 2014, Rothenberg has been an Ambassador of the international non-governmental humanitarian mission, the Dolphin Embassy, participating in non-invasive research of the possibilities of free dolphins and whales – playing music for them. In 2017, the Dolphin Embassy released the full-length documentary Intraterrestrial, which received awards from international film festivals. The film's soundtrack features music by Rothenberg. Links to his extensive work, global press coverage, and extended recognition can be found on his website. Please join us in conversation with this remarkable philosopher and interspecies musician who combines art and science to make nature come alive in remarkable ways!\n\n#TheRookieFeds is a new hit show focusing on law enforcement, with a twist! From the creator of #TheRookie, this series spinoff focuses on #NiecyNashBetts (Simone) and her journey becoming an FBI agent in her late forties. Having a show like this - with a little bit of everything - focusing on a Black woman is not something that's often seen. And, of course, Niecy and Frankie bring a great deal to their roles as father and daughter with opposing views of law enforcement professionals. Not only is the show action-packed and funny, it is also heartwarming. In this interview, they share their thoughts on what it takes to make this series and the characters shine, from behind the scenes to in front of the camera. And not to mention, #NashBetts is getting well-deserved accolades for not only this, but the harrowing #Dahmer with #EvanPeters and #RyanMurphy. Both are well worth the watch, for obviously different reasons. Interestingly, the two show her characters on opposite sides as well - one as a caring enforcer of the law, and the other as a frustrated citizen trying to do the right thing but being ignored by officers.

He broadcasted his talk radio show “The Paul Winter Show” from 1965 until late 1969 or early 1970 on WTAK in Detroit, during which time he covered the race riots among other subjects, and this was his final farewell program before he moved to a different radio station in Minneapolis. You will hear him talk and banter with familiar callers who read him poems and say goodbye, and he sings two songs that are very personal to him. From a retrospective booklet by the Detroit radio station WJR: “[The Paul Winter Show] is a collage of Broadway and film music, reviews of plays, books, historical events, fashion, fancy, human foibles and almost anything else that come into a brilliant, concerned and creative mind. One day, he may launch a metaphorical balloon to honor the ‘Mad Montogofier Brothers,' or he may build an entire show around the far from dignified Elizabethan theatre, or comedy features drawn from his inventive and bizarre sense of humor.” I do not think this recording is available anywhere else, and is a record of an era of talk radio that has evolved beyond recognition. I found this among his collection of 1/4” tape reels which my great-aunt Marilyn kept after he died, along with his old Sony-o-Matic tape machine which I used to play the tape and record it digitally. His voice emerging from his own tape machine is a brief and stirring resurrection. My original recording was 26 minutes long. I have edited it down to 20 minutes to fit the submission requirements, cutting an excerpt from a Nichols and May album, part of “Manjā De Carnaval”, and commercials, which can all be found elsewhere.
