        "text": "Dear Mendes fans,\n\nSergio Mendes played on a few recordings by other artists.\n\nHe played with his Bossa Rio Sextet in 1962 on 2 records with the\n\ngreat alto-sax jazz legend Cannonball Adderley.\n\nHe appears (I’m not quite sure about this but have a Philips compilation from the ’70s, the credits mentioned ’Felicidade: Antonio Carlos Jobim and Sergio Mendes’.) on Felicidade by Antonio Carlos Jobim, The Warner Bros recording the ‘Wonderous world of Antonio Carlos Jobim’.\n\n‘The sound of Ipanema’ from 1964, a wonderful recording with compositions by Bossa Nova pioneer Carlos Lyra. With Alto sax player Paul Winter, Sebastiao Neto, Bass, Milton Banana, drums, Carlos Lyra, acoustic guitar and vocals and Sergio on piano.\n\nSergio played synthesizers on the 1978 Elektra recording ‘Nightingale’\n\nby Gilberto Gil along with (and amongst others) Don Grusin Keyboards, Lee Ritenour, Michael Sembello and Oscar Castro Neves guitars.\n\nHe also played synthesizer on the song ‘Velho Piano’ with vocals by Nana Cyammi on the Elektra-Musician recording US recording debut by the great composer/guitarist Dori Caymmi. Sergio produced both above mentioned recordings.\n\nFinally he played keyboards on the record Kevyn Lettau in 1990 on one song, the Milton Nascimento composition ‘Bridges’. Sergio and Kevyn played a vocal/keyboard duet.\n\nAs far as i know thats all that I know about Sergio’s apearrance on other artists recordings. Maybe you know more recordings,\n\nAll the best!\n\nAqua do Brasil\n\nAqua do Brasil said:\n\nSergio Mendes played on a few recordings by other artists.\n\nHe played with his Bossa Rio Sextet in 1962 on 2 records with the\n\ngreat alto-sax jazz legend Cannonball Adderley.\n\nTwo records? Though it has been released in a number of labels(Riverside,Capitol,Landmark via Fantasy),under a few different titles(e.g.-\"Cannonball's Bossa Nova\",\"Cannonball Goes Latin\")I am only aware of one recording,the Dec. 1962 New York recording with the additonal takes for 45RPM added to some of the releases. What am I missing? Mac"
