        "text": "Taken by permission from Alex Lefaivre website\n\nEdited by Toni Basanta\n\nALEX LEFAIVRE is a bassist, composer and pedagogue based in Montreal. HE is a founding member of the Parc X Trio, winners of the TD Grand Prize for Jazz at the Festival de Jazz de Montréal (2010) that have produced 7 recordings.\n\nHE is also a founding member of Multiple Chord Music (MCM), a jazz label which has released over 50 recordings from local artists such as Gentiane MG & Frank Lozano, Benjamin Deschamps, Rachel Therrien, Rémi-Jean LeBlanc, Joel Miller, François Jalbert & Jérôme Beaulieu.\n\nAs a solo artist, LEFAIVRE released YUL (2018). Taking its name from Montreal’s airport code, Alex takes the listener on a cinematic trip through the city, where dreamy, hazy summer vibes are intertwined with a gritty, metropolitan edge. It received critical acclaim and has been described as a terrific amalgamation of modernity and tradition, deploying a mature and cohesive musical vision, performed by a QUARTET which displays a wide variety of textures with a enthralling and lilting vigor.\n\nThe line-up: Eric Hove (alto sax), Nicolas Ferron (guitar), Mark Nelson (drums) and Alex Lefaivre (bass).\n\nAlex is also a rising star as a media composer, scoring a variety of projects amongst which many are part of his home province’s comedy scene. His music can be heard on Mariana Mazza’s Maria, her full-length feature to be released in theatres August 21st 2021 as well as various web series featuring Rosalie Vaillancourt such as the upcoming Complètement Lycée (Winter 2022), Rosalie: La Comédie Musicale (Fall 2020) as well as Le Killing seasons 1 & 2.\n\nHE is currently a Technopedagogical counselor & Instructor at l’École de musique Vincent-d’Indy, in Montréal.\n\nAs a sideman, he has shared the stage and recorded with a wealth of local artists such as Michelle Sweeney, Joel Miller, Aliocha, Klo Pelgag, Kalmunity as well as co-writing with artists such as Sonia Johnson.\n\nOn August 27th 2021, he released his sophomore Quartet album entitled Naufragés (“Castaways”), featuring Erik Hove on alto saxophone, Nicolas Ferron on guitar and Alain Bourgeois on drums.\n\nAbout the new album\n\nNaufragés (“Castaways”), the new album which was released on August 27th 2021 is firmly rooted in jazz presents a mix of 5 original compositions as well as 3 covers that reflect Alex’s contemporary aesthetic and visceral tone.\n\nAfter many failed attempts at scheduling the recording due to the various strict lockdown measures brought upon by the COVID 19 pandemic, the group finally managed to get together at Montreal’s Studio Madame Wood on April 5th 2021.\n\nRecorded over the course of 2 spontaneous sets of music, the listener can feel the urgency and sheer joy erupting out of Alex and his bandmates Erik Hove, alto saxophone, Nicolas Ferron on guitar and Alain Bourgeois on drums. The session was recorded and mixed by Simon L’Espérance and was mastered by Alex himself.\n\nNaufragés’ eclectic and cinematic contemporary jazz style features echoes of punk, disco, Film Noir and even reggae, which gives it a biting energy that oscillates freely between brute, rough textures and refined, graceful moments while leaving lots of room for the musicians to stretch.\n\nIt features three covers; Time of the Barracudas – the album opening (by Miles Davis, Gil Evans), a relatively obscure modal jazz standard; Immigrant Song by Led Zeppelin, (closing track) symbolisation the pure, raw energy of Rock & Roll and the theme song to Passe-Partout by Pierre F. Brault, a popular children’s TV show in Quebec which first aired in 1977 and is still going on today.\n\nThe album cover art was created by Les Microcosmes, the alter-ego of French-Canadian actress Daphnée Côté-Hallé.\n\nAfter meeting through a web series they had both been a part of on, Alex was captivated by her body of work as a visual artist. SHE suggested he used one of her latest works entitled Naufragés (Castaways) which perfectly embodied his feelings during the pandemic, with it’s long, secluded, drifting stretches followed by a celebratory yet slow return to back to firm ground.\n\nMy Comment\n\nI saw Alex Lefaivre Quartet last Saturday July 9 a La Place Tranquille as part of the Montreal International Jazz Festival 2022, edition 42. I am glad to have found such a friendly musician and human being and since that day on I’ll be hosting his music from his two albums YUL released in 2018, and Naufragés (Castaways) released three years after.\n\nI will be forever grateful to the talented musical contributions of ALEX LEFAIVRE and his bandmates!\n\nHost: Toni Basanta\n\nThe Cuban Bridge on the radio at WWPV 92.5 FM “The Mike”, Saint Michael’s College campus radio\n\nwwpv.smcvt.edu\n\nHavana Fairfax Connection on television\n\nhttp://www.LCATV.ORG\n\nhttp://lcatv.org/havana-fairfax-connection\n\nBoth in Colchester, Vermont, USA.\n\nI had a great time in Montreal from Wednesday July 6 to this morning (Sunday July 10).\n\nI watched two amazing live shows with The Manhattan Transfer Vocal Quartet and their band at Theatre Maisonneuve on Thursday, and last night at The Monument-Nationale the unequal RANEE LEE in the presentation of her album BECAUSE YOU LOVE ME (Justin Time Records, 2022).\n\nThe Opening Act for Mrs. Lee, – trumpet maestro Ron DiLauro – responded to his roots with Italian Music, and his two sidemen (piano and guitar), were the perfect fit for the night.\n\nSongs like “Non Dimenticar” (a Nat King Cole Super Hit), and “Volare” (premiered in the jazz world by Oscar Peterson) received ovations.\n\nMr. Di Lauro, also had a guest, saxophonist Federico Milone to play another Italian Classic from the Naples Songbook “O Sole Mio”.\n\nRANEE LEE’S album will be in my radio show next Sunday July 17, after 4 pm.\n\nThe 42nd Edition of the FIJM, was a good reason to discover several bands and make new friends:\n\nDrummer Larner Lewis from Toronto, who is already in my TV show HAVANA FAIRFAX CONNECTION as a sideman of Montreal LAILA BIALI.\n\nLarner Lewis and Joy Lapps, have 2 incredible projects. I could see them both, at Le Studio TD and La Place Tranquille.\n\nA La Place Tranquille, I could also admire Dan Wilson, Alex Lefaivre Quartet, Cochemea, Connie Han Trio, and Takuya Kuroda.\n\nI interviewed Montreal bass player and composer Lefaivre, and he gifted me his two CDs, which I’ll host on my radio show THE CUBAN BRIDGE.\n\nEvery morning in my Hotel Room, I Googled those acts that were unknown to me, and now I have a new favorite: jazz vocalist Laura Anglade. All her Songs on YouTube are simply a treasure!\n\nA Les Spectacles Blues @ Rogers, I saw and filmed the Ghost Town Blues Band on an electrifying display of incendiary Blues Burners! What a band*****.\n\nOn Friday, I saw and filmed vibist Jeremie Carrier leading his Quintet at Club Montreal TD.\n\nJeremie is an alumni of my friend Rafael Zaldivar, an awarded Cuban-Canadian pianist-percussionist-composer-academician who is leading Jeremie and the singer of his band at the University of Laval. We had time to hang and talk.\n\nA La Serie Jazz Fest Des Jeunes, I loved “Le Big Band Du Cegep De St. Laurent”. They are the legends of tomorrow, and a reason why the whole world wants to continue enjoying the Big Band Sounds!\n\nGreat soloists at a tender age!\n\nI bought a ticket to see the sensational Pink Martini a La Salle Wilfrid-Pelletier. Any Hall in North America can be small to the impact of their bright repertoire. Cabaret style at its best!\n\nLa Premiere Partie couldn’t be better with pianist Amanda Tossoff feat. songstress Emilie-Claire Barlow!.\n\nAnd last but not least, my first steps in Montreal on Wednesday July 6, were to see Nick Cave The Exhibition.\n\nI am already organizing my liner notes for my radio show THE CUBAN BRIDGE @ WWPV 92.5 FM “The Mike” (St. Michael’s College campus station) next Sunday July 17 at 4 PM.\n\nFor streaming: wwpv.smcvt.edu\n\nOn TV, in my HAVANA FAIRFAX CONNECTION at LCATV Channel 1075 in Colchester, Vermont, there will be some great new episodes as well! For streaming, reachable 24 hours a day in the 7 continents\n\nLCATV.org and\n\nhttp://lcatv.org/havana-fairfax-connection\n\nThere are two episodes footage of my visits to the FIJM. And one with collaborations of Montreal born based artists like Laila Biali, Dawn Tyler Watson, Marilyn Lerner and El Trabuco de Montreal.\n\nIn my 2 TV Channels, (Richmond and Colchester) I have hosted two photo expositions, among the pictures many Artists “Caught In The Act” during my visits to Montreal since 2013.\n\nDue to the quality of the music and the musicians involved in our productions, Havana Fairfax Connection has received two Global Awards 2020 and 2022 Television Hosting Musical Programming.\n\nYou can also find other publications in My Blog: cubanbridge.wordpress.com\n\nLet’s stay in touch, I’ll be back in 2023.\n\nToni Basanta, the Cuban-American DJ who brings new beats to the 7 continents via Vermont airwaves since 2006.\n\nPictured: pic of the Fest in 2015 (it’s gorgeous!).\n\nTo learn more about the Festival Interantionale de Jazz de Montreal feel welcomed to visit their website: http://www.montrealjazzfest.com\n\nWho is MELANIE SROKA ?\n\nThe Siren and The Waves is the brainchild of singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist Melanie Sroka.\n\nPictured: Melanie Sroka in white with Earth Tribe Singers.\n\nLET’S FOLLOW MELANIE SROKA’S STORY IN HER OWN VOICE :\n\n“I am from Springfield Massachusetts. Went to Westfield State College for Music Education, where I was the featured singer with the Westfield State College Big Band.\n\nI have played and performed in a multitude of music groups including The Black Rebels, Gaia Roots Rhythm, Abdul Bali and New Scatmanduu, Shokazoba, The Dark Star Project, and Soulstice; which is everything from America’s GRATEFUL DEAD music to the exhilarating sounds of FELA KUTI from Nigeria, combining Reggae, Jazz and beyond.\n\nI also sang back up vocals for 60’s Soul singer Betty Harris.\n\nI lived on the island of MARTHA’S VINEYARD for 10 years, where I played weddings, dinner music, cocktail hours, as well as worked on my own original songwriting.\n\nI was also the lead in Island Theater Workshops rendition of “I Sent a Letter to my Love” written by Pop Star Melissa Manchester.\n\nI moved to Vermont greatly inspired by Senator BERNIE SANDERS.\n\nSanders and the great beauty of Vermont’s breathtaking mountains, lakes, and streams.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Justice issues are very close to my heart. It was a very special event.\n\nThe last concert I arranged on Martha’s Vineyard was a benefit for the “Water Protectors” of The Standing Rock Protest in which my group ” The Earth Tribe Singers” joined forces with local legends such as James Taylor’s sister Kate, Jemima James, The Wampanoag Black Brook Singers, & Willy Mason, and Evan Dando from the Lemon Heads.\n\nWe raised $10,000 from that one event, and it was a beautiful powerful gathering where the locals and Wampanoag people worked and performed together in community. It was also a very special event.\n\nPresently, I have been firmly focused on my songwriting and my website thesirenandthewaves.com has some listening examples. Struck by Vermont landscape, I am looking to Lake Champlain’s health for inspiration !\n\nMY COMMENT AFTER OUR Q & A\n\nNow, we are proud to say that MELANIE moved with her family to Vermont and lives in Monkton Ridge, very near us.\n\nTHE SIREN AND THE WAVES is the title to a multitude of musical configurations all circling around MELANIE as vocalist and as instrumentalist.\n\nSHE is able to put together solo ceremony music or larger dancing music groups to accomplish the atmosphere you are trying to create.\n\nFor music to walk down the isle to, then grooving at the party afterward, The Siren and the Waves has all your ceremony and entertainment music covered !\n\nIn our TV show, we agreed to make it simple; just MELANIE with her guitar and her piano, and the results exceeded expectations from our MMCTV Team.\n\nFor the final Song of this new episode, we listened to albums by several pianists: Ramona Borthwick, Mario Canonge with Ultramarina, and Hiromi, composers whose works include Songs related to Mother Nature, and we decided to close our show with the music of Brazilian Maestro Antonio Adolfo.\n\nFrom his album “Tema”, we selected “Sao Paulo Express”, as I know now, how much MELANIE loves the environment, the nature, the ocean, the islands, the Caribbean Connection, and a lot more, this song sold the whole ticket.\n\nOn this “EXPRESS”, we toured the amazonic giant, and other South American nations.\n\nABOUT THE BRAZILIAN MAESTRO\n\nSome of the musical ideas on ANTONIO ADOLFO’s album TEMA are from his early days back in the 1960s, and / or partnerships from different moments, that now he has redeveloped with new harmonies, bridges and chords.\n\nWe are also proud to host ANTONIO ADOLFO and his Golden Men of Brazilian Jazz, with whom he has been playing for more than a decade now.\n\nMARCELO MARTIN’s soprano sax is the voice on “Sao Paulo Express” a smoldering piece on locomotive Baiao driven with solos by Leonardo Amuedo and Claudio Spiwak on guitars, riveting Adolfo’s piano and soaring Martin’s soprano.\n\nLast but not least, we are really glad to quote what other people are talking about MELANIE’s music.\n\nFeatured Reviews\n\n“We were so happy with our choice to have Melanie play for our ceremony at the Allen Farm. Her music was ethereal and brought our party to a whole new level of magic! She was flexible, patient, and professional. We highly recommend her.\n\nAmanda & Rich Saltzberg\n\nThe Siren & the Waves, featuring: Melanie Sroka & Friends, is not to be missed!”\n\n​ The Ritz, Martha’s Vineyard\n\nThank you sooo much for playing our wedding !!! Your music and energy was the perfect touch to a perfect day!!!”\n\nJulia and Alan Frank-Adams\n\nWe selected a Photo Gallery: All About Melanie\n\nClosing: In our conversation with MELANIE SROKA, she clearly explained her reasoning for becoming a composer. SHE wanted to write music that she could explore as an improviser, as a singer and as a human being inspired by nature: as a way to protect the environment.\n\nAnd I think that she has been creating a catalog of fantastic music that goes far beyond, just providing a bunch of utilitarian canvases for her to blow over.\n\nIn The Cuban Bridge on TV we were not looking for music that provides instant gratification. I love challenging music that continues to reveal itself on repeated listens and watches. That’s why I am posting these lines 4 Years After, 4 years in which she has continued to grow and blossom as a songwriter.\n\nThe Siren and The Waves, should be on your to-do-list for a soulful good time !\n\nI only ask you all to have mercy.\n\nFeel welcomed to visit Melanie Sroka’s website: http://www.thesirenandthewaves.com\n\nHost: Toni Basanta\n\nThe Cuban Bridge on television @ MMCTV Channel 15 in Richmond, Vermont.

Now On Air Sundays at 4 PM.\n\nFor streaming: wwpv.smcvt.edu\n\nSabroso Guarapo (Delicious Cuban Sugar Cane Juice) inspired by a Cuban Son Montuno from the 1950s written by singer Marcos Perdomo Sr. during his hey days with La Orquesta Sublime “La Pachanguera de Cuba”. Song title: Sabroso Como El Guarapo!\n\nIt was a show at THE RADIATOR, – a Community radio in Burlington, Vermont (2010 – 2014). On Thursday mornings at 6 AM, we woke up the city with TIN TIN DEO – the Music of Chano Pozo, Dizzy Gillespie and Gil Fuller played by pianist Ernan Lopez-Nussa with his band Habana Report.

King. His rendition helped make the song a blues standard.\n\nThe Manhattan Transfer recorded THE THRILL IS GONE in their album Tonin’ in 1995 featuring B.B. King and singer Ruth Brown.\n\nI have very fond memories of this album by The Manhattan Transfer Vocal Quartet. In my opinion is a Revival Album that brought back to the fire many singers and songwriters, and let me learn and discover much of their legacy.\n\nPromise in a new posting a Full Review of this masterpiece: Tonin’ in 1995 which I have played and replayed abundantly in my radio shows here in Vermont !\n\nBY NOW JUST 4 LINES TAKEN FROM Ms. BROWN’s OBITUARY IN 2006:\n\n“As the 1950s began, Ms. Brown’s singles for the fledgling Atlantic Records — like “(Mama) He Treats Your Daughter Mean” and “5-10-15 Hours” — became both the label’s bankroll and templates for all of rock ’n’ roll. She could sound as if she were hurting, or joyfully lusty, or both at once. Her voice was forthright, feisty and ready for anything”.\n\nPictured: Ruth Brown\n\nRuth Brown, original name Ruth Alston Weston, (born Jan. 12, 1928, Portsmouth, Va., U.S.—died Nov. 17, 2006, Las Vegas, Nev.), was an American singer and actress.\n\nHost: Toni Basanta\n\nGlobal Warming radio show at UVM station 90.1 FM Burlington (2007-2010) my first radio show in the US.\n\nSabroso Guarapo (Delicious Sugar Cane Juice) at The Radiator a community station in Burlington, Vt. regarded as VERMONT MUSIC LIBRARY.\n\nThe Cuban Bridge at WWPV 92.5 FM “The Mike” on air since February 2010, and the melodies still lingering on.\n\nwwpv.smcvt.edu"
