        "text": "Image courtesy of wikimedia.org\n\nVerônica Ferriani was born on February 7, 1978 in the inner city of Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo.\n\nHis first professional season was held at Traço de União, an important stronghold of samba in São Paulo, opening and acting as master of ceremonies at shows featuring the likes of Monarco, Nelson Sargento, Riachão, Wilson Moreira, Wilson das Neves, Tia Surica, Billy Blanco, and others.\n\nShe began singing in 2004 after graduating from the Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism of USP earning a degree in Architecture, at the invitation of composer and guitarist Chico Saraiva, winner of the Visa Award the year prior.\n\nHe recorded the music for Som Brasil, a program that aired on TV Globo in 2007. Ironically, the show aired before his CD was released. Verônica also teamed up with Gafieira São Paulo and later on managed to network with other fellow samba players looking to make a mark of their own such as Fabiana Cozza, Roberta Sá, Moyseis Marques, to name a few. In 2011, the group was winner of the Brazilian Music Award in the Best Group of Samba. Saraiva shared the stage with an array of artists including Francis Hime, Beth Carvalho, Jair Rodrigues, Martinho da Vila, Tom Zé, Élton Medeiros, Moacyr Luz, Mart’nália, Moska, and Criolo, among others.\n\nHis debut album was released in 2009. Later that year, another album titled Sobre Palavras (translated meaning “About Words)”, of which the website peoplepill.com mentioned that the album was, “in partnership with the composer and guitarist Chico Saraiva, of unpublished compositions of him with the lyricist Mauro Aguiar, recorded as an Award by the Pixinguinha Project (Funarte, 2008/2009). The album gave Verônica the Catavento Award, from Radio Cultura, in the best singer category.”\n\nAn authorial album came out in 2013, with a rather long title “Because the mouth speaks of what the heart is full.”\n\nFollowing Veronica’s debut album in 2009, she produced more work in 2013 and 2018 (which included an Ao Vivo performance). A pair of albums were released in 2022 before the album I am reviewing, which translated means “Whispering In The silence Becomes Noise, Irma.”\n\nThe album is split into two, the first one with 10 tracks and the second with 11. Several of the tracks feature playful melodies and a few commerical teasers are included on the first disk. One of them sounds like a lullaby with two ladies (presumably one of Veronica’s friends) giggly uncontrollably.\n\nOverall, this dual set of disks is great for entertaining or just relaxing on a lazy Sunday afternoon (of which in the United States have not had the pleasure of for over a month, considering how divided everything is right now.) Every song was just the right blend of typical sounds you would hear at a small party or just driving around seeing the sand on either side of your car.\n\nIf I had to choose a few tracks that are worth listening to are the title track leading off and Track 7 on the first disk, “Foto Linda” (the first word translating to “Photograph.”\n\nFor those looking for the physical CD’s, Amazon only has her self-titled debut. Otherwise, you are resorted to looking to second-hand websites where maybe just maybe you could find that one hidden gem.\n\nWith her entire discography available to stream on Spotify and Apple Music, it is definitely worth an addition to your Brazilian jazz library.\n\nEnjoy the rest of the Paris Olympics, and cheer on both Team USA and Brasil/Brazil to see how many medals they would take home before the next Summer Olympics in 2028 at the hometown of some of my former jazz subjects from a decade ago that call Los Angeles home.\n\nSee you again next month.\n\nReleased on May 14, the translation of Tiago’s latest album is “Before The World Ends.”\n\nI prefer instead to think of it as a new beginning. A endless amount of positivity and fun. If you noticed the album cover image of nothing but clear, blue water going on for miles and miles (kilometers for those reading in Brazil)–you couldn’t help think of this as simple coffeehouse music on any typical Sunday morning.\n\nIt is light enough not to interfere with any chores you might be doing around the house, but not as bubbly as the entire discography of Sergio Mendes and his many groups from the 1960’s through the 1980’s.\n\nFiguring the way our world has been going since the guy who was recently convicted on 34 counts in the hush money trial prior to the 2016 United States Presidential election, this album is an excellent sense of relief. Call it as a much needed release from the garbage (I’m referring to most of the hate and espeically the trolls on X, the siter formerly known as Twitter) we as Americans and practically most of the world all have to put up with on a daily basis.\n\nSeveral songs definitely qualify as put up your feet and read a good book on your Kindle/Nook device. Track 2, “Besame, Esqueca-Me” (translated meaning “Besame, Forget Me” was a nice duet with Julia Mestre. If you are into kids chanting, then the closing seconds of track 4 is for you–“Crianças Crescidas” (translated meaning “Grown Up Children”.\n\nThe one song that picked up the pace was Track 7, “Suave Suave”. Without digging too deep into the lyrics, it provides plenty of refreshing vibes and good flow without taking you off guard.\n\nThe other song I really enjoyed was Track 10 (the one following the beautiful ballad featuring one of today’s top Brazilian pop stars in Anitta), “Tudo Volta Ao Que Era” (translated meaning, “Everything Goes Back To The Way It Was.”\n\nIt can mean so many things. The most obvious is what I usually think of as having a series of commas in this complex journey called life.\n\nThe obvious ones are walking your first steps as a baby, learning to count, putting words together to form sentences, graduating grade school, high school (hopefully college as well), finding that significant other, maybe having children of your own, and getting that well earned job promotion.\n\nIt could mean anything you want it to be.\n\nHere are some of my proudest accomplishments in the first half century of being on this planet Earth:\n\nAble to count to 100 by age three,\n\nDeciphering a baseball box score by age six,\n\nUnderstood the basic ins and outs of the stock market by age seven,\n\nWon spelling bee contest in both fifth and sixth grade,\n\nOnce reached honor roll during junior year in high school,\n\nSports writer during senior year in high school newspaper,\n\nWorked at small town radio station for over a year covering high school and professional sports\n\nFive trips to the Dean’s List, five other times came close during college,\n\nWrote sports in school newspaper final three years in college,\n\nSpent one summer as self-employed tutor helping high school students and adults in three different subjects,\n\nWas one of four hired in 100 job applicants working for a labor law publishing company,\n\nSeven years later, began blogging on a periodic basis on Myspace,\n\nBegan running my own small business by age 34,\n\nEight years later, discovered WordPress and began publishing blogs about Brazilian jazz and ten months later covering men’s college basketball,\n\nBy late 2010’s, began journey into doing podcasts. One awkward experience using equipment and two successful platforms later, several nations around the world are discovering and liking what I have to say,\n\n…To be continued,\n\nObviously, we know what would happen if you put a period at the end\n\nWith all that said, I will be back sometime in July with another cool review.\n\nHope to see you then.\n\nImages courtesy of G1.globo–glbimg.com\n\nThroughout his storied career, Dori Caymmi has been a producer and arranger for big artists during the 1960’s such as Edu Lobo, Eumir Deodato, and Nara Leão and as a composer with Nelson Motta.\n\nOn his Wikipedia page, it mentioned that he was a guitarist and arranger for Paul Winter’s band. He also went on tour to get his first taste of playing in the U.S.\n\nIt went on to say:\n\n“He arranged albums by Caetano Veloso, Gal Costa, and Gilberto Gil. He was involved with musicians associated with the tropicalia movement of the late 1960s but did not record in this style because he disliked pop music. During the 1970s and ’80s, he composed TV and movie soundtracks, including Crônica da Casa Assassinada (1971), which wrote with Antonio Carlos Jobim. In 1989, he moved to Los Angeles, California.”\n\nHe also was nominated for numerous Latin Grammy Awards, most notably on his 2013 album Caymmi, with siblings Nana Caymmi and Danilo, was nominated for the 2014 Latin Grammy Award for Best MPB Album but lost to a former subject of this blog Marisa Monte with her album Verdade, Uma Ilusão.\n\nThe album review here was released on April 12 on streaming services. It has a bit of a mariachi vibe, considering this blog was published on May 5–Cinco de Mayo (and for some this day is also Greek Easter, so happy times indeed for those who celebrate considering the fragile state of our world.)\n\nEach song has a nice ebb and flow to it, and is great for being in a very calm state. I especially recommend if you have had a nervous, anxious time in whatever is going on in your life and while your heartbeat hopefully goes down to mostly normal levels, the duet sounds of MP84, Joyce Moreno, Renato Braz, and Monica Salmaso sprinkled throughout should pique your curiosity after a few listens. It is another excellent addition to any jazz library, along with his other work spanning over six decades dating back to 1960.\n\nEven better, this album clocks in at 34 minutes, 28 seconds–or 7 minutes and 11 seconds more than Jessica Pratt’s soothing, suave indie pop album Here In The Pitch, which was released this past Friday (May 3.)\n\n*********************************************************************************\n\nSomething huge happened in Rio on Saturday night\n\nPop star extraordinaire in Madonna played her biggest show in wrapping up her extensive “Celebration” world tour\n\nThe Reuters news agency reported on Saturday that this free concert had “The sand and oceanfront boulevard around Rio de Janeiro’s famed (Copacabana) beach were filled for several blocks by a crowd the city estimated at 1.6 million (people.)\n\nMany had been there for hours or even days to get a good spot, while richer fans anchored in dozens of boats near the beach and onlookers crowded beachfront apartments.”\n\nTemperatures ranged in the evening from the upper 20’s to around 30 Celsius/81 to 86 Farenheit–similar temperature range you would find at Chicago’s world famous Lollapalooza each August.\n\nNME, the popular indie music website in Great Britain had an excellent account of the festivities–which included a bunch of X/Tweets and some awesome YouTube videos of Madonna performing a few of her biggest hits during the 1980’s:\n\nhttps://www.nme.com/news/music/madonna-plays-biggest-show-of-career-to-1-6million-people-in-brazil-3753562\n\nPlease stay safe if you are walking near any college campus considering the state of our world. Otherwise, I will see you again in June with another cool album review. Take care.\n\nCover image courtesy of grandvision.org\n\nBorn in the southern end of Brazil to an Italian family that was in the shoemaking business. For the unitiated, it requires very intense work–from using sewing machines, cutting machines, skiving machines, lasting machines, and finishing machines (not to mention various types of glue to make the soles firm.)\n\nShe grew up immersed in the family business, with her father owning a manufacturer of all things shoe soles. Get this, even the whole town was involved. Similar to those who spend most, if not all their working hours in working their craft does not lead to much in terms of having a social life.\n\nEventually, she grew tired of the business and decided to break out on her own. In a 2018 interview with Voyage LA, she thought that there were bigger things in life that would be awaiting her, even though she was happily married and carried a steady paycheck.\n\n“I basically did not know who I was without that mask I had been putting on for so long. All I know I couldn’t keep going on with that reality.\n\nSo I gathered the courage to quit my job, I sold everything I had and left that stage. I wasn’t going to play that role anymore. I needed a fresh start. I needed a clean slate. So I moved to LA, which was where I had gone to school, and I took the chance to write my own story.”\n\nThat led to a 4 credit course on being a member of a local choir. She was good at it, but needed more. Learning about music theory and getting along with other similar minded people brought her to realize a newer chapter in her life, a longing to stick it out when times are rough.\n\nEven when that university cut the funds for the choir was crushing. The stress was unbearable, so she decided to leave her friends and family and moved to Los Angeles hoping to make it on her own.\n\nShe then mentions in the same interview how difficult that path was to achieving her true dreams in becoming a full-time singer:\n\n“After a couple of weeks of hiatus, I started to miss the choir. I missed having that time for myself. It was then that I realized that, whenever I was singing, I didn’t feel like anything was missing, I felt whole. And then I thought, maybe that’s what I’m supposed to be doing. I was only used to sing in the choir, I had never sung publicly by myself. But again, this was a moment of reinventing myself, so it really didn’t matter what I had done or had not done before. What mattered was what I was gonna do, from then on, so I went for it.”\n\nWhatever Caro decided to do, that difficult time has shaped her to be more confident and believing in herself that great things can happen if you put in the time and the effort, no matter what job or pursuit you are trying to achieve.\n\nAnd how did she latch on to finding some albums beyond the classics? It wasn’t with eBay or Amazon.\n\nNot even one of the great online sites with Connect Brazil.\n\nOf all places, it was Craigslist was her first true discovery.\n\nShe then hooked up with Antonio Cruz and a few other similar minded people. He worked for a bank, so it wasn’t much of an issue regarding financing. All Caro had to do was come up with songs, for fun. Once they recruited a drummer and a bassist, gigs at House of Blues, The Mint, the upstairs room at The Roxy followed.\n\nIt all led to her first album in 2013 under the band named Marbella, titled Volta ao Mundo. Cruz then departed a few years to finish his Master’s degree and then she met Grecco Buratto, another Latin Grammy nominated producer, that encouraged her to start writing by herself. She is embracing doing live music, but her main emphasis is adding Brazilian rhythms to cover songs along with originals that became her signature talent.\n\nShe produced her first album in 2020 during the pandemic Em Portugues.\n\nHer latest album for this month’s review Sambalismo (briefly translated to sambalism) that was released on May 26, 2023 is a refreshing listen. Similar to many albums I have profiled in this blog before, it provides excellent background listening at a party, if you are shopping at a farmer’s market in the warmer weather months, or feel like taking off your shoes/heels after a hard day at work.\n\nAll of her songs are in Portuguese, and there are plenty of fun songs to sink your teeth into. I like Track 2 “Mal Acostumado”, and especially Track 4 “Nesse Jogo.”\n\nIn an interview with Scott Adams of connectbrazil.com, there are some unique stories behind the songs:\n\n“The common thread of the album are the rhythms derived from the Samba root.”\n\n“‘Mal Acostumado’ came as a little song I’d sing to my beloved dog, Max,” she explained. He passed away in 2020 after 13 years of a long, great life. I don’t have kids, so Max was well-loved. That is where “mal acostumado” – spoiled – comes from! I used to sing just the first part of the song to him all the time! When it came time to choose the songs for Sambalismo, we thought it would be a great idea to include his song as an homage. Then we dressed it in the Samba beat. That’s a great way to remember Max.”\n\nWhat a nice tribute who really got into the music for her four-legged friend.\n\nSadly, her dad died in 2021 due to COVID. But she has gained a deeper appreciation, because he led the effort to bring her to the United States, similar to many other countless artists before and certainly after her.\n\nAnother song that is poignant in nature, similar to what I was going through in 2010 with Patricia Talem penning a song on her album “Olhos” to my late grandmother is a nice tribute to her father:\n\n“‘Sei La’ is a realization of how good it is to be able to remember all the moments we had together. And of how once one is gone, the love we felt for each other remains. All the judgments just disappear. So, ‘Sei La’ is a celebration of that too.”\n\nAnother one of life’s lessons is that we need to treasure those that are closest to us, and appreciate the little things in life.\n\nBecause we all know precious and fragile life can be.\n\nMike Greenberg of ESPN Radio in 2010 mentioned in a 4 CD set with fellow Radio Hall of Famer Mike Golic, Sr. on “Rules and Sports And Life” that life has a series of commas.\n\nThink of it as links on a chain. Every major life moment, you add a comma–like when you graduate, get that promotion at your job, get married, have kids, achieve something noteworthy in your community, etc.\n\nBut the period is what we hope not to do until we get beyond retirement age. That is the hope of many of us, myself included.\n\nWithout digging too deep into my past.\n\nSports Editor senior year in high school, three year Sports Editor for campus newspaper in college, 18 months as assistant producer for local radio station covering about 2 dozen high school football and men’s basketball games, self-employed tutor, phone representative specializing in labor law books and monthly newsletters, working for myself, doing blogs in Brazilian jazz and men’s basketball, meeting lots of great friends online, hoping to find a woman that I can call my own…\n\n…To Be Continued next month with another cool blog.\n\nThanks again for reading, as we are 125 days before the first NFL football game takes place on Brazilian soil with an NFC matchup featuring two traditional powers with Green Bay as the visitors taking on the Philadelphia Eagles–who are giving up a home game at Lincoln Financial Field and their crazy fanbase to play the first football game on the South American continent. The simple reason why, this is all because of the NFL hoping to become a true global power (but I am sure a lot of futbol/soccer fans will say otherwise.)\n\nSee you in May.\n\nYou knew it was coming.\n\nFollowing the annual NFL Owners Meetings in Orlando, Florida came this rather expected news:\n\nThe Peacock exclusive regular season game will be broadcast on WCAU/NBC10 in Philadelphia and whatever NBC station that will be opposing the Eagles. Those who also have NFL+ on their mobile devices can also access the game.\n\nRadio wise, it is believed that Westwood One will air that broadcast–but we will know more once the official regular schedule is released later this spring. If you have SiriusXM, either via the app or on the desktop, you can listen to the Eagles and the other NFL teams if you are interested in the home team call.\n\nThe move made sense in general media terms that 23 million Americans watched the first ever streaming playoff game, when the Kansas City Chiefs beat the Miami Dolphins (in minus -27 Farenheit wind chills). It was also reported recently that 71 percent of those initial subscribers decided to stick around (including those horrible pictures for Caitlin Clark’s record breaking shot when Iowa beat Michigan State and most of the Big Ten games in general.)\n\nBottom line for American viewers: A few weeks after the Paris Summer Olympics ends and the Premier Leagues starts in mid-August and college football starts on August 29, there will be four straight nights of football:\n\nOnly the Brazil game will be a Peacock exclusive. NBC airs its traditional Opening Night game on Thursday, September 5, and Sunday Night Football on Sunday, September 8. On Saturday, September 7, NBC will air a Big Ten football game. Teams will be announced at a later date.\n\nBut for those lucky fans having to take 3 flights and go through customs just to get to Guarulhos International Airport, that would be a victory in of itself–considering how busy their rush hour is on a Friday (I have seen some YouTube clips confirming that.)\n\nI remain skeptical, since reading many posts on X/Twitter with fans constantly complaining about not being able to see the game over-the-air, which has been the case since the late 1950’s.\n\nHere’s what I said in my other blog, All Things About Men’s College Basketball on January 17:\n\n“Bottom line, I will need a lot of convincing from those who love using their phones every waking minute in telling me why streaming is so popular. I don’t get it. And please don’t bring up the cost difference between streaming and cable, it is simply astronomical. Just explain bullet point by bullet point on why streaming TV shows and movies is so great.\n\nI want to know.“\n\nAnd I don’t have the streaming numbers for Brazil, so for all I know–I will have to get my highlights elsewhere.\n\nThanks Peacock. You ruined what was supposed to be an awesome experience for football fans. And I am already hearing gripes that two NFL games will be played on Christmas Day…\n\nEven though the big holiday falls on a Wednesday:\n\nClearly, the NBA is an afterthought–5 games in 13 hours isn’t enough. Have people ever heard of channel changing? With the endless number of TV timeouts in a typical NFL game, that should give everyone at least 2 to 3 minutes of basketball game action (unless there are a bunch of fouls and/or free throws taking place.)\n\nI could go on, but I hope at least look online during most of that week to see how the most populous city in Brazil will be treating the game as a big festival. If it is similar atmosphere wise to what has been very common in London, that should be quite an environment.\n\nI said it in my full-time blog in January and I will say it again here:\n\nI refuse to spend $5.99 just to watch one game, or for those of you reading in Brazil, that equals to around 29.9041 Reals give or take.\n\nOverall, I am very disappointed in this news."
