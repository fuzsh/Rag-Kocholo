        "text": "Groundbreaking musician/songwriter/producer Steven Wilson has announced a truly unique special edition of his eagerly awaited sixth album, THE FUTURE BITES. Limited to 1 of 1, ULTRA DELUXE MUSIC PRODUCT ON OBSOLETE MEDIA will retail for £10,000, with all proceeds directly benefitting the Music Venue Trust to help save grassroots music venues in the UK adversely affected by COVID-19. Simultaneously the apotheosis of modern consumerism and the ultimate Steven Wilson collectible, the bespoke package will collect the previously announced THE FUTURE BITES LIMITED EDITION DELUXE BOX SET alongside previously unheard music (including a one-sided 7-inch single with the exclusive track, “The Tastemaker,” limited to an edition of one and never to be released anywhere else), conceptual artwork, handwritten lyrics, and such rare items of personal ephemera from Wilson’s personal archive as six laminated AAA passes for various tours between 2011-18 and his GRAMMY® Award nomination certificate and medal honoring 2011’s GRACE BEFORE DROWNING for “Best Surround Sound Mix.” ULTRA DELUXE MUSIC PRODUCT ON OBSOLETE MEDIA will be available for a very limited time on Friday, November 27. THE FUTURE BITES arrives via TFB.com/Arts & Crafts on January 29, 2021.\n\nWATCH THE ULTRA DELUXE MUSIC PRODUCT ON OBSOLETE MEDIA BOXSET TRAILER\n\n“This edition of THE FUTURE BITES takes the whole notion of deluxe limited editions to its logical and fairly extreme conclusion as the ultimate limited edition will obviously end up being just one copy,” Wilson says. “In many ways, this edition is more analogous with the world of art than with those of music or luxury branding. Only one person can own an actual painting with the artist’s brush strokes on it. There is no variance, only the one original.\n\n“With regards to the contents of the 1 of 1 edition, it’s the purchaser’s choice as to whether they decide to share what they’ve bought or keep it to themselves. Do they want to exhibit ‘the painting’, or put it on display at home? If it was me, I’d probably keep it private but I’ll leave it entirely up to them as what they do with the contents of their purchase.”\n\nTHE FUTURE BITES is further heralded by today’s premiere of the soaring new track, “12 Things I Forgot.” An official visualizer is streaming now at YouTube. Furthermore, “12 Things I Forgot” will be available on limited edition vinyl on Friday, November 27.\n\nLISTEN TO \"12 THINGS I FORGOT\"\n\n“12 Things I Forgot” marks the latest track premiere from THE FUTURE BITES, following the previous release of “King Ghost,” “Eminent Sleaze,” and “Personal Shopper,” the latter of which will be joined by an equally ambitious official video premiering this Friday, November 27. Both “King Ghost” and “Eminent Sleaze” are already accompanied by official videos, streaming now at Wilson’s official YouTube channel; a striking trailer previewing the album’s provocative themes of high-concept consumerism and post-internet evolution is also streaming now via YouTube.\n\nLISTEN TO “PERSONAL SHOPPER”\n\nWATCH “KING GHOST”\n\nWATCH “EMINENT SLEAZE”\n\nWATCHTHE FUTURE BITES TRAILER\n\nTHE FUTURE BITES will be available on all digital platforms, along with vinyl, CD, and a limited edition deluxe box set that contains CDs of the album, an instrumental version of the album, bonus material (including six additional songs and several reworked versions of album tracks, among them a 19-minute extended mix of “Personal Shopper”), a cassette of demos, and a Blu-ray featuring videos and Wilson’s own 5.1 surround sound and Dolby Atmos versions of the album (marking THE FUTURE BITES as the first contemporary album to be mixed and released in Dolby Atmos). Pre-orders are available now.\n\nPRE-ORDERTHE FUTURE BITES\n\nCo-produced in London by Wilson with David Kosten (Bat For Lashes, Everything Everything), THE FUTURE BITES sees Wilson exploring contemporary addiction and the lasting effect of ever-increasing technology on our daily lives. The album marks his most inventive and far-reaching musical construction to date, spanning soaring acoustics, lush electronica, relentless bass-driven grooves, murky funk, and so much more, all linked through powerfully focused songcraft and this one-of-a-kind artist’s always unique creative vision.\n\nHailed by Rolling Stone’s David Fricke for his “fighting spirit and truly progressive ideals in rock composition, group improvisation and emotionally authentic storytelling,” Wilson recently launched an official THE FUTURE BITESwebstore, featuring a fully imagined consumer universe. The website will crack a door open onto a wonderful world of purchase power, a place where everything is marketable and nothing is too random or too moronic to be considered valuable. Inspired by notable 21st century artifacts like the Virgil Abloh ceramic block or Vitality Air’s canned Canadian oxygen, THE FUTURE BITES website is a fully imagined consumer universe (built in collaboration with Baby and Crystal Spotlight) designed to be accessible and addictive to anyone from the casual fan to the hardcore collector. The site will feature regular drops of limited edition merchandise over the coming months, showcasing anything from a slogan shirt to a branded hole punch.\n\nVISITTHE FUTURE BITES WEBSITE\n\n# # #\n\nSTEVEN WILSON\n\nTHE FUTURE BITES\n\n(Arts & Crafts)\n\nRelease Date: January 29, 2021"
