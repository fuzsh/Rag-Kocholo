        "text": "After a couple of very busy weeks, it looks like there's a bit of a post-Mardi Gras lull with regard to jazz and creative music in St. Louis, at least in terms of the number of shows this weekend.\n\nStill, in addition to the various ongoing weekly gigs by local musicians (which you can find listed on the St. Louis Jazz Notes Calendar), there are a few other noteworthy events happening over the next few days, starting with three nights of performances by the Bruce Barth Quintet.\n\nBarth (pictured) and his group, which also features the well-regarded trumpeter Terell Stafford, have been in town since Monday for an educational residency under the auspices of Jazz St. Louis. Tonight, they'll play at The Gramophone as part of a Young Friends of Jazz St. Louis benefit for JSL's educational programs, an event that also will include an opening set from the Jazz St. Louis All-Stars student ensemble. Then on Friday and Saturday, Barth and band will be at Jazz at the Bistro, where they'll play the customary two shows each night. For more on this versatile pianist and some video samples of his playing, see this post from last Saturday.\n\nAlso this evening, the Jazz at Holmes series at Washington University will present a free concert by Sometime Then and Again, a quartet featuring a couple of well-known local musicians, guitarist William Lenihan and saxophonist Dave Stone. Though Lenihan and Stone are both known quantities, this particular configuration seems to be a comparatively recent development, and Wash U. hasn't provided a lot of information about what sort of music they'll be playing. Given Stone and Lenihan's respective ranges of experience, it could be anything from completely composed music to totally free improv, but, considering the known level of talent there, the gig seems worth checking out regardless.\n\nOn Friday, you can catch some Latin jazz at Brandt's courtesy of Clave De Sol, featuring Farshid Etniko on guitar plus the pianist Phil Gomez, an interesting and accomplished player I've always liked for his ability to consistently do the unexpected. And on Sunday night, the crowd-pleasing soul/jazz/funk band Good 4 the Soul plays the early shift at BB's Jazz Blues and Soups.\n\nUPDATE, 2:30 p.m. 2/26/09 - Two more events worth mentioning, gleaned from late night/early morning emails: My esteemed colleague Terry Perkins dropped a note to say that trumpeter and East St. Louis expat Russell Gunn will be in the backup band for pop/R&B singer Ne-Yo's concert at the Fox Theatre on Sunday. I don't know how much solo space there is for Gunn in the show - probably not that much, I'd suspect - but he's doing the entire tour with Ne-Yo and presumably making some nice money in the process.\n\nAlso, the SIU-Edwardsville jazz program will present its annual concert Tuesday night at The Sheldon, featuring the University's big band and vocal jazz ensembles as well as appearances from faculty members and alumni including Rick Haydon, Reggie Thomas, Jason Swagler, Miles Vandiver, Andy Tichenor, Brett and Kim Stamps, Bennett Wood and Zeb Briskovich. The program will include two compositions from Brett Stamps, “Cajun Cookin'\" and “Let's Samba,\" as well as Thomas' arrangements for the vocal jazz ensemble on “Revelation\" (done in the style of Take 6), Lambert, Hendricks and Ross' “Centerpiece\" and “Smilin' Faces.\"\n\nOf course, as mentioned above, these are just a few select highlights of the weekend's musical offerings. For more jazz-related events this weekend and beyond, please visit the St. Louis Jazz Notes Calendar. As usually happens at the beginning of a month, there will be a series of updates to the Calendar over the next several days as band and club information trickles and/or straggles in, so stay tuned.\n\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/news.php?id=30892\n\nPJ Parker’s third release, Dreams Are Meant For Two, is an emotional collection of original and classic standards, including her own title track, plus “Black Coffee,” “Moonglow,” “Angel Eyes,” her own “So What Do You Say?” and “Love’s A Logistical Thing,” plus nine others.\n\nJazz fans across the United States and in far-flung places such as South Africa are enjoying “Dreams” on their local jazz stations, and the collection has earned early praise.\n\nAndrea Canter of JazzPolice.com called the title track, which was penned by PJ to music written by her late father, “stunning.”\n\n“With Dreams Are Meant for Two, PJ Parker has issued a definitive statement of intent: to challenge the heart, to unlock memories, to reinvent the familiar, to entertain. And to do so on her own terms, with her own voice,” Canter writes.\n\nCanter says PJ's original songs “suggest PJ Parker has the potential to be a significant songwriter.”\n\n“Dreams Are Meant For Two” Track Listing:\n\n1. Moonglow\n\n2. Angel Eyes\n\n3. Long Ago (And Far Away)\n\n4. Then I'll Be Tired Of You\n\n5. Black Coffee\n\n6. Old Devil Moon\n\n7. So What Do You Say?\n\n8. Let's Fall In Love\n\n9. Until It's Time For You To Go/If You Go Away\n\n10. Love Me Or Leave Me\n\n11. The Song Is You\n\n12. In Passing Years\n\n13. In The Wee Small Hours\n\n14. Love's A Logistical Thing\n\n15. Dreams Are Meant For Two\n\nDreams Are Meant For Two, as a melody, remained virtually undiscovered for over 50 years until two weeks prior to this recording.\n\nAccording to PJ, “I was somehow drawn to a lone manuscript, nestled amongst my Dad’s beloved sheet music, carefully stored in his piano bench. He had signed it, labeled it ‘PIANO’ and composed it entirely in pencil. There were no lyrics.” She brought it to her pianist, Vinnie Ruggieri. After an emotional rendering of this lovely melody, they both agreed that if PJ could write lyrics, the song should be included in this recording. She did so, somehow sensing that her father had written the melody for her mother, before they were married, which indeed turned out to be true.\n\n“The lyrics seemed to write themselves; a simple love song written by a man who had finally found the love of his life.” And when PJ and Vinnie recorded it, just piano and voice, the last song of the session, it was in the wee small hour of June 17, the anniversary of the wedding of Thomas and Gloria Parker. In their honor and celebration the collection is entitled, Dreams Are Meant For Two.\n\nParts of the original manuscript page have been reproduced on the actual compact disc and background tray.\n\nFeatured with PJ on Dreams Are Meant For Two are the stellar musicians Vinnie Ruggieri on piano; Earl Sauls on bass, Tim Horner on drums, Coleman Mellett on guitar and Joel Frahm on tenor and soprano saxophone.\n\nA native New Yorker, PJ Parker has been performing live since she was five years old. After graduating from New York University, PJ toured with various show bands throughout the US and Caribbean.\n\nShe has performed in concerts, dinner theater, summer stock, regional theater and musical revues, and has also been the featured vocalist with orchestras and bands from Atlantic City to New York City. As a jazz vocalist, PJ has performed with such artists as Jerry Bruno, Roy Cumming, Steve Gilmore, Harry Leahy, Keith MacDonald, Gary Mazzaroppi, Geary Moore, Rich Reiter and Radam Schwartz. She has also been the featured vocalist for opening act bands for John Pizzarelli and Harry Connick Jr., and appeared in the annual Philadelphia Variety Club Telethon with Ben Vereen and Maureen McGovern.\n\nPJ’s first CD, Intimate, features her unique renditions of selections from the Great American Songbook and her It’s Christmas CD debuted her own “Not Beneath the Tree” amid a mix of traditional and contemporary Christmas songs.\n\nBoth CDs received airplay on radio stations across the country.\n\nReviewers throughout the U.S. and Europe have embraced PJ. Scott Yanow of L.A. Jazz Scene writes, “PJ has a very musical voice and her singing is full of honest emotions and subtle improvising.”\n\nLarry Taylor of JazzReview.com writes, “...[Parker] is in command, slowly drawing the listener in with an attitude of majestic surrender.”\n\nAndrea Canter of JazzPolice.com said PJ Parker “rises above the sea of promising vocalists as a true jazz singer who warrants serious attention … PJ makes every note and phrase a personal experiment.”\n\nMichel Bedin of Jazz Hot, Paris, France, writes, “Intimate is a beautiful example of real jazz in the United States.”\n\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/musician.php?id=14214\n\nPresident Barack Obama on Wednesday thanked musician Stevie Wonder for creating “a style that’s uniquely American” as he presented the singer-songwriter the nation’s highest award for pop music.\n\nObama, who called Wonder the soundtrack of his youth, gave the star the Library of Congress’ Gershwin Prize for Popular Song during an East Room tribute that featured Tony Bennett, Martina McBride and Wonder himself. The president joked that the group was “the most accomplished Stevie Wonder cover band in history.”\n\nWonder was emotional at times, thanking Obama for the award and reflecting on what his election as the first black president means to the United States.\n\n“What is truly exciting for me today is that we truly have lived to see a time and a space where America has a chance to again live up to the greatness that it deserves to be seen and known as, through the love and caring and the commitment of a president — as in our president, Barack Obama,” he said.\n\nWonder cited Martin Luther King Jr., his faith and his mother during an acceptance speech that flowed into a set of Obama’s favorite songs. The Grammy-winning musician — he has 25 of the awards — joked that he looked forward to writing more love songs — perhaps a soundtrack for “you know, maybe I’ll be a part of creating some more of those babies.”\n\nObama praised Wonder’s decades-long career and a style that has blended pop and funk, R&B and gospel.\n\n“Stevie has always drawn on the incredible range of traditions in his music and, from that, he’s created a style that’s at once uniquely American, uniquely his own, and yet somehow universal,” Obama said. “Indeed, this could be called the American tradition — artists demonstrating the courage, the talent to find new harmonies in the rich and dissonant sounds of the American experience.”\n\nFirst lady Michelle Obama spoke in more personal terms, calling Wonder “one of the world’s greatest artists.” She recalled how she and her grandfather would listen to Wonder’s albums together.\n\n“He’d blast music throughout the house and that’s where he and I would sit and listen to Stevie’s music together — songs about life, love, romance, heartache, despair. He would let me listen to these songs over and over and over and over again,” she said.\n\nThe first album she bought was Wonder’s “Talking Book,” and she and Barack Obama used “You and I” as their wedding song.\n\nPresident Obama said he was lucky to have already loved Wonder’s music when he first met his mate.\n\n“I think it’s fair to say that had I not been a Stevie Wonder fan, Michelle might not have dated me, we might not have married,” Obama said, with his wife sitting in the front row. “The fact that we agreed on Stevie was part of the essence of our courtship.”\n\nAlthough the president is a well-known fan — Wonder performed at his nominating convention in Denver last summer and at a Lincoln Memorial concert before his January inauguration — the Library of Congress had decided to honor Wonder before Obama won the election.\n\nThe Gershwin Prize honors George and Ira Gershwin and is given for lifetime achievement in popular music. Paul Simon claimed the nation’s first prize in 2007.\n\nWonder’s performance will be broadcast Thursday on PBS stations as part of a White House series on the arts.\n\n© 2009 The Associated Press.

Eugene Smith, the renowned American photojournalist, once shared living space with Hall Overton, an obscure composer and pianist. Inside the boxes are wigs, maybe thousands, the inventory of a Chinese business that now holds the lease. Nothing about this nondescript building in the flower district betrays its decade-long history as a bustling clubhouse for the jazz scene, beginning in the mid-1950s.\n\nSo it takes some effort to picture Thelonious Monk, one of jazz’s great composers, pacing these floorboards early in 1959 as he prepares for his momentous large-group debut at Town Hall, which would help lay the groundwork for a career beyond clubs. It takes imagination to place him and Overton at a pair of upright pianos, hashing out chord voicings for one after another of his songs. But these things did happen; that much we know from an extraordinary cache of tape recordings made by Smith, who had wired most of the building with microphones.\n\nThe Monk-and-Overton tapes account for just a fragment of some 3,000 hours of material amassed by Smith from 1957 to ’65. Because of the light they shed on both musicians, their value is inestimable. Monk, famous for his cryptic silence and cavalier methods, comes across as exacting, lucid, even voluble — an eccentric genius, yes, but also a diligent one. Overton, enlisted to orchestrate Monk’s knotty compositions, is revealed as a patient amanuensis and a brilliant foil.\n\n“What’s obvious is their mutual respect, and the extent of their precision,” said the pianist Jason Moran, 34. “It’s crazy to hear how specific everything was.”\n\nMr. Moran is among a handful of people to have listened to the loft recordings at Duke University’s Center for Documentary Studies, which is in the process of cataloging all of Smith’s tapes. On Friday, as part of a 50th anniversary celebration of the Town Hall concert, Mr. Moran will perform a postmodern tribute, complete with excerpts from the tapes. Together with a concert on Thursday — a more literal re-enactment led by the trumpeter Charles Tolliver, which will be broadcast live on WNYC-FM in New York — it’s among the more anticipated jazz events of this year.\n\nThe larger story of the loft has been an immersive project for researchers at Duke, who have interviewed 300 people in 19 states. Sam Stephenson, who directs the effort and whose book on the subject, “Rhythm of a Corner: W. Eugene Smith and a New York Jazz Loft 1957-1965,” will be published by Knopf this fall, described a convergence of forces, saved for posterity by the will of one man’s obsession.\n\nSmith moved to 821 Avenue of the Americas, near West 28th Street, in 1957, leaving behind a family in Westchester and a job with Life magazine, where he had perfected the photo-essay form. He fixated on the loft and the street outside, shooting 20,000 photographs while peering out of a fourth-floor window, as if it were the aperture to another camera. “Robert Frank, the photographer, was a friend of Smith’s,” Mr. Stephenson said at that window one recent morning (beside a tower of boxes marked “Jumbo Afro”). “He told me that Smith went from a public journalist to a private artist with this body of work.”\n\nThe tapes came out of the same impulse. Smith recorded hours of random noise, broadcasts, the comings and goings of the place. But because his fellow residents included Overton, the pianist Dick Cary and the painter David X. Young, he also got a cross section of jazz culture at a dynamic time. (He and Overton shared an open floor plan divided by a temporary wall; Cary was downstairs, Young upstairs.) The tapes include jam sessions and off-the-cuff interactions among dozens of musicians, famous and unknown. One night in 1961, Mr. Stephenson said, Smith’s microphones caught the drama of a drug overdose by the pianist Sonny Clark, who was squatting in the stairwell at the time.\n\nMonk and Overton turn up together during the weeks leading up to the Town Hall concert, which took place on Feb. 28, 1959. Months earlier Monk had been stripped of his cabaret card, a license to work in New York nightclubs. So the concert idea may have been born partly out of desperation: it was another way to earn money. A friend in the business, Jules Colomby, organized the event, and Orrin Keepnews produced a live recording for his label Riverside.\n\n“I don’t know anybody alive today who can tell me how Hall Overton came into that picture,” Mr. Keepnews has said. The loft tapes don’t answer that question exactly, but a journal kept by Cary bears relevance, according to Mr. Stephenson’s research. One entry reads: “Thelonious Monk and gang upstairs at Hall’s.” The date is April 21, 1955, about four years before Town Hall.\n\nIf the loft materials reveal fascinating new glimpses of Monk, they throw the door wide open on Overton, about as overlooked a figure as they come. He had a master’s degree from Juilliard, where he would join the faculty in the 1960s. He composed classical music and taught a diverse array of students, including Doris Duke and Steve Reich. “He was a wonderful teacher,” said Mr. Reich, the pioneering Minimalist composer, describing his lessons at the loft in 1957 and ’58. “Hall made things clear to me that have served me well for the rest of my life.”\n\nOverton, who had no gift for self-promotion, was also a capable jazz pianist with a manner that endeared him to musicians. “He always had a cigarette in his mouth, and the ash was always three-quarters of an inch long,” Mr. Reich said. “He was very relaxed and had a dry sense of humor, and he got along with jazz musicians because he accepted them as they were.”\n\nWhich partly explains the trust Overton earned with Monk. On the tapes they spend hours discussing the mechanics of harmony and rhythm. After an especially grueling dissection of a tune called “Thelonious,” Monk can be heard walking away from the piano, losing interest or steam. “What you have there is fine,” he says.\n\n“Well, the point is, I’ll do it,” Overton says after a pause, sounding resolute. “But I want to do it with you. I want to check every sound with you. And also what instruments you want to hear in certain places, you know?”\n\nDuring a later session Overton puts on a recording of Monk’s “Locomotive.” “I don’t know how that goes,” Monk says, fumbling at the piano; it’s no surprise the tune didn’t make it onto the bill.\n\nHearing the original recording of “Little Rootie Tootie,” by contrast, provoked at least one important decision. “Let the band play that,” Monk says during his piano solo, meaning he wants it arranged for the horns. The resulting stretch of orchestration, a corkscrew-and-pinball plunge, is the most elaborate flourish of the concert.\n\nHad Monk been meeting with Overton someplace other than the loft, it’s doubtful he would have opened up as readily. And the casual vibe carried over to the band when it finally convened.\n\n“Rehearsals always started at the bar,” the alto saxophonist Phil Woods said. “Monk would say, ‘O.K., let’s get a taste.’ Then we’d go to work. It was thrilling. It was also hard as hell.”\n\nThe effort paid off: the concert was a musical success.\n\n“It was the first time that Monk was truly recognized in a setting other than a nightclub,” said the jazz historian Dan Morgenstern, who was there. (During his prior appearances at both Town Hall and Carnegie Hall, Monk had been part of a larger bill.)\n\nMr. Reich, who was also in the audience, said: “The arrangements could have been a real pretentious flop, and they weren’t at all. They were another way of looking at Monk’s music. I got a feeling that it was all Monk in terms of the notes and rhythms and all Hall in terms of the timbres.”\n\nOne of the only sour notes was a review in The New York Times by John S. Wilson, who wrote that the arrangements offered “a pipe-and-slippers version of music that is naturally querulous.” Mr. Woods and others, including the baritone saxophonist Pepper Adams, recalled that a scheduled tour for the tentet was canceled as a result.\n\nMonk was vindicated in time; the concert recording is now regarded as a classic. And that first headlining appearance in a major concert hall only helped his stature. His cabaret card was restored; within a few years, he was on Columbia Records. In 1964, five years to the day after Town Hall, he made the cover of Time.\n\nThat year the scene at the loft fizzled, as Overton, Cary and Young all moved out. Smith took over the building and kept shooting and developing film there, until he was evicted in 1971. (He died in 1978.) Mr. Stephenson’s work will fulfill part of Smith’s ambitions to publish a book about the building. So will a 10-part series due for broadcast next year on WNYC-FM.\n\nBoth of this week’s tributes had their premieres in 2007 at Duke, which is also presenting the New York performances. Recordings of the Duke shows confirm that Mr. Tolliver, who attended the original Town Hall concert as a teenager, is aiming for a true reflection of it, while Mr. Moran has designs conceptual and personal.\n\nThe touches of reinvention in both concerts are in keeping with the spirit of the music, as the tapes illustrate. “We don’t have to do it like the record,” Overton says, as he puts on “Little Rootie Tootie.”\n\nMonk shoots back: “Oh, no, of course not. We might hear something else that sounds better.”\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/22/arts/music/22chin.html?pagewanted=2&_r=1\n\nLino Patruno has been in show-biz for many years. His experience ranges from concert jazz performances, studio recordings, TV and cabaret actor, theatre and cinema, to bandleader, film music composer,jazz festival organizer and television presenter.\n\nLino Patruno began his career in the first of the jazz bands active in Milan in the 50’s.\n\nAmong the bands he led,are the notable “Riverside Jazz Band” in the 50’s and 60’s and the “Milan College Jazz Society” in the 70’s.\n\nIn 1964 together with Nanni Svampa, Roberto Brivio and Gianni Magni, he founded “I Gufi” (The Owls), the first exemple of Italian Cabaret inspired by that of the French.\n\nFrom the Milan Cabaret scene the four actors moved to theatre, taking their show around Italy until 1969, the year in which the group broke up.\n\nFollowing this in the early 70’s, Lino Patruno with Nanni Svampa continued his theatrical activity with Franca Mazzola, appearing in some TV Shows of notable success: “La Mia Morosa Cara”, “Addio Tabarin”, Un Giorno Dopo l’Altro”, “Una Bella Domenica Di Settembre…”.\n\nPatruno in the meantime returned to his jazz activities which he had laid aside due to his many activities with the “Gufi”, and he made a series of records and TV programs with some of the great Jazz performers of the day (Albert Nicholas, Joe Venuti, Bill Coleman, Wingy Manone, Bud Freeman, Jimmy McPartland, Dick Cary, Teddy Wilson, Eddie Miller, Billy Butterfield, Bob Wilber, Peanuts Hucko, Bob Haggart, Spiegle Willcox, Pee Wee Erwin, Barney Bigard, Ralph Sutton, Dick Wellstood, Earle Warren, Jimmy Woode, Tony Scott, Kenny Davern, Wild Bill Davison, Bucky Pizzarelli…).\n\nHis greatest success came about, however, in his participation in the TV show “Portobello”.\n\nWith Pupi Avati, he wrote the screenplay of the film “Bix” which represented Italy in the 1991 Cannes Festival, producing the soundtrack arranged by Bob Wilber.\n\nIn the 1990/91 season he conducted the TV show “A Tutto Jazz” for the “Cinquestelle” Network, in 1993 “L’Occhio sulla Musica” for RAI 3.\n\nAmong the International Festivals in which he has taken part, we remember that of Sanremo (Italy) in 1963, that of Nice (France) in 1976 and 1977, Breda (Holland) in 1978, in Switzerland (Lugano, Lucern, Bern), in Italy (Pompei, Palermo), Dusseldorf (Germany), all in the 80’s, and in USA (Davenport-Iowa and Libertyville-Illinois) in the 90’s.\n\nLino Patruno lives in Rome, where he is also involved in cinema.

Enthusiastic of Brazilian music, also with Elis Regina, Chico Buarque, Ivan Lins, Cesar Camargo Mariano. To the 86 years, the Belgian Toots Thielemans comes to the Ceará for the tenth edition of the Festival Jazz & Blues, with shows in Guaramiranga and $fortaleza. Before, he talked, he saw email, with Notebook 3\n\nAlready its in the Festival of Guaramiranga has some years had an expectation on a participation. What it took the one that its presence alone if confirmed now? Which its expectation?\n\nIn my age (86, almost 87), still I am in good form and very am requested. Therefore the offers for show have that to incase themselves in the agenda, that to the times is very concurred. We are happy that this year let us have conditions to accept offers. Brazil has a special place in my heart. When my entrepreneur said that he offers was viable joust and, I to me accepted immediately.\n\nThe fact of being able to bring its proper musicians (he was decisive)?\n\nTo travel of the Europe to Brazil demand much energy. When you burrow with local musicians, need assays extra, to know the musicians, to adapt the repertoire. Therefore I prefer to come with my musicians, to keep energy for shows. Obviously, it would not go to say ´Não´ if Ivan Lins could appear…\n\nHow it is to be in palco with these musicians (the baterista Bruno Castelucci, the stock exchange operator Bart de Noolf and the pianista Karel Boehlee)?\n\nWe touch together frequently in the Europe, Japan and, in the last time in 2006, São Paulo and Rio De Janeiro. They know the repertoire, are versatile and they give the necessary support to me. Moreover, we are very next friends.\n\nYou would point some prominences in the show? The public can wait releituras of Brazilian musics?\n\nHe is difficult to say. Each auditorium reacts of a different form. We touch with sincerity, of the heart, and wait a good dialogue with the public. The reaction of the auditorium is always very important. E I find that the majority of the people knows of my affinity with the Brazilian Brazil, music and musicians, for which I have a great respect.\n\nIt could say a little on the composition of ´Bluesette´? Many great names of the jazz count that, when composing musics that would come to make great success, they did not have the minimum idea, or pretension, of that this came to happen. Was this the case with this music?\n\nI was in a show in Brussels, dividing the dressing-room with (the French violinista) Stephane Grappelli. It was touching my guitar, Stephane heard and said: ´Mon to cher Toots, c´est joli´. (expensive Toots ´Meu, this is bom´). I answered: ´Stephane, you me inspira´. First, I gave to music the name of ´Bluette´, in reference to the small blue flower of the fields. Later, producer said a Swedish me: ´Toots, is one blues, why you does not put ´s´ in the name? ´. It never was a success, but it was a good card of presentation.\n\nBeing reference as gaitista, the fact calls attention you to have started its career as guitarist. Which are the souvenirs to touch the guitar, in the start?\n\nUp to two years behind, I continued touching guitar. E before passer for a spill (he has 20 years more than), I touched very well. I eventually started my career as guitarist, having the possibility to touch the gaita, for example, with Benny Goodman, George Shearing. I started to be a little known when I started to assoviar and to touch the guitar in unison. I learned very on harmony, through the guitar.\n\nHaving touched with the biggest names of the jazz, which you would say that they had had a particular influence, stronger, on its way to think music and to touch?\n\nDjango Reinhardt, Louis Armstrong, Bill Evans, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Jaco Pastorius and many, many others. I still continue hearing what he happens today. Mine he very helps iPhone me in this. In the Youtube also costumo to hear what he is happening currently. E I learn what to touch and what not to touch.\n\nYou agree to the ones point that it as one of last ´lendas vivas´ of the jazz? How you feel yourself with this?\n\nIn the last month of October I became Master Jazz in the United States. It is the distinction higher than if he can obtain as a musician of jazz in U.S.A., mainly because I am the first European. Clearly that I do not touch better because of this heading, but I admit that I am proud of it. He has some years I became Comendador of the Order of the Rio Branco. The Brazilian ambassador delivered this homage to me and one year later the minister of the Culture, Gilbert Gil, delivered the honor diploma to me. I have much pride in being recognized for the Brazilians.\n\nWhich the secret to remain itself all throughout this time, without losing the route?\n\nTo the times you lose the route, but music brings to it in return to the way. I always say: ´Siga what it emociona´.Se you had that to indicate a moment or decisive event for its musical career - a point from which the things had started to happen -, which it would be? I already was interested in music the three years of age, but really I was contaminated by the virus of the jazz when I heard for the first time Louis Armstrong and the Mills Brothers.\n\nIt could in saying a little to them on its meeting with John Lennon? It remembers some related curious situation to the gaitista of the Beatles?\n\nThe first time that the Beatles had come the New York, I was sent by the company of guitars to show to my Rickenbacker the John Lennon. It had seen the guitar in the layer of one of records of George Shearing. E said me to it, in its sotaque of Liverpool: ´Se this guitar is good the sufficient pra George Shearing, then with certainty pra is good mim´.\n\nWhich are its souvenirs of the chances to touch with Brazilian musicians? Elis Regina, Astrud Gilbert, Cesar Camargo Mariano, who also comes to the festival…\n\nThe record with Elis Regina moves still me. E when I hear records ´Toots Thielemans Brazil Project´ 1 and 2, I feel myself proud very. This production was made by Miles Goodman and Oscar Castrate-Snow, whom the telephone of all had these great musicians, Eliane Elias, Gilbert Gil, Ivan Lins, Milton Nasciamento, Caetano Veloso, Bonfá Luis, Chico Buarque, Dori Caymmi, Djavan… Really I was blessed by the contribution of all they.\n\nPassed year, Ivan Lins made two shows full in Guaramiranga. You costuma to touch musics of it. How it would define the influence of it on its music?\n\nWe already touch together very and until we journey in the United States and the Europe, with the ´Brasil Project´. Turnê with the Orchestra of the Radio of the Denmark has some years made one. It is one of the greaters musicians of the present time. In all mine shows I touch a music of it, and with much pleasure.\n\nSome new Brazilian gaitista flame its attention? You have plans to use to advantage the trip to enter in contact with local musicians?\n\nBy good friend Maurício keeps me to Einhonrn informed on what he is happening in terms of gaita in Brazil. It always me of a possibility to hear young musicians, very interesting. Many of them come to mine shows, and always are very thanked by this interest. I have in mine iPhone many records of these musicians.\n\nHaving attended as many changes throughout the history of music and the fonográfica industry, you it deals well with resources as ´mp3-players´ and the exchange of music for the Internet? Which its palpite on as this form of relationship of the people with music goes to configure itself in the future?\n\nI try to follow the market and hear much music using iPhone. My entrepreneur low (legally) some musics, my order. How much to the businesses, I find that the market always goes to find a way to make the thing to happen. In my field of ´jazz´, most of what profit comes of shows.\n\nTo finish, a question flautista it and pertaining to the state of Ceará professor Heriberto Port, that liveed in Belgium per 12 years and touched with the baterista Ian de Hass. Question if you intend to touch some song of Jacques Brel here, as ´Ne me quitte pas´.\n\nJan de Haas is an excellent baterista, and I work frequently with it in the Europe. It deferred payment close to me. E, if the auditorium to want to hear ´Ne me quitte pas´, goes to be happy in touching.\n\nInterview by DALWTON MOURA\n\nHypnotist Sounds\n\nIn the festival everything is Jazz, of Ouro Preto, in 2005, an auditorium of more than 500 people - formed for demanding jazzófilos, neophytes and adepts of prog rock - vibrated with the hypnotist inventions musical (and sonic), between in and out, of the trio Jacob Fred Odyssey Jazz.\n\nIn the occasion, the group born in Tulsa (Oklahoma), in 1994, was a newness, and finishes to launch, for the stamp indie Kufala, the COMPACT DISC Slow breath, silent mind. Reed Mathis (low acoustic with pedal, capable to raise in two eighth above-normal a noise of the instrument), Brian Haas (acoustic piano) and Jason Smart (battery) were then the integrant ones of the trio, almost so hiperativo as the Bad Plus, “even so more composicional”, over all in the recriações of classics of the modern jazz, as Fables of Faubus (Charles Mingus), Naima (John Coltrane) and minor Off (Thelonious Monk).\n\nThe JFJO turned quartet, in middle of the passed year, with Josh Raymer in the place of Smart, Matt Hayes in the one of Mathis and the addition of the guitarist Chris Combs. But, before this, in March, it recorded in studio the virtual album Winterwood, that can be downloaded, of favour, in the site of the group (www.jfjo.com), that it makes question to keep the surrealist name of Jacob Fred - nickname invented for Haas for proper itself when it was adolescent. One is about a gift of the pianista-leader, commemorative of the 15 years of the JFJO. E also marks the farewell of the bonanza Reed Mathis, that signs six of the 13 bands of the “record” and arranges Song of the vipers (Louis Armstrong), beyond touching its basses developed, banjo and guitars (also lap steel, that hawaiian guitar-board, generally of six ropes).\n\nThe initial band, Dove's army of love (6m15), of Mathis, indicates the predominant climate of the session, with the subject kept in ostinato for the acoustic piano of Haas, while the stock exchange operator-guitarist and the drummer-percussionist raise, to the few, the rhythmic-sonic temperature of the environment, brightened up here and there for interludes of the pianist. It is difficult to need, accurately, where and when the improvisation prevails on the arranged parts.\n\nSong of vipers (5m40) is one of the most attractive moments of the album, over all for the contrast second enters the rhythm line of brass bands of New Orleans and backbeat insolente (with shining exclamações of plates and címbalos) created by Josh Raymer. It and Haas are also the prominences in the metamorphosis of the part of Ellington (6m40), in which he seems to have parts in overdub. Old love, new love (5m58) and bird (6m13), both of the pianista-composer-arranjador, are melodicamente insinuantes, with delicate bachianas variations of Haas in this last one, developing in way the discrete electronic punctuations and interventions of the guitar of Mathis. This, in turn, is the star of The slip (7m15), also of its cultivates. Crazy fingers (4m48), from Jerry Garci'a, receives from the JFJO a beautiful treatment, good bluesy, and brings long and delicate a ground of Haas in the acoustic piano.\n\nThe JFJO produces a type of emotional acoustic-electronic jazz at the same time and intellectual, to the times until camerístico, without rejecting the roots of they mainstream, mainly most popular, as if it can hear in Earl Hines (4m15), of Mathis. The group is not considered to compete with the hiperenergético trio The Bad Plus (Ethan Iverson, piano; David King, battery; Reid Anderson, low). Transformed into quarteto, the JFJO left in long turnê (sold out) for the United States, leaving in the Internet, to the disposal of its fans, the last register of the happy Haas-Mathis association.\n\nDavid Sanchez arrives with his eigth album as leader at a point of new artistic authority in this inspirational album. Part of that authority lies in the enhanced soundscape of his tenor sax (aided by reeds from Francois Louis and superb recording by Don Murray at Sear Sound NY). This is a revelation compared with earlier albums and places him firmly in the same rarified territory as Sonny Rollins, Wayne Shorter and Joe Henderson. But part of that authority also lies in the ease with which he can allow space to his co-musicians.\n\nHere the partnership with Lage Lund on guitar is central. With the album based mainly around the lineup of a piano-less quartet (David Sanchez (tenor sax), Lage Lund (guitar), Ben Street (bass), Henry Cole or Adam Cruz (drums)), space is made very often in the form of sax/bass/drums or guitar/bass/drums trio sections; it takes real authority to stand back (as Miles Davis so often did) and let your musicians play.\n\nFor some time David Sanchez has been engaging with the issues surrounding the African diaspora; for example, how the uprooting of peoples to live under tyranny in the sugar fields of a country like Puerto Rica (his place of birth) and its long term consequences can be understood, brought into public awareness and valued. A poem by his sister Margarita points to the contradiction between the commonplace acceptance of molasses as an everyday commodity and the agony that went into its production. \"Molasses, enriched by the blood of a people, harvested from a soil in agony, sprouts a tender shoot of hope\".\n\nAnd it is that hope that informs this music. For this, in the end, is the truth of the blues (and jazz) tradition; the triumph of hope over experience, the denial of bitterness, transcendence of the corrupting reality by a creativity that draws from those ancient roots and is so life affirming that it cannot be denied. The range, open mindedness and sheer musical inventiveness of \"Cultural Survival\" speaks eloquently to that transcendence. As David Sanchez says modestly of the album: \"It's generally about the human condition.\"\n\nMusically, the album is in clear post bop jazz territory. What might be regarded as latin influences lead not to Jobim or Cuban influenced jazz (as sometimes on earlier David Sanchez albums) but more to the introduction of those elements into mainstream jazz in a way similar to how this was achieved by Joe Henderson or Wayne Shorter.\n\nThis is apparent in the treatment of Thelonious Monk's \"Monk's Mood\", altered from the spiny piano blues plus John Coltrane of the original into a sensuous invocation that is wholly in the spirit of the innovators who had gathered at Minton's Playhouse. No surprise then, that Dizzie Gillespie was one of the far sighted who recognized David Sanchez's talents as a young musician and offered guidance and encouragement.\n\nThe other adaptation is Eddie Palmieri's \"Adoracion\", transformed from its salsa origins into high energy, shifting tempo post bop. David Sanchez appeared on the Eddie Palmieri album \"Listen Here!\" and acknowledges his admiration for his music in the liner notes to this album.\n\nThe remaining six tracks are all original compositions. \"Coast To Coast\", \"Ay Bendito\" and \"The Forgotten Ones\" make the most of the open piano-less quartet, presenting lithe music of spaciousness, intensity and beauty. David Sanchez's tenor sax forms the sure centre and Lage Lund's guitar playing is especially good, the interplay between the two instruments in the shared sections showing real rapport. Both featured quartets shine.\n\nDanilo Perez (noted recently for his work in the Wayne Shorter Quartet) adds keyboards on \"Manto Azul\" and \"Cultural Survival\", filling out the sound with characteristic perceptiveness. Robert Rodriguez adds piano and Fender Rhodes to the final track, \"La Leyenda del Canaveral\".\n\n\"La Leyenda del Canaveral\" is a twenty minute composition in itself. It is addressed specifically to the poem \"Molasses\" penned by David Sanchez's sister. The composition was commissioned by Chamber Music America's New Works: Creation and Presentation Programme and the Doris Duke Foundation and was first performed in Puerto Rico.on March 24, 2007 and then in New York on October 17, 2007. Musical influences include music from East Cameroon (particularly the Baca forest people), Tanzania, Ethiopia, Mali and the Caribbean. It is an ambitious piece that takes these sources as inspiration yet remains within the tradition of mainstream jazz.\n\nhttp://100greatestjazzalbums.blogspot.com/2008/05/cultural-survival-david-sanchez-concord.html"
