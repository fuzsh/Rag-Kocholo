        "text": "Music By Mail would like to support and present you the great work of 3 companies who are specialized in brazilian music, be it new releases or first releases from the vaults of this fascinating country. Those companies are Malandro, Far Out and Whatmusic. But we also work closely with Liser, one of the big distributors. So don't cry, we'll get it home for you!\n\n+Brasil: Vortex. Voiceprint Brazil VPB119CD. Street date: 09/07/07. +BRASIL is a fusion jazz and instrumental Brazilian band. The group was set up to continue the work vibraphone player Beto Caldas was developing with some other Brazilian jazz musicians. Beto Caldas is a famous veteran of the Brazilian jazz scene, having been played actively with several groups throughout the seventies, among them Pé Ante Pé, with percussionist Caito Marcondes and saxophonist Chico Guedes, as well as with Arrigo Barnabé and his band Sabor de Veneno. In order to keep his work as writer and arranger he felt the need to set up this group +Brasil in 2006, whose main characteristic is the peculiar, extremely pleasing and enthralling sound of the vibraphone, with support from the rhythm section with piano, bass and drums. His writing style leads us through new paths of the Brazilian instrumental music, samba, baião, bossa nova and plenty of room for improvisation. The sound evolves with surprising harmonies and melodies with influences from Tom Jobim, through Hermeto Pascoal to Progressive Rock where many colours and textures are explored through several dynamics and rhythms with a \"Brazilian flavour\". A refined work with subtleties that please the senses.\n\nAdnet, Mario : + Jobim Jazz. Biscoito Fino. July 2011. This is the second opus of this project, dedicated to jazz interpretations of Jobim's music. The good thing here is that the track list presents 13 lesser known compositions by the maestro instead of indulging with another version of \"The Girl from Ipanema\" or any other worn out hits.\n\nAntonio Adolfo: Chora Baião. Sala de Som. July 2011. Through the three traditional and popular styles Baião, Samba and Choro, the pianist delivers here an album dedicated to the spirit of Brazilian musicians Guinga and Chico Buarque\n\nAquarela Carioca: Mundo Da Rua. 2008. This is the 6th release by this much interesting quintet, founded in 1988. Electronics is here used as a mean of expression juxtaposed to roots moods (Nordeste but also Africa) or setting in relief a dance version of Rimsky-Korsavok's Sheherazade!\n\nAvila, Felipe : Quase Tudo (EDITIO/LFSA02). 2008. For his third solo album, the guitarist and member of Percussônica teamed again with the great keyboardist Lelo Nazario but also brings in a stellar cast for his project, from legendary drummer and percussionist Nenê to Hermeto Pascoal's saxophonist and flutist Vinícius Dorin but with many more to discover! As usual, you can expect rich and complex musical structures with focus on beautifully crafted melodic material.\n\nBanda Black Rio: two reissues of this mythical group mixing R&B, jazz and samba and much appreciated by DJ's who used them heavily for remixes.\n\n+ Gafieira Universal. Their 2nd album from 78 is now available on CD and remastered. Sony/BMG Brasil CSB 664375\n\n+ Saci Perere. 3rd and last record, released in 1980.

Experimental performance by two masters, Barnabé with his knowledge of electronics, Braga with his mastery of improvisation.

Ben's first full-length record, this 1963 release contains the hit singles \"Mas Que Nada\" and \"Chove Chuva\" and is replete with swirling bossa nova rhythms and soaring choruses. Its big-band-style accompa­niment, nicely off-set by Ben's signature minor-tone guitar workings, propels the set into an upbeat and enjoyable listening.\n\nLuiz Bonfa: Brazil's King Of The Bossa Nova And Guitar. Doxy Audiophile Clear Vinyl Series (ACV2045). 02/02/15. Accompanied by an unidentified horn and rhythm section and recorded in Paris in 1962 and '63, the album features original compositions, many of them coauthored by Maria Helena Toledo, and features Bonfa's rhythmically charged guitar style and his extraordinary, expressive vocal. First edition of 500 numbered copies.\n\nCerebro Eletronico: Deus E O Diabo No Liquidificador. Tratore. July 2011. This is the third album by this band from São Paulo; post-tropicalia mixed with nu Brazil and pop accentuations.\n\nAlaíde Costa: Alaíde Costa Canta Milton. Lua Music. MPB. 2008. One of the great Brazilian female voices and interpret of Brazilian songs meets one of the great composers of this country!\n\nLennie Dale: Um Show De Bossa... Doxy (ACV2051). Feb. 2015. Released on Audiophile Clear Vinyl (ACV) and pressed on 140g vinyl, this album sees singer Lennie Dale backed by Bossa Tres, the renowned Bossa jazz combo lead by pianist Luiz Carlos Vinhas, with Edison Machado on drums and Tiao Neto on bass. The format is very spontaneous and relaxed, similar to an American live jazz vocal date of the time, but with a bossa groove instead.\n\nEumir Deodato! A very special set of six classic albums from the heyday of the Bossa Nova wave is available again in limited digipack edition reissues, released on the label Ubatuqui.

Biscoito Fino. 2008. An ambitious challenge is to release an album with focus on one of the most daring composers of modern Brazilian music: multi-instrumentist Egberto Gismonti. But singer Jane Duboc has the talent necessary for interpreting such pieces and she knows who to get around her for succesfully fulfilling the mission: the drummer on her first LP João Cortês, one of Gismonti's fidel partners, bassist Zeca Assumpção and another Gismonti alumni, saxophonist, flutist and true legend Mauro Senise; and more surprises to discover!\n\nDuo Taufic / Barbara Casini: Terras.

After several years of collaborating and touring, Duo Taufic, together with the most Brazilian of all Italian singers, record an album to celebrate the living tradition of a land: the Northeast of Brazil - a metaphor of all the \"terras\" in the world, where beauty and suffering are intensely mingled together. Duo Taufic and Barbara Casini do this with unequaled energy and love, which is felt in every note.\n\nEl Kinto: Complete Collection. Lion Productions (LION 612). Same reason here to include this band in our Brazilian pages! Inspired by the way the Tropicalistas like Os Mutantes were transforming the pop music of Brazil, El Kinto embraced their own native music forms'but, as always, they went a step further: yes, they integrated candombe and bossa nova into beat music, but they also added their own notion of \"psicodelics\". They experimented with newness in all its variety new sounds from their guitars, new types of vocal delivery, new ways of striking the drums (with little brooms, with gavels or with the hands), all very uncommon in rock music. This special slip-case edition comes with an oversized 36-page full-blown booklet packed with photos, detailed band history, and lyrics for this most important of Uruguayan bands.\n\nGemini V: En Mexico (ON On-39). Mexican release. Brazilian bossa-nova combo from the late 60's, this was formed by Luis Carlos Vinhas on piano, along with Bossa Tres trio and a couple of other musicians. This album was recorded live in Mexico while touring there. A wonderful bossa nova album, tracklist including \"Samba De Verao\", \"Aqua De Beber\", \"Garota De Ipanema\" and others.\n\nJoão Gilberto: Bossa Nova! Doxy LP+CD (DOK 206). Feb. 2014.

These albums influenced so many musicians both at home (Caetano Veloso, Jorge Ben, etc.) and abroad (Stan Getz, Herbie Mann, Charlie Byrd) that they effectively changed the way people both made and listened to music, along with putting Brazilian artists officially on the map.\n\nJoão Gilberto: S/T. Klimt Records (MJJ332LP). LP with embossed cover, limited edition of 1000 copies. 16/02/12. Originally released in 1973, João Gilberto aka The White Album, is a timeless classic of the genre and one of João's definitive masterpieces. Featuring only the minimalist drumming of NY jazz drummer Sonny Carr and some backing vocals on the final track, João spins a delicate web of sound that from the first notes of Tom Jobim's anthem \"Águas De Março\" has the listener dreaming of Bahia, even though the album was recorded in a New Jersey studio with electronic music pioneer Wendy Carlos at the controls. This is bossanova at its very best.\n\nDani Gurgel: Viadutos. Boranda. Oct. 2011. Recorded live in São Paulo, this album will certainly confirm the talents of this songwriter: pop jazz with sophisticated harmonies and anchored in the many facets of the Brazilian musical traditions, performed with joy and passion!\n\nH3O: La Música De H3O (OP-21). Another rare Mexican album from the late 60's, blending bossa nova, jazz and pop music. This is their only album and features covers of people like Jorge Ben, John Barry, Beatles and others. Mini-lp replica.\n\nHB Tronix: São Paulo Acoustic Jazz House. Tratore. Nov. 2011.

Delira Musica. Nov. 2011. Yes, already 4th opus from this trio led by guitarist Hamleto Stamato. With Ney Conceição on bass and Erivelton Silva on drums, he moves between modern MPB and samba jazz, with a melodic lyricism, harmonic refinement and rhythmic flexibility. From well known jazz standards like \"Softly as in a Morning Sunrise\" to Jobim's classics or compositions by Luiz Eça (the Dolphin), the road is broad and varied.\n\nTom Jobim / Vinícius De Moraes / João Gilberto : Um Encontro. Doxy Audiophile Clear Vinyl Series (ACV2046). 02/02/15. Rediscovered and remastered this LP is the historical memory of an important moment in Brazilian music. Imagine yourself in the summer of 1962.

The venue is the restaurant Au Bon Gourmet in Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro. The date August 2, 1962. The rest, as they say, is history... First edition of 500 numbered copies.\n\nJoyce: Curriculum. Microservice. May 2011. This album is a collection of the earliest recordings made by Joyce between 1964 and 1972; rarities and singles, traces of tropicalia and experimentation, starting with a track by the group Sambacana recorded at the instigation of Roberto Menescal and ending right at the time when she would make her cult-worshiped landmark album of pastoral acoustic psychedelia with Nelson Angelo in 1972.\n\nNara Leão: Nara. Doxy (DOK226). LP+CD. Street date: 15-06-14. Dig-A-Log release of the debut album by the muse of bossa nova.

Delira Musica. May 2011. This new CD by the percussionist, hailing from Bahia, is the result of five years of work.

Absolutely unknown album from 1968. Los Dominc's were one of the most active combos in Mexico City where they played every night with a repertoire that included bossa nova as well as romantic melodies arriving from the USA, France and Italy. This rare album captures one of their shows (with good, perfect sound), where they perform classics by Luis Bonfa, Edu Lobo, Sergio Mendes or Jorge Ben, as well as cover tunes. Mexican release with mini-LP replica, with insert.\n\nSome interesting records can also be found on the japanese label Avant. Like Romero Lubambo 's first solo album called \"Lubambo\". Lubambo is a brazilian guitarist with an incredible technique and imagination. Or Cyro Baptista \"Vira Loucos\", which delivers a fresh vision of the brazilian composer Villa Lobos. He is assisted on this record by the two guitarists Marc Ribot and Romero Lubambo, the saxophonist John Zorn and a bunch of percussion players!!\n\nCarlos Malta: Prana. Delira Musica. July 2011. if you're playing the flute, this album is for you as it is entirely dedicated to solo playing of the instrument and its various types, here several from the ethnic Yawalapiti origin and the Chinese Di-Zi.\n\nTania Maria is again to be discovered! The Danish label Stunt Records has indeed released on a 2CD two albums until now only available as LPs. Those albums started Tania's reputation in Scandinavia. The first one is a live recording from 78 at the famous jazz club Montmartre. Tania Maria is here accompanied by her French rythm section: André Ceccarelli on drums and Marc Bertaux on electric bass. One year later she recorded a duo session with the late great Dane with the unending name, bassist Niels Henning Ørsted Petersen. Highly recommended!\n\nMariano, Cesar Camargo & Romero Lubambo: Duo. A great pianist and arranger together with the exceptional guitarist interpret here Djavan, Jobim, Clifford Brown and their own compositions.\n\nMariano, Pedro: 8. Nau. Nov. 2011. As the title implies, this is the 8th album by the man; what we may not know is that he is Maria Rita's brother, in other words the son of Cesar Camargo Mariano and Elis Regina. Having used the last years to achieve his independence in the hard money oriented music branch, he comes here with an album mixing pop jazz and MPB; especially noteworthy is the choice of a new generation of young composers like Tó Brandileone, Pedro Altério, Pedro Viáfora (all members of the band 5 a Seco) and the presence of Jair Oliveira, ensuring continuity and maturity\n\nMateo, Eduardo: Mateo Solo Bien Se Lame. Lion Productions (LION 613). Mateo was a Uruguayan singer, songwriter, guitarist and arranger. He played a key role in the development of the modern Uruguayan pop music mixing rock, jazz, bossa nova and local rhythms like candombe, in a similar way than Brazilian Tropicalismo. That's one of the reasons why we put him here as well as because of an often met comparison with Caetano Veloso. He was an enigmatic figure, moved to Argentina in October 71. With the explosion of candombe-beat music on the popular scene, he quickly became a living legend. The first Lion Productions volume of Mateo's solo recordings includes the entire \"Mateo Solo Bien Se Lame\" album, plus a variety of tracks from Mateo's early solo years. The eight bonus tracks include songs originally issued in Uruguay on the legendary \"Musicasión 4 1/2\" LP, two tracks live from a bowling alley (!), as well as four very special early recordings backing female singers: two sung by the lovely Diane Denoir, and two by the mysterious Verónica Indart. Special slip-case edition comes with an oversize 48-page full-blown booklet packed with photos, text, and lyrics, which tries to unravel some of the myth surrounding this great surrealist poet and drug casualty, whose decline and ultimate madness and early death have done nothing to diminish his stature as one of the greatest artists in South American music.\n\nMehmari, Andre : Canteiro. Tratore. Nov. 2011. This ambitious project recorded on a double CD is dedicated to the world of songs and the human voice; a host of singers and musicians are taking part in the project, for ex. Mônica Salmaso among the singers; all compositions are penned by Mehmari, surely a name to follow in the future!\n\nMehmari, André & Hamilton de Holanda: Gismontpascoal (A musica de Egberto e Hermeto). As the title implies, this is an album focusing on two vital Brazilian composers: Egberto Gismonti & Hermeto Pascoal and two instruments: piano and mandolin\n\nMiltinho: Miltinho E' Samba. Doxy (DOK227). LP+CD. Street date: 15-06-14. Milton Santos de Almeida aka Miltinho has a respectable resume in Brazilian music. Singer and instrumentalist, leader in several sambas ensemble with great success. His first instrument prior to vocal duties was the tambourine. He was member of one of the first panderista vocal ensemble in Brazil combining two skills: singing and playing. And speaking of bands, Miltinho was present in one of the most successful group in the 1940s, the Anjos do Inferno, who came to tour with Carmen Miranda. This album also benefits of the accompaniment of Orquestra RGE with arrangements and musical direction by Maestro Rubens Perez (Pocho) and Nelsinho.\n\nMarisa Monte: O Que Você Quer Saber De Verdade. EMI. Oct. 2011. New album, the first since \"Universo ao meu Redor\", from 2006. 14 musicians are called for duty to fulfill the mission!\n\nMorello & Barth: Bossa Nova Legends. In+Out (IOR 77065). The two arrangers have here created a perfect backing for the sensual singing of Alaide Costa & Johnny Alf; but they also set in relief two stars of the bossa nova: Leny Andrade & Pery Ribeiro.\n\nMorild: Brazilian Soundscapes. Gvito Records (GVR005CD). Street date: 13-11-20. Unusual on several aspects, this release is first of all a Brazilian jazz take by a Norwegian duo: guitarist Marius Gundersen and trombone player Dag Einar Eilertsen. Reinforced here with bass and percussion, they follow their critics acclaimed debut album «Nordic Landscapes» from 2018 with a new one, delving into compositions by among other Egberto Gismonti, Jobim or Caymmi. As on their first album , the second surprise comes from the sonic coupling of classical guitar to alt trombone but they already have received a lot of praise for precisely making this alliance sound brilliantly!\n\nNara: S/T. Doxy LP+CD (DOK226). 19/06/14. Nara sings beautiful samba, soft and sweet, moody and sensuous, and her sexy voice made her earn the reputation as one of the outstanding talents of her generation.

One of Milton Nascimento's most experimental albums, originally released in 1974. It can be said that this album was especially suited for the talents of percussionist Nana Vasconcelos, who adds so much life to it. In addition to Vasconcelos, Nascimento works here with some of Brazil's most innovative jazz players of the '70s -- Nelson Angelo, Toninho Horta, Paulo Moura, and Wagner Tiso\n\n- Minas (Water 173). One of Milton Nascimento's beautiful albums from the 70's, originally released in 1976.\n\nO Terço : O Terço Ao Vivo No Canecão. 2005 saw the return of one of the major representatives of Brazilian prog/psychedelic rock, the group O Terço. The show they gave has been fixed on both CD and DVD and presented most of the original line-up, singer and keyboardist Flavio Venturini being the most known of all since he never really left the musical scene after the split of the band and made a successful career in own name\n\nPascoal, Hermeto & Morena, Aline: Bodas de Latão. Following \"Chimarrão\", here's the follower, presenting both new and old things by Pascoal, one song by Aline, a Piazzola composition and some gaúcho folklore! While Pascoal deals with cavaquinho, piano, 10-string guitar (viola), trumpet, flutes, bass and the usual obscurities, Aline sings and plays the piano, some body percussion and zabumba drums.\n\nHermeto Pascoal E Grupo: \"Mundo Verde Esperança\" on the label ROB Digital.\n\nRosa Passos: É Luxo Só.

Available on CD or DVD. The pianist and the reedman have worked together several times in the past with various projects; here's a new one, dedicated to the timeless and universal compositions of Noel Rosa, who would have been 100 years in 2010 had he lived that long. The duo piano / alt sax and flute is at times augmented with the voice of singer Alaide Costa.\n\nPescara, Jorge: Grooves in the Temple. Voiceprint Brasil VPB114CD. This is the debut solo album by the most important bassist in Brazil's contemporary jazz scene (Jorge Pescara), who has recorded and toured worldwide with Dom Um Romão. Pescara is backed by many living legends of the Brazilian jazz scene such as keyboardist Eumir Deodato (of CTI fame), conga master Laudir de Oliveira (Chicago, Joe Cocker, Chick Corea, Sadao Watanabe), Brazil's jazz diva Ithamara Koorax (voted one of the Top 4 best jazz singers in the Down Beat 2002 Readers Poll) , guitarist Luiz Bonfá (the legendary composer of \"Black Orpheus\", heard here in his last recording session) and many more ...\n\nPinheiro, Leila : Raiz. Atração. Nov. 2011. The new album by the singer is an ambitious and challenging project, centered around a musical search related to the huge Amazonia forest. Ethnically rooted but with a clear jazz perspiration, a team of great players around her, produced by Marco Bosco & Paulo Calasans, this is absolutely an album to check!\n\nPowell, Baden : À Vontade. Jeanne Dielman (JD108). Street date: 28-04-16. À Vontade is one of his earliest recordings and a beautiful piece of early 60's bossa nova and samba.

Very rare bossa nova album. Which year it is exactly from, we don't know! Should be late 60's I'd say. The album seems to have been released only in Mexico. Mini-LP replica.\n\nQuarteto Em Cy & Tamba Trio: Som Definitivo. Audio Clarity (ACL004). Street date: 02-08-18. Reissue on 180 gram vinyl!\n\nQuarteto Novo: S/T. May 2011.

Warner. Oct. 2011. New album by Elis' daughter (her fourth), recorded in studio in Rio.\n\nRozana: Rozana (VR-39) + Vol. 2 (VR-42). Obscure albums by Brazilian singer Rozana, only released in Mexico, the first mentioned being from 1966, I think. Bossa Nova.\n\nMonica Salmaso E Paulo Bellinati: Os Afro-Sambas. GSP Records. Reissue. The Afro-Sambas mixed the popular bossa nova style with African musical elements into an operatic story-line in which rituals of the Orixás (Gods) are told. Baden Powell and Vinícius de Moraes, one of the most fruitful collaboration from Brazil, explored the Afro-Brazilian roots of Bahia, incorporating musical idea drawn from the regional Capoeira (a popular dance-like martial art form of Brazil) and the Candomblé (the main Afro-Brazilian religion). Produced and arranged by Paulo Bellinati, the challenge of this project was to reveal the musical language of Baden and Vinícius in a contemporary style, without losing the character of the original work. Going beyond the traditional accompaniment, the guitar parts are so intricate, they could stand alone as complete compositions!

It was in 1973 that the legendary Argentinean producer Alfredo Radoszynski discovered Maria Nazareth and Arnaldo Henriques during a party that Sebastiao Tapajos had organized in his home city of Rio de Janeiro. Impressed by the swing and sophistication of these two young Brazilian artists, he invited them to Buenos Aires, along with Sebastiao Tapajos, to record TAP, which would, during the following thirty years, become one on the most sought after Bossa records - a status that owed just as much to its artistic exclusive Argentinean pressing. TAP single-handedly symbolises the richness and diversity of the sound « do Brasil ». Universal for good.\n\nTibless: Afro Beat Ado. Tratore. Nov. 2011.

Lilith Records Dig-A-Log (LR340LP). 28/06/12. 180 gram LP with free CD of the album. Originally released in 1969, this album is one of the most significant in Brazilian musical history, spearheading the musical Tropicalia revolution lead by Brazilian legends Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil, not to mention Gal Costa and mutant rockers Os Mutantes.

This album helped land Veloso and Gil a brief stint in jail and eventually in political exile in the UK.\n\nNana Vasconcelos \"Fragments\" is not especially a new thing but the label Tzadik released it at a time where it was only available in Brasil as \"Fragmentos\".

Altrisuoni AS206. 2006. This young trio will bring you to high levels of pleasure.

Bugre Records (7 899004 724790). 2008. André Marques was for quite some years Hermeto's pianist and there's no doubt that the old man's spirit and ideas inhabit this album; harmonic and rhythmic complexity, richness of instrumental colours, joy in crazy positive creativity, spirited soli are what you can expect from this unique large ensemble, in which Marques himself is hardly playing, focusing his responsability in the composing, arranging and conducting.\n\nSergio Mendes: Bom Tempo & Bom Tempo Remixed. 2010. The first CD is a collection of remakes dedicated to the great Brazilian composers (Jobim, Nascimento, João Donato, Moacir Santos, etc...), treated with the usual Mendes smooth tone, though with heavier hip hop beats.

The new wave of bossa nova is back, almost 40 years after it swept through the Americas\n\n+ Revisited Classics. 1998 (ZIR 01). An updated album of smooth soulful themes recorded by new and classic Bossa Nova stars. The songs were reconstructed by three young Carioca DJ/Producers (Marcelo Da Lua, Alexandre Moreira and Marcio Menescal, son of original Bossa Nova master Roberto Menescal).\n\n+ Brasilidade. 2001 (ZIR 06). Jazzy electronic bossa nova which heavily features the unique guitar and scat styles of veteran bossa hero Roberto Menescal\n\n+ Uma Batida Differente. 2004 (ZIR 18). This could be presented as the culmination of years of research and love for the past, the present, and the future of Brazilian music. There is in the new album the classic sound of key figures from the original bossa nova generation, the ultramodern beats and production of Amsterdam's Zuco 103, the samba soul grooves and vocals of Trio Mocotó and a rare appearance by the amazing Orlann Divo (on his evergreen tune \"Onde Anda Meu Amor\", also featuring the great Bebeto on guitar). And much more yet!\n\nCibelle is probably Brazil's most exciting new musical talent today. 25 years old and Cibelle Cavalli from her real name, she has already garnered many valuable years of experience in recording studios, on live stages and at the bars, clubs and restaurants that make up São Paulo's vibrant live scene. Her discography can be summed up as follows:\n\n+ São Paulo Confessions. 1999 (ZIR 03). This album is by musician, composer and producer Suba, born in Novi Sad, Yugoslavia. He became in a very short time one of Brazil's leading producers and was part of the new generation of Brazilian artists who are reappropriating electronic sounds & beats, blending them with elements from all styles of Brazilian music. Cibelle performs here some songs as main vocalist on several tracks. Other guests appearing on the album include among others Nordeste band Mestre Ambrosio and guitarist Andre Geraissatti (D'Alla trio, Egberto Gismonti). Tragically, Suba passed away in a fire in 1999, a few days after the release of this album\n\n+ Suba Tributo. 2002 (ZIR 13). Tribute album organized by the label Ziriguiboom and Suba's close collaborators. It comprises new tracks, posthumous collaborations, remixes and live recordings. + Cibelle. 2003 (ZIR 15). Undoubtedly a \"Brazilian\" album, it is just as much a jazz album. And an electronic album. And a spiritual album. Cibelle takes us on a sonic journey into bossa nova and downtempo electronic music via tropicalia, samba soul, psychedelic post-rock and jazz.The project is peppered with a host of venerable musicians and guest vocalists from Cuba to France, mixed in London. Also noteworthy is the presence of bossa Brazilian veteran Johnny Alf.\n\n+ Cibelle: About A Girl. 2005 (ZIboom 12). This dual disc contains a CD audio side with 4 brand new songs and a DVD side presenting 4 videos made by Cibelle and Elsa Dahmani. + the much awaited 2nd album should be ready for October 2005.\n\nFonseca, Celso . Regular collaborator of Gilberto Gil, Marisa Monte, Caetano Veloso & more, this seductive Brazilian singer/guitarist has now 2 albums released.\n\n+ Natural. 2003 (ZIR 14). With a smooth and silky voice, Fonseca revisits the very roots of bossa/samba, sporting an instrumentation purposefully stripped down to his caressing sensual voice and magical acoustic guitar playing topped with percussion and acoustic bass. Recorded in Rio in 2002.\n\n+ Rive Gauche Rio. 2005 (ZIR24). The follower is an extension of what we heard in \"Natural\": warm, inspired, elegant, sensual, and dominated by Celso's caressing voice and splendid guitar playing. The instrumentation on this new album is a touch fuller than on the previous (several songs have a definite band feel, with drums, bass, a '60s-style Fender Rhodes as well as sparse woodwinds)\n\nGilberto, Bebel. Daughter of João Gilberto and surely one of the strong exponents of the new Brazilian scene of bossa nova updated with cool electronica. Her debut album has sold over a million copies around the globe! The discography is:\n\n+ Tanto Tempo. 2000 (ZIR 05). 7 original compositions and four reinterpretations of classic songs by Chico Buarque - her uncle by the way -, Marcos Valle and more ...\n\n+ Tanto Tempo Remixes (ZIR 10).

Helmed by producer and keyboardist Marius de Vries (Björk, Annie Lennox, Madonna), Bebel Gilberto was recorded in New York, London, Rio de Janeiro and Salvador, the capital of Bahia in Brazil's musically fecund northeast region. Covers, collaborations (Carlinhos Brown), originals and plenty of guest musicians are on the menu.\n\n+ Bebel Gilberto Remixed (ZIR 25). A collection in which all the tracks from the \"Bebel Gilberto\" album are given fresh, electronic interpretations by an international cast of dance / hip hop / electronica producers. The initial pressing will be a limited edition including a second, bonus CD containing 6 additional remixes.\n\nTrio Mocotó. Referred to by many as the \"Fathers of the samba soul beat\", the band was formed in the late '60s. Trio Mocotó was brought to fame in 1969, when they were invited by Jorge Ben to be his backing band. After several hit singles (including \"Coqueiro Verde\") under their own name, the Trio went on to record three albums, which have now become collectors' items. They're back now for a second life!\n\n+ Samba Rock. 2001 (ZIR 09). Their comeback album and first release since 1977. Super-original grooves and vocals, innovative power, tremendous humor and charm, a fresh new take on the style they contributed to create in the 70's (and which is becoming popular again today: there's a real samba soul/samba rock craze on the rise, in Brazil, Europe and North America). The album features a host of guest musicians (keyboards, guitars, percussion, horn section) plus a sprinkling of subtle electronic touches.\n\n+ Beleza ! Beleza !! Beleza !!! 2004 (ZIR 17). There are some changes in the band by now and a new vocalist / guitarist: Skowa makes his debut in this even stronger, funkier and groovier album. Around half of the songs on the album are new versions of classics, while the other half are brand-new compositions by the Trio members.\n\nZuco 103. Ever since the release of their debut album Outro Lado, the music of Zuco 103 has been acclaimed as one of the most exciting mixtures of electronics and Brazilian music. The growing discography has now:\n\n+ Outro Lado. 1999 (ZIR 04 ). Minimal & powerful electronic beats of a Dutch drummer fused with the jazz harmonies of a German keyboardist and topped by the extraordinary voice of Rio de Janeiro's Lilian Vieira. This cocktail will position them right at the forefront of the new Brazilian movement.\n\n+ The Other Side Of Outro Lado. 2001 (ZIR 08). Re-readings of tracks from their first album by an interesting collection of remixers from the UK, France and Brazil. In addition to the remixes, \"The Other Side\" also includes a totally re-recorded version of \"Zabumba No Mar\" featuring the entire brass section (six horn players) from jazz band The New Cool Collective as well as a live version of \"Outro Lado\" recorded by the Dutch television at the Paradiso Club in Amsterdam, in which Zuco 103 are joined by the mythical Airto Moreira, Brazil's most famous percussionist (known for his collaborations with Miles Davis, Chick Corea, etc...).\n\n+ Tales Of High Fever. 2002 (ZIR 12). With this album, they continue to push musical boundaries and draws their inspiration from traditional Brazilian rhythms and melodies, R'n'B, electronic beats, jazz & afro-beat.\n\n+ One Down One Up. 2003 (ZIR 16). 2CD presenting them on CD 1 at their acoustic, jazzy best. 9 tracks, recorded in a spirit similar to that of many jazz albums of the 60's : acoustic instrumentation, very few overdubs, warm & intimate atmosphere. CD2 contains a live recording of one of the band's legendary shows + 3 bonus tracks (2 remixes plus the mighty new version of \"Get Urself 2gether\")\n\n+ Whaa! 2005 (ZIR 22).

Recorded in Paris in 1976, the album is filled with a Tropicalia smell and features the great Nana Vasconcelos.\n\nGreat releases from Editio Princeps, check it out!\n\n+ A Divina Increnca: S/T. Editio Princeps (EDITIO 14). This CD brings together, for the first time, the complete sessions for the sole album by Divina Increnca, pioneers of the instrumental avant-garde scene in São Paulo between 1976 and 1981, together with bands such as Grupo Um & Pé Ante Pé. The band was a trio, featuring Felix Wagner on piano, alto clarinet, vibes, percussion, flute, the today quite known bass player (and producer) Rodolfo Stroeter and drummer, percussionist (including vibraphone) Azael Rodrigues. Besides the special 20-page booklet filled with previously unpublished photos and all-new liner notes by the artists themselves, this edition also includes 6 unreleased bonus cuts.\n\n+ Armazém Abaporu: Pedra Grande. Editio/11 2006. Armazém Abaporu was born in 2000, pushing the work boundaries of Brazilian masters like Hermeto Pascoal and Egberto Gismonti one step further, mixing traditional rhythms with jazz and contemporary music. This CD brings the complete first recordings of the band (released in 2002 in a small private edition), fully remastered, plus five live tracks, recorded in France at the beginning of the 2005 European tour.\n\n+ Grupo Um: Reflexões Sobre a Crise do Desejo? (1981). The long awaited second album, carefully remastered, with bonus tracks and extensive booklet. New liner notes by the musicians and unreleased photos, just like the \"Marcha Sobre a Cidade\" reissue (EDITIO/01).\n\n+ Zé Eduardo Nazario: Poema da Gota Serena (EDITIO/22). 2015. This album, recorded in 1982, is the first solo release by the drummer and features the same Brazilian avant jazz music that brought him great reputation while working with the likes of Hermeto Pascoal and Egberto Gismonti. This CD also includes several unreleased bonus tracks recorded between 1977 and 2004, complementing the original album by presenting takes made with Grupo Um, Duo Nazario, Quinteto Zen or his own Grupo Experimental de Percussão de SP.\n\n+ Nenê: Minuano + Bugre. The album \"Minuano\", recorded in Europe in 1985, is Nenê's third solo effort and his masterwork. Including only original compositions, this record showcases an outstanding musician: besides an incredible drummer and pianist, he is also a bold arranger, following the creative paths of masters like Hermeto Pascoal and Egberto Gismonti (whose groups in which he played a major role for a long time). As a bonus, this CD brings the full \"Bugre\" album, his first solo work, recorded in 1982.\n\n+ Nivelo Ornelas: À Tarde. Editio Princeps (EDITIO/13). Nivaldo Ornelas is one of the greatest instrumentists in Brazilian music. In the seventies he was part of Som Imaginário, as well as Hermeto Pascoal's & Egberto Gismonti's bands. In 1982 Nivaldo released his second album, \"À Tarde\", in France. In the following year he took some of those tracks, added some new material and released the Brazilian album, \"Viagem Através De Um Sonho\". This special CD edition includes \"À Tarde\" and the 1983 recordings as bonus tracks.\n\n+ Pé Ante Pé: Imagens do Inconsciente (1980/82). Like Grupo Um, Pé Ante Pé was the greatest exponent of the instrumental / jazz-rock indie scene from São Paulo in the early 80's. Featuring a superb team of musicians (Homero Lotito, Caíto Marcondes, Teco Cardoso, Nico Assumpção), the band released two albums in 1980 and 1982, both very rare today. This package features everything ever recorded by them, including a faithful reproduction of the original art and new liner notes.\n\n+ Percussônica: Hoje. This is the most recent project of the Nazario brothers (Zé Eduardo and Lelo, ex members of Hermeto Pascoal, Grupo Um, Pau Brasil), along with guitar player Felipe Ávila (ex-Sexo dos Anjos, Os Cinco, etc). This CD brings you an outstanding fusion of avant-garde jazz with Brazilian rhythms and contemporary music, mixing acoustic and electronic sounds with bags of energy and improvisation.\n\n+ Ivo Perelman: The Complete Ibeji Sessions. Editio Princeps (Editio 16). 2008. This double CD set contains all the material recorded for the independent label Ibeji: the albums \"Soccer Land\" (1994) and \"Tapeba Songs\" (1996), both recorded in São Paulo during sessions with Brazilian musicians, plus four unreleased bonus tracks. It's a special limited edition (500 copies), celebrating the 20-year career of one of the main names of Brazilian sax. An incredible meeting of Ivo's tenor sax - raw free-jazz energy (with influences from Albert Ayler, Archie Shepp and Peter Brötzmann, among others) - with the exquisite drums and keyboards from brothers Zé Eduardo & Lelo Nazario of Grupo Um fame. It doesn't stop here since also members of the group Pau Brasil are present on the album. Bassist and today much active producer Rodolfo Stroeter and guitarist Paulo Bellinati\n\n+ Projeto B: A Noite. Editio Princeps (EDITIO/12). On their second CD, Projeto B keep developing their own personal style, mixing, in a unexpected way, modern classical influences like Stravinsky and Messiaen with selected elements from avant-garde jazz and rock. Ranging from Frank Zappa and Miles Davis to Bill Frisell & John Zorn, the result is a challenging album, full of sharp compositions, incredible mood variations, lots of improvisations and instrumental virtuosism.\n\n+ Protofonia: A Consciência Do Átomo. Editio Princeps (EDITIO/23). 2nd album by the band!\n\n+ Raiz De Pedra: Trajetória. Editio Princeps (Editio 15). 2008. This CD brings, for the first time, the debut album by Raiz De Pedra, recorded in 1984 and released independently in 1985. Their original progressive jazz-rock, mixing Brazilian (Egberto Gismonti, Hermeto Pascoal, Clube da Esquina) and foreign influences (Jan Garbarek, King Crimson, Passport) drew a lot of attention around the world. This edition also includes 3 live bonus tracks and their first ever recorded composition.\n\nFAR OUT NEWS ... FAR OUT NEWS ... FAR OUT NEWS ... FAR OUT NEWS ... FAR ..\n\nAntonio Adolfo: Destiny. Far Out (FARO121CD). In the late 60's and 70's Antonio was known as the master of funky-Brazilian breaks and beats, and Destiny could be described as a tribute to that period, as it sounds like beamed straight from that era, full to the brim with choppy wah-wah guitars and slick-bossa breaks; Antonio is also joined on the album by his two daughters Carol & Luisa whose crystal-clear, tone-perfect voices float perfectly over Antonio's inspired Brazilian grooves that combine influences from jazz, classic Brazilian 60's pop, Tropicalia, easy-scoring and funk.\n\nVictor Assis Brasil: Esperanto. Far Out Recordings (FARO201CD). Street date: 09-02-18. This release combines the reissue of two albums: Esperanto and \"Toca Antonio Carlos Jobim\", as well as adds two bonus tracks of previously unreleased alternative versions. The band consists of some mercurial greats of Brazilian music: Dom Salvador (piano and electric), Edison Machado (drums), Hélio Delmiro (guitar) and Edson Lobo (bass). Both albums were recorded around 1970 and are reissued as part of the Quartin Records catalogue, named after the famous producer and director behind those releases (as well as many other): Roberto Quartin.\n\nAzymuth: Demos (1973-75) Volumes 1&2. Farout Recordings (FARO210). Street date: 31-05-19. Celebrating its 25th anniversary, Far Out Recordings proudly presents two albums of previously unheard Azymuth demo recordings from 1973-75, with Ariovaldo Contesini on percussion at that time. If two of the tracks did appear respectively on the band's first album and their first album later for Farout (Carnival in 1996), the remaining eight are still unheard, as only a handful of these demos were ever professionally recorded, making this the first opportunity to hear many of these early Azymuth compositions in their raw, original form. On every track the frenetic energy in the studio is palpable, giving the recordings a beautifully personal feel and a sense of the phenomenally creative vision Bertrami, Malheiros and Conti were realising at the time. The demos are also available as two separate LPs (FARO210LP1 and FARO210LP2), pressed on 180 gram vinyl.\n\nAzymuth: Fênix. Far Out Recordings. Street date: December 2016. Since the passing of keyboard maestro Jose Roberto Bertrami in 2012, remaining members - drummer Ivan Conti and bass player Alex Malheiros - have worked tirelessly to keep the spirit of Azymuth alive, and to continue the legacy of Bertrami's genius. Fênix also marks a new era as the Azymuth trio is complete once again, with a very special guest, keyboardist Kiko Continentino. A hugely talented pianist, composer and arranger, Kiko has worked with the likes of Milton Nascimento, Gilberto Gil and Djavan, so the fresh energy and inspiration he has brought to the group is undeniable. The album also features Brazilian percussion legend Robertinho Silva. Welcome to a ten-track journey through the full spectrum of Azymuth's brilliantly coloured expressionist fusion, with all the cosmic energy and masterful musicianship you'd expect from the world's greatest three-man orchestra.\n\nNew Far Out Release!\n\nAzymuth: Brazilian Soul (FARO 091). This is the 6th release for Far Out and the new album sees them borrowing from the musical vocabulary that has always been one of the most exciting narratives of Brazilian music, as well as indulging their enthusiasm for new sounds that still makes them heroes and inspirations to a generation of 21st Century producers. Quite a few guest appearances can be seen as their present to us for this 30th anniversary of a fruitful career; singers Emilio Santiago, Marcio Lott, Fabiola, Sabrina Malheiros or an appearance on flute by Leo Gandelman. Azimuth is still going strong!\n\nAzymuth \"Partido Novo\" was released in april 2002 on Far Out Records. Covering a range of styles, with jazzy interludes and soothing Bossa Novas, this delicious new album from Rio's finest, finds them older, wiser and in reflective mood. The Afro/ House producers Faze Action from the late Nuphonic stable should deliver in 2003 a stunning remix track guaranteed to rock any dance floor around the globe.\n\nBanda Black Rio : Super Nova Samba Funk. Far Out Recordings (FARO159CD). Street date: 04/07/11. BBR defined the Black Rio movement now enjoying a revival headed by Magalhães' incarnation with the passion of soul and funk again linking Rio and New York for a feel-good blast that also takes in hip-hop, samba, pop and bossa. Brazilian icons Seu Jorge, Marcio Local and Elza Soares feature alongside bossa pioneers Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil\n\nIvan 'Mamão' Conti: Poison Fr"
