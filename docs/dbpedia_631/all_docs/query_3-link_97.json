        "text": "Toquinho e Vinicius de Moraes â Toquinho & Vinicius (1977)\n\n.\n\n.\n\nOriginalmente postado no Loronix em 20 de marÃ§o 2008.\n\nComentÃ¡rios originais incluÃ­dos.\n\nHello, good morning! I knew since the first minute of today that my energies were limited to make only one new album to Loronixers. So I decided to make something that should make everybody really pleased. It has been a really long time since the last post featuring Toquinho and Vinicius de Moraes together and I think I could not make better than this one, which is a compilation with 46 minutes running time with a very well selected repertoire.\n\nLetâs see.\n\nThis is Toquinho e Vinicius de Moraes â Toquinho & Vinicius (1977), for RGE, part of RGE label celebration of its 20th Anniversary. I wish everybody a nice weekend, actually, a big weekend that starts tomorrow for Brazilian friends and perhaps friends from other countries, anyway, have a nice big weekend or have a nice weekend, in advance.\n\nTracks include:\n\n01 â SÃ£o Demais os Perigos Desta Vida (Vinicius de Moraes / Toquinho)\n\n02 â A Tonga da Mironga do KabuletÃª (Vinicius de Moraes / Toquinho)\n\n03 â Morena Flor (Vinicius de Moraes / Toquinho)\n\n04 â Cotidiano NÂº 2 (Vinicius de Moraes / Toquinho)\n\n05 â Maria Vai Com as Outras (Vinicius de Moraes / Toquinho)\n\n06 â Meu Pai OxalÃ¡ (Vinicius de Moraes / Toquinho)\n\n07 â Regra TrÃªs (Vinicius de Moraes / Toquinho)\n\n08 â O Velho e a Flor (Luiz Henrique Bacalov / Vinicius de Moraes / Toquinho)\n\n09 â Tarde Em ItapoÃ£ (Vinicius de Moraes / Toquinho)\n\n10 â Como Dizia o Poeta (Vinicius de Moraes / Toquinho)\n\n11 â No Colo da Serra (Vinicius de Moraes / Toquinho)\n\n12 â Menina das Duas TranÃ§as (Vinicius de Moraes / Toquinho)\n\n13 â Paiol de PÃ³lvora (Vinicius de Moraes / Toquinho)\n\n14 â Testamento (Vinicius de Moraes / Toquinho)\n\n1 ComentÃ¡rios originais:\n\nBernardo Ramirez saidâ¦\n\nDe Portugal vai um obrigado pela maravilha musical pre-PÃ¡scoa.\n\nEstes dois sÃ£o divinos.\n\nObrigado\n\nThursday, 20 March, 2008\n\n.\n\nâ§\n\nâ§\n\nToquinho & Vinicius de Moraes â Toquinho / Vinicius & Amigos (1974)\n\n.\n\n.\n\nOriginalmente postado no Loronix em 21 de Dezembro 2008.\n\nComentÃ¡rios originais incluÃ­dos.\n\nHello, good evening! My pick for this Saturday was decided on a different manner. Iâm in a rush here, and I did not took this album for a hearing the way I use to do. But you should agree it is not necessary. This album never had a CD reissue and it unknown to many friends.\n\nThe little I heard was enough to understand this record is such like a friendâs meeting, very relaxed session.

Yesterday was one of the days that I like most at Loronix, all releases were great and different to each other. I did not expect so many people amazed with Quarteto em Cy and Formula 7, mainly Formula 7, a repost. Anyway, as people feedback at comment section, Formula 7 had the participation of renowned musicians that still active today. Let's start the day very strong with a long time request by many Loronixers.\n\nThis is Cynara e Cybele - Cynara e Cybele (1968), for Columbia. This was requested since Loronix beginning, probably as the solo album of Cynara and Cybele from Quarteto em Cy and also for the participation of Dory Caymmi as arranger of all tracks, actually, there is an exception, Luiz EÃ§a is in charge of track 07 arrangements, Januaria.

Thx a lot for this one, Zeca!\n\nI would call this album Quarteto em Cy's \"stripped to the bone\".

Iâm happy I donât need to buy a Mac. Iâm old for such change. I would like to inform that my computer nightmare has gone to a term today.\n\nThanks a lot to everybody who wrote me with suggestions, tips and tricks. It seems that everybody is a computer specialist today.\n\nThanks a lot Matt from the essential Beta Particle for making available resources to a virtual conference call, not needed because Jason guided this computer illiterate parrot to a utility that fixed the problem as magic.\n\nAnyway, now I can focus on something Iâm doing that has a strong influence to this post. Iâm trying to write an article to approach on a structured manner a fascinating aspect of Brazilian instrumental music in the 60âs, which is the use of nicknames by renowned artists on records, such like Ed Lincoln recording as Don Pablo de Havana, the last released provided by Jose Ignacio Neto. It is incredible the number of musicians who made such thing. I think the most popular and relevant case is Bob Fleming, a fictional musician created by Nilo Sergioâs Musidisc label that had two artists playing the Bob Fleming role, the legendary Moacyr Silva and Zito Righi.\n\nLetâs see:\n\nThis is Bob Fleming â Bob Fleming Interpreta Boleros Volume 3 (1965), for Masterpiece Masters, a Musidisc label. I never found official information on which musician is behind each Bob Fleming release, but this one seems to be a Moacyr Silva session, delivering renditions of Bolero standards with his sax tenor. This cover is scaring at a first sight, but soon you will get used with the naked ladies around the sax.\n\nTracks include:\n\n01 â Charade (H. Mancini) Just For Tonight (J. Mercer / H. Carmichael)\n\n02 â Sin Motivo (Gabriel Ruiz) Ay de Mi (O. FarrÃ©s)\n\n03 â Amor (Gabriel Ruiz / R. L. Mendes) Abrazame Asi (M. Clavel)\n\n04 â Accarezzame (Calvi / Nisa) Arrivederci (U.

Testa / Mogol) Io Che Amo Solo Te (Sergio Endrigo)\n\n12 â Nessuno Al Mondo (R. Gioia) Al Di LÃ¡ (Mogol / Donida)\n\nNa realidade, este parece ser mais um disco interpretado por Zito Righi, e nÃ£o Moacyr Silva (estÃ¡ incluÃ­do na discografia do Zito Righi, abaixo).\n\nMartoni: Estas informaÃ§Ãµes foram obtidos diretos com o filho do Zito Righi aqui no RF&E, vejam Zito Righi e Sua Orquestra - Sax de Ouro (1964).\n\nQuanto ao artigo que estava sendo escrito pelo Zeca, ele de fato escreveu, com o tÃ­tulo âO Jogo dos PseudÃ´nimosâ. Pode ser acessado no MÃºsicos do Brasil.\n\n2 ComentÃ¡rios originais:\n\nMilan FilipoviÄ on Sunday, 19 October, 2008\n\nObrigado.\n\nJose Ignacio Neto on Wednesday, 22 October, 2008\n\nHello Zeca, greetings from China!\n\nSo I can see you have taken up the theme of pseudonimous recordings after the Don Pablo sessionsâ¦certainly a fun game.\n\nOne of the comments suggested that Nilo Sergio was behind Os Romanticos de Cuba and that is correct, confirmed to me by Durval Ferreira (himself user of psuedonyms such as âGatussâ and âDevelâ!) who also told me that Moacyr Silva was Bob Fleming. Now whether Musidisc âownedâ the name Bob Fleming or whether Moacyr was the only Bob Fleming is difficult to say!\n\nAbracos,\n\nJIN\n\n.\n\n.\n\nâ§\n\nDick Farney & Booker Pittman â Jam Session das Folhas (1961)\n\n.\n\n.\n\nOriginalmente postado no Loronix em 01 de agosto 2006.\n\nComentÃ¡rios originais incluÃ­dos.\n\nPerhaps today is the day zecalouro is posting to Loronixers his mega-rare releases. Jam Session das Folhas â Dick Farney e Booker Pittman (1961) is very rare vinyl collectors item.\n\nThis LP was recorded live in the end of 1960 at the auditorium of a Brazilian newspaper, Folha de Sao Paulo. As zecalouro told before, Dick Farney was an outstanding singer and an awesome pianist who contributed decisively to the renovation of Brazilian popular music, incorporating jazz harmonies and style.\n\nDick was at the piano on all tracks, accompanied by Heraldo do Monte (guitar), Luiz Chaves (bass), Paulinho (drums) among others. Booker plays sax and sings on some tracks\n\nMartoni:\n\nInteresting in the comments is: when Daniella Thompson asked about the song âCheeseâ , âEmanuel wrote âThe song âCheeseâ Was Composed By Pittman in Tribute to Dudu (the Banjo and guitar Player) because he used to eat a lot of Cheese.\n\nDudu was considered one of the best traditional jazz musicians and PittmanÂ´s closest musician/friend.

Thereafter Pittman and a group of Dixieland wanabees take over and I must say I was not impressed. They take a comic attitude to almost everything and I did not think it worked very well. Pittman must think he is emulating the great Sidney Bechet on soprano but does not come close.\n\nGreat for tracks 1-4 and a downer for the rest.\n\nyvesfrancois on Wednesday, 18 July, 2007\n\nI have the album,I love the Booker Pittman tracks (one of my favorite sopranos along Bechet, Emmett Matthews and the still active 94 years old Franz Jackson) it has an unusual guitarist and a fine trumpeter (and love Bookerâs vocals as well). I find it funny that my view on this LP is the exact opposite of âjazzmanâ posted. I bought the LP for Pittman and was very happy about Pittmanâs combo, but found the âcoctailâ jazz of Farneyâs combo mundane for my taste (though very professional), viva la difference, I guess Yves Francois\n\nemanuel, 17 August, 2011\n\nHi Daniella, The song âCheeseâ Was Composed By Pittman in Tribute to Dudu (the Banjo and guitar Player) because he used to eat a lot of Cheese.\n\nDudu was considered one of the best traditional jazz musicians and PittmanÂ´s closest musician/friend.\n\nNowadays Dudu has a band with his sons, the Banda PAPADÃ.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nâ§\n\nVarios Artistas â 2Âº Concerto de Jazz De Camera no Teatro Municipal (1960)\n\n.\n\nOriginalmente postado no Loronix em 25 de outubro 2007.\n\nComentÃ¡rios originais incluÃ­dos.\n\nHere we go on an album that does not need to be introduced.

Iâm dizzy!\n\nThis concert was recorded live at Teatro Municipal in Rio de Janeiro for an estimated audience of 2,500 privileged friends.

Depois de ouvi-la pela primeira vez, aos 14 anos de idade, todas as demais orquestras passaram para um plano secundÃ¡rio na minha preferÃªncia. Aquela sonoridade incrÃ­vel, moderna, as dissonÃ¢ncias, as tensÃµes, os arranjos completamente diferentes dos padrÃµes vigentes, mudaram a minha vida. (AliÃ¡s, nÃ£o sÃ³ a minha, mas de gente muito importante, como JOÃO DONATO, pra citar apenas um dos maiores \"kentomanÃ­acos\").\n\nCB\n\nSTAN KENTON\n\nStanley Newcomb Kenton (December 15, 1911 â August 25, 1979) was a pianist who led a highly innovative, influential, and often controversial American jazz orchestra. Stan Kenton was born in Wichita, Kansas, and raised first in Colorado and then in California. He learned piano as a child, and while still a teenager toured with various bands. In June 1941 he formed his own band, which developed into one of the best-known West Coast ensembles of the Forties. Kenton played in the 1930's in the dance bands of Vido Musso and Gus Arnheim, but his natural inclination was as a band leader. As a competent pianist, influenced by Earl Hines, Kenton was much more important in the early days as an arranger and inspiration for his loyal sidemen. Its soloists during the war years included Art Pepper, briefly Stan Getz, altoist Boots Mussulli, and singer Anita O'Day. By 1945 the band had evolved quite a bit.\n\nPete Rugolo became the chief arranger (extending Kenton's ideas), Bob Cooper and Vido Musso offered very different tenor styles, and June Christy was Kenton's new singer; her hits (including \"Tampico\" and \"Across the Alley From the Alamo\") made it possible for Kenton to finance his more ambitious projects. A popular recording of \"Laura\" was made, the theme song from the film Laura (starring actress Gene Tierney), and featured the voices of the band. Calling his music \"progressive jazz,\" Kenton sought to lead a concert orchestra as opposed to a dance band at a time when most big bands were starting to break up. In 1949 Kenton took a year off. In 1950 he put together his most advanced band, the 39-piece Innovations in Modern Music Orchestra that included 16 strings, a woodwind section, and two French horns. Its music ranged from the unique and very dense modern classical charts of Bob Graettinger to works that somehow swung despite the weight. Such major players as Maynard Ferguson (whose high-note acrobatics set new standards), Shorty Rogers, Milt Bernhart, John Graas, Art Pepper, Bud Shank, Bob Cooper, Laurindo Almeida, Shelly Manne, and June Christy were part of this remarkable project, but from a commercial standpoint, it was really impossible. Kenton managed two tours during 1950-1951 but soon reverted to his usual 19-piece lineup.\n\nThen quite unexpectedly, Kenton went through a swinging period. The charts of such arrangers as Shorty Rogers, Gerry Mulligan, Lennie Niehaus, Marty Paich, Johnny Richards, and particularly Bill Holman and Bill Russo began to dominate the repertoire. Such talented players (in addition to the ones already named) as Lee Konitz, Conte Candoli, Sal Salvador, Stan Levey, Frank Rosolino, Richie Kamuca, Zoot Sims, Sam Noto, Bill Perkins, Charlie Mariano, Mel Lewis, Pete Candoli, Lucky Thompson, Carl Fontana, Pepper Adams, and Jack Sheldon made strong contributions. The music was never predictable and could get quite bombastic, but it managed to swing while still keeping the Kenton sound.\n\nKenton's last successful experiment was his mellophonium band of 1960-1963. Despite the difficulties in keeping the four mellophoniums (Gene Roland, Joe Burnett, Bill Horan and Tom Wirtel et al. which formed their own separate section) in tune, this particular Kenton orchestra had its exciting moments.\n\nKenton was a salient figure on the American musical scene and made an indelible mark on the arranged type of big band jazz. Kenton's music evolved with the times throughout the 1960s and 70s. He promoted jazz and jazz improvisation through his service as an educator. The \"Kenton Style\" continues to permeate big bands at the high school and collegiate level, and the framework he designed for the \"jazz clinic\" is still widely in use today. His music has experienced a resurgence in interest, with later critical \"rediscovery\" of his music and many reissues of his recordings. Kenton continued leading and touring with his big band up to his final performance in August, 1979, a week before he suffered a stroke while on tour in Reading, PA. Kenton did not recover and passed away on August 25, 1979.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia, edited by CB)\n\n---------\n\nALBUM REVIEW\n\nThis LP features the Stan Kenton Orchestra (during the period when it had a mellophonium section) performing some of its familiar standards and a few newer songs with a light Brazilian rhythm provided by percussionists Frank Guerrero and Milt Holland (Larry Bunker fills in for Holland on three songs). Although one might consider this project to be an example of Kenton jumping on the bandwagon (since the bossa nova fad was at its peak at the time), the music is quite enjoyable. Kenton on piano is the main soloist throughout, with Conte Candoli having a couple solos on trumpet and high-note trumpeter Bud Brisbois getting a few spots. Kenton's \"Brasilia\" is a charming piece deserving to be revived. Otherwise, it is interesting to hear such songs as \"Interlude,\"\"Concerto to End All Concertos,\"\"Eager Beaver,\" and even \"Artistry in Rhythm\" in this setting.\n\n(By Scott Yanow)\n\n-----------\n\nMINHA OPINIÃO - este Ã¡lbum foi gravado na leva da \"bossa-nova-craze\" nos USA, quando TODO MUNDO gravou um Ã¡lbum com a novidade. Como sempre, diferente em tudo, Kenton nÃ£o se abasteceu dos standards da bossa, preferindo gravar suas prÃ³prias, personalÃ­ssimas e instigantes composiÃ§Ãµes. Uma delas, a belÃ­ssima OPUS IN CHARTREUSE, segundo as mÃ¡s lÃ­nguas, inspirou a futura composiÃ§Ã£o de Roberto Menescal e Chico Buarque, \"Bye, bye Brasil\". (Pessoalmente, acho essa afirmativa uma\n\nmaldade, apesar da grande semelhanÃ§a das frases iniciais). As formaÃ§Ãµes orquestrais de Kenton eram uma verdadeira academia, por onde passaram os maiores mÃºsicos e arranjadores do \"west-coast-jazz\". Os arranjos como sempre, brilhantes; o Ãºnico senÃ£o Ã© o canhestro ritmo de bossa-nova, que os americanos levaram anos para assimilar e que transformava tudo em rumba...Apesar disso: BELEZA PURA!\n\n(*)Essa coisa de coicidÃªncias musicais, por culpa do insconsciente , Ã© comum. Certa vez eu \"compus\" uma mÃºsica linda. Corri prÃ¡ mostrar pro Raymundo Bittencourt que ouviu atenciosamente e, no final, mandou: \"Ficou bonito esse arranjo de SERENADE IN BLUE.\" Acontece...\n\nCarlos Braga\n\n---------\n\nStan Kenton: Artistry in Bossa Nova\n\nRelease Date: Apr 17, 1963\n\nLabel: Creative World\n\nTracks:\n\n01 Artistry in Rhythm\n\n02 Opus in Chartreuse\n\n03 Interlude\n\n04 Kentonova\n\n05 Eager Beaver\n\n06 Concerto\n\n07 Brasilia\n\n08 Painted Rhythm\n\n09 Opus in Pastels\n\n10 Jump for Joe\n\n11 Loco-Nova\n\n12 Artistry in Bossa Nova\n\n.\n\n.\n\nâ§\n\nâ§\n\nBarney Kessel Plus Big Band - Bossa Nova (1961)\n\n.\n\n.\n\nIsto Ã© Barney Kessel Plus Big Band - Bossa Nova (1961) da gravadora Reprise Records, R9-6049.\n\nRuy Castro conta no seu livro Chega de Saudades que o âMenescal passava horas escutando o disco Julie is Here Name.

Um Show de Mattar is a transitional album between the Samba Jazz works from the 60's and the piano virtuoso years, it is easy to identify both phases throughout the tracks. Mauricio Einhorn delivers a solid harmonica playing, especially on track 02 - Conversa de Botequim.\n\nTracks include:\n\n01 - Darling Lili (J.

Orquestra Armorial de Camara was nested inside Movimento Armorial, created at Northeast region by Ariano Suassuna and Cussy de Almeida, which is the leader of Orquestra Armorial.\n\nThe movement was created with the orchestra in 1970 and Continental recorded the first album in 1975. Orquestra Armorial is acclaimed worldwide and it is very connected with the Northeast culture and something really unique, different from everything that you heard before at Loronix. Letâs see.\n\nThis is Orquestra Armorial de Camera â Gaviao (1976), for Continental, the third out of four albums released in a short period of five years, from 1975 to 1979. Iâm really excited with this album and I could not make a satisfactory research on the orchestra and Cussy de Almeida. This should not be a major concern since Loronixers are invited to append additional information at comments section.\n\nTracks include:\n\nPersonnel\n\nRicardo Bussi Lasa, Birgitta fassi Fihri, Elias Benjamin Wolkoff, Reinaldo Couto, Chantal Bargas Maurer, Cristina Bussi Lasa, Samuel Gegna\n\n(violins)\n\nMatthias Maurer, Allen Frank Musick\n\n(violas)\n\nThomas Maurer, Maria do Socorro Monteiro Johnson\n\n(cellos)\n\nSilvio Araujo Coelho\n\n(bass)\n\nJose Tavares do Amorim, Ivanildo Maciel da Silveira\n\n(flutes)\n\nJose Xavier da Silva, Antonio Revoredo, Geraldo Fernandes Leite, Cussy de Almeida\n\n(violin, direction)\n\nSergio Assad\n\n(violao)\n\nTrack List\n\n01 - GaviÃ£o (Cussy de Almeida) â Cenas I e II vÃ´o e a caÃ§a\n\n02 - Zabumba de Alegria (Jarbas Maciel)\n\n03 - Dueto CaracterÃ­stico (No Estilo Nordestino) (Guerra Peixe) Allegro Moderato Andantino Allegro comodo\n\n04 - Romance de Cavalhada (Cussy de Almeida)\n\n05 - Aboio Esporiado (JosÃ© Tavares de Amorim)\n\n06 - Santa Cruz do Capibaribe (Jarbas Maciel)\n\n07 - Cantando Viola (JosÃ© Tavares de Amorim)\n\n08 - CheganÃ§a (Benny Wolkoff)\n\n3 ComentÃ¡rios originais:\n\nfmb saidâ¦AlÃ´, me surpreende que vocÃª nÃ£o conheÃ§a o Quinteto Armorial.

I have been looking for this album in a digital format for over twenty years. I received this album along with two other Orquestra Armorial de Camera albums as part of a SÃ£o Paulo Rotary Club anniversary package when I was an exchange student.

Unfortunately, when you have a collector such like Caetano Rodrigues on your side, it is silly to think you know everything. Caetano has a strange relationship with his collection, he loves his albums, keeping everything organized by sections in his place, which is such like a record store of our dreams, but he thinks that everybody has the music he only has. I got amazed with this album, which I did not have idea that exists, and Caetano got amazed to know that I donât have it.\n\nYou will understand what Iâm saying with the last post tonight, which will be one of the greatest albums available at Loronix, and in spite of Caetano thinks that everybody has it, Iâm quite sure that nobody had the chance to know. Such like this one.\n\nThis is Conjunto de Jazz Bossa Nova â Brasil Bossa Nova (1963), for RCA Victor, featuring a quintet of bass, flute, violao, drums, sax and trombone. Personnel listing is partially identified and Caetano should be pleased if our community identifies the remaining musicians.\n\nBrasil Bossa Nova is a great Samba Jazz session, so far one of the greatest releases in the style at Loronix.

I was checking the last five days and without knowing all first posts made were from obscure artists and the hard to find albums.\n\nThis time I decided to make a test drive with some Loronixers that are also vinyl collectors and none of the friends had seen this group and this album before. Let's keep the pace and show Loronixers another Marcelo \"Sambasonics\" Munhoz contribution that probably you never heard about.\n\nThis is Samba 5 - Moderninho (1970), for Tropicana. Little is known about Samba 5, probably a quintet that released only this LP for the label Tropicana. Personnel is also unknown and it seems to be recorded by known musicians, the drummer plays very nice and the record was mixed to highlight his work. Thanks for another one, Marcelo.\n\nMartoni (12-04-2014): graÃ§as a cantora Marcia Calmon temos agora mais detales sobre Samba 5.\n\nMarcia Calmon:\n\nOi, tenho aqui do meu lado o responsÃ¡vel pelos arranjos e sax do disco \"Samba 5 - Moderninho\".

There is a great excitement around a vinyl fair in Sao Paulo scheduled for tomorrow. I will spread my wings and fly away there just to check with Caetano what is new. Actually, we will really check what is old, what is new does not apply to this business. It will be amazing to meet Loronixers, I will be with Caetano, so it will be easy to realize who is zeca, otherwise, look for a green guy, naked, 15cm tall and barefoot with four fingers, two in the front and two in the back. That's zeca. I'm tired today and I need to start easy and great.\n\nThis is Varios Artistas - Hits da Bossa Nova - Nr. 3 (1964), for Philips. We had already a very successful Hits da Bossa Nova Philips compilation at Loronix, Number 1 was very well received by Loronixers. Thanks Cesar Saldanha for sending Nr. 3, featuring Jorge Ben, Tamba Trio, Os Cariocas, Bossa Rio and Sergio Mendes, Luiz Henrique and Meirelles e Os Copa 5.\n\nTracks include:\n\n01 - Pula BaÃº with Jorge Ben \"Jorge Benjor\"\n\n02 - Sonho de Maria with Tamba Trio\n\n03 - Telefone with Os Cariocas\n\n04 - NanÃ£ with Bossa Rio / Sergio Mendes\n\n05 - Vou Andar Por AÃ­ with Luiz Henrique\n\n06 - Vamos Embora (UÃ¡u) with Jorge Ben \"Jorge Benjor\"\n\n07 - Tristeza de NÃ³s Dois with Tamba Trio\n\n08 - Chove Chuva with Jorge Ben \"Jorge Benjor\"\n\n09 - Noa Noa with Bossa Rio / Sergio Mendes\n\n10 - Toc-toc with Luis Henrique\n\n11 - Tem DÃ³ with Os Cariocas\n\n12 - Nordeste with Meirelles / Os Copa 5\n\n0 Reply to \"Varios Artistas - Hits da Bossa Nova Nr. 3 (1964)\"\n\n.\n\n.\n\nâ§\n\nVarios Artistas - Hits da Bossa Nova (nÂ° 1) (1963)\n\n.\n\n.\n\nOriginalmente postado no Loronix em 10 de abril 2007.\n\nComentÃ¡rios originais incluÃ­dos.\n\nThis is the first out of five records released by Philips between 1963 and 1964 with the \"hits\" from the artists of the Philips cast. What a cast! Hits da Bossa Nova is probably one of the best compilations I have ever seen. In spite of the nice repertoire selection, Hits da Bossa Nova features tracks never released on regular recordings, providing a guaranteed entertainment for starters and experienced collectors.\n\nIf you are new to Bossa Nova, you should take it.\n\nThis is Hits da Bossa Nova (1963), for Philips, featuring Tamba Trio, Sylvia Telles, Sonia Delfino, Carlos Lyra, Baden Powell, Lucio Alves and Sergio Mendes.\n\nYou cannot go wrong with such selection.\n\nTracks include:\n\nPerformers\n\nTamba Trio\n\nSylvia Telles\n\nSonia Delfino\n\nCarlos Lyra\n\nBaden Powell\n\nLucio Alves\n\nSergio Mendes\n\nTrack List:\n\n01 - Samba de Uma Nota SÃ³ â SYLVIA TELLES\n\n02 - Desafinado â TAMBA TRIO\n\n03 - MeditaÃ§Ã£o â SONIA DELFINO\n\n04 - Outra Vez â SERGIO MENDES\n\n05 - Quem Quiser Encontrar o Amor â CARLOS LYRA (never released)\n\n06 - Do Jeito Que a Gente Quer â BADEN POWELL\n\n07 - Samba Triste â LUCIO ALVES\n\n08 - NÃ³s e o Mar â TAMBA TRIO\n\n09 - O Amor e a Rosa â LUCIO ALVES\n\n10 - Improviso Em Bossa Nova â BADEN POWELL\n\n11 - Corcovado â SILVINHA TELLES\n\n12 - Tristeza de NÃ³s Dois â SERGIO MENDES\n\n13 - O Barquinho â SONIA DELFINO\n\n14 - Chora Tua Tristeza â CARLOS LYRA\n\n5 Reply to \"Varios Artistas - Hits da Bossa Nova (1963)\"\n\nAmblito on Tuesday, 10 April, 2007\n\nGreat stuff! Nice one! :)\n\nI have volume 2 somewhere if you'd like a copy ripping.\n\nzecalouro on Tuesday, 10 April, 2007\n\nAmblito,\n\nIf you can make it on 320Kb with cover scans I will be pleased, as well Loronixers.\n\nThanks.\n\nzeca\n\nfrank-oliver on Wednesday, 11 April, 2007\n\nHi Zeca,\n\nI checked all the tracks on this record. All but two came from well kown Philips LP`s by these artists (Lyra`s \"Quem quiser encontrar o amor\" comes from his \"Depois do Carnaval\" LP). \"Desafinado\" by Tamba Trio comes not from one of their early LP`s, this must be a track from a single. \"O Barquinho\" by Sonia Delfino is not on her Philips album \"Canta para a Mocidade\", perhaps also a single- track.\n\nHits da Bossa Nova Vol.2 has two tracks by Luiz Henrique which are not from his Philips LP but from an early EP-Single. Unfortunaly my copy of this Lp is very scratchy. I hope you will get it with better quality.\n\nzecalouro on Wednesday, 11 April, 2007\n\nThanks Frank-oliver,\n\nI really thought this Lyra track was never issued on any media.\n\nDon't be afraid about this copy, I found it on a very good condition.\n\nCheers, zeca\n\namblito on Wednesday, 11 April, 2007\n\nI'm recording Hits da Bossa Nova 2 at the moment - the vinyl looks to be in excellent condition, sadly when I've played it there are a few clicks and pops.\n\nI'll send it your way as soon as possible Zeca but I fear the clicks might be a bit too much.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nâ§"
