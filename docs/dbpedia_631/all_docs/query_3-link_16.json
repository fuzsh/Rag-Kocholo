        "text": "See Winners\n\nThe Latin Grammys took a page from their parent’s history book Wednesday night at the Shrine Auditorium, rewarding a single performer early and often.\n\nAs Norah Jones did most recently, Alejandro Sanz stormed through the major categories, taking home awards for album of the year, record of the year and best male pop vocal album for his record “No Es Lo Mismo” and song of the year (songwriter for the title track).\n\nEngineer/mixer Mick Guzauski was three for three, walking away with album, record and engineered album of the year, also for “No Es Lo Mismo.”\n\nMaria Rita, nommed for six, won two kudos for best new artist and MPB (Musica Popular Brasileira) album of the year for her debut Brazilian record, “Maria Rita.” Songwriter Milton Nascimento nabbed Brazilian song (Portuguese language) kudos for Rita’s track “A Festa.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“I had no expectations coming in today,” said Maria Rita. “For a Brazilian to be nominated (so many times) in the general category, it’s really very good. It’s great for Brazilian music and musicians in general.”\n\nIt was a disappointing evening for producer Tom Capone, who had been nominated in six categories but walked away empty-handed. Instead, producer of the year went to Javier Limon.\n\nCelia Cruz won best salsa album for “Regalo Del Alma” posthumously; the Cuban singer died of cancer in July 2003.\n\nHosting the kudofest for the second consecutive year, George Lopez arrived on horseback, joking as he rode in, “(This is) the way we have to get around in Los Angeles since Gov. Schwarzenegger took away our driver’s licenses.”\n\nLopez continued the ribbing, commenting that “people like Schwarzenegger because he makes George Bush seem like he’s Hooked on Phonics.”\n\nIn an attempt to attract younger — and Anglo — auds the two-hour CBS broadcast featured consistent Latino-Anglo pairing of both performers and presenters. Jessica Simpson, just back from the MTV Video Music Awards in Miami, opened the show with a Spanish-English duet, performed with pop star David Bisbal. While Incubus shared the stage with Cafe Tecuba, presenters included couple of the moment Lindsay Lohan and Wilmer Valderrama, as well as Amber Tamblyn and Jason Ritter.\n\nBut it was Carlos Santana’s performance of “La Bamba” and “I Don’t Wanna Lose Your Love” with Los Lonely Boys that brought the crowd to their feet. Santana, who was named 2004 Person of the Year by the Acad on Monday night, had little to say after the performance. Introducing the Los Lonely Boys as “the future of music,” he added, “They’re so good they don’t even know how to lip-sync.”\n\nUltimately, only eight of the 43 award categories were unveiled on the air, as the 35 additional awards were announced just prior to showtime. Telecast was blipped to 105 countries. Eligibility period was for recordings shipped between April 1, 2003, and March 31, 2004.\n\nAwards were presented by the Latin Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences on Wednesday night at the Shrine Auditorium.\n\nAnd the winners are…\n\n5th Annual Latin Grammy Awards.
