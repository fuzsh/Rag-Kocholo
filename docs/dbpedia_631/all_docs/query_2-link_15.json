        "text": "These three musical legends, close friends since their young days in Rio, all turn 80 within a few months. Its been said that Jobim, Gilberto, Bonfa, Powell, Donato, Lyra, Alf, and Menescal represented Bossa Nova's first generation. And composers like Valle. Lobo, and Caymmi represented Bossa's second generation. This is partly true as these three had elements of Bossa in their music. But I believe that their music more accurately represents the first generation of Brazilian MPB, which encompasses a variety of Brazilian musical styles. The cliche of \"we will never see the likes of them again,\" in their case is absolutely true. I will post three of my favorite renditions of their music.\n\nOf all the songs written by these composers that I have heard only one of them is what I consider weak. That is Pra Dizer Adeus.\n\nAll the others that I have heard have been great."
