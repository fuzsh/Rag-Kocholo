        "text": "Brazil has had a remarkable history of miscegenation, which has led the Brazilian people to an unceasing search for a common cultural and musical identity. This process thrives in cultural experiences and social assimilation, reinforcing the notion that regional diversity still is the process where music and people have constructed a significant intersection of musical practices and ideologies. Bossa nova in the mid-late 1950s and early 1960s came to express and answer some of these new ideological questions, broke away from previous musical modules, and formulated contemporary aesthetics. This research paper presents the musical characteristics that entitled bossa nova to a sophisticated and distinguished musical style. It further explores new aesthetics in Brazil and how the voice and the guitar formulated a new guitar groove or \"batida diferente\" (outstanding accompaniment) that would transform Brazilian music and pave the ground for positioning bossa nova in the global community. As Irna Priore has discussed in her article \"Authenticity and Performance Practice: Bossa nova and João Gilberto\" of 2008, \"music cannot be studied in a vacuum, and it is a cultural and human product.\" Within this context, bossa nova is a crucial marker and a new symbol for the middle class, embracing a historical momentum of modernization and vision for the future, transforming a cosmopolitan perspective into conceptual applications and usage of modern aesthetics in Brazilian music.\n\nIf bossa nova represented a crucial stage in the relationship between the Brazilian sound world and the United States, Desafinado was the spark that ignited the genre’s explosion in the North American continent. In 1962 Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd recorded a first jazz version which certainly went down well in the States, but did little for Tom Jobim and João Gilberto. Just a year later the two Brazilians recorded a new version of Desafinado, with Stan Getz but taking a rigorous approach to recomposition, performance and sound. This investigation goes to the heart of the process of US musicians’ appropriation and re-elaboration of a song from a very different cultural, linguistic and musical context. We aim to answer significant questions: what is the reason for Desafinado’s success? Which musical parameters did the US musicians focus on? Is it still possible to speak of ‘Bossa Nova’ in the North American versions? We start from a detailed poetical and musical analysis of the first recording (João Gilberto, 1959). Using the data this provides, we go on to consider the symbiosis between the verbal and musical dimensions - covering the compositional, performance and production features of the latter - in order to propose a semantic interpretation. The analysis of the expressive elements feeds into a comparison with the recordings previously mentioned so as to give an account of the significant early history of Desafinado.\n\nThis article points out some elements that can help to understand the difficulty of analyzing popular music in Brazil with the forms of analysis commonly used by classical aesthetics and philosophy of music. In addition, it indicates some possible paths for the development of a critique of national musical material. To this end, this article retrieves some fundamental questions about the history of popular music in Brazil: its triple origin (African, European and Amerindian), the influence of capitalism in the first decades of the twentieth century, the concept of ‘popular’, its connection with early lyric poetry and its multiple forms of expression.

The same is true of esoteric ideas, which have found fertile ground in Brazil, particularly in the second half of the 20th century. In this paper I will be taking two quite famous examples of Brazilian musicians dealing with esoteric themes and, at least in the case of Seixas,personally involved in Esoteric practice. The first of these is Jorge Ben Jor, who is most famous outside of Brazil, as the creator of \"Mas que Nada\" a song covered by the Black Eyed Peas and also as the composer of the song \"Taj Mahal\" which was the basis for Rod Stewart's \"Do You think I'm Sexy\". However, in the early to mid 70s the esoteric slant of his music starts to be noticeable with albums entitled \"Tábua de Esmeralda\" (Emerald Tablet) where the title song consists of the word of that hermetic text, or songs with the title \"Os Alquimistas Estão Chegando\" (The Alchemists are Coming). While Jorge Ben was a more of a theoretical hermeticist, Raul Seixas was much more overtly not only an esotericist but particularly a Thelemite, known in Brazil as the \"Father of Brazilian Rock\" and famous enough to have a parade in his honor every year in downtown São Paulo, joined Marcelo Motta's OTO with his co-songwriter and now major bestselling author Paulo Coelho, taking into hands the mission of creating a new society which he entitled \"Sociedade Alternativa\" (Alternative Society) based on the ideals in Crowley's Liber OZ, therefore many of his songs are concerned with this subject, to the point of having a fully sung version of Liber OZ in Portuguese in one of his albums. What is interesting to explore here, but which there is no space to go into in this abstract, is how these ideas relate to the socio-political situation in Brazil in the 70s, under a military dictatorship, both Seixas' and Jorge Ben's music represent ideals of freedom and escapism under the guise of esoteric themes."
