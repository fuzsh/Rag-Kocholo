Throughout his storied career, Dori Caymmi has been a producer and arranger for big artists during the 1960’s such as Edu Lobo, Eumir Deodato, and Nara Leão and as a composer with Nelson Motta.

On his Wikipedia page, it mentioned that he was a guitarist and arranger for Paul Winter’s band. He also went on tour to get his first taste of playing in the U.S.

It went on to say:

“He arranged albums by Caetano Veloso, Gal Costa, and Gilberto Gil. He was involved with musicians associated with the tropicalia movement of the late 1960s but did not record in this style because he disliked pop music. During the 1970s and ’80s, he composed TV and movie soundtracks, including Crônica da Casa Assassinada (1971), which wrote with Antonio Carlos Jobim. In 1989, he moved to Los Angeles, California.”

He also was nominated for numerous Latin Grammy Awards, most notably on his 2013 album Caymmi, with siblings Nana Caymmi and Danilo, was nominated for the 2014 Latin Grammy Award for Best MPB Album but lost to a former subject of this blog Marisa Monte with her album Verdade, Uma Ilusão.

The album review here was released on April 12 on streaming services. It has a bit of a mariachi vibe, considering this blog was published on May 5–Cinco de Mayo (and for some this day is also Greek Easter, so happy times indeed for those who celebrate considering the fragile state of our world.)

Each song has a nice ebb and flow to it, and is great for being in a very calm state. I especially recommend if you have had a nervous, anxious time in whatever is going on in your life and while your heartbeat hopefully goes down to mostly normal levels, the duet sounds of MP84, Joyce Moreno, Renato Braz, and Monica Salmaso sprinkled throughout should pique your curiosity after a few listens. It is another excellent addition to any jazz library, along with his other work spanning over six decades dating back to 1960.

Even better, this album clocks in at 34 minutes, 28 seconds–or 7 minutes and 11 seconds more than Jessica Pratt’s soothing, suave indie pop album Here In The Pitch, which was released this past Friday (May 3.)

Something huge happened in Rio on Saturday night

Pop star extraordinaire in Madonna played her biggest show in wrapping up her extensive “Celebration” world tour

The Reuters news agency reported on Saturday that this free concert had “The sand and oceanfront boulevard around Rio de Janeiro’s famed (Copacabana) beach were filled for several blocks by a crowd the city estimated at 1.6 million (people.)

Many had been there for hours or even days to get a good spot, while richer fans anchored in dozens of boats near the beach and onlookers crowded beachfront apartments.”

Temperatures ranged in the evening from the upper 20’s to around 30 Celsius/81 to 86 Farenheit–similar temperature range you would find at Chicago’s world famous Lollapalooza each August.

NME, the popular indie music website in Great Britain had an excellent account of the festivities–which included a bunch of X/Tweets and some awesome YouTube videos of Madonna performing a few of her biggest hits during the 1980’s:
