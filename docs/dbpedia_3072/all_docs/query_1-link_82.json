        "text": "Samar Abdel-Rahman\n\nLabour, Female Stardom, and Ethical Dilemmas in the Wake of Islamic Conservatism in Egyptian Cinema\n\nEgyptian female stars have been an integral part of the industry’s success since its inception. But by the 1980s and 1990s, the new wave of Islamic conservatism caused an upheaval with repercussions on Egyptian society and culture. The veiling phenomena began to take place throughout the country and the female body became a site for cultural struggle and a direct contention between Western capitalism and traditionalism (Abu Odeh, 1993). These contested ideological tensions were also translated into cultural domains, including cinema. The film industry faced pressure from Islamist groups, leading many female stars to adopt the veil and withdraw from the public eye in acts of repentance. While others actively became Islamic preachers, using their fame and platform to preach the conservative Islamic ideal that they have now embraced. Most notably, Shams al-Baurdi, a 1970s sex symbol became one of the first female stars to retire in 1982 and subsequently embraced an Islamic preaching role, denouncing her previous career and distancing herself from her films, even attempted to buy the copyrights of the film and to get it banned.\n\nThis paper aims to analyze the phenomenon of female stars in crisis, contextualizing their prominence against the backdrop of the evolving new conservatively religiously moral landscape that became the dominant ideology. More importantly, it focuses on ethical questions surrounding stardom and labour. How do we ethically deal with films featuring stars who have distanced themselves from their previous roles, expressing a desire for their work to be forgotten after this transformation?\n\nBio:\n\nSamar Abdel-Rahman is a lecturer in World Cinema at the University of Liverpool.

In case of Hindi cinema’s auteur Raj Kapoor (1924-1988), however, his craft also had its own sensibilities and politics in his early films like Aag (1948), Aawara (1951), and Shree 420 (1955), where the working class figure is at the forefront, migrating to the city, now losing, now finding its own self. Despite the leftist affiliations and political involvements of several studio artists of R. K. Films & Studios (est. 1948 in Bombay by Raj Kapoor), there was strong ideological variation in the performance of the working class figures in Raj Kapoor’s cinema. In this regard, this paper will look into the auteurist subjectivity of Raj Kapoor, which will help us to explore the genre possibilities that his imaginations of the working class opened up. The paper will extend to a consideration of the city’s labour which migrated to the R. K. Films & Studios itself, and its nature of work, while exploring the specific working class figure within the diegetic universe of Raj Kapoor. This is because even the future of the studio workers and the studio itself was tied to the life of Raj Kapoor, as the auteurist filmmaking process often demands. In consideration of the political context of postcolonial Indian cinema, this paper foregrounds the figure of the auteur, wading through his power and powerlessness, in the discussion of labour futures in cinema.\n\nBio:\n\nParnika Agarwal is a PhD candidate in Film Studies at the School of Liberal Arts, Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur, India.

Amateur cinema as a vernacular source for the ecocritical thought.\n\nCan amateur films and home movies serve as valuable primary sources for the environmental humanities? If so, what insights can they offer? These are the main inquiries that guided my doctoral research, during which I analysed through an ecocritical lens more than 300 vacation home movies filmed in Italy between 1950 and 1980. To achieve this goal, I used a mixed methodology - both in archival research and in visual analysis - including tools from digital humanities and social sciences.\n\nThe focus of this contribution will be on one of the themes that emerged from the research, specifically, the relationship between tourists and fishermen during the Italian economic boom of the late second post-war period. It will be demonstrated how tourists from affluent and modern areas perceived and represented the labour of rural fishing in poorer areas. The narratives reveal a contrast between the perceptions of tourists and fishermen on the relationship between humans and non-human animals, specifically during dramatic scenes such as traditional tuna and swordfish fishing.\n\nBio:\n\nPietro Agnoletto is a PhD candidate in Urban Studies at Milano-Bicocca University.

This paper tries to study the semi-fictional representation of the working women’s rights movement in the anthology section “Asanghadithar” (dir. Kunjila Mascilamani) in Freedom Fight (Jeo Baby 2022) featuring ‘penkoottu’- a community of women in the unorganised sector in Calicut, Kerala. The focus of the paper is to understand the creation of a spectacle out of the otherwise ignored movement of women’s collectivisation and rewriting the male ideas of labour. This will be studied in parallel to Women in Cinema Collective (WCC) as a significant paradigm shift in the cinematic structure for women, both in one way existing against the unorganised framework of their workplaces to resist, challenge and win the rightful conditions for working for women. This line of argument will be approached with the contention that fetishisation of women’s labour and resulting ignorance of their output stems from the inherent patriarchal structures of the Malayalee consciousness and the medium of oppression itself (in this case, site of workplace for Penkoottu and cinema for WCC) is used to display the convergence of ideology and pragmatics which is particularly relevant because of the director’s (Kunjila Mascilamani) role as the creator of the work and as an activist member of WCC as well.\n\nBio:\n\nMalavika Ajikumar is a PhD scholar at School of Social Sciences and Languages, Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore.

Questions of extraction (or, more specifically, extractivism) and histories of representation abound in relation to intersecting networks of capitalism, Christianity, and colonialism on the Latin American continent – and the depredations of the imperial silver mining trade in particular. This paper situates Farocki’s moving image practice within the broader media and technological genealogies and logics of extractivism.\n\nThe importance of ‘soft montage’ or ‘cross influence’, a signature of Farocki’s later oeuvre, to this kind of investigation is paramount. The compositional form of two-channel video installation entails a crossing between image tracks to frame the archaeological and the art historical across space and over time. Farocki presents a plea for an intermedial and media-archaeological moving image practice that enlists cinematography to perform a forensic examination of superficial representations. Farocki’s analysis sees the use of close-up, tracking shots, and static shots of de Berrío’s landscape to dwell on the class and racial hierarchies that might otherwise fall below the register of visibility on regarding de Berrío’s eighteenth-century rendering. I argue Farocki’s intermedial moving image practice reprises his abiding interest in the connections between film history and histories of labour. More specifically, the extractivist mining of silver and the dominations of worker and landscape it entails are imbricated in a broader history of colonial violence and genealogies of moving image reproduction.\n\nBio:\n\nLawrence Alexander holds a PhD in Film and Screen Studies from the University of Cambridge and is a Leverhulme Early-Career Research Fellow at the Ruskin School of Art (University of Oxford).

A subject which is discussed less is the distinction between the upper-class spaces, which are often filmed on location in ‘authentic’ spaces, and servant’s spaces, which tend to be filmed in studios. With research drawing from twenty interviews with people working in the heritage industry, this paper will explore the different ways spectacular, authentic and studio locations are used in heritage media and how the representations of labour often relate closely to the film locations used. One of the greatest distinctions between real locations and sets can be seen in Downton Abbey (2010-2015, ITV), where the upper-class spaces were shot at Highclere Castle, whereas the servants’ spaces (the ‘below stairs’) were constructed in Ealing Studios. What does it mean for only upper-class stories to be shot in authentic spaces? How does it affect the interpretation of history and of the narrative? Is it directly related to production restrictions or is it more class-motivated? Whilst not only considering the inherent labour division in using ‘real’ historic spaces as opposed to designing and building sets, this paper will also focus on how spaces of labour, such as kitchens and sculleries are designed and used in comparison to their historical counterparts. This paper considers heritage media such as Gosford Park (2001, Robert Altman) to the more recent examples of Victoria (2016-2019, ITV) and Bridgerton (2020-, Netflix) and its use of stately homes and designed sets.\n\nBio:\n\nRosemary Alexander-Jones is a teaching fellow at Warwick University where she convenes and co-ordinates the Inquiry Research Skills modules for the International Foundation Programme.

It examines how engaging an intergenerational dialogue between historical and contemporary practices can facilitate mutual knowledge creation and preservation of collective methods.\n\nStudying the methods and objectives of 1970s and 1980s feminist film collectives presents challenges due to the scarcity of sources and scholarly materials. A considerable amount of the films created within collectives remains unindexed and inaccessible. Likewise, research related to their work remains notably rare. Ironically, the obstacles encountered in researching collectives mirror the very power dynamics they sought to confront through their activism. This research endeavor involves two pivotal collectives: the Yugantar Collective (India), and the Filmkollektiv (Switzerland), through interviews with Deepa Dhanraj and Gertrud Pinkus, to reflect on their work which challenged dominant production methods, considering how it formed structures and methodologies that were previously unrecognized in the context of film production, in different geographies and complex forms of marginalities.\n\nToday's film collectives often participate more prominently in the standard film industry, responding to the increasing demands for broader labor and skill sets: many groups are involved in diverse activities like production, research, curation, and hosting. The paper assesses the potential of these multifaceted engagements for overcoming limitations faced by historical counterparts, e.g. by aiding contemporary collectives with documenting their work and gaining institutional recognition. This inquiry aspires to bridge documentation gaps, foster cross-generational conversations about alternative approaches to film work, and ultimately preserve the histories of independent filmmaking movements.\n\nBio:\n\nDanai Anagnostou is a researcher in production studies.

Though the unions secured significant concessions to their labour rights in the negotiations, the future of performer labour in the industries remains uncertain, especially the rights of individual performers against the AI impersonation of their image and voice in perpetuity. Existing legal and ethical frameworks around the ownership and moral rights of the individual against impersonation are ill-equipped to deal with an already-arrived future in which a hyperrealistic simulation can easily take the place of the performer persona.\n\nThese circumstances provide a strong staging ground for a reconsideration of the practice, process and work of impersonation. This paper aims to initiate this conversation by considering key elements that impact upon the working life of the impersonator, that is, the individual whose main role is in providing physical or vocal impressions of well-known individuals across media but primarily in television. The paper will explore the opportunities for media appearances, and their limitations; the role of competition; the challenge of the impersonated person maintaining or losing relevance; the dependence upon events beyond their control; and the ethics of impersonation. Drawing on interviews with three television impressionists, and a study of two political impersonators, this paper will explore the specifically precarious labour of temporarily being someone else for a living.\n\nBio:\n\nHannah Andrews is Associate Professor of Film and Media at the University of Lincoln.

I explore the bond between an artist and animals as part of my film and animation studies. I concentrate on animators’ labour in general, their personal experience, and their thoughts and feelings about animating CG animals for fiction films. I allude their animation labour to an anecdote about Rembrandt Bugatti (1884–1916), the Italian animal sculptor. The allusion to this sculptor is fundamental to catalysing philosophical inquiries, conceptual arguments, and dialectical discussion about the relationship between artists and animals. It galvanises questions of proximity between humans and animals and the technological effects between them. Both the animal sculptor and the animators illuminated the philosophical notion of “every separation is a link” by the French philosopher Simone Weil. The animation technology that separates humans and animals is exactly the link that could potentially reconcile the ontological divide between them. This paper aims to provide a window through which we can look beyond human exceptionalism and embrace the triad of humans, animals, and technology.\n\nBio:\n\nI am a PhD candidate in Film Studies at Queen Mary University of London, looking specifically into the human-animal-technological relationship in film and animation.

The technological innovations within the household and the policy of a family wage individualised the reproductive workers and isolated them in the social form of the “housewife”. The housewife then lives in an endless loop of daily routines of caring for the house and family. However, are there any continuities between this reproductive labour and the cognitive labour we perform in the digital space, as Kylie Jarrett indicates (Jarrett, 2016)? And is videographic scholarship capable of not only showing but also analysing these continuities?\n\nIn our paper, we aim to present and contextualise our videographic essay Cycles of Labour, which remediates the daily routines captured in the film Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (Chantal Akerman, 1975) through a simulated video-game interface. The essay takes the viewer through three stages in the cycle of extending the housewife logic into the digital sphere. It proceeds from introducing the evolution of reproductive labour to a playthrough that foregrounds the connections between reproductive and cognitive labour in the datafied society to a demonstration of how this development of housework translates into the labour of NPCs (non-playable characters) in video games. As a result, the videographic essay highlights that the heroine of Akerman’s film is not alone in her repetitive endeavours. In the virtual space, we are all becoming “digital housewives” (Jarrett, 2016).\n\nLink to the videographic essay (published in NECSUS):\n\nhttps://necsus-ejms.org/cycles-of-labour-in-the-metaverse-we-will-be-housewives/\n\nBio:\n\nJiří Anger is a British Academy Postdoctoral Fellow at Queen Mary University of London.

Nature metaphors abstract land use and resource-extraction, and obfuscate the scarring of landscape by these physical processes.\n\nDrawing on texts such as “Theories of the Earth” (Leo Goldsmith), “Geological Filmmaking” (Sasha Litvintseva), and “A Geology of Media” (Jussi Parikka), The Surface Will Not Hold proposes a conceptual framework through which to read visual/sonic representations of labor, data, and precious metal extraction. Together, the featured films consider the interplay of sky/ground, digital/celluloid, immaterial/material, making/archiving—where data, images, and their ideologies are stored.\n\nFilmography:\n\nVault, Bunker, Shelter from the Storm (Noa Ryan, 2020)\n\nA found footage and animation collage about imperial history, deterioration, and the political dimensions of watching.\n\nThe Floor of the World (Janie Geiser, 2010)\n\nCollage images and objects suggest narratives of burying, uncovering, building, destroying, longing, and loss.\n\nOil Wells: Sturgeon Road & 97th St. (Christina Battle, 2002)\n\nHighlighting the repetitive nature of oil wells in northern Alberta, this hand processed film documents a sighting common to the Canadian prairies.\n\nRuisdael Clouds (James Thacher, 2020)\n\nA man-made climate system with its own tidal movements of information.\n\nBliss.jpg (Emily Apter & Elijah Stevens, 2023) Bliss.jpg excavates and examines the geological and geographical sites that produce our virtual worlds.\n\nBio:\n\nEmily Rose Apter is a programmer, filmmaker, and organizer based in Brooklyn, NY.

Recognising that amateur film is rendered marginalised and undervalued in relation to commercial and professional filmmaking and women undervalued in relation to men (Motrescu-Mayes & Norris Nicholson, 2018; Hill & Johnston, 2020; O’Connell, 2021), the presentation uses the case study of one Irish amateur filmmaker to identify the causes of her work and labour being obscured and overlooked. The filmmaker, Sr Maureen MacMahon, was a practicing amateur filmmaking from the 1960s to the 1970s. Investigation of Sr Maureen’s filmmaking drew from a variety of sources including the films and film materials held at the Irish Film Archive, film metadata recorded at the archive, newspaper archives, an archive held at Sr Maureen’s religious order and an interview with Sr Maureen. Analyses of these materials has resulted in three findings: firstly, the dispersal of materials and information pertaining to Sr Maureen across multiple sites, and in collections named after other men, posed challenges for locating her materials; secondly Sr Maureen undertook many creative activities beyond filmmaking, and, was reluctant to self-identify as a ‘filmmaker’, thus negating her own filmmaking labour; and, finally, the films are not easily categorised as they are generically and stylistically diverse, making auteurist approaches to her films difficult. Drawing from these findings I discuss the challenges this creates for foregrounding women’s contributions to film, especially when women’s contributions are already undervalued and poorly documented.\n\nBio:\n\nSarah Arnold is Associate Professor and Head of Media Studies at Maynooth University, Ireland.

This paper considers how Alice Diop’s documentaries La Mort de Danton / The Death of Danton (2011) and Nous / We (2021) challenge these racist tropes and traces two further interfaces between race and labour. The first is the work of the film’s diverse Black subjects, such as aspiring actor Steve who commutes from a poor suburb to a prestigious Parisian drama school in La Mort de Danton and Ismael Soumaïla Sissoko, the impoverished mechanic sans papiers who sleeps in a Transit van in Nous. The second is the labour of Diop herself, claiming the licence of filmmaker to hear and broadcast these narratives of hitherto marginalised people in a country where, as T.D. Keaton et al (2012) put it, ‘race does not officially reside, even as racism and discrimination are long-term residents’. In the footage of a deer hunt in the ancient royal forest of Fontainebleau that bookends Nous, Diop appears as something of an interloper at a whites-only event. But she refuses to remain contained in her ‘right’ place. The act of filming gives her an armature and an authority (to look for herself and to create meaning) that would otherwise be denied a Black woman from les banlieues who has ventured into the woods of Fontainebleau.\n\nBio:\n\nThomas Austin is Professor of Film Studies at the University of Sussex.

Films are, and present, the work of their authors, credited or uncredited, while film production exists as one part of an industry dependent on distribution, promotion and presentation. Film historians have extensively examined film production: the smaller (but increasing) number of studies that focus on cinema exhibition have opened up a wider field that includes cinema owners (from Major to neighbourhood operators) and audiences but has so far barely touched on the experiences and significance of the majority of the 136,987 men and 73,221 women that the U.S. Census calculated were employed in the U.S. theatre and motion picture industries in 1950, let alone examine the equivalent situation in other countries and at other dates. My own recent research on the 1950s American drive-in concentrated on cinema owners and audiences rather than employees but revisiting this can open up important questions about the role of individual workers within the less regarded reaches of the film industry. Reflecting on instances where archives and trade publications do provide evidence on cinema managers and workers, this paper does not set out to construct a detailed case study, but assesses what we can learn about mid-twentieth century cinema as work. It also illustrates how the drive-in cinema, often characterized as an industry outsider, was integrated into the business and communication networks of post-war America.\n\nBio:\n\nGuy Barefoot is Honorary Visiting Fellow at the University of Leicester.

These local contexts reflect ‘green extractivism’: ecological transition integrated within the extractive logics of capitalist production, augmenting the exploitation of nature and labour. The films present two contrasting types of energy production: the arduous work of converting sunlight and soil into food, unfolding within a qualitative world of complex human and non-human interrelations; and the impersonal work of machines to convert wind and sunlight into quantified invisible energy that feeds urban areas, leaving the rural areas where they are located barren. However, the films themselves are labour products. Sorogoyen has been critiqued as an outsider to the rural context he portrays, while Simón is considered an insider, basing the fictional agricultural family on her own. They both draw from personal experiences and documentation of qualitative worlds, wishing to preserve them but also abstracting them into film worlds. Like large-scale renewable energy production, they aim to preserve life but depend somewhat on extractive logics and material practices.\n\nBio:\n\nJesse Barker is a specialist in contemporary Spanish film.

Often authored by men, with ready access to the leading trade journals of the day, the labour performed by women in majority-female roles (continuity, negative cutting etc) has historically been dismissed as low skill and/or predicated on ‘natural’ abilities, and paid accordingly. This marginalisation has been replicated in the histories of British cinema, especially where auteur scholarship dominates. Moving away from male-authored accounts of work, this paper puts women’s words centre-stage to explore how women themselves understood the relationship between their labour and screen media. Through a focus on mid-20thC women working in make-up and continuity roles, it traces some early examples of grade equivalence arguments made by women, and contextualises them within a tightly-controlled grading structure with a specific understanding of technical labour and union-led claims of equal pay. Drawing on contemporary trade publications and later-life oral history interviews, this paper examines how historic women described and understood their labour at the time and subsequently, and opens out to a broader discussion of the specific contours of feminism in post-war Britain, a time famously characterised by Elizabeth Wilson as ‘Only Halfway to Paradise’ (1980).\n\nBio:\n\nMelanie Bell is Professor of Film History at the University of Leeds, UK.

Praised for its stories drawing on Irish folklore and showcasing ‘retro 2D beauty’ through a ‘painterly hand-drawn aesthetic’ (Rooney, 2022), the studio’s Oscar-nominated output notably differs from computer-animated franchises and remakes dominating contemporary mainstream animation. The very creation of a studio relying on 2D animation in the late 1990s may seem surprising, at a time when competitors such as Pixar and Blue Sky Studios were set up and ‘geared specifically towards computer animation’, and others such as DreamWorks entirely retooled their 2D animation departments (Haswell, 2017). Yet, such positioning echoes 2000s trends within independent European animation, with critically-acclaimed filmmakers such as Marjane Satrapi and Sylvain Chomet explicitly distancing their work from computer animation.\n\nThis paper explores Cartoon Saloon’s self-representation in relation to contemporary animation aesthetics and techniques, and more specifically its complex discursive relationship towards labour practices within digital animation. As Caroline Ruddell and Paul Ward point out, there is ‘no simple distinction in animation production between that which has been crafted by hand and that which has been crafted by technology’ (2019). However, 2D and stop motion animation studios tend to specifically foreground such craft-based elements. Drawing on paratexts including “behind-the-scenes” materials, interviews and reviews of Song of the Sea (Moore, 2014), The Breadwinner (Twomey, 2017), and Wolfwalkers (Moore and Stewart, 2020), this paper analyses how Cartoon Saloon relies on the appeals of hand-made aesthetics and discourses surrounding analogue technology and practices in order to foreground a distinctive studio identity.\n\nBio:\n\nDr Eve Benhamou is a Teaching Fellow in Film Studies at the Université Paul-Valéry Montpellier 3.

We find ourselves questioning our objectives and contemplating how best to articulate our mission within the constraints of a flawed neo-liberal system. Our aim is to navigate this complex landscape and define our purpose while striving to achieve it, despite the challenges posed by the current educational paradigm.\n\nThe questions this paper seeks to ask, in the specific context of filmmaking education, are: 1. What are the alternatives? and 2. how might we go about encouraging a more radical agenda through our pedagogic practice? Few tools seem appropriate to the current climate but there are options that are important to imagine (or better still, to enact!) One of those is the notion of ‘radical hope’. For Bloch (1996), as for our purposes here, a condition of art is hope. Conversely, art is also a condition of hope.\n\nHjort claims that ‘the priorities and philosophies of institutions devoted to practice-oriented film education have a decisive impact on filmmakers’ creative outlooks, working practices, and networks, shaping not only the stylistic (visual and narrative) regularities that define distinctive bodies of cinematic work but the dynamics of a given film industry’ (2013: p.34). What’s left then, is to consider what impact such radical hope might encourage in educators and our students. We need to readdress, by encouraging others, the ways in which the work educators are doing in higher education spaces, is genuinely shaping the future of art, design, our creative industries and cultures.\n\nBio:\n\nLee-Jane has taught at university level for over 20 years and enjoys teaching at the intersection of theory and practice.

Sleepers were often youth-orientated films, focussing on late adolescence after high school. These coming-of-age pictures typically put great emphasis on the summer job as a rite of passage. Storylines were concerned with the change that occurred across that seminal summer and demonstrated that what a summer job lacked in remuneration, clout, and prestige it more than made up for in that most valuable commodity of teen summer labour: experience. Well known teen movies from the 1980s (Sixteen Candles (Hughes,USA,1984) and The Breakfast Club (Hughes,USA,1985), on the other hand, focussed on the in-school experience of high school teens or even the academic labour famously avoided in Ferris Bueller’s Day Off (Hughes, USA, 1986). There is a dearth of scholarship on teen labour immediately after high school. This summer straddling youth and adulthood and the labour depicted were critical to sleepers like One Crazy Summer (Holland, USA, 1986), Welcome to 18 (Carr, USA,1986), Satisfaction (Freeman, USA, 1988), and Loverboy (Silver, USA, 1989). My paper seeks to understand how this representation of teen summer labour works within these sleepers and what meaning can be formed from what is often seen as just a throwaway job.\n\nBibliography\n\nBy ALJEAN HARMETZ Special to The New,York Times. \"Ratings for Top Movies on HBO are Falling.\" New York Times (1923-), Apr 15, 1985. https://liverpool.idm.oclc.org/login?url?url=https://www.proquest.com/historical-newspapers/ratings-top-movies-on-hbo-are-falling/docview/111232147/se-2.\n\nBio:\n\nMatthew Bosica is a 3rd year PhD candidate in Communication and Media at University of Liverpool.

Talent managers are a growing part of the British television ecosystem and this presentation will explore talent management labour practices by tracing their evolution with the rapid increase of independent production companies and a growing freelance workforce in the UK. It is easy to assume that this role, which is predominantly undertaken by women, often with caring responsibilities, is purely administrative. However, this presentation draws on in-depth interviews and close textual analysis of trade press to shed light on the hidden labour practices of television talent managers, exploring specific forms of collaborative creativity that arise from their position straddling the business and editorial spheres of TV production. It will argue that talent managers, who have typically worked at top levels within the production sector, are key agents in the creative collaborative process within the screen industries. I will explore the intricacies and mechanics of the role and the ways in which talent managers build relationships with hiring managers and those they are employed to ‘find’, such as executives, directors, producers, and researchers, arguing that talent managers are more than facilitators of creativity, they are active collaborators in the creative process.\n\nBio:\n\nLucy Brown is Professor of Film and Television Practice and Head of the Film Division at London South Bank University.

A keen observer of society, he is comparable to a flâneur, minus connotations of wealth. In Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot (1954), Mon Oncle (1958), Playtime (1967), and Trafic (1971), Hulot is a man for whom an increasingly technological post-WWII French society poses a threat to his traditional and implicitly valorised way of life. He can never maintain remunerative work despite good intentions. In Mon Oncle, Hulot’s brother-in-law instals him in a job at his plastics factory, whereupon Hulot precipitates an insidious production line malfunction. In Playtime, Hulot arrives at an office block for a business meeting that ultimately comes to naught as Hulot becomes confounded by the modern architecture. Finally, in Trafic, Hulot is now the designer of luxury campervans who encounters various problems with a vehicle en route to a trade fair.\n\nWhile Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot omits the subject of Hulot and paid labour entirely, as its subject matter is the protagonist on vacation, I seek to show how it and the three aforementioned films demonstrate the more fulfilling character of Hulot’s voluntary work, that includes his efforts to help strangers as well as acceding to the requests of his relatives and neighbours. This voluntary ‘work’ appears to provide a social function as well as unintentionally promoting non-pejorative and guilt-free individualism that aligns with the theories of 19th century philosopher John Stuart Mill.\n\nBio:\n\nMatthew Bruce is a PhD student in French (Film) Studies at the University of Birmingham, whose project is entitled: “Les plaisirs démodés: the portrayal of anachronistic heroes in French comedy cinema”.

Set in Queens’ run-down neighbourhood of Willets Point—commonly known as the “Iron Triangle” for its aggregation of auto-body repair garages—the film follows 12-year-old Alejandro, a homeless Latino kid who lives and works in one of the area’s chop shops. The child survives by hustling: he sells bootleg DVDs around the area, steals rims off cars at parking lots, and chases potential clients for the garage on the streets. His condition as a low-wage worker, then, implies that he is pushed to be perpetually on the move if he wants to succeed in a world run by individualism and competition—what Lauren Berlant calls the “time of not-stopping” (2011, 169). However, the hustle of the labouring kid does not translate into a greater ability to navigate the urban, nor it leads to greater social mobility. This paper explores the implications of such a representation of neoliberal labour for the film’s staging of New York as a cinematic city. By codifying labour as relentless but futile mobility, Chop Shop transcends the binarism of prevalent imaginaries of the urban—poverty associated to the static ghetto vs. the accelerated rhythms of the global elite—and presents New York instead as a space of unjust (im)mobilities (Sheller 2018), in which the interaction between fixity and flow creates the conditions for the perpetuation of social inequality.\n\nReferences:\n\nBerlant, Lauren. 2011.

This ongoing failure to acknowledge women’s non-professional work is to the detriment of many cine-engaged women active in the first half of the twentieth century. The Wessex Film and Sound Archive (WFSA) holds a non-professional medical film, Plaster of Paris (1913), ostensibly attributed to Dr Henry Gauvain. New research has revealed that this film, and a collection of still photographs, were in fact produced by Dr Henry Gauvain’s wife: Louisa; yet documents reflect her presence only as a genitive pronoun and her name does not appear in the archive catalogue.My paper will examine how films produced before 1922 and the widespread introduction of amateur media, can be problematic to categorise within the amateur/professional binary. I will illustrate that the ways women and their work is spoken about has a direct impact on their invisibility in the film archive. I will explore how persistent application of conventional industry terminology in the non-professional sphere sets women’s work against a ‘gold standard’. Through analysis of several case studies, including the work of Louisa Gauvain and of a few autonomous women filmmakers, I will illustrate how a methodology deploying both quantitative and qualitative methods can effectively make the work of women amateur filmmakers more visible. I will argue that a reframing of women amateur fimmakers ’ labour is necessary if we are to effectively recognise female contributions to non-professional film in the UK.\n\nBio:\n\nZoë Burgess is a final year PGR in film at the University of Southampton, works as Film Curator at Wessex Film and Sound Archive in Winchester, U, and holds the position of Research Associate on the UKRI funded ‘Women in Focus’ project at the University of East Anglia/University of Maynooth.\n\nJoanne Butcher\n\nLabour Trafficking in Film: Underreported, Unspectacular & Unrepresented\n\nNarrative films about historical slavery, particularly the transatlantic slave trade, have empowered audiences to view labour as an expression of exploitation in a transnational system contingent on the work of the enslaved. However, narrative films about human trafficking – referred to as ‘modern-day slavery’ – seldom focus on labour trafficking despite the fact it is also a symptom of a global economic structure which equally relies on precarious labour practices and the exploitation of workers. Instead, contemporary films have concentrated on more easily sensationalised forms of human trafficking such as ‘sexual slavery’. This has framed human trafficking as an individualised and externalised problem of organised crime, alienating the audience from seeing themselves as participating in the economic system that precipitates the exploitation being represented. This disguises the complicity of governments in facilitating a hostile environment where labour exploitation is rife, as well as corporations for taking advantage of it. In cinematic terms, labour trafficking is rendered “unspectacular” (Sharma, 2005) and therefore unworthy of narrative cinema, having the effect of legitimising and naturalising labour exploitation in the eyes of the public. This paper will explore the current state of narrative films about human trafficking, examining the dominant themes and narratives that prohibit the discussion of labour trafficking. It will also consider a number of recent narrative films that have tackled the issue of labour trafficking such as It's a Free World… (2007), Ghosts (2006) and 7 Prisoners (2021), arguing the strengths of narrative cinema over documentary in bringing issues of complicity to light.\n\nBio:\n\nJoanne Butcher is a PhD student from the University of Hull.

In this talk, I extend Skvirsky’s arguments to consider how, in cinematic representations of reproductive work, the reproductive worker’s expressed unhappiness is often made equivalent to her political consciousness. Through a reading of U.S. filmmaker Fronza Woods’ Fannie’s Film (1979), a portrait film about a Black woman named Fannie who cleans a fitness studio, I explore how Fannie’s happiness has been regarded as a political problem for both the filmmaker and audiences alike. Indeed, the anticipation of Fannie’s unhappiness was central to Woods’ initial conceptualization of the film. As Woods recalls in a recent interview: “When I made the film, she was supposed to be my anger button. She was supposed to come out and say angry things. No matter how I approached it, I couldn’t get any anger out of her!” Ultimately, I argue that Fannie’s Film poses questions about the role of affect in making the reproductive worker legible as a political subject. I am interested in what must be expunged from cinematic representation to carve out a place for the Black reproductive worker within what Saidiya Hartman has called a received “lexicon of the political.”\n\nBio:\n\nBeth Capper is an assistant professor of Film Studies at the University of Alberta.

What roles can mentoring play? Studies have demonstrated the value of mentoring within creative enterprises in relation to both personal career development and increasing equitable access to creative occupations (Grugulis and Stoyanova, 2012; NESTA, 2014). However, these accounts offer only a limited depiction of the huge variety of mentoring practice which exists across the variegated set of industries which constitute the UK's creative sector. This paper draws upon survey data generated in 2022 by an interdisciplinary research project which was supported by policy body Creative UK. Whilst data was collected from across all creative industries, the screen industries offer a particularly useful case study due to the often precarious nature of employment for workers in this sector. Our investigation offers a new understanding of the nature of mentoring programme provision and the challenges the screen industries face in developing sustainable initiatives since the Covid-19 pandemic. The findings indicate that while many mentoring schemes are designed to tackle the barriers of inequality for new entrants and existing employees, their outcomes are often compromised by sectoral precarity in the creative industries.

The success of these films helped the constitution of the New Latin American Cinema canon, conformed in its vast majority by films directed by male filmmakers. Following these moments of contestation, from the 1970s, an increasing number of women filmmakers began making films that deployed feminist practices, politics, and aesthetics. In this paper, I argue that the study of political cinema has left out a number of films made by women about women’s labour that provide a different perspective on the class struggle. To do so, I explore four documentaries that, broadly, address the role of women in the revolution, the double day, the incorporation of women into factories, and the status of domestic work. These are: My Contribution (Sara Gómez, 1972), The Double Day (Helena Solberg, 1975), Love, Women, and Flowers (Marta Rodríguez and Jorge Silva, 1984-1989), and Because I Wanted to Go to School (María Barea, 1990). The focus of my analysis lies on how the production practices employed in the making of these films allowed the creation of safe spaces that facilitated the act of speaking out amongst previously marginalized subjects. In addition, I explore how women’s voices were then constructed and interwoven within feminist debates that brought to the fore questions related to women’s role in production and reproduction.\n\nBio:\n\nLorena Cervera is a Senior Lecturer in Film Production at AUB and holds a PhD in Film Studies from UCL.

This was particularly well deserved, not least because Harris was employed as the costume designer just before production started, with director John Schlesinger admitting in correspondence, ‘I myself still feel guilty about having sacked a great personal friend of mine who designed the clothes for Darling, two days before it started’ (15 September 1965). As Schlesinger praised Harris following her win, ‘I was so pleased about it – if anyone deserved it, you did, taking on such a tricky job at the last minute’ (24 May 1966).\n\nDrawing upon a range of sources held in the British Film Institute Special Collections and the Film Finances Archive including scripts, budgets, correspondence, costume designs, daily progress reports and weekly cost reports, my paper will outline the labour of Harris, as well as Schlesinger, Jackie Breed (wardrobe mistress), Eddie Silva (wardrobe master), and the lead actors on contributing to the costuming for this key film in British cinema history. By analysing these documents as a whole, we can understand the agency that Schlesinger initially had over making costume decisions, including notes taken at an early production meeting on 10 August 1964, for example re Diana: ‘Clothes very Quantish. Mad zany straw hat … NB. Julie Christie is very good in hats. When we first see Julie she must look stunning’. My paper will further analyse the labour of Harris, Breed and Silva in implementing the director’s vision for the costumes, analysing costume designs and the process of creating these costumes for the screen.\n\nBio:\n\nLlewella Chapman is a visiting scholar at the University of East Anglia.

Despite these 92 years of history, this cinema has revived itself recently. The film Meghdhanushya- the colours of Our Lives (2013) was the first Gay film in Gujarati cinema. The film, with adult ‘A’ certification from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), was produced in Gujarat by an Ayurveda practitioner doctor who addressed homosexual changes (body), realization (self), and acceptance and resistance (society). Although the film intended to raise awareness on LGBTQ issues in a society where discussing those remains taboo, the state did not provide tax relief to the producer citing a ‘national threat’. This article examines the state cinematic policy (2014) and its revision in 2022. With a brief background on Gujarati cinema and gender representation across Gujarati films, this paper argues why the state faces challenges to intervening at the policy level for the inclusion of LGBTQ representation in Gujarati cinema despite decriminalizing article 377 of the Indian Penal Code in 2018.\n\nBio:\n\nDr. Mrunal Chavda is an Assistant Professor in Business Communication at the Indian Institute of Management Raipur.

Appearing across decades and genres, the motel has served as a hideout for noirish criminals, a shelter for forbidden lovers, and a pitstop for road weary travelers. Typically, we encounter the motel from the perspective of these protagonist-guests, whose desires and ambitions mark the generic, blank space of the motel room with refuse, wrinkled sheets, and bodily stains. However, this paper seeks to investigate the underexplored perspective of the motel worker in film, whose labour restores the motel to a semblance of sterility and whose presence disrupts conventional understandings of the motel as a temporary “stopping place” (Clarke, Pfannhauser, and Doel 2009).\n\nRooted in recent critical discussions concerning mobility, precarity, and place (Court 2020; Wojcik 2021), my investigation is two-fold. First, I trace the history of the motel manager on screen, marking the figure’s evolution from enterprising businessman in the budding roadside accommodation industry of the 1930s (It Happened One Night 1934, They Live by Night 1948), to murderous and marginalized staple character of the horror genre (Psycho 1960, Motel Hell 1980, Mountaintop Motel Massacre 1983), and, finally, to provisional patriarch of the hidden homeless in contemporary depictions of the motel as welfare housing (Florida Project 2017). Next, I examine how an atypical emphasis on motel maids in American indie cinema (Bottle Rocket 1996, The Motel 2005) spotlights the repetitive, banal, and often precarious labour associated with the increasingly marginalised American industry of motel accommodation—an industry dominated by migrant and first-generation American workers.\n\nBio:\n\nDanielle Rae Childs is a third-year PhD Candidate in Film and Television Studies at the University of Warwick.

Published in February 2024 as a part of Palgrave’s (Re)Presenting Gender series, the volume is concerned with media representations of women’s participation in the contemporary labour market. In the text, I explore the representations of sex workers in HBO’s Game of Thrones (2011-2019). The show itself has been simultaneously praised for its strong women characters and heavily criticised for its sexual abuse and violence against women, but broader discourse concerning representation focuses on high born queens and honorific ladies. Little is written about its minor characters, including the three named sex workers - Shae (Sibel Kekilli), Ros (Esme Bianco) and Daisy (Maisie Dee) - who have a pivotal role in establishing narrative branches in the complex landscape of the storyworld.\n\nExisting scholarship on the televisual representations of sex workers is relatively limited when compared with that of other typically female character types, so this paper makes a contribution to the body of work through the application of an inclusive feminist framework. It adopts a tripartite approach that considers the issues of precarity, exploitation and marginalisation and how they impact each of the women in the series. By treating Shae, Ros and Daisy as individuals, I highlight the problems associated with considering sex workers as a homogenous group and depriving them of the ability to tell their own stories.\n\nBio:\n\nLouise Coopey is a Teaching Fellow at the University of Birmingham.

In the mid-1970s screen production in Scotland was limited and the local freelance workforce consisted of no more than seventy individuals across creative and technical roles. Keen to venture into bigger budget projects, freelancers came together to launch the Film Bang manifesto, campaigning for more funding and institutional support. This ignited a series of transformations in the local sector. Since then, screen production in Scotland has significantly expanded and diversified, with the country experiencing an unprecedented boom in filming activity in recent years thanks to the increased demand for high-end television content for the global streaming market. Based on analysis of career biographies and historical data from the annual Film Bang directory of Scottish-based freelance crew personnel, the paper describes how particular policies and developments over the years have helped with the training, skills diversification, and expansion of the Scottish-based freelance pool. The paper also draws on data from oral history interviews with freelance technicians employed in the local sector in the last few decades to understand how they managed to establish long-lasting careers while negotiating the challenges and opportunities of the times, brought by changes in sectoral policies, funding, and institutions. Overall, the paper will contribute to broader understanding of talent development strategies and career sustainability in screen production sectors of small nations and regions.\n\nBio:\n\nNelson Correia is a PhD researcher investigating the development of the screen workforce in Scotland over the last half-century.

In actuality, the film reflects numerous problems and inequalities in the labour market in Japan and beyond, particularly in terms of how ‘women’s work’ has historically been treated. When considering the film through the lens of the intersection between feminism and Marxism, Spirited Away’s bathhouse can be viewed as a microcosm of contemporary Japanese society, representing how women come of age, enter the workforce, and are prohibited from experiencing career advancement, and Kaonashi becomes emblematic of how these structures influence the attitudes of individuals. Through this reading, characters like Chihiro, Lin, and Yubaba become even more compelling, and the film can be seen as a political statement that even comments (deliberately or otherwise) on some of Ghibli’s own practices.\n\nBio:\n\nZoe Crombie, an emerging researcher pursuing a PhD in Film Studies at Lancaster University, specializes in anime and adaptation studies.

Theoretical and empirical insights from Italian screen production.\n\nScreen age is an industry term worldwide used to signify the perceived age of an actor as they appear on screen. It is routinely referenced in above-the-line and below-the-line work materials, such as scripts, casting calls, talent portfolios, online professional profiles. Within the film and television production industry, screen age acts as an aesthetic benchmark, situating a character on the age spectrum, thanks to the actor’s display of certain outwardly features conventionally indicative of that age. Additionally–and consequently–screen age also functions as a segmentation criterion of the acting labour market, mapping and separating workers who, by virtue of their outwardly features, can aspire to, and compete for certain acting jobs. Screen age is a multilayered theoretical and operational concept that has yet to receive adequate scholarly attention. In this paper, I draw on sociology and cultural gerontology to account for various categorizations of age beyond chronological measurements, namely functional, subjective, and contextual age (Schwall 2012). Then, I rely on semi-structured interviews with Italian casting directors to argue that screen age is to be regarded as a distinct categorization of the age construct. Screen age is not so much shaped by an actor’s chronological age, nor by age norms prevailing in Italian contemporary society, as it is by industry labour practices (e.g. typecasting), as well as Italian film genre and format conventions. Finally, I discuss the (gendered, see Raisborough et al. 2022) implications of such theorization of screen age for actors’ access to the job market and career trajectories.\n\nBio:\n\nDr. Gloria Dagnino (PhD Università della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland), is research associate at the University of Udine (Italy) where works in the project AGE-C Aging and Gender in European Cinema.

FIlms like Graveyard Shift (1990), My Bloody Valentine (1989), and Return of the Living Dead (1985) all become sites of not only cheap silver screen scares, but sites of working class history, memory, and awareness. The same cultural machinery that forces discussions of labor and organizing off of mainstream channels brings it into discussion with genre film. This paper will build on the central thesis that genre film remains a productive vehicle for labor’s cultural discussion and explore how these titles interplay with the actual working conditions from which they rise up while landmark labor films like Eisenstein’s Strike become absorbed into the stultified enclaves of “great cinema.” Genre flicks remain sorely overlooked despite their vitality and frank engagement with labor, union politics, and organizing—what are we so afraid of?\n\nBio:\n\nAshley Darrow is a writer and film critic whose work covers genre film, counterculture, and political theory.

In this paper, I will discuss both case studies and normative models of spatial and temporal conditions, which characterise different kinds of collaborative labour across different stages of film and television production (development, pre-production, production, and post-production). This will include an examination of how the necessities of the Covid-19 pandemic have come together with contemporary concerns about health, wellbeing and inclusivity in the workplace to engender an increased focus in film and television industry discourse and practices on the need to render film and television work environments ‘safe spaces’. Drawing on existing theorisations of time and space, including Bakhtin’s notion of the ‘chronotope’ as a particular configuration of time, space and human activity, which becomes charged with meaning, I will consider the role of time and space as both enabling and limiting factors in the collaborative processes under discussion and the forms of creativity they may produce. I will conclude by recommending that time and space might be both more deliberately and more flexibly considered in the design of collaborative processes, in order to successfully facilitate particular forms of collaborative creativity. I will propose some potential collaborative ‘chronotopes’ as indicative models.\n\nBio:\n\nRosamund Davies is Senior Lecturer in the School of Stage and Screen, University of Greenwich.

Based on a fait divers, the film tells the story of a pregnant novelist of Senegalese heritage named Ramy (Kayije Kagami) who attends the trial of Laurence Coly (Guslagie Malanda), a Senegalese woman accused of infanticide after leaving her 15-month old daughter on a beach to drown. In a direct challenge to the secular and rationalist logic of the French state, Coly admits to the crime but pleads not guilty on the grounds that she has been subjected to sorcery by her wider family members.\n\nIn this paper, I consider how Diop uses her representation of labour - and its intersections with race and reproduction - to frame the relationality between her two central protagonists, and to subvert norms around motherhood, the maternal bond, and cultural assumptions surrounding reproductive bodies. On the one hand, I mobilise feminist ethical work on gesture and response-ability (Schneider 2017) to think through the film’s layering of maternal and postcolonial identities. On the other, I examine the ways in which Diop’s creative labour is bound up with her status as a mother and as a Black woman, and I interrogate how my own embodied and emotional labour as a researcher relates to the film and the questions it raises.\n\nBio:\n\nKaya Davies Hayon is a Lecturer in Film & Media at the Open University.

In the project, we offered the participants training on digital storytelling and documentary approaches using available technology. With the support of the research team, the participants made nine short films using their personal experiences as inspiration.\n\nUnprompted, a number of Elders used the filmmaking experience to creatively explore the relationship between their previous working lives and their post-retirement selves. Sharing our learning from this project, we explore the role zero budget filmmaking can play in creative ageing, and make two claims. Firstly, an approach to participatory filmmaking that applies the methods of digital storytelling can be a productive tool for facilitating individual and shared reflections on the process of ageing-in-place. Secondly, this approach has the potential to foster an improved sense of wellbeing and fulfilment that allows participants to connect ideas of self and livelihood through the development of new creative skills.\n\nIn conclusion, we work towards articulating a framework of “applied film”, where processes of production, circulation and reception can facilitate rich creative discussion around collective and individual experiences in specific contexts of community engagement.\n\nBio\n\nDr MaoHui Deng is Lecturer in Film Studies at the University of Manchester.

Whilst recent analyses have emphasised elements of this film missed by its initial Brechtian reception, the effects of the film’s new social-institutional contexts on our modes of looking and their continued power to generate new meaning and affect remain unattended to. By analysing contemporary exhibitions, home media releases, public screenings and Nightcleaners’ much lesser-known sister film ’36 to ‘77, I suggest two novel framings that first reconstitute the films as archival documents of historical labour, gender and cinematic struggles and secondly, position them as affective, pedagogical and political tools for use in the present.\n\nI argue that these framings require we both eschew the pessimist hermeneutics which have rendered the films as melancholic visions of a failed political moment and open up to a search for the utopian, not-yet-conscious political visions they contain. Analysing the films vis-à-vis a critical reading of Jacques Rancière's Proletarian Nights, I consider moments of surplus in which cleaners momentarily escape the determinations of labour to enter the aesthetic realms of music or memory. My reading develops these moments as open aesthetic spaces for cleaners' dreams of different social relations beyond labouring to escape. To close, I ask how our return to Nightcleaners and its retransciptions might reinvigorate contemporary struggles for precarious labour and emancipatory cinema.\n\nBio:\n\nOliver Dixon is an AHRC-funded PhD student in Film and Screen Studies at the University of Cambridge.

Most famous for his pioneering work for Paris Vogue and Harpers Bazaar in the 1930s and 1940s, Huene’s move to Hollywood was the result of a long-standing desire to shift his career into filmmaking and his close friendship with director George Cukor. Drawing on archival material held in the George Cukor Collection at the Margaret Herrick library in LA, this paper will situate Huene as a case study for highlighting the significance of social connections in facilitating access to work in film. More particularly, by focusing on the friendship and collaboration of two gay men, both of whom were members of highly influential ‘gay cultural orbits’, to use Thomas Waugh’s phrasing (1996: 105), it will underline the importance of queer artistic cultures to creative labour above and below-the-line in Hollywood. Given that much of the detail of these networks and cultures is embedded in personal correspondence, rather than professional documents, the paper will further consider the close connection between creative labour and intimacy, and the question of how to capture this in academic research.\n\nBio:\n\nLucy Fife Donaldson is Senior Lecturer in Film Studies at the University of St Andrews.

Fantasy may “help us see the world anew and … engage responsibly in the creation of better futures” (Bould & Vint, 2012). But what does fantasy reproduce, distort or discard from our real world in its conjuration of new or ‘better’ worlds? And to what political ends? By looking at popular fantasy adaptations that draw on a recognisably British mise-en-scène, this paper explores the symbolic functions labour serves when reintroduced to the fantasy world.In narratives that venture into the fantastic through a portal, a notable absence of working-class characters and locales raises questions about what our hero is escaping. In Harry Potter, magic and enchantment seem to have replaced the need for domestic labour; despite this we learn that this work is still being performed at the margins – by women and inferiorised subspecies. The His Dark Materials television series draws on a similar heritage setting in which one’s occupation and social position is fixed by an animal-soul. In both texts, characters with an identity formed around labour become disposable in service of the hero’s higher purpose. Do these fantasies imagine a new and better world, beyond exploitative labour relations? Or do they draw on the aesthetics of labour to reimagine class inequalities as biogenetically predetermined?\n\nThrough a close analysis of these emblematic examples of screen fantasy, this presentation uncovers the middle-class systems of value underpinning this dominant form.\n\nBio:\n\nJennifer Doveton is a third-year Techne scholar in film and television at Brunel University.

In the 1890s-early 1910s, the precarious labour of traveling film shows in the public gardens and variety halls of the seaside towns of Broadstairs, Margate and Ramsgate led to the development of film only spaces. Since the late 2000s the area has, once again largely in the absence of cinemas, returned to one in which it is the precarious labour of individual entrepreneurs creating the single screen spaces for film. Drawing on Gabriel Menotti’s description of film curation as ‘a matrix of reproductive labour tasked with the maintenance of media practices and institutions’ [1], I will explore how the labour of the ‘all in one’ worker does this in part as investment in local people and place.\n\nFilm exhibition is part of my research into the neighbouring towns’ linked histories of film, cinema and tourism/heritage, initially focusing on a definitive chronological industrial and social mapping including oral history interviews. I am co-owner of the last remaining cinema in the three towns and plan to incorporate grounded theory analytic strategies in an autoethnographic approach to provide insight into labour practices past and future.\n\n[1] Gonring, G.

Pathaan, however, went on to create Indian cinema history by being the first Hindi film to surpass the ₹1,000 crore mark (around £97m) from national and global box office returns. Audiences up and down the country danced in their seats, in the aisles, and in front of the projection screen when songs played from the film.\n\nDancing in the cinema halls in India and beyond is not new, but these seemed special. The dancing in auditoriums was shared on social media and made viral quickly, leading to other national and international audiences dancing in theatres. Could it be that these are ‘A’ dance, an important dance of declaration, a public dance in the cinema, in the streets of culture as a joyous two fingers of victory to those who tried to ban or boycott the film? Could it be that India's contemporary social conservativism needed SRK more than ever?\n\nThis paper will explore such questions by considering the dancing Bollywood cinema audience methodologically. How might we usefully make sense of such an audience in media and cultural studies, not least as Bollywood audiences whom western observers have historically seen as simply chasing after escapist fare? How can we also think about an audience that is simultaneously present in the theatre and online?\n\nBio:\n\nDr Rajinder Dudrah is Professor of Cultural Studies and Creative Industries at Birmingham City University.

Many among Instagram’s 332.2 million Indian userbase are not only consumers but are also content creators vying to enter the influencer marketplace in the country. As my examples will show, many reels feature users dancing and lip syncing to popular songs from Bollywood and other mainstream film music in India.\n\nAs more and more users join this fluid space of ‘the creator consumer’ in India, coupled with the aggressive boom in the number of internet users, we see an interesting comingling of “networked individualism” and “strategic self-commodification” (Shifman, 2014). Users are simultaneously part of a community of virtually networked media consumers and distributors while eagerly finding ways to express their own individuality and devising ways to commodify their cultural expression, underpinned by a proclivity to create and be in turn distributed by others in the digital space. This is what scholars have called “prosumer culture” in digital capitalism.\n\nIn Indian prosumer culture, media—especially film music—circulate both nationally and transnationally and find a multitude of forms, from aesthetic expression to political commentary. This paper looks at instances of “produsage\" in Indian cyberspace to explore issues of digital labour in the era of platform capitalism. It seeks to interpret spontaneous expressions of networked digital labour methodologically to understand how media production has become a key aspect of media consumption in contemporary internet culture.\n\nBio:\n\nDr Souraj Dutta is a postdoctoral fellow at Birmingham City University, working in the Birmingham Centre for Media and Cultural Research within Arts, Design and Media.

In this context, a focus is often placed on horror filmmakers, and the role of critics and programmers is perhaps under-explored.\n\nWhile more recently it appears that women horror critics and commentators are the subject of increasing visibility, the same does not seem true of programmers or festival organisers. This session will offer an industrial and personal presentation on the role of women in horror film festivals and events, particularly in the UK.\n\nThe perspective on offer in this session will be one of first-hand experience. As well as being part of the organisational team of Abertoir Horror Festival for around 15 years, in 2010 I organised a screening event for the first ‘Women in Horror Recognition Month’ – potentially the first of its kind in the UK.\n\nThis presentation will outline some history of women horror programmers and their contributions to the development of horror festivals in the UK, and offer examples of the, at times, unseen labour of festival planning. By its nature, this will also include a personal account of the ways in which that labour can, at times, be specifically gendered.\n\nWith horror festivals in the UK primarily being organised by volunteers, this presentation will highlight the seemingly invisible labour put into events which form a core part of horror film culture in the UK.\n\nBio:\n\nDr. Nia Edwards-Behi (independent) is co-director of Abertoir Horror Festival.

As he argues, despite the sustained focus on the importance of the monster, the victim and their relations to gender in horror film studies, little attention has been paid to how ‘the process of acting’ and the ‘actor’s skills and abilities’ work to produce ‘expressions of fear and terror’ which are essential to the emotional impact of key characters and films throughout the genre’s history (2004: 150). Furthermore, and as he notes, such consideration of acting is also key to establishing a more nuanced understanding and appreciation of the representation of female characters within horror, beyond simply equating them with passivity and activity. In order to build on Hutchings’ insightful arguments, this chapter will focus on the central importance of Jamie Lee Curtis’ performance to the Halloween franchise, and to the continued development of her character, Laurie Strode. In particular, it will map and explore Curtis’ performance across the recent David Gordon Green-directed trilogy Halloween (2018), Halloween Kills (2021) and Halloween Ends (2022). While these films have received a mixed critical reception, the chapter will illustrate how Curtis’ acting choices – relating to her vocal delivery, gaze patterns, facial expression, and physicality – are absolutely central to maintaining and extending Laurie Strode’s status as one of the richest and most fully-realised female characters in modern horror cinema.\n\nBio:\n\nKate Egan is the author of Trash or Treasure?

Hobson’s status as a fashion icon led to her collaborating with O’Neill as Picturegoer’s fashion advisor. My paper conducts close analysis of a selection of the articles published between 1949 and 1950 to examine how the fan magazine functioned as a vital tool in promoting the stardom of Hobson. My analysis considers what O’Neill’s articles reveal about Hobson’s agency and star labour, both through the role of Hobson in the fan magazine herself, and through what the articles reveal about her hidden labour on film sets. I offer a comparative analysis with an article in American fan magazine Photoplay to consider the reception of Hobson’s stardom and form of British glamour in both America and the UK.\n\nMy research builds on film history, star theory, gender politics and archival research to shed light on a hugely popular British star of the 1940s who has received little scholarly attention, examining and discussing fan magazine articles that have not been previously written about. In my examination of Hobson’s stardom, I offer an insight into the gendered aspects of stardom and the agency and labour of the star herself.\n\nBio:\n\nJade Evans is an AHRC funded PhD candidate researching the creation, promotion and exportation of British film stars between 1920 and 1970.

Sexual harassment, bullying, systemic bias, work precarity, long hours and inequitable pay are relatively unregulated, providing a working environment no other industry would tolerate. A preponderance of studies in the last few years have shown the UK television industry to be a ‘hotspot’ for wellbeing issues, leading to over half of industry workers reporting wanting to leave the industry and many contemplating suicide due to these problems. Covid has exacerbated these pre-existing issues, which have produced a revolving door of talent in the industry.\n\nWhilst report after report surfaces outlining the problems, my project investigates solutions from a managerial point of view, utilising interviews from industry professionals, particularly leaders who can speak to the barriers they face in improving wellbeing for employees. It will also draw upon case studies of production companies and networks that provide a nurturing work environment, resulting in more creativity and higher profits as products of better wellbeing. Industry initiatives intended to address these well-known problems tend to be reactive, treating instances of these problems as anomalies. However, researchers claim the problems are systemic. What is it about the structure of television production that itself creates these problems and what solutions can be implemented to responsibly address and prevent them from happening in the first place?\n\nBio:\n\nTeale Failla (she/they) is a PhD candidate in Media Arts, funded by Royal Holloway University of London.

Although Romania still falls behind the EU average in life expectancy (Sala 2020), the elderly stand as the most prevalent subjects of the healthcare system – framing healthcare work as a ‘labour of age.’ At the same time, retired patients are struggling to pay for necessary healthcare services (Olaru 2013) and there is a traceable dissatisfaction towards these services among the population (Popa et al. 2017), articulated not only in surveys but in national scandals, as well. By analysing two hospital-based Romanian New Wave films featuring patients in their 60s – Cristi Puiu’s The Death of Mr. Lăzărescu (Moartea domnului Lăzărescu, 2005) and Adrian Sitaru’s Best Intentions (Din dragoste cu cele mai bune intenții, 2011) – this paper aims to explore how (older) age relates to the reliability of healthcare services. As a ‘reaction piece’ to Puiu’s film – which heavily criticized the Romanian health care system through an elderly pensioner protagonist, labelled by medical care workers as societal waste – Sitaru’s film seemingly contradicts the former film’s view with an overprotective and paranoid son, who fears that her hospitalized mother might not receive the best treatment, even if reality suggests otherwise. Regardless of the more optimistic tone of Best Intentions, both films seem to posit retirement age as a dangerous liability even within the very s"
