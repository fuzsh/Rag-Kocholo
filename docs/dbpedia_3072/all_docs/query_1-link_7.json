        "text": "OK, thanks for clearing that ^ up.\n\nI remember thinking one matches up with the shots where Tornado is usually turned around, and then begins his run.\n\nThen there is usually an exterior shot for him exiting.\n\nIs that the second cave?\n\nDo you have any captures showing Zorro there? Or vid grab which shows where each was used?\n\nI started studying Zorro's Cave in 2014-2015 when I first heard of it, and even now I learn new things, including some things I found out this very month.\n\nPlease share anything else you got.\n\nAnd I haven't realized I had been answered by you until today. Given that my message was quoting a 2015 message, I didn't expect to receive an answer at all.\n\nI also didn't expect to post here again, but you are right that this thread deserves some love! .\n\nHey, it was Guy Armando Catalano's b-day, I had to look up the thread.\n\nTo my happy surprise it had been active.\n\nYou mentioned McCulley's pulps, but I know very little of them, since they are really hard to find online, except the first and maby the second story. If you read them, can you explain to me how many retcons McCulley did to his first story, which ended with Zorro publicy unmasking and Diego about to marry Lolita? I heard that Ramon is still alive in the second story and later story have Zorro's identity still a secret, is it true? Did Diego and Lolita eventually marry in some story, did they remain perpetual fiances, or did she eventually die or just disappear from the stories? And does Diego still bother with wearing the Zorro costume in the stories in which his identity is known by everybody?\n\nAlso, does the evil commandante remain the same, or do they change regualrly? And after which point the stories became standalone, if they did? How many people know about Zorro's identity after the retcon? How many characters from \"The Curse of Capistrano\" became recurring characters in later stories, and how many characters introduced in later stories became recurring characters?\n\nDid Sergeant Garcia appear in McCulley's stories before appearing in the Disney series? And how many plots of the Disney series were taken from McCulley's stories? Did Diego's name change from \"Vega\" to \"de la Vega\" in McCulley's stories before the Disney series premiered? What role has Bernardo in later stories?\n\nDid McCulley eventually adopt the costume used in the Fairbanks movie rather than the sombrero and full-face mask, and did he ever incorporate the secret passage gimmick also introduced by Fairbanks into his tales? And do you know other bits of trivia about McCulley's Zorro stories that would be interesting and/or surprising to people who have only read \"The Curse of Capistrano\" and mainly know the Zorro of the movies and the various tv series?\n\nThat's a lot of questions! I guess this topic has the potential to go on for a while.\n\nLOL, that is allot of questions. It's been a few years since I read them, so going from what I remember, You really do need to read McCulley for yourself, cause me breaking them down in trying to answer, doesn't do them justice.\n\nSpoiler:\n\nThe retcons?\n\nCurse of Capistrano, published in novel form as Mark of Zorro after Fairbanks film, was obviously written as a one-off story with a definitive reveal and end.\n\nWith the success of the Fairbanks movie, McCulley was thankfully compelled to keep the character and stories going.\n\nCaptain Ramón is run through the heart in Curse/Mark, does he actually die? We are told Zorro leaves him for dead, yet he is still twitching when he leaves.\n\nSo that does leave room for him to have survived.\n\nAnd he does, yes Captain Ramón is revealed to be the villain of in Further Adventures.\n\nIn a great scene where the mysterious new villain pulls off his hood, out of the shadow you see on his face the horrible mark of Zorro, (like the Joker) scared for life across his face, you realize he survived! He blames Zorro, and has become obsessed with destroying him.\n\nHe is however killed by the end of Further Adventures, It's important to know, he, his garrison, the past Governor and many who knew Diego was Zorro have been run out of town.\n\nDiego's identity reveal, isn't so much retconed away, McCulley in the sequels actually acknowledges and makes it part of the story. He in fact explores the effects of Don Diego losing his secret ID.\n\nIn Further Adventures - With the villain defeated and his identity outed, Zorro and sword are retired.\n\nHe and the Dons who know his secret life (yes, they saw him pull off the mask, this is still canon), now fear that without the \"real\" identity, without the call to adventure, and a cause to spur him on, he'll become the languid, disinterested persona he once invented to throw off the enemy.\n\nWhen the city is attacked by pirates, and his fiance (Lolita from Mark) is kidnapped, it calls him back to action once again!\n\nDiego is dead, and his real self; Zorro is born again!\n\nBut it is not as disguise this time, as people know him, but as a way to channel his real inner strength, he needs it, he retakes the fox \"identity\" and sword!\n\nWe learn these Pirates who sacked the city, and kidnapped his fiance, are hired guns, by non-other than Captain Ramón.\n\nIn the next story - Zorro Rides Again - the identity reveal, is again acknowledged by McCulley (it is not retconed away) it is again referenced and the fact is exploited in story by his ememies.\n\nWith Ramon and his garrison gone, a new Comandante who only knows Zorro and Vega stories second hand, therefore only suspects he is Zorro, he needs proof, and the Dons who helped him in Curse/Mask are not willing to give up their friend. Hoping to out him and ruin Diego Vega, the Comandante has someone disguises himself as Zorro, and begin a campaign of terror and murder against the people Zorro once protected.\n\nNow knowing who Zorro is and defending him has becomes a liability. To clear his name Diego must don the mask, sword and identity again, now there are two Zorros. He sews confusion, fights his way to exposing the fake, clearing both his Vega name and convincing the new Comandante he is not Zorro.\n\nThat the real one is still out there.\n\nThis of course sets up, for all the ongoing stories, that there is still a mystery Zorro out there, it could be anyone?\n\nAgain except those closest to him, they are never again sure if it's the retired Vega who came out of hiding , or not.\n\nThe game of deception, at which he excels, is to continuously mislead, and prove it wasn't him.\n\nAs new Comandantes come and go, the legend and mystery spreads, enemies are vanquished, people who knew him come and go, and only rumors remain.\n\nThe truth becomes \"blurred\", and the mystery and legend persists. It is in this context that most the later stories unfold.\n\nAs to recurring characters.\n\nLolita they are married, but she does eventually die.\n\nFray Felipe reappears.\n\nBernardo importance comes and goes.\n\nThere is another Native American Jose of the Cocopahs, actually much more interesting, him and his tribe becomes an ongoing friend and allies who rides with him, before there was Tonto.\n\nAlso a (somewhat reformed) Pirate Bardoso, who started as his enemy and becomes an ally.\n\nThe big boastful Gonzales of Mark, is eventually replaced by Garcia, the Garcia for the Disney series is somewhat a hybrid of the two.\n\nTo be continued....\n\nNOTE: THIS MESSAGE CONTAINS SOME MISTAKES, AS I WRONGLY CLAIM THAT THE BACK ENTRANCE OF THE CAVE SHOWN IN EPISODE 2 HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH A SOUNDSTAGE CAVE IN SOME SCENES. THESE MISTAKES WERE CORRECTED IN THIS MESSAGE FROM SEPTEMBER 2018.\n\nOK, thanks for clearing that ^ up.\n\nIt was a pleasure.\n\nI remember thinking one matches up with the shots where Tornado is usually turned around, and then begins his run.\n\nThen there is usually an exterior shot for him exiting.\n\nIs that the second cave?\n\nDo you have any captures showing Zorro there? Or vid grab which shows where each was used?\n\nPlease share anything else you got.\n\nThis is a video someone uploaded on YouTube back in 2007, and it gave me an idea of how the cave is structured much more than still pictures did (I have never seen the cave in person, and in fact I have never even been to America yet):\n\nThe West entrance to the cave appears at 1:00, and after filming it for a while the person holding the camera enters it and then exits from the East entrance at around 1:28. For a while he films the area around the cave, mostly with the East entrance at his back, then he turns around and we see the East entrance and the area around it from the outside, from 2:09 to 2:17.\n\nThe West entrance is easy to recognize, having the shape of a downward V with a 45-degree diagonal rock on the left and a boulder under it:\n\nThe photo above was taken in 2009, and shortly after that a metal gate was put in front of the West entrance:\n\nThe gate was put by the person who owns the 16 acres or so area on the eastern side of the cave, since Zorro's Cave was often used by people to access his property from the condo area on the western side of the cave. There are still other ways to see the East entrance, and the cave can be accessed from there since that entrance does not have a gate.\n\nThe East entrance can be recognized by the diagonal rock at the left and the two boulders, one on top of another, at the right, and there is a tree right outside the entrance. The picture in the follwing link is particularly useful to compare the two boulders at the right of the screen, while the diagonal rock at the left is mostly outside the frame:\n\nHere is a map of the Lower Iverson Movie Ranch:\n\nAnd here you can see where Zorro's Cave is located:\n\nIt's easy to remember the location, since the condos on the right form a letter Y, and on a map the cave is just under the top right house of the letter Y.\n\nIn 2001, Guy Williams was posthumously given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and people around the world came to the ceremony, which was also attended by most of Zorro's surviving cast, other than Williams' family of course. The group visited some of the scenes were Zorro was shot including Zorro's Cave, under the guide of Steve Stevens who played Rudolfo in an episode. There are a couple of online pages documenting these events.\n\nAnyway, about the way the cave is used in the Disney series, it is important to notice that the only episodes in which orignal footage of the secret cave is shown are episode 1x02 (\"Zorro's Secret Passage\") and episode 1x08 (\"Zorro's Ride Into Terror\"). All other appearances of the secret cave are stock footage from episode 1x02, or from episode 1x08, or from a combination of both. Granted, we see original footage of the secret passages in many episodes, and the underground tunnel leading to the cave (introduced in episode 1x02) is shown again in episode 2x38, in a scene that then becomes stock footage... but like I said, no more original footage of the secret cave itself except for 1x02 and 1x08.\n\nIn episode 1x02, Diego takes Bernardo for a tour of the secret passages. When Diego says \"I though you'd be surpised!\", they are at the end of the underground tunnel, which was filmed in the Disney studio with fake cave walls. Then Tornado's music theme starts, and there is a set switch, covered by a camera cut, and we see the West entrance of Zorro's Cave, with the 45-degree rock at the left and all other markers that allow an easy identification. Look at Diego's ribbon, which is tidy before the cut and moved by the wind in the next scene: this shows that the scenes before and after the cut were shot at different times.\n\nThe scene after the cut is shot from an angle that makes it seem all we see on the screen is inside the cave, while the truth is that the area in front of the 45-degree diagonal rock at the left is outside the cave. But for the purposes of the show it was necessary to show that one end of the cave was connected to the underground tunnel under the hacienda, even though in real life neither end is connected to anything.\n\nWe then cut to the entrance covered by greenery, with a stick to prevent Tornado from escaping. This location seems very similar to the East entrance seen from the inside, as shown in the YouTube video above, but I was told by an Iverson expert that the actual cave is not that large, meaning the location was recreated in the studio. I wonder why did they bother to make it so similar to the real entrance which wouldn't even be shown in any scene, but a strong clue that this is indeed a studio location is Diego's ribbon, which is tidy again. This doesn't necessarily means the scene was shown together with the scene in which he comes out of the tunnel, since Diego's ribbon is tidy most of the time. On the other hand, the scene with the messy ribbon is the only one which was shot at the actual cave, while the scene before it and the one after it were not.\n\nDiego and Bernardo then walk through the greenery and emerge outside:\n\nI can't say for sure if the greenery shots from the inside and from the outside were shot at the same location, but it may be. The Iverson expert doesn't think the outside lcation is the actual East entrance of Zorro's Cave, and I think he is right because I noticed that there wouldn't be the space for all the greenery wall, which is longer in the video than in the two pictures above, and we don't even see where it ends.\n\nLook at this video from film historian Bill Sasser, who died recently:\n\nFrom 6:14 to 6:46 we see Zorro's Cave, and the still image that starts at 6:41 shows that there is no room for the greenery wall to continue at the left of the entrance, especially if you use the following two pictures to get an idea of the measures of the place compared to a human being:\n\nSo, if the greenery scenes above weren't filmed at the actual cave, where were they filmed? Maybe they were filmed at the Disney studio, and indeed this link...\n\nThe Mark of Zorro Johnston McCulley Forge Books @ Books and knowledge\n\n... contains the following message from a certail Jamail:\n\n\"One of the highlights of my life was an employee tour of the Walt Disney Studio when I got to walk up to a bushy outgrowth on the perimeter of the studio property, which turned out to be the area where Zorro was filmed emerging from the cave on Toronado.\"\n\nI tried contacting her for more details, but so far I have been unable to do so. Maybe someone else will know something about these employee tours.\n\nJULY 2019 UPDATE: I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN CONTACTING HER. HERE IS HER ANSWER.\n\nAnyway, after emerging from the greenery Diego and Bernardo come to this place:\n\nThe camera cut covered a set switch: we are at Lower Iverson Movie Ranch again, but the place is over 400 meters away from Zorro's Cave, and the nearest entrance is actually the West entrance. The place is in the Garden of the Gods area, with Old Yeller Tree (which doesn't exist anymore) at the right, Sphinx on the top, and Harum Scarum Cluster in the middle of the image. We can't see Rock Tower because it is covered by Sphinx, but in the background we see the rock formation near Rock Tower. Usually Rock Tower is shown at the left and Sphinx at the right, like this:\n\nA similar shot from a 1936 movie:\n\nThe same area today:\n\nHarum Scarum Cluster from the 1936 movie:\n\nFrom a 1928 movie:\n\nOld Yeller Tree from the 1936 movie:\n\nElvis Presley in front of Harum Scarum Cluster for a promo shot:\n\nHarum Scarum Cluster today, pointing out the rocks behind Elvis:\n\nJohn Payne and Ronald Reagan in front of Harum Scarum Cluster, in the 1955 movie \"Tennessee's Partner\":\n\nHarum Scarum Cluster today, pointing out the rocks behind Payne and Reagan:\n\nBack to Diego and Bernardo: after another camera cut/set switch, they leave the Sphinx/Harum Scarum Cluster/Old Yeller Tree area and are again in front of the greenery, which was probably at the Disney studio. They come back \"inside\", which is a studio shot, then the camera cuts to the West entrance, and Diego's ribbon is messy again, despite the fact that it was still tidy while he was at the fake entrance witht he greenery: another proof of the set switch.\n\nLater in the episode, we see Zorro, which is stuntman Buddy Van Horn, mounting Tornado, turning the horse around, and beginning his run: this is once again the West entrance with the 45-degree diagonal rock at the left, which had already been shown before in the episode and which you correctly identified:\n\nThen there is a wide exterior shot of Zorro and Tornado riding trough the greenery and exiting the cave, and the interesting thing is that this time they used the East entrance of the actual Zorro's Cave (usually referred to as the back entrance, while the West entrance is referred to as the front entrance):\n\nMost night scenes, including this one, were filmed during daylight and then darkened in post-production. However, some later episodes replaying this clip as stock footage showed the same scene taking place during daytime to fit the need of the episode, and other times the scene was darkened but less than in episode 1x02. The picture above is not from 1x02, but from a later episode which shows the same scene without darkening it, and this helps us.\n\nTo mantain continuity with what we saw before, the scene of Zorro riding out of the cave is followed by Zorro riding through the Sphinx/Harum Scarum Cluster/Old Yeller area.\n\nLater near the end of 1x02 we see, for the only time in the series, Zorro riding back to the secret cave, but this scene was darkened even further than the previous one, and without any help fron non-darkened stock footage we barely see what's happening. Still, it's obvious that this is still the East entrance of the actual Zorro's Cave, filmed from the same angle than the previous cave scene.\n\nIn episode 1x08, we see three scenes with close-ups of the greenery outside the cave and three scenes inside the cave. The inside of the cave is clearly a fake cave built in a soundstage, and I'll show below two images of that fake cave:\n\nI'm not 100% sure about the outside scenes, but they were clearly not filmed at Iverson:\n\nTo me, it seems a fake cave wall, and I also think it's different from the greenery outside of the cave clos-ups in episode 1x02. It may be the outside of the fake cave, but what prevents me from being sure is that the greenery when Alejandro come outseems sparse in the inside shot and dense in the outside shot.\n\nEpisodes 1x02 and 1x08 are both on YouTube, so you can check my explanations and see if they seem convincing to you. Please tell me if something was not clear or if you think I made some mistakes.\n\nIn addition to Disney's Zorro, Zorro's Cave had previously been shown as the secret cave of Zorro in the 1944 serial \"Ghost of Zorro\". The inside of the cave was a fake cave built in a soundstage, but for the entrance seen from the outside they used the East entrance of Zorro's Cave. Here the cave doesn't lead to an hacienda or any other place, and there isn't greenery or anything to hide the entrance, which in fact gets discovered at one point. Is it a coincidence that the same rock formation was used for Zorro's secret cave in two different productions? I think so, but I can't prove it. Even before that, the 1939 serial \"Zorro's Fighting Legion\" had the West entrance to Zorro's Cave as the entrance the the bad guy's cave, while the interior of the cave was a fake cave built in a soundstage. Of course, Zorro's Cave is also in many non-Zorro related productions.\n\nTornado's Cave is a different cave on Lower Iverson Movie Ranch, situated near the Lone Ranger Rock:\n\nI don't know why it was named after Zorro's horse since its connection with Zorro is really minimal:\n\n*Zorro's horse, there named El Rey, hide for a few seconds in front of its Noth entrance in the 1937 serial \"Zorro Rides Again\"\n\n*In the 1944 serial \"Zorro's Black Whip\", which actually didn't involve Zoro at all, the entrance to the bad guy's cave is through a fake mine built at the South entrance of Tornado's Cave\n\n.. and that's it. As I said, the cave has virtually no connction to Zorro. It is a small cave, even smaller than Zorro's Cave, and most of the time it was shown from the North entrance because the South entrance was covered by the fake mine entrance, which remained in place for many years even though it was often remodeled.\n\nHere is a video from Jerry Condit that starts by showing Tornado's Cave:\n\nLACC Iverson Location Ranch tour with Jerry Condit\n\nThe clip from Disney's Zorro only serves to show Tornado the horse to the viewers, since it was just mentioned, and of course doesn't mean the secret cave shown in that clip, from episode 1x08, is Tornado's Cave. I think any other Tornado clip not involving a cave would have been less confusing.\n\nIf you are interested in Tornado's Cave and Tornado's Mine, you can read many interesting facts here:\n\nIverson Movie Ranch: Tornado's Cave and the \"phantom limb\"\n\nIverson Movie Ranch: Tornado's Mine: A little-known artifact of the filming era on the Lower Iverson\n\nI'm ending this post here, but I'll answer the rest of your message when I have time.\n\nLOL, that is allot of questions. It's been a few years since I read them, so going from what I remember, You really do need to read McCulley for yourself, cause me breaking them down in trying to answer, doesn't do them justice.\n\nI'd like to do so, but most stories are really hard to find. So, for the time being I'll use your answers to increase my knowledge of McCulley's Zorro stories.\n\nBy the way, how many Zorro's stories by McCulley have you read? And how big would be a single book containing all these stories, compared to, say, a book containing all the Sherlock Holmes stories by Conan Doyle?\n\nSpoiler:\n\nThe retcons?\n\nCurse of Capistrano, published in novel form as Mark of Zorro after Fairbanks film, was obviously written as a one-off story with a definitive reveal and end.\n\nWith the success of the Fairbanks movie, McCulley was thankfully compelled to keep the character and stories going.\n\nCaptain Ramón is run through the heart in Curse/Mark, does he actually die? We are told Zorro leaves him for dead, yet he is still twitching when he leaves.\n\nSo that does leave room for him to have survived.\n\nAnd he does, yes Captain Ramón is revealed to be the villain of in Further Adventures.\n\nIn a great scene where the mysterious new villain pulls off his hood, out of the shadow you see on his face the horrible mark of Zorro, (like the Joker) scared for life across his face, you realize he survived! He blames Zorro, and has become obsessed with destroying him.\n\nHe is however killed by the end of Further Adventures, It's important to know, he, his garrison, the past Governor and many who knew Diego was Zorro have been run out of town.\n\nI'll have to read \"The Curse of Capistrano\" again, but Zorro seemed pretty sure of Ramon's death: it would be really hard for him to mistake scratching someone on the surface of the chest, which one can survive, with running it through the heart, which one can't survive. In \"The Further Adventures of Zorro\", is Zorro surprised that Ramon is still alive?\n\nDiego's identity reveal, isn't so much retconed away, McCulley in the sequels actually acknowledges and makes it part of the story. He in fact explores the effects of Don Diego losing his secret ID.\n\nIn Further Adventures - With the villain defeated and his identity outed, Zorro and sword are retired.\n\nHe and the Dons who know his secret life (yes, they saw him pull off the mask, this is still canon), now fear that without the \"real\" identity, without the call to adventure, and a cause to spur him on, he'll become the languid, disinterested persona he once invented to throw off the enemy.\n\nWhen the city is attacked by pirates, and his fiance (Lolita from Mark) is kidnapped, it calls him back to action once again!\n\nDiego is dead, and his real self; Zorro is born again!\n\nBut it is not as disguise this time, as people know him, but as a way to channel his real inner strength, he needs it, he retakes the fox \"identity\" and sword!\n\nWe learn these Pirates who sacked the city, and kidnapped his fiance, are hired guns, by non-other than Captain Ramón.\n\nIn the next story - Zorro Rides Again - the identity reveal, is again acknowledged by McCulley (it is not retconed away) it is again referenced and the fact is exploited in story by his ememies.\n\nWith Ramon and his garrison gone, a new Comandante who only knows Zorro and Vega stories second hand, therefore only suspects he is Zorro, he needs proof, and the Dons who helped him in Curse/Mask are not willing to give up their friend. Hoping to out him and ruin Diego Vega, the Comandante has someone disguises himself as Zorro, and begin a campaign of terror and murder against the people Zorro once protected.\n\nSo, the new comandante from \"Zorro Rides Again\" knows from second hand sources about Zorro's unmasking, and he is still not convinced that Diego is Zorro? Anyway, if he acts like Diego is the most plausible Zorro suspect then I guess it makes sense, though it's hard to judge the narrative choices of stories I have yet to read.\n\nNow knowing who Zorro is and defending him has becomes a liability. To clear his name Diego must don the mask, sword and identity again, now there are two Zorros. He sews confusion, fights his way to exposing the fake, clearing both his Vega name and convincing the new Comandante he is not Zorro.\n\nThat the real one is still out there.\n\nIf I understand correctly, Diego had to hide until the impostor was defeated: that is an original take on the \"Zorro impostor\" gimmick from later works, in which people attack Zorro whenever they see him, but Diego can walk around freely.\n\nAnyway, if the real Zorro publicly challanged, defeated and unmasked the impostor, how does this prove that the real Zorro is not Diego? Unless he somehow created a fake alibi for when he was confronting the impostor, which would allow Diego to claim the new Zorro is a copycat rather than himself.\n\nThis of course sets up, for all the ongoing stories, that there is still a mystery Zorro out there, it could be anyone?\n\nAgain except those closest to him, they are never again sure if it's the retired Vega who came out of hiding , or not.\n\nThe game of deception, at which he excels, is to continuously mislead, and prove it wasn't him.\n\nSo, in subsequent stories he has to create more fake alibis every time someone suspects the new Zorro is not a copycat but Diego himself? Not sure how I would feel about this strange way to portray a secret identity, but I guess it's the only thing McCulley could do to mantain what happened in the first story.\n\nnew Comandantes come and go\n\nIndeed, I see that this book...\n\nhttps://books.google.it/books?id=d9...epage&q=\"further adventures of zorro\"&f=false\n\n... says the same thing, as it quotes pulpologist Will Murray saying\n\n\"Captain of the local soldiers was a very hazardous job with Zorro around. One man after another took the post only to be scarred and run out by Zorro. Captain Carlos Ortega was a major figure in West, lasting through the first fourteen issues before leaving.\"\n\nOf course, Ortega is also the name of a captain from Disney's Zorro (episodes 1x20, 1x21 and 1x22), who is actually Eagle agent Sancho Fernandez that is impersonating the real Ortega after killing him. One may think it is a coincidence, given that Disney's Ortega is named Juan rather than Carlos, that Ortega is a common Spanish surname, and that McCulley's Ortega wasn't an impersonator now was he part of any Eagle conspiracy. However, I don't think it's a coincidence, but it must be a homage, since the plot of this McCulley short story featuring Ortega...\n\nhttp://www.zorrolegend.com/origin/zorropenscage.html\n\n... is, with few changes, nearly identical to the first half of Disney's Zorro episode 1x21 featuring Ortega. Which is why I asked if there were other cases of borrowed plots.\n\nAs to recurring characters.\n\nLolita they are married, but she does eventually die.\n\nIn which story do they marry? In which story does she die, and of what cause? Did they had children? Does Diego have other love interests in subsequent stories?\n\nFray Felipe reapers.\n\nI guessed so. My memory of him his literary version is that of the friar of Los Angeles, rather than the friar of the San Gabriel Mission as in the Disney series.\n\nBernardo importance comes and goes.\n\nI wonder how Bernardo can play any significant role, given that in the first story we learn that he \"cannot speak or hear, cannot write or read, and have not sense enough to make [his] wants known by the sign language\". Did McCulley revise in any way the character in later stories? If I remember correctly, a Bernardo who could hear was already present in the Fairbanks movies way before the Disney series, though I don't remember if that Bernardo was also pretending to be deaf or not. I also remember Bernardo being big in \"Curse\" rather than being \"the little one\", I think he was a native in McCulley and the Fairbanks moview rather than a Spaniard like in the Disney series.\n\nThere is another Native American Jose of the Cocopahs, actually much more interesting, him and his tribe becomes an ongoing friend and allies who rides with him, before there was Tonto.\n\nAlso a (somewhat reformed) Pirate Bardosa, who started as his enemy and becomes an ally.\n\nThe big boastful Gonzales of Mark, is eventually replaced by Garcia, the Garcia for the Disney series is somewhat a hybrid of the two.\n\nInteresting. Do you know in which stories they made their debut and how often do they appear? I am particularly interested in Garcia given his importance in the Disney series.\n\nAnd in the book I linked above Garcia's first name was said to be Manuel, rather than Demetrio Lopez. Did Gonzales got replaced by Garcia all of a sudden, or did they share some stories?\n\nAnyway, the \"fusion\" of Gonzales and Garcia is somehow testified by the 1990's Japanese Zorro anime, which has a sergeant called Gonzales in some dubs and Garcia in other dubs.\n\nNot sure what this means?\n\nBy standalone stories, I mean stories that can be read in any order, as in an event of a story is not influenced by the story that came before it and doesn't influence the story that comes after it. Were most of McCulley's Zorro stories standalone tales, or did most of them started where the previous story ended, like \"Further Adventures\" did with \"Curse\"?\n\nAgain, this is a misconception, (likely perpetuated by the wording in the wikipedia article, read the stories not wiki)\n\nWell, the good thing about Wikipedia is that if there is an error it can be corrected by anyone. However at the moment I don't feel like editing that bit personally, since I have yet to read the stories in question.\n\nHere he is with two of his proud character creations!\n\nHe looks like a midget among Zorro and Garcia! Of course, it is because Guy Williams was 6'3\" and Henry Calvin was 6'2\", so maybe McCulley was just of average height or slightly below average.\n\nI'm not sure when it was first changed to \"de la\" Vega, I'm also guessing it was first at Disney, which actually makes more sense for the name.\n\nI also like \"de la Vega\" better, but I see that sources differ as to who between McCulley's later stories and the Disney series changed the surname. Hopefully this discussion will clarify the matter once and for all.\n\nDon't think it was really considered as a \"costume\" that seems to be modern superhero-readers convenience projecting backwards onto the character. It was more just black riding gear, attire.\n\nMaybe it wasn't as elaborate as superhero costumes would later be, but I think that when people saw Zorro, they instantly knew it was him rather than a random masked bandit, despite the fact that most bandits also cover their faces to avoid being recognized. Or is my memory wrong about him being recognized as being Zorro?\n\nMcCulley didn't really have to \"adopt\" anything, his description was vague enough, and remained pretty consistent.\n\nWell, in \"The Curse of Capistrano\" Zorro has to raise the bottom of his mask to kiss, eat and drink, so he clearly wasn't wearing the half-face mask introduced by Fairbanks and adopted in most later versions. If McCulley ever had Zorro wearing a half mask (and I said \"if\" because I don't know if he ever did it) then I guess it is correct to say that he \"adopted\" Fairbanks' version of the mask.\n\nHe described Zorro with a \"sombrero\", \"long cloak\" and a \"black mask over his face that effectually concealed his features, and through the two slits in it, his eyes glittered ominously.\"\n\nHe'd reference the gloves as black, shirt etc. as black, and often describe the sword, pistol, dagger, whip going into his belt/sash and scabbard.\n\nWhat type of \"sombrero\" was never described by McCulley, it just means hat in Spanish non-descript, the cover artist to All-Story Weekly interpreted as somewhat a more Mexican style sombrero, as far as I know it was not illustrated inside, while Fairbanks had a more Spanish cordobés style hat, which is what stuck.\n\nYou are right about this point: Wikipedia tells me that \"sombrero\" is actually just a Spanish word for hat, despite the fact that we now only think of a specific hat when hearing the word:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sombrero\n\nI also see that the hat we associate with Zorro is called \"sombrero cordobés\", so it fits the definition of a \"sombrero\":\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sombrero_cordobés\n\nIt's possible that McCulley was thinking about this hat after all. Or maybe he was thinking of a different hat because several different hats have \"sombrero\" in their name. At any rate, I don't think McCulley was thinking about the \"wide-brimmed hat from Mexico\", since it would have been weird from someone living in Spanish California.\n\nAs far as illustrations inside, the mask alternated sometimes following Fairbanks half face in Argosy, and then back to the full mask in West magazine.\n\nBut if we ignore what the illustrators did and only follow what McCulley wrote, did his stories ever mention the half mask? I just found that the text of the fifth Zorro story, \"Zorro Hunts a Jackal\" (1933), can be read online here:\n\nhttp://www.retrogalaxy.com/culture/zorro-hunts-a-jackal/page-04.asp\n\nWell, at one point the text says that \"His black mask covered his entire face\".\n\nThe secret passage while first depicted in Fairbanks, definitely showed up in story, and part of it even ran underground and opened into the Mission/Church in town.\n\nDo you remember which story, or stories, have the secret passage? How is the entrance to the passage described? And does it lead to a barn, like I think it was in the Fairbanks movie, or to a cave like in later versions? I think the first film version in which the secret passage leads to a cave is the serial \"Zorro Rides Again\" (1937).\n\nDamn El Zorro.....you've given me a week's worth of reading in your posts.\n\nI'll take it as a compliment.\n\nGreat research and post El Zorro.\n\nA lot to take in there. Thanks!\n\nIt was a pleasure to publicly share the result of my research.\n\nMaking some gifs of some of the scenes you reference.\n\nWe can appreciate the clever camera angle that makes it seem like the 45-degree rock is just in the middle of the cave, while in fact it marks the entrance and everything before it is outside the cave. The shot before the camera cut is also well done, just like the choice of starting Tornado's theme before the cut rather than after it. Too bad there is a blooper about Diego's ribbon on the top part of his clothes which changes at every set switch, but I am pretty sure that virtually nobody noticed it.\n\nActually looks like the background where they emerge is a green-screen or the 1950s equivalent.\n\nIf by \"background\" you mean the Sphinx/Harum Scarum Cluster/Old Yeller area, I thought about the same possibility, since we don't see Diego or Bernardo's feet in that sequence. However, what would be the point of using a green-screen? The Zorro production team was clearly at the site, as shown by this gif you posted in which Zorro rides through the area:\n\nSince the to sequences shows the same angle, I think the two scenes were filmed back to back at the site, one with Guy Williams as Diego and Gene Sheldon as Bernardo, and the other with stuntman Buddy Van Horn as Zorro, so Williams didn't even had to bother changing his clothes. Both scenes were probably filmed during daylight, and the second one was darkened in post-production.\n\nA green-screen would make sense if they wanted to avoid the need to actually get Guy and Gene at Iverson, but we know it's not the case since in both episode 2 and episode 3 we see many scenes filmed at Iveron in which Guy and Gene appear, not just the cave scenes, so they actually went there. A green-screen would be useful to create some speacial effects or facilitate some stunts, but this is not the case.\n\nI guess the shooting schedule has all the answers, but it was never released publicy, though it seems the author of \"The Zorro Television Companion: A Critical Appreciation\" has seen it. I don't have the book, I just read the few lines of the ebook that are available online.\n\nWow that is dark, will look for the not-darkened \"daytime\" shot.\n\nNot sure from which episode that non-darkened screenshot came from, since I copied it from a website rather than capturing it personally. Anyway, a good non-darkened \"daytime\" shot is in episode 2x18, and I see that the French video has better quality compared to the English video, since it is at 480p:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtikEeBDnEo\n\nMinute 13:02.\n\nI'll close with two questions:\n\n*In addition to being set during the Spanish-era California (17691821) and not before the foundation of the Los Angeles pueblo in 1781, do McCuelly's stories often have years? I only know that \"Zorro Rides Again\" takes place \"...in \"17,\" and \"The Sign of Zorro\" \"...about 1800...\"\n\n*Which is the first story in which Zorro acts as a vigilante rather than just as a \"freedom fighter\" against tyrannical officials?\n\nAwesome more Zorro!\n\nIt'll be a bit before I can get to all that^.\n\nI'd like to do so, but most stories are really hard to find. So, for the time being I'll use your answers to increase my knowledge of McCulley's Zorro stories.\n\nBy the way, how many Zorro's stories by McCulley have you read?\n\nBeen some time, but so far I've read:\n\n-The Curse of Capistrano collected in novel form as The Mark of Zorro\n\n-The Further Adventures of Zorro\n\n-Zorro Rides Again\n\nAll originally serialized and later collected in Novel form.\n\nPlus from Zorro: The Masters Edition Volume 1\n\n-Zorro Saves a Friend\n\n-Zorro Hunts A Jackal\n\n-Zorro Deals With Treason\n\n-Mysterious Don Miguel (part 1 & 2)\n\n-Zorro Draws His Blade\n\n-Zorro Upsets a Plot\n\nAnd a few more from Masters Edition Volume 2\n\nNowhere near conclusive, so keep in mind I'm only answering from what I've read.\n\nI'll have to read \"The Curse of Capistrano\" again, but Zorro seemed pretty sure of Ramon's death: it would be really hard for him to mistake scratching someone on the surface of the chest, which one can survive, with running it through the heart, which one can't survive. In \"The Further Adventures of Zorro\", is Zorro surprised that Ramon is still alive?\n\nLike I said; Zorro believed he ran Captain Ramón through the heart, ....yet he survived. you do have to role with it. Although it seems you are more determined to be unsatisfied with it , even though you haven't read it.\n\nHe didn't \"mistake scratching someone on the surface\", that's completely your invention. He and the reader are to assume Ramón will die. There is no doubt about it in Curse/Mark.\n\nReading Further adventures, and discovering he lived, I quickly opened Curse/Mask again, to see if it allowed for it? And it does, Zorro never actually sees him die.\n\nHe leaves Captain Ramón still alive and twitching.\n\nIs it hard to believe he could survive? Certainly.\n\nYet he does, that's the character reveal and a surprise pay-off of Further Adventures! Maybe not for you as you were told it second hand as a spoiler, but for me reading it as a surprise, as he walks out of the shadow and pulls off his hood to reveal the horrible mark on his face, you realize who it is, and his continued obsession with ruining Diego as it plays out, all works great!\n\nFurther you realize the Governor benefits from allowing Zorro and everyone to have believed Ramón had been killed, it actually ads to his evil machinations, that he would keep his survival a secret.\n\nSo, the new comandante from \"Zorro Rides Again\" knows from second hand sources about Zorro's unmasking, and he is still not convinced that Diego is Zorro?\n\nI said he has to prove it, that is not so easy.\n\nMany who know Diego's secret, have reason to protect him. Others never believed to begin with, Further it's not so easy to convict a Don. someone of stature without proof.\n\nLater officers who come and go, are out to prove Diego is Zorro based on past suspicions too. Many stories describe how the enemies try to trap Diego/Zorro, some try to prove he is Diego, and how Don Diego/Zorro brilliantly outwits them. This become a recurring plot.\n\nSo, in subsequent stories he has to create more fake alibis every time someone suspects the new Zorro is not a copycat but Diego himself? Not sure how I would feel about this strange way to portray a secret identity, but I guess it's the only thing McCulley could do to maintain what happened in the first story.\n\nNot really, not sure how you came to that, or what you are suggesting?\n\nThe \"Copycat\" Zorro was caught and unmasked.\n\nThe real Zorro rides again!\n\nhe has to create more fake alibis every time...\n\nEvery time? No, not always, but that is a common means of deception, if he can convince them obviously he can't be at two places at once. It is a trick he uses, and it works!\n\nThe story you site bellow Zorro Hunts a Jackal is a great example where he uses Gonzalez as an unwitting alibi, who then believes (and will likely swear) he was with Diego the whole time . It's pretty hysterical!\n\nAlso not all stories are just about a Comandante trying to prove Diego is Zorro.\n\n.\n\nYou seem to be making allot of assumptions, are you determined to put a more negative and incredulous spin on everything?\n\nNot sure why? These stories are supposed to be fun! I mean sometimes they are convinced by a fake wart!\n\nNot trying convince you to like something you seem determined to be unsatisfied with.\n\nJust sharing what I read of the stories.\n\nOf course, Ortega is also the name of a captain from Disney's Zorro (episodes 1x20, 1x21 and 1x22), who is actually Eagle agent Sancho Fernandez that is impersonating the real Ortega after killing him. One may think it is a coincidence, given that Disney's Ortega is named Juan rather than Carlos, that Ortega is a common Spanish surname, and that McCulley's Ortega wasn't an impersonator now was he part of any Eagle conspiracy. However, I don't think it's a coincidence, but it must be a homage, since the plot of this McCulley short story featuring Ortega...\n\nElements were likely drawn from several McCulley stories, as I indicated McCully was brought on as writing consultant. I don't think the long running Eagle story-line was a direct recreation of any one McCulley story though, but like I said I haven't read them all.\n\n(Another fun publicity image, exploring the character)\n\nI wonder how Bernardo can play any significant role, given that in the first story we learn that...[he has] not sense enough to make [his] wants known by the sign language\".\n\nThat's a pretty harsh description. Bernardo was never really the most significant character as you suggest, or the main focus of any story, it's Disney who played him up and made him more central.\n\nAs far as Zorro's more well developed allies, in Curse it's actually the Don's who become his biggest allies. This was further played up in Zorro's fighting Legion.\n\nAnd later better developed and a more interesting ally characters than Bernardo, were like I said actually Jose of the Cocopah a large Native American chief and ally, whose tribe Diego has a strong bond with, and is counted a blood brother. And reformed one-eyed, cutlass wielding pirate named Bardoso, who often acted as spy among outlaws, cutthroats and scalawags.\n\nAnd sometimes Fray Felipe.\n\nThese, are actually in some stories I've read more fun and better developed characters as allies, than Bernardo ever was.\n\nSadly later media, have chosen to ignore them, and most haven't even heard of them, particularly Jose and Bardoso, who together with Zorro actually make a great trio!\n\nHere is an illustration by me^ As far as I know they've never been illustrated (until now )\n\nDid McCulley revise in any way the character in later stories? If I remember correctly, a Bernardo who could hear was already present in the Fairbanks movies way before the Disney series, though I don't remember if that Bernardo was also pretending to be deaf or not. I also remember Bernardo being big in \"Curse\" rather than being \"the little one\", I think he was a native in McCulley and the Fairbanks moview rather than a Spaniard like in the Disney series.\n\nHe was definitely Native American in McCulley. Although he was not nearly as involved as in the Disney version, who really reimagined the character for themselves, as more actively involved, and casting him as European.\n\nGene Sheldon definitely brought great spirit and whimsy to the character and had great fun with the expressive pantomime which was not in McCulley as you suggest. There is no reason a Native American actor couldn't have done the same. Although it's probably for the best Disney re-imagined Bernado as European, as it would likely have read as insensitive, to outright offensive to some.\n\nI do love Gene Sheldon's fun take.\n\nBut in McCulley Jose was the more active ally. Eg. scenes where he'd need someone else disguised as Zorro to throw-off pursuers, it would be Jose, he'd also actively engage the villains, and was a hero in his own right.\n\nInteresting. Do you know in which stories they made their debut and how often do they appear? I am particularly interested in Garcia given his importance in the Disney series.\n\nI'll have to look it up, there was a Don Esteban Garcia who first showed up in Rides again, although he was more analogous to the Ramon/Monastario types, another Garcia showed up several stories later, may have been visiting from another Presidio, or it was actually Diego traveling abroad. These (along with elements of Gonzalez) may have been amalgamated into one for the Disney series.\n\nFray Felipe was introduced in Curse/Mask.\n\nThe pirate Barbados was introduced in Further Adventures, in the end he allies himself with Zorro, in Rides again we meet the Pirate Bardoso, a reformed pirate, now with an eye-patch. Are they the same? I would assume they are, eventually the name Bardoso is what stuck.\n\nJose of the Cocopah was first introduced in Rides again.\n\nBy standalone stories, I mean stories that can be read in any order, as in an event of a story is not influenced by the story that came before it and doesn't influence the story that comes after it. Were most of McCulley's Zorro stories standalone tales, or did most of them started where the previous story ended, like \"Further Adventures\" did with \"Curse\"?\n\nCurse/Mark, Further Adventures & Rides again, were all published as individual chapters serials monthly, later collected as Novels.\n\nThey were definitely to be read as sequels and made reference to what came before. Later stories tended to be more stand alone, done in one (that's why I don't think the long running Eagle story line was a direct remake from any one of those, but some elements may have been.), the stand alone shorts could be read alone, (Again the Jackal story you site is a good example) yet still often made references to previous stories and characters."
