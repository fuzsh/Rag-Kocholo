It would be difficult to say whither this euphemism derived. Spies, even in the most ancient of texts, have always been their of a faces In until some\n\ndepicted as lurking in the shadows, often in the rain, heads covered with a large brimmed hat or the drapings cowl, collars turned up against the wind hiding their (except for the eyes). ‘ motion pictures, the “‘spy’’ sometimes goes unnoticed, he moves. If he steps out, suddenly appearing before supreme hunter from the enemy secret police, it would\n\nall be over quickly. The knife would flash and the agent of the tyrant would be dispatched. This would permit the spy to escape to safety with the vital information he had purloined. Several things need to be pointed out from the above scenario: The ‘“‘good spy’’ would necessarily have to be wearing some sort of cloak and have in his possession a dagger. He would hide in the shadows in order to elude pursuit and set up an ambush. The ‘“‘good spy’? would accomplish his mission nonviolently and act in “self-defense”? because he could not escape otherwise. If a spy is really good, his presence is never known. He is humble because he knows that to attract attention to himself is to invite disaster.\n\nvi\n\nNinja Cloak and Dagger\n\nvi\n\nAnd if, at some time in his life, he finds it necessary to engage in espionage activities, he would know that any engagement, for however noble the mission, must necessarily create enemies. And many of these enemies survive. And some hold grudges. Shakespeare has said that a man in his time may play many parts, and psychologists have said that the personality is completely different every seven years. The Ninja have a name for this phenomenon—aging. There are stages through which every human must pass, physically and mentally. If one is lucky, one learns the lessons of life and continues to advance toward a greater understanding. This, too, is taught in ninjitsu. It takes a special kind of person to be a spy including such activities as grace under fire and subtlety. Not many can do it; not many want to. “It is easy to die in battle, with the blood singing in the veins, surrounded by comrades,” said one hero. “‘But slowly. over days of torture, it makes one shiver.”’ And that was often the fate of spies. But a Ninja is uniquely qualified. When a Ninja participated in espionage activities, he did so with all of the skill and cunning that had made the Ninja mystics and showed only the side which was warrior. Because the Ninja knew that fear magnified every experience and that tales grew in the telling, he terrorized the enemy. Propaganda, disinformation, etc., all depend on an understanding of human nature. Therefore the Ninja used psychology as well as technology to defeat the opponent. Being imminently practical, the Ninja devised many systems of fighting with unorthodox weapons, and logic would dictate. As a spy, he would experiment with the tools of the trade—the cloak and dagger. What followed was a set of eighty-one techniques based upon using the cape as a shield, rope, or net. Herein we have presented eighteen. Of course, fighting with a knife was a common enough skill in the age when the Japanese Ninja flourished. Consequently, the Ninja studied with the most viciotis and successful knife wielders and developed a set of techniques which were quite effective. He employed both the underhand and\n\nvil\n\nPreface\n\nvii\n\nice-pick grips just for balance and practiced with a short sword. In addition to having the best technique, the Ninja also had a slightly longer reach and weapon. The Hsiao Chein Do practice form is included here in Ninja Cloak and Dagger. A section on cryptography is also included here since it is an excellent way to train the mind to develop the memory, as well as a method of transmitting secret messages to one’s confederates. Striking at the sentry while he sleeps is described since this is the most effective way for a single agent to disrupt an entire army, at least temporarily. For this reason, the Ninja were known as the Invisible Assassins, when in actuality they were merely using one of the oldest principles of military strategy. These principles, which predate even Clauswitz and Sun Tzu in their studies of strategy and tactics, are from the most ancient School of the Pole Star, a tribe known to exist in prehistoric China. The\n\nNinja. Looked\n\nfor, they cannot\n\nbe seen; listened for,\n\nthey cannot be heard; felt for, they cannot be touched. It has been said the Ninja could walk through walls. This was not said by the Ninja, but the Ninja has done nothing to dispute the attribution of his power. Acting unseen makes it appear that all things are advancing as they should. And, since the Ninja is in harmony with Nature, in all probability, they are.\n\nO)\n\nIntroduction It should be remembered that military secrets are the most fleeting of all; even more fleeting than glory. Therefore, in deference to Nathan Hale and others who have valiantly sacrificed their lives in the service of their country, it is important to note that the Ninja had no such qualms about surviving. Tales are often told of agents sacrificing themselves upon capture by means of seppuku or hara-kiri (literally, ritual suicide). This ‘“‘never be taken alive’ attitude was of some value in ancient times. Saving one’s family from dishonor, or sharing the slow torture spies were subjected to are indeed noble qualities. But in this day and age, events move so quickly and the web of intrigue—the fabric of the espionage establishment—is so fluid that information which is vital today is useless tomorrow. Therefore, since deals are sometimes ‘“‘cut’? between warring factions and since agents are sometimes “‘sacrificed” to validate some information to the enemy. or to, repay old debts or create new ones, it behooves the agent in the field to come back from the assignment—if not merely to collect his fee, then to guarantee his own safety. Therefore, we have omitted from this text those methods whereby such death or disfigurement may be accomplished, although these are well known and documented from ancient times. We have instead included the meditation technique of\n\n1\n\nINO)\n\nNinja Cloak and Dagger\n\nthe Black Dragon Society, which permits the consciousness to withdraw into the body. Thus, one is able to withstand torture and brainwashing or appear comatose, if need be.\n\nCHAPTER\n\n|\n\n@\n\nHistory During the feudal era of Japan, with its constantly warring lords and clan rivalries, no single breed of men wreaked more havoc or spawned more terror than the mysterious hordes of the Ninja. The tales regarding these medieval espionage\n\nmasterminds, who wore black from head to toe, appeared relentlessly across the pages of Japanese history from the thirteenth through the seventeenth centuries. The basis for their incredible feats of skill and daring were first elaborated in the Chinese classic, The Art of War, in which the author, Sun Tzu, advised, “send your spies and mercenaries far ahead of the army proper, that they might\n\ncreate\n\nunrest,\n\nconfusion,\n\nand\n\nfear among\n\nthe enemy.”\n\nIn\n\nthis regard, the Ninja were, and are today, without peer.\n\nSo powerful did the clans become, that in 1581 the warlord Nobunga Oda led an expeditionary force of over 46,000 men against the 4,000 Ninja of the Iga prefecture, destroying their power and the line of ascension. But it was not until the seventeenth century that the Tokugawa Shogun banned the practice of the Ninja art or its mention under penalty of death. This action, as well as the infamous “sword hunts,” and the summary execution of every man, woman, and child of the most notorious and feared Koga clan set a seal of secrecy on the occult practices of ninjitsu which persists to this day. > ve\n\n4\n\nNinja Cloak and Dagger\n\n4 A\n\nfew\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nKoga\n\nalso\n\nsurvived.\n\nTheir\n\ndescendants,\n\nthough few in number, maintain their art beneath a cloak of the utmost secrecy; and caring little for the whims of capricious fate or the laws of lesser men, they are seldom seen or known. The teachings of these ‘“‘Lost Clans’? make them warriors without equal, coming from nowhere; their means and motives are scarcely known and are spoken of only in the most subdued of whispers—if at all. They prefer the isolated areas of the globe, far from the curious who would distort or misuse the ancient knowledge and arcane arts for selfish or petty motives. They are beyond that; and it is this lack of attachment to material possessions and to the aggrandizement of personal ego that make them superior and worthy of emulation. From time to time, they may appear or take part in the activities of the world of men, but not taking credit and forgetting all thoughts of reward or fame, they are rarely acknowledged. This is the true Art of Invisibility. In this context, one should take note of the following old Ninja saying: “The wind stirs the surface of the lake, thus the effects of the unseen upon the visible are manifest.”\n\nCHB bay AU ee O\n\nThe\n\nMission\n\nThe primary work of the Ninja is espionage. Webster defines espionage as “‘the practice of spying on others; the systematic use of spies by a government to discover the political and military secrets of other nations.” The Ninja is admirably equipped to fulfill this function due to his highly developed physical and mental abilities. In fact, it is the agent’s skill at gathering intelligence which determines the chances of his survival in the highly competitive and ruthless world of international intrigue. It is sometimes said that for the professional soldier life falls into one of two categories: fighting and getting ready to fight. Likewise, with the Ninja. When not actively in the field, agents spend most of their time in preparation. This effort may be classified into five basic divisions. Striving for the perfection of character refers not only to the study of ‘‘cover identity”’ and the development of skills which enable one to blend with dissimilar types of people as well as natural surroundings, but also to the honing and polishing of the moral personality. Fostering the spirit of effort means to encourage others who seek to improve themselves. Fellow agents as well as ordinary folk appreciate such positive reinforcement. Looking for the good and praising it also gives one a pleasant outlook and gentle disposition. This is generally to be desired\n\n)\n\n6\n\nNinja Cloak and Dagger\n\n6\n\namong civilized people, as it leads to peace and harmony; it is conducive to making and keeping friends. Defending the paths of truth is often most difficult and frequently leads the Ninja into confrontation. At some stage or other in one’s development, one comes to think he knows the great secret and that “others cannot wait to hear one sing.” The real truth to be defended is the right of all free persons to choose their own pathway to understanding. Honoring the principles of etiquette is a hallmark of Ninja behavior. The Sage says, “‘being overly polite elicits no blame.’ Tokugawa said, ‘‘Law is the basis of social order. Reason may be violated in the name of the law, but the law may not be violated in the name of reason.”’ This statement is meant to imply a blind and equal justice for all; in reality, it means that the rules are more important than fairness. The rules of interpersonal relationships vary greatly from nation to nation, but he who yields and treats others with the respect with which he himself would like to be accorded is seldom labeled a troublemaker. He is, instead, usually welcome. Guarding against impetuous courage is part of an overall interlocking set of behaviors which make it possible to live the life of warrior-priest, as do the above-described other divisions. This means guarding against the tendency to fight when struck, holding back from espousing one’s philosophy in the face of those who do not know or care to understand, not interfering in the affairs of others, and leading by setting a good example. These are the activities that occupy the days and nights of the working Ninja.\n\nCLAP ©\n\nRe3\n\nIntelligence Gathering Intelligence gathering means many things to the Ninja. We have spoken previously about the nature of infiltrating the enemy stronghold for the purpose of gathering such information, but little has been said about the nature of that data. Beyond that, there is the connotation of accumulating a body of facts from which to draw conclusions and expound hypotheses, and wanting to learn in order to be of service to one’s fellow man. All are part of the strategy and tactics of the Great Game. For when one man (or a group of men) seeks to impose his will upon others, he will, quite naturally, encounter some resistance. This is due as much to human dislike for change as it is noble missions and causes. The best leaders lead by example; other members of the tribe follow, if for no other reason than to do so is easier than being the leader. If the leader excels, it is because he has superior intelligence. Knowledge is power—knowledge of how to lead armies across terrain, knowledge of how to fight and win. Above all, it is knowledge about the enemy. ‘*Know the enemy as thyself, and in one thousand battles you will be successful,” was the advice of Sun Tzu. For this purpose the leader, or the Ninja acting alone, is dispatched to the hostile territory to gather information that will be of use in preparing or carrying out operations in that area. There may be secondary assignments, such as sabotage, but the pri-\n\n7\n\nS\n\nNinja Cloak and Dagger\n\n8\n\nmary mission is intelligence-gathering. Upon arriving in enemy-held territory, the field agent must ascertain his immediate status and security. In the case of a\n\nchitsumishu, or “friend in the castle,” the local agent responsible for housing and assisting an agent is generally in a good position to provide up-to-the-minute details regarding the agent’s location and the surrounding vicinity. Often such a briefing is expected as a verification of identity, the dispatched agent having been provided with as much information as was available before attempting the infiltration. Depending on the system used, other agents or friendly forces may be indicated as escape routes or sources of intelligence. The ancient Triad method held that no one member should know more than two others. In this way, a large organization would exist, but it would be quite difficult to infiltrate it by counteragents. Of course, such techniques made for some delay in communication, since any word of a meeting had to be passed by word of mouth from one member\n\nto another; but a large gathering could be assembled\n\nwith all the attendants masked. The second type of data gathered should be detailed and confirmed information regarding enemy location and deployment. This should include the names and types of units, recent and military history, nature and number of their weaponry, state of their morale and combat efficiency, customary schedule of activities, methods of transportation and supply, names and histories of their commanding officers (as well as any liaison personnel between civil authorities), and a synopsis of recent events. Next, the assessment of the current standing of the civilian government and its enforcement agencies is crucial. During wartime or similar national emergency, local authorities may restrict the activities of the population by imposing curfew or nationalizing factories or utilities in the surrounding area. Likewise, freedom of speech and press and gatherings of more than a few people may be prohibited. If shortages of foodstuffs, medical supplies, or public assistance exist, rationing may have to be employed (as it was during World War II).\n\n9\n\nIntelligence Gathering\n\n9\n\nPublic reaction to such suppression, repression, or shortages may be of great value in fomenting unrest toward the ruling party or in gaining popular support for local resistance groups and/or guerrilla units operating in the area. The sooner these units can be formed after an occupation, the more likely they are to be effective, since they take advantage of the turbulent conditions and natural resentment to disruption and change to recruit and motivate their forces. The longer an occupation is maintained, the more complacent the general public becomes, gradually accepting the new state of affairs as the status quo. During those periods, resistance and guerrilla teams are usually comprised of the more “hard-core” dedicated individuals willing to endure hardship and risk capture for the cause. The general population may still provide tacit support by not actively participating in the conflict and by their continued antipathy for the occupying forces. Another activity of the Ninja when in enemy-held territory would be to spread dissension and fear among the general population and place blame on the reigning authorities if at all possible. There is an old Gypsy saying that a tale always grows in the telling, meaning that rumors become more elaborate, detailed, and exaggerated as they are repeated by each storyteller. This technique can be used to increase the reports of damage or defeat of unpopular troops, making the audience become bolder against what they then perceive as a not-so-invaluable oppressor. Likewise, tales of atrocities are avidly gobbled up and spread by gossips. Rumors abound during hostilities, and few can be confirmed or denied. Even then, man hears pretty much what he wants to hear, believing what he wants to believe. Even if the stories are only half-heartedly believed, they still conflict with the official reports. Such a situation creates confusion and distrust, since people are much more likely to believe the fabrication of a friend than the truth from an anonymous reporter or bureaucrat. The Ninja, being aware of this principle, never believes ‘‘scuttlebutt.” The saying, “‘believe nothing you hear, and only half of what you see,” indicates the requirement for\n\n10\n\nNinja Cloak and Dagger\n\n10\n\nconfirmation of all incoming data. One requirement of many journalists is that any story must be confirmed by two independent sources. The requirements of law are even more stringent as to the admissibility of evidence. (It is interesting to note that German intelligence during World War II was deceived by a “cardboard army,” whereby fake planes and tanks were made\n\nto appear real, created under the command\n\nof General George S. Patton; so, remember that you need to verify what you think you see.) For\n\nthe\n\nclassical\n\nJapanese\n\nNinja,\n\nthe\n\nnames,\n\naddresses,\n\nand security measures of prominent military leaders and local government and administration officials were the next bit of intelligence to be garnered. Double agents, counterinsurgents, and traitors were all targets for assassination. In some cases such persons were executed in a specific ritualistic manner. Such an act might be the secondary assignment of a field agent and could be used to demoralize the enemy by revealing that a legendary night stalker, able to pass through walls and move unseen among the night shadows, was in the area. This would bring a heightened state of awareness and security which would be allowed to continue until becoming lax again, only to be reawakened by a repetition of the crime or similar demoralizing sabotage. Beyond the confusion and disruption of a massive fire, for example, a secondary effect might be the destruction of enemy foodstuffs which would force the enemy to steal from the people, thereby creating more resentment. By the same token, contamination of food or water supplies can have an equally devastating effect. (After all, no one fights well with dysentery!) In that same context, the health and general well-being of the non-combatants should be protected as much as possible. Consider the popular legends of Zorro or Robin Hood. Such figures, while certainly acting in the best interests of the people, also brought about the eventual decline and destruction of their respective repressive regimes, replacing their rule with justice and fairness. Other targets for sabotage or targets abolit which the Ninja might gather information for incoming forces include military and civilian headquarters, lines of communication\n\nTZ\n\nIntelligence Gathering\n\nJig\n\nand supply, and stockpiles of goods, including ammunition. The Ninja of old were accomplished meteorologists and took into account the seasons, phases of the moon, eclipses, the equinox and solstice, and sunrise in planning an operation. Therefore, the average annual rainfall, methods of irrigation, customary wind direction, ambient air temperature, relative\n\nhumidity,\n\nand\n\nso on,\n\nwere\n\nalso items of interest to\n\nthe infiltrating agent. Likewise, the national crops and exports, rates of exchange, socio-political influences, history of the area of operations, local religious and traditional taboos, and superstitions must be taken into account so that they may best serve the agent in the completion of his mission. The agent may seem awed or even bewildered when wondering at the details of his environment. Fascinated by the smallest detail, like the samurai who pauses to marvel at a flower before going to battle, the Ninja absorbs the experience of a new or strange land as if he were a tourist on vacation. Later, his highly trained mind can replay the visual, aural, and kinesthetic information for detailed analysis. The work of sabotage need neither be totally clandestine nor rely on exotic plastic explosives. The primary consideration should be access. Means, motive, and opportunity are the keys. In olden times, the Ninja made a study of Hoka-no-jitsu, or how to use fire as a weapon. With knowledge of meteorology, the Ninja could predict the course of the wind and therefore use a dry field of grain as an army of fire to attack or defend. Also, by understanding wind currents and architecture, the Ninja was aware of the proper placement of small, slow-burning ember fires that would quickly engulf a dwelling. This was necessary since the use of flammable liquids, except for crude oils used in some lamps of the period, was difficult and untrustworthy. Modern saboteurs have the advantage of gasoline. The Molotov cocktail, which was used during the street riots that accompanied the overthrow of the Czar in Russia, is a simple, effective firebomb capable of taking out a tank. Fill a fragile bottle three-fourths full of gasoline, mix in some\n\nLZ\n\nNinja Cloak and Dagger\n\ny Be:\n\nbits of Styrofoam if available, and plug with a coarse rag, leaving a tail approximately six inches long. Carry by the neck, keeping the strip-fuse dry, until ready to use. Then invert the bottle and let the rag become soaked. Light with a match and throw at the base of the target. When the bottle shatters, the flammable liquid is spread and ignited by the burning wick. The partially dissolved Styrofoam serves to stabilize the gasoline somewhat, but it splatters like napalm on impact. A supply of gasoline may be contaminated with many types of chemicals to slow or impede transportation, thereby contributing to the general unrest. On the individual level, one can disrupt key vehicles or traffic signals, thereby creating traffic jams. In the average motor vehicle, it would be enough to introduce as little as one cup of sugar to a ten-gallon tank. The hydrocarbons of the sugar are combustible, but leave a thick residue inside the cylinders of an engine, thereby rendering it unusable in a short time. If sugar is unavailable, ordinary urine may serve the same function. Another method of disruption that is more immediate involves plugging up a car’s tail pipe. A potato pushed into the exhaust and up the pipe with a short stick forms an effective cork. This prevents exhaust gases from leaving the engine, which changes the pressure inside the cylinders and prevents the pistons from firing. Epsom salts in a car battery will make it run extremely well by altering the saline content of the acid/water mixture inside. The battery will then burn out. Baking soda neutralizes the acid altogether, thereby killing the battery instantly. Be careful when sabotaging a car battery: the chemical reaction with the introduction of the contaminant may be violent, causing the battery to explode and throw corrosive acid everywhere. A little contaminant should be plenty. The disruption of lines of communication may be a matter of critical timing. Like power stations, radio, television, telephone, and telegraph/type facilities are primé targets for attack. If orders cannot be relayed and calls for reinforcements cannot get through, then breaches in the line of\n\na Bey\n\nIntelligence Gathering\n\n135\n\ndefense may not be discovered until too late. The victory can then be won. The psychological sense of isolation that results when communication lines are cut off contributes to the stress of commanders and troops alike. Careful planning is the key here. Any sort of communication line that is accessible can be severed. However, in an emergency, certain lines are given priority attention by authorities; these are usually underground or otherwise vrotected In the old West, American Indians used to confound the Western Union Company by cutting a simple two-strand electric circuit and tying a small strip of rawhide between the break. Linemen, looking for a down wire, often did not see this arrangement the first time around, and repair of the telegraph was therefore delayed. Regarding communication systems, if a field commander cannot verify an official-looking document with the office which issued it, he may assume it to be valid or be unwilling to detain the bearer on his own authority (particularly if his authority is limited). In times of crisis, rumors abound and exaggeration comes easily even to those who should know better. At such times the dissemination of propaganda can be very effective in undermining the confidence of enemy troops. Another means by which public confidence in elected or ruling officials may be eroded is the undermining of the currency. Counterfeiting is the most obvious method, and spies are often equipped with large sums of bogus money with which to pay informants or bribe officials. By the time the funds are widely dispersed, it is difficult to track down the source, a process which takes time and effort which could be otherwise devoted to the war. Even if the funny money is discovered quickly, it causes the officials and the public to mistrust the currency. Rumors of default or government banking troubles are two other means by which currency can be undermined. Devaluing paper certificates—or even suggesting devaluation— may set off a gold rush or runs on banks as investors and savers scramble to salvage what they can. Again, the more public assurances are made, the less they will be believed,\n\n14\n\nNinja Cloak and Dagger\n\n14\n\nthereby only contributing to the confusion. Financial institutions are also symbols of the wealthy and influential, who are mistrusted by the masses. When whipped to a frenzy, even an unarmed crowd can storm most banks. This requires an armed response first by civil authorities and perhaps the military later. Bank robbery is also a method of financing covert operations in enemy territory. Basically, a “tiger” must be stationed at each entrance to capture everyone who enters and to defend the escape routes. He must be armed with fearsome weaponry. Meanwhile, the “‘rats” gather up the money.\n\nCHAPTER @\n\n4\n\nSecret Codes In ninjitsu, the use of codes for the transmission of secret messages has always been of paramount importance. By such methods, the field agent, or “‘genin,”’ could relay information which had been gathered regarding enemy strength, force deployment, and, if discovered, operational plans and pro-\n\ncedures.\n\n.\n\nThe simplest technique in this regard is known as the Substitution Code, whereby one letter in the alphabet is arbitrarily transposed for another. This may be done by the mere “‘scrambling’’ of the twenty-six letters of the alphabet or by a specific “adjustment.” For example: the message “BEWARE” is easily encoded to make the undecipherable ADVZQD by simply writing the letter which appears before each letter in the message (i.e., B becomes A; E becomes D; and so on. Please note that it is necessary to use Z for the fetter A): To make things even more difficult, the code name of the agent sending the message could precede the linear transposition. To wit: “genin’’ would move the ciphering alphabet to an offset of five letters; the same message would then be, WZRVMZ. By the same token, one may substitute numbers for the various letters. The same message would then be read as 2-5-22-1-18-5. The number sequence could also be changed\n\n15\n\n16\n\nNinja Cloak and Dagger\n\n16\n\nby adding or by subtracting a predetermined “key number” known only to the recipient and the sender. Of course, such systems are well known and easily broken. Cryptographers (from the Latin crypto meaning hidden and graphos meaning writing) are well aware of certain rules which govern secret messages, making it easy for them to decipher even more complicated codes of the substitution type. For instance, the most frequently used vowel in the English language is E. Therefore, by determining the most often seen symbol or letter, one can pretty well deduce that the letter would be an E. From this one would adjust the cipher-scale (a device whereby two corresponding alphabets may be juxtaposed for comparison), and it would be a relatively simple matter to see whether the message were in actuality a normal substitution code. The least used vowel is U; the letter Y should also be included among the vowels (it appears frequently at the end of words). The vowels EA are most frequently seen together and are followed by OU in order of frequency of usage. Two vowels which are often seen together are EE or OO and are usually followed by a vowel or the consonants L, M, N, or R. The most common consonants found at the ends of words are: S. R. and I. The most used double consonants are BL, BR, DR, FL, PR wGL. PHP Sr osr 2s bbe ERs W ob eandsly Ramla most frequently seen at the ends of words are CK, LD, LF, MN, ND, NG, RL, RM, RN, RP, RT, SM, ST, and XT. The most common two-letter words are AN, TO, BE, BY, OF, ON, OR, NO, SO, AS, IF, IN, IT, ME, MY, US, WE, and AM. With all these clues, it would seem that deciphering a secret message would be as easy as reading it noncoded. Most major newspapers publish daily crypto-quotes on which the aspiring cryptologist may practice. With a little effort, these can provide invaluable experience and no small amount of pleasure with increasing success and speed. While the daily newspaper makes things somewhat simple by maintaining the “phrasing,” or separation of words in the quote, usually\n\nVey,\n\nSecret Codes\n\nHF\n\nending it with the author’s name (for example, Longfellow), spies and agents in the field run the letters together (that is to say, they write the entire message without any spaces between the words, making it more difficult to tell where one word ends and the next begins). The longer the message, the easier it is to uncode, owing to the frequency of letters repeated.\n\nThe reverse of all this is often seen in the “‘encoding” of “stock numbers” on some items in retail establishments where the sales people are often permitted to negotiate the price of certain products. The sales price may be clearly stamped on the tag, and above or below it may appear several letters which indicate the bottom line or wholesale cost to the shopkeeper. (One example would be a retail price of $135.95 and a code of VIKE, meaning $97.50. This can be deduced from substituting the ten letters of the phrase black stove for the cardinal numbers one through ten. Armed with this “‘secret knowledge,” the buyer can make a lower offer for the item, knowing the minimum price that is acceptable. ) One thing that makes codes more difficult to break down is to write the message in a foreign language. (German is a good example, since most letters of the German alphabet correspond to those of English, with the notable exception of “8? which stands for “‘ss.’’ Words like street are thus transformed into the Germanic “‘strasse,’”’ which has no meaning to the uninitiated and might be overlooked as a possible solution to the code, or be misread as something else.) Naturally, this cannot be done with languages that use ideograms or word pictures, such as Chinese or Japanese. (In fact, when the telegraph was introduced to China, it was considered virtually useless until a sophisticated system of numbering specific kanji or words to be used in telex transmission of normal correspondence. The Chinese Almanac lists over 8,000 such numbered terms.) Word pictures were used by the Egyptians as a means of history and transmitting information to later recording generations. Hieroglyphics are unreadable to those without a thorough knowledge of ancient civilizations, yet they are the basis for Sanskrit, Arabic, and Hebrew alphabets. These\n\nNinja Cloak and Dagger\n\n18\n\n18\n\nwere not even readable to archeologists until the discovery of the Rosetta stone in 1799. Upon this archaic stone tablet was a record of daily events in Egyptian writing, Egyptian hieroglyphics, and Greek. By the careful comparison of these typographical records and the piecing together of what scientists were relatively certain were the languages of the time, the key to all three was uncovered. Hundreds of ancient texts were suddenly made clear.\n\nINVISIBLE\n\nINK\n\nInvisible inks are those which cannot be seen with the naked eye. They fall into two main categories: permanent and fugitive. With the permanent type, when the message is “brought out’? by chemical, electrical, magnetic, or refractive (special glasses or lenses, or ultraviolet light projection) means, it is always visible thereafter. In the case of unusual bands of radiation, light infrared and ultraviolet, the message is always seen under the lamp. In the case of chemical means, when the message “‘appears’’ as the result of chemical radiation or when it is heated, it does not dissolve again. With fugitive ink, ink that is brought out and made visible continues to react and fades out forever. (For an example of this type, consider the old story of the disciple of a wizard who stole the master’s secret text which revealed the source of his power. Eagerly he threw back the cover and began to read. The first sentence explained that the book was written in special ink and should only be read at night by the light of a small candle, since excessive light would damage the pages, dissolving the secrets for all time. And with that, it faded away.)\n\nAn adequate crypto-lab (such as that of the Federal Bureau of Investigation) is equipped with speed cameras. Highly trained personnel familiar with this type of procedure would be prepared to capture such an image, however fleeting. The fugitive ink ploy ensures that only one person will be able to read the message. The simplest and most basic invisible ink is eee it conforms to the fundamental principle of this method\n\n19\n\nSecret Codes\n\n19\n\n(i.e., the solution contains some component which will be absorbed by the paper but not be seen). Another easy example is salt water. When the liquid evaporates, the tiny crystals of salt remain, hardly visible unless one looks closely. Unfortunately, these crystals are easily disturbed and dislodged, making them unsuitable in most cases. Magicians and the ancient Ninja often used potassium nitrate in powder or prepared solution on charms and amulets to burn a mystic symbol on the ground or large parchment for dramatic effect. The main drawback to lemon juice is that the mild acidic content of the solution can cause it to bleach out the message on any paper that was tinted. Therefore, colored stationery could not be used. This points up another problem of organic inks: over a long period of time, they will eventually become visible. To employ the lemon juice, obtain a crow quill pen tip from an art supply store and a bottle of lemon juice. Dip the clean pen tip into the solution, and write a short message on a clean white page. It will be necessary to replenish the supply of ink with frequent trips to the “ink bottle.’ You will be able to “‘see’® what you are writing as the clear water on the page. When the water dries completely, the message will vanish! To bring out the message, iron the paper with a dry iron on medium heat or carefully pass the note over a low candle flame. The heat will turn the message brown. Naturally, one would not send a blank page as a secret message; it would be too obvious that there is a message there and\n\nwould\n\ninvite\n\ntampering.\n\nOf\n\ncourse,\n\none\n\ncould\n\ndirect\n\nattention to the “‘false letter,’ rather than the envelope upon which the real message could be penned quite boldly. Likewise, on a real letter, one could quite easily write a long and complete secret report on the envelope. In the event the correspondence is tampered with (say, steamed open), the heat from the steam used to dissolve the glue will bring out the message. This means that it cannot be delivered, since it would show evidence of having been breached. Since such a report would be more or less expected, its delayed arrival would arouse suspicion. With a\n\n20 fugitive\n\nNinja Cloak and Dagger ink, the message\n\nwould\n\nbe destroyed,\n\n20 another\n\ntip-\n\noff that security had been compromised. Another ploy one could use would be to write the secret report in between the lines of the “true” letter (the one that is to be seen and read openly). In this case, the recipient would have to know the message was present in order to bring it out; otherwise it might go unread. An even more elaborate method is to write the message in tiny letters underneath the stamp; of course, less can then be written due to the small size of most stamps and the message would have to be brief. Paint over the message with clear nail polish or similar protectant so that it will not be removed by the glue of the stamp. Likewise, this is an excellent spot to conceal a frame of film with secret information or a microdot.\n\nBOOK\n\nCODES\n\nThis category of codes is composed of those that require both the sender and recipient to be in possession of identical copies of the same text. For this reason, many spy networks, most notably the British, delight in making ciphers and keys from various passages of the Bible. The Bible is widely available and accessible in most parts of the world; even an agent in strange lands could obtain a copy and use it for encoding his message. Obviously, it would behoove the sender and receiver to agree on the specific edition to be employed (for example, the King James version) since there are certain minor discrepancies between versions which may profoundly affect the message. Basically, the encoded message consists of a series of numbers. The sequence is also prearranged so that the first number would be the page number, and the subsequent figures would refer to specific words on that page. For instance, if this were the numbered page, a message could be transmitted as 99-]11-41-32-33-48; which translates as “agent encoding key King James Bible.” Such a code is virtually unbreakable unless the key book is known. Cryptographers frequently assume that the numbers are some sort of substitution code.\n\nDak\n\nSecret Codes\n\npul\n\nA similar technique when writing is for the message to be composed of every third or fifth word of the letter. This requires no small amount of skill on the part of the writer. One method whereby this could be accomplished is through the medium of poetry. Further, in such an effort, the use of symbolism and code words could come into play. Many believe that ancient books and scrolls are composed of such allegorical references and that if one but knew which words to substitute for the key ones, all sorts of secret, hidden, or occult meanings and formulae would be revealed. Another way of confounding cryptographers is by leaving out a crucial word, number, or letter. Magician Harry Houdini provides an excellent example of this with his quote of “PRSRVYPRFCTMNVRKPTHSPRCPTSTN,” which he says was an “inscription over the Decalogue in a country church.” What is a Decalogue? you may ask. Answer: the Ten Commandments. And what is missing from the sentence? Answer: the letter E. Therefore, what is the message? The message is, preserve, ye perfect men, ever keep these precepts ten.\n\nHIEROGLYPHIC\n\nCODES\n\nIt has been previously stated that writing a secret message in a foreign language makes it more difficult to break down. Likewise, using foreign symbols increases the security of the message. There is an infinite variety of symbol codes from which one can choose, a variety limited only by the imagina-\n\ntion of the writer. The Stickmen Code requires a number of childlike “stick men” equal to the number of letters in the alphabet to be used. (In English, 26; unless some are left out such as Y, for which I is used instead). Each of the figures stands in a different pose or position (arms up, out to the side, standing on one leg, etc.) The message is then written around the border of the “obvious”’ letter. In this way, the message appears to be a bunch of meaningless doodles until decoded. A simple way to make hieroglyphs is to erase one or more of the vertical lines of a letter (E thus becomes “‘=’’). Artists sometimes color in the spaces between letters to make dis-\n\n22\n\nNinja Cloak and Dagger\n\nZe\n\ntinctive logos. The same method creates hieroglyphs from the emptiness rather than the existing letters. Those with a musical background can substitute notes and their varying positions on the scale in place of the required letters. Playing such a composition might be quite difficult, but a layman might overlook sheet music, especially if it is ‘““concealed’’ among other sheets. The Sign Alphabet used by the deaf is recommended not only as a means of writing secret messages, but also as a silent means of communication. In this example, the fingers are held or positioned to represent the letters, and the sentence is ‘‘spelled out” to the “‘listeners.”’ There is also an extensive series of “‘signs” that mean whole words, thereby making it possible to speak more quickly, only spelling out proper names, and so on. American Indian tribes were known to be conversant in a universal type of sign language regardless of their tribal tongue. Such signals were probably derived from hand and motion gestures used in hunting as a party. And, of course, the military has a set of hand commands for field use. The Ninja were known to employ nonverbal methods of communication when acting in teams of more than three. For the purpose of encoding, simply draw stick lines in the shape of the letters required, using these as a border around the periphery or some obvious message or as part of a larger mosaic or decorative pattern. The most universal code which should be familiar to all agents is the International Morse Code. It could be classified as a hieroglyphic sort or a substitution type of code since a group of dots and dashes replaces each letter. It can be transmitted by sound, light, or touch; and, like Braille, by pin pricks which are virtually unnoticeable ‘to the untrained eye. Such “rapping” or “tapping” codes are often used by prisoners of war so that they can communicate between their cells and keep the spirit and intellect alive.\n\nMAGICIAN\n\nCODES\n\nThese comprise some of the most subtle and elaborate means of communication ever devised, giving rise to the myth\n\n23\n\nSecret Codes\n\n23\n\n(encouraged by the performer) that it is possible to communicate telepathically. In most demonstrations, the seer is blindfolded or leaves the room while his assistant “‘helps”’ the audience select one of their number for the test, or to select an object to be hidden for the magician to find by using his psychic powers. The most obvious of these ploys is to simply choose a predetermined item, say, a watch. (Likewise, in a blindfolded cabaret show, a series of items is preselected.) The seer then fathoms the depths of the mental energy of the audience, members of whom are directed to concentrate on the object. In this way, the assistant can ask the same question verbatim, thereby allaying any suspicion that he or she is using key-words to tell the performer what object has been chosen. For example, the assistant can ask, “What do I have?” to inform the magician the object is a watch; “Now what do I have?” can indicate a wedding ring, and so on. The simpler the code (predetermined), the more mystifying it can be. In the Checkerboard Method, each square of the board is assigned a letter value, and messages are left by the strategic placement of checkers. Similarly, the Clock Code is one way whereby an assistant can direct the seer by laying an object like a pencil on an imaginary clock at some previously chosen location. If the point is toward “‘one o’clock,”’ the concealed object would be in the northeast corner of the room.\n\nOTHER CODES AND CIPHERS One method of encoding and decoding messages known from the time of Archimedes was for the sender and receiver\n\nto be in possession of two cylinders of identical diameter. A long strip of paper or cloth was wrapped around the object and the message written in simple language. When unrolled, it became undecipherable, appearing to be a strip of totally unrelated letters. However, when received and wound about the matching ‘“‘core,” the letters realigned themselves to spell out the message.\n\n24\n\nNinja Cloak and Dagger\n\n24\n\nSimilarly, in modern times, an ordinary comb could be used to transmit secret information. By making each space between the teeth of the comb represent the appropriate letter of the alphabet, the message could be “written” by carefully winding a thread from “‘letter to letter.’ As the thread was unwound from the comb, the various letters of the message would be revealed in reverse. By writing the message backwards and separating the words into their proper groups, the message was revealed. A sophisticated method of encoding was the “Ultra” encoding typewriter of World War II. By setting the machine to certain predetermined patterns, the mere typing of the message became totally scrambled by the random striking of keys that followed no logical substitution pattern. The recipient, being aware of which “‘tape”’ or pattern was used, would set his machine accordingly and type the cipher. The message would then be printed out.\n\nCODE\n\nNAMES\n\nAND\n\nRECOGNITION\n\nSYMBOLS\n\nAnother means of secret communication between agents in the field or their distant receivers of gathered intelligence data is a method used by espionage agents prior to World War I. At that time, there were fewer official networks, and there was a type of fraternal relationship among the agents, most of whom operated on a freelance basis. At this same time, Le Mercenaire (mercenary soldier) was a viable force on the global scale. Agents with connections to professional soldiers and adventurers (as well as the underworld of thieves and assassins) who had access to the highest levels of government developed the system of ‘“‘naming’’ one another out of a sense of camaraderie based on a daring exploit in which they had collaborated or competed (self-protection may have been another motive). During World War II, English agent Eddie Chapman was thought by both sides to have actually been an agent for the other when in reality he was probably merely doing his best for both sides in an effort to ensure his own well-being no matter the outcome of the war.\n\n25\n\nSecret Codes\n\nDS\n\nThe assumption of a “‘nom de voyage,” or traveling name, was a common practice, as are “‘cover”’ identities in this day and age. It was not uncommon for Jonin to dispatch several separate agents on the same mission. Among members of the same group, team, or ryu, subtle signals were used for identification. In this way, at least the “brother”? met in the field was likely to be on the same assignment. It was not unknown, however, that an agent would be dispatched to kill another after completion of the mission; this was a primitive, but effective, security precaution. Hence the old saying, trust no one after leaving the briefing room. In the Hai Lung Ryu (Black Dragon Society), one of these security precautions is the formal bow. Sometimes a bow might not be appropriate, as in a public place, for instance. But true Ninja can sense the presence of others using kobudera, or masking of real intent. The junior agent always bows first, thus establishing a chain of command. The senior agent might address the genin by some pseudonym, indicating him to be a distant relative (perhaps a cousin or nephew of the same family name). When meeting in private, the code name would be employed. This might reflect some previous incident known only to the Jonin, leader at the base camp, or something selected on the basis of prowess. (An American analogy to this would be naming a street gang member “Shiv.” meaning knife, because of his proficiency with a blade.) Some members of secret societies have a tattoo in some hidden place (inside the lip, in the armpit, and behind the ear are but a few examples). Gestapo agents were numbered in this manner and photographed in profile with right hand on left ear. This effectively covered their faces, making them anonymous, while showing the tattoo for the purpose of identification by superior officers. The Ninja may inscribe an eye on the palm of the hand or employ the method of mentally forming an image on the skin. Such a feat would be proof of ninjitsu powers of mind control, and, of course, the image would be one significant to the particular ryu in question. Two analogous historical references would be the Wing\n\n26\n\nNinja Cloak and Dagger\n\n26\n\nChun warriors of China, who used the hand tattoo asa distraction, flashing it in the eyes of the victim, and the Shaolin monks, who seared the patterns of the dragon and tiger on their forearms as a reminder of having passed through the Hall of Death and having moved a large metal urn full of coals to one side. The Black Dragon Ninja employ several techniques to bring out secret symbols and tattoos to distinguish them to others in the field. In this way, the signs are invisible to everyone until needed or desired. This is a magical technique known to but a few (and based on the principles elaborated in the section on invisible inks). Other types of recognition codes may consist of a rapping code in which each member of the signal and response pair would tap on the table or clap the hands a specific number of times, totaling twenty-one. The pattern could be random, each clicking any number of times, and the other answering always one short of the final total. Or the pattern may be based on a multiple of three or seven. In this case, the sender taps four times, the receiver answers with three (total, seven), until the total key number is reached. Three repetitions equals 21. Sometimes the mere positioning of a discarded can or addition of some tiny device, like a push-pin unobtrusively placed on a tree or under a bench, can be the sign that all is well. This object placement would be used at a meeting site or package drop.\n\nCHAPTER. O\n\n5\n\nMeditation In the ninjitsu practice of Kuji Kiri, there are Nine Steps and Nine Gates through which one must pass to gain mastery of the self. This will enable the practitioner to endure pain, hardship, and even torture without flinching, although, of course, they are to be avoided whenever possible. This form of meditation is so efficient that even if no other method were used, all would eventually become Known to the practitioner. Begin sitting in a cross-legged position, or half-lotus pose, with the hands folded in the lap. The right hand, palm up, is cradled in the palm-up left hand; the thumbs touch or cross. Fix the gaze and attention on a wall about six feet in front of you. Since the Ninja essentially operates alone, the wall becomes a symbol of the Mind Fortress, which can resist even psychic attack. In the practice of debriefing meditation, this point is replaced by looking into the Third Eye of the companion to establish subconscious rapport, making it easier to transmit and receive information. Tighten the seat muscles slightly, place the tip of the tongue on the roof of the mouth, and inhale and exhale through the nose, drawing the air deep into the Hara (a point in the center of the lower abdomen that is one-and-one-half inches below the navel). Breathe at the rate of nine heart-\n\nbeats\n\nper inhalation\n\nand\n\nnine\n\nZe\n\nper exhalation.\n\nRepeat nine\n\nZo\n\nNinja Cloak and Dagger\n\n28\n\ntimes. The breath should be slow, fine, and continuous. The nose hairs should not quiver, and the sound of respiration\n\nshould not be heard by the performer. After the nine repetitions, without losing focus or concentration, lower the eyes to look at a spot on the floor in front of you at an angle of approximately 45 degrees. Repeat nine breaths at the rate of nine heartbeats in and out in this position; then shift the eyes downward to look at the hands. In Dreaming Practice, the first thing the practitioner must learn to see in his dreams are his hands as they are familiar to him. After that, one can begin to learn to set up a dream to solve a problem that is not resolved during waking hours. Repeat nine breaths at this site, as before. Next, direct the eyes to look at the tip of the nose. This will cross the eyes gently. Do not strain. Conduct nine breaths at this level also. Remember to focus the attention on the Hara. Breathe with the abdomen, and let the shoulders be slightly rounded in a comfortable slouch, keeping the back straight. If the shoulders ride up and down during practice, one is breathing with the lungs, not the Hara.\n\nAfter nine breaths, close the eyes gently but continue to look at the tip of the nose. Perform nine breaths at the rate of nine heartbeats per inhalation and exhalation at this point. Then do nine more, listening for any sound of breathing. There should be none. Following those eighteen breaths, turn the eyes inward a bit more so that they look at each other inside the skull. Concentrate on drawing the breath into the Hara nine times as before. For the ninth level, concentrate on the Hara, inhale three heartbeats, hold for three, and exhale for six. When you no longer notice your breathing, you will be meditating. To come out of the meditation, one should relax, inhale a full breath, and slowly let it out through the mouth. One should slightly tighten the muscies at the back of the throat so that a soft snoring type of sound is produced. Repeat three times. This is a decompression step. Slowly rub the Hara counterclockwise with the left hand thirty-six times. Then rub the hands together in a circular\n\n29\n\nmanner,\n\nMeditation\n\n29\n\nagain counterclockwise, twenty-five times. Place the hands lightly over the eyes and inhale three times, drawing the warmth from the hands down into the Hara before opening the eyes slowly.\n\npion i ater eer eel\n\nelpayte ak\n\nerp ionsots ath |\n\n’” Cabin Gp OS 191\n\n08\n\n> w\n\niow\n\n!\n\n7\n\nPhoto 41\n\nNinja Cloak and Dagger\n\n64\n\n64\n\nend at the moment of impact. This transmits the inertia of the entire rippling movement to the tip of the coiled cloth (which is now a sharpened corner rather than a wide edge). When practicing, one will know whether the technique is working properly when there is an audible pop, much like the cracking of a bullwhip.\n\nBULLWHIP\n\nSTRIKE\n\nFor the sake of safety while practicing this technique, strike with the more blunt, or less twisted end. In actual combat, one would hold the large end and attack with the sharpest point. Photo 42 shows the combatants at the beginning of the engagement. The Ninja swings the whip around his head to gather momentum\n\nas the enemy\n\nstarts his attack, and strikes\n\nout with the rat tail whip in the overhand bull-whip method (Photo 43). As the weapon reaches its maximum extension, the Ninja jerks backward on the held end to “‘pop the whip ” (Photo 44), the target area being the enemy’s eyes or face. With this method, one may keep even an armed opponent at bay. Although this technique will not kill an opponent, the\n\nPhoto 42\n\n65\n\n*\n\nPhoto 44\n\nThe Cloak\n\n65\n\nNinja Cloak and Dagger\n\n66\n\nUNDERHAND\n\n66\n\nWHIP\n\nThis technique is the logical follow-up to the previous one in that it may not be possible to make a wide swing in a confined area, or when the enemy is not deterred by the bullwhip strike and tries to advance before a second whip can be made. The combatants prepare to engage (Photo 45). Although both ends of the blanket are shown gripped, the striking end “may be on the ground. The Ninja pulls the whip forward from his waist to launch the tip at the enemy (Photo 46). The blanket covers the intervening space in half the time, but has less inertia. Again, at the apex, snatch back on the held end to pop the whip, striking the hand of the training partner\n\nas shown\n\nin Photo\n\n46.

In a life-or-death struggle, anything that can disable or impede an enemy’s advance is permissible. In Photo 48, the Ninja makes a slight advance while staying out of the sword’s range, though his enemy is in range of the whip. Looping the twisted cloak around the enemy’s é\n\n=\n\nPhoto 49\n\n7\n\n.\n\nra\n\nre\n\nFaces\n\nms\n\nee\n\n5\n\nSRE SWY yt\n\nee\n\nM2\n\n69\n\nThe Cloak\n\n69\n\nPhoto 51\n\nleg at the ankle (Photo 49) by swinging it in a low arc along the ground (letting the inertia carry the tip in a tight wrap on the target), the Ninja gains the advantage. By pulling the cloak back strongly (Photo 50), the Ninja upsets the enemy’s balance and topples him. Even if the enemy tried to retreat, he is captured in the Ninja’s web by this entangling trick. Photo 51 shows the enemy on the ground.\n\n70\n\nNinja Cloak and Dagger\n\n70\n\nSPIN PIVOT Should the enemy grab the edge of the cloak in an effort to restrain the Ninja, he would find his seemingly advantageous position quickly reversed. Since the cape is merely draped on the body, one can easily slip out of it and use it to entangle one’s opponent. In Photo 52, the sentry is shown seizing the cape. The Ninja steps to the left with his right foot under the enemy’s arm (Photo 53) and then steps behind him, flipping the cloak over him from the rear as the Ninja makes good his escape (Photo 54). It may seem that the two opponents are wrestling over possession of the blanket, since neither releases his hold and it is pulled back and forth. It may appear that the Ninja will become wrapped up in the cloak as he turns, but, with practice, one can back out of the cape without harm.\n\nPhoto 52\n\n71\n\n71\n\nThe Cloak\n\nWire ae\n\nPhoto 53\n\nPhoto 54\n\nNinja Cloak and Dagger\n\nUD)\n\nHOLDING\n\nTHE\n\n72\n\nBAG\n\nIn the unlikely event that the enemy should get too close, one method of vanishing one can use is to hand him the cape.

All have their values and drawbacks, and we would not presume to endorse one over another. Rather let it be said that each soldier must select the tool he finds to be most appropriate, and this selection should be done after careful consideration and due experimentation. Also, one should not be adverse to switching to another blade and keep abreast of the latest knife\n\ndevelopments.\n\nIf one’s life may depend on one’s blade, then,\n\nby all means, it should be one with which he is comfortable. In olden times, however, most of the Ninja’s weapons were cast-offs or broken, stolen, or homemade dirks and short swords, including the fencing type “‘needle”’ or icepick style, which could only be used for thrusting since it had no cutting edge. As such, the Ninja dagger was normally shorter than the customary sword. Contrary to popular misconceptions, persons concerned with slipping about silently in the dark would not ordinarily encumber themselves with the huge blades that are commonly sold and pictured today as the Ninja-To.\n\nThe weapon used in this presentation is custom-made for the practitioner. It is measured along the arm, as can be seen\n\nTA,\n\n78\n\nNinja Cloak and Dagger\n\n78\n\nin the first stance of the Hsiao Chien Do Set: straight, singleedged, with a blood groove and square Tsubo (fingerguard). The size of the blade is of little importance in its effective use aS a weapon; one of the most easily concealable cutting edges is a razor blade. When used in the manner demonstrated herein, it becomes a deadly weapon (there is only a slight difference in range). In Japan, it is forbidden to possess a “‘live blade” without a special permit. This law is notably an example of bureaucracy and of the respect afforded to the honorable and lethal weapon of ancient times. Such regulations, naturally, have done little to preclude the obtaining of unregistered swords or their use in the hands of partially trained, criminal, or egoistic individuals bent on using such blades for their own purposes. The man in the street, however, is restricted to having a knife with a blade no longer than two inches. This may seem, at first, to be a handicap. However, when it is recalled that such a small blade is easily hidden in the palm and, when properly employed, its application can be both vicious and devastating, it can be considered an asset. It too, becomes an invisible, or hidden, weapon just like the razor blade. Lastly, one may use a metal fingernail knife or claw or the trained hand of the martial artist. The principles are the same: conduct a surprise attack with a secret weapon.\n\nDAGGER\n\nFORM\n\nThe Dagger Set, or Short Sword Kata, is a practice form taught to members of the Black Dragon Society. It has been known and taught to spies and assassins since ancient times and employs both the fencing grip and the reverse grip. It is intended to be used in conjunction with the cloak or cape, which “‘hides” the weapon until it is too late for the victim to realize the danger and defend himself adequately. We have illustrated elsewhere several techniques which utilize the cape alone. When combined with this set of knife attacks, the cape and knife form the Nine Methods of the Cloak and Dagger System. These are not pretty or flowery\n\n; er The Dagg 79\n\nmovements, but real and deadly strikes used by bandits and street fighters for centuries. They are intended to end the\n\nconflict with one stroke. Because the dagger, knife, tanto, Bowie or Roman size short sword, shuto (wakazashi), or even so large a blade as the daito (katana) is often concealed from view behind the cloak, we have performed it here only simulating the cape so that the weapon can be seen. Likewise, due to the sudden\n\nappearance and vanishing of the knife by means of the movements and angles involved, it is sometimes known as the Hidden Knife, or Invisible Dagger Form. Those who take an interest in the history of such things believe it is derived from the Chinese Hsiao Chien Do, or the “‘Way of: the Melting Sword.” : n blanket, but In Photo 62, the Ninja is shown holding the ni ,\n\nbehind\n\nit he holds a sword:\n\nMN\n\noe\n\nWe\n\nat .\n\nN\n\no\n\n62\n\n63).

This might be accomplished by merely terrifying the enemy leader by appearing in his bed chamber to deliver some threatening message or by doing him in. (Consider the motion picture The Godfather, in which the minions of the underground society placed the severed head of a producer’s favorite horse in his bed, clearly implying that he could be killed just as easily any time it was ordered or desired. Naturally, he complied with the wishes of the\n\npatriarch.) When faced with one’s own mortality or vulnerability, decisions become more conservative. There is a legend among the Ninja of an agent who killed his target by hiding in the rafters above his bed and trickled poison down a thread onto the victim’s lips. The man died while sleeping with his wife, who never heard a thing. No trace remained of how this feat was accomplished, but credit was duly given to the shadow warriors of the night, the Ninja.\n\nThere is a good deal to be said for sufficiently intimidating the enemy. It is said that the reason the Shogun employed\n\nb27\n\nIZ\n\nNinja Cloak and Dagger\n\nI28\n\nover 40,000 troops to raid and destroy the four-thousandman Iga Ninja encampment was his great fear that some Ninja might survive and take revenge upon him. Because the Ninja had for years made certain that tales of their prowess and physical abilities were spread across the land, the emperor probably thought their forces were far larger than they were—a tribute to the Ninja’s dissemination of “black propaganda.” The Cloak of Secrecy contributes to the mystical image of the Ninja; the Dagger of the Mind places fear in the enemy’s heart. (This is one of the interpretations one can make of the ‘nin’ ideogram or symbol, the cloak/sword above the heart.) As we have seen, there are always multiple meanings to every event, and the trick is to have the proper interpretation of the gathered intelligence so that seemingly minor incidents can have major effects.\n\nCHAPTER ©\n\n10\n\nSurreptitious Entry The art of stealing in, also known as the methods of hiding, or Inpo, was the special stock and trade of the ancient Ninja. Modern revelations have shown that such ‘“‘black bag” operations persist in the intelligence community even today. . Any time the enemy writes something down or sketches an item or prototype, he places that information at risk. Egyptian pharoahs were known to kill all the slaves who labored on the critical parts of a pyramid, and the high priests, who often knew the secrets of the structure, were frequently expected to entomb themselves alive with their leader to protect the security of the edifice. Spy masters are fond of secret compartments and microfilm; others employ heavy safes or elaborate security systems. Penetration of the enemy stronghold was a particularly dangerous and challenging task to the masked warriors of the night. It was often used as a test for the rookie agent; that is, one trained in the art of stealth and in need to prove himself to the master. True leaders (Jonin) seldom allowed youthful zeal and enthusiasm to be the downfall of potential Genin. They realized that it is the nature of young men and women to undergo such rites of passage. An assignment which specified covert entry, extraction of\n\n12g\n\n130\n\nNinja Cloak and Dagger\n\n130\n\nintelligence data, and withdrawal without being caught required daring and skill. If captured and tortured, the Jonin would, of course, deny any knowledge of the agent’s actions. Bypassing alarm systems in olden times was relatively easy. A gravel path around the domicile, while appearing merely decorative, would make loud grating sounds when trod upon, thereby alerting sentries or the occupant of the house. The Ninja would muffle this noise by rolling his wide, soft obi, or belt, across the sidewalk and slip quietly across. Modern burglar alarms, cameras, photoelectric eyes, motion detectors, tremblers, sonic fields, and simple circuit switches that sound the alarm when closed or opened all present difficult obstacles. Basically there are two ways of defeating them: kill the power, and follow the guards. Ancient Shaolin temples in China had an elaborate set of pressure-sensitive floor plates which would trigger darts or bear traps when stepped on by unauthorized persons seeking to sneak in and learn their techniques. Initiates had a ritual kata similar to hopscotch whereby they walked only on the safe squares, avoiding the pitfalls. If this pattern was unfamiliar, it was quite hard for the untrained initiate to duplicate it, and he would give himself away. If one tried to pass when no one else was present, the secret triggers were almost certain to get him. Even if a guard were taken captive and forced to show the pattern, he could sacrifice himself by tripping one of the traps and ducking aside. One method of defeating this device was to walk on large boards, which distributed the weight over a bigger surface. This made the Ninja too “‘light’”’ to set off the alarm. Similarly, when entering a Ninja stronghold, there was a prescribed set of shrines by which one needed to pause in front of, thus silently identifying oneself to any hidden watchers.\n\nSome military installations and security-sensitive individuals employ both human and animal sentries, the most often seen being the K-9 (canine) Corps of the Army. German\n\nshepherds,\n\nDoberman\n\npinschers,\n\nLabrador\n\nretrievers—\n\nvirtually any large dog—can be trained for this purpose.\n\nLad\n\nSurreptitious Entry\n\nye |\n\nDogs. were among the first animals domesticated by man, and, if properly handled, are loyal and dedicated. Usually the handler and the dog are a team from the first day the pup is selected. This builds a bond of friendship and devotion which is almost unbreakable. Guard dogs have been known to “pine away’ and die when their masters fall in the line of duty. In the Western Call of the Wild by Jack London, a Saint Bernard in the Alaskan Yukon actually revenges itself on the Indians who killed its master. Such loyalty is not unknown in the real world, either. When entering an area with a guard animal, it must be first eliminated, be it leopard, cougar, or canine. Traps and snares are one method to use; poison meat (seldom effective with well-trained animals who only eat from their handlers) or a female of the species to incite competition among the pack or occupy the hound in question have all been used, but require some preparation. Naturally if the dog patrols alone, sans handler backup, he is more vulnerable. Since Roman times, geese have been an effective deterrent to surreptitious entry, squawking loudly when anyone approaches. They require little supervision or care and tend to operate in a gaggle or pack. Unlike with a dog, one One may pass upwind of geese since their olfactory senses are poorly developed; after all, a dog would smell your presence. Any bird, startled at night, can give away your position. We have discussed in Secrets of Invisibility the various methods of bypassing a sentry, and while even that work does not encompass all the techniques available to the practicing Ninja, it does illustrate the fundamental principles of that aspect of the art of invisibility. Likewise, there are many excellent books on the market which explain the means whereby the standard locks found in use today may be manipulated and opened with specially designed lockpicks and tiny turning wrenches. It is not our purpose here to enter into a treatise on these topics, but rather to discuss the more ancient and archaic hiding places used by the agent in the house of feudal times. Considering the state of Chinese and Japanese architecture during that period, eavesdropping was a relatively simple\n\n1S2\n\nNinja Cloak and Dagger\n\n132\n\ntask for the secreted Ninja. Many floors were raised above the ground, providing crawlspaces into which one might scurry at the approach of a guard, or simply hide beneath to over-\n\nhear conversations\n\nbetween\n\nofficers or enlisted\n\nmen\n\nof the\n\ncastle. One must recall, however, the tale of the agent betrayed by a small cloud of mosquitoes above his position. An alert samurai noticed the insects, knowing a human was nearby, and impaled the unfortunate listener by plunging his spear through the floor boards. Another frequently used hiding place was among the rafters of the enemy’s house. Clinging like a giant bat to the upper beams was one way of remaining in the shadows cast by candles and primitive oil lamps. Modern hung ceilings are easier.\n\nATTIC/RAFTER\n\nHIDING\n\nPLACES\n\nAs a hiding place inside an enemy’s dwelling, attics are hard to beat. They are accessible by way of vents that allow air to circulate in the upper chamber and open to the outside. Any small boards or screens that cover these openings to keep out insects must be cut away or be sawed out with the tiny keyhole saw-type tool. In the attic, the roof rests upon the triangle portion of the framework known as a truss. The ceiling is fixed to the horizontal part of the truss, above the heads of those beneath it. Most are quite fragile, and not designed to bear weight. Therefore, one must move from beam to beam (Photos 122, 123) to keep from falling through. The thinness of ceiling panels makes it easy for one to hear through them for the purpose of eavesdropping. Drilling a tiny hole with the point of one’s knife permits a wide view of the room below. Attics and lofts are also accessible inside the house by means of trapdoors; these may be found in halls or closets. Modern methods of eavesdropping include the Bionic Ear, a long-range “shotgun microphone” capable of picking up a whisper across a football field; microphones, both planted and carried by agents when participating in an assignment; and Infinity-type devices which can cause an ordinary\n\nSurreptitious Entry\n\noe\n\nPhoto\n\n123\n\n134\n\nNinja Cloak and Dagger\n\n134\n\ntelephone to pick up conversations. Many mikes are sensitive enough to pick up ordinary conversation through plaster or thin wooden walls. The Ninja can employ a common stethoscope for this purpose or the rim of a drinking glass and press it to the wall. By putting the ear near the base, voices can be discerned through the barrier due to the inductive nature of sound waves, which strike the wall, are amplified by the air trapped in the glass, and are transmitted to the listener’s ear. One should experiment to find out which shape of glass is best. Since sounds are naturally muffled somewhat by this technique, a certain amount of practice is necessary so that you can make out what is being said. The Ninja of old were skilled in both lip and body reading, which enabled them to “‘listen in’? on conversations out of normal earshot. The use of binoculars or telescopes makes it possible to perform this feat from a concealed or even further distant position, but is seldom reliable for detailed information. Another improvised listening device is the primitive ear trumpet of the early English physicians. It was made from a cone of tightly rolled paper. With the small end to the ear, the larger, collecting end was placed against the patient’s chest. Listening outside the windows was also a common tactic. In ancient times, many walls and windows were made of paper for the sake of simplicity, lack of glass, and frequent need to rebuild the homes, especially in Japan, after earthquakes, floods, or typhoons. But one cannot see through paper, and even a thin sheet might distort key words or phrases. Furthermore, the act of poking a hole” in the screen produced a small, although noticeable and distinctive, sound, which might alert the occupants to the presence of an eavesdropper. To test this theory, construct a small frame of paper and try to quietly make a hole in it. Not so easy. But, a pinhole makes very little noise, and by placing the eye next to the aperature, quite a wide field of view can be had. Still, creating the pinhole does make a noise; unless the needle tip or\n\npin point is “drilled” through with extremely gentle pressure.\n\n13S\n\nSurreptitious Entry\n\n155\n\nSo the ancient Ninja, with his knowledge of science and chemistry, devised another way. By wetting the paper with the tip of the tongue, an opening could be “‘melted”’ out, making an even larger gap through which to observe the interior. An earlier variation on this principle was to moisten the end of a finger and push out a tiny trap-door type of hole through the softened papyrus. Dampening the site at which a sharp point would enter (as in the pinhole) rendered it useless. Once the tool was withdrawn, the wet fibers tend to seal themselves back together. Such miniscule “‘peepholes’ could also be used to peer through floors and ceilings; modern ‘‘fish-eye lenses” help.\n\nCLOSET There\n\nAMBUSH is no\n\nI\n\nlegitimate\n\nreason\n\nfor being\n\ninside\n\na closet.\n\nMost people never set foot inside one, and even a searcher normally just sticks his head in to look around. Be aware of this tendency to not enter the closet all the way since it can work to the advantage of the lurker. Press one\n\nshoulder on the outside wall near the side of the\n\ndoor which opens first. This crack may provide an observation port. If hiding in a secure area, be sure to conceal yourself after the room is swept by guards. If hiding from pursuit, use the following technique.\n\nFrom a position of concealment on the nearest side of the closet and with your right arm against the wall overhead in preparation, wait for the sentry to look in fully (Photo 124). This side of the alcove offers the best shadow in which to hide to escape detection. If the guard spots you, drop your right hand down on the back of his neck (Photo 125), grabbing the hair, and jam the gun hand with the left hand. Jerk the enemy forward, ramming his head into the far wall (Photo 126) to render him unconscious. Follow up with a knee to the chest.\n\nCLOSET Another\n\nAMBUSH\n\nII\n\nhiding place inside an alcove\n\nor closet is on the\n\n136\n\nPhoto 125\n\nNinja Cloak and Dagger\n\n136\n\n132\n\nSurreptitious Entry\n\nLo /\n\nPhoto 126\n\nupper shelf (Photo 127). Many times there are boxes, hats, and so on that can be used to provide extra cover and concealment. This also employs two principles of hiding: people don’t look up, and people do not walk into closets. There are two methods in which to hide on a closet shelf: lie along the back wall of the shelf or crouch in the corner. The latter method is more useful in attacking a searching sentry. As the bodyguard opens the door and checks the interior, he may not see the hiding figure (Photo 128). If, however, one wishes:to make an attack, strike out strongly with a sidekick to the face or throat (Photo 129), stunning him long\n\nili ‘a\n\nPhoto 128\n\nPhoto 129 enough to drop out of the place of concealment him for the finishing technique.\n\nSITTING\n\nSENTRY\n\nATTACK\n\non top of\n\nI\n\nIn ancient times, when people sat on the floor or knelt on tatami mats, methods of attacking a target lower than oneself, especially an unsuspecting one, were among the Ninja repertoire.\n\n140\n\nNinja Cloak and Dagger\n\n140\n\nOne of the best moments for such a strike is just as the victim is off balance in preparing to be seated. As he makes himself comfortable, he is most vulnerable. Stand swiftly and silently behind the victim (Photo 130) poising with the garrote loosely between the hands (Photo Py Drop the cord over his head, pulling upward and to the rear with both hands (Photo 132). He can be strangled by this method in from five to thirty seconds with no outcry being possible.\n\nPhoto 130\n\n141\n\nSurreptitious Entry\n\nPhoto 131\n\nEM\n\nSITTING\n\nSENTRY\n\nIe\n\nATTACK\n\n14]\n\nEsra II\n\nWhen penetrating the enemy stronghold, one may need to hide behind some article of furniture to avoid being discovered, or one may creep to such a position (Photo 133) for an attack. The important thing is to stun the enemy instantly without permitting him to make an outcry. This may be accom- | plished by reaching over the back of the chair in which he is seated (Photo 134) or reaching behind the head of the bodyguard and dropping your fingers into his hair. Simultaneously, jerk his head up and back to lift the chin, and swing around the side of the chair to chop him in the\n\nthroat with a ““Thousand Hand Strike’ to the Adam’s apple (Photo 135). A strong strike will crush the windpipe, but this may be difficult for some to do; even a light tap will cause breathlessness by disrupting the nerve impulses of the phrenic nerve, which controls the diaphragm.\n\n142\n\nNinja Cloak and Dagger\n\nNA\n\nPhoto 133\n\n142\n\n143\n\nSLEEPING\n\nSurreptitious Entry\n\nSENTRY\n\n1435\n\nATTACK\n\nEven bodyguards must sleep. Normally, they do so in shifts of four hours each, which ensures that those on duty remain fresh and alert. One might suspect that the off-duty guards would tend to drop their defenses a bit. The Ninja takes advantage of this psychological characteristic by practicing attacking the sentry as he sleeps. Being masters of stealth, the Ninja could quite adroitly creep up on an adversary who was wide awake. Practiced in the methods of seeing in the dark, they could also easily locate their victim in pitch-black darkness. Some professional killers surround their beds each evening with the pages of whatever newspaper is at hand in whatever city they may find themselves. This makes a cheap but effective burglar alarm, since anyone who tries to cross the paper would necessarily make a distinct rustling noise that would awaken the sleeper. This is a variation of the ancient Japanese principle of the nightingale floor, made of fitted board that would sing out by creaking when trod on. Of course, no hired gun or mercenary would ever be far from his weapon. He must therefore be considered armed and dangerous. After reclining only ten minutes, his reaction time is doubled, a highly significant point one should remember. The crafty Ninja prepares for the attack by secreting himself in the barracks area before the sentry arrives. By peeking out from under the bed (Photo 136), he can observe and discern the movements of the bodyguard as he enters, checks his weapon, and prepares to get some rest. By listening to the sounds of his breathing, the Ninja is able to determine the enemy’s state of relaxation. Sleeping respirations, if not distinctive snoring, are not regular or equal; they are generally deeper and slower than the normal waking rate. Keeping well below the edge of the bed or cot (Photo 137) ensures that the Ninja remains out of sight, even with the lights on. Once clear of the frame and the covers which previously concealed him from view, he is careful to avoid any rustling of cloth by using the serpent step, raising up on\n\n144\n\nNinja Cloak and Dagger\n\ni\n\nPhoto 136\n\nPhoto 137\n\n144\n\n145\n\nSurreptitious Entry\n\n145\n\nPhoto 138\n\nthe fingers and toes and lifting the torso to glide an inch or so above the surface. Drawing the body up into a coil, preparing to strike and then pushing off strongly with the knees and elbows, the Ninja springs upon the bodyguard, dropping his elbow onto the solar plexus (Photo 138) and his weight onto the enemy’s chest to pin him to the cot and trap his arms.\n\nCAPTURING\n\nA SLEEPING\n\nSENTRY\n\nIt may be that you wish to question the subject or take him prisoner. In that event, the intimidation factor of seeing a knife at his throat (Photo 139) is a compelling argument for\n\nhim to follow any whispered instructions. Further, by clamping the free hand over his mouth, the sleeper is prevented from making any outcry or raising an alarm when held in a no-outcry hold. If the intent is to kill the sleeper, the combination of covering the mouth and severing the carotid artery just below the ear is most effective.\n\n146\n\nPhoto 139\n\nPhoto 140\n\nNinja Cloak and Dagger\n\n146\n\n147\n\nSurreptitious Entry\n\n147\n\nIf the intent is to question the sleeper, some Ninja ryu employ the more mysterious method of clamping the hand over the enemy’s eyes and holding him to the pillow by the leverage of this hold. In this invisible assassin hold/technique, the tip of the dagger is placed under the enemy’s chin to prevent outcry and act as a threat (Photo 140). This technique psychologically makes the Ninja omnipotent with a minimum of contact.\n\nHIDING\n\nBEHIND\n\nTHE\n\nCURTAIN\n\nIn the previous technique, one might question the bodyguard while pinning him to the floor or bed with a hand over\n\nPhoto 14]\n\n148\n\nNinja Cloak and Dagger\n\n148\n\n‘ii4\n\n‘a\n\n3\n\nPhoto 142\n\nthe eyes. When the interrogation is over, One may take advantage of an outcry to misdirect an incoming sentry and thereby catch him off guard as well. If the room is dark, stand beside the door on tae latch side. If the room is lit, duck out of sight behind a curtain\n\nSurreptitious Entry\n\n149\n\nyay +\n\n\"\n\nBEA\n\nae"
