But that’s okay. It sounds like birdtalk.com.SNL.org.PBR.can.\n\nNarrow it down.\n\nYoung Twitchy.\n\nBingo.\n\nHarmony Korine: Young Twitchy at Gagosian-GalleriesNow.\n\n8 days ago.\n\nThere’s some portrait of a grandfather that comes up next to “all Korine.”\n\n(Maybe it’s Harmony’s father who belonged to a hippie commune out in Bolinas in the late ’60s. Harmony was born into his father’s hippie cult, in Bolinas, a town famous for having no sign to tell road-trippers where it was located. I’ve been there. No wonder Harmony’s mother helped keep Richard Brautigan’s American dust cleaned. Anarchy in the USA. Harmony’s father is now living in Panama. For the past 20 years. In Panama. No way. Yes way. WTF. That’s two personal connections right there.)\n\nAbbreviations. Hashtags. Emojis. Ideograms.\n\nI go down the rabbit hole a little further.\n\nI type in “extremely naked and enthusiastically playing the bongos.”\n\nA quote from Harmony: “The works were re-created in oil paint on canvas from images I constructed on my iPhone. I usually took these photographs around my home in Florida, and then painted over them with different characters. These light characters hang out with dogs, or dance on the abandoned boat dock. I would sit outside alone by the water and create alien-like friends on a low-key cosmic tropical playground.”\n\nThat’s what he says.\n\nGreasy-headed drool locked up in a tote bag of championship Total.\n\nTotal is good enough for me.\n\nI walked into the gallery with Harmony. It’s on the fifth floor, 980 Madison Ave. First room off the elevator. Once a series of office rooms, now converted into a generic showroom. Low ceilings, no windows. It’s as if WeWork built a gallery space.\n\nI immediately like.\n\nHeart it.\n\nEven though I hadn’t read Harmony’s quote above, I get everything about the paintings. Right off. Right off the bat. Every so often “the get” happens. Grand slam. Round-tripper. RBIs. Jimmy Piersall. Happily surprised. I’m happy. Feeling good. In front of art. Nothing better. Fear strikes out.\n\nDigital.\n\nAnalogue.\n\nMixtape.\n\nTerms usually associated with music sometimes can be applied to visual art. Gaslight Moondog.\n\nThe digital part is the phone. That’s where the paintings start. The analogue is the traditional materials, canvas, stretchers, paint. The two polar bears, combined with Harmony’s wack and doodle, create a kind of new special effect that looks everyday normal. Granted. Not everyday. The medicine is a little of this, a little of that. How hard can it be? That’s according to Jesus.\n\nJesus says, “Let’s party. Let’s have some fun.” Jesus saves.\n\nComposed. Manipulated. Filed.

Maybe it’s a toddler’s bedtime story.\n\nI’m working on it.\n\n“At least you’re taking your own pics,” I tell Harmony.\n\nI continue: “Because if you’re not, you’re going to get deposed.”\n\nI continue: “Giving deposition is post-place.”\n\nI continue: “If you’re being sued for something that harmlessly doesn’t belong to you . . . you’re going to be set up, grilled, sit in a hot seat, trying to survive seven hours of stone-cold killing staring straight into a videocam in a conference room somewhere in the bowels of Even Lower Manhattan trying to answer slippery stupid legal questions about what’s art.”\n\n“What are you supposed to say?” asks Harmony.\n\n“Something about beachcombing.”\n\n“Innocent,” says Harmony.\n\nSix art handlers show up. “Do you guys want a water?”\n\nThey look “post-place.”\n\nThat’s what I tell Harmony about his paintings.\n\nHe says, “What’s that?”\n\nI say something about past present future. Then I say, “It’s like drag racing with Jungle Pam.”\n\n“Jungle Pam,” says Harmony.\n\nExcited.\n\nThat’s the thing about Harmony.\n\nYou can throw out something INSIDE WORLD, and he knows about it.\n\nMr. Wizard.\n\nWhen I arrived in New York in 1974 there was this term “post-studio” floating around. Description? Art made. Then photographed. Then the art that was made and photographed was abandoned. So what was made and photographed was a record.\n\nMore music.\n\nBack in 1974, post-studio was a good fit for me. I couldn’t afford a studio. [Rim shot]\n\nWe finish our waters.\n\nWe watch the six art handlers move more paintings into the room. Gallery Army. Be all you can be. And if you can’t be all you can be, then be what someone else can be.\n\nYou used to be on the phone.\n\nNow you’re in the phone.\n\nThe past is the past.\n\nWe all agree.\n\nAll together now.\n\nYou used to be on the phone in the kitchen. Touch-tone. Or, in Harmony’s father’s day, rotary. There was usually only one phone per family and it was hardwired to a wall. Depending on the flexibility of the curl in the cord, you could maybe walk six feet without letting go of the receiver. Back in Harmony’s father’s day, Mobil was the name of a gas station.\n\nRight before the dawn.\n\nIn 1972 I got my first phone hooked up in my first rental up in the state of Maine. Way up, north of Rockport, Andrew Wyeth country. I took a Magic Marker and wrote “Donkey Boy” on my first intercontinental off-white plastic fantastic contraption.\n\nHee-haw.\n\nYou feelin’ me?\n\nThe Now Phone.\n\nSomewhere between Children of Men and cosplay.\n\nYou’re taking an Uber to the airport, sitting in traffic, and making art on your phone.\n\n“Didn’t you just make this art coming in from LaGuardia?” I ask Harmony.\n\nHarmony says, “Yea. Kind of. I guess. Sort of.”\n\nKind of.\n\nI guess.\n\nAnd sort of.\n\nDo androids dream of electric sheep?\n\nEven in fair condition, a first edition goes for north of 5K.\n\n“Sitting in traffic can be your studio,” I say.\n\n“That’s post-place,” Harmony says.\n\n“Let’s stop bumming and look at the paintings.”*\n\n*In the history of golden-age comic book covers, there have only been two times where an illustration of a comic book superhero was superimposed over a photo-realistic background. One was a Sub-mariner. The other, a Superman. This presentation did not go over well with readers. The result of this pre-Photoshop mock-up, or what used to be called a “splash”. . . was a complete dud. An Edsel.

(Nothing to do with the Grateful Dead.) Drawn with a Bic pen back in 1972 and ’73. Richard brought these heads with him to NYC when he moved there in 1974. There were about twenty of them. They were drawn from the heart. “They were probably the first things I did that ever had any soul.” But when Richard reached NYC he wasn’t interested in anything to do with feelings, especially his own. He wanted nothing to do with himself. He wanted to change places with someone else, even just for a day. Just to see what it would be like to be someone else.\n\nSomeone else’s shoes.\n\nHe knew the heads were the real thing, but he didn’t want the real thing. He wanted something realer. Realer than real. A very real real that was a kind of “virtuoso real.” He put the heads away and started living inside other people’s shoes. For twenty years he lived in a lot of shoes.\n\nNext came the Hippie Drawings.\n\n1998.\n\nHe had moved out of NYC by then and had kids, and the honesty that he saw in the drawings that they were making reminded him of his own heads from back in ’72 and ’73. But he wasn’t ready to make something with his own blood. That’s how he explained it: “with my own blood.”\n\nSo after digging his kids’ drawings, he got to thinking of making drawings based on what he thought a hippie would draw. The “basing” (the direction, deflection, substitution . . . whatever you want to call it) was a way he thought he could “get away with” . . . and, at the same time, “get out of the way.”\n\nThe Hippie Drawings that he started making in 1998 and continued to draw for the next couple of years were supposed to be shown in London in early 2000. But, for reasons he can’t explain, he canceled the show and instead just published the catalogue. “At least you had reproductions of the drawings. I was always thinking about the idea of ‘at least’ and ‘almost’ all the time.”\n\nSo that’s what he did. Almost. And at least.\n\nThe gallery he was supposed to show the Hippie Drawings with ended up publishing a book of the Hippie Drawings.\n\nHe put a self-portrait of himself on the cover, from 1968, when he had long hair and a beard. “Yeah, I kind of looked like a hippie, but I wasn’t a hippie. The portrait was about looking, not being.”\n\nNext up, de Kooning.\n\nIn 2004 Richard received a de Kooning catalogue from LA MOCA that Paul Schimmel put together. Richard was spending the summer out east, close to de Kooning’s studio in the Springs. Richard didn’t have a studio. So he took the catalogue and sat in a chair and ripped into it. He “hippified” it.\n\nSome of the de Kooning drawings in the catalogue reminded him of his own Hippie Drawings. De Kooning had style. Richard didn’t. So he used his hippie “pose” and de Kooning’s style, mashed the two together, and started drawing directly in the de Kooning catalogue.\n\nFilled the whole thing up. A new head. A new arm. A leg. He even drew the word “HIPPIE” on the cover. He collaged body parts onto de Kooning’s women. He turned some of de Kooning’s women into men. (The “turn” was what he called “my contribution.”) The contribution was a way of connecting to de Kooning’s women. The connection changed de Kooning’s women into a kind of hybrid. A new gender. Inclusive. All things body. Everything at the same time. Men and women. Women and women. Men and men.\n\nHe says he can’t remember the circumstance or why, but he sent the hippie de Kooning book back to MOCA. There was talk about buying it. But they didn’t. They passed. “Hippie de Kooning” was returned and Richard put it away.\n\nA bunch of years went by, and as years go by, books have a way of hanging around.\n\nHigh Times calls.\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“This is High Times magazine.”\n\nHigh Times magazine called to ask if Richard wanted to do a cover. Something about an anniversary cover. Twenty-fifth anniversary? He doesn’t remember the exact number. But they wanted to know if he could give them some Hippie Drawings for a July cover. Richard was surprised. How did High Times know about the Hippie Drawings? The hanging-around book.\n\nThe only thing Richard knew about High Times was that his friend Glenn O’Brien used to be the editor. “Editor at large.” Glenn coined the term. Richard had never looked at or paged through a copy of the magazine. He wasn’t even aware that it was still being published. “Yeah,” they said. “Bigger than ever. Pot is everywhere. And if it isn’t, it will be.” They wanted to use five different Hippie Drawings and put out five different covers. Richard went with it.\n\nA year after High Times . . . Q-Tip.\n\nQ-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest visits.\n\nQ-Tip asks Richard if he wants to illustrate the Tribe’s new album cover. The Tribe hadn’t put out an album in eighteen years. And Q-Tip wanted a Hippie Drawing for the cover. The bell rings again. How did Q-Tip know about the Hippie Drawings?\n\nGot to be the book. The hanging-around book. If there’s some other explanation, all Richard will say is “beat hippie punk.” Yeah, I know—it’s not even an explanation.\n\nA year to a year and a half later, A Tribe Called Quest’s We Got it from Here . . . Thank You 4 Your Service comes out.\n\nRichard can’t stop playing it. Continued rotation. “The rhymin’ noodle.”\n\nIn the middle of High Times and the Tribe, Richard was working on a body of work he called Super Group.\n\nSuper Group started off simple. One day Richard removed a 33 1/3 rpm record from its sleeve. He held the sleeve in his hand and stared at it. It was paper. It was square. It was foxed. It was yellowed at the edges, and had a hole in it. Even on its own it had inherent meaning. Without thinking Richard took a pencil and signed the sleeve: “To Richard Hell from another Richard Hell.” It was quick. No thought. No intent. Not much of anything. Just reaction. Instant memorabilia. Richard signed the sleeve, framed it, and hung it in his studio. It hung there for a year. After a year of walking back and forth in front of it, Richard went through his record collection and found nine Sonic Youth albums. He removed all the records from their sleeves and gridded and pasted the sleeves with white acrylic paint onto a canvas. He called the painting Nine Sonic Youths. This is a correct title. It’s an accurate title. An accurate description. More of that realer-than-real.\n\nThe different “aging” of the nine sleeves reminded him of Agnes Martin. Not exactly the same, but the look of the painting had that soft minimal off-white tone of Martin’s paintings.\n\nThe next one was the Kinks.\n\nSixteen.\n\nSixteen Kinks.\n\nRichard said he had only three Kinks records in his collection, so he had to go to a used record store to get some more. That changed things. What it changed is going to a used record store. One, he started going more. And two, he wasn’t buying records for the record but for the sleeve the record is in.\n\nRichard started referring to this body of work as the Sleeve Paintings. It was an okay title, but not a really good one.\n\nFast-forward.\n\nSix months after discovering he could buy all kinds of record sleeves on the Internet (as the Sleeve Paintings start to get bigger, this made using sleeves as a background a lot easier than going to a used record store and carting home a shopping bag full of records), Richard came up with the name Super Group.\n\nHe had started writing the names of bands directly onto the sleeves. Writing out the names of groups like Cream and Blind Faith, groups that he grew up with, reminded him of the term used to describe what these two groups were supposed to be:\n\nSUPER GROUP.\n\nThis was better than Sleeve Paintings.\n\nSuper Group was lucky. Another lucky title. Another good title. Another nonfiction title. It fit with what he was making. The fit was perfect. “Perfect is true. Perfect is art.”\n\nIn the summer of 2016 Richard made a painting of four figures that he called his own Super Group. The painting was based on his early Hippie Drawings. The four figures were a made-up band, but “making up” was something Richard was still having trouble with. “Making up is always trouble.”\n\nBy the next summer he was still writing the names of bands on sleeves but he also started adding small hippie-like drawings to the sleeves. The combination of sleeves, names, and drawing made it to Berlin in September 2017, where he had a show called Super Group.\n\nAfter returning from Berlin he stopped writing the names of bands on sleeves and then stopped using sleeves, but he kept on drawing and painting the hippie figures.\n\nBack in 1998 you couldn’t own your own inkjet machine.\n\nBut this was 2017.\n\nAnd every artist he knew had their own machine, and so did Richard.\n\nThe Jet Generation.\n\nRichard started to make inkjet reproductions of his 1998–99 Hippie Drawings.\n\nIt’s got to start somewhere. And that’s where it started. He was appropriating himself. He didn’t put it that way. But that’s the way I can put it.\n\nHis old became new by using new technology.\n\nYou can inkjet on almost any surface . . . paper, canvas, linen, cloth. You can scale what you feed into the jet, big or small. It gives you a head start. The printed image can be redrawn, drawn over, added onto, or collaged with other drawings. A new painting can be rephotographed and that new painting can be fed back into the inkjet and you can print it out and start over. Change it. That’s what jetting is good for. Change. And you can do it quickly. The jet spits out the image on canvas in the morning and by the afternoon with nothing but an oil stick you can mark a new eye, nose, and mouth, and have a whole new painting.\n\nHigh Times.\n\nCalling these new paintings High Times made sense. It was an open title. “Open-ended.” The title was a lifetime of experiences. And besides, someone had already put that title on five of his Hippie Drawings. It wasn’t like Richard thought it up.\n\nFun.\n\n“And it was fun.”\n\nIt was fun making these paintings. “Or at least I thought it was fun.”\n\nThat’s what Richard finally told me. And he told me wasn’t sure if he’d ever had fun making art.\n\nHe couldn’t recall if the emotion or the point of view of “having fun” had ever entered into his past experience of making art.\n\nAnd if it wasn’t fun, so what?\n\nIt was true. And if it wasn’t true, the feelings were true.\n\nFeels good. Something was good again.\n\n“And I’m not sure I’m even pretending.”\n\nAnd not pretending he was cool with.\n\n“Yeah, I was cool with that. It was time. It was time to go back, remind . . . circle back to the ‘dead’ heads and do something that I was born to do.”\n\n“Check it out.”\n\nThe High Times are him.\n\n—Joan Katz\n\nJoan Katz is a writer and has known Richard Prince since 1990 when they were in a band together called Black Bra. She lives and works in Prague.\n\n.\n\nRock Lobster: October 20, 2017\n\nTake my paintings… please.\n\nI’ve been sampled.\n\nThe four painting that are currently hanging at the Lobster Club, 99 East 52nd St., are not mine. Although they are based on paintings I did in 2011-13, they have nothing to do with me.\n\nNada. Zilch. Zero.\n\nI was never consulted. Never asked. And I never gave permission.\n\nIt’s okay.\n\nI’m only dying.\n\nYou can take my work and do anything you want with it.\n\nI will not object. I will not lawyer up. I will not sue.\n\nThe four paintings at the Lobster Club are decorations, fabrications, interpretations, “covers”.\n\nSort of like when a songwriter’s song gets recorded by another singer.\n\nJudy Collins singing Joni Mitchell’s Both Sides Now. (Mitchell has said Collin’s “version” was disappointing, commercial, embarrassing, skinny, “made me wince’, “one sided”.\n\nWhat’s genuine anyway?\n\nMaybe the four paintings at the Lobster Club are a tribute.\n\nLike when fake Kiss bands dress up like Kiss and play Kiss songs.\n\nI’m not sure why an artist would have a “Tribute Artist”, but I think there’s plenty of Led Zeppelin band’s out there trying to be Led Zeppelin. (I’ve heard there’s artists in China painting nurses. Good luck.)\n\n“The paramount concern is not to care.”\n\nT.E. Lawrence said that.\n\nTell me… what should I care about?\n\nAs I’ve said before… there’s always someone out there who’s going to try and make you more popular. More mainstream. More digestible. Palatable. Easy does it. It comes with the territory.\n\nLuckily I don’t have producers, engineers, handlers, contracts. I’m not beholding.\n\nIt’s a free concert.\n\nI’m not looking to tell anybody anything.\n\nI’m not interested in that little “c” in a circle.\n\nWhat me copyright?\n\nAll I ask is that you don’t pawn off mine as mine. Don’t re-make a Richard Prince and pretend it’s a Richard Prince. Own up to it. Give yourself credit. Get your head out of your ass and stop kissing mine.\n\nYou did it, I didn’t.\n\nI hate everybody.\n\nI’m in denial.\n\nI don’t hate anybody.\n\nWant to make art? Don’t\n\nThe Ripple Paintings. 10/26/2017\n\nNot your everyday semi-realistic preparatory plaster castor fresco with a splash of satiric\n\nhumor over a Whitney Darrow caricature.\n\nSidebar: Darrow is one of Richard’s “fab’s”. A longtime New Yorker cartoonist. He was also\n\nJackson Pollock’s roommate.\n\nA little of this. A little of that.\n\nHow hard can it be?\n\nThe Ripple Paintings are in the middle of two bodies of work.\n\nThe first body… Super Group. The third body… High Times.\n\nThe Ripple Paintings were made between 2015 and 2017.\n\nRichard Prince told me “the rips” started off (“Major Tom’d”), by collecting cartoons published\n\nin Playboy. Cartoons that were originally published between the years 1967 and 1970.\n\n“Three years that I remember, revisit, still think about. The turn on, turn up years. The years the\n\ncircle replaced the square. The years the groove moved the twist and the uptight and upright\n\nlost its vote. The years Mr. Jones didn’t know what hit him. These years opened up and let me\n\nout. Man, I felt like I cleaned house. All the phony baloney shot out of my ass. All my life I had\n\nbeen lied too. Now I was awake. I was receptive. And all I needed was something to agree\n\nwith. Between 1967 and 1970 I agreed to say no.”\n\n“I’ve been working on the railroad.”\n\nRichard told me it was a simple idea.\n\n“The cartoons that were submitted to the magazine were watercolors. That’s what was\n\nhanded in, delivered to the art director. It was how they were made. Gouache on illustration\n\nboard. Sketch, wash, and punch line. I bought the magazines on e-bay. I bought thirty-six\n\nissues. I flipped thru the magazine and tore my favorite “toons” out of the magazine, put the\n\ntorn page on the floor, and poured more watercolor on the cartoon. Water on water. My red\n\nwatercolor on their yellow cartoon. Fifty/fifty. My contribution? My psychotic breakdown of\n\nmy psychic connection. Also a contrasting color. My red water on their yellow water. I would\n\ncome back the next morning and my red would dry in its own way. It had personality. Travel,\n\nleak, pool, stains and puddles. And on the way to drying, the dry would ripple the paper. The\n\npour would do its thing. A secret ‘cover’. The drying stayed up all night. Land of a thousand\n\ndances. The spread of my watercolor really didn’t have to do with me. It was independent. The\n\nform had a life of its own, a mind of its own, and each morning after ‘the evaporation’… I got\n\na surprise.”\n\n“Trippy.”\n\nI asked Richard if he could pass The Acid Test.\n\n“Probably not.”\n\n“I’ve always been a fan of Ken Kesey. ‘It’s the truth even if it didn’t happen.’ ‘And when you\n\nlose your laugh you lose your footing.’\n\nBut I’m late to the Grateful Dead. I just started listening.”\n\nThen he went on a little Birdtalk about the Ripples.\n\n“They’re sexy.\n\nHit and miss.\n\nAnyone can find me.\n\nEverybody has to listen to Mom.\n\nBalance.org.\n\nUnmasking? Good luck.\n\nMost of the time I don’t have much fun. The rest of the time I don’t have any fun at all.\n\nQue Sera Sera. (I wish)”\n\nRichard kept telling me it was a stupid idea. I’m not even sure he said “idea”. But he did say\n\n“stupid”. He emphasized the word. Like it was a badge. A medal. An award. “You don’t have to\n\nlook up the word in the dictionary. If you do, your probably not an artist.” He riffed that like it\n\nwas one of his joke paintings.\n\nHe liked that his stupid idea lacked common sense. He repeated. Watercolor on watercolor.\n\n“More water. More color?” It wasn’t a question. It was a fact. And Richard likes to have facts in\n\nhis works. Non-fiction. Something he can point to and name. He likes his titles to be what\n\nthey are. The mistakes are great and he loves making them, but coming up with a name for\n\nthe mistakes has to be a bull’s-eye. It’s about helping. “Don’t get mad. Get glad.” Eliminate the\n\nposture. Eliminate the guessing. The speculation. The subjectivity. Richard doesn’t like politics\n\nof symposium.\n\nA second coat of paint.\n\nThe \"jet\" is nothing but hardware.\n\nRichard knew how he wanted to translate the new covering.\n\nInk jet.\n\nHe’s been using Ink Jet since 1985.\n\nHe told me back in ’85 there were only two places in the country you could “send away” for\n\nan ink jet print.\n\n“It was primitive. Four colors sprayed out on a glossy tarp. The interpretation wasn’t very\n\nsophisticated and the reproduction of what you wanted reproduced was usually dull, cheap,\n\nand not very accurate.”\n\nA lot has changed. Now you can have your own machine and instead of sending away to a\n\ncommercial lab, you can spend the afternoon typing and coding exactly what you want and\n\nwatch what comes out in your own space. Echo. Soul. Emotion. The three ghosts are like\n\nCasper. Friendly. Convenient too. Immediate. No waiting. “No saving up box tops and sending\n\nthem off to Battle Creek Michigan.”\n\n“Ancient footprints are everywhere.\n\nYou can almost think that you’re seein’ double.\n\nSomeday, everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody.”\n\nThere are all kinds of canvas and paper you can put through the printer, and the way the ink\n\njets out... is fast, sweet, positive. It’s like some kind of new carburetor blending air and\n\ninjecting fuel into a proper ratio. It bursts out a combustion of implausible liquid juice.\n\n“Mine has a Holley and nitrous oxide. It’s a clean machine. It’s not a miracle, but it does the\n\njob.”\n\n“I’ll take my chances.”\n\n“Electronic scissor.”\n\nRichard tells me that’s how he use to describe re-photography back in 1977.\n\nAnd cartoons?\n\nHe’s been dealing with the subject since 1985.\n\n“I wanted something to draw, so I re-drew cartoons.”\n\n“I love cartoons. Funny drawings. Serious humor. Subversive. Laugh out loud. Another way of\n\nsurviving. They’re part of the magazine. And I’ve always liked to open up a magazine and see\n\nwhat’s up. Every magazine is an Inside World.”\n\nPaintings R Us.\n\nAfter the jet, the canvas is stretched by Kevin from Philadelphia. “He’s the man with the plan.”\n\nThis might not mean much, but the image of what’s printed is wrapped around the edge of\n\nthe stretcher an eighth inch. It’s not on top, it's around. Not much around, but around. Just\n\nenough. Formalism? Okay. Ingredients matter. But I think Richard would describe it more like\n\nhomework. That little 1/8 counts. Without it, the painting is a B-plus. When I went to his studio\n\nto see the paintings, it’s all he would talk about. But he didn’t think it was important to anyone\n\nbut him. He’s resigned. He knew that the viewer, the audience... wouldn’t pay attention.\n\nWhat’s forward and impactful for him is function and pleasure. The combination is in the\n\ndetails. Discovery takes time. He went on to say, “What’s underneath, the subtext, the “wild\n\nhistory”… can take years. People are bouncing. That’s what people do these days. The\n\nelectric stampede is so jammed up you need to stream Einstein’s pipe to go to sleep. What\n\ncan I say? How about the caption in that cartoon?” (He points to a Ripple that’s covered in a\n\nfracture of purple blaze). ‘In dreams begin responsibility.’\n\nBig pieces of color.\n\nThat’s what the Ripples are. How do you make a new abstract painting? That’s the last thing I\n\nasked Richard.\n\n“I don’t know,” he said.\n\n“I don’t think that way. How do I make? I go to work. I go to my studio. Shut the door and\n\nlisten to Wilco.”\n\nThere’s a pause. He looks at his shoes. He lifts one foot off the floor.\n\n“I can only stand this way for so long. After awhile I start to wobble.”\n\nI’m not sure what he means. Then he’s back. Where did he go?\n\n“But yea, abstraction. One thing leads to another. Sometimes I get lucky. Hilma af Klint. She\n\nbelonged to the five. A circle of women that tried to get in touch with the high masters. Not\n\none master but several. Intuition. Alchemy. Séance. We’re talking 1906. Her spiritual non\n\n-objective paintings pre-dated Kandinsky. She ate Kandinsky’s heart out. She died after a\n\ntraffic accident. I take that knowing into my studio. I take everything I can get. So of course,\n\nabstraction. The absence of consequences. What do they say?...‘painting the unseen’. So yea.\n\nBut I like a good story better.”\n\nJoan Katz\n\nJoan Katz is a journalist, living in Prague, who has known Richard Prince since 1989. In 1990 Prince and Katz formed a band called Black Bra when they were both living in Rome.\n\nSuper Group 10/24/2017\n\n“When I came here today, there was something true.” Wilco\n\nSuper Group is the first of three bodies of work. They go together. Have something in common. Themes. Stories. What I know. What I like. What I like to know. What I want to know. Knows and looks that have to do with music and counter culture.\n\nThe second body is The Ripple Paintings.\n\nThe third is High Times.\n\nThe title Super Group came to me about a year ago. But the “came” really started in 1990 when I was in my own band, Black Bra.\n\nI was living in Rome working in a stone cold studio and I teamed up with Joan Katz, aka Annie Anne. She played drums and terrorist and I played guitar and friend. We called ourselves Black Bra and played twice in public. The music we played was based on a song I wrote in the winter of 1986. I played the song on a Casio keyboard and recorded it on cassette in my bedroom. The song was about heebie-jeebies, humiliation, and existential agony. I called the song LOUD SONG. (I tried recording the loudest song ever recorded in my bedroom, while living in Venice California, after leaving NYC because I thought I was having a mental breakdown after I was kicked out of my girlfriends apartment where I would drink ice cold vodka all night and watch porn on VHS tapes I could rent from a downstairs video rental store called The World Of Video). LOUD SONG was eighteen minutes long. It’s the only song Black Bra ever played. It was supposed to crack you open and ring your lights out. TKO. It was supposed to be ten times bigger then the Velvets Sister Ray. I think twenty people saw and heard us. One of them was Gregory Corso. Beat poet. Writer of Gasoline. Friend of Ginsberg. I remember him. Dead reckoning remember. There was speculation about his reputation, but no reliable information. He looked like his reputation. As they say, “his reputation preceded him”.\n\nJoan and I grouped for three months. I split back for NYC and she moved to Prague. We’ve stayed in touched and she recently interviewed me and wrote my press release for my Ripple Paintings.\n\nTrans-Media\n\nSix years ago I took a sleeve out of a vinyl album and looked at it and liked the foxing, the beige color, the yellowing, the creases, the weight of the paper, the two- sidedness of the construction and the hole. It also had inherited meaning.\n\nI picked up a pencil and signed it to myself from Richard Hell. I wrote, “From One Richard To Another, Richard Hell 1977”. It wasn’t real, but it was real for me.\n\nAnother start.\n\nI glued the sleeve to an album size canvas and hung it on my studio wall.\n\nI kept it there for another year. This was like 2008.\n\nInstant Karma.\n\nNothing much happened after that. I kept looking at the Richard Hell sleeve. And kept thinking about making more but the idea of turning record sleeves into fake memorabilia didn’t really excite me.\n\nIn 2011 I was checking out my collection of Sonic Youth Albums. I pulled out the records and removed the records from the sleeves. There were nine sleeves. I laid out the sleeves in a grid, three on top of three on top of three. Another square. I looked at it and called it Nine Sonic Youths. That excited me. The name, the title connected the abstraction and made it less abstract. It looked like art. It looked like an Agnes Martin with holes. It was creamy.\n\nWant to make art? Don’t.\n\nThe next one I did was 16 Kinks.\n\nI only had six Kink albums so I had to go out to a vinyl store and buy ten more Kinks. Going to the record store changed. It wasn’t just about buying albums. There was a new purpose to going to a record store.\n\nOn-purpose.\n\n16 Kinks was the first time I started calling them the Sleeve Paintings.\n\nThe next was the Beatles.\n\nI did 87 Beatles.\n\n9 Sonic Youth and 16 Kinks were simply pasted.\n\nThe property of the sleeves weren’t touched. The difference in their individuality wasn’t messed with. Their tones were all that mattered. I was making something basic. Really simple. The given patterns and ‘aging’ was what I was looking at.\n\nPreferred.\n\nThe Beatles were the first sleeves I painted. There were so many I used a two-part canvas and the way I stuck them to the canvas was with white and off white acrylic paint. Things got messy. Fits and starts. There were mistakes made and I had so many sleeves to choose from, I would rip some off and put other ones in their place. I had like fifteen copies of Revolver. Using paint as glue became a happy ingredient. The right ingredient. I went to town. “Sargent Pepper told the band to play.” I was ripping it up.\n\nRave On.\n\nAfter the 87 Beatles, I worked on a small canvas and started to use 45 “single” sleeves and paid attention to sleeves that had lyrics printed on them. I also discovered you could order sleeves over the internet. The mail ordering changed the making.\n\nI could order hundreds of sleeves. Black ones. White ones. One’s that looked like the color of a manila envelope.\n\nI was listening to Chuck Berry and wrote down his lyric “riding along in my automobile” on a sleeve.\n\nScribing lyrics.\n\nIt made the idea of “collecting” more important. Prominent.\n\nThe meaning of Soul Music according to Rapheal Saadiq.\n\nI did a whole painting of the Doors.\n\nI drew the distinctive “font” of the Doors.\n\nI did the same with the Def Leppard font.\n\nAt first I was uncomfortable with my handwriting additions.\n\nIt was hard to break away from the minimal look of 16 Kinks.\n\nThen the idea of framing my new hands on applications helped me with my indecisiveness.\n\nThey were works on papers. You usually frame works on paper. Once I made that connection, the glass and frame made sense. Obvious? Sure. Of course. Sometimes. Why don’t you try it.\n\nMost of the time you swing and miss. When you finally hit it you wonder what took you so long.\n\nLooking at what I listened too.\n\nSo that’s what happened.\n\nFrom Louis Prima to Tex Ritter to Johnny Cash to Howlin Wolf to Procol Harum to Ten Years After to Fairport Convention to Sam Kinison to Sam Cook to The Chamber Brothers to Boots Randolph to Laura Nero to the Germs to Jim O’Rourke to Brazilian Ecstasy to Paul Revere and the Raiders to Jonnine Standish to Larry Heard to Silent Servant to Schooly D to NWA to the Kingston Trio to Allan Sherman to T-Rex to Lydia Lunch to A Tribe Called Quest.\n\nAnd when The Tribe showed up in early spring, 2016, the story of the sleeves entered another dimension.\n\nQ-Tip came to the studio and liked a black and white sleeve painting that had nothing on it. What he pointed to was new. It was a 48-inch square template that I had started ink jetting… using the pattern of twenty-four paper sleeves as a starting point. I printed out the same pattern eight times. The printing was on a rubbery canvas that felt like the wax of a record. The plan was to use the same eight patterns to draw on, make marks, sign and stick them with names like The Smiths, The MC5 and Booker T and M.G.’s. (The “stickers” were those labels that keep the CD in their plastic container).\n\nI was dee-jaying the sleeves with ink jet.\n\nThe Ramen Noodle.\n\nQ-Tip asked me if I wanted to do his next album cover. The Tribe hadn’t put out an album in 18 years.\n\nHe pointed to the blank template and asked if I could put a “hippie drawing” on it. I was surprised. A hippie drawing. How did he know? I did the hippie drawings back in 1998. How did he know about the hippie drawings? I never asked.\n\nExpiration date: The Hippie Drawings never really had an expiration date.\n\nI went over to Q-Tip’s place in New Jersey. Five minutes across the George Washington Bridge. Went to the basement. Showed him some mock-ups. Some preliminary ideas. Some VU renderings that had one foot in the hippie drawings and another in the smoke of a new strain that would hopefully entertain and extend the feelings that the hippie drawings were supposed to relieve.\n\nThe summer before, High Times Magazine asked to put some hippie drawings on some kind of anniversary issue. They put out five covers. Maybe Q-Tip saw some of the issues. Again, I didn’t ask. I was on assignment. I usually turn down requests that are this specific. It’s hard to repeat a vibe. Especially one that’s twenty years old. What I didn’t know that afternoon, after I drew all the Tribes portraits, and “hipped” them with 1500 colors… what I didn’t know, (again, I didn’t know) what I didn’t know… was that when I’d go back over the George Washington, back to the drawing board, (back to the garden), I’d make my own group portrait. The portrait would consist of four figures. The four figures were my own made up band. I called the portrait SUPER GROUP.\n\nThe sleeve paintings had a new name.\n\nSupergroup is a music group whose members are already successful as solo artists or, as part of other groups or well known in other musical professions.\n\nWhat is a supergroup?\n\nThere have to be at least three members.\n\nThey have to have released at least one album… no all-star jams.\n\nThe majority of the band members have to have been in well-known bands BEFORE the supergroup formed. I didn’t make this up. You can look it up.\n\nA Perfect Circle.\n\nMr. Big.\n\nOysterhead.\n\nChickenhead.\n\nDown.\n\nThem Crooked Vultures.\n\nDamn Yankees.\n\nAsia.\n\nThe Firm.\n\nTemple of the Dog.\n\nBlack Country Communion.\n\nBlue Murder.\n\nBlind Faith.\n\nThese bands are considered part of the top twenty Super Groups of all time. I included Blind Faith because I’ve never heard of the others.\n\nCream started it. The first Super Group.\n\nI went to see Cream in Boston at the Boston Tea Party in 1967. I think it was 1967. All I remember is how loud they were.\n\nEric Clapton. Jack Bruce. Ginger Baker. When the album came out I starred at it. I’d never seen people who looked like Cream.\n\nI’m so out of tune.\n\nDoing the Tribe’s album cover.\n\nAnother direction.\n\nThe language shifted. The shift became shapes. The shapes became figurative. Taking up where I left off.\n\nThe hippie figures exaggerated. Epaulets, feathers, embroidery, tie-dye, patches, and fringe. Crack up, head start, oompf. Excuse me… spiraling. Crash, out of control, bender. Nosebleeds. Tooth decay. Smiles wide open. I tried to do what the cover of Cream did for me. I tried to make figures I had never seen before.\n\nAll the bands I started to paint became Super Groups.\n\nThe title fit. It was perfect. I got lucky. And I could point to these new paintings and call them what they were. They had an identity. They had weight. They were freer.\n\nThey were free wild.\n\nOne or the other.\n\nI’ll settle for spirit.\n\nThe song Spirit In The Sky, by Norman Greenbaum, is used on at least thirty-five movie soundtracks. Miami Blues is my favorite. Early Alec Baldwin. Early Jennifer Jason Leigh. Based on the book by Charles Willeford.\n\n“Sometimes you get what you need.”\n\nSupergroup is what I needed. And sometimes what you need is all you need.\n\nI’d been working with sleeves on and off for four years, they weren’t right, they weren’t finished. They didn’t have extra extra. They had a verse and bridge but they didn’t have a hook.\n\nSuper Group became the hook. Sum, total, whole.\n\nI can stack Roy Orbison, Chuck D, Bill Evans, Patsy Cline, The Pretenders, and Lee Renaldo on one sleeve.\n\nStandard. Staple. Classic. Popular.\n\nThe whole sleeve can be a hit.\n\n“Playing Kiss covers beautiful and stoned”.\n\nWilco background.\n\nI’ve never listened to Kiss. But I’ve used their images on paintings I made in the late ninety’s. I printed all four members faces and sent them away to a check making company and started to write Kiss checks to the electrical company. I paid my mortgage with them. I wrote out a Gene Simmons to my psychiatrist. I waited to get them back at the end of each month. Cancelled. Cancelled checks. I put them in draws. I treated them like a secret diary. The Kiss checks were cartoons. Each of the bands persona’s were supposed to be a superhero. Kiss was part of the end of arena rock. Punk made them irrelevant. At least that’s what I’m told. It’s odd now that there’s Kiss fan clubs that show up to Comic Con. Comic Con is huge. It’s like the new acid test. I don’t think there’s any Sex Pistol fan clubs at Comic Con.\n\nOff the beaten path.\n\nGod-knows-where.\n\nFar out.\n\nI’m not sure where I’m going with this. Why am I telling you this? And who are you that I’m telling?\n\nTell me everything.\n\nI made checks out of five images of Sid Vicious. I only wrote out one Sid Vicious check. It was to Cumberland Farms for five dollars and sixty-five cents. It’s dated 2004.\n\nWhy Cumberland Farms? Why of all the things or places would I write the one and only Sid Vicious check to Cumberland Farms?\n\nGood Question.\n\nI was thinking of making it out to Stewart’s, or even Agway… but in the end I thought “the farms” was what my friend, the impresario Malcolm Mclaren, would of approved of. Sure, the Gap probably would’ve been a more smooth fuse, but Malcolm had no way of knowing how much I loved his Duck Rock.\n\n“I’m worried, I’m always in love.”\n\nMore Wilco background.\n\nPersona refers to a theatrical mask. A character that’s presented in public that’s perceived by others. The word means many things. A semblance. A new guise.\n\nI’m with the band.\n\nBack in the late seventies I played in a band called Guise. But the first night we played publicly, the flyer we wheat pasted below Canal Street, Guise got crossed out and we wrote in Guy’s.\n\nThe we in the group was me and my friend Frank Schroeder.\n\nFrank is an artist and had a floor thru loft on Chambers. Big. Windows on Duane to windows on Chambers. He was locked in to sweet lease. Grandfathered. It’s where we practiced. We both played guitar. We played at Tier 3, on West Broadway near White.\n\nGuy’s lasted one night.\n\nA week later I played another one night-stand at Jenny Holzer’s loft on Broadway. Just me. Solo. I was friends with Kim Gordon and she was living in Jenny’s loft. She designed my flyer. She called my band HIM. I think I wanted to call it Hymn but Kim changed it to HIM.\n\nI was way to self-conscious to play more than one night. I didn’t have the drive. I didn’t have the belief. And I was truly uncomfortable, (in my own skin), to pull off any kind of meaningful relationship with the same twenty people who showed up to these no wave party’s.\n\nCollaboration.\n\n“Collab” could of have been a good name for a Super Group.\n\nA lot of artists were in bands back in late seventies and early ‘80’s. Forming and reforming and trying to penetrate… lift off. I think mostly, it was a distraction from working in the studio all day. A chance to release fucked up, pent up, up to nothing, physical energy.\n\nArt bands.\n\nBush Tetras. Mars. Erasers. Y-Pants. DNA. 8-Eyed Spy. Live Skull. Blurt.\n\nI remember a lot of posing.\n\nHow do you get to Carnegie Hall?\n\nThe most serious was Glenn Branca.\n\nHis band was drums and at least seven people playing guitars. Every artist I knew who played guitar, played in his band. You usually lasted four weeks. He would come to your place and teach you the part he wanted you to play. There was no room for improv. It was his music. And you played it his way. He called his compositions Symphonies. Alternative tunings. Repetition. Harmonic drones. And when we went on stage, he conducted.\n\nGlenn had a following. A downtown following. Even Lower Manhattan. He was a staple at the Kitchen. I remembered once we opened up for Laurie Anderson at Harrah’s.\n\nFrank was in the band that night. Wharton Tiers. Jules Baptiste. Jeffery Glenn. Glenn’s drummer up to then was always Stephan Wischerth.\n\n(Sidebar: Stephan was a plumber by day. He would come over and fix your pipes. Instead of him giving you a bill, he’d take art. In the mid-80’s he did some plumbing for me and I gave him a print of Spiritual America).\n\nAnyway, back to Harrah’s, the B-side.\n\nI had brought Jeffery Glenn into the band. Jeff wasn’t an artist. Jeff was a straight- ahead rock and roller. With no patience for anything but John B. Good.\n\nBranca needed someone who could play fast that night. No time to bring him up to speed. In other words, he needed someone with talent. Jeffery filled the bill. Jeffery was a former roommate. I asked him. It was a favor.\n\nHalf-way thru the performance, I looked over at Jeffery and we both nodded. We heard something. The same thing. We heard a new kind of rock’n roll. We both recognized what we were hearing was something searing, loud, an exceptional sonic sound that neither of us was familiar with. What we heard was a mixed tape of Suicide, Philip Glass, and The Stooges. Kick out the jams, arm and hammer, bad manners… none of that begins to describe what our ears were filling up with. But I could tell it was filling up with SOMETHING. The music that night was top of the pops. It was towering.\n\nBut after we stopped, and came off stage, I knew I couldn’t tell Glenn Branca.\n\nHe wouldn’t want to hear what we heard. He didn’t care about the excitement we felt. “The new place.” The new hole we just ripped open. It was his band. His music. And nothing that came out of all those guitars was going to change the way he wanted his music to mean to him. Branca was the maestro. He was the real deal. He was an artist. You’ve got to respect that.\n\nI was out after that night.\n\nI quit.\n\nI knew deep down I was just a tourist.\n\nI didn’t play in another band for ten years.\n\nI heard a couple of weeks after I left, Thurston Moore joined Branca’s band.\n\nI just read the first couple of reviews of Super Group.\n\n“The works echo through the spaces like reverb.”\n\n“Prince replicates lyrics and band names, like the Smiths or the Roots, and memorializes them in new constellations.”\n\n“The works in ‘Super Group’ are like schizophrenic totems.”\n\n“The new works also recall the Hippie Drawings Prince created in the early 2000s. Having come so far in his career, it seems only logical. No celebrity is safe from the hands of Richard Prince… not even himself.”\n\nNot even myself.\n\nI should say for the past five Xmas vacations I’ve been learning to play the Ukulele.\n\nYoo-ka-LAY-lee.\n\nHawaiian.\n\nLet me humor you.\n\nLet me tell you about the time I visited my Dad when he was stationed in Honolulu Hawaii.\n\n1966.\n\nI was a junior in high school.\n\nI stayed with my Dad for a month at the YMCA.\n\nHe worked for the government and was going back and for between the big island and Vietnam. What he was doing in Vietnam was “top secret”. I can only guess but I’ve speculated that he was defoliating the jungle so our soldiers could see the enemy. What did I know? He was my Dad. He said he was an electrical engineer. That’s what he always said.\n\nDon Ho’s Tiny Bubbles was on all the radio stations. Ho was a big cheese in Honolulu. Had his own nightclub.\n\nMy Dad called Ho the Dean Martin of Hawaii.\n\nMy Dad also told me he loved Vietnam. And Vietnamese women.\n\nI think he was in seventh heaven for the first time in his life.\n\nGood for you Dad.\n\nThere’s a cartoon I re-drew in 1985 that reminds me of my father. The cartoon is of a girl carrying a protest sign that says PEACE. She’s walking out her front door, passing her father on the way out. He’s sitting in a chair holding a newspaper. He’s looking at her. The caption of the cartoon says… ANY LUCK?\n\nDuring the last few days of my stay in Honolulu I started hanging around, going to parties with soldiers that were on R&R. Soldiers who rotated back from Nam for two weeks of rest and recreation. Most of the soldiers were two years older than me.\n\nThey told me I should enlist when I turned eighteen.\n\n“We’re having a ball. When you come over, be sure to sign up as dental assistant. That way you can smoke all the weed you want and not get your ass shot off.”\n\nThe last night I was there, there was a big bonfire. Right on Waikiki.\n\nEverybody was in bathing suits and bikinis.\n\nThere were five, six, maybe even ten people playing acoustic guitars.\n\nThey were strumming and belting out “If I had a hammer”.\n\nI was in the middle of a huge hootenanny.\n\nBy the next summer, the love of San Francisco would boil over and R&R would replace Peter Paul and Mary’s Hoot with Hendrix’s Experience.\n\nCrimson Flames.\n\nI just collected two things Dylan.\n\nCollecting. A wonderful curse.\n\nI’m a bibliophile. The smell, look, feel of books. Tattered, musty, the one’s with the unsophisticated dust-jackets.\n\n“So what if I love books more than people”… is one of the definitions of a bibliophile.\n\nThe first Dylan I just collected.\n\nThe original drawing that Milton Glaser did for Bob Dylan’s Greatest Hits. 1966. Black India ink on paper with color Cello-Tak applications signed in typeset text in the upper right hand margin matted and framed. 9 ¼ x 12 inches.\n\nThe portrait is based on a 1957 self-portrait by Marcel Duchamp and the psychedelic movement at the time. Approximately six million prints made from the drawing were distributed with the enormously popular album. Any Dylan fan knows this poster. It’s the one with the rainbow hair.\n\nWhy do I have it? Why do I need it?\n\nI could say something like I’m frightened of real experience, but let’s just say BECAUSE I HAVE TO.\n\nSuper Sleeve.\n\nThe second Dylan I bought…\n\nEleven original acetate recordings by Bob Dylan from 1962, owned by record producer John H Hammond… who signed Dylan to Columbia Records and produced Dylan’s eponymous debut album. While there were thirteen songs on the released album, only discs for the first eleven songs seem to have survived. The first acetate, “You’re No Good”, has a spoken word introduction that did not make it onto the final album and is not in circulation. The acetates are each 10” single-song recordings, and represent the first time Dylan’s music made it onto disc.\n\nEach acetate has its own sleeve, the side and track number and also Dylan’s name and Columbia’s “CO” number notated in pencil are on the upper left, and J Hammond, also in pencil, is on the upper right. Much of the same information is written on each disc in grease pencil, where a label would ordinarily be. You can’t play an original acetate more than four or five times. I’m told after the fifth play the sound starts to disappear. If you play it like seven times the sound is gone.\n\nBringing it all back home.\n\nRight now I’d really like to listen to Curtis Mayfield’s Superfly.\n\n\"Tryin’ ta get over.\"\n\nMay 18, 2017\n\n\"New Arrangements\"\n\nBuzz-Hut.\n\nCollege Freakz.\n\nDogsome.\n\nTimezoff.\n\nTaboola.\n\nOutbrain.\n\nYou may also like...\n\nJanuary 13, 2017\n\n“Yippy, we’re all going to die.”\n\nCountry Joe and the Fish.\n\nLong time ago.\n\nI was there.\n\nAnd it did feel like we were going to die. Especially after the Kent State shootings. Me and friends really thought Nixon and Agnew were going to pull the plug. Overthrow. A military “coup d’état.” We were freaked. We made plans to split for the woods. We were already in Maine, so we didn’t have to split that far. We didn’t exactly know how we were going to deal with the exile, but we felt we needed to counterattack. Lock and load. Recon. All these weird opposites of “peace now” were messing with our heads. And it wasn’t movie shit. It was messing with us because the opposites were real.\n\nOur model was Castro when he went up into the jungles of Cuba to fight Baptista. Guerrilla warfare. We didn’t exactly know how to go about being guerrillas, but we had no choice. We were art students. What the fuck did we know about ammunition, sabotage, ambush, camouflage. All we knew was how we felt. We had had enough. We were pissed off and fed up with marches and protests and needed to survive and fight. We probably would have been rounded up and had our asses thrown in jail before we even pitched our tents… but our backs were against the wall and “live free or die” wasn’t just some phony slogan on the flag of our sister state of New Hampshire. Something. Anything. Even if it was lowering that declaration to half mast.\n\nTimes, they are a changing?\n\nI used to think they were.\n\nBut now?\n\nI’m not so sure.\n\nThe times are dark and dangerous and Up Against the Wall Motherfucker is as relevant as it was when the MC5 kicked out the jams back in Ann Arbor, in 1970.\n\nI still think like an art student.\n\nThat will never change.\n\nI don’t give a shit and never have.\n\nReckless?\n\nYes.\n\nConsequences?\n\nCareless and irresponsible are always in a jar by the door.\n\nWhat’s in the jar gets shacked and mixed into something that can’t be named.\n\nWhat am I trying to say?\n\nArtists are free.\n\nI know I am.\n\nWhen Picasso painted Guernica and a Nazi walked in to his studio and asked Picasso, “did you paint that?” Picasso said, “no… you did”.\n\nTruth?\n\n“You can’t handle the truth.”\n\nLegend?\n\n“If you can’t print the truth, print the legend.”\n\nOn 11/18/2014, I sold Ivanka Trump an ink jet instagram portrait (of her) for 36k.\n\nIt was sort of a commission.\n\nI don’t know who asked me if I would consider doing her “portrait”, but I said let me look at her “feed” and I’ll let you know.\n\nI let them know.\n\nYes.\n\nI’ll do it.\n\nI had never met her. Didn’t know much about her. But she posted a lot of pictures of herself on her instagram account… the kind of pictures that I thought looked like “new portraits”… (meaning?) the kinds of pictures that seem to exist only on instagram and pictures that let me imagine what she might be like.\n\nI picked one where she was sitting in a chair getting her hair done. Her hair was in\n\ncurlers. The “image” looked good, made up, believable… it look like it was fun. And the mostimportant part… IT LOOKED LIKE WHAT I WANTED HER TO LOOK LIKE.\n\nYesterday, I “birded” on Twitter that her portrait that I made of her was no longer mine. I didn’t do it. That it was a fake portrait. I also sent the money she paid for the portrait, back.

I felt like I had a choice in an area where there are no choices.\n\nI made the art. And I can unmake the art.\n\nIt’s simple. I don’t want anything to do with the Trumps. And I don’t want them to have anything to do with me. Redacting Ivanka Trump’s portrait was an honest choice between right and wrong.\n\nRight is art.\n\nWrong is no art.\n\nThe Trumps are no art.\n\n9/10/2015\n\n\"Question Painting: \"Don't Fence Me In\" was written by Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, Joe Walsh?\"\n\nFrom an excerpt entitled \"Cowboy\", to be published on September 26th.\n\n8/15/2015\n\nClarence \"Cash\" Coolidge contributed two pretty interesting things to culture.

They were all brand new. I had just taken them out of a box that was shipped from Iceland where they were published. John McWhinney had spent a year looking for a country to publish the book, and when we finally got the finished edition we looked at each other… smiled… and without saying a word, knew it was perfect.\n\nCather In The Rye by Richard Prince.\n\nJohn and I were huge fans of Salinger’s first novel, it’s publishing history, and it’s rarity. Re-reading the book, which came out in 1951, was like reading prose that sometimes shows up in periodicals like Esquire and Rolling Stone. We were always astounded how contemporary the writing was. The style was up to date. Salinger’s voice was conversational, straightforward, and believable. There was nothing ornamental or extraordinary about it. The slang and profanity, ahead of its time. It was kind of like reading an essay by Joan Didion. Or a review by Luc Sante. Or better yet, a long short story by Reynolds Price.\n\nCalifornia dreaming.\n\nJohn spent a year trying to find a country that would replicate Salinger’s novel. There would only be two changes to the book. The first, substituting my name for Salinger’s. The second, doubling the price. (Actually there was a third change… sort of. We removed the author’s photograph from the back cover. We had heard when the book first came out Salinger didn’t like his portrait on the book and made sure the publicity picture never appeared on the second and all subsequent editions. Hey, if he didn’t like it… we didn’t either.)\n\nWhen we held “our” version in our hands it felt good. It was right. ALL RIGHT. The paper. The weight. The beige “cream” color on the dust jacket was spot on. Killer. It all made sense. The look of it made us feel happy. We enjoyed it. Everything about the object was considered.\n\nWe decided early on to put it out under our own imprint. Instead of Little Brown, we came up with AP, which stood for American Place. (I guess that’s a fourth change). We didn’t know until after we got the book printed, that American Place was what Alfred Stieglitz called his gallery in 1926. A strange and nice surprise. Both feelings came at the same time. We couldn’t of asked for a better association. Stieglitz’s “Spiritual America” photograph of a gelded horse that I ended up titling my Brooke Shields photograph back in ‘83 made the surprise and nice feeling feel like good karma.\n\nBack to the garden.\n\nCather In The Rye, by Richard Prince was shrink-wrapped. We brought a bunch to Central Park and started selling them. I’m pretty sure its legal to sell used books on the sidewalks of New York. I’m positive. I’m not sure if my ‘Catcher’ qualified as a “used book.” It certainly was an original book. A “new” book. But it also could be described as “another” or “almost” book. I figured if anybody tried to put me on the spot I could always say, “its sculpture.”\n\nWe didn’t think much about whether the police would come and tell us to wrap it up, take a walk, arrest, or ask for a vendor’s license. As I recall, we didn’t get any interference or hassle from police at all. A two-man patrol walked by, looked down, looked at me, and one of the officers said, “You always help out around here with the chores?”\n\nThat was it.\n\nUnbelievable.\n\nStraight out of “Clothes Line Saga.”\n\nI swear.\n\nI nearly fell off the bench.\n\nThe corner of Fifth and 79th is populated. A steady flow of people walking by. I can’t remember the first one we sold. Or why the person bought it. Whoever it was, we didn’t know them or why or what they thought they were buying. It felt like we were hatching. We’d been sitting on an egg for a year and it finally cracked open. Howling or Howl. Out it came. What we put out had already been out. In the words of Allen Ginsburg meets Lord Buckley meets Bob Dylan meets Sam Kinison, meets Soupy Sales, meets NWA meets the Flaming Lips… “a bird in the hand is like what?… a baker’s dozen?”\n\nJames Frey stopped by and started hawking the book. Talking up customers like he was a bible salesman. He sold five in ten minutes. He had a rap, a pitch. It was like he was selling Listerine, toothpaste, chewing gum. People started showing up that we knew. Word spread thru text messaging, E-mail, photo sharing. Harper Levine. Frank Moore. Glenn O’Brien. Andy Spade. Adam Lindemann came by and wanted to buy the eight copies we had left.\n\nMy plan was to show up once a week, same day, same time, same place, until all three hundred copies were gone.\n\nThe price of the book was sixty-two dollars. (It’s printed on the inside flap… double the price for the exact same book at Barnes & Noble). If you asked, I would initial the book on the back. (No extra charge for my two initials). If you wanted it signed you would have to fork over seventy-five thousand dollars. If you wanted it inscribed… two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.\n\nI know… crazy. But these “premium” prices weren’t arbitrary. They were in line with what you would normally pay for a real Catcher In The Rye if the Catcher was a first edition and it was signed or inscribed. As far as anybody knows there’s never been an inscribed Catcher with a dust jacket. Ever. Not a single one has been recorded or sold. The Library of Congress doesn’t have one. The Morgan. The Rare Book Division of the New York Public Library. Never, no one, anywhere. In forty years of collecting rare books I’ve never come across a Cather that’s has the whole package. Signature, inscription, unrestored dust jacket. I’m still looking. Waiting. Hoping. Holly grail.\n\nThe selling of my Catcher was easy, different, fun to do. But it only happened once. I ended up not returning to the corner of Fifth and 79th. The energy wasn’t there. I was nervous. Who knows? I didn’t want to be “in person.” The first time was the best time and anything after, felt like business. There was some talk about taking over one of those plastic booth’s at Dunkin Donuts on Lex and 88th St. “America Runs On Dunkin.” Sit and have a cup of coffee and stack up a pile of ten books on the table. I thought about that for a while, came close… chose not to… didn’t follow thru. Felt it might be more of a performance than distributing a book. I did however set up in front Rodney Dangerfield’s Comedy Club on Third and 58th St. I put my blanket down in front of the shuttered club and spent about twenty minutes. Nervous. I asked Fabiola, who ran Fulton Ryder, my publishing company, to come along and take photos. It was more like a photo op. I put on a black suit. White shirt. I even wore a vest. I ended up editing Fabiola’s shoot and put one of her photos on Instagram. It’s a shot of me standing on one leg with the other propped up against the building, my gaze is in profile, looking left, downtown. I’m holding one of the Catcher’s, the rest of them “artfully” arranged on the blanket. If you look closely, there’s a caricature of Rodney Dangerfield and an 8X10 publicity pic of Chris Rock in the window of the club behind me. The photo of me on Instagram is an Instagram photo.\n\nI don’t think I knew at the time what Salinger’s real story was. I didn’t get him until his bio came out a couple of years later. I’d always associated Holden Caufield’s character and teenage problems, as a coming of age story. I didn’t realize Holden’s story was a war story. A story about World War II. A story about survival. I didn’t know that Salinger went ashore somewhere in Normandy on D-day and spent 245 days in combat and ended up walking into a concentration camp and seeing the bloodless shrunken bodies of countless dead Jews piled up like garbage. I didn’t know any of that. The sight. The smell. The memory. The madness. How do you know where to begin to deal with that kind of killing and murder? How do you come to terms with genocide… atrocity? Do you believe what you’re seeing? And if you do… do you even know what it is that you’re witnessing? This harvest took place in a town in Germany. A regular town. It’s the forties. Civilized. Educated. Cosmopolitan. It’s all gone. It’s all been wiped out by fanatical goose-stepping grownups. Super race. Aryans. What’s an Aryan?\n\nAfter Germany surrendered I learned that Salinger checked himself into a mental ward in Berlin. When he got out, he married a woman who was part of the Gestapo. Yes. It’s true. Do you do that? Do you marry your enemy? Yes. You do that. Why? Guilt. Shame. Control. A way of dealing, coping, with love and hate. You’ve been crapped on for almost a year. Your covered in shit. You try to wipe it off. Maybe it’s that simple. You marry the thing you’ve been trying to kill for eight months and then you take a hot shower. After the wash, the soap, the rinse, the dry… you write a book about children. “An ancient child of sixteen.” Someone who’s attracted to beauty and in the end “hopelessly” crucified by the attraction. The child keeps most of his pain for himself and invites the reader to share it, handle it, take it over and keep it.\n\nAnd then what?\n\nWhat do you do after your book is a “best seller” and puts you into the driver’s seat? You retreat. You get yourself a little piece of the world somewhere up in the back woods of New Hampshire and keep writing. You disappear. You keep secrets. At least that’s what I think you do. Lee Miller, one of the first artists and war correspondents to witness the mass executions of the final solution, moved to the English country side, drank more, buried her camera, prints and negatives in the attic and spent the rest of her days gardening and coming up with new recipes for healthy food.\n\nJohn McWhinney drowned that winter. He was in the Caribbean snorkeling, and got caught in a rip tide. He was my best friend and the person I spent the most time talking about books and book collecting and the area between the book and art world that he called “the grey” area. He would show up at least once a week at my studio with two shopping bags full of books, prints, ephemera, zines, flyers, smut, and a cross pollination of beat hippie punk cultural artifacts. I can still see him, coming down the street, waiting by my door… smiling ear to ear… knowing we would spend the next couple of hours sharing the things that we loved the best. Things that only we knew about or cared to know… things that I can only describe as medicine.\n\nJohn’s death kept me sidelined. It probably will keep me over on the side for a long time. It’s not the same. I still collect books but there’s no one to share the “tonic” with. There’s an emptiness in my library. John was responsible for most of what’s there. He mentored me. Taught me the never ending points of what a good copy of Chamber Music is suppose to be. We both knew that there’s no end to what you needed to know. There’s always another copy out there. A better copy. A copy no one knew existed. The copy you have to have and can’t because your not supposed to know that there was a privately printed specially bound and numbered copy with tipped in special tissue that separates the title page from the colophon… inscribed to a family member, a brother, sister or some black sheep that you didn’t know the author had or even figured into his or her life that help make the book possible in the first place.\n\nThe first place. That’s the place we’d hear about, then try to get to. Quest. Collecting books, John would say, “is a strange journey… there’s not many of us on the journey. There’s no map out there that tells you where or how to go. You want a complete run of Wallace Berman’s Semina… cross your fingers. You want the first issue? The one with the table of contents pasted on the back? Good luck.”\n\nOver the last four years I’ve inscribed only one copy of Catcher In The Rye by Richard Prince. I inscribed it to John McWhinney. I’ve heard about the copy of Ulysses that Joyce inscribed to Ezra Pound. I’ve heard it’s not in an institution, a foundation, or a public museum. I’ve heard it’s in private hands. Do I want it? Yes. Will I get it? I wish. It’s the copy that dreams. My “Catcher” inscribed to John? What can I say? I won’t say. I’ll bite my tongue. Keep my mouth closed. Not say a word. Go away. Hide. Get into bed. Stare at the ceiling. Look up at the fan. Get a little breeze and cool off. Try and go blank. Drift. Close my eyes. I won’t sleep. I won’t dream. I won’t even give it a second thought.\n\n4/25/2015\n\nO'Sexual...\n\n4/21/2015\n\nThe Figures\n\nRichard Prince arrived in NYC in August 1974. He stayed in Bed-Stuy Brooklyn with a friend of a friend for two weeks and then rented a small one bedroom sublet on Prince and West Broadway. He had saved 1,500 dollars from teaching pottery to high school students working at a private country day school south of Boston. He had read an article in the New York Times Magazine about Soho. He wanted to check it out and thought he’d come down and stay for three months. He had spent most of the summer of ’74 in southern Maine house sitting for a family, and when they returned he thought it might be a good time to go the place he always wanted to go to.\n\nOne of the first things he did after he arrived in New York was look for a drawing class. Figure drawing. He’d been going to one up in Maine for three years. He found a class on Greene St that met twice a week… maybe twenty people went… chipped in ten dollars to pay for a model, sometimes two models at the same time. The figure drawing sessions back in Maine were organized by friends. After three hours of drawing, they would open up beer and pass around their drawings and talk to each other about what they had just drawn. This didn’t happen on Greene St. No beer. No talking about what they drew. It wasn’t AA. They didn’t share. What they did was private. Everybody was in their own worlds.\n\n“I didn’t know anybody when I came to New York City. I was on my own and spent days where the only conversation I would have was with a bartender.”\n\nFigure drawing class in 1974 was out of fashion. “I’m not sure when it went out but I can tell you, in 1974, it wasn’t in.” Figure drawing was something he needed to do. He felt connected to something when he did it… and the tradition of drawing the figure put him in a place where El Greco, Goya, Cezanne, Picasso, de Kooning, Sigmar Polke, and R. Crumb had already been. There was something safe about the place. It wasn’t crazy or wild or new or different or groundbreaking or what was next. It’s where things started. And Richard wanted to be in the beginning.\n\nPassing the hat.\n\n“Whoever showed up and took off their clothes got whatever we could afford to put in the hat.”\n\nThis class met over on Broome and Mercer. It was a real dump. Tin ceiling. Exposed pipes. A bunch of cats would sit on the sills or pass by and rub up against you while you were trying to connect a hip to a thigh. The place belonged to some women and part of what was in the hat went toward their rent.\n\nDrawing the nude was fundamental, unexciting… “squaresville.” Whatever every other artist was doing outside THE SQUARE had nothing to do with Richard. There was video. There was performance. There was post studio. There was Avalanche. Richard knew about Acconci. He knew about Smithson. He knew about Nauman. He knew about Hesse. He knew about Hannah Wilke. But he also knew about Walt Kuhn and Alice Neel… Abner Dean, Gregory Gillespie, George Tooker, Whitney Darrow Jr., James Avati and William Bailey. And he knew for himself, in August ’74, there was gouache on hot press arches, a No. 4B pencil, and a naked body. “It’s what I loved to do.” And hooking into something that was so basic and old, felt genuine. It was all about continuation… and there was nothing better when it came to “continuation” than the human body.\n\nRichard has said that he’ll never stop thinking about human flesh. He calls this never-ending thinking “second nature.” Sure, the thinking gets interrupted by other ideas and mediums, but head to toe is simple. It’s always there. Right next to you. All around. “It grounds you and makes you think about posture.”\n\nHe does it alone. No assistants having to show or give instructions to. He usually makes some kind of figure study during the summer or on vacations, or makes it part of his day, like when he goes to museums and tries to find a room that’s empty, and sits and stares at the scale of the human form.\n\nEvery artist that he’s ever thought about has tried it. Whether they admit it or not, at some time during their life, they’ve drawn an arm, a leg, a foot, a head.\n\nPhilip Guston. Perfect example.\n\n“I’m not sure I would’ve paid much attention to him had he not given up and cartooned his way into fat one eyed faces smoking stubby cigars. When was that show? 1970? Talk about hate. The reviews were vicious. Was he mad? Lost his mind? It’s strange to think that one of the only people who came to his defense was Willem de Kooning.”\n\nThe figure.\n\nRelevant?\n\nWho cares?\n\nDinosaur?\n\nNot to Richard.\n\nLike he’s said, “Get it on bang a gong… T-Rex.”\n\nRichard knows the figure isn’t on everybody’s radar. Old story. Old hat. It’s all been done. Taken care of. But that’s just it. He doesn’t think it has. He likes the dead-end. “In my mind the “conventions” of the figure is what’s cool. Trying to make something different out of something that’s already been done to death makes me bend over backward, hold my breath and count to ten. I take a pulse. It’s faint. But I feel it. It’s barely there. Flat line? Almost. But I hold on. Lay it on me. Give me some skin. Give me some bones. It’s just like that The Mamas & the Papas song… ‘I’m in the mood for love.’”\n\nRichard Prince: The Figures\n\n23 April – 6 June, 2015\n\nLuxembourg & Dayan\n\n64 East 77th Street\n\nNew York City\n\n4/14/2015\n\nThe Fall Of Eden\n\nCharles Company, his wife, daughter and son land on the tiny island of St. Barts, after taking a “puddle” jumper from St. Martins. St. Barts is an eight-square-mile piece of Fei Tsui jade in the open bracelet of the Lesser Antilles. It’s Christmas and St. Barts is where the Company’s have gone every Christmas for the last sixteen years. It’s familiar. They know the routine. It’s like a second home. There are no surprises. Aside from an occasional five-minute downpour, the weather is predictably perfect. They’re meeting Charles’s brother and his brother’s family and plan to share a rented house above Gustavia, the island’s main town for the next two weeks. This Christmas will be different. The moment they touch down, Charles can see there’s something not right. From the window of the plane Charles sees people running around, shouting, screaming, holding each other, crying.\n\nThe two pilots leave the plane immediately. No one comes to open the door to let Charles and his family out of the plane. The VIP Charter Service that Charles pays a premium for has failed to show up, get the luggage, and collect the passports. Charles can see his brother waving from behind a glass wall, inside the small terminal, just to the left of customs. The motion of his brother’s waving isn’t joyous or welcoming. What should have been “more routine” is chaos.\n\nThis is the initial “set up” of Richard Michaels “thriller” The Fall Of Eden. Minutes after Charles Company lands on the tiny island of St. Barts he finds out that what he wanted to get away from for a couple of weeks, his job, his home, his city, his LIFE… has vanished…wiped away by a nuclear holocaust. Science fiction? No… just science. All he knows is “somehow,” most of the northern hemisphere “disappeared,” ripped apart by the “unimaginable.” America, Russia, China, Israel, North Korea….gone. Someone fired. Let it go. Pushed the button. A secret silo’s somewhere in a field of corn opened up and one of those crazy big ass phallic doomsday machines came blasting out, shot up across the horizon, detonated, and X’d out an entire population. Retaliation followed. More atom filled monsters. More “annihilation.” Blame? Not important. The facts? Unknown. And besides… whoever sent these giant megaton mushrooms into the sky isn’t around to explain. What is known… is that Charles Company and his family can’t return, go back, and pick up where they left off. Never. “Never” is the new reality and what matters now is survival. The have’s and have not’s will soon be separated into “tribes” and these tribes will face a different kind of war. It will be simple. A bottle of water will be more valuable than a Rolex. And whoever has the will, the instinct, the skills, might last another day. Ruthless? Yea. That human dimension will help keep you going too.\n\n“Lord of the Flies” meets “On The Beach” meets “Fail Safe” meets “The Road.” That’s how I pitched The Fall Of Eden after I optioned the book and tried to convince Bret Ratner to roll out another one of his “fourth of July” blockbusters. Maybe Jeremy Renner could play Charles Company. I tell Ratner that no amount of heroism will deflect an incoming intercontinental ballistic missile. I combine the words “ordinary” and “unbelievable” in the same sentence to try to sell the story. I tell him that when Charles first touches down in St. Bart’s he’s a middle aged, slightly chubby, (out of shape) architect. I tell him after he meets up with his brother they go straight to the Eden Rock Hotel, claim it, take it over, promise the staff, if they work with them, they can defend themselves against what surly will be, “another wave of evil cracked opened by madmen that are determined to undo civilization.” “We can use Eden Rock’s natural moat like shape as fortification.” (At this point Charles’s only option is to try to rally his “recruits” with a preacher’s resolve).\n\n“With us or against us is what it boils down to.” I’m not sure if these are my words or Charles’s words. (I know… things are getting crisscrossed). I was channeling my pitch according to what I had seen in the movie The Player. Five minutes is all I had. I’m staring straight at Ratner, trying to get him to stare back.\n\n“Skip to a year later”, I continued.\n\n“CUT…”\n\n“You see Charles Company… Tarzan buff. His daughter Chloe, (Dakota Fanning?)… wearing nothing but body painted camouflage, holding onto something that looks like a medieval sling shot. Fourteen year old Davis, the son… covered in mud, caveman, (cave boy)…slathering grease on a palm size ball of tightly wound twigs. (Flamethrower). And finally Dana, Charles’s wife. The ‘Mother Lode’. She arrived on the island as a sculptor and part time yoga instructor. Skills that don’t exactly translate when a next door neighbor is trying to split your skull open with an ax. I blurt out to Ratner about the new “loaded” Dana. “She’s the reincarnation of Barbarella.” Ratner looks skeptical. I come up with, “think Raquel Welch in One Million BC.” “You know that bikini loin cloth?” Still not convinced. Then I hit it. “You remember the Slits?\n\nI’ve got a minute left.\n\nAfter “the cut,” the shot pans to Charles’s whole family, in a group. A portrait. The shot is framed as if the family is posing for one of those wishful Disney Xmas cards.\n\n“But its okay” I tell him. The memory will never be posted. Never delivered. Not even pony express. “The postman’s motto will be radioactive. The swift completion of their appointed rounds will be shut down by a nuclear winter. Return to sender.” (Michaels words not mine).\n\nA year after fighting “tooth and nails”, the dystopian ideas of JG Ballard and Philip Dick become everyday events. (And this is where the “hook” of my pitch turns movie friendly). Over a Trent Razor soundtrack, Charles’s brother walks into the shot and plants a crucifix into a hill of garbage. The hill is replant. Literally. It stinks. Flotsam. Jetsam. Beachcomb. Dumpster. Nothing goes to waste. Fifty-feet high. Jerry rigged. A steaming hill of rot that rings the outer edge of the hotel is a living maggot. The camera zooms in on the crucifix. Razor samples the opening chords of the Doors “The End” and syncs the track up with the zoom. The bubbling mass of the barrier is gurgling, burping… tripping out like an old slide show at the Dom. Charles’s brother has painted on the cross of the crucifix two words… “Charlie Company.”\n\nI wish I could say The Fall of Eden is a beach book. A page-turner. One of those stories you ingest, speed thru, (in a couple of days, can’t wait finish)… that wines up being a king size pleasure. I wish I could say that Richard Michaels wrote some thing close to Cormac McCarthy’s, “The Road.” (Okay that’s a bit unfair. McCarthy’s, “The Road” is a single sitting masterpiece of social science fiction). But Michaels wrote a stinker. It’s bad. Not even Stephan King bad. (At least King can get you started).\n\nI’m not a critic. I’m supposed to be some hot-shot artist. What do I know about handing out literary stars? I wanted to have as much disbelief and trauma that Charles Company was supposed to have when he got word of “buried worlds”. But I kept seeing John Travolta in Battlefield Earth. I even looked up Richard Michaels… half expecting him to be a pseudonym of L. Ron Hubbard, the scientologist).\n\nI’ve read my fair share of fantastical futuristic speculative fiction. I like Ray Bradbury. I like Arthur C. Clarke. I like Ira Levine. H G Wells. Walter Tevis. George Orwell. I “grok” with Robert Heinlein’s ‘Space Cadet’. I even a have a killer copy of Kurt Vonnegut’s first book The Sirens of Titan, where “thinking is unforgivable” and “perfection means death”. (My copy is a mint, crisp, unopened paperback inscribed to “yours truly”, Kurt, Oct 6, 2003). I get the genre. I’m not a stranger when it comes to strange lands. But I’m not even sure I could blurb Michaels book. If I had to have added a testimonial it probably would of said something like… “If you liked Lost you’ll love The Fall of Eden.” I kept thinking of one nice thing I could say about the book. Is “stocking stuffer” nice?\n\nWhy didn’t Michaels use the arsenals in the fancy yachts as a source for weapons? (Do some research dude). Why didn’t he chapter in how maybe the small police force could of at least freaked and STARTED the murder. Richard’s version was more Car 54 Where Are You. A joke. How the cops ran for hills the day after receiving Morse Code, an SOS that no one had the brain power to interpret. Laying low above Gouverneur Beach, sneaking back to the one room hospital stealing band aides, aspirin and drugs. Come on. Really? You want to see a “crew-cut in uniform” shuffling around attached to an IV drip full of dope? What’s that AC/DC song? Back In Black? Everybody is stuck on this island FOR GOOD. I want a plane crash. I want a bonfire. I want Tangerine Dream. I want Michael Mann. I want Heat.\n\nHow long before the mini marts are emptied? Why aren’t the liquors stores the first stores to be looted and torched? Drunk. Hung-over. Redrum. If you can’t make it new, what about real? THINK! The one hardware store on the island… There should of been a pile of dead bodies blocking the door, trampled, run over… stacked up from trying to get inside to get to the last saw.\n\nWhy didn’t Michaels have the “locals” attack those cruise ships anchored out beyond the harbor for food supplies. They’re like floating neighborhoods. I mean, by the third day of the “the apocalypse”… someone should of figured out those floating towns are filled with terrified tourists still wearing Bermuda shorts waiting… waiting for what? Help? More like waiting to be thrown overboard or captured and chained and dragged back to a locked room to be hammered over the head, roasted and eaten.\n\nSave me.\n\nThe cannibal part was never in my original pitch. I saw what happened to the film version of “The Road.” The interpretation? Spot on. The production design and sets? Brilliant. GRIM would be a one word review. REAL GRIM would be two. Unfortunately the movie put the audience in the shot gun seat and word got around. Uncomfortable. Unsettling. Unwatchable. You couldn’t help but think what if it was you that had to eat crow. It messed you up. I went to a matinee. Just me and two other customers. After the credits, you didn’t exactly emerge from that general lowering of wakefulness in the brightest of moods. By the third day the film was pulled from theaters. Dead on arrival. Poor Harvey. Viggo Mortenson and Robert Duvall and Guy Pierce should be proud though. The Road will be remembered. Sometimes Hollywood fools you.\n\nWhere was I?\n\nHere’s a thought…\n\nWhy not have a reggae band that was booked to entertain on one of those huge Carnival cruise ships, slip away, take over the Hotel Guanahani. There’s like what? Six in the band? Some wives. A manager. A couple of roadies. It’s a crew. There’s already group trust. The Guanahani is on the north shore of the island. It’s separated. A perfect place to “reinforce.” ‘Radio Dread’ could be on the mike when they muscle out anyone who thought they had “reservations.” Rastaville.\n\nHow about twenty lesbians from one of those “theme” cruises take over the Manapany. Natalie Barney (Jessica Biel) and her whole Sappho salon. Get those girls from The Decent. Shauna MacDonald, Natalie Mendoza Saskia Mulder, Nora-Jane Noone. Cue Russ Myer. Amazonian Kill Kill.\n\nSee what I’m getting at? It’s like the whale in Moby Dick. It isn’t a REAL whale. By the end of the week each of the six major hotels on the island is defended by a different gender, nationality, social stratosphere. Men and women. Men and men. Women and women. (Did someone say “video game rights”?)\n\nThe Carl Gustav could “clubhouse” the creeps. The scary. The cutthroats. The “throwaway’s.” “Road Warrior” meets “Waterworld.” Someone like Vin Diesel could be Clown Posse. A Neanderthal . How about Quinton ‘Rampage’ Jackson as his sidekick? Craig Conway could have his own harem. The costume department could make Conway a leather vest and embroider “Last Call” on the back. Kathryn Bigelow’s “Point Break” Nazi surfers marries John Carpenter’s Snake Plisskin. Racist. Demented. Death Metal. Splice up some found footage of Darby Crash fronting Bad Brains. Don’t count your chickens. Or maybe you should. Who knows? Knowing the difference between a rooster and a chicken might save your life.\n\nVicious doesn’t begin to describe the “Last Call.” The tribe is savage, evil. Alpha males. I’m getting Ratner’s attention.\n\nI tell him Jake Paltrow.\n\n“Did you see his last film “Young Ones”?\n\nThat’s the guy you want to get this treatment to.\n\nRatner is listening.\n\nThe Ill de France Hotel is grandfathered. Castle Keep for the rich. “The architects of avarice.” They were already there to begin with. Checked in a week before the melt down. And don’t underestimate the rich. They didn’t get wealthy by being stupid. By day five they’ve already had elections. They’ve commandeered a number of private yachts. “Our armada”. Rookie pirates. They have plans. They’ve got flags. What they lack in imagination they make up with entitlement. Assassins in polo shirts. They surround themselves with options. Escape hatch? They don’t have one yet. But neither does Richard Michaels.\n\nThe first to check out are the twenty-four year olds. They take over houses near the soccer stadium and continue to party. That’s what they came down for anyway. No family. No affiliations. No responsibility. They know they have no future and their unwillingness to even squirrel away one nut makes them “easy pickins.” They don’t even keep a look out. Most of their throats are cut by the second week.\n\n(An annotation I added on page 96. Jerry and Tina… fraternal twins, part of a fraternity of stoners, escape a Manson like raid and team up with “Last Call”. They’re sibling blood bond will develop into something hard to break apart and later in the story will have the only workable car on the island. The car will have a star role. Like the cars in the movies, “Bullitt”, “Vanishing Point”, “Two Lane Blacktop.” I’ve made more notes about the car but for now just go to my Instagram @Richardprince1234. There’s a gram of it. It’s green. See for yourself.\n\nAm I writing or reviewing? Who cares. My position? I own the rights to the book. I’m not holding my breath for something like Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove. If Hollywood ever does green light this soup, they’ll probably get some hack to re-write it and steam clean the jungle with snow. Turn the equator up side down. (Special effects is Hollywood’s idea of creation).\n\nQuestion Painting: When’s the last time you’ve seen a man fall to earth without makeup?\n\nAnswer: Nicolas Roeg’s David Bowie.\n\nLittle known fact.\n\nI was the one who read John O’Brien’s “Leaving Las Vegas.” The book was being sold in one bookstore in LA. at the time it was published. The bookstore was The Vagabond. In West Hollywood. The owner, Craig Graham, stocked mostly second hand books but occasionally, near his register, he would “feature” a book from a small imprint that he liked and recommend to loyal customers. I collect first editions. I have a habit. Craig knew my habit, knew my tastes. He said, “Richard, you like Harry Crews, read this.” I didn’t see a movie in the book but I told my buddy, my pal, my dear friend Stuart Regan he should check it out and maybe see how much a year’s option would cost. He bought the rights to ‘Vegas’ for five grand and passed it along to Mike Figgis. Art imitates life. Like the character Nicholas Cage plays in the movie, John O’Brien committed suicide just before the movie’s release.\n\nThe thing about the opening chapter of The Fall Of Eden… is that I’ve had the exact same thoughts when I travel to St. Bart’s. The touch down. Every time I land on that tiny white-knuckle runway, I expect a sudden shift in reality. My in-grown fear of despair and dread take over, and my childhood memories of cold war, (duck and cover), Conlerad, (“this is a test… this only a test), fallout shelters, radiation, propaganda… the endless newsreels of hydrogen bombs lifting battleships out of the water like toothpicks… anxiety, sadness, stress, insomnia take over. I know, Henry Fuseli’s The Nightmare. It’s crazy. I even think about specific episodes of the Twilight Zone. Other dimensions. Time warps. Of course it’s make believe. It’s fiction. But is it? America dropped the bomb on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. My birthday is on August 6th. That’s either Freewheelin’ or Land of a Thousands Dances.\n\nWhat I’ve been told…\n\nNightmares usually begin before the age of 10 and are considered a normal part of childhood due in part to an unexplained coincidence. Or maybe they begin after seeing that famous anti-war ad… the “daisy girl”… plucking petals on an idyllic August day in New York City’s Highbridge Park for thirty seconds. (Look it up).\n\nWhen you’re in the ninth grade and there’s a Cuban missile crisis… the horror story is news, not a story. That Kennedy Khrushchev stare down really put the zap on me.\n\nDo I drink the cool aid or do I learn to rub two sticks together and brush up on the art of somersaulting a knife into the back of a human being. (Sample James Coburn in the Magnificent Seven).\n\nI’ve had long sessions with my shrink about the end of the world and where will I be and what will I do when it happens. How will I handle a catastrophe that leaves me and my family on a lawless island. Lock and load. I don’t know. Maybe this is the best way. Maybe secure the rights to some obscure nonsense paperback that no one read… one of thousand dopey stories where the end is always “nigh”… and hire someone like Neil Marshall or Joe Carnahan or Neill Blomkamp and see if I can secretly turn the pulp into some serious popcorn.\n\nOne more thing… the title.\n\nIt has to change.\n\nEden Rock.\n\nThat’s box office.\n\nDog Eared.\n\nSome circled, underlined, or checked words that I marked up in the Fall of Eden.\n\n‘Rescue’. ‘Honeymooners’. ‘Retired folks’. Hysteria’. ‘Philip Wylie’. Recon’.\n\nOther marginalia…\n\n“Hope isn’t in society. It’s in individuals.”\n\nI think I “starred” this sentence and turned down the corner of the page. The Fall of Eden had some of this applause but not enough. Richards didn’t really punish anyone. In the end, committing genocide is about stupidity, bigotry and greed. Someone has to pay the piper. The Fall of Eden is a ‘tired formula’. Pose a problem and then find a technical development to solve the problem. The characters in Eden are stock stereotypes. The love story mawkish. There’s no simple man or woman reaching the agonizing decision to kill their only child in its crib and commit suicide after, as the rest of the world evaporates around them. I know this is a nag but most Americans fear communism more than the bomb. This is what Richards fails to realize. I keep thinking about Uranium 235. I think about Wilco’s ‘Solid Tape Technology’. I think about Power Possession, caves, savages and body parts used to decorate mantles. I think about Aldous Huxley’s Ape and Essence. Judith Merril’s story “Only A Mother”. I think about the movie The Day The Earth Stood Still based on a Harry Bates story Farewell to the Master and how the movie tried to turn the story into social ethics.\n\nMostly I think about March 1, 1954 the Bravo H-bomb test near the Marshall Islands and how the test fatally contaminated sailors aboard a Japanese fishing vessel known as the Lucky Dragon. It Happened.\n\nSailors. Died. Fishing.\n\nSounds like a hiku.\n\nThere are no hiku’s in The Fall of Eden.\n\nI’ve always thought the definition of art is the discovery of the coke bottle and what the coke bottle is doing in Nevil Shute’s “On The Beach”. (If you want pass the acid test, Google Nuclear Holocausts: Atomic War In Fiction by Paul Brians). After you google you tell me. Or for that matter tell Michael Richards.\n\nComic Con.\n\nI would never want to go on a book tour promoting The Fall Of Eden. I get the jeebs just thinking about having to sit behind a folding table and Hancocking my name to a line of expectant fans. The smell of the magic marker. The eye contact. The hoping for some kind of intimacy… which for me as an artist who spends the majority of his time alone in a room is unimaginable, scary, draining. “I’m sorry, how do you spell your name again?”\n\nI have this macabre vision of a Jewish Rabbi walking backwards up an escalator. I remember seeing this vision in Spirits of the Dead, in an episode titled Toby Dammit, directed by Frederico Fellini loosely based on Edgar Allan Poe’s ‘Never Bet The Devil Your Head’. “Ambition above the ordinary.” There’s nothing ambitious about The Fall of Eden. That’s why Richard Michaels is going to have to go out and sign the book himself.\n\nThe Cliff Notes:\n\n“Become a sniper. Take aim. Hold your breath. Kill people without remorse.\n\n“We began living at the mercy of the wind.”\n\n“My military buddies are dead. So are all of your friends. Everyone back at school? All dead. Or about to die. Real soon… Everyone you ever knew, except us.”\n\nThe Fall Of Eden, The Berkley Publishing Group, published by the Penguin Group.\n\nBy Richard Michaels\n\nOn the lower left of colophon after the ISBN number it says: 1. Family vacations---Fiction. 2. Caribbean Area---Fiction. 3. Terrorism----United States---Fiction.\n\nOn the cover of the book, under an illustration of a man running out of a jungle towards a beach its says… “The end of the world is just beginning…” On the back cover above the same illustration, only smaller, its says,\n\n“Imagine a world without technology, without governments without civilization. A world in which you must fight for EVERYTHING.\n\nOn page 306, the second to the last page it says, “People need to die so that we can keep living.”\n\nI picked up the Fall Of Eden in an airport kiosk six years ago. I read what was on page 307, (the last page), before I paid for the book.\n\nThis “review” was supposed to appear this June in the NYT’s Book Review. Yesterday I heard from the editor. She wrote in an email, “this is a six page piece of writing. It is not clear to me how you expected this to be photographed for the Book Review. Obviously, we cannot have you review a book that you wrote yourself. How could we unveil a book that has already been in wide distribution since 2009?”\n\nRed Flags.\n\n“Photograph.”\n\n“Yourself.”\n\n“Unveil.”\n\n“Wide.”\n\n4/10/2015\n\nOriginal\n\nOriginal Patent for perforated toilet paper.\n\nSeth Wheeler’s original patent for his perforated toilet paper invention was issued in 1891.\n\nApparently Wheeler, even back then, knew people would be prone to using to much paper in the john.\n\n“In carrying out my invention the sheets of paper are only partially separated, having their points of attachment arranged in a novel manner, whereby each sheet will easily separate from the series as it is drawn from the roll, there being no litter occasioned, and any waste of paper is thereby prevented”, he wrote in the patent.\n\nWheeler’s toilet paper was 4.5 inches wide.\n\nMusician says Universal Music has hijacked his YouTube videos with bogus copyright claims.\n\nTorrentFreak.com reports on the story of Norwegian musician Bjorn Lynne, who says that UMG has twice taken over the ads on You Tube clips of his music by falsely claiming copyright violations.\n\nHis most recent example involves the video for a tune called “Kingdom of the Persians”, from his soundtrack for the Seven Kingdoms video game.\n\nUnfortunately, it looks like UMG took the step of putting that audiobook recording into the You Tube Content-ID system. When the copyright bots matched up Lynne’s recording to the background music of the audiobook, he received an automated copyright notice saying that ads would be placed on his video and that Universal would get the money.\n\nLynne says he can understand the confusion arising from the automated system. However, when he filed a written dispute with You Tube about the claim, he was ultimately told that UMG had determined they were the rightful holders of the copyright and that the “ads will stay.”\n\n“The only reasonable thing to do here, for me, says Lynne, would be to hire a top lawyer to go after them legally. But realistically, it’s like $350 per hour for a lawyer and a 3-hour minimum for a case, so I’m looking at over $1,000 just to get something started.\n\nThe Original Pancake House was founded in Portland Oregon in 1953 by Les Highet and Erma Hueneke.
