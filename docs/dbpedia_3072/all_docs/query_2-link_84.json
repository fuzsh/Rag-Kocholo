        "text": "Law abiding citizens called for a vote to bring their territory into the union. But sinister forces, opposed to the coming of law and order, instigated a reign of terror against the lives and property of all who favored statehood.\n\nVic jumps off of the wagon just before it goes over the cliff. Later, Vic suggests a reward for the capture of the bandit leader. Vic raises a $10,000 reward.\n\nThe Black Whip hides behind a cabinet to deflect the force of the explosives. The Black Whip and Vic escape as the marshal arrives and unties Hammond. Vic is captured by some of the townspeople who think he was stealing the money. Vic protests, but no one will believe him. Vic is arrested and jailed.\n\nThe Black Whip gets up and takes cover just in time. She is able to capture the bandit and return to town with him. As the townspeople prepare to execute Vic, the Black Whip arrives with the stolen money and the bandit. Vic is exonerated, and the bandit is arrested.\n\nVic survives as the stage crashes into the water. Vic regains consciousness and is able to save himself. The Black Whip returns to the secret cave, pursued by the bandits. The bandits find it curious that they lost track of the Black Whip right at the Meredith ranch. They think that Barbara may know who the Black Whip is.\n\nThe Black Whip uses her whip to snatch away the bandit's gun. The bandit flees when the Black Whip begins shooting. Vic rides back to the Meredith ranch where Barbara tells him that the Black Whip freed her and then must have followed the bandits to their hideout.\n\nThe Black Whip survives because she entered a tunnel which runs from the tent into the hillside. Vic urges Zeke to file a claim quickly because his gold strike is no longer a secret.\n\nThe Black Whip falls into one of the wagons and escapes. Hammond and his men begin to speculate on who the Black Whip might be. They first suggest Vic Gordon and then the town marshal. They realize that neither man can be the Black Whip because both men have been rescued by the Black Whip. Hammond feels that Barbara Meredith knows who the Black Whip is.\n\nThe men check behind the curtain and discover that it was just a pair of boots. The Black Whip shoots at them from the other side of the room. The men escape by throwing the boot at a lamp to divert the Black Whip's attention.\n\nVic and Barbara escape out a side window just before the house is destroyed. Vic tries to convince Barbara to let him take over being the Black Whip for her. She refuses and says that she will carry on her brother's legacy until law and order are restored in Idaho.\n\nVic tosses a saddle on top of Barbara which saves her from the pitch fork. Vic and Barbara come up with a plan to reveal who the bandit leader is. Vic tells the citizen's committee that they found a note in possession of one of the bandits and that he was planning to meet his boss at their hideout and would tell the boss who the Black Whip is.\n\nVic and the Black Whip seek refuge in one of the mining carts. When the coal oil explodes, it blows a hole in the top of the tunnel, and Vic and the Black Whip escape."
