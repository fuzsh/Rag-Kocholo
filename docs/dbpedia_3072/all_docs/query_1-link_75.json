        "text": "Anthony Delon sits with his back to the room, just like someone hoping to avoid prying eyes and to be left alone. Mr. Delon, 57, is his father’s double: the same intense and determined look, the same bright white smile and the same tone of voice. It is unnerving. And since everyone knows his father, everyone knows him, too. He gets up, offers me a seat and calls the waiter to take my order, with old-fashioned politeness. He is drinking a cup of lemon verbena tea and I join him with some green tea. Mr. Delon is not there to joke around. It is crucial for him to be taken seriously. He seeks the right word, the exact expression. On several occasions, he stresses that he wrote his book alone, which seems very important to him.\n\nAfter reading his memoir Entre chien et loup (\"Between dog and wolf\"), you do not feel like laughing anymore. There were some endearing figures, like the former agent Georges Beaume, whom he calls the \"Godfather.\" He was an attentive and educated man who, every Sunday, took him to breakfast at the Deux-Magots, the famous café in Saint-Germain-des-Prés, Paris, where Mr. Delon and I have met. There was also \"Loulou,\" the tireless nanny with whom he admits having spent more time than with his own parents. Finally, there was Mireille Darc, known as \"Mimi,\" for whom his father, Alain, left his mother, Nathalie, when he was 4 years old. She was the one who protected him from his father's rage. They are all dead now and he had to pay tribute to them. Weren’t they the source of his rare happy memories? Because, for the rest – I might as well say it right away – Mr. Delon had a hard life.\n\nChilling scenes\n\nTo all those who would be tempted to envy the dream life of celebrity offspring, I suggest that you take a look at the childhood memories of the kid of one of the most glamorous couples in French cinema. You will find more than enough to quell any jealousy. In a few chilling scenes, Mr. Delon describes a violent and angry father who yelled, hit, insulted and humiliated him for no good reason. A father who sent his terrified child walking around a lake in the middle of the night, who smashed his plate against the wall because he did not behave properly, who flogged him with Zorro's leather whip to punish him for having dug a hole in the icing of a cake with a greedy finger.\n\nMore than the burn of the blows, it is the cruel words accompanying them that Mr. Delon cannot forget. \"'Even my dogs, I wouldn’t beat them with this whip,' he tells me. \"I stopped being afraid of him at 17. He was locked in his Paris office and wouldn't see me. One day, I went upstairs to confront him. Like in a pack of wolves, I was ready to stand up to the alpha male. He understood it and stayed locked in.\""
