        "text": "In this essay, I have tried to read the concept of the superhero through Ranjan Ghosh’s idea of “intra-active transculturality” inside a “more than global world” which accentuates on the transnational, translingual and transcultural circulation and engagement with a literary work. Philosophically, the concept of the “superhero’’ is linked to the active potentiality of Nietzsche’s “Ubermensch”; and etymologically, it is linked to the grandeur of the mythical “hero.” However, this comic-book concept has been imprisoned into an insular identity within a self-inclusive genre since the birth of Superman in 1938. Over the years the concept of the superhero has travelled across times, places and genres. It has also been culturally translated and reformulated in many unpredictable contexts. The dialogue between the superhero and its “apocryphal” usages, the essay argues, adds an excess or “more” to it, and eventually creates the possibility of a new sense or a defamiliarised understanding of the concept. However, this essay is not an attempt to dismantle this popular cultural concept, but to revive its creative energy from the clutches of a globalised culture industry. The superhero, this essay argues, does not only belong to the comic-books and movies, but is embedded in a network of intra-relations within a larger literary and philosophical culture.\n\nPeople in ancient Greece and Rome created their own heroes as leaders and believed in them. These stories passed on by word of mouth, and thanks to Iliad and Odessa by Homer, they were then written down. Even planets and star clusters are named after the gods of Rome, and even words we use regularly, such as “echo,” “erotic,” “chaos”, and “volcano” originate from Greek myths. Mythology is an abstract power that ties people and cultures. Our understanding of 'hero' also comes from Greeks and Romes. As a result of globalization, the world gets more complex and stories change form and content to keep up with their complexity. Today’s brilliant concept is to replace those myths and call them “super heroes”. These heroes first appeared in comic strips by Marvel Comics and then they were presented as films. Thus, super heroes became worldwide known.The aim of this study is to find out common points of worldwide famous super heroes and their roots in ancients myths. The Avengers film series of Marvel Comics is to be analyzed via content analysis method. There are two ways of applying myths to cinema. First method is to make a film out of a myth directly and the second method is to incorporate ancient myths in contemporary films. Since The Avengers film series uses both of these methods, it seems to be able to represent the myths very strongly. To strengthen the evaluations, Captain America, Hulk, Iron Man, and Thor film series are also analyzed as these characters are part of The Avengers. At first, mythology and its relation with popular culture is mentioned and secondly The Avengers film series is examined in a detailed way\n\nUnhappy is the land that needs an anti-hero: a land in crisis, without a clear moral, without truths. The anti-hero embodies competing values; on the one hand, he is born of a crisis, on the other exasperates it, leads it to the extreme consequences. During the 1980s these characters have their greatest success in superhero comics. The so-called Dark Age follows a profound crisis in American society, marked by the Vietnam War, the fear of nuclear conflict, but also by alternative cultural and social movements. A profound social transformation that inevitably brings with it a crisis of certainties, morals and values. Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, together with Alan Moore’s Watchmen and V for Vendetta, are the graphic novels that more than any other represent this transformation. Today, the western world faces a new crisis. Economic uncertainty, mass migrations, encounters and clashes with different cultures, terrorism: our worldview and our truths are wavering. Superhero universe mirrors all of these. Antiheroes become more and more numerous, and superheroes lose a clear definition. Marvel’s Civil War, saga directly linked to the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent PATRIOT Act, is probably the most emblematic example, an ideal beginning of this new Age. The historical moment is comparable to the Dark Age. We are not just witnessing a new proliferation of anti-heroes: even superheroes and the way we perceive them are changing. The line between superhero and anti-hero becomes confused. The classic superheroes have begun to kill – the latest Batman and Superman films are emblematic. Superheroes’ relationship with the mask, with society, becomes much more problematic and \"anti-heroic\". I will refer to Nietzschean concepts, such as the mask, the Apollonian and the Dionysian, the Übermensch, to distinguish the superhero and the anti-hero, in his relationship with the mask and the society, in his morality. Comparing Dark Age’s anti-heroes (Miller’s Batman, Rorschach, V) with contemporary films and comics like The Authority, Civil War, Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight, I will show how our perception of anti-heroes and superheroes has changed. https://www.uni-due.de/balc/superhero.php\n\nIn his essay The Myth of Superman, Umberto Eco claims that in superhero comics nothing really changes: this is one of the most characteristic aspects of the superhero who is a status quo defender. By the end of each story, everything is back to normal. It’s 1964 when Eco wrote it, 20 years before one of the biggest revolutions in the superhero comic books history, the beginning of the Dark Age. Graphic novels like Watchmen, V for Vendetta, The Dark Knight Returns revolutionize the concept of \"superhero\". But we are not talking about superheroes anymore, we are in front of antiheroes. Something else is different too: in these stories, something really happens, there is not a return to the status quo, but a transformation, sometime a revolution. The difference between superhero and antihero means also a difference between the kind of story, between comic and graphic novel. I argue that the antihero narrative is linked to the graphic novel format, while superheroes go on with their infinite battle to defend the status quo on the pages of comic books. https://internationalgraphicnovelandcomicsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Conference-Booklet-june-17-updated.pdf"
