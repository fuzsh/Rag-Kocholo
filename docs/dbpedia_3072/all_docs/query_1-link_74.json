        "text": "by Rosemary Rossi\n\noriginally posted on twcc.com\n\nThis week, Hollywood rolls out ideas involving a giant, a beastmaster, an outlaw, a fictional (or not) child stalker, and a show called Kicking & Screaming. It's either the full moon speaking or it's just another week of Hollywood's Worst Ideas. Read on!\n\nThere Is Only One 'Andre The Giant' - New Biopic Planned, Tough To Cast\n\nAs the saying goes, big things come in small packages. But in the case of Andre \"The Giant\" Roussimoff, big things also come in big, in fact, massive packages. And therein lies the reason it will be nearly impossible to properly cast an upcoming biopic about the legendary wrestler who brought you bandit Fezzik in the 1987 classic film, The Princess Bride. The project is based on an authorized biography called Andre The Giant: Closer To Heaven, and his daughter, Robin Christensen-Roussimoff, will serve as the film's consultant. We assume the title derives from the fact that, at 7ft 4in, Andre's head is \"closer to heaven\" than, say, Snookie's. At that height and weighing well-over 500 pounds, how, exactly, do you fill his sizeable shoes (both literally and figuratively)? Then again, forget about the shoes. It's his signature one-shoulder strap tights we're more concerned about.\n\nLittle Zorro – The Masked Swashbuckler Shrinks In Futureworld\n\nSpeaking of the towering Andre The Giant, let's talk a little about, Gael García Bernal, who is so -- oh, how to put this gently -- \"not\" towering. Depending on what your source is, the 37-year-old Guadalajara-born actor is 5ft 5.5in to 5ft 7in, and an interesting choice to play the rugged, swashbuckling masked outlaw, Don Diego de la Vega aka Zorro. That, however, is exactly what filmmaker Jonás Cuarón has in mind for him. Cuarón has written and will direct Bernal in Z, a reboot of the classic fictional character with a twist: it is set in the future where, apparently, the rumbustious marauder was put into a clothes dryer and shrank. Okay, wait. We get it. Before he and his trusty horse, Tornado, rode through towns donned in a black cape and carrying a rapier, he was riding him around a track donned in Technicolor silk and carrying a whip.\n\nSony Should Say No to Slender Man\n\nOne of the creepiest paranormal characters to come out of the Internet has been Slender Man. For those not in \"the know,\" Slender Man originated as a meme and is depicted as a thin, super tall man in a black suit with a blank, featureless face. Like we said, C-R-E-E-P-Y! Stories that have circulated have him stalking and abducting children, creating a real life moral panic. Back in 2014, two 12-year-old girls allegedly stabbed a classmate 19 times, saying that they wanted to kill her and become proxies for the Slender Man. Now, rumor is it that Sony is developing a horror film based on this \"character.\" We've got a better idea. How about Comedy Central buying the rights, changing genders and calling it Skinny Bitch? That sounds much more palatable.\n\nSyFy Imagines Life On Krypton Well Before Kal-El\n\nFor those who have yet to get enough DC Comics, Marvel Comics or comics period out of your system, Syfy is all set to provide \"the fix\" you need. The cable television channel has given the pilot order for David Goyer's Superman prequel, Krypton. The show is set two generations before the destruction of the Man of Steel's home planet and follows Superman's grandfather as he attempts to save his world from all sorts of brewing brouhaha. Think House Of El meets Who Do You Think You Are? Watch. It'll turn out that Superman's great-uncle seven times removed is Benjamin Franklin.\n\nNew Girl Star to Host Yet Another Reality Show Set In the Wild\n\nOh goodie, another survivalist show. From Lionsgate Television and Matt Kunitz, the executive producer who brought you Wipeout and Fear Factor comes Kicking & Screaming, a Fox reality series to be hosted by New Girl's Hannah Simone. The competition show will have teammates being dropped onto a tropical island, where they have to fight the elements, wild animals (and bugs), hunger, and the lack of cell service. Terrifying! Naked And Afraid, Doomsday Preppers, Dude You're Screwed, Kicking & Screaming. These shows are less \"survivalist\" and more \"fatalist.\" Happy To Be Alive must not test well with target audiences… who are, obviously, in need of Prozac.\n\nCats The Motion Picture: Time To Claw Your Eyes Out\n\nTom Hooper, the man who brought you the Les Misérables movie, is making the leap from peasant to pussycat. Yes, that's right. Cooper is bringing Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats out of the dark alleys and onto a movie soundstage. Not that adapting the hit Broadway musical to film is such a good idea; at least not judging by the fur ball inducing 1998 made-for-TV movie it wasn't. Whether this big screen production turns out to be purr-fect or cat-astrophic remains to be seen. Sorry, we couldn't resist.\n\nIt's 4-Way Tie: TV Networks All To Receive Top Honor\n\nYou know how a lot of parents complain when their kids' soccer teams get trophies even if they've never won a game in their lives? It's one of those \"we don't want to destroy any young, fragile spirits so everyone is a winner in our eyes\" kind of things? Well, the Television Academy is pulling the same thing with the networks. They will be honoring all four major broadcast networks with the Hall of Fame Cornerstone Award. The awards recognize \"the historic vision, creativity and industry leadership of the networks in making a transformational medium possible.\" Has the TV Academy seen some of the schlock the \"big four\" puts out? Hmm. Let's think about where they find the parallel between \"historic vision\" and Dr. Ken. Um, Cornerstone Award. Four networks. Four corners to a cornerstone. We're stretching it, aren't we? Whatever.\n\nNetflix Jumps Into The Reality Game With Sly Stallone"
