        "text": "Mystery Science Theater 3000 (1988–1999; 2017–2018; 2022–) is an American TV show that mocks bad movies by riffing on their strange characters, absurd settings, and silly plot twists, interspersing erudite cultural quips with schoolboy jokes and general zaniness. There are 198 movies, 60 shorts, and 4 specials in the MST3K canon.

You can browse these quotes by scrolling through the page, looking for a specific title using your browser's Find or Search feature, or click on a numbered link in the table of contents. As you pause your mouse over each box in the table, the title of the episode, short, or special will pop up in a tooltip. (Some older browsers don't provide this feature or have it disabled, in which case you can still see the title as a URL in your browser's status bar.)\n\nWhat kind of quotes to add. Much of the humor in Mystery Science Theater 3000 comes from visual or sound sources that cannot be adequately communicated through a text quote page. A good guideline for adding quotes here is to limit them to ones that communicate their humor through the text itself, with a minimum of context. On the other hand, these quotes do include MST3K humor that arises from cultural references that aren't practical to explain within a quote page, so they are left as mental exercises for the reader (or the use of external sites with such explanations).\n\nHow to format quotes. See the discussion page for suggested formatting and more inclusion guidelines.\n\nWhat do the colors mean?

It sure helps out here on the Satellite of Love to get your messages.\n\nServo: Hey Joel, let's listen to one of the messages!\n\nJoel: Alright, that's a good idea. Hey Cambot, could you give it to me on a blue star field screen and give it to me one time, CG bold helvetica straight up on two?\n\nCaller 1: I enjoyed the movie, but really hated the constant interruptions that were on there. It was like being in a theater with a bunch of rude Jr. High teenagers. I hope you don't continue the program, not in that fashion anyway.\n\nServo: What a complete wing-nut!\n\nJoel: Well listen, Servo, everyone is entitled to their opinion. That's what makes the USA great.\n\nCrow: Is that so, Joel Hodgson? I think that guy needs an antispasmodic.\n\nServo: Could I say something to our friendly caller, Joel?\n\nJoel: Of course, Servo.\n\nServo: Hey buddy, is that your head, or did your neck grow a bubble?\n\nJoel: Hey you should talk, listen I think we should listen to another one.\n\nCaller 2: [excitedly] Great stuff!

I looked up 'suspended animation' in the dictionary and I don't think that this is going to be any good at— [a spray of liquid nitrogen turns Crow frozen mid-sentence] —AAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!\n\nJoel: See, I told you guys it would work.\n\n[Hidaka and his Eskimo hosts observe fighter jets pursuing another jet.]\n\nDr. Hidaka: The war even comes to this Eskimo village. Soon there won't be any peace anywhere.\n\n[Cut to a ship cutting through the ice.]\n\nJoel: There's nothing more tragic than a war in an Eskimo village.\n\n[Kenny searches for his turtle Tibby among the shore rocks.]\n\nKenny: Tibby? Tibby? Tibby?\n\nJoel: Like the turtle's gonna call out if he hears him.\n\n[At night, Kenny mopes about his lost stones that he was collecting for \"Gamera's new house\".]\n\nJoel [as Catherine]: When you get up in the morning, Kenny, we'll get you a whole box of gravel.\n\n[While playing back phone messages left by viewers.]\n\nJoel: All you scary guys with the low I.Q.s, don't call any more because you're scaring Gypsy.\n\nGypsy: Yeah, grow a brain already!\n\n[While opening credits roll with a background showing the ocean.]\n\nJoel: The Ocean; the beginning of all life... and all Sandy Frank films.\n\n[A supertanker has just exploded in flames.]\n\nServo: Oh my God, it's Gordon Lightfoot!\n\nHelen: I think he's so wonderful, I love Gamera!\n\nJoel: Keep your shirt on, honey.\n\nServo: Six-year-olds and nuclear weapons: a combination that just can't be beat.\n\nCrow: Looks kinda skinny. Must be a Carpenter ant. [chuckling] Carpenter... get it? Carpenter ant. See 'cause—\n\nJoel: [horrified] Oh no...\n\nCrow: Never mind.\n\nJoel: You don't mean that...\n\nServo: Ant-orexic.\n\nCrow: [laughs] See? Servo got it.\n\nServo: You know, ants can carry entire watermelons. And big chicken legs. Happened in The Flintstones.\n\nCrow: I had a chicken leg once. I had to wear corrective shoes.\n\n[During an unpleasant closeup of the queen ant laying eggs.]\n\nCrow: Hope no one's eating rice at this point.\n\nServo: So Crow, if we ever get off this ship, what's the first thing you're going to do when we get to Earth?\n\nCrow: Uh well the first thing I'm gonna do is kill Sandy Frank!\n\nServo: Oh, that's just a given!\n\n[While the end credits roll.]\n\nCrow: I thought it was deep...\n\nJoel: What did you think, Servo?\n\nServo: I thought it was pathetic.\n\nCrow: So deep, we should've been wearing boots.\n\nServo: This made flying turtles look good.\n\n[Tony and Koenig watch a video of an \"alien\" — a man whose face shows through his pumpkin-shaped and -colored rubber mask.]\n\nJoel: Kind of a jack-o'-lantern monster.\n\nServo: [deadpan] Ooh, very scary.

I had a knick on my Brimble once.\n\nJoel: The plot thickens.\n\nServo: Like rancid pea soup.\n\nJoel: Just because you lost your hair, doesn't mean you have to take it out on the planet.\n\n[Blonde bimbo Angela Garland boards the plane, still wearing her \"Miss SST\" outfit and sash.]\n\nAngela: [vapidly] Hello!\n\n[The flight attendants watch her sashay to her seat.]\n\nCrow [as Attendant]: Please put your brain under the seat in front of you.\n\n[Passengers are boarding.]\n\nCrow [as Attendant]: Hi, you're in the part of the plane that falls off.\n\n[Having achieved a cruising altitude of 65,000 feet, Captain Walsh gets on the intercom.]\n\nCapt. Walsh: Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain Walsh. If you'll look out your windows, you'll see a sight that very few except the astronauts have ever seen.\n\nServo [as Capt. Walsh]: An oncoming plane.\n\nCapt. Walsh: Although the sky above remains black…\n\nCrow [as Capt. Walsh]: … our wing is completely on fire, not unlike re-entry.\n\n[As the SST stabilizes, Kingman herds the passengers toward the rear of the plane.]\n\nCarla Stanley: Please, do something!

Servo hangs back.]\n\nServo: Who won? ... Who won? ... Who won the game?!\n\nDr. Erhardt: We got a letter from the Mad Scientist League. They say they're gonna revoke our licenses--that we're not really mad enough!\n\nDr. Forrester: I know, look, it says here, at best we're Mildly Peeved Researchers.\n\n[After a helpful title card informs us that \"What you are about to see could happen to any city, anywhere.\"]\n\nServo: Oh, good. ... It can happen in any city to any person. So wha–\n\n[Barry Newman's credit appears.]\n\nCrow: Like Barry Newman.\n\nServo: So stop watching TV and get ready for the big huge fire!

It was torn off!\n\nServo: You say that like it's a bad thing.\n\n[The train carrying some of the main characters arrives in Trollenberg.]\n\nServo [as Conductor]: Trollenberg, home of the Crawling Eye. All stops lead to a bloody death.\n\n[A woman- Anne- stares blankly at a mountain as bizarre music plays.]\n\nJoel [as mountain]: [deeply] I am Mount Svengali. You will do as I say.\n\nAnne: [after being asked by her sister if she's troubled by anything] I feel wonderful; I just wish others would stop treating me like an invalid.\n\nJoel: How about a wheelchair?\n\n[after Anne falls on top of Alan Brooks (played by Forrest Tucker) as he's reading his newspaper]\n\nAlan Brooks: It's fine. It was just the baseball scores.\n\nJoel: It's just a prop, anyway.\n\nAlan Brooks: [he and Prof. Crevett are discussing the recent string of climbing accidents on the mountain] Where people climb mountains, there are lots of accidents.\n\nProf. Crevett: That's true; and sometimes- the bodies- they disappear. But here, the search parties go out, and always they find nothing. Why do you suppose that is?\n\nServo: [as Brooks] They're not good search parties?\n\nJoel: What's a giant eye going to do, pick you up and wink you to death?\n\nServo: Is there a sequel to this movie?\n\nCrow: Yeah; The Eye-ger Sanction!\n\nServo: Starring Burl Eye-ves.\n\n[Joel chastises the bots for continuous eye puns; however, moments later...]\n\nJoel: I spy with my little eye...\n\nServo: You hypocrite!\n\n[Anne is feeling faint after the giant eyes attacking the observatory have been killed and set ablaze by an air strike.

[Erhardt sternly clears his throat] OK, twice.\n\nDr. Erhardt: It was three times!\n\nDr. Forrester: The third time I used the incendiaries, and it didn't make the building blow up, it just made it burn. Really... quickly.\n\nDr. Erhardt: [while introducing their creation for the Invention Exchange, a chalkboard vinyl on a record player] Okay- so you're throwing a party, it's 3 AM, and none of the guests are leaving. That's when you bring out the Chalkman!\n\nDr. Forrester: Yes, as every self-respecting scientist knows, the sound of human fingernails on a chalkboard is most annoying. It initiates the primal fear response in all mammals, much like a chimpanzee scurrying across the plains of the Serengeti. Simply put your Chalkman on the platen. [shows record] Now this is a real chalkboard. (Set on) Side B; excellent. And you'll just notice the tonearm has real human fingernails embedded in the hand, now place it on the platen... [scratches the disc, creating a shrill sound] Now open it.\n\nDr. Erhardt: They'll stay.\n\nDr. Forrester: Close it.

This is my brother Xenon and my other brother Xenon.\n\nCommando Cody: Do you mind telling me why your men are carrying out that campaign of destruction on Earth?\n\nServo [as Retik]: It's an election year.\n\nRetik: Not at all. They are merely softening up your defenses for our impending invasion.\n\nCommando Cody: Why do you want to invade the Earth?\n\nRetik: Because the atmosphere on the Moon has become so thin and dry, it is impossible for us to raise food, except in pressurized greenhouses.\n\nJoel [as Cody]: Get a humidifier!\n\n[Dr. Almada voices-over scenes of the doomed romance between Aztec maiden Xochi and warrior Popoca.]\n\nDr. Almada: So they decided to run away, even though it was her sacred duty to preserve her maidenhood and be sacrificed to the god Tezcatlipoca.\n\nJoel [as Dr. Almada]: The god of decaffeinated coffee.\n\nDr. Almada: They were discovered by the tribal priests.\n\n[A priest receives a steaming bowl, turning to the restrained Popoca to force-feed him.]\n\nServo [as Dr. Almada]: They prepared hearty soups and broths and forced them on their guests, for they truly knew how to handle a hungry man.\n\n[A priest carries the prone Xochi up the aisle to the sacrificial altar.]\n\nJoel: Kind of looks like Dirty Dancing, doesn't it?\n\nServo [as Xochi]: [singing to \"(I've Had) The Time of My Life\"]\n\nI've reached the end of my life\n\nAnd I'm waiting for the knife to fall.\n\nServo: [as Popaca reveals himself as the titular Aztec Mummy] I am not an animal; I am a Aztec Mummy!\n\n[from a distance in a cemetery, Dr. Krupp and his scarred henchman Bruno observe the Aztec Mummy of Popoca]\n\nBruno: [of Popoca] You stinkin' devil! How I'd like to chop your rotten flesh to pieces!\n\nJoel: Bruno, stop letting hate run your life.\n\n[The evil Dr. Krupp unveils his creation, a \"human robot\".]\n\nDr. Krupp: Tonight I'm going to put it to the supreme test!\n\nJoel: The Cosmo sex quiz?\n\nDr. Krupp: [continues to boast about his \"human robot\"] With its shining pension, no human being on this earth can oppose me!\n\nServo: Wait, a human robot? There's a flaw right there.\n\nCrow: [while Popoca tears apart Krupp's robot with relative ease] I looked up \"anticlimax\" in the dictionary; it said \"See 'Aztec Mummy'.\"\n\n[After the stars a list of names under \"With\" comes up.]\n\nJoel: These are the extras...they'll probably get killed.\n\n[Last week's cliffhanger is resolved by Cody simply diving away from a ray blast.]\n\nServo: Oh, if they'd only shown him diving out of the way, I wouldn't have spent the week worrying about him.\n\nJoel: [as Cody is fighting off a henchman] Just give him a headbutt. Give him a headbutt! He's just wearing spandex on his head!\n\nServo: [as Cody beats up Retik] That's for Bryant Gumbel; that's for Gene Shalit; and that's for dressing up like Carmen Miranda! God, that was dumb!\n\nCrow: Those are all Bob Mackie creations, aren't they?\n\nCody: [as he and one of his fellow scientists are fleeing an approaching Moon Men tank, pointing towards a narrow cliff opening] Maybe we can dodge around those rocks and lose 'em.\n\nServo: Maybe you can use the ray gun. Y'know the big one that blows up things? Like Moon Cars, perhaps?\n\nServo: Why does he have to kill them to prove his point? Can't he just show them a pie chart or something?\n\nProf. Blaine: Mingling the blood of man and beast is downright sacrilege!\n\nJoel: Tell that to the NFL!\n\n[Prof. Blaine is pacing around aimlessly instead of fulfilling his promise to Dr. Cameron that he'd inject Petro with Cameron's werewolf serum.]\n\nServo: Just shoot him! You told him you would. Don't pad your part!\n\nServo: [singing to the tune of The Beverly Hillbillies theme as a farmer encounters Petro in the swamp]\n\nCome and listen to the story of a man named Jed A poor mountaineer, barely kept his family fed Then one day, he was shooting at some food...\n\nJoel: [joining in] ...And up from the swamp came a big ugly dude.\n\nServo: Wolfman, that is; black teeth, gnarled face.\n\n[the farmer attempts to shoot at Petro twice, but it doesn't even phase the wolfman as he lumbers forward]\n\nServo: The next thing you know, old Jed was really scared.\n\nThe kin folk said \"Jed, get away from there!\" Said \"My cabin is the place I ought to be,\" So he loaded up his drawers and he told his family...\n\nJoel: Good one, Crow.\n\nServo: [I'm] Servo.\n\nCrow: Ah, over here.\n\nJoel: Right, sorry; good one, Servo. [turns towards Crow] You too, Crow.\n\nServo: [unenthused] Gee, thanks, Ed!\n\nCrow: I didn't do anything.\n\nDr. Cameron: [to Prof. Fitzgerald] I could give you an injection that would grant you the strength of ten men.\n\nCrow: [as Cameron] ...And their hair.\n\nDr. Cameron: Or- following the line of evolution- how about a pair of donkey's ears?
