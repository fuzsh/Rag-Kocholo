        "text": "Manhunt of Mystery Island is a 1945 science fiction movie serial. It was the thirty-sixth serial produced by Republic Pictures (of a total of sixty-six) and the first released in 1945.[2]\n\nIt is the penultimate 15-chapter serial to be released by the studio. The year 1945, the end of the Golden Age of Serials,[3] was the last in which Republic released any 15-chapter serials, the remainder being either 12 or 13 chapters in length.\n\nIn 1966 footage from the serial was edited together into the 100-minute film Captain Mephisto and the Transformation Machine."
