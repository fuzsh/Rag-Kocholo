        "text": "Ranked By\n\n887 votes\n\n216 voters\n\nVoting Rules\n\nOnly movies featuring Zorro as a main character.\n\nSince the first official adaptation of Zorro in 1920, the masked hero has returned to the screen dozens of times. From TV shows and feature films to the earliest serials, Zorro stories are regularly being remade, adapted for the modern era, or the inspiration for an homage.\n\nDisney has produced several Zorro TV shows and movies, like the 1958 Sign of Zorro or both the 1957 and the 1990 Zorro television series. Already a popular subject for movie serials in the '40s, Zorro movies were made in Italy at a rapid pace in the '60s, with multiple films released a year, like Lâ€™Ombra di Zorro, El Zorro la Volpe, and even Zorro Contro Maciste (retitled Sampson and the Slave Queen).\n\nAdaptations of the Zorro character can be official or unofficial, with Zorro Productions controlling the trademarks and copyrights to the Zorro character. Almost all Zorro movies and shows are official but some are note, including the telenovela Zorro: La Espada y la Rosa and the anime Kaiketsu Zorro.\n\nWhether you love them for their particular take on one of the earliest masked avengers, for their cheesiness, or how well they adapt the stories, which Zorro shows or movies are the best?\n\nLatest additions: Zorro\n\nOver 200 Ranker voters have come together to rank this list of The Best Zorro Movies and Shows\n\nRanked by\n\nTired of Governor Quintero's (J. Edward Bromberg) exploitation of poor Californians, Don Diego (Tyrone Power) decides to fight back and assumes the identity of Zorro. A masked hero with a sword, Zorro fights on behalf of the people against the corrupt Quintero and his wicked assistant, Captain Pasquale (Basil Rathbone). At the same time, Diego falls for Lolita (Linda Darnell), the governor's niece, and he pursues her while constantly battling to oust Quintero from power.\n\nIn the swashbuckling adventure, The Mask of Zorro, Alejandro Murrieta (Antonio Banderas), a bandit with a troubled past, is transformed into a hero by the legendary Zorro himself, Don Diego de la Vega (Anthony Hopkins). This action-packed film combines elements of romance and revenge as Alejandro seeks to dismantle the corrupt regime that ruined his life. Elena Montero (Catherine Zeta-Jones), the beautiful and spirited daughter of Don Diego, adds another layer of intrigue to this tale. Director Martin Campbell masterfully weaves together these threads in a captivating narrative full of daring swordfights and thrilling horse chases.\n\n3\n\nZorro is an American action-adventure western drama series produced by Walt Disney Productions. Based on the well-known Zorro character, the series premiered on October 10, 1957 on ABC. The final network broadcast was July 2, 1959. Seventy-eight episodes were produced, and 4 hour-long specials were aired on the Walt Disney anthology series between October 30, 1960 and April 2, 1961.\n\n4\n\nZorro, also known as The New Zorro, New World Zorro, and Zorro 1990, is an American action-adventure drama series featuring Duncan Regehr as the character of Zorro. Regehr portrayed the fearless Latino hero and fencer on The Family Channel from 1990 to 1993. The series was shot entirely in Madrid, Spain and produced by New World Television, The Family Channel, Ellipse Programme of Canal Plus, Beta TV, and RAI. 88 episodes of the series were produced, 10 more than the first Zorro television series, which was produced by Disney in the late 1950s. Since 2011, the series is airing in the United States on Retro TV as The New Zorro. Peter Rodgers Organization is the distributor for this version of Zorro.\n\nThe masked avenger steals money and gives to the poor.\n\nZorro discovers family secrets that will change his destiny forever."
