        "text": "February 13, 2013\n\nIf there's one thing you can take to the bank after reading this book, it is that everything Skippyjon Jones learned about Mexico, he learned from watching Taco Bell commercials. From the non-sequitur rhymes that mutilate the spanish language, to the Chihuahuas' preoccupation with beans, the boiled-down rendition of Mexican culture is about as \"Mexican\" as cow entrails squeezed through ammonia is \"beef.\"\n\nIf the entirety of Schachner's creation was\n\ninspired by the Taco Bell dog, I wouldn't\n\nbe surprised. The only thing that's missing\n\nfrom this book is a reference to Mountain\n\nDew \"Baja Blast.\"\n\nWe can't hold Skippy completely accountable, however. He's a sheltered young boy who can only rely on the shallow intimations of other species and cultures he finds in popular culture, to escape his dreary existence. The fact that he spends his time with birds reveals to the audience that Skippy's condition necessitates escape. His family lives on a steady diet of sardines and miracle whip. Mangled toys lay in a broken heap by his toy box. So he looks to the only inspiration to fuel his dream: television. Where else would he glean these warped notions of Mexican culture from?\n\nWhen I read this book, I couldn't help but wonder if our protagonist was a byproduct of the author's ignorance, or of her brilliance. On one hand, we can surmise that Skippy's limited scope provides a direct lens into the feeble mind of the author. On the other hand, perhaps this book is a brutally accurate depiction of how culture is diffused through the American population that refuses to look beyond the light therapy box in every living room across this country. Generally speaking, American pop culture reduces all other cultures to endearing dogs, dancing candles with accents, etc. That's on one end of the spectrum anyway. On the other end of the spectrum, these same cultures are depicted as foreboding sources of crime, threats to social order, once they enter our borders. Skippy's fantasy is perpetuated by the endearing depiction of cultures. They remain outside our borders. We (Skippy) travel(s) to them, interact(s) with them, become their salvation under the guise of being one of their own, and then return home safely. Do you taste that? That's Joseph Campbell's hero's journey perverted by blind patriotism. Skippy isn't just a children's book about a cat uncertain of his identity. It is a book about the vitality of America's delusion of grandeur on a global scale, and with every sale the book reinforces the strength of this delusion.\n\nDecember 29, 2008\n\nThis is the worst kind of \"literature\" to expose your children to. It's filled with stereotypes and fake accents. It's sad that Judy Schachner doesn't know any better.\n\nSeptember 13, 2012\n\nSkippjon gets in trouble, sent to his room, thinks he's a chihuahua and all of a sudden he begins adding O to the end of his words to speak Spanish? This book is seething in racism! How have more people not seen it and given it awards? All the chihuahuas he meets have very stereotypical type names. Making statements about rice and beans, because yes that's all Mexican people like to eat?\n\nThen they have a fiesta and siesta while the chihuahuas carry around maracas and mariachi hats? Come on!\n\nI cannot imagine a person of Mexican descent liking this book, I'm deeply offended by it. Not to mention that the plot of story makes very little sense. The mom in the beginning of the story is scolding him, and by the end she's hugging him for still disobeying. Not sure you're teaching your child anything worthy by reading this book.\n\nSeptember 7, 2020\n\nIn observance of Banned Books Week, today I was showing a class of juniors the most challenged books of 2018. #8 on the list is Skippyjon Jones, challenged “for depicting stereotypes of Mexican culture.” There was a wave of sentimental support for Skippyjon, mostly from Hispanic students. Because I didn’t know the book, I briefly stopped the presentation and made a show of putting it on hold from my local library, and I said I would read it before class tomorrow.\n\nSo, I did. Does Skippyjon Jones depict stereotypes of Mexican culture? Yes. But is depicting the same thing as demeaning? Maybe, maybe not, but either way it represents a narrow way of thinking, and it makes me queasy. But book challenges also make me queasy! I don’t think this book demeans Mexican culture, but I also don’t think it celebrates Mexican culture. It mostly just plays around with linguistic features of the Spanish language and a stereotypical Mexican accent, although it also includes several Spanish words and phrases used in appropriate contexts.\n\nAll in all, it’s not a very good book, so why did so many Hispanic students declare their support for it? My best guess is that they liked having a book that included their language, even if it’s sort of silly. I can see how if the book is read aloud energetically, it might be entertaining, and maybe that is in their experience banks from elementary school. All of this suggests to me a need for more, and better, fun picture books featuring Spanish language and Mexican culture. In other words, don’t ban it—after all, a surprising number of students like it—but add more titles to the shelves that don’t rely on stereotypes for their appeal.\n\nFebruary 4, 2010\n\nWhile 1000+ GoodReads members seem to disagree, to me this book is rather offensive. It may have received the E. B. White Read Aloud award in 2004, but that doesn't mean it should be exempt from criticism. The racial stereotypes are awful (banditos -- really?!), the repeated reference to beans as if they are a defining characteristic of Latinos is insulting, and adding the letter 'o' and long 'ees' to random words to make them sounds more Spanish is disrespectful. While the book was surely meant to be funny and cute, mocking an entire group of people, their culture, their food, and their language is not acceptable and encourages children to adopt false ideas about Mexicans and Latinos.\n\nJanuary 28, 2009\n\nOkay, I'm giving this five stars because I think it would make an absolutely outstanding read aloud book. And I'm not the only one--it's won the EB White Read Aloud Book Award. And also, this is the sort of book I would have loved as a kid who loved interesting words and sounds. There are SO many fun-fun-fun things to say in this book! ;-p I won't give it away, but \"Skipyjon\" is just the beginning. Plus, the pictures are fun, the cats are cute, and it has a lot of absurdity and adventure and imagination. Also, I think bi-lingual (Spanish) learners would appreciate this, too, as it definitely has some South-of-the-Border flare and terms.\n\nNote, though, that there is some controversy about the book and that it presents negative stereotypes. I am usually sensitive to such things but this one slipped under my radar. For more about the controversy, so you can decide for yourself if this is a book you want to share with your children, see here: http://msdecamp.blogspot.com/2008/06/...\n\nSeptember 26, 2019\n\nClap clap! 5 star audiobook. Banned book week.\n\nSorry, a Siamese cat pretending to be a chihuahua with a Spanish accent is not offensive.\n\nIf a chihuahua was pretending to be a Siamese cat and spoke with an Asian accent, would that be offensive? Um, no.\n\nBanned book:\n\nMy name is Skippito Friskito. (clap-clap)\n\nI fear not a single bandito. (clap-clap)\n\nMy manners are mellow,\n\nI’m sweet like the Jell-O,\n\nI get the job done, yes indeed-o.\n\nSkippyjon Jones, a Siamese cat that pretends to be a Chihuahua superhero. Skippyjon speaks English, but his super hero alter ego speaks in Mock Spanish in his recurring and imaginative quests. Speaking “Spanish” in hyperanglized fashion recasts Skippyjon from an English-speaking (white) cat to a Spanish-accented (brown) dog. His auditory performance of Mexicanness, what Reina Prado considers “sonic brownface,” reeks of white privilege as he code-switches from cat/white/English to dog/brown/”Spanish.” What’s worse, as a children’s book, directed at those between the impressionable ages of 4-8, Skippyjon encourages both adult readers and young readers to read out loud and perform sonic brownface. Listening to the book’s trite word choice (amigos, adios, frijoles), fake Spanish (indeed-o, mask-ito) and embellished accents (“ees” for is) trains the ear on how to speak “Mexican,” presumably, of course, for the listening amusement of non-Mexicans.\n\nDecember 5, 2010\n\nChildren seem to enjoy this book much more than myself. They love the character of Skippyjon Jones-- a Siamese cat who thinks he is a Chihuahua. I would agree that the play on words is worthwhile, but not at the expense of murdering the Spanish language. No matter how much I try to lighten up about it, I believe it pokes a little to much fun at my cultural heritage. I would use this book as a critical component in reading comprehension-- and ask the students if the author is fairly representing the hispanic culture. This book is geared for Kindergarten-Second grade students.\n\nJune 25, 2009\n\nTerribly offensive! I had the misfortune to hear the author read this, using a \"Frito Bandito\" voice for Skippyjon. Ugh.\n\nNovember 9, 2013\n\nWhat is there not to like about a young Siamese cat who likes to play pretend, especially when he likes to pretend to be a Chihuahua--the Mexican dog of royalty? As an American of Mexican ancestry, who happened to be born and grew up along the Texas-Mexican border (and currently resides in the same border town of El Paso), I didn't find it too difficult to step beyond the controversy and the \"lack of political correctness\" that many adult readers find in this children's book to see how witty, cute and funny Skippyjon's antics really are. He is after all, just a kitten of a cat. Sure there are stereotypes, but I didn't see them as being mean-spirited or anything that a real child wouldn't be guilty of doing in the spirit of \"innocent pretending.\" As a child, I might have created some of the same stereotypes Skippyjon did, especially in my speech. I speak English, \"Texan,\" Spanish, and Spanglish very well and can change my manner of speaking--my accent at will. I didn't find Skippyjon's accent offensive. He is trying to be a Chihuahua after all. As they say, \"Imitation is a sincere form of flattery and idolization.\" Skippyjon loves his Chihuahua alter ego and that is cool! (The only thing cooler than Skippito speaking Spanish, would have been Skippito speaking a few words in Nahuatl--the language of the Aztecs).\n\nAfter reading some of the posts, I am left wondering if as adults, we haven't created a world that is too sensitive? It seems to me that people get too easily offended these days. I guess it all depends on your perspective. Stereotypes exist everywhere. Stereotypes exist due to the fact that there is some truth to them. Stereotyping is normal. Treating others badly is not necessarily the result of stereotyping. Treating others badly comes from a lack of respect for others and for oneself. In my life, I have encountered prejudice, but it is not something I look for or dwell on. I am not hypersensitive about it and I certainly don't walk around with a prejudice radar on. Quite frankly if someone ever treats me badly, I just assume it is their issue--their personality--their shortcoming--their bad day---their problem. My culture and my ethnicity is part of who I am, but it doesn't define my core sense of humanity and beyond being respectful towards others and expecting the same in return, I don't worry about what people of my or other cultures, races or ethnicities think of me, my family or my ancestors. People will believe what they want to believe.\n\nMy daughter and I picked up this book, because it came up on our search for Chihuahua at our local library. It was a fun little children's book. We hope the others are fun, too, and that we won't be left saying, \"Ay Chihuahua!\" (The only \"Ay Chihuahua, my daughters and I want to be saying is at the El Paso Chihuahuas Minor League Baseball Games.\") Seriously though, as adults, I think we need to find and draw a line between being sensitive towards others and being too sensitive and creating controversy where there really is none. Tossing out the book? Worrying if our Mexican or Hispanic friends would be offended? Cringing when we read it--because we know better? Being offended because we are Mexican or Hispanic of Mexican origin? (I think one has a right to be offended, but ONLY if we have never sterotyped anything lest you be a hypocite. If you (Hispanic or Mexican or even none of the aforementioned) have ever watched a movie where the bad guy/girl had black hair, dark eyes and dressed in black and agreed with this picture--guess what you have stereotyped--by this account most of the world's population is evil! If you have ever watched a movie or read a book where all rich people are mean and materialistic and agreed,...guess what you have stereotyped--not everyone of them is Scrooge! If you've ever laughed at a Texas drawl, immitated a Texas drawl or imagined Texans to be gun toting rednecks or cowboys who drive pick up trucks down dirt roads,...again you have stereotyped! I don't think I would find many non-hypocrites in this world when it comes to being offended by a stereotype!)\n\nSkippyjon Jones is a good little children's book about pretend. It is an entertaining story that can be used as a springboard to talk about stereotyping and not allowing our stereotypes to lead us to treat each other badly. (Of course, it can also be enjoyed for the sheer sense of enjoyment of a story about a small child's game of pretend--without getting into all the controversry of the book.) I find a lot of good in Skippyjon Jones. Without the Skippyjon's of this world these kinds of conversations and the learning that results from them disappear..,..how good would that be?e\n\nMay 5, 2017\n\nThis entire series is offensive and racist. It uses mock spanish and peddles racist stereotypes as funny. This is how racist stereotypes are taught to young children - by presenting them as funny. It's just not ok.\n\nAugust 7, 2009\n\nWhere has Skippyjon Jones been all my life? I love him. And his mother. With such a strong familial identity, Skippyjon is free to try out different identities, including being a bird and a chihuahua. A bandito chihuahua. The swordfighter. He sings too.\n\nHis mother calls Skippyjon lots of names. They are in jest, of course, and none are as bad as Skippyjon's real name, so Skippyjon is okay with it. Smart mom. I should have thought of that. My kids hate it when I call them \"bongee bobos\" from the well of my deep mother love.\n\nMama Junebug Jones (bad names seem to be a family tradition) calls her naughty kitty:\n\n1. Mr. Kitten Britches\n\n2. Mr. Fuzzy Pants\n\n3. Mr. Fluffernutter\n\n4. Mr. Cocopugs\n\nI want a mom like that.\n\nI will leave you with a Skippyjon song\n\n\"My name is Skippito Friskito (clap-clap)\n\nI fear not a single bandito (clap-clap)\n\nMy manners are mellow\n\nI'm sweet like the Jell-O\n\nI get the job done, yes indeed-o (clap-clap)\"\n\nApril 30, 2019\n\nThis book was embarrassingly bad. It's filled with stereotypes of Mexicans and it makes fun of the Spanish language by randomly adding o to English words. It's hard to believe that this was published in the 2000s.\n\nJanuary 15, 2018\n\nIf you're trying to raise a kid to learn about and respect the many cultures and people around them, this is not a book you need in your home.\n\nJust awful. Mutilates a language and culture, missing an opportunity to help kids learn to respect and be curious about other people and cultures. Judy Schachner engages in the pathetic concept known as \"trash Spanish\", belittling another language for cheap laughs. The book shares a place in history with the Taco Bell dog and Shwarzenegger's \"hasta la vista, baby\".\n\nThe fact that it was written after 2000, and receives so many blind positive reviews shows just how far we have to go. Stop buying this book and giving it to people. Someone gave this book to my half-Mexican, bilingual 3 year-old son for his birthday and said it was one of their favorites because of the Spanish words and phrases. It's 2017, and I shouldn't need to say it, but I'm gonna say it anyway - adding \"ito\" to the end of words is not Spanish. Even if it was a parody, which it is not, a 3 year-old is not picking up nuance like that (again, especially when it is non-existant).\n\nThere are so many other choices for books that are hilarious when read, or that help kids learn another language, no need to waste time on this. Here's a few bilingual books I'd recommend.\n\nA perfect Season for Dreaming / Un tiempo perfecto para soñar\n\nLos Colibries de Nazca\n\nCancion de pulpo\n\nSeptember 22, 2020\n\nSkippyjon Jones is on my favorites shelf because the character is distinct, likable, relatable and memorable. I can imagine children laughing out loud as they learn about Skippy's antics and thinking of him as a friend. Considered fiction, it contains the ever-popular element of having the main character be an animal. Designed for primary readers, it can be enjoyed as a laugh out loud whole class read or a book to be enjoyed again and again on a reader's own.\n\nIn the reading classroom, teachers can use this book in two ways. This book offers readers fluency practice to be able to read his dialogue like it sounds as if he is speaking. It also offers learning in character motivation and how that helps to understand a story as well as how it effects fluent reading.\n\nFebruary 5, 2009\n\nI'm not really sure why I liked this so much - but I did! It's a fun story with ADORABLE illustrations!\n\nSkippyjon's a cat with a vivid imagination and loves pretending to be various kinds of creatures. Also, there's a nice selection of Spanish words, and the author does a good job of letting you know what the Spanish word means, without actually writing \"Uno = One.\" So it's more fun to learn.\n\nAugust 26, 2016\n\nI loved this when I first read it in college (I had roommates studying elementary education), but I always felt too uncomfortable with the accent to read it aloud myself. I'm embarrassed that I'm only just now realizing that's because it's a pretty insulting accent. I would definitely not want to read it to children.\n\nDecember 18, 2013\n\nI just read this to my daughter last night and it is brilliant. I had a fun time doing the Spanish accent he takes on in the book as Skipito and I think I enjoyed it more than my daughter :-) I definitely recommend this one!\n\nAugust 4, 2023\n\nIn my top 5 favorite books that I’ve read to my niece I think everyone should read Skippyjon Jones what an icon\n\nJanuary 6, 2022\n\nI may only be 12.5% Latino and only 12 months old, but a book about Mexican dogs obsessed with beans was a little too much for my racial sensitivities.\n\n“Yip, yippee, yippito! (clap-clap)\n\nOur hero is el skippito! (clap-clap)\n\nHe’s the dog of our dreams\n\nWho delivered the beans\n\nAnd now we can make our burritos! (clap-clap)”\n\nJuly 1, 2021\n\nWe received this book as a gift from a family member so I was excited to add it to our little library. However, I just felt really uncomfortable reading the mock Spanglish out loud to my toddler and ended up not finishing it.\n\nOctober 23, 2022\n\nI loved reading these books to my younger son when he was small. They are the most fun to read aloud. I would even call him some of the affectionate names used in this book, which used to drive him crazy!\n\nSeptember 6, 2017\n\nMy oldest loves this book! Great story to expand his imagination.\n\nDecember 28, 2010\n\nThe main character of this story is a Siamese kitten (Skippyjon) who believes he is a Chihuahua. Along with his alternate personality he imagines he is in Mexico when he enters into this closet. In his closet he becomes a hero and confronts an enormous bumble bee aka as El Blimpo Bumblebeeto Bandito.\n\nMy first observation was that the media used appears to be chalk and charcoal. By lightly smudging the chalk, the drawings seem to have a soft texture. This enhances the fur on the kittens and Chihuahuas, the feathers on the birds, and the fuzzy bumblebee. By smearing the white chalk used to highlight the window panes, we can see a slight glare that creates an illusion of light reflecting across the glass. The colors used are a mixture of warm and cool hues. The warm colors, yellow, orange, and red go well with the ‘Mexican’ setting inside the closet. Of course Mexico is really only in Skippyjon’s imagination, but the varied colors from one end of the spectrum to the other authenticate the festive atmosphere at a fiesta. When scenes are dominated by cool colors we see a siesta with darker blue and purple skies. This imparts a mood of restfulness. In another scene when the huge bumble bee passes overhead, the page is nearly covered by a light blue shadow cast by the bee. Within the bee’s shadow smaller darker images of the fleeing Chihuahuas darken the page. You can feel the fear in the ‘cool darkness,’ as they scatter out of the range of the bumble bee.\n\nThe lines in the story’s art are mostly diagonal portraying action as the reader follows the bouncing Skippyjon from top to bottom across the story’s pages. When the bumble bee is punctured by Skippyjon’s sword the explosion is not only evident by the burst of lines suggesting the movement of beans flying everywhere. It turns out the bumble bee is really a pinata filled with jellybeans. The chaotic scene allows the reader to imagine the sound the beans would make as they rained down to the floor.\n\nThroughout the text, the dominate figure is Skippyjon and the bumble bee. When Skippyjon looks into his mirror and sees himself as a Chihuahua, we see the enlarged face of a real Chihuahua peering back. This is the only realistic drawing and emphasizes Skippyjon’s belief that he is not a Siamese kitten, but a Chihuahua instead.\n\nRead\n\nApril 29, 2019\n\nI see this book go out often and this is my first time reading it because I saw it on the banned book list for 2018 for \"Reason: challenged for depicting stereotypes of Mexican culture\" according to ALA So, not being a part of the Mexican community, I wanted to do some research to get some others perspective on it.\n\nhttps://soundstudiesblog.com/2014/05/...\n\nThis link in particular I thought was insightful.\n\nI did read the book 1st before I was looking online. The book was kinda meh for me. I didn't read it out loud and I think that's the point of the book is that it has fun sounds and imagination adventure in it. There was something I couldn't put my finger on - it is the mock Spanish and the \"put on his best Spanish accent\" line in the book kinda hit me oddly. I was kinda torn between him, a kid, playing make believe and having limited knowledge has to make assumptions and use stereotypes about the culture to play? OR is this was written by someone who has an fun word play idea, uses stereotypes and mock-spanish because she (the author) may not understand how this could be portrayed as hurtful to a community? To be fair, i don't think there was any ill-will when writing this and I can't speak for her own experiences.\n\nAnyway!\n\nI would love to know what you guys think about this book!\n\nWe like to read banned books and celebrate them and check them out here at the library!\n\n~Ashley\n\nMarch 21, 2012\n\nI've picked up Skippyjon Jones off of the shelf at the library a few times thinking that I'd read it to the kids, but every single time I've put it back. When I read the book to myself I can't help but think, \"this story is ridiculous, and it makes no sense. I'll find something else.\" Well, today I just went ahead and took the book to the kids and read it to them. What I discovered is that when you read Skippyjon Jones aloud, the language and wordplay just pops to life. It crackles with vivacity, and it has a lyrical quality that compels the reader to modulate their voice with the undulation of the language. Reading Skippyjon Jones is like reading well-crafted poetry.\n\nThe language is put together in such a fascinating way that it really kept the attention of my niece and nephew. Not only were they practicing rolling some of the words off of their tongues (and laughing at my efforts to do so--\"yip, yippee, yippito\" is *really* hard for me to say), but they were also enjoying the story that was being told. I have to admit, that when read aloud, the story made a lot more sense to me, too, and it was pretty cute. So, all in all, I have a new appreciation for Skippyjon Jones, and I'll look for more of these books to read to the kids.\n\nJuly 20, 2016\n\nSkippyJon Jones is a Siamese cat that wants to be a Chihuahua and has great adventures all while in this bedroom. His mother does not at all like the fact that he wants to be a dog, so she sends him to his room to think Siamese. While there, he finds a mask and sword and becomes “Skippito Friskito” and he enters his closet. On his adventure, he saves his band of Chihuahua friends from a bad “Bumblebeeto.”\n\nThis is a wonderful anthropomorphic picture book to read aloud. It has funny illustrations of SkippyJon’s big adventure that match the colorful language on the pages. There are lots of Spanish and pseudo-Spanish words throughout the book. The reader can have a lot of fun reading in a Spanish accent when SkippyJon becomes Skippito. The book also contains lots of rhymes and is fun and interesting to hear. This story could be used to teach students about rhymes, be a beginning source to get students interested in the Spanish language, and shows how the use of onomatopoeia can enhance aloud storytelling. I would recommend this book for reading to grades K-2."
