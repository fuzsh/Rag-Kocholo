        "text": "ZORRO'S BLACK WHIP (1944)\n\nLower your expectations. Zorro is not anywhere to be found here, his name is not even mentioned except in the title. All you're going to find is an okay, slightly above average 1940s Western serial. Go into it with that frame of mind, and you'll probably enjoy ZORRO'S BLACK WHIP well enough.\n\nWell, it's 1889 and Idaho is considering statehood. Now, Idaho is a fine state, mostly forests and mountains, producing more than its share of agricultural products other than potatoes. I have nothing against Idaho, you never hear about the Crips and the Bloods carrying out gang wars there or any Idaho kiddy-porn monopoly. It's just that the question of when they decided to join the Union is not the dramatic stuff of legend, so the premise here is not automatically like the tense situations of when would the US enter WW I or whether the first moon landing would be successful, that's all I'm saying.\n\nOpposing the move toward statehood is a gang of bandits, owlhoots, low-life and so forth (led by the manager of the stage line) who want the territory kept undeveloped so they can loot and pillage as they've become used to doing. Standing in their way is the Black Whip, a masked avenger who (not surprisingly) seems quite reminiscent of grand old Zorro himself. If I had been allowed to contribute to the script, I might have thrown in a line about how the secret vigilante was using a bullwhip which had actually belonged to Zorro himself decades earlier, but no such luck.\n\nIn Crescent City, the local newspaper owner is Randolph Meredith, and with a clean-cut heroic sort of name like that, it's no surprise to find he's the Black Whip. While chasing the Anti-Statehood Gang, he takes a bullet and makes it back to his secret Whipcave under the ranch house. This is when his sister Barbara (played by serial queen Linda Stirling, not half bad any way you look at her) vows vengeance and takes over the role herself. Luckily, she can shoot a gun out of a man's hand across a room (she does drop quite a few dead in their tracks, though) , leap from a window onto a horse and gallop away with perfect poise.\n\nI can accept an awful lot of improbabilities in my move-watching but this really makes my suspension of disbelief ache. Linda Stirling in that silk outfit, at arm's length in bright Western daylight, just does not look like a man. Even though she doesn't speak, her eyes above the black bandana are delineated with enough mascara and tweaked eyebrows that even the densest gunslinger must have noticed. (\"You were in that room with him. Didn't you see anything that could identify him?\" the mastermind asks a thug.) Again, it wouldn't have taken much to include a scene showing Barbara sewing some padding into the suit to give her wide shoulders, a thicker waist and maybe blunt some of the curvy speed bumps under the shirt. Then they could have used a male stunt man even more blatantly.\n\nBarbara also takes over the newspaper and continues her late brother's push for statehood, with the help of a grizzled \"comic\" assistant who has crossed over to genuine alcoholism long ago. He's the sort of geezer who has no problems drinking a bottle of Listerine. Rather more useful in all the fistfights and shootouts is government agent Vic Gordon (played by George J. Lewis; I always like it when a actor usually known for villainous roles takes a crack at heroics, it's a nice change of pace).\n\nA few times, Gordon obligingly gets into the black outfit to impersonate the Whip so that Barbara can be seen elsewhere and keep her secret. I dunno. Maybe Randolph and Barbara could wear the same size clothes (they were brother and sister, after all) but Gordon sure looks taller and brawnier enough to make squeezing into that rig a problem. And if he's riding a horse and running around in her boots, his feet have got to hurt at the end of the day!\n\nSo we're in for the usual furniture smashing, flying tackles and roundhouse punches and seemingly certain deathtraps (ranging from avalanches to runaway stagecoaches to being exposed as a girl) for the next twelve chapters. The action is pretty good, this is a Republic serial from the mid-1940s after all, with Tom Steele and Dale Van Sickel but it lacks that certain creative spark that made the really great stunts stick in your memory. One thing to remember is that, if your friend is lying on the ground with someone about to slam a pitchfork through her supple form, simply throw a convenient saddle over her and she'll be quite safe.\n\nI notice that Barbara not only has enough skill with the whip (a difficult weapon to master properly in any case) to snap guns out of people's hands and turn doorknobs. she can lash away at someone and they are not sliced to bleeding shreds but only annoyed and irritated. Pretty good. She really has fun with that thing, tangling up outlaws' legs so they fall, turning out the lights at night. Judging from the movies, I don't know why mountain climbers and firefighters don't automatically carry a bullwhip with them. You just snap it once around any ledge or projection, climb and swing around, and then free it with a simple crack of the wrist. What could be more convenient?\n\nOne final note, it's always a pleasant jolt to come across grouchy old John Hamilton in a serial or B picture. I expect him to growl, \"We need statehood! Great Caesar's Ghost, can't you see that?\""
