The final network broadcast was June 2, 1959. Seventy-eight episodes were produced, and 4 hour-long specials were aired on the Walt Disney anthology series between October 30, 1960 and April 2, 1961.\n\nMajor characters\n\n*Don Diego de la Vega (portrayed by Guy Williams) is depicted as a former University student, newly recalled by his father from Spain to his home outside El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora Reina de los Ángeles sobre El Rio Porciuncula (later shortened as Los Angeles). Just before reaching California, Diego learns of the tyranny of Captain Monastario, and realizes that his father, Don Alejandro, summoned him to help fight this injustice. Although he won medals for his fencing back in Spain, Diego decides that his best course of action is to conceal his ability with a sword, and to affect the demeanor of a milquetoast intellectual rather than a decisive man of action. His alter ego, Zorro, operates primarily at night, taking the direct action that Diego cannot. This deception does not always sit well with Diego, especially as it affects his relationship with his disappointed father. In reality, Diego relies heavily on his wits, both with and without the mask on. Later in the series, Diego emerges as a respected figure in his own right, a clever thinker and loyal friend who just happens to be hopeless at swordplay. The character's name in Johnston McCulley's writing and previous adaptations was Diego Vega; the Disney version expands the name to Diego de la Vega, an innovation retained in some subsequent versions of the story. Diego's singing voice is supplied by Bill Lee of the Mellomen.\n\n*Don Alejandro de la Vega (portrayed by George J. Lewis) is a hot-tempered cattle baron (or \"ranchero\") with a strong sense of morality and fair play. His cattle and land holdings are said to be among the richest in California, which helps to make Don Alejandro an influential community leader. His impetuous nature often gets him into trouble, however, as he seeks to do battle himself, sometimes getting fooled and manipulated along the way. Don Alejandro eventually learns of his son's identity, and is strongly in favor of Zorro's work continuing. George J. Lewis starred in \"Zorro's Black Whip\" and had a minor role in \"Ghost of Zorro\" before starring as Don Alejandro in the Disney series.\n\n*Bernardo (portrayed by pantomimist Gene Sheldon) is Diego's manservant, confidant and co-conspirator, the only person at first to know Diego's secret. Unable to speak, Bernardo uses gestures to communicate. Bernardo pretends to be deaf as well as mute, the better to overhear the plans of Zorro's enemies. He also plays the fool, adopting clownish behavior so as to seem harmless. Although Bernardo is sometimes portrayed as a little silly even when no pretense is required, he is also a capable and invaluable disciple for Zorro and Diego, even wearing the mask himself occasionally when the need arises. The character had appeared in the original stories as both deaf and mute; giving him hearing in this iteration helped to make Bernardo more integral to the series as Zorro's spy. It also helped to advance the plot by giving Diego a partner with whom he could confide feelings, plans, and intended actions, while also communicating these things to the viewers.\n\n*Sgt. Miguel Demetrio Lopez Velasquez Garcia (portrayed by Henry Calvin) is fat, stupid, superstitious and overfond of drink, but also kind-hearted, brave and loyal. Sergeant Garcia believes that he must obey orders from his commanding officers, however cruel or unjust they may be. He tries to soften the blow with his friendly manner, often saying \"Please?\" as he issues an unpalatable order to a civilian. Although Garcia seldom departs from his sworn duty, he develops considerable respect for Zorro and later in the series is openly glad when Zorro escapes capture. Nevertheless, Garcia dreams of catching Zorro himself to collect the reward money, a dream that Diego encourages from time to time. He also has an excellent singing voice, and performs a number of songs over the course of the series, usually with mug in hand. Garcia replaces McCulley's Sergeant Gonzales from the original stories.\n\nOther recurring cast\n\n* Don Diamond as Corporal Reyes (Magistrado storyline onward) — Sergeant Garcia's assistant, introduced midway through season 1\n\n* Britt Lomond (an expert swordsman) as Captain Enrique Sanchez Monastario (season 1) — the evil but dashing Commandante was Zorro's first continuing foe, both on screen and at Disneyland (see \"Other appearances\" below)\n\n* Jan Arvan as Don Ignacio Torres (season 1) — a local don who is arrested by Monastario for speaking out\n\n* Henry Rowland as Count Kolinko (season 1) — Juan Greco and José Sebastián Varga's conspirator\n\n* Vinton Hayworth as Magistrate Carlos Galindo (season 1) — the local leader of a conspiracy to take over California\n\n*Jay Novello as Juan Greco (season 1) — José Sebastián Varga's conspirator\n\n*Charles Korvin as José Sebastián Varga (season 1) — the man Galindo was working for, self-styled \"the Eagle\"\n\n*Steve Stevens as Don Rodolfo (season 1) — one of the local dons, who vacillates on his commitment to help defend Los Angeles from the conspirators\n\n*Jolene Brand as Ana María Verdugo (season 2) — a love interest for Diego and Zorro, based in Monterey\n\n*Eduard Franz as Señor Gregorio Verdugo (season 2) — Ana Maria's father, leader of a group trying to finance bringing a supply ship to California\n\n*Richard Anderson as Ricardo del Amo (season 2) — Diego's old friend and rival who is also courting Ana Maria\n\n*Cesar Romero as Esteban de la Cruz (season 2) — Diego's uncle, an aging gigolo with a dishonest streak and a propensity for trouble\n\n*Annette Funicello as Anita Cabrillo (season 2) — a young woman who comes to Los Angeles to see her father - except that nobody has ever heard of him; Funicello was given the role as a birthday present\n\n*Everett Sloane as Andrés Felipe Basilio (season 2) — another of Zorro's foes, a greedy official who gathers treasure for Spain but seeks to keep it for himself\n\n*John Litel as Governor of California (season 2) — honest but petulant, the governor is the subject of two conspiracies against him, and Diego's house guest for a time\n\nPlot summary\n\nFor most of its brief run, \"Zorro\"'s episodes were part of continuing story arcs, each about thirteen episodes long. The first of these chronicles the arrival of Zorro / Diego and his battle of wits with the greedy and cruel local Commandante, Captain Monastario. After Monastario's final defeat, in the second storyline, Zorro must uncover and counter the machinations of the evil Magistrado Galindo, who is part of a plot to rule California. The third story arc concerns the leader of that conspiracy, the shadowy figure of the Eagle, revealed as vain and insecure José Sebastian Varga. Season one concludes with Varga's death.\n\nSeason two opens with Diego in Monterey, the colonial capital, where privately collected money to bring a supply ship to California is consistently diverted to a gang of bandits. Diego stays to investigate, both as himself and as Zorro, and becomes interested in Ana Maria Verdugo, the daughter of the man organizing the effort. Once Zorro defeats the thieves, he enters into a rivalry with his old friend Ricardo del Amo, a practical joker who is also interested in Ana Maria. Ana Maria in turn is in love with Zorro. While in Monterey, Zorro and Sergeant Garcia also get involved in a dispute between the peons and a repressive Lieutenant Governor. Diego is on the verge of giving up his mask to marry Ana Maria, but Don Alejandro talks him out of it. Zorro (and Diego) says goodbye to Ana Maria and returns to Los Angeles, where he gets involved in a series of shorter adventures. In one three episode story arc, guest starring Annette Funicello, Zorro must solve the mystery of Anita Campillo's father, a man who does not seem to exist. Other storylines late in the series involve Diego's ne'er-do-well uncle (Cesar Romero), a plot against the governor of California, an encounter with an American \"mountain man\" (Jeff York, reprising a role from \"The Saga of Andy Burnett\"), and outwitting a greedy emissary from Spain.\n\nQuotation\n\n\"I have no quarrel with history, but I am often appalled by the people who make it.\" - Diego, in the episode \"Zorro Fights His Father.\"\n\nOther appearances\n\nGuy Williams was introduced to the Disney audience as Zorro in a segment of the Disney anthology television series, \"The Fourth Anniversary Show\". [imdb title | id=0050318|title=Disneyland: The Fourth Anniversary Show] During this episode, which starred the Mouseketeers and featured upcoming shows, Moochie (Kevin Corcoran) repeatedly asks Walt Disney, \"What about Zorro?\" Finally Zorro appears, but not in the same shot with the Mouseketeers. Zorro explains who he is, and coyly answers the question of whether he's \"real.\""
