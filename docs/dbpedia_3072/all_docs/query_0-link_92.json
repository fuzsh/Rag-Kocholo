        "text": "Plot\n\nThe mysterious Don Del Oro (\"Lord of Gold\"), an idol of the Yaqui, emerges and attacks the gold trade of the Republic of Mexico, intent on becoming Emperor. A man named Francisco is put in charge of a fighting legion to combat the Yaqui tribe and protect the gold; he is attacked by men working for Don Del Oro. Zorro comes to his rescue, but it is too late for him. Francisco's partner recognizes Zorro as the hidalgo Don Diego Vega. Francisco asks Diego, as Zorro, to take over the fighting legion and defeat Don Del Oro.\n\nCast\n\nReed Hadley as Don Diego Vega and his alter ego Zorro.\n\nThough there were numerous Zorro serials, Hadley was the only actor to play the original Zorro in any of them.\n\nSheila Darcy as Volita\n\nWilliam Corson as Ramón\n\nLeander De Cordova as Governor Felipe\n\nEdmund Cobb as Manuel González\n\nJohn Merton as Comandante Manuel\n\nC. Montague Shaw as Chief Justice Pablo/ Don Del Oro\n\nBudd Buster as Juan\n\nCarleton Young as Benito Juárez\n\nBud Geary as Don Del Oro (body and voice)\n\nProduction\n\nZorro's Fighting Legion was budgeted at $137,826, although the final negative cost was $144,419 (a $6,593, or 4.8%, overspend). It was filmed between 15 September and 14 October 1939 under the working title Return of Zorro. The serial's production number was 898.\n\nThis film was shot in Simi Hills and Chatsworth, Los Angeles.\n\nStunts\n\nDale Van Sickel doubling Reed Hadley\n\nYakima Canutt\n\nJames Fawcett\n\nTed Mapes\n\nKen Terrell\n\nTheatrical\n\nZorro's Fighting Legion's official release date is 16 December 1939, although this is actually the date the sixth chapter was made available to film exchanges. The serial was re-released on 24 March 1958, making it the last serial released by Republic, which re-released serials for several years following the release of their final serial King of the Carnival in 1955.\n\nTelevision\n\nIn the early 1950s, Zorro's Fighting Legion was one of fourteen Republic serials edited into a television series. It was broadcast in six 26½-minute episodes.\n\nChapter titles\n\nThe Golden God (27 min 38s)\n\nThe Flaming \"Z\" (16 min 41s)\n\nDescending Doom (16 min 41s)\n\nThe Bridge of Peril (16 min 40s)\n\nThe Decoy (16 min 39s)\n\nZorro to the Rescue (16 min 40s)\n\nThe Fugitive (16 min 41s)\n\nFlowing Death (16 min 41s)\n\nThe Golden Arrow (16 min 39s) – Re-Cap Chapter\n\nMystery Wagon (16 min 40s)\n\nFace to Face (16 min 40s)\n\nUnmasked (16 min 41s)\n\nSource:\n\nDifferences from the Zorro canon\n\nThe story takes a few liberties with Zorro's official timeline: it takes place in Mexico instead of Alta California; Zorro wears a masquerade mask, rather than the traditional bandana; the characters Don Alejandro Vega (Don Diego's father) and Bernardo are absent; and Zorro's horse, Tornado, was changed to white (much like Kaiketsu Zorro). However, this story is presented as a further adventure of Zorro, a sequel to the traditional \"Mark of Zorro\" origin story originally starring Douglas Fairbanks and Noah Beery, Sr., which would be remade the year after Zorro's Fighting Legion with Tyrone Power and Basil Rathbone: Don Diego is said to be visiting from Los Angeles, and the serial intentionally did not remake the Zorro story; instead, it shows Zorro visiting Mexico because his help is needed there. The people of Mexico immediately recognize Zorro when he first appears, strongly suggesting that Zorro is a well-known hero.\n\nThe date given for the movie is 1824, which in and of itself establishes that it takes place well after Zorro's California adventures: Zorro opposed a corrupt Spanish Colonial government in his canon tales, and California ceased being a Spanish Colony in 1821."
