        "text": "LACCD, Long Beach, Cerritos, SMC, North Orange County, and Rio Hondo, to name just a few of our peers, have settled their negotiations for 2023-2024. Our contract expired December 31, 2022. We are now in mediation, with a state appointed mediator.\n\nUntil we have a contract, ECC faculty and our allies will be marching on campus, showing up to administrator office hours, and speaking before the Board of Trustees. And probably taking a strike authorization vote if the District tries to impose a subpar contract like the one faculty accepted in 2010.\n\nWhy are we and our allies marching?\n\nFrom 2010 to 2020, the ECC salary schedules, salaries, and health benefits have eroded compared to our peers and in terms of the actual cost of living (housing, food, insurance, transportation, utilities, etc.). Are our colleagues at other colleges doing better work than us? Is that what the District is telling us?\n\nIn the 2020 contract negotiations, the District’s negotiating team delayed negotiations for months, offering uncompetitive benefits packages, and repeatedly proposing zero COLAs during the life of the contract. At the time, the District’s team stated that the ECC budget, the state budget, and the economy all presented conditions where ECC might have to apply for high interest loans to keep the lights on because ECC’s income and reserves would not meet operating expenses. The Federation’s leadership team asked administrators for evidence to support these claims and received none.\n\nAt the height of the pandemic, the District’s negotiating team ground faculty down at the bargaining table month after month until our members, uncertain in the middle of a pandemic and working with an expired contract, accepted a contract that continued to put us on a trajectory to fall significantly farther behind our peers. Then, predictably, during the life of the 2020 contract, ECC’s unrestricted general fund grew from $34,231,353 (actuals at end of FY 2019-2020) to $56,597,101 (actuals at end of FY 2021-2022) while the proportion of ECC’s budget going to faculty salaries and benefits decreased. While we understand that some of the increase in reserves was derived from one-time money, the District’s predictions from the 2020 negotiating table were nonetheless wildly inaccurate. The faculty at ECC largely bore the burden of the District’s inaccurate budget predictions at the 2020 negotiating table in the form of significantly lower pay and uncompetitive benefits. Even after accounting for the hard-fought increases that the Federation achieved in the 2021 reopener, which still did not recover the state-funded COLA amount during that period, ECC faculty now find ourselves even farther behind their peers.\n\nIn the 2023 contract negotiations, we have repeatedly asked the District’s team how other districts manage their budgets in such a way that offering COLA (or more) to the salary schedules, competitive healthcare programs, and progressive mid- to late-career salaries is possible while maintaining a healthy reserve and functioning college. (By the way, the proposed 2023-2024 Cerritos budget will add to their reserve.) Generally, our experience has been that the District’s team recycles the same unsupported arguments from 2020 about an unknown but financially devastating future. The District’s team has not expressed what makes us different from other colleges and districts, just that it would be financially imprudent for ECC to be like them.\n\nTaking the District’s concerns at face value, in addition to substantially reducing our proposal to well below what many of our peers have already secured in ratified contracts, we are currently proposing a shorter contract duration, ending June 30, 2024, which would allow the District’s administration and faculty the benefit of more data to better understand our budget and funding. This approach also locks the District in for a lesser total financial obligation over the course of this shorter contract. Members of the District’s negotiating team have instead decided to repeat the 2020 approach at the table with the goal of grinding us down into accepting a contract that faculty are unable to ratify. This is doing irreparable harm to faculty morale, recruitment, and retention.\n\nOur members, tired of historic inflation gobbling up their household income, are tired of hearing how ECC can’t do what other districts do while simultaneously hearing reports of how we are hitting our enrollment goals and adding substantially to our reserves. Our members are tired of working without a new contract, and the improvements in compensation and working conditions that it would bring. Finally, we are extremely disappointed by the District’s refusal to discuss the Federation’s collaborative solutions at the table and further disheartened that the District pivoted to a final offer after presenting few, and in some cases singular, proposals on some items.\n\nUntil we have the contract we deserve from the District’s team, please lend a hand when you can, show up to actions, and speak your mind about how you feel about the current state of negotiations. Sign up here.\n\nLos Angeles Unified union members, both teachers and support workers, attend a rally last month at Los Angeles Historic State Park. United Teachers Los Angeles and the district announced a tentative agreement Tuesday. (Wally Skalij / Los Angeles Times)\n\nBY HOWARD BLUME STAFF WRITER APRIL 18, 2023 9:58 AM PT\n\nThe Los Angeles school district and the teachers union have reached a tentative agreement that provides a 21% wage increase over about three years, averting the potential of a second strike this school year.\n\nThe package also calls for additional pay increases in areas where it has been hard to recruit staff. These include an added $20,000 salary bump for nurses and $3,000 ongoing for school psychologists, psychiatric social workers, attendance counselors and other special services providers. All of these workers are represented by the United Teachers Los Angeles union.\n\nThe pact also includes an extra $2,500 ongoing increase for special education teachers and a $1,500 ongoing raise for early education teachers. There’s long been a shortage of permanent teachers for students with disabilities. The early education field is growing with the expansion of transitional kindergarten as an optional grade for all 4-year-olds.\n\n“This agreement with UTLA is a necessary step not only to make Los Angeles Unified the district of choice for families but also the district of choice for teachers and employees,” Supt. Alberto Carvalho said. “I am grateful that we reached an agreement with UTLA in a manner that reflects the dedicated work of our employees, provides a better academic experience for our students and raises the standards of compensation in Los Angeles and across the country.”\n\nThe union hailed the agreement as well but expressed a different tone with respect to the other side at the table.\n\n“While Carvalho and the district spent the past year ignoring and undermining educators, students, and parents, we were fighting for a fair contract that meets the urgent needs of today and builds a strong foundation for public schools,” a union release stated.\n\nThe union also credited its participation in a three-day joint strike in March that was led by Local 99 of Service Employees International Union. Local 99 represents the largest number of non-teaching employees, about 30,000 workers. The teachers union represents about 35,000.\n\n“We picketed, rallied, and walked the line in a historic solidarity strike to demand respect for all education workers,” the union stated. “Every win in this tentative agreement below is a direct result of our collective power in the streets.”\n\nIn its release, the union, like the district, led with the salary increase, but it also called attention to class reductions.\n\nThese reductions are small, about two students per class over the life of the contract, but continue ongoing efforts to make classes smaller. The deal prioritizes the district’s 100 most “fragile” schools for the reductions, using a designation based on low student achievement and other factors.\n\nCaseloads for professionals such as counselors will also be reduced, but they remain large. The maximum caseload for a secondary school academic counselor would be lowered from 750 to 700.\n\nThe agreement must be ratified by the union membership and approved by the Board of Education.\n\nThere seems little doubt that the school board will favor it, as indicated by board President Jackie Goldberg.\n\n“I am thrilled Los Angeles Unified and UTLA have reached an agreement that fairly compensates our incredible educators,” Goldberg said in the district release. “The negotiation process is laborious but critical to ensure our contracts address the needs of our employees. I am thankful to everyone who sat at the table and came to this agreement.”\n\nLocal 99 reached a tentative agreement March 24 that was subsequently ratified by its members.\n\nSource: https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-04-18/l-a-teachers-win-21-wage-increase-in-new-lausd-contract\n\nBY HOWARD BLUME, STAFF WRITER DEC. 6, 2022 5 AM PT\n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-12-06/l-a-teachers-union-is-demanding-a-20-raise-and-rallies-to-step-up-contract-talks\n\nThe Los Angeles teachers union is pressing its demands for a 20% raise over two years, smaller class sizes and a steep reduction in standardized testing — the latest stress test for the nation’s second-largest school district and Supt. Alberto Carvalho as the system struggles to address students’ deep learning setbacks and mental health needs in the wake of the pandemic.\n\nFor United Teachers Los Angeles — which staged three simultaneous rallies Monday across the vast school system — its contract platform speaks to the intense pressures that members say are pummeling their profession, leading to dire teacher shortages in California and throughout the nation. Ongoing economic uncertainties and the high costs of living and housing in Los Angeles have intensified their focus on contract talks as teachers worry about career sustainability and increasing workloads.\n\n“When you can’t even afford to live when you work, we got a problem y’all,” UTLA President Cecily Myart-Cruz said in impassioned remarks that closed the rally outside district headquarters just west of downtown. “This district has had seven whole months to address the educator shortage and to make sure that every student has a classroom teacher, every student has a school nurse, every student has a counselor and a librarian and mental health support.”\n\nSpeakers at the rally included newly elected school board member Rocio Rivas, who benefited from a multimillion-dollar independent campaign on her behalf from the teachers union.\n\nWhile Myart-Cruz sought to fire up her rank-and-file, school district officials sought to tamp things down.\n\n“Los Angeles Unified continues to meet with our labor partners regularly,” according to a statement the district issued in the afternoon. “We respect and acknowledge the dedication of our employees and the need to compensate them fairly in this current economic environment. We remain dedicated to avoiding protracted negotiations to keep the focus on our students and student achievement.”\n\nAt the rallies, participants focused on record multibillion-dollar reserves, with the message that if teachers and other employees can’t be rewarded and helped now, then when would it ever be possible?\n\nCarvalho, in turn, has focused attention on potential difficulties ahead. Financial forecasters, including the state legislative analyst, warn of an economic downturn just as one-time COVID-19 relief aid is winding down. A raise that is affordable in 2022 must still be paid for three years from now — when money is likely to be tighter, and when steadily declining student enrollment could create more financial pressures.\n\nThe L.A. Unified labor actions come as a massive strike among UC academic workers enters its fourth week, with 48,000 teaching assistants, tutors, graduate student researchers and post-doctoral scholars also decrying the high cost of California housing in their demand for a significant pay increase, along with more support for child care, healthcare and transportation. The workers have rallied on campuses throughout the state for several weeks and held sit-ins on Monday, with sides far apart on money.\n\nA common theme for both unions has been the high cost of living in the region, which teachers brought up repeatedly at the downtown union rally.\n\n“As someone who’s new to L.A., teachers do not make enough money to live in the city at all,” said Nekhoe Hogan, a third-year teacher at Manual Arts High School, south of downtown. “The public needs to recognize that teachers are asking for basic necessities, and then to have working conditions be normal — not too many kids in the classroom, not too many administrative things to take care of that prevents them from actually doing their job just teaching kids.”\n\nOther factors also are making the job challenging, including working with students who are behind academically and have greater emotional needs because of pandemic hardships.\n\n“There are many things that they should know currently that they don’t know,” Hogan said. “And so I feel a sort of responsibility to make up two years of education within a semester essentially — and that’s impossible.”\n\nThe rallies included parent supporters. Some other parent leaders, who did not attend, are concerned about labor strife leading to more potential learning disruptions. The previous contract settlement was reached only after a one-week strike in January 2019.\n\nFamilies “are tired of the politics and endless chaos,” said Christie Pesicka, a spokesperson for a parents group that has been critical of the teachers union. “Enrollment is plummeting. By the time the bickering settles, there may not be enough students left for LAUSD to remain solvent.”\n\nNegotiations with United Teachers Los Angeles are relatively distinct. Beyond seeking a pay increase, the union is pushing for changes in the way students are schooled in their “Beyond Recovery” platform, which aims to “ensure our neighborhood public schools meet the unique needs of students, families, and educators in each community.”\n\nSaying that standardized assessments take valuable time from learning, the union is calling for elimination or dramatic reduction of such tests when they are not required by the state or federal government.\n\nCarvalho has acknowledged that such assessments are not always well organized or consistent from one region of the district to another, but has defended their intent. The tests are used as fundamental measures to guide instruction across the system, especially under the data-oriented Carvalho.\n\nSome of what the union frames as demands are in line with district goals, such as expanded access to dual-language programs and more ethnic studies classes. Like the union, the district supports putting a full-time nurse in every school, but hasn’t been able to hire them in a competitive job market.\n\nThe union wants a class-size reduction of four students everywhere over the next two years. The district wants to target reductions to where it’s needed most — based on academic performance and the percentage of low-income families.\n\nSome critics view many union proposals off topic or the prerogative of management. But even with the bread-and-butter agenda, UTLA is known for pushing hard compared with teacher unions elsewhere — and such is the case with the 20% wage proposal.\n\nThe district is so far offering 8% according to bargaining updates that the union posts online.\n\nUTLA leaders take pride in having a curricular and social agenda — the union’s platform calls for installing solar panels and buying electric buses.\n\nThe union package also calls for a freeze on school closures — which are increasingly hard to avoid as enrollment shrinks — and an end to “the over-policing and criminalization of students in schools.”\n\nThe platform does not explicitly call for the end of school police, although union leadership supports its elimination. A union proposal submitted earlier this year sought to “end all requirements for the engagement of police except where mandated by federal, state or local law requiring the involvement of police.”\n\nThe union bargaining platform also calls for the district to “push for” federal “housing vouchers to support LAUSD families” and to “convert vacant LAUSD property into housing for low-income families” — although it’s challenging to see how these elements would be enforced through a teachers contract.\n\nOther L.A. Unified bargaining units have typically benefited from UTLA’s hard line — as their raises and benefits have come to mirror those fought for by UTLA. Another union, however, is independently assertive, Local 99 of Service Employees International Union, which represents the largest number of nonteaching employees, including bus drivers, teacher aides, custodians and cafeteria workers.\n\nLocal 99 members include some of the lowest wage earners in the school system — earning $25,000 a year on average for work that is frequently part time. They’ve scheduled their own rally for next week.\n\nIn the big picture, 2022 has been a year of relative labor calm for K-12 education in California.\n\n“Record funding — so many districts are settling early and working collaboratively with employees to improve programs, et cetera,” said Frank Wells, a regional spokesman for the California Teachers Assn. “Others for whatever reason are taking an unnecessarily hard-line approach.”\n\nIn particular, Wells was talking about Covina-Valley Unified, where teachers came within hours of going on strike last week. That strike was averted with a tentative agreement. In Glendale, the teachers union and school district are in mediation.\n\nMany of us at El Camino College have attended the University of California. Our friends and family have gone there. Thousands of our students have transferred there.\n\nCurrently, the UC Office of the President is engaged in unfair bargaining, refusing to make good faith proposals at the bargaining table in the area of salary and compensation. We encourage you to write UC chancellors in support of our colleagues across the state and lend a hand to those on strike.

Since his daughter was born in May with complications, he said, he and his wife have struggled to pay for the child care she needs.\n\nTafari, 32, is one of the organizers behind what has been billed as the largest work stoppage at any academic institution. And as the strike entered its fourth day Thursday, halting research and prompting widespread class cancellations across the UC system’s 10 campuses, the workers said their action has brought to light their financial hardships and difficult working conditions.\n\n“Because my daughter was born with complications, we’ve been on seizure watch,” Tafari said. “We have been very lucky because my mother-in-law has been taking over as the primary caregiver. We pay her around $1,500 a month, depending on what’s going on. But if we didn’t have a family member who was willing and able, we’d be paying about $2,500 a month.”\n\nTafari earns about $2,500 a month as a teaching assistant and said he has taken other jobs to supplement the income and cover the costs of raising his daughter. In negotiations, the university has proposed covering $2,500 a year in child-care costs for postdoctoral scholars, but Tafari said that isn’t enough.\n\nOn Thursday, the union representing academic workers said the two sides had made progress on issues of parking and transit, job security provisions and paid time off. But on compensation, a major sticking point, the UC’s slight increase fell short of union demands.\n\nThe union said the new offer amounted to raises of about $132 a month for most student researchers, which would leave many workers paying 56% of their income on rent. The proposal also failed to include in the contract any supplemental compensation, which many graduate workers would receive in addition to base salaries.\n\n“We still think this is far from sufficient,” said Rafael Jaime, president of United Auto Workers Local 2865, which represents 19,000 of the striking workers.\n\nRyan King, a spokesperson for UC, pointed out that the university’s latest proposal eliminates the two lowest salary steps for graduate researchers, which would amount to significant increases for those workers, closer to 20%, calling it a “generous proposal.” But he did say the average increase would be around 8% for most graduate student researchers.\n\nOn Wednesday, UC Provost Michael Brown told university leaders in a letter that the union’s pay and housing demands would be an “overwhelming” financial hit that could reach several hundred million dollars a year.\n\nPushing back, the union said the four UAW bargaining units representing striking workers are asking for a package that would amount to 4.5% of UC’s total budget.\n\n“That’s a fair price to pay for world-class teaching and research,” the union said in an email.\n\nThough UC officials called for a third-party mediator Monday, Jaime said he was glad the university has continued to bargain without one.\n\nJaime accused UC of dragging its feet, saying the university bargained Wednesday and Thursday with only one of the four striking units: that representing graduate student researchers.\n\n“It’s very inefficient,” Jaime said. “We want to be bargaining around the clock.”\n\nMeanwhile, as polls show U.S. support for labor unions at its highest point in nearly 60 years amid a wave of high-profile campaigns at companies such as Starbucks and Amazon, backing for the UC strike has grown among some students, faculty and workers at other unions.\n\nFaculty members said they’ve held “teach-ins” about the strike or brought their classes down to the picket line, and some professors have canceled classes altogether.\n\nThough lecturers in the UC system have a clause in their contract against canceling their classes in “sympathy strikes,” Katie Rodger, president of the UC-AFT, said the union that represents about 6,000 UC lecturers and librarians is encouraging members to support striking workers by joining the picket lines when not carrying out assigned duties.\n\nUndergraduate support for the strikers has surpassed 16,000 signatures, and the union has received almost 50 letters of support from faculty and departments across the 10 campuses.\n\nAmong those departments is the ethnic studies department at UC San Diego, where assistant professor Roy Pérez, said he teaches both undergraduate and graduate classes, including one with more than 400 students that usually has seven teaching assistants.\n\n“UCSD could not meet the educational needs of so many students without the work of TAs,” Pérez said. “TAs’ working conditions should be a top financial investment if the UC system wants to sustain the quality of education it promises while pursuing record-breaking enrollment numbers.”\n\nNick Callen, a fourth-year undergrad at UC San Diego, said two of his classes have been indefinitely canceled as the strike continues. One of his professors has gone on with business as usual, not mentioning the strike or changing classes.\n\n“I am a little concerned just because it’s close to the end of the quarter,” Callen said of his disrupted classes. “It’s like we’re on hold until we hear something back from the strike. … It is really stressful, but I’m glad that they’re doing it.”\n\nAmina Hearns, a fourth-year UC Riverside student, tutor represented by the UAW and the chair of the UC Student Assn., said there’s a divide between undergraduates in humanities, arts and social sciences who support the strike and students in math and science who tend to be less supportive. She said the divide can be attributed to misinformation from the administration and some of their professors.\n\n“They try forcing this grad students versus undergraduate students,” she said. “Like ‘Look, they’re not striking and not grading your work and that’s why you’re behind.’ And that’s not true at all. The fact that they’re not reading your work is because they’re not getting the demands that they need.”\n\nTeamsters, the union representing drivers and other workers, notified UPS drivers in southern and northern California that they have the right to honor the picket line and not deliver packages to campuses during the strike.\n\nAt UC Berkeley, strikers spoke Wednesday morning with workers from the International Union of Operating Engineers, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the Laborers’ International Union of North America. The union members agreed not to work at the construction site in solidarity with the strike.\n\nThe workers are demanding a base salary of $54,000 for all graduate student workers, child-care subsidies, enhanced healthcare for dependents, longer family leave, public transit passes and lower tuition costs for international scholars. The union said the workers earn an average current pay of about $24,000 a year.\n\nUC has offered salary scale increases of 7% in the first year and 3% in each subsequent year for teaching assistants and tutors, and increases for postdoctoral scholars of 8% the first year, 5% the second year and 3% in subsequent years. UC said pay increases would amount to up to 17%, depending on the union.\n\nBetween his four-year fellowship and a guaranteed job doing medical education research for the school, Tafari is able to cover the tuition and fees for his program, but because his fellowship is over in June, he said he’ll have to pay about $40,000 a year to finish his degree.\n\n“If you’re undocumented, if you’re poor and an international student, if you don’t come from generational wealth, the odds of you being able to get a graduate degree is slim to none,” he said. That “really makes it so that we have fewer of the best and brightest here, doing the quality research that can transform our society to something that we all can be proud of.”\n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-11-17/uc-strike-little-bargaining-progress-but-support-for-workers-grows\n\nSeptember 5, 2022 update\n\nBecause of the mobilization of faculty, family, friends, and allies across the state (see original story and ask below), the California legislature allocated $200 million for PT health care benefits. This historic victory means that community college districts can be reimbursed from this $200 million fund to provide PT health care benefits to their employees, but districts are not obligated to do so.\n\nThat means that across the state, local unions need to negotiate with their employers to ensure these funds are used on our campuses. Such a deal seems like a no-brainer. However, in many districts administrators will resist using this money to provide a basic human right.\n\nAt El Camino College, the Federation will be negotiating this new benefit for PT faculty and will need your support and help. To get involved in the campaign, please contact the chair of our PT committee, Laila Dellapasqua at vespa250cc@gmail.com\n\nBelow is the original story published February 23, 2022.\n\nFar too many part-time faculty in California do not have access to affordable quality healthcare. The lack of healthcare access for many part-timers, a reality made all the more pernicious and conspicuous during a pandemic, is symptomatic of the far-reaching exploitation of contingent faculty. A majority of part-time faculty across California have deemed the creation of a healthcare pool important.1\n\nIn response, CFT launched a state-wide campaign in October 2021 to secure healthcare funding for part-time faculty. This campaign has already achieved a foundational win. In January 2022, Governor Newsom allocated $200 million for part-time healthcare to the state budget. This is significant as it represents an increase of almost 400 times the existing funding for part-time healthcare!2\n\nBut, we have more work to do. We need guarantees that this funding will remain in the state budget. Part-time faculty deserve quality healthcare that is affordable, and we must continue the work for a more equitable higher education system. We are asking our colleagues to please support this effort in the following ways:\n\nSend a letter to the state legislature to support part-time healthcare now!\n\nPT faculty across the state will be testifying before state legislators on April 5th. Please reach out if you are interested in providing testimony: email erussell@elcamino.edu or sign up directly at https://www.cft.org/pt-hearings-april-5. CFT will provide speaker training.\n\nAdditionally, CFT recently launched a survey to better understand the healthcare needs of PT faculty. We encourage all current PT faculty to complete this important survey: https://www.cft.org/pt-survey. The survey will take about 15 minutes and the results will provide critical data that will strengthen our advocacy efforts.\n\n1In a 2020 survey, 73% of CFT respondents thought the creation of a healthcare pool was important or very important for part-time faculty. https://www.cft.org/article/cft-launches-campaign-secure-healthcare-part-time-faculty\n\n2You can read more about the campaign here: https://www.cft.org/article/member-action-leads-governor-pledge-200-million-toward-part-time-faculty-healthcare"
