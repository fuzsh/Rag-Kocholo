        "text": "Madrid, El Escorial and Aranjuez\n\nThis impressive example of Spanish heritage is located in the Region of Madrid. One of the Spanish capital's most representative spaces is the historical complex of the Royal Palace in Madrid, built in the 18th century under the mandate of King Felipe V and the location for official ceremonies organised by the current King of Spain. At its feet are the gardens of Campo del Moro, a green oasis of more than 20 hectares and with free access all year round. In front of the palace, on one side of Plaza de Oriente, is the Royal Monastery of La Encarnación and, a short distance from Plaza de Ópera, the Royal Monastery of the Descalzas Reales; these architectural icons date back to the Spanish Habsburg dynasty of the 16th and 17th centuries.One of the most outstanding works of royal architect Juan Gómez de Mora is the Royal Monastery of Santa Isabel and another of the jewels in Madrid 's crown is, without a doubt, the Hermitage of San Antonio de la Florida, adorned with frescoes by Francisco de Goya and where the remains of this famous painter were laid to rest. The Pantheon of Spain, next to the Royal Basilica of Atocha, is the final resting place of other illustrious Spaniards such as José Canalejas, Sagasta and Cánovas del Castillo.\n\nRoyal Palace in Madrid\n\nThe Royal Palace of El Pardo and the El Pardo Forest, considered the most important Mediterranean forest in the region and spanning almost 16,000 hectares, also form part of the network of Royal Sites. The palace, built by order of Henry IV, renovated during the time of Emperor Charles V and expanded by Charles III, houses tapestries by Goya and Bayeu and is currently used as the residence of foreign heads of state visiting Spain.Just 50 kilometers from Madrid, in the Sierra de Guadarrama, is the Royal Monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial. As a testament to Herrerian architecture, constructed under the watch of Juan de Herrera, it was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO for capturing the ideological and cultural aspirations of the Spanish Golden Age. The La Herrería Forest is part of this imposing Royal Site and is included in the Natura 2000 Network for its incalculable landscape value and its faunal diversity.Another location declared a UNESCO World Heritage site is the Cultural Landscape of Aranjuez, home to the Royal Palace, the quintessential country residence of Spanish monarchs. It consists of fascinating places such as the Porcelain Cabinet, the Hall of Mirrors or the Prince's Gardens, with the Casa del Labrador and the Museum of Royal Feluccas, which houses a spectacular collection of pleasure boats. The Convent of San Pascual stands in the grounds of the Royal Site of Aranjuez; its church, which is open to the public, is presided over by a painting by Antonio Rafael Mengs.\n\nRoyal Palace in Aranjuez\n\nSegovia, Burgos and Valladolid\n\nThe region of Castile and Leon boasts three essential destinations for continuing to explore Spain's Royal Sites. In the province of Segovia, you'll find the La Granja de San Ildefonso Royal Palace. It was the favorite palace, summer residence and retreat of Philip V. In addition, its Versailles-style gardens and fountains have splendid sculptural groups of Neptune, Apollo and Andromeda, among others. Just nine kilometers from the city of Segovia, is the Royal Palace of Riofrío, a lesser known site surrounded by a large forest of the same name that constitutes a natural space of extraordinary ecological value.A stop on the Camino de Santiago, Huelgas del Rey, in Burgos, is home to the Monastery of Santa María la Real de las Huelgas, founded in 1187; the Museum of Medieval Fabrics is one of its main attractions.The province of Valladolid, in turn, on the banks of the River Duero, is home to the impressive Royal Monastery of Santa Clara de Tordesillas, mixing Romanesque and Gothic architecture, in addition to containing elements of Mudejar art inherited from Andalusian culture.\n\nLa Granja de San Ildefonso Royal Palace\n\nOther Real Sites to visit\n\nThe remaining Royal Sites are spread across four other Spanish regions: Extremadura, Andalusia, Castile la Mancha and the Balearic Islands. The Monastery of San Jerónimo de Yuste, in the province of Cáceres, is where Emperor Charles V of Germany and I of Spain spent his final days, on his final journey before passing away. Nestled in a privileged environment, a visit to the monastery includes the Cuarto Real, the church and the Gothic and Renaissance cloisters to which it plays host. The Cuarto Alto is one of the small palaces that were part of the Real Alcázar of Seville. This Royal Site located in the capital of Andalusia combines Nasrid, Toledo, Caliphate and Almohad architecture. It is currently the official residence of the King and Queen of Spain when they visit Seville.\n\nReal Alcázar Palace of Seville\n\nThe capital of Castile-La Mancha, Toledo, is home to the Real Colegio de Doncellas Nobles, created to accommodate and educate young girls with limited resources. It consists of a beautiful cloister and a gallery towards the garden, the work of the 18th century Spanish architect Ventura Rodríguez, and a 16th century bas-relief of Vázquez the Elder in his church.Finally, the Royal Palace of La Almudaina, dating back to the 14th century, showcases the consecutive artistic styles witnessed on the island of Mallorca. Its very name pays testament to this, translating as citadel or walled enclosure in Arabic. The summer residence of Spain's current royal couple, La Almudaina preserves the structures of the Alcázar and its Arab baths. The rooms worth particular mention are the King's chapel, the San Jaime room, or its Gothic hall.\n\nLa Almudaina Royal Palace"
