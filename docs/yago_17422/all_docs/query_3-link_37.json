        "text": "REVIEW FOR STANDARD DF SINCE I DON’T SEE THAT LISTED. I’m going to be the odd man out and not give all stars. I’m borderline 2/3 to be honest. I don’t even write reviews but i’m gonna take the time for this one so others know based on how much this bag shows up on da interwebs. I’ll preface my review with this is only used as a daily work bag when home, and my primary travel work pack to carry airplane stuff, 2 laptops and a travel monitor, ipad and cables, and jacket and stuff to my work meetings. I’m satisfied’ish but still torn about whether I should’ve just went with a new larger version of my well known outdoor company ‘PGBH’ bag that i’ve had for years and been pretty happy with. I’m not loving it, but not not liking it enough where i sent it back. I debated it a lot for a couple weeks before using it to travel because without traveling to validate my opinions, i’d never know. So I used it and…My big dislikes FIRST…i very very dislike the side pockets and the poorly designed top elastic band. It fails horribly at holding things in that to me it should. You better hope you fill it up with non slippery stuff or pray you don’t move it and lose it. Design should be updated to basically copy the PGBH bag which tightens that band at the top to help hold things in. Years of use never had the issue w/ my PGBH bag; this bag I traveled twice; not liked that both times. i have to keep checking that my things are still in the side pockets cause that retainer strap just ain’t effective. On the front of the bag though the stretch material is great..but that has a zipper. NEXT gripe is zippers. I’m not liking much, almost at all, how easy the main compartment zipper opens. bothers me a lot for a bag that costs over 200. The zippers should be harder to open on my main compartment. even the brain pocket is harder to open. Another design upgrade to consider; maybe if the zippers were a more water resistant model they’d be harder to open. LAST is the front main compartment flap. i love the inside pockets but would like to see the design have the U shaped compartment zipper be a little more biased toward the outer edges…meaning widen the U zipper a liiiiiiiiitle more and I think the flap would be a little more stable and easier to get compartment things in. That would also give those inside pockets a little wider opening. MAYBE…It’s so light that you could slightly push out dimensions not noticeably sacrificing weight and get the interior a liter or so more space, pushing overall to 26+’ish. OK what saved it from 2 stars…the brain pocket is good, not great. Maybe a little big and could’ve been smaller to give more interior room, but it works well and the pull zip works well. It sits high though and when you’re using the bag flat, if that’s open and you don’t use an organizer you have to watch for things falling out. Maybe design of the top edge could extend a little more to the inside of the brain opening to stop things from falling out. The laptop sleeve is awesome. I can get a MBP 14 and HP 14 in there with little issue and traveling on plane no issues with those on the floor because the bottom has enough padding. Material is good and stitching good. Front pocket is good and shock cord is good. Pockets on inside of U flap good. I’m even cool with the straps even though they’re a little cardboard’y’ish something feeling. With all my stuff and laptops no issue with rubbing/pain/etc., so i’m cool with those. Compression on inside aren’t super effective at holding laptops in place, but do well with compression cubes. Might be more effective to install those top/bottom instead of side/side. That said, it’s US made, they do repairs, it seems very durable but light, has great function for its size, i can attest it does hold a lot for its size, laptop area feels safe, not uncomfortable and sits high and comfy, and overall good bag. If my gripes are of less concern to you, this bag is 5 stars for sure. For me as a work/travel work bag, it checks a lotta boxes more than most at price, but i’m not totally sold on its dual function design. It’s very close though and it’ll be hard for you to find this function, cost, comfort, US made/repaired, weight combo. My honest input to help drive the next design update.\n\nI did a ton of research and tried a ton of packs, and the ULTRA Dragonfly won out. I work between an urban office and an extremely wet, harsh environment, and I wanted something that could handle both. I also wanted a pack that could fit my 16″ MacBook Pro (with a thick protective shell) as well as my 12.5″-wide Peak Design Camera Cube, serve as a personal item on planes, and be comfortable enough for long hikes hauling 25+ pounds. The Dragonfly was the unicorn that did it all–at a super light weight. It also looks great; I got the White Lightning version, which is gorgeous. Though ULA’s official specs suggest the pack shouldn’t fit the items I put in it, it does. Its main compartment is more spacious than packs listed as much larger, as is its external laptop compartment. Some of the comfort depends on your frame. For me, the unique S-shaped straps fit like a glove, making the pack more comfortable than ones with much plusher harnesses. Finally, these packs are crafted by hand in Utah, which means each one is well made and slightly unique, which I appreciate. Oh yeah: ULA customer service is great. I can’t believe they responded quickly and kindly to all my crazy questions, but they did. One big caveat: if you want a pack with tons of internal organization, the Dragonfly might not be for you, as it’s fairly minimalist. But for me, the ULTRA Dragonfly definitely deserves five stars. I hope other folks enjoy it as much as I do."
