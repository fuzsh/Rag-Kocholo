        "text": "A couple of years ago my younger daughter had plans to hike the Camino de Santiago in Spain. She is fluent in Spanish, and thought it might make a nice adventure. Since I lived in Spain for five years (long before she was born...but I'm still fluent in Spanish) and also love hiking, I subtly (well, maybe not that subtly) suggested I would be happy to join her. But due to a number of circumstances, her plans changed and she never made the trip.\n\n​\n\nBut then she dropped me a note and laid out some dates. And after a bit of back and forth to make sure it worked for both of us, we settled on a timeframe and a route. We'll be doing the Camino Primitivo--the original route hiked by Spanish King Alfonso II when he made the first pilgrimage to visit the tomb of St. James, Santiago, back in the 9th century. It is considerably less traveled now than the more popular Camino Frances over the Pyrenees.\n\nThat's Alfonso himself, left.\n\n​\n\nIt starts in the ancient town of Oviedo (some start it on the coast, but we took it from Oviedo) and hikes over mountains and through small towns until we join the Camino Frances and its thousands of pilgrims in Melide.\n\nAt that point, the last 30 miles or so, it's a different experience!\n\nThe total miles is something over 200 and should take around two weeks, if all goes according to plan.\n\nHere's a link to more background on the Camino Primitivo: https://www.csj.org.uk/camino-primitivo#:~:text=History%3A%20The%20Primitivo%20is%20believed,had%20been%20discovered%20in%20Compostela.\n\nBecause this is a pilgrimage route, we stayed in hotels and hostels, rather than camping out. For an experienced backpacker, that makes a big difference--no tent or ground cloth to lug along. And we ate in cafes and bought food along the way, so we didn't need the stove or the cook kit, either, although I took along a simple set of bamboo silverware in case we wanted to buy food and eat it along the way. And no water filter\n\nOf course I took rain gear, and a down vest, along with a couple of shirts and two pairs of hiking pants. Add in some socks, undies, and pjs, and that pretty much summarizes the clothing end of things. We each tool a very light (40 degree F.) sleeping bag, just in case we need it in one of the hostels. Some toiletries and a very basic first aid kit were in my pack, along with a couple of headlamps. mosquito headnets, buffs, bandanas, platyupus bottles, sewing kit, extra shoelaces, and other accoutrements of the backpacking life--I would just hate it if we needed one of these and I'd left it at home. They weighed about a pound, total.\n\nI took a pair of camp shoes (Crocs) to give my feet a rest in the evenings, and my phone and charger so I could post these updates. And please don't mention this to the TSA, but I took along a folding hiking pole to take some of the strain off my knee on the downhills.\n\nThe whole pack weighed in under fifteen pounds at home. For a more than two week backpacking trip, that seems like luxury.\n\n​\n\nAnd for image's sake, we hung a scallop shell on our packs, to correctly identify ourselves as pilgrims. As a backpacker, I was hoping that I could find multiple uses for it!\n\n​\n\nABOUT OVIEDO\n\n​\n\nOviedo is an ancient city, one time capital of the Kingdom of Asturias. The city has a lovely \"casco antiguo,\" the oldest part of town, plus a nice archeological museum, and a nice fine arts museum. It's quite walkable, at least in the center, and both of the museums are free!\n\n​\n\nIt's also famous for heavy stews and cider(not wine--the culture here runs to bagpipes, wooden shoes, and cider!), so we often had limited options for food, since Estelle is a vegetarian. But we liked our short time here...\n\n​\n\nFor the full logs of all the photos from our trip: https://photos.app.goo.gl/sJFfA4781AJBqs3K6\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nMore thoughts on the Camino Primitivo\n\nOther thoughts--Things changed once we got on the Camino Frances. Now other hikers were shipping big suitcases ahead, and just hiking with little day packs. Almost nobody did this on the Primitivo. And they talked--loudly to each other, on the phone. They listened to music on boom boxes. And the electric bike guys were the worst, speeding by, yelling at times. Complete jerks. A far cry from the fifteen people a day quietly walking near us on the Primitivo.\n\n​\n\nIf we got up early enough to start walking while it was just barely getting ligh, we still had a few miles of peaceful progress, even on the Camino Frances.\n\nAnd I did attend a pilgrim's mass on my last night in Santiago, but they did not fly the botafumeiro {the huge censer) but I am not sure why.\n\nWe also noted that the total climbing on our route is more than 27,000 feet, so almost an \"Everest\" for those who such silly things\n\nFood: Asturias was stews and meat, which limited our choices for Estelle, so we did lots of tortilla espanola and cheese. We got a little tired of that. The orange juice, on the other hand, was consistently excellent and fresh squeezed. Our friend Irene would point out that the oranges must be from Valencia.\n\nWe did order a lot of ensalada mixta -- a Spanish version of salade nicoise, that was usually available. Many hostels had vegetarian options, some of which were quite good. But Galicia had seafood, and we loved it. All kinds, from shellfish (scallops, mussels, calamari, etc.) to bacalao, hake, and cod...and always octopus. What a luxury.\n\nEstelle -- I could not have asked for a better hiking partner: cheerful, strong, and always willing to help. She carried a heavier pack (she took most of the food) and made all the pension reservations flawlessly. And we took care of each other, reminding ourselves to eat, drink, and use my hiking pole on the descents! She was enthusiastic about so many things, she added joy to so many experiences. A true joy to be with her every day on the trail. Truly the best part of my Camino.\n\n​"
