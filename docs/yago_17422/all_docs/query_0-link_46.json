        "text": "This morning I took a bus from Santiago to Finisterre. I do plan to one day walk this Camino, but I’ve had my fill of walking for this trip. The three hour bus ride through the hills, along the coast, and past fishing villages was lovely.\n\nMike from New Zealand had just completed the Portuguese Coastal Camino with his grandkids from Australia. He said this may be his last long walk so he wanted to share it with the family. They were about to board the bus to Finisterre.\n\nFisterre is the town at the end of the road, a destination for tourists and pilgrims with plenty of hotels, albergues, and restaurants. Finisterre is the point you walk to past the town, the fabled “End of the World”. The area reminded me of Forillon National Parc in Gapse, Quebec, and Twillingate in Newfoundland, Canada.\n\nJuan\n\nJuan lives in Fisterre, Spain and made the last official stamp of my Caminos with wax. He and the rest of the staff at Antico Cafe Bar Tito Dal 1910 have all completed Caminos. The bar is decorated with Camino memorabilia and a mural of the French route from France to Finisterre. They also serve excellent tiramisu.\n\nThe bus took me back to Santiago and I stayed one last night at the Last Stamp Albergue. The next day I was going to take a bus to Porto, Portugal for three nights, where I would meet friends from home. From there I would take a bus to Lisbon, spend two more days, and fly home.\n\nI walked 16.7 km this day.\n\nPolish Pilgrims\n\nWhile in Porto on April 19, 2023, I met four confused Polish Pilgrims trying to get their bearings in the old city. I introduced myself as a fellow pilgrim and showed them to their hotel and their Camino starting point, the cathedral. I wished them Bom Camino. As my adventure was ending, theirs was just beginning."
