        "text": "❗Yacht Brokers❗ Are you tired of dealing with low quality leads who waste your time? It's not your fault. You see, most yacht brokers are pretty idle when it comes to their acquisition process. They rely on their referrals, brokerage leads, dock walking, connections, etc… But that stuff only gets you so far since that's what everybody else does. After, speaking to more than 75 yacht brokers we developed a solution for lead quality, the same system helped us get a $2.2mil listing for one of our clients in just 10 days. Iff you want to fill your pipeline with qualified leads comment \"quality\" down below and follow my page here -> https://lnkd.in/djMUkJ9A\n\nBridge Commercial is one of the best industrial real estate brokerages in the southeast, if not the country.
