        "text": "You can take a shower and sleep in a bed every day for less than $10/day - it's crowded here, so I advise you to book your accomodation in advance.\n\nYou don't need to carry any food because you'll have access to cooked restaurant meals every few hours.\n\nYou don't even need to carry water! You cross piped water about every 45 minutes. You won't need to purify it either.\n\nNo need to carry your trash with you for days since you'll pass a trash can about every 10 minutes.\n\nAs a result of all this, your backpack could be as light as 1 kg (2.2 pounds). To compare, my ultralight backpack on the CDT weighed 3 kg. However, many pilgrims prefer to lug around all sorts of luxuries and end up with heavy backpacks of 10 kg (22 pounds) or more.\n\nYou don't need a map or navigation skills because the route is well marked.\n\nThe wide path lets you walk side-by-side with your companion(s), making for easy conversation.\n\nYou'll never have to bushwhack.\n\nYou'll never have to hitchhike to resupply.\n\nIt's flat, easy hiking nearly everywhere, with occasional gentle climbs/descents. It is graded for cars/bikes (which is even easier than equestrian trails.) - you can rent a car for your trip here.\n\n4 good or bad traits, depending on your perspective\n\nIt's extremely social. There are lots of interesting people from all over the world to meet and talk with. (Those who prefer solitude will be frustrated.)\n\nAnyone can do the whole trail on a mountain bike. (Some hikers don't like sharing a path with bikers.)\n\nYou'll walk through 5-20 rustic villages per day. (Those who prefer wilderness will be disappointed.)\n\nMost Spaniards don't speak English well. Many non-Spanish speaking pilgrims were stunned and frustrated that despite attracting pilgrims from all over the world, the locals have made hardly any effort to learn the international language: English. (You, however, may cherish the opportunity to practice your Spanish. Spanish is my mother tongue so I was happy to speak in Spanish.)\n\nOnly about 1% of El Camino de Santiago is a narrow (1-meter wide) dirt trail; 99% is a road (either a dirt road, 2-track road, paved road with little traffic, or a busy highway). It's almost never a narrow footpath where pilgrims are forced to walk in a single file.\n\nAbout half the time you're on a paved road or on a dirt path right next to a paved road. Some of the paved roads have little traffic, but others are quite busy.\n\nBecause you're on a paved road so often, by the end of the day your feet may feel like they've been put through a meat tenderizer. Although I've hiked over 65 km in one day in steep mountains, I found it harder to do 65 km in one day on the flat Camino. My feet just ached too much from all paved roads.\n\nAbout 95% of the time, car traffic is within earshot. El Camino often gives you the illusion that cars aren't near because you sometimes can't see the nearby paved road which may have infrequent traffic. However, it takes just one car to remind you that there is indeed a road nearby.\n\nAmenities distract from any spiritual mission you may have. With endless bars, restaurants, hotels, vending machines, tour groups, you're hardly removed from the \"real world.\" This defeats much of the purpose of living primitively in a search for a deeper meaning or understanding of life. On the other hand, it's nice to have easy access to ice cream.\n\nThe scenery is monotonous. It's endless pastoral farmland everywhere you look. Far in the horizon, you might glimpse some real mountains. The most photogenic places are the towns and villages; since you can drive (or bike) to all of them, there's no practical need to walk between them.\n\nIt's a skin cancer magnet. Infrequent trees mean that a brutal sun is hammering you most of the day. In the summer, it's hard to tolerate.\n\nUnfriendly commercialism. El Camino has become a big business, where the locals are sometimes unfriendly and seem to just care about getting your money.\n\nIt's a cacophony of sounds. Rumbling 18-wheel trucks, ear-splitting motorcycles, angry barking dogs, blaring music from cafes, honking horns, and ringing cell phones. El Camino assaults your eardrums. At least, there were no jack-hammers. Oh, wait. I walked by one of those too.\n\nIt's hard to take a piss. There's little privacy. Cars and pilgrims are constantly passing you by. After 3 p.m. most pilgrims retire to their albergues (huts) and you'll get more privacy to do your business. Nevertheless, at 7 p.m. one jogger still managed to catch me with my pants down.\n\nPilgrim: A traveler that is taken seriously. â€” Ambrose Bierce\n\nEl Camino de Santiago's dirty little secret\n\nDespite all this hiking fervor, the bad news is that by 1987 Spain had paved over much of the historic Camino because the old path took the fastest and flattest way toward Santiago, which is desirable for vehicle traffic.\n\nI rarely stayed in the albergues (huts) because I prefer to sleep outside than pay $10 to sleep with many people who snore and make a racket going to bed late. However, 5 km before Santiago, I celebrated by staying at the albergue. When I signed in, I asked the lady, \"Is it a busy night tonight?\"\n\n\"No, only 30 pilgrims are staying here.\"\n\n\"What's the maximum capacity?\"\n\n\"550.\"\n\n550?! It looked huge from the outside, but since I arrived at night, I couldn't tell just how enormous this albergue was. There's a series of buildings to house pilgrims. Incredibly, during the summer, they're overflowing.\n\nTo be fair, most albergues are far smaller, hosting fewer than 100 pilgrims. Still, one hundred is a lot!\n\nFeeling like Spiderman\n\nComparing El Camino de Santiago with America's Triple Crown trails\n\nSome have asked me to compare El Camino de Santiago with the Triple Crown. The Triple Crown comprises America's three most popular long-distance trails (AT, PCT, CDT).\n\nLet's compare the distances. Most pilgrims start somewhere near the Pyrenees, doing 800-900 km. Pilgrims are impressed when someone from Switzerland, Germany, or Austria does just over 2,000 km. And those who start further become legends. One guy many talked about had walked from Jerusalem, about 6,000 km.\n\nNow compare these distances with the Appalachian Trail (3,000 km), the Pacific Crest Trail (4,250 km), or the Continental Divide Trail (4,500 km). Anyone who does the AT walks 50% more than even the \"elite\" pilgrims from Austria.\n\nFurthermore, the Triple Crown trails cover relatively isolated, steep mountain ranges. Thru-hikers may have to cover up to 300 km between convenient resupply points. On El Camino de Santiago, you'll never go more than 10 km between resupply points, and it's primarily flat terrain everywhere.\n\nTherefore, one can argue that walking 6,000 km from Jerusalem is comparable to thru-hiking the PCT or CDT because it's flatter and has far more resupply points than the PCT and CDT. By that measure, anyone who thru-hikes the PCT or CDT has god-like hiking abilities by El Camino de Santiago standards.\n\nThe point of these comparisons is not to argue that the Triple Crown trails are \"better\" than El Camino de Santiago but rather to illustrate that they are nearly incomparable! They are different experiences. They're so different that if you like one, you'll probably dislike the other. Hence, this explains why I think El Camino de Santiago sucks.\n\nSome Camino fans will argue that my way to Santiago had two major flaws. First, the alternate through Los Picos de Europa and Asturias, while scenic, made me miss out on nearly half of El Camino Frances, so my journey wasn't typical. Second, by avoiding albergues, I missed out on the social aspect of El Camino, which, for many pilgrims, is the best part of the journey.\n\nAlthough I understand these criticisms, I hiked with enough pilgrims and stayed at enough albergues to get a good idea about the social side of El Camino. It's true: the social opportunities are precious and unique. Unlike America's Triple Crown, El Camino attracts a truly international crowd. However, I want more than cool international people on a trail. I can get a multicultural experience on the New York City Subway. A trail, for me, should take me away from civilization and deep into nature. On that metric, El Camino fails miserably.\n\nGoing to the very end: Fisterra\n\nAbout 5% of the pilgrims don't finish in Santiago but continue walking another 88 km to the end of the world: Fisterra. The Spanish call the place Finisterra, but the local Gallegos, who have their language in the Galician region of Spain, call it Fisterra. The Romans gave its name because they believed it was the end of the earth.\n\nAs brilliant as the Romans were, they didn't have GPS. As a result, Fisterra is a big hoax. Although it may feel like you're standing on the edge of the world in Fisterra, it's not the westernmost part of Europe. That point is hundreds of kilometers further south near Lisbon, Portugal.\n\nWhat's even more galling is that Fisterra is not even the westernmost point in Spain! The actual westernmost point is a few kilometers to the north. What a ripoff!\n\nFortunately, I knew all this as I walked there, so at least I knew that I was being an idiot.\n\nOnce you get there, however, you can see why the Romans thought this was the ultimate land's end. It feels like you're standing on the edge of the planet.\n\nYou'll never believe who did El Camino de Santiago in reverse\n\nAs I stood at Fisterra, I thought about a man who also stood there and would later become the President of the United States. This man was desperate after crossing the Atlantic Ocean: his ship was leaking and would soon sink. Fisterra was the first piece of ground available, so he landed there. However, his desperation didn't stop. The future of the United States depended on him. If he failed on his mission, the United States might collapse.\n\nHe did something incredible with no ship: he followed El Camino de Santiago in reverse! He hurried as fast as he could, eager to cover as much ground as possible. He was so hurried that he didn't even have time to see Santiago de Compostela, something he would later deeply regret. But it didn't matter at that moment â€“ he had to save his nation, and time was running out.\n\nHe crossed all of Spain, often on El Camino de Santiago, went over the Pyrenees, through southern France, and to Paris! All of it over land and at a ferocious pace. Once in Paris, he hurried straight to the highest office in the land. His mission?\n\nTo beg.\n\nHe begged the French for money and weapons to kill the British. The French hesitated. They weren't pleased that the American diplomat didn't speak French (bien sÃ»r!). Nevertheless, the French agreed to help this rebellious American terrorist.\n\nIt was June 1779, three years into the American Revolutionary War. Without French assistance, the United States may not have become the nation it is today. This partly explains why Americans returned the favor when they helped to liberate France from the Nazis 165 years later.\n\nThis man, who traveled much of El Camino de Santiago in reverse, from Fisterra to Paris, to save our nation, returned a hero and became America's first Vice President, serving under George Washington. Later, the United States elected this man to become the second President of the United States. His name was John Adams.\n\nBeware of the bitch at the end of the world\n\n\"Why not?\" I asked in my fluent Spanish.\n\n\"You don't have enough stamps on your credential. The trip from Santiago to Fisterra takes three days, so you should have three stamps. You only have one stamp. So you can't stay.\"\n\n\"No. You should have gotten your stamps even if you don't stay at the albergues.\"\n\n\"But sometimes the albergues are 100 meters off El Camino. Do I have to go out of my way for a stamp?\"\n\n\"Yes, you should.\"\n\nIt had taken me 25 days to traverse the Pyrenees from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic Ocean. It also took 25 days to walk El Camino de Santiago from St. Jean Pied-de-Port to Fisterra. In sum, It took me 50 days to walk across Spain twice, once south to north and once east to west.\n\n.be&t=2m\">\n\nRecommendations\n\nDon't go in the summer. First, it's the most crowded period. Albergues are usually packed, and people can get cranky. Second, summer in Spain is brutally hot. Go during any other season, even winter, which sees little snow on most of El Camino.\n\nUnless you love road walking, bike El Camino de Santiago. Mountain bikers can travel the same path the walkers use. Most say you only go twice as fast on a bike because the muddy parts, climbs, and irregular surface slows you down. However, a decent mountain biker should be able to go three times faster than a walker. Typical bikers cover 40-80 km daily (most walkers cover 20-40 km). A good mountain biker could do 100 km daily, allowing you to go from France to Santiago de Compostela in less than 10 days.\n\nIt's also possible to use a road bike because there is almost always a paved road parallel to El Camino. Fast road bikers can cover 150 km daily, allowing you to do the whole Camino in less than a week. However, I don't recommend this because biking on narrow paved roads with car traffic is dangerous. Instead, take a mountain bike and stay on El Camino.\n\nHike a similar route that I took. Start in Hendaye, France. Follow El Camino del Norte until you're north of Los Picos de Europe, and then climb up (south) into that national park. Once you're in the middle of Los Picos de Europa, head west, crossing the Asturias region, connecting many existing paths. Continue until you cross El Camino Primitivo (yet another designated path to Santiago), or until you get to Ponferrara or Lugo, you'll rejoin El Camino Frances. From there, join the herd to Santiago. This is the best backpacking route because it focuses on scenery, solitude, wilderness, and mountains. It's certainly the most brutal way to Santiago, but it's worth it.\n\nConsider hiking El Camino del Norte. As I've mentioned, El Camino Frances is just one path to Santiago. The northern route runs near the coast, offering ocean and mountain views nicer than the views on El Camino Frances. You'll have more up-and-down terrain, but it's worth it for the views and varied geography. Also, the Northern Route is less famous than the Camino Frances, so you'll enjoy less competition for the facilities. However, there are not that many albergues, so they can fill up quite quickly in the summer, so be prepared to camp if you go during the summer. Although it's not as well marked as El Camino Frances, it's reasonably well marked, so you won't have to invent some route through Asturias as I did. It has roughly the same amount of road walking as the Camino Frances. This may be the best way to go for those who want a less crowded Camino yet still want to taste the experience.\n\nHike the Pyrenees instead. Forget El Camino. Do the Pyrenees. It's far more challenging but far more rewarding. I adored the Pyrenees. The best trail is the HRP (High Route Pyrenees), next is the GR 11 (goes on the Spanish side), and the least amazing (but still great) is the GR 10 (on the French side). There are still plenty of comforts in the Pyrenees thanks to all the refugios (where you can get a shower for $5, a meal for $15, and a bed for $35). The scenery and adventure are as great as the John Muir Trail.\n\nAlternatively, you can join one of the tours and go hiking accompanied by a transfer and a guide:\n\nâ†’ Full-Day Spiritual Pyrenees Adventure from Lourdes\n\nâ†’ Pyrenees Mountains & Medieval Towns Small Group Day Trip from Barcelona\n\nâ†’ Pyrenees Hiking from Barcelona\n\nSee the books below.\n\nBe realistic!\n\nMany have romantic visions of El Camino that aren't realistic. The media doesn't help: one brochure about El Camino with 50 photos showed photos of civilization (e.g., towns, churches, bridges) about 80% of the time! Only 10 photos showed El Camino itself, and none showed El Camino on a paved road. Photos on websites also emphasize man-made structures and not nature, hiding most of the everyday reality of El Camino.\n\nLet's hope you learned about the side of El Camino de Santiago that few discuss. If you decide to do El Camino de Santiago, at least you will know what you're getting into. Happy trials! Er, I mean, trails!\n\nBuen Camino!\n\nAlternatives to El Camino Frances Podcast\n\nSusan Alcorn has written a couple of books about El Camino de Santiago."
