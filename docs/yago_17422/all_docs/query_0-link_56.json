        "text": "Itâ€™s the weekend once again and the sun is out in Dublin. I feel itâ€™s about time to post another Weekend Watch. This video has been on YouTube for a month or so now and is probably the most realistic videos I have watched regarding the Camino. The pilgrim, Jamie Nicoll, started his Camino in St Jean Pied de Port in April 2014 and from there, he has brief conversations with the people he meets. These brief conversations turn to friendships and you can see the friendships, as well as the aches and pains, grow as the video and his Camino goes on. It is a little bit long at 2 hours but if you have some time to spare, it is well worth the watch. Keep an eye out for a number of Irish peregrinos! ðŸ™‚\n\nIf you enjoyed this post let me know by hitting the â˜…Like button, and sharing the love on your socials!\n\nâ€¦ And if you want to hang out with me between posts then follow me on Instagram and on Facebook for daily and more personal updates!"
