Tejano singer Selena appeared in two episodes.\n\nThe series tells the story of Juan Daniel, known as Johnny, a U.S.-born Mexican truck driver and family man who falls in love with a woman he meets in his travels, and of the complications as a consequence of his new love. Dos Mujeres... used the then-new North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as a backdrop to the story; Johnny transported merchandise from Mexico to the United States.\n\nJohnny had enemies in Tijuana, where he was blamed for the death of Bernardo Montegarza (Eduardo Liceaga), son of the Montegarza family. Johnny is still very much in love with his wife (Laura León) when he falls for a young waitress, Tanya (Bibi Gaytán), whose mother owns a restaurant that Johnny frequents.\n\nTanya does not know he is married, and Raymundo, a police officer in love with Tanya, is working with fellow officer Ángel to pursue the head of the family that blames Johnny for the young man's death. It is later discovered that Johnny did not cause Bernardo's death (his own sister Alejandra, who was secretly in love with Johnny, had sabotaged a truck thinking that Johnny would use it), and while he was struggling to decide whether he wants to stay with his wife or his girlfriend, Tanya dies taking a knife thrust intended for her rival – Johnny's wife – Ana Maria.\n\nA side story involves Tanya's friend Graciela being pursued by Bernardo's younger brother Ricardo, and egged on by her mother, but preferring Ángel, who along with Raymundo are pursuing a drug trafficker known simply as Medusa, who turns out to be Bernardo, who was taken in by a drug cartel and changed his identity. Graciela becomes pregnant with Ricardo's child, but she begins to like Ángel more as a potential husband. It is also revealed that Tanya's real father was in fact Ismael Montegarza, patriarch of the Montegarza family and father of Bernardo, Alejandra and Ricardo; Ismael refuses to have anything to do with Bernardo after realizing what he had been doing, and decides to support Ricardo, the only son who was truly loyal to him.\n\nJohnny and Ana Maria seem to reconcile after Tanya's death. The final scene shows the couple retiring for the evening; Johnny, however, in the middle of the night, has a nightmare about Tanya's death, and calls her name in his sleep. When he awakes in the morning, Ana Maria and the children are gone, but in a letter, she promises that he will see the children, but not her.\n\nErik Estrada as Juan Daniel \"Johnny\" Villegas\n\nLaura León as Ana María Romero de Villegas\n\nBibi Gaytán as Tania García Pérez / Tania Montegarza Pérez\n\nEnrique Rocha† as Don Ismael Montegarza\n\nLuz María Jerez as Alejandra Montegarza Almonte\n\nElizabeth Dupeyrón as Amalia Núñez de Toruño\n\nClaudio Báez† as Enrique Iliades\n\nJosé Flores as Emiliano\n\nRodrigo Vidal as Ricardo \"Richi\" Montegarza Almonte\n\nItatí Cantoral as Graciela Toruño Nuñez / Graciela Torres Nuñez\n\nRoberto Palazuelos as Raymundo Soto #1\n\nSergio Sendel as Raymundo Soto #2\n\nJuan Carlos Casasola as Leobardo\n\nMaría Clara Zurita as Elena Pérez de García\n\nMario Sauret as Agustín García Ordoñez\n\nJorge Salinas as Ángel Lascuraín\n\nFrancisco Huerdo as Guillermo \"Memo\" Villegas Romero\n\nCarlos Miguel as Cristóbal Platas\n\nGabriela Platas as Paola Iliades\n\nMembers of Grupo Bronco as Themselves\n\nLorena Herrera as Lorena Arau Bermúdez\n\nYear Award Category Nominee Result 1994 12th TVyNovelas Awards Best Telenovela of the Year Emilio Larrosa Nominated Best Antagonist Actor Enrique Rocha Best Leading Actor Won Best Young Lead Actress Itatí Cantoral Nominated Best Young Lead Actor Rodrigo Vidal Won"
