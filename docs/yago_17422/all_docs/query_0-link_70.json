        "text": "The Camino del Norte, or the Northern Way is also known as Ruta de la Costa or the Coastal Way and is the oldest route pilgrims followed from France to Santiago de Compostela. Its history dates back to the 9th century when King Alfonso II of Asturias made the first pilgrimage to the newly discovered relics of St James. At that time travel through central Spain was dangerous as Moorish armies moved northward. With the reconquest of Spain in the 11th century, Camino Frances or the French Way became the more popular route. The current route passes through four beautiful yet distinct regions: Basque, Cantabria, Asturias, and Galicia. The Spanish people are are helpful, and friendly."
