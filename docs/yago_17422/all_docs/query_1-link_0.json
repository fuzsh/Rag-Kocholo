        "text": "As someone who has walked several Camino routes (my first was in 2013), I was curious to hear from anyone who has walked ANY Camino, say pre-year 2000, and what the experience was like.\n\nI walked my first Camino - the Camino Frances - in 1990.

Enjoy your future walks wherever they may take you.\n\nIt is funny... I didn't get a chance to walk at all pre-COVID. So - I can't compare/contrast as asked by the OP... but at the same time, I kind of feel like my first Camino experience is similar to what @Bradypus described. When was my first Camino? 2021. Spain opened to vaccinated visitors on June 7 and France opened to vaccinated visitors on June 9th. I left Arizona and then New York on June 6th and then arrived in Madrid on June 7th and made my way to Pamplona. On June 8th - I made my way to SJPDP via bus to Roncesvalles and then Taxi to SJPDP as the bus did NOT cross the French border yet (since COVID). I began my walk on June 9th - the day France was officially open to me. There were VERY few of us. Between SJPDP and probably Burgos - there were never more than about 30 of us per day walking the same stages - although some stretches had a lot of local day hikers. Between Burgos to Leon - we slowly started to pick up more Pilgrims along the way - with a bigger jump in numbers in Leon. Still - I doubt there were even 60 of us per day. Then it was very busy after Sarria - but by no means - busy compared pre-COVID or post-COVID years though.\n\nVery few albergues were open, although there was a mix of private and public - depending on location. Many public albergues were still closed as well as most privates and religious albergues - but for the most part, there was at least 1 available in most STAGE towns (not necessarily so between stage towns) and for the most part, we were all able to find a bed in the town we wanted to stay in. But we did have to do more research to see what was open and where - AND make some reservations. Heck, even some public albergues were requiring reservations which as we all know - isn't the norm. Bars for the most part didn't open until later - if at all. There were some days that there was nowhere to purchase food along the way for many hours/kms. Even grocery store hours were very hard to figure out in the small villages. I truly had to plan ahead and learn to stop every time I did pass an open grocery store. There were very few locals out even. And masks were still required even outdoors - so in town - we all had to mask up and keep socially distant.\n\nWith all that in mind - the locals I did interact with were wonderful and it was often the non-English speaking ones that wanted to have conversations with me the most. Even after I told them - in spanish - that I spoke very little Spanish and I didn't understand them lol. When I walked into businesses - they were so excited to see a pilgrim and were hopeful that more were behind me. One day I couldn't find an albergue in the first two small towns I tried to stop in. I was cold, wet, and exhausted when I got to Ages and I stopped in a cute little bar to warm up and eat something. Afterwards - I was trying to access an albergue but no one was there - the Spanish speaking only men at the bar saw me and kept motioning me to stay there. One of them ran somewhere and got a young man to come and open the albergue for me. I got the royal treatment. Later - I asked the man who runs the bar if there is somewhere I could get a meal - he snuck me upstairs and had his wife make a special meal just for me. Then he told me to return at 7am and he would have breakfast for me. And I had these kinds of special experiences like this all along the Frances.\n\nAnyhow - I wish I could have walked the Camino years ago, long before it was crowded - but I walked the Frances the PERFECT year for me! I had a LOT of solitude, which I desperately needed. I could walk completely alone for many hours at a time. A few days I didn't see anyone until I arrived in town for the day. I am kind of afraid to go back to the Frances because I know it will be so different. This year I did the Norte/Primitivo and LOVED the experience on the Primitivo. Just the right balance of lower pilgrim numbers but still having a total feel of \"Camino Spirit\".\n\nI walked my first Camino - the Camino Frances - in 1990.

The Mozarabe. The VdlP. Routes in Norway and Japan.\n\n1999 was my first Camino and on the Frances. I only met 5 Americans between SJPP and Santiago. You could walk for many miles all by yourself. i walked it again three years ago and I was dumbfounded by the huge numbers of people, many not carrying packs, who were both noisy and complaining. There were some surprising route changes. Albergues were full of people—many with feelings of entitlement—from spreading gear all over to leaving bathrooms a mess for someone else to tidy up. i walked both times in September into October. I will probably not walk on the Frances again.\n\nI walked my first Camino - the Camino Frances - in 1990.

The Mozarabe. The VdlP. Routes in Norway and Japan.\n\nGreat story, I first walked from Leon to Santiago in 1998 and he hit a home run with the description of the “old days”. I have since gone back a dozen times including the Arogonnes way and Primitivo, both of which share some early traits . Getting lost was a daily experience , but the locals were always helpful. I knew little about the route and the first time I saw a sign for “perigrinos” I thought falcons instead of walkers. I had prior experience hiking in England & Scotland. But the weather there was terrible. My favorite joke was “ it only rained twice last week , once for four days and once for three days” well I enjoy the Camino and plan to hike again, Primitivo, in early summer .\n\nDoes anyone know if the brown pilgrims’ cape was part of the revival, or if it was something pilgrims used to wear as recently as the 1990s (or maybe a bit of both)?\n\nI’ve always been curious because on my first Camino Frances in 2007, there was a bartender in Sarria who proudly showed me photos of his pilgrimage years before. They looked to be at least ten years old, so no later than 1997, in winter around O Cebreiro. He was wearing normal cold-weather clothes and carried a large (non hi-tech) pack and a regular wooden walking stick – and he wore a striking long brown cape. It made quite an impression against the mountains. The next time I saw the cape was in Santiago, where it appeared more like a modern interpretation for tourists of what a medieval pilgrim would wear.\n\nBut because this Spanish pilgrim had worn one in the 90s – with plain shoulders, not the shell and cross insignias – I’ve always wondered if it used to be a normal, non-exotic piece of gear, especially among Spaniards or Galicians. (This is a very minor question in a broad and fascinating discussion, I know!)\n\nSantiago as a pilgrim on the Baroque façade of Santiago cathedral.\n\nFrom: The Passionate Man’s Pilgrimage (Sir Walter Raleigh)\n\nGive me my scallop shell of quiet,\n\nMy staff of faith to walk upon,\n\nMy scrip of joy, immortal diet,\n\nMy bottle of salvation,\n\nMy gown of glory, hope’s true gage,\n\nAnd thus I’ll take my pilgrimage.\n\nI recently read an article by Luis Martínez García (of Valladolid university) mentioning that in mediaeval times, some hospedales would only admit pilgrims who carried the usual paraphernalia of gown, staff etc and that their staff was often notched to make sure they did not come back again (apparently there were a lot of false pilgrims, what Aymery Picaud terms 'Picaros' and other folk up to no good on the camino back then).\n\nThere are also numerous mentions of departing pilgrims having their gown, staff, gourd and satchel blessed before they set out rather in the way crusaders had their weapons blessed.\n\nSo in answer to your question, no, not a modern interpretation - what pilgrims actually wore.\n\nHere's a bit of how the French part of my 1994 from Paris was like.\n\nNo other pilgrims, no yellow arrows nor any other waymarkers, no clear sense of where to go except more or less \"thataway\", occasionally getting blocked by a railway, motorway, or river, until you start to work out how to avoid them in advance.\n\nAnd also much sleeping outdoors, though local priests and monks and so on did help, and there were many more of them 30 years ago, and sometimes in glorious locations with views over incredible vistas under the sparkling Milky Way.\n\nSometimes in a bed, sometimes in the woods, sometimes on the floor, in a barn, on the grass, in a panorama of extraordinary beauty, or on wet leaves in the freezing cold. On dust, on mud, on concrete, on any surface at all to lay your head, with a welcome or denied it, that was and is the Camino when you are outside of the infrastructures, and how it was prior to their existence.\n\nAnd with that, the help and love of strangers, in small matters and profound, some food, some drink, some comfort wherein to lay your head, or eat a simple feast, and even just be encouraged along the way.\n\nI cut across the country avoiding Léon in 1994 as they had not seen fit to open an Albergue for the pilgrims that year, and I walked through villages where washer women shared the waters of the village fount with horses come there to quench their thirst from the heat of the day.\n\nA little old lady in the midst of France giving with honour the gift of a simple omelette and a glass of clear water, to this day the best meal I have had on any of these Camino Ways.\n\nIt was and is a baroque assemblage of provision and want.\n\nAs was mentioned above, my first Camino was in the spring of 1989 - not too far off from Bradypus. I was living in Madrid at the time and the first thing I did was go to the Spanish Tourism office to see what they had. I picked up a couple of brochures on the \"Camino de Santiago\" (which, at the time, was synonymous with the Camino Frances, or the Camino Frances+Camino Aragones. No one was talking about the Camino del Norte, or the Camino Primitivo, or the Camino Portugues, or other Caminos in anything I could find at the time. Also of interest, perhaps, is that one of the brochures I was given (printed in the 70s) showed the Camino going along the roads and everywhere there was a gas station along the way. Even in the late 80s, it was not uncommon to find people driving the Camino instead of walking it. I will admit that the Camino I did then had a fair share of hitchhiking, as well as walking, unlike my subsequent Caminos. And many of the rides I got were from people on pilgrimage from Italy or Germany or elsewhere, driving along the Camino route from town to town and village to village.\n\nI started in Roncesvalles, because I was coming from Madrid and from Spanish people, that's where I heard that the Camino started. When I got there I knew nothing about credencials, or the Compostela, or anything like that. I was given a credencial in Roncesvalles (which was a cardboard rectangle folded in half, specific to the Roncesvalles start point, with a limited number of spaces for stamps, each labelled with the town the stamp was to come from). The credencial came from the Friends of the Camino group in Estella. I never used it, not asked for my Compostela on that pilgrimage. That wasn't why I was doing the pilgrimage. I think I'm going to take it on my next Camino Frances and see if I can fill in the stamps and what they will make of it in Santiago.\n\nAs others have said, there was a lot less infrastructure back then. I have vivid memories of arriving in O Cebreiro, cold and wet. This was before the albergue had been build and before it had turned into the tourist mecca it is today. There was one inn in the village and it was full. They let me lay my sleeping back down before the fireplace in the main room. I don't think I ever felt as much like a medieval pilgrim as I did that night. I later heard that sometimes they let pilgrims sleep in the thatched roof pallozas.\n\nI recently went back and looked at some old photos from that pilgrimage and I was surprised to see how much infrastructure there actually was at the time. Others have mentioned that the yellow arrows were already in place. In fact, 1989 was the same year that the person who was responsible for those yellow arrows passed away. But that wasn't all the signage. I have photos of those huge signboards you may recall from Castilla y Leon showing the Camino through the province marked vertically. They were already there. And I have photos of an elaborate mosaic on the streets of Santo Domingo de la Calzada showing the Camino route.\n\nAnother big difference back then was how the Camino ended. Back then, you didn't enter the Cathedral in Santiago de Compostela like you do today, from the side. You entered through the Portico of Glory and you put your hand on the central Tree of Jesse pillar, in the grooves made by countless hands before you."
