        "text": "Stay: Hospeder√≠a San Mart√≠n Pinario / Inmaculada, 3, 15704 Santiago de Compostela\n\nFINAL DAY!! Unfortunately, also the longest day with over 15miles of hiking üòÖ. I‚Äôd like to say it was great last day and would totally do again, but alas, the morning started with rain. And wind. And RAIN. We decided to have breakfast in our hotel since the wind was ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to get better later in the day, but it was still pretty bad by the time we left around 9am.\n\nShortly into our hike, we met back up with our friend Vera and walked with her for quite a long time. Plz enjoy the photos of the day:\n\nWho‚Äôs having fun? NO ONE!\n\nPictured: the only person on the camino with an umbrella (me). Also pictured: the only person that wasn‚Äôt completely soaked BECAUSE I had an umbrella. SEEMS LIKE ONE OF US IS REALLY THE SMART ONE.\n\nThere was a nice church after about 1 hour that you could stop in for one dryness.\n\nWe carried on until the next rest stop- some random food place- that everyone on the camino appeared to be stopping in for food or the bathroom (also a doggo!)\n\nThere was a nice walk through the forest‚Ä¶. well it would‚Äôve been nice if it hadn‚Äôt been a waterfall of water coming down and tons of mud. FUN FUN FUN.\n\nAfter about 3.5 hours‚Ä¶. IT STOPPED RAINING ü•≥ü•≥. The sun even came out!! Wowowoowow. Sadly, there was no recovering for our soaked feet/shoes so got to walk in wet socks for the remaining 9 miles (much fun). But at least it wasn‚Äôt raining.\n\nWe stopped for some snacks on a random bench\n\nIn the last 5km we ran into one of the other American couples and one portuguese guy we have seen quite a few times!\n\nThe last mile my feet were dying (stay tuned for a gross blister photo- this is your warning to turn away). You can see I was always about 20 feet ahead of my mom- I was ready to be done and started walking quickly!\n\nFINALLY WE MADE IT!!!\n\nWe sat in the square (as many of the other pilgrims were doing) for about 20mins, then we walked down to the pilgrims office to get our official certificates which show how you completed at least 100km of the pilgrimage.\n\nAfter we got the certificates, we finally made it to our hotel and were able to take off our wet socks. FINAL WARNING BEFORE BLISTER (yes that entire part that appears to be ‚Äúsee through‚Äù is my blister)\n\nWe only rested for about 1hr before heading back out into the town. We went into the Cathedral this time and realized the Pilgrims mass was going to be in about 45minutes so we sat and relaxed in the church after walking around until the mass started. The mass lasted about 45mins- all in Spanish again, but it‚Äôs a catholic mass so you generally know what‚Äôs going on. They do a mini shout out to the pilgrims at the beginning and list all the countries that people came into Santiago that day (who got certificates for walking the pilgrimage).\n\nThe church itself was pretty big. The main alter was EXTREMELY extravagant. The church is famous because they found the remains of St. James here and basically this whole church is built around that. The remains are underneath the main alter- you can go down a little passageway to ‚Äúsee‚Äù them.\n\n2022 (extended from 2021 cause of covid) is also a Holy Year. It‚Äôs kind of confusing how often they occur but plz research. Anyways, there is something called the Jubliee and you can obtain the holy year jubilee by walking through the door of forgiveness, completing confession, and taking communion. The door of forgiveness is sealed at any time that is not a holy year, then, during the holy year, a priest will take a silver hammer and break the seal and reopen the door. Walking through is the first step to total forgiveness of your sins (although you‚Äôre also supposed to do a confession).\n\nWe obviously walked through the door!\n\nWe walked around to a few gift shops before trying to find dinner. I found a place with lots of good reviews but we got there and it was a Michelin Star restaurant and fully booked out. We ended up going to a random place called Enxebre. The food ended up being pretty decent! Not quite as cheap as it was along the way though!\n\nBy the time we finished dinner it was about 10:30pm. We headed back to the hotel to get ready for bed."
