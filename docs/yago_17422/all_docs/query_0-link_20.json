The first journey was driven mainly by curiosity for something totally beyond my own very limited experience: language, history, landscape and culture all way outside my small-town Scottish upbringing. With a dash of religious enthusiam on the side. I walked my second Camino 12 years later to try to recapture some of the joy which I encountered on that first journey. My first Camino had been a profound moving and transformative experience and at that particular point in my life I desperately needed some more of that. My third Camino Frances was walked with far fewer expectations or hopes but more as a way of observing for myself the changes in the Camino which had taken place over 25 years and to find if the reality of the day corresponded with the descriptions of the modern Camino which I had read here and in other places.\n\nJeff Crawley\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nA \"Tourigrino\" trip once Covid has passed, so 2023\n\nDec 21, 2019\n\n#3\n\nFour times in the vain hope that one day I'll get it \"right\".\n\nBack in 2001 I met a Belgian who was on his 17th . . . mind you he did write the annual guide for the Belgian confraternity.\n\nC clearly\n\nModerator\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nMost years since 2012\n\nDec 21, 2019\n\n#4\n\nWhy not?

These routes were influenced largely by Gitlitz and Davidson's book, The Pilgrimage Road to Santiago. Then my desire for solitude led me to the VdlP and this year to the Madrid and Invierno. But this year I found myself more comfortable on the Sahagun to Ponferrada section of the Frances that links the Madrid and the Invierno than I expected: quite at home and enjoying interactions with other pilgrims and those familiar sites from previous pilgrimages. I think that I am likely to choose portions of the Frances to walk as my mobility decreases in my later years: maybe ending in Santiago but starting closer than on previous walks. The available facilities at closer distances makes this a practical choice.\n\nAnniesantiago\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2006 to date: Over 21 Caminos.

I think the Frances is the best first Camino anyone can take on. I have 5 compostellas under my boots, none the same. With so many other caminos to experience along with other treks in other parts of this great planet and so little time I just can't grasp walking the same one over, especially the Frances.\n\nDavid Tallan\n\nModerator\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n1989, 2016, 2018, 2023, 2024...\n\nDec 22, 2019\n\n#13\n\nI have done the Camino Frances twice. I hope to walk it again. I also hope to walk other Caminos and other routes.\n\nI did it the first time in 1989, from Roncesvalles to Santiago and the second time in 2016 from Roncesvalles to Finisterre with my son, who turned 16 in Carrion de los Condes. The second was a completely different journey than the first.\n\nI could easily see doing it with my son again when I retire and he finishes university (although next time I think he would want to cross the Pyrenees; maybe we would start at Ostabat). Or maybe with my wife. Or maybe with another friend or relative. Or maybe starting earlier in France, in Le Puy or Vezelay or Paris, or Arles. Or maybe just starting in Roncesvalles again.\n\nWhy do people walk the CF again? I think for most people, because they like it. People often repeat things they enjoy, even when there are new things to discover. People will reread books, listen to songs more than once, watch movies more than once, visit cities more than once, etc. Even though one can never run out of new books to read, new music to listen to, new movies to watch (or old classic movies that one hasn't seen), new cities to visit. For the same reason as one revisits a well-loved book or song or movie or city one might revisit a well-loved Camino.\n\nOr so it seems to me. Your mileage might vary.\n\nBobM\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nV Frances; V Podensis; V Francigena; V Portugues; V Francigena del Sud; Jakobsweg.

Our first in 2015 was to celebrate the transition into retirement. The second in 2017 we walked with my brother and his wife. The third in 2019 was different in many ways than the first two. We walked several alternative routes, stayed in different towns, and stayed in private rooms every night. We are walking CF again in 2020. By next fall, we will celebrate the birth of our first two grandchildren (one each by two of our children). We are modifying our hiking stages to stay in our favorite towns and favorite albergues. We will dine in our favorite bar / restaurants, buy trail snacks at the tiendas we know, have a glass of wine or cerveza during hiking breaks. For us its like spending time with an old friend for 35+ days in a row. And enduring a long walk in the pouring rain and hiking the steep climbs gives us stories to tell for years to come. Can't wait until we're on the CF again next fall.

I often listen to certain music many times. A few books I have read repeatedly for their musicality of language - and sometimes for fresh insights.

As soon as I finished I determined to walk an alternative quieter path. I walked half of the vdlp in April 2018. Different enjoyable peaceful walk with some lovely people but I didn't find it had the pilgrim magic I encountered on the CF. So I walked the CF again starting August 2018. Felt a totally different trip than the first time. The magic this time was more social, stayed in different places, including special spots I missed the first time. I will be walking the Norte this year with a friend I met last year. Maybe do the CF every 5 years or so while I can.\n\nI feel those that feel that the CF is something very special will tend to want to walk it again. To those that it is just a long walk it makes sense to go and explore other ways.\n\ndomigee\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nNext: camino de Invierno\n\nDec 24, 2019\n\n#40\n\nI have enjoyed reading all your posts (as ever!) but I refrained from answering as others had said much the same things I would have said.\n\nThere’s one other factor though (imo): the Camino francés is so much easier than others. If you’ve had a tough year, whether in work or with health, family or whatever.... the CF is soooo less demanding than say somewhere new or more mountainous and isolated or whatever. You don’t have to plan, you don’t have to carry extra food and water, you don’t need a GPS or a compass, you don’t need to carry a tent. You just walk and follow the arrows\n\nI walked the CF for the third time after walking to Jerusalem and walking the VdlP. Oh it was so blissful. No language issues, I knew the way, it was so easy and therefore... pleasurable! It is what I needed at the time.\n\nThere are drawbacks of course. But then, you can’t have it all!\n\nI walked it a fourth time - after the Via Francigena - and I must admit, there were times I was bored and it was lonely and... yes, I’d done it all before sort of feeling! Even in Summer, the weather was grey and drizzly and I get plenty of this in England! ‘What am I doing here?’\n\nI nearly quitted but fate would have it another way....\n\nI probably will walk it again but adding some variants... the Invierno or the Leon to Oviedo one... and the Primitivo. I have been (very) blessed with very quiet and solitary walks on the CF so far but I don’t fancy the crowded parts again.\n\nSometimes, we (I ! ) need something familar to gently ease us back to life. And walking a familar path does the trick.\n\nOf course I fool myself thinking there is always another year, to walk new paths....

Since then I walk long distance trails every year, most years twice, and I have been back to the Frances for a 2 week section once. It is a magical route.\n\nBut I have walked long distance trails in Scotland, England, Switzerland (Jakobsweg), France (Le Puy), Portugal, Italy (Francigena), Vietnam and Peru. And I come from Canada.\n\nI consider these all \"Caminos\". I fall into a contemplative zone that I first found on the Frances. I am sure some of you know this zone. As I explain to people who ask \"Why do you keep walking?\" I answer ... The Camino many layers but one reason is, it's a long life and many things happen in one's lifetime, I find it helpful to contemplate, it helps me grow. At 65 I am still growing and it's picking up speed.\n\nSam - AU\n\nMember\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nCamino Frances - Apr/May 2018, Feb/Mar 2019 .... upcoming Nov/Dec 2019\n\nDec 25, 2019\n\n#42\n\nI’ve just finished my third way on the Camino Francés in less than 2 years.\n\nUltimately for me the camino keeps calling me back, although I am hoping this will be the last time for a little while.\n\nI had so many people this time around almost judge me for doing the same route 3 times running. I think the CF is best equipped for infrastructure, particularly in the off season even though most is closed I feel it is still the most ‘open’ of all the routes this time of year.\n\nI also chose to walk in completely different months each time, so it looks completely different, and there is something magical about seeing your favourite spots in all the seasons. The weather is different and I also try where possible to stay in different towns, meaning I get different sunrises and end of day struggle stretches on one camino may become blissful morning stretches on another. And the type of people every single time are completely different, which changes the whole camino.\n\ntrecile\n\nModerator\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nVarious routes 2016 - 2024\n\nDec 25, 2019\n\n#43\n\nThere's no way that you can experience every village, city and town on a single Camino Francés, and the first time can kind of be a blur, especially the first few days as you are adjusting to the routine, so on a second, third or fourth Camino on the same route you can deepen your experience and explore places in depth that you just walked through on previous Caminos.\n\nAs others have mentioned it can feel much different during different seasons. On my first two Caminos on the Frances is was mid to late summer, and much of the landscape was brown (but the sunflower fields were spectacular). This year I did SJPDP to León in May, because I was excited to see the Meseta when it was green. I was rewarded with endless blue skies, green seas of grains and red poppy fields.\n\nThere's a sense of both familiarity and discovery on repeat walks.\n\nNext year I will repeat the Norte from Irun, then do something new by finishing my journey to Santiago on the Primitivo.\n\nLast edited: Dec 26, 2019\n\nRemysMimi\n\nHooked on the Camino!!\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFrances (2018)\n\nFrances or Portuguese (2020)\n\nDec 26, 2019\n\n#44\n\nI have walked the Camino Frances three times.

I walked it again in 2019 with my daughter all the way to Fisterra. It was a different experience. In June 2020 we are walking the Portuguese starting from Coimbra on through Porto to Redondella on the inland route. We will then return to Porto by train and follow the coastal route back to Rodendella and then continue on to Santiago. This is all planned and ready to go. While I am waiting to start, I am looking at other Caminos for 2022. I will then be 79 so I don't want too many hills. Why do I do it?

I understand people doing the CF multiple times as you meet different people and the journey is also different.\n\nmai\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nPamplona-S 4/18\n\nSJPP-S-F/M 4/19\n\nSJPP-S 4/23,24\n\nJan 2, 2020\n\n#60\n\nThanks for all your sharing.\n\nI have finished CF twice, just wonder if to walk the third time.

The first two times were with his wife. After she passed away here he was walking for the third time, but by himself.\n\nHe was not particularly talkative. Once I met him deep in thought sitting on a seat and I was about to join him. I checked myself in time and left him in peace instead of disturbing a moment that seemed important to him.\n\nIt made quite an impression on me. Since then I have discovered that quite a few people walk the same Camino multiple times and it has always intrigued me.\n\nI would love to hear why others have chosen to walk multiple CFs.\n\nBob M\n\nWhen we repeat the Camino, we are not trying to recreate precious memories - memories themselves will shift over time as our perspective changes. Nothing stays the same, impermanence is all. Our precious memories allow us to reflect, rethink, and remember where we have been and how far we have come.\n\nPeregrinopaul\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nVdlP(2012) Madrid(2014)Frances(2015) VdlP(2016)\n\nVdlP(2017)Madrid/Sanabres/Frances reverse(2018)\n\nJan 4, 2020\n\n#62\n\n... and secondly to see if the Camino at 5km per hour was anyway different to the camino at 20 km per hour. Upon arriving in Santiago I was totally convinced that walking was a significantly different experience, especially being able to stop; take in the vista; take a photo; stop and talk to a fellow pilgrim.\n\nLike you, Mike, for me it was a case of \"do it on a bike\", or not at all. I remember fondly my first camino, the VdlP, as a very leisurely affair. I just checked my credencial and it took me 25 days - that's an average of 40km per day at maybe only 8km per hour. I'd recommend that experience to anybody.\n\nRobo\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFrances 15,16,18\n\nVdlP 23, Invierno 23, Fisterra 23\n\nJan 4, 2020\n\n#63\n\nThis isn't why I've walked the CF a few times, but have found a benefit of having done it over and over - I \"walk\" it if I can't sleep or to pass time on a plane or ...\n\nFrequently, I start these \"walks\" further along the CF not always in SJPP - after Lorca or Logroño or Nájera, Rabé, Carrion, Astorga, Camponaraya, Ruitelán for some variety.\n\nWonderful ~ and sooo relaxing z z zzzz\n\nI do the same!\n\nMy wife often asks me how can I possibly remember all the places I and We have stayed, or eaten at.\n\nI may have only 'physically' walked 3 Caminos but I've walked it dozens of times in my mind!\n\nDerrybiketours\n\nA journey of 500 miles begins with one step!\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nSJPdeP-FIN(09/2018)\n\nPORTO-SANT(11/2018)\n\nCaminho Da Fe(01/2019)\n\nSJPdeP- SANT(09/2019)\n\nMadrid(7/2020)\n\nJan 13, 2020\n\n#65\n\nIn September 2018 I now know that the Camino called. It lasted 3 months and involved CF to FIn, CP from Porto and in Jan 2019 I followed my flow to Brazil. The Camino de fe or CP didn't come close to the joy I experienced on CF but had no intention of returning and then one day I missed the feeling of joy in my life so I returned for 2nd time to walk CF and found the joy on the Meseta closely followed by Pain in Ponferrada. Nursing an ankle injury I stayed a second night in a local Airbnb. On returning from Pilgrim meal I was assaulted with hammer, mugged and experienced concussion after spending 24 hours in hospital . The next day Santiago called and when I got there no one was home. Despite staying in Santiago for a week, missed last flights to Ireland so found myself travelling 12 hours on overnight bus to Madrid to fly home last December. I returned home to resistance and Brexit and realised I was leaving behind my freedom, flow and joy so had I not have walked the Camino CF more than once I wouldn't be moving to Madrid. The CF moves in mysterious ways\n\nJscarm\n\nNew Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nWalked in May/June 2015\n\nPortuguese Camino 5/22\n\nJan 14, 2020\n\n#66\n\nMy wife and I will be walking the Camino for the second time this year.

On the camino's that follow, unconciously, you are searching for what you had, never finding it back. Your emotions, feelings are never going to be the same. Many people redo the very first, having wonderfull experiences, and do other camino's with even prettier vieuws, but one has lost one's innocence, it never reaches that \"high\" you once achieved on your first.\n\neasygoing\n\nCamino Sharon\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nI have walked the Camino Francis 7 times, twice in 2017 and 2018. (2019)\n\nFeb 23, 2020\n\n#68\n\nWell not experiencing a first Camino high may be true for some people's caminos. I reach a new high each camino. They keep getting better each time and this may be because I'm an experienced long-distance hiker My first one was lacking because I tried to hike it like the Pacific Crest trail. We walked too many miles and came back the next year to walk more slowly and had an even better time. Last spring I took my two granddaughters and enjoyed it even more seeing the joy in their eyes. I'm looking forward to my 11th Camino in the spring and who knows what surprises it will bring? I do know that I will have another best time of my life. I walked my 4th Camino all alone and ended up tearing a hamstring and limping the last 200 miles. If any Camino provided an emotional high it was that one because I learned that I am not measured by how fast I am or how I perform. This was something I had struggled with all my life and it was with great joy I learned this lesson.\n\nBut everyone is different so have a great Camino with no expectations.\n\nDerrybiketours\n\nA journey of 500 miles begins with one step!\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nSJPdeP-FIN(09/2018)\n\nPORTO-SANT(11/2018)\n\nCaminho Da Fe(01/2019)\n\nSJPdeP- SANT(09/2019)\n\nMadrid(7/2020)\n\nFeb 24, 2020\n\n#69\n\nnever reaches that \"high\" you once achieved on your first.\n\nThe first is special but it gets better with experience.

The first is still the most special. And the reason I keep coming back or trying other pilgrim routes in other countries. I think that the other journeys have been in large measure an attempt to recapture something of the outstanding spirit of that first Camino. Sometimes fairly successfully, occasionally less so. And the Camino Frances has changed so much over the years that after walking my third CF in 2016 I am fairly sure that I will not be back to walk it again.

My initial thought was automatically Why? then after some time passed now I can understand a bit, I think. FC is certainly a beautiful way and I think it is the most popular one that most people choose to walk for the first time. I was no exception.\n\nThere could be many different factors such as different seasons with different version of oneself, different stages of life, or/and first impression of this whole pilgrimage thing that has become the most influential thing that has ever happen in one's life and one does want to keep reminding oneself of that moment and see how perspective of life has changed since then.. etc... There could be many reasons for a person. Who knows but only themselves or maybe they don't even know for sure. They just walk the same way over and over without any particular reason.\n\nFor some people, Camino is not about exploring different routes/trails (some people call that way) and be proud of how many different routes/trails they have walked and tell people about it over the dinner table.\n\nLast edited: Feb 24, 2020\n\nBradypus\n\nMigratory hermit\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nToo many and too often!\n\nFeb 24, 2020\n\n#74\n\nMaybe this says more about your expectations , why do you feel the need to recapture anything.

One of many lessons I've learned is too leave behind your expectations and go forward with hope and give out love.\n\nIf you have left behind your expectations so completely why return to the same route at all? Isn't returning to the same route a response to something positive that you wish to experience again? Isn't there some expectation behind a decision to revisit the same place?\n\nI think that part of our difference in outlook may be down to timescale. Reading through your posts in this thread it seems that your Camino experiences have been over a relatively short period. My own first Camino was 30 years ago. There have been enormous changes over that time. Most obviously in the sheer numbers walking. Think back to your first Camino. Now imagine that each and every pilgrim you met is accompanied by seventy friends. Can you say with honesty that you would embrace the second imaginary experience with all the joy of your first Camino? I am a solitary person by nature and by preference. To be immersed in great crowds causes me unease and anxiety. One of the great joys of that first Camino was to walk day after day across Spain and to allow it to wash around me without the pressure of crowds and the near-constant clamour of voices. I also value my health, body and mind. And I know that deliberately exposing myself to situations which place mental and emotional stress upon me is harmful to them. So I choose my routes with that in mind. Is that so very wrong?\n\nRennieArchibald\n\nMember\n\nFeb 24, 2020\n\n#75\n\nSeriously?...Who can tire of dry chorizo bocadillos or fried until it's boot leather pieces of cow?\n\nRobo\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFrances 15,16,18\n\nVdlP 23, Invierno 23, Fisterra 23\n\nFeb 24, 2020\n\n#76\n\nWhen I walked the CF I met a man who was walking the CF for the third time.

Now imagine that each and every pilgrim you met is accompanied by seventy friends. Can you say with honesty that you would embrace the second imaginary experience with all the joy of your first Camino?\n\nI take the Camino how I find it, a people path of positive intention and any joy is carried inside and I try not too let the outside in uninvited\n\nAnd I know that deliberately exposing myself to situations which place mental and emotional stress upon me is harmful to them. So I choose my routes with that in mind. Is that so very wrong?\n\nNot at all and no one indicated that its wrong and we all have our issues with mental health and have our own way of managing this. Meditation and mindfulness can be one and talking to strangers another. Ive learned to quiet the mind and detatch myself when in a crowd, its easier when alone in nature. I've learned too have a conversation with myself when alone but its easier when there's a crowd. Where I am has no relevance and its a learned behaviour that requires practice.\n\nLast edited: Feb 25, 2020\n\nRichmond Gardner\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFr (17), Prim (19), CF/Norte ‘21, Le Puy/Inv22\n\nFeb 25, 2020\n\n#78\n\nSeriously?...Who can tire of dry chorizo bocadillos or fried until it's boot leather pieces of cow?\n\nThe Kolbist\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nPast Caminos: 9 routes (pls see below)\n\nFeb 25, 2020\n\n#79\n\nsimply put - because we love the camino. this might sound very cheesy but when asked why do I love my wife, I dont have a response. If I say it's her eyes or her nose or the way she walks then it's just a part of it. Even the answer - I love everything about her would not probably be enough. The answer is \"I dont know why I love her\". This is exactly how i feel about the Camino and why I love the camino.

I have been waffling, trying to decide if I will finish the VDLP this year or since I'm walking alone with Joe (not taking a group,) will go on the more familiar CF . I'm feeling pulled to the CF, exactly for the reason you state, it's familiar and the ease of it makes it feel like \"coming home.\" I still haven't decided. I'm back in the California desert today after all my medical appointments up in Oregon - and will take a look at the weather statistics on both routes today. I'm also stuffing my backpack today, putting it on, and walking a few kilometers to see if it bothers the biopsy site (since there's no pack transport on the VDLP). I need to make a decision in the next few days, but the Frances is calling me, I think, like an old friend ..."
