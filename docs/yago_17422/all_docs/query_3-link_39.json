        "text": "I've been working on many ideas for years, but thanks to advancements in AI for image, video, and sound, I have achieved incredible results in creating pitch videos. These tools have allowed me to fully express my intent as a filmmaker, bringing my visions to life with stunning visuals, immersive sound, and overall accelerating the development of my ideas faster than ever before. Think of this as Pitch Deck / Moodboard, it's the new era of pitching projects, no longer with literally screencaps from other movies. Here‚Äôs a pitch trailer for one of my current projects. Special thanks to Luma AI for their significant contribution in making this possible. Neo Filmmaking is already here. here's the Sinopsis for VAMPIRO: In a medieval kingdom ruled by vampire clans, each led by powerful matriarchs, humans are used as currency in a dark and twisted society. √ç√±igo de la Vega, a brave vampire hunter, searches for his kidnapped family. With the help of his brother, now turned into a powerful vampire, √ç√±igo must face the deadly Clan of the Nocturnals and uncover dark secrets. An epic battle for redemption and hope in a world shrouded in shadows. #lumadreammachine #aifilmmaking #aivideo #neofilmmaking\n\nWe are excited to announce that our sci-fi short film \"El Camino\" has reached 1 million views on DUST.
