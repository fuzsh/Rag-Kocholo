        "text": "I don’t sleep a wink on the plane, and by the time we land in Paris I feel high on caffeine and exhaustion. And this backpack. It weighs a ton. If Bill had been with me, well, he would have said, “Abbs, you don’t need to pack the kitchen sink, for heaven’s sake,” and he’d start pulling things out.\n\nBut Bill is not here, and I have planned this whole trip alone. Fiercely alone.\n\nI take the train to Le Puy-en-Velay, one of the four main starting parts for the pilgrimage in France. It is almost ninety degrees outside. Thank heavens there is air conditioning on the train.\n\nI step off the train, hoist my pack on my back, and pull my small suitcase behind me, in search of a taxi. I stop to take in my surroundings, looking up at the huge rock—more like a very narrow mountain—and gasp. I’ve seen photos spread across the Internet, but there she is, in real life. Or I should say, there they are. Mary and Jesus, way larger than life, perched high on a rock that dominates the city.\n\nShe’s called Notre Dame de France, and Wikipedia tells me that she was erected in 1860, standing in her glory way up there on a volcanic spur 130 meters high. The red statue was created and cast from the bronze metal recovered from 213 cannons captured from the Russians during the Crimean War. Leave it to the French to make the Virgin Mary from cannons! She’s huge—22 meters high—and weighs a ton. No, make that 835 tons. And she’s holding Baby Jesus in her right arm…\n\n…The sight is breathtaking, and beautiful, in a way I cannot even try to explain. I stare at them and think Okay, well maybe this is a good place to start a pilgrimage.\n\nI’m staying in a tiny studio on a cobbled road in the old part of town. The room is way up on the third floor. No elevators, of course. I drag my backpack and suitcase up the narrow, winding, very old cement staircase, which has a vague aroma of cat urine.\n\nThe studio seemed like the perfect location, but there is one hiccup. The French have this Camino thing working like a well-oiled machine. A minivan from a company called La Malle Postale will pick up my suitcase tomorrow morning and take it to the next place I’m staying, fifteen kilometers further down the trail. Of course, many pilgrims only carry a backpack for their long journey, but I have not signed up for torture, and evidently lots of other people feel the same way. But it was only after I’d paid for my lodging on Airbnb that I discovered one minor inconvenience: La Malle Postale does not pick up bags from Airbnbs, but only from hotels and hostels specifically registered as part of the Camino.\n\nI groan, thinking of the early morning run I’ll have to make across town tomorrow morning to deposit the suitcase at the acceptable spot, and let the backpack slip from my shoulders onto the wooden floor. I need a cup of tea. A strong cup of tea. It is two in the afternoon in France, and I’ve been up for twenty-four hours straight….\n\n…It’s only three p.m. Instead of going back to the train station, I’m free to walk around the old part of town, take photos, and admire the statue of Mary and Jesus from every angle. Then I decide to walk to the cathedral, an immense structure built over the period of some ten centuries, the fifth to the fifteenth, so I’ve read. That’s old.\n\nThe short hike from my studio to the cathedral goes up and up and up a sharp incline. I walk along the cobblestones, noting a few cozy restaurants and tourist shops lining the narrow road. The cathedral’s façade, striped looking with alternating white and black stones, is imposing, almost intimidating, towering over me with its three massive levels of stonework. The bottom layer—my destination—is the cathedral’s porch with its arched arcades. I stand, already out of breath, at the bottom of the sixty steps.\n\nGood grief, we pilgrims will be worn out before we ever start our journey if we have to climb up here with our backpacks!\n\nBut for today I’m unencumbered, so I walk up and up and up all those steps. It’s worth the view from the top, though, as I turn around and look past the alcove and the vaulted openings to the whole valley below.\n\nI enter the church, dark, majestic, and very gothic, demanding reverence. I stand there for a few minutes, letting my eyes adjust. Then I look up and ahead of me at the painted cupola with its black virgin. I feel chills. An elderly couple enter, genuflect, and cross themselves, Catholic style. After a few minutes of silent contemplation, during which I am still hearing too much noise in my mind, I pass through the cathedral bookstore, where I have read all pilgrims must go to get their “passport.” It’s called a créanciale, and is a folded booklet that pilgrims get stamped at each place they stay. A proof of their pilgrimage, I guess. The suggested donation is five euros. I get one for Bobby, Rasa, and Caroline too, and leave the enthusiastic cashier thirty euros.\n\n“Merci, Monsieur.”\n\nHe rewards me by answering in French. “Je vous en prie, Madame.” Then he adds, in English, “Do you know about the welcome meeting later today?”\n\nIn fact, I do. I’ve saved a thread from a Camino forum on my phone that talks about this as well as the early morning Mass: There is a friendly group of Friends of the Camino in Le Puy who welcome new pilgrims. They meet every evening between April and October starting at 5:30 p.m. at 2 Rue de Manécantare.\n\nEvery day at 7 a.m. there is a Mass in the Cathedral with the Pilgrim’s Blessing at the end. It is rather nice to start your Camino experience leaving from the Cathedral with the other pilgrims, through the old streets.\n\nFor now, I leave the cathedral alone and wander around town, up and down, up and down. I could walk up to the top of the Corneille Rock, where the view is surely amazing, but I decide to save my strength for the start of the hike tomorrow.\n\nLate in the afternoon, as the sun is descending, gleaming off of Mary as if she’s on fire, I make my way behind the massive cathedral to the little street, rue de Manécantare, where I find a door marked Camino and Acceuil. Welcome. I step inside the room and find a group of pilgrims seated around a table on which sit little glasses and a pitcher filled with what an American would assume is weak Kool-Aid. Not at all. It’s a kir—white wine with crème de cassis added. The French! Welcoming pilgrims from around the world with a glass of wine!\n\nI pass on the kir and settle into a chair while the group leader, a fiftysomething man named Laurent, launches into an animated discussion of all the wonders of the Camino, alternating between French and English as he talks. He doesn’t mention anything religious exactly, although he admits this pilgrimage can be “very spiritual.” He’s walked all 1200 kilometers from right here in Le Puy to the end of the Camino on the furthest western piece of land in Spain. According to Laurent, the place, Finisterre, literally means the end of the world.\n\nTwenty of us are present: ten Germans, two young men from Italy, a father-son team who are French, a young Polish man, and four American women who look to be about my age.\n\nWe go around the room, sharing where we’re from and how far we hope to walk.\n\nThe young man has already been walking for two months, from his home in Poland, and he’s going to walk two more months at least until he gets to Finisterre. Alone.\n\nThe women are from Washington State. They are planning to walk the Via Podiensis, the part of the pilgrimage starting in Le Puy and ending at a picturesque village called Conques, two hundred kilometers further south in France. It’s the same path that Bobby and Rasa and I are planning to take. And Caroline, I remind myself. Maybe. I’ve calculated the length as 125 miles.\n\nWhen it’s my turn to share, I say, “Hi, I’m Abbie. I’m from Atlanta, Georgia, in the southeast of the United States. I’m walking with my son and his friend, but I just heard today that his friend is sick, so they aren’t joining me until I get to Monistrol.” I give a nervous laugh. “So I guess I’ll be alone for these first few days.”\n\nLaurent leans over from where he’s sitting, eyes dancing. “Abbie,” he says, and his accent is strong and clear. “This is what is so beautiful about the Camino. You are never alone.”\n\nI think he may launch into something about God being with us, but instead he says, “You will find many, many friends on the Camino. I guarantee it.”\n\nAs we leave the welcome center, one of the women comes over to me. “Hi, I’m Jamie. That’s a bummer about your son’s friend.”\n\n“Well, it’s a disappointment, for sure. And especially for them. But”—and I turn up my palms—“Laurent says I won’t be alone. That’s good to know.”\n\nShe chuckles. “Indeed.” Then, “Abbie, would you like to join us for dinner?”\n\n“Oh, no. I don’t want to bother you all.”\n\n“No bother! We’re all pilgrims, right?”\n\n“Well then, sure! Thanks!”\n\nThese women, Jamie, Brenda, Barbara, and Lynn, each give me a big smile and a welcome. Then Lynn adds, “Let’s go ring the bell for good luck on our pilgrimage!”\n\nWe head out into a garden that adjoins the building, where I immediately spy the large bell that I’ve read about on the forum. Each of us rings it, recording the photo on our smart phones. I take a deep breath and say a silent prayer, “Thank You, Lord, for these women. I really didn’t look forward to being alone tonight.”\n\n…\n\nThe evening is progressing well. Bobby has texted to make sure I’m okay. By the time we leave the restaurant, it is after nine and I am wiped out.\n\n“Will we see you at Mass tomorrow morning, Abbie?” Jamie calls after me.\n\n“Yes, of course. I’ll be there bright and early.”\n\n“Why don’t you come back afterwards and have breakfast with us at our hotel—it’s delicious. Homemade jellies, cheeses from the region, yogurts, and of course, French bread. And fresh fruits. I’ve already checked with the host, and he says it’s fine. We need to start out with a big breakfast if we’re going to make it.”\n\n“Thanks, girls. You’ve been so kind. I’d love to join you tomorrow morning.”\n\nAs I head to my little studio, I can almost hear Laurent whispering, “You’re never alone on the Camino, Abbie.” I guess he’s right."
