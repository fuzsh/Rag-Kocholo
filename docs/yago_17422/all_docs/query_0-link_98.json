Exploring her last known location, Jamie stumbles upon an urgent letter from his missing wife promising to explain her sudden departure and her current whereabouts. There’s just one catch. Her confessions are disclosed in a series of letters she’s left hidden along the ancient Camino trail across northern Spain. Now armed with a list of clues to track down the letters, Jamie retraces Pam’s footsteps, while being both entertained and challenged by the many colorful Camino characters he meets along the way. This includes the enchanting Brie, who harbors her own secrets that just might compromise Jamie’s intended reunion with his wife."
