Real Oviedo Vetusta Jaime VÃ¡zquez has been named in Spain's Under-18 squad for the two friendly matches against Switzerland which will be played next week.

The call-up is a deserved reward for the centre back, who has become a permanent fixture at the heart of the B-team defence, and who has been named in the first-team squad on 14 occasions. He made his first-team debut against Amorebieta in Matchday 22 of LaLiga Hypermotion, putting in a fine performance.
