        "text": "Five grisly tales from a kid's comic book about a murdered father rising from his grave, a bizarre meteor, a vengeful husband, a mysterious crate's occupant, and a plague of cockroaches.\n\nThree macabre tales from the latest issue of a boy's favorite comic book, dealing with a vengeful wooden Native American, a monstrous blob in a lake, and an undying hitchhiker.\n\nTo stall a witch plotting to eat him, a boy reads her horror tales dealing with a collegian's resurrection of a mummy, a murderous cat, and an artist's pact with a gargoyle.\n\nFive passengers in a bus depot are waiting for a bus that is overdue. To pass the time, they start telling each other horror stories.\n\nA harmless backyard camp out becomes an unforgettable night of chills and thrills for three young boys as they share their favorite scary stories.\n\n\"Terrorgram\" was an anthology of three horror stories linked by a sinister delivery boy. The stories are \"Heroine Overdose\", \"Pandora\" and \"Veteran's Day\".\n\nA writer of horror stories is invited to a \"monster club\" by a mysterious old gentleman. There, three gruesome stories are told to him; between each story some musicians play their songs.\n\nA trilogy of three improbable stories of horror and the supernatural are combined into this low budget thriller: \"That's the Way to Do It,\" \"Dreamhouse,,\" and \"Do You Believe in Fairies?\"\n\nFour horror and science fiction segments, directed by four famous directors, each of them being a new version of a classic story from Rod Serling's landmark television series.\n\n\"Night Train to Terror\" is a 1985 horror anthology movie where God and Satan are on a train discussing the fate of three individuals.\n\n\"Tales of the Third Dimension\" was a 1984 hosted horror anthology 3-D movie; with the skeleton \"Igor\" as host. The movie has three scary tales.\n\n\"Deadtime Stories\" is a 1986 horror anthology, where a babysitting uncle tells his nephew three horror stories about killer witches, Little Red Riding Hood and a werewolf, and \"Goldi Lox\" and the three bears.\n\nActress, Shirley L. Jones returns from director, Chester Novell Turner's first film, Black Devil Doll from Hell (1984), to star in director Turner's next camcorder opus. She reads 2 spooky tales to the ghost of her dead son, Bobby. The second story features a zombie clown from hell. This film's considered the holy grail of VHS tapes, as their were only appx 100 copies originally printed (now Massacre Video's recently released a pristine remastering). Along the way, Shirley,'s hot-headed boyfriend's killed, and there's a bloody finale.\n\nA college class, Psychology of Fear, has a new teacher who believes that you have to feel fear to understand it. A group of students convene at the teacher's house, where scary stories are told.\n\nFour strangers are summoned to the basement of a abandoned house by a mysterious entity known only as The Sentinel. One after another, they are forced to witness heinous deeds they have yet to commit - and which will damn them for all eternity.\n\n\"Grim Prairie Tales\" is a 1990 horror anthology movie where a cynical bounty hunter and a clerk traveling through the prairie rest by the campfire telling four stories of terror to each other.\n\nA duo of Edgar Allan Poe adaptations about a greedy wife's attempt to embezzle her dying husband's fortune, and a sleazy reporter's adoption of a strange black cat.\n\n\"Fright Show\" is a 1985 horror anthology, where two obscure film critics host four SF/Horror films: The Thing in the Basement, Illegal Alien, Nightfright, and Dr. Dobermind.\n\nA graveside visit turns out to be a never-ending nightmare for a grieving father. Restless spirits and ghastly visitations materialize in the cemetery as if to warn the man of some impending doom. The mystery is unlocked when a familiar apparition from the \"other side\" unknowingly appears and inadvertently curses him to an eternity in purgatory.\n\nThis is part of Strange Tales (1986) an unlistable Robert D. Weinbach VHS Anthology, along with \"A Day In The Life Of Snidley Carmichael: A Sadistic Comedy,\" \"Twilight Journey\" and \"The Crystal Quest\""
