From the game's\n\n\"Story\" page:\n\nOur story begins with the invasion of this fairy tale land by hordes of\n\nravenous zombies. And they won't stop at anything: from the succulent legs\n\nof ham of the Three Little Pigs to the sawdust brain of Pinnochio, they are\n\nall tasty morsels for the living dead. Grotesque aberrations plague the\n\nenchanted forests.\n\nPrince Charmings wake up Sleeping Beauties with real love bites and\n\nferocious wolves die with they attack abandoned little girls.\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood’s Zombie BBQ will be available on the Nintendo DS.\n\nThere's no release date yet.\n\nProduct Page [GammickEntertainment.com via Kotaku]:\n\nhttp://www.gammickentertainment.com/zombie/base.html"
