That total includes 0 digital editions (if I own both physical and digital editions of a particular game, it only counts once in the total provided for the relevant system). I may also specify whether I own boxes and inserts, such as instruction manuals and maps. Finally, an [R] next to a gametitle means I've reviewed it here.\n\nThanks for checking out my game list. Would you like to hear my thoughts about a game on the list above that I haven't yet had a chance to review? If so, let me know. Maybe I'll do it. On the other hand, I may ignore you completely. Sometimes, I can be mean like that."
