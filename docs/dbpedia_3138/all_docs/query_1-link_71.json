        "text": "welp, Halloween is coming up… And what better way to ring in the Holiday then by playing some good ol’ fashion zombie games. Here are a list of the ones you can find on current Nintendo consoles:\n\nWII\n\nRock of the Dead: it’s very reminiscent of Type of the Dead on the Sega Dreamcast. Undead shamble towards the screen while you press the right notes and the die… it can get very intense at higher difficulties\n\nDead Space Extraction: now, these guys are techinically zombies but some can argue they are not… whatever, this is my list. Light gun shooter. really good. really bloody\n\nHouse of the Dead: Overkill… Bloody light gun shooter. Tons and tons of zombies. Lots of cursing (for those of you who like that sort of thing) Weapon upgrading system.\n\nHouse of the Dead 2 & 3: these are the classic arcade shooter, now on the Wii. Nuff said\n\nDead Rising Chop Till You Drop: this is a port of the awesome game titled “Dead Rising”… pretty much the same game with a fraction of the zombies, new controls and not as good of graphics. Still a good game for those of you that only own a Wii…\n\nOnechanbara Bikini Zombie Slayers: don’t buy this game. It’s a terrible premise with terrible controls and terrible gameplay. Then again, if you are a risk taker, buy it.\n\nResident Evil Archives: the classic, amazing game. Looks a little better. Still has tank controls. But it’s all good\n\nResident Evil 4: ok, these monsters are Ganados, but this game deserves to be on this list. Best RE game and the best way to play it. Buy this, most definitely.\n\nResident Evil Umbrella Chronicle: pretty decent light gun shooter. If you want a great one though, stick with Dead Space\n\nRE Darkside Chronicles: a bit better than Umbrella Chronicles. It’s a pretty long game. Decent Graphics\n\nZombie Panic in Wonderland: this game is essentially Sin & Punishment with zombies. Pretty good downloadable game.\n\nZombie Ate My Neighbors: classic SNES game that you can download onto the Wii through the Wii-shop. It’s fun and funny.\n\nDS\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood Zombie BBQ: fun game. It’s kinda reminiscent of Zombie Panic in Wonderland. Challenging and fun\n\nTouch the Dead: Light gun shooter with a stylus. Just tap the brains. Watch the blood fly\n\nTeenage Zombies: don’t buy this. It just looks dumb. If you can convince me otherwise, be my guest…\n\nPlants vs. Zombies: the best handheld zombie game ever. Fun, addicting and challenging. Buy it\n\nResident Evil Dead Silence: worst version of this game…\n\nUndead Storm: Arcade top-down shooter. It’s decent in short spurts just like all these style games. Good stuff\n\n3DS\n\nZombie Slayer Diox: great great game… Rythm style game where you kill hundreds and hundreds of zombies. What’s not to love?\n\nPet Zombies: I guess this is supposed to be kinda like Nintendogs, but you have a zombie instead. Feed it, care for it, bathe it… whatever\n\nSo there you have it my undead loving friends… Go out and buy some of these and enjoy your Halloween season XD"
