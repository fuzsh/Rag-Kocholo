It was extra special to see Red Gretchen again after an over two year hiatus. .\n\n11-25-18\n\nThe Knitting Factory\n\nBrooklyn, NY\n\nwith The Mighty Barley Brothers and a bunch of other acts. Great venue, great sound system.\n\n11-9-18\n\n4 Days of Wood; Day 3\n\nThe Delancey\n\nNY, NY\n\nWith Capitol Offender, Pretty Goats and Mora Tau. We’ve been playing the celebration of Frank Wood’s birthday for a number of years and this year was no different except for the fact that Emma wasn’t there fronting us. Just the four boys made up Crazy Mary this time with each except Nick sharing vocal duties.\n\n11-4-18\n\nNYC Marathon\n\nCorner of 84th and 1st\n\nNY, NY\n\nAnother 4 1/2 hours of continuous playing featured 46 different songs including some more new ones and the debut of You Know She Can’t Dance, 4 covers, three of which were Stones songs, and one drone made up on the spot. This year it was only Charles, Nick, Walter and The Wizard playing. It’s always a rewarding experience playing for the runners and crowd.\n\n10-31-18\n\nSidewalk NYC\n\nNY, NY\n\nWith Rome 56, Magic Forest, Don BlackCat and Friends an The Alan Merrill Extravaganza. First gig in four months for Crazy Mary. Emma was not there but Robert Aaron on tenor and Mac Gollehon on trumpet were. We’d been working on new songs so so we debuted Walter’s Soldiers and I Need You Now and played an instrumental version of The Ends Justifies The Means (because the lyrics aren’t written yet). The boys took turns singing as would be the case for the following few gigs.\n\n7-1-18\n\nOtto’s Shrunken Head\n\nNY, NY\n\nWith Don BlackCat & Friends, Cheri Dahl and Shane Morrison. The finale of a six show whirlwind of shows in London and New York over the past six weeks found Crazy Mary in peak form. Everything came together for this show and we were all very pleased with the sound of the performance. With no band playing after us we extended the set to 18 songs and just had some fun with it as it will be our last show with Emma till sometime next year as she goes on maternity leave.\n\n6-23-18\n\nSidewalk NYC\n\nNY, NY\n\nWith Marc Hayward, Janturan, The Rousers, The Cynz and Don BlackCat and Friends.

The night had the kind of party atmosphere that happens when lots of old friends gather.\n\n6-13-18\n\nAltas Public House\n\nJersey City, NJ\n\nWith Joey Kelly and Jimmy McElligott and Rome 56. Crazy Mary stripped down for this one and it was loads of fun.

Although Emma is still in Australia the band was joined for the first time in 18 years by founding member Richard Morbid who did a stunning rendition of Johnny Thunders which appears on our first album, and Sophia Jackson who was our vocalist from 1999 to 2003 who joined us for 4 songs including two songs we haven’t played since Emma joined the band, Monkey Magic Medicine and Invisible.

AHPresents specifically Anne Husick organized another great lineup and packed Sidewalk for the year’s finale. Crazy Mary tore up the joint, but how could we not with Mac Gollehon joining us on trumpet and Robert Aaron on tenor. It’s such an honor to play with such talented musicians. As Cray Mary enters its 20th year who knows where the wind will blow us.\n\n12-16-17\n\nSidewalk NYC\n\nNY, NY\n\nWith Exit 99, Danny’s Devil’s Blues and The Love Pirates. Another great night organized by Anne Husick of AHPresnts, this being focused on the semi annual return of our friend Danny Biondo from Japan to play with his band, Danny’s Devil’s Blues. We played tons of shows with them before Danny moved so it was great to reunite. Crazy Mary were joined by Robert Aaron and Mac Gollehon, giving us a horn section few can compare to. So much fun.\n\n11-30-17\n\nVideo Release Party Wrong Place at the Wrong Time\n\nThe Delancey\n\nNY, NY\n\nWith The Cuts and Skulk The Hulking.

Great gig. We got to celebrate both Frank Wood and Rober Aaron’s birthdays. Johnny Young who was playing before Crazy Mary with The All Stars and after us solo asked to keep his keyboard set up. I agreed if he would also play with us which he happily did (Johnny guested on Crazy Mary’s last studio recording). Turned into an amazing, fun gig.\n\n11-5-17\n\nTCS 2017 NYC Marathon\n\nCorner of 84th Street and First Avenue\n\nNY, NY\n\nOur fifth marathon in a row was just as rewarding as the previous four, We played straight from 10:15 AM to 3:30 PM, playing 40 different songs, some twice a few three times. We also wrote a couple of new ones on the spot. So much fun\n\n10-29-17\n\nOtto’s Shrunken Head\n\nNY, NY\n\nWith The Roaches,Pretty Goats and Mora Tao. Despite the pouring rain this was another fun gig featuring the core five members of the band. Our friends Sean and Sara of Mora Tao’s car broke down and to make things worse they were carrying guitarist Ronnie’s gear. No problem; he borrowed Rick’s guitar and my effect pedal and he and Shauna played a wonderful set.\n\n9-30-17\n\nAnne Husick’s Annual Libra Birthday Bash\n\nSidewalk NYC\n\nNY, NY\n\nWith Don Blackcat Sztabnik and Friends,Exit 99, JOff Wilson and Friends and The Alan Merrill Extravaganza.

So many great London bands including Pink Cigar who Emma saw when they played New York and started the whole idea of going to London.

I love getting to see bands I haven’t before and Fuzzqueen from Silver Spring, MD were great. Eve Blackwater, playing without her backing band had a voice so powerful, it shook the room.

We all headed into this gig with post election depression, all dressed in black like we were going to a funeral. That feeling permeated to whole bar, but everyone was ready to experience the healing power of music. Walter was home with family so Chuckie “Raven” Hancock filled in with his sax. Red Gretchen started the evening with a beautiful ,delicate set of rarely played slow tunes setting the tone for the night. I must say Cray Mary’s playing was inspiring, slowing songs down ever so slightly till they created a perfect groove. Chuckie’s playing inspired the band as well.\n\n11-6-16\n\nTCS New York City Marathon\n\nCorner 84th & 1st (mile 17)\n\nNY, NY\n\nOur fourth Marathon started with a beautiful day and warm temperatures like the year before.

We got tons of complements and scores of people photographing either Emma or the rest of the band.\n\n10-28-16\n\nMap Room at Bowery Electric\n\nNY, NY\n\nWith Gotham Rockets and Seth Okrend.\n\n10-16-16\n\nThe Keith Richards Festival\n\nBizarre Bushwick\n\nBrooklyn, NY\n\nWith Snake Monsters, Hell In The Hallway, Shel Stewart And The Messengers and Rick’s Jet’s.

The night was a celebration for several people’s birthday’s Jen Elliott, Alan Rand and Harold C Black and what an amazing night it was. I’ve never seen Sidewalk as packed as it should be for a lineup like this. Normally I’d be a little nervous playing right after a member of the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame but Crazy Mary didn’t disappoint after Ricky Byrd, delivering a blistering show which for the first time featured a majority of tunes from our yet to be titled new recording, including the debut of Hippy Farm.\n\n11-19-15\n\nBowery Electric Map Room\n\nNY, NY\n\nWith Michael McHugh and Sonic Art\n\n11-8-15\n\n7 Days of Wood; Day 3\n\nOtto’s Shrunken Head\n\nNY, NY\n\nWith Commercial Interruption, The Carvels, The Phil Gammage Quartet, The Hipp Pipps and Puma Perl and Friends.

He really dug it.\n\n1-30-15\n\nNYC Women Who Rock\n\nSidewalk NYC\n\nNY, NY\n\nWith Valor, The Rewd Onez. Blueberry High Heels, Anne Husick, Phyllis R.

Well this was our 30th and final gig of the year and we may have saved the best for last. Meridian 23 is a wonderful sounding room with a great sound system and a talented sound guy. We could hear ourselves and each other so well on stage that it brought our tightness to another level. People who had seen us at other venues were dually impressed. It was our first gig with both Los Latharios and Bad Faces both of whom were great bands with a lot of talented musicians. It was a great way to close out the year.\n\n12-20-14\n\nPatty Cakes Gildea Birthday Bash\n\nSidewalk NYC\n\nNY, NY\n\nWith Alan Merrill, The Anne Husick Trio, Ricky Byrd, Love Pirates, The Cynz and Snake Monster. A funny thing happened a week before this gig. Joan Jett And The Blackhearts were announced as 2015 inductees into The Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame and their guitarist, Ricky Byrd as well as the author of The Blackhearts most famous song, I Love Rock And Roll, Alan Merrill, were both on the bill to perform for our friend Patty Cakes Gildea. So we ended up with a historical moment when Ricky joined Alan on stage for a heartwarming rendition of that tune. Gives me goosebumps thinking about it. Crazy Mary was joined by Rick Eckerle for our last few numbers who brought color to our set with his lap steal and Gretsch White Falcon. The night had many great highlights such as when Nick joined Snake Monster on stage to sing wearing the pink tutu he was supposed to have on when he popped out of a cake for Patty, on his head instead.\n\n12-7-14\n\nAlan Rand Pre Birthday Bash\n\nOtto’s Shrunken Head\n\nNY, NY\n\nWith Gusher, The Rewd Onez and Danny’s Devil’s Blues. Oh boy, we’re having too much. Playing at 7:00 we didn’t think too many people would be at this show and seemed to be the case as we started the set, but when we were playing our second song I looked up and the place was packed. Everyone had showed up to see Crazy Mary and Crazy Many did not disappoint, delivering a blistering set that had the crowd dancing. The Rewd Onez and Danny’s Devil’s Blues kept up the energy and it was fun watching Alan Rand blow out the candles on his cake.\n\n11-30-14\n\nEmma Z Birthday Bash\n\nOtto’s Shrunken Head\n\nNY, NY\n\nWith Stronger Than Some, Adios Mafia, Blueberry High Heels and Kid Lucky.

Doesn’t get any better than that.\n\n11-21-14\n\nMap Room at Bowery Electric\n\nNY, NY\n\nWith The Alan Merrill Band and The Hipp Pipps. This was one of my favorite gigs this year. The band was really tight and the crowd danced all evening. It was our first gig with The Alan Merrill Band who revved the audience up right away and had them smoking when he closed with “I Love Rock And Roll” which he wrote in the 70’s. Crazy Mary fed off the fervor and had the crowd bopping. Then The Hipp Pipps kept the energy going with an electric set.\n\n11-15-14\n\nAlan Rand Appreciation Night\n\nSidewalk NYC\n\nNY, NY\n\nWith Billy Magee, The Hipp Pipps, The Rewd Onez (featuring Bill Fica of Television on drums), Puma Perl And Friends and Red Gretchen. It was a fabulous evening organized by Anne Husick of AH Presents and Red Gretchen that honored photographer extraordinaire, Alan Rand who also produced and recorded the new Red Gretchen CD. Crazy Mary really hit a groove for this show. So many people came up to me and complemented me after the show. They were mesmerized, so much in fact that Didi Delicious wrapped Emma’s discarded petticoat around her head and joined us on stage during Land Of Jagged Mountains to sing backup vocals. We also enjoyed getting down to P Funk after the show.\n\n11-5-14\n\nInternational Pop Overthrow Festival\n\nBar Matchless\n\nBrooklyn, NY\n\nWith Matthew Pop, Andy Mac, Freddy Monday, The Kennedys & The Sharp Things. Despite not having Walter Steding this evening Crazy Mary did not disappoint. Tight from our long NY Marathon gig the previous Sunday we belted the crowd with some lesser played songs to their enthusiastic response.\n\n11-2-14\n\nNew York City Marathon\n\nBrooklyn, NY\n\nWith temperatures in the 40s and a strong wind, playing for 4 1/2 hours with no break was a challenge but the reward of inspiring the 50,000 runners at the halfway point in the race to continue more than made up for our physical limitations. We played well over 50 songs in total and over 30 different tunes (yes we did repeat some). Emma was amazing engaging the runners, many who stopped to slap her hand or take our picture. Hand numbness and cramps aside we all made it through although it felt like we ran the race as well. It’s such an amazing feeling to be part of this monumental event and I hope we can participate every year.\n\n10-18-14\n\nThe Delancey\n\nNY, NY\n\nWith The Grasping Straws The Rock ‘N’ Roll Johnny Band and Decibel Joe and The Distressed Parents Band.

This gig was the 40th anniversary of Frank Wood booking bands and it was such a fun evening.

Later we had pizza with Bob Spring (super nice guy) who is touring the States from Switzerland.\n\n9-20-14\n\nSidewalk NYC\n\nNY, NY\n\nwith Dennis Doyle, The Rebel Factory, The Rewd Onez, Red Gretchen, Danny’s Devil’s Blues and Val Kinzler.

It was great playing after a month long hiatus and seeing and playing with so many friends and fans was truly warming.\n\n8-22-14\n\nFontanas\n\nNY, NY\n\nwith Jennie Vee, Jana Peri, The PrimaDonna Reeds, Rew Starr\n\n7-26-14\n\nThe Ding Dong Lounge\n\nNY, NY\n\nWe had just found out that The Ding Dong Lounge was about to close in its current location, and although we had never played there before, there a a sense of remorse. Instead of pouting, we decided to send the last Saturday of live music out with a bang. The place started filling up shortly before we played and kept getting more crowded through the Cynz and Rebel Factory sets. It was great seeing so many familiar faces in the audience as well as some new ones. Everyone in the band could hear themselves well, and I think we delivered a hard driving show. It was great to see the Cynz again and they did not disappoint. Rebel Factory were also great even though they were missing Phil Gammage. Don Fiorino added some tasty lap steel.\n\n6-21-14\n\nSidewalk NYC\n\nNY, NY\n\nWith Blue Moon Agnostics, Au-Ralphy, Blueberry High Heels, Granny, The Hipp Pipps and Red Gretchen. Everyone was in a good mood for the Summer Solstice and the beginning of Summer, so the crowd was all too pleased to cut loose on the dancefloor for The Hipp Pipps. Red Gretchen hypnotized the audience with their psychedelic grooves so they were already warmed up when Crazy Mary took the stage. Overall it was a really enjoyable night.\n\n6-4-14\n\nFundraiser For Robert Aaron\n\nR Bar\n\nNY, NY\n\nWith The Robert Aaron All-Star Band feat.

It doesn’t happen often that you get to play Las Vegas and NYC within a week, and this show really kicked ass. This was an opportunity for fellow musicians to help Robert whose been a fixture in the NYC scene for over 30 years and is one of the finest musicians I know. The night was as magical as the smile on Robert’s face. A personal highlight was James Chance’s set which featured heavy funk grooves and the best trombonist I’ve ever seen in Joseph Bowie. It was simply a great experience of which Crazy Mary was proud to be part.\n\n5-31-14\n\nThe Double Down Saloon\n\nLas Vegas, Nevada\n\nWith Lords Of The Damned, Bounty Hunter Bros., Strange Mistress, Wax Pig Melting and Headwinds. Well we finally made our much anticipated journey to Las Vegas with Frank Wood it it did not disappoint. We were originally going to play with the Vermin on featuring Dirk Vermin and Rob Ruckus of A&E TV’s Bad Ink, but they had to cancel because Dirk had a medical emergency. Nonetheless Ruckus, The Double Down’s owner, Moss, and many others were fantastic hosts and made us feel welcome and at home. We were at The Double Down the previous night watching the amazing Dirty Panties whom Frank had booked in New York. When Crazy Mary played, we were greeted by a warm reception. Midway into our set we brought Frank up to sing We Gotta Get Out Of This Place, Little Red Riding Hood, Candy and Jiggle Butt and he got the crowd warmed up for the end of our set. When we finished we were treated to a round of drinks by Ruckus. All in all it was a really good time and we can’t wait to go back and play with the Vermin when they’re back in action.\n\n5-16-14\n\nWomen Committed To Rock And Roll\n\nParkside Lounge\n\nNY, NY\n\nWith Blueberry High Heels, Jana Peri, SWORDSHA, PM Edition, Puma Perl and Friends,E J PROWL, The Purslaines, Battle Maiden.

Tonight was so much fun, playing with some of our favorite bands, The Cynz, The Hipp Pipps, Frank Wood and His NYC Allstars, Danny’s Devil Blues and Puma Perl and Friends. The highlight for the band was having Phil Gammage play some harp on That Same Old Feel Once Again and Another Dollar. These shows have been both well attended and well received. Walter and Charles ended the evening jamming with Joff Wilson in The Sofa King Wild Jam. Most importantly, Phyllis had a great time at her party.\n\n3-16-14\n\nCharles Kibel’s Birthday Bash\n\nOtto’s Shrunken Head\n\nNY, NY\n\nI’m truly touched by the great attendance to my birthday show.
