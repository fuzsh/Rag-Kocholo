        "text": "Introduction\n\nVideo games have often drawn criticism for stereotypical depictions of women as passive partners for the (male) protagonist in such situations as the cliché “save the princess” scenario or as sex objects present primarily for the gratification of a male audience (e.g., Provenzo, 1991). Studies completed on video games sold in the US have shown that female characters are not given representation equal to male characters in video games and are often created from a male perspective that is less than “realistic,” exaggerating their sexual or feminine traits (e.g., Beasley & Collins Standley, 2002; Burgess, Stermer & Burgess, 2007; Downs & Smith, 2010; Martins, Williams, Harrison & Ratan, 2009; Williams, Martins, Consalvo & Ivory, 2009). Lara Croft of Tomb Raider fame, to use an obvious example, may be an active protagonist and capable adventurer and gunslinger, but she also exhibits the oversized breasts and unusually thin build of a Barbie doll rather than the muscular physique an equivalent male character would have (Jansz & Martis, 2007). These depictions in video games potentially influence the socialization of young people, who make up a large part of their audience, and thus may transform or reproduce gender representations in the general culture (Downs & Smith, 2010). To date, research has focused on describing depictions of women and men in all video games, not how these depictions influence sales and, in turn, audience exposure to particular depictions (Williams et al., 2009). This study uses a different tactic, assessing which depictions of video game characters are associated with higher game sales, under the assumption that only best-selling games have much impact on general culture. That is, the focus here is on game sales as the outcome variable, with depiction of female and male characters as the antecedent variables.\n\nAt a simplistic level it might be assumed that sexualized representations of women are used in video games because such depictions increase game sales. Similarly, it might be assumed that female characters are usually cast in supporting rather than central roles while male characters take central roles because the predominantly male audience is better able to identify with a male protagonist, incentivizing the use of a male protagonist. Since best-selling games reflect both the average cultural preferences of gamers and the content that is most widely available for producing gender socialization (e.g., Williams et al., 2009), it is important to test the conditions under which gender representation predicts game sales. This study attempts to do just that by relating video game sales data to a content analysis of the representations of men and women on the box art for the same games. The research question explored here is whether particular depictions of female (and male) characters on game box art, specifically the presence, centrality, and sexualization of female characters and the presence and centrality of male characters, are related to sales. I posit that associations between game sales and their box art representations of men and women result from differentially valued gender coding rather than sexualization or identification per se. In short, it is expected that “sex sells,” but only when the sexualized women portrayed are also depicted as marginalized, consistent with a gender coding of the game that fits cultural stereotypes (Kimmel, 2008). In this view, the success of Lara Croft was anomalous, as she was depicted as a central (albeit highly sexualized) female protagonist in the box art for Tomb Raider.\n\nThis study focuses on box art for games sold in the US (as do the studies cited below, unless otherwise noted), but often similar box art is used in the games sold in other markets as well; the US game industry—one of the largest—has a huge influence on games published all over the world and indirectly influences culture outside the US. Video games are truly an international product that crosses national borders with little hindrance, with the possible exception of a few countries that censor for political or religious reasons. Compared to other cultural artifacts, many of the highest selling video games are truly global in their reach, even though the producing firms are often headquartered in just a few geographic areas (e.g., the US, Canada, Japan, Europe, and Australia).\n\nThis study also uses a purposive sample of games that received an ESRB rating of T or Teen (age 13+) or M for Mature (age 17+), a subset of games that are most often targeted at young males and are the most likely to feature sexualized women. Findings from this sample would not generalize to all games, for reasons noted below, but only to those aimed at young males, where the marginalization and sexualization of female characters would signal the masculine gendering of the game space (Kimmel, 2008; Ward Gailey, 1993).\n\nRepresentation of Women and Men in Video Games\n\nThe portrayal of men and women in video games has been investigated with both qualitative research and quantitative research. Several studies provided qualitative analyses of specific images (Fontane, 2003; Herbst, 2005; Labre & Duke, 2004; Mikula, 2003). Others examined the reactions of female gamers to the gendering of video gaming and video game characters (e.g., Bryce & Rutter, 2003).\n\nOf the quantitative studies of the representation of female characters in video games, most have used content analysis to examine gender roles, as recommended by Rudy, Popova and Linz (2010, 2011) in their introduction to two special issues of Sex Roles. These have produced consistent results, showing that women are underrepresented relative to men and are more likely to be depicted in sexualized and passive roles, as described below. An early study showed that the most popular Nintendo games of the time often placed female characters in either a passive, helpless role as a “damsel in distress” motivating the actions of the male protagonist or a negatively-valued, sexualized role as a “bad girl” minor antagonist (Provenzo, 1991, 1992). A few years later, Dietz (1998) found no female characters at all in a third of games viewed. More recently females represented a small proportion of all characters in the games sampled (Beasley & Collins Standley, 2002; Burgess et al, 2007; Downs & Smith, 2010; Williams et al., 2009) and fewer than half of all characters depicted in ads in major gaming magazines (Scharrer, 2004).\n\nPlayable female characters (i.e., those characters that could be selected as one’s avatar and actively played) were also in the minority. Half of the female characters in a content analysis of game play videos were playable (Haninger & Thompson, 2004) and a fifth of female characters in a content analysis of game reviews were playable and therefore active rather than passive (Ivory, 2006).\n\nFinally, female characters were more likely than male characters to be depicted as sex objects (Dietz, 1998), sexier (Burgess et al., 2007), more attractive (Scharrer, 2004) or in ways that were sexually suggestive (Ivory, 2006). When female characters were pictured as dominant they also were more likely to be portrayed as hypersexualized (Jansz & Martis, 2007). In a recent study (Downs & Smith, 2010), most of the women either wore revealing clothing or were at least partially nude. Earlier studies similarly noted revealing clothing (Miller & Summers, 2007) and partial nudity (Heintz-Knowles & Henderson, 2001) among female characters. Measurement of their body proportions suggested that female characters in games aimed at older players were thinner than adult females in the US (Martins et al., 2009); in contrast, male characters in those games were proportional to actual sizes of adult US males (Martins, Williams, Ratan & Harrison, 2011).\n\nNevertheless, there is some heterogeneity of gender representation in games by genre and target audience. For instance, in so-called “casual games” aimed at female players and played on smart phones or in short periods of time (e.g., 3–5 minutes), more than half of the main characters were women (Wohn, 2011). Similarly, games aimed at children (which usually receive ESRB ratings of E, for Everyone) are less likely to sexualize female characters than games aimed at teens and adult men (Wohn, 2011).\n\nThe Importance of Video Game Representations\n\nPotential effects of video games on consumers have received attention in both the popular press and empirical research, especially with regard to the effects of video game violence on children (e.g., Haninger & Thompson, 2004). There is similar concern about the effects of the representation of women in video games because game characters often serve as role models, especially to young children (Miller & Summers, 2007). Children may build their gender identities, roles and schemas in part on their observation of characters in video games and through their symbolic interaction with these roles (Dietz, 1998; Beasley & Collins Standley, 2002; Collins, 2011), just as Goffman (1979) suggested for consumers of magazine ads. Children who see female characters portrayed as attractive and sexy and male characters portrayed as muscular and strong may experience low self-esteem when their own bodies do not meet those expectations (Miller & Summers, 2007) and may mimic gender behavior seen in games that is inappropriate in actual social situations (Beasley & Collins Standley, 2002; Downs & Smith, 2010).\n\nWhat has not been empirically examined is the effect of these images on purchasing behavior, which in turn affects consumers’ exposure to the images. Many variables influence video game purchase decisions, such as magazine and online game reviews, magazine, television and online ads, word of mouth from friends, and box art. Of these, box art (the ads depicting game scenes on the front of the video game box) is the only content to which nearly all buyers and potential buyers are exposed (Burgess et al., 2007), and thus seems the most likely to widely influence sales; most games are bought new and even buyers of used games usually receive the box. In addition, game producers presumably design these ads to influence purchase decisions; they have less control over reviews and over other ads, which are likely seen by a much smaller percentage of the target buyer group. Finally, studies of the effects of packaging indicate that consumers pay more attention to product imagery (e.g., a picture of the product) on the package when consumers have little familiarity with the brand or the product or when the product is “experiential” or provides “sensory pleasure, variety, and cognitive stimulation” (Underwood, Klein & Burke, 2001, p. 407). Video games are unknown products offering experiential benefits, so the use of pictures is particularly likely to draw consumer attention and encourage purchase.\n\nThe goal of this study is to provide an examination of the relationship between box art and game sales using content analysis of the box art and controlling for the associations of reviews and other game characteristics with sales. The game box provides a clear point of contact with the consumer and an obvious place to try to advertise the product and influence buying behavior. In the same way that consumers read the cereal box in order to make a choice, they peruse the video game box (either online or in a store) in order to learn about the game content. In both cases, the content is meant to influence purchase behavior, not to represent the full range of product characteristics; it is intended to convey the overall flavor of the game and emphasize content the producer believes will attract buyers, not to portray all characters in the game or all events likely to happen (Burgess et al., 2007). Thus, content analysis of box art is an appropriate method for interpreting the marketing used by producers in order to assess its effect on subsequent buyer behavior (i.e., sales).\n\nBuyer behavior is important because it provides an indication of the relationship between video games and the larger culture. When representations of characters were investigated over a twelve month period, male characters were found to outnumber female characters but the effect was even more pronounced in the highest-selling games (Williams et al., 2009). It is not clear whether games feature dominant men and sexualized women because this is what game producers tend to create or because this is what their audience demands (Williams et al., 2009). However, games with high sales can influence a greater number of people than those with low sales. As Williams et al. (2009) noted, in their sample a few games sold millions of copies while most sold only a few thousand copies; they concluded that those games selling more copies would probably exert greater influence on the behavior of players because they were played by far more people. Studies of the representation of men and women in a broad sample of video games may therefore provide a biased view of the effects of video games on the behavior of players, since most players do not see most games. Instead, focusing on representation of men and women in games with strong sales would provide a more accurate view of the potential effects of this portrayal on their audience (Williams et al., 2009). Following the recommendation of Williams and colleagues, in this study the relationship between portrayal and sales is examined empirically in order to assess how gender roles are depicted in those games seen by the largest audiences. This appears to be the first time that such an analysis has been undertaken, because earlier research assessed depiction of female characters in general, rather than the relationship between depiction of female characters and game sales, as reviewed above.\n\nTheoretical Frameworks for Explaining the Consequences of the Representation of Women\n\nGiven the importance and consistency of representations of men and women in video games, the question of why these conventions continue arises. The production of culture perspective (Peterson & Anand, 2004) offers a useful approach to examine this question. This theoretical framework examines the production and reception of cultural objects (e.g., video games) by considering the context of the producers, the consumers, and the general culture. In particular, Griswold (2008, p. 16) provides an analytical tool she terms the “cultural diamond,” a diagram in which the four points—the cultural object, its producer, its audience or receivers, and the social world—are each interconnected in determining what is produced and how it is received. Our particular concern in this paper is the link between producers and receivers.\n\nThe link between producers and receivers is a “filter” process (Hirsch, 1972), a succession of “gatekeepers,” including developers, publishers, retail outlets and reviewers, who determine whether a product is released and influence its success based on their decisions. Like the book publishing and media industries, the producers of the video game industry are split into developers, who do the creative work and production for games, and publishers, who market and distribute these games. Publishers are solely concerned with selecting games that they believe will be well-received by the audience and marketing them in a way that will encourage purchases (including box art design). Thus, if publishers believe that the marginalization or sexualization of women in games and their box art will improve sales to their target audience, they will emphasize such portrayals, and so the prevalence of these portrayals will persist.\n\nThe other set of gatekeepers of interest in this study is reviewers. While they cannot prevent a game’s release or guarantee its success, reviewers may hold considerable influence over consumer purchasing decisions, so they could be influential gatekeepers. In contrast to buyers, reviewers have played the game before they write their reviews, so reviewers’ decisions are influenced by the game play as well as the box art; thus, this study controls for review scores as a pathway through which game quality and community opinion may indirectly affect sales.\n\nHowever, it may not be specifically the presence of sexualized female characters that improves the reception of a game with sexualized women in the box art. Rather, the sexualization together with the marginalization of women is part of a convention (along with violent or aggressive game play and content) that genders video games as a masculine space (Jansz, 2005), and their presence reflects the masculine gendering of a game’s content (Kimmel, 2008). According to Kimmel (2008), it is in part because video games are usually gendered as a masculine-only space that they are attractive to males. Video games are one of the few spaces in which it is still conventional to overtly privilege males and assume a specifically masculine perspective. Thus, the absence of female characters or their depiction as sexualized and powerless help to maintain this gendered space, both by preserving an association between masculinity and privilege and by deterring “invasion” of the space by female players (Kimmel, 2008). As a result, producers of most games (with the exceptions of casual and children’s games) likely feel little pressure from their primary audience to change their portrayal of women, despite calls to reduce the “gendering” of video games and thereby attract more female players (e.g., Casell & Jenkins, 1998).\n\nIf box art serves the overall purpose of signaling that the game will provide a masculinized space for players then it would be expected that box art that provides the clearest signals will be associated with stronger game sales. As noted above, game sales is a proxy variable for measuring the extent of cultural influence of a particular game. Games with higher sales exert potentially greater influence on players because they are seen by more people than other games. This leads to specific hypotheses concerning both the presence and portrayal of male and female characters. It should be noted that all hypotheses pertain to that subsample of games aimed at adolescent and older players (i.e., Teen and Mature games); casual games designed primarily for women (Wohn, 2011) or children’s games designed for younger players (Martins et al., 2009, 2011) do not attempt to provide the gendered space seen in the subsample of games for older or mostly male players, and are therefore beyond the scope of this study.\n\nHypotheses\n\nThe previous research has demonstrated that women are underrepresented relative to men in video game play, in game reviews, in video game magazine ads, and in video game box art; further, they are often portrayed as highly sexualized and less central as characters, as reviewed above. The research question in this study is whether the images of women and men seen in box art predict the success of those games, measured here as game sales. Sales of games are important because they reflect how widespread the influence of particular games (and their gendered images) is on players, as Williams et al. (2009) note; but at the time of their study, sales figures by game were not easily available, so their sample of games was small and limited to the period of one year. Newly available data allow direct examination of the relationship between portrayals of male and female characters and game sales over the period of several years for a large sample.\n\nClearly video game sales are influenced by many variables other than the representation of male and female characters in box art. Control variables used in this study include year of publication, ESRB rating, review score, genre, system manufacturer and producer. Measures for each of these control variables are described in the Methods section. Because this is the first study of its kind to use sales as the dependent variable, earlier studies do not provide clear guidance as to the need for these controls so the rationale is explained below in some detail.\n\nYear of publication is controlled in this study because more recently published games will have had a shorter period of time in which to increase sales than will older games. ESRB rating is the industry content rating of each game that indicates its appropriate audience (e.g., young children vs. teens); in this study the sample is limited to games aimed at teens and mature adults, but even this classification may make a difference in sales, so whether the game is classified T for teens or M for mature adults is controlled. Genre of the game is controlled where feasible, because some genres (e.g., sports games) have greater sales than others aimed at smaller audiences (e.g., simulations). Review score is used to measure game quality and control for its influence on sales; review scores for games are available online through MetaCritic, a webpage that amalgamates review scores of games from multiple sources, thereby providing a resource widely used by gamers to learn about game quality prior to purchase. Game system manufacturer (e.g., Nintendo vs. Microsoft or Sony) is controlled because players may have one system and not another or may develop brand loyalty to one system manufacturer, limiting the selection of system-exclusive games available to them. Similarly, game publishing by a few notable publishers is controlled because some producers are more likely than others to produce high-selling games; larger firms or those with a good reputation are usually more successful than others in game sales (due to a reciprocal relationship between publisher characteristics and success). In other words, every attempt was made to control the effects of variables that would influence the dependent variable but have no relationship to the predictor variables so that the relationships of the predictor variables with the dependent variable could be more reliably assessed.\n\nAs noted above, previous research suggests that women are much less likely to be depicted in video games than are men. Theory suggests that this is because game producers aim to provide a product consistent with a masculinized space that will prove attractive to male gamers. Within the production of culture perspective (Peterson & Anand, 2004), it is argued that producers must provide cultural artifacts that fit the desires of the audience, at the same time as those artifacts also shape the desires of the audience. This theoretical framework provides a basis for understanding why female characters are less likely to be depicted in game box art than are male characters, especially under some conditions.\n\nThe first hypothesis is that the presence in the box art of female characters without male characters is negatively associated with game sales, since the exclusive presence of female characters threatens the masculine coding (Kimmel, 2008) of the product. Box art with any male characters or no characters present supports the default assumption that the game is masculine but box art with only female characters present compromises the “masculinity” of the game by implying that only women are important in the game. Thus:\n\nH1\n\nPresence of female characters alone in box art (i.e., absent other characters, either male or non-human) is negatively associated with game sales.\n\nNon-central women do not threaten the game’s coding as masculine (since men or even non-human objects such as cars are usually the central focus in such cases), but any indication that women are of sole or equal importance disrupts the assumption of a masculine-coded product. The presence of men as central characters, in contrast, reaffirms the masculine coding of the product. As discussed above, the masculine coding of the product (Jansz, 2005; Kimmel, 2008), shown through the ways in which men and women are depicted, is predicted to be associated with higher sales.\n\nH2\n\nIn box art that includes female characters, centrality of female characters is negatively associated with game sales.\n\nH3\n\nIn box art that includes female characters, centrality of male characters is positively associated with game sales.\n\nOn the other hand, the presence of non-central female characters in box art can reinforce a game’s coding as masculine if those characters are sexualized in a stereotypical way. Because the sexualized female characters are marginalized instead of strong and central, they do not represent a threat to the masculinized space of the game (Kimmel, 2008). In fact, the inclusion of non-central, sexualized women codes the product as specifically “for” men. However, sexualized women who are depicted as central to the action do not have the same effect; their implied agency still threatens the masculine coding of the product, and thus Hypothesis 2 applies to them. In other words, sexualization of women will be positively associated with game sales, but only in cases where the women portrayed are not in a central position on the box. This prediction is consistent with Kimmel’s grounded theory suggesting that male gamers are often looking for a masculinized space in which the politically correct views of society at large need not be voiced.\n\nH4\n\nIn box art that includes female characters, portrayal of female characters as non-central and sexualized is positively associated with game sales.\n\nIn summary, the four hypotheses tested here suggest that video game sales will be higher when male and female characters are portrayed in a way that is consistent with the masculine space that gamers are seeking (Kimmel, 2008). Specifically, sales will be high when male characters are portrayed as central to the game play through their dominant position on the box art. Sales will also be high when female characters are portrayed in ways that are consistent with the masculine space, that is as not present or, if present, as non-central and sexualized. If female characters are presented as central, sales are expected to be low, regardless of sexualization. In other words, the prediction here is not that sexualization of female characters is associated with high sales, but rather that the marginalization of female characters is associated with high sales. Marginalization may be signaled in one of three ways: by not showing female characters at all; by showing female characters as subordinate to other characters through portraying them as non-central; and by portraying sexualized female characters as non-central so that they are not shown to be both sexualized and dominant.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe research question explored in this study was whether the presence and portrayal of female characters on video game box art would be related to sales. Earlier research has shown that female characters are shown less frequently than male characters in video games, take a lead role in games less frequently than male characters, and are often portrayed as highly sexualized, especially in best-selling games (Williams et al., 2009). Many researchers have posited that video games have a large impact on players and the larger culture, but they have not always specified which games (or which audience); not all games have an equally large impact, as Williams et al. (2009) pointed out. They therefore argued that it was important for future research to consider presence and portrayal of female and male characters in the video games played by the largest audience, since these are the games with the greatest potential to impact their audience. Drawing on this idea, this study examines the associations between game sales and box art depictions of the presence, centrality, and sexualization of female characters; it also investigates depictions of the presence and centrality of male characters with game sales. The goal is to determine which gendered portrayals of women and men the audience of “traditional” console games are most exposed to. Results from this study suggest that, among Teen and Mature games, sales are highest in games with box art depicting non-central, sexualized female characters. Thus, not only are female characters (particularly central or non-sexualized ones) underrepresented in game box art, they are particularly underrepresented when taking into account the number of game copies sold. In contrast, the presence of central male characters was positively associated with sales.\n\nThe other goal of this study was to try to understand (admittedly through indirect means) why these depictions are so prevalent. The simple answer implied by these results is that these depictions are prevalent because they tend to sell better, and marketers presumably know this fact. Specifically, sexualization of female characters is associated with higher sales only when no female characters are central in the box art. These findings suggest an answer as to why the most prevalent and stereotypical depictions of characters in box art improve sales. They are all signals that code a game as masculine, something that this audience expects and values in games. Hypersexualized and objectified women, aggressive men, and signs relating to violence or war are effectively symptoms of a masculine-coded space or cultural object, not just content that this audience desires for its own sake; in other words, a masculine-coded space signals potential buyers that the game will meet the cultural norms for this type of game space. In contrast, central female characters and any signs that might code the game or space as feminine contradict audience expectations and desires. The higher sales of games rated Mature lends further credence to this idea—these games received a higher ESRB rating than games rated Teen because they had more violent, sexual, and/or drug-related content, all of which are generally coded as masculine. While it is possible that potential consumers seeking masculine games note the ESRB rating in making purchasing decisions (since ESRB ratings are listed on the box front), it seems likely that potential buyers also detect cues of masculine coding in box art. Thus, it appears from these results that it is overall gender coding of games and their box art, not necessarily specific depictions of men and women in and of themselves, that affects sales through audience preferences. These associations with sales are consistent with the predicted dynamics of gender coding resulting from producer-receiver interaction; however, these data do not allow for examination of the decision-making processes for the creation of box art depictions or of player purchasing decisions, so further research is required to verify that this is the correct explanation.\n\nThat being said, new genres and niche markets are emerging, bringing with them the possibility of new genre conventions motivated in part by new audiences. “Casual” games, which often have less masculine-gendered game play and goals (such as raising crops in Farmville or mimicking the physical movements of real sports or fitness exercises in some Wii games), have emerged as a growing portion of the video games market. These games have gained popularity with demographic groups that have not traditionally been represented among gamers, such as women and older people, and seem to have changed the composition of the overall games audience. The Entertainment Software Association (2011) found that the average age of gamers is 35 years of age and that adult women now represent a larger portion of the gaming audience (30%) than males under 17 (18%). As a result, these games are often gendered gender-neutral or even feminine, and accordingly often portray women differently from traditional games (Wohn, 2011). Accordingly, as Kimmel (2008) would predict, casual games are often derided by “hardcore” gamers (more traditional, primarily male gamers) as inferior or not “real” games. These developments suggest that the emergence of new genres that appeal more to women, rather than changes in the conventions of existing, masculine-coded genres, may result in more realistic and diverse portrayal of women in at least some video games in the near future. With time, such a portrayal of women may even spread to the majority of games, either if more gender-neutral “casual” games take up more of the market or if game producers innovate ways to include more realistic portrayals of women in “traditional” games without sacrificing their masculine coding in an attempt to attract a larger audience. For all of these reasons, one should not interpret the results of this study as indicating that a marginalized portrayal of women will necessarily improve game sales; furthermore, designing games to capitalize on a marginalized portrayal of women based on such a simplistic interpretation could negatively impact society because of the potential negative effects of stereotyped gender portrayals on players’ gender schemas and self-esteem.\n\nLimitations\n\nThere are at least three limitations in this study that render the findings tentative. While box art is a widely accessible advertisement of video game content, it is far from the only form of advertisement and may produce an incorrect estimate of the incidence of female characters and highly sexualized female characters in games themselves. Thus, it is conceivable that the portrayal of women in other forms of advertisement or in game content itself may better predict game sales.\n\nSecond, the box art examined in this study was for games marketed in the US only; results may not generalize to games marketed in other countries. Often the same or similar box art is used for games sold in different geographic areas, but this is not always the case. It is quite possible that results would be similar if the study was replicated for sales in Japan, Europe or Australia, but this cannot be determined from the current study.\n\nFinally, because the sample did not include PC games or free-to-play games, the results may not be representative of these sections of the population. Similarly, they almost certainly are not representative of casual games and games aimed at children, as the sample did not include games with ESRB ratings lower than T.\n\nConclusions\n\nFindings from earlier research of gendering of video games have shown that female characters are less likely to appear as central characters and are more often portrayed as sex objects than are male characters. With one exception (Williams et al., 2009), earlier studies focused on a broad sample of video games, and even that study was unable to identify high-selling games precisely. In contrast, this study focuses on games rated Teen or Mature (games that are usually aimed at the “traditional,” young male audience of video games) and uses sales as an indication of potential influence on socialization and culture. Because players are very likely to be exposed to a select group of top-selling games, the depictions of women and men in these games may have disproportionate influence. Based on this study’s results, this influential group of games tends to include either no characters or one or more male characters in its box art, to place male characters in central positions, to include female characters only in conjunction with male characters, and to depict female characters (when they are present) as sexualized and non-central."
