Donkey Kong\n\n-Mighty Flip Champs (still need S rank on every level\n\n-Robot Rescue (fun game and now trying to beat the 2nd one)\n\n-Shantae: Risky's Revenge (this was a great game and really want the next game to come soon)\n\n-Soul of Darkness (Castlevania rip off but still good)\n\n-X-Scape (One of the best shooter games ive played)\n\nthat is my list of beaten Dsiware games but its only half of them and im trying to beat the rest. ones on my list are Robot Rescue 2, Abyss, Anonymous notes 1 and 2, Art Style Pictobits, and Tower of Deus\n\nI've beaten only a few things. This is mainly because I either am swamped with schoolwork all the Time or that I don't really buy the easy to beat games. I have beaten\n\nZelda four swords anniversary edition\n\n(Btw I am the biggest zelda fan out there)\n\nI haven't beaten any other dis games but the 3DS games if beaten are\n\nSuper Mario 3D land\n\nLegend of zelda ocarina of time 3D\n\nNot alot of games :/"
