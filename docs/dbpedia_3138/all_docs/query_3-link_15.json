        "text": "The Nintendo DS, a handheld game system from the 2000s, had lots of games—over 3,500. As they stopped making the DS, some games got rare and collectors want them more. With the DS, 3DS, and Wii no longer made, these rare games are even more in demand for people collecting them.\n\nMy World, My Way\n\nMy World, My Way is a Nintendo DS game developed by Atlus and Global A Entertainment in 2009. The game follows a princess protagonist who has the ability to alter her surroundings according to her desires, reflected in the game’s title. She can choose to engage in combat or use her whims to dispel foes, spending her “pout points” to make changes. The game humorously mocks RPG games, such as naming the starting area “The First Town” and including random encounters and standard foes. It also features character development and side missions that defy logic in the real world.\n\nCommando Steel Disaster\n\nCommando: Steel Disaster stands out from the Nintendo DS lineup. You play as an agent fighting against a villainous group through quick action and different weapons over five stages. It was popular at launch, yet few copies were made. For a long time, you could only get it online, making any physical versions of it quite rare by 2023.\n\nDragon Quest VI Realms of Revelation\n\nFor a while, Square Enix re-released several beloved Dragon Quest games for the 3DS, including Dragon Quest V and Dragon Quest IV, which we own. Notably, Dragon Quest VI made its US debut in this format. As 3DS popularity waned and sales dipped, a fresh batch of Dragon Quest titles emerged for the latest handheld device. Consequently, collectors clung to the older games, driving up their prices.\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood’s Zombie BBQ\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood’s Zombie BBQ may not be top-notch, but collectors have kept it in their stash. It’s a rail shooter that uses the dual screens for a vertical shooting experience. The game’s publisher, Destineer, quietly closed in 2011, taking its subsidiaries with it. The developer, EnjoyUp, seems to have mostly worked on DS and Wii titles. Nonetheless, Little Red Riding Hood’s Zombie BBQ started gaining popularity among collectors around 2016.\n\nPokémon HeartGold\n\nYou might think getting Pokémon games for the Nintendo DS is easy, but they’re actually getting hard to find. And a collector’s edition of Pokémon HeartGold with a Pokéwalker? That’s even tougher to come by since they were only sold for a limited time and in small amounts.\n\nPowerbike\n\nPowerbike is an under-the-radar game similar to motocross, where you can race across a variety of special tracks. You get an invite from a secret sponsor to compete in the Powerbike races for cash, glory, and status. Dodging the cops on the regular streets is key to keeping safe and in the game while racing.\n\nShepherd’s Crossing 2\n\nThe original Shepherd’s Crossing was a memorable game on the PlayStation 2. Later, Shepherd’s Crossing 2 came out on the Nintendo DS and gained a lot of fans. If you like games about farming like Stardew Valley, you’d probably enjoy Shepherd’s Crossing 2. However, they stopped making it after a while, which has made it one of the hardest-to-find games for the Nintendo DS.\n\nSolatorabo: Red the Hunter\n\nSolatorabo: Red the Hunter takes place in an enchanting fantasy realm infused with steampunk elements. You explore various airborne islands in search of a secret file in this imaginative game. Although it wasn’t a bestseller at launch, it gained a dedicated following in 2010. Nowadays, the limited physical copies available tend to be quite pricey.\n\nSuper Robot Taisen OG Saga Endless Frontier\n\nSuper Robot Taisen OG Saga: Endless Frontier is a sought-after RPG in the Western market, with collectors willing to pay a premium for a copy. The game is challenging to find, especially the editions that come with a bonus Music CD. The storyline follows Haken Browning, a bounty hunter navigating war-torn planets and different dimensions in a science fiction epic. It offers a traditional RPG experience that fans of the genre will enjoy.\n\nVeggy World\n\nWithout a doubt, the most rare Nintendo DS game is Veggy World. Released first for the Wii in 2010 and then for the DS a year later, it offered entertaining gameplay where players fly a spaceship and battle food-themed foes. However, poor sales meant fewer copies were made, making it extremely hard to find one now."
