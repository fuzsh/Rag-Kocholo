        "text": "Proof positive that adding zombies makes everything better\n\nWith the countless tens of thousands of video games in existence, even the most diligent gamers may constantly miss some really good games that simply go under the radar.\n\nBy now, the Nintendo DS has one of the most expansive game library in history, making the task of finding diamonds in the rough in its library even more difficult. Let me save you some trouble – Little Red Ridinghood’s Zombie BBQ is just such a diamond in the rough. Produced by a small Spanish developer with very little to their name, this gem went largely unnoticed, so let’s correct that here and now – this is hands down one of the best shooters on the DS.\n\nPremise\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood’s Zombie BBQ is an Ikari Warriors style vertical scrolling shooter where you play as an overly busty-for-really-no-reason Little Red Riding Hood or her equally oddly placed Asian friend, Momotaro [who is now a ninja] and progress through classic children fairy tale lands that have become infested with the living dead and their evil overlords, the big bad wolf, the three little pigs, santa and more. Seriously, if that last sentence alone isn’t convincing you that this game is awesome, I don’t think anything will. Without a doubt, best. Premise. Ever.\n\nStory\n\nOnce upon a time, zombies invaded fairy tale land, so two extreme zombie killing heroes, Little Red Ridinghood and her Asian friend, peach-boy Momotaru (yes, that Momotaru), joined forces to put an end to the zombie threat. I wish I could blame this plot line on some weird localization, but not this time.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe visuals are a mixed bag. Yet another 3D-pusher on the DS, Zombie BBQ sometimes bites off more than it can chew and suffers slowdown because of it. Despite the 3D engine, there’s still quite a few completely 2D sprites involved which can look downright awful up close. There are many nice looking particle effects and character sprites are large enough to be distinctive and instantly recognizable, an important trait in any game of this type. There’s constantly things going on on both screens, which act together to form one tall screen. Like other DS games to take this approach, there occasionally can be enemies and projectiles that are hidden in the “dead zone” between the two screens, but it’s not nearly as big of a problem as it might have been had the game not been auto scrolling.\n\nAudio\n\nThere really isn’t anything that pops out about the audio in game. There’s a small pool of voice samples thrown in that are cheesy, goofy and wildly inappropriate, like Riding Hood’s voice being that of a submissive sounding french-maid as she wields a machine gun to mow down zombies.\n\nThe music tracks are all rock riffs that sound pleasant to listen to, even if they are slightly uninspired and almost generic in nature. The best track in the game is the titlescreen/intro theme, posted below for your listening pleasure.\n\nGameplay\n\nFrom the get-go, it’s pretty obvious that the development team over at EnjoyUp are fans of oldschool virtual scrolling shooters like Commando and Ikari Warriors. Zombie BBQ feels like a spiritual successor to those classic titles.\n\nGameplay consists of blasting hordes of zombies in an on-rails, auto scrolling shooter. Your character reminds at the very bottom of the touch screen while enemies advance towards you starting at the top screen. You cannot move forwards of backwards, but the game does allow you to switch between any of the seven grid points on the very bottom of the screen. As the game advances, some grids become filled with moving enemies, obstucting your movement and making the game much more challenging than you might think this kind of game might be.\n\nAlthough your default weapon, either a machine gun or throwing stars have an endless ammo supply, as you play, you will gain sub-weapon powerups like a shotgun, flamethrower and powerful piercing laser that will help you get out of sticky situations. Bosses often take up almost both screens entirely and require quite a bit of skill to defeat.\n\nControl\n\nTouch screen action games are made or broken based on how well they control, and I’m happy to report that Little Red Ridinghood’s Zombie BBQ has excellent controls.\n\nThe game requires you to use the stylus and the d-pad at once, but luckily there’s a left-handed configuration that allows the stylus and the Y and A buttons to be used instead for left-handed gamers such as myself. It really works great.\n\nTouch Screen: Fire in the direction of the touch, double tap to launch gernade, touch tap on character to duck, swipe at enemies to preform melee attack\n\nD-pad: Movement left/right\n\nY: Move left\n\nA: Move right\n\nStart: Pause\n\nAll other buttons: unused\n\nStart: Pause\n\nBack: Unused\n\nFrustration\n\nEven on the easiest difficulty setting, Zombie BBQ is no cakewalk. This game is oldschool hard in every sense of the term. You can’t take many hits, you loose weapons gained after you do die, and the bosses get to be brutally difficult. The third stage boss is particularly annoying as you have to fight him in three different forms, and should you die you have to restart back at the first form again. I normally would shy away from such a suggestion, but you might want to consider investing in an Action Replay or other cheat device for your DS just so you can see the ending of this one. It really is that tough.\n\nAvailability & Price\n\nThe game is a little uncommon, but you should be able to find it if you look hard enough. I paid just $8 for my copy, which is a perfect price for a game of this nature. It can also be found on the DSiWare service for DSi and 3DS for around the same price. Just keep in mind that you won’t be able to use the Action Replay should you buy a digital copy.\n\nHistory\n\nDeveloped by small Spanish developer EnjoyUp who at present, only have four game titles to their name, Zombie BBQ was only the second game the developer produced.\n\nHeavily influenced by classic shooters such as Ikari Warriors and to some extent Super C, Little Red Ridinghood’s Zombie BBQ received mixed reviews for it’s oldschool, arcade style approach.\n\nTwo years after it’s North American debut, the title was planned to be released in Europe under the new simpler title Zombi BBQ, and the boxart as you can see, looked nothing short of amazing.\n\nSadly, it was decided by the powers to be that the physical European cartridge version be canceled and released in Europe only as a digital download on the DSiWare service.\n\nA short time later, the digital copy would appear in the North American DSiWare store as well.\n\nOriginal Advertising\n\nOriginal trailer for Zombie BBQ, just it is as ridiculously fun as it looks.\n\nOverall\n\nGood\n\nA story so completely absurd you can’t help but love it\n\nJust look what they did to Little Red Riding Hood!\n\nFairly impressive graphics considering the hardware\n\nSimple, effective controls that mostly work for left handed gamers as well as right\n\nBad\n\nIncredibly difficult and unforgiving\n\nSome minor slowdown and very ugly sprite/3D polygon mixing in some parts of the game\n\nMost special weapons have very little ammo\n\nLeft handed players are at a slight disadvantage. The Y & A buttons just don’t feel as natural as left & right on the d-pad\n\nConclusion\n\nWith three difficulties, two playable characters, and 21 stages, Zombie BBQ should last any shooter fan for quite a while. The game is punishingly difficult, but a helluva lotta fun.\n\nZombie BBQ is a fun, interesting and downright sexy revival of the classic shooter genre on the DS. Everything about the game works, from the touch controls to the duel-screen gameplay. Efforts such as this should be wholeheartedly applauded in order to keep this dying genre alive. Go out and pick this one up. As bad as the visuals get though, all is forgiven once you look again at what EnjoyUp did to “little” red ridinghood! As the image above proves, awesome cosplay makes everything better.\n\nData\n\nPlatform: Nintendo DS, DSiWare\n\nGenre: Virtual Shoot ‘em Up\n\nRelease Date: October 21, 2008, sometime in 2010 (Europe)\n\nDeveloper: EnjoyUp\n\nPublisher: Destineer\n\nAlso from the developer: Not much else noteworthy\n\nAlso try: Ikari Warriors (Arcade), Commando, Super C\n\nGame Length: ~3-4 hours\n\nESRB: T, evidently for tits.\n\nBuy/Skip: Buy\n\nThe fifth generation of Pokémon arrives on the DS\n\nLast year, I imported Pocket Monsters HeartGold and reviewed it far before it was localized. This year I continue the trend with the newly released Pocket Monsters Black version. Keep in mind I am not completely fluent in Japanese, so some errors may spring up. This is the impressions and opinions of a long time western fan of the series and nothing else. While I am covering the Black version, all that I state here should apply to the White version as well.\n\nFifteen years ago, the first pair of Pokémon games, Red and Green, were released in Japan and became massive hits. Since then, Pokemon had grown into a huge fad that has subsided somewhat since the turn of the millennium. Nevertheless, those who have stuck with the games for the long haul have continually found many reasons to return to the new titles again and again even though the fundamental basics of each new game remain untouched since the days of the black-and-white Gameboy.\n\nLast year, Game Freak gave us fantastic remakes of the two best games in the series, Gold and Silver, with Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver. These updates featured many incredible enhancements, most notably vastly superior audio and visuals to any game in the series before it.\n\nThis year, Game Freak gives us a brand new pair of Pokémon games, the first two in what is being called Generation 5, as it is the fifth time new, never before seen Pokemon had been added and await eager trainers worldwide.\n\nBy now, it’s an absolute foregone conclusion that these games will receive fantastic reviews and sell boatloads when they are localized. The question for the moment however, is if you should import one of these Japanese text-heavy RPGs or wait for the western release. Read on to find out.\n\nStory\n\nBlack and White have just as much story (or lack thereof) as any previous games. You start out in your small village and receive a beginner Pokémon and set out on a journey to become a Pokémon Master by challenging and defeating other trainers, gym leaders and eventually the elite four and current champion.\n\nAlong the way, you will encounter yet another evil organization, Team Plasma, whose goals involve “freeing” Pokémon from their human trainers. Of course, you being a lone beginning trainer will eventually defeat and disband the evil PETA wannabes, but let’s pretend for now that they’re imposing and mysterious. Seriously. Their leader is a guy named “N”! I wonder what his name in the English version will be? Ah well. Did someone say smooth criminal?\n\nGraphics\n\nAt first glance, the graphical upgrades for Black and White over those from previous games are minor. By and large, the game still basically looks the same it always has as far back as generation 1 on the original Gameboy.\n\nThe game is still has a square title based overworld where everyone moves like chess pieces and cannot travel on angles. Pokémon still face off in battle as they always have with yours in the lower left and the foe’s in the upper right.\n\nThat said, this is without a doubt the best looking set of Pokémon games ever. The overworld is now rendered completely in 3D, making every location look as the special 3D areas from Platinum and HeartGold/SoulSilver. On the overworld, there are many new effects, such as light shimmering on the surface of water, leaves flying through the air, water dripping from walls and ceilings of caves, and much more. In addition to those changes, many areas now feature fully three dimensional spaces and do some interesting camera angles as you twist up a large bridge, the interior of builds or climb a spiral staircase.\n\nPokémon are still sprite based, but are no longer static. In battle, all Pokemon now animate as they did in Pokemon Crystal, but to a much greater degree. Now, Pokemon has no idle sprites whatsoever. Even in battle, the screen will pan around when no input is made, making the battle seem much more alive and in tune with battle scenes in other modern RPGs.\n\nSomething else I feel I should point out is for the first time, the games now make full use of Japanese Kanji. In every previous game, Hiragana and Katakana were used exclusively, allowing Japanese children who had not learned many Kanji characters to easily play the game. As a student of the language myself, this change is very off-putting as the game doesn’t sublimate the Kanji with the Furigana aid. You can change this off in the options, but by default, expect to see many Kanji characters this time around in the import versions.\n\nOn a technical note, for those who were hoping it would be fixed from HeartGold/SoulSilver, I’m sorry to have to inform you Black and White operate in 30 frames per second as the previous Gen 4 games did. As such, expect occasional jerkiness and slowdown when accessing areas with high polygon counts.\n\nAudio\n\nFor the most part, the audio this time around is quite strong. The bump in quality isn’t as pronounced as it was in HeartGold/SoulSilver, but I’m still really enjoying the score thus far. That said, many of the early tracks remind me of Diamond & Pearl’s somewhat forgettable tracks. Nothing is standing out overly bad, but as of the writing of this review, I have not encountered any tracks that have compelled me enough to wear headphones as HeartGold and SoulSilver’s tracks did.\n\nEven with gen 5’s visual updates, the sound effects still seem primitive. As always, Pokémon shout their 8-bit cries rather than scream their names as in the anime. Considering what an amazing job GameFreak did arranging the music, it’s sad to hear the 8-bit screeches that play during it. I still hope that someday this changes. New cries sound just as primitive as those of the first 151. Ouch Game Freak!\n\nGameplay\n\nThe heart and soul of every Pokémon game is the gameplay, and Black & White are no different.\n\nPart of what makes Pokemon so good is that there are layers and layers of depth if you choose to explore.\n\nAmong the new changes, you can now encounter two wild Pokemon at once. However, you still can’t catch a Pokémon until one of the two wild Pokemon have fainted. This works like any other double battle, but it’s a cool concept that shakes things up a bit. There’s even a three on three battle which is quite speedier than multiple one-on-one battles.\n\nUnfortunately, there’s only a handful of triple battles in the entire game and double battles seem to be missing entirely. Expect to see the same ol’ one-on-one encounters as always.\n\nThe Battle Menu is arranged in the same manner HeartGold and SoulSilver’s was, with a large fight option up top with the items bag, run and switch Pokemon options below. Game Freak even went to the effort to label them in English. How swell.\n\nControl\n\nVery little has changed from the Gen 4 games:\n\nD-pad: Movement\n\nTouchscreen: c-gear menu, options\n\nA: Confirm selections\n\nB: Cancel selections\n\nY: Item shortcut\n\nX: Menu\n\nL: Cycle menus left\n\nR: Cycle menus right\n\nStart: No function\n\nSelect: Reorganize items\n\nThe only real difference from HeartGold and SoulSilver is this time around, the touch screen is used to run the c-gear, which, from what I can tell, is a mode that allow other players to be able to see you’re online and offer trades and battles at any time, no matter if you’re in a Pokemon Center or not. Of course, having Wifi enabled all the time severely hampers battery life, so I play with c-gear off. In the top left corner, there is a digital 12-hour clock, even in battles!\n\nOutside of battle, the Y button can now be used to cycle through several shortcuts for everything from using items to checking the Pokedex. When deep in menus, the X button acts as a “cancel all” command, equivalent to pressing B several times.\n\nFrustration\n\nThe game’s frustration depends largely on your proficiency with reading Japanese and ability to solve simple logic problems. I have read many comments for people getting stuck in the third town early on. The game tells you perfectly clearly where to proceed, but for those who cannot read Japanese, expect to get lost without the aid of a walkthrough. As you progress, you will find the gyms all have their leaders missing and you will have to go off and find them before you can even enter their gym!\n\nAlso point of frustration is that none of the previous Pokemon appear at all until you’ve beaten the elite four, meaning you will have to use new Pokemon and expose yourself to the risks involved of raising creates you don’t know.\n\nAvailability & Price\n\nPocket Monsters Black and White are only available in Japan right now. Import prices vary, but don’t expect to pay less than at least $50 USD for a copy. Pokemon games usually sell for more than other imports.\n\nKeep in mind that the original DS and the DS Lite are region-free, but Black and White will only play on the Japanese DSi and DSi LL.\n\nImport Friendliness\n\nAs the games are completely in Japanese, they are for the most part easy to figure out. Being able to read and understand basic Japanese kana definitely helps, but is not absolutely necessary to enjoy the game. Remember these are children’s games, so they shouldn’t be too difficult to figure out even if you can’t read a word of Japanese.\n\nHistory\n\nAs these games are brand new in Japan, there isn’t too much for me to put here. What I can say is that these games are evolutions of Diamond and Pearl – they look basically the same, but are greatly expanded. If Diamond & Pearl were remade with Black and White’s engine, you’d see some pretty crazy stuff. I can only hope Game Freak will use this engine for Gen III remakes of Ruby and Sapphire, but something tells me they won’t. Bastards.\n\nOverall\n\nGood\n\n-It’s Pokemon!\n\n-Highly impressive Visuals…in a Pokemon game!\n\n-TMs can be used infinitely\n\n-Incredibly lengthy game at around….500 hours? No joke.\n\nBad\n\n-You will occasionally still need to carry around an HM slave. C’mon GameFreak, this this flaw already. HM use out of battle should be done with key items, not moves!\n\n-You won’t see any of your favorites until after you beat the game for the first time.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Legacy of Pokémon stretches back nearly two decades, back on the original Gameboy. Since then, the turn based strategy games with unbelievable personalization, hidden depth and replay value have continued to evolve, offering many slight changes to better the experience. The resulting games in Black and White are every bit as much finely crafted works of art as they are entertaining videogames. The legacy of Pokemon is grand indeed. I can’t recommend these games enough. They are easily better than even HeartGold and SoulSilver. If you had asked me last year, I wouldn’t have said such a thing was even possible. I’m still shocked, in fact. Black and White are just that incredible. Import one of these. Now.\n\nData\n\nPlatform: Nintendo DS, DSi\n\nGenre: Turn Based RPG\n\nRelease Date: September 19, 2010\n\nDeveloper: GameFreak\n\nPublisher: Nintendo\n\nAlso from the developer: Pokémon HeartGold/Soul Silver, Pokemon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum\n\nGame Length: ~500 hours+\n\nCERO Rating: A\n\nImport or wait: Import\n\nGameFreak remakes the best games they’ve ever produced\n\nHealth risk notice: the following review is a revised script I wrote for the import version. Copypasta may contain trace of peanuts. Women who are nursing, pregnant or may become pregnant should stop eating copypasta and contact their doctor immediately. Side effects of copypasta may include laziness, and journalistic apathy.\n\nLate last year, Nintendo released two more entries in the ongoing Pokémon main series of games in Japan – Pocket Monsters HeartGold and SoulSilver. This past spring, the games were finally localized and released in North America as Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver.\n\nIf you’re wondering why these titles sound fermilliar, its because they probably are –\n\nThese are remakes of the incredibly popular and successful Gold and Silver games, not to mention the fact that I put up a review of the import versions right here on my blog last year. Now that I have the English versions, I’ll go over them again in greater depth.\n\nIt’s been ten years since Gold and Silver hit the Gameboy Color in America, and Nintendo/Game Freak felt it was time to remake Gold and Silver from the ground up on the Nintendo DS using the graphics engine that powered the 2007 Pokémon games Diamond and Pearl. Was their plan a success?\n\nWithout a doubt, a resounding yes. Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver are the best Pokémon games made thus far. If you’ve fallen out of place and missed the last several games, this is where you should jump back in. There was a reason why I imported the Japanese version even though I have only a preschooler’s ability to actually read written kana.\n\nGenre\n\nIf somehow you don’t know what a Pokémon game is about, kill yourself let me tell you.\n\nThe Pokémon games are turn based strategy RPGs with a heavy emphasis on customization. You engage in battles using your starter Pokémon against wild Pokémon and other trainers to gain strength and catch other Pokémon in orde to defeat other powerful trainers.\n\nThe primary goal of the game is to become a Pokémon master, but you also have the secondary goal to capture each of the 400+ Pokémon asnd complete your Pokédex. A third goal is to maybe train a few parties of six Pokémon. Altogether, these goals probably offer around 200 hours of gameplay at the very least. Truly, these are not short RPGs by any means despite their kiddy appearance.\n\nStory\n\nPokémon games are generally light on story, but essentially, you play as a beginner Pokémon trainer aiming to become a Pokémon Master. Along your journey you must collect badges from Gym Leaders and foil the secret plans of the criminal organization Team Rocket.\n\nLike every game since Crystal, you can choose the gender of your character at the start of the game. You can choose to be Gold/Kenta/Ethan, a young boy clad in red and gold or Kris/Kotone/Lynete, a revised design of the Crystal female character now dressed in only what can be described as a Mario outfit. I find this change rather odd and confusing.\n\nWhy the update? Crystal looked fine (not that way, pedo!) the way she was. One theory is she didn’t suddenly change, it was a gradual change over several years.\n\nLike with all other Pokémon games, players will be divided into two categories, no exceptions – those who are fine with the visual presentation and those who feel it is completely outdated and in major need of an overhaul.\n\nSee, with every new release in the main series, the main graphics have only improved slightly. For the main overworld field graphics, the original Gold and Silver used a slightly improved engine from that of Red and Blue. Then Ruby and Sapphire used a slightly improved engine from Gold and Silver. After that, Diamond and Pearl used a slightly improved engine from Ruby and Sapphire. Guess what HeartGold and SoulSilver do?\n\nIf you guessed they use a slightly improved Diamond/Pearl engine, you’re catching along. The games do employ some DS-specific visual tricks such as changes in depth and 3D buildings made of simple polygons rather than sprites, but these effects are tacked on and the game wouldn’t suffer without them at all.\n\nIn battle, the biggest difference ever was from the days of Red and Blue where most Pokémon barely resembled what they were suppose to look like to Gold and Silver’s excellent sprite sets. HeartGold/SoulSilver use even more detailed, excellent sprites. There really isn’t more than I can say. Basically, the visuals are the same as they’ve always been, only slightly enhanced.\n\nSound\n\nThe return to Johto would be a rather dull experience if the fantastic music from the originals were not present and luckily they are – and holy shit do they sound good. Every chiptune from Gold and Silver have now been remixed using the godly DS soundchip and the remixes range from very good to “holy shit, did my DS just produce that awesome track?!”. I’ve played a lot of DS games, but I haven’t had that kind of experience since the first time I heard Golden Sun on the GBA. That’s how good it is.\n\nGameFreak has seriously raised the bar in terms of audio on the DS. This game demands to be played either by pumping the sound out via headphones or better yet, a surround sound speaker system. As a special totally awesome treat for long time players, towards the end of the game once you get all sixteen badges, return to Celadon City and get an item called the GB Player – this nifty item reverts all audio tracks back to the 8-bit GBC chiptunes, and even generates new chiptunes for tracks not found in the originals!\n\nOne last time I think I should mention – as always, Pokémon shout their 8-bit cries rather than scream their names as in the anime. Considering what an amazing job GameFreak did arranging the music, it’s sad to hear the 8-bit screeches that play during it. I hope that someday this changes, or at least gives you the option to change it. The 8-bit cries have become so entrenched with the games that I’m not sure I’d like a Pokémon game without their ridiculously primitive sounds.\n\nRather than bore you with how these games play I’ll simply list the highlights:\n\n-Can trade with Diamond Pearl and Platinum, as well as import Pokémon from Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, FireRed and LeafGreen. English Pokémon can be traded without problem to the Japanese game and vise versa!\n\n-Fully touchscreen driven interface in all aspects, not just battle.\n\n-Refined battle system from Diamond Pearl and Platinum.\n\n-New backpack interface that is touchscreen driven and allows easy sorting of all your hundreds of items by game’s end\n\n-PokéGear makes its return with its watch, map, phone and radio functions fully intact\n\n-Visitable Kanto with almost all of the locals from the original Red and Blue visitable once again, unlike in the original versions of Gold and Silver which simply would remove doors and entrances, making the Kanto region a rather dull one in the original versions of Gold and Silver.\n\n-New events, and even a new area to the west of Cianwood City.\n\nControl\n\nAs mentioned, the entire game has been overhauled to support the touchscreen in all menu aspects. In fact, the only button required to play if you want to do everything on the touchscreen is the D-pad. However, you can still play it with buttons should you prefer. This makes me very thankful, as this is the primary reason I hated StarFox DS so much.\n\nAvailability and Price\n\nThese are new games, and Pokémon games generally carry a premium. Try ebay – I won an auction for a new copy for $18 US! Beware of buying from Hong Kong or China – counterfeit versions are all over ebay. There is also a cheaper French-Canadian version which is real…but the whole game is in French!\n\nAudience\n\nEveryone, but mostly adults! – While on the surface marketed towards young kids, HeartGold and SoulSilver are unspokenly made for gamers in their 20’s that have fond memories of the original Gold and Silver. The online component means we no longer need to gather in playgrounds with link cables and carry around heavy shame and embarrassment for doing so. There are Pokémon General threads on notorious imageboard 4chan several times a day, everyday – Pokémon games are secretly for the hardcore adult gaming nerds and we’re proud of it.\n\nHistory\n\nAfter several slight revisions to the hugely successful Pocket Monsters Red and Green and after they had become popular in North America as well, development quickly started on the next Pokémon games.\n\nFirst announced in Japan in as early as 1997, Pocket Monsters 2: Gold and Silver were originally planned to be Gameboy games that would make heavy use of the Super Gameboy’s enhanced color. As the project progressed, GameFreak began to shift development towards the up and coming Gameboy Color, which would greatly outclass what would be possible on the SGB.\n\nAlmost two years later, near finished versions of Gold and Silver were shown at SpaceWorld in early 1999, and anticipation for Gold and Silver grew like wildfire the world over.\n\nThe next games promised so, very much. Full color, vastly improved graphics, a new world, and new Pokémon were just the tip of the iceberg New Pokémon were shown and speculation on just how big these games were ran rampant.\n\nPlanned for around the time of release, Nintendo also announced a virtual pet keychain called the Pocket Pikachu Color, which could collect “watts” and be used as a currency to buy useful items in Gold and Silver in much the same way the PokéWalker interacts with HeartGold and SoulSilver.\n\nSome of the many improvements included almost Pokémon would now have gender and could breed, hold items, learn special moves and heal themselves independently with various berries.\n\nAnother big change was that the Special stat from the earlier games would be devided amogst special attack and defense, chaning the dynamic and usefulness of certain existing Pokémon.\n\nFor example, Hitmonlee had a very low special stat in the first games and was thus very weak. When the special stat was divided, it gained a large special defense and a low special attack, making it much more useful. On the flipside, Cloyster, a Pokémon with a very high special stat in the first games, gained a very low special defense.\n\nThe games would also use a real time clock which would not only track the time of day, but also the day of the week. The game actually put various events at certain times of the day and certain days of the week, requiring players who wanted to get everything out of the games to play every day.\n\nGamefreak had introduced so many new concepts in Gold and Silver that the games that followed on the GBA actually removed some of these features to make the games more streamlined and simpler. Even Diamond, Pearl and Platinum lack some of what made Gold and Silver so spectacular.\n\nAs a final unexpected treat, players who beat the Elite Four would be returned to their home town and told….a whole new world awaited.\n\nThe ability to return to Kanto was incredible, and no Pokémon game since has allowed you to do anything like this.\n\nClosing Comments\n\nHeartGold and SoulSilver so closely mimic the original versions that you can still use old strategy guides for the GBC versions if you have any. Old guides still ring true with item, trainers and Pokémon locations as well as general maps. Only slight storyline differences and Crystal inspired events won’t show up in your old guides, but you’ll find them still incredibly helpful.\n\nThe maps really make exploring some areas much easier. You might want to track down the VS guide on ebay.\n\nPersonally,I couldn’t wait for HeartGold or hell, even the original Gold. More than ten years ago, I wanted to play through Pokémon Gold on an emulator (for shame I know) but my then-knowledge of Japanese was null. That’s why I bought this:\n\nThis guide was written in late ’99 shortly after the release the Japanese version and predates any other guide I’ve seen. It carefully details each area what you need to do, who you need to talk to, what items are for sale, etc. Even now, it proves a handy refrencebook for the Japanese experience as it explains the translations of key concepts and words.\n\nA great choice indeed!\n\nAn example of the translation guide\n\nOverall, except a great experience. I played it in Japanese and am playing it again in English. This is a must-buy. It’s epic. 9/10\n\nHot Double Gold Action!\n\nData\n\nPlatform: Nintendo DS\n\nGenre: RPG\n\nRelease Date: 2010\n\nDevoloper: GameFreak\n\nPublisher: Nintendo\n\nDeveloper’s notable other works: Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, FireRed, LeafGreen, Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Gold, Silver, Crystal, Red, Blue, Yellow\n\nESRB: E\n\nBuy or skip: Buy"
