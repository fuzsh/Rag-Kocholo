Without a doubt, Little Red Riding Hood’s Zombie BBQ is the best videogame

name - and concept - I've heard in a long, long time. From the game's

"Story" page:

Our story begins with the invasion of this fairy tale land by hordes of

ravenous zombies. And they won't stop at anything: from the succulent legs

of ham of the Three Little Pigs to the sawdust brain of Pinnochio, they are

all tasty morsels for the living dead. Grotesque aberrations plague the

enchanted forests.

Prince Charmings wake up Sleeping Beauties with real love bites and

ferocious wolves die with they attack abandoned little girls.

Little Red Riding Hood’s Zombie BBQ will be available on the Nintendo DS.

There's no release date yet.
