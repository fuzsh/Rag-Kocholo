About this accommodation

Are you looking for a fun and unique overnight stay in North Brabant? Then staying in one of these three identical houseboats is exactly what you're searching for! These fully-equipped houseboats, designed for 2-4 persons, provide the perfect setting to enjoy nature and water. You can find these boats in a marina at the mouth of the Volkerak. The marina is conveniently located near several highways, ensuring easy accessibility.

The Accommodation:

These modern houseboats (50m2) come complete with all the amenities you need for both short and slightly longer stays. Each boat features two bedrooms, one with a double bed and the other with a bunk bed. The bathroom is equipped with a shower, sink, and toilet. The kitchen includes a dishwasher, refrigerator, oven, and stove. Additionally, the boat offers free Wi-Fi and a smart TV for your entertainment. On hot days, you can enjoy the comfort of air conditioning on board. And if the weather is a bit cooler, simply turn up the heating. From the terrace furnished with outdoor furniture, you can enjoy a beautiful view of the water and the pleasure yachts in the harbor.

All three boats are identical in terms of location, size, and amenities. The only difference lies in their interior decor.

The Surroundings:

If you don't feel like cooking, there's a brasserie in the marina where you can savor delicious meals. Moreover, the location provides numerous opportunities to experience nature in both active and relaxing ways. You can embark on picturesque walks or bike rides through the woods or explore various forts in the area. Afterward, don't miss the chance to enjoy a drink in the fortified town of Willemstad, where you can stroll along historic ramparts and relish culinary delights at one of the many restaurants. If you prefer to visit a larger city, the charming city of Breda is approximately a 30-minute drive from this location.

We had two wonderful days on a tastefully furnished houseboat in a cozy and clean harbor. The extremely competent, friendly & courteous team was absolutely great. Breakfast was excellent and delicious.Wir hatten zwei wunderschöne Tage auf einem geschmackvoll eingerichteten Hausboot in einem gemütlichen und sauberen Hafen. Das außerordentlich kompetente, freundliche & zuvorkommende Team war absolute Klasse. Frühstück war ausgezeichnet und lecker.

Beautiful houseboat on the water. Just a pity that when you took a shower there was an egg smell that made you nauseous and the TV had no channels. But to all nice days hadMooie woonboot op het water. Alleen jammer dat als je ging douchen dat er een eierlucht hing waar je misselijk van werd en dat de tv geen zenders had. Maar om het al leuke dagen gehad
