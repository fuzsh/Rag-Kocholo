        "text": "Positional plagiocephaly is an asymmetrical skull deformation caused by various factors. Although it is not responsible for abnormal brain development in infants and is not related to the onset of neurophysiological problems, it is critical to prevent skull deformity to avoid aesthetic and functional consequences. The purpose of the study is to investigate the relevance of preventive procedures to the onset of positional plagiocephaly, such as the use of passive mattresses, which is primarily correlated with the need for newborns and infants to sleep and rest in proper posture. PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Embase were searched for papers that matched our topic, dating from January 2012 to 22 October 2022, with an English language restriction, using the following Boolean keywords: (“positional plagiocephaly” AND “prevention”). A total of 11 papers were included as relevant papers matching the purpose of our investigation. According to the rese...\n\ninfants do not have lambdoid synostosis, but rather a condition known as plagiocephaly without synostosis (PWS). This condition can be treated nonsurgically. Since its recognition, PWS has been highlighted in the public media, including national prime time television reports, newspapers and Internet discussion groups.2 Coincidentally, evidence is mounting in medical literature to support a relationship between the increased incidence of cranial deformation and infant supine sleep position.1"
