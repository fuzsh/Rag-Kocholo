        "text": "This article discusses the four different roles of local governments which are promoting economic growth, providing or securing life's amenities, maintaining traditional services and arbitrating among conflicting interests. It illustrates the images of the proper role of government or to the actual role of government. This typology was later applied to four different localities in the United States which are Springdale Village, Park Forest, Middletown and Chicago. The first role of the local government is to provide for the proper ambience to spur the locality towards economic growth not only in terms of population but also wealth. The primary goal however in this endeavor is to support the producer although stakeholders such as the banker, the editor, the merchant and city bureaucrats also are stakeholders. Although there are many hindrances to such development, the local government must exert effort to project a good image. This however, runs counter to the second factor which is the role of the local government in providing and securing life's amenities which are attributes of a high standard of living. Many cities have adopted policies to curtail noise and smoking in public places but these are not enough. To this must be added other demands of residents such as safety, peace, beauty and convenience. These conflicting interests however, can be addressed by a higher income among residents as the locality will still be able to address such issues due to a higher income from taxes. This is definitely related to the third role which is the maintenance of traditional services or caretaker government. Such maintenance can only be maintained if taxes are increased and such an action will be immediately opposed by majority of the citizens. Such action will only appeal to the low income bracket or the pensioners who have to rely on social services to make ends meet. Lastly, the local government must also try to arbitrate between conflicting interests. This would mean that what ever action the local authorities would take, someone will always get hurt. This could refer to the minorities as the needs of the majority will have to be given precedence in the order of business. These four types of roles can be further categorized into two groups which are: the unitary conception of the public good and those implying a pluralistic conception. To the former belong the first two roles while the remaining roles are part of the pluralistic conception. This distinction between the unitary and the pluralistic is very essential in understanding the attitude towards governmental structure and the proper role of government to be applied in the four localities to be discussed later. The four localities were primarily selected due to their similarities as all belong to the same state, have the same approximate population of 50,000, were independent manufacturing centers and all have home rule charters. The policies of these cities were studied within a ten-year period. They were labeled"
