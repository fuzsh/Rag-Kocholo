        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nIn the forthcoming years, a dramatic transition in the supply of protein for human nutrition is anticipated. Due to global population growth, prosperity and demographic changes, a considerable increase in the demand for protein is expected (Gilland 2002). As sustainability considerations prohibit that this increasing protein demand can be met by conventional animal sources, we need to shift to a larger share of sustainably produced proteins for inclusion in the human diet. Thus, there is an urgent need for sustainable, safe, healthy and resource-efficiently produced proteins for inclusion in the human diet. Next to focusing on plants-derived proteins, we also need to deal efficiently with all unused by-products. By-products including those derived from animal sources, are often used as feed, while these products could perhaps be better disposed of in the food domain after minimal processing steps. Many of these new sustainable proteins are included in food products as protein isolates or concentrates, facilitating its use in a wide range of foods. Alternative isolated proteins are for instance used in meat analogues, a growing novel food category, of which the knowledge regarding their impact on human health is very limited. We need to know if we can consume relatively high amounts of these alternative protein concentrates and/or isolates on a regular basis, while safeguarding nutritional requirements in terms of amino acid and bioactive peptides supply or without negative health impacts. Although proteins share common features, no generic criteria are yet known for predicting their nutritional functionality. The most important nutritional role of dietary protein is providing human metabolism with amino acids for incorporation into endogenously produced proteins. Particularly their content in essential amino acids, as well as their digestibility and bioavailability are important quality parameters. A second nutritional/physiological role of dietary protein is that they are a source of, transiently present, peptides with biological functions such as impact on the epithelial barrier, regulation of appetite and blood pressure (Sharkey et al., 2020; Bao and Wu 2021, Chelliah et al., 2021). So taken together, when considering alternative protein isolates for human consumption, we need to evaluate their tolerance, nutritional quality, and potential health effects.\n\nWe selected two alternative protein sources for inclusion in this study. These were derived from the plant source corn and from the by-product bovine plasma. Corn has a high yield potential and is a major cereal crop in the world. Protein quality and quantity of corn has been improved over the last decades due to successful bio-fortification (Zhu et al., 2019). The use of animal blood plasma as food is safe and subjected to strict EC food regulations and with versatile interesting food applications (Lynch et al., 2017). Animal blood coming from slaughterhouses represents the most problematic by-product of the meat industry because of the high volumes routinely generated globally (Lynch et al., 2017). A previous study also indicated that bovine blood derived protein can contain bioactive peptides (Zhang et al., 2015). Whey protein was selected as reference due to its complete amino acid profile and rapid digestion and absorption. Its rich composition of essential amino acids and quick delivery to the body set a valuable standard for evaluating other protein sources. Moreover, the established use of whey protein as a reference in numerous studies enables the contextualization of results within existing scientific literature.\n\nIn the current study, we aimed to investigate tolerance, nutritional quality, and potential health effects of bovine-plasma protein (BP) and corn protein (CP) consumption in a healthy (older) adult population and to investigate how these aspects relate to the commonly consumed benchmark protein whey protein (WP). We did this by determining the impact on gut-barrier function, gastrointestinal complaints and cardiometabolic health after daily consumption of 40 g of protein for a week, as well as through measuring postprandial amino acid uptake kinetics after a bolus of 20 g of proteins.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nProtein concentrates and isolated are increasingly consumed and have become an important ingredient in our diets. Here, we evaluated, in a double-blind cross-over intervention trial, tolerance, nutritional quality, and potential health effects of two sustainable protein sources, corn protein (CP) and bovine plasma protein (BP), and compared this with a benchmark whey protein (WP). GI (Self-reported) complaints and intestinal permeability did not differ between the interventions, except for higher self-reported belching and nausea scores during the BP intervention. Clear differences in PAA responses were observed after consumption of the different proteins. One week BP consumption significantly increased blood pressure outcomes compared to the other interventions, and a small decrease in insulin was observed after the CP intervention.\n\nIn the current study, tolerance was investigated by taking several parameters into account. Participants reported their stool type and frequency on a daily basis and rated their general health, feelings of bloating, belching, flatulence, nausea, diarrhea and constipation. Stool type and frequency were stable and fitted in a healthy stool pattern during the entire study. GI complaints did not significantly differ between the three protein interventions. However, self-reported belching and nausea scores were significantly higher at the start of the BP intervention and remained high during the intervention if compared to the CP and WP intervention. Based on the above it can be concluded that a repetitive daily intake of 40 g protein during one week did not induce serious GI complaints or changes to stool and were well tolerated. Still, the higher belching and nausea scores during the BP may be a point of concern. But perhaps this can be solved if these proteins are consumed in a food matrix.\n\nNext to the self-reported GI complaints, we also studied intestinal permeability in the duodenum, small intestine, colon and whole intestine, using a multi-sugar test after an acetylsalicylic acid challenge. These permeability markers did not differ between protein interventions, but some did change during the time of the study. Acetylsalicylic acid, also known as aspirin, is a NSAID, often used to treat pain, fever, and inflammation. As is found for many NSAIDs, acetylsalicylic acid increases gut permeability and acetylsalicylic acid is commonly used in clinical studies to augment gut permeability (Farhadi et al., 2008, Marchbank et al., 2008; Lambert et al., 2012). Our participants were subjected to six gut permeability tests in a relatively short period of five weeks and received 2000 mg of acetylsalicylic acid during each test. The increased urinary sugar ratios sucralose/erythritol over time may have been caused by the repetitive nature of our measurement method. To our best knowledge, this multi-sugar acetylsalicylic acid test had never been performed on the same subject so many times in succession and therefore, the effect of such multi doses of NSAID is unknown. Our results indicate that this should be done with caution and a longer wash-out period between interventions may be advised. The decrease in urinary sugar ratios sucrose/rhamnose was mainly due to high baseline values in the third intervention period. We cannot explain this and cannot rule out a potential technical error. Results should therefore be interpreted with caution.\n\nThe quality of dietary protein is defined in part by its capacity to provide AA and especially EAA. The PAA profiles of a protein source are therefore important to value its potential for human food application. Here we demonstrate, by comparing the AUC values, that TAA uptake for BP was 44% and for CP 61% compared to WP (set at 100%). For TEAA this was for BP 44% and CP 51% relative to WP, indicating a slightly higher essential amino acids uptake score from CP compared to BP. We previously published a similar PAA uptake study with Lemna protein concentrate and collected literature data on AUC values from other protein sources analysed in a human cross-over design with whey as a benchmark protein (Mes et al., 2021). Both the BP and CP AUC outcomes were below or in the range of casein with reported TEAA uptake ranges of 49–60% compared to whey (Tang et al., 2009; Pennings et al., 2011; Gorissen et al., 2016). Still, a higher actual uptake after CP can be expected since the PAA response after CP consumption did not return to baseline after 180 min. Extrapolation of the PAA curves to 5 h predicted a CP TAA uptake of 83.8% relative to WP. However, predicting such a response after the actual 180 min is challenging, as this will be influenced by gastric emptying and transit time in the small intestine. For future clinical studies on PAA kinetics, we would therefore advise to sample at least up to 300 min. A potential interesting finding of our study is the prolonged elevated postprandial levels of the EAA leucine and phenylalanine after CP consumption. The high leucine content of CP was already described in a publication evaluating amino acid content of various plant-based proteins (Gorissen et al., 2018). Leucine, one of the branched-chain EAA, is valued not only as proteogenic but is also anabolic, serving as a regulator for the postprandial stimulation of muscle protein synthesis. High levels of leucine in the blood can stimulate muscle synthesis and inhibit muscle breakdown (Wilkinson et al., 2013; Gorissen et al., 2018; Takegaki et al., 2020; Zaromskyte et al., 2021).\n\nRecent work from our group tested the digestibility of exactly the same protein sources in vitro (Ariëns et al., 2021). Our current findings are not completely in line with outcomes observed in vitro. Both in vivo and in vitro measurements for WP showed a high digestibility. Digestibility for CP appears much lower in vivo as compared to in vitro, since the in vitro method predicted the percentage bioavailable TAA to be 86% ± 5% (in vivo 60.7%) and TEAA 85% ± 6% (in vivo 51.2%) relative to WP. The relative abundance of amino acids in the digestion filtrate of BP in vitro was almost equal compared to WP and therefore much higher compared to the results in the current in vivo trial. These discrepancies may be explained by the fact that the in vitro analysis outcomes also includes peptides and not only free amino acids. Also in vivo plasma amino acid content is not an exact reflection of digestibility (Groen et al., 2015). Alternatively, for both protein sources, the low similarity between in vivo and in vitro results could be due to clotting of proteins in the stomach and gastric emptying, not simulated in the used in vitro model, but known to influence digestibility and uptake of some sources of proteins (Mahe et al., 1996). Therefore static in vitro models for protein digestibility and bioavailability, even those based on the INFOGEST consensus model (Minekus et al., 2014; Brodkorb et al., 2019) should be interpreted with caution.\n\nMethodologies that are the gold standard to report protein quality are based on protein digestibility and the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS) and more recently the digestible indispensable amino acid score (DIAAS) (Dietary protein quality evaluation in human nutrition, 2013). The PDCAAS of whey protein is generally considered to be 1, which is the highest possible score, and its DIAAS values are even higher (Rutherfurd et al., 2015, Mathai et al., 2017). The PDCAAS score for bovine plasma-derived proteins was 78.5, although differences in protein concentrate preparation could have influenced this result (Montero Castillo et al., 2015). Studies on corn protein revealed PDCAAS scores ranging from 28.7 to 67, indicating that preparation methods significantly impact protein quality (Mendes et al., 2016; Zarkadas et al., 1995). To our best knowledge, neither of these novel sources has been assessed using the DIAAS method. Unfortunately, these PDCAAS and DIAAS methods require animal experiments and do not provide information on between-subject variation in response. Determining and quantifying true amino acid digestibility in humans is rather challenging from a methodological perspective and requires expensive and challenging stable isotope techniques (Trommelen et al., 2021). For this reason, amino acid digestibility in humans has been reported for only a limited range of proteins. Here, we measured PAA concentrations in order to estimate the relative digestibility potential of a protein source. Still, appearance of free blood amino acids does only partially reflect the digestibility of a protein source. The amino acid profile in the blood after intake of a meal is determined by metabolism of splanchnic tissue, passage speed in the intestine, protein uptake/breakdown, and endogenous synthesis (Liu et al., 2019).\n\nNext to tolerance and nutritional quality we also investigated biological function and potential health benefits. We evaluated cardiometabolic markers and observed a significant increase in blood pressure and augmentation index, an estimate for arterial stiffness, after consumption of BP compared to WP and CP. The increase in blood pressure following the BP intervention can most likely be attributed to the product's higher salt content. The BP intervention resulted in an additional daily intake of 8.5 g salt per day, thereby exceeding daily recommendations. To ensure suitability for substantial consumption, reducing the BP salt content is highly recommended. Another observation with potential metabolic consequences was the decrease in fasting insulin levels after the CP intervention compared to the other interventions. Proteins from plant sources that enable the maintenance of the glycemic profile may be of interest in the context of type 2 diabetes, but currently their mechanisms of action are unclear (Costa et al., 2020). Since this is a between-groups comparison, the effect is relatively small, and we didn't corrected for multiple testing, we cannot confidently state that this effect has been initiated by the CP intervention Still, the decrease in insulin after the CP when compared to the other interventions may be important findings that need further evaluation. Dietary protein intake is often associated with satiating effects (Morell and Fiszman 2017), hence we were interested in the effect of the test products on appetite status. We did not find leads that the test proteins affected appetite rating in a different manner.\n\nWe evaluated in a comprehensive manner the impact of three different protein sources on tolerance, nutrient quality and health effects but the study had some limitations. We performed a relatively high number of measurements but decided not to apply a correction for multiple testing, because the effect sizes in nutritional interventions are relatively small and we wanted to identify and explore any potential effect. We also had a relative short intervention period of only one week, longer studies are needed to determine the long-term effects. We also do realize that we subjected our study participants to an intensive cross-over study protocol with relatively short wash out periods. This may have influenced some study outcomes, especially the gut permeability test with acetylsalicylic acid challenge.\n\nConsumption of sustainably produced protein in isolated and concentrated form is relatively new, but these proteins are becoming an important factor in our daily diets. Here we demonstrate, for two alternative proteins, that we can consume these protein concentrates in relative high quantities without experiencing unwanted gastro intestinal side effects, that they can be a good source of essential amino acids, while acknowledging that the relative high salt content of the BP may still pose concerns for our health. Future research should focus on longer interventions and implementing these proteins in products and diets that replace conventional proteins to learn more on the health impact when implemented in a regular diet."
