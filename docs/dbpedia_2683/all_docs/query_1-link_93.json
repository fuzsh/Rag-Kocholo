        "text": "Props for omitting Flevoland and following older coastlines, but how do you reckon an east-west divide in Brabant? Wouldn't a north-south line, or (even better) following pre-Revolt provincial lines merely with hightened tensions within the state, be more plausible there?\n\nThanks for the critique. The subdivision of Brabant derive from the catholic-calvinist differences (Calvinism spread deeper in the south). Pre-Revolt Brabant was one unit.\n\nNow, I'm pretty sure I'm not drunk, so it must be the effects you put on that map that's making it fuzzy and hard to read. I suggest removing those. I prefer a very pixel-y map to one that's really fuzzy and indistinct.\n\nOk, here's the map without effects. It was a bit boring so I added the Habsburg Netherlands.\n\nOrange: United Provinces\n\nBrighter: Losses due religious trouble\n\nEven Brighter: Losses due War of Independence\n\nLimburg ate Liege!\n\nVery nice. Though I doubt the benefits of fragment-blurring your whole map.\n\nWhat? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbourg\n\nOrange: United Provinces\n\nBrighter: Losses due religious trouble\n\nEven Brighter: Losses due War of Independence\n\nAs said, anachronistic. The post-1815 province of Limburg had nothing to do with the Duchy of Limburg. Nobody called the area Limburg before, it was part of the Bishopric of Liege - hence it wasnt even Habsburg and hence the United Provinces probably wouldnt even have taken that territory over.\n\nYou will kill me for this. And in case you don't, note that the aformentioned nation is a republic.\n\nAm I still alive? In that case, anyone know a good anthem, or what the prefix Austro- would be in German and Hungarian?\n\nNo comments on my preview?\n\nOh, sorry.\n\nMy eyes were drawn to that über-Luxembourg that Keno had in the post after yours.\n\nAbout your map, doc;\n\nIt's too small!\n\nIt seems cool though, but since you don't have any info about it, there's really nothing more to say, except commenting the small size and then return to drooling over a big Luxembourg...\n\nOh, sorry.\n\nMy eyes were drawn to that über-Luxembourg that Keno had in the post after yours.\n\nAbout your map, doc;\n\nIt's too small!\n\nIt seems cool though\n\nLike I said, just a preview of the section I've completed. It will be larger when its finished. May take me a few more days or another week or so to finish, if that helps you think of this one small piece of it. I'm having to draw borders by sight on much of it and thats not something Im particularly good at.\n\nYou will kill me for this. And in case you don't, note that the aformentioned nation is a republic.\n\nAm I still alive? In that case, anyone know a good anthem, or what the prefix Austro- would be in German and Hungarian?\n\nYou've split me! One one hand, that Austria-Hungary looks awesome, but then it's a republic!\n\nBut then the map is amazing!\n\nWhat do I do?!\n\nAnd the prefix Austro doesn't really work in German. Österreich can't be split up except into its component words of Öster (Eastern) and Reich (Realm).\n\nIt just doesn't make sense to cut it off or modify it. Österreich-Ungarn is sensible, and I don't see why it would change if they stay together (which doesn't seem all that plausible, but it's cool!).\n\nNew England, New France/Quebec, Canada, the United States and the Confederate States?\n\nCorrect, yet at the same time, no New England and United States is correct. But there is no CSA in this. Not Quebec either, but French Canada. I'll say no more for the present, lest I give away the origins.\n\nThe Doctor:\n\nIt's a map of OSC's Alvin Maker-North America, isn't it? I think I recognize the split between New Holland and New Orange along the Hudson, the latter state going up to the Saint Lawrence. There is West Anglia in New England, New Sweden (or was it Luther? No, that's the capital.) and Suskehanny (sp? of the alt-speling) in the US.\n\nUnless i am completely mistaken.\n\nThanks for the critique.

For a more accurate map of the provincial borders during the time of the Eighty Years' War, I'd recommend looking up the Seventeen Provinces.\n\nThe Doctor:\n\nIt's a map of OSC's Alvin Maker-North America, isn't it?
