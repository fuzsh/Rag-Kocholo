        "text": "Suiker Unie’s primary processes are the supply of our products, the associated administrative processes and the production of sugar during the thick juice campaign beginning in mid-May. Suiker Unie has sufficient stock levels to ensure it can continue supplying sugar to its customers.\n\nSuiker Unie has already taken a raft of measures in accordance with the guidelines issued by the government and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) and we will adapt our response immediately if necessary. Our staff are working from home wherever possible. For those who have to work at one of our facilities, additional strict hygiene measures are in place in the workplaces, meeting rooms, etc.\n\nAs well as all these measures, the Cosun business groups are doing their bit to alleviate the corona crisis. Aviko has delivered 7,000 free meals to care workers who are bearing the brunt in these hectic times. Suiker Unie and SVZ have provided nearby hospitals and a doctor’s practice with a large number of face masks that had been in storage in anticipation of the coronavirus. The site in Anklam is supplying lorry loads of disinfecting alcohol distilled from bio-ethanol to producers of hand gels and disinfectants that supply the Academic Medical Central in Amsterdam and other care providers."
