Google complies with the privacy principles of the US 'Safe Harbor’ agreement and is registered with the 'Safe Harbor’ programme of the American Ministry of Trade. Google uses this data to analyze your use of the website, to draw up reports about the website activities for us and to supply us with other services related to website and internet use. Google can also pass on this data to third parties if that is legally required or if Google has commissioned those parties to process the data. Google will never link your IP address to other Google data. We have agreed that Google Analytics will delete the last part of the IP addresses of the visitors to our website.
