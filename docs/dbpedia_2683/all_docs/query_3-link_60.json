        "text": "Coöperatie Koninklijke Cosun U.A., including its group companies (hereinafter referred to as “Cosun”), considers the privacy and data protection of customers and visitors who acquire information via the website to be important. Cosun has therefore taken the necessary organizational and technical protective measures to protect your personal data and complies with the requirements of personal data protection legislation.\n\nAll data that Cosun gathers for the provision of our products or services is processed in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (Algemene Verordening Gegevensbescherming), which will come into force throughout the EU as of 25 May 2018. In our Privacy Policy we want to make sure that it is clear to you which personal data Cosun processes and what happens to that data. This Privacy Policy applies to all processing of your personal data by or on behalf of Cosun and provides information about our privacy policy and the technical and organizational security measures we take with regard to the personal data we may gather when you use the Cosun websites or when you contact Cosun. We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. We publish any updates on this website, so please consult them regularly for the most recent version of our Privacy Policy.\n\n1. Which personal data do we gather?\n\nDuring your use of the Cosun websites we may gather various personal data from you. This information may be provided by you, for instance if you subscribe to our messaging service, when you respond to a vacancy on the website or when you contact us for another reason. The data generated by your use of the website can also be gathered automatically. The personal data we may gather from you include your name, title, gender, date of birth, nationality, country of residence, contact details (such as your address, home telephone number and mobile telephone number, e-mail address, fax number, administrative and/or financial data, interests or preferences that you may provide, business details (such as your position, employer or client, or contract details), and information about your visit to the website (such as your IP address, provider, browser type, pages you opened on the website, time of your visit). We may also obtain certain personal data from you by using cookies. Cookies are text files that the browser ‘remembers’ and stores on your computer at the request of the website. With the help of a cookie, which acts as a memory aid, the website can remember certain information so that it does not have to be entered again.\n\n2. Why do we gather your personal data?\n\nWe mainly gather your personal data in the interests of the usual business practices of Cosun. As a cooperative we maintain contact with our members and we purchase their products. We may also use your personal data for the sale of our products and for the provision of our services, including the financial processing thereof. We may also use your data to provide you with information and to maintain our relationship with you. Your data may also be used for internal visitor analyses in order to further optimize the website. Your personal data may also be required for our own internal administrative purposes, for HR purposes, accounting audits and to comply with legal obligations. Your personal data will only be used for the purposes mentioned and described above or for purposes that are compatible with them. Cosun gathers your personal data either on the basis of your consent, or because the data is necessary for concluding an agreement, or because it has a reasonable interest as set out in this Privacy Policy or because it is legally obliged to do so.\n\n3. Who has access to your personal data?\n\nYour data will only be used to the extent necessary and then only for or on behalf of Cosun by employees or other personnel designated by Cosun. This includes personnel from all group companies or external parties insofar as these parties process data on behalf of Cosun for the purposes stated by Cosun. Cosun requires these external parties to take the same strict security measures as it has taken to protect your personal data. Insofar as your personal data are transferred outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the legal requirements for such data transfer are met. With the exception of making your personal data available to the aforementioned parties, Cosun will not make your personal data available to third parties unless it is required to do so to meet its legal obligations.\n\n4. How do we protect your personal data?\n\nCosun continually takes appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, loss, deletion, disclosure and improper use, and to monitor the accuracy and integrity of your personal data. These measures are regularly evaluated and updated where necessary.\n\n5. How long do we retain your personal data?\n\nCosun will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy. If Cosun processes personal data on the basis of your consent, then you can always revoke this consent. For instance, personal data that you provide to us in order to subscribe to our messaging service will be deleted as soon as you sign out. Data that you provide to us with the aim of obtaining information from us (for instance, an application for our annual report or other materials) is used by us once-only in order to carry out your information request. For statistical purposes, Cosun may store your personal data for longer than is strictly necessary, but it will take additional technical and organizational measures to ensure the principle of data minimization.\n\n6. How can you exercise your rights?\n\nIf you have questions about the processing of your personal data by Cosun or if you want to view your personal data that Cosun has processed or have it deleted, corrected or changed, or if you want to object to the processing or invoke your right to restriction of processing, you can contact Cosun via the contact details below. In principle, Cosun will respond to your request within one month. If you are registered for our message service but no longer wish to receive e-mails from us, you can unsubscribe via the link in the relevant mailing. If you have a complaint about the processing of personal data by or on behalf of Cosun, you can submit a complaint to the Dutch Data Protection Authority (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens).\n\n7. Links to other websites\n\nOur website contains links to websites of group companies as well as links to non-Cosun websites. The websites of group companies may contain different, specific privacy terms and conditions. In addition, external non-Cosun websites may use different privacy rules. It is your responsibility to pay attention and check this before making information available to these websites. Cosun is not responsible for the privacy rules that apply on external websites.\n\n8. Changes and contact details\n\nIt is in your interest to be aware of any changes to the privacy and information security policy of Cosun. We publish these changes on this page. If we amend this policy then we will bring this to your attention via hyperlinks."
