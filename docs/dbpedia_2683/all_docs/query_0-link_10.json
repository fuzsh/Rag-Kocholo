My Lord, HAVING solicited and obtained the honour of inscribing the follozcing Geographical pei'formatice with your name, I beg leave to express the grateful soise I retain of your countenance and patronage. Promoted by your recommendation to a respectable station in this University, I have been enabled greatly to improve the work nozv submitted to the public. Though little new ii for mat ion can be communicated in a work of this nature, yet, as it may be of use in advancing the topographical knowledge of the Globe, and in rendering the study of history more interesting and agree- able to ordinary readers, the attempt, perhaps, may not be umvorthy of your Lordship's approbation. In treating a subject of suck extent and variety, where the ma- terials were to be collected from a thousand sources, multitudes of mistakes will, no doubt, appear to you on the slightest inspection. But as these mistakes a?-e tn- volu7itary, and to be ascribed to the xvant of ability to do better, not to the want of •care and diligence, they, I flatter myself, will meet with some degree of indulgence. JFIiik 1 O^Q/l^) Jl. C C O -i .^ While I address your Lordship as the patron and encourager of Science, I cannot forbear to advert to the extraordinary talents you have exerted, with so much success, in the service of your country. In a momentous period, you were a me^nber of a Ministry, which checked the dangerous innova- tions attempted on our glorious constitution, defeated the projects of an inveterate foe against the prosperity and independence of this Empire, and rendered Great Britain the admiration and envy of Eui^ope. The important events which hap- pened during that administration, and i7i xvhich your Lordship bore so conspicu- ous a charge, are deeply engraven on the heart of every loyal subject ; and impartial history will transmit them xvilh exultation to latest posterity.

Ihe United Provinces, also called the Low Countries, and Holland, from their situation with respect to Germany, compose the northern division of the Netherlands ; and, including the Generalite lands, are bounded on the w^est and north by the German ocean, on the east by the circle of Westphalia, on the south by Austrian Brabant and Flanders ; lying between 51° 10' and 53° 35'' N. latitude, and be- tween 3° 10' and 7° 5' E. longitude from Greenwich; being 165 miles from north to south, and 100 from west to east; containing about 10,000 square miles ; formerly divided into seven provinces, and recent- ly into eight departments. Few regions have undergone more frequent and important revolutions than the Low Countries. Ancient Batavia still exists ; but the face of it is changed. Tracts formerly inhabited are now buried in the sea ; seve- ral islands are greatly diminished, and some have entirely disappeared. Vast gulphs are formed by the encroachments of the ocean, and rivers have altered their courses. Considerable districts have been gained on Vol. II. A the 2 EUROPE. the sea coasts ; but these can hardly be secured by all the efforts of hu- man industry. Climate. — The air is moist and cold, often foggy and not salubrious, except when easterly winds prevail. The changes of the weather are fre- quently sudden and violent. The spring is of shorter duration and less agreeable, the summer is hotter, and winter colder, than in England. Surface^ So'il^ ^c. — The country, in general, is level, low, and swampy, abounding in marshes and polders, or drained lakes. The soil in many districts is sand, or the muddy deposition from rivers, which when drain- ed affords excellent pasturage. Overyssel is almost wholly composed of heaths and marshes ; and the northern provinces of Friesland and Gro- ningen are covered with heaths towards the south and south east. The maritime tracts are lower than the level of the sea, from whose en- croachments they are defended by strong dykes, constructed at immense expence, and by a ridge of sand banks. To the east, hills gradually rise towards Germany. In all directions there are innumerable canals, on which commodities for consumption, or exportation, are conveyed with infinite ease from one part of the country to another, and from Holland to the Netherlands, Germany, and France. The annual profits of this inland navigation, before the late revolution, amounted to more than L. 250,000, for about 40 miles, which is L. 625 per mile ; and the square surface of those miles does not exceed two acres of ground. The canals are about 60 feet wide and six deep, without locks, the country being generally level : and they are elevated above the adjacent fields, in order to carry off the water, by which the land in winter is inundated. To drain the water from Delftland, about 200 windmills are employed in the spring, to raise it into the canals ; all of which are regularly cleansed from mud, and bordered with banks of immense thickness, to secure the country from inundation. Holland, Sir William Temple ob- serves, is a country where the earth is better than the air, and profit in more request than honour ; where there is more sense than wit, more good UNITED PROVINCES. S good nature than good humour, and more wealth than pleasure ; where a man would chuse rather to travel than to live, shall find more things to observe than desire, and more persons to estee:n than to love. Rivers, — The principal rivers are the Rhine, the Macse, and the Schelde. The Rhine, passing through the dutchy of Cleves, enters the Nether- lands at fort Schenk, where it divides into two branches. The left branch, called the Waal, passes by Nimeguen and Tiel, and loses itself in the Maese at the island of Bommel. The other, viz. the Rhine, runs west- ward on the right hand of the Waal, bathing Arnheim, Durstede, &c. in its progress to the sea. The territory included between those two branches, was the ancient island of the Batavi, about 100 Roman miles long, and 22 in its greatest breadth. Between Huessen and Arnheim a branch sets off ti3 the north east, through Drusus' canal, now called the new Yssel. At Doesburg it joins the old Yssel ; and these united streams run northward to the Zuyder-zee, anciently F/evo Laciis, that discharged itself by a river into the northern ocean. At Durstede, the principal branch of the Rhine is divided. The largest stream, called the Leek, runs W. S. W. to the Maese at Krimpen, above Rotterdam. The other takes its course towards Utrecht, where it receives the name of the Crook- ed Rhine, and thence proceeds to Leyden. The Maese, Meuse, Maas, Mosa, separates Gelderland from Brabant, forms several islands in its course westward to the sea, receiving at its aestuary the united streams of the Aa and the Domel from the south, and from the north the Waal. The Schelde, Escaut, Scaldis, at Sandolid below Antwerp, divides into two branches ; one of which named the eastern Schelde, from Ber- gen-op-zoom passes through the islands of Zealand ; and the other cal- led the Western Schelde, or Hond, separates Zealand from Flanders, and loses itself in the German ocean at Flushing. A 2 Population. 4 EUROPE. Population. — There is no country in Europe so crowded with tovnw and villages. The number of its inhabitants may amount to 2,000,000 nearly, of whom upwards of 960,000 reside in the province of Holland. Manners^ ^c. — The Dutch are constitutionally a cool and phlegma- tic people, patient, laborious, obstinate, and persevering ; but when roused by any passion, as avarice, they are capable of great exertions. The lower classes are dull and slow of apprehension, but open to con- viction : and though they cannot be brought to decide with quickness, yet they will yield to reason when they have leisure to deliberate. The commercial spirit and the influence of acquired wealth, materially aflfect the character of the middling class, composed of merchants and trades- men, and render them indifferent to all that does not concern their own interest. Of great industry and constant application to the ends they propose and pursue, they sometimes use their ingemiity and skill to take advantage of inexperience and folly ; but, in general, they are fair and honest in their transactions. The higher orders, in their customs, manners, and way of living, differ essentially from the rest of the peo- ple ; valuing themselves on their distinctions, and imitating their neigh- bours, rather than the plain manners of their own country. Notwith- standing, they are friendly, candid, strangers to fraud and deceit ; reserv- ed to those with whom they are not intimately acquainted, but sufficient- ly affiible and obliging to those they have learned to esteem and approve. Frugality and order in the management of their pecuniary affairs per- vade all degrees of men among them. It seems to be an established maxim to spend less than their annual income ; and when their expence equals their revenue, they think they have lived that year to no pur- pose. Their ruling passion, avarice or love of money, supplants every noble and generous feeling in the minds of those who are immersed in mercantile concerns, and renders them the most rigorous and tyran- nical of masters in their foreign settlements ; but at home the domestic virtues prevail in a laudable degree. Dressm UNITED PROVINCES. 5 Dress. — The coldness and moisture of the climate require a propor- tionally greater quantity of clothing than in some other countries under the same latitude : but dress in Holland is little affected by fashion. The women, especially the lower class, retain the old broad hat, the jerkins and short petticoats. Among the boors and seafaring people, large breeches are common. The gentry imitate the French, or English. The ladies, in general, display little taste ; and few of them, have just preten- sions to beauty. Their shape is disfigured by their dress ; and the of- fensive custom of putting small stoves under their petticoats, renders them feeble and infirm before they have passed the meridian of life. Regularity and cleanliness are conspicuous in the private abodes of all ranks. Streets, houses, and furniture, are constantly kept in the neatest order. No part of the globe, in this respect, can be compared with the villages of North Holland. And were it not for this Unremitting atten- tion and care, their, metals would be apt to rust, their wood to mould, and the air to corrupt during every hot season, and expose the inhabi- tants to infectious diseases. The Dutch habits of living are somewhat gross. Salted and high sea- soned meat, spirituous liquors, butter and cheese, are articles of food as well as of commerce. The principal amusements in winter are the thea- tre, and skaiting, in which both sexes display surprising dexterity. In summer, the opulent merchant and citizen enjoys his villa and garden, where flowers are cultivated with great care and at considerable expence. Products. — The soil, though unfavourable to vegetation, is well cul- tivated in some districts, and in others yields excellent pastures ; but the utmost effort of human industry has not raised grain sufficient for the support of the inhabitants. This defect, however, is amply compensat- ed by trade and navigation. Flax, tobacco, and madder are successfully propagated. Butter and cheese to a considerable amount are annually exported, together with many articles which are not the natural pro- ducts 6 EUROPE. ducts of the country. This circumstance aggrandizes in our eitimatloa the diligent and laborious natives. \" In rich and fertile regions, we are \" not surprised to find manufactures employed in multiplying the wealth \" which the bounty of the soil bestows. But to see, in a country like \" Holland, large woollen manufactures, where there are scarce any \" flocks ; numberless artists employed where there are almost no mines ; \" thousands of saw-mills where there is scarce any forest ; an immense \" quantity of grain where there is little agriculture ; is what must strike \" every attentive observer with admiration.\" Iron is found in Zutphen : the principal fuel is turf, and pit-coal imported from England and Scot- land. Manufactures and Commerce. — Among the numerous manufactures of the Dutch, are immense quantities of beautiful tiles, potter's-ware, porce- lain, tobacco pipes, borax, common salt, oil, starch, fine linen, paper, leather, woollen and cotton cloth, (Sec. An extensive inland commerce is facilitated by the Rhine, and by canals which intersect the country in every direction. The most considerable branch of inland trade, consists in vast floats of timber from the forests of Andernach, and other places on the Rhine. The sale of one raft sometimes produces L. 30,000. The herring and Greenland fisheries have been long a profitable article of trade, and still affords subsistence to many thousand families. With regard to foreign trade,, this country has been considered as the maga- zine of Europe. The Dutch East India Company has monopolized the spice trade for more than a century past : though there are no safe nor commodious sea-ports in Holland. The manufactures and trade of the United Provinces, however, have been for sometime past on the de- cline, ovv'lng to the improvement of manufactures, traffic, and naviga- tion in neighbouring countries : and, since the commencement of the late revolution on the continent, they have been almost annihilated. The manufactures being plundered by the French, the sea-ports blocked up by UNITED PROVINCES. ^ 7 by the English, and most of the foreign colonies and possessions lost, numbers of merchants and artists retired to Hamburgh and other trad- ing towns, where they were some time permitted to prosecute their employments with greater security and advantage. Religion. — The established religion, previous to the French invasion, was the Presbyterian, or Calvinism ; and the highest offices of the state were held by such as adhered to it ; but all sects were tolerated. \" No *' man having any reason to complain of oppression in conscience ; and \" no man having hopes, by advancing his religion, to form a party, or \" break in upon the state, the differences in opinion made none in s£- *' fection, and little in conversation. Men argued without interest or *' anger ; they differed without enmity or scorn ; they agreed without \" confederacy. Like citizens of the world, they lived together, associ- \" ated by the\" common ties of humanity, and by the bonds of peace, un- \" der the impartial protection of indifferent laws, with equal encourage- \" ment of all art and industry, and equal freedom of speculation and in- \" quiry.\" The church was governed by consistories, classes, and synods, from which there was an appeal to one great national synod, subject to the controul of the states- general. Every form of religion is now to- lerated, but none is protected, French men, French tenets, and French manners, prevail throughout this deluded, oppressed, ruined country. Learning. — The Universities of Leyden, Utrecht, Groningen, Har- derwyck, and Franeker, have produced many learned and eminent men in every department of science. Grotius, Erasmus, Boerhaave, Leuwen- hoek, Swammerdam, Graevius, Burmann, Hoogeveer, &c. are names mentioned with admiration and respect in the annals of literature. Government. — Before the recent revolution, the seven United Provin- ces were one political body, of whicn each member, or province, was a distinct republic, governed by its own laws. The states-general, com- posed of deputies from the provincial states, was invested with the su- preme 8 EUROPE. preme legislative power of the confederates. But that collective body could not make war or peace, nor form any new alliance, nor levy money, without the consent of every province : nor could the states provincial determine any of these points without the consent of each of the cities which had a voice in this assembly. At the head of the go- vernment was xheStadt holder^ who exercised a considerable proportion ot the executive power of the state. This officer was originally a kind of dictator, chosen by the republic in times of danger ; and he was not declared to be hereditary till William III. A. D. 1672. As this prince died without issue, the Stadtholdership was abolished by the states ; but it was restored A. D. 1747. Henry Friso, Prince of Orange, was not only created Stadtholder, but this dignity was rendei'ed hereditary, even in favour of the princesses, failing the inales of the family. The power of that officer, in recent times, has been very limited. The grand Pensionary was properly a minister, or servant, of the province, and held a place or rank behind all the deputies : notwithstanding, he had aKvays great influence, because he was a perpetual member of the states- seneral and of the secret committee. When the French declared Hoi- land a free and independent state, the name it retained was a republic, and the government established was, in reality, a vice directory under the controul of France: but, in the year 18U6, Louis, the French Em- peror's brother, was created king of Holland. The leading features in the new constitution are, — the guarrantee of the payment of the public debt ; the free and unqualified exercise of religion ; the predominant authority vested in the king ; the establislrxnent of the Salique law, for ever excluding females from the throne ; the declaration that the minori- ty of any future king shall expire upon his attaining his eighteenth year; that only natives shall be eligible to any offices of state, exclusive of those immediately appertaining to the king's household : — that the yearly revenue of the king shall be two millions of florins ; and that the royal 1 residence UNITED PROVINCES. 9 residence shall be the palaces of the Hague, in the wood, and at Soest- dyke. The council of state is to consist of thirteen members ; ihe ge- neral government of the kingdom is to be committed to four ministers of state ; and the legislative body is to be composed of thirty-eight mem- bers chosen for five years. Revenue. — The revenue of the United Provinces arose from taxes im- posed according to the abilities of each province and city. They consist- ed chiefly of a general excise, a land-tax, a poll-tax, and hearth-money, and amounted to about three millions Sterling. There were other sources of revenue, viz. 1 . The revenues of Dutch Brabant : 2. Duties on exports and imports : 3. Confiscated goods, and sums paid by trading companies. The expences of the state, exceeding the revenue, gradually increased the public debt ; and great sums have been lately paid the French for their protection. Military and Marine Strength. — In time of peace the army seldom exceeded 30,000 men ; most of whom were stationed in garrisons. In war, it was augmented by mercenary troops from Germany. In the year 1784, it consisted of 50,000. But the Dutch army is now incorporated with that of the French, and subservient to its generals. Towards the conclusion of the 17th century, more shipping for traffic and war belong- ed to Holland than to all the rest of Europe ; though that state is desti- tute of native commodities towards the building and rigging of the smal- lest vessel, and though there is not a good harbour upon the whole coast. Before the late war, the usual naval establishment consisted of 40 ships of the line, 40 frigates, and 10 cutters. But the fleets of Holland are no longer formidable, having been nearly annihilated by the English. History. — In the century preceding the Christian asra, the Battse, or Batavi, removed from their settlements in Hesse, to the marshy and thin- ly inhabited island formed by the Waal and the Rhine. To their new territory they gave the name of Batavia. That warlike nation submitted Vol. II. B to 10 EUROPE. to Caesar, who, in consideration of their important services, distinguished them by the honourable appellation of friends and brethren of the Raman people. When the Roman empire was torn in pieces by the barbarians of the north, the Franks seized on Gaul, and Batavia became a part of their ex- tensive kingdom. After the death of Charlemagne, the French monarchy was divided. Germany fell to the share of one of his grandsons ; and Batavia, having not long before received the name of Holland, was in- cluded in that allotment. In the 10th century, the German branch of the Carlovingians became extinct, and the chiefs of that country disengag- ed themselves from a foreign yoke. One of the governors of the Low Countries was styled the Forrester of Flanders^ an office originally conferred as a reward for the suppression of banditti who infested those parts, and afterwards continued in the same family for several generations. The Forresters parcelled out the country among their dependants, to whom they granted peculiar privileges. Charles the Bold made Flanders a county. ; and changed the title of For- rester into that of Count, or Earl, without interrupting the succession. This country, divided into little principalities after the manner of Ger- many, at length, by conquest, treaties, and intermarriages, fell under the dominion of the house of Burgundy. The male line in that family being extinguished, Mary, the sole heiress, A. D. 1477, transferred her domi- nions to the house of Austria. Charles V. emperor of Germany, annex- ed the other provinces of the Low Countries to his empire. In the reign of his son Philip II. seven of the provinces revolted, A. D. 1566, and, in 1579, formed the famous union of Utrecht. After a violent struggle for liberty, they were declared a free and independent state, A. D. 1648, by the treaty of Munster. The other ten provinces continued subject to the crown of Spain till the death of Charles II. A. D. 1700, when they were transferred to the German line of the Austrian family, except those territories which had been conquered by France, and these united to the Seven UNITED PROVINCES. ] 1 Seven Provinces. In 1747, the stadtholderate v^^as declared hereditaiy. The war in 1756 opening great connections between France and Holland' a French party in the country was formed in opposition to the stadthold- er who was supported by the English. In 1780 war broke out between Great Britain and Holland, and terminated in 1784 to the disadvantage of the latter ; which was subdued by the Duke of Brunswick, A. D. 1788. In 1794 the French, having over-run the greater part of Flanders, took possession of Holland. The stadtholder found refuge in England, and the allied army retreated to Germany. Towards the end of summer 1799, a detachment of British troops vv^as embarked for the recovery of the United Provinces. Having seized the batteries at the Helder point and on the Texel island, they made themselves masters of the whole Dutch fleet in the Texel harbour. Joined by a considerable body of Russian troops, the army amounted to 45,000 men under the com- mand of the Duke of York. But after several sviccesses, the avowed object of this expedition was abandoned, and his royal highness returned with his troops to England. By the treaty concluded at Amiens, March 27th 1802, his Britannic Majesty restored to the Batavian republic all the possessions and colonies, which had been either occupied or conquered by the British forces, with the exception of the Dutch possessions in the island of Ceylon, which the Batavian republic ceded and guarranteed in full property and sovereignty to his Britannic Majesty. The port of the Cape of Good Hope remained to the Batavian republic in full sovereign- ty, in the same manner as it did previous to the v\\'&r. But soon after the recommencement of hostilities with France, a British squadron took pos- session of the Cape, and the Dutch colonies in that quarter. Maps. — The atlas of the provinces is in some estimation. Wiebeking's Holland and Utrecht was published A. D. 1796, in eight sheets. The map of N. Holland in 16 sheets has been reduced to four. The Seven United Provinces, with Drent and the Generalite lands, by Faden, in 1794, is a B 2 , map 12 EUROPE. map of considerable merit. Robert's map of those provinces is incorrect ; that of Bonn in the new edition of the French Encyclopsedla is more ac- curate. There are maps of every province by De Witt, and other geo- graphers. Batavia is treated of as a portion of Germania Secunda. The principal divisions of this country are, at present, the same as they were during the republic ; namely, Gelderland, or Guelderland, Holland, Zealand, Utrecht, Friesland, Overyssel, Gronlngen ; besides the Texel and other islands. The eight departments into which the whole country, including most part of Batavia, has been recently divided, retain the names of the provinces,^ and their extent nearly. I. GELDERLAND. This province, also called North, or Lovper Gelderland, to distinguish it from Upper Gelderland in the circle of Westphalia, is bounded on the west bv Holland and Utrecht, on the north by the Zuyder-zee and Over- yssel, on the east and south by Over^'Ssel, Westphalia, and Brabant ; ly- ing in 52° N. latitude ; of a very irregular form, being 30-40-50 miles from north to south, and 30-50-75, from west to east. The soil of this province is tolerably fertile, yielding oats, barley, hemp, and tobacco, except the middle of the Veluwe, which is sandy and barren. It is watered by the Maese, the Rhine, the Yssel, the Waal, and other less streams, which traverse it in different directions. Many patches are covered with woods. Divided into three districts, viz. Nimmegen, Zut- phen, and Arnheim, it contains 1840 square miles, upwards of 20 market towns, and, according to some computations, 200,000 inhabitants. 1. The district of A7ffz/;;^^^w, fertile and populous, comprehends the south part of the province between the Maese and the Rhine j 7-10 miles from north to south, and 23 from west to east. Nimmegen, GELDERLAND.J UNITED PROVINCES. 13 Nimmegen, Novlomagum, the capital of the district, is an ancient, coa- siderable, irregularly built, fortified, trading town, containing 12,000 in- habitants, on an aclivity bathed by the Waal, near the border of the dutchy of Cleves, 1 3 leagues S. E. of Utrecht, 20 S. E. of Amsterdam, 26 N. E. of Antwerp. Several of the streets are steep, and the windows of one range of houses sometimes overlook the chimnies of another. The fortifications are too extensive to withstand a vigorous siege, and require a numerous garrison. This town entered into an alliance with Utrecht in 1579. The Spaniards again made themselves masters of it in 1585; but it was retaken by Maurice in 1591. Here a treaty was negotiated and concluded, in 1678 and 1679, between France, Holland, Spain, and Ger- many. On the east side of the town, within the walls, Charlemagne built a palace, which Godfrey, duke of Lower Lorrain, destroyed in 1046. The road thence N. \\V. to Utrecht lies one-third of the way through sands. Tiel, or Thiel, is an ancient, small, trading town with narrow streets, the native place of John Posselius an eminent divine, pleasantly situate in a fertile tract, on the one side bounded by the Waal, and on the other by a marsh ; seven leagues westward of Nimmegen, and three N. E. of Bommel. This place submitted to Turenne in 1672, and in the same year was dismantled by the French. It is now greatly decayed. Bommel^ or Salt-Bommel, is a trading town containing 2700 inhabitants, on the left bank of the Waal, about seven leagues S. S. E. of Utrecht. The fortifications were demolished by the French in 1673 ; but were after- wards repaired. Its trade is on the decline, its port being choked up by a sand bank. The island of Bommel-waard, formed by the Waal and the Maese, contains several villages. There are six bailiwicks, called Amtmanschappen^ in the district of Nimmegen, or Nimmeguen. That of Nimmegen properly so called, ly- ing between the Waal and the Maese, contains several villages and seats. The heath of Mooker near Maiden, is famous for the defeat of some German 14 EUROPE. German forces by the Spaniards, A. D. 1574, and for being the place of rendezvous to the whole of the confederate army under Marlborough, in the year 1702. Maas-waal, S. W. of Ninimegen, contains Batenburg, a country town with a castle, on the right hand of the Maese, 1 1 miles from the capital ; with several lordships. The whole tract between the Rhine and the Waal, traversed from east to west by the Ling, is called Betwwe^ a portion of insula Batavorum, divided into Eastern or Upper, and Western or Lower Betuwe. In the former are the ruins of a strong fort constructed by General Schenk, A. D. 158^\\ on the island of Gra- venwaard, at the separation of the Waal from the Rhine. At the village of Pannerden, or Panderen, is the commencement of the new canal, cal- led Panderschegat, formed in 1702, through which the Rhine at present flows. In Lower Betuwe there are eight or nine lordships, and several villages, chiefly seated near the bank of the Rhine. The next bailiwick consists of two parts, viz. Tieler and Bommeler-waard, separated from each other by the Waal, and containing upwards of 20 lordships and many villages. Among the latter are Thiel, or Tiel, already mentioned ; fort St Andrew, a regular pentagon, built by Cardinal Andrea of Austria, six miles S. W. of Tiel, at the junction of the Waal and the Maese ; and the remains of fort Voorn, or Nassau, environed by those rivers, but demolished by the French in 1G72. Between these forts lies the village of Herwaarden. The small bailiwick of Beest, watered by the Linge, contains an inconsiderable decayed town, and the village of Re- noy, four or five leagues W. of Tiel. The counties of Btiren and Kuilenburg, on the south border of the province of Utrecht, do not properly belong to Gelderland : yet, on ac- count of their vicinity, they may with propriety be mentioned here. The former v.'as separated from Gelderland by a dyke called Aalsdyk, reaching from Lettendyk to the Linge, and is, for the most part, a fertile tract ; containing BtireHy a small» neatly built town, fortified with a ram- 1 part CELDERLAND.] UNITED PROVINCES. 15 part and fosse of eartii, on the right hand of the Linge, two leagues N. W. of Tiel ; Beusichem, and other villages. The castle of Buren, sepa- rated from the town by a grove of trees, is a place of some strength. The lower parts of the latter are liable to inundations, and iit for pasture only. Kuilenburg is a small trading town, consisting of three parts, each of which is environed by a wall and moat, two leagues N, W. of Buren, on the border of the province of Utrecht. In that neighbourhood are several neat villages. 2. The district, or county of Zulphen^ forms the S. E. part of Gelder- land, and is divided from the Veluwe by the river Yssel. Along the old and new Yssel the soil is abundantly fertile, but the eastern part of the district is full of heaths and morasses. Zutphen^ Zutphania, the capital, consisting of about 1270 houses, is a well built, fortified town, situate in a fenny and sometimes inundated tract, on the right bank of the Yssel, near the influx of the Berkel, 17 miles N, E. of Arnheim, and seven S. of Deventer. It contains an aca- demy founded A. D. 1G86 : but the palace is demolished. This town has been frequently besieged and taken, Doesburgy a small fortified town, near the conflux of the old and new Yssel, between Zutphen and Arnheim, 15 miles N. E. of Nimmegen. Deiitlkem^ a little town of 300 houses, formerly fortified, on the old Yssel, three leagues S. E. of Doesburg. Lochem^ a town containing about 2000 inhabitants, on the Berkel, N. W. of a cognominal hill, and three leagues eastward of Zutphen. la 1672, it was taken by the French, who razed its fortifications. Groll^ a thoroughfare from Germany to the Low Countries, and a little town, whose fortifications were demolished by the French, on the Slink a branch of the Berkel, upwards of six leagues S. E. of Zut- phen. This 16 EunopE. This county likewise contains four amts, /. e. bailiwicks, or jurisdic- tions, in each of which are several villages and seats, as Bronkhorst for- merly a town, but almost desolated during the Spanish wars ; the Voorst house at Almen, near Zutphen, built by William III. who conferred it on the Earl of Albemarle, &c. The lordships of Berkelo, Lichtenvoorde, Bredevoort, Wisch and Heerenberg, which contain several little towns and villages, viz. the town of Berkelo consisting of 250 houses, on a cog- nomial river, four leagues eastward of Zutphen, near the border of Overyssel ; Lichtenvoorde, a little town and seat, several leagues S. S. E. of Berkelo, not far from the confines of Munster ; Brewoorde, a small fortified town, surrounded by a marsh, in the S. E. corner of Gelder- land ; Burg, an inconsiderable place with a seat, near the Old Yssel, four leagues S. E. of Doesburg ; Heerenberg, or Berg, a little town and seat, a few leagues S. of Doesburg, near the border of the dutchy of Cleves. S. Arnheim district, or the Veluwe, is separated from the foregoing districts by the Ysscl and the Rhine, and bounded on the north by the Zuyderzee. Towards the middle the soil is sandy and barren, but the borders of the rivers are abundantly fertile. It contains 14 bailiwicks. Arjiheim^ Arnhem or Arnem, Arenacum, Arnhemia, the capital of the district, is an ancient, tolerably built, and indifferently fortified town, containing upwards of 1100 houses, 11 leagues eastward of Utrecht, and almost three N. of Nimmegen, at the foot of the Veluwe hills, on the Rhine, about three miles below the place where this river and the Yssel divide their streams. It was taken by Louis XIV. in 1672 ; and forti- fied by the celebrated Coehorn in 1 702. It is the native place of Chris- topher Brouwer a Jesuit, and is famous foi- a treaty concluded there in 1678—9. Wageningen^ Vado, a small town, meanly fortified, in a marshy tract on the right hand of the Rhine, 1 1 miles below, z. e. westward of Arn- heim, near the S. E. extremity of the province of Utrecht. Between this GELDERLAND.] UNITED PROVINCES. > 17 this place and Arnheini are two forts built by the Huns in the ICth cen- tury, and called the Hunnen and Schansen. Harderwyck^ Harderovicum, is an ancient, tolerably built, fortified, trading town, containing 800 houses, and the seat of an university founded A. D. 1648, on the coast of the Zuyder-zee, nine leagues N. N. W. of Arnheim, and 13 E. of Amsterdam. The inhabitants trade in corn, wood, and red-herrings. Hatteniy an ancient and small town, is situate in the north corner of Gelderland, on the left bank of the Yssel, a few miles from Zwol. In 1672 the French took it, and demolished the fortifications. In 178G, the inhabitants refused to acknowledge a burgo-master appointed by the Stadtholder, upon which a body of troops took and plundered the place, by the desire of the states of Gelderland. Tobacco is cultivated in its vicinity. Elbiirg^ a little town of 300 houses, with a harbour on the Zuyder- zee, four leagues W. of Hattem. This place was taken by the French in 1672. Its ramparts are planted with trees. In the district of Veluwe are several handsome villages ; as, Lunteren, Barneveld, Nieuwkirk, &c. and the whole country is agreeably diversi- fied with seats. The Richeramt, or jurisdiction of Veluwe-Zoom, is a rich and fertile tract along the Rhine and the Yssel ; containing the village of Spanker- en, with a fine seat; EUekom, a village near whicli is a handsome seat: and on a neighbouring eminence stands Rouwenberg, a hunting seat built by William III. The fort of Ysseloort, in the angle where the Yssel quits the Rhine, was long ago demolished. Near Arnheim there is a delightful seat called Klaarenbeck ; and a few iniles northward is Rozande, a pleasant spot, remarkable for being the site of the famous convent of Mariendaal. The lordship of Zoo, nearly in the centre of Veluwe, contains an ele- gant cognominal seat and gardens, in the vicinity of Appledoorn ; 13 Vol. II. C leagues 18 EUROPE. leagues E. N. E. of Utrecht, and 3 N. W. of Zutphen ; Doornenburg-, a seat in a lordship of the same name, watered by the Rhine. The seat and elegant gardens of Rozendaal, in a cognorninal lordship, belong to the family of Tork. Veluwe, surrounded by a strip of fertile soil, has been compared to a thread-bare coat with a rich border. Upper Gelderla7id, also called the Upper Quarter, or the Quarter of Roermonde, is detached from Lower Gelderland, and bounded by the dutchy of Cleve, the county of Meurs, the archbishopric of Cologne, the bishopric of Liege, and the dutchies of Juliers and Brabant. It former- ly belonged to the crown of Spain, but, by the peace of Utrecht, part of it was ceded to Austria, and part to Prussia, and guarranteed to them by the treaty of Baden in 1714. By the Barrier Treaty in 1715, the states general of the united provinces likewise obtained a part j so that Upper Gelderland was divided into Austrian, Prussian, and Dutch Gelderland. The Austrian division included Roermonde and its district ; the Dutch part comprehended the lordships of Venlo and Stevenswert. To Prus- sian Gelderland belonged the districts of Gelders, Kessel, Crickenheek,^ Wachtendonk, and Strahlen.. 2. HOLLAND. Holland^ the largest, most populous, and best cultivated of the seven provinces, is bounded on the west and north by the German ocean, on the east by the Zuyder-zee, Utrecht, and Gelderland, on the south by Brabant ; lying between 51° 37' and 53° 20' N. latitude, and betweea 3° 40' and 5° 5' E. longitude from Greenwich ; extending 120 miles from north to south ; but of very unequal breadth, being deeply indented by the province of Utrecht and the Zuyder-zee. According to the com- putation of some geographers, it contains 2000 square miles, and 960,000 inhabitants. HOLLAND.] UNITED PROVINCES. 19 , A considerable proportion of this country, lying below the surface of the sea, is secured by dykes against inundations, and intersected by in- numerable ditches and canals. The air is insalubrious. The soil is thin and marshy, abounding in rich pastures, except in the middle districts, which consist almost entirely of turf grounds. The principal rivers are, the Maese on the south, the Rhine in the middle, the Leek between the Maese and the Rhine, on the north the Vecht and Amstel, which lose themselves in the Y. These rivers and smaller streams are joined by navigable canals, which open an easy com- munication between the several towns and villages of this province. Holland is divided into North Holland, or West Friesland, and South Holland. 1. South Holland extends from Brabant to the Wyker-meer and the Y, near Amsterdam. On the west coast there is no harbour ; and a ridge of sand banks forms a naturalbarrier against inundations of the sea: the eastern boundary is deeply indented by the provinces of Utrecht and Gelderland. Cities. — Dort, or Dordrecht, Dordracum, or Dordrechtum, is an an- cient, well built, walled, populous, trading town, the seat of the mintage for South Holland, the birth place of Paul Merula, John de Wit, Junius, Vossius, and other learned men. It is situate on the N. W. extremity of an island formed by the Merwe, the Bies-bos, and the Kill, with a commodious harbour, 14 miles S. E. of Rotterdam ; and contains 19,000 inhabitants. The situation of this place is naturally so strong, that, though destitute of fortifications, it has never yet been taken. It is famous for a synod held here in 1618 and 1619. The tract on which it stands was separated from the main land, A. D. 1421, by an inunda- tion, which destroyed 72 villages, with about 100,000 persons. Haarlem is a large, tolerably built, manufacturing town, environed by an old brick wall ; containing upwards of 20,000 inhabitants; 12 miles C 2 \\V. of \"20 EUROPE. W. of Amsterdam, 154- N. of Leyden, and about three from an extensive lake called Haarlem-meer. It is a place of little trade, with broad and regular' streets. The palace, the public library, the medicinal garden, and the house of Laurence Coster to whom the invention of the art of print- ing is ascribed, are worthy of notice. The academy of sciences was founded A. D. 1752. The organ in the great church is one of the finest in Europe. It has 8000 pipes, and was constructed in 1738. This town has been remarkable for variety of fortunes in time of war, and for its flourishing manufactures of velvets, damasks, worsted stuffs, &c. ia time of peace. It was consumed by fire in 1347, 1351, and 1587. In 1571 it submitted to the Prince of Orange ; and after a memorable siege, in 1573, it was taken by the Spaniards. In the neighbourhood of the town there are several handsome seats, with a wood cut out into de- lightful walks and vistas. Haarlem-lake, also called the sea of Leyden, including several small lakes connected with it, contains about 15 square leagues of surface, and is ten feet mean depth. De/ftj Delphi, the birth place of Heinsius, Grotius, &c. is a regular^ well built town, in the form of an oblong square, consisting of about 4800 houses, nine miles N. W. of Rotterdam, and five S. of Hague. Two spacious parallel streets, with broad canals, form the most considerable part of the town. In this place is the principal arsenal of the province, except that the magazine of powder is at the distance of a mile from it, near the- canal to Rotterdam, The chief manufactures are a species of earthea ware and tobacco pipes. In the great church is a magnificent tomb,, erected in memory of William I. Prince of Orange, who was murdered in the palace, A. D. 1584 ; and its fine steeple has a remarkable set of chimes, consisting of about 500 bells, disposed on the outside of the spire. In the old church are monuments of Admirals Tromp and Hein. This town, situate in the midst of delightful meadows, withstood a long siege in 1359 ; and was almost entirely destroyed in 1536. Delfs/iavcn HOLLAND.] UNITED PROVINCES. 21 Delf shaven is a small market town, containing 1390 inhabitants, and is a place of sonae trade, \\-vith a harbour on the Maese, a mile below Rot- terdam, at the extremity of the canal of Delft constructed in 1389. Thence many vessels annually depart for the herring fishery. This town is situate among meadows ; and canals, planted with trees, run through its streets. Lityden, Lugdunum Batavorum, and more anciently Leigdunum ad Rhenum in Batavorum insula and Germaniarum Caput, is a large, re- gular city, with broad streets intersected by canals, containing upwards of 30,000 inhabitants ; 27 miles S. S. W. of Amsterdam, ten N. N. E. of Hague, and four from the sea coast. It is the birth place of Scaliger, and of John Bockolt a tailor, who, in 1534, placed himself at the head of the Baptists, and assumed the title of King of Munster in Westphalia. The stadthouse is a large and inelegant edifice. The celebrated university, •whose library contains many curious MSS. was founded in 1575. In the old castle, on an eminence, there is a maze or labyrinth. The ma- nufactures of cloth, serge, and cambric, have been on the decline for se- veral years. In 1574 this city sustained a severe siege from the Spaniards, during which famine and pestilence carried off 6000 of the inhabitants : and, in 1795, with the rest of Holland, it fell into the hands of the French. The environs are agreeably diversified with gardens, naeadows, and seats. The celebrated Rembrandt was born A. D. 1606, about four miles from Leyden, between the villages of Leyderdorp and Koukerk, where his father was a miller. The adjacent country may be inundated. The canal between Leyden and Haarlem is bordered with sandy downs and meadows on the left, and with turf pits and a lake on the right ; so that this stage is barren of objects. Amsterdam, one of the most elegant, opulent, flourishing, commercial cities in Europe, is situate in a marshy tract, on the common boundary of North and South Holland, at the influx of the Amstel into the Y, or Wye, 22 EUROPE. Wye, two leagues from the Zuyder-zee, 17 from Rotterdam, 13 from Hague, 61 N. of Bruxelles, 51 N. of Antwei-p. In the beginning of the 13th century it was a mean fishing village. In 1490, it was sur- rounded by a wall. In 1512, it was in vain besieged by the people of Gelderland ; but, in 1578, it was taken by the Hollanders after a siege of 10 years. From this period its increase was very rapid, in consequence of several thousand families removing hither from Antwerp, after the conquest of that place in 1575. In 1675, it was enlarged to its present extent, and fortified. Built in the form of a crescent, it is nine miles in circuit, containing about 212,000 inhabitants. Towards the land it is defended by a great number of bastions, and a broad deep ditch, and is Intersected by innumerable navigable canals bordered with rows of trees. The streets in general are naiTow but well-paved, and the houses are of brick or stone. There are many magnificent public edifices. The guild- hall or stadt-house, built in 1648-1655, is founded on 13,659 piles. It is 282 feet long, 235 broad, and 157 high. Beneath it is a vault wherein is kept the bank, which contains a vast quantity of ingots both of gold and silver, with large sums of money. In the second story is a magazine of arms. The principal church, founded on 6263 piles, is 315 feet long, and 210 broad. The exchange, founded on 2000 piles, A. D. 1608, and built of freestone, is 250 feet long, and 1 40 broad. The synagogue of Portuguese Jews is an elegant building. The admiralty, at the N. E. end of the city, was formerly a palace of the Prince of Orange. The arsenal for men of war is a handsome structure, 200 feet in length, containing great quantities of military stores and many curiosities. In the new part of the city is a magazine 2000 feet square. There are many bridges across the canals. The Pont-neuf, or new bridge, composed of 36 arches is upwards of 600 feet in length, and 70 in breadth. The harbqur, about half a league in length and a mile in breadth, is of difficult access, but se- cure, being protected by a double row of piles, joined by beams placed horizontally. HOLLAND.] UNITED PROVINCES. 2S horizontally. The openings left at certain distances to admit ships, are shut at night. At the commencement of 1795, this city submitted to the French. The neighbouring territory may be inundated. It is full sea at three o'clock, on the days of new and full moon. Gouda^ or Tergouw, is a considerable town, situate on the Gouw, near the influx of this river into the Yssel, 12 miles N. N. E. of Rotterdam, on the road to Utrecht. It is noted for the manufacture of tobacco-pipes. In St John's church are admirable paintings on glass. The records of the province are kept at this place. The adjacent country may be laid under water, which is the only security of the town in the event of an attack. Rotterdam^ the birth-place of Erasmus, is a large, well-built, populous, trading town, containing 50,000, or, according to other accounts, 60,000 inhabitants ; pleasantly situate at the influx of the Rother into the Maese or Merwe ; nine miles S. E. of Delft, 14 S. S. E. of Hague, 51 S. of Am- sterdam, and 79 N. of Bergen-op-zoom. There are several elegant pub- lic buildings. The stadthouse is an old brick edifice with a peaked roof. The exchange, finished in 1736, is a handsome quadrangular stone build- ing. On the bridge across the Maese there is a fine brass statue of Eras- mus, who was a native of this place. From the tower of the cathedral there is an extensive prospect. The Boomquay street, upwards of half a mile along the bank of the river, almost surpasses imagination. It has a row of lofty trees, and the houses resemble palaces ; on the other side is the river, near a mile and a half broad, where ships are continually sailing in or out, or lying at anchor. Besides an academy of sciences in- stituted in 1771, there are warehouses of the East India Company, many churches, a board of admiralty, with dock yards and storehouses belong- ing thereto, &c. The harbour, divided into three basons, is commodious; and ships of the greatest burden can go into the midst of the town by means of deep canals. The trade carried on, especially with Great Bri- tain, is very extensive. What Rome is to the antiquary, Rotterdam is 24 EUROPE. to the merchant. Its streets, markets, and quays, are crowded with active industry. It has high water, at spring-tides, about 3^ o'clock. Schiedam is a town consisting of 1500 houses, of which 300 are used for distilUng gin, six miles westward of Rotterdam, on the Merwe, at the mouth of the Schie. It contains about 8000 inhabitants. In the environs are many juniper-trees. Vlaardhigai, formerly called Flerditinga and Phladitinga, a small town below, or west of Schiedam, with a safe harbour, which was enlarged in 1734. The principal article of trade is herring. Schoonbovcn is a fortified trading town of 600 houses, on the river Leek, at the influx of the Vliet, with a capacious harbour, three leagues S. S. E. of Gouda, and six E. of Rotterdam. In the great church is the sepulchral monument of Olivier Van Noord, who circumnavigated the globe. This place is noted for its trade, salmon fishery, paper manufac- tures, and expert silversmiths. In the neighbourhood are many fine gar- dens and seats. Its environs may be laid under water. Briel, or Brillc, is a regularly built, fortified town of 1000 houses, con- taining 4000 inhabitants, chiefly fishermen and pilots, six leagues W. of Rotterdam, near the mouth of the Maese, on the small island of Borne, or Voorn, with a spacious and convenient harbour. It is the native place of Admiral Van Trompe, Vice-Admiral de Witt, Neostadius, and other eminent men : but its trade is inconsiderable. At spring-tides, it is high water there near two o'clock. Naerden, founded in 1350, and the bulwark of Amsterdam, is a neat - fortified town, consisting of about 480 houses, on the south coast of the Zuyder-zee, about 13 miles east of the capital, with which it has a com- munication by a canal that passes through Muyden. It is celebrated for the cruelties exercised there by the Duke of Alva, A. D. 1572, and for its manuf?xtures of cloth and velvet. Its environs are of a sandy soil.

The most beautiful part of tlie village is Vyver-burg ; where on one side is an elegant row of houses, and on the other a large bason of water. The palace, during the stadt- holdcr's residence there, contained a fine collection of paintings and natu- ral curiosities. The French church is noted for being the burial-place of several counts of Holland. In its vicinity there is a fine garden in imita- tion of that at Vauxhall. Towards the east and south are verdant mea- dows and handsome seats. To the north is a wood in which Frederick Henry built an elegant seat ; and westward, an avenue or promenade 24 feet broad, paved with bricks, and bordered with rows of trees, extends two and a half miles to the village of Scheveling containing about 200 houses, on the sea-coast. This village, several times damaged by the sea, is inhabited by fishermen and pubhcans. In South Holland are the following bailiwicks, each of which has its own tribunal for the trial of causes. 1. Gooiland^ or Gofland, a sandy and heathy tract, on the Zuyder-zee, in the vicinity of Naarden, contains the villages of Huisen on the coast j Hilversum, whose inhabitants are chiefly manufacturers ; Graveland, full of seats ; Muiderberg, &c. 2. Loosdrecht is a small heathy territory, watered by the Vecht. Loosdrecht and Loenen are inconsiderable villages. Near the latter is Kronenburg, a seat frequently mentioned in the history of the counts of Holland. 3. The Amstelland, consisting of meadows and heaths, lies on the Am- stel, south of Amsterdam, containing the villages of Ouderkirk, Diemen and Amstleveen, with the polders of Diemer and Beilmer. 4. Kcnnemerland, on the German ocean, is divided into north and south. The latter only belongs to South Holland, and includes Sparen- dam, Sloten, Zantvoort, Bloemendaal, and other villages. 5. Rhdnland^ lying along both shores of the Old Rhine, is the largest D 2 district 28 EUROPE. district in South Holland. It consists chiefly of turf lands, containing Oude or Old Wetering, a village on a canal ; Oudshoorn, at the junction of the Wetering and Old Rhine ; Rhynsburg, formerly noted for its Benedictine nunnery ; Sassenheim, noted for Teilingen-house often men- tioned in history ; Noordwyk-op-zee, where formerly stood the abbey of Leeuwenhorst. Katwyk-op-Rhyn, and Katwyk-op-zee, two villages and lordships. Near the site of the latter, Caligula built Arx Britannica at the mouth of the Rhine, and the most frequented port for England, but long ago swallowed up by the sea. 6. Wocrren, or Woerden, consists of fine meadow lands in the neigh- bourhood of the town of Woerden. 7.

A considerable part of this village was destroyed by the sea, A. D. 1574. Loosdtilnen, a neat village, about five miles from Hague, and half a mile from the sea-coast, from which it is separated by hills of sand. In the church of this village are the two fonts in which the SQ5 children of Mar- garet of Hennesberg are said to have been baptized A. D. 1276. This story of the countess of Hennesberg, though mentioned with gravity by Erasmus, is absurd, unless it be supposed that the imprecation was de- nounced on the third day of January. Off-Tcr-Heide, a village on the sea-coast, near which a bloody engagement between the English and Dutch fleets happened in the year 1653. Gravesandc^ a handsome village, an- ciently noted for a seat of the counts of Holland, on the sand downs near the coast. In digging up some old foundations, A. D. 1546, several cu- rious earthen vessels v/ere found, supposed to be 1400 years old. The adjacent HOLLAND.] UNITED PROVINCES. 29 adjacent country produces excellent wheat and grass. Near this place stood the ancient palace of the lords of Polan, which, with several neigh- bouring castles, were burnt by the people of Delft in 1359. Naaldwyk^ containing the magnificent palace of Hondflaardyk, near the mouth of the Maese, about five leagues westward of Rotterdam. Rj/sw'icky a pleasant village, two miles from the Hague, with a palace of William III. called the House of Neubourg in its vicinity. This place is famous for a treaty of peace concluded here A.

Maasland^ a neat village, southward of Delft, above the mouth of the Maese. In the south-west part of Holland are several considerable islands. 1. Voorn^ or East Voorn, isan island about 17 miles in length and five in breadth, lying between the Maese and Haringvliet, a broad stream coming from the Biesbosch canal. This island contains Hcenvliet^ a little town on the north coast ; and Helvoetsluys, a small but strong town on the south coast, 10 miles frorii the open sea. The fronts of the houses in this town are pointed once a-year, and the streets are paved with clink- ers. The entrance to the harbour is between two piers supported by piles ; and it is divided by a flood-gate from the bason, where ships ride in great safety. Hence packets sail to Harwich in England. 2. The island of South Voorn, or Over Flacque, of an oval form, lies south of the preceding, and contains several considerable and populous villages, as Meliszand, Dirksland, Harkinge, &c. 3. West Voorn ^ or Goeree, is a small island of an oval form, the S. W. part of Holland, two leagues S. \\V. of Helvoetsluys. It is separated from Schouwen by a shallow channel, and joined to Over-Flackee by a sand bank. It contains a small town of the same name, and Outdorp a village. The harbour is choked up, but the road is tolerable. 4. The ^0 EUROPE. 4. The small island of Putt en, eastward of Voorn, is environed by the Maese, the Bornisse, and the Spuy ; containing Geervliet, a little, open, regular town, and several villages. 5. Beierland, and Streyen, form one island, called the Hocksche-waard, separated frorii Putten and Voorn by a small stream. In the year 1421, this country was overflown and almost destroyed. Old Beierland, New Beierland, and Streyen, are villages of little note. Along the eastern boundary of Streyen is the common passage from Holland to Brabant. G. Tssehnonde is an island opposite to Rotterdam, between the old and new Maese, containing a small town of the same name, tv>^o elegant seats, and several villages. It is 1 2 miles from west to east, and 2 — 6 in breadth. 1. Rosetihurg, a liitle island in the midst of the Maese, was first dyked A. D. 1586. In it is the village of Blankenburg. 8. Goudswaard, an inconsiderable island, contains a village in the neighbourhood of Putten. The remaining districts of the south part of Holland, by some geo- f^raphers more particularly called South Holland, are as follows, viz. 1 . The island of Dordrecht, a fragment of the isle of South Holland which was swallowed up A. D. 1421, is bounded by the Maese, Bies- bosch, and the Kill, five leagues S. E. of Rotterdam. It contains a town of the same name, and the village of Dubbledam. Two miles eastward of Dordrecht are the remains of the ancient castle of Merwed. 2. The Alhlasser-'waard lies between the river Merwe and the Leek, on the east bounded by Gorcum and Vianen. It consists chiefly of pas- tures, and contains about 16 villages. .3. The Krimpener-ivaard, east of Rotterdam, between the Leek and Yssel, is a plain covered with hemp and pastures. In it is a small cog- nominal town and several villages. 4.

Viafien is a town consisting of 450 houses, in a cognominal lord- ship, on the Leek, near the border of the province of Utrecht. It was taken, A. D. 1672, by the French, who demolished its fortifications. To the westward are some ruins of the castle of Batestein. This lordship contains a handsome seat and several villages. The following lordships lie within the pi'ecincts of Holland : 1. The county of Leerdam, consisting of pasture grounds, near the S. W. border of Utrecht. Its small, regular, and well built town, of the same name, is seated on the Linge, nine leagues E. of Rotterdam. 2.

At the south extremity of Holland, on the border of Brabant, lie the town and lordship of Zevefibergen, l-i league S. E. of Klundert, and three N. W. of Breda. Before the inundation, A. D. 1421, this was a place of some note. North Holland, or West Friesland, is a peninsula on all sides sur- rounded by the North and Zuyder seas, except on the south, where it is connected with South Holland by a narrow isthmus between the north sea and Wyker-meer. This country is covered with rich pastures, ele- gant gardens, handsome towns and villages. Most of the houses are built of brick, and in cleanliness and neatness exceed those in every other country. The rooms and furniture are kept in the nicest order. The streets, paved whh brick, are carefully washed, and strewed with a fine white sand. Every wooden utensil, both within and without, even to the gates in the roads, and the posts in the inclosures, are painted. The principal articles of trade are excellent cheese, butter, and herrings. In the middle age, this province was separated from East Friezland by a considerable lake called Flevo, which contained a small island, and had a communication with the northern ocean by a river near 50 Ro- man miles in length ; but, by an encroachment of the sea, the extensive tract bordering on that lake and river, has been converted into a deep gulph, called the Zuyder-zee, between which and the ocean are several islands. Cities^ yc. — Alkmaar, or Al-meer, so called from the lakes with which it was originally environed, is an ancient, regular, elegantly built, 1 trading HOLLAND.] UNITED PROVINCES. 33 trading town, containing about 8000 inhabitants, pleasantly situate near the centre of the province ; seven leagues N. of Amsterdam ; intersected by canals, and surrounded with gardens, meadows, and seats. Ti Js town, once reckoned among the fortresses of Holland, held out a seven weeks siege against the Spaniards^ A. D. 1673. Its environs are noted for ex- cellent butter, cheese, and tulips. Here a treaty was signed after the de- feat of the Duke of York A. D. 1799. Hoorn, so called from its port whose form resembled a horn, is a well built, but indifferently fortified, trading town, and the native place of Adrian Junius, containing 9000 inhabitants, on the coast of the Zuyder- zee, with a convenient harbour ; six leagues N. N. E. of Amsterdam, and four E. of Alkmaar. Here the deputies of North Holland assemble, and many ships of war and merchants vessels are built. The environs are agreeable, and diversified with villages, gardens, and seats. A canal extends from this place westward to Alkmaar. Enkhuisen is a neatly built, fortified town, not so populous as Hoorn, with a harbour on the Zuyder-zee, ten miles N. E. of that place. To- wards the sea it is secured by a sand bank dangerous to large ves- sels. The herring trade was formerly more considerable here than at present. It is high water along that coast, at spring tides, about 12 o'clock. Edam Is a small, well built town, on the west coast of the Zuyder-zee, at the mouth of the Ey, with a good harbour, 3- leagues N. N. E. of Amsterdam. It contains about 4000 inhabitants, and was formerly noted for its cheese trade. The adjacent territory, once a lake, is now a polder.

W. of Enkhuisen, and 34- N. of Hoorn, on the north coast of a pe- mnsule that projects into the Zuyder-zee. The harbour is convenient and safe. This place is thought to have been the residence of the kings of Friesland ; and here are the best dykes in Holland. The environs yield rich pastures. Considerable quantities of wood are imported here from Norway.. Piirmerend is a market town of about 600 houses, in 1572 environed by a rampart ; a few miles westward of Edam at the extremity of Pul~ mer-polder*. Its large and ancient castle was demolished A. D, 1741» The amts or bailiwicks of North Holland are as follows : 1 . North Kennemerland^ including the Lange-meer, is bounded on the south by Wyker-meer, and on the west by the North sea, or German ocean, watered by the Kil and the Zaan.

Velsen, a village on the same lake, near the ruins of Broderode castle. Heilo, a few miles southward of Alkmaar, venerated by the Papists on account of the virtues of S. Willebrord's, or Heilo's pond. Egmond binnen and buiten, or Egmond-op-zee and op-den-Hoef, with some adjacent villages, westward of Alkmaar, on the sea coast, once formed a county which gave name to a family. At Egmond-op-den-Hoef are the ruins of the old palace of the counts of Egmond. Hondsbosch, or Dog's Wopd, is a tract of land north of Alkmaar, along the sea coast, containing Schrool, Groet, Petten, and other villages. The Zype, a large werder, or sandy swamp, now improved and cultivated, reaches from Dogwood almost to the eastern coast. Kalantsoog, Huisduinen, and Helder, are villages ly- ing on the coast of the North sea. lielder is the extreme village of North Holland, on the Texel-stroom, or Mars-diep, to the westward of which * A Polder denotes a drained lake, ora piece of land dyked on all sides. •HOLLAND.] UNITED PROVINCES. 3 which is a convenient place of anchorage called Lands-diep, in the time of war the rendezvous of the Dutch fleet.

Zaanredam is a neat manufacturing and trading town, near the south bor- der of North Holland, a few miles from Amsterdam. 2. Water lafid^ properly so called, includes the south part of the country, and contains many villages, the principal of which is Broek^ 8 leagues N. of Amsterdam. This village, composed of about 300 houses, is remarkable for cleanliness, neatness, and elegance. The streets are narrow, paved with brick, and intersected by little canals. The houses are painted green and white on the outside, covered with glazed tiles or slates, and elegantly fur- nished and embellished. Before every house there is a handsome parterre, or little garden. The narrow streets are smoothly paved with bricks of a pale colour. No carriage or horse is permitted to enter any part of the village, one street excepted ; and passengers must generally lodge in its suburbs. An old woman, it is said, would not permit the Emperour Joseph II. to enter into her house because he wore boots. A rivulet passes through the village to the Vyver, a lake surrounded by handsome seats. The Zeevang is a district of Waterland, lying along the coast of the Zuyder-zee, on either hand of Edam, containing several villages ; as Vollendam, Warder, and Schardam noted for its neatness. The enclosed lakes, or polders, of Waterland are, the Beemster formerly an unwhole- some marsh, but drained in 1608 — 1612, now an inclosed tract of 6495 English acres, divided by many canals intersecting one another at right angles. The Wormer polders, inclosed A. D. 1626, consist of 1798 acres ; and the Purmer, in the neighbourhood of Edam, contains 2984, dyked in the year 1622. 3, West Fricsland extends from the Zype eastward to Dregterland, a promontory that runs so far out into the Zuyder-zee, as to reach within E2 12 S6 EUROPE. 12 miles of the coast of East Friesland. It consists chiefly of drained lakes, planted with about 50 villages. Schagen is a considerable town built by a colony of Jutlanders, in a fertile territory, about 1 2 miles north of Alkmaar. The following Islands are in the Zuyder Sea, adjacent to the coast of North Holland, and anciently portions of the continent. Texely or Tessel, a considerable level island, six miles long, defend- ed from the sea by sand hills and strong banks, and separated from the north extremity of Holland by a strait called the Maersdiep, 18 leagues N. N. \\V. of Amsterdam. It is protected by a fort, and has a famous road where ships lie in security. The island contains several villages, and its soil yields excellent pastures. To the westward two naval engagements between the Dutch and English fleets happened in the years 1653 and 1673. The English, in 1799, took possession of the batteries and fort which defended Maersdiep, and captured the Dutch fleet at anchor in the road. The Eyerland, at the north end of Texel, was anciently a part of this island, and afterwards separated from it; but in 1630 was joined by a dyke, and is now a continuation of it. Flleland, anciently the extremity of the continent, at the mouth of Fliestroom, now an. island N. E. of Eyerland, nine miles from N. E. to S. W. and two in breadth, containing an inconsiderable village of the same name. There is no channel west of this island between it and Eyerland. SchcUing island, N. E, of Flieland, is five leagues in length, and to- lerably fruitful, containing several villages and hamlets. Between those two islands lies the mouth or entrance of Fliestroom, in 53\" 20' N. lati- tude, which affords a convenient passage to all ships bound to the north and Baltic seas. At the west end of Schelling there is a light-house, with two beacons.

Market!^ an island six miles in circuit, lies near the S. E. extremity of North Holland, opposite to the gulph of Monnikendam, in that part of the Zuyder-zee called the Goud, or Golden, Sea. The sole village in this island is Marken-buiten. Urk is a very small island, with one village on a sandy eminence, about five leagues E. of Enkhuysen, near the centre of the Zuyder-zee ; and in it are several springs of fresh water. Schocklatid^ an island between Urk and the coast of Overyssel, con- tains two mean villages. N. B. On the coasts of Urk and Schockland are beacons for the direc- tion of ships in the night. There are many sand banks in the Zuyder- zee, which render the navigation of it difficult and dangerous, viz. the Pampus, two banks which defend the harbour of Amsterdam ; Inkhuy- ser-zand, opposite to Enkhuysen; Braesand, a large bank between Texel- stroom and Fliestroom ; the Waart, N. E. of Texel island, between Braesand and Flieland ; Lange-sand, on the coast of Friesland ; Lutjes- waart, between Braesand and the north extremity of Holland ; Grind, in the middle of the channel, between the N. E. end of Flieland and Friesland ; and Abbot, opposite to Harlingen. 3. ZEALAND. Zealand^ or Sea-land, so named from its situation, which is very sub- ject to inundations, was anciently called Valachria ; and consists of 15 or 16 islands, containing 11 towns, 110 villages, and upwards of 80,000 inhabitants : on the north bounded by Holland, on the east by Brabant, on the south by Flanders, and on the west by the German Ocean, in 5UO S8 EUROPE, 51f° N. latitude. These islands, formed by branches of the Schelde and the Maese, are fertile, well inhabited, but not salubrious to strangers. The right branch of the Schelde, called the East Schelde, divides this province into two parts. The western division consists of five consider- able islands, besides others of less note, viz. Walcheren, Joostland, South and North Beveland, and Wolfersdyk ; all of which are low, and de- fended against the inundations of the sea by sand-banks and artificial dykes, the repair and maintenance of which cost great labour and ex- pence. 1. Walcheren^ including Joostland, is the most fertile and populous island in the province of Zealand. About 40 miles in circuit, it lies be- tween South Beveland and the German Ocean, at the mouth of the Hont, or West Schelde ; containing the following towns, villages, and forts. Middkbiirg, Medloburgum, the capital of Zealand, Is an ancient, large, well built, populous, fortified, trading town, and the native place of Ad- rian Beverland, Will.

W. of Antwerp. It is of an oval figure, situate in the interior part of the island. The Oostkerk, the promenade called Molenwater, the observatory, and other public buildings, merit the notice of a traveller. Here the states of the province hold their meetings. A canal, capable of admitting large vessels, goes hence to Flushing ; and another opens a communication with the channel that separates Joostland from Wal- cheren. Vlissif/gen, or Flushing, the birth-place of Admiral Ruyter, Petrus Cuncus, Ludov. de Dieu, &c.

A fleet of the largest men of war may lie near the town in its capacious and secure harbour, 1700 Rheinland rods in length, and 200 in breadth ; to the right of which lies the entrance into the old harbour. The time of high-water, on full and change days, is about half past one. Old Flushing is a suburb on the west side of the town. The French took possession of Flushing in 1795. VeerCy or Fer Veer, formerly Kampveer, Campoveria, is a slightly fortified, trading town, with an arsenal and tolerable harbour, on the N. E. coast of Walcheren, four miles N. N. E. of Middleburg. Arnemuyden^ or Armuijen, anciently a considerable trading town, now in a state of decay, its harbour being choked up. It lies on the east coast of the island, a few miles east of the capital. West-Kappel, a small open town on the western coast, at the S. W. extremity of Zealand, fenced by a strong dyke against the encroach- ments of the sea. Domburg^ a little open town, near the sand hills, on the N. W. coast of Walcheren, and two leagues N. \\V. of the capital. There are several small country towns and forts in this island, viz. Rammekens, or Zeeburg, a fort built by Charles V. at the rtiouth of Middleburg harbour, and S. E. extremity of the island. Haak, a fort erected for the defence of the Veer-gat, about three miles N. W. of Veer. East-Kappel, Brigdam, St Laurence, Gapinge, &c. are little market towns or villages., 2.. The small island of Joostland, opposite to the eastern coast of Walcheren, from which it is separated by a narrow channel, contains the village of Niewland. 3. South Bcvdand^ Bevelandia Australis, the largest and most ai^ree- able of all the Zealand islands, lies between the East and West Schelde, separated. 40 SUROPE. separated from Joostland by a narrow channel. This island is about 25 miles from west to east, and 5 — 8 in breadth. In the year 1532, a part of it was destroyed by an inundation ; and Romerswaal, or Rem- burswaal, an old town in that district, was gradually washed away. Goes, or Ter-Goes, is a neatly built, indifferently fortified, trading town, containing 3500 inhabitants, with a small harbour, on the north coast ; defended by Ooster and Wester forts, four leagues E. of Middleburg, and five W. of Bergen-op-zooin. To the S. E, are two other forts, viz. N. W. fort and S. W. fort. Borselen, Kappel, Kruiningen, &c. are vil- lages. 4. Wolfersdijke, Wolferdi- agger, a small island, lies between South and North Beveland, containing Oosterland a village, and other places of little note, three leagues E. N. E. of Middleburg, Upon an adjacent islet, called East Beveland, are several scattered houses. 5. Noj-th Beveland, an island separated from the north coast of Wol- fersdyk, by a narrow strait called Zuydervliet, was anciently the most pleasant and fertile country of all Zealand ; but in 1530 and 1532, it was almost entirely destroyed by an inundation. In the following century, the ground being raised by the continual increase of mud, it was again embanked and cultivated, and at present contains Kortgene, or Kortign, a small country town, and several villages. A small part of the island of Orisant, is joined to the east coast of North Beveland ; and the rest of It lies under water. To the westward of the island is the Roompos, a nar- row and dangerous passage between two sand banks, called Onrust and Schotsman. The island is about six miles long, and four broad. The eastern division of Zealand consists of four considerable islands, viz. Schouwen, Duiveland, Ter Tholen, and St Philipsland. 1.

Zirksee, or Zierikzee, the birth-place of PetruS Pecius, Lavinus Lemmius, &c. is an ancient, fortified, trading town, con^ taining 6000 inhabitants, conveniently situate for trade near the south coast of the island, seven leagues S. S. W. of Briel, and five N. E. of Middleburg. Brouwershaven is a town containing 1000 inhabitants, and the native place of James Catz, grand pensionary, near the north coast, about six miles N. N. W. of Zirksee. This place has a tolerable harbout opposite to the island of Goeree. A memorable battle was fought in the neighbourhood A. D. 1426, between Philip duke of Burgundy and Humphrey duke of Gloucester ; and about two miles north-east former- ly stood the town of Bommene, which was gradually destroyed by inun- dations. Haamstede, near the west coast, is an handsome and popu- lous village. 2. Duiveland, or Duyweland, inundated in 1530, but recently em- banked and cultivated, lies eastward of Schouwen, from which it is sepa- rated by a canal called Dykwater. To the south is a strait called the Keten, and eastward that of Wydaars. It contains four lordships, and several villages. East Duiveland, on the north coast, is the most consi- derable village in the island. 3. Ter-Tholen^ or Tolen, lies on the frontier of Brabant, and is sepa- rated from South Beveland by the East Schclde. It contains a small, well built, fortified town of the same name, on the Endracht, about four miles N. W. of Bergen-op-zoom, in the S. E. corner of the island. Mar- tensdyk, a small town, formerly belonging to the house of Orange. Sta- venisse, a village on the north-west coast. Scherpenisse, a considerable and handsome village, which belonged as a lordship to the house of Orange. Beyond the Endracht, tliere is a small tract of land, contain- ing the village of New Vosmar, with its polder, on the confines of Brabant. Vol, II. F ' 4. 42 EUROPE. 4. St Ph'iUpsland is a small island lying between Duiveland and Bra- bant, opposite to the south coast of Over-Fiackee, containing a village of the same name. Zype, a sand-bank westward of this island, is well known to navigators. To the province of Zealand belongs Sommelodyk, or Zomerdyk, a small market-town on the north coast of Over-Flackee, seven leagues N. N. W. of Bergen-op-zoom, and nine N. N. E, of Middleburg. The western coasts of Walcheren and Schouwen are secured against the encroachments of the sea by downs, or sand-hills ; but the other sides, like the rest of the islands of Zealand, are defended by artificial dykes, or banks, which, at the bottom, are 25 German ells broad, and so wide at the top that two carriages may pass abreast. The height is pro- portioned to the thickness : notwithstanding, in high tides and stormy weather, the waves sometimes force a passage, or even flow over them. The original formation of these dykes must have been attended with im- mense labour and expence, since the repair and maintenance of them re- quire large sums. The dykes of this province alone would form a length of 40 miles, each mile reckoned at 1400 rods ; and, estimating a rod at six Dutch guilders, the expence of the several outward dykes, taken to- gether, amount to 340,000 pounds Sterling. 4. UTRECHT. This province, in 52° 10' N. latitude, is almost environed by Holland and Gelderland. It is 18-26 miles from north to south, and 25-40 from west to east. In most parts the soil is abundantly fertile, except towards the borders of Veluwe, where it consists of sandy hills, eminences shaded with trees, and spots of indifferent pasture-ground. On the south side, between the hilly tract and the Leek, there is good arable land ; and to the westvrard the country resembles Holland, consisting of rich meadows interspersed UTRECHT.] UNITED PROVINCES. 43 interspersed with patches of turf. The rivers are the Eem, that originates in the Veluwe and loses irself in the Zuyder-zee, the Leek, the Vecht» and other branches of the Rhine. By means of a canal that connects the Leek with the old Rhine, the largest vessels from the Upper Rhine pass to Utrecht, Amsterdam, and the other towns in Holland. The whole province is divided into four quarters, or jurisdictions, viz, Emeland, Abkoude, Montfort, and Wyk, containing 510 square miles, five boroughs, 65 market towns and villages, and 75,000 inhabitants. Utrecht, Ultrajectum, Trajectum Vetus, was originally built by Drusus in the form of a fortress, or casde, called Antonia in honour of his wife : afterwards it received the appellation of Weltembourg, or burgh of the Weltes. The Franks gave it the name of Utrecht, which signifies Old Passage. The birth-place of Pope Adrian VI. counsellor Burman, Jo. Cootwich, John Van Heurn, John Van Cuik, Jo. Leusden, Cornelius Va- lerius, and other learned men, it is an ancient, considerable, not elegantly built, populous city, containing 28,000 inhabitants, environed by a wall, pleasantly situate on the old channel of the Rhine at the efflux of the Vecht ; eight leagues S. E. of Amsterdam, and 11 N. E. of Rotterdam. Marikerk, where ancient MSS. and other curiosities are deposited ; St John's church ; the university, called the provincial academy of Utrecht, opened A. D. 1636 ; and the botanical garden, merit the notice of a tra- veller. From the tower of St Martin, there is an extensive and delightful prospect extending westward to the sea ; to the north is a view of Zuyder-zee ; and eastward the spires of Amersfort, Rhenen, Arnheim, Nimmeguen, and many intermediate towns and villages, are seen among the woods and hills which gradually rise towards Germany ; the moun- tainous district of Cleves, and the level parts of Gelderland and Holland, with the windings of the Waal and the Leek, in which the Rhine loses itself, complete a circle of more than 60 miles diameter. The union of the Provinces was formed A. D. 1579, and concluded in the great hall of F 2 the 44 EUROPE. the academy; and two famous treaties were signed in 1713 and 1714. There is little trade in tliis place ; but many of the inhabitants are manu- facturers and artificers. Over the two canals, called the New Graft and the Vaert, are 36 stone bridges. The Mall, one of the first in Europe, ia three quarters of a mile long, with a carriage road on each side bordered ■with rows of trees. The ramparts are high, and in many places planted with trees, commanding extensive prospects. The four suburbs contain several handsome buildings with orchards and gardens. The canal that reaches hence to Leyden is one of the noblest in the Low Countries. Utrecht was taken by the French A. D. 1794. The country S. E. to Nimmeguen is sandy and thinly peopled. Amersfort yioxmerXy Eemsfort, is a considerable, neat, walled, populous, manufacturing town, about 14 miles N. E. of Utrecht, in a pleasant and fruitful tract, at the foot of an eminence bathed by the navigable Eem,or Ems. The trade in bear and tobacco carried on here is not so consider- able as at a former period. Goods imported from Germany are shipped here, and consigned to Amsterdam. Rhencn is an ancient and small town, on a declivity, near the Rhine in the S. E. corner of the province. About a mile eastward is a hill cal- led Heymenberg, which commands an extensive prospect, and where an obstinate battle was fought A. D. 1198. The road thence to Utrecht lies through a tract adorned with fine seats and gardens. Wyk, surnamed Te Duurstede, formerly Dorestad, anciently Batavodu- rum, is a small, tolerably built, but decayed town, on the right bank of the Rhine, and south border of the province, five leagues S. E. of the capital. A castle, named Duro-Stadhim^ is entirely demolished. Motitfort^ or Montfoort, the birth-place of Lambert Hortensius, and anciently a fort, is now an inconsiderable town with an old casde, on the Dutch Yssel, eight miles S. W. of Utrecht. The fordfications of this place were demclished by the Spaniards. It belonged to the family of UTRECHT.] UNITED PROVINCES. 45 of Merode till 164S, when it was purcaased by the states of this pro- vince. Beside those already mentioned, the most remarkable places in the se- veral districts are the following. 1. In the Upper ^ or S. E. quarter are,— Vcenendacl, a populous village on the border of Gelderland : Amerengen, a neat country town, with a castle, on the right hand of the Rhine, equidistant nearly from Rhenen and Wyk-Duurstede ; Leersum, a lordship formerly belonging to the Earl of Rochefort in England : Zeyst, a pleasant village, formerly the property of Count Zinzendorf, with a hunting-seat built by William III. in the midst of a wood, near which a stupendous monument, in honour of Na- poleon, was erected by the French troops, nine miles from Utrecht : Schalkwyk, a long village with a ruinous seat : Ureeswyk, a village on the Leek : Jutph as, a village on a stream called the Vaart Rhine. 2. The Loiver quarter, also called the Abkoude, the largest of the four districts, contains Maarsen, a delightful village, with seats in its neigh- bpurhood : Abkoude, a large village on the crooked Amstel, from which. there is a canal to the Vecht : the isle or waard of Lopiker, separated from the other territories of the province by the barony of Ysselstein ; and a small tract in the vicinity of Schoonhoven and Nieuwport, on the Leek. 3. Kemland^ the northern division of the province, is a narrow district lying between Gooiland and the Veluwe, traversed by the river Eem,. containing, — Bunschoten, a handsome and flourishing village near the Zuyder-zee : Soestdyk, a hunting-seat built by William III. near a village of the same name : Woudenberg and Renswoude two small villages. 4. The Montfort quarter, so called from a town of that name, contains the lordships of Dykveld and Heeswyk without one village* 46 EUROPE. 5. FRIESLAND. Fr'iesland^ Frisla, so called from the Frlsii Its ancient inhabitants, is bounded on the east by Ommeland, Drenthe, and Overyssel ; on the south by Overyssel and the Zuyder-zee ; on the west by the Zuyder- zee ; and on the north by the German Ocean ; lying between 52° 45' and 53-^° N. latitude, and between 5° 8' and 6° & E. longitude from Greenwich ; being 10-13 leagues from north to south, and 10-12 from west to east. The air and soil of this province resemble those of Hol- land, especially in the north-west parts, which are lower than the sea, and remarkable for excellent pastures. Oats and hemp are the principal products, with some barley, pease, and potatoes ; but the inhabitants are chiefly supported by the fisheries. There are many lakes in the south- west districts; and the whole country is intersected by small rivers and canals. Of the latter, one extends from Leuwarden to Harlingen ; and anotiher from Slooten to a small gulph called Lemster-Meer on the south coast. The most considerable lakes are Berguemer-Meer in the east, and Tyeuker-Meer in the south part of the province. The sea coast is secured against inundations by very strong dykes raised at great expence. The turf in this province is inferiour to that of Holland. This province is divided into four districts, or quarters, viz. Oostergo, Westergo, Zevenwolde, or seven forests, and the islands on the north coast ; containing 99,800 inhabitants, Towns, iffc. — Leeuwarden, the capital of the province and the resi- dence of the principal nobility, was founded A. D. 1190, in 53° 12' N. latitude, in a fertile tract watered by three rivers, 3y leagues east of Franeker, 4 S. W. of Dockum, and 25 N. E. of Amsterdam. It is a con- siderable, well built, populous town, containing the council-house of the states, the town-house erected in 1715, the palace of the hereditary Stadtholder of the province, the great church, and about 20CO inhabi- tants.

A bay of the north sea formerly reached to this place ; but having been dried up, the ground in it is now cultivated. Franeker^ founded in the reign of the emperour Henry VI. is a small handsome trading town, the seat of an university founded A. D, 1585, and the residence of several nobility, on a canal two leagues east of Har- lingen. The fields north and west of the town are moderately elevated and tolerably fertile ; but, on the other sides, they are low, and in win- ter inundated.
