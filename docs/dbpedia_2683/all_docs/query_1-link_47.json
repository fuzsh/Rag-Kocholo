Feel free to look around and try things, but be aware that the database is reset every morning at 5am German time to a snapshot of the database of the real site made earlier that night. So don't expect any changes made here to stick around.\n\nIf you notice any problems, please let me know at anselm@strathspey.org. Send screen shots if you can (and if it makes sense). Thank you!"
