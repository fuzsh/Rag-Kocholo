        "text": "Home and Area\n\nIn a quiet subdivision on the edge of a market city in the southern part of the country, our modern home is halfway between Amsterdam and Brussels. The ground floor has a living room with gas fireplace, kitchen / diner (with dishwasher) and powder room. The kitchen opens onto a fenced garden with patio - a great place for barbecues. Upstairs is the master bedroom w/ king bed, a 2nd bedroom used as a study with sleep sofa and the bathroom w/ tub and separate shower. The large 3rd bedroom with a two person bed and a trundle bed (2 singles) is up one more flight of stairs.\n\nIndividually controlled Heat/AirCo units on each level ensure comfortable temps throughout the year.\n\nStairs are steep by American standards, but have handrails.\n\nCar is 2012 Subaru Forester with manual transmission and multi lingual, Euro-wide GPS.\n\nAbout the location\n\nThe Netherlands is a land of canals, windmills, cheese and history, where art can be seen just about everywhere and shopping opportunities cater to all tastes and pocketbooks.\n\nConditions of exchange"
