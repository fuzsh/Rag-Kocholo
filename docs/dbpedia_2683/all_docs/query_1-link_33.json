The colours of the provinces were:\n\nDrenthe: horizontal yellow, white, red and blue\n\nFriesland: the Frisian flag\n\nGelderland: yellow over blue\n\nGroningen: vertical red, white, green, white, blue\n\nLimburg: horizontal red, white, black, yellow and blue\n\nNoord-Brabant: chequy red and white (already used in 1935 when the capital 's-Hertogenbosch existed 750 years)\n\nNoord-Holland: horizontal red, yellow, blue (the same as Overijssel)\n\nOverijssel: horizontal red, yellow, blue (the same as Noord-Holland)\n\nUtrecht: horizontal red, white and yellow\n\nZeeland: horizontal yellow, red, blue and white\n\nZuid-Holland: horizontal red and yellow\n\nI don't know if the colonies also had flags. (Note that Flevoland didn't exist back than).\n\nIn some municipalities the flag was forgotten, and when they found many years later they thought it was a historical flag of the city (like in Stramproy).\n\nMark Sensen, 31 August 1997\n\nProvincial flags at Memorial Day\n\nThe 4th of May, the day before Liberation Day celebrating the surrender of the German forces on 5 May 1945, is in the Netherlands Memorial Day. The national commemoration is always at the National Monument on the Dam in Amsterdam (in front of the Palace on the Dam). Behind the monument in a half circle the flags of the provinces and the overseas territories are flying half mast, from left to right:\n\n13) Netherlands Antilles, 11) Overijssel, 9) Utrecht, 7) Limburg, 5) Flevoland, 3) Friesland, 1) Gelderland, 2) North Holland, 4) Zeeland, 6) South Holland, 8) Drenthe, 10) Groningen, 12) North Brabant, 14) Aruba.\n\nBehind these flag the national flag of the Netherlands is flying half mast. At 20.00 hour there are 2 minutes silence, after which the flags are hoisted to the top, while the national anthem (the Wilhelmus) is played."
