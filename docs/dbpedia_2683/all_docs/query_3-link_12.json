        "text": "Our experts have a broad range of experience and expertise in planning and environmental law at regional, national and EU levels. They deal with a wide range of issues, ranging from more general questions of environmental law to highly technical regulations.\n\nWe advise clients on a diversity of topics in the fields of planning, urban development, expropriations, permits and environmental law in the broadest sense, including waste and soil regulations and nature conservation. We assist the industry with technical regulations and issues (such as REACH, BAT/BREF, nitrogen issues), and negotiate and litigate on their behalf before all jurisdictions of law on permits, compliance and enforcement issues.\n\nOur team also has particular expertise in European regulations on Classification, Labelling and Packaging (CLP) and food law. We provide assistance with complex M&A and real estate transactions and are frequently called on by our public clients to draft legislation and regulations.\n\nAs sustainability and climate change have become increasingly important, we guide clients through the transition to a sustainable business model and liaise with the competent authorities and technical experts on these challenging issues. In this same context, we have unique experience and expertise in traditional and renewable energy, including solar, wind and hydrogen, as well as nuclear law, where we act for the regulators and the industry.\n\nOur clients include government bodies and private players in different sectors, which enabled us to develop a multi-faceted and pragmatic expertise. Our team is consistently top ranked in Chambers and Partners and the Legal 500."
