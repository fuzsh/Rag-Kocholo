Many people have requested a harder version. You can find it here.

In the "pro version", the following type-ins have been removed :

- North, South, East, West, Central, Mid, Inner, Outer, Upper, Lower, Lesser, Greater and derived type-ins

- Capital, Federal District, ... and capital names

- Anything that contains the country's name itself.

Have fun!

This quiz is a work of art. I particularly like it because it's not so off-puttingly enormous as most similar ones I've seen. I have still done really rubbishly though :-S

I know Jetpunk kind of doesn't care, but England is not a subdivision of the UK by the definition you give â€“ it doesn't have any administrative existence at all, just as Leinster, Munster and Connacht aren't first-level subdivisions in Ireland.

The subdivisions of the UK are Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and then Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Somerset, Bristol, Hampshire etc. etc. Very messy I'm afraid.
