The Travelers’ Century Club®’s official list of countries and territories is shown below in alphabetical order, a total of 330 as of January 2022. Although some are not actually countries in their own right, they have been included because they are removed from the parent country (see the Territory Status page for detailed criteria). After consideration as to how long one must have stayed in a country or territory to qualify, it was decided that even the shortest visit would suffice — even if only a port-of-call, or a plane fuel stop, provided that you disembark from your aircraft, ship, or vehicle and set foot in the territory. Naturally the Club prefers and encourages longer and more meaningful visits, but in situations where this is not possible for the traveler, this criterion greatly widens the field and will give the traveler a better chance to qualify for one of the most unusual clubs in the world. Anyone who has visited 100 or more of the places listed below is eligible to join.

Note: Alternate/older country or territory names and geographic subdivisions are cross-referenced in italics. The current list appears in standard type.

Thank you to John Stelling for his work on this spreadsheet.

This list has widespread recognition as the standard of countries and territories that are of significant interest, as distinct destinations, to serious travelers.
