        "text": "The 2003 constitution stipulates that 30 of the 45 seats on the Advisory Council should be filled through elections every four years, with the emir appointing the other 15 members. After years of delay, the emir announced in November 2020 that elections for two-thirds of the body’s seats would take place in October 2021. Though official turnout for the election was 63.5 percent, in July 2021 Tamim signed a law restricting the voter franchise to “native” Qataris, whose families had settled in Qatar before 1930. The number of citizens denied voting rights due to the law is unclear. After public outcry and some small-scale protests, Emir Tamim supported amending the law to include all citizens for future votes.\n\nNonpartisan elections have been held since 1999 for the 29-member Central Municipal Council, a body designed to advise the minister for municipal affairs. Members serve four-year terms. Turnout for the April 2019 Central Municipal Council elections fell to 50.1 percent of registered voters.\n\nUp to 90 percent of Qatar’s population is composed of noncitizens, including expatriates and migrant workers as well as some stateless residents, who have no political rights or electoral opportunities. Citizenship is inherited exclusively from a Qatari father; residents can apply for citizenship after 25 years in the country, but this is rarely granted. The July 2021 changes to the electoral law distinguished between “native” Qataris, whose family settled in Qatar before 1930, and naturalized citizens, who are unable to vote. In late October, Emir Tamim instructed the cabinet to amend the law to promote “equal citizenship.”\n\nQatari women enjoy some political rights, though they have little opportunity to organize independently and advocate for their interests. In the 2019 municipal council elections, 5 of the 85 candidates were women, and 2 of them—both incumbents—won seats. None of the 26 women candidates for the 30 open Advisory Council seats won in the 2021 elections. Emir Tamim appointed two women to the additional 15 seats, including Shaikha bint Yousuf Hassan al-Jufairi, who in 2003 became the first woman to win an election in any Gulf State.\n\nThe authorities regularly punish lower-level public officials for bribery and embezzlement, but corruption remains a concern. No genuinely independent anticorruption mechanisms hold senior officials and members of the ruling family publicly accountable for the allocation of state resources. In May 2021, the finance minister, Ali Sharif al-Emadi, was removed from office and detained as part of an investigation into allegations of misuse of public funds and abuse of power.\n\nQatar has also been accused of employing corrupt tactics in its successful bid to host the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) 2022 World Cup.\n\nOfficial information is tightly controlled, and critics complain of a lack of transparency in state procurement. Although the State Audit Bureau prepares budgets and accounts for government institutions, it does not share their full details with the public or the Advisory Council. A 2016 law empowered the bureau to make some aspects of its audit findings public, but the security ministries remained exempt from its oversight.\n\nIn April 2021, Abdullah Ibhais, a former employee of Qatar’s World Cup organizers who exposed abuses against and mistreatment of migrant workers, was given a prison sentence for alleged bribery and misuse of funds. His sentence was reduced in December to three years.\n\nBoth print and broadcast media are influenced by leading families and subject to state censorship. The international television network Al Jazeera is privately held, but the government has reportedly paid to support its operating costs since its inception in 1996. All journalists in Qatar practice a degree of self-censorship and face possible jail sentences for defamation and other press offenses. Access to the independent English-language website Doha News was restored in May 2020, having been blocked in late 2016 for operating without a required permit.\n\nIn January 2020, an amendment to the penal code made the sharing or publication of “false news” punishable with up to five years in prison or a maximum fine of 100,000 riyals ($27,500).\n\nWhile residents enjoy some freedom of private discussion, security forces reportedly monitor personal communications, and noncitizens often self-censor to avoid jeopardizing their work and residency status. Social media users can face criminal penalties for posting politically sensitive content. However, citizens and residents have become more active in debating current affairs and regional developments without apparent retribution in recent years.\n\nMalcolm Bidali, a security guard from Kenya who blogged about labor rights in Qatar, was detained in May 2021, and charged by the Supreme Council of the Judiciary in July for publishing false news. Amid an international outcry, Bidali was deported in August after paying a fine of 25,000 riyals ($6,810).\n\nCertain laws allow lengthy detentions without charge or access to a lawyer for suspects in cases involving national security or terrorism. Even under normal criminal procedure, judges can extend pretrial detention for up to half of the maximum prison term allowed for the alleged crime. Many laws contain ill-defined offenses and other language that gives prosecutors and judges broad discretion to determine guilt.\n\nViolent crime is rare in Qatar, and prison conditions reportedly meet international standards. Legal bans on torture and other mistreatment of detainees have generally been respected in recent years, though international experts have called for further legislative and other improvements. Corporal punishment in the form of flogging, which can be imposed on Muslim defendants for certain offenses under Sharia (Islamic law), is not commonly implemented in practice. The death penalty is permitted, including for crimes other than murder. In April 2020, a migrant worker from Nepal who had been convicted of murder was reportedly executed, the first since 2003.\n\nNoncitizens reportedly face discrimination in the courts and from police. Though the constitution bars gender-based discrimination, women are not legally guaranteed equal treatment, and their testimony is worth less than that of men in certain cases. LGBT+ people are subject to legal and societal discrimination; vague wording in the penal code can be interpreted to criminalize same-sex sexual activity, and Sharia prohibits any sexual acts outside of heterosexual marriage. Same-sex relationships must be hidden in practice.\n\nThough the government provides them some protections and support, asylum seekers and recognized refugees are barred from engaging in political activity and need government approval to change their place of residence. An asylum committee began receiving applications in 2019, though some asylum seekers reportedly continued to be threatened with deportation, casting doubt on the implementation of the law.\n\nQataris face no major restrictions on freedom of movement within the country or on type or place of employment. Such freedoms, however, are not extended to noncitizens and foreign workers, who continue to face a variety of constraints. In 2020, the government expanded migrant workers’ ability to leave the country without the permission of their employers, extending the right to sectors previously excluded. That August, the emir also signed legislation allowing migrant workers to change employers before the end of their contract without their existing employer’s permission, so long as they provide written notice. However, Amnesty International noted that employers would still manage workers’ residence permits and could still file criminal “absconding” charges against workers who leave their jobs without following the proper procedures.\n\nEach year, up to 100 children and foreign spouses of Qatari women, as well as individuals who provide exceptional skills or services to the country, can receive permanent residency, giving them access to state education and health benefits and greater rights to own property and run businesses in Qatar.\n\nThere are several legal constraints on marriage, and women are typically at a disadvantage to men under laws on personal status matters. Marriage contracts require the consent of the woman’s male guardian, and citizens must obtain government permission to marry foreigners. The foreign wives of Qatari men can obtain citizenship, but foreign husbands of Qatari women are eligible only for residency. Domestic violence and spousal rape are not specifically criminalized. Extramarital sex is illegal.\n\nMany foreign nationals face economic abuses including the withholding of wages, contract manipulation, poor living conditions, and excessive working hours. However, fear of job loss and deportation often prevents them from asserting their limited rights. Women household workers are particularly vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.\n\nInternational organizations have drawn attention to the harsh working conditions of migrants building the infrastructure for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. In February 2021, a report from The Guardian estimated that more than 6,500 migrant worker deaths had been recorded in the 10 years since Qatar was awarded World Cup hosting rights. Three Norwegian journalists investigating migrant worker conditions in Qatar were arrested and briefly detained by the authorities in November 2021.\n\nThe government has undertaken some reforms to mitigate these problems. A 2017 law guarantees household workers a maximum 10-hour working day, one rest day a week, three weeks of annual leave, and an end-of-service payment, among other provisions. However, the government lacks enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance, and the 2017 law’s standards are weaker than those in the main labor law. A 2020 reform established a monthly minimum wage of 1,000 riyals ($275) for all workers, regardless of sector or nationality. Authorities introduced a nondiscriminatory minimum wage in March 2021 (the first in the region), benefiting an estimated 400,000 workers, equivalent to 20 percent of the private sector workforce. In May 2021, a ministerial decision expanded the hours during which outside work is prohibited between June 1 and September 15 to mitigate the effects of heat stress during the summer months."
