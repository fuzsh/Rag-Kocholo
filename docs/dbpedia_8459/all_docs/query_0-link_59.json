Please explain all the place names that a country use (city, town, county, province, state, prefecture, etc. when applicable).\n\nSome suggestions to enrich the descriptions for placenames of each country:\n\nOfficial status:\n\nMention if a type of place is official status in the country or not. (e.g., in some countries, \"city\" is an official, government-sanctioned status, in others it's just arbitrary usage of the word)\n\nSay if there's an official term prefered instead of \"city\" or \"town\". (like \"municipality\")\n\nSay if an English speaker would usually use terms like \"town\"/\"city\" regardless of the words that the native speakers use.\n\nUsage/sources\n\nFeel free to provide external links and/or links to Wikipedia as sources.\n\nLink to current categories that Wiktionary uses.\n\nLink to categories that Wikipedia uses.\n\nLanguages:\n\nMention both the placename in English and the official language of the country (as in city/ciudad).\n\nComprehensiveness:\n\nMention all types of placename, down to the smallest ones such as \"village\" or \"borough\".\n\nMention any obscure types of placenames like \"region\" or \"macroregion\" (which could maybe be a group of cities, a group of states, etc., depending on the country).\n\nMention former types of placenames, i.e. that a country does not have anymore.\n\nExplain the capitals that the country has, such as capitals of states/provinces and say if the capital of the country is the capital of the state too.\n\nAppeal/illustration:\n\nAdd some map or image if you'd like!\n\nThis list can be used when deciding names of categories and formatting definitions.\n\nNote: See #Brazil for example.
