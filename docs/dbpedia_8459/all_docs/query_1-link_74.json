        "text": "Qatar has one of the world's highest GDP per capita, as well as annual GDP growth. Nevertheless, the level of high-tech exports is relatively low.\n\nFrom the beginning of 2000 the country has experienced sustained GDP growth in purchasing power parity, which decreased in recent years and reached the level of $245.6 billion (62nd place in the world) in 2020 [3,4]. The country’s GDP at purchasing power parity per capita showed decline over the past few years, and in 2020 amounted to $85 300 (6th in the world), dropping from $134 200 in 2015 [3,5].\n\nThe level of inflation changed from 2.7% in 2016 to - 0.6% in 2019; in terms of this indicator the country was 11th in the world (ranked by levels of inflation, smaller to larger) [3].\n\nAccording to The Global Competitiveness Report 2019, presented by the World Economic Forum, Qatar was 29th (out of an estimated total of 141 countries), behind a number of European countries but ahead of, for example, Saudi Arabia. This rating reflects the effectiveness of the use of the country’s own resources for sustainable development. In addition to a number of economic indicators this index also takes into account such variables as education, health, level of innovation, etc.\n\nIn the list of 134 countries that exported high-tech products in 2019-2020, Qatar was 61st, below the world average. According to the Index of Economic Freedom 2021, which is based on freedom of business, freedom from government action, property protection, and freedom from corruption, the country was considered «mostly free», 31st out of 178 countries. In terms of gold reserves and foreign exchange reserves in 2017 Qatar was 68th. The country's public debt in 2017 amounted to 53.8% of GDP, which is close to the world average (Figure 1).\n\nAccording to Standard & Poor's rating in October 2018, the country was rated as АА - «very strong» - «…the issuer has a very high ability to pay interest on debt obligations and debts themselves».\n\nQatar Gas Transport Co Ltd (Nakilat) Q.S.C. is included in the rating of the largest energy companies, according to S & P Global Platts 2021 Top 250.\n\nQatar has significant reserves of fossil fuel resources (Table 1). According to proven reserves of oil and natural gas, the country is ranked 13th and 3rd in the world, respectively [3]. According to data for 2021 in terms of tons of oil equivalent proved oil reserves amounted to 13.8%, natural gas – 86.2% (Figure 5).\n\nAccording to [6], in 2021 the proven oil reserves in Qatar was 25.2 billion barrels. At current production levels oil reserves in Qatar could last for another in 30 years.\n\nProven natural gas reserves in Qatar in 2021 according to [6] were 842.6 Tcf, which at current production levels natural gas reserves in the country could last for 140 years.\n\nTable 1. Fossil energy resources of Qatar\n\nResource /ExplanationsCrude oil*Natural gas*CoalShale GasTight (Shale) OilValue25.244 (1.52%)842.627 (11.61%)no datano datano dataUnitbillion barrelsTcf---Year20212020---Source[6][6]---\n\n*share of the country’s reserves in world total is provided in brackets\n\nQatar's share in the global volume of proven oil reserves is 1.5%, and gas – almost 12.5% [6]. Qatar is an active participant in the organization of oil exporters (OPEC), where the share of its reserves is 2.1% of the total reserves of the participating countries.\n\nQatar’s total primary energy supply (TPES) is composed of fossil fuels – oil and gas, with the share of oil being just over 33.5% in 2017 according to [8].\n\nDue to its geographical position Qatar has quite good reserves of such renewable energy sources as solar and wind. A selection of basic indicators of this type of resource is presented in Table 2.\n\nTable 2. Renewable energy resources of Qatar\n\nResource/\n\nExplanationsSolar Potential\n\n(DNI)*Wind Potential\n\n(50 м)*Bio Potential\n\n(agricultural area)Bio Potential\n\n(forest area)Geothermal\n\nPotentialMunicipal Solid\n\nWasteValue5.5-6.05.0-6.56.40no data1.27UnitkWh/m2/day m/s% of land area% of land area-kg/per capita/dayYear2020202020202020-2016Source[9][10][11][12][-][13]\n\n*for the majority of the territory of the country\n\nThe level of direct solar irradiation for the majority of the country is 5.5-6.0 kWh/m2/day [9], which is an excellent resource for the production of solar energy, both using photovoltaic technologies (PV) and by means of a concentrator (CSP).\n\nThe distribution of wind resources is as follows: for the majority of the country the wind speed is 5.0-6.5 m/s, and in the west of the country in the municipality of Al Jumayliyah it can reach 7.0-7.5m/s at the height of 50 metres [10]. It is also a decent resource, which remains practically unused.\n\nAbout 5.6% of the territory of Qatar was covered by agricultural land in 2018 [11], and this has been increasing slightly over the last half century; there is no forest in the country [12].\n\nThe level of generation of municipal waste in Qatar, 1.27 kg per capita per day, is lower than, for example, in Saudi Arabia (1.4 kg per capita per day), and higher than in Morocco (0.55 kg per capita per day). An increase of up to 1.7 kg per capita per day is predicted by 2025 [13].\n\nA territorial map of the distribution of the largest infrastructure projects of the fossil-fuel sector in Qatar is shown in Figure 5.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the proven reserves of gas account for 86.2% of proved fossil fuel resources, oil – 13.8% (Fig.5).\n\nThe world's leading offshore gas field is the North Dome (North Field), located in the northeast of Qatar’s continental shelf, which, according to Qatargas, accounts for 18.5 billion standard cubic feet per day [17]. The country's gas system is represented by 3 gas compressor stations, as well as 14 LNG export terminals operated by Qatargas and RasGas; the maximum capacity of the six largest terminals is 7.8 MTPA [18].\n\nThere are two GTL plants operating in the country, Qatar Oryx (operated by QP and Sasol-Shevron GTL) with an installed capacity of 30,000 barrels per day and Pearl GTL (QP & Shell) with an installed capacity of 140,000 barrels/day, which produce liquid hydrocarbons from natural gas [19]. Transportation of gas, condensate and gas condensate within the country is carried via a network of pipelines with a total length of 2383 km, 288 km and 221 km, respectively (Fig. 5).\n\nFigure 5. Basic Infrastructure facilities of the fossil fuel sector in Qatar (click on the map to view a PDF version)\n\nNorth Oil Company is developing the world's largest offshore oil field, Al Shaheen, located 80 km north of Ras Laffan, production is carried out at 33 platforms from 300 wells, with 300,000 barrels of oil currently per day [20].\n\nIn 2016 Qatar refineries had a total installed capacity of 429 thousand barrels/day, the largest, RasLaffan 1 and RasLaffan 2 have an installed capacity of 146 000 bbl/day [21] (Fig.5). Crude oil and petroleum products are exported via 3 oil terminals, and crude oil, petroleum products, and LNG are transported via pipelines with a total length of 745 km, 103 km, and 90 km, respectively (Fig. 5).\n\nThe map of the territorial distribution of Qatar’s largest infrastructure facilities for electricity generation is presented in Figure 6.\n\nFigure 6. Electricity production and renewable energy in Qatar (click on the map to view a PDF version)\n\nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the share of fossil fuels in energy production in Qatar in 2022 was 99.7% (Fig.6).\n\nMost of the electricity is generated at gas power plants (Fig.6), the largest of which is Ras Girtas, with an installed capacity of 2.730 MW [22].\n\nAs already noted the potential of Qatar’s renewable energy is not sufficiently used and has only a 0.3% share in electricity production. Nevertheless, the Solar PV Power Plant Al-Duhail is being completed near the capital, which will have a capacity of 15 MW [23], and a tender for the construction of a 500-MW solar photovoltaic (PV) plant in the Al Kharsaa area was announced in May 2018 [24]. In addition, Al Wakrah has a Mesaieed Incineration Plant, which can process 500,000 tons of waste per year and has an installed capacity of 50 MW [25].\n\n[1] List of countries and dependencies by area/ Wikipedia / en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependencies_by_area\n\n[2] List_of_countries_and_territories_by_population_density/ Wikipedia / en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_territories_by_population_density\n\n[3] Qatar / The world factbook / Library / Central Intelligence Agency / www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/qa.html\n\n[4] GDP, PPP (constant 2011 international $) / World Bank, International Comparison Program database.
