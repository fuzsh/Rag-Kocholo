        "text": "Introduction\n\nBackground\n\nRuled by the Al Thani family since the mid-1800s, Qatar within the last 60 years transformed itself from a poor British protectorate noted mainly for pearling into an independent state with significant hydrocarbon revenues. Former Amir HAMAD bin Khalifa Al Thani, who overthrew his father in a bloodless coup in 1995, ushered in wide-sweeping political and media reforms, unprecedented economic investment, and a growing Qatari regional leadership role, in part through the creation of the pan-Arab satellite news network Al-Jazeera and Qatar's mediation of some regional conflicts. In the 2000s, Qatar resolved its longstanding border disputes with both Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, and by 2007, Doha had attained the highest per capita income in the world. Qatar did not experience domestic unrest or violence like that seen in other Near Eastern and North African countries in 2011, due in part to its immense wealth and patronage network. In mid-2013, HAMAD peacefully abdicated, transferring power to his son, the current Amir TAMIM bin Hamad. TAMIM is popular with the Qatari public for his role in shepherding the country through an economic embargo from some other regional countries, for his efforts to improve the country's healthcare and education systems, and for his expansion of the country's infrastructure in anticipation of hosting international sporting events. Qatar became the first country in the Arab world to host the FIFA Menâs World Cup in 2022.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of regional unrest in 2011, Doha prided itself on its support for many popular revolutions, particularly in Libya and Syria. This stance was to the detriment of Qatarâs relations with Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which temporarily recalled their respective ambassadors from Doha in 2014. TAMIM later oversaw a warming of Qatarâs relations with Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE in November 2014 following Kuwaiti mediation and signing of the Riyadh Agreement. This reconciliation, however, was short-lived. In 2017, Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE (the \"Quartet\") cut diplomatic and economic ties with Qatar in response to alleged violations of the agreement, among other complaints. They restored ties in 2021 after signing a declaration at the Gulf Cooperation Council Summit in Al Ula, Saudi Arabia. In 2022, the United States designated Qatar as a major non-NATO ally.\n\nÂ\n\nTip\n\nVisit the Definitions and Notes page to view a description of each topic.\n\nDefinitions and Notes\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nMiddle East, peninsula bordering the Persian Gulf and Saudi Arabia\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n25 30 N, 51 15 E\n\nMap references\n\nMiddle East\n\nArea\n\ntotal : 11,586 sq km\n\nland: 11,586 sq km\n\nwater: 0 sq km\n\ncomparison ranking : total 164\n\nArea - comparative\n\nalmost twice the size of Delaware; slightly smaller than Connecticut\n\nArea comparison map :\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 87 km\n\nborder countries (1): Saudi Arabia 87 km\n\nCoastline\n\n563 km\n\nMaritime claims\n\nterritorial sea: 12 nm\n\ncontiguous zone: 24 nm\n\nexclusive economic zone: as determined by bilateral agreements or the median line\n\nClimate\n\narid; mild, pleasant winters; very hot, humid summers\n\nTerrain\n\nmostly flat and barren desert\n\nElevation\n\nhighest point: Tuwayyir al Hamir 103 m\n\nlowest point: Persian Gulf 0 m\n\nmean elevation: 28 m\n\nNatural resources\n\npetroleum, fish, natural gas\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 5.6% (2018 est.)\n\narable land: 1.1% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent crops: 0.2% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent pasture: 4.3% (2018 est.)\n\nforest: 0% (2018 est.)\n\nother: 94.4% (2018 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\n130 sq km (2020)\n\nMajor aquifers\n\nArabian Aquifer System\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nmost of the population is clustered in or around the capital of Doha on the eastern side of the peninsula\n\nNatural hazards\n\nhaze, dust storms, sandstorms common\n\nGeography - note\n\nthe peninsula occupies a strategic location in the central Persian Gulf near major petroleum deposits\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\ntotal: 2,552,088\n\nmale: 1,961,135\n\nfemale: 590,953 (2024 est.)\n\ncomparison rankings : female 161; male 131; total 143\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Qatari(s)\n\nadjective: Qatari\n\nEthnic groups\n\nnon-Qatari 88.4%, Qatari 11.6% (2015 est.)\n\nLanguages\n\nArabic (official), English commonly used as a second language\n\nmajor-language sample(s):\n\nÙØªØ§Ø¨ Ø­ÙØ§Ø¦Ù Ø§ÙØ¹Ø§ÙÙ Ø Ø§ÙÙ ØµØ¯Ø± Ø§ÙØ°Ù ÙØ§ ÙÙ ÙÙ Ø§ÙØ§Ø³ØªØºÙØ§Ø¡ Ø¹ÙÙ ÙÙÙ Ø¹ÙÙÙ Ø§Øª Ø§ÙØ£Ø³Ø§Ø³ÙØ© (Arabic)\n\nThe World Factbook, the indispensable source for basic information.\n\nArabic audio sample :\n\nReligions\n\nMuslim 65.2%, Christian 13.7%, Hindu 15.9%, Buddhist 3.8%, folk religion <0.1%, Jewish <0.1%, other <1%, unaffiliated <1% (2020 est.)\n\nMENA religious affiliation\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 13.1% (male 168,844/female 165,905)\n\n15-64 years: 85.4% (male 1,767,294/female 411,977)\n\n65 years and over: 1.5% (2024 est.)
