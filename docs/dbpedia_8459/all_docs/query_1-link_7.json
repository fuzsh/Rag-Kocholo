        "text": "Qatar , officially State of Qatar, Country, Middle East, southwestern Asia. It juts out from the east coast of the Arabian Peninsula into the Persian Gulf. Area: 4,493 sq mi (11,637 sq km). Population: (2024 est.) 2,986,000. Capital: Doha. Most of the population is Arab, with South Asian and Iranian minorities who are often migrant workers. Languages: Arabic (official), English. Religions: Islam (official; predominantly Sunni); also Christianity, Hinduism. Currency: Qatar rial. Qatar is mostly stony, sandy, and barren and consists of salt flats, dune desert, and arid plains. Largely because of petroleum and natural gas exports, its gross national product per capita is one of the highest in the world. The government owns all of the agricultural land and generates most of the economic activity; the private sector participates in trade and contracting on a limited scale. Qatar is a constitutional emirate with one advisory body, and its basis of legislation is Islamic law. The head of state and government is the emir, assisted by the prime minister. It was partly controlled by Bahrain from the mid-18th to the mid-19th century and then was nominally part of the Ottoman Empire until World War I (1914â€“18). In 1916 it became a British protectorate. Oil was discovered in 1939, and Qatar rapidly modernized. It declared independence in 1971, when the British protectorate ended. In 1991 Qatar served as a base for air strikes against Iraq in the Persian Gulf War."
