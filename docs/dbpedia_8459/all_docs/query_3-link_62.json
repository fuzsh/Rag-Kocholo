        "text": "Geographic Jurisdiction\n\nUSCIS Doha has jurisdiction over U.S. immigration matters in Qatar.\n\nPublic hours\n\nFor public inquiries related to services our office provides (see list of services below), please contact our office by email at Qatar-USCIS@uscis.dhs.gov.\n\nDirect all other public inquiries to the USCIS Contact Center. If you are in the United States or a U.S. territory, dial 800-375-5283 (for people who are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a speech disability: TTY 800-767-1833) to access automated information through an interactive menu 24 hours a day, seven days a week. If you are outside the United States or a U.S. territory, you can call the USCIS Contact Center at 212-620-3418. You can get live help from a USCIS representative Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern except on federal holidays.\n\nAppointments\n\nYou must make an appointment by email to visit USCIS Doha. USCIS Doha does not accept walk-ins.\n\nFee Payment Information\n\nFor all applications and petitions that you submit to this office, you must pay the fees to the U.S. Embassy cashier with Visa or MasterCard or in cash with U.S. dollars or Qatari Riyals. We do not accept personal checks or money orders.\n\nOffice Services\n\nClick on the tabs below for additional information on each service this office provides. Click on the form names within the tabs to see a complete explanation of the fees, required forms and documentation associated with forms that we may accept directly at this office. If there are special instructions for filing at this office, you will see them under “Filing and Other Special Instructions” within each tab.\n\nForm I-730, Refugee/Asylee Relative Petition\n\nForm I-730, Refugee/Asylee Relative Petition, Form and Fee Information\n\nPurpose:\n\nIndividuals admitted to the United States as a principal refugee or granted status in the United States as a principal asylee within the past 2 years may file a Form I-730, Refugee/Asylee Relative Petition, for qualifying relatives.\n\nFiling and Other Special Instructions:\n\nPrincipal refugees and asylees may file this petition in the United States for their qualifying relatives. Please see the Form I-730 webpage for eligibility requirements and filing instructions. If you file a Form I-730 petition with USCIS for a beneficiary who resides in Qatar, we will transfer the petition to the USCIS Doha International Field Office for further processing. After the USCIS Doha International Field Office receives the Form I-730, we will contact the petitioning relative and any representative of record to begin processing and gather additional information and documents.\n\nPlease Note: It is important to notify our office if the beneficiary’s contact information changes from what is on their Form I-730 petition. You should inform us of any such changes by submitting the change by email to the USCIS field office where we transferred your petition.\n\nCollection of Re-entry Permit\n\nPurpose:\n\nLawful permanent residents may pick up a reentry permit you applied for by filing Form I-131, Application for Travel Document, to return to the United States travel abroad in certain circumstances (PDF, 667.32 KB).\n\nFiling and Other Special Instructions:\n\nThis office does not adjudicate re-entry permits. This office only provides service if you applied for a reentry permit by filing Form I-131, Application for Travel Document, in the United States and asked USCIS to send your reentry permit to the U.S. Embassy/USCIS in Doha.\n\nIf we receive contact information, USCIS Doha will contact you when your Form I-131 has been approved by an office in the United States and your reentry permit is ready for collection. If you believe your permit should be at USCIS Doha and you have not heard from us, you may send us an inquiry.\n\nFind instructions on how to obtain or replace a reentry permit at How Do I Get a Reentry Permit (PDF, 667.32 KB).\n\nBiometrics Collection\n\nPurpose:\n\nBiometrics collection supports certain applications and petitions pending with a USCIS international office and, in some cases, with a domestic office.\n\nFiling and Other Special Instructions:\n\nIf USCIS has requested biometrics (such as fingerprints, photograph, and/or signature) in association with the adjudication of the forms listed below, individuals residing in Qatar generally may request biometrics collection at our office:\n\nForm I-130, Petition for Alien Relative;\n\nForm I-131, Application for Travel Document (Refugee Travel Document (RTD)), if the applicant has departed the United States without an RTD and has received permission from USCIS to file Form I-131 from outside the United States. Otherwise, it is at the field office director’s discretion as we explain in the section For All Other Forms Not Listed Above;\n\nForm I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er) or Special Immigrant;\n\nForm I-600, Petition to Classify Orphan as an Immediate Relative—We do not always require residency;\n\nForm I-600A, Application for Advance Processing of Orphan Petition—We do not always require residency;\n\nForm I-730, Refugee/Asylee Relative Petition;\n\nForm I-800A, Application for Determination of Suitability to Adopt from Convention Country—We do not always require residency;\n\nForm I-914, Application for T Nonimmigrant Status**;\n\nForm I-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status**;\n\nForm N-400, Application for Naturalization—for active duty military service members stationed abroad and their dependents, and for certain applicants who are eligible for naturalization under section 319(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\nFor All Other Forms Not Listed Above:\n\nUSCIS usually schedules biometrics collection at an Application Support Center (ASC) in the United States based on the applicant’s or petitioner’s address of record.\n\nIn rare circumstances, international field office directors may use their discretion to collect biometrics that we initially scheduled for collection in the United States. When deciding whether to collect biometrics at an international field office, field office directors will consider resource constraints and appropriate supporting evidence the applicant provides, as well as the following factors:\n\nAn appointment notice showing that we scheduled biometrics collection at a domestic USCIS office;\n\nEvidence of extenuating circumstances requiring the individual to depart the United States before we collected their biometrics as indicated in the appointment notice. For example, these circumstances might include, but are not limited to, the need to assist a critically ill family member, an unexpected immediate job transfer, or other urgent need; and\n\nEvidence that the applicant requested an expedited or rescheduled appointment at an ASC before leaving the United States, or an explanation of why they failed to request an expedited or rescheduled appointment.\n\nFor those residing abroad: Evidence of the compelling circumstances or hardship that would prevent the applicant or petitioner from traveling back to the United States for an ASC appointment. Generally, we do not consider the expense of traveling back to the United States to be a hardship in itself.\n\nBecause of the small number of staff in our international offices, you may experience a delay in appointment availability for biometrics collection.\n\nYou can contact USCIS Doha to determine whether you are eligible to have your biometrics captured at this office or for further information.\n\n*Note: The available biometric services noted above only apply if you live in a country with a USCIS office.\n\nForm I-601, Application for Waiver of Grounds of Inadmissibility\n\nForm I-601, Application for Waiver of Grounds of Inadmissibility, Form and Fee Information\n\nPurpose:\n\nIf you are inadmissible to the United States and are otherwise approved to immigrate to the United States, you must file this form to seek a waiver of certain grounds of inadmissibility.\n\nFiling and Other Special Instructions:\n\nExcept as we explain below, you must file Form I-601 with the USCIS Lockbox in the United States by mail. If you believe you have extraordinary circumstances that require expedited processing, you may submit a written request for expedited processing along with your application when you file with the Lockbox. You can find further instructions on requesting expedited processing domestically on the How to Make an Expedite Request webpage.\n\nTo file with USCIS Doha in limited circumstances:\n\nYou must request an exception to Lockbox filing via email.\n\nWe may grant an exception to Lockbox filing and permission to file Form I-601 if:\n\nThe applicant resides in Qatar;\n\nThere are exceptional and compelling humanitarian circumstances that require immediate filing and adjudication and\n\nExpedited processing would not address the urgency of the circumstances.\n\nFor information about the exceptions to Lockbox filing and permission to file Form I-601 at an international office, including examples of possible qualifying circumstances, please see the USCIS policy memorandum (PDF, 78.82 KB) on exceptions for international filing.\n\nForm I-212, Application for Permission to Reapply for Admission into the United States After Deportation or Removal\n\nForm I-212, Application for Permission to Reapply for Admission into the United States After Deportation or Removal, Form and Fee Information\n\nPurpose:\n\nIf you have been deported or removed, or unlawfully returned to the United States without admission after a previous removal or unlawful presence, you may file this form to obtain consent to reapply for admission to the United States.\n\nFiling and Other Special Instructions:\n\nFile with the USCIS office in the United States indicated in the Form I-212 instructions.\n\nIf you need to file both Form I-212 and Form I-601, file them together at the Lockbox address specified in the Form I-601 instructions.\n\nIf USCIS Doha decides that exceptional and compelling humanitarian circumstances warrant filing your Form I-601 with USCIS Doha, you can also file Form I-212 with Form I-601.\n\nIf you file Form I-601 and Form I-212 together, be sure to bring the correct filing fee for each separate form.\n\nOversight of DNA Sample Collection\n\nPurpose:\n\nUSCIS international field offices oversee DNA collection for individuals residing outside the United States who submit DNA results to support certain immigration petitions or applications pending with USCIS. DNA testing is voluntary, and the benefit requestor or beneficiary must pay all costs for testing and any related expenses. Completing DNA testing does not guarantee we will approve your benefit request.\n\nFiling and Other Special Instructions:\n\nIf you want to request DNA collection, contact an accredited Association for the Advancement of Blood & Biotherapies laboratory (AABB lab) to request a DNA kit. You can find a list of AABB labs online. You must pay the AABB lab for the DNA testing and all shipping costs. Prices for DNA testing vary by lab.\n\nAfter the AABB lab receives your request, they will send a DNA collection kit directly to the USCIS international field office in the country where the donor beneficiary is located. When making your request to the AABB lab, be sure to provide accurate contact information for the donor beneficiary. If USCIS does not have a field office in that country, the lab will send the kit to the State Department Consular Section. When USCIS (or the consular section) receives a DNA kit, we will contact the donor beneficiary using the contact information provided to the AABB lab to schedule an appointment for the DNA collection.\n\nOn the day of the DNA collection appointment, each donor beneficiary must bring:\n\n2 passport-style color photographs and\n\nAn original passport, with a photocopy of the bio page. If an original passport is not available, provide a government-issued photo identification card with photocopy. Children who are unmarried and under 21 years of age only may bring an original birth certificate or official extract birth certificate with a photocopy.\n\nThe USCIS international field office will oversee the collection of DNA cheek-swab samples and will send those samples directly to the lab using the pre-paid envelope provided by the AABB lab. The DNA test results will be forwarded directly to USCIS.\n\nIf you have questions regarding DNA collection at USCIS international offices, please contact the local office by email. You can find a list of USCIS international offices with links to their contact information on our International Immigration Offices webpage.\n\nOther Services\n\nFor information on other immigration benefits, please visit uscis.gov. For your convenience, we have provided links to information on some commonly asked about services:\n\nObtaining a certified true copy of a naturalization certificate.\n\nRequesting copies of documents from your Alien file (A-File) through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.\n\nOur USCIS Contact Center has additional information available on its webpage (you must live in the United States or its territories to call for live assistance).\n\nThe USCIS Contact Center’s Reference Guide is available from anywhere around the globe. The guide provides additional information on the services USCIS provides.\n\nVisas\n\nFor in-depth information about visas, please check the Visa Services section of the Department of State’s website.
