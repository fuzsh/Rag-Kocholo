        "text": "Qatar is a popular Middle Eastern choice among expatriates from all around the world. It is a country without income tax, but although Qatar does not have taxes, that doesnât mean you donât! As a US expat, you remain responsible for United States expat taxes. This article will help clarify your obligations.\n\nUS Expat Taxes - Qatar\n\nUS citizens, as well as permanent residents, are required to file expatriate tax returns with the federal government every year regardless of where they reside. Along with the typical tax return for income, many people are also required to submit a return disclosing assets which are held in bank accounts in foreign countries by using FinCEN Form 114 (FBAR).\n\nThe United States is among only a few governments who tax international income earned by their citizens, as well as permanent residents, residing overseas. There are, however, some provisions that help protect from possible double taxation. These include:\n\nThe Foreign Earned Income Exclusion. This exclusion allows one to exclude USD 103,900 (this amount is for 2018Â taxes) in earned income from foreign sources.\n\nA tax credit allowing tax on remaining income to be reduced based on the taxes paid to foreign governments.\n\nAn exclusion on foreign housing that allows additional exclusions from their income for some amounts paid to cover household expenses due to living abroad.\n\nPreparing a quality tax return following proper tax planning should allow one to use these, as well as other strategies, in minimizing or possibly eliminating tax liability. Note that in most cases the filing of a tax return is required, even if taxes are not owed.\n\nTax Rates for Qatar\n\nOne of the biggest reasons expats are drawn to Qatar is the lack of an income tax on employees. There isnât a requirement to file tax returns with the PRTD (Public Revenues & Taxes Department) unless a person conducts business in Qatar. Businesses pay a 10% flat tax on any income from capital gains or activities.\n\nWho Qualifies as a Qatari Resident?\n\nTo qualify as a resident in Qatar, a taxpayer must meet at least one of these requirements:\n\nPresent physically in Qatar a minimum of 183 days (these need not be consecutive) during any twelve month period\n\nHave a home in the country of Qatar\n\nHave an interest in the country of Qatar\n\nWhen Are Qatar Taxes Due?\n\nQatar has the same tax year as the United States - January 1st thru December 31st. But, since there is not an income tax levied on earnings received from employment, no obligation for filing tax returns exists. If a person has business income from Qatar, they must file their tax return no later than 4 months following the conclusion of the year. Business returns are not eligible for any extension of the filing deadline.\n\nQatar Social Security\n\nBecause of the small population in Qatar, and the significant GDP, there are very few financial obligations imposed on residents of the country for the social services they receive. Expatriates receive medical assistance, although they only get limited social services in other areas.
