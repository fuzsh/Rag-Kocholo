        "text": "Table of Contents\n\nToggle\n\nMany people are looking to live and work in Qatar, but there are some things that you should know before you take the plunge and move abroad. I've lived here in Qatar for almost two years now, and this article will give you an honest look at what it's like to live in Qatar. Things that you should think about before moving to this country. Let's look at the pros and cons of moving to Qatar.\n\nDocshipper Tip : DocShipper helps people and companies who wish to expatriate to ship their personal belongings abroad.

That is a question that many people are asking these days. While it's true that Doha does not have ideal air quality, even with those conditions, you can live a long and happy life in Doha if you know what you're getting into beforehand. So let's take a closer look at both sides of living in Doha. Here are the pros and cons of living in Qatar.\n\nPros of moving to Qatar\n\nHere are some pros of moving to Qatar. Hope you will get benefited by it:\n\n1. Company Expatriate Package\n\nThe expat package offered by most companies in Qatar is generous. You will receive a salary plus any local or expat tax benefits based on your national status. For example, foreign workers pay no income tax in Qatar as they are not residents, but non-Qatari citizens are taxed at 15% of their income if they stay for more than six months.\n\n2. High Salary with Tax Benefits\n\nQatar work visa holders are not required to pay taxes on their income. This can be made for a very attractive base salary offer from employers that can be as much as 80-100% more than what you could earn back home (depending on exchange rates).\n\n3. Relatively Low Cost of Living\n\nThe cost of living in Qatar is low compared to most Western countries, but there are also plenty of opportunities to save money if you are willing to shop and live within your means.\n\nYou can find apartments for less than $1,000 per month or rent an entire villa with a pool for $2,000 per month or less. Groceries are also relatively cheap compared to Western prices; getting a week's worth of groceries for about $20 or less is possible.\n\n4. Qatar work visa\n\nThere are many advantages of a Qatar work visa. Firstly, Qatar companies are largely dependent on foreign workers. Therefore, your chances of securing a job in a company that utilizes expats are higher than in most other gulf countries due to its limited national workforce. Secondly, all expats who wish to work in Qatar\n\nmust secure an employment permit issued by their respective company or sponsor. It means that upon arrival in the country, you can be assured that your new employer will welcome you with open arms if everything goes as planned.\n\n5. Low crime rates\n\nQatar has one of the lowest crime rates in all of Asia. You don't need to take precautions to protect yourself from becoming a victim. To prevent crime, there is a large police presence on the streets.\n\n6. No Taxes on Property Sales\n\nThere are no taxes on property sales in Qatar, so you don't have to pay any capital gains tax when selling your home (although you may need to pay some fees).\n\n7. No Capital Gains Tax\n\nThere is no capital gains tax in Qatar, which makes owning real estate an attractive proposition from a financial standpoint.\n\nDocshipper Tip : Moving is a stressful process, even more so when moving abroad. That's why our expatriation experts will take care of all the arrangements and will be at your disposal to answer all your questions.

This can significantly affect your work-life balance as many companies force their expats to work long hours to 'catch up with those who live in areas that don't have such harsh weather.\n\n2.It gets expensive\n\nWhile housing costs aren't too bad in other countries, there's a huge difference between renting a small studio apartment for $100/month and renting a spacious villa for $2000/month (or more).\n\n3.Traffic is unbearable\n\nIf you have ever lived in an area where traffic was terrible, you know how stressful it can be. In Doha, traffic can take hours out of your day as you sit motionless on one of several highways that cut through Doha.\n\n4.Different culture\n\nWhile most expats who move here enjoy living in a country where Islam is practiced freely, some things will surprise you about Qatari culture (e.g., women wearing full burkas). Depending on your personal beliefs, this may or may not be a problem for you.\n\n5. Qatar work VISA\n\nOne disadvantage of moving to Qatar is the costs involved. While expats won't be saddled with visa fees or a resident permit ID charge,\n\nthey will have to pay for their medical insurance (as there are no public hospitals) and school fees for any kids attending an international school.\n\n6. Driving in Qatar\n\nDriving in a new country can be both exhilarating and terrifying, but there are definite disadvantages to driving in Qatar. These include challenges with navigating (many roads don't even have street signs) and an occasional tendency for reckless drivers. If you're considering moving here, prepare for some challenges behind the wheel.\n\n7. Less outdoor activities\n\nYou should know that there aren't many outdoor activities available in Qatar.\n\nIf you love hiking or rock climbing, you may want to consider relocating elsewhere because while there are a few basic paths around town, they aren't exactly scenic.\n\n8. Difficult to travel\n\nIt's difficult to travel around town without getting lost (because everything looks exactly alike). Doha is like an endless sea of glass buildings and skyscrapers with no distinguishing landmarks whatsoever.\n\n9. Legal issues\n\nYou should be aware of some legal issues before moving here. For example, if caught smuggling alcohol or drugs into Qatar, you could face a prison sentence and hefty fines.\n\nDocshipper Tip: Whether you are moving to a new job, living abroad, or taking a vacation, DocShipper makes it easy to pack and ship your personal belongings.

In addition, while many expats move abroad with a clear idea about how they plan to make money in their new home, others struggle with creating sustainable business models or partaking in self-sustaining lifestyles.\n\nThis lack of clarity can throw off expats’ sense of balance and create unnecessary stress for themselves and those around them. It’s vital for expats planning on moving abroad to have an idea about how they intend to earn money in their new country, especially if it is not one where English is widely spoken and where working hours are significantly different from those found in North America or Europe.\n\nLiving in Qatar as foreign women\n\nFor an expat woman, life in Qatar can be gratifying and challenging. Expatriate women who have already experienced some level of independence or self-reliance before leaving their home countries are pleasantly surprised by how empowered they feel living in Qatar.\n\nThis empowerment gives them access to a certain amount of freedom they might not have been granted before. However, women from highly conservative societies may find that they must adapt if they wish to feel more comfortable in a more liberal society such as Qatar. There are pros and cons for women who choose to move to Qatar, depending on your expectations before making your move.\n\nMoving to Qatar from the USA\n\nMoving to Qatar from abroad is not for everyone.\n\nIt can be a culture shock, especially if you're moving from a Western nation like America.\n\nThe Arabic language is challenging for native English speakers, as is learning about Muslim culture in a Middle Eastern country.\n\nlife will be much easier to communicate with others if you learn Arabic, but that can take years.\n\nUltimately, whether or not Qatar is right for you boils down to your personal preferences regarding climate and culture.\n\nCan a foreigner buy a house in Qatar?\n\nFirst, you'll need to be able to afford a house. Housing prices in Qatar are high compared with other parts of the world, but not extraordinarily. Real estate is more affordable here than in most countries, including some parts of Europe.\n\nIn that sense, yes, it's possible for a foreigner—and even an expat—to buy a house. However, ownership isn't guaranteed for those who aren't citizens or permanent residents (PRs). You may consider taking out an investment-grade mortgage from a Qatari bank or applying for PR status (which has its requirements and benefits).\n\nConclusion:\n\nAs a small country in the Middle East, Qatar is not lacking in job opportunities or an expat community. However, while it's by no means alone, there are some notable drawbacks that new expats should be aware of before moving to Qatar. If you're considering relocation here, make sure you understand what life is like to decide if it's right for you! We hope that this guide helped you learn more abourt the pros and cons of relocating to Qatar.\n\nFAQ | What are the pros and cons of Moving to Qatar?\n\nIs moving to Qatar a good idea?\n\nQatar has long been considered one of the top places to live and work in the Middle East, and for good reason. The country’s booming economy attracts thousands of expats from around the world each year. Also, Qatar offers so many opportunities to its expats. If you are looking to find work, build careers and start families you can consider moving to Qatar.\n\nIs Qatar friendly for foreigners?\n\nYes, Qatar is a friendly country for foreigners. The locals are friendly and helpful, but they do expect expats to respect cultural and religious norms, dress conservatively out in public.\n\nHow much salary do you need to live in Qatar?\n\nThe latest salary guide from Mercer says that Qatar will cost you 6000 QAR per month. Since living in Qatar is definitely an expensive thing, your salary should meet at least these requirements. But if your current salary is less than 6000 QAR per month then you need to think about it.\n\nWhat is the average house rent in Qatar?\n\nJust as with most places, housing costs in Qatar can vary significantly depending on your location and desired level of luxury. If you’re looking for accommodation in one of Doha’s many gleaming high-rises, you can expect to pay upwards of $500- $2,000 USD per month.\n\nDocShipper info: Did you like our article today?
