        "text": "Qatar’s history is closely linked to the history of the Gulf region and the Arabian Peninsula, which were strategic positions to control the trade routes to India and Far East. After experiencing Persian domination for centuries, Qatar fell briefly under the Portuguese in 1515 before the Ottomans’ conquest. The Ottomans intermittently seized the country until the beginning of the World War I.\n\nThe Al Khalifa family ruled the Qatari peninsula from 1783 after extending their area of authority from Bahrain. But there was a popular sentiment of resentment against the Al Khalifa. A massive naval attack was launched in 1867 by the ruling family in an effort to crush the Qatari rebels. This Qatari–Bahraini War led to a peace treaty (with British mediation) that recognized the explicit distinctness of Qatar from Bahrain, and the Al Thani family coming to power. Qatar became officially a British protectorate in 1916 after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire during World War I.\n\nThe sphere of influence of the British Empire started diminishing after World War II, particularly after the Independence of India and Pakistan in 1947. The British accepted Kuwait’s independence in 1961 and announced 7 years later that they would quickly politically disengage from the Persian Gulf.\n\nQatar, Bahrain and seven other countries created a federation but regional disputes compelled Qatar to declare in 1971 its independence from the coalition (that would become the United Arab Emirates). Qatar became an independent, sovereign state and a member of the United Nations.\n\nIn 2013, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani abdicated to give power to his son the Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani. Under Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, Qatar has experienced numerous liberal, social and political reforms, including the endorsement of women’s suffrage or right to vote. A new constitution has been adopted for the country and the TV network Al Jazeera has been launched, which played a significant role in raising awareness of the country.\n\nQatar is currently the subject of a diplomatic and economic embargo since June 2017 by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt. But the country succeeded in adjusting its national & international strategies and its economy remains strong."
