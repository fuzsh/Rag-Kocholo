        "text": "A country cluster denotes a collective of countries that are associated with each other in some capacity. In some cases, that capacity is not governed (example: the MENA Region); in other cases, however, a formal governing body exists for the relationship (example: European Union).\n\nWith increasing opportunities for remote work, we understand the constraints of only targeting a country level, especially in smaller countries. Country clusters can be used on LinkedIn to post and target jobs to specific regions across the world. For example, the option to set a job location and targeting to reach all of the European Union (EU).\n\nThe list of country clusters that can be used when posting a job in LinkedIn Recruiter is below."
