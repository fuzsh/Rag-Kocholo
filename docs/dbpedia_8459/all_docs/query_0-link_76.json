        "text": "Google Cloud uses regions, subdivided into zones, to define the geographic location of physical computing resources. Google stores and processes your data only in the region you specify for all features of Vertex AI except for data labeling tasks and any feature in experimental or preview launch status.\n\nChoosing your location\n\nYou can choose any supported location when you create a dataset, train a custom-trained model that doesn't use a managed dataset, or when you import an existing model. You should typically use the region closest to your physical location or the physical location of your intended users, but check that the Vertex AI feature you want to use is supported in your region. There is no global location.\n\nFor operations other than creating a dataset or importing a model, you must use the location of the resources you are operating on. For example, when you create a training pipeline that uses a managed dataset, you must use the region where the dataset is located.\n\nSpecifying the location using Google Cloud console\n\nWhen you use Google Cloud console, you specify the location by using the location drop-down menu:\n\nSpecifying the location using the Vertex AI API\n\nYou specify the location for a Vertex AI API request by using the appropriate regional endpoint.\n\nFor example, to make a request in the europe-west4 region, use the following endpoint:\n\nhttps://europe-west4-aiplatform.googleapis.com\n\nTo make a request in the us-central1 region, use the following endpoint:\n\nhttps://us-central1-aiplatform.googleapis.com\n\nWhen you specify a resource, you use the name of the resource's region as the location. For example, a dataset in the us-central1 region would be specified using the following path:\n\nprojects/PROJECT/locations/us-central1/datasets/DATASET_ID\n\nSee the list of supported service endpoints.\n\nAvailable locations\n\nVertex AI is available in the following regions:\n\nFor Generative AI locations, see Generative AI on Vertex AI locations.\n\nGoogle Cloud also provides additional regions for products other than Vertex AI.\n\nFeature availability\n\nSome Vertex AI features are not available in all regions. The following table lists the features that are available in each region.\n\nThe following sortable table lets you select different options to see where Vertex AI features are available. For example, to see a list of regions where Vertex AI Feature Store is available in Europe, you can select Europe from the Select a location drop-down menu, and Vertex AI Feature Store from the Select a feature drop-down menu.\n\n* Cells marked with asterisks represent regions where the service is available through the Vertex AI API but not in the Google Cloud console.\n\nVertex AI Workbench locations\n\nSee the following locations tables for Vertex AI Workbench:\n\nVertex AI Workbench instances\n\nManaged notebooks\n\nUser-managed notebooks\n\nVertex AI Workbench instances locations\n\nVertex AI Workbench instances are available in the following zones.\n\nManaged notebooks regions\n\nManaged notebooks are available in the following regions.\n\nUser-managed notebooks locations\n\nUser-managed notebooks are available in the following zones.\n\nRegion considerations\n\nUsing accelerators\n\nAccelerators are available on a region basis. The following table lists all the available accelerators for each region.\n\nYou can search either by location or GPU model, or a combination of both.\n\n* Cells marked with asterisks represent regions where the specified accelerator is available for training but not for serving batch or online predictions.\n\nâ€  Cells marked with daggers represent regions where the specified accelerator is available for serving batch or online predictions but not for training.\n\nIf your job uses multiple types of GPUs, they must all be available in a single zone in your region. For example, you can't run a job in australia-southeast1 using NVIDIA Tesla P4 GPUs, NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPUs, and NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPUs. While all of these GPUs are available for jobs in australia-southeast1, no single zone in that region provides all three types of GPU. To learn more about the zone availability of GPUs, see GPU availability by regions and zones.\n\nBigQuery location requirements\n\nWhen you use a BigQuery table as a source for a managed tabular dataset or tabular prediction data, it must conform to the following location requirements:\n\nCloud Storage bucket requirements\n\nSome Vertex AI tasks, such as importing data, use a Cloud Storage bucket.\n\nWe recommend that you use the following settings when creating a Cloud Storage bucket to use with Vertex AI:\n\nLocation type: Region.\n\nLocation: The region where you are using Vertex AI; for example, us-central1, europe-west4, or asia-east1.\n\nStorage class: Standard.\n\nThese settings are not strict requirements, but using these settings often improves performance. For example, it's possible to use a bucket in a multi-region with Vertex AI, but loading data from a bucket in the same region as your Vertex AI resource might reduce latency.\n\nIf the bucket is not in the same project that the Vertex AI job is running in, make sure Vertex AI has the correct roles.\n\nRestricting resource locations\n\nOrganization policy administrators can restrict the regions available where you can use Vertex AI by creating a resource locations constraint. Read about how a resource locations constraint applies to Vertex AI\n\nResource locations constraints don't apply to DataLabelingJob resources.\n\nWhat's next"
