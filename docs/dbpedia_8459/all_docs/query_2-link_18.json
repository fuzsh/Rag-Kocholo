        "text": "Qatar is a small country located on a peninsula in the west of the Persian Gulf. It is a stable absolute monarchy that enjoys one of the highest per capita incomes in the world due to its sizeable oil and natural gas reserves. The country borders Saudi Arabia to the south, and is otherwise bordered by coastline. Expatriates form the majority of Qatar's residents, with most being from South Asia and non-oil-rich Arab states. A growing economy and the government's encouragement of diversification and foreign investment make the country a popular destination for foreign business people. Most trips to Qatar are safe as the risk of both crime and civil unrest remains low. However, there is an underlying threat from transnational terrorist groups, who continue to threaten to carry out attacks against Western interests in the region.\n\nTensions with Qatar's regional neighbors were significant following the Qatar Crisis, which saw Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt, and the UAE sever diplomatic ties in June 2017. A subsequent land, air, and sea blockade was implemented. In January 2021, at the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Summit in Al Ula, the quartet of blockading states resumed normal diplomatic relations and lifted the blockade.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas conflict has resulted in heightened geopolitical tensions in the region. The conflict is unlikely to impact Qatar directly. The country and its Emir are playing a diplomatic role, in particular, in the negotiation between Hamas and Israel over the release of hostages and the passage of humanitarian aid. Several limited and contained protests in support of Hamas or Palestinians in Gaza have been reported in Qatar, but they are mostly peaceful and not disruptive.\n\nQatar's highway and road networks are in good condition, and the country can be traversed by road in a few hours. Sand and dust storms occur regularly, especially in the winter and spring, and can disrupt air and overland travel. Extreme temperatures in the summer can pose discomfort to travelers and a risk of heat stroke.\n\nRelations between Qatar and its regional neighbors have improved since January 2021 after Saudi Arabia and its allies agreed to lift the 2017 blockade. Civil unrest is extremely rare and rates of criminal activity are low, although foreign nationals may be targeted for petty theft including pickpocketing. There is an underlying threat of terrorism, particularly directed at Western interests in the country, and a number of regional and transnational groups such as the Islamic State (IS) have threatened Qatar in the past. However, Qatar's capable security forces and strict immigration policies help mitigate the threat.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas conflict has resulted in heightened geopolitical tensions in the region. The conflict is unlikely to impact Qatar directly. The country and its Emir are playing a diplomatic role, in particular, in the negotiation between Hamas and Israel over the release of hostages and the passage of humanitarian aid. Several limited and contained protests in support of Hamas or Palestinians in Gaza have been reported in Qatar, but they are mostly peaceful and not disruptive."
