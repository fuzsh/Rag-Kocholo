Specifically, the airline’s business class, known as Qsuites, is considered by many to be one of the best premium cabin products worldwide. In fact, a round-trip seat in Qsuites business class can cost upwards of $10,000 and more.\n\nDespite the high price tag for a Qsuites experience, travelers without megabucks can take a ride in style thanks to frequent flyer miles. Qatar Airways has a loyalty program of its own called Privilege Club. Let’s dig into Qatar’s Privilege Club program and see if you should have it on your radar."
