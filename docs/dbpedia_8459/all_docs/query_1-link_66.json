Location and Population\n\nQatar is a peninsula located halfway down the west coast of the Arabian Gulf. Its territory comprised of several islands including Halul, Sheraouh, Al-Ashat and others. It has maritime and land borders with Saudi Arabia and maritime boundaries with Bahrain, United Arab Emirates and Iran. The total land area of Qatar is approximately about 11,500 square kilometers. The terrain is flat and rocky with some low-rising limestone outcrops in Dukhan area in the west and Jabal Fiwairit in the north. It is characterized by a variety of geographical phenomena including many coves, inlets, depressions and surface rainwater-draining basins known as riyadh (the gardens), which are found mainly in the north and central part of the peninsula. These areas have the most fertile soil and are rich in vegetation.\n\nThe population of Qatar is 2,559,267 (1,936,536 males & 622,731 females) according to the Qatar Statistics Authority, which released its monthly preliminary figures on population as of 30 April, 2016. This data represents the number of persons all ages (Qataris and Non-Qataris) within the boundaries of the State of Qatar as of 30 April 2016. Moreover, it does not include Qatari nationals who were outside the State boundaries on April 30, 2016. Non-Qataris with residency permits who were outside the states boundaries on April 30, 2016. (For more information and update, see Qatar Planning and Statistics Authority)\n\nThe major cities are Doha, Al Wakrah, Al Khor, Dukhan, Al Shamal, Mesaieed, Ras Lafan and others. Doha is the capital city, the seat of government and the location of the main commercial and financial institutions. Situated halfway along the east coast of the peninsula, the city is an important cultural and commercial center with a vast commercial seaport and a modern international airport that link the country to the rest of the world. The majority of the population lives in Doha and its main suburb Al-Rayyan.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of the second Article of the Constitution, the capital of the state is Doha and it may be transferred to any other place by a law.\n\n1.2. Qatar Religion and Language\n\nQatar is an independent Arab State. Islam is the official religion of the country and Arabic is the official language in Qatar, and English is widely spoken. In accordance with the provisions of the first Article of the Constitution, “Qatar is an independent sovereign Arab State and the people of Qatar are a part of the Arab nation. Its religion is Islam.”\n\n1.3. History of Qatar\n\n1.3.1. The Ancient History\n\nThe land of Qatar was populated as early as 4000 BC, as shown by archaeological discoveries that were found in scattered areas across the country. In the 5th century BC the Greek historian Herodotus referred to the seafaring Canaanites as the original inhabitants of Qatar. Further, the geographer Ptolemy showed in his map of the Arab World “Qatara” as believed to refer to the Qatari town of “Zubara”, which had acquired fame by being one of the most important trading ports in the Gulf region at the time.\n\nQatar played an important role in Islamic civilization when its inhabitants participated in the formation and provision of the first naval fleet, which assembled to transport the army during the Islamic conquests. Under the Abbasid State during the 8th century AH (the 14th century AD), Qatar experienced great economic prosperity, as can be gleaned from the inscriptions on the Murwab Fort on the western coast of the peninsula, which bears the marks of the Abbasid architectural style.\n\nDuring the 16th century AD, the Qataris aligned with the Turks to drive out the Portuguese. Subsequently, Qatar, alongside the whole of the Arabian Peninsula, came under the Ottoman Empire rule for about four centuries. In the aftermath of the World War I, Turkish rule in Qatar ended and Qatar signed a protection treaty with Britain in 1916. However, the British influence in the country was limited to supervision of some administrative matters.\n\n1.3.2. The Modern History and Independence\n\nThe State of Qatar became an independent country on September 3 1971, by treaty of friendship between the state of Qatar and United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe rule of the State of Qatar is hereditary in the family of Al Thani, who settled in Qatar peninsula early in the 18th century. Qatar was ruled by the Al-Thani family, who take their name from their ancestor, Thani, father of Skeikh Mohammad Bin Thani, who was the first Sheikh to rule over the Qatari peninsula during the mid-19th century. The Al-Thani family was one among many tribal groups that settled for a long time at the Gibrin oasis in the southern Najd, before their arrival at Qatar during the early 18th century. It is a branch of the Bani Tamim tribe, whose descent can be traced back to Mudar Bin Nizar. Initially they settled in Zubara in the north of the peninsula, moving to Doha in the mid-19th century under the leadership of Sheikh Mohammad Bin Thani.\n\n1.3.3. Timeline\n\nIn 1878 Sheikh Jassim Bin Mohammad succeeded his father Sheikh Mohammad bin Thani. In 1913 Sheikh Abdallah bin Jassim came to power. It was in his time when oil was first discovered in Qatar. In 1940 Sheikh Hamad Bin Abdullah ruled Qatar until 1948. In 1949 Sheikh Ali bin Abdallah came to power and ruled until 1960. And in that year, Sheikh Ahmad Bin Ali ruled Qatar and his reign continued until 1972. On September 3rd, 1971 Qatar became independent. In 1972, Sheikh Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani ruled the country. In 1995 Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani assumed power with the support and blessings of the ruling family and the Qatari people.\n\nIn 1999 the election of the municipal council was the first electoral process taking place in Qatar in modern history. According to the Law (12) for the year of 1998 it took place the organization of the Central Municipal Council.\n\nHolidays: Qataris celebrate the standard Islamic holidays, including Ramadan and the two Ids, ʿId Al- Fitr and ʿĪd Al-Adha. They also celebrate several secular holidays, such as Independence Day and the anniversary of the emir’s ascension to power.\n\n2. The Qatar Legal System\n\nShari’a (Islamic law) is the main source of legislations. The first Article of the Permanent Constitution of Qatar states, “Qatar is an independent sovereign Arab State and the people of Qatar are a part of the Arab nation. Its religion is Islam and Shari’a law (Islamic Religious Law) is main source of its legislations. Its political system is democratic. The Arabic language shall be its official language”.\n\n2.1. The Basic System\n\n2.1.1. Issuance and Amendment of the Constitution\n\nOn 19th April 1971, the drafting committee of the Permanent Constitution issued the Constitution Provisional Amended Basic Statute that defined the system of rule in the State, organized its authorities and established the fundamental principles of its policy. The H.H. Emir decree (No.11) of the year 1999 issued for the preparation of a committee for the new Constitution. The H.H. Emir was keen on finding committee members that were men of intellect, opinion and expertise. The H.H. Emir directed the committee towards the establishment of a modern state by enhancing the role of Shari’a, democracy and the popular participation of the citizenry in decision making.\n\nAfter a 3-year period was set for the preparation of the Constitution, the voters agreed to the new Constitution of the country on Tuesday 29th April 2004 by expressing their opinions at the ballot boxes. The new Constitution underlined the main outlines of the Constitution that would be a signpost to the building and defining of the system of the rule and determining the State’s authorities and their specializations, and their relations to each other and the citizens.\n\n2.1.2. Amendment of Constitution\n\nBy Article 144 of the Permanent Constitution, the Emir or one third of the Members of the Shoura Council each shall have the prerogative to apply for the amendment of one or more of the articles of the Constitution. If a majority of the members of the Council accept the amendment in principle, the Council may discuss it article by article. The amendment shall be passed by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Council. The said amendment shall not enter into force before the approval of the Emir and its publication in the official Gazette. If, on the other hand, the proposal for amendment rejected in principle or in subject, it may not be re-introduced before the lapse of one year from the date of its rejection.\n\nThe Articles (145:149) of the Permanent Constitution add that the provisions pertaining to the rule of the state and its inheritance thereof may not be subject to application for amendment. Provisions pertaining to rights and public liberties may not be subject to amendment save for the purpose of granting more rights and guarantees in the interests of the citizens.\n\nFurthermore, the functions of the Emir set forth in this Constitution may not be subject to an application for amendment during the term of his deputation. The Article 148 of the Constitution makes clear that no article of this Constitution may be proposed for amendment before the lapse of a period of ten years from the date of its coming into force. And Article 149 adds that no provision of this Constitution may be suspended save where martial laws are in force and within the limits specified by the law; however, the convening of the session of the Shoura Council may not be suspended nor should the immunity of its Members be violated during this period.\n\n2.2. The Values of Justice and of Issuance of Laws\n\nArticle 35 of the Constitution clearly states that all persons are equal before the law and there shall be no discrimination whatsoever on grounds of sex, race, language, or religion.\n\nThe relationship between national and international law is dualistic in the Qatari legal system, and treaties, including conventions, are not self-executing and have to be implemented into Qatari legislation (art. 6 of the Constitution). Qatar is a hereditary constitutional monarchy. With the Constitution of 2003, Qatar adopted the principle of separation of powers Article 60. The legislative authority is vested in the Shura Council in accordance with the Constitution, and the Executive power is vested in the Emir, assisted by the Council of Ministers. Courts are divided into criminal and civil courts, at two levels. A Supreme Council supervises the proper functioning of courts of law and their auxiliary organs. The judicial system also includes the Constitutional Court.\n\nThe Constitution confirms the established principles of law; for example, in addition to Article 35 discussed above, Article 39 points out that an accused person is presumed innocent until his conviction is proved before a court of law wherein the necessary guarantees of the right of self-defense are secured. Article 40 of the Constitution adds that “no crime and no punishment save as prescribed by the law and no penalties save on the acts committed subsequent to the enforcement of that law.” The provisions of the laws shall have no effect save on the acts committed from the date of the enforcement of the said laws. These provisions shall have no effect on the acts which occurred prior to the enforcement of the said laws; however, it may be stipulated otherwise by a majority of two-thirds of the Shoura Council in case of non-criminal provisions.\n\nIssuance of Laws: The first Article of the Permanent Constitution of the State of Qatar points out that Shari’a law (Islamic Religious Law) shall be a main source for its legislations. Its political system is democratic.\n\nArticles 105 and 106 of the Permanent Constitution clearly state that every member of the Council shall have the right to propose bills. Every proposal shall be referred to the relevant committee in the Council for study, making recommendation and submission to the Council. If the Council accepts the proposal, it shall be referred in draft form to the Government for study and opinion. Such a draft shall be returned to the Council during the same or the following term of session. Also, any bill rejected by the Council may not be re-introduced during the same term of session.\n\nAny draft law passed by the Council shall be referred to the Emir for ratification. If the Emir declines to approve the draft law, he shall return it along with the reasons for such declination to the Council within a period of three months from the date of referral. In the event that a draft law is returned to the Council within the period specified in the preceding paragraph and the Council passes the same once more with a two-thirds majority of all its members, the Emir shall ratify and promulgate it. The Emir may, in compelling circumstances order the suspension of this law for the period that he deems necessary to serve the higher interests of the country. If, however, the draft law is not passed by a two-thirds majority, it shall not be reconsidered within the same term of session.\n\nThe Emir may, in the event of exceptional cases that require measures of utmost urgency which necessitate the issue of special laws and in case that the Shoura Council is not in session, issue pertinent decrees that have the power of law by the use of Article 70 of the Constitution. Such decree-laws shall be submitted to the Shoura Council at its first meeting, and the Council may within a maximum period of fourteen days from the date of submission and with a two-thirds majority of its Members reject any of these decree-laws or request amendment thereof to be effected within a specified period of time. Such decree-laws shall cease to have the power of law from the date of their rejection by the Council or when the period for effecting the amendments has expired.\n\nOfficial Gazette: The power of law starts after publication in the official Gazette. The Qatar Gazette is issued in the Department of Opinion & Contracts/Ministry of Justice.\n\nDifferent legislations are issued in Qatar laws in many different areas; for example, there is civil legislation )15/1980), law on the issuance of maritime law (22/2004 Civil Code), penal legislation (11/2004 Penal Code, 23/2004 Code of Criminal Procedure, 3/2004 Law on Combating Terrorism, 9/1987 Law in the Fight Against Narcotic Drugs), economic legislation (14/1995), Law on the establishment of the Doha Securities Market (2/1999) law in the fight against fraud in commercial transactions, (13/2000) Law on the organization of foreign capital in economic activity, (5/2002) Law of Commercial Companies, (28/2002) Law on Anti-Money Laundering, (5/2005) Law on the Protection of Trade Secrets, (7/2005) Law of the QFC) passports Legislation and policy, communications Legislation, committees and associations of private and public, Legislation, ministries, bodies and institutions, Property and real estate legislation ,Security legislation, protection and civil defense, Legislation, science and technology , legislation, culture, art and literature, Legislation, Youth and Sports, Educational legislation, Family legislation and social security, legislation on citizenship and other legislation ([1]).\n\n2.3. Conclusion of Treaties and Agreements\n\nThe Article 68 of the Permanent Constitution gives to the Emir the power toconclude treaties and agreements by a decree and refer them to the Shoura Council accompanied with appropriate explanatory notes. The treaty or agreement shall have the power of law after ratification and publication in the Official Gazette; however, reconciliation treaties and treaties pertaining to the territory of the State or those relating to the right of sovereignty or public or private rights of the citizens, or those that involve an amendment of the laws of the State shall come into force when the same are issued as a law. Under no case may a treaty include secret conditions contradicting its publicized conditions.\n\n3. Head of State\n\nThe system of government in the State of Qatar is hereditary in the family of Al Thani and in the line of the male descendants of Hamad bin Khalifa bin Hamad bin Abdullah bin Qassim. The Permanent Constitution of the State of Qatar and Law 15/2006 on the Rule of Law on the State and Inheritance Governance comprises the work and system of Governance.\n\nThe rule is inherited by the son named as Heir Apparent by the Emir after consultation with members of the Ruling Family and the people of wisdom in the State. In case there is no such son, the prerogatives of rule are passed to the member of the family named by the Emir as Heir Apparent. In this case, his male descendants shall inherit the rule.\n\n3.1.

The Deputy Emir shall, as soon as he is so designated, take, before the Emir, the same oath as taken by the Heir Apparent.\n\n3.3. The Council of the Ruling Family\n\nArticles 14:15 of the Constitution state that “there shall be established a Council by an Emir Resolution named ‘The Council of the Ruling Family’.” The Emir shall appoint the members of such Council from amongst the members of the ruling family. The Council of the Ruling Family shall fill the vacancy of the position of the Emir in the event of his demise or when he becomes totally incapacitated to discharge his functions.

The Judicial Authority\n\nThe Permanent Constitution of the State of Qatar and other laws, such as 13/1990 Code of Civil Procedure and the Commercial No. 13 of 1990 as amended by Act No. 7 of 1995 and Act No. 13 of 2005, 10/2002 Law on Public Prosecution, 10/2003 of the Authority Law, 12/2005 of a Law on the Appeal Procedures and non-discrimination in the criminal, 7/2007 Act on the disposition of administrative disputes, 12/2008 law establishing the Supreme Constitutional Court organizes the work and system of Judicial Authority.\n\nThe Judicial Authority shall be vested in courts of law as prescribed in the Constitution. Court judgments shall be pronounced in the name of the Emir, according to Article 63 of the Constitution. The judicial system is organized and established by judicial law, in terms of which litigation is divided into three stages: the courts of first instance, the courts of appeal and the court of cassation.\n\nCivil trials are based on written pleadings and rebuttals. Criminal trials are based mostly on oral arguments. Proceedings in all courts are conducted in Arabic. Translators are provided for non-Arabic speaking litigants. Decisions of the lower courts can be appealed before the courts of appeal and then, in most cases, to the court of cassation. The law provides that the court of cassation shall have a technical office; one of its tasks would be to extract and publish legal principles established by the court. These principles will lead the lower courts to follow decisions of the court of cassation.\n\nArticles 129:135 of the Constitution state that the judicial authority shall be independent, and it shall be vested in courts of different types and grades. The courts shall make their judgments according to the law. The judges are independent and shall not be subject to any power in the exercise of their judicial functions as provided by the law and no interference whatsoever shall be permitted with court proceedings and the course of justice.\n\nThe supremacy of law is the basis of rule in the State. The honor of the judiciary, its integrity, and impartiality of judges are a safeguard of rights and liberties. The law shall regulate the categories and divisions of courts and define their jurisdiction and powers. In addition, the law shall regulate the categories and divisions of courts and define their jurisdiction and powers. The Court sessions shall be public save when a court decides, for the interest of public order or morality, to only make them public via camera. In all cases, the pronouncement of judgments shall be made in an open session.\n\nAccording to the provisions of the state of Qatar (Articles 132, 136, 137, 138, 140 of the Constitution), the judicial authority law, issued in 2003, defines the manners in which courts of law shall play their role in society. It stipulates that judges are independent and shall not be subject to removal from office save in cases specified by the law. The independence of the judiciary is inviolable and is protected by law against interference from other authorities. And other laws, such as 13/1990 Code of Civil Procedure and the Commercial No. 13 of 1990 as amended by Act No. 7 of 1995 and Act No. 13 of 2005, 10/2002 Law on Public Prosecution, 12/2005 Law on Appeal Procedures and Non-discrimination in the Criminal, 7/2007 Act on the disposition of administrative disputes and 12/2008 law establishing the Supreme Constitutional Court The judicial authorities and courts of law are described in the following section.\n\n4.3.1.

Overview of Qatar Economy and Business Laws\n\n5.1. Economy and Business of Qatar\n\nQatar’s economic prosperity is derived from the extraction and export of petroleum — discovered in 1939 and first produced in 1949 — and natural gas. Before World War II, Qatar’s population engaged in pearling, fishing, and some trade (with a few exceptions, these were the only occupations available) and was one of the poorest in the world. By the 1970’s, however, native Qataris enjoyed one of the highest per capita incomes in the world, despite subsequent declines in income due to fluctuations in world oil prices. Qatar’s original oil concession was granted to the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC), a consortium of European and American firms.\n\nQatar’s economic ascent in recent years is due in large part to its successful development of its hydrocarbon resources and robust and mutually rewarding relationships with international partners. Geopolitics in the Arabian Gulf and the shifting tides of energy demand in distant markets have also played a role. Today Qatar is one of the wealthiest nations in the world, With the second highest GDP per capita of more than 70000USD, on the strength of oil and natural gas exports.\n\nIn 2005, the Qatar Financial Center started to attract international financial services and multinational corporations to grow and develop the market for financial services and multinational corporations in the region. Over the next five years, The QFC estimates that it will provide access to over USD 1 trillion-planned investment across the Gulf Cooperation council states.\n\nQatar was invited to join the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes as a “relevant jurisdiction” in 2008. It joined the new global forum in December 2009 and committed to implementing international standards of transparency and exchange information. Qatar is ranked 48th for the year 2014 in the Ease of Doing Business’ ratings (out of 189 economies) maintained by The World Bank\n\nIn 2011, Qatar launched Qatar National Development Strategy 2011-2016, demonstrating the Qatar National Vision 2030. QNV 2030 articulates three interrelated goals for the economy. It looks to sustain a high standard of living, to expand innovation and entrepreneurial capabilities and to align economic outcomes with economic and financial stability. To embed sustainability, which means meeting the needs of the current generation without compromising those of future generations, in Qatar’s economy, QNV 2030 demonstrated that progress is needed in three parallel, mutually reinforcing directions. First, the country will enlarge the value of the productive base, which is necessary to sustain prosperity in an economy with a growing population and to expand the potential for future generations. Second, the government will guard against economic instability and promote increased efficiency. Third, the government will work in partnership with the private sector to diversify the economy and foster a culture of discovery and innovation.\n\n5.2. Qatar Business Laws\n\nCommercial law alongside the commercial companies are the main axis of business law in Qatar. The Commercial Law of Qatar 27/2006 Law on Promulgating the Trading Regulation Law and its amendments cover all commercial activities like commercial contracts, commercial agency, trademarks, trade names, unfair competition, banking operations, bill of exchange, bankruptcy etc.\n\nA new companies’ law in Qatar, the 11/2015 law, offers investors a more attractive investment environment. The law provides more details and clarity than the previous one. Further, it provides guidance in relation to certain matters, as new forms of companies and respect to the incorporation procedures of companies.\n\nThe 11/2015 Law on Commercial Companies was officially published in the Official Gazette on July 7, 2015 and applicable effective August 7, 2015. As of February 2016, the law states that all addressees should adjust their situation in accordance with the provisions of the attached law within 6 months’ period from its effective applicable date. The following are the key changes in the new Commercial Companies law.\n\n5.3.1.

Shares are distributed amongst public shareholders and can be traded on the stock exchange.\n\nA PSC cannot give cash loans to its board members, except for banks or other financial institutions who can grant loan and open credit facilities in accordance with the credit rules set out by the Qatar Central Bank. BOD remunerations should not exceed 5% of net profit after deduction of legal reserve, legal deductions and contribution and distribution of dividends to shareholders.\n\nThe chairman of the board shall issue the full set of financial statements 15 days before the scheduled annual general meeting in 2 local newspapers; one in English and one in Arabic, and he will send one copy to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry prior to publishing on company’s website.\n\nThe general assembly should be held at least once a year and within 4 months of the end of the financial year, and the agenda should include:\n\nReading the BOD report\n\nDiscuss financial performance and position and discuss improvement\n\nDiscuss corporate governance report\n\nSuggest distribution of profits\n\nAppointment of auditors\n\nReviewing BOD members, a General Assembly is only valid if attended by shareholders holding in total 50% of the capital, the representative of the Ministry and the auditor\n\nControl over Listing:\n\nApproval of the Subscription by the Company\n\nAppointment of offering shares and following up the IPO\n\nFollow up on the implementation decision on increase/decrease of share capital\n\nSetting procedures to trade of shares and Setting conditions to disclose situation on financial reporting and corporate governance.\n\n5.3.3.

Legal reserve allocation can stop once the legal reserve has reached 50% of the share capital. This reserve can be used to offset the company’s losses or increase its capital through a GA meeting of partners.\n\nAccumulation of Loss: If the loss of an LLC exceeds 50% of the share capital, the management has to call for a partners’ meeting and the partners should resolve to either dissolve the company or increase its share capital. If managers fail to call for a partners meeting, or if this resolution is not passed, then the managers or partners according to the situation will become jointly and severally responsible for the company’s commitments\n\nAnnual Accounts: Companies to prepare the final accounts (balance sheet and P&L), report on company’s operations, and suggestions for profit distribution within 2 months after the reporting date and file it along with the auditor report with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry within a period of a month after preparation of the document.\n\nAnnual General Meeting (AGM) – the partner’s general assembly agenda in its annual meeting should include the following:\n\nDiscussion of the report of the directors for the company’s activities and financial position during the year and the auditor’s report.\n\nDiscussion of the statement of financial position and profit and loss accounts and approve them.\n\nDetermine the profits to be distributed to partners.\n\nAppointment of the managers, board of directors, or member of supervisory board if any, and determine their remuneration.\n\nAppointment of auditors and determine his fees\n\nOther matters falling within their responsibilities under this law or the partners’ agreement.\n\n5.3.4.

Framework of Natural Resources\n\nGovernment agencies provide very little information on the legal framework governing natural resources. No supervisory or regulatory body oversees resource extraction or revenue management. The Ministry of Energy and Industry regulates Qatar’s oil and natural gas policy, subject to the ultimate control of the Emir of Qatar.\n\nUnder the Qatar Petroleum Law, Qatar Petroleum manages upstream, midstream and downstream oil and gas operations on behalf of the Government. Qatar Petroleum acts as the state’s investment arm in the oil and gas sector. The oil and gas industry (including LNG) is overall regulated by the Natural Resources Law (Law No. (3) of 2007 regarding the Exploitation of Natural Resources and its Sources (Natural Resources Law). Oil and natural gas, as well as other mineral resources, are the property of the state. The Ministry of Energy and Industry regulates Qatar’s policy on oil and gas, subject to the ultimate control of the Emir of Qatar. Qatar Petroleum is entrusted with management and development of all of Qatar’s hydrocarbon resources. There is little detail in the Natural Resources law as to how this is to be implemented.\n\nThe right to explore, develop and produce petroleum is typically granted by way of development and production sharing agreements (DPSAs) and exploration and production sharing agreements (EPSAs) with Qatar Petroleum. Qatar Petroleum (and, through it, the Government) therefore determines the basis on which an entity participates in the Qatari oil and gas (including LNG) industry.\n\nLNG projects are usually integrated with the corresponding upstream development. The key legislation in relation to oil and gas exploration and production include:\n\nDecree-Law No. (4) of 1977 on Preserving Oil Wealth.\n\nDecree-Law No. (10) of 1974 concerning the Establishment of Qatar Petroleum (and its amendments).\n\nDecree-Law No. (30) of 2002 issuing the Environmental Protection Law.\n\nLaw No. (8) of 2004 concerning Protection of the Maritime Facilities of Petrol and Gas.\n\nDecision No. (4) of 2005 of the President of the Supreme Council of Environment and Natural Protection concerning the issuance of the Executive Regulations of the Environmental Protection Law issued by Decree-Law No. (30) of 2002.\n\nLaw No. (3) of 2007 regarding the Exploitation of Natural Resources and its Sources.\n\nDecree- Law No. (15) of 2007 concerning the Organization of Marketing and Sale of Regulated Products Outside the State of Qatar (Tasweeq Law).\n\nOwnership Natural resources (including oil and natural gas) are state property under the Natural Resources Law. Under the Law, Qatar Petroleum has exclusive rights to explore, develop and produce oil and gas in Qatar, with authority to grant rights to third parties to carry out petroleum operations.\n\nRights are granted to investors through EPSAs or DPSAs (collectively PSAs) For joint venture companies, especially in LNG projects Qatar Petroleum typically uses agreements called Development and Fiscal Agreements (DFAs). Qatar Petroleum signs the agreements on behalf of the state. In order to become effective, they must be approved by a decree of the Emir of Qatar.\n\nIn general, different authorizations are not issued for different stages of development. The PSAs and DFAs typically embody the principal authorizations necessary for the exploration, development and production of hydrocarbons. The terms of the PSAs and DFAs are not generally in the public domain.\n\n5.5. Framework of Banking\n\nThe Qatar Central Bank (QCB) licenses and regulates 18 banks as of January 2015, a figure which has been steadily growing since Arab Bank became the first QCB-licensed lender in 1957. Seven of these institutions are national, conventional lenders, which between them operated 189 branches as of December 2014, according to central bank data.\n\nLocal banks dominate the market in terms of assets and infrastructure, but compete for business with seven foreign banks, which have played an important part in Qatar’s economic life for over half a century. While their presence in the country is limited to 16 branches, their number includes global giants.\n\nThe traditional lenders – both national and foreign – have faced increasing competition in recent years from sharia-compliant lenders, the first of which, Qatar Islamic Bank (QIB), was licensed in 1983. It has been joined in the Islamic segment by three institutions, the most recent entrant being Barwa Bank, which received permission to operate from the QCB in 2009. In addition to QCB-licensed banks, more than 20 institutions operate from the separate regulatory environment of the Qatar Financial Centre (QFC), though their activity is often conducted through representative offices.\n\n5.5.1. Qatar Central Bank (QCB)\n\nQatar’s monetary and banking system is headed by the Qatar Central Bank (QCB). The bank supervises all banks and money exchange companies in Qatar. In 1993, the QCB was established to assume the functions of the Qatar Monetary Agency. The bank was set up in part to make it independent of the Ministry of Finance and Petroleum. The QCB is responsible for assuring that all banks operating in Qatar comply with international standards and auditing procedures. Total assets of all banks operating in Qatar was estimated at $13.8 billion in 2000. As of 1999, there were 14 banks operating in Qatar: seven national, two Arab, and six foreign. There were also 10 money exchange companies. The Qatar National Bank is the largest with total assets exceeding $5 billion.\n\nThe Qatari Riyal was fixed to the US dollar at a rate of US $1=QR 3.65 in June 1980 and has remained at that rate to date. However, for practical purposes the rate is US $1=QR 3.639. Because the exchange rate is fixed, Qatar cannot employ monetary policy for domestic price regulation and employment objectives. The International Monetary Fund reports that in 2001, currency and demand deposits—an aggregate commonly known as M1—were equal to $1.4 billion. In that same year, M2—an aggregate equal to M1 plus savings deposits, small time deposits, and money market mutual funds—was $7.9 billion.\n\nThe Government of Qatar recently issued the new Central Bank Law, Law No. 13 of 2012 (the “QCB Law”), which came into force in January 2013.\n\nThis new piece of legislation is a comprehensive overhaul of the legislation that existed previously, Law No. 33 of 2006 (the Old QCB Law). The Qatar Central Bank (the “QCB”) is the primary regulator of financial institutions operating in Qatar, and the QCB Law has now expanded its supervisory powers to cover the insurance sector and the Qatar Financial Centre. The QCB Law addresses many issues for the first time, including Islamic banking, mergers, and acquisitions of financial institutions, credit rating agencies, insurance, treating customers fairly, and resolution of failing banks.\n\n5.5.2. Anti-Money Laundering Law\n\nThe Financial Services Regulations confer upon the QFC Regulatory Authority responsibility in relation to the prevention and detection of money laundering, terrorist financing or other financial crime in the QFC.\n\nThe QFC Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Terrorism Financing Rules provide the QFC compliance framework and detailed requirements in relation to AML/CFT. The rules have been designed to be in accordance with the State Law – No (4) of 2010 Anti-Money Laundering Law and aligned to the Financial Action Task Force global recommendations and standards. In addition, relevant Qatari criminal laws in relation to this subject continue to apply in the QFC. The principal Qatari laws are provided below:\n\nAdministrative Order No. (1-2004) Establishing the FIU and its Organizational Structure\n\nAnti-Money Laundering Law No. (4) of 2010\n\nLaw No (3) of 2004 on Combating Terrorism\n\nLaw No. (11) of 2004 (Penal Code of Qatar)\n\nLaw No. (23) of 2004 (Code of Criminal Procedures)\n\n5.6. Framework of Tax and Customs Laws\n\nQatar Tax Administration: Qatar is the second easiest country to pay taxes in, and tax payments are considered to be among the least problematic factors when doing business in the country. Qatari nationals are exempt from income and corporate taxes. There are no other major taxes apart from customs duties. Foreign corporations operating in Qatar pay a 10% corporate tax rate, except in oil and gas operations, where the general tax rate is 35%.\n\nQatar Customs Administration: Undocumented customs payments are reported to be rare, and the border administration is considered transparent. The Qatari e-government portal Hukoomi provides all the necessary information concerning customs and port laws. The General Authority of Customs website is a one-stop shop for customs-related matters. The standard export of goods takes less time and procedures than the regional average.\n\nThe State of Qatar has signed multiple conventions with many countries regarding the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and on capital.\n\n5.7. Framework of Stock Exchange Laws\n\nEstablished in 1995, the Doha Securities Market (DSM) officially started operations in 1997. Since then the exchange has grown to become one of the leading stock markets in the GCC region. In accordance with these Laws and the QFC Anti Money Laundering Regulations, firms may be required, amongst other things, to make suspicious transaction reports to the Qatar Financial Information Unit. When doing so, firms should use the relevant template report form.\n\nQatar’s economic ascent of recent years has few parallels. It was not preordained by its bountiful carbon resources, nor did it occur merely by chance. Many countries blessed by resources have failed to prosper and develop. In Qatar, successful development of its hydrocarbon resources followed from visionary and committed national leadership, robust and mutually rewarding relationships with international partners, and vigorous execution. Geopolitics in the Arabian Gulf and the shifting tides of energy demand in distant markets have also played a role.\n\nQatar is ranked 83rd for the year 2019 out of 189 countries in the Ease of Doing Business’ ratings (out of 189 economies) maintained by The World Bank. In June 2009, Qatar Holding, the strategic and direct investment arm of Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), and NYSE Euronext, the world’s leading exchange group, signed an agreement to form a major strategic partnership to establish the Exchange as a world-class market. The DSM was renamed the Qatar Stock Exchange on the conclusion of the deal.\n\nThe primary aim of the Qatar Stock Exchange is to support Qatar’s economy by providing a venue for capital raising for Qatari companies as part of their corporate strategy and giving investors a platform through which they can trade a variety of products in a transparent and efficient manner. The Qatar Stock Exchange also provides the public with access to market information and ensures correct disclosure of information.\n\nRegulation of the Exchange: The Qatar Stock Exchange is regulated by the Qatar Financial Markets Authority (QFMA). The QFMA is an independent and empowered regulatory and supervisory authority for the capital markets in Qatar. On September 14, 2005, Law No (33) for the Year 2002 was issued relevant to the establishment of QFMA and the Doha Securities Market Company (DSMC). And on April 3, 2005, a law was issued amending some provisions of Law No (13) of the Year 2000 regulating the foreign investment in the economic activities. The amendment allows non-Qatari’s to invest in all companies listed at the QSE (DSM formerly) at a rate not exceeding 25% of the traded shares.\n\nThe Board of Management of the Qatar Financial Markets Authority was issued the Resolution No. 2/2015 Amending some provisions of decision No. 2 /2014 issued Acquisitions and Mergers System (M&A).\n\n5.8.

Transparency\n\nThe assessment of the legal and regulatory framework of Qatar was carried out in accordance with the international standards for transparency and exchange of information as described in the Global Forum’s Terms of Reference and was prepared using the Global Forum’s Methodology for Peer Reviews and Non-Member Reviews. The assessment was based on the laws, regulations, and exchange of information mechanisms as at May 2010, other materials supplied by Qatar, and information supplied by partner jurisdictions.\n\nThe Terms of Reference break down the standards of transparency and exchange of information into 10 essential elements and 31 enumerated aspects under three broad categories: (A) availability of information; (B) access to information; and (C) exchanging information.\n\nThis review assesses Qatar’s legal and regulatory framework against these elements and each of the enumerated aspects. In respect of each essential element a determination is made that either (i) the element is in place, (ii) the element is in place but certain aspects of the legal implementation of the element need improvement, or (iii) the element is not in place. These determinations are accompanied by recommendations for improvement where relevant.\n\nQatar is ranked 22nd in the Corruption Perceptions Index 2015 made by Transparency International. The State of Qatar has been ranked first among the Gulf and Arab countries in Transparency International’s (TI) Corruption Perception Index (CPI) 2015.\n\nThe State of Qatar is exerting many efforts aimed at promoting national transparency and integrity indicators, improving its indexes and rank among the most developed countries in terms of transparency and integrity in the world.\n\nTo achieve this target, the State of Qatar has added a number of legislations in line with international agreements, particularly the United Nations Convention Against Corruption in order to enhance transparency, integrity, promote full control of state funds, protect public money from waste and promote international cooperation as a top priority by profiting of international expertise and successful experiences.\n\n6.2. Audit and Public Audit\n\nAudit: The following forms of companies must have an audit:\n\nPublic Listed companies\n\nLimited liability companies\n\nLimited Partnership Company\n\nPrivate Shareholding Company\n\nHolding companies\n\nJoint Companies\n\nAll publicly listed companies shall have an annual and semi-annual audit. Most companies with foreign shareholders carry out an annual audit, especially for the purpose of tax declaration. Most 100% Qatari owned companies do not carry out an audit of their annual accounts unless the shareholders ask for one or there are requirements by other third parties (for example, banks and other regulatory bodies) or to meet any other specific requirement\n\nPublic Audit: All the companies in Qatar are required to prepare their financial statements in accordance with the accounting principles approved internationally. In the absence of national accounting principles and practices, the Ministry of Economy and Commerce accepts financial reports prepared according to standards promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). Most companies prepare their financial reports in accordance with International Financial Reporting standards (IFRS). The Public Listed Companies financial reports must comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and International Accounting Standards (IAS).\n\n6.3. Overview of United Nations Convention against Corruption\n\nThe legal and institutional framework of the State of Qatar is in the context of implementation of the United Nations Convention against Corruption that the State of Qatar (Qatar) signed on 1 December 2005 and ratified by Decree 17 of 2007 on 30 January 2007. The Convention entered into force for Qatar on 1 March 2007.\n\nThe laws of Qatar criminalize bribery and trading in influence (arts. 15, 16, 18 and 21). Qatar criminalizes active bribery of national public officials pursuant to article 141 read in conjunction with article 140 of the Penal Code (PC), provided that the offer or the promise is accepted. The same penalty applies to the intermediary.\n\nThe institutions most relevant in the fight against corruption are the Public Prosecution office, which has a dedicated department handling corruption and money-laundering cases, the Administrative Control and Transparency Authority and Qatar Financial Information Unit (FIU).\n\n6.4. Qatar Public Procurement\n\nA new Tenders Law has recently been decreed in Qatar and was effective on 2016 . Following a recognized need for a set of uniform guidelines bringing more clarity to the public procurement process the new law has been a positive step forward. It revamps and modernizes the governmental contracting process in the State of Qatar.\n\nThe new law applies to most governmental and quasi-governmental contracts of the State of Qatar. It can also apply to private entities receiving state funding. Government contracting in Qatar offers lucrative opportunities for local and international businesses that know how to take advantage of them.\n\n6.5. Conflicts of Interest\n\nTogether with the traditional methods of governmental contracting, the new law introduces competition as a method of procurement for technical works, including drawings and designs. It also extends to two-stage tendering which can assist in defining the technical requirement and the scope of work. At the same time, it secures appointments based on the right contractor, agreed costs and appropriate transfer of risk.\n\nTo manage conflicts of interest the new law requires relevant government employees to declare any potential interest, whether directly or indirectly, in any governmental contract, which brings the law in line with international best practice.\n\n6.6. Dispute Resolution Committee\n\nThe new law introduces a dispute resolution committee which is headed by a senior judge and has jurisdiction to hear all pre-contract execution disputes. This allows for a specialized forum for disputes in relation to government contracts\n\n7. University Education and Research\n\n7.1.
