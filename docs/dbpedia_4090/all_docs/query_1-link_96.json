        "text": "Sixty years ago, the forces of the Allied armies of World War II launched the largest land, air and sea operation ever undertaken, called \"Overlord.\" On D-Day, a force more than 150,000 troops strong invaded occupied France to fight the German army. A timeline of events following D-Day:\n\nJune 6, 1944: An Allied force of more than 150,000 troops, 5,000 ships and 800 aircraft assault 50 miles of northern France's Normandy coastline. More than 4,000 Allied troops die, and 6,000 are wounded, but the Allies succeed in breaching Hitler's coastal defense of France.\n\nJune 26, 1944: The Allies capture the French port of Cherbourg; the Germans are on the retreat.\n\nAugust 25, 1944: Allied troops, with the help of the French resistance led by Gen. Charles de Gaulle, liberate Paris after four years of German occupation.\n\nDec. 16, 1944: The Battle of the Bulge, the last German offensive on the Western Front, begins. Hitler orders a quarter-million troops across Luxembourg to push back the Allied forces. German troops advance 50 miles into the Allied lines, creating a deadly \"bulge\" into Allied defenses.\n\nJan. 16, 1945: The Battle of the Bulge ends with a defeat and retreat for Germany as its supplies grow short and its forces are overcome by Allied resistance.\n\nFeb. 4, 1945: U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Soviet leader Josef Stalin meet at Yalta in the Crimea. The U.S. and Britain agree to allow Stalin to control Eastern Europe after the war ends.\n\nMarch 1945: German forces retreat into Germany as U.S. troops cross the Rhine on the country's Western Front.\n\nApril 30, 1945: As Soviet forces from the Eastern Front encircle Berlin, Hitler, in a bombproof bunker, poisons his mistress, Eva Braun, and shoots himself. Their bodies are hastily cremated in a garden."
