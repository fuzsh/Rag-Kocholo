        "text": "PRESIDENT de GAULLE'S reeognition of Communist China was immediately condemned by the State Department; his policy of neutrality for Southeast Asia was condemned a few days later by President Johnson. American officialdom, like British officialdom, disapproves of de Gaulle. He is often described (privately if not publicly) as a narrow, vainglorious egotist who is sabotaging the Western alliance. Is this a fair description ?\n\nIt is not. Far from being a saboteur, de Gaulle is the stanchest and most constructive of Western leaders today. Indeed, he is the leading individual in the West, though the United States is, of course, the Ieading nation. His ascendancy derives from the power, the originality, the subtlety and the prescience of his mind; also from his legendary and truly heroic record. Alone of the giants who stood against Hitler, he is still in a position of command; the rest are in retirement or in their\n\nJOHN GRIGG—formerly Lord Altrincham—is an English journalist who writes a weekly column for The Guardian of Manchester. graves. His courage—moral, as well as physical—is a byword. He is a man people instinctively look up to, in more senses than one.\n\nLike all great men, he has his faults, but most of them are the defects of qualities. Thus his superb consistency and steadiness of purpose are accompanied by a certain inflexibility in matters of secondary importance, which may at times be mistaken for pettiness. His sublime self‐confidence could not exist without a touch of arrogance, his patriotism contains a few drops of the poison of chauvinism—and so on.\n\nSome of his faults, however, are a legacy from earlier stages in his career, especially from his experiences in World War II, when he was treated by Winston Churchill as an unruly vassal, by Franklin D Roosevelt as a maniac with no claim to represent France. If he now has an emotional bias against what he calls “the Anglo‐Saxons,” is it altogether to be wondered at ? He acquired his prejudices in a hard school.\n\nBesides, we must remember that the French as a nation feel, with some justice, that they have made disproportionate sacrifices in the present cen tury, a feeling that de Gaulle undoubtedly shares. He saw his country bled white in the 1914–18 war; maintaining, at vast cost, a full state of military preparedness between the wars, while others disarmed; facing the deadly impact of Hitler's blitzkrieg more or less singlehanded in 1940. He knows how much his country has suffered as a result of British ambiguity and American isolationism. In his eyes, the English‐speaking nations have won kudos for themselves and promoted their own interests at the expense of France, and have then added insult to injury by excluding France from their councils.\n\nBUT any faults that he may have, any festering resentments, are as nothing compared with his enormous merits. Though he may not be emotionally generous, he is intellectually magnanimous; his mind, which is deeply philosophic and steeped in history, provides a natural corrective to any excess of anti‐British or anti‐American feeling. Above all, he is a good ally in the cold war.\n\nHe has never had any illusions about Communism and has never believed in negotiating with the Communists under duress. He was as firm as a rock when Khrushchev staged his psychological offensive at the summit in 1960. He has never budged an inch on Berlin. He gave unhesitating support to President Kennedy during the 1962 Cuban crisis.\n\nHis decision to recognize Communist China is only another example of how clearly he grasps the realities of the cold war. It is becoming fashionable to regard Soviet Russia almost as a potential ally against Red China, but de Gaulle has never been the slave of fashion. He will take a lot of convincing that there has been any fundamental change of outlook in the Kremlin, and in any case he will not fall into the trap of allowingthe Chinese to develop their worldwide campaign along racial as well as ideological lines.\n\nIf he could see any chance of destroying the Communist regime in China through diplomatic ostracism or economic blockade, he might favor these courses. But his knowledge of the Chinese character leaves him in no doubt that the xenophobia which is perhaps stronger in China than in any other country would insure the regime's survival, whatever the sacrifices involved.\n\nEqually, he would favor a war policy in Southeast Asia if the prospect of a conventional victory for the antiCommunist forces were reasonably good. He is the last man to hold any brief for Communist China; if Americans remember Korea, he remembers Dienbienphu. But he reckons that the Chinese would agree tc neutralization—at a price. They want recognition and, above all, they need economic and technical aid, the Russians having withdrawn theirs. De Gaulle is a hard bargainer and he has a shrewd eye for a bargain. His policy toward China is based on the rational calculation that a bargain could now be struck which would save the West (and especially, of course, the United States) a huge and wasteful expenditure of money, effort and lives.\n\nDE GAULLE makes no secret of his resolve to end the American domination of NATO. In this, he has the tacit backing of most Europeans. There is no greater mistake than to suppose that he is an isolated figure, or that France under his leadership is an isolated country. On the contrary, his is the authentic voice of Europe, and if other allied governments speak with a different voice, it is because they are less candid than he is, or because they are less sensitive to public opinion. The Germans, for instance, are very naturally apprehensive that the Americans may decide to “go home” before a credible European deterrent has been evolved. Their foreign policy is, therefore, Janus‐like and can easily be interpreted by shallow or wishful thinkers in London and Washington as hostile to de Gaulle. In fact, the Germans like and admire the French President. He is saying what they dare not say themselves, and doing what they are not allowed to do.\n\nTHE idea of an Atlantic Community appeals to most Europeans in a vague sort of way, but not as a substitute for the more immediately practical aim of European unification. If the Americans had shown any sign of being willing to transfer some of their own sovereignty to an Atlantic superstate, there might have been a corresponding willingness in Europe. But American national pride is now at its zenith, and Europeans may be justified in suspecting that an Atlantic Cornunity, under present conditions, would be yet another facade for American hegemony.\n\nThat a more closely . united and genuinely independent Eu rope would remain on terms of intimate friendship with the United States goes without saying. Neither de Gaulle nor anyone else who is not a Communist or a fellow‐traveler wants a neutral or mugwumpish Europe. But there is a general feeling that American protection cannot and ought not to be relied on indefinitely, and that the American monopoly of ultimate power within the alliance must be broken.\n\n(The doctrine, piously proclaimed from Washington, that nuclear weapons ought to be confined to the United States and the Soviet Union has failed to win the day. It never had much chance of being accepted because [1] Britain already had nuclear weapons, [2] China was determined to have them, and [S] they appear to make the nations which possess them more cautious and responsible rather than more warlike, so that the main argument against “proliferation” falls to the ground.)\n\nTHE Soviet Union is an imperial power without admitting it; the United States is an imperial power without knowing it. The British Empire, in its later phase, evolved a system known as “indirect rule.” (In fact, there was nothing new In this. It was, in essence, the Roman imperial system—as witness the relationship between the Jews and Pontius Pilate.) Since 1945, the United States has perfected the technique of indirect rule. In many countries the American Ambassador is as powerful as Lord Cro mer used to be in Egypt, and it is hardly absurd to suggest that the American President is now more powerful outside his country than inside. De Gaulle is challenging a suzerainty which Americans are perhaps unable to recognize themselves, because they are so thoroughly anti‐imperialist by tradition that they cannot call the power which they now wield in the free world by its proper name. The moment of truth had to come.\n\nTO many Americans de Gaulle seems to embody all that is most objectionable and reactionary in Europe. He is held to be a man who hankers vainly after past glories, an “inward‐looking” Frenchman, a militarist, a dictator. With far less excuse, many people in Britain share these views. They make a picture of the man which is grotesquely false.\n\nWith the sole exception of Bonaparte, de Gaulle is the most sweeping reformer in French history. As a character he is, of course, very different, and the differences are all in his favor. But like Bonaparte he is a ruthless modernizer, impatient with anything inefficient or out‐of‐date. At the same time, he is a traditionalist, ever conscious of the threedimensional quality of the nation which he leads. In his own temperament he unites the two basic traditions of France—that of the Ancien Régimme and that of the Revolution. He is part Jesuit, part Jacobin. Herein lies his special strength: he is in a very real sense the most representative, as well as the most illustrious, of Frenchmen.\n\nSince he returned to power in 1958 he has given independence to most of what was previously the French Empire, and his supreme achievement has been the liquidation of the Algerian problem. The French Community now compares very favorably with other post‐colonial experiments. It has a political and cultural solidarity which the British Commonwealth unfortunately lacks. The volume of French aid to developing countries wins praise from anybody who bothers to look at the facts—General Clay, for instance.\n\nIn their dealings with African and Asian peoples, the French have the big advantage that they are relatively free from racialism. They conceive of France as a culture rather than as a race, and they act as missionaries of that culture. De Gaulle has very close links with what is now the French Community, and he is never likely to forget that it was a black Frenchman—Governor Eboué of the Chad Territory—who first rallied to his standard in 1940, whei metropolitan Frenchmen were condemning him to death.\n\nIt is misleading to depict him as the soldier in politics. He was, indeed, a first‐rate soldier and an outstanding military thinker. He also once wrote to Clement Attlee that politics was too serious a matter to be left to politicians.\n\nYET his own career has been more political than military, beginning with an act of mutiny and culminating in his struggle to protect the French State from a military coup at the hands of other, less intelligent and enlightened mutineers. Paradoxically, he emphasizes his civilian status even when he dons his military uniform, because it is still the uniform of a brigadier general; in other words, his career as a soldier ended in 1940.\n\nA dictator? He is a man born to give orders and he does not believe in collective leadership. But he has a democratic conscience and a reverence for the rule of law which have prevented him from becoming a despot. The Fifth Republic which he has created is open to criticism on several counts, but it has given the French, who are a naturally anarchic people, a stability of government which they did not enjoy under the Fourth Republic or during the last decades of the Third. It has also given them an unprecedented share in major policy decisions, and the power in future to choose their Chief Executive by direct election.\n\nIt is curious to reflect that the French people were allowed to decide the issue in Algeria through a plebiscite, whereas the British people had no opportunity to vote explicitly on the granting of independence to India. De Gaulle's probable opponent in the next Presidential election, Gaston Defferre, has accepted the Constitution and announced his intention to be a “Gaullist of the Left ” This is surely a most striking conpliment to the Gaullist system of government."
