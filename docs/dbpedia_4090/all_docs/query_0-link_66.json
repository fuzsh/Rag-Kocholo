        "text": "Don Cook (1920â€“1995) was one of the longest-serving American foreign correspondents to cover Europe during the last century. His career began in 1943, as the tide turned in World War II, and ended as the Berlin Wall came down. Across four decades, Cook covered most major events in Europe, writing for the New York Herald Tribune for twenty-one years, and then the Los Angeles Times for twenty-three years more. In that span, he wrote several history books and contributed to publications including the Saturday Evening Post. Cook passed away in Philadelphia in 1995."
