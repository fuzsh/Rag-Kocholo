        "text": "Apologies for the huge day, but it was a huge day! Dinant was a fantastic city to visit!\n\nGood thing I gave up and went to bed, as Peter didn’t get back until 12:30am! I got up at 7:15, and he reluctantly rolled out of bed just before I left. Good thing the race is a bit earlier today, so hopefully they can get back more easily/earlier on day 2. I headed off at 8 to get an 8:22 train to Dinant. This was a fairly random, last-minute addition to my itinerary, replacing a potential hike day, but a girl from bookclub recommended it and once I started looking, there was so much to do there that it just seemed obvious. The train was just under an hour and a half, and was very scenic, winding along a river between forested hills for the last half hour. We arrived at 9:45 and I quickly headed towards the river to go to the Citadel.\n\nTurning a corner, the view of the mountain with the citadel on top and church in front was pretty breathtaking! It was sunny at that moment in time as well, so I quickly took some photos. The Charles de Gaulle Bridge (complete with a statue of the man himself, who fought there during World War I) had an added layer of quirkiness by being lined with giant statues of saxophones. The inventor of the saxophone was born here, and they certainly honoured his memory throughout the town. There were also flags of world nations hung along the bridge, although the reason for that was unclear – it was definitely a busy bridge aesthetically though!\n\nCrossing the bridge, I passed the church, which seemed to be closed for Sunday morning, and bought my tickets for the citadel. This included a ride in the cable car (built in the 60s), but I opted for the stairs instead – had to justify wearing my hiking boots today! There were 408 very steep, often quite slippy, steps leading up to the citadel. It actually didn’t take too long to climb them though, because of how steep it was. I huffed and puffed my way up, stopping sporadically both to catch my breath and also take in the view, as it was stunning! The sheer cliff face made the drop-off to the buildings below even more stark. Finally, I reached a little door in the cliff-face and entered (and climbed one more wooden flight of stairs) to find myself in the courtyard of the citadel.\n\nAfter a bit of searching for the start of the self-guided tour (I couldn’t initially find 1 and 2), I found my way into an exhibition about the use of the fort during world war 1. Apparently Dinant was a fairly crucial mid-way point in neutral Belgium between France and the occupied Netherlands, which led to a fairly horrific battle in which most of the town was destroyed or burnt down and there were civilian massacres by the Germans (after they were abandoned by the French). The exhibition was detailed and well organised, and gave all the information in an impressive four languages! Once I’d reached the end, I followed the arrows back through the outer walls to the entrance hallway, and from there to the numbers around the courtyard that laid out earlier history, and then some canons and armaments aiming out of walls. There has been a castle on the site since the 14thcentury, which has been destroyed and rebuilt a number of times, ultimately ending in quite a blunt ‘fort’-style citadel instead of an ornate castle. Number 5 led out onto a viewpoint that hung over the edge of the cliff face, and the information placard showed how it had historically been used as a water source during sieges, where barrels were lowered into a spring/well and then raised back up on a pulley system to provide water for the soldiers in the castle. The views from the spot weren’t bad either!\n\nThe tour then led us back into the casemates of the castle, where they had set up models of a kitchen, bakery, dormitories for the soldiers, and then some further historical information about the bronze guilds that were formed early in the town’s history. Then there was a weird jump in the history narrative where I was back in World War I, walking into a convincing reconstruction of the trenches, complete with sound effects and all. I rounded a corner and found myself at the top of a set of stairs – with a sign warning off visitors with inner ear issues, poor imbalance and pregnancy. I quickly realised why, when halfway down the stairs everything went on a tilt. Reaching the bottom of the stairs, there was an entire ‘shelter’ that had ‘collapsed’ – with the floor and stairs at a 45 degree angle! It was amazing how bizarre this felt, with your brain telling you that you were falling over the whole way around. There was an older couple behind me with a dog that was absolutely not having a bit of it. He just put the brakes on at the bottom of the stairs and after a bit of attempted coaxing, they had to just pick him up and carry him! It was hard to capture in photos, but you can kind of tell if you look at the angle of the water versus the angle of the floor.\n\nFrom the collapsed shelter, the numbers led you through a basic museum about the restoration and expansion of the fort over time, and then through the dungeons, including a room with a full guillotine. The exit of the tour was the exit that led you back to the cable car, but after having a look at the view, I headed back inside and down through the sneaky staircase I’d come up. There were a couple of people coming up the stairs, but when I reached the bottom, there was a huge line for the cable car, so I could tell which the more popular option was!\n\nI could hear singing in the church as I walked past, so services were clearly still happening, so I crossed back over the bridge and headed towards Maison Leffe. This museum exhibit is set up in a fairly fancy hotel – not sure what the connection is to Leffe, perhaps it’s owned by the corporation that own Leffe now? Nevertheless, it was great value and full of loads of information. Your ticket had a QR code on it, and you scanned that (which had your language coded into it) and a video started playing with information about a select Leffe beer and a section of Leffe’s history at each little spot. For how small the actual space was, I was shocked by how much time I spent there, because of the videos taking the time that they take. It was interesting though, and I learned quite a bit about the abbey’s history (which I was planning to visit later). At the end of the museum exhibit (after I got 10/10 on the quiz!), I followed the signs out to the terrace, where I handed over my ticket and was given a full pour of a beer and a full-sized glass! I’d expected the ‘gift’ mentioned on the ticket to be a discount or a keychain or something! I’m no Peter-level glass collector, but actually that is quite cool – and we don’t have many (any?) Belgian style glasses, so perfect. I ordered some cheese for a snack along with my beer and sat on the terrace with an incredible view over the river and town.\n\nOnce I’d finished my food, I headed off up the road towards the ‘Grotte de Dinant’ – a cave complex a little way out of town. I bought my ticket and had quite a strange conversation with the woman on the till – which I later realised was because she thought I said I was from Israel… how does Australia sound like Israel?? Back outside, I was given a “5-10 minute” (definitely 2 minutes) overview by a guy in a yellow t-shirt (was it supposed to look like a hi-vis? Not sure) who then directed me up the path with a pointed look at his tip tin. He definitely didn’t deserve a tip, but I also didn’t have cash, so didn’t feel too bad about that. After New York, I’m glad tipping culture is not a thing here! I found my way up the path to the entrance to the caves and then followed the path and stairs inside. I think our amazing experience of the caves in New Zealand maybe spoiled us though, because I felt very critical of the cement flooring, massive amounts of lighting and lack of guides throughout the cave. It was only 1km of caves, and the flat cement floors meant that I walked around it without realising how quick it was. I spotted a couple of the things that the yellow T-shirt guy had mentioned, but not all of them. It mainly felt like an overly-commercialised cave where most of the beautiful formations had probably been destroyed over time (unless it was too recent for them to have formed in the first place?) – there were very few full stalacmites, just blunt lumps to the sides of the path. There were some lovely curtain formations from the ceiling though, and some cool ‘waterfall’-type formations. I found myself at the bottom of the stairs leading back to the surface within 15 minutes or so, so trudged back up and headed back into town. Here I’d been worrying about whether an hour was long enough!\n\nI took my time walking through town, stopping to check out a few more of the saxophones around the place, and the official monument to Adolphe Sax. It alternated between being lovely and sunny and then raining again, so I was glad I’d brought clothes to cover all options. There was a weir with some sort of electric dam in the river, so I checked that out – it had lovely views over both sides of the town. Eventually I arrived at the Abbey of Leffe (Leffe is actually the part of town where the abbey is), where over half an hour a growing crowd gathered outside the gate. The sign on the door informed us that tours were held at ‘3pm sharp’ on Saturdays and Sundays, but 3pm came with the bells above us tolling and the doors didn’t open. Eventually a guy rang the doorbell and someone explained something in French that made the whole crowd groan. When people started walking off, I chased the guy who’d got the explanation and asked what happened, and he said that because of the local jazz festival, there was no visit today. Annoying!\n\nI walked back into town again, this time enjoying some nice sunshine and views of the river in the sun on the way. I stopped in at the museum of Adolphe Sax, which is apparently set up in the house where he was born. It was tiny, but had some information/commentary about his life. At this point, I was reaching my limit in terms of feeling very tired, but also having ticked off all of the ‘to do’ items that I could find for the town. After checking a few online blogs, I decided I had done what I’d come to do and headed back to the station. After a short wait, my train pulled out and I alternated napping and reading for the trip back to Brussels.\n\nMy phone and my portable battery were both dead by the time I got back to Brussels, so I headed back to the hotel to charge both them and myself for a little while. Peter and Vicky were once again having issues getting out of Spa, but were having better luck than yesterday, at least being on a shuttle bus by the time I got back. I was supposed to meet them in town at 9, so at 6:45ish I headed back into the city centre and grabbed some Belgian fries for dinner. Not the most healthy meal, but when in Brussels! I then did my own little walking tour spotting the bafflingly famous silly statues (weeing dog, weeing baby) and cute comic-book-style street art around the city centre. I ended my tour at a lambic bar, where I grabbed a lambic and settled in to update this! Peter and Vicky ran into some more delays (ie too many people at the train station so they couldn’t get on the train) so are now due in at 10, but I’m going to go and scope out some food options for them soon and grab us a table at BrewDog, next to the station."
