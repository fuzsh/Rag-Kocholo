        "text": "In 1914, Dinant was inhabited by 7,000 people and held significant strategic importance as a crossing point on the Meuse River. Situated within a south–north gorge, the town served as a pivotal junction where three roads and a path converged from the east. These routes traversed an escarpment and descended into the town, presenting a vulnerable point for potential attacks from the east.\n\nPerched atop the wooded ridge on the east bank stood the Citadel of Dinant, a stone fortress dating back to the Napoleonic era. From this vantage point, the citadel overlooked both the town and the Meuse bridge, which lay 100 meters below.\n\nIn 1914, Dinant comprised a ribbon of streets approximately 4 kilometers in length on the east bank, spanning a width of a few hundred meters. Prior to the battle, the Mayor of Dinant implored the population to refrain from engaging in combat and prohibited demonstrations in support of the Allies.\n\n6–14 August.\n\nThe German invasion of France commenced with the Occupation of Luxembourg and the invasion of Belgium on 4 August. German forces, including infantry brigades, cavalry divisions, and Jäger battalions, crossed into Belgium, with orders to advance towards Dinant. By 10 August, German divisions had entered Dinant, situated on the east bank of the Meuse River, near the French border.\n\n15 August.\n\nTroops from the German 3rd and 4th Cavalry divisions, along with Jäger battalions and field artillery, launched an attempt to seize Dinant by surprise. The French I Corps defended the west bank of the Meuse, while the 2nd Division guarded Dinant with infantry regiments and machine-gun sections stationed in the town and citadel. Despite French resistance, German forces managed to breach the citadel, forcing the French to retreat across the river.\n\nIn a fierce counter-attack, French infantry regiments drove the Germans back across the Meuse, reclaiming the citadel by late afternoon. The French Cavalry Corps attempted to flank the German position on the east bank but faced resistance from German infantry. By the end of the day, the French had suffered significant casualties but maintained control of the bridge and nearby houses on the west bank.\n\n16–21 August.\n\nFollowing the battle, the French fortified their positions on the west bank of the Meuse, blocking the bridge and barricading streets near the river. Skirmishes ensued between German forces on the east bank and French patrols. German detachments, using motor vehicles armed with machine guns, attacked nearby villages, resulting in civilian casualties and destruction.\n\nAs German infantry divisions closed in on Dinant, preparations were made for a frontal assault ordered by the German Chief of the General Staff. Artillery bombardment commenced, and barges and pontoon bridges were gathered in anticipation of French attempts to destroy the Meuse bridges.\n\nNight Raid, 21,22 August.\n\nOn the night of 21/22 August, a German raiding party launched an attack on Dinant. German infantry and pioneers advanced from Ciney into Dinant, resulting in the death of seven civilians and the burning of 15 to 20 houses. Confusion arose as civilians and soldiers clashed, with some Germans claiming they were ordered to eradicate a portion of the left bank of the Meuse River. The situation escalated when the raiding party threw a grenade into a café, prompting gunfire that resulted in numerous casualties.\n\nMassacres, 23 August.\n\nIn the early hours of 23 August, amidst heavy fog, German artillery bombarded Dinant. The German 32nd Division and the 23rd Reserve Division crossed the Meuse River and advanced into Dinant. Facing resistance from French and Belgian forces, German troops conducted a brutal crackdown on the town’s inhabitants. Civilians were targeted, with reports of indiscriminate killings and the use of civilians as human shields. Houses were set ablaze, and civilians were rounded up and executed. The massacre resulted in hundreds of civilian casualties, with atrocities committed on both sides of the river.\n\nThe German offensive continued, with attacks on nearby villages and further clashes with French forces. Despite French attempts to repeal the German advance, the situation remained dire for the residents of Dinant. Reinforcements were called in, and the French I Corps eventually contained the German forces in bridgeheads on the west bank of the Meuse River.\n\nThe events in Dinant represented a tragic chapter in the early stages of World War I, marked by civilian suffering and brutal reprisals.\n\n24 August.\n\nFollowing the battle, on 24 August, the Germans systematically burned down the area of Dinant south of the bridge, which had not been attacked on 23 August. The town was subjected to widespread looting, and public and historic buildings, including the collegiate church and the town hall, were destroyed. In nearby villages such as Bouvignes, Hastière-par-delà, and Hastière-Lavaux, civilians were caught in the crossfire between German and French forces, resulting in numerous casualties and extensive destruction. By 24 August, when the German advance resumed, the French had withdrawn from the area.\n\nCasualties and Commemoration:"
