        "text": "Imagine yourself as Tom Thumb in the land of Mr Sax…\n\nImagine yourself rediscovering our European neighbours …\n\nImagine yourself on a journey – just by making your way through Dinant…\n\nIn the context of \"l'Europ'A. Sax\", which took place in Dinant in November 2010 as a tribute to Adolphe Sax, the International Adolphe Sax Association (IASA) and the Maison du Tourisme de la Haute-Meuse (MdT) wished to create in the city a reminder of Mr Sax and his brilliant invention.\n\nWith the assistance of the EU-funded Walloon Rural Development Programme and with the support of the Walloon Region's Commissariat Général au Tourisme, the IASA and the MdT had 28 giant saxophones – more than three metres high – made to reflect the countries of the European Union.\n\nFor their decoration, a major international Internet-based graphic design competition was held.\n\nThe brief was to create original, creative designs, free of clichés, on the theme of European countries and Europe itself.\n\nThe result was 28 original artistic works in which music meets graphic art.\n\nWe invite you to explore this exhibition with a difference on a journey through the European imagination, from the Maison du Tourisme (Tourist Information Centre) to the Maison de Monsieur Sax (Mr Sax's house), crossing the bridge on the way.\n\nWhy not complete your tour of the city by exploring it on a fun walk that will take you from the Anamorphoses Trail (Parcours des Anamorphoses) to the European saxophones via the Maison de la Pataphonie?\n\nMEANINGS :\n\nADOLPHE SAX\n\nGénie inventif\n\n(House of Mister Sax)\n\nEvocation of the genius of Adolphe Sax and some of his inventions. Under the bell is the official seal of Adolphe Sax as it appears on his patents.\n\nAUSTRIA\n\nKristallwelten\n\n(Charles de Gaulle Bridge)\n\nIt is an evocation of the \"Swarovski Crystal Worlds\", a veritable universe dedicated to crystal in all its facets. A huge green face guards the entrance to this magical world. From his mouth, a waterfall gushes forth. The swirls thus created generate bubbles, a nod to the Austrian firm \"Red Bull\".\n\nBELGIUM\n\nCompromis\n\n(Charles de Gaulle Bridge)\n\nA superimposition of inverted saxophones invades the bottom of the instrument. The colours used are those of the Belgian flag, with the Walloon rooster and the Flemish lion. At the bottom, the onomatopoeia \"blabla\" evokes the incessant talks and compromises as the Belgian way. At the centre of everything, the Brussels logo is superimposed.\n\nBELGIUM (Comics)\n\nBeDelirium\n\n(On loan)\n\nBelgium, country of the comic strip. Some world-famous authors: Hergé, Peyo, Morris, Franquin... Do you recognize all the Belgian monuments and cities reffered?\n\nBULGARIA\n\nTopalov\n\n(Tourist Office)\n\nAllusion to Veselin Topalov, player and chess grandmaster. Hence the black and white colours (of the chessboard).\n\nCHINA\n\nThe Red Dragon\n\n(Charles de Gaulle Bridge)\n\nThe yellow stars on a red background evoke the national flag. At the bottom of the saxophone, the Great Wall and a panda are painted.\n\nCROATIA\n\nŠahovnica\n\n(Charles de Gaulle Bridge)\n\nThe red and white checkerboard is reminiscent of the country's flag. The superimposition of a blue tie refers to the Croatian mercenaries (used by Louis XIII and Louis XIV) who wore a scarf around their necks, which also gave the word \"cravate\" in French.\n\nCZECH REPUBLIC\n\nPrazske Jaro\n\n(Saint-Nicolas Square)\n\nThis is an evocation of the Prague Spring (1968) repressed by the USSR, which sent tanks into the Czech capital. Two of them are visible in black and white on the saxophone.\n\nDENMARK\n\nDen Lille Havfrue\n\n(Lion Square)\n\nEvocation of the scaled tail of \"The Little Mermaid\", a tale by the Danish writer Hans Christian Andersen.\n\nDINANT\n\nDinant, Fille de Meuse\n\n(City Hall - Entrance)\n\nEvocation of the city buildings with, notably recognizable, the bulbous bell tower of the Collegiate Church. The dominant colours are a mixture between the \"blue\" of the Meuse and the green of the green setting in which Dinant is situated.\n\nESTONIA\n\nRussian Keyhole\n\n(On loan)\n\nAlways considered the western gateway to the Russian Empire, Estonia can be compared to a keyhole. The three colours chosen are reminiscent of the national flag.\n\nEUROPE\n\nLe saxo noir\n\n(Citadel)\n\nThierry Noir, famous for being the first artist to graffiti the Berlin Wall in 1984, was immediately approached to paint the European saxophone. One will easily recognize his deliberately minimalist technique and his brushstrokes with bright colours. Its “cartoon style” is reflected in the colourful faces with big purple lips.\n\nFINLAND\n\nAqua = Vita\n\n(Dinant Station)\n\nSalmiakki Koskenkorva is a popular Finnish alcoholic drink, a blend of vodka and a composition based on glucose syrup and liquorice extract that gives this saxophone its black colour. Aquavit takes its name from the Latin \"aqua vitae\" which means \"eau-de vie\" (“brandy”) in French.\n\nFRANCE\n\nSexy France, La Lala lala lala,\n\n(Charles de Gaulle Bridge)\n\nIt is a leg dressed with a fishnet stocking and a suspender belt evoking the French-Cancan. The bottom of the saxophone represents the thigh and the mouthpiece symbolizes the foot.\n\nGERMANY\n\nSchlagermeister\n\n(Charles de Gaulle Bridge)\n\n\"Football is a simple sport: twenty-two men chase a ball for 90 minutes and at the end, the Germans always win\", said English footballer Gary Lineker, who noted that competitions were often won by the Mannschaft, the German national team.\n\nGREECE\n\nDêmos\n\n(On loan)\n\nCountries where democracy and freedom of speech were born. Hence the different mouths that speak out.\n\nHUNGARY\n\nRubik\n\n(On loan)\n\nThe coloured squares are reminiscent of the famous Rubik's Cube from the 80s, invented by the Hungarian Ernö Rubik.\n\nIRELAND\n\nGood Luck, Irland\n\n(Cultural Centre)\n\nSaint Patrick, evangelizer of Ireland in the 5th century, is said to have explained the mystery of the Holy Trinity with the help of a clover. Since then, the shamrock has been the symbol of this country. If you look closely at the saxophone, you may be lucky enough to find one to four leaves.\n\nITALY\n\nIl Cavaliere\n\n(Charles de Gaulle Bridge)\n\nThe colours of this saxophone evoke a famous brand of Italian cars.\n\nLATVIA\n\nLike a Bird\n\n(On loan)\n\nAn allusion to the country's national bird, the nodding wagtail represented on the saxophone pavilion. The colours are not those of the flag but of the coat of arms of Latvia.\n\nLITHUANIA\n\nDunk\n\n(Charles de Gaulle Bridge)\n\nThis is a basketball reinterpreted in the form of a saxophone. Basketball is the national sport in Lithuania, the best European nation in this sport and a medal winner at every last Olympic Games. The word \"dunk\" on the saxophone refers to a two-handed basketball smash.\n\nLUXEMBOURG\n\nDeluxe\n\n(Casino of Dinant)\n\nSmall country, but very prosperous. It is likened here to a horn of plenty from which euros flow.\n\nMALTA\n\nMelitta\n\n(Tourist Office)\n\nIn ancient times, the island was famous for its honey (\"Meli\" in Greek and \"Melitta\" bee) which was exported throughout the Mediterranean basin. Some people claim that the honey also reminds one of the ochre colour of the island's cliffs...\n\nNETHERLANDS\n\nWhere are the golden tulips?\n\n(Patenier Square)\n\nDuring the 16th century, the tulip, which originated in the East, was introduced to the Netherlands and immediately met with a flourishing success, with production never ceasing to grow. The black colour of the saxophone refers to the Dutch ambition to create a black tulip.\n\nPOLAND\n\nWycinanki\n\n(Charles de Gaulle Bridge)\n\nRepresentation of Polish wycinanki, a decorative craft made from monochrome and multicoloured paper cut-outs. Typical symbols of the country are inserted: the Warsaw Mermaid, Chopin, storks, bears, vodka, a lajkonik, pierogi, the Polish armoury, bison, icons and Orthodox churches. In the upper part, the blue refers to the Baltic Sea and the Masurian lakes. At the bottom are the Tatras, the famous Polish mountains and decorative forms of Art Nouveau style.\n\nPORTUGAL\n\nTordesillas\n\n(Charles de Gaulle Bridge)\n\nOld world map showing the vertical demarcation established by the Treaty of Tordesillas (7 June 1494) which defined the membership of the colonies. On the west of this line: the Spanish territories. To the East, the Portuguese properties (Brazil, Azores, Cape Verde).\n\nROMANIA\n\nVlad\n\n(Patenier Square)\n\nIt is an allusion to Count Dracula, a bloodthirsty vampire whose novel was inspired by Vlad III the Impaler, Prince of Wallachia, southern province of Romania.\n\nSELMER HENRI\n\nSuprême\n\n(House of Mister Sax)\n\nThe renowned multi-award-winning manufacturer of instruments, Henri Selmer (1858–1941), based in Paris, originally sold mouthpieces, reeds, and clarinets. In 1922, he designed his first saxophone and in 1929 he took over the workshops run by Adolphe-Edouard, Adolphe Sax’s son. Henri Selmer thus became the worthy successor of the inventor of the saxophone. This new giant saxophone is inspired by the \"Supreme\" saxophone, the new generation of saxophones from the SELMER company. + info"
