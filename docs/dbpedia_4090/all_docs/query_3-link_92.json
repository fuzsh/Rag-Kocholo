        "text": "2. 1965 - May 1968\n\nIn early 1965, the French began to aggressively convert dollars into gold (The New York Times, January 5, 1965). On January 12, 1965, during a luncheon address to the Franco-Japanese Press Association, Giscard d’Estaing defended the dollar for gold conversions. He claimed that doing nothing would bring on a crisis faster and that it was now necessary for all those responsible for the world monetary system to act jointly to reform the monetary system. Setting the stage for de Gaulle, he boldly advocated a return to the original system created at Bretton Woods (The New York Times, January 13, 1965).\n\nOn February 4, 1965, during a press conference at the Elysée Palace, de Gaulle stirred up an international controversy by mentioning the possibility of reestablishing the gold standard. He acknowledged that the gold-dollar standard had been appropriate for the years immediately following World War II because all the gold reserves were held by the U.S. But, conditions had changed. European economies had been revived and the gold reserves of the Common Market countries equalled those of the U.S.. The use of the dollar as an international medium of exchange was now serving to cloud the fact that the system provided substantial seignorage to the U.S.. He recommended that the international monetary system be changed and mentioned the reinstitution of the gold standard as a possibility, given consultation among all the main financial powers within the existing forums, including the IMF “……once it was no longer a matter of perpetuating the gold exchange standard, but of replacing it” 12/. Although such a leading authority as Triffin (1965) disputes it 13/, de Gaulle was then widely perceived as having publicly adopted Rueff’s views for the first time and of disavowing the Finance Ministry’s CRU proposal.\n\nFollowing the President, Giscard d’Estaing gave a speech at the University of Paris Law School on February 11. In the speech he elaborated on the French objections to the existing international monetary system: the asymmetry of the balance of payments adjustment mechanism between reserve currency countries and other deficit countries; its fragility because of the potential of a run on U.S. gold reserves; and its inflationary bias (DeVries, 1976, Vol I, p. 62). The French position on gold was put forward by the Minister of Finance’s call to the world’s leading financial powers to sign a solemn declaration pledging themselves to settle their international debts only in gold. However, Giscard d’Estaing’s speech cannot be interpreted as strictly a stand in favor of the gold standard, because a large portion of his exposé focused on what the Bretton Woods accords initially meant for the International Monetary System and how it had evolved away from its initial intentions 14/.\n\nOne can surmise that French officials mentioned a return to the gold standard or an increase in the price of gold as a form of threat to the U.S. with the apparent aim of furthering international negotiations to reform the international monetary system. Indeed, while Jacques Rueff made it clear that he was not speaking for the French government, he recommended on April 15, 1965 that the dollar price of gold be doubled. This statement was widely reported in the American press (The New York Times and The Journal of Commerce, April 16, 1965), only to be followed in May by Giscard saying on a French television program that France had never taken a position on the question of a rise in the price of gold (The New York Times, May 16, 1965).\n\nDuring a lecture delivered by Valéry Giscard d’Estaing at the Institut d’Etudes Bancaires et Financières on June 15, the French proposals for the CRU were detailed and explicitly linked to guidelines established at the Genoa conference of 1922. 15/ Under the French Plan, each member of the G-10 would subscribe to the CRU account in proportion to their gold holdings; gold and CRU’s would then circulate together in fixed proportions (Williamson, 1977, p. 20 and Solomon, 1982, p. 76). From the French perspective, this system would have constituted an improvement over the gold dollar standard by conferring on the G-10 countries, rather than just the U.S., the power of reserve currency creation.\n\nAlthough the Ministers and Central Bank Governors of the Group of Ten agreed at the annual meeting of the IMF in September 1965 to draw up a contingency plan for reserve creation, much of the second semester of 1965 was marred by disagreements between the U.S. and France. They sparred over how closely the proposed new reserve units should be tied to gold and how the power of reserve creation should be divided between the different countries. The clash between the French and American views was highlighted in the Ossola Report, published on August 11 by the group of Ten (The Financial Times, August 11, 1965). The Report considered the merits of alternative proposals for increasing world liquidity: the creation of reserve units by a group of countries (including various CRU schemes); proposals to create reserve accounts through the IMF; and schemes to provide holders of currency with an alternative asset (Devries, Vol. 1, 1976, p. 60). 16/ At the end of a year when the French proposal for international monetary reform was criticized by the reserve currency countries, the percentage of gold in French official reserves had climbed to 86 percent (The New York Times, April 20, 1966) (See Figure 4). Furthermore, Michael Debré replaced Valéry Giscard d’Estaing as Minister of Finance, a move that was perceived at the time as a strengthening of the orthodox Gaullist line in the French government.\n\nThe entire year 1966 witnessed a theater of confrontation between the U.S. and the French government over their respective visions for international monetary reform. Various representatives of the French government publicly discussed the possibility of returning to a gold standard and of increasing the official price of gold. In our view, this was a bargaining threat to induce the American government to approve of a closer link between the new reserve asset (to be called the Special Drawing Right (SDR)) and gold and a sharing of power (in the forums dedicated to the revision of the international monetary system) between the Common Market countries and the United States.\n\nThe payoffs to the French strategy in 1966 were twofold, if small. First, at a meeting at the Hague on July 26, the Finance Ministers of the G-10 countries partially espoused a view stated earlier by the French and the other EEC countries by recommending that “there should be a better balance of payments equilibrium between members” before any monetary reform could take place, 17/ and by indicating that decisions to create new monetary units should be made on the basis of approval between the deputies of the G-10 and the executive directors of the IMF (thus conferring a stronger voice to Europe than if the reform was left to the IMF alone) (The Washington Post, July 27, 1966). Secondly, a gentleman’s agreement was reported to have taken place in December between Michel Debré, U.S. Treasury Secretary Fowler and British chancellor of the exchequer Callaghan. The terms of the agreement were that the U.S. would agree to let any new “liquidity unit devised by the IMF” be linked to gold if in return France would make it clear that she would not favor an increase in the world price of gold (The Financial Times, December 31, 1966). 18/\n\nAt a meeting of the Deputies of the G-10 in Paris, at the end of January 1966, Frederick Deming, the U.S. Under Secretary of the Treasury, suggested a currency reserve unit not linked to gold as a possible way to increase world liquidity (The Journal of Commerce, February 1, 1966). 19/ The American plan also offered to increase the drawing rights of member nations in the IMF (The Journal of Commerce, February 1, 1966). The main players in the French government then decided to adopt a hard bargaining line by publicly considering a return to the gold standard and temporarily dropping their support for the CRU 20/.\n\nFor nearly nine months France opposed new discussions on international monetary reform, merely putting itself in an isolated position. On September 12 after a meeting of the Common Market Finance Ministers France indicated that it would agree to study alternatives to increasing international liquidity, while maintaining its opposition to an increase, until the U.S. had achieved payments balance. (The New York Times, September 13, 1966).\n\nMichel Debré’s conciliatory position was maintained throughout the annual IMF meetings, which started on September 27 in Washington, and contrasted with the French government’s posturing in the first semester on gold. In a speech during the meetings, Debré took the same line of criticism of the dollar exchange standard as his predecessor Giscard d’Estaing 21/. During these meetings, Debré tacitly accepted U.S. Treasury Secretary Fowler’s timetable for approval of a contingency plan for the creation of a new international reserve instrument at the next annual IMF meeting. “By the end of next year, Mr. Debré predicted, a plan for deliberate creation of some form of reserves to supplement gold, US dollars and pounds will be undergoing ratification in the Free World’s parliaments.” (The Wall Street Journal, September 30, 1966). Furthermore, he distanced himself from the Rueff thesis when he told journalists during a press conference that under no circumstances did he favor an increase in the price of gold (The Wall Street Journal, September 30, 1966). This conciliatory position was matched by a hiatus, during the months of October and November, in the French government’s practice of converting its dollar holdings into gold (The New York Times, December 3, 1966).\n\nOn November 29 in Washington at the first Joint meeting of the Deputies of the Group of Ten and the 20 Executive Directors of the IMF on reserve creation, the negotiators agreed to the French demands of adding the issue of gold to their agenda. This occurred shortly after the French government leaked to the press a report on the role of gold in the international monetary system by Maurice Pérousse, director of the French Treasury and chief delegate at the monetary talks (The Washington Post, November 30, 1966). The most provocative aspect of this report was that it considered the possibility of a gold price increase and urged that “increased quotas by member countries to the IMF should be paid in gold in accordance with the fund’s statutes.” (The New York Times, November 30, 1966) Aside from these issues, the report reflected the general perspective of the French government 22/. At first, the Ministry of Finance’s spokesman said that the report represented the opinion of the French government and then issued a denial that France actually favored a higher gold price. By first leaking the report and then issuing ambiguous comments on it, Paris had “clearly succeeded in putting loose a well-conceived cat among the pigeons” (Nossiter, November 30, 1966).\n\nFrom the beginning of 1967 until May 1968, French international monetary policy followed essentially the same guidelines that it had followed since proposing the CRU in 1964. It also made the same strategic use of gold as it had in 1965. The French persisted in demanding that the U.S. share its veto power over the creation of new liquidity with Europe and in advocating the creation of an international currency reserve unit that would be tied in some proportions to gold. Whenever their demands were not given due consideration by the United States, representatives of the French government resorted to advocating either an increase in the price of gold or the return to the gold standard as a monetary regime.\n\nThe world economy became more turbulent in the period January 1967-May 1968. Growing world gold scarcity and a rise in U.S. inflation undermined the dollar’s relationship to gold and bred speculation on the gold market (Bordo, 1993). Following the devaluation of the pound in November 1967, the dollar began to weaken. Within this context, the lack of agreement between the French and the Americans encouraged the French to discuss the role of gold in the international monetary system more frequently. This may have contributed even further to the speculative attacks against the dollar. Although the French may have thought that the weakened position of the reserve currency countries benefitted them, their strategy backfired because of the breakdown of the Gold Pool and the creation of the two-tier gold pricing system. The gold dollar standard was defacto terminated ending the leverage conferred by dollar to gold conversions. Thus, this period merits close scrutiny.\n\nOn January 9, 1967, a weekend statement by Michel Debré caused a fever of gold speculation in France 23/. Le Monde published Debre’s declaration that France was still pressing for an international examination of the official fixed price of gold (The New York Times, January 10, 1967). Pressure on the gold markets put the U.S. on the defensive. 24/ On January 13, in a speech to La Chambre de Commerce Française au Canada in Montreal, Debré restated France’s position on revising the International Monetary System. His position was identical to the position adopted earlier by Valéry Giscard d’Estaing when he was the Minister of Finance 25/, except for the fact that Debré maintained the possibility of revising the price of gold. This position was consistent with the French strategy of using gold as a “bargaining chip” to obtain a more important voice for Europe in the revision of the international monetary system 26/.\n\nFrance’s stance became more conciliatory, both as a result of the “gentleman’s agreement” concluded at the end of the previous year and of the lack of support from other Common Market countries on increasing the price of gold. On January 17, 1967, during the two day meeting in the Hague of the E.E.C.’s Finance ministers, Debré abandoned his demands for a reexamination of the price of gold at the following week’s joint meeting between the Executive Directors of the IMF and the Deputies of the G-10 countries (The Wall Street Journal, January 18, 1967). He proposed instead that the Common Market countries’ voting powers in the IMF be increased to a level comparable with that of the U.S. 27/ However, no progress was made at the joint meeting on January 27, 1967 between the Executive Directors of the IMF and the Deputies of the G-10 in London.\n\nAs presented in figure 5, the gold component of U.S. reserves had been constantly falling since 1957. Their level was so low in 1967 that, in March, they provoked American officials to urge major dollar holding nations to consider the dwindling stock at Fort Knox as generally “off limits” and not to ask to buy gold except in the case of unavoidable need, despite the U.S. pledge to pay out gold at $35.00 per ounce (Janssen, The Wall Street Journal, March 20, 1967). During this period, the French attitude became more conciliatory towards the United States, 28/ as France was reported to have made advance repayments on its debt to the U.S. and to have refrained from purchasing U.S. gold for a few months (The Wall Street Journal, March 20, 1967).\n\nThis perceived weakened position of the United States to ensure the full convertibility of dollars for gold did not bring it closer to an agreement on new reserve assets with the French or for that matter the other Common Market countries. Both a joint IMF/G-10 meeting in Washington on April 26 and a G-10 meeting in Paris on May 20 ended in a deadlock 29/. This lack of progress on the international monetary scene led the French government to harden once more its position on the creation of new liquidity. On May 24, 1967, René Larre, financial counsellor to the French embassy in Washington and executive director of the IMF, declared that the apparent unwillingness of the U.S. to curb its chronic balance of payment deficit presented a formidable obstacle to the agreement on the creation of a new reserve asset (The Journal of Commerce, May 25, 1967). During June 1967, France quietly decided to make no further contributions to the eight nations gold pool, through which the price of gold was stabilized at $35.00 per ounce. 30/ The United States then had to increase its contribution to the gold pool by the same amount, an additional 9 percent, formerly contributed by France (Vicker, November 28, 1967).\n\nThe closest the United States and France ever came to an agreement on international monetary reform was on August 27, 1967 at the conclusion of a G-10 meeting in London. Representatives of both the United States and France declared their satisfaction with the new monetary reform formula to be presented for the approval of the Governors of the IMF at the 1967 annual meetings in Rio. The main points of the new proposition were twofold. First, a Special Drawing Rights (SDR) scheme was elaborated as a contingency plan to remedy any potential shortage of world liquidity. Second, the ministers agreed that a majority of 85 percent of the total voting power of an IMF governors meeting would be required in decisions concerning the period, timing, amount and allocation of special drawing rights to a country in need—thus conferring veto powers to the Common Market countries (totalling 17 percent of the voting power in the IMF). This proposition was in line with the multilateral surveillance power constantly advocated by France.\n\nA special drawing account was set up at the Fund, separate from the general account. In contrast to the early CRU scheme, access to SDRs was made available to all members, not just the G-10. Members were credited SDRs in proportion to their quotas. One SDR was equivalent to one gold dollar (Bordo, 1993, pp. 66-67). Also, unlike the CRU, the SDR was a fiat obligation; it was not backed by gold. Its acceptability stemmed from the obligation by other members to accept SDRS—similar to the legal tender provision of domestic fiat money. Members must accept SDRs when the Fund mandates their acceptance, as long as their holdings are less than three times their cumulative allocation. This put a limit on the amount of a potentiality inferior asset that would have to be absorbed (Dam, 1982, p. 154). To prevent the SDR from aggravating the confidence problem (Williamson, 1977, p. 23), the SDR could be used to finance only balance of payments deficits. Furthermore, members were required to hold on average a balance over a five year period of at least 30 percent of its allocation. This was a compromise between France, which wanted the new facility to be a form of credit, and the United States, which wanted a reserve asset (Dam, 1982, pp. 163-164). Otherwise, members were free to use SDRs unconditionally. To use them, a member would notify the Fund, which would then designate a surplus country to receive SDRs and provide the deficit country an equal value of some convertible currency to use in intervention (Williamson, 1977, p. 22). As part of its continuing struggle against U.S. hegemony, France, in effect accepted the provisions that the SDR scheme could be activated only when the U.S. balance of payments deficit was eliminated. 31/ This was in opposition to the American view that the introduction of SDRs would then allow it to reduce its deficit.\n\nThe apparent harmony between Europe and the United States disintegrated at the annual meeting of the World Bank and the IMF in Rio on September 25 to 29. U.S. Treasury Secretary Fowler reconsidered putting forward specific proposals giving a veto to the Common Market countries within the year 32/ (The Financial Times, September 27, 1967). Michel Debré replied by declaring that the agreements on reforming the IMF were an absolute condition for France’s agreement to the liquidity plan. In addition, he repeatedly emphasized that France would not have supported the SDRs if they had been in any sense a substitute for gold as a basis of the world monetary system. He laid down the following three conditions for the activation of the SDR plan: (1) a collective agreement that a liquidity shortage existed; (2) an improvement in the operation of the adjustment process; and (3) the elimination of payments deficits of reserve currency countries (Jay, September 27, 1967).\n\nThe most significant event of the remaining part of 1967 was the devaluation of the pound on November 18. As displayed in figure 2, the United Kingdom had been experiencing serious balance of payments problems since 1964. The British counted on joining the Common Market to improve their position. However, at the end of October, Maurice Couve de Murville, the French foreign minister who was speaking in Luxembourg, laid down the following two conditions for British membership in the European Common Market: first, the British had to drop sterling as an international reserve currency and second, they had to achieve equilibrium in their international balance of payments (The Journal of Commerce, November 6, 1967). The French had succeeded in building a common front with the five other Common Market countries concerning their demands for a veto power within the IMF and of a reduction in the balance of payments deficits of the United States and Great Britain, the reserve currency countries.\n\nIn November, representatives of the G-10 countries conducted secret negotiations to support the pound. France was reported to be the only country of that group which did not firmly pledge against the devaluation of its own currency, should Britain decide to devalue the pound 33/ (Tanner, November 25, 1967). After a day marked by a rush on gold on the Paris stock market, 34/ the British currency was officially devalued by 14.3 percent (from $2.80 to $2.40) (Solomon, 1982) on November 18.\n\nIn the aftermath of the devaluation, the news that France had stopped contributing to the gold pool in June was leaked to the press (Lee, November 24, 1967). This set off a huge wave of buying on the London and Paris gold markets. 35/ Since the United States was furnishing about 60 percent of the gold pool supplies and was attempting to maintain the price of gold in the neighborhood of $35.00 per ounce, these speculative attacks on the gold markets entailed a considerable drain on American gold reserves 36/ (Lee, November 24, 1967). In light of the difficulties of the reserve currency countries, it was time for the French to intensify their pressures for a reform of the international monetary system, and on November 27, President de Gaulle declared during a press conference in Paris: “It is possible 37/ that the problems resulting from the devaluation of the pound will lead to the reestablishment of the international monetary system founded on the immutability, impartiality and universality which are the privileges of gold” (Vicker, November 28, 1967).\n\nFrom the beginning of 1968 until May, the French hardened their stand on the reform of the international monetary system. The drain on the U.S. gold reserves (see figure 5) from the events of the previous years led the United States in January 1968 to impose austerity measures, a curb on capital exports that successfully lowered their outflow of reserves (Farnsworth, January 25, 1968; The Wall Street Journal February 29, 1968). All the Common Market countries except France perceived that this reduction in U.S. reserve outflow was creating a shortage of international liquidity. As a consequence, they did not want to impose a reestablishment of the U.S. balance of payments equilibrium as a prior condition to the introduction of new instruments of international liquidity. The Common Market countries’ united front in international monetary negotiations was showing some strain (Davidson, February 26, 1968).\n\nDuring a meeting of the ministers of finance of the Common Market countries, ending in Rome on February 27, all participants agreed that the reform of the IMF giving them veto power had to be accepted simultaneously with the creation of a new liquidity scheme. However, in contrast to the other participants, France wanted to maintain the condition that the United States balance of payments be in equilibrium for a certain amount of time before starting the process of new liquidity creation. Isolated on this matter, Michel Debré suggested instead that France could join in participating in the discussions on the creation of the liquidity scheme but requested the chance to opt out of the agreement implementing the scheme if it did not consider the circumstances favorable to the creation of new liquidity 38/. Thus, the Rome meeting failed to produce unanimous agreement by all the Common Market countries.\n\nMounting speculative pressure on the U.S. dollar in the gold markets quickly led to a momentous change in international monetary arrangements. On March 17, the remaining members 39/ of the gold pool created a two tier pricing system for gold, whereby the official price of $35.00 per ounce would only be maintained for inter-central bank transactions and the market price for all others. This marked their determination to deflate the importance of gold in the international monetary system. The member countries also agreed not to draw gold from U.S. reserves nor to sell gold to private buyers (Heinemann, March 19, 1967). The key decision was a partial demonetization of gold, since the only gold that would be counted as international reserves would be the amount already owned by the central banking systems of the world and the IMF. Newly minted gold would still have a value, but not as money within the international monetary system (Rowen, March 20, 1967).\n\nThe French reaction to this event was to restate their public support for an international monetary system tied to gold. It was reported on March 24 that President de Gaulle declared that “France would not participate in any effort to strengthen the dollar until the present world monetary system [was] scrapped in favor of a new one tied to gold. What the French President [wanted], in effect, [was] a new Bretton Woods conference” (Tanner March 24, 1968). On March 29, at the opening of the Ministerial meeting of the Group of Ten in Stockholm, Michel Debré openly declared that there was a case for considering an increase in the price of gold. This was the first time that a French government official publicly stated his support for an increase in the price of gold 40/. In addition, he said that France would insist on a restrictive interpretation of the outline agreements reached between the Ten in London and at the IMF meetings in Rio in 1967 (Davidson, March 30, 1968). On March 30, however, all other countries but France voted to adopt the Special Drawing Rights plan. By doing so, the Western powers demonstrated for the first time that they could bypass France in the drafting of international monetary agreements (Lee, March 31, 1968).\n\nMichel Debré justified the French decision not to ratify the Stockholm agreement during the regular monthly meeting of the Parisian economic and financial press. He declared that the definition of the SDR’s proposed in Stockholm was markedly different than their definition at the Rio conference, that is, they were closer to money than to credit. Furthermore, he said, the proposal stated no guarantees on the implementation date of the new liquidity or on the condition of reestablishing equilibrium of the U.S. balance of payments before implementing the new liquidity scheme. Finally, Debré stated that the sterling devaluation of 1967 and the gold pool decisions of March 1968 had generated a new economic environment that warranted closer scrutiny before designing a new liquidity scheme. However, he declared that the Stockholm agreement was coincident in many respects with the French position on international monetary policy. 41/\n\nDebré enumerated the two fundamental principles guiding French international monetary policy: first, the international monetary system should be based on the equality of the industrialized countries and, second, all these countries’ currencies had to be convertible in gold. The currencies’ values in terms of gold could be revised, after due negotiations among the major industrialized countries, every twenty-five years or so. He argued that these principles were closer in spirit to the initial intention of the Bretton Woods conference: “Dire celà, ce n’est pas revenir vers le passé. C’est au contraire rappeler les principes solides établis à Bretton Woods: la convertibilité de toutes les monnaies et leur rattachement à l’or.” (Le Monde, April 6, 1968).\n\nIn conclusion, French international monetary policy throughout the 1960s was conducted with the constant objective of modifying the international monetary system on a basis that would be closer in spirit to the French plan of 1943 and to the experts’ recommendations at the Genoa conference in 1922. It was for a gold exchange standard where all currencies would be linked to gold in fixed proportions and where the major industrialized countries had equal say in the rules of the international monetary system. The recourse of mentioning the possibility of returning to an orthodox gold standard was used as a strategy by the French government to bring the Americans to agree on the modification of the international monetary system 42/. As argued by Triffin (1968), “de Gaulle had not proposed the return to a pure gold standard, and what has collapsed in 1931 was not the pure gold standard but the sterling component of a gold exchange standard. De Gaulle foresaw correctly, as has now become clear to all—that the perpetuation of the same system would inevitably pose a similar threat to the dollar itself.”\n\nThe collapse of the gold dollar standard and the creation of the two-tier gold market in March 1968 effectively ended France’s leverage over the international monetary system. No longer could the threat of converting her (and other EEC members’) gold reserves into dollars be used as a viable threat to convert the gold dollar standard into a multiple currency gold exchange standard because the system had now evolved into a pure dollar standard. The events of May 1968 further ensured France’s future impotence."
