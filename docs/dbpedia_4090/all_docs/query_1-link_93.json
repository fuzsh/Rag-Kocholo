        "text": "PARIS 1944: Occupation, Resistance, Liberation, by Patrick Bishop\n\nThe Liberation of Paris in 1944 is an undeniably alluring subject, especially in the wake of the recent French elections. In July, a coalition of left-wing parties mounted a stunning, last-minute rebuke to what was shaping up to be the country’s first far-right government since World War II.\n\nWe’ve long nurtured the romantic image of Parisians taking up arms against fascist occupiers, complete with black-and-white photo montages. Henri Cartier-Bresson and Robert Capa provided the documentary snapshots; Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall suggested the glamorous characters.\n\nStill, beyond recounting the chaotic exuberance of that week in August 1944 — the labor strikes, the acts of sabotage, the police rebellion — the question for historians trying to approach the subject now is how they will surprise us.\n\nThe British military historian and former war correspondent Patrick Bishop doesn’t offer a bold new analysis in his social history of the period, “Paris 1944.” Instead, he aims to highlight the symbolic power of that mythic city, by drawing the reader into the streets of Paris just in time for the 80th anniversary of its liberation.\n\nAlthough it looked a lot like a people’s revolt against Nazi tyranny when the once-exiled Gen. Charles de Gaulle strode down the Champs-Élysées to Notre-Dame Cathedral on Aug. 26, 1944, scholars have long observed that it would have amounted to little without help from the Allies.\n\nFrance was as divided then as it is today, and some Parisians were happy to go along with the new Nazi-backed regime. After the war, de Gaulle tried to paint a picture of a unified France under the yoke of Nazi occupation, the people fighting a tyranny imposed from without. That image persisted, but thanks to the historian Robert O. Paxton’s pioneering scholarship and Marcel Ophuls’s documentary film “The Sorrow and the Pity,” we now know how greatly exaggerated this story was.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
