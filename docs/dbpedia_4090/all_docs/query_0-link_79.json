        "text": "With such horrendous figures, how could anyone call it a victory? France had only one main enemy on one front, and it wasn't alone. Germany, on the other hand, had far too many enemies. But if that were the case, why did the Allies suffer significantly greater losses on the Western Front than the Germans, who, until the end, remained superior to the French and the British in the art of killing? And why did the French army, which was supposedly in excellent shape at the beginning of the war, lose about 230,000 soldiers in the first three months, from August to October 1914, more than in any other time period after that, even on the bloody fields of Verdun?\n\nThroughout the entire duration of the war, almost 52 months, or 1,564 days, an average of 900 Frenchmen were killed every day. On Aug. 22, 1914, the French army experienced a disaster of historic proportions. In a series of battles near the town of Rossignol in the Belgian Ardennes Mountains, near the border with France, 27,000 French soldiers were killed in a single day, four times as many as at the Battle of Waterloo a century earlier. It was a slaughter without compare, in both the past and the future of the country's long military history.\n\nRevisiting French Losses\n\nThe disastrous beginning of the war in the late summer of 1914, which almost led France to defeat within a few weeks, raised questions that were eventually addressed, after the war, by a parliamentary investigation committee in the summer of 1919. How was it possible that, despite the smooth mobilization of French forces, the enemy could penetrate so deeply into the country? So deeply, in fact, that the frontline stretched across French territory until the end? Why were the ore mines of Briey in Lorraine, critical to the production of arms, lost so quickly? Thirteen administrative regions, or départements, in eastern and northern France became embroiled in the war and were fully or partially occupied by the Germans. They include the center of French heavy industry, Lorraine, which was the equivalent of Germany's industrial Ruhr region.\n\nThe members of the investigative committee failed to reach any clear conclusions. A ruthless investigation would have been politically inopportune, because it would have painted the nation's new heroes after the victory, especially the supreme commander in the first postwar years, Joseph Joffre, in an overly unfavorable light.\n\nMost of all, the committee would have had to investigate the myth that, in August 1914, France was waging a purely defensive war and that, as a result, the struggle to defend the nation was deeply just, and that the horrible sacrifices also had to be accepted as being justified.\n\nContrary to the general assumption, Joffre, an intelligent but arrogant and suspicious officer who kept his commanders on a short leash, lacked a precise plan of operation. Instead, he was chiefly motivated by a position: to attack at all costs, everywhere and wherever French troops encountered the enemy. There was no real defense plan, as Joffre's first order to all army commanders on Aug. 8 underscored: \"Take the offensive, with all forces in combination, to seek to bring the enemy to decisive battle.\"\n\n'Offensive to the Extreme'\n\nThe French leadership had not sought or even wanted war. But it had always expected it, and if war did erupt, it would be \"offensive to the extreme\" (\"offensive à outrance\"), in keeping with the theories Colonel Louis de Grandmaison had devised in 1906. These notions stemmed from the conviction that modern weapons technology and the mobilization of large-scale armies made a quick decision imperative. The Germans and the French alike believed that a lengthy war of attrition could not be sustained.\n\nIn this sense, France was prepared, both politically and militarily. The new \"Plan XVII,\" which Joffre developed between April 1913 and April 1914, envisioned swift and massive attacks on territory in Alsace and Lorraine that had been lost in 1871. The goal was to wrest control of the former départements on the Mosel and Rhine Rivers, which contained the cities of Metz, Strasbourg and Mulhouse, from France's \"sworn enemy\" once again.\n\nThe general mobilization that was decided on Aug. 1, two days before the German declaration of war, constituted a critical moment of uncertainty for then President Raymond Poincaré and Prime Minister René Viviani. A short time earlier, on July 31, 1914, a nationalist student had shot and killed the Socialist leader Jean Jaurès through the open window of a restaurant on Rue Montmartre in Paris. The politician, a powerful leader of the leftist peace movement, had been having dinner with a few of his supporters. The murder, in a sense a French version of the assassination of Austro-Hungarian Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo, could have had dramatic consequences, including rioting among workers, calls for strikes by trade unions and a blockade of the railroads.\n\nThe government anticipated the worst. The authorities had placed 2,481 suspicious persons on a blacklist known as Carnet B. The list included pacifist agitators, alleged agitators and potential spies, who were to be arrested in the event of an emergency. But despite the dismay over the Jaurès killing, calm prevailed in the otherwise nervous capital. The French proletariat did its patriotic duty and obeyed the call to arms. Speaking at Jaurès' coffin, trade union leader Léon Jouhaux solemnly promised that the workers would respond vigorously to the mobilization by reporting to duty, and would \"rise up to repel the invader.\"\n\nPrimacy of the French Political Class\n\nThe French concentration of troops progressed in good order. Some 800,000 active-duty soldiers and close to 1.3 million reservists advanced to their positions along the northern and eastern borders. From Aug. 2-18, 4,278 trains transported the bulk of the army to the train stations in Sedan, Montmédy, Toul, Nancy and Belfort. The armed forces requisitioned more than 600,000 horses and mules. At the same time, the navy began bringing in colonial troops from Algeria and Tunisia. Only a year earlier, France had increased compulsory military service from two to three years, in an effort to offset Germany's numerical superiority.\n\nIn a speech to the Chamber of Deputies on Aug. 4, President Poincaré invoked the \"union sacrée,\" or sacred union, which was to bring together all parties, denominations and classes in sacred unity to defend the nation -- no small matter in a deeply divided republic, which had only introduced the separation of church and state in 1905, following a bitter culture war with the Catholic Church. The internal truce lasted almost the entire war.\n\nAnd in contrast to Germany, politicians retained their primacy over the military leadership. In fact, it only became stronger during the course of the war. Joffre was ousted in 1916, because of his unsuccessful and losing strategy, as was his successor, Robert Nivelle, in 1917. In France's collective memory, the real father of victory was not a military leader but a politician, the combative republican Georges Clemenceau. \"The Tiger,\" as he was called, became prime minister and war minister in November 1917, and he subsequently led the peace negotiations in Versailles -- a sort of French response to Bismarck's unification of the German Empire at Versaille in 1871. The occupation of the Rhineland, which began in 1919 as a result of Clemenceau's efforts, was intended to provide France with a security guarantee. Instead, it only poisoned relations between the two countries for years to come.\n\nNear Defeat on the Western Front\n\nIn the west, the war could have ended with France's total defeat in mid-September 1914, after only six weeks, even more quickly than the German general staff had planned (and as it succeeded in doing in 1940). The attacks in Alsace and Lorraine ordered by Joffre failed, and after the fall of the Belgian city of Liège on Aug. 7, three German armies, in forced marches of up to 30 kilometers (19 miles) a day, hurried through Belgium and toward the French border. Near Dinant and Charleroi, two German armies encountered the French Fifth Army, which was advancing in the direction of Namur.\n\nThe French commander, Charles Lanrezac, hesitated, unsure of which tactics to pursue. Should he defend at all costs the Charleroi-Namur line, as well as the banks of the Meuse River, as Joffre wished? The headstrong general, no supporter of the prevailing offensive doctrine, recognized the danger of being encircled by the Germans along his left and right flanks. Without consulting his superior, Joffre, he beat a retreat with the entire Fifth Army. Some of the officers on his staff were outraged over his trepidation, because Lanrezac's decision also forced the majority of the French troops, together with the British Expeditionary Force, to retreat along the entire length of the front, from east to west.\n\nWhat no one recognized was that what appeared to be a shameful defeat actually contributed to the French being saved from the trap of the Schlieffen plan.\n\nAt first, the German armies threatened to topple Paris. The French government withdrew to Bordeaux (as it had done before in 1871, and would later do in 1940). City commandant Joseph Gallieni prepared for a siege of the French capital, which was still a fortified city of strongholds, walls and artillery at the time. He even planned to blow up the Eiffel Tower and the bridges over the Seine River, if necessary.\n\nMiracle of the Marne\n\nThe unexpected turnaround that rescued France from disaster has since entered the history books of every generation of schoolchildren as the \"Miracle of the Marne.\" General Alexander von Kluck, commander of the First German Army along the extreme right flank, the critical flank in the Schlieffen plan, suddenly changed his line of approach. Under the assumption that the upcoming decisive battle was looming along his left flank, he directed his troops to the southeast, instead of circumventing Paris in a wide arc to the west, as planned.\n\nGallieni, who, to his surprise, no longer faced the threat of attack, released his defensive forces for a counterattack. Paris taxis shuttled them to the front, where they threatened Kluck's flank, and the \"taxis de la Marne\" went down in history. Joffre regrouped his troops, assembled two new armies and recognized the opportunity to penetrate into a breach that had formed between Kluck's First and Second Armies.\n\nThe Battle of the Marne began on Sept. 6, along a front extending for more than 100 kilometers. It ended a week later, when the unnerved German chief of staff, Helmuth von Moltke, gave the order to retreat. He also ordered the fortification of new positions on the banks of the Aisne River, a decision that marked a turning point on the Western Front, when position warfare in the trenches began.\n\nFrom the fall of 1914 to the spring of 1917 -- in fact, until the last German offensive in March 1918 -- the front, stretching 750 kilometers from Ypern in Flanders to Mulhouse in Alsace, remained more or less static. It never bulged by more than 20 to 30 kilometers in either direction. All advances (under Joffre in the Artois and Champagne in 1915, under Falkenhayn near Verdun in 1916, and under Nivelle along the Chemin des Dames ridge in 1917) failed, causing immense losses while yielding strategically insignificant gains in territory.\n\nNon-Victory and Reconciliation\n\nThe marshals and generals have been consigned to history. The culture of the victim has replaced hero worship, leaving behind mourning, consternation and a morbid fascination with the horrors of the war. The Great War formed the culmination of a catastrophic sequence from 1870 to 1940, tying France and Germany together as archenemies in a mimetic love-hate relationship.\n\nAnd yet, paradoxically, it also laid the foundation for later reconciliation, perhaps precisely because the war ended with a non-victory, at least in the French perception. In the commemorative year, the former mortal enemies have closer ties than the former allies, the French the British, and today's \"entente cordiale\" encompasses Germany and France rather than France and England. The idea of a war between European nations seems to have become absurd, and European unification constitutes a regional attainment of the world peace envisioned by Immanuel Kant and the philosophers of the Enlightenment.\n\nHistorian Antoine Prost, chairman of the academic advisory council for the commemorative ceremonies, sees this as the most important change brought about by 1914/18: The absolute sovereignty of the nation-states, the greatest expression and terrible culmination of which was the war, was called into question. The state, the god of the slaughter, lost its legitimacy."
