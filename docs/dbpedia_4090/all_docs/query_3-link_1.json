        "text": "When France and Britain finally decided that armed conflict was unavoidable and declared war on Germany on September 3, 1939, two days after Hitler’s invasion of Poland, de Gaulle assumed command of a tank brigade in the French Fifth Army. His unit participated in the largely forgotten Saar Offensive, where the French army achieved some modest gains in the western German region of the Saarland, before a German counteroffensive drove them out. For the next several months, he observed a stunningly long period of inaction, as French forces waited behind the Maginot Line.\n\nDe Gaulle’s deepest anxieties came true on May 10, 1940, as the German military launched the long-expected invasion of France and the Low Countries. The breakthrough the Germans accomplished via the Ardennes shocked French and British leadership. Appointed brigadier-general, de Gaulle led the 4th Armored Division. In late May and early June, his division gave a good account of itself against the Germans at Abbeville, near the mouth of the Somme River in northern France. Around him, though, things fell apart with horrid rapidity.\n\nOn June 6, 1940, De Gaulle was promoted to undersecretary of state for defense in Paul Reynaud’s government. In his new post, he engaged in frequent exchanges with the British government, now led by Winston Churchill. During these dark days, he witnessed the collapse of Third Republic France, the only France he had ever known. German soldiers entered Paris in triumph on June 14, something they had never done in World War I. It was time to evacuate.\n\nBrigadier-General de Gaulle’s very arrival in England was dramatic. On June 16, Reynaud stepped down, succeeded by de Gaulle’s aged former mentor, Marshal Pétain. The next day, de Gaulle boarded a British aircraft in Bordeaux, the port city in the southwest of France where the French government had fled as the Germans approached Paris. With his aide-de-camp, Lieutenant Geoffroy de Courcel, and British liaison officer Edward Spears, he made it safely to London. That very day, though, Pétain requested armistice terms from the Germans. The old marshal would soon head, along with Pierre Laval, a government in Vichy that defined collaborationism for generations to come.\n\nOffered the opportunity to speak via the British Broadcasting Corporation, de Gaulle understood the gravity of the moment. So, on the night of June 18, a Tuesday, he issued a passionate appeal to the populace of France. His remarks revealed the level of confidence he had in himself. Attributing his country’s defeat to the sophistication of German technology and tactics and the weakness of France’s leadership, de Gaulle refused to abandon hope. “Nothing is lost for France,” he declared. The French people could look to their empire and to the backing of Great Britain. “For France is not alone! She is not alone!” He enjoined members of the French military, enlisted men and officers, and individuals with engineering backgrounds or with experience in armaments production to aid him. Technology, the address accented, was not the patrimony of Nazi Germany but could nourish the revival of France’s fortunes in this world war. “Whatever happens,” de Gaulle asserted, “the flame of French resistance must not be extinguished and will not be extinguished.”\n\nThough the address later acquired an almost legendary status—no small thanks to de Gaulle’s penchant for self-mythologization, hardly anyone in France heard it. In fact, only a small number of people in France really knew who Charles de Gaulle was. Furthermore, much to de Gaulle’s chagrin, British engineers chose not to record the speech!\n\nAfter grasping the salience of his remarks, the BBC arranged for de Gaulle to give them again on the 22nd. This time, the broadcast was recorded and reached many more people inside occupied France. The timing could not have been graver, since on that same day, the French government signed the armistice at Compiégne and more than 1.5 million French servicemembers officially became German prisoners of war.\n\nIn the address of June 22, de Gaulle did not merely repeat his statements from four days earlier. The newly signed armistice “would result not only in capitulation but also in slavery.” Reaching new heights with his rhetoric, he invoked three essential aspects of struggle: common sense, honor, and the “higher interest of the French nation.” Any decent person possessing these must commit to maintaining the fight against Hitler, a fight that de Gaulle characterized here with insouciance, as one between freedom and slavery. While mentioning his British hosts and reminding listeners of the resources available in France’s colonial holdings, he spoke as well of the possibilities of American economic assistance. The industrial colossus that was the United States certainly fit into his vision of the role technology would play in vanquishing the Nazis.\n\nMore than in the June 18 speech, de Gaulle foregrounded his own person in this appeal. Placing himself at the center, he once more invited members of France’s armed forces, the aforementioned engineers and armaments workers, and any others “who want to remain free” to join him in England in “this national task.” The address closed with the powerful “Long live a free and independent France!”\n\nThis was one of the decisive episodes early in the Second World War. No matter one’s opinion of de Gaulle—his conservatism, nationalism, and imperialism—or his arrogance, he made a crucial stand. In his memoirs, de Gaulle remembered that “not a single public figure raised his voice to condemn the armistice.” After his speeches, he indeed appeared to be a man without a country, standing alone. Most of the French Empire initially professed loyalty to Pétain. For those who wished to do so, joining de Gaulle, in the United Kingdom was no minor task. Vichy or German authorities would do everything they could to prevent it. Moreover, many men and women felt a sense of shame in leaving France at such a moment.\n\nRobert Paxton, the great historian of France during World War II, pointed out, “many on the Left found de Gaulle’s following far too clerical, military, and nationalist for comfort. Warm relations between de Gaulle and the internal Left resistance were a good two years in the future.” It would take a figure like Jean Moulin to undertake the enormously difficult but vital mission of securing support from French socialists, communists, and trade unionists, a task made much easier by Nazi Germany’s invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941.\n\nDevelopments beyond de Gaulle’s control also hindered his early efforts at creating a Free French alternative. The Royal Navy’s attack on the French naval force at Mers-el-Kebir in northwest Algeria on July 3, 1940, ostensibly to prevent it falling into German hands, resulted in the deaths of 1,300 French sailors and engendered much bitterness against Winston Churchill—and anyone touting support from Britain. A military court in France subsequently sentenced de Gaulle to death for treason and ordered the confiscation of his property.\n\nUndaunted, de Gaulle persevered in building a Free French movement. Churchill promised sustained British aid in early August. When de Gaulle’s supporters seized control of French Equatorial Africa in the late summer and early fall of 1940, he seemed vindicated in his conviction that hope was not exhausted. This was the first of many episodes pitting Free French against Vichy French in what took on the character of a civil war across France’s far-flung empire. De Gaulle’s June 1940 addresses, while a centerpiece of later mythologizing, did embolden those inside and outside France, including not a few with radically different and more progressive politics than his, to rededicate themselves to combating a Nazi enemy that looked invincible that summer.\n\nRecommended Reading:\n\nDoughty, Robert. “De Gaulle’s Concept of a Mobile, Professional Army: Genesis of French Defeat?” Parameters 4, no. 1 (1974), doi:10.55540/0031-1723.1064.\n\nGildea, Robert.
