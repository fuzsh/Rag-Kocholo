        "text": "Charles de Gaulle (1890­–1970) was wounded three times in World War I and the leading French advocate of armored warfare between the wars. Following the defeat of France in May 1940, he escaped to London and raised the Free French forces. After liberation he became the provisional head of the French government. He was the founding father of the Fifth Republic, president of France from 1959 to 1969, and one of the leading statesmen of the 20th century."
