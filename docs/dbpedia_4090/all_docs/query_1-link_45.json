        "text": "Charles de Gaulle was only 15 when he first revealed his dream to lead the armies of France and save its honour. A strong sense of history was matched by a love of the French language, and his mesmerising oratory later helped the junior general of 1940 to become the political leader who towered over his country's destiny.\n\nThe German invasion of France, which began in May 1940, proved devastating. General de Gaulle's 4th Armoured Division, advancing bravely into battle near Laon on May 17, was decimated by Stukas and forced to withdraw. After another more successful attack, he was summoned at the end of the month to Paris, where he saw Paul Reynaud, the prime minister. Reynaud offered him a junior post in the government, but he had also invited Marshal Philippe Pétain, the hero of Verdun, to join the cabinet as vice-president. And Pétain led the faction of capitulards who wanted to come to terms with the Nazis. De Gaulle, formerly the most favoured disciple of the old marshal, had now fallen out with him.\n\nParis was abandoned on June 10. Amid chaos and demoralisation, the government retreated along roads swarming with refugees all the way to Bordeaux. On June 16, Reynaud was outmanoeuvred at the council of ministers and resigned. De Gaulle, who had been with Churchill in London, flew back to Bordeaux that night and heard that Pétain would seek an armistice. He too was now in the wilderness and at risk of arrest for wanting to fight on. He went to see Reynaud, who in spite of his resignation, provided him with passports and money.\n\nEarly next morning, June 17, De Gaulle fled France in a biplane with Churchill's representative, General Edward Spears. To fly over the English channel was akin to crossing the Rubicon. De Gaulle was now technically a rebel and a deserter from the army he loved. The turbulence of his feelings can never be in doubt. Years later, when the writer and statesman André Malraux asked him about this moment, he took both of Malraux's hands in his. \"Oh, Malraux,\" he said slowly. \"It was frightful.\"\n\nThey landed at Heston aerodrome soon after midday, unaware that Marshal Pétain was announcing the armistice to the French nation at that moment. For the majority of his listeners, refugees and demoralised soldiers alike, this was what they desperately wanted to hear. The fact that it was Pétain, with his reputation as a great military hero, who had stopped the fighting cleansed them of guilt. The new father of the nation had assumed their responsibilities. Spears took De Gaulle and Courcel to see Churchill in the garden at Downing Street. There, in the afternoon sunshine, as De Gaulle's biographer, Jean Lacouture, describes, the tall, awkward Frenchman asked for help in \"hoisting the colours\". He wanted to use the BBC to address the French people. Churchill agreed without hesitation. De Gaulle set to work that evening to draft his speech, chain-smoking as always.\n\nThe next morning, several members of the war cabinet were uneasy about the speech. Their chief priority was to persuade the government in Bordeaux to refuse to hand over the French fleet to the Germans. De Gaulle's proclamation of revolt from London might well prove counter-productive at such a moment. But after further discussion round the table, agreement was reached. Duff Cooper, the minister of information, gave De Gaulle lunch, and then left him to finish correcting his text.\n\nDe Gaulle and his aide took a taxi to Broadcasting House, where they were conducted to Studio 4B. The General was asked to say something to check the voice level. \"La France\", he intoned in his deep voice. One of those present described how pale he was and that his brown forelock was glued to his forehead. \"He stared at the microphone as though it were France and as though he wanted to hypnotise it. His voice was clear, firm and rather loud, the voice of a man speaking to his troops before battle. He did not seem nervous, but extremely tense, as though he were concentrating all his power in one single moment.\"\n\nDe Gaulle does not launch into a diatribe against Pétain and the other capitulards who were soon to become the men of Vichy. He simply starts with the bare facts, but using the odd loaded word, such as when he says: \"Alleging the defeat of our armies, this government has entered into negotiations with the enemy.\" While this very brief address becomes rich in the rhetoric of defiance, it also proves extraordinarily prophetic. The battle of France may have been lost, he says, but France was not alone, and she and Britain would be able to \"draw unreservedly on the immense industrial resources of the United States.\" France may have been \"crushed by the sheer weight of mechanised force\" hurled against it, \"but we can still look to a future in which even greater mechanised force will bring us victory. The destiny of the world is at stake.\" He then finishes with his personal appeal, calling on all French officers and men who can to rally to him, and promises to speak again. His language, using the wavelike repetitions of classical oratory, acts like a poetic drumroll.\n\nDe Gaulle's address of June 19 is even shorter. He claims that the French state has collapsed, \"that all ordinary forms of authority have disappeared\". The \"disintegration of a government in thrall to the enemy\" prompted him now to \"speak for France\", and call upon soldiers and sailors in North Africa and elsewhere to resist the invaders and rally to his cause.\n\nThe longest of the three speeches was made on June 22. Now that Pétain's acceptance of the humiliating terms were starting to emerge, De Gaulle feels free to speak out far more strongly. The armistice would reduce France to slavery. His own determination to fight on now implicitly puts him and his handful of followers on a par with the governments-in-exile of other occupied countries, such as Poland, Norway, Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg. Once again he re-emphasises that this was not just a war between Germany and France. It was a world war and the industrial might of the United States would eventually prevail. He calls again upon all soldiers to join him and asks their commanders to contact him.\n\nFew may have heard the original speech of June 18, but it was reproduced, at least in part, in several French provincial newspapers and word spread. But back in London, De Gaulle's hosts soon found how prickly and difficult he could be. The BBC was rather taken aback when he announced over the air without warning them that he would be speaking again the following night. The Foreign Office was horrified by the more direct attacks on the Bordeaux government in the second speech and complained to Churchill. The future of the French navy still perturbed them.\n\nDe Gaulle, proud, unbending and infinitely touchy, would soon provoke his hosts, especially Churchill, to rage against his obstinacy and ingratitude. But that speech of June 18, although delivered on the inconvenient anniversary of the battle of Waterloo, was the rallying call to a defeated France. It became the moment to which France could look with pride over the following difficult years, and bind the otherwise mortal wounds of humiliation with the great myth of the liberation which De Gaulle himself proclaimed from the Hôtel de Ville in Paris on 25 August, 1944. \"Paris outraged, Paris broken, Paris martyred, but Paris liberated! Liberated by herself, liberated by her people, with the help of the whole of France, that is to say of fighting France, the true France, eternal France.\" There was no acknowledgment of the British, who had given him shelter, nor of the Americans whose \"immense industrial resources\" had made the victory possible, as he had so accurately predicted. His obsessive national pride would not allow it."
