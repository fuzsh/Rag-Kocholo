(GA-ASI) is once again supporting the U.S. Navy during its Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise, this time for RIMPAC 2024.\n\nThe United Kingdom’s Royal Air Force (RAF) now has two Protector RG Mk1 Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) operating at RAF Waddington. The second Protector has started its ground trial at RAF Station Waddington with first flight expected in August."
