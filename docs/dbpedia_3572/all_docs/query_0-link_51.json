FACTS AND HISTORY OF THE DISPUTE\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nTHE CONTINENTAL SHELF BENEATH THE NORTH SEA\n\n5. The geographical description of the North Sea as given in paragraph 7\n\nof the Memorial of the Federal Republic of Germany does not call for any\n\nparticular comment. It should, however, be noted that, contrary to the state-\n\nment in paragraph 7 of the Mernorial, test dfillings in the subsoil under the\n\nNorth Sea had been made before 1963 and were not carried out directly or\n\nmerely as a result of the discoverof the natural gas fieldnear Slochteren.This\n\nsubject will be reverted to in detail in Chapter 2 of this Part of the Counter-\n\nMemorial (see infra, para. 11).\n\nIn order to provide the Court with a convenient geographical view of the\n\nNorth Sea the map enclosed inside the back cover of the Counter-Mernorial\n\n(Annex 17) shows, among other things, those continental shelf boundaries on\n\nwhich agreement has already been achieved-in al1cases on the basis of equi-\n\ndistance-as well as the boundaries of the North Sea under the North Sea\n\nFisheries Convention of 1882 l.\n\n6. With reference to paragraph 8 of the Memorial, it must be remarked that\n\nthe Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf of 29 Aprjl 1958 does not\n\nembody the concept of a singlecontinental shelfto be dividedamongthecoastal\n\nStates, but, on the contrary, recognizes the exclusive sovereignrights of every\n\nsingle State over the seabedand subsoil of the submarine areas adjacent to its\n\ncoast, the boundaries of these areas being determined by Articles 1 and 6 of\n\nthe said Convention. lt would, therefore, seem somewhat misleading touse the\n\nterminology \"the continental shelf of the North Sea\"; the title of the present\n\nChapter, accordingIy, refers to the continental shelf beneath the North Sea.\n\n7. Admittedly, the delimitation of continental shelf areas by application of\n\nthe equidistance principle results, as far as the continental shelf beneath the\n\nNorth Sea jsconcerned, in different total areas appertaining to the various\n\nStates adjacent to the North Sea. Indeed, the very legal basis of the sovereign\n\nrights of a coastal State over the continental shelfarea adjacent to its coast being\n\nthe concept of contiguity or propinquity, it is only to be expected that some\n\nStates, by reason of their geographic location, are in a better position in this\n\nrespect than other States. Thus, while al[ States have an equal right to use the\n\nhigh seas for the purposes of navigation, fishing and other lawful activities,\n\nonly States that border on the seacan havesovereignrights (whichare exclusive)\n\nin respect of the natural resources of the seabed and subsoil adjacent to their\n\ncoasts. Furthermore, while the submarine areas adjacent to some coastal\n\nStates are, or, very near the coast, become, so deep that they are, for the time\n\nbeing, not exploitable, other coastal States border on large areas of shallow\n\nsea. Finally, some submarine areas, shallow or not, are richer in natural\n\nresources than others. But then again, geographical location, including the\n\nl Convention for regulatingthe policeof theNorth Sea Fisheries,concludedat\n\nThe Hague, 6 May 1882; text printedinDe Martins'Nouveau Recueil Généradle\n\nrraitPs, Second SerieVol. 9, p. 556.310 NORTH SEA CONTINENTAL SHELF\n\nconfiguration of the coast, always brings benefits and disadvantages. For a\n\nsrnaIland densely populated country like the Netherlands, almost 50 per cent.\n\nof whoseterrajirmalies below sea-level,itis certainly noan undivided blessing\n\nto have a very long coastline and a direct \"frontage\" with the North Sea!\n\n8. Furtherrnore, the staternent in paragraph 8 of the Memorial to the effect\n\nthat \"the North Sea represents a special case\" is unfounded. Chapter 4 of the\n\nSecond Part of the Counter-Mernorial will go further into this subject (see\n\ninfra, paras. 127etseq.).\n\n9. With regard to paragraph 9 of the Memorial the following facts are\n\nsubmitted :\n\n(a)The angle of the German North Sea coast isapproximately 100'.\n\n(6) Neither the Federal RepubIic of Germany nor the Kingdom of the Nether-\n\nlands have, sofar,established straight base-lines along those parts of their\n\ncoasts which are involved in the determination of the boundary on the\n\ncontinental shelf. There is no dispute between the Parties on this particular\n\naspect of the delimitation.\n\n(c) The Island of Heligoland is of no significanceto the present disputesince\n\nit exercises no material influence, if indeeany influence at ali,,on the\n\nequidistance line. COUNTER-MEMORIAL OP THE NETHERLANDS\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nTHE ATTITUDE OF TWE KINGDOM OF THE NETNERLANDS\n\nIN RESPECT OF THE CONTINENTAL SHELF\n\n10. Not only does the Netherlands border on the North Sea, but a con-\n\nsiderable part of her territory has even, in the course of time, been reclaimed\n\nfrom the sea. The history of the \"LowCountries by the Sea\" has been marked\n\nby constantand multifariauscontacts with the sea.On the one hand, there is\n\nthe incessant struggle to reclaim land, to protect it against the water and to\n\nprevent salt water from causing salinization of the soilA few figures will\n\nillustrate the relative position of land and water in the Netherlands:\n\nacres\n\ntotal area of the Netherlands (1967) 10,090,000\n\ntotal water area (water surfacemore than 6 m. in width) 1,840,000\n\n--\n\ntotal land area 8,250,000\n\nland subject to flooding if there were no sea or river dykes 4,200,000\n\nland lost since the 13th century 1,400,OOO\n\nland reclairned since the 13th century (up till 1900) 1,280,000\n\nland reclaimed since 1900 (up till 1967) 300,000\n\nOn the other hand, there are the unrelenting efforts to make sea and its\n\nresources serve the national economy-through shipping, fishing,etc.-sothat\n\nthis country, which, after such miniature States as Monaco and Vatican City,\n\nis the most denselypopulated country in the world, may provide its population\n\nwith the necessary means of subsistence, which are not to be found in its own\n\nsoi1and subsoil.\n\nThe foregoing may explain the considerable interest in such matters as the\n\nstructure of the seabed and subsoil of the North Sea, which the Netherlands\n\nhashadfromearliest timesand must needshave in the future ifsheisto continue\n\nto exist. Sedimentological investigations in the North Sea were bepn in 1933\n\nwith the assistance and financial backing of the Netherlands Ministry of\n\n\"Waterstaat\". On government instructions gravimetric research in the North\n\nSea was conducted for the first time in 1938from a Netherlands subrnarine by\n\nProfessor F. A. Vening Meinesz. A general gravimetric survey of the whole\n\nNorth Sea area was carried out from 1955to 1957with the assistance of the\n\nRoyal Netherlands Navy.\n\n11. Apart from one well in 1938(which demonstrated for the first time the\n\npresence of oil in the western part of the Netherlands), Netherlands and foreign\n\noil companies have drilled some 30 deep boreholes with a total drilled footage\n\nof 185,875feet, on NetherIands territory, namely in a strip along the North Sea\n\ncoast and in the Wadden Islands. In 1956 the NederlaradseAardolie Maat-\n\nschappij (N.A.M.) started detailed gravity measurements in the North Sea,\n\noutside territorial waters. Since 1959the N.A.M. has been exploring with the\n\nseismicmethod in the North Sea throughout the area which, on the basis of the\n\nequidistance principle,constitutes the Netherlands part of the continental shelf;\n\nsince 1960, these activities have been especially concentrated on the northern\n\npart and up to the median lines which separate the Netherlands part from the\n\nGerman and Danish parts of the shelf. The above-mentioned exploration has\n\ncontinued to date.312 NORTH SEA CONTINENTAL SHELF\n\nIn 1961the first wellwas drilled in the North Sea. The operation was carried\n\nout by the N.A.M. in the Netherlands territorial sea off Kijkduin. It shouldbe\n\nnoted that, besides other borings in territorial waters, the N.A.M. in 1962\n\nmade three borings on the continental shelf,representing a total drilled footage\n\nof 23,302feet.\n\nParticularly after the discovery in 1959of the \"Slochteren\" natural gas field\n\nin the province of Groningen, expectations grew that the continental shelf in\n\nthe North Sea might contain this minera1in commercial quantities. In anticipa-\n\ntion of the entry into force of NetherIandslegislationconcerningthecontinental\n\nshelf (seeinfra,para. 15),requests from various companies for permission to\n\nconduct seismic operations have been granted. In addition to two licences\n\ngranted to the N.A.M., in virtue of which.the said Netherlands Company has\n\nbeen able to carry out the above-mentioned exploration activities since 1959,a\n\ntotal of 24 licences have been granted during the penod from August 1962to\n\n1966to about 19cornpaniesor groups of cornpaniesrepresenting rnainlyforeign\n\ninterests (Arnerican, Belgian,British, French, German and Italian), which have\n\nthus been given the opportunity to prepare for drilling activities on the Nether-\n\nlands part of the continental shelf. The licences in question cover al1of thal\n\npart of the continental shelf which cornesunder the jurisdiction of the Nether-\n\nlands on the basis of the equidistance principle.\n\nAfter the Netherlands legislation in respect of the continental shelf had corne\n\ninto effect inearly 1967,reconnaissance licencesweregranted on the basis of the\n\nnew Act on seven occasions. The licenceswent to three American, one Nether-\n\nlands and one French applicants.\n\nUnder the said Iegislation 20 applicants, representing 63 companies, sub-\n\nmitted applications for prospecting licences on 15 November 1967.\n\n12. In October 1957 the Netherlands Governrnent, in a ietter addressed to\n\nthe Secretary-General of the United Nations, commented on the draft articles\n\nof the Law of the Sea, drawn up by the International Law Commission at its\n\neighth session (1956).The following passage from the Netherlands comrnents\n\nmay be cited here:\n\n\"Continental Shei'f\n\nArticle 72\n\nAs in thecase of the boundaries of the territorîaI s.a..the Netherlands\n\nGovernment supports the principles embodied in article 72 with regard to\n\nthe delimitation of the continental shelf. The Netherlands Government\n\nwould like to emphasize the necessity of an internationally accepted rule\n\nfor these delirnitations, together with adequate safeguards for impartial\n\nadjudication in the case of disputes, as it will not be sufficient simply to\n\nexpress the hop that the States concerned will reach agreement on this\n\nmatter.\"\n\n13. During the Geneva Conference on the Law of the Sea in 1958, the\n\nNetherlands delegation voted in favour of, inter aliaA ,rticle 6 (Art. 72 of the\n\ndraft) of the Convention on the Continental Shelf.\n\n14. The Convention on the Continental Shelfwas ratified by the Kingdom of\n\nthe Netherlands on 18 February 1966 without any reservation. Seeing that\n\ncertain other States had for their part made reservations, the Government of\n\nthe Kingdom deemed it necessary to comment on some of those reservations.\n\nIn this connection mention should be made of the Venezuelan and French\n\nreservations to Article 6, the contents of which are reproduced in Annex 3 of\n\nthis Counter-Memorial. The Netherlandç Government declared, when deposit-\n\ning their instrument of ratificatiointer dia: COUNTER-MEMORIAL OF THE NETHERLANDS 313\n\n\"... that they do not find acceptable ... the reservations made by the\n\nGovernment of the French Republic to Articles .. ,6, paragraphs 1 and 2.\n\nThe Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands reserve al1rights\n\nregarding the reservations in respect of Article 6 made by the Govern-\n\nment of Venezuelawhen ratifying the present Convention\" (full text in\n\nAnnex 3 III).\n\nIt should here be stated that, contrary to the supposition expressedin the Iast\n\nsentence of paragraph 55of the Memorial (p. 58,supra), under general interna-\n\ntional law the declaration cited, like other declarations rejecting a reservation\n\nmade to an international convention, does indeed have legal eRect. Firstly,\n\nthe declaration has an incontestable effect upon the conventional relation be-\n\ntween the party that formulated the reservation and the party that objected to\n\nit. Secondly, the declaration deprives the reservation of the effectwhich an ex-\n\npress or implied acceptanm of the reservation otherwise could have upon the\n\ninterpretation of the conventional provision affected by it.\n\n15. In paragraphs 10 and 15,the Memorial of the Federal Republic correctly\n\nmentions the Netherlands \"Continental ShelfMiningAct\" (Actof23September\n\n1965regulating the exploration for and the production of rninerals in oron the\n\npart of the continental shelf situated under the North Sea) as the iïrst Nether-\n\nlands legislative rneasure pertaining to the exerciseof sovereign rights over the\n\ncontinental shelf. However, this Act did not \"claim\" any rights, as is stated in\n\nparagraph IO of the said Memonal, but simply enacted regulations for the\n\nrealization of the sovereign rights already vested in the Kingdom under inter-\n\nnational law.\n\nNor isparagraph 15 of the Mernorial entirely correct without further ex-\n\nplanation. It is true that the Continental Shelf Mining Act does not definethe\n\nboundaries of the Netherlands part of the shelf,but it defines the Netherlands\n\nshelf asfollows in Article1, paragraph 1:\n\n\"For the purposes of the provisionslaid down in or pursuant to this Act,\n\nthe following expressions shall have the meanings hereby respectively\n\nassigned to them:\n\n'continental shelf' means that part of the seabed and the subsoil thereof\n\nsituated under the North Sea in respect of which the Kingdomhas sover-\n\neign rights in accordance with, interaliat,he Convention on the Con-\n\ntinental Shelf concluded at Geneva on 29 April, 1958 (Netherlands\n\nTreaty Series 1959,No. 126)and whichliesseawards of the line determined\n\nin pursuance of para. 2.\" (Translation.)\n\n(The dividing line determjned under para. 2 approximately coincides with tlie\n\nouter lirnits of the territorial sea.)\n\nMoreover, when this Act was in the preparatory stage, a rnap of the North\n\nSea showing the boundaries of the Netherlands continental shelf (see fig. 1)\n\nwas submitted to the States GeneraI on 19February 1965and reproduced in the\n\nParliamentary Documents (1964165-7670,nr. 7). Apart from some additions it\n\nisthis same map, showing the same outer-limits of the Netherlands continental\n\nshelf, that was reproduced later in the Bulletin of Acts, Orders and Decrees,\n\ntogether with the Royal Decree (nat a Govemment Resolution) of 27 January\n\n1967referred to in the Memorial (seefig. 2).\n\n16. In the absence of special circumstances the Netherlands Government,\n\nwhen preparing or takingmeasures relating to the continental shelf under the\n\nNorth Sea, has been able to baund the area of application of these measures314 NORTH SEA CONTINENTALSHELF\n\nFigure 1(February 1965)Figure 2 (January 1967)316 NORTH SEA CONTMENTAL SHELF\n\nby the lines which, drawn on the basis of the principle of equidistance, form\n\nthe delimitation in space of the sovereignrights which the Kingdom, by virtue\n\nof international law, has over that shelf. As already stated in this Chapter, the\n\nNetherlands Government has adopted that basis in particular when granting\n\nlicences (see supra, para. 11) and when preparing the Bill, submitted to the\n\nStates General in June 1964, that was later to becorne the Continental Shelf\n\nMining Act (see supra, para. 15).\n\nAt one place, however, a special circumstance does in fact prevail that, in\n\nthe opinion of theNetherlands Government, affectsthe position oftheboundary\n\nline dividing the continental shelf: at the place where the Ems, flowing into the\n\nNorth Sea, forms the boundary between the territory of the Kingdom and that\n\nof the Federal Republic, there is, for historical and other reasons, no agreed\n\nboundary line between the two States. This circumstance has an effect on the\n\nstarting-point of the line that constitutes the eastern boundary of the Nether-\n\nlands part of the continental shelf. This special circumstance, which will be\n\nreverted to in Chapter4 of this Part (seinfrapara. 29), prompted the Nether-\n\nlands Government to rnake known its standpoint on the said starting-pointto\n\nthe German Federal Government in a Note Verbale on 21 June 1963.The text\n\nof the Note Verbale is reproduced in Annex 2 to the Memorial of the Federal\n\nRepublic. The English translation, embodied in Annex 2 A to the Memorial\n\n(p.97,supra), isnot entirelycorrect, namely wherethe words \"Hoheitsrechte zur\n\nGeltung bringt\" have ben translated as \"(it) claims sovereign rights\". The\n\nNetherlands Government did not claim sovereign rights; its statement con-\n\ncerned the part of the continental shelf where it exercises the sovereign rights\n\nenjoyed in virtue of international Iaw. A corrected translation of the Nether-\n\nlands Note Verbale is attached to this Counter-Mernorial as Annex 8\n\n(p. 378, infra).\n\n17. However, also at places whereno specialcircurnstancesentail a departure\n\nfrom the principle ofequidistance,there are advantages to be had in establishing\n\nthe boundary line in agreements with the other States whose rights over the\n\ncontinental shelf adjoin, territorially, those of the Kingdom. Article 6 of the\n\nGeneva Convention of 1958 (Counter-Memorial, Annex 1, p. 377, infra) inti-\n\nmates that the establishment of boundariesby agreement isto be preferred; fur-\n\nthermore, it is desirable to avoid uncertainty as regards the exact course of the\n\nboundary and to prevent the course of the boundary from being subject to auto-\n\nmatic displacementsshould natural or artificialchanges be madein the baselines\n\nthat determinetheequidistanceIine. TheNetherlands Government ha,therefore,\n\nshown itself prepared to collaborate in the realization of agreements with each\n\nof the other States whose part of the continental shelf adjoins the Netherlands\n\npart. These endeavours have had the following results:\n\n(a) With the Federal Republic of Germany, a partial delimitation: Treaty\n\nconcerning the lateral delimitation of the continental shelf near the Coast,\n\nconcluded at Bonn on 1 Decernber1964.(Textand translation in Memorial,\n\nAnnexes 3and 3A,pp. 98-101,supra.) For the significanceofthis Treaty and\n\nthe negotiations which led up to its conclusion, reference should be made\n\nto paragraphs 28, 29 and 30 below.\n\n(b) With the United Kingdom of Great Brila~nand Northern Ireland:Agree-\n\nment relating to the delimitation of the continental shelf under the North\n\nSea between the two countries, concluded at London on 6 Qctober 1965.\n\n(Text in Memorial, Annex 9, pp. 116-120,supra.) The dividing line agreed\n\nuponis based on the princjple of equjdistance.\n\n(c) With the Kingdom of Belgiurn,negotiations were conducted during 1965. COUNTER-MEMORIAI , F HE NETHERLANDS 317\n\nThese led, in the first instance, to a statement by the Belgian Government,\n\nin which it affirmed:\n\n\"the concurrence of opinion between the two countries on the principle\n\nof equidistance and the practical application thereof\" (translation),\n\nand in which it further declared that it had no objections to the point of\n\nintersection of the dividing lines between the Belgian, Netherlands and\n\nBritish parts of the continental shelf, as calculated on the basis of the\n\nprinciple of equidistance by the Netherlands and the British Govemment.\n\nThe statement in question is contained in a Note dated 15 September1965\n\nfrom the BelgianEmbassy at The Hague, the text and translation of which\n\nare appended to the Counter-Mernorial as Annexes 13and 13A (pp. 385-\n\n387, infra).\n\nThe negotiations with Belgium also resulted, at the end of 1965, in\n\nagreement, in principle, as to the exact course of the dividing Iine between\n\nthe two parts of the continental shelf. This lateral delimitation is based on\n\nthe principle of equidistance. For reasons connected with Belgiandomestic\n\nlegislation, ashas already appeared from the above-mentioned Note of\n\n15 September 1965, the conclusion of this Agreement has so far been\n\ndeferred l.\n\n(d) With the Kingdom of Denmark:Agreement concerning the delirnitatian\n\nof the continental shelf under the North Sea between the two countries,\n\nconcluded at The Hague on 31 March 1966. (Text and translation in\n\nMernorial, Annexes 14 and 14 A, pp. f33-138, supra.) The dividing line\n\nagreed upon is based upon the principle of equidistance.\n\n18. The Netherlands Government, in its domestic legislation as wellas in its\n\nagreements with other States, takes into account the possibikityof the presence\n\nof single geologicalstructures extending across the dividing line betweenparts\n\nof the continental shelf under the North Sea. Article 11 of the Continental\n\nShelf Mining Act mentioned in paragraph 15 above provides in subpara-\n\ngraph 2 lb): .\n\n\"2. To a production licence for a minera1 may aIso be attached the\n\nconditions that, if in rnaking use of that licence oa prospecting licence\n\nthe holder has proved the presence of that mineral in an economically\n\nproducible quantity, the holder shall:\n\n(a) .. .\n\n(b) if that mineral is present in a deposit which, in the opinion of Our\n\nMinister, extends beyond the boundary of the relevant part of the\n\ncontinental shelf, render the CO-operationrequested by Our Minister\n\nin concluding an agreement between the holder and the Party entitled\n\nto produce that mineral in an adjoining area, under which agreement\n\nproduction shall be effected in joint consultation.\" (Translation.)\n\nOn the same subject an Agreement wasconcluded with the United Kingdom\n\nof Great Britain and Northern Ireland on 6 October 1965. This Agreement\n\ngives rules for cases in which the part of a geological structure or field which\n\nis situated on one side of the dividing line proves to be exploitable from the\n\nother side of the line. The English text of the Agreement is appended to this\n\nCounter-Mernorial as Annex 12.\n\nIn the meantime,on 23 October 1967,a Billhas beensubmittedto the Belgian\n\nParliament, The Bill and Exposédes Motifs,whichillustrate once again that the\n\nin AnnexGo14.nmentbases itselupon the principleof equidistance.are reproduced NORTH SEA CONTINENTAL SHELF\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nTHE ATTITUDE OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF\n\nGERMANY IN RESPECT OF THE CONTINENTAL SHELF\n\n19. At the 1958 Geneva Conference the Federal Republic of Germany\n\nsubmitted a memorandurn to the Fourth Committee (the Continental Shelf\n\nCornmittee) advocating freeutilization for everyoneofthenatural resources of\n\nthe continental shelf, reseming only certain controliing rights to the coastal\n\nState closest to the installations in question.\n\n20. The Federal Republic's proposa1 received no support, however, from\n\nthe other States participating in the Conference, the preponderant view being\n\nthat an exclusive right to the natural resources of the shelf was vested in the\n\ncoastal State.\n\n21. The position of the Federal Republic at the various votes taken during\n\nthe Conference presents the following picture:\n\n(a) at the vote taken inthe Fourth Committee (the Continental Shelf Corn-\n\nrnittee) on Article 6 (at that time Art. 72) the Federal Republic voted in\n\nfavour thereof (United Nations Conferenceon the Law of the Sea, Vol. VI,\n\np. 98).\n\nAfter the vote the representative of the Federal Republic said: \"that, in\n\nview of the inexact nature of the outer limit of the continental shelas\n\ndefined by Article 67, his delegation would havepreferred the adoption of\n\nthe Venemelan amendment '.When that amendment was rejected, the\n\ndelegation of the Federal Republic of Germany had accepted the views of\n\nthe rnajority of the Committee, subject to an interpretation of the words\n\n'specialcircumstances' as meaning that any exceptional delimitation of\n\nterritorial waters would affect the delimitation of the continental shelf\"\n\n(ibid.para. 38).\n\n(6;) At the ninth plenary meeting on 22 April 1958, Article 6 (at that time\n\nstill Art. 72) was adopted. The Federal Republic of Germany did not\n\nvote against the Article and it seems reasonable to assume that she was\n\nnotamong those abstaining.\n\n(cl At the eighteenth plenary meeting on 26 April 1958the Convention as a\n\nwhole was adopted. The Federal RepubIic of Germany voted against for\n\nreasons not connected with Article 6, a matter that will be further dealt\n\nwith below (see idru, para. 73) (United Nations Conferenceon theLaw of\n\nthe Sea, Vol.II,p. 57).\n\nWavingthus voted against the adoption of the Convention on the Continental\n\nShelf, the Federal Republic of Gerrnany nevertheless signed the Convention\n\nl Under this amendmentArticle6 would read as folIows:\n\n\"1.Where a continental shelf is adjacent to the territories ofor more\n\nStateswhosecoastsare oppositeto each,other,the boundary of the continental\n\nshelf appertaining to such States shall be determined by agreement between\n\nthern orby other meansrecognizedin internationallaw.\n\n\"2. Where the same continental shelf isadjacent to the territoriestwo\n\nadjacent States, the boundary of the continental shelf shall be determinedin\n\nthe manner prescribedin paragraph 1 of this Article,\"on 30 October 1958-which was the Iast day but one on which it was open\n\nfor signature-making a reservation only in respect of Article 5 on fishing\n\nrights.\n\n22. When replying to the Netherlands Note Verbale of 21 June 1963 (see\n\nsupra, para. 16), the German Federal Government confirrned its intention to\n\nratify the Geneva Convention on the Continental SheIf. As the reply of the\n\nGerman Federal Government, contained in a Note Verbale dated 26 August\n\n1963, has not been reproduced in the Memorial of the Federal Republic, the\n\ntext and a translation of that reply are annexed tthepresent Counter-Mernorial\n\n(Annex 9). The significant passage in this connection reads:\n\n\"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (at Bonn) has the honour also to\n\ninform the Netherlands Embassy that the Federal Governrnent, too, is\n\npreparing forthe ratification of the Convention on the Continental Shelf.\"\n\n(Translation; words between brackets added.)\n\n23. About the turn of the year 1963-1964,it was reported in the press that\n\nan American oil Company had announced its plans to cany out drillings off\n\nthe German territorial sea. It would have been no more than a natural reaction\n\non the part of the Federal Republic of Germany to take adequate measures to\n\nprotect its national interests, and this, apparently, was what prompted it to\n\nissue the Government Proclamation of 20 January 1964.\n\n24. Only fragments of the text of this Proclamation appear in the German\n\nMemorial. In view of the relevance of this document, the full text has been\n\nreproduced as Annex 10.\n\nAs will be seen, the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany States\n\nin this Proclamation :\n\n(1) that \"the Federal Government will shortly submit to the Legislature an\n\nAccessionBill on this Convention\" with a view toGerman ratification;\n\n(2) that it deems exploration and exploitation of the seabed and subsoil to be\n\nthe sovereign right of the Federal Republic, and that tl~isright is based on\n\n\"the development of general international law as expressed in recent State\n\npractice and, in particular, in the signing of the Geneva Convention on the\n\nContinental Shelf \".\n\n25. No accession billwas, however, presented to the Legislature by the\n\nFederal Government. On 15 May 1964a Bill was submitted with a viewonly\n\nto establishing a statute relating to the activity in the German shelf area.\n\nBut, in the motivation to the Bill (Annex 1l), the Federal Governrnent stated\n\nthat the statute was to be \"the municipal supplement to the effects of the\n\nProclamation in the field ofinternational law\". It will further be seen from the\n\ntext that once again the Federal Government of Germany acknowledges the\n\nGeneva Convention as an expression of customary international law.\n\n26. The Parliament (\"Bundestag\") of the FederaI Republic of Germany\n\nresponded favourably to the Government Bill, adopting it unanimously at the\n\nthird reading on 24 June 1964. In its report as well as in its recommendation,\n\nthe Parliamentary Cornmittee concemed advocated an early German ratifica-\n\ntion of the Geneva Convention, and this recommendation was endorsed by\n\nParliament.\n\n27. Why, then, was the ratification of the Convention never carried out by\n\nthe Federal Republic of Germany? The Governrnent announced it in its Note\n\nVerbale to the Netherlands Government and advocated it jn its Proclamation,\n\nand Parliament recommended it. But the Federal Republic never proceeded320 NORTH SEA CONTINENTAL SHELF\n\nto ratificatioand when the Nethedands-Germanand theDanish-German\n\nagreements on delimitationof the continental shin thNorth Sea nearthe\n\ncoast were placed before Parliamentin December 1964 and October 1965\n\nrespectively, no referencwhatsoever was made to ratifying the Geneva\n\nConvention. COUNTER-MEMORVL OF THE NETHERLANDS\n\nTHE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE PARTIES TO THE DISPUTE\n\nRELATINGTO THE DELIMITATION OF THE CONTINENTAL SHELF\n\nBENEATH THE NORTH SEA\n\nSection A. BilateraiNegotiations\n\n28. To the Netherlands Note Verbale of 21 June 1963, mentioned at the\n\nend of Chapter 2 (sesupra,para. 16),the Government of the Federal Republic\n\nof Germany replied in a Note Verbale dated 26 August 1963,claiming that-\n\n\"sowohl historische Gründe als auch weitere besondere Umstande eine in\n\nmehrfacher Hinsicht von der Auffassung der Koniglich Niederlandischen\n\nRegierung abweichende Grenzziehung rechtfertigen\".\n\n(Translation: \"there are historical reasons and other special circurnstances\n\nthat justify adoption of a delimitation line, the position of which differs\n\nin more than one respect from that claimed by the Royal Netherlands\n\nGovernment.\") (Fu11text and translation in Annexes 9 and 9 A to this\n\nCounter-Memorial.)\n\n29. In this connection mention should bemade of the specialsituation which\n\nexists in the Mouth of the Ems in respect of the boundary-in the itaternaand\n\nterritorial waters-between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Federal\n\nRepublic of Germany. The course of the international frontier in this area has\n\nbeen disputed for centuries. On 8 April 1960 the two States concluded the\n\nEms-Dollard Treaty lthe purpose of which was to eliminate a11questions that\n\nexisted or might arise on account of the absence of an agreed frontier.Article 46,\n\nparagraph 1, of this Treaty provides:\n\n\"The provisions of this Treaty shall not affect the question of the\n\ninternational frontier in the Ems Estuary. Each Contracting Party reserves\n\nits legal position in this respect.\" (Translation by the United Nations\n\nSecretariat.)\n\nWhen it appeared that the subsoil of the Ems Estuary might contain mineral\n\nresources, the two States concluded on 14 May 1962 a Supplementary Agree-\n\nment in order to provide for the regulation of this question too, again without\n\nfixin tge course of the international frontier. The text and a translation of the\n\nSupplementary Agreement are reproduced as Annexes 16 and 16 A of the\n\nMernorial of the German Federal Government.\n\nThis special situation in the Ems Estuary and its particular effect upon the\n\ndelimitation of the parts of the adjacent continental shelf appertaining to the\n\none and the other State, are cfearly demonstrated by the chart reproduced on\n\npage 100, supra, of the Memorial. The shading on the southern part of the chart\n\nindicates the area where, failinan agreed frontier, conventional rules onCO-\n\noperation between the Parties are applicable.\n\nAs there is no agreed frontier between thg Parties in this area, there is in\n\nconsequence no agreed point of intersection of such a frontier with the outer\n\nlimits of the territorial sea, i.e.,no starting point for the delimitation of the parts\n\nof the continental shelf appertaining to the one and the other State.\n\nl Text printed in UnitedNations Treaty SerieVol. 509.322 NORTH SEA CONTINENTAL SHELF\n\n30. Following the exchange of the Notes Verbales of 21June and 26 August\n\n1963, bilateral discussions took place between representatives ofthe Kingdom\n\nof the Netherlands and representatives of the Federal Republic of Germany on\n\n3 and 4 March 1964.During these discussions iternergedfor the fiwt tirnethat\n\nthe Federal Republic of Germany not only disagreed with the Kingdom of the\n\nNetherlands in respect of the point on the outer limit of the territorial waters\n\nfrom whichthe boundary line onthe continental shelfshould bedrawn (puncturn\n\na quo) but also in respect of the method of determining that boundary line.\n\nIn the course of the same discussions, the representatives of the Kingdom of\n\nthe Netherlands declared with regard to the method of determining the bound-\n\nary line that, sinceArticle 6 of the Geneva Convention was to be regarded as an\n\nexpression of existingrules of international law, they were not in a position to\n\nnegotiate a contractual arrangement determining a boundary line which would\n\nnot be based on the equidistance principle. Accordingly,further discussionsand,\n\nlater on, negotiations were conducted on the subject of the punctum a quo and\n\nthese eventually resulted in the initialling, on 4 August 1964, of the text of the\n\nTreaty concerning the lateral delimitation of the continental shelf near the\n\nCoast l.As stated in the Joint Minutes of that date2,this Treaty was based on\n\nArticle 6 of the Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf and took into\n\naccount the \"special circumstances\" prevailing in the Mouth of the Ems. As\n\nstated in the Memorial, paragraph 16 (p. 21, srrpra),the partial boundary line\n\nagreed upon does in fact follow between the last three seaward points the\n\nequidistance line and deviates from the equidistance line only as regards the\n\npoints nearer to the coast-line where the disputed frontier in the territorial sea\n\ncomes into question.\n\nSection B. TripartiteNegotiations\n\n31. Only after these bilateral talks and the conclusion of the bilateral Treaty\n\nof 1 December 1964, did tripartite talks take place, at the instigation of the\n\nFederal Republic of Germany, between representatives of Denmark, of the\n\nFederal Republic and of the Netherlands, The firstroundtook place on 28 Feb-\n\nruary 1966in The Hague. Second and third rounds of tripartite talks were held\n\nin Bonn and Copenhagen in May and August 1966 respectively. Since the\n\nNetherlands delegation stated at the beginning of these talks that its Iegal\n\nstandpoint was still the same as that recorded at the end of the bilateral dis-\n\ncussions(Joint Minutes of 4 August 19154~),the negotiations were concerned\n\nwith finding a method for the settling of the dispute. They resulted eventually\n\nin the initialling, 1nAugust 2966in Copenhagen, of the two bilateral Special\n\nAgreements andthe tripartite Protocol, whichwere,after signature, transmitted\n\nto the Court in February 1967.\n\nTreaty signed on 1 December 1964; Annexes 3 and 3 A of the Memorial,\n\npp. 98-101, supra.\n\nAnnexes 4 and 4 A of theMemorial, pp. 102-104, supra. COUNTER-MEMORIAL OF THE NETHERLANDS\n\nPART II. THE LAW\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nTHE QUESTION SUBMITTED TO THE COURT\n\n32. The question which, under the terms of the Compromis (the \"Special\n\nAgreement\" of 2 February 1967),the Court is called upon to decide is:\n\n\"what principles and rules of international law are applicable to the\n\ndelimitation as between the Parties of the areas of the continental shelf in\n\nthe North Sea which appertain to each of them beyond the partial bound-\n\nary determined by the (Netherlands-Geman) Convention of 1 December\n\n1964\".\n\nThe Federal Republic, in its Subrnissions and in Part II of the Mernorial,\n\nasks the Court in eKectto declare that the only applicable pnnciple or rule of\n\nlaw is an alleged principle that each coastal State is entitled to ajust and equi-\n\ntable share; and that neither the equidistance method nor any other methodis\n\na fit and proper method of delimitation in any circumstances, unless it is\n\nestablished by agreement, arbitration or otherwise that the particular method\n\nwill \"achieve ajust and equitable apportionment arnong the States concerned\".\n\n33. The claim thus formulated by the Federal Republic seemsto the Nether-\n\nlands Government to be nothing less than a request to the Court to Iay down\n\nthat, as between the Netherlands and the Federal Republic, the delimitation of\n\nthe continental shelf in the North Sea should be settled ex aequo et bono.\n\nWithout a framework of legalcriteria to determine what is \"just and equitable\",\n\nthe concept of a \"just and equitable apportionment\" lacks any legal content.\n\nIndeed, as the very terms of the Compromis show, it was precisely in order to\n\nobtain the Court's directions regarding the applicable framework of legal\n\ncriteria that the Netherlands and the Federal Republic have submitted the\n\ndispute to the Court. Accordingly,the claimformulated by the FederalRepublic\n\nappears to the Netherlands Government not to fa11within the terms of the\n\nquestion put to the Court in the Compromis.\n\n34. In any event, the thesis put forward by the Federal Republic reflects a\n\nconcept of the coastal State's rights in the continental shelf which has no basis\n\neither in the terms of the Compromis or in the applicable rules of international\n\nlaw.\n\n35. The Compromis doesnot request the Court to decidewhat principlesand\n\nrulesof international lawshouldgovem the sharingoufbetweenthe Netherlands\n\nand the Federal Republic of areas of the continental shelf in the North Sea.\n\nTt requests the Court to decide the principles and rules applicable to the\n\ndelimitation as berween the Nerherlands and the Fedcral RepubEicof the areas\n\nof the continental shelf in the North Sea whichappertain ro each of thenabeyond\n\nthepartial boundary olreadyfixed bythe1964 Treaty I.short, the question put\n\nto the Court in the Compromis concerns the principles and rules applicable for\n\ncompleting the delimitation of the boundary running between the areas of\n\ncontinental shelf which appertaiir to each of two adjacent coastal States.\n\n36. The manner inwhich the question for the Court's decision is framed in\n\nthe Compromis also corresponds to the way in which the question of delimita-\n\ntion presents itself in State practice, in the propofathe International Law324 NORTH SEA CONTINENTAL SHELF\n\nCommission and in the provisions of the1Geneva Convention of 1958on the\n\nContinental Shelf.\n\n37. Al1the pre-1958 texts of Proclamations or Decreesgivenin paragraph 31\n\n(p.31,supra) of the Memorial viewthe question as one of boundary delimitation\n\nin accordancewith equitable principles. The proposals of the International Law\n\nCommission in both paragraphs of Article 72 of the draft submitted by it to\n\nthe General Assembly were also framed entirely as rules for delimiting the\n\nboundariesof the areas of coniinentalshelfoppertaining fo coastal States (Year-\n\nbook of theInternationalLaw Commission,1956,Vol.II, p. 300).Article 6 of the\n\nGeneva Convention on the Continental Shelf, which reproduces the Commis-\n\nsion's textsalmost word for word, is similarly couched entirely in terrns of the\n\ndelimitation of continental shelf boundaries. Thus, the text of Article6reads:\n\n\"1. Where the sarne continental shelf is adjacent to the territories of\n\ntwo or more States whose coasts are opposite each other, the boundaryof\n\nthe continentalshev apperrainingto such States shall be determined by\n\nagreement betweenthem. In the absence of agreement, and unless another\n\nboundary line is justified by special circumstances, the boundary is the\n\nmedianline,every point of which is equidistant from the nearest points of\n\nthe baselines from which the breadth of the territorial seof each State is\n\nmeasured.\n\n2. Where the same continental shelf is adjacent to the territories of two\n\nadjacent States, the boundaryof the continental shev shall be determined\n\nby agreement between them. In the absence of agreement, and unless\n\n, another boundary line is justified by special circumstances, the boundary\n\nshall be deterrninedby application of theprinciple of equidistaitcefrom the\n\nnearest points of the baselinesfrom which the breadth of the territorial sea\n\nof each State is measured.\n\n3. In delimiting the boundaries of the continental shelf, any lines which\n\nare drawn in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs 1and 2\n\nof this article should be defined with referenceto charts and geographical\n\nfeatures as they exist at a particular date, and reference should be made to\n\nfixed permanent identifiable points on the land.\" (Italics added).\n\n38. The same is true of the State practice after the 1958Geneva Conference,\n\nand especially that relating to the North Sea itself, as clearly appears frorn the\n\nterrns of the unilateral acts and bilateral agreements cited in Chapter II of\n\nPart 1of the Memorial. Thus, the Norwegian Proclamation and Decree, of\n\n1963, speak of Norway's submarine areas having a boundarymidway between\n\nNorway and other countries. The Danish Decree and Note Verbale, both also\n\nof 1963,echoing the language of the Convention, speak in terrns of boundary\n\ndelimifation. The Federal Republic's own Proclamation of 20 January 1964\n\n(Counter-Memorial, Annex 10) speaks of the delimitation of the German part\n\nof the continental shelfin relation to the parts of the continental shelfof foreign\n\nStates. The United Kingdom's Continental Shelf (Designation of Areas)\n\nOrder of the same year refers to certain areas as subject to the exercise of its\n\ncontinental shelf rights \"pending agreement with other Powers on the bound-\n\naries of thecontinentalshelfappcrrainingto ~heUnitedKingdom\".As to Belgium,\n\nits Billof 23October 1967speaksin Article 2 of the delimitation of the Belgian\n\ncontinental shelf (Counter-Mernorial, Annex 14, p. 388,below).\n\nLastly the Netherlands, in its Note Verbale of 21 June 1963 (Counter-\n\nMemorial, Annex 8),notified the Federal Rtpublic that thepart of the conti-\n\nnentalshelfof theNorrhSea over whichrheNerherlandsexercises sovereignrights\n\nin conformity with the Convention- COUNTER-MEMORIAL OF THE NETHERLANDS 325\n\n\"is defimitedto the east by the equidistance line beginning at the point\n\nwhere the thalweg in the mouth of the Ems reaches the territorial waters\".\n\n(Italics added.)\n\n39. Particularly striking is the fact that al1the bilateral agreements hitherto\n\nconcluded between North Sea Powers are expressed as delimitationsof bound-\n\naries between the parts of the continental shelf appertaining to the respective\n\ncountries, not as agreements for sharingour the continental shelf. Thus, the\n\nUnitedKingdom-NorwayAgreementof 10 March 1965(Memorial, Annex 5)\n\nhas a preamble which proclaims that the two States-\n\n\"Desiring to establish theboundarybetweenthe respective portsof the\n\ncontinentalsheif\n\nHave agreed as follows.\" (Italics added.)\n\nAnd then the operative clause of Article 1 of the Agreement reads-\n\n\"The dividing linebetween thatpart ofthe continentalshelfwhichapper-\n\ntains to the UnitedKingdonaof Great Britain and Northern Ireland and\n\nfhatpart whichappertainsfo the Kingdomof Norway shall bebased .. .\",\n\netc. (Italics added.)\n\nThe sameforms of preamble and operative clauseappear alsointhe Nerherlands-\n\nUnitedKingdomAgreementof 6 October 1965(Memorial,Annex 9). Similarly,\n\nthe Denrnark-United KingdomAgreementof 3 March 1966(Memorial, Annex 12)\n\nhas apreamble in the tems that the two States-\n\n\"Have decided to establish their common boundary between the parts\n\nof the continental shelf overwhich the United Kingdom of Great Britain\n\nand Northern Ireland and the Kingdom of Denmark respectively exer-\n\ncise sovereign rights for the purpose of the exploration and exploitation of\n\nthe natural resources of the continental shelf,\"\n\nAnd the operative clause of Article 1 of the Agreement then takes the same\n\nform as in the United Kingdom-Norway and the Netherlands-United Kingdom\n\nAgreements. The Denmark-NorwayAgreementof 8 December 1965(Memorial,\n\nAnnex 11A)hasa preamble and operative clausewhich,ifthewording isslightly\n\ndifferent, are inspired by preciselythe same conceof the purpose and effectof\n\nthe Agreement.\n\n40. The Treaties of the Federal Republic itself with the Netherlands of\n\n1 December 1964(Memorial, Annex 3 A) and with Denmark of 9 June 1965\n\n(Memorial, Annex 6 A) for the delimitation of the continental shelf near the\n\nCoastare equalfy expressed in terms of the partial delimitation of the boundory\n\nof the continentalshelfodjacenttothe territoriesof the States concerned,More-\n\nover, eventheJoint Minutes andthe Protocol (Memorial,Annexes4A and 7A)\n\naccornpanyingthoseTreaties and reservingtheposition ofthe Partieswithregard\n\nto thefurther courseofthe boundary recognizedthat the question at issuewasthe\n\ndetermination of the cornmonboundarybetween the respective Parties. True,\n\nthe delegation of the Federal Republic in the Joint Minutes accompanying the\n\nTreaty with the Netherlands announced that the Federal Government was-\n\n\"seeking to bring about a conference of States adjacent to the North Sea\n\nwith a view to arriving at an appropriate division of the continental shelf\n\nsituated in the middle of the North Sea\".\n\nBut it referred to a divisionin accordance withthe firstsentencesofparagraphs 1\n\nand 2 of Article 6 of the Geneva Convention which speak expressly of the\n\ndetermination of the boundary of the continental shelf appertaining to the\n\nStates concerned. Nor did the FederaI Government pursue the idea of a con-\n\nference. On the contrary,inidenticAide-Mémoires of25 May 1966(MemoriaI,326 NORTH SEA CONTINENTAL SHELF\n\nAnnex 15A) addressed sirnultaneousIyto the Netherlands and Danish Govern-\n\nments concerning their Agreement for the delimitation of their respective parts\n\nof the North Sea, the Federal Republic contented itself with underlining that\n\nthe arrangement made in that Agreement-\n\n\"cannot have any effecton the question of the delimitafionof the German-\n\nNetherlands or the German-Danish parts of the continental sheIf in the\n\nNorth Sea\" (italics added).\n\nFurthermore, in its two identic Aide-Mémoires of12July 1966, addressed by\n\nthe Embassy of the Federal Republic to the United'Kingdom Government with\n\nreference to the conclusion of the United Kingdom-Netherlands and the\n\nUnited Kingdom-Denmark Agreements for the delimitation of the continental\n\nshelf, the Federal Government reserved its position expressly in terms of the\n\ndelimitation of its boundaries with the Netherlands and Denmark (Memorial,\n\nAnnexes 10 A and 13A):\n\n\"the Federal Government wishes to point out to the British Government\n\nthat the final setrlement of the question of the lateral deiimitation the\n\ncontinentalshelfintheNorth Seabetweenthe Federal Republic ofGermany,\n\nthe Kingdom of Denmark and the Kingdom of the Netherlands is still\n\noutstanding. The Federal Government would morcover bring the Aide-\n\nmémoireof 25th May 1966, a copy of which is attached, to the attention\n\nof the British Government andwould add that the arrangement made in\n\nthe aforementioned Agreementcannot prejudice thequestionof thedelimita-\n\nrionof the continentalsheifbetween theFederaIRepublicof Germanyandthe\n\nNetherlands (De~zrnark)in the eastern part of the North Sea\" (italics\n\nadded).\n\n41. Lastly, it is noteworthy that in the Protocol of 9 June 1965 on the\n\ndeiimitation of the continental shelf in the Baltic Sea the Federal Republic\n\ntogether with Denmark again dealt with the question purely and simply as one\n\nof the delimitation of baundaries,not of the sharing out of areas between the\n\nlittoral States of that sea (Memorial, Annex 7 A):\n\n\"With respect to the continental shelf adjacent to the coasts of the\n\nBaltic Sea which are opposite each other, it isagreed that the boundary\n\nshall bethe median line. Accordingly, both Contracting Parties declare\n\nthat they will raiseno basic objections to the other Contracting Party's\n\ndelitnitingitsparof thecontinentalsheyof the Baltic Sea on the basis of the\n\nmedian line.\" (Italics added.)\n\n42. Accordingly, the practice of States-in their unilateral acts, their bilateral\n\nagreements and in the Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf-affords\n\nno support whatever for the conclusion which the Federal Republic seeks to\n\ndraw from it in paragraph 38of its Memorial (p. 36, supra):\n\n\"Where the same continental shelf is adjacent to the territories of\n\nseveral States, each of these States is entittedatjust and equitable share\n\nof thutcontinentalshelf,irrespectiveof themethodusedfor thedetermirration\n\nof the boundurksbetween the States concerned.\"\n\nOn the contrary, that conclusion isin direct contradiction both with the existing\n\npractice of a large number of States and with the rules adopted in the Geneva\n\nConvention on the Continental Shelf.\n\n43. Nor is the Federal Republic's thesis made any more compatible with\n\nState practice or with the Geneva Convention by framing it in the truncated\n\nform in which it appears in the Federal Government's first Submission (p. 91,\n\nsupra) : COUNTER-MEMORIALOF THE NETHERLANDS 327\n\n\"The delimitation of the continental shelf between the Parties in the\n\nNorth Sea is governed by the principle that each coastal State is entitled\n\nto a just and equitable share.\"(Italics added.)\n\nThis proposition startsfrom theinadmissible basis of sharingoutrhecontine~tal\n\nshewlike a cake instead of from the basis of determining, as between opposite\n\nor adjacent States, what are the boundaries of the areas of continental shelf\n\nappurtenant to the coasts of each State and delimitingtheboundary accordingly.\n\nWhen the FederaI Republic states in paragraph 30 of the MemoriaI (p. 30,\n\nsupra)that-\n\n\"if,by virtue of their geographic position, two or more coastal States\n\ncan claim that a continental shelf 'appertains' to each of them, the neces-\n\nsity arises of apportioning that common continental shelf between them\"\n\nthis is amanifest misrepresentation of the legal situation under positive inter-\n\nnational law. In the first place, this statement confuses thegeoiogicoi concept\n\nof the continental shelf with the entirely different legal concept of sovereign\n\nrights of a State over the continental shelf. There are, perhaps, reasons for\n\nconsidering a continental shelf as a\"unit\" from the geological point of view,\n\nThere is, however, no more reason to regard that geological unit as a legal\n\nentity than there isto consider the \"continent of Europe\" or the \"low countries\"\n\nas such. From the legal point of viewthe continental shelf, like land, sea and\n\nair, is primarily \"space\" wherein activities take place and objects are found,\n\nand space is a priori susceptible to any limitation or division. Secondly, the\n\nmere fact that two or more States each lay a daim (or even \"can\"lay a claim)\n\nto the samespace doesnot make that spacecornmonspaceto be dividedbetween\n\nthem. Indeed the normal legal situation in respect of, for instance, a disputed\n\nterritory is not that the territory is divided but that the better claim prevails.\n\nNor have any of the other North SeaStates sought to treat the continental shelf\n\nbeneath that sea as legallya unity. On the contrary, every singleone of them-\n\nwith the exception of the Federal Republic of Germany-has demonstrably\n\nregarded its claim as limited to that part of the continental shelf every point\n\nof which is nearer to its Coastthan to that of any other State.\n\nEqually, the reference in paragraph 35 of the MemoriaI to the use of the\n\nwaters of international rivers is entirely beside the point. The rkgime for the\n\nutilization of the waters of international rivers is a quite different question\n\nwhich does not concem the delimitation of boundaries.\n\n44. No doubt, when the determination of the boundaries of the areas of\n\ncontinental shelf appertaining to each coastal State has been made, the result\n\nmay be spoken of as constituting an \"apportionment\" of the continental shelf\n\namong the States concemed or as a determination of their \"shares\". But there\n\nis a fundamental difference between a principle which starts from the basis\n\nthat the continental shelf is the cornmon property of the littoral States, each\n\nof whorn is entitled to an \"equitable and just share\"of the common property,\n\nand one which starts from the basis that each littoral State is entitled to the\n\nareas which appertain to its territory and that the boundaries betweenthese\n\nappurtenantareas are to be delimited on equitable principles. If these two\n\nprinciples may not always have been clearly distinguished by some writers,\n\nthere can be no doubt that it is the latter principle which is found in State\n\npractice and expressed in the Geneva Convention, not the principle formulated\n\nin the Federal Government's first Submission.\n\n45. Furthermore, the Federal Republic's submission that the defimita-\n\ntion of the continental shelf in the North Sea as between the Netherlands and\n\nthe Federal RepubIic should be govemed by the principle that each coastal3 28 NORTH SEA CONTINENTALSHELF\n\nState is entitIed to a just and equitable share, is one which by its very nature\n\ncannot givean adequate answer to the question put to the Court in the Com-\n\npromis. In the first place, a delimitation of the boundary as betweenthe Nether-\n\nlands and the Federal Republic would not by itself determine the total area\n\nappertaining to either or both of them, since the total area of each would\n\nbe dependent upon their other boundary lines with third States not par-\n\nties to the present dispute. In the second place, and consequently, the\n\nquestion whether such a delimitation would produce a \"just and equitable\n\nshare\" for the Netherlands and the Federal Republic wouldnecessarilyalso\n\nbe dependenton thedelimitationof theirboundarieswith thirdStates. Thus, the\n\nalleged principle formulated by the Federai Republic simpiy cannot constitute\n\na pnnciple or rule of international .law applicable to the delimitation of the\n\ncontinental shelf boundary as between the Partiesro the Compromis.\n\n46. If there were such a principle or rule of positive international law, it\n\nwould follow logically that the delimitation of the continental shelf of each\n\nand every North Sea coastal State could be effectedonly through a multilateral\n\nagreement concluded between al1of thern. The Federal Republic did, indeed,\n\nat one stage in the negotiations speak of an intention to convene a multilateral\n\n\"conference of States adjacent to the North Sea with a view to arriving at an\n\nappropriate division of the continental shelf situated in the middle of the\n\nNorth Sea\" (Joint Minutes of4August 1964,Mernorial,Annex 4A, penultirnate\n\nparagraph). But it made no effort to carry the matter further. No doubt, this\n\nwas because the Federal Government soon came to realize that not only the\n\nNetherlands but al the States concerned would autornatically demand the\n\napplication of Article 6 of the Geneva Convention and that the only result of\n\nsuch a conference must be the delimitation of the North Sea continental shelf\n\nin accordance with the equidistance principle. Atany rate, it never adverted to\n\nthe idea of a multilateral conference again.\n\n47. Now, however, the Federal Government shifts its ground and demands\n\nthat the boundary between the Netherlands and itself should bedetermined\n\nbilaterally in isolation from the other North Sea States but in such a way as to\n\nprovide the Federal Republic witha shareof thetotal continental shelfbeneath\n\nthe NorthSea that it considers \"just and equitable\". In short, the Federal Re-\n\npublic now seeks to put the burden of providing for itself what it considers a\n\njust and equitable share of the North Sea.shelf not on all, but on one or at\n\nmost two of the North Sea States. The very nature of this demand, in the view\n\nof the Netherlands, is incompatibIe with the existenceof the supposed principle\n\nwhich the Federal Republic invokes.\n\n48. On this point, there is a certain consistency in the position taken up by\n\nthe Federal Republic. Prior to the Geneva Convention it advocated that the\n\ncontinental shelf outside territorial waters should be regarded as common to\n\nal1States and should be exploited in the interests of all. That concept of the\n\ncontinental shelf was, however, in total conflict with the practice of States and\n\nwas completely and finally rejected at the Geneva Conference of 1958. The\n\npnnciple formulated in the Federal Republic's first Submission seemsto be\n\nessentiallya relic of that very \"community\" concept of the continental shelf\n\nwhich the Federal Govemment has itself now abandoned. Be that as it may,\n\nthe principle is certainly in conflict with the practice of States and with the\n\nconcept of the continental shelf which was adopted in the Geneva Conven-\n\ntion and animates the provisions of Article 6 concerning the delimitation of\n\nboundanes of the conthenta1 shelf.\n\n49. If iisnecessary to Iook for the general concept underlying the modem COUNTER-MEMORIAL OF THE NETHERLANDS 329\n\nlaw regarding the delimitation of continentaI shelf boundaries, this is that\n\neach State has ipsojure sovereign and exclusive rights of exploration and\n\nexploitation over the areas of continental shea&cent to its coast and that,\n\nin the case of two States fronting upon the same continental shelf, the areas\n\nwhich are to be considered as appertaining to one or to the other are tobe\n\ndelimited on equitable principles. However, State practice and the Geneva\n\nConvention have translated this general concept into the more concrete criteria\n\nfor the delimitation of continental shelf boundaries which are examined in the\n\nnext Chapters of this Counter-Memonal. In the view of the Netherlands\n\nGovernment, it is in these more concrete criteria that the answer to the ques-\n\ntion put to the Court in the Compromis has to be found. NORTH SEA CONnNENTAL SHELF\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nTHE PRINCIPLE THAT A DELlMITATION OF A MARITIME AREA\n\nIN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY RECOGNIZED RULES OF\n\nINTERNATIONAL LAW IS PRIMA FACIE VALID AND OPPOSABLE\n\nTO OTHER STATES\n\n50. The Federal Republic, as pointed out in the previous Chapter, asks the\n\nCourt in its submissions to recognize only one alleged principle of law as\n\ngoverning the delirnitation of the continental shelf between the Parties in the\n\nNorth Sea, namely the principle that \"each coastal State is entitled to a just\n\nand equitable share\". By way of clearing the ground for its alleged principle of\n\nlaw, however, the Federal Republic also asks the Court expressly to deny the\n\nstatus of a rule of customary law to the \"equidistance\" principle-the principle\n\napplied by the Netherlands and Denmark as wellas by other North Sea States\n\nin the delirnitatiooftheir respectivecontinental shelfboundaries. The Federal\n\nRepublic's second Submission reads :\n\n\"The method of determining boundaries of the continental shelf in\n\nsuch a way that every point of the boundary is equidistant from the\n\nnearest points of the baselines frorn which the breadth of the territorial\n\nsea of each state is measured (equidistance method), is notP rule of cus-\n\ntomary internationat law and is therefore not applicable as such be-\n\ntween the Parties l.\"\n\nThis Submission has ta be read in the light of the Federal Republic's dis-\n\ncussion of the equidistance line in Chapter II of Part II of the Mernorial where,\n\nafter dealing with the genesis of the equidistance method and its introduction\n\ninto Article 6 of the Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf, the Federal\n\nGovernment asserts:\n\n\"Thus Article 6 is not a codification of already existing international\n\nlaw,but it is theoutcomeof an effort to developthe existinglegalsituation,\n\nwith its demand for an equitable solution, by the establishment of a\n\nmethod which it was assumed would, under normal geographical condi-\n\ntions,lead to an equitable and just .apportionment of the continental\n\nshelf between the States concerned, Article 6 must be interpreted in this\n\nsense, with the consequence that an equidistance boundary rnay not be\n\nimposed upona Stafe ivhichIiasnot accededtu the Conventiolz, so long as it\n\nhas not been proved that it would be the best method of apportioning\n\nthe continental shelf between the adjacent States in a just and equitable\n\nmanner, having regard to the specialgeographicalsituation of the individual\n\ncase 2.\"(Ttalicsadded.)\n\n51. The Federal Government's contentions regarding the status of the\n\nequidistance method are believed by the Netherlands to be based on a miscon-\n\nception no less fundamental than that which underiies its first Submission.\n\nIn the present instance the fundamental misconception concerns the position\n\nof theParties in relation to the principles and rules of law expressed in the\n\nGeneva Convention.\n\nlP. 91, supra, of the Memorial.\n\nPara. 53 (p. 57supra) ofthe Memorial. COUNTER-MEMORIAL OF THE NETHERLANDS 331\n\n52. The Court itself, in itsjudgment in the Fisheriescase (Z.C.J. Reports1951,\n\np. 116)has stated authoritatively the position of a coastal State with regard to\n\nthe delimitation of sea areas (at p. 132):\n\n\"The delimitation of sea areas has always an international aspect; it\n\ncannot be dependent merelyupon the will of thecoastal State as expressed\n\nin its municipal law. Although it is true that the acr of delimitotion is\n\nnecessarilya unilaferalacr, because anly the coastal State iscompetent to\n\nundertake it, the validity of the delimirationwifh regard tu other States\n\ndependsuponinternationallaw.\" (Italics added.)\n\nThe Court did not in that passage Saythat the vaIidity of a delimitation by\n\na coastal State vis-A-visanother State depends on the will of that other State.\n\nIt said that the validity of the delimitation with regarto other States depends\n\nuponinternationalIaw.\n\n53. The situation in the present case is that, exercising the cornpetence\n\nwhich they have under their respective systems of municipal law,the Nether-\n\nlands and Danish Governments, by unilateral acts and by bilateral agreements\n\nconcluded both between themselves and separately with other North Sea\n\ncoastal States, have delimited the boundaries of the areas which they believe\n\nproperly to appertain to their respective coasts under the principles and rules\n\nof delimitation generally recognized by States. In doing so they have sought\n\nto base their delimitations directly on the principles and rules adopted by a\n\nvery large number of States at the Geneva Conference of 1958and embodied\n\nin Article 6 of the Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf, In short,\n\nthe Netherlands and Denmark having detimited their continental shelf bound-\n\naries specifically on the basis of generally recognized principles and rules of\n\nlaw, these delimitations are prima facie not contrary to internationa1 law and\n\nare valid with regard to other States. Accordingly, if the Federal Republic\n\nconsiders that the delimitations are invalid, the onus is on it to show why the\n\nNetherlands or Denmark shouId not be entitled to apply the generally re-\n\ncognized principles and rules of delimitation in delimiting their respective\n\ncontinental shelf boundaries. In the present case it is not a question of the\n\nNetherlands or Denmark seekingto imposea principle or rule upon the Federal\n\nRepublic; it is rather aquestion of the Federal Republic's seeking to prevent\n\nthe Netherlands and Denmark from applying in the delimitation of their\n\ncontinental shelf boundaries the principles and rules of international law\n\ngenerally recognized by States. Neither the Netherlands nor Denmark has\n\nentered into any international engagement or otherwise placed itself under\n\nany international obligation vis-à-vis the FederaI Republic which might\n\npreclude either State from delimiting its maritime areas in accordance with\n\nthe generaliy recognized principlesand rules of international law. NORTH SEACONïiNENTAL SHELF\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nTHE STATUS OF THE PRINCIPLES EMBODIED IN ARTICLE 6 OF\n\nTHE CONVENTION ON THE CONTINENTAL SHELF AS GENERAL\n\nRULES OF LAW\n\n54. The Federal Republic's principal contention in Chapters 1 and II of\n\nPart II of the Memorial appears to be that,between the Parties to the present\n\ncase, delimitation on the basis ofequidistance isnot to beregarded asa principle\n\nof Iaw but merely as one of several possible methods of deIimitation which\n\nmay corne under consideration in aiming at an \"equitable and just appor-\n\ntionment\". This contention, which seeks to deprive the \"equidistance\" prin-\n\nciple of al1legal force for the purposes of the present case, conflicts with the\n\ngeneral recognition of the equidistance principlas a legal rule by States as\n\nwell as with the attitude adopted towards that principle by the Federal Re-\n\npublic itself othenvise than in the case of the particular boundaries now in\n\ndispute before the Court.\n\n55. In the State practice prior ta the Geneva Conference of 1958 the ten-\n\ndency admittedly was to refer in general terms to the delimitation of continental\n\nshelf boundaries on \"equitable principles\" without mention of the \"equidis-\n\ntance\" principIein particular. But the concept afdelimitation on \"equitable\n\nprinciples\", as already mentioned in Chapter 1 of this Part, was aftenvards\n\nconverted first through the work of the International Law Commission and\n\nthen through the Geneva Conference of 1958into the rules set out in Article 6\n\nof the Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf, which accept the equidis-\n\ntance principle as a rule of law, In addition, as is shown in Section C of this\n\nChapter @p.340,et seq.infra), theequidistance principleadopted in Article 6of\n\nthe Geneva Convention as applicable to the delimitation of the continental\n\nshelfwas a principle whichhad already receivedwide recognition inthe practice\n\nof States in connection with the delimitation of other forms of both maritime\n\nand fresh-water boundaries. Moreover, since then no less than 37 States have\n\nratified or acceded to the Geneva Convention and a number of States have\n\nalready applied the rules contained in Article 6 in their practice. Finally, the\n\nFederal Republic itself, although not yet a party, has not only placed its\n\nsignature on the Convention but has also employed the equidistance principle\n\nin delimiting its continental shelf boundaries with the Nethedands and with\n\nDenmark nearthe coast andagain indelirnitingits continental shelf boundary\n\nwith Denmark in the Baltic.\n\nSection A. The International Law Commission\n\n56. When the International Law Commission first took up the question of\n\ndelimitation in 1950 it is true that, as indicated in paragraph 48 of the Me-\n\nmorial, the discussions showed \"a great deal of uncertainty regarding the way\n\nto solve the problem of delimitation and regarding any rules which rnight be\n\napplied\". But the suggestion which also seems to be made in that paragraph\n\nthat the Commission viewed the matter as a question of apportioni ngconr-\n\nmon area of continental shelf is quite untrue. The question put by the Special\n\nRapporteur to the Commission was (Yearbaok, 1950, Vol. II, p. 31): \"Where\n\nthe continental shelves-or contiguous zones, as the case rnay be-overlap, COWNTER-MEMORIAL OF THE NETHERLANDS 333\n\nhow should they be delimited?\"This question, the record shows, had not yet\n\nbeen gone into very deeplyby members of the Commission, and the discussion\n\nwas of a preliminary character. Indeed, the State practice up to that date was\n\nnot regarded by the Commission as sufficiently consistent to establish any\n\ncustomary rule as already in existence with respect to the continental shelf,\n\nand its whole discussion of the nature and extent of the rights of a coastal\n\nState over the continental shelf was stili somewhat tentative and exploratory.\n\nIt is therefore scarcely surprising that the Commission should not at that\n\nsession have had any very clear ideas about the criteria for delimiting con-\n\ntinental shelf boundaries; or that some members, such as Amado and Hudson,\n\nshould have doubted whether there was any generai principle applicable and\n\nshould have sirnplyfallen back upon \"arbitration\" or \"agreement\".\n\n57. In 1951 the Commission reverted to the problem. The Special Rappor-\n\nteur now proposed that delimitation of continental shelf boundaries should\n\nin the first place be left to the agreement of the parties but that :\n\n\"Faute d'accord, la démarcation entre les plateaux continentaux de\n\ndeux Etats voisins sera constituéepar la prolongation de la ligne séparant\n\nles eaux territoriales et la démarcationentre les plateaux continentaux de\n\ndeux Etats séparéspar la mer sera constituéepar la ligne médianeentre\n\nles deux côtes.\" (Yearbook,1951,Vol. II, at p. 102.)\n\nThe discussion that followed was again somewhat confused: various sug-\n\ngestions were made and it is true that again no majority was obtained for any\n\ngeneral principle of delimitation to determine continental shelf boundaries\n\nbetween \"adjacent\" States. The principle mainly discussed was that of \"pro-\n\nlonging\" the territorial sea boundary. But members of the Commission doubted\n\nwhether any general principlehad yet ben established fordelimitingthe bound-\n\nary between the territorial waters of adjacent States. lndeed, in discussing\n\nthis problem at its 1950and 1951sessionsthe Commission was inthe difficulty\n\nthat it had not yet begun its study of the territorial sea. As a result, 1951ts\n\nReport the Commission could do no more than advocate that the continental\n\nshelf boundary between \"adjacent\" States should be established by \"agree-\n\nment\" and, failing agreement, by compulsory recourse to arbitration ex\n\naequo et bono. On the other hand, in that same report the Commission did\n\nexpress itself in favour of the \"equidistance\" principle-in its median line\n\nform-for \"opposite\"States whose territories are separated by an arm of the\n\nsea. It conceded that in these cases the configuratioof the Coastmight some-\n\ntimes give rise to difficultiesin drawing a median linand recommended that\n\nsuch difficultiesshould be referred to arbitration. But it recognized that the\n\nboundary \"would generally coincide with some median line between the two\n\ntoasts\".\n\n58.The 1953 session of the Commission was a turning-point in the develop-\n\nment of the law regarding the delimitation of continental shelf boundaries. In\n\ncommenting upon the Commission's 1951 Report, numerous governrnents-\n\nand particularly those of some of the smaIler States-had raised strong objec-\n\ntions to the proposal chat disputes concerning the delimitation of continental\n\nshelf boundaries should besettledex aequo etbono; and these governments had\n\nurged the Commission to formulate rules of law as a basis for the settlemenof\n\ndisputes regarding the delimitation of continental shelf boundaries. (Yearbook,\n\n1953, Vol. II, pp. 241-269.) In addition, at the wish of the Commission, a\n\nCommittee of experts had been convened by the Special Rapporteur shortly\n\nbefore the 1953 session to consider technical questions connected with the\n\ndetimitation of the territorial sea. This Committee had presented a report334 NORTH SEA CONTINENTAL SHELF\n\nendorsing the use of the \"median line\" in the case of \"opposite\" States and\n\nrecomrnending that the lateral boundary betweenthe territorial seas of adjacent\n\nStates should be traced according to the \"principle of equidistance\".\n\nFurthermore, in doing so, the Committee had stressed the importance of\n\nfinding \"a formula for drawing the international boundaries in the territorial\n\nwaters of States which could also be used for the delimitation of therespective\n\ncontinental shelvesof two States bordering the same continental shelf '\".True,\n\nthe experts had conceded that the equidistance method might not always give\n\nan equitable result, and that in such a case a solution by negotiation might be\n\nnecessary. But this had not deterred them from coming down firmly in favour\n\nof the equidistance principle as the generally applicable ruie for the continental\n\nshelf as well as for the territorial sea.\n\n59.Accordingly, at the 1953sessionthe Special Rapporteur submitted a new\n\ndraft article (Art. 7 of his draft)provjdingthat:\n\n(1) in the case of opposite States, the boundary shouId be \"the median\n\nline every point of which isequidistant from the two opposite coasts\";\n\n(2) in the case of adjacent States, the boundary \"shouldbe drawn accord-\n\ning to the principleof equidistance from the respective coast-Iines\" ;\n\n(3) disputes regarding the application of these principles should be sub-\n\nmitted to arbitration.\n\nParagraph 3 was eliminated from this article by reason of the inclusion of a\n\ngeneral provision for arbitration applying to al1the articles. As to paragraphs 1\n\nand 2, their essentialprinciple-an equidistance boundary-was accepted by the\n\nCommission. But these paragraphs were amended so as: (1) to make the\n\napplication of the equidistance principle subject to any agreement concluded\n\nbetween the States concerned; (2) to allow for cases where \"special circum-\n\nstances\" justify another boundary; and (3) to definemore preciselythe \"coast\"\n\nfrom which the equidistance line should be measured bysubstituting \"the base-\n\nlines from which the width of the territoria1 sea of each country is measured\".\n\n60. The Federal RepubIic in paragraph 32of the Memorial seeksto interpret\n\nthe proceedings of the Commission as showing that the equidistance method\n\nwassuggestedbythe Rapporteur and acceptedby the Commissionasasubsidiary\n\nrule; and also that the Commission regarded the question essentially as one of\n\nequitable apportionment rather than of determining boundaries. Indeed, in\n\nparagraph 50 it gives the impression that the Commission's acceptance of the\n\nequidistance principle at the 1953 session was very half-hearted. These inter-\n\npretations of the Commission's attitude are, however, in plain contradiction\n\nwith the Commission's ownexplanations of its views in paragraphs 81-85 of\n\nits Report to the General AssembIy(Yearbook, 1953,Vol. II, p. 216).\n\n61. The Commission's commentas. begins as follows:\n\n\"Inthematter ofthedelimitarionoffheboundariesof the continentalsheff\n\nthe Commission was in the position to derive some guidance from pro-\n\nposals made by the committee of experts on the delimitation of territoria1\n\nwaters. ..\" (Ttalicsadded.)\n\nAnd throughout the remaining paragraphs the Commentary speaks. not of\n\napportionment, but of the delimitation of boundaries. Then, in paragraph 82,\n\nthe Commission expressly designates the \"principle of equidistance\" as the\n\n\"generalrule\" and as the \"majorprinciple\":\n\n\"Having regard to the conclusions of the committee of experts referred\n\nlAnnex 7 of thisCounter-Mernorial, Remark, seep. 377, infra. COUNTER-MEMORIAL OF THE NETNERLANDS 335\n\nto above, the Commission now felt in the position to formulate a general\n\nrule, based on the principle of equidistance, applicable to the boundaries\n\nof the continental shelf both of adjacent States and of States whose coasts\n\nare opposite to each other. The rule thus proposed is subject to such\n\nmodi~cationsas may be agreed upon by the parties. Moreover, while inthe\n\ncase of both kinds of boundaries theruleof eauidistance istheaeneralrule.\n\nit issubjectto modificafiunincasesinwhichan0ther boundary liieis justified\n\nby special circumstances. As in the case of the boundaries of coastal\n\nwaters, provision must be made for departures necessitated by any ex-\n\nceptional configuration of the Coast, as well as the presence of islands or\n\nof navigable channels. To that extent the rule adopted partakes of some\n\nelasticity. In viewof the general arbitration cIau... no special provision\n\nwas considered necessaryfor submitting any resulting disputes to arbitra-\n\ntion. Such arbitration, while expected to take into account the special\n\ncircumstancescaliingfor modificationof the majorprincipleof equidistance,\n\nis not contemplated as arbitration ex aequo etbono. That major principle\n\nmus?constifirtethe basis of the arbitrafion, conceivedas settfement on fhe\n\nbasis of Iaw,subject to reasonable modificationsnecessitated by the special\n\ncircurnstances of the case.\" (Italics added.)\n\nIn the Iight of that paragraph in the Commission's Report, it seems to the\n\nNetherIands quite misleading to suggest that it accepted the \"equidistance\n\nprinciple\" either half-heartedly or merely as a pureIy \"subsidiary\" rule.\n\n62. When the Commission adopted the equidistance principle in 1953for the\n\ncontinental shelf it had still not begun its study of the régime ofthe territorial\n\nsea. However, like the committee of experts, it recognized that the delimitation\n\nof the territorial seand the continental shelf should be governed by the same\n\nprinciples. Paragraph 83 of the Commission's 1953Report thus records:\n\n\"Without prejudice to the element of elasticity implied in article 7, the\n\nCommission wasof the ooinion that. where the same continental shelf is\n\ncontiguous to the territoiies of two adjacent States, the delimitation ofthe\n\ncontinental shelf between thern should be carried out in accordance with\n\nthe same principles as govern the delimitation of the territorial waters\n\nbetween the two States in question.\"\n\nConfomably with this opinion, when the Commission did corne to deal with\n\nthe régimeof the territorial sea at its1954 and 1955 sessions, it adopted the\n\nequidistance principle as the general rule both for opposite and for \"adjacent\"\n\nStates. As in the case of the continental shelf, it made the application of the\n\nprinciple subject to any agreement reached betweenthe States concerned and\n\nmade allowance for \"special circumstances\". But both for \"opposite\" and\n\n\"adjacent\" States the general rule whichit proposed wasa boundary determined\n\nby application of the principle of equidistance from the respective baselines\n\nof the States concerned. In doing so, it recailed the opinion of the Cornmittee\n\nof Experts and underlined that it was followingthe samemethod of delimitation\n\nfor the territorial sea as for the continental shelf. (SeeArts15 and 16 of the\n\nCommission's draft articles for 1954 on the Régimeof the Territorial Sea,\n\nYearbook, 1954, Vol. II, pp. 157-158, reproduced without material change as\n\nArts. 14 and 15of its 1955draft, Yearbook, 1955,Vol. TI,p. 38.)\n\n63. At its 1956 session the Commission completed its work on the law of the\n\nsea, re-examining the texts of al1 its articles. In the meantirnea number of\n\ngovernments had submitted comments on the Commission's drafts. Neither in\n\nthe case of the territorial sea nor of the continental shelf did any of these336 NORTH SEA CONTINENTAL SHELF\n\ngovernments oppose the adoption of the equidistance principle as the general\n\nrule for delimitingthe boundary both as betweenopposite States and as between\n\nadjacent States, should they not agree upon the boundary. Only three States\n\nmade comments on the delimitation proposals, and one of these, Yugoslavia,\n\ndid so for the purpose of advocating the strengthening of the equidistance rule\n\nby omitting the words \"in the absence of agreement between those States, or\n\nunless another boundary line is justified by specialcircumstances\" (Yearbook,\n\n1956, Vol. II, p. 100). Norway's comment sought only to cal1attention to the\n\nproblem of delimiting the boundary of the territorial sea in cases where the\n\nStates concerned claim territorial seas of different breadths. Having declared\n\nher support for the \"median line\" principle, she suggested that the problem\n\nmight be solved by formufating the rule for the territorial sea negatively: \"in\n\nthe absence of special agreement, no State is entitled to extend the boundary\n\nof its territorial sea beyond the median line\" (ibid., p. 69). This suggestion,\n\nalthough not followed up by the Commission, in fact formed the basis of the\n\nsolution aftenvards arrived ai by the Geneva Conference (see infi, para. 117).\n\n64. The third State, the United Kingdom, had no criticism to make of the\n\nCommission'sproposals forthe delimitation of theterritorial sea and continental\n\nshelf boundaries in the case of aa)bcewt States.Its comments were directedat\n\nthe rules proposed for \"opposite\" States inArticles 14and 7 of the Commis-\n\nsion's draft, which provided that. in the absence of agreement and unless\n\nanother boundary is justified by special circurnstances, \"the boundary isthe\n\nmedian Eirreevery point of which isequidistant .. .\",etc. In substance, the\n\nUnited Kingdom proposed that instead of stating \"the boundary is the median\n\nline\" the texts should read: \"the boundary ... is usually determined, unless\n\nanother boundary lineisjustified by speciaIcircumstances, by theapplicationof\n\nthe prirrciple of the mediari line everypoinf of which isequidistant . ..\", etc.\n\nThis proposa1 it explained as follows (Yearbook, 1956,Vol, II, pp. 85and 87):\n\n\"The application of an exact median line, which is a matter of consid-\n\nerable technical complexity, would in many instances be open to the ob-\n\njections that the geographicalconfiguration ofthe coast made it inequitable,\n\nand that the base-lines (Le., the Iow-watermark of the coast) were liable\n\nto physical change in course of time.\n\nIn the experience of the United Kingdom Government, the rnost\n\nsatisfactory course will usuallbe to apply theprinciple of the medianlitre:\n\nthat is an approximate or simpljfied median line based as closely as\n\ncircumstances allow on an exact median line and drawn on a specificchart\n\nof a specific date.\" (Italics in the original.)\n\nAfterabrief discussion,the Commission concluded that the existingwording\n\nof the text already met the situation sufficientlyon this point.\n\n65. In its fina1revision the Commission slightlymodified the wording of the\n\nprovisions concerning the territorial sea and continental shelf boundaries of\n\n\"opposite\" States so as to specify that, in the first instance, they should be\n\ndetermined by agreement. But after weighing the comment of Governments\n\nit reaffirmed,without any hesitation and almost without discussion, its support\n\nfor the principleof equidistance as thegeneral rule of delimitation in the absence\n\nof agreement both in the case of \"opposite States\" and in that of \"adjacent\n\nStates\".\n\n66. Throughout the period during which the codification and progressive\n\ndevelopment of the law of the sea was under consideration by the International\n\nLaw Commission the whole doctrine of the coastal State's rights over the COUNTER-MEMORIAL OF THE NETHERLANDS 337\n\ncontinental shelf was stilincourse of formation. The unilateral claims which\n\nhad been made by individual States varied in their nature and extent; and many\n\ncoastal States, incIuding al1 the Parties to the present dispute, had not yet\n\npromulgated any claim.Thework of the Commissionboth helpedto consolidate\n\nthe doctrine in international law and to clarify its content. This it did no less\n\nin regard to the delimitation of boundaries between States on the continental\n\nshelf than it did in regard to thenature and extent of the legatrights of coastal\n\nStates over the continental shelf. The provisions drafted by the Commission\n\nregarding the delimitation of boundaries were part and parcel of its conso-\n\nlidation and darification of the continental shelf doctrine.\n\nThus, just as the work of the Commission and the contribution tothat work\n\nmade by governments wereimportant factors in developing a consensus as to\n\nthe acceptability of the doctrine and its nature and extent, so aIso were they\n\nimportant factors in developing a consensus as to the acceptability of the\n\nequidistance principle as the general rule for the delimitation of continentaI\n\nshelf boundaries.\n\n67. The NetherIands Government participated in the work of the Interna-\n\ntional Law Commission by commenting upon the Commission's proposals as\n\nand when requested by the Secretary-General. On the question of delimitation\n\nthe Netherlands Government, in particular, expressed its support for the\n\nprinciple embodied in Article 6, as has been noted in paragraph 12 (p. 312,\n\nsilpiiaabovs.\n\n68. The Federal Republic was not among the States invited to comment\n\nupon the Commission's proposals and did not, therefore, participate in any\n\nway in its work. On the other hand, the proceedings of the International Law\n\nCommission were published bythe United Nations and the FederaI Republic\n\ncan hardly have failed to know ofthem and to follow the growth of the con-\n\nsensus among States regarding both the continental shelf and the equidistance\n\nprinciple.\n\nSectionB. The 1958 GenevaConference on the Law of the Sea\n\n69. At the Geneva Conference of 1958the International Law Commission's\n\ndraft articles formed the basisof the work of the Conference. In the Fourth\n\nCommittee, the Committee concerned with the continental shelf, the main\n\nfocus of interest was the nature and extent of the rights to be attributed to\n\ncoastal States. On thisquestion the Federal Republic submittea memorandum\n\nopposing \"the whole conception\" ofthe rules proposed by the Commission and\n\nadvocating a systemwhich would preservethe character of the continental shelf\n\nas part of the high seas (Ofici alecords, Vol. VI, pp. 1, 71 and 125). This\n\nmemorandum attracted very little notice at the Conference, whichconcentrated\n\nits attention on the proposafs of the Commission. Apparently recognizing that\n\nit was swimming against an overwhelming current, the Federal Republic\n\nparticipated fully in the discussion of the Commission's draft articles.\n\n70. If the main focus of interest at the Conference wasthe nature and extent\n\nof the coastal State's rights, there was also, as paragraph 52 of the Memorial\n\nindicates, some discussjon and revisionof the text of Article 72 of the Com-\n\nmission's draft concerning the delimitation of continental shelf boundaries.\n\nThe Federal Republic in that paragraph summarizes the proceedings at the\n\nConference as follows (p. 56, supra):\n\n\"Some attempts were made to replace the flexibIesystem contained in\n\nArticle 72 by more rigid rules. But al1amendments proposed in this direc-338 NORTH SEACONTINENTALSHELF\n\ntion met with overwhelming opposition both in the Fourth (Continental\n\nShelf) Committee (8-9 April 1958) and in the Plenary Session (22 April\n\n19581,and were rejected.\n\nThe proposal of the Yugoslav delegate, that the equidistance method\n\nshouId be declared determinant, without reservations, for the apportion-\n\nment of the continental shelf, was rejected by the Plenary Session of the\n\nConference by 45 votes to 5(with 1I abstentions). A verylarge majority of\n\nthe States was not prepared to make the equidistance method a solely\n\napplicable rule. Rather did the Conference recognize very clearly that the\n\nequidistance method was suitable for the drawing of boundaries only irnder\n\ncertain circumstances.\" (Italics added.)\n\nThis summary, if in largemeasure true, gives asomewhat misleadingimpression\n\nas to the outcome of the debate. If aYugoslav proposa1to delete the reference\n\nto special circumstances and to Ieave the equidistance principle standing alone\n\nwas rejected bythe Conference, so also was a Venezuelan proposal to delete the\n\nreference to the equidistance principle and to leave the whole rnatter to the\n\nagreement of the States concerned. What the Conference in fact did was to\n\nendorse the text proposed by the International Law Commission, subjectonly\n\nto minor revisions. Under this text, in the absence of an agreement, the equidis-\n\ntance principleis laid down as rhegeneral rule unless another boundary line is\n\njustified by special circumstances.\n\n71. The Federal Republic, it is interesting to note, ultimately voted with the\n\nmajority and in favour of the Commission's text, as revised in discussion\n\n(Oficial Records, Vol. VI, p. 98). In an \"explanation of vote\" the delegate of\n\nthe Federal Republic stated:\n\n\"in view of the inexact nature of the outer Iimit of the continental shelfas\n\ndefined by Article 67, his delegation would have preferred the adoption of\n\nthe Venezuelan amendment. When that amendment was rejected, the\n\ndelegation of the Federal Republic of Germany had accepted the viewsof\n\nthe rnajority of the Committee, subject to an interpretation of the words\n\n'special circumstances' as meaning that any exceptional delimitation of\n\nterritorial watersould affect the delimitation of the continental shelf '.\"\n\n(Italics added.)\n\nThis \"explanation of vote\" isilluminating in two respects. First, the Federal\n\nRepublic's delegation voted for the Venezuelanamendment not because of any\n\ndoubts as to the merits of the equidistance principle but because of the inexact\n\ndefinition of the outerIimitof the continental shelf which had been adopted by\n\nthe Conference. Secondly,the delegation'scaveat as to its understanding of the\n\nwords \"special circumstances\" related only to any \"exceptional delimitation of\n\nterritorial waters\". That caveat made no reference at aIl to any implications to\n\nbe drawn from the lengths of coastlines or to any special considerations\n\naffecting the \"apportioning\" of \"cornmon areas\".\n\n72. No particular significance can be attached to the fact, underlined in\n\nparagraph 52 of the Mernorial, that the Yugoslav proposa1to makethe equidis-\n\ntance principle the sole rule was rejected in the Plenary Meeting of the Con-\n\nference by 47 votes to 5 (with 11 abstentions). The provisions proposed by the\n\nCommission and contained in Article 6 of the Convention do not, however,\n\nmake the equidistance principle the sole criterion. They make it the general\n\nlSee also note on p. 318, supraabove. COUNTER-MEMORIAL OF THE NETHERLANDS 339\n\nrule unless another boundary is justified by special circumstances. More\n\nsignificanceis, therefore, be attached to the fact that in that Plenary Meeting\n\nthe text (Art. 72) containing these provisions wasfinallyadoptedby 63votes to\n\nnone with only 2 abstentions (Oficial Records,Vol. II, p. 15).\n\n73. It is true that, when at the eighteenth Plenary Meeting the Conference\n\nvoted upon the adoption of the Convention as a whole, the Federal Republic\n\ncast its vote against the text of the Convention; for the Convention wasadopted\n\nby 57 votes to3 with 8 abstentions, and one of the three negative votes was that\n\nof the Federal Republic. But each of the three States rejecting the Convention\n\nexplained its vote and it does not seem that any of them was motivated by\n\nopposition to Article 6.Japan said that she had voted against the Convention\n\nbecause no reservations were adrnitted to Articles 67and 68 (now Arts.1and 2)\n\nand because Article 74 (compulsory arbitration) had been rejected by the Con-\n\nference. Belgium and the Federal RepubIic explained that they had voted\n\nagainst the Convention because they objected to the criterion of exploitability\n\nin Article 67 (now Art. 1) and equally could not support the Convention\n\nwithout Article 74, Thus, at the final vote not a single voice was raised against\n\nArticle 6. Moreover, if for other reasons the Federal Republic did on 26 April\n\n1958 cast its vote against the Convention, its rejection of the Convention was\n\nshort-lived because on 30 October of the same year it put its signature to the\n\ntext.\n\n74. In paragraph 52 of the Mernorial, however,emphasis is also given by the\n\nFederal Republic to the fact that Article 12, paragraph 1, of the Convention\n\nallows any State to make reservations to al1 the Articles of the Convention\n\nother than Articles 1-3,andso permitsreservations to Article 6.Thisshows,says\n\nthe Federal Republic, that \"the substance of Article 6 was neither regarded as\n\npart of customary international law nor accorded any sort of fundamental\n\nsignificance\". The conclusion thus drawn by the Federal Republic from the\n\nreservations clause in Article 12 seems much too sweeping for the following\n\nreasons.\n\n75. A wide freedorn to formulate reservations is normally permitted in\n\ngeneraï multilateral treaties, andthat even in the caof codifying conventions\n\nlargely concerned with the reforrnulation of the existing law. But this is only\n\nfor the purpose of facilitating the maximum number of acceptances of the\n\nConvention by allowing States having special problems to make reservations,\n\nprovided that these are compatible with the object and purpose of the Conven-\n\ntion. Accordingly, a freedom to make reservations is perfectly consistent with\n\nthe acceptance of the provisions of the Conventions as stating the generally\n\nrecognized rules of international law applicable in the matters in question.\n\nNeither the Convention on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone nor the\n\nConvention on the High Seas has any clause prohibiting or restricting the\n\nmaking of reservations, and a number of reservations have in fact been made\n\nto each Convention. Yet no one could deny the fundamental significance of\n\nmany of the provisions of these Conventions or the essential character of\n\nmany of their other provisions. The same observations may be made with\n\nreference to the Vienna Convention on Diplornatic Relations.\n\n76. A reservations clauseisintroduced prirnarily whenfor particular reasons\n\nit is desired to prohibit altogether reservations to specific provisions of the\n\nConvention. That this was the case with regard to Article 12of the Continental\n\nShelf Convention is clear from the record of the ninth Plenary Meeting of the\n\nGeneva Conference. Reservations to Articles 1-3were excluded because some340 NORTHSEA CONTINENTAL SHELF\n\nStates considered that reservations to these Articles would really deprive the\n\ndoctrine of the continental shelf of most of its meaning and destroy the very\n\nbasis of the Convention (Oficial Records, Vol. XI,pp. 16-18).But the fact that\n\nreservations to Articles 4-7 were not excluded by the Conference in no way\n\nimplies that these Articles werenot considered to be an integral and important\n\npart of the Convention. The records of the Conference and of the proceedings\n\nof the International Law Commission themselvessufficeto contradict any such\n\nimplication.\n\n77. Furthermore, as appears from paragraphs below, none of the States\n\nwhich have become a party to the Convention-already 37 in number-has\n\nformulated a reservation questioning the validity of the rules set out in Article\n\n6. A few States have made declarations of their understandings regarding the\n\napplication of \"special circumstances\" in their own cases. But there isnothing\n\nin the practice of States since the Geneva Conference to support the idea that\n\nArticle 6 has not been generally accepted as an integral and important part of\n\nthe Convention.\n\nSection C. The Provisionsof Article 6 Are in Harmony with State Practlce\n\nin the Delimitation of Other Maritime and Fresh-Water Boundaries\n\n78. The equidistance principle, proposed by the Committee of Experts and\n\nthe International Law Commission and adopted by the Geneva Conference,\n\nwas far from being a novelty invented by the Committee of Experts in 1953.\n\nIn paragraph 41 of the MemoriaI (p. 38, supra) the Federal Republic indeed\n\nadmits that the \"equidistance principle\" in its median line form has long been\n\nknown in international law:\n\n\"Median lines as sea, lake or river boundaries have existed for a long\n\ntime past. In most cases-leaving out of account irregularities in the\n\ngeographical configuration of the coasts opposite each other and provided\n\nno islands lie between them-they effectuate a just and equitable appor-\n\ntionrnent of the waters between the two States concerned.\"\n\nItis true that later, in paragraph 46 (p. 50, supra), the Federal Republic\n\nseemsrather less generous when it asserts that-\n\n\"the occasionaldivision of rivers, lakes, or inland seas between two States\n\nlying opposite each other by median lines isno proof of a general recogni-\n\ntion of the so-called principle of equidistance also for other geographical\n\nsituations than those of opposite coasts\" (italics added).\n\nBut an examination of the relevant State practiceamply justifies the Federal\n\nRepublic's first staternentthat \"rnedian lines as sea, lake or river boundaries\n\nhave existed for a long tirne past\", and shows that the use of rnedian line\n\nboundaries has been much more than occasional.\n\n79. In this connection the Court is asked to refto Annex 15which, without\n\nattempting to be exhaustive, sets out a veTyconsiderable niimber d cases in\n\nwhich the equidistance principle, chiefly in its median line form, has been\n\nemployed in the delimitation of sea, lake or river boundaries. The list of cases\n\nis impressiveenough even if \"thalweg\" boundaries are left out of account. But\n\nin many cases, as the Dictionnaire de la Terminologiedu Droit International\n\npoints out (p. 602), the term Thalweg is used in treaties as denoting the median\n\nline of the navigable channel or, where the river is not navigable, simply the\n\nmedian line of the river. COUNTER-MEMORIAL OF THE NETHEFZANDS 341\n\n80. As to the Federal Government's contention in paragraph 46 that any\n\npractice in regard to the use of median lineas boundaries between \"opposite\"\n\nStates would be no proof of a general recognition of the principle of equidis-\n\ntance also for other geographical situations, this does not seem to be to the\n\npoint. Iisnot here a question of establishing the \"equidistance principle\" as a\n\nprinciple universally binding in boundary delimitation and, as such, binding\n\non the Parties to the present dispute. Between 1945and 1958a new doctrine\n\ndeveloped in international law vesting new rights in coastal States over the\n\ncontinental shelf adjacent to their coasts. The question here is of the general\n\nrecognition, as part of the developrnent of this doctrine, of the rule that, in the\n\nabsence of agreement, inter-State boundaries on the continental shelf are to\n\nbe de"
