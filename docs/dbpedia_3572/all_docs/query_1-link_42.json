        "text": "History of Air Power\n\nAir power has been used for military purposes since the late 18th century. Although the Chinese may have used huge kites some 2,000 years ago to lift men into the skies for military reconnaissance, the first practical aircraft was the hot-air balloon invented by the brothers Joseph-Michel and Jacques-Étienne Montgolfier of France in 1783. This balloon was capable of rising to 6,000 feet (1,800 meters) and carried baskets to hold crews. This and other balloons were controlled by reheating air, releasing hydrogen gas, or eliminating ballast (weight). In 1793 the French government formed what may have been the world’s first air force when it set up a corps of Aérostiers (Aeronauts) for the purpose of military observation from tethered balloons.\n\nBalloons were first used as offensive weapons in 1849 when the Austrians unsuccessfully attempted to bombard Venice with bombs connected to time fuses. Hot-air balloons proved most useful as reconnaissance craft. This was demonstrated by their employment by both sides in the American Civil War (1861–65), by the British in Africa during the South African War (1899–1902), and by the Russians in Japan during the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05).\n\nIn 1852 air power took a new direction with the first successful demonstration of the dirigible (steerable) balloon airship. Designed by the Frenchman Henri Giffard, the first dirigible was a nonrigid cylindrical-shaped airship composed of a gasbag, 144 feet (44 meters) long, propelled by a steam engine. This dirigible was the prototype of increasingly sophisticated craft, which promised more navigational control than that offered by wind-borne balloons.\n\nTrue military aviation began with the perfection of the navigable airship and the airplane. In 1897 the Austrian David Schwartz designed the world’s first rigid airship. It had an aluminum framework and was covered with aluminum sheeting. Although this craft was wrecked on a test flight, the rigid airship was subsequently improved by Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin of Germany. In 1900 Zeppelin built a huge cigar-shaped, metal-framed ship covered by a smooth cotton cloth, which he named the LZ-1. This ship, 420 feet (128 meters) long and driven by two 16-horsepower engines, was the forerunner of the more powerful zeppelin craft that the Germans used with some success in World War I.\n\nIn 1903 the American brothers Wilbur and Orville Wright took the first controlled and sustained flight in a heavier-than-air craft, an airplane capable of flying at 30 miles (48 kilometers) per hour. Airplane experimentation soon flourished in other countries. Early models were distinguished by the number of wing levels. Monoplanes were designed with a single set of wings, biplanes had two sets of wings, and triplanes had three. Among the other early airplane pioneers was Louis Blériot of France. In 1907 he designed an airplane and flew more than 0.25 mile (400 meters), and in 1909 he demonstrated his type XI monoplane with the first flight across the English Channel, a distance of about 25 miles (40 kilometers).\n\nThe Wright brothers had foreseen that the airplane would be a most useful machine for military reconnaissance. This prediction was first fulfilled on October 23, 1911, during the Italo-Turkish War, when an Italian pilot made a one-hour reconnaissance flight over North Africa in a Blériot XI monoplane. Nine days later the Italians demonstrated another, deadlier use of the airplane, when they tossed heavy hand-grenade bombs from a plane flying over Libya. In 1912 the use of aircraft for psychological warfare was first demonstrated, when propaganda leaflets were showered over Libya from Italian planes.\n\nBombing techniques subsequently improved. In 1910 Glenn Curtiss of the United States dropped dummy bombs on a sea target, and soon thereafter engineers developed bomb carriers and bombsights. The first bomb carrier consisted of a small rack, placed behind the observer’s cockpit, in which small bombs were retained by a pin. The pin was removed over the target by pulling a string.\n\nSoon airplanes were armed with other weapons. By 1910 work had begun on the installation of machine guns. In 1913 Colonel Isaac Newton Lewis of the United States went to Belgium to manufacture the Lewis gun, which was a low-recoil weapon. It came into widespread use in fighter planes that flew during World War I.\n\nBy 1911 deteriorating international relations led many countries to build up military capacity, including air fleets. In this period the first air forces were organized. They were established as subordinate divisions within existing armies.\n\nWorld War I\n\nAt the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Germany led the world in air power with 260 airplanes and a fleet of 14 zeppelins. Other allies of Germany, including Italy, also had newly formed air arms. The British had about 100 aircraft at this time; the French, backed by the world’s leading aviation industry, had 156. Some 100,000 aircraft flew in the war, primarily in support of ground and sea troops.\n\nDuring the war rapid advances were made in both air power strategy and technology. In 1914 the airplanes mobilized for war were flimsy, kitelike structures powered by engines of uncertain power. At best, they could climb 2,000 to 3,000 feet (600 to 900 meters) and fly at speeds of 60 to 70 miles (95 to 110 kilometers) per hour. At worst, they could barely get off the ground. Only four years later single-seat airplane fighters with 150- to 200-horsepower engines were outfitted with machine guns to do battle at 15,000 feet (4,600 meters) in the air.\n\nThe aircraft that were developed during World War I were of three main types, each with its own specific purpose. These airplanes were reconnaissance craft, fighter planes, and bombers.\n\nThe use of aircraft for reconnaissance was probably the most important contribution of air power to the war effort. In the first weeks of hostilities French aircraft spotted the movements of the German First Army, and this led to the First Battle of the Marne. The Germans, in turn, successfully used zeppelin airships to monitor their opponents’—the Allies’—shipping movements. By 1917 these craft could stay in the air for more than 95 hours at a time.\n\nThe British revived interest in nonrigid airships with their design of the blimp (from “British” Class B Airship and “limp”—that is, nonrigid). Hundreds of blimps were built during the war for antisubmarine convoy and coastal patrol work.\n\nReconnaissance techniques were greatly improved during World War I. The British added photography to visual observation in 1914, when they took pictures of German troop positions during the First Battle of the Aisne. Radio came into use at this time as a means of passing messages between reconnaissance aircraft and ground personnel.\n\nAt the start of the war reconnaissance craft were usually unarmed, except for the rifles and pistols carried by fliers. Soon the realization that these craft were vulnerable to attack led to the widespread adoption of the fighter plane—an aircraft designed to attack enemy reconnaissance and bombing aircraft.\n\nFighter planes were pioneered by Britain, which in 1913 had developed the Vickers Destroyer, a fighting biplane. In 1915 the French adapted the interrupter to a Morane-Saulnier monoplane. This gun synchronizer allowed machine gun bullets to pass between the blades of a spinning propeller.\n\nWhen the Germans shot down a French fighter plane in 1915, the Dutch designer Anthony Fokker used the captured French craft as a model for his Fokker Eindecker, a single-seat fighter that was to give the German Luftwaffe (air force) temporary air superiority on the Western Front. From October 1915 until May 1916, Fokker Eindeckers blasted the French and British from the skies, a mastery that was ended only when the Allied forces improved their own fighter craft in 1916. That year the British developed D.H.2 and F.E.2b “pusher” fighters. These airplanes were fitted with one or more nose-fixed guns that fired forward, and the pilot could aim his aircraft as a firing weapon.\n\nThe aerial warfare made possible by these fighting airplanes led to individual combat in dogfights, one-on-one battles between pilots who used machine guns against enemy fliers. The war produced hundreds of flying aces, pilots who were credited with shooting down five or more enemy aircraft. Among the most famous were Captain Edward (“Eddie”) Rickenbacker of the United States, Baron Manfred von Richthofen of Germany, René Fonck of France, and Edward Mannock of Great Britain. These pilots also introduced the strategy of flying planes in a “circus” formation, or an air armada. The flying circus led to enormous air battles involving more than 100 fighter planes at a time.\n\nA related development was the building of aircraft carriers to launch fighter planes from platforms built over battleship gun turrets. Some aircraft carriers were merely barges that were towed behind high-speed destroyers.\n\nA third type of aircraft developed during the war was the bomber. After 1915 both sides used bombers to attack enemy targets, such as railway stations and weapons storehouses. These targets were deep behind enemy lines and out of the range of conventional ground troops.\n\nThe Germans used their zeppelin aircraft as strategic bombers during the war, launching raids against London, England, and other European cities. But zeppelins proved to be too vulnerable, and by 1916 the Germans were building bomber airplanes.\n\nThe German Gotha biplanes of 1916 had a wingspan of nearly 90 feet (27 meters) and two engines of 260 horsepower each. The Gothas could carry a 2,000-pound (900-kilogram) bombload and fly 300 miles (480 kilometers) without refueling. Even larger was the Siemens-Schuckert R-VIII, a bomber with a wingspread of more than 150 feet (45 meters) and powered by six 300-horsepower engines.\n\nThe Russians, British, and French also developed bomber airplanes. In 1915 Igor Sikorsky of Russia designed the first successful four-engined airplane. The British contributed the twin-engined Handley Page, the first heavy bomber used by British and American forces. The Voisin bomber of France was also in service in World War I. Known as the “chicken coop” because of its profusion of struts and wires, the Voisin type L had an 80-horsepower engine and could carry 130 pounds (58 kilograms) of bombs that the flier could hand drop overboard.\n\nWhile large numbers of aircraft were used in World War I, they exercised little direct influence on the outcome of the conflict. The importance of air power in this war was rather in the development of increasingly sophisticated types of aircraft and of new strategic policies, which would be significant for military use in the later wars of the 20th century. (See also World War I Chronology.)\n\nThe Interwar Years\n\nDuring the years between World Wars I and II, national air forces emerged around the world. There were also a number of tremendous advances in aircraft technology and strategy.\n\nImmediately after World War I progress was slow. This was because there was a surplus of airplanes during peacetime, and governments were reluctant to spend money on the development of new military aircraft. Moreover, the Treaty of Versailles—the peace document signed at the end of the war—forbade the Germans to arm for military purposes, and what had been one of the world’s most powerful air forces was disbanded. Two important strategic concepts were shaped in this period. The first was the doctrine of strategic bombing. The Italian brigadier general Giulio Douhet argued in “The Command of the Air”, an influential essay that was first published in 1921, that future wars would be won by huge formations of bomber planes striking deep into enemy territory against industrial targets and civilian population centers. This would, Douhet stated, disrupt production and destroy national morale. The need for this kind of air power meant that countries should concentrate their military resources to build up powerful independent air forces with which to defeat their enemies without the aid of land or sea power.\n\nThis idea of the independent air force was the second important air power concept of the interwar era. Supporters included the British general Hugh Montague Trenchard and the American general William (Billy) Mitchell. Mitchell claimed that the airplane was the most important instrument of war, and that the failure of United States military leaders to expand the air force amounted to no less than “criminal negligence.” Mitchell’s outspoken views led to his court-martial in 1925. But his vision of the future of air power proved to be correct.\n\nIn Britain the Royal Air Force was firmly established as an independent power by 1923, when the government began an air defense program. The Italians established the Regia Aeronautica (Royal Air Force; now the Aeronautica Militare, or Italian Air Force) in 1923. The French followed in 1928 with an air ministry and later with the creation of the Armée de l’Air (now the Armée de l’Air et de l’Espace, or the Air and Space Army). In 1935 restrictions against German rearmament ended, and dictator Adolf Hitler established the Luftwaffe as an independent military service. In the United States, the Soviet Union, and Japan, air arms remained under the control of previously established military branches.\n\nPerhaps the most important technical improvement in this era was the development of jet propulsion. In 1930 Frank Whittle of Great Britain patented the first jet engine. On August 27, 1939, a Heinkel He-178 airplane in Germany made the first flight of a jet-powered aircraft.\n\nRocket research also began in the interwar years. Both the Germans and the Soviets were experimenting with rocket-powered aircraft by 1930, and in the United States inventor Robert Goddard was researching liquid-fueled rockets in New Mexico.\n\nThe military airplane was completely transformed between the world wars. Wood construction gave way to metal. Typical of the new fighter craft was the British Supermarine Spitfire, first flown in 1936. Its metal structure and a new type of machine armament on the wings to eliminate the need for bulky interrupter gear made it an advanced craft for its time.\n\nIn 1931 the Boeing Airplane Company (now the Boeing Company) of the United States built the B-9 bomber. Also of all-metal design, it was a great improvement over all previous bombers. In 1932 the Martin B-10 added enclosed cockpits and an internal weapons bay for further structural improvement.\n\nIn 1935 the Boeing B-17 was flight-tested. This was the prototype for the Flying Fortress, the bombardment mainstay of World War II. By the late 1930s bombers and fighter planes were equipped with bulletproof windshields, armor plating, gun turrets, and radar attachments.\n\nAs airplane technology advanced in these ways, the airship received a blow from which it never recovered. In May 1937 the German passenger dirigible Hindenburg exploded at the Lakehurst (New Jersey) Naval Air Station, killing 36 people. With its destruction, the era of the great dirigible balloons passed.\n\nDuring the 1930s air power was increasingly a factor in wars throughout the world. The British used air power in colonial conflicts in Iraq, Aden (now in Yemen), and India. The Italians used a tactical air force against Ethiopia in 1935. In the Spanish Civil War (1936–39) the air forces of Italy and Germany supported Spanish general Francisco Franco with the bombing of Spanish cities, including Barcelona, Madrid, and Guernica. Japan mounted an air attack against China in a 1931 dispute over the control of Manchuria. By the time the Germans used air power in their invasions of Czechoslovakia and Poland in 1938 and 1939, it was evident that air power had come into its own.\n\nWorld War II\n\nAir power was a decisive factor in the outcome of World War II. An early German lead in air power was overcome by Allied advances in both radar technology and the use of strategic weapons.\n\nAt the start of the war in September 1939 the German Luftwaffe was the best equipped air force in the world, with some 500,000 air force personnel and about 5,000 aircraft. In contrast, the British Royal Air Force (RAF) was composed of some 100,000 men and some 2,000 aircraft.\n\nStrategic bombing became an early part of the war effort. The Germans successfully used intensive bombing raids to assault Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. Luftwaffe bombers destroyed Allied cities and transportation networks and flew in support of advancing German ground troops.\n\nIn the Battle of Britain in the summer of 1940, British RAF forces of about 600 aircraft, mostly Hawker Hurricanes and Supermarine Spitfires, faced some 2,500 Luftwaffe planes, including the powerful Junkers JU-87 Stuka dive-bomber. But this imbalance was overcome by pioneering developments in British radar, which allowed the RAF to manage its aircraft efficiently by using an early-warning system. As a result, the RAF was largely responsible for preventing a German invasion of England.\n\nThe German air raids on London and other British cities in 1940 and 1941, called the Blitz, further demonstrated the potential of strategic bombing. For over a month in the fall of 1940, German bombers dropped nearly 14,000 tons (12,700 metric tons) of high explosives and more than 12,000 incendiary canisters. These attacks subsided as Germany became engaged on other fronts, particularly with the Soviet Union.\n\nAt the same time Allied forces were developing improved aircraft able to match those of the Luftwaffe. The Americans produced the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress day bomber and the four-engine B-24 Liberator. By 1942 the British had added the Bristol Beaufighter long-range fighter and the Avro Lancaster, a four-engined heavy bomber.\n\nBy 1943 the Allied bombing offensive led to the round-the-clock bombing of Germany, shifting the balance of air power away from the Luftwaffe. The United States bombed German cities by day, and the RAF continued the assault at night. By 1945 this bombing strategy had caused some 600,000 casualties and inflicted great damage on German cities, including Dresden, Hamburg, Essen, and Berlin. On March 11, 1945, 1,079 United States Eighth Air Force planes released 4,738 tons (4,298 metric tons) of explosives on Essen. This was the greatest weight of bombs dropped on a single target in Europe.\n\nOn the Pacific Front the Japanese launched a surprise air attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941. They crippled or destroyed 19 Navy ships, including 8 battleships, and more than 300 aircraft and killed or wounded more than 3,400 troops. By 1944 the Allies had countered with systematic bombing raids over Japan. These raids utilized the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, a long-range bomber operating from bases in China and later from islands in the central Pacific.\n\nIn 1945 United States Major General Curtis E. LeMay of the 21st Bomber Command ordered his Superfortresses to attack Japanese industrial centers with firebombs. Seventeen strikes totaling 6,960 flights dropped 41,600 tons (37,700 metric tons) of incendiaries and set afire 102 square miles (264 square kilometers) of Tokyo, Nagoya, Kobe, Osaka, and Yokohama.\n\nIn 1944 and 1945 the Japanese tried a new tactic. Kamikaze (“divine wind”) pilots, believing in the Shinto philosophy of honorable death in battle, committed suicide by diving bomb-laden Mitsubishi A6M planes into sea targets. These kamikaze attacks sank 34 ships and damaged hundreds of others.\n\nAir power was decisive in battles on other fronts, including the Mediterranean, where British air forces supported General Bernard Montgomery’s pursuit of the fleeing German army in Egypt and Libya. Allied air forces also contributed to the German collapse in North Africa in 1943.\n\nIn the Soviet Union inferior equipment and training allowed German air supremacy on the Eastern Front until 1944. By then the Soviet air force was able to dominate in clashes with the Luftwaffe. In the spring of 1945 the Soviet air force devastated Berlin with more than 7,500 bombers.\n\nWhile bombers were used extensively in World War II, other aircraft also had a great impact. Planes used for tactical support contributed to the Allied landing at Normandy on June 6, 1944, when United States forces flew more than 8,000 sorties in support of the operation. By that time Allied forces had won air superiority over most of Europe.\n\nFighter planes, used to battle enemy fighters and attack enemy bombers, increased in speed during the war. Among the first small high-speed strike aircraft was the heavily armored Soviet Ilyushin IL-2 Stormovik. In 1943 and 1944 American P-47 and P-51 fighters, equipped with external fuel tanks, flew long-range cover for heavy bombers. These fighters were in great part responsible for gaining Allied air superiority over Europe. Jet and rocket-powered planes in use by 1944 boosted fighter speeds from about 350 miles (565 kilometers) per hour to 600 miles (965 kilometers) per hour. The RAF put the first jet fighter, the Gloster Meteor, into operation in 1944. The Germans soon followed with the Messerschmitt ME-262 twin jet fighter.\n\nIn 1944 the Germans used V-1 flying bombs and, later, V-2 rockets carrying high explosives to threaten British cities. These bombs caused considerable damage for a short period but were developed too late to play a major role in the war. Allied forces bombed the launch sites in northern Europe and overran them soon after the Allied invasion of Europe in June 1944. These early rockets were prototypes for the guided missiles of the postwar era.\n\nReconnaissance developments included the use of streamlined high-speed fighter planes that sped low over enemy targets to take photographs and then escaped homeward at maximum speed. High-altitude craft took photographs on motion-picture film that was later processed into mosaic large-scale maps, foreshadowing developments in aerial mapmaking.\n\nAir transport advances during the war included the use of airborne parachute troops dropped by plane into combat areas. The German air force first tried this technique during the Battle of Crete in May 1941, using the Junkers JU-52 transport plane and troop-carrying gliders.\n\nWorld War II ended in 1945. The war in Europe came to an end in May, when the German forces surrendered to the Allies. The war in the Pacific ended in August with the bombing of two Japanese cities. On August 6 a B-29, the Enola Gay, dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, and three days later another B-29 dropped an atomic bomb on Nagasaki. The next day the Japanese agreed to accept the terms of surrender. (See also World War II Chronology.)\n\nThe Korean War\n\nThe conflict over the control of Korea, fought from 1950 to 1953, was between North Korea (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea), supported by the Soviet Union and China, and South Korea (Republic of Korea), supported by United Nations (UN) forces dominated by the United States. Both sides suppressed the use of all-out air power strategies in an effort to avoid a world war. (See also Korean War Chronology.)\n\nAir power during the Korean War was used only against precise targets in a limited area of conflict. Bombers attacked bridges, roads, and industrial centers, while planes such as the B-26 flew in support of ground armies. The UN forces limited the air power capacity of the North Koreans by destroying their air bases as they neared completion.\n\nThe first jet fighter battles were fought in this war, as Republic F-84 Thunderjets, Lockheed P-80C Shooting Stars, and North American F-86 Sabres faced Mikoyan MiG-15’s in the skies over Korea. The first heavy jet bomber, the Boeing B-47 Stratofortress, was in use by 1951. Another important development in Korea was the use of the helicopter in warfare. Helicopters were used to transport men, supplies, and guns to otherwise inaccessible places. They were also used to fire rockets and other missiles. They could evacuate casualties quickly, resulting in a reduction of the death rate to the lowest figure in modern military history.\n\nThe Indochinese War\n\nUnited States military involvement in Indochina began in 1961, when American troops entered Vietnam as advisers in a conflict between the South Vietnamese government and communist rebels. By 1965 United States military forces were heavily engaged in attacks on the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese targets (see Vietnam War).\n\nThe use of air power in this war, as in Korea, was primarily for tactical support. Air Force pilots used fighter and bomber planes to destroy enemy supplies, support ground troops, and deliver both supplies and personnel. American pilots also dropped defoliants—chemical substances that destroy plant life—over the countryside. They hoped in this way to deny the cover of trees to guerrilla fighters. Uncrewed aerial vehicles (drones) were used to penetrate bombed areas at high speeds and photograph earlier strikes.\n\nThe high cost and complex operation requirements of jet planes made the use of less powerful aircraft more expedient. In Vietnam the A-4 Skyhawk, with a maximum speed of 685 miles (1,102 kilometers) per hour, proved most effective for tactical support.\n\nThe Boeing B-52 jet bomber was also used during this conflict. First used in 1955, the B-52 was a huge jet airplane with a range greater than 12,000 miles (19,300 kilometers), a wingspan of 185 feet (56 meters), and speeds of up to 630 miles (1,015 kilometers) per hour. Among the high-technology weapons it carried were precision guided munitions, including the “smart bomb”—an explosive directed to its target by the use of a laser beam.\n\nAir power advances were made in the development of short-takeoff-and-landing (STOL) craft, which reduced the need for long concrete runways, and in counterinsurgency aircraft (COIN), designed to operate from rough terrain. Helicopters were used in an air patrol system that also employed transport planes. The air patrol system brought mobility to ground troops by transporting men, guns, ammunition, and supplies to remote locations. In October 1965 the relief of an outpost was accomplished by the arrival of a whole division in helicopters.\n\nThe main use of strategic bombing occurred in December 1971 and in April 1972. United States Air Force (USAF) Strategic Air Command pilots blanketed Hanoi and Haiphong in North Vietnam with bombs dropped from B-52’s in an intensive series of raids. As in Korea, the lesson in Indochina was that conventional bombing and fighter strategies would not by themselves win a guerrilla war.\n\nMiddle Eastern Wars\n\nSeveral conflicts in the Middle East between Israel and its Arab neighbors have been shaped by the use of air power. The Suez Crisis of 1956—over control of the Suez Canal—began when British, French, and Israeli forces dominated Egyptian airspace by using fighter and bomber aircraft as a tactical support force for advancing ground troops. Within two days the Egyptian air force was destroyed. In 1967 the Six-Day War between Egypt and Israel was won by the superior air strategy of Israel. Both Egypt and Israel had equal air forces, though Egypt could call upon the military resources of other Arab countries. But in three hours, on June 5, 1967, the Israeli air force completed a preemptive strike against Egyptian airfields. This attack, along with raids on the airfields of Syria, Jordan, and Iraq, led to Israel’s eventual victory.\n\nAt the start of the Yom Kippur War of October 1973, a surprise strike by Arab forces killed more than 2,500 Israelis and destroyed a fifth of their air fleet. While Israel countered with the use of paratroopers, ground tank forces, and conventional air power to end the war, the Egyptian use of missiles reduced the effectiveness of Israeli air efforts.\n\nAir Power in the Missile Age\n\nOne of the most important developments after World War II was the achievement of supersonic flight. On October 14, 1947, Major Chuck Yeager of the USAF became the first person to fly faster than the speed of sound. He made his historic flight in a Bell X-1 rocket-powered airplane. The Soviets also broke the sound barrier in 1947, using the MiG-15 fighter. By the time of the Korean War, fighters could fly at supersonic speeds of Mach 2, or twice the speed of sound. By 1959 planes such as the Mirage III and the Lockheed F-104 could fly as fast as 1,650 miles (2,655 kilometers) per hour. In the 1950s and ’60s the USAF teamed with the U.S. Navy and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to develop the supersonic North American X-15 rocket plane, which could reach a speed of Mach 6.7 (4,520 miles, or 7,275 kilometers, per hour).\n\nAlthough missiles have to some degree made the heavy bomber obsolete, the United States and a few other countries retain long-range supersonic bombers equipped with automatic navigation and electronic countermeasure (ECM) systems. These automated systems arose because supersonic speeds in aircraft made the human navigation and control of the planes extremely difficult. Aircraft control was made easier with the development of avionics, the use of electronic aids in aviation.\n\nAvionics relies on the use of miniature electronic components and computer and radar technology to automate navigation and weapons systems. For example, avionic-equipped jets can be flown on preset courses, while radar searches for and “locks onto” enemy aircraft. After firing at the most favorable moment, the electronic fighter can break away to return to base. The devices used for this kind of detection, pursuit, and destruction of enemy aircraft also are used for ECM devices, which attempt to disable enemy countermeasures and jam radar.\n\nThe external design of aircraft has changed as flying speeds have increased. Swept-back wings and delta plane forms replaced the straight or tapered wings of World War II. By the early 1990s, variable-geometry arrangements—to allow wing flexibility—had been developed.\n\nLong-range capabilities of postwar aircraft were further extended with the growth of aerial refueling. In 1949 the Boeing B-50 Lucky Lady II flew nonstop around the world in 94 hours, proving the feasibility of aerial refueling for long-range missions. In another demonstration of in-flight refueling, two Republic F-84-E Thunderjet fighters flew across the Atlantic in 1950 in just over 10 hours, completing the first nonstop, transoceanic jet flight.\n\nMissile development began in earnest in the early 1950s, when both the Soviets and the Americans introduced their first missiles. For decades these two countries continued to seek equality in military strength by balancing and counterbalancing various types of offensive and defensive missile forces. In air defense, where missiles have an irreplaceable role, fighter-interceptor aircraft also play a part. Airborne for long periods, they can meet attacking aircraft or missiles far from the target. In strategic warfare bombers and missiles complement one another.\n\nThe crewed bomber is flexible. It can be recalled or directed to switch targets. Its crew can take radar-map pictures of the area it has destroyed and use them to plan subsequent missions. Jet bombers can carry far heavier and more varied loads of explosives than can earlier types of bombers. The crewed plane is essential in search and rescue, transport, evacuation of wounded troops, antisubmarine patrol, and other missions where the human factor is decisive.\n\nIn the 1970s both the Soviet Union and the United States developed high-performance, complex airplanes for crewed flight. The Soviet MiG-25 Foxbat attack and fighter plane could fly up to Mach 3 in short bursts and was capable of firing the air-to-air Acrid missile. The United States developed the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, an effective long-range flier that carried Sparrow and Sidewinder missiles. The fighter-bomber version, known as the Strike Eagle, carried out much of the nighttime precision bombing of Iraqi installations during the Persian Gulf War of 1990–91.\n\nAmong other specialized crewed planes designed in the postwar era have been the short-takeoff-and-landing (STOL) and vertical-takeoff-and-landing (VTOL) crafts. The Korean and Vietnam wars proved the need for planes able to take off and land in remote jungles, in forested areas, and on ships. The STOL and VTOL craft provided some independence from long permanent runways. The Hawker Harrier was a fighter plane with this capability. It became operational with the Royal Air Force in 1967 and over the following decades was fitted with avionics of growing capabilities. The Royal Navy’s Sea Harrier version distinguished itself in the Falkland Islands War in 1982.\n\nThe high production cost of specialized aircraft has led to the growing use by many smaller countries of the multirole combat aircraft (MRCA). The MRCA is an airplane that can be adapted to a variety of functions—bomber, fighter, and reconnaissance. An example is the European-made Panavia Tornado, commissioned by Britain, West Germany, and Italy, and made operational in 1976. The Tornado carries up to 18,000 pounds (8,200 kilograms) of bombs, missiles, and a mix of laser, radar, and electronic aids. Multirole aircraft developed in the late 20th and early 21st centuries included the Eurofighter Typhoon and the F-35 Lightning II.\n\nThe MRCA and other low-cost strike aircraft are more widely used by countries looking for cost-effectiveness in their military spending. These aircraft were developed from such trainers as the Cessna A-37 and are relatively inexpensive, small, and highly maneuverable.\n\nAir Forces in Outer Space\n\nThe countries of the world have been reaching into outer space since the development of jet and rocket propulsion in the late 1940s. In 1956 the USAF launched the Bell X-2, a rocket-powered research craft, to an altitude of nearly 24 miles (39 kilometers). On October 4, 1957, the Space Age began in earnest as the Soviet Union used an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) to launch the 184-pound (83-kilogram) Sputnik satellite into orbit.\n\nBy the early 1980s, in both the Soviet Union and the United States, satellites that could use laser beams and particle beams to destroy ground-based targets and spacecraft were under study. Orbital bombardment weapons were also under study. The Soviets researched the SS-9 Scarp, a satellite armed with a nuclear warhead, which would remain in orbit until needed.\n\nThe ability of space vehicles to gather intelligence has grown. Some reconnaissance satellites furnish detailed pictures of military installations. Others eavesdrop on electronic conversations. Reconnaissance satellites carrying infrared sensors can also detect missile launches or heat-producing craft.\n\nThe Soviet Union first launched a military observation satellite, the Kosmos 112, in 1969 to provide coverage of Norway, Alaska, and Greenland. Vela satellites, launched between 1963 and 1970, orbited some 60,000 miles (96,500 kilometers) from Earth to monitor nuclear explosions in space. More advanced satellites capture cell phone conversations and search hidden Internet sites (the dark web) for terrorist activity."
