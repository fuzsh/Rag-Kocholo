In 2017, the RNLAF signed an agreement to upgrade its remaining six D-model Chinook helicopters to the latest F-model configuration, ensuring commonality of systems for its entire 20-aircraft fleet.\n\nShare this Article\n\nLufthansa subsidiary Discover Airlines has condemned the strike call issued by the pilots' union Cockpit (VC) and the cabin crew union UFO as irresponsible, the FAZ reported.
