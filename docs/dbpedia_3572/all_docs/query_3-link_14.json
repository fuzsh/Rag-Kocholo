        "text": "Situation\n\nThe Royal Netherlands Airforce (RNLAF) operates and maintains several different aircraft, helicopters and weapons systems. Central depot maintenance is responsible to ensure continued fleet availability towards operating bases. However different systems are used within the organization to track maintenance execution on fleet types. This makes it difficult to gain an overall overview on fleet status, maintenance turnaround times, aircraft availability and bottlenecks in the maintenance process that impact aircraft availability.\n\nSolution\n\nSpecialist of EXSYN collaborated with system specialists from the RNLAF in order to establish a detailed solution design for a custom build analytics dashboard. Prior to building the dashboard definitions were established for metrics to display per fleet type, formulas to be used as well as underlying data mapped to the new dashboard. The solution design document was delivered to the RNLAF to initiate the development of their mission critical dashboard."
