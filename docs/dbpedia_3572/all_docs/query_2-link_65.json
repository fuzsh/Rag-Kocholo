        "text": "The squadron became operational on the F-16 on November 1st, 1987, only in the FBA role at that moment. Followed one year later with the CWI task. The squadron was also assigned to the NATO AMF (Ace Mobile Forces) force. It took over this task from 314 sqn on October 3rd, 1988 because that squadron was to convert to the F-16. Although only a temporary task at first (till the conversion of 314 sqn was finished), it ultimately proved that this task would be assigned to 315 sqn permanently.\n\nIn April of 1999 the squadron also started, together with 311 sqn, to train on dropping laser-guided bombs. The illumination of the targets was done by the British Buccaneers of 237 squadron. Together with this task, the squadron also performed a QRA (Quick Reaction Alert) duty together with its sister squadron - the 313th - to relieve the two Leeuwarden based squadrons - 322 sqn & 323 sqn - of this duty.\n\nDuring the first Gulf War the squadron was assigned to the AMF and consequently the Dutch government offered the F-16s of 315 sqn to Turkey to protect the country against a possible attack by Iraq. Turkey rejected on the offer and instead Belgian Mirage V, Italian F-104S and German Alpha Jets went to Diyarbakir to protect the Turkish airspace.\n\nA remarkable fact in the history of the 315th sqn was that it received the last F-16 of the Fokker production line on February 27th, 1992. This was airframe #J-021.\n\nA year later the squadron was the first to leave for Villafranca AB in Italy for operation 'Deny Flight'. On April 12th, 1993 two F-16s - #J-508 & #J-516 - lifted their noses into the sky to commence this operation. The operations over former Yugoslavia only ended 8 years later, with 315 sqn contributing to these operations on a regular bases.\n\nWith the latest defense cuts within the Dutch military, it was decided that the RNlAF had to loose one squadron. After celebrating its 50th anniversary in 2002, the squadron started with minimizing its activities. It finally disbanded in 2004."
