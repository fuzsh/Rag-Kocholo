Soesterberg was established as an airfield in 1911, and in 1913 the Dutch Government bought the field and established the Army Aviation Branch (dutch: Luchtvaartafdeeling). The \"Military Aviation Branch\" eventually became the Koninklijke Luchtmacht (English: Royal Netherlands Air Force - RNLAF). It's first commander was a captain of the Engineer Corps: Henk Walaardt Sacré.\n\nThroughout World War I Soesterberg served as the main airfield of the Luchtvaartafdeeling with several types of aircraft. Some were bought outright from their manufacturer, while others were interned when they diverted to Holland due to battle damage or other reasons.\n\nSoesterberg village and the Soesterberg heath in 1902\n\nSoesterberg, an RAF (Royal Aircraft Factory) BE-2 registered as LA24 (ex-RFC1677) an interned British aircraft during the Great War in 1915 (Nederlands Instituut voor Militaire Historie).\n\nAerial photo of a Handley Page V/1500 at Soesterberg, in 1919 during the ELTA (Nederlands Instituut voor Militaire Historie).\n\nAerial photo of Soesterberg in the 1920s.\n\nQueen-mother Emma at Soesterberg in June 1928.

The Dutch government did not spend too much money on its air force however, until the second half of the 1930s. Recognising the threat of Germany in particular, it embarked on a modernisation programme. New fighters such as the Fokker D.XXI and G.1 were ordered, along with batches of Douglas DB-8a and Fokker T.5 bombers. All aircraft were delivered to Soesterberg to be sent to their units.\n\nThe Soesterberg \"Vliegheide (flying heath) and Vliegkamp 'Flying camp'). The name of the airfield and the village come from De Soesterberg (the mountain of Soest), a distinct bump in an otherwise fairly flat dutch landscape.\n\nFokker T.5 medium Bomber '852' at Soesterberg, in 1938 (Nederlands Instituut voor Militaire Historie).\n\nFokker G.1 Mercury '302' at Soesterberg in 1939 (NIMH)\n\nDouglas DB-8A/3N's at Soesterberg, March 1940 .\n\nMap of Soesterberg, on the eve of World War II (10 May 1940, image via Peter van Kaathoven).\n\nAt the beginning of World War II the German force's blitzkrieg overran the country in five days, and Soesterberg was occupied by the German Luftwaffe on 15 May 1940. They built three hardened runways in addition to a large dispersal area to the north, a small dispersal area on the northwest side and a large dispersal area on the east side of the airfield.\n\nAllied map of Soesterberg Air Base in 1942 (NIMH)\n\nA variety of German aircraft was stationed there during the war, initially flying missions during the Battle of Britain, and later to practice bombing missions on nearby ranges and provide fighter defence against Allied bombing missions.\n\nFrom 1944 onwards, Allied Air Forces caused enormous damage to the airfield by bombing it relentlessly. By September 1944 the Luftwaffe acknowledged Soesterberg airfield to be more or less useless. Still, what had not been destroyed by Alllied raids the Germans managed to destroy in the final months of the war.\n\nThe result of an Allied air strike on Soesterberg in March 1944 by B-26 Marauder bombers (Soestercourant)\n\nDornier Do217s prepare for takeoff during the German occupation of Soesterberg\n\nAerial reconnaissance photo showing the damage to Soesterberg Air Base on 9 February 1945.

The air base got an Air Defense tasking, and the first jet fighters of the Netherlands found their way to Soesterberg.\n\nKLM Douglas C-54 Skymaster PH-TSA (ex-NGAT NL-540, ex-USAAF 42-72293) thundering over the 09 runway, ca. 1950.

Against all US policy the squadron was to be placed under daily operational command of the Royal Netherlands Air Force.\n\nAs a result of the stationing, the airbase was expanded to the east to make use of the single German-built flattened marguerite-like dispersal area and a longer NATO standard runway.\n\nThe parkings in the dispersal aera went by three names: The area that later became the 334 Sqn platform was known as 'Near-East'. The semi-marguerite became 'Middle East', and the area to the extreme east became the 'Far East'.\n\nThe bilateral agreement only covered the stationing of one squadron, althoug a second squadron was discussed. The offer for the second squadron was turned down however, when the Dutch government realised that the second squadron would only be stationed at Soesterberg in peace time. Under threat of war they would be taken from daily operational control by the Dutch and deployed elsewhere. The squadron brought F-86 Sabres of the 512 FIS with them, but 512FIS was soon redesignated 32 Fighter Day Squadron.\n\nThe arrival of the first F-86 Sabres of the 512th FIS -led by '52-5384'/'FU-384'- at Soesterberg Air Base (NIMH)\n\nAfter only one year after their arrival, they traded in their F-86 Sabres for F-100 Super Sabres and were redesinated 32 Fighter quadron, with the squadron enlarged to 24 aircraft. In 1960 the 'Huns' were replaced with F-102 Delta Daggers, redesignating the squadron to 32 Fighter Interceptor Squadron. In 1968 it became 32 Tactical Fighter Squadron with the arrival of the F-4E Phantom-II. The F-4s were relieved by 4 models (A,B,C and D) of the F-15 Eagle, which remained in service until the unit was disbanded in 1994.\n\nairfield spectators at Soesterberg, watching from the Van Weerden-Poelmanweg, just north of the \"Middle East\" dispersal area in 1956.\n\nResident aircraft and squadron members of -left to right- 700Sqn (RNLAF), 32FIS (USAFE) and 322Sqn (RNLAF) join for a photo at Soesterberg in 1958 ( Nederlands Instituut voor Militaire Historie).\n\nSoesterberg AB in 1960.

It was almost new when this photo was taken, having been delivered on 1 Dec 1966 and allocated to 50th Tactical Fighter Wing (USAFE) at Hahn AB (Germany) later that month. She went to 78th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 81st Tactical Fighter Wing, RAF Bentwaters, Suffolk (UK) in 1969. From there it went to 78th Tactical Fighter Squadron RAF Woodbridge UK, in June 1969 and on to 401st Tactical Fighter Wing (USAFE) Torrejon AB Spain.\n\nWhen it's active Air Force carreer was over, she transferred to the 184th Tactical Fighter Group (Kansas ANG) at McConnell AFB, Jan 1980. In 1986 she came on strength with the 147th Fighter Interceptor Group 111FTS (Texas ANG) Ellington ANGB. Ultimately, she was flown to and stored at AMARC (todays' AMARG) as FP426 on 12 January 1990. Her flying days over, she seemed destined to become a spares source, like so many other aircraft at AMARC.\n\nHowever: this Phantom was not done yet. In February 1997 she was taken out of the desert to be transferred to the Collings Foundation in October 1998 and she was returned to flying status as N749CF in August 1999. Repainted to replicate the Phantom Capt Steve Ritchie had used to achieve his fifth kill in Vietnam and based at Ellington Field, Houston(TX), Gen. Ritchie would take the aircraft to selected venues around the country as part of the Vietnam Memorial Flight until 2007. She was then repainted to match '63-7680'/'FP', the F-4C flown by Colonel Robin Olds on Operation Bolo. The Collings Foundation F-4D Phantom II was still active at the time this text was written.\n\nConvair F-102A Delta Dagger of the 32 FIS (USAF), reg. 0-60977, on the platform.

While the map may seem remarkable, it is important to know that during the Cold War, Soviet (and other Warsaw Pact) airlines were not as limited in their movements in European airspace as western aircraft were in Eastern Europe. Still, the map does contain errors, some of them very obvious. For instance: the railway line west of the airbase (thick black line) did not exist since 1972. At the point where it crosses the A-28 highway a bridge was built, which for years was rumoured to contain the DPO/NATO fuel line to Soesterberg. Although technically possible (it is hollow), it did not (in Dutch).

In 1959, the 32d received the signature \"Royal\", the crown and wreath of the Dutch Royal Family (the House of Orange) were added to the emblem, giving it its unique look. This unique honour was granted in recognition of the unit's contribution to the defence of the Netherlands, and graphically illustrates the 32d's close ties with the Royal Netherlands Air Force. 32TFS had the unique distinction of being the only unit in the USAF whose emblem included the royal crest of another nation. This addition was only authorised as long as 32TFS remained in the Netherlands. The stand down ceremony of 32FW/32FS on 19 April 1994 was held in the presence of members of the house of Orange.\n\nAll-white Fokker F.27 Troopship 'C-11' on the Soesterberg platform in 1993 (Photo: collection Nederlands Instituut voor Militaire Historie).\n\nSoesterberg, ca. 1992 (Terraserver, via Soesterberg.net).\n\nNearing the end of their careers in the early 1990s, many of the F.27s were painted white for UN missions, like this example at Soesterberg (Photo: collection Nederlands Instituut voor Militaire Historie).\n\nThe F-15A(MSIP)s of the 32nd Fighter Squadron commander and the 32nd Fighter Group commander pass over Camp New Amsterdam, the \"American\" side of Soesterberg Air Base, sometime in 1993 (NIMH)\n\nThe final three F-15s (two F-15A MSIPs and a single F-15B MSIP) at Soesterberg left the airfield for the USA on 13 january 1994. They can be seen taxying to the runway. After take off the three did a formation flight over the airfield accompanied by RNLAF F-16s as a farewell to their home for 40 years. 32FS officially stood down 3 months later.

At the time, the Alouettes were expected to be withdrawn before the end of the century. Events would take a different turn however, and with the exception of the lead helicopter (A-253, which went into storage at the Millitaire Luchtvaart Museum), this formation (center row A-275, A-292, rear row A-247 and A-301) soldiered on until 2016, although they were upgraded to SA316B helicopters in 2014 and painted dark blue to reflect their new non-combat support role (NIMH)\n\nIn addition to the Americans (who referred to Soesterberg AB as 'Camp New Amsterdam' in honour of the first Dutch settlers in 'New Amsterdam', present day New York) the Royal Netherlands Air Force had continued to use Soesterberg. They based jets, helicopters and transport aircraft at the air base. Their jets left in the 1960s and the transport aircraft left in the early 1990s.\n\nFinally in late 2008, after all the helicopter units had moved to Gilze-Rijen, a final ceremony was held to close the air base for good. The last jet aircraft to leave the base was a Greek F-4E Phantom, and the base formally closed on 31 December. Upon its closure in 2008 Soesterberg was the oldest active airfield in the Netherlands, and one of the oldest in the world. For much of its history (almost 40 years) the air base was linked to the United States Air Force, holding a front line squadron of jet fighters at the base.\n\nFormer 32FS operations room, which still existed just before the airfield closed (SlobberinWolfhounds.com).\n\nOne of the tabvees when the airbase was still active (2006-2007?) (SlobberinWolfhounds.com).\n\nPart of the base is still in use as a glider field. The rest of the airfield is under conversion: part (the 'American side') will be restored as a nature preserve, although some HASes will remain, another part (the 'Dutch side' with the Group Helicopters hangars) will become the new Netherlands Defense Museum. Runway 09/27 will remain, to remind the people of the old air base.\n\nUSAF C-17A Globemaster III at Soesterberg in 2007 (Ton Vogels, via Panoramio).\n\nSoesterberg, around 2006. Clearly visible is the original NATO semi-marguerite dispersal on the east side of the airfield. Somewhere between 1990 and this photo Soesterberg lost the use of runway 13/31 The outline of the old third runway can also still be seen, it ran from the end of runway 13 over the 09/27 into the later 32FG dispersal area (Bing maps).\n\nView down the Soesterberg 09/27 runway, March 2011 (RonaldV.nl)."
