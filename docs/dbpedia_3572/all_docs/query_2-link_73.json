        "text": "With a 50-year track record of innovation, technological firsts and industry milestones, Airbus is a leader in designing, manufacturing and delivering aerospace products, services and solutions to a customer base that spans the globe – with operations for commercial aircraft, helicopters, defence, space and security.\n\nTake a journey through some of the highlights of our company from the past 50 years, and learn more about Airbus’ continuing success story with the extensive 'History In Depth' pages below.\n\n1960s | Laying the foundations\n\n1965\n\nThe SA330 Puma performed its first flight\n\nThis medium-weight twin-engine was the first of a long series that has been built in various versions down to the present day.\n\n1968\n\nFirst flight of the Gazelle SA341\n\nThe second prototype of the Gazelle (SA 341) made its first flight on 12 April 1968, and featured a Fenestron tail rotor fairing.\n\n1969\n\nConcorde takes off on its 1st flight in Toulouse\n\nCommercial aviation took a supersonic leap into the future with Concorde’s maiden flight, which was captained by André Turcat.\n\n29 May 1969\n\nOfficial launch of the Airbus A300 Programme\n\nThe A300 programme was launched with a milestone agreement signed by French Transport Minister Jean Chamant and German Economics Minister Karl Schiller at the 1969 Paris Airshow, to build a commercial aircraft that was smaller, lighter and more economical than its three-engine American rivals.\n\nTrailblazing pioneers\n\nRoger Béteille\n\nRoger Béteille was a key figure at Airbus from 1967 to 1985 – and a driving force behind the A300 programme, serving initially as a Technical and Coordinating Manager, and becoming Managing Director in 1975.\n\nA large part of the company’s initial success can be traced back to Béteille: a believer in European cooperation, he joined Airbus still in its “preliminary” stage. Béteille’s first proposal of work-sharing (to have aircraft parts such as elements of the fuselage, the wing root and the wings produced by different entities) is still in place today. Béteille’s involvement in the A300 programme ensured the aircraft would match the needs of airline customers, and not just manufacturers’ ideas. Béteille retired from the company in 1985; the final assembly building for the Airbus A350 XWB in Toulouse is named after him.\n\nRené Mouille\n\nRené Mouille was pivotal in pushing the helicopter industry forward and garnered a collection of groundbreaking inventions to his name.\n\nHe is at the origin of the design for the SE3120 (Alouette I) and the SE 3130 Alouette II (the first turbine helicopter), and the Alouette III in 1958; the Super Frelon in 1962; the Puma in 1964; the Gazelle in 1967; and the Dauphin and Ecureuil in the 1970s. In 1963, he was nominated Engineer-in-Chief of the helicopter division of Sud Aviation. With over 40 patents to his name, Mouille was instrumental in pushing the barriers of helicopter technology, such as with the hub NAT (Non-Articulated Drag) with visco-elastic dampers, as well as the famous Fenestron© shrouded tail rotor and the Starflex main rotor. He also invented the SARIB suspension system. The inventions by Mouille and his collaborators are still widely used in the helicopter industry today.\n\nLudwig Bölkow\n\nAn innovator of the aeronautical industry in Germany, Ludwig Bölkow created the Bölkow GmbH in Ottobrunn, which developed into the biggest aeronautics and spaceflight company in the country, MBB (Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm).\n\nMBB was an aerospace manufacturer that was later bought by Deutsche Aerospace AG, which is now part of Airbus. Bölkow was the key figure in the design of the world's first jet fighter, the Me 262, and was leading the rebuilding of the German aviation industry following the Second World War. Bölkow was awarded the Ludwig-Prandtl-Ring from the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Luft- und Raumfahrt (German Society for Aeronautics and Astronautics) for \"outstanding contribution in the field of aerospace engineering\" in 1972. He was awarded a Gold Medal by the British Royal Aeronautical Society in 1978.\n\n1970s | European Collaboration\n\n1970\n\nAirbus Industrie was officially created as a GIE\n\nFrance’s Aerospatiale (a merger of SEREB, Sud Aviation and Nord Aviation), and Germany’s Deutsche Airbus – a grouping of four firms.\n\n1971\n\nFirst flight of C-212 Aviocar\n\nDeveloped by Airbus predecessor CASA, the C212 has been used in charter and short-haul cargo roles, for search and rescue missions, and various military applications.\n\n1972\n\nFirst flight of the SA360 Dauphin\n\nThe Dauphin was originally designed as the successor to the Alouette III and was to be called the \"Business Alouette\".\n\n1972\n\nThe world's first twin engine wide-body aircraft\n\nThe first flight of the A300 took place in Toulouse on 28 October 1972, a month ahead of schedule despite several delays due to bad weather.\n\n1973\n\nAn odyssey across South and North America\n\nA300 embarks on a six-week sales expedition across North and South America to show off Airbus’ new creation to customers, pilots and executives.\n\n1974\n\nHelios-A and Helios-B, launched in 1974 and 1976\n\nHelios-A and Helios-B were the first space probes produced outside of the U.S. and the Soviet Union to leave Earth orbit, with their launches in 1974 and 1976.\n\n1974\n\nA300B2 enters regular service for Air France\n\nInitial commercial flights for Air France were from Paris to London.\n\n1974\n\nFirst flight of the Tornado\n\nThe MRCA prototype, later known as the Tornado, took its maiden flight at Manching.\n\n1978\n\nEastern Airlines, Airbus' first US customer, orders 23 A300B4 aircraft\n\nAfter the breakthrough agreement with Eastern Airlines, there followed a series of orders that confirmed Airbus as a serious contender in the global aircraft manufacturing industry.\n\n1979\n\nFirst flight of BK 117\n\nThe precursor to the EC145, the BK117 was a 50:50 joint venture by MBB and Kawasaki.\n\n1980s | New stars are born\n\n1982\n\nCockpit advances\n\nDelivery of the first A300 FFCC jetliner version, received by Indonesian airline Garuda, incorporating the Forward-Facing Crew Cockpit configuration, which enabled a two-pilot crew to fly the aircraft without the need for a flight engineer.\n\n1983\n\nSpacelab starts its journey into space\n\nSpacelab, built in Bremen by MBB-Erno as prime contractor, starts its first journey into space on board the Columbia space shuttle.

Pierson championed the spirit of Airbus which summed up the organisation’s essence from its beginnings to the present day: “The determination of the partners to keep the damaging demons of intra-European rivalry at bay was a key factor in the success of Airbus Industrie. It is in the interests of Europe that this determination should prevail. If there could be one lesson…it would be that co-operation is the key to prosperity and that there simply is room no more for narrow nationalistic endeavours.”\n\n1990s | Expanding frontiers\n\n1991\n\nArrival of the A340\n\nThe ultra long-range four engined A340-300, able to seat 295 in a three-class configuration and fly 7,150 nautical miles/13,200 kilometres, was rolled out in October, 1991.\n\n1992\n\nMaiden flight of the medium to long-range A330\n\nCarrying 335 passengers in two classes, the A330 marked another milestone with the first Rolls-Royce engine – the Trent 700 - on an Airbus aircraft.\n\n1994\n\nFirst flight of the Eurofighter\n\nThe extremely capable, flexible and versatile swing-role front-line fighter aircraft flew for the first time.\n\n1994\n\nMaiden flight of the EC135\n\nThe first helicopter in the Eurocopter range and successor to the BO108.
