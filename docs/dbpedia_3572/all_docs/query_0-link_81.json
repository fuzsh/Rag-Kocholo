        "text": "Omaha and Utah Beaches 6 June 1944\n\nBy Hank Schrader, USMA ’71, Europe Destination & Europe River Cruise Expert\n\nAnne Schrader, Certified Travel Counselor & Certified Luxury Cruise Specialist\n\nwww.dreamdestinations.com\n\nI first published this in 2020. With the 80th Anniversary of that horrible day which changed history, and so many suvivors who will sadly not be here much longer, I hope this is a fitting tribute to those brave souls who helped liberate Europe. May we never forget!\n\nIn November 1943, the Big Three (Roosevelt, Stalin and Churchill) agreed in a conference in Tehran, that the Allied Western Forces of the United States and Britain would invade France in 1944 and open a second front against the German Fortress Europe.\n\nThe clock was now ticking for the D Day invasion of France. It was a race between German defenders and the Allied invasion force.\n\nThe ideal strategy was simple for the planners of the D Day amphibious invasion—attack lightly defended beaches, secure the beach, and move men and supplies quickly inland. Next, establish or capture a port quickly to reinforce with more men and supplies. Then, defeat the German forces and win the war.\n\nExecuting it proved to be one of the most difficult military tasks every attempted.\n\nDuring the massive planning operations, Pas du Calais (the most favorable landing site) and Normandy were under consideration. Both had enough good characteristics to work for an amphibious landing. But Normandy was the best choice for two reasons. There were: 1) in 1943 it was a lightly defended part of the German Atlantic Wall and 2) the Germans anticipated an attack at Pas du Calais and fortified it and constantly moved more soldiers into defensive positions.\n\nThe German Defenders\n\nThe Germans realized they weren’t prepared to properly defend the vast Atlantic Wall in 1943. The German commander, General Gerd von Rundstedt, drafted a report to Hitler about the scant fortifications and poor quality units defending the area. Hitler responded by adding General Erwin Rommel (known popularly as the “Desert Fox” for his Africa campaign) to oversee improving the defenses.\n\nThe Germans knew an invasion was coming—they just didn’t know where or when. The choice that the Germans believed the Allies would select was an invasion of Pas de Calais, as it was the most logical invasion site—only 20 miles from England and had 20 miles of good landing beaches. The allies bolstered that illusion by creating a fake force under the command of LTG George Patton, complete with fake equipment, field barracks and even a docking area near Dover. They relentlessly bombed the Calais area in the build-up phase, as well as other targets in France. In an unusual operation, they also dropped dummies by parachutes, to harass and confuse the Germans.\n\nField Marshal Rommel was also convinced Calais was the prime invasion site and deployed the 208,000 man 15th Army to defend this area. The deception plan of D Day was working as hoped for the Allies.\n\nThe first priority for the Germans was protecting the major harbors, as any invading forces would need constant supplies, more men and equipment.\n\nAfter securing these major ports, they then began building “Widerstandnesten” (resistance nests) along the beaches. These were a series of pillboxes, gun positions, anti-aircraft weapons and trenches. The beaches were littered with obstacles, mines (over 4 million mines) to enhance these resistance nests. Inland, flooded lowlands and stakes were planted in the ground to cut into gliders during landings and make possible airborne landing zones potential death traps.\n\nA key concept for the Germans was to stop the invasion on the beaches, so all defensive resources were placed at or near the beach areas and no defense in depth was planned. There were reserve units to stop breakthroughs but the best reserve unit of panzer tanks could only be released by Hitler. If the Allies could breach these tough defenses, and cut off the reserve forces, they had a good chance of success.\n\nBy June 1944 all the beaches used for the D Day landings in Normandy had at least some of these defensive measures in places.\n\nUnknown to the allies, the best defended beach in Normandy was Omaha.\n\nThe stage was set for that fateful day 6 June 1944.\n\nConcept of the Overlord Operation\n\nYou might be surprised to know the last successful armed assault across the English Channel happened in 1066 (yes, the famous Battle of Hastings). 8 centuries later, this was about to change.\n\nAmphibious landings are complex operations. Trying to attack with 5 divisions over a 50 mile front in Normandy from a base in England would require naval forces, air forces and army units from British, Canadian and American forces. The allied armies and massive equipment needed to ensure success only added to the complexity. 150,000 soldiers would be required, with a fleet of 5,333 ships and an air armada of over 12,921 planes.\n\nSynchronizing an operation of this size remains one of the most amazing military feats in the history of the world.\n\nAn Overview of the Invasion\n\nOn the beach, 270 desperate engineer soldiers were trying to open 16 pathways for the tanks to get off the beach from the obstacles. They had 27 minutes to achieve their mission according to the plan; only 1 pathway is opened on time. Most of the engineers are dead or wounded by the end of their 27 minute first mission.\n\nThe landing waves continued. Rifle and machinegun bullets constantly flew around; mortar and artillery shells rained down; explosions, screams, destroyed and abandoned equipment and vehicles litter the beaches (especially the destroyed burning tanks); and confusion was everywhere. The only reasons most survived was there was just too many of them for the Germans to shoot everyone and the heavy smoke that offered some concealment to the exposed soldiers.\n\nWithout tank support, the original plan to take the heavily fortified draws was not a good option for soldiers only armed with light weapons.\n\nAt 0730, several hundred surviving soldiers were huddled against the seawall, and the outlook was bleak. Most of their leaders had been killed or wounded.\n\nIn the west, Brigadier General Norman “Dutch” Cota, assistant division commander of the 29th Division, landed in the second wave and sprinted to the wall around 0730. As he rallied the soldiers, he realized going up the draws, according to the original plan wouldn’t work. The only good option was to climb the less defended bluffs. He would be awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his superb leadership and personal bravery for rallying the disorgananized soldiers pinned down on Omaha Beach.\n\nHe found a group of rangers, led by LTC Max Schneider (commander of the 5th Ranger Battalion) and told them of his plan and then yelled out “Rangers Lead the Way”, which has become the official ranger moto. Within an hour, the rangers and soldiers from the 29th reached the top. The German defenses were oriented to the sea and Cota’s growing band of soldiers captured the Vierville draw (D-1) about 2 hours later by attacking them from their rear. It took the engineer soldiers 8 hours to clear the Vierville draw of mines and other obstacles.\n\nThe beach head was still an intense killing zone at about 0830. Several thousand soldiers were stranded and easy targets for the Germans. A frustrated destroyer skipper (Lt. Commander Ralph Ramey), defied his orders, steamed his destroyed as close as possible and began to blast the cliffs with his 5 inch guns. Soon, all the other destroyers followed. Within 30 minutes, they had destroyed 6 gun emplacements. The tide was turning. With less effective fire raining down on the trapped men, leaders began moving soldiers up the bluffs and into the draws. The crowded beaches were slowly clearing.\n\nWith men still vulnerable on the beach, and landing craft prohibited from landed more soldiers as there was no space, soldiers were trying to fight their way off the killing zone. In 2 hours of intense fighting, by 1100, the beach started to clear up as the men were making progress against the Germans. Some landing craft commanders again defied orders and started to land more troops. These soldiers and equipment were still under fire, but it was not as intense as at 0630. The reinforcements help rally all in harm’s way--momentum now was on the American side.\n\nBy 1300, Gen. Bradley, who had considered abandoning Omaha and land the remaining soldiers at Utah, received a message that troops who had been previously pinned down on the beach were moving up the heights behind the beach area. Victory now seemed possible.\n\n3 hours later, the Colleville Draw was in American hands. Now three of the four draws were under American control. Not until about 2000, would the 4th draw, Les Moulins, be captured.\n\nOur Final Thoughts\n\nD Day was a success but what really stands out to me is the resolve of the soldiers, sailors and airmen who made the operation work. Heroic, innovative and resourceful, these military forces should be honored for their deeds. They did not really see themselves as heroes--most just wanted to live to see 7 June 1944.\n\nThe war’s end would not come for 336 days of more combat. It would have never happened so soon, if these forces had not taken the first step on 6 June 1944 that ultimately ended the German occupation of Europe.\n\nWe have led two tours in Normandy in 2014 and 2019 and those experiences have made this operation much more real for me. We owe a debt of gratitude to these folks—their sacrifice and courage will stay with me for the rest of my life.\n\nIf you have never been to Normandy and seen the D Day Beaches, I would encourage you to go.\n\nWe are travel experts, ocean and river cruise experts, and Europe destination experts.

Col James Rudder led 225 men in an assault on the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc.\n\nBut to understand this superb combat unit, we must return to the days of 1943, where Rudder formed the Rangers. The 2nd Ranger Battalion was activated on April 1, 1943 at Camp Forrest, Tullahoma, Tennessee. They were volunteer units. Each soldier had to possess superb physical qualities and sharp mental skills. They also trained in Florida. Each ranger became skilled in all types of weapons, hand-to-hand combat and handling difficult terrain. The unit was deployed to Scotland next. Here they trained on scaling cliffs and trained with British Commandos.\n\nThe rangers were organized into 6 line companies, A to F per battalion sized units. Each company consisted of 65 men and 3 officers. The companies were organized into 2 platoons.\n\nThe Plan\n\nThe plan was for part of the 2nd Ranger Battalion to assault the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc at 0630 and take possession of the German position by 0700. This group was named Force A.\n\nForce A had 3 ranger companies in the task organization. Company D was to scale the cliffs from the west; Companies E and F were to scale the cliffs from the east. They would then destroy the cannons once on top of Pointe du Hoc. After destroying the weapons, they were to establish a defensive perimeter on Pointe du Hoc and prevent the Germans from moving reinforcements down the coastal highway that connected Grandcamp and Vierville.\n\nThe rangers were to hold the ground until relieved by the 116th Infantry Division. Relief was scheduled for noon on 6 June 1944.\n\nForce B, Charlie Company of the 2nd Rangers, was to assault and capture the area on the far right flank of the Omaha Beach on exit D-1. Their objective was Pointe de la Percée.\n\nForce C, was comprised of the entire 5th Ranger Battalion, along with A and B companies of the 2nd Rangers. Here were their missions:\n\n1). If the initial landing force failed, Force C was designated to assault and capture Pointe du Hoc, by landing at Omaha and moving inland to take Pointe du Hoc.\n\nOr\n\n2) If the mission of Force A was successful, they were scheduled to also land at Pointe du Hoc as reinforcements, assuming the objective was taken by 0700.\n\nA Landing that Started Off Wrong\n\nAt 0445 the rangers of Force A were loaded into landing crafts that held 22 men per landing craft. The men and supplies were loaded into 10 landing craft and 4 DUKW's amphibious vehicles. As they approached the beachhead, they were 3 miles off course, and LTC Rudder realized the error—they were headed to Pointe de la Percée, the objective of Force B.\n\nThe landing craft had to travel exposed broadside back to the correct landing site instead of only the front exposed to direct enemy fire. By the time they arrived at the objective, 1 landing craft and 2 DUKW’s were sunk.\n\nThey were due to start their assault at 0630, but the currents and navigation errors delayed the landing until 0710. Since the plan called for the assault to begin at 0630, the naval bombardment stopped at 0625. This allowed the Germans to regroup and take up some defensive positions.\n\nThe Germans, however, were slow to reorganize, and this aided the assault.\n\nThe first landing crafts made it to Pointe du Hoc at 0710. Their landing area was only 30 yards wide and the tide was rising. There was no time to assault from both the west and east sides of Pointe du Hoc—they all had to go up the cliffs from the east side.\n\nSome equipment was not useable. The 75-foot mechanized ladders mounted on the amphibious vehicles couldn’t get into positions to be used—it was too slippery for the tracks to get into position (there were only 2 available as they were transported by the DUKW’s and 2 were already sunk). They had lost ammo supplies. Ropes, men, radios and all their other equipment were soaked.\n\nThe only thing in their favor—the intense shelling and bombing had caused some of the cliff face to collapse into rubble piles. In a few places, the climb would only be 60 feet.\n\nThe rangers were going to scale the cliffs under their own power using ropes and rope ladders.\n\nOver the Top and Success of Force A\n\nScaling the cliffs was one of the most impressive military feats ever successfully accomplished by a US unit in combat. Companies D, E and F landed and scaled the cliffs by using rocket-fired grappling hooks attached to ropes. They developed the scaling techniques primarily by trial and error during their training sessions. Their training was intense and it paid off—under pressure and enemy fire these soldiers responded, despite incredible odds against their success.\n\nThe landing problems resulted in an assault only from the east side of Pointe du Hoc. Some of the soaked ropes didn’t reach the top, but finally some worked correctly. They only had 15 casualties in the initial assault. The German defenders cut ropes, threw potato mashers and fired on the exposed soldiers. The rangers countered with mortar fire and small arms fire at the German positions above. Also 2 US destroyers fired their guns effectively at the cliff side German defenders.\n\n5 minutes after landing, some rangers were already on top of the cliffs. Within 15 minutes of landing, the majority of Rudder’s assault force had made it on top of Pointe du Hoc.\n\nOnce up top, small groups of rangers went off to accomplish their missions. They were stunned by the results of the bombardments—one soldier said it looked like the craters of the moon. It looked nothing like the mock-ups and photos of the site.\n\nMeanwhile, Force B (Company C, of the 2nd Ranger Battalion) was assaulting at Omaha and later would capture Pointe de la Percée. Their landing was at Charlie (farthest western sector of Omaha) on Omaha Beach, at 0645 in the second landing wave. They landed after Company A, 116th Regiment was being torn apart on Dog Green (now more famously known as the Bedford Boys, as 19 from the town in VA were killed in the D Day assault on 6 June). They too came under intense fire from 3 Widerstandnesten or Wn (resistance nests) defensive positions, Wn 71, Wn 72 and Wn 73. They fought their way to the seawall.\n\nThere were two possible plans for Force B. If the D-1 Draw was clear, move up the draw and attack Pointe de la Percée and eliminate Wn 74 (plan 1). Plan 2 was to climb up the cliffs (the worst option).\n\nForce B lacked most of the specialized climbing gear that was allocated to Force A. With the draw not yet captured, the only option was climb the cliffs. Hugging the cliffs, they found a section to climb. PFC Otto Stephens climbed first, using his bayonet to dig hand holds. He and 2 other rangers established a rope for the remaining rangers, so they would be able to climb up.\n\nThe situation was so bad on Omaha, that the Force B commander, Captain Goranson, decided he had no other option than to attack Wn 73 and then proceed to attack Wn 74 on Pointe de la Percée. This turned out to be a great combat decision—Wn 73 was a really effective fighting position and Wn 74 was primarily a radar position, guarded by 2 anti-aircraft guns and several machinegun nests.\n\nOnly 29 of his 64 Rangers were able to fight—the rest were killed or wounded. The remaining 29 men began slowly clearing the trenches of Wn 73. They were later joined with 20 soldiers from 116th who also climbed the ropes. All worked together, clearing the trenches, to eliminate their lethal machinegun nests and other defensive positions.\n\nAt around 1400, Captain Goranson, after leading the men to clear the German defensive positions and block German reinforcements, led a patrol to Pointe de la Percée. He found it abandoned, with the defensive positions Wn 74 destroyed by naval fire as they approached. He returned to link up with Force C. Around night fall, Force B had only 12 men able to fight.\n\nForce C\n\nForce C was reluctantly waiting off shore, hoping to reinforce LTC Rudder and Force A at Pointe du Hoc. The soldiers bobbed up and down in the rough seas. There was no signal received by the Battalion Commander, LTC Max Schneider, from Force A—he had ordered his landing crafts to lay-to offshore. Schneider knew how important it was to reinforce Force A at Pointe du Hoc.\n\nThere was no more time left; at 0740 six landing crafts with the rangers landed at Omaha beach at Dog White. They were met with intense fire. LTC Schneider, the only ranger officer with combat experience, moved the rest of the force to landing zone Dog Red. This was a pivotal decision during the early phases of the invasion landings at Omaha. He managed to get most of his force intact over the exposed 200 yards to the seawall—brush fires helped obscure the defenders from accurate fire upon his landing unit.\n\nGetting a well-trained, elite unit almost intact to relative safety was a key factor in the fight for Omaha.\n\nShortly thereafter, he met up with BG Cota, Executive Officer of the 29th Division. It is here where Cota, urging the men off the beach, yelled out “Rangers lead the way!” They made it up the bluffs and probably were the key reason in the 29th Division sector succeeded in accomplishing their mission in taking their assigned sector of Omaha beach. LTC Schneider led his men through the obstacles, past the barbed wire and up the cliffs. They continued the assault to their initial objective near Vierville and later linked up with the remainder of Force B. They had been in almost 10 hours of constant combat.\n\nHowever, they were badly shot up and could not effectively reinforce Rudder’s men at Pointe du Hoc on 6 June 1944 but they still wanted to try. Key leaders denied them the chance on 6 June 1944. The 29th Division had lost so many men, it needed the rangers to help defend the small beach head positions inland. Despite LTC Schneider’s pleas to go reinforce the stranded rangers, he was ordered to stay and help defend the beach head.\n\n3 ranger companys at Pointe du Hoc were not as important as securing Omaha—a tough but correct command decision.\n\nHanging On at Pointe du Hoc\n\nRudder had signaled that he had landed late and taken Pointe du Hoc, but the message was garbled and not understood by the commanders at sea. They committed the reserve rangers (Force C) to land at Omaha beach. By the time he communicated success, and ask for help, the reply was “no reinforcements”.\n\nRudder’s group was now on their own.\n\nLater that day, the Germans started their counterattacks. By night fall, Rudder’s men were forced back into defensive positions in a small 200 yard perimeter.\n\nAt 2100, 1st platoon of A Company, who had been unable to link up with the rest of the 5th Ranger Bn., had fought their way to Ponte du Hoc and linked up with Rudder’s men, with a force of 23 soldiers. They would be his only reinforcements on 6 June.\n\nBy 7 June, Rudder had a fighting force of fewer of 100 of the original 225 who had begun the assault. Ammunition and food were running low. He did get some reinforcements from the sea. About 60 men from the 1st Platoon of Fox Company of the 5th Rangers and a dismounted cannon platoon, help reinforced Rudder’s men and evacuate some wounded soldiers.\n\nRudder held on until 8 June, when the 5th Rangers and men from the 29th Division finally linked up with his force. His men had withstood 5 counterattacks.\n\nThe Price for Victory\n\nThe 2nd Ranger Battalion (a total force of about 488) had 77 killed and 152 wounded and 38 listed as missing. At the time of the relief, Rudder’s original force of 225 had less than 75 men capable of fighting.\n\nRudder was wounded twice in the battle and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC). Thirteen other Rangers were awarded the DSC for their roles at Pointe du Hoc and the other ranger missions.\n\nThe 5th Ranger Battalion (again about 488 men, according to the Table of Organization & Equipment (TO&E)) had 23 men killed, 89 wounded and 2 missing.\n\nBoth the 2nd Ranger Bn. and the 5th Bn. were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation and the French Croix de Guerre.\n\nWW II Cemeteries and Monuments in Europe\n\nBy Hank Schrader, USMA ’71\n\nPhotos Anne Schrader, Army Wife\n\nwww.dreamdestinations.com\n\nIn a few days, it will be Memorial Day in 2024 on 26 May. I can think of no better way for Anne and I to share a little bit about the holiday and tell you about the final resting place of the fallen during the battles of WW II in Europe. I first wrote this in 2020 but it seems very important to send it out again in a revised form. May we all have a respectful Memorial Day, as this is our small tribute to those who made the ultimate sacrifice.\n\nThe Memorial Day holiday has its origins from the end of the US Civil War—it was originally called Decoration Day. Although the correct purpose of this holiday is to recognize those who actually died while on active service, for most American it also includes those who served their country and have passed on. I know I personally honor my Dad on Memorial Day, even though he did not die on active duty but later in life after his retirement.\n\nWW II American Cemeteries and Monuments in Europe\n\nWe cannot think of a better way to recognize the courage and sacrifice made by our Armed Forces in World War II, than to tell you about the Cemeteries and Monuments dedicated to our Armed Forces in Europe.\n\nThere are 13 American cemeteries and 3 monuments in Europe. According to the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC), there are 89,033 soldiers honored in the 13 cemeteries. 73,177 are buried; 15,856 are listed as missing. There are 3 monuments maintained by the commission—one in England and 2 in Normandy, France.\n\nTo help us learn more about these tributes for our fallen and missing soldiers of WW II, I have organized this by country to help make their unbelievable sacrifice a little more understandable.\n\nThis is a hard blog to write—the sheer numbers are staggering. Despite this tragic tale, these places are dignified and respectful. It is like Arlington Cemetery where my father and mother are buried—they use similar markers for each deceased, regardless of rank, but each has his or her legacy engraved on the markers. Here is what a marker looks like in Arlington National Cemetery:\n\nAmerican Cemeteries in Belgium\n\nThere are 2 American Cemeteries in Belgium. The Ardennes American Cemetery contains 5,317 buried, with 65 percent of those being fallen airmen of the U.S. Army Air Forces. There are also tributes to the 463 reported missing in action. This cemetery served as the central identification point for all of the Europe Theater of Operations towards the end of the war and continued that mission of identification until 1960.\n\nThe Henri-Chapelle American Cemetery has 7,992 soldiers buried here and there is recognition for 450 missing in action. The majority of the fallen Americans are from two major efforts of WW II. The first battles were a result of the U.S. First Army's drive in September 1944 through northern France, Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg into Germany, and the second group of dead were from the Battle of the Bulge.\n\nThe American Cemetery in England\n\nCambridge American Cemetery is the only American Cemetery in England. The site was donated by Cambridge University. 3,812 are buried here; there is also tributes to the 5,127 reported missing in action. Most were crew members who died in the Battle of the Atlantic or in bombardments of Europe later in the war. In 2014, a visitor center was opened to help explain this critical phase of WW II. It even has a downloadable app to help visitors learn more about this vital war effort.\n\nAmerican Cemeteries in France\n\nThere are 6 American Cemeteries in France.\n\nThe Brittany American Cemetery is located near the eastern edge of Brittany. Here are buried 4,409 dead soldiers and there is recognition for 500 reported missing in action. Most of these military members died fighting in the Normandy and Brittany campaigns of 1944.\n\nThe Epinal American Cemetery is located near the Moselle River. It has 5,254 buried here, most of whom lost their lives in the drive by the 7th Army towards Germany in the northeastern portion of France. It also recognizes 424 missing in action.\n\nThe Lorraine American Cemetery contains the largest number of US soldiers killed in Europe—there are 10,489 buried here. Another 444 were reported missing in action and their names are listed on the plaques displayed here. Most of the dead here were killed while driving the German forces from the fortress city of Metz, France toward the Siegfried Line and the Rhine River.\n\nThe Normandy American Cemetery, perhaps the best known of all WW II cemeteries by Americans, is the final resting place for 9,385 killed and 1,557 reported missing during this campaign. It lies just yards from the Omaha Beach area. Walking this area is special—the rows of dignified markers honor these dead. It was the first cemetery established in Europe by the Americans. When I was walking this hallowed ground, it is a stark reminder of what it took to invade Europe—the sheer number of markers is just overwhelming.\n\nAnne and I led a tour here in 2014 for the 70th Anniversary of D Day (June 6, 1944) and a tour in 2019 for the 75th Anniversary. During the 2014 ceremonies, each gave site was marked with a small American and French flag. It was indeed memorable and touching and a fine tribute to our lost soldiers. Here are 3 pictures from our 2014 and 2019 tours:\n\nHonor and Integrity\n\nWest Point teaches us to become leaders of character. Many of us, and even our children and spouses often cite perhaps the best-known line of the Cadet Pray “Make us chose the harder right, instead of the easier wrong, and never to be content with a half truth when the whole can be won” as a great guiding principal of their lives.\n\nYou are always tested throughout an Army career, with chances to cut corners or just try to avoid the whole truth. Most of the time, it was just clear-cut—this is wrong regardless of the consequences.\n\nI once faced a very difficult decision as a new S-3 (Operations Officer). I was a major. On our first field training exercise, I had to develop an operations order (you military folks know this as the 5-paragraph operations order). I prepared the order, showed it to my Battalion Commander (an LTC) and he made some major revisions to clear up the instructions. He was an awesome ops guy—he took my correct instructions to all the units and made them textbook perfect. With the updated order, I then had to brief our Brigade Commander (Bde) about the plans.\n\nThe briefing went better than I could have expected, it was a sure homerun. Our Bde Commander then stated it was the “best op order he had ever heard” and praised me for writing such a great ops order. Without hesitation, I responded “Sir, this is not my work alone, my Bn Commander rewrote a lot of it.” In a highly competitive environment of field grade officers, this could have cost me a chance for promotion to LTC. I can never be sure, but that day forward there could be no doubt from anyone in the 7th Infantry Division (Light) I would not take credit for something I didn’t do or have help with.\n\nI know I made the right decision—the truth is always the proper path regardless of the consequences—I like to say, “bad news never gets better with age”.\n\nCourage\n\nCourage is a hard thing to define. Maybe it is a lack of fear, maybe it’s overcoming fear. I guess in some form it is confronting a difficult situation seeking a solution. The higher the difficulty of the situation (in the military we often refer to this as conditions), the resolve required for a successful outcome is a measure of courage. There is both mental courage and physical courage.\n\nThe Cadet prayer defines courage as “Endow us with courage that is born of loyalty to all that is noble and worthy, that scorns to compromise with vice and injustice and knows no fear when truth and right are in jeopardy.” This part of the prayer talks about the mental challenges of courage. It requires a lot of judgement to decide what is “noble and worthy” and excellent critical thinking skills.\n\nIt takes courage to assess what is wrong and fix it—we often don’t like confrontations. True leadership is making corrections and retraining to attain or surpass the desired outcomes. The result is a better trained unit and will ultimately save lives as a deterrent or in actual conflict. The right approach results in unit cohesion and superbly trained soldiers. On way I approached this was not to present problems to my superiors, but to present a problem and a possible solution. As you can imagine, it was a constant in my military career.\n\nAs a major (O 4), while the Chief of Investigations and Assistance of the 7th Infantry Division (Light), I routinely advised the 2-star Division Commander (0-8) about situations and violations of regulations. Most senior officers I had to confront were very receptive and appreciative to resolve problems before they became issues. I was not as fortunate with a One-star (07) who was incorrectly punishing a soldier and was not following the regulations for the situation. He refused to take my advice and berated me repeatedly—he felt it was his prerogative and I was not going to usurp his power or decisions. I calmly replied, “Sir, you can either take my advice, or you will receive a call from your 2-star commander who will order you to comply.” He refused. 20 minutes later, the 2-star commander called him and ordered him to comply.\n\nThis was about me taking power and decision making from superior officers—it was about doing what was right and following our written regulations, but it did require courage on my part to do what was right and confront a superior officer. You should realize that that is one way our Army is great—even high-ranking officers or senior enlisted are not above the regulations.\n\nWe know all about physical courage under fire. We often recognize these feats with medals—the Bronze Star with V device (Valor), the Silver Star, the Distinguished Service Cross, and the Medal of Honor and with combat badges. As the popular saying of today is, these heroes ran towards the sound of gunfire, not away from it.\n\nI always are in awe of these soldiers—I never served in an offical combat zone and respect and admire those who served and displayed courage under fire.\n\nMy hope in writing this blog is to recount how the events of the D Day invasion changed world history in Europe and in many ways shaped our present-day world. It is also to recognize the sacrifice of the soldiers, sailors, and airmen of the allies to stop the aggression and occupation of Europe by the Third Reich of Germany.\n\nOnce you understand the consequences of this day in history, I think you will be compelled to visit Normandy to see for yourself the area of conflict that these brave, scared souls achieved on that fateful day.\n\nThis was a history changing day, so let’s learn together about this massive invasion, why it was so important, and why you should see the key sights in the Normandy battlefield beaches area.\n\nWhat was the state of war in June 1944 in Europe?\n\nThe war was not going well for Germany in June 1944, as they were being pushed back on the Eastern Front by the Russian Army. They also knew that there was an invasion coming from England—they were defending one active front and trying to prepare for a second active front.\n\nIn November 1943, the Big Three (Roosevelt, Stalin, and Churchill) agreed in a conference in Tehran, that the Western Forces of the United States and Britain would invade France in 1944 and open a second front against the German Fortress Europe.\n\nThe clock was now ticking for the D Day invasion of France. It was a race between German defenders and the Allied invasion force.\n\nThe ideal strategy was simple for the planners of the D Day amphibious invasion—attack lightly defended beaches, secure the beach, and move men and supplies quickly inland.\n\nNext, establish or capture a port to reinforce with more men and supplies.\n\nThen, defeat the German forces and win the war.\n\nExecuting it proved to be one of the most difficult military tasks ever attempted.\n\nDuring the massive planning operations, Pas du Calais (the most favorable landing site) and Normandy were under consideration. Both had enough good characteristics to work for an amphibious landing. But Normandy was the best choice, 1) as in 1943 it was a lightly defended part of the German Atlantic Wall and 2) the Germans anticipated an attack at Pas du Calais and fortified it and moved more soldiers into defensive positions.\n\nThe German Defenders\n\nThe Germans realized they weren’t prepared to properly defend the vast Atlantic Wall in 1943. The German commander, General Gerd von Rundstedt, drafted a report to Hitler about the scant fortifications and poor-quality units defending the area. Hitler responded by adding General Erwin Rommel (known popularly as the “Desert Fox” for his Africa campaign) to oversee improving the defenses.\n\nThe Germans knew an invasion was coming—they just didn’t know where or when. The choice that the Germans believed the Allies would select was an invasion of Pas de Calais, as it was the most logical invasion site—only 20 miles from England and had 20 miles of good landing beaches.\n\nThe allies bolstered that illusion by creating a fake force under the command of LTG George Patton, complete with fake equipment, field barracks and even docking areas near Dover. They relentlessly bombed the Calais area in the build-up phase, as well as other targets in France.\n\nIn an unusual operation, they also dropped dummies by parachutes, to harass and confuse the Germans.\n\nA key concept for the Germans was to stop the invasion on the beaches, so all defensive resources were placed at or near the beach areas and no defense in depth was planned. There were reserve units to stop breakthroughs, but the best reserve unit of panzer tanks could only be released by Hitler. If the Allies could breach these tough defenses, and cut off the reserve forces, they would have a good chance of success.\n\nBy June 1944 all the beaches used for the D Day landings in Normandy had at least some of these defensive measures in places.\n\nUnknown to the allies, the best defended beach in Normandy was Omaha.\n\nThe stage was set for that fateful day 6 June 1944.\n\nConcept of the Overlord Operation\n\nYou might be surprised to know the last successful armed assault across the English happened in 1066 (yes, the famous Battle of Hastings). 8 centuries later, this was about to change.\n\nAmphibious landings are complex operations. Trying to attack with 5 divisions over a 50-mile front in Normandy, from a base in England, would require naval forces, air forces and army units from British, Canadian, and American forces. The allied armies and massive equipment needed to ensure success only added to the complexity. 150,000 soldiers would be required, with a fleet of 5,333 ships and an air armada of over 12,921 planes.\n\nSynchronizing an operation of this size remains one of the most amazing military feats in the history of the world.\n\nAn Overview of the Invasion\n\nOperation Overlord, the code name for the D Day invasion, was a complicated multipart attack. To soften up and destroy some of the defending German forces, the area was bombed for about 6 weeks prior to the invasion.\n\nOn the early morning hours of 6 June 1944, American and British paratroopers parachuted and later landed in gliders to secure the western flank (American forces) and the eastern flank (British forces).\n\nThen, prior to the start of the landings, a naval bombardment of about 30 minutes in duration started, followed by an aerial bombardment.\n\nNext, the amphibious landings took place on the 5 objective beaches. The 3 beaches in the British Second Army sector, were Gold, Juno, and Sword. They were attacked by British and Canadian units.\n\nThe 2 American beaches, under the U. S. First Army (commanded by Lt. General Omar Bradley), were Omaha and Utah\n\nReflecting on the Significance of D Day\n\nSome historians claim this was the most important day in the history of the last 100 years. The victory of the successful invasion was symbolic, strategic, and operationally sealed the fate of the Nazi regime. It would also change the course of world history.\n\nSymbolically, it put forces governed by democratic systems into the decisive ending of the war—essentially Russia and their totalitarian regime would not control all of Europe if the Western Allies had not invaded and Russia defeated the Germans alone.\n\nStrategically, the war in Europe expanded with a second front, and the resources of the American, British, and Canadian forces executed the “Germany First” political strategy to finish off the German Army and then on to defeat Japan in Asia.\n\nOperationally, it relieved pressure on Russia on the Eastern Front and required the Germans to defend with over 400,000 soldiers on a second front.\n\nThe result of the successful invasion made America a world power and led to the stability and wealth of future Europe. Totalitarianism was not going to be the model of all Western European countries, yet some would suffer under the rule of Russia’s Iron Curtain in the war’s aftermath. This ideological conflict would quickly develop into the Cold War after the end of World War II.\n\nD Day also was a key event in the global balance of power of nations. The resolve of the British in 1941 to return to the European continent was a crucial part of the conduct of the war prior to America entering into the conflict. After D Day and the conclusion of WW II, America emerged as the most powerful nation in the world, followed by Russia. Britain was the third most powerful nation. All 3 of these nations projected their influence on the world stage today, but it was especially true at the war’s end.\n\nUltimately, it ended in the Yalta conference with the Big Three to discuss the postwar reorganization of Europe. Despite promises by Stalin to allow democratic elections in territory such as Poland, he broke all his assurances of the agreement. The start of the Cold War was on.\n\nSo, Why Visit the Key D Day Sites\n\nStrategy and higher-level planning provide resources for an invasion of this magnitude, but it is the soldier on the ground that executes the planning. How they achieved their tasks, and the terrain can not be fully understood until you actually visit the site of the conflict.\n\nThere is probably no Europe battlefield as well preserved as the D Day landing areas and fighting sites in Normandy.\n\nHere are some sites we recommend you visit:\n\nPointe du Hoc\n\nPointe du Hoc is actually not changed much at all since 1944—the gun emplacements, the bomb craters, and the steep cliffs the rangers had to climb under intense fire, make their exploits come to life—how did they take this area given the natural defenses of this place? Those of us, who are ranger qualified like me, realize at best a 100-foot climb of a 90-degree slope to the top of the bluff peninsula with a full combat load of equipment would be a daunting physical challenge under any circumstances, but to do it under fire is a testament to the sheer bravery and intense training of the soldiers who accomplished this mission.\n\nI don’t think you can visit here and not feel that freedom is not free—it is earned by sacrifice.\n\nOur Final Thoughts\n\nD Day was a success but what really stands out to me is the resolve of the soldiers, sailors and airmen who made the operation work. Heroic, innovative and resourceful, these military forces should be honored for their deeds. They did not really see themselves as heroes--most just wanted to live to see 7 June 1944.\n\nThe war’s end would not come for 336 days of more combat. It would have never happened so soon, if these forces had not taken the first step on 6 June 1944 that ultimately ended the German occupation of Europe and opened a second front.\n\nHistory was made that day, as the future of Europe would require the Allies defeating the Germans. Europe changed from occupied lands and countries to some free democratic countries and some under communist control. Today’s Europe could have been quite different if the invasion had failed.\n\nWe have led two tours in Normandy in 2014 and 2019 and those experiences have made this operation much more real for me. We owe a debt of gratitude to these folks—their sacrifice and courage will stay with me for the rest of my life.\n\nIf you have never been to Normandy and seen the D Day Beaches, I would encourage you to go.\n\nWe are travel experts, ocean and river cruise specialists, and Europe destination experts.

Your journey begins here!\n\nThis is a departure from our usual blog about travel to help recognize the contribution of our Armed Forces to our Nation.\n\nAs many of you know, I served for 20 years as an Infantry officer and was proud to help defend our country.\n\nSo, I thought I would provide you some facts about today’s military in my humble salute to the men and women who defend our country and perhaps help you remember the service and sacrifice of those who defend our freedom.\n\nIt is probably best to start by explaining the major military recognition celebrations in America and then concentrate on the Armed Forces Day.\n\nThere is a lot of confusion to the exact purpose of three major recognition days for all US military members and former members. Armed Forces Day honors those currently serving in the military. Memorial Day honors those who have died while on duty in the military services. Veterans Day is a tribute to all who have previously served in our armed forces.\n\nArmed Forces Day is celebrated on the 3rd Saturday of May, as part of Armed Forces week. It honors the Army, the Air Force, the new Space Force, the Navy, the Marine Corps, and the Coast Guard.\n\nThe first 5 service branches are organized under the Department of Defense, while the Coast Guard is part of the Department of Homeland Security. There are more than 1.4 million on active service and more than 1.1 million national guard and reservists.\n\nIn 1949, Armed Forces Day was first established when the Army, Navy and Air Force were organized under the Department of Defense, instead of each service just marking their own individual recognition day. The Marines did not come under this initial new holiday, and keep their separate celebration. They later joined in. In 1961, Armed Forces Day became a National Holiday.\n\nEach year Armed Forces Day has a unique theme—some past themes are Dedication and Duty, Freedom and Patriotism.\n\nSome Interesting Facts About our Armed Forces\n\nThe Department of Defense (DOD) is the largest employer in the US—there are about 1.4 million on active duty, 1.1 million serving in National guard and Reserve units and 700,00 civilians working in the DOD.\n\nHere are the numbers of active duty—Army over 482,000; Navy over 343,000; Air Force over 328,000; Marine Corps over 179,000; Coast Guard over 44,000 and Space Force over 1,600.\n\nHere are the numbers of reserve forces—Army National Guard over 337,000; Army Reserve over 184,000; Air National Guard over 108,000, Air Force Reserve over 70,000, Navy Reserve over 57,000, Marine Corp Reserve over 35,000 and about 7,000 in the Coast Guard Reserve..\n\n31 of 44 Presidents served in the Military—30 were officers (James Buchanan was enlisted) and Teddy Roosevelt earned the Medal of Honor for action in the Spanish-American War.\n\nWithin 48 hours, the US Military is capable to reach any place on earth to provide disaster relief and international aid.\n\nOnly 28% of American aged 17-23 are eligible to serve in the military.\n\nMany do not realize how few folks served in our military compared to the overall population--.4 percent (1,4 million are currently serving)\n\nOur military is more educated than the general population. 99% of the military have successfully completed their high school education, while only 60% of the general population of the US have a high school diploma.\n\nIn many ways, the military has been leaders in our country by desegregating before other public institutions and opening full opportunities to women.\n\nMy Final Thoughts\n\nWords do not adequately honor those who served, suffered, died, were wounded and sometimes disabled—they are for the most part the best our society has among its citizens.\n\nThey learned to work for a common goal, perform their assigned mission despite harsh conditions, sometimes under hostile fire and responded when no other organization could or would.\n\nThey are often deployed for long periods of time, away from their families, who support them during their long hours and often absences. We must also remember their families who support their soldiers, sailors, and airmen.\n\nPlease just remember them—maybe attend a parade, display your flag, visit a cemetery, thank a member, or just think about a service member.\n\nLet’s be sure their bravery, strength and sacrifice do not go unnoticed—we owe a debt of gratitude to them and their families to help keep us safe.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nHenry Carl “Hank” Schrader, Jr Major (Infantry) Retired\n\nVeterans Day 2022\n\nHank Schrader, USMA '71, Retired US Army Major Infantry Officer\n\nwww.dreamdestinations.com\n\nTomorrow is Veteran Day, 11 November 2022. This is a day to recognize the service and sacrifice of the folks who pledged to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States from all enemies, foreign and domestic” by raising their right hand and were required to recite these words of allegiance to our country.\n\nCounting my 4 years at West Point, I spent 24 years of my life in a uniform and serving my country. It was an awesome experience and I’m glad I made that choice. It was a honor to serve our country.\n\nMilitary service changes all who serve, and most aspects are positive. We gained maturity quickly, learned many new skills, tested our resolve, became resilient, learned how to handle extreme stress and trauma, and made sacrifices to defend our country. Not all of us handled it the same—some still have problems associated with their service.\n\nIt’s been 31 years since I served. I went on to teach and coach for another 20 years before working full time in our travel business. The lessons learned from my military experience govern all aspects of my life—character and action count more than words.\n\nA phrase from the West Point cadet prayer has always been very meaningful to me, as it has served as a summary of how I wanted to live my life and I thought you might like to know about it. Here it is\n\n“Encourage us in our endeavor to live above the common level of life. Make us choose the harder right instead of the easier wrong, and never to be content with a half truth when the whole truth can be won.\n\nEndow us with courage that is born of loyalty to all that is noble and worthy, that scorns to compromise with vice and injustice and knows no fear when truth and right are in jeopardy.”\n\nThose are difficult goals to achieve and my personal guidelines to live by every day. I have tried to and hope I have been successful but there is always room for improvement.\n\nJust reading my thoughts and seeing how my service changed me, you can understand better how each who has donned the uniform might have developed in their lives. They have done more than defend our country. They usually set higher standards, have good work ethics, and make us a better nation.\n\nLess than 1 % of the population of the US (0.727% in a Google search) are on active duty now. According to the US Census Bureau, there are 18.2 million veterans. AARP reports that about 13 million are 50 years or older like me.\n\nWe did not all serve under the same conditions. My father served in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. I never served in a combat deployment.\n\nWhile I can’t verify how totally accurate these numbers are, here are some reasonable figures for the personal cost of the 4 major wars including WW II from 1941 to present:\n\nWW II 1.076,245 dead and wounded;\n\nKorea 128,650 dead and wounded;\n\nVietnam 211,454 dead and wounded;\n\nthe War on Terror (Afghanistan and Iraq Wars) 57,614 dead and wounded.\n\nI think these sobering figures say how lucky my Dad was to survive 7 years of combat for our nation by being deployed in 3 of these 4 conflicts.\n\nIn many ways it is ironic the public perception of military service during my service. At 18 years old as a cadet at West Point, I was called a “Baby Killer” by an angry group of Vietnam War protesters during the Armed Forces Parade in New York City in 1968. Later, the comments were almost always positive.\n\nI guess those who protest fail to realize soldiers seldom make the decision to go to war; it is our political leaders who declare war or deploy troops. Yet we are the face of their decisions and a much more accessible target of public ire. Perhaps those who feel this way should remember we are defending their freedoms to protest government decisions.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn’t cite the families who support our soldiers. It is a very personal journey; fear, and joy; never knowing if a loved one will come home each day. They deserve to be honored also for their sacrifice and loyalty to our nation by supporting their soldiers during their military service.\n\nAs a tribute to those who have served and are now serving, I thought I’d share with you some photos of military service, some personal, and some honoring the sacrifice of those who fought for our freedom from our travels in Europe.\n\nOur next door neighbor, was a junior in college, and asked my Mom if she could let a bunch of her friends stay at our home for an upcoming weekend. Without thinking why they were visiting Liz, my Mom said sure. Later in the day, she called up Liz and asked why so many were coming to visit. They were there to protest the war in Vietnam. She politely explained to Liz her husband was deployed and at war.\n\nThis story is a microcosm of events of that era—neighbors didn’t have the same beliefs and the service members and their families often suffered. Some men wore wigs to hide their short hair. Others were spat upon, or had items thrown on them. Sometimes, service members were not permitted to wear their uniforms off base. It was a sad state of affairs.\n\nTransition from 1973 to 1980\n\nSlowly the war faded from memory and the news. By 1975, Vietnam was under Communist rule after North Vietnam fell. The draft ended. Gradually respect for the military returned but many questioned if all the loss of life of good soldiers was worth the effort in Vietnam.\n\nWe almost had to intervene in the Yom Kippur War in October of 1973 when Israel was attacked by Arab force (it was the 4th conflict between these two forces). Trust me, there was a plan but we didn’t have to go.\n\nBut even in these transitional times, the military regrouped and confronted our advisories in Korea, and Europe. Many soldiers stood watch at contested borders to ward off aggression of the Russians and North Korean forces. There were many miserable days and nights as they stood watch and most of our citizens have no idea what they went through. It is hard to comprehend for those living in comfort in the US.\n\nThen the Iran Revolution of 1979 brought a significant change in the Middle East--the rise of Fundamentalism Islam rulers. 52 Americans were taken hostage and held until the 20 January Inauguration of our new President in 1981.\n\nSuddenly, the military was important to our country. One of the plights of serving in the military is we are often ignored until trouble brews and then, like in the movies, we destroy our adversaries in a couple of days. It is a common misconception and not the real world. It is never as easy as you see in the movies. Sometimes you get the fear, the lack of sleep, and the harsh conditions but seldom is it like the dirty world soldiers fight, die and operate in during conflicts.\n\nOn 24 April 1980, the military attempted a rescue, known as Operation Eagle Claw, where one civilian and 8 service members died. Some of my class mates were part of that operation. This is the real world—a risky operation that didn’t work but courageously carried out by a combined combat force of our service members. This is the real world soldiers live in during their service.\n\nThe 1980s\n\nBy now, the services were growing stronger with the all-volunteer services. Units got better, equipment improved and doctrine was refined.\n\nIn one of the ultimate ironies, I was on the invasion list of Operation Just Cause, the invasion by the US of Panama to overthrow Noriega. Many of my classmates served in high ranking positions in the 7th ID (my unit), the 75th Rangers and the 82nd Airborne. I never deployed. So, what is the ironic fact—I was stationed 3 years in Panama and now I was going to invade a country I spent 3 years in the military!\n\nPerhaps, no single event tells the story of that era like the fall of Berlin Wall. It was the symbolic end of the Cold War. I actually have a small concrete piece of the wall—not worth much money wise, but to me, it represents a lot. We did our job.\n\nThe Service Ethos\n\nAnother misconception, we are not braggarts, who love to tell war stories. It is my opinion, that most serve with little fanfare, do their duty and don’t really expect any real recognition except by their peers, or during extraordinary bravery, a medal. To most, it is about their comrades and how they worked together, usually in harsh conditions, at the will of our civilian leaders.\n\nMany combat veterans really don’t revel in telling war stories—they are proud of what they did, but also realize the sacrifice of war, as many of their buddies didn’t come home. They are not a number like you see on the news—they were people who had a family who will never be the same. These folks never forget these losses. You usually have to drag it out of them, as they prefer to not brag—it is a humble tribute to all for their collective efforts. Many don’t understand why their buddies died and they were spared.\n\nIt is also about the bond that few really get to experience and it is why so many prior service folks are instantly comfortable with other military folks—they don’t have to explain their experiences, or worry about the barracks humor or exposing their real feelings because the others understand—they often feel the same.\n\nIn the civilian world, they call it about protecting your friends back; in the military we call it protecting your 6—a reference to your 6 point of contact in a parachute landing, which is your butt! We often use a lot of jargon, foreign to others, but quite meaningful to us.\n\nWe often do revel in telling funny stories about how we were in the wrong uniform, or got lost during training and fixed it, or just learn to accept our fate in the harsh training of boot camp or Beast Barracks at West Point. Molding service members into a cohesive unit often requires bizarre events in the life of a new soldier and they are so strange and memorable that they become great stories, sometimes embellished a little for even a little more dramatic effect.\n\nThe 1990s to 2021\n\nWe won a huge victory in the 1991 Gulf War with a coalition of 28 nations. The majority of the forces were American, but it was also the rise of more fundamental unrest in what many in the military call the sand countries (primarily Iran and Afghanistan) after we toppled the regime in Iran. Suddenly, our country in mass seemed to respect our military.\n\nOn September 11, 2001, with the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, our country united and it lead to the invasion of Afghanistan.\n\nBy 2003, we were at war again in the Second Persian Gulf War, which was largely a British-American invasion of Iraq.\n\n20 years later, it seems we finally are at peace after surges, countless deployments, and a lot of lost soldiers.\n\nThe cost to these soldiers has been horrific—according to a report in NPR, we have lost 7,057 service members who died during military operations since 9/11. During this same period, active duty and veterans of these conflicts have reached 4 times that number—it now stands at 30,177.\n\nThis is a real struggle and I don’t have a real solution but many organizations and government programs are trying to address this serious problem. Perhaps now you understand how stressful it is to serve in our nation’s military, especially at time of war.\n\nMy Final Thoughts\n\nI hope in some small way I have communicated what it has been like in the military for the last 54 or so years.\n\nAs it has been said by others, we didn’t just read about history—we made it.\n\nWe protected our country, and obeyed the orders of our superiors and civilian leaders.\n\nMost never sought much recognition—it is a quite pride of a job well done. Many suffered and still are suffering.\n\nWe should do more to help them.\n\nEvery time you enjoy the wonderful life most of us live in this country, our freedoms, our rights, and the chance for a better life, just remember someone, somewhere is standing watch to protect us. Many service members think it was and is an honor to serve our country.\n\nOn this Veteran’s Day, may we remember those who watch over us. We should be proud of our protectors—it is not an easy job.\n\nWe still have many problems to solve but that is what a democracy is all about—trying to reach a consensus. It is a messy process but you can feel assured about one thing—our armed forces are ready to protect us when needed.\n\nI hope I have told their story in a way that will make you reflect on the true meaning of Veteran’s Day.\n\nMay we never forget to honor these brave men and women!\n\nMaj (Ret.) Henry “Hank Carl Schrader, Jr\n\nIt’s my class of 1971 West Point 50 year reunion. I’m sure I’ll see a few guys I haven’t seen in 50 years. That will be special and I owe a lot of them thanks. We laughed, cried suffered, triumphed and managed to make it through 47 months together from 1967 to 1971.\n\nWe quickly learned to help one another just to survive. I owe a great deal of thanks to those who helped me and pushed me to get better.\n\nThe same goes for my Army career. An Army Officer never does it alone—you lead but it is a team and I owe a great deal to the officers, NCOs and soldiers I served with in my 20 years. Many shaped me, helped me and trusted me the lead them and helped me grow and become a better person and soldier.\n\nAlong the way, I have another person to say thank you to—my lovely wife Martha Anne Schrader. Growth comes from partnership, trust and her unwavering way of challenging me. I often seem to fight it but she is about 99.9% right. Thank you dear—I often need it and you have given my life purpose. In short, you Rock! I try to say thank you every day to her but I’m sure I missed a few, so to make up thanks for making my life better.\n\nNext my school and coaching career. No finer thing can be said about teaching and coaching—you influence lives but again they all must trust you and allow you to help them grow up. Thanks for giving me the chance to teach and coach—we did it together but you had to let me have the chance.\n\nLast but not least, thank you to all who have trusted us with their vacations. You have made our business great but it has always been a team effort.\n\nWe should all say thank you more. I’m sure I’ll miss saying it to someone I should have this weekend.\n\nMaybe they will read this and remember I meant to say it but didn’t.\n\nAgain, thanks to all! I will try hard to say in person to everyone I see this weekend, but if I miss you know I still thank you! If you only read it—that’s OK also!\n\nPlease say thank you to someone today to make up for those I missed along the way!\n\nTHANK YOU TO All!!\n\nHank\n\nMy lifetime has been always associated with the Army in some form—it started as an Army Brat (my Dad was a career officer), as you read above I went to West Point and returned to teach in the physical education department.\n\nI served 20 years in the Army and once a soldier, always a soldier—I have tried to help in various military organizations and causes since my retirement. It was an honor to serve.\n\n50 years ago—in many ways a long time but most of all it seems as it was just yesterday.\n\nSo, I guess it is just fitting to tell you about the significance of 14 June in my life.\n\nUS Army Birthday\n\nFirst, the US Army Birthday deserves recognition. On 14 June 1775, the Continental Congress authorized expert riflemen to serve the United States Colonies for one year. Another act on that day was special for me also, as the first and only branch authorized that day was the Infantry—my branch. Other branches were authorized on 16 June 1775 but my branch was first.\n\nIt was a difficult task that faced the members of the Second Continental Congress in 1775.\n\nOn 19 April 1775, the American Revolution had begun with the engagement at Lexington and Concord, a local rebellion of New Englanders against the British. They surrounded the British troops that occupied Boston and appealed to the delegates of the 13 colonies for help.\n\nThe delegates also learned that Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold had taken the British forts of Ticonderoga and Crown Point. It no longer was a local rebellion, the military action had changed the situation.\n\nThey decided to take the next step by establishing the Continental Army and transformed a local war of rebellion into a war of independence for the entire 13 colonies. They resolved to “raise 6 companies of expert rifleman immediately from Pennsylvania, 2 from Maryland and 2 from Virginia and, as soon as completed, shall march and join the army near Boston, to be there employed as light infantry, under command of the Chief Officer in that army”.\n\nThe US Army and the Infantry Branch were born on that June day. On this Monday 14 June 2021 both the US Army and the Infantry Branch will be 246 years old.\n\nSo, how many serve today in the Army? The active Army has about 480,900 in an all-volunteer force. There are also around 336,000 in the Army National Guard and 188,700 in the Army Reserves.\n\nTo all of you who have donned the US Army Uniform, thank you for serving our country—there is no doubt in my mind you have made it possible for us to enjoy the freedoms that come from living in America!\n\nHappy Birthday US Army!\n\nJune 14—Flag Day\n\nMemorial Day 2021\n\nBy Hank Schrader, USMA ’71\n\nwww.dreamdestinations.com\n\nPerhaps the most misunderstood holiday in our country is Memorial Day. Memorial Day honors those who have died while on duty in the military services.\n\nHowever, I am sad to say few folks understand the significance of this solemn day of remembrance. For many people in our country, it is the start of summer and a way to gather with friends and families for a break from work. It is also about selling and buying for many—deals are offered in a dizzying amount to all of us.\n\nSomehow, to me, the whole patriotic purpose has been pushed into the background. It should be a little somber, about fallen comrades, but I guess that with less than 1% of our nation who have served in the Armed Forces, it is understandable. Maybe the best way for folks to understand is the loss of a family member—there is an emptiness that never goes away. We who have served feel the same way about our lost comrades.\n\nMany will say to others—“Happy Memorial Day”, thinking it is an accurate way to say thanks. It really is not a happy time—it is more about refection and recognizing there is something in life more important than a happy holiday. It doesn’t mean we should not express some joy during Memorial Day—just let’s express the joy about those fallen lives and remember them for their sacrifice and the good times we got to share with them. Their loved ones and comrades feel their loss every day but especially on this day and we should also pay our respects, even if for just a couple of minutes or so.\n\nThe Memorial Day holiday has its origins from the end of the US Civil War—it was originally called Decoration Day. Although the correct purpose of this holiday is to recognize those who actually died while on active service, for most American it also includes those who served their country and have passed on. I know I personally honor my Dad on this Day, even though he did not die on active duty but later in life after his retirement. He was lucky—he served in 3 wars and made it out alive. Many he served with did not.\n\nIn some functions in the military, especially formal dinners, we always toast our fallen. Almost all who have served, know a comrade who made the ultimate sacrifice. It is deeply personal—usually a vibrant life taken way too soon. One of my classmates, a 3 star general, always carried a notecard with every soldier’s name who died during his command assignment in Iraq wherever he went. He told me it was a constant reminder of decisions he made during combat came with costs, and those costs were soldier’s lives. It is not an easy profession, leaders very often put their soldiers in harm’s way—it is unavoidable but necessary to accomplish the mission.\n\nMaybe as a tribute to these fallen, I will tell you most often they reflected in their wartime service, the values of Army soldiers. These values are: Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless Service, Honor, Integrity, and Personal Courage. While these are the official Army’s values, maybe they should be our national values. There would be no better way to honor these soldiers, if we could all live our daily lives embodying some or all of these values.\n\nThis is a hard blog to write—the sheer numbers are staggering from the 5 major conflicts from WW II to present that have affected my 71 years on this earth. According to Wikipedia, combat deaths were:\n\nWW II (1941-1945) 291,557;\n\nVietnam War (1955-1975) 47,434;\n\nKorean War (1950-1953) 33,686;\n\nIraq War (2003-2011) 4,424;\n\nThe War in Afghanistan (2001 to present) 1,833.\n\nThis does not count the other operations during my lifetime or the American Civil War and World War I. From 1775 to 2019, there is a total loss of 666,441+ by combat deaths and 673,929+ by other causes during these war periods. It also does not count the missing 44,031+ missing or the 1,498,240+ wounded.\n\nDespite this tragic tale, most of these fallen are buried in our national cemeteries in the United States and Overseas and are the symbol to us of their sacrifice. These places are dignified and respectful.\n\nThis is something very personal—nothing has had as much impact on my life as serving in the military, attending West Point, and having members of my family serve in the military.\n\nSince about 1940 or so, someone related to me has served our country and help keep it safe.\n\nTo all of you who read this and served in the military, thank you for your service—most will never know how much you contributed to the well-being of our country and keeping it safe.\n\nSo, I thought I’d tell you a little about the folks who keep our country safe and send my humble thanks to them in recognition of Veterans Day 2020.\n\nA Little History about Veterans Day\n\nVeteran’s Day is celebrated on 11 November each year. The significance of this date commemorates the end of the fighting in WW I. For students of history, like me, we like to say “on the 11th hour of the 11th day in the 11th month the guns fell silent”—an easy way to remember the exact date and time of the end of hostilities of WW I in 1918.\n\nThis original celebration has changed in America from an Armistice Day observance into Veterans Day, the holiday that we celebrate today.\n\nVeterans of all our military forces should be recognized for keeping our country safe and this blog is a tribute to all who have honorably served our country.\n\nVeterans have taken a simple Oath with a Huge Impact\n\nEveryone who serves in the military takes an oath at a swearing in ceremony. They all swear to defend the country by these words, or similar words\n\n“I, (NAME), do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same”\n\nWhile this not the entire oath, it is the key part—these folks are the front line of defending our way of life—pledging allegiance to the USA, and our Constitution.\n\nToo many have paid the ultimate sacrifice with their life to make our country safe—they are special people who put others first—we have lost one member of my class in defense of our country.\n\nFor the vast majority, all the good traits that come from military service never leaves them. It is no wonder I am always drawn to these folks.\n\nOur Family Service Traditions\n\nAnne’s Dad, Alfred W Ludtke, served in World War II, as an officer of Gen MacArthur’s personal staff in the Philippines. After the war, he continued his service in the reserves and rose to the rank of LTC. Thank you A. W. for your service and sacrifice for country!\n\nMy dad, Major General (retired) Henry Carl Schrader, served for 33 years. He defended our country in WW II in Europe, was in the Korean War and last served in combat in Vietnam--a little over 7 years in combat. He was an engineer officer—loved to build things and he was excellent at it. You are my hero and inspiration Dad!\n\nI had the honor in May of last year of helping continuing the family tradition by swearing in 2nd LT Dalton Andrews, Mindy’s son, during his graduation ceremonies from North Texas State University. He has started his active duty service as an Artillery Officer in January 2020.\n\nThanks for your service—you three young ones have made me proud (you can say those things when you are 71)—you helped and are helping to keep our country safe!\n\nMy West Point Class of 1971\n\nSometimes, the best way to describe how our country’s veterans help keep our country safe is to use examples from your own experience. Here are some of our class achievements (the data is about 95% to 99% accurate and any errors or omissions are mine alone but it still tells a great story of our class impact on the United States):\n\nWe graduated 729 men in our class of 1971.\n\nAccording to our yearbook, here are the branches our classmates began their military service in: Air Defense Artillery 64; Adjutant General 4; Armor 81; Artillery Branch 148; Chemical Corps 1; Engineer 47; Finance 1; Infantry 243, Military Intelligence 33; Military Police 12; Medical Service 6; Ordnance 2; Signal 47; Transportation 7; and Quartermaster 1.\n\n18 went into the Air Force and 3 joined the Navy. We had five foreign national cadets who returned to their countries.\n\nWe had 296 who retired from the armed forces, active or reserve (they served 20 years or more unless medically retired). Here is a breakdown of ranks achieved:\n\n21 General officers {(3 Generals (4 stars--all foreign armies); 6 LTGs (3 stars), 6 MG (2 stars) and 6 BG (1 star)}; (one was an Air Force BG)\n\n85 COL; 128 LTC; 30 MAJ; 1 CPT and 2 CAPTs in the Navy, (equivalent rank to an Army COL).\n\nIn the 5 to 40 years or so that the 729 members of my West Point graduating class of 1971 were on active duty, they helped keep the country safe by serving in 7 major conflicts.\n\nHere is a list of those conflicts and the number of the class serving during these conflicts: Vietnam (12), Granada (2), Panama (9; 4 were Battalion Commanders), The Gulf War (26, 13 were Battalion Commanders), Bosnia (4, 1 was a Commanding General), Afghanistan (6, 2 were Commanding Generals) and Iraq (10, 3 were Commanding Generals).\n\nFor me, who did not serve in any of these conflicts, it is humbling to say the least.\n\nThey are perfect examples of selfless sacrifice—in the military you go where you are ordered to go. There are no excuses, you have a duty and an obligation. These guys are the rock stars of our class and I salute them!\n\nWe had 130 return to teach or support operations at West Point (some twice), to include 2 back-to-back Superintendents, and one was the Dean. 2 were Department Heads of Instruction (Math, and Law)\n\nSix members of our class have been selected as Distinguished Graduates. The Association of Graduates (AOG) has only recognized three foreign nationals as Distinguished Grads and we have two of them in our class. Only three classes have six Distinguished Grads – 1950, 1951, and 1971. The Class of 1956 has seven.\n\nOur class has some impressive members who have served in the Federal Government. They include: a US Senator; an Ambassador at Large, Department of State Coordinator for Counterterrorism; an Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics; an Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel & Manpower; an Acting Director, Federal Transportation Administration; a person who served in the Department of State, an Administrator, US International Development; 2 Senior Executive Services federal employees; and 3 working in Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nAt the local government level we have 2 state representatives, 2 mayors, a county supervisor, 2 state judges, and several who have served in various state and city level departments.\n\nWe have 21 medical doctors in a variety of specialties, 6 dentists and 1 veterinarian.\n\nAlmost all members of the class have earned at least one or more post graduate degrees. We have 17 who have earned PHDs in disciplines other than the medical field (28 total in the medical fields)—a total of 35.\n\nWe have 25 who are lawyers (probably more) and many CEOs of various sized companies and enterprises.\n\nSeveral hold patents, and have written books.\n\nWe have one Olympian – Lyle Nelson (Biathlon) who represented his country 4 times—holds record for most appearances in Olympics by any West Point grad. We have one member of the class in the Army Sports Hall of Fame and he is also in the US Lacrosse National Hall of Fame.\n\nI think it is fair to say in the soon to be 50 years since we graduated, our class has helped to make the United States a better place from the service and achievements by members of the class of 1971.\n\nYou have truly achieved a multitude of service to the nation! As the class moto says it has truly been “Professionally Done”.\n\nA Quick Salute to Those Who Have Trusted Their Travels to Us\n\nAfter all, this is a travel blog, so here are the 71 folks who have traveled with us: Steve Marsh, John Howard, Jim West, Jerry Wright, John Bantsolas, Jeff Rock, Gerry Cummins, Gordy Schnabel, Jack Pingle, Art Baker, Danton Steele, Gerry James, Ken Hartlein, Marc Erlandson, Jim Buck, Tom Mannle, Bill Barkovic, Jack Chiles. Bob Fitton, Bill Mattfeld, Bruce Litwin, Glen Barefoot and Dave Hardman. We also have 2 more classmates who have trips planned with us in the future. Thanks to my 25 classmates that put their trust in us!\n\nHere are some photos of their trips:\n\nFor those who do not know what an Arlington Lady is, every soldier who is buried at Arlington National Cemetery has a volunteer lady, who attends the service, to let our service members know their service is recognized and they are not buried alone. This is especially important for those who have sacrificed and may not have family members present. The ladies present cards of condolence to the next of kin from the military service chief and spouse on behalf of the service family, and from the Arlington Lady herself. One of the duties, is to try and remain composed, but after the ceremony, most of these ladies, cry their eyes out when alone—I know my Mom often did. I’m sure many think it could be me next getting the condolence card about a family member.\n\nFor these ladies, Memorial Day happened more than once a year—it happened every time they came to Arlington National Cemetery for a funeral.\n\nI also know several wives of my 71 classmates have also served as Arlington Ladies.\n\nThey too, like all family members, deserve to hear “Thanks for keeping our country safe”\n\nA Final Thought\n\nOf all the services our government provides its citizens, there is none more important that defense of our nation and our way of life.\n\nToday, less than 0.05% of our nation’s citizens are serving our country in the Armed Forces.\n\nThese men and women, deserve more than thanks for their service. Maybe next time you meet a veteran, why not say something like this “Thanks for keeping our country Safe!”\n\nTrust me, those who have served will appreciate it more than you could ever understand—why not tell a vet or his family that you know your freedom and safety depends on those who serve?\n\nFor me it was an honor to serve and most vets I know feel the same way—they are proud and humble, who did what was required and made sacrifices for the common good.\n\nTo all my fellow veterans and their families and especially my 1971 West Point Classmates—Thanks for keeping our country safe!\n\nHank\n\nOn the fateful day, Lt. Col James Rudder led 225 men in an assault on the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc.\n\nBut to understand this superb combat unit, we must return to the days of 1943, where Rudder formed the Rangers. The 2nd Ranger Battalion was activated on April 1, 1943 at Camp Forrest, Tullahoma, Tennessee. They were volunteer units. Each soldier had to possess superb physical qualities and sharp mental skills. They also trained in Florida. Each ranger became skilled in all types of weapons, hand-to-hand combat and handling difficult terrain. The unit was deployed to Scotland next. Here they trained on scaling cliffs and trained with British Commandos.\n\nThe rangers were organized into 6 line companies, A to F per battalion sized units. Each company consisted of 65 men and 3 officers. The companies were organized into 2 platoons.\n\nThe Plan\n\nThe plan was for part of the 2nd Ranger Battalion to assault the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc at 0630 and take possession of the German position by 0700. This group was named Force A.\n\nForce A had 3 ranger companies in the task organization. Company D was to scale the cliffs from the west; Companies E and F were to scale the cliffs from the east. They would then destroy the cannons once on top of Pointe du Hoc. After destroying the weapons, they were to establish a defensive perimeter on Pointe du Hoc and prevent the Germans from moving reinforcements down the coastal highway that connected Grandcamp and Vierville.\n\nThe rangers were to hold the ground until relieved by the 116th Infantry Division. Relief was scheduled for noon on 6 June 1944.\n\nForce B, Charlie Company of the 2nd Rangers, was to assault and capture the area on the far right flank of the Omaha Beach on exit D-1. Their objective was Pointe de la Percée.\n\nForce C, was comprised of the entire 5th Ranger Battalion, along with A and B companies of the 2nd Rangers. Here were their missions:\n\n1). If the initial landing force failed, Force C was designated to assault and capture Pointe du Hoc, by landing at Omaha and moving inland to take Pointe du Hoc.\n\nOr\n\n2) If the mission of Force A was successful, they were scheduled to also land at Pointe du Hoc as reinforcements, assuming the objective was taken by 0700.\n\nA Landing that Started Off Wrong\n\nAt 0445 the rangers of Force A were loaded into landing crafts that held 22 men per landing craft. They men and supplies were loaded into 10 landing craft and 4 DUKW's amphibious vehicles. As they approached the beachhead, they were 3 miles off course, and LTC Rudder realized the error—they were headed to Pointe de la Percée, the objective of Force B.\n\nThe landing craft had to travel exposed back to the correct landing site. By the time they arrived at the objective, 1 landing craft and 2 DUKW’s were sunk.\n\nThey were due to start their assault at 0630, but the currents and navigation errors delayed the landing until 0710. Since the plan called for the assault to begin at 0630, the naval bombardment stopped at 0625. This allowed the Germans to regroup and take up some defensive positions.\n\nThe Germans, however, were slow to reorganize, and this aided the assault.\n\nThe first landing crafts made it to Pointe du Hoc at 0710. Their landing area was only 30 yards wide and the tide was rising. There was no time to assault from both the west and east sides of Pointe du Hoc—they all had to go up the cliffs from the east side.\n\nSome equipment was not useable. The 75-foot mechanized ladders mounted on the amphibious vehicles couldn’t get into positions to be used—it was too slippery for the tracks to get into position (there were only 2 available as they were transported by the DUKW’s and 2 were already sunk). They had lost ammo supplies. Ropes, men, radios and all their other equipment were soaked.\n\nThe only thing in their favor—the intense shelling and bombing had caused some of the cliff face to collapse into rubble piles. In a few places, the climb would only be 60 feet.\n\nThe rangers were going to scale the cliffs under their own power using ropes and rope ladders.\n\nOver the Top and Success of Force A\n\nScaling the cliffs was one of the most impressive military feats ever successfully accomplished by a US unit in combat. Companies D, E and F landed and scaled the cliffs by using rocket-fired grappling hooks attached to ropes. They developed the scaling techniques primarily by trial and error during their training sessions. Their training was intense and it paid off—under pressure and enemy fire these soldiers responded, despite incredible odds against their success.\n\nThe landing problems resulted in an assault only from the east side of Pointe du Hoc. Some of the soaked ropes didn’t reach the top, but finally some worked correctly. They only had 15 casualties in the initial assault. The German defenders cut ropes, threw potato mashers and fired on the exposed soldiers. The rangers countered with mortar fire and small arms fire at the German positions above. Also 2 US destroyers fired their guns effectively at the cliff side German defenders.\n\n5 minutes after landing, some rangers were already on top of the cliffs. Within 15 minutes of landing, the majority of Rudder’s assault force had made it on top of Pointe du Hoc.\n\nOnce up top, small groups of rangers went off to accomplish their missions. They were stunned by the results of the bombardments—one soldier said it looked like the craters of the moon. It looked nothing like the mock-ups and photos of the site.\n\nMeanwhile, Force B (Company C, of the 2nd Ranger Battalion) was assaulting at Omaha and later would capture Pointe de la Percée. Their landing was at Charlie (farthest western sector of Omaha) on Omaha Beach, at 0645 in the second landing wave. They landed after Company A, 116th Regiment was being torn apart on Dog Green (now more famously known as the Bedford Boys, as 19 from the town in VA were killed in the D Day assault on 6 June). They too came under intense fire from 3 Widerstandnesten or Wn (resistance nests) defensive positions, Wn 71, Wn 72 and Wn 73. They fought their way to the seawall.\n\nThere were two possible plans for Force B. If the D-1 Draw was clear, move up the draw and attack Pointe de la Percée and eliminate Wn 74 (plan 1). Plan 2 was to climb up the cliffs (the worst option).\n\nForce B lacked most of the specialized climbing gear that was allocated to Force A. With the draw not yet captured, the only option was climb the cliffs. Hugging the cliffs, they found a section to climb. PFC Otto Stephens climbed first, using his bayonet to dig hand holds. He and 2 other rangers established a rope for the remaining rangers, so they would be able to climb up.\n\nThe situation was so bad on Omaha, that the Force B commander, Captain Goranson, decided he had no other option than to attack Wn 73 and then proceed to attack Wn 74 on Pointe de la Percée. This turned out to be a great combat decision—Wn 73 was a really effective fighting position and Wn 74 was primarily a radar position, guarded by 2 anti-aircraft guns and several machinegun nests.\n\nOnly 29 of his 64 Rangers were able to fight—the rest were killed or wounded. The remaining 29 men began slowing clearing the trenches of Wn 73. They were later joined with 20 soldiers from 116th who also climbed the ropes. All worked together, clearing the trenches, to eliminate their lethal machinegun nests and other defensive positions.\n\nAt around 1400, Captain Goranson, after leading the men to clear the German defensive positions and block German reinforcements, led a patrol to Pointe de la Percée. He found it abandoned, with the defensive positions Wn 74 destroyed by naval fire as they approached. He returned to link up with Force C. Around night fall, Force B had only 12 men able to fight.\n\nForce C\n\nForce C was reluctantly waiting off shore, hoping to reinforce Rudder at Pointe du Hoc. His soldiers bobbed up and down in the rough seas. There was no signal received by the Battalion Commander, LTC Max Schneider, from Force A—he had ordered his landing crafts to lay-to offshore. Schneider knew how important it was to reinforce Force A at Pointe du Hoc.\n\nThere was no more time left; at 0740 six landing crafts with the rangers landed at Omaha beach at Dog White. They were met with intense fire. LTC Schneider, the only ranger officer with combat experience, moved the rest of the force to landing zone Dog Red. This was a pivotal decision during the early phases of the invasion landings at Omaha. He managed to get most of his force intact over the exposed 200 yards to the seawall—brush fires helped obscure the defenders from accurate fire upon his landing unit.\n\nGetting a well-trained, elite unit almost intact to relative safety was a key factor in the fight for Omaha.\n\nShortly thereafter, he met up with BG Cota, Executive Officer of the 29th Division. It is here where Cota, urging the men off the beach, yelled out “Rangers lead the way!” They made it up the bluffs and probably were the key reason in the 29th Division sector succeeded in accomplishing their mission in taking their assigned sector of Omaha beach. LTC Schneider led his men through the obstacles, past the barbed wire and up the cliffs. They continued the assault to their initial objective near Vierville and later linked up with the remainder of Force B. They had been in almost 10 hours of constant combat.\n\nHowever, they were badly shot up and could not effectively reinforce Rudder’s men at Pointe du Hoc on 6 June 1944 but they still wanted to try. Key leaders denied them the chance on 6 June 1944. The 29th Division had lost so many men, it needed the rangers to help defend the small beach head positions inland. Despite LTC Schneider’s pleas to go reinforce the stranded rangers, he was ordered to stay and help defend the beach head.\n\n3 ranger companys were not as important as securing Omaha—a tough but correct command decision.\n\nHanging On at Pointe du Hoc\n\nRudder had signaled that he had landed late and taken Pointe du Hoc, but the message was garbled and not understood by the commanders at sea. They committed the reserve rangers (Force C) to land at Omaha beach. By the time he communicated success, and ask for help, the reply was “no reinforcements”.\n\nRudder’s group was now on their own.\n\nLater that day, the Germans started their counterattacks. By night fall, Rudder’s men were forced back into defensive positions in a small 200 yard perimeter.\n\nAt 2100, 1st platoon of A Company, who had been unable to link up with the rest of the 5th Ranger Bn., had fought their way to Ponte du Hoc and linked up with Rudder’s men, with a force of 23 soldiers. They would be his only reinforcements on 6 June.\n\nBy 7 June, Rudder had a fighting force of fewer of 100 of the original 225 who had begun the assault. Ammunition and food were running low. He did get some reinforcements from the sea. About 60 men from the 1st Platoon of Fox Company of the 5th Rangers and a dismounted cannon platoon, help reinforced Rudder’s men and evacuate some wounded soldiers.\n\nRudder held on until 8 June, when the 5th Rangers and men from the 29th Division finally linked up with his force. His men had withstood 5 counterattacks.\n\nThe Price for Victory\n\nThe 2nd Ranger Battalion (a total force of about 488) had 77 killed and 152 wounded and 38 listed as missing. At the time of the relief, Rudder’s original force of 225 had less than 75 men capable of fighting.\n\nRudder was wounded twice in the battle and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC). Thirteen other Rangers were awarded the DSC for their roles at Pointe du Hoc and the other ranger missions.\n\nThe 5th Ranger Battalion (again about 488 men, according to the Table of Organization & Equipment (TO&E)) had 23 men killed, 89 wounded and 2 missing.\n\nBoth the 2nd Ranger Bn. and the 5th Bn. were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation and the French Croix de Guerre.\n\nOmaha and Utah Beaches 6 June 1944\n\nBy Hank Schrader, USMA ’71, Europe Destination & Europe River Cruise Expert\n\nwww.dreamdestinations.com\n\nIn November 1943, the Big Three (Roosevelt, Stalin and Churchill) agreed in a conference in Tehran, that the Allied Western Forces of the United States and Britain would invade France in 1944 and open a second front against the German Fortress Europe.\n\nThe clock was now ticking for the D Day invasion of France. It was a race between German defenders and the Allied invasion force.\n\nThe ideal strategy was simple for the planners of the D Day amphibious invasion—attack lightly defended beaches, secure the beach, and move men and supplies quickly inland. Next, establish or capture a port quickly to reinforce with more men and supplies. Then, defeat the German forces and win the war.\n\nExecuting it proved to be one of the most difficult military tasks every attempted.\n\nDuring the massive planning operations, Pas du Calais (the most favorable landing site) and Normandy were under consideration. Both had enough good characteristics to work for an amphibious landing. But Normandy was the best choice for two reasons. There were: 1) in 1943 it was a lightly defended part of the German Atlantic Wall and 2) the Germans anticipated an attack at Pas du Calais and fortified it and constantly moved more soldiers into defensive positions.\n\nThe German Defenders\n\nThe Germans realized they weren’t prepared to properly defend the vast Atlantic Wall in 1943. The German commander, General Gerd von Rundstedt, drafted a report to Hitler about the scant fortifications and poor quality units defending the area. Hitler responded by adding General Erwin Rommel (known popularly as the “Desert Fox” for his Africa campaign) to oversee improving the defenses.\n\nThe Germans knew an invasion was coming—they just didn’t know where or when. The choice that the Germans believed the Allies would select was an invasion of Pas de Calais, as it was the most logical invasion site—only 20 miles from England and had 20 miles of good landing beaches. The allies bolstered that illusion by creating a fake force under the command of LTG George Patton, complete with fake equipment, field barracks and even a docking area near Dover. They relentlessly bombed the Calais area in the build-up phase, as well as other targets in France. In an unusual operation, they also dropped dummies by parachutes, to harass and confuse the Germans.\n\nField Marshal Rommel was also convinced Calais was the prime invasion site and deployed the 208,000 man 15th Army to defend this area. The deception plan of D Day was working as hoped for the Allies.\n\nThe first priority for the Germans was protecting the major harbors, as any invading forces would need constant supplies, more men and equipment.\n\nAfter securing these major ports, they then began building “Widerstandnesten” (resistance nests) along the beaches. These were a series of pillboxes, gun positions, anti-aircraft weapons and trenches. The beaches were littered with obstacles, mines (over 4 million mines) to enhance these resistance nests. Inland, flooded lowlands and stakes were planted in the ground to cut into gliders during landings and make possible airborne landing zones potential death traps.\n\nA key concept for the Germans was to stop the invasion on the beaches, so all defensive resources were placed at or near the beach areas and no defense in depth was planned. There were reserve units to stop breakthroughs but the best reserve unit of panzer tanks could only be released by Hitler. If the Allies could breach these tough defenses, and cut off the reserve forces, they had a good chance of success.\n\nBy June 1944 all the beaches used for the D Day landings in Normandy had at least some of these defensive measures in places.\n\nUnknown to the allies, the best defended beach in Normandy was Omaha.\n\nThe stage was set for that fateful day 6 June 1944.\n\nConcept of the Overlord Operation\n\nYou might be surprised to know the last successful armed assault across the English Channel happened in 1066 (yes, the famous Battle of Hastings). 8 centuries later, this was about to change.\n\nAmphibious landings are complex operations. Trying to attack with 5 divisions over a 50 mile front in Normandy from a base in England would require naval forces, air forces and army units from British, Canadian and American forces. The allied armies and massive equipment needed to ensure success only added to the complexity. 150,000 soldiers would be required, with a fleet of 5,333 ships and an air armada of over 12,921 planes.\n\nSynchronizing an operation of this size remains one of the most amazing military feats in the history of the world.\n\nAn Overview of the Invasion\n\nOn the beach, 270 desperate engineer soldiers were trying to open 16 pathways for the tanks to get off the beach from the obstacles. They have 27 minutes to achieve their mission according to the plan; only 1 pathway is opened on time. Most of the engineers are dead or wounded by the end of their 27 minute first mission.\n\nThe landing waves continued. Rifle and machinegun bullets constantly flew around; mortar and artillery shells rained down; explosions, screams, destroyed and abandoned equipment and vehicles litter the beaches (especially the destroyed burning tanks); and confusion was everywhere. The only reasons most survived was there was just too many of them for the Germans to shoot everyone and the heavy smoke that offered some concealment to the exposed soldiers.\n\nWithout tank support, the original plan to take the heavily fortified draws was not a good option for soldiers only armed with light weapons.\n\nAt 0730, several hundred surviving soldiers were huddled against the seawall, and the outlook was bleak. Most of their leaders had been killed or wounded.\n\nIn the west, General Norman Cota, commander of the 29th Division, landed and sprinted to the wall around 0730. As he rallied the soldiers, he realized going up the draws, according to the original plan wouldn’t work. The only good option was to climb the less defended bluffs.\n\nHe found a group of rangers and told them of his plan and then yelled out “Rangers Lead the Way”, which has become the official ranger moto. Within an hour, the rangers and soldiers from the 29th reached the top. The German defenses were oriented to the sea and Cota’s growing band of soldiers captured the Vierville draw (D-1) about 2 hours later by attacking them from their rear. It took the engineer soldiers 8 hours to clear the Vierville draw of mines and other obstacles.\n\nThe beach head was still an intense killing zone at about 0830. Several thousand soldiers were stranded and easy targets for the Germans. A frustrated destroyer skipper (Lt. Commander Ralph Ramey), defied his orders, steamed his destroyed as close as possible and began to blast the cliffs with his 5 inch guns. Soon, all the other destroyers followed. Within 30 minutes, they had destroyed 6 gun emplacements. The tide was turning. With less effective fire raining down on the trapped men, leaders began moving soldiers up the bluffs and into the draws. The crowded beaches were slowly clearing.\n\nWith men still vulnerable on the beach, and landing craft prohibited from landed more soldiers as there was no space, soldiers were trying to fight their way off the killing zone. In 2 hours of intense fighting, by 1100, the beach started to clear up as the men were making progress against the Germans. Some landing craft commanders again defied order"
