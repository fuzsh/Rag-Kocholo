        "text": "Airbases/Stations: Leeuwarden AB\n\nLeeuwarden air base is located in the northern province of Friesland, as the name suggests the base is in close proximity to the provinces capital city of Leeuwarden. The airbases history can be traced back to 1938 when the glider field was officially opened as Leeuwarden airfield. In those years, the field was primarily used by the KLM airlines until the German invasion in May 1940. The Germans quickly recognized the fields strategic location and transformed the basic field into a proper fighter base for the Luftwaffe. After having been abandoned and mostly demolished by the Germans in September 1944, the base was rebuilt and officially named Vliegbasis Leeuwarden (Leeuwarden airbase) in 1949. Concurrently Leeuwarden became the home of the RNLAFs first jet fighter, the Gloster Meteor. By 1956 it was joined by the Hawker Hunter. These early jets were flown by 324, 325, and 326 Squadron. When in 1964 the new F-104 Starfighter arrived at Leeuwarden, the historically significant 322 and 323 squadrons (former RAF squadron numbers for the Dutch squadrons flying with the RAF during the 2nd World War) were re-established to fly the 104. Besides the fighter-jets, Leeuwarden became the home of the air forces sole SAR unit, 303 Squadron. The unit was established at Soesterberg airbase, but moved in 1977 to Leeuwarden because of the bases close proximity to the weapon ranges on the northern islands.\n\nIn 1979, the first two F-16s arrived at Leeuwarden to start the replacement of the F-104. 322 Squadron became the first operational F-16 squadron of the RNLAF in October 1980, 323 Squadron followed one year later. In late 1993, the SAR unit received its first AB-412SP to replace the Alouette III, becoming fully operational in May 1994 with three helicopters of the new type. In addition to the traditional SAR and Tactical Air Rescue tasks, the unit also provides transportation of patients from the island to the mainlands hospitals.\n\nLeeuwarden air base is home to the Future Weapon Instructor Training (FWIT) course for the EPAF nations that are participating in the F-16 Mid-Life Upgrade program. Leeuwarden also hosts exercise Frisian Flag, a large scale annual flying exercise which has seen the participation of many European air forces, even including Finland, and also the US Navy and USAF attended some editions.\n\nIn close proximity to the North Sea and the Vliehors weapons range, Leeuwarden air base probably has a secure future as RNLAF fighter base and will welcome the F-35 Lightning II in a few years as the fifth fighter type to be based there in its history."
