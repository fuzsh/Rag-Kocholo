The star is surrounded by four three-pointed crowns, and c. 16 spots arranged circularly, all orange.\n\nAt the time General Reynders was the Chief of Staff. After the second world war this flag was apparently replaced by another one - less conspicuous.\n\nJarig Bakker, 31 May 2005\n\nAre you sure that the proportions are NOT 2 to 3?\n\nMiles Li, 23 Aug 2005\n\nChief of Staff c. 1930? flag\n\nimage by Jarig Bakker, 23 Jun 2005\n\nIn \"The International Flag Book in Colour\", by Pedersen, 1971 [ped71] is a flag for the Chief of the Defense Staff:\n\nwhite field, bordered orange, charged with two olive branches in saltire, enclosing 4 6-pointed stars, placed 1,2,1, all yellow.\n\nPedersen explains: or Joint Services Commander-in-Chief - introduced c. 1930.\n\nDerkwillem Visser, in \"Gemeentevlaggen en Wapens Koninkrijk der Nederlanden\", 2001, has the same image, attributed to \"Opperbevelhebber Land- en Zeestrijdkrachten - omstreeks 1939\" (commander in chief Land and Sea forces, c. 1939).\n\nJarig Bakker, 23 Jun 2005\n\nChief of Defence Staff (\"Commanding General, Netherlands and National Sector\" according to [hms58]).\n\nMiles Li, 23 Aug 2005\n\nCommander-in-Chief, First Netherlands Corps\n\nimage by Miles Li, 24 Aug 2005\n\nCommander-in-Chief, First Netherlands Corps - Source: Flags of All Nations [hms58].\n\nMiles Li, 24 Aug 2005\n\nInspector General\n\nimage by Mark Sensen, 5 Oct 2003\n\nInspector General Armed Forces (Inspecteur-Generaal der Krijgsmacht).\n\nSeven equal horizontal stripes red-white-blue-white-red-white-blue, with in the centre a circle with a diameter 4/10th of the flag height.

The functions of Inspector General for the Army (est. 1945), Inspector General for the Navy (est. 1946) and Inspector General for the Air Force (est. 1953) were merged on 1 January 1970. All these functions were until 1976 held by Prince Bernhard. I've seen photos of Prince Bernhard with the badge on his uniform. I don't know if the similarity between the emblem and the royal flag is a coincidence or not.\n\nMark Sensen, 5 Oct 2003\n\nDepartment of Defense\n\nimage by Stefan Lambrecht, 17 Jan 2008 http://www.flagchart.net\n\nMark Sensen spotted this link.\n\nInfo: On all military establishments on which daily the Dutch flag is hoisted it is allowed to hoist the flag of the military division. This flag is hoisted immediately after the national flag and lowered immediately before the national flag, if it is impossible to hoist and lower them simultaneously.\n\nThe measurements have to be equal or smaller than the national flag.
