The Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) 306 Squadron at Leeuwarden Air Base received a desk-top simulator for UAV training.

The simulator is part of the Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) Remotely Piloted Air System (RPAS) Training Technology Demonstrator (TTD) project managed by the European Defence Agency (EDA) and is part of a network of training simulators for unmanned aircraft.

The MALE was established to provide up to nine networked procedural trainers to the MALE RPAS community.

The multinational European MALE RPAS shares operational experience and maintenance of similar assets, logistics, training, doctrine, concepts and procedures.

Participating countries can share information and experiences directly with each other.
