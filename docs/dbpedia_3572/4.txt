Introduction

The Royal Netherlands Air Force purchased a total of 213 F-16A/B aircraft. The Netherlands were one of the four European Participating Air Forces, and one of 5 countries to build the F-16 locally. Force reductions saw the fleet reduced to 68 aircraft, all of them upgraded to MLU standard. Some surplus aircraft have been sold to Jordan and Chile.

Inventory

Initial Order

The Netherlands was one of the four initial European NATO customers for the F-16, along with Belgium, Denmark, and Norway. The initial Dutch order for F-16A/B aircraft was for 102 examples (80 single-seat F-16A's and 22 two-seat F-16B's), which were to be assembled at Fokker. This line first opened up for business in April of 1978, and was the second of the European F-16 final assembly lines to open, SABCA in Belgium being the first. The first Dutch built F-16 took off on its maiden flight on May 3rd, 1979, with test pilot Henk Temmen at the controls. Initial delivery of the F-16A/B to the KLu took place in June of 1979.

Follow-On Order

In March of 1980, the Netherlands announced plans (finally approved by the Dutch Parliament in December 1983) to buy an additional 111 aircraft (97 F-16A's and 14 F-16B's). This brought the total F-16 inventory to 213 aircraft, 177 A models and 36 B models. The last F-16 rolled off the line at Fokker's Schiphol plant on February 27th, 1992. It was #J-021 (#89-0021), and was the last of 213 examples delivered to the KLu.

Fleet Reduction

In 2003, the Dutch government decided to cut the F-16 force by 25%. From 2004 onwards, The Netherlands will provide 108 F-16s to NATO, with 90 being available for operational deployments. As many as 36 F-16s would be sold; however, increased attrition losses might reduce this number.

On November 21st, 2005 Jordan signed a LOI to buy three Dutch F-16s, all two-seaters. These aircraft #J-650, #J-653 and #J-654 will be delivered in 2009. All these F-16s have been modified with the MLU upgrade. ANother 3 two-seaters were added to the order in 2007.

In December of 2005 the Chilean government signed a contract with the Netherlands to supply it with up to 18 Dutch F-16s (11 Alpha models and 7 Bravo models). These will form a new squadron aside the newly delivered block 50 F-16s. Another lot was ordered in May of 2008 for delivery in 2010. These 18 F-16s are all A-models and will equip another Chilean squadron.

Modifications & Armament

Armament

In the interception role, KLu F-16s are equipped with AIM-9N, -9L, and -9M Sidewinder AAM's. AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles are used for longer-range interceptions. All F-16 units have Mk82/84 bombs and cluster weapons.

In 1997, the RNLAF awarded Hughes Missile Systems Company a contract for 36 AGM-65G missiles. During operations over former Yugoslavia, the RNLAF detachment in Italy leased AGM-65D missiles from the USAF, pending delivery of the AGM-65G.

312 squadron has a tactical nuclear commitment, carried out with US supplied nuclear weapons.

The RNlAF has also acquired LGBs (GBU-24, GBU-10, GBU-12, CBU-87), and will acquire AIM-9X and JDAM.

F-16(R) and Recce Pods

In 1983, F-16s from 306 sqn took over the Oldelft Orpheus camera pods which were previously carried by RF-104G Starfighters. The 306 sqn was selected since it was the RNlAF's designated recce unit. 18 F-16A's were modified to accomodate the Orpheus pod on the fuselage centerline station, and fitted with radar altimeter and a control box for the Oldelft Orpheus pod. Modified F-16s are designated F-16A(R). The F-16A(R) was first flown on January 27th, 1983. The Orpheus pod contains a camera and IR line-scanner equipment.

In 2002, 306 sqn lost its recce role, and replaced 313 sqn as the F-16 Theatre Operational Conversion unit. The recce role is now assigned to three frontline squadrons (311 sqn, 315 sqn, and 322 sqn). Since all MLUs are technically capable of carrying a recce pod, no modifications are required. The RNlAF now uses the Medium Altitude Reconnaissance System (MARS). MARS uses Reccon Optical cameras, mounted in a standard Per Udsen Modular Recconaissance pod. The first operational flight with the MARS pod was carried out on June 6th, 2000, by two F-16AMs of 315 Squadron (#J-136 and #J-145), although the pod was already inservice for testing purposes since 1997.

Mid-life Update

All operational F-16A/B's operated by the Netherlands went through the Mid-Life Update (MLU) by 2003. A Multinational Operational Test and Evaluation center for the F-16A/B Mid-Life Update was established at Leeuwarden air base during 1997. As part of continuing defense cuts, the number of KLu F-16s to undergo MLU was reduced from 170 to 138 in mid-1993.

Other

The Dutch Air Force has purchased a number of LANTIRN targeting systems, and has also agreed on the Joint Helmet-mounted Cueing System. The RNlAF has purchased 108 ALQ-131 pods for use on its F-16s. The ALQ-131 pods been upgrade to Block-2 configuration. In combination with the Lantirn targeting pod, 60 examples of the GEC/MARCONI navigation pods were acquired. However these are carried very rarely by Dutch F-16s. In 2006 an order was also placed for 8 Elbit Reccelite pods and Litening AT pods. These are to be delivered in 2008.
