Arrested and hanged by the British for shooting and killing Sir Michael O’Dwyer, who had been the governor of Punjab when the Jallianwala Bagh massacre had taken place. Singh had been an eyewitness to the massacre and had vowed to exact revenge on behalf on all Indians. Udham Singh had been a devout follower of Bhagat Singh and had been arrested before on charges of delivering arms and ammunition to revolutionaries. He did not resist arrest after he shot at O’Dwyer and instead is said to have been accepting of his fate even when he was on trial, going to his execution with the belief that he had avenged those who died in Amritsar in the massacre. His remains are now preserved at Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar.",
