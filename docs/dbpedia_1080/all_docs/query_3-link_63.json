        "text": "In news:\n\nDecember 26 was the birth anniversary of freedom fighter Udham Singh, who is known for avenging the Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 1919.\n\nWho was Udham Singh?\n\nBorn in Sunam in Punjab’s Sangrur district in 1899.\n\nHe was a political activist who got associated with the Ghadar Party while in the US.\n\nIn 1934, Singh made his way to London with the purpose of assassinating O’Dwyer, who in 1919 had been the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab and unsurprisingly, Singh considered O’Dwyer to be responsible for the massacre.\n\nInstead of Dyer, who instructed his men to open fire at the crowd gathered in Jallianwala Bagh, O’Dwyer is considered to be the actual perpetrator, since Dyer could not have executed it without his permission.\n\nOn March 13, 1940 Singh shot O’Dwyer at a meeting of the East India Association and the Royal Central Asian Society at Caxton Hill.\n\nHe was sentenced to death and was hanged on July 31, 1940 at Pentonville Prison.\n\nWhat is Ghadar Party?\n\nThe multi-ethnic party was believed to have communist tendencies and was founded by Sohan Singh Bhakna in 1913.\n\nHeadquartered in California.\n\nIt was committed to the ouster of the British from India.\n\nWhy did he consider O’Dwyer responsible for the massacre?\n\nO’Dwyer ordered Brigadier Reginald Dyer to Amritsar before the massacre; he was worried that there might be a second Indian mutiny, given the Hindu-Muslim unity and the demonstrations and strikes.\n\nInstead of Dyer, O’Dwyer is considered to be the actual perpetrator, since Dyer could not have executed it without his permission.\n\nOn March 13, 1940, Udham Singh shot O’Dwyer at a meeting of the East India Association and the Royal Central Asian Society at Caxton Hill.\n\nHe was immediately arrested and held in Brixton prison and was sentenced to death and was hanged on July 31, 1940, at Pentonville Prison.\n\nA legend in India\n\nFor avenging the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, Singh is seen by many as a hero. Gandhi, though, had famously called Singh’s revenge as an “act of insanity”.\n\nWhile being on trial, he referred to himself as Mohamed Singh Azad, to symbolise Hindu-Sikh-Muslim unity in the fight for India’s freedom.\n\nIn 1974, his remains were sent back to India and he was cremated in his village in Sunam.\n\nThere have been several demands in the past few years for Udham Singh’s statue to be installed in Jallianwala Bagh and the Parliament complex.\n\nIn 2018, his statue was installed at Jallianwala Bagh during Baisakhi.\n\nUdham Singh Nagar district in Uttarakhand is named after the freedom fighter."
