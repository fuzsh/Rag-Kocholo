        "text": "The correct answer is C. Udham Singh.\n\nUdham Singh was a revolutionary leader who assassinated General Reginald Dyer in London on 13 March 1940. Dyer was the British officer responsible for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar, India, on 13 April 1919, in which British troops fired on a crowd of unarmed Indian civilians, killing at least 379 people and injuring over 1,200.\n\nUdham Singh was born in Sunam, Punjab, India, in 1899. He was educated at the local school and then at the Khalsa College in Amritsar. He was a bright student and was interested in politics and history. He was also a member of the Ghadar Party, an Indian revolutionary organization.\n\nIn 1919, Udham Singh was in Amritsar when the Jallianwala Bagh massacre took place. He was deeply affected by the massacre and vowed to avenge the deaths of the victims. He left India and went to England, where he lived for many years.\n\nIn 1940, Udham Singh went to the Caxton Hall in London, where General Dyer was giving a speech. He shot Dyer three times, killing him instantly. Udham Singh was arrested and charged with murder. He was found guilty and sentenced to death. He was hanged on 31 July 1940.\n\nUdham Singh is considered a martyr by many Indians. He is remembered for his courage and his determination to avenge the victims of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre."
