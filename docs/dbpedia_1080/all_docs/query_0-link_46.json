        "text": "We’ve had so many creative and talented young people who’ve taught us so much in the last three years of OSCH Manchester. Here, Amina Beg, a member of the OSCH Young Collective and Manchester Museum OSCH social action intern, writes about some of the highlights of her OSCH journey.\n\nBy Amina Beg\n\nWhose Statues? Whose Stories?\n\nI first came across OSCH via Suhaiymah Manzoor Khan’s Instagram story promoting ‘Whose Statues? Whose Stories?’ in February 2021 and ever since then I knew I wanted to get involved with OSCH because I’ve never seen any organisations or platforms like this and it just felt so right and comfortable to be a part of this.\n\nSince then, I’ve been interning as a Social Action intern from October 2021 where I have facilitated workshops encouraging young people to apply and managing two projects alongside Maya Chowdhury The Croissant Club and South Asian Beauty Standards. From February 2021, I’ve been on this insightful journey from attending all these amazing workshops from OSCH to hosting poetry workshops with them and then being given the opportunity to perform professionally.\n\nOSCH was the community I always wanted especially when I was younger, and I wish for more people (young people) to have this strong and supportive network. It’s such a blessing to be surrounded by such talented, creative like-minded individuals.\n\nApart from the Whose Statues? Whose Stories workshop I’ve had the opportunity to feature my poem ‘Britannia’ that I wrote in the OSCH session which focuses on statues in our cities and what role they play, not only in our country but in the world, this was produced and filmed by Words of Colour, CODE and OSCH. In this piece, I aimed to explore what certain statues represent to us and if they reflect our moral values.\n\nOSCH has pushed me creatively giving me the chance to develop my poetry from performing at open mics on zoom in my room to now being able to perform on stage has given me the chance to grow as an artist and become more confident in myself in terms of expressing my thoughts and anger towards the statues in our cities but the commemoration we still have for the wrong people in power. Here’s the link to watch the final performance:\n\nBelonging: Space & Place\n\nAfter this performance of ‘Britannia’, I was then asked by the OSCH coordinator and Young Collective to host a poetry workshop last July 2021 on zoom for South Asian Heritage Month. Following on from the ‘Whose Statues? Whose Stories?’ workshops, ‘Belonging: Space & Place’ focused on Riz Ahmed’s The Breakup/Shikwa piece asking participants to explore post coloniality, shared identities and their relationship with Britain stimulating from the line ‘Britain’s broken up with me’ just as Riz Ahmed does. This workshop was well received by participants and gave me the chance to learn how to facilitate a safe comfortable environment for young people to express their feelings and thoughts about their personal identities.\n\nCome To My Mums: Contact Theatre\n\nCome To My Mums was an evening of poetry and storytelling at Contact Theatre in parallel to the show ‘Peaceophobia’ (a show about three Muslim men and Islamophobia). This event was to widen that conversation and celebrates South Asian Muslim women which is often overlooked on a mainstream platform.\n\nWith this opportunity, I was able to showcase my first spoken-word piece ‘Be Good’ which is about casual microaggressions from ordering fish and chips at M&S in Edinburgh – which is something I didn’t really process until going to OSCH’s workshops which has allowed me to reflect on my personal experiences and speak up. The second piece was from the spoken word series I created over lockdown called You Make Us Hate Our Neighbours exploring my relationship with post-colonial/post-Brexit Britain. The final piece Sohni was a snippet from a folktale I adapted into a modern-day context exploring forbidden love, Partition and misrepresentation of Muslim Women from a South Asian folklore called Sohni Mahiwal.\n\nBefore this performance I have never performed at a professional theatre but OSCH gave me the platform to take up space, share my art and has supported me in meeting other South Asian creatives in the Manchester creative scene which is something I could never imagine. OSCH has been the community I have been longing for, the space where young people and creatives from all backgrounds come together and exist and are able to exchange ideas and stimulate conversations which is so empowering and refreshing because I often feel isolated in these creative spaces.\n\nFrom Bristol to Manchester: History & Memory in Our Cities\n\nAfter writing and performing Britannia at the Whose Statues? Whose Stories? workshops I attended in Feb/March 2021, I had the chance to share my poem at Whitworth on the 1st of October 2021 at the From Bristol to Manchester: History & Memory in Our Cities public panel and Q&A hosted by Historian Professor David Olusoga and in front of an audience of policymakers, heads of museums, academics and senior university officials on how we should respond to debates around statues and Britain’s empire and colonialism.\n\nMy journey at OSCH is still ongoing and keeps me on my feet as there’s so much to talk about and dismantle. I hope this collective reaches the people it needs and that more young people are aware of this space and platform in order to incite the change we need to create.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe idea of neutrality is inherently political.\n\nLecturers tell me that seminar rooms and lecture halls are meant to be open for discussion, with no clear political agenda influencing the primary understanding of any single piece of knowledge. They are meant to be safe – safe for me to express myself, share thoughts and ideas, and feel as though each voice is levied with equal value and power to everyone else. Meanwhile museum curators tell me their institutions and exhibitions are ‘not meant to be political’; apparently, they are there to share knowledge, with their only agenda to exhibit information and allow visitors to form personal assumptions and understandings, untainted by any ulterior motive on the part of those displaying and presenting that knowledge.\n\nI stand there and wonder what goes through their minds when speaking. I conclude that they’re either hyper-aware and choosing to disassociate from the situation, or just another cog in the wheel. Acting subconsciously – although still with equal responsibility over the consequences of their actions – to hold up the translucent veil of neutrality that encircles these institutions. JSTOR holds a vast archive of academics discussing the politics of education, the politics of museum spaces, the politics of identity. One search and hundreds of pieces of evidence appear before your eyes. But the curtain never falls. Have you ever heard a politics lecturer claiming their lesson was not ‘political’, but just ‘the truth’? Have you been told you will lose marks without including critical analysis of sources and academics, but then been warned of that same criticality in office hours and meetings? The irony is not lost on anyone.\n\nSo how are young students of colour meant to exist in these so-called ‘neutral’ spaces, when their very identities have been politicised? How are they supposed to navigate their research methods and dissertation proposals to teachers that tell them to toe the line, be careful, ensure their writing is not explicitly negative in its approach to a topic in order to keep people happy? Play the game. Write just enough to get a tick for that ‘critical methodology’ but not too much to upset anyone. Even if your points are valid, just don’t bother going there. There’s no need – you’ll get a good mark anyway! Subtle hints, framed in a way so the issue is perceived to be about you. Protecting you. Advising you. Supporting you to create the best work possible. When it’s not, it’s about them, and their fear of rocking the boat.\n\nConscious decisions, & structured approaches – it’s always the same. An incident in a lecture hall. Note who is protected. Stay aware of who teachers reprimand, who head of departments expect an apology from, which students do not reappear in class again, what individual is framed as the ‘victim’, and who are the perpetrators. Can you be critical? To a point. Structural racism exists, Prevent exists, people of colour face a realm of policies and procedures and paperwork before a single problem can be presented to anyone. Yet education is supposed to encourage criticality, and every subject is steeped in politics. Whether it is discussed openly or pushed away is the only difference. & museums? They are clearly political spaces, from the very bricks that house exhibitions, to the object labels and curatorial panels (often lacking any diversity at all) that pluck a moment or event from the past, and decide on the presence and absence of certain information.\n\nBut it continues anyway – ‘neutrality’ in education, or rather, the conscious decision to erase any problematic hint of criticality from individuals whose opinions may upset the political agendas that thrive in these institutions. & also: a solid avoidance measure. Neutrality to escape the need for dismantling structures and institutions that need rebuilding. Support equality, diversity & inclusion, slap black and brown faces on university prospectuses, return stolen items that do not belong in your museum, run BAME events, wield ‘decolonisation’ as a shield to defend and distract against claims of apathy or inaction. But if it gets difficult? If a challenge arises? Run away. Be neutral.\n\nby hawwa alam.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nLast month, during South Asian Heritage Month, our Manchester Museum Young Collective reflected upon the Partition of India and the impact on young people in the UK today. We share our thoughts here:\n\nBy Ciara Garcha, Sadia Habib and Kamran Sajid\n\nPartition 1947. An arbitrary line etched into the face of a continent unleashed one of the most devastating events in modern world history. When British colonialists carved up the state, creating east and west Pakistan and a newly defined India, an estimated 14 million people migrated during the Partition of India. At least one million were killed in the ethnic and sectarian communal violence making this an episode of sheer bloodshed in South Asian history.\n\nToday in the UK, young people might get a tiny insight about Partition from our families and friends. Kamran recalls the first time he heard of Partition: as a child, he was watching a cricket match between India and Pakistan. His family were passionately cheering for Pakistan. He remembers asking his aunt why there was such a huge rivalry between the two countries, and she replied: “because of Partition.” And thus, in this way, we might pick up something from our families and our communities about the rivalry that came about because of the Partition of 1947. Such passing conversations though are not enough for young people to fully grasp the histories of that time and the consequences on multicultural lived realities today.\n\nAfter all, this was not just an important event in Indian history: Partition is a significant event in global and British history too. British administrators divided the continent, formally ending centuries of colonial entanglement and rule. Sir Cyril Radcliffe, the British civil servant, arrived from England only six weeks before Partition would be implemented to carve up India. Partition marked an acceleration towards hasty and often messy decolonisation in the aftermath of World War Two. The significance of the Partition of India on the identities of so many young people of South Asian descent in the UK and around the world is something that needs to be explored in cultural and educational spaces.\n\nPartition had a direct and profound impact on Britain. And continues to. Ramifications can still be felt today, in every neighbourhood, on many high streets and on the very fabric of modern Britain. The consequences of the Partition triggered a wave of migration to the UK; the British Asian community grew, and is one of the largest ethnic minority communities today.\n\nThe Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, a direct consequence of the creation of Partition and the inclusion of Eastern Bengal in Pakistan, created another state from the mess left behind by the British. The bloodshed created by the war between Pakistani forces is estimated to have claimed up to 3 million lives, causing – along with the arrival of South Asian refugees, expelled from East Africa – another growth in the British South Asian community. The children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of what had once been the empire’s ‘crowning jewel’ made new homes and built new lives in Britain.\n\nLearning about this key historical chapter is not just about understanding the origins of the British South Asian communities or comprehending the beginning of decolonisation, but helps us to understand what Britain was and what it could be. For the South Asians who fled the chaos of the Radcliffe Line, the Bengal Liberation War and expulsion in East Africa, Britain was a place of hope. It was somewhere that they could begin again, somewhere that offered a better life and more opportunities.\n\nIn understanding Britain’s historic duality as both oppressor and new home for the oppressed, as a source of pain and a source of hope, we can better understand the country as it is today. Viewing Britain as both a bloody colonial power and also a place of postcolonial optimism presents us with a nuanced and multi-dimensional picture. Learning about Partition necessitates looking back, to the messy process in 1947, to the formalisation of British rule in 1858, to the establishment of the British East India Company in 1600. But it also necessitates looking forwards from the point of Partition in 1947, to global South Asian migration and the contemporary British South Asian community. Beyond that, understanding our history – a truthful, often unpleasant, nuanced view of our history – helps us look beyond today: understanding who we were and who we now are helps us understand what we could be.\n\nYoung people rely on learning about their heritage from their families. Over the years, Kamran learned more and more about his family’s experiences of Partition. His grandfather told him stries of before Partition, Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs would attend one another’s weddings in their ancestral village of Gurha Ahmed, Jhelum. Partition brought an end to this. Kamran’s grandmother put it like this: “bas ek raat vich, dost ban gae dushman”. In just one night, friends became enemies.\n\nConversations of a similar tone have no doubt been had South Asians globally; those living in the subcontinent and diaspora communities alike. Humans are naturally curious about where they come from. What is unique to the South Asian experience is the Partition phenomena – an intense, tragic offshoot of British colonial legacy. A subject so violently all-encompassing, it leaves many who have lived memories from the time wishing they could forget them. This is by no means a reason not to educate about Partition, however. Rather, it makes widespread education about the subject all the more urgent.\n\nSouth Asian history seems to be a blind spot in the school curriculum. recall learning about Often for some young people Britain’s colonial legacy is mentioned in school in passing for instance in reference to the Slavery Abolition Act in 1833. Surely the History curriculum of a nation which once had the largest empire in human history should have more detailed and honest stories to tell? Not just about the virtues, but also the vices of its colonial legacy; opening its ear not only to British voices but also voices from other countries it occupied. Such a change to the British curriculum could be conducive to social progress beyond racial division – as the histories taught in schools and the histories discussed within the families of colonised peoples will not be so dichotomous, but appreciated in their complexity.\n\nA contemporary British education framework which seeks to teach South Asian histories should have Partition at its centre. It should encompass the subcontinent’s history both pre-and-post Partition – and significantly, focus on the voices of academics and writers, such as Rabindranath Tagore, Shashi Tharoor and Faiz Ahmed Faiz. The legacy of colonialism should be looked at critically; in a manner that does not seek to prioritise the image of the British Empire over the lived experience of South Asians.\n\nLong-perceived ‘virtues’ of the British Raj like the building of the railway cannot be used to legitimise British rule over India. Historically revered British figures such as Winston Churchill will be looked at critically – covering both his wartime legacy and his role in the Bengal Famine.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nby Sadia Habib\n\nBristol and beyond\n\nThe pulling down of the statue of Edward Colston on 7 June 2020 by Black Lives Matter (BLM) activists in Bristol was an act of solidarity with the BLM movement, and a remarkable turning point in cultural activism and protest in the UK. One year since Colston fell, he has now re-emerged in a new space: in a museum. His statue is now – temporarily – displayed at Bristol’s M Shed.\n\nIn another important moment for the people of Bristol, they’ve been invited to take part in a conversation about the future of this now infamous statue. The statue is displayed at M Shed alongside placards from the protest, as well as with a timeline of key events before Colston fell. The Museum, in partnership with the We Are Bristol History Commission, is keen to learn from M Shed visitors about what Bristolians think about the events that day last summer and also what should happen to the statue now.\n\nThe Museum has also provided an online space for responses to the statue, and no doubt people worldwide – connected or not to Bristol – will want to respond to the survey. After all, the infamous figure of Colston and his role in the trade of enslaved peoples is now well known nationally and globally; the iconic pictures of his statue pushed into the water went viral last summer, making him a household name. In the year that has passed, there has been much passionate debate and discussion: we have heard a lot from politicians, media commentators and cultural activists throughout the UK and beyond who’ve been ardently sharing their perspectives on contested statues of empire and colonialism.\n\nThe zeitgeist of the post-Colston period\n\nI’ve been working with colleagues on a research project at the Centre for Dynamic Ethnicity (CoDE) studying the changing shape of cultural activism, with the main focus being exploring perspectives on processes of contesting and removing statues that memorialise histories of slavery and colonialism. The research compares the contestation of statues cross-nationally, in places such as Britain, South Africa, the US, Martinique and Belgium. The preliminary findings of the research were shared in our presentation at the British Sociological Conference in April. Wearing my hat as the young people’s coordinator at Manchester Museum on a project entitled Our Shared Cultural Heritage (OSCH), I was keen to specifically research young people’s stories about statues in their towns and cities. I wanted to learn more about young people’s experiences. For example, how do young people feel about the figures memorialised in stone in the spaces they call home? What narratives are young people keen to share with one another? What do they think should happen to these statues? How do they talk about these reminders of the histories of empire and colonialism? And importantly what can we – as educators and museums staff – learn from young people who can perfectly capture the zeitgeist of the post-Colston period in UK history? After seeking ethical approval from the University of Manchester, I put a call out for young people interested in taking part in the research which I entitled Whose Statues? Whose Stories?\n\nWhose Statues? Whose Stories?\n\nIn the first session, young people reflected and discussed with one another stories about the statues of colonialism and empire in their towns and cities. Some had taken photographs of the statues prior to this session and had uploaded them to padlet. The young people presented their own perspectives on place identities, statues in their towns and cities, mainstream dominant narratives about the historical figures, as well as what stories they thought should be told about these statues. The following week in the second session, Dr Meghan Tinsley, Dr Chloe Peacock, Dr Ruth Ramsden-Karelse and Professor Gary Younge were invited to share research about statues from a historical perspective and in a global context. The third session brought along two talented wordsmiths Suhaiymah Manzoor-Khan and Muneera Pilgrim who impressed the young people with creative writing advice and inspiration; the fourth and final session resulted in young people performing some of the creative responses they had been working over the course of the sessions. After the last session one of the young people explained “I think I shed a tear or two listening to everybody recite their amazing work. Such a powerful session and it was so nice to hear everybody’s feedback. I left with a sense of pride and accomplishment, after doubting my artistic ability”.\n\nReflection and learning\n\nIt was evident to me that young people’s voices remained generally unheard or marginalised in the heated debates about statues, and yet they had been at the forefront of the cultural activism and BLM protests throughout the UK post-Colston. After the Whose Stories? Whose Statues? sessions, the young people highlighted that even though there had been so much media coverage over the past year after Colston was taken down, there were no spaces for young people to reflect upon the contested nature of statues of empire and colonialism.\n\nThe young people who participated in the sessions had welcomed safe spaces to explore the discourses around statues in nuanced ways with other young people, with researchers, and with spoken word artists:\n\n“I had thought about them before, and had touched on the issue in some university modules but I had never considered the complexity of removing the statues themselves and how the removal has to be thought about, rather than just petitioning for them to be taken down. So this workshop provided me with a new outlook”.\n\n“Yes, thought about them a lot in the summer where Britain’s unhealthy proximity to statues was evident! however the workshop provided me with so much more education”.\n\nThe sessions were spaces for critical reflection and mutual learning, as the young people shared their stories and learned from one another, and benefitted from hearing from the poets and the academic researchers, whilst we all learned from the young people. One of the young people described the atmosphere as “creative and inclusive”, and others commented on the depth of learning:\n\n“I loved how encouraging each workshop was and it was a really positive experience. I felt really comfortable every session and was able to learn so much from everyone else attending”.\n\n“How engaging the conversations were and bouncing off others who had such great interest in these issues. Being inspired by the work by others in the project as well as the guest speakers who gave such intellectual and powerful contributions”.\n\n“I loved the way the workshop was hosted and run to ensure people felt comfortable speaking and sharing opinions, Suhaiymah and Muneera were also amazing and insanely talented and it was so fun to learn and listen to them”.\n\n“I really liked the camaraderie, it felt like a really safe space to discuss these issues with a group of people who were also really passionate about this topic. It also felt very supportive”.\n\nThere is still so much learning to be done, and an urgent need for museums and schools to provide spaces for young people to share their stories about how their identities and belongings are impacted by their experience of what is revered in the public realm. As Gary Younge recently wrote in The Guardian, “in Britain, we seem to have a peculiar fixation with statues, as we seek to petrify historical discourse, lather it in cement, hoist it high and insist on it as a permanent statement of fact, culture, truth and tradition that can never be questioned, touched, removed or recast. This statue obsession mistakes adulation for history, history for heritage and heritage for memory”.\n\nHow do we disrupt this peculiar fixation? How do we continue to question the mainstream versions of history we learn in schools? I hope we can build on the courage of young cultural activists in the Colston moment and after. As a museum it is our responsibility to provide opportunities for younger generations to engage in individual and collective critical reflection about the ways that social institutions doggedly preserve history and heritage, and importantly how this might impacts young people’s sense of belonging to Britain.\n\nComing up next\n\nIn the next few weeks, we will be developing opportunities for more young people to join safe spaces to explore identities and belongings, as well sharing publications for young people, teachers and heritage staff:\n\nOn the 21st of July, one of our young Manchester Museum OSCH Collective members will lead a poetry workshop Belonging: Space & Place for young people to explore themes of identities, decolonisation, as well as statues of empire & colonialism.\n\nWatch out for a call out for young people to contribute to a zine entitled Whose Statues? Whose Stories?\n\nOn our social media, we will be sharing recordings of powerful poems by two young people from the Manchester Museum OSCH Collective that will also feature in a CoDE video with Dr Ruth Ramsden-Karelse.\n\nA Runnymede briefing will provide policy recommendations – The Changing Shape of Cultural Activism: Legislating Statues in the Context of the Black Lives Matter Movement.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nDIGITAL INTERNS REFLECT SERIES\n\nAs part of the OSCH/ Kick the Dust project, throughout 2020 and 2021, Manchester Museum recruited six impressive interns. As a result of COVID, the interns worked digitally and taught us so much about how young people can engage with heritage online in collaborative ways! I’ve asked each of the 6 interns to share their journeys and experiences with us, and what has resulted is 6 fascinating must-read accounts of young people writing about cultural heritage…\n\nIn this article, Hannah powerfully expresses what young people’s involvement in museums can and should look like, if museum staff care enough to make space for young people to explore their identities and heritage.\n\nby Hannah Rustomjee\n\nThe Manchester Museum is an encyclopaedic museum, a western colonial institution with collections of natural science and human culture taken from colonised peoples and places. It is important to recognise that the provenance of these objects may have been acquired through loot, plunder and pillage. As vast quantities of the materials in the collections were taken by colonialists, they were typically used in exhibitions, research and teaching to support and promote theories of white dominance and superiority. Museums are not neutral and it therefore remains pertinent that they address the cultural needs of communities using the resources and other assets in their collections to avoid reproducing colonial narratives. Within this, I have often thought about the idea of care. How can an institution born as a place of violence move past its history rooted in biases and exclusions and instead create active discussions around care. I believe this is where the Manchester Museum Our Shared Cultural Heritage (OSCH) project comes in. The way OSCH has developed at Manchester Museum as a project of care has given young people new hope for (re)imagining our current institutions, to envision what we want and need from them, and to ask ourselves what it would mean if more museums actively involved young people in committed and caring ways.\n\nOSCH is a youth-led project that explores the shared cultures and histories of the UK and South Asia. The OSCH project acts as a way of ensuring greater accessibility for the communities and groups that are and have been historically excluded or stereotyped by arts, culture and heritage sectors. As an OSCH community producer intern, this project provided me with a unique opportunity to explore and connect with our South Asian (diasporic) identities.\n\nAs mentioned in a previous blog post, when I applied for the position I was worried I wouldn’t be ‘enough’ to fill the shoes of the community producer role. I felt like I would be taking up space that would be better suited to someone more in touch with their South Asian heritage or someone who knew what being part of a ‘community’ feels like. However, the OSCH Manchester Museum Young Collective were so welcoming towards me. They gave me a platform to talk about my experience as an individual of mixed heritage, which in turn, helped me have conversations I have often previously avoided. What made this so special was that the coordinator also gave others both inside and outside of the collective opportunities to share and contribute their own experiences of (un)belonging. In the words of Kylie Message (2018), “I feel like I belong when I am made to feel welcome”. The OSCH project certainly welcomed me and my ideas. As for belonging, OSCH went above and beyond what I expected.\n\nAs a collective, we planned and featured on a podcast exploring the theme of belonging for the Manchester Museum and we were also invited to be panelists at events focused on diaspora, languages and identity.\n\nMy role also enabled me to set up a TikTok to deliver digital content for the South Asia Studios. Here, we showcased the South Asia Fashion Lookbook, Naheeda’s cooking series and collaborated with the ‘Decolonise UoM’ campaign at the University of Manchester who helped unpack and redefine terminology related to postcolonial and decolonial theory. Tiktok has been a fun way of making our engagement work more accessible to the audiences often excluded from museums. I feel that quite often young people don’t view museums as a place that speaks to their identities and interests and given the past year has been online, TikTok has been a great platform to engage with younger and more diverse audiences.\n\nOSCH shouldn’t be the exception, it should be the rule. Interning with OSCH Manchester has made me realise how museums can move beyond ‘diversity’ and ‘inclusion’ buzzwords through centering the views and experiences of young and diverse people. I will always be grateful for the commitment of the Manchester Museum staff in including the perspectives and voices of those that such institutions have historically excluded. Whilst the OSCH project is only a three year programme, I hope the work and efforts to include us in the sector will not be brought to an end. The sense of belonging that this project has produced exemplifies the need for museums to embed this inclusive praxis within their structures in order to stay relevant to the needs of the 21st century. The experience and relationships gained from this internship have been invaluable and have given me the confidence and encouragement to seek a career in the heritage sector once I graduate. I’d like to thank Sadia and Baz for supporting the project and for their encouragement throughout.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nDIGITAL INTERNS REFLECT SERIES\n\nAs part of the OSCH/ Kick the Dust project, throughout 2020 and 2021, Manchester Museum recruited six impressive interns. As a result of COVID, the interns worked digitally and taught us so much about how young people can engage with heritage online in collaborative ways! I’ve asked each of the 6 interns to share their journeys and experiences with us, and what has resulted is 6 fascinating must-read accounts of young people writing about cultural heritage…\n\nIn this article, law student Roheema shares her experiences as a digital producer doing a range of activities including social media management, event organising and hosting, supporting work experience students and much more…\n\nby Roheema Yasmin\n\nAs a Digital Producer for Manchester Museum, I created digital content for South Asian Heritage Month (SAHM) between July and August last year. This mostly consisted of working on the social media team therefore, I posted on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn every day about the upcoming events and opportunities available to people during this month. I also helped create the calendar on the Manchester Museum in Quarantine website which highlighted the amazing variety of events being hosted during this month; for example, I attended the fashion bizarre panel discussion which discussed cultural appropriation versus cultural appreciation. It highlighted how people have immersed themselves into South Asian culture and the pros and cons of this.\n\nFurthermore, I hosted a South Asian history panel discussion in collaboration with my colleague Hawwa Alam, with Shalina Patel, a history teacher and founder of @thehistorycorridor on Instagram, and with Salma Khaliq who is also a history teacher. We came together to discuss and explain different aspects of South Asian history, from India’s partition to the Liberation War. This was an amazing experience for me as someone who always felt like they were never truly represented in the history that they were taught at school, this opportunity allowed us to speak freely about our history and celebrate the great parts and also shed light on the more unattractive parts.\n\nAdditionally, as digital producer I had the opportunity to manage 8 work experience interns. They had the task of creating content and I helped mentor them to ensure they finished their projects on time. There was a range of projects from interviews to blog pieces to podcasts. It really was an amazing experience to work with them as they’re all so talented and I gained some new skills. I strengthened my leadership skills and teamwork skills which are vital skills to have.\n\nMy most favourite moment of working at the Museum is definitely being interviewed by BBC Radio Manchester. Myself and my colleagues were interviewed by Talat Awan who asked us about how got involved in this role and why this month is so important to us. I was thrilled to share my own experiences as a South Asian woman and how representation is really important to me and I really appreciated this opportunity to share the amazing work would we be doing for SAHM and promote it to many other South Asians and non-South Asians to get involved. I definitely think 15-year-old Roheema would be very proud of this particular moment knowing that I helped contribute to the first ever SAHM in the UK and being able to have my voice heard on BBC Radio!\n\nWhat I learned from this experience was the importance behind this month. Being able to share so much history, culture and experiences demonstrated that South Asian history is crucial to Britain and in understanding why I am here today. If I was not aware of my own history, background and ancestry then I don’t think I would’ve been able to resolve the identity issues that 15-year-old Roheema seemed to have as after this month I felt like it finally gave South Asians a safe space and a month dedicated to them.\n\nMoreover, the fantastic and creative parts of this job have been learning consistently. I don’t think I have stopped learning since day one in terms of training, knowledge, experience and skills. When I thought I knew one part of history, my role would allow me to explore this further and develop deeper into alternative narratives and gain a full picture of historical context which is always fascinating to read and learn.\n\nFinally, I’ve built some amazing relationships with my colleagues at the Museum. They have helped me gain and develop a plethora of skills ranging from digital content creation, time management and organisational skills and social media marketing skills which are impressive transferable skills to take way from this role and utilise future jobs.\n\nIn contrast, the first main challenge I faced in my role has probably been communication with other people to ensure the consistent branding promotion and marketing of the work that we did during SAHM. For example, there were many people working on this one month, however we needed to advertise all the promotional content through one channel, so this created some difficulty in communication and marketing. Eventually, we all worked together to promote the content effectively and it gained high exposure and insights on our social media platforms.\n\nAnother challenge I faced was time management. This is because I am a Law student at the University of Manchester, and I was also working at TK Maxx at the time alongside other extracurricular commitments. Therefore, I had to consistently balance my workload and all my other commitments to ensure I met deadlines on time. Fortunately, I have an amazing manager who was very supportive if I ever needed to take a day off work or needed some extra time to get back to him with something.\n\nOn top of this, I think the amazing thing about being part of the OSCH Young Collective is that it’s already starting to create change and transform museums with the help of young people. It provides them with the crucial opportunities like workshops, panel discussions and podcasts to share the alternative narratives for museums to work with more young people in order to make it more accessible and appealing to them.\n\nFurthermore, I think museums need to have close relations and build relationships with communities. This is to create community building and maintain their engagement so that they’re aware of how to get involved in museums are what is available to them and how they can get involved to showcase the modernisation of museums.\n\nI would like to thank Baz, Sadia, my colleagues and Esme for this amazing opportunity to work at Manchester Museum. Baz and Sadia have been amazing mentors whilst working in this role and have shown me the importance of having more diverse representation in the museum and providing an avenue for the young people to get involved into museums. Ultimately, I am very grateful to have had the opportunity to work on SAHM and this internship was fortunately continued after this. Thank you so much to everyone at the museum for welcoming me and allowing me to celebrate who I am and educate others on my history.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nDIGITAL INTERNS REFLECT SERIES\n\nAs part of the OSCH/ Kick the Dust project, throughout 2020 and 2021, Manchester Museum recruited six impressive interns.

I’ve asked each of the 6 interns to share their journeys and experiences with us, and what has resulted is 6 fascinating must-read accounts of young people writing about cultural heritage…\n\nTo kick off the series, we begin with Hawwa critically examining what it means to be a young person of colour navigating white eurocentric education and heritage sites…\n\nby Hawwa Alam\n\nI never particularly liked museums, or art galleries when I was younger. White walls, whispers, art you could not get close to and had to murmur under your breath about, avoiding the gaze of adults who would look at you disapprovingly for breaking the ‘aesthetic’ silence of the gallery. Or just: stuffed animals, objects in glass cases, small labels with bare minimum information that did not offer anything interesting to me – no cultural stories, very little living/social history, nothing that made me feel connected or represented. My opinions did not change even after starting university and studying history. The more I read about museums and public history, and the more places I visited and exhibitions I explored, the more disconnected I felt. Instead of encouraging a greater appreciation for such spaces, learning more about the past and the way it is currently represented made me dislike these institutions even more.\n\nStudying history didn’t really allow me to find a group or a place of belonging to explore ideas and concepts and aspects of the past that meant a lot to me, that interested me, or that contributed to my own identity and existence, because the history I was offered was still that ‘bare minimum’. A week dedicated to ‘race’ or ‘gender’ or ‘slavery’. A module on colonial history and a module on Islamic history with lecturers who did not represent/were not related to any element of the knowledge they were teaching – and this is not to say they were not good teachers. Many of them were completely open to me finding alternative avenues within the given topics on offer that I could explore in more detail, & it doesn’t mean they did not have a right to become a specialist in such subjects – but it just goes to show the lack of effort at an institutional level that is given to cultivating a diverse and dynamic group of professors in higher education [not to mention the many reasons students of colour never become professors in the first place] to teach on topics that are close to them. In my entire time studying history, I was never taught by a single person who was Asian, and I’ve only ever seen one individual who was. Yet how many white professors were there? I couldn’t keep track.\n\nBecause of this experience, and the way I have existed around and within spaces of history and culture that have perhaps sometimes been about my identity, but never felt constructed or created for me (to contribute, to feel comfortable within) – I honestly hesitated a little when I saw the advertisement for the role of a ‘Digital Producer’ for Manchester Museum (to work on South Asian Heritage Month). I’d never seen a person of colour working in a museum space before, and I was scared that I would be working around people who again, would be attempting to build and develop a space they had no connection to besides their job, who did not have the lived experience and immersion into the culture/heritage they worked on to truly appreciate the need for nuance and alternative narratives when conveying SA history to an audience. Even if you are a renowned specialist in a topic, if you cannot walk a mile in someone’s shoes, you arguably can never truly understand how it is to live, to just exist and see the world from their perspective.\n\nThey always say people make the job – and it’s true. Without Sadia, and Baz (and my colleagues/the OSCH Collective!), OSCH would not be as wonderful as it is. Before, discussing & learning about my identity, culture, heritage and history made me feel empty. The conversations felt hollow. Yet for once in my life, being part of a space completely made up of people of colour, led by people of colour, felt so freeing. It meant I could discuss topics or comment on subjects that would have never even been a consideration, and I got to work on producing events and participating in workshops that I genuinely cared about, things that made me feel excited (which, within the museum industry and when related to non-Eurocentric narratives of history, is very rare).\n\nThrough the role, I participated in the ‘Whose Stories? Whose Statues’ project (thinking about alternative ways to view the act of memorialising, and working on creative responses), I spoke on BBC Radio Manchester about the importance of sharing South Asian history/heritage to a public audience, I was involved in a History Q&A Panel with two South Asian history teachers and my colleague Roheema (where we talked about hidden South Asian histories, navigating higher education as a person of colour history student and the importance of ‘decolonising’ the curriculum). I wrote a poem about my relationship with South Asian history and museum spaces which was picked up by a number of high schools in London and used in history classrooms/in school diversity trainings, and I have created posters/promotional material & participated in a whole number of other events: a workshop on the Birangona & the Bangladesh Liberation War, a series of creative workshops on colourism, monologues about identity, a poetry night, a podcast on belonging, and so many other events and opportunities that allowed me to learn & grow from the people around me.\n\nEvery now and then I wonder why other museums don’t follow the lead of Sadia, and how she has cultivated OSCH and created a space for young people to feel seen and heard and comfortable to express themselves, and to take the lead on projects and events they want to produce, because on the one hand – it’s not hard. If I learnt anything at all from my history degree and my studying related to public history, is that it’s really not difficult for big institutions to give people a voice. But then I remember why other museums don’t try: because people make it complicated. People who prefer ‘normalcy’ and ‘tradition’ and fear change because it disrupts what they are used to and what they know and what they prefer. Because it shifts power dynamics and highlights that hierarchies within creative and cultural institutions are fundamentally built on structural discrimination and institutional racism. Because it means assigning value to things that some don’t think are ‘worthwhile’. Allocating funding to initiatives that are too far removed from what they are ‘comfortable’ with. Reading for my public history course and my dissertation at university often brought up the issue of ‘funding’ and ‘time’ as a reason for the upkeep of tradition, but there is always money, and there is always time. It just depends on who you want to give it to, what you want to help grow, and what you think is or isn’t important.\n\nI’ve seen the behind the scenes of how museums operate, either first-hand, from conversations with others or from people sharing their thoughts from other institutions, and how difficult it is for people of colour to exist within the creative/cultural/heritage industries, and it usually makes me feel angry. But that anger makes me want to keep going, and try anyway, and continue to be involved in places like OSCH, to see if anything will ever change, and to continue to help create spaces that so many young people want and wish for. My time working with and participating in OSCH events emphasised how incredible everyone I work with is. How many fantastic ideas they have for exploring and sharing their identity, culture and history and how – if they were given even more room and opportunity to grow, they would take up that space in such beautiful and inspiring ways.\n\nOne of the moments I will always remember from my role is from a conversation a few members of the collective had with Sadia, on a museum podcast about belonging. She encouraged us to reframe our understanding of our identity, and to move away from using the term ‘identity crisis’ to represent the way we feel about our faith/culture/heritage/history, and to instead question the reason for this narrative, rethink it, and to see (and feel comfortable with) identity as a process of learning and development that doesn’t necessarily need to have an endpoint, and hence is never in ‘crisis’, but rather just in constant growth. The discussion really epitomised for me my entire experience working for/participating in OSCH – a role where, yes, I developed my practical skills, but more importantly for me, where I was able to contribute towards building spaces where young people of colour felt comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions in a variety of ways. As basic as that might seem to some, for people who haven’t felt comfortable their entire lives when discussing their identity, culture & heritage – or have never even had the opportunity to do so in a non-judgemental space – that opportunity/experience (for once) makes you feel so full.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nby Dr Fatima Rajina\n\nFollowing World War II, many former subjects of the British empire were arriving in the metropole. The new migrants were no longer exotic beings ‘over there’ but were now ‘here’ amongst us. Initially, the wider British society was getting to grips with South Asian men, but more South Asian women, wives, daughters, and mothers were arriving with each decade. This rupture in the gendered migration would lead to some of the most significant moments in history, witnessing collaborations between African-Caribbean and Asian women. The latter, who have historically been constructed as meek, timid and forever silent, subverted all the imposed stereotypes and changed the landscape for other South Asian women. These women took on industrial bosses as they did with the Grunwick Strike (1976-78), even when they encountered defeat, they always stood with their head help up high.\n\nI read the first 1978 edition of Finding a Voice in 2018. While I was reading the book, I realised that so little has changed for South Asian women in the UK. The structural subjugation and denigration of South Asian women continue; it’s just that they are manifested in different ways. While the taxonomy of ‘race’ is ever precarious in categorising people and the goalposts changing, South Asian women have been forged in different ways in the contemporary imagination, primarily through religious affiliations.\n\nIn this thoroughly detailed book, Amrit Wilson intricately narrates South Asian women’s stories and their encounters with the British state’s violence. How so many of these women were failed, both locally and nationally, from universities to hospitals to, at times, by their own community. We learn about the multiple, often entangled, migration patterns to the UK whether directly from the Indian subcontinent or through previous migration to East Africa. People’s complicated and complex class, caste and land-ownership backgrounds very much informed these different migration patterns, a correlation evident in the wealth we see today in the respective South Asian communities.\n\nWilson, very diligently, takes us on this journey in the book where we hear the women’s voices directly through multiple languages, such as: Bengali, Hindi, Urdu and English.\n\nWilson assures readers that we WILL hear the women’s voices directly. She refuses to cater to the violent, white gaze that silences women while, somewhat ironically, meting colonial stereotyping of these women as silent. There are multiple ways in which the state becomes entangled in South Asian women’s oppression, and Wilson takes us on a journey to showcase these examples in candid and raw ways. The readers are exposed to how newly arrived women would go through a ‘sexual examination’ at the border. Such examinations ‘had become common practice at Heathrow immigrant Department, apparently carried out at the whim of the officials’ (p. 88). This would be used as a way to determine if they were ‘too old’ to be dependent, thereby declaring their entry fraudulent. If a woman’s medical report stated her as not a virgin, she’d get disowned by her family.\n\nThe women who had children found themselves as part of the state’s experiment in bussing their children to schools outside of their catchment areas. This state intervention attempted to manage the Asian communities by coercively enforcing assimilationist tendencies because they feared they would become the majority in schools closer to their homes. Bussing, contrary to ‘assimilating’ the young people, opened up opportunities for racists to attack young Asians. Wilson provides the example of a young Pakistani boy in October 1975 who ‘was killed by a gang of white boys at a bus stop’ (p. 113). The state intervening to tell women how best to raise their children is not new. Contemporarily, we see this unfolding through the Prevent Strategy, a government policy designed to surveil young, predominantly Muslims and, by extension, create a matrix for people to grass on one another. The state instrumentalising the South Asian Muslim woman’s body is always hanging off a thread, dangling between two positions: one where these women require liberating but, simultaneously, these women can help the state in managing their own communities, including their own children.\n\nAway from the state’s gaze, Wilson also taps into the struggles the South Asian women had to put up with within their own communities. This included the joy many women felt at earning their own money (chapter 5) despite receiving little support from their families – something that would have been unthinkable if they had remained in their respective countries. However, this romanticism of earning money was very quickly met to realise how these women were being exploited across the factories, mills and sweatshops. Surinder, a Sikh woman expands on this:\n\n‘For a long time I never realised how badly paid and overworked I was, but what made me feel bad in those days was the rudeness and lack of respect with which I and other Asian women were treated by the supervisors. Now I have begun to understand, bad pay, rotten conditions and this insufferable contempt shown to us, it is a part of the same picture.’ (p. 62)\n\nThe maltreatment of South Asian women workers is captured in striking ways (pun intended!) by Wilson as she narrates the fight the Grunwick Strikers had to go through, also known as the Strikers in Saris. Through this strike, we learn about the sheer levels of humiliation so many women were experiencing because of how they were racialised. This moment in history also illustrates the multiple fights the Gujarati women had to put up with, including challenging the patriarchal ways the Gujarati community expected women not to cause too much noise. Wilson interviews one of the Grunwick strikers, Jayaben Desai, who clarifies this:\n\n‘Personally I don’t think it is traditions which are weighing them down but the fact that they have no support at home. Their husbands don’t want them to do anything which is not passive, and in the end women end up believing the same.’ (p. 76)\n\nDespite being confronted with these gendered expectations, Jayaben Desai and Kalaben Patel continued to mobilise other women to join them on the picket line while families prevented other women from taking part. It is also noteworthy to mention how the owner of Grunwick, George Ward, an Anglo-Indian attempted to intimidate the women. He resorted to insulting the women by saying how he will ‘tell the whole Patel community that you are a bad woman!’ (p.77). This is an important point to consider given the fact that he recognised that these women were required to follow a particular behavioural code as ascribed by their community but specifically their caste heritage.\n\nThe respectability politics women are required to abide by is enforced by observing the woman’s dress. For example, Wilson talks to women about how they negotiated and navigated dress. Both Sikh young girls from Newham and Birmingham, explain how their families were not happy when they chose to wear a t-shirt and a pair of jeans. The shalwar kameez functioned as the site where women’s bodies were analysed. The dupatta or chunni, the scarf, had to be used to cover one’s head and to make sure it ‘folded over her chest and having over her shoulders or loosely placed around her neck’ (p. 48). The decision around what to wear did not solely rest with the woman alone but the nuclear and extended family. If the woman was married, this also tended to rest in the mother-in-law’s hands.\n\nWilson very poignantly captures the way so many of these women experience isolation. Arriving in a new country and trying to settle in, adapting to the grey weather and adopting this new environment as their home was not an easy one. The women share their deep reservoir of memories, of communalism and collective creations of womanhood in open spaces. Now in the UK, space was experienced in a carceral sense. This sense of womanhood, or lack thereof, made it very difficult for many of these women who had been socialised into communal living, including getting help with raising children. This loss meant women did not have access to spaces where they could deposit their thoughts, share their love, loss and, in some sense, it ruptured their sense of self. Losing the self in a country that did not want them, and where racism was a part of these women’s daily encounters (p. 26).\n\nWilson portrays these women as survivors and, additionally, she so effectively showcases the multi-layered ways in which these women experience oppression. She questions how the state also participates in using the woman’s body as a site of violence and using that to manage its borders. She also acknowledges how there has been a splintering of identities among the Asian community along religious lines. With the rise in Hindutva politics, supported by India’s current government, it has further entrenched this divide. My only criticism of the book would be the lack of references to the ways in which colonialism and colonial experiences in the subcontinent informed and shaped the experiences here in the UK. In order to understand the multi-faceted brutalisations South Asian women encounter in the diaspora, it is vital to link it back to colonialism.\n\nDespite this, I am hopeful and optimistic we will be able to build solidarity across the different ethnic and religious communities among South Asians. The re-centring of marginal voices opens up the possibility to avert the gaze away from the dominant narratives entrenched in saviourism. We need to recognise that we are currently residing in the metropole of the British Raj that once ruled over our ancestors. This colonial metropole is where we need to remember that it still uses women as its greatest weapon against different communities. This weaponisation is disguised behind grand words like liberation, empowerment and emancipation. We need to resist this age-old tactic of divide and conquer by the colonisers and build bridges that will help find ourselves in each other. As Rabindranath Tagore wrote in his Ekla Cholo Re song (Walk Alone My Friend) in 1905:\n\n‘If no one answers your call,\n\nThen walk alone, (be not afraid) walk alone, my friend.\n\nIf no one talks to you,\n\nO my unlucky friend, if no one speaks to you,\n\nIf everyone looks the other way/turns away and everyone is afraid,\n\nThen bare your soul and let out what is in your mind,\n\n(be not afraid) Speak alone, my friend.\n\nWhen dark clouds cover the sky, When darkness engulfs the truth,\n\nWhen the world cowers and bows before fear,\n\nYou are the flame, The flame that burns you and banishes darkness from the world,\n\n(be not afraid) Burn alone, my friend.’ (My translation)\n\nDr Fatima Rajina is a Legacy in Action Research Fellow at the Stephen Lawrence Research Centre at De Montfort University.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe Indian Workers’ Association (IWA) was founded with a variety of multi-faceted aims. Initially, their work promoted India’s liberation from the British Raj, whilst also providing a hub and meeting place for Indians within Britain. Its international political aims were thus integrated with its domestic purposes; the movement formally established in Coventry in 1939, aimed at making changes both to the everyday lives of its members and changing the global landscape.\n\nThe IWA reached its peak in the postwar period, but it was between the First and Second World War that Indian, principally Punjabi, immigrants started to arrive in noteworthy numbers. They worked in a variety of jobs, from peddlers, selling their wares on the streets and at markets, to factory workers, laboring amongst the rattling of machinery. Work places were often highly politicised and in some cases radical environments. In the context of the Great Depression, trade unions were key political players, fighting hard to represent their members, as unemployment rocketed, and poverty along with it. Yet intolerance was also a staple of the workplace and an uncomfortable feature of many trade unions. Immigrants were, in some cases, explicitly excluded out of trade unions and prohibited from membership. At its inception in 1938/39, the IWA was designed to step in and fill this void in the lives of Indian labourers.\n\nOn account of its industry, particularly textiles and motor industries, Coventry was one of the first significant hubs of South Asian and Indian immigration. After its founding at a residential house, the IWA held its meetings mostly within its members’ homes. In this way, the early IWA seems to have been more than merely a workers’ association, transcending the border between the world of work and the personal and domestic environments of their members. Linking the public and the private in this way allowed the IWA to take on characteristics of a support network and a community group for the small Indian population. The IWA was not just a workers’ group, functioning in public places and the world of work; its aims and ideas stretched into the homes and personal lives of its members, setting it apart from the rigid organisation of other larger trade unions and workers associations.\n\nEven as numbers of immigrants swelled after the end of World War Two, and IWA branches were set up across the country, (the Birmingham and Southall groups, for example, soon surpassing the Coventry group in terms of size and infrastructure,) overall, it seems that the organisation maintained its emphasis on acting as a support network for the welfare of its members. The immigration policy adopted by Clement Attlee’s Labour government, of encouraging immigration from the Commonwealth, made up of the former territories of the British Empire, saw immigration from across the globe. Britain had once stretched its power and brutal authority over a quarter of the world, but now opened its doors to different communities, cultures and races. The arrival of Indian immigrants in this period contributed to the steady growth of local IWA branches, which united to form the Indian Workers’ Association of Great Britain, IWAGB, in 1958. Estimations put membership as peaking somewhere around 20,000 people, however the actual figure is disputed.\n\nYet, even as numbers climbed, the IWA continued to play a prominent and supportive role in the lives of its members. Newer immigrants, who lacked English language skills, benefited from the use of translators and the social network the IWA provided for those who lacked familiar support and connections within their new home. As Talvinder Gill points out, acting as translators and pastoral support for newer members gave the IWA, “a great deal of power to influence the political direction of the emerging local Indian population”. By acting as a bridge between the British Indian community and wider English-speaking society, the IWA could provide both practical and political advice, directing more recent immigrants away from certain unreliable employers, but towards radical workplace politics. The pastoral function of the IWA appears to have been a necessary mechanism in allowing the movement to grow, harnessing the waves of Indian immigration to the organisation, through the involvement in the personal and social lives of immigrants.\n\nThis social network also accelerated the development and celebration of Indian arts and culture within the UK. Several IWA groups used cinema, in particular, to bind its members together, giving them the chance to celebrate the culture of India in their new homes. Films would be imported or rented from the Indian High Commission and screened in cinemas specially rented out for members. The Southall branch of the IWA even purchased the Dominion Cinema in 1965, with the aim of turning it into a hub of South Asian and Indian cinema. Part of the money to buy the cinema was raised from donations by local and national IWA members, amounting to around £25,000. In its prime, 8,000 people descended on the Dominion Cinema a week, coming from right across the country. A decline in income, however, led to the Southall IWA leasing the cinema building to Ealing Council. South Asian cinema continued to be used as a valuable tool in creating links amongst members and the wider community, beyond the scope of a traditional workers’ association or union.\n\nFollowing on from the activism of the Ghadar Party, founded on the Pacific Coast of North America, and the Communist Party in India, the IWA saw itself as descended from an illustrious tradition of Indian radicalism and anti-colonialism. The movement’s questionable and widely disputed links with revolutionary Udham Singh, assassin of Michael O’Dwyer (the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab during the 1919 Jallinwalabagh Massacre) added a mysterious lustre to the IWA’s history and place within this radical politics, helping it to depict itself as the latest iteration of this rich tradition. The Ghadar Party, though oriented towards and focused on liberation from the British Raj, saw the value of tapping into workplace democracy and the politics of Indian labourers on the Pacific Coast of the USA and Canada. Lumber mill workers and agricultural labourers were a significant source of support for the Ghadar Party, thus, marrying anti-colonialism with class politics. The Communist Party of India, founded in 1925, was the embodiment of this combination, linking class oppression to imperial oppression far more explicitly than the Ghadar Party had done. The IWA sought to continue in this mold, yet its commitment to class politics sometimes caused conflict with its anti-racist agenda.\n\nThe dual focus of the IWA on the politics of both class and race did, however, cause a number of the frequent and often infamous ruptures that checker the organisation’s history. Though seemingly interlinked, many members and branches argued for a stronger separation between the IWA’s Marxist and anti-racist agendas and a firmer focus on the latter. Gurharpal Singh and Darshan Singh Tatla describe the IWA as having a “hardened communist ideology”, emphasising building class-consciousness amongst its members. The Southall branch cited this in withdrawing from the IWAGB in 1961, complaining of the preoccupation with Marxist ideologies. Yet fundamental to the IWA’s role and character was this fusion of class and race politics, a careful balance had to be struck to ensure that these joint causes were kept in harmony moving forwards.\n\nThough over 4,000 miles away, the membership of the IWA was also split in line with developments in South Asia. In an interview conducted in 1993 one member, Anant Ram, recalled how Partition in 1947 and “split” the members and contributed to its decline, which lasted into the 1950s until the organisation was revived by another wave of migrants. Indeed, as the definition of ‘India’ changed, it seems inevitable that the extent of those who sought membership and identified themselves with IWA would change. Punjabi members had hitherto formed the majority of the ranks of the IWA, but as the state was ripped in half by the Radcliffe Line, Punjabi South Asians were split between India and the new state of Pakistan. From Partition onwards, the IWA continued to be impacted by political events in South Asia, its unity frequently being shook by developments abroad.\n\nHowever, in spite of both ideological and national divides; the national membership of the IWA frequently came together to fight against workplace discrimination and other labour-related disputes. In its role as a workers union, the IWA was formidable and had extensive successes, rallying workers around its leadership. Fighting issues including segregated facilities, low pay and racist work discrimination, the IWA was behind several mass strikes, particularly in the Midlands and the South. The organisation lent their support to the strikes at the Midland Motor Cycle Factory in 1968 and during the labour disputes Dunn’s factory in Nuneaton, between 1972 and 1973, amongst other industrial actions across the country. The IWA was also involved in high-profile attempts to overturn the ban on turban wearing within the transport profession, reportedly spending around £60,000 on the campaign.\n\nIn the context of the radicalism of the postwar environment, the IWA was involved in a chorus of radical, anti-racist and anti-imperial movements, which reached its peak in the decades after the end of World War Two. As the world was finally largely decolonised and the fight for civil rights played out all over the globe, the IWA was an important organ for British South Asian communities in battling the racism so deeply embedded in British society. The IWA stood alongside a number of anti-racist groups, particularly in the period when the American and, eventually, global Black Power movement reached its peak. Black Power advocated a radical approach to dealing with the racist structures of everyday life and preached having pride in one’s racial identity. These were messages that the IWA willingly tapped into, combining its own radicalism with support for British South Asian communities and other marginalised communities.\n\nIn the age when ‘No Blacks, No Irish, No Dogs’ signs adorned windows and doors, the IWA was instrumental in standing against some of the most notorious racist individuals and organisations of 20thcentury Britain. As Enoch Powell prophesied of “rivers of blood” and the National Front urged all immigrants to leave their country, the IWA frequently took to the streets to speak up for respect and equality for all. The IWA group in Southall spoke up in opposition to the Ealing Council allowing the avowedly racist National Front to host meetings in the town hall in April 1973. When they were unsuccessful, the group held a march through Ealing, alongside other anti-racist organisations, including the Anti-Nazi League. Though the demonstrations were peaceful, over 2,000 police officers deployed and things soon took a turn for the worst. Teacher, Blair Peaches, attended the demonstrations on 23 April and was struck on the head by a member of the police’s Special Control Group and died in hospital later that night. His body was laid in the Dominion Cinema, before his burial, which was attended by approximately 10,000 people. Peaches’ coffin was carried by turbaned Sikhs and members of the Southall Asian community, as well as white anti-racist allies.\n\nThough the IWA has played a central role in anti-racist activism and workplace democracy in 20thcentury Britain, critics have argued that its work was limited in important respects. Talvinder Gill points to the IWA’s mixed record on women’s rights and caste-related issues. Despite its Marxist approach to class, caste prejudices and allegiances still overshadowed many IWA members – consciously and unconsciously. Though the organisation did attract members of all castes, it was mainly comprised of Jatt Sikhs and failed to make any real ground on caste discrimination within the UK. Similarly, as a male-dominated organisation, Talvinder Gill goes on to claim that the IWA were largely inactive on women’s rights struggles within the home and family setting regarding domestic violence and sexual abuse- areas which Gill claims were seen as “private”. The IWA does have a very strong record at standing up for women’s rights within the, perhaps more comfortable, context of the workplace. For example, the proliferation of sweatshops across the UK, which were often owned by Asians and employed Asian women, was met with condemnation by the IWA and its membership.\n\nThe IWA’s campaign against the degrading gynecological (‘virginity tests’) examinations conducted on immigrant women entering UK airports, is worthy of note in the way it dealt with such an uncomfortable and degrading issue. Claims that one such ‘test’ was used against a British-Indian woman entering Britain to be reunited with her fiancée in 1976 provoked outrage amongst the Asian community and sparked a campaign by the IWA demanding openness about the use of these tests (for the British government was first denying their use) and an end to the degrading practice. In coordinating this campaign, the IWA organised effectively, linking up groups in the UK and India to demand an end to this practice. IWA members made representations to the Indian government, which in turn took up the issue with the British government and the United Nations Human Rights commission. It is believed that around 80 women went through these degrading and sexist tests in the 1970s, before the British government stopped their use on immigrant women at airports in 1979. The case of the IWA’s campaign against ‘Virginity Tests’ highlights another strength of its character and network: the cooperation between various UK-based and international groups. As a group predominantly made up of immigrants, with contacts ‘back home’ and a presence in their new home, the IWA combined forces with foreign groups and bodies to create supranational campaigns.\n\nThe gradual decline of the IWA began towards the end of the 20th century, as the landscape of British politics and society changed. The deindustrialisation of the UK economy reduced the number of members, as many South Asians moved into self-employment or white-collar occupations. The membership of the Indian Workers Association was also increasingly absorbed into the more traditional political structures and groupings. A number of the key IWA members have, for example, stood for Labour in local elections or joined broader (and once somewhat discriminatory) national trade unions.\n\nHowever, the IWA remains active in a number of centres across Britain. The movement still remains oriented towards anti-racist and working class politics, campaigning on issues of social and racial justice and oppression. The social and pastoral work of the IWA continues to be a particularly strong and prominent strand of its work, as well as supporting workplace politics and labour organisation. The longevity of the IWA and its continuing relevance to the lives of its members and the South Asian community are testament to the long journey it has been on and its continued place within British politics and radicalism today.\n\n(Feature image by Rathfelder, used under the Creative Commons License)\n\nSources/Further Reading\n\nBooks\n\n‘Sikhs in Britain: The Making of a Community, G.

OSCH is part of the wider Kick the Dust programme which tackles the under-representation of the young as audiences and participants in heritage spaces. If you are a regular reader of our blog, and follow us on Twitter and on Instagram, you will follow all we’ve been doing since May 2019 to make heritage spaces more inclusive for young people.\n\nOne of our key aims is to provide as many paid opportunities as possible for young people to change the heritage sector. In Summer 2020, we hired three brilliant paid interns, and now in December 2020, we’ve hired three more young people who impressed us with their application and interview. The six young people are now working as dynamic and exciting team of changemakers.\n\nRead more about our Summer 2020 interns – here.\n\nWhat follows are the words of our latest interns – Hannah, Samihah and Rissat – who kindly share with us a little about themselves, their passion for exploring cultural heritage and their plans as interns:\n\nHannah Rustomjee\n\nHannah Rustomjee: “When I applied for this position I was asked what heritage and community meant to me. I found this incredibly hard to answer as I’ve always struggled to talk about my own identity. Getting involved with South Asian Heritage at the Manchester Museum has made me reckon with my own complex heritage, as an individual with South African-Indian, Parsi and Spanish roots. I think my experience of being unable to tick a box has shaped my interest for representation, belonging, identity and heritage; and I am hoping that this experience will teach me more about myself and my own South Asian heritage, whilst also giving me the opportunity to share and reflect on my experiences with like-minded others.\n\n2020 has seen the twin challenges of COVID-19 and the ongoing effects of the global movement for Black Lives, intensifying the conversation around Britain’s history of colonialism, and its after effects. This is a really important time for museums to acknowledge their responsibility and serve the diverse localities in which they are situated. Young people can have a big role in transforming the design and legacy of museums and I am grateful for the opportunity to be a part of this. Britain’s past weighs on our present, and learning about it would mean a better debate about race and migration.\n\nI urge all young people who are curious about the narrative being told in museums to join the Manchester Our Shared Cultural Heritage Project, which gives young people the chance to come together to explore the shared cultural heritage of the UK and South Asia and to develop new methods for museums to engage with people.”\n\nSamihah Mudabbir\n\nSamihah Mudabbir: “Studying History and Sociology has intrigued my interest in learning about my historical roots and their effects on the socio-political the climate of today. However, I guess it was both my love and hate for these two subjects which pushed me further into exploring my identity. My hate stemmed from the curriculum’s erasure of South Asian culture, heritage, and its histories and the repetitive narratives we were taught. Moreover, my frustration for these subjects had progressed due to many teachers constantly promoting their ideas of ‘Britishness’ through their actions and teachings.\n\nHowever, these subjects have allowed me to always be critical and have pushed me further to explore the unwritten tales which constantly affects the lives of South Asians. Therefore, my new role as a Community Storyteller is a remarkable experience and one which allows me to have an integral role in sharing diverse histories and advocating for change. I am looking forward to promoting stories of the South Asian community – however big or small the stories may seem to be.\n\nMy involvement already with the OSCH Young People’s Collective has allowed me to explore my identity and history. I’ve took part in many activities including conducting webinars on Mughal History and working on the new South Asia gallery, where I am specifically exploring the colonial legacy of climate change and Bangladesh’s resistance. Working and learning with OSCH has erased many of my frustrations when learning the histories of South Asia. And whilst it is important to remain critical of the power that continues to dominate in museum spaces, I find it integral to be a part of the change and resistance that OSCH brings – as a collective constantly challenging the way in which museums operate.\n\nWhilst we have all experienced the distresses of lockdown and the lack of real-life interaction, the projects that this role entails combined with the work of OSCH has and will allow many people, including myself to reflect and gain the confidence to share their stories online. This role is encouraging me to discover innovative ways to engage young people in sharing their stories that hold historical and cultural purpose. It’s a massive opportunity to showcase voices of the underrepresented, to culturally inspire my generation, and to fight for change”.\n\nRissat Hasan\n\nRissat Hasan: “Growing up in a predominantly White town and attending a predominantly White school often made me feel estranged from the ‘Bangladeshi’ part of my ‘British-Bangladeshi’ identity. My heritage has always been deeply rooted in my mother tongue ‘Bengali’, a language fought for by my ancestors and subsequently preserved by the nation’s independence through the Bangladesh Liberation War. Yet the ‘British’ side of my heritage exposed the broken Bengali that often slips from my tongue. It grouped me alongside my South-Asian counterparts due to my classmates and teachers throughout school being unable to differentiate between a young person as being ‘Pakistani’, being ‘Indian’ and being ‘Bangladeshi’. Aside from knowing the language, could I even differentiate myself? Those who did ask about my origins, often did not know what/where Bangladesh was, let alone able to find it on a map.\n\nAfter sixteen years of studying, my final years of education at university presented an opportunity whereby the roots of my own history and identity could be researched and written about. Whilst I was elated to be learning about the women of the Liberation War and guided by an academic advisor who was also of a South-Asian heritage, I often found myself questioning why it took so long for me to feel represented. Studying History at university became an act of cherishing the excerpts of decolonised curriculum available, yet still feeling a sense of imposter syndrome in a class tailored to me and about me. As one of the very few PoC on my course, my existence became a means of disrupting hegemonic, Eurocentric narratives and taking up predominantly white spaces, as well as sharing the histories of the lesser known and those not represented at all.\n\nTherefore, my motivations for working at Manchester Museum as a ‘Community Storyteller’ has granted me the opportunity to continue sharing the experiences of those from marginalised communities, understand why they are often misrepresented and be part of the solution. It is realising that (in actor Riz Ahmed’s words) being an ‘outsider’, caught between two or more things, such as my “British” and “Bangladeshi” heritage, is not necessarily bad. For being an outsider in an environment where belonging seems like a distant prospect is where the most impact can be made. Environments such as museums and schools where “British” heritage is often emulated can transform the ‘outsider’ into an ‘insider’ by interrogating existing narratives which often serve to undermine the influence of South-Asian communities”.\n\nGreat things to come…\n\nFollow us on our social media channels to keep up to date with the exciting activities and campaigns that all six of our young interns are cooking up for you!
