        "text": "Actors are like the ocean. They hold secrets within. The secrets they hold are the secrets that shape their personality. There is tragedy, there is romance, there is heartbreak, there is validity. VickyKaushal is an ocean of expressions in an arid landscape. He will show you the truth on screen. Remember the heart-breaking scene in Masaan, where he mourns the loss of his fiancée and asks why doesn’t this pain get lesser. You can’t help but be moved by him.\n\nThat’s because he harnesses his ocean of secrets into the scene. The same ocean spills out in waves when he realises his wife’s betrayal in Raazi. It’s the same ocean of secrets which comes spilling out in Lust stories. He’s your everyman and it takes goddamn guts to do what he does.\n\nHis outings in Uri also show him taking the way of valour without obviously falling prey to machismo. He does it subtly but effectively. That’s because he knows the secret. The same secrets he carries with him in the role of Udham Singh. Seething with the horror and violence unleashed in the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, Udham Singh worked studiously plotting the assassination of General O’Dwyer, the man who had ruthlessly ordered the killings twenty years before. As Udham Singh became the most celebrated film of the year, editor Jitesh Pillai parlays with VickyKaushal to find out what made Udham Singh tick and how does he navigate the deep ocean and secrets within.\n\nWhether it’s Raazi, Sardar Udham or even Sanju - you’ve consciously or unconsciously chosen to work in biopics. You also have Sam Bahadur after this...\n\nTo be honest, it just got aligned with the directors I’ve dreamt of working with. Be it Meghna (Gulzar), Raju Sir (Rajkumar Hirani) or Shoojit Sir (Sircar), I’d been dreaming of working with them. What was more special was that with them I got to play parts that were really appealing to me. With Sardar Udham, it’s the first time I’m getting to play a freedom fighter and be a part of the world which was our freedom struggle. All the things you’ve studied in history books and got fascinated by... Being a Punjabi, I’ve grown up listening to stories about Jallianwala Bagh and this somehow felt close to home and heart. Like I said, working with Shoojit sir was like a dream for me.\n\nTake us inside the world of Udham Singh.\n\nSardar Udham Singh was born in 1899 and when the Jallianwala Bagh massacre happened in 1919, he was merely twenty years old. He’d lost his parents early on and was in an orphanage. A twenty year old kid experiences a massacre and things inside him change. More than a thousand people were killed - elders, children, housewives, men, women, everyone. Hundreds of bodies were discovered just from the well and more than thousand were injured. So on that day, something changed inside Udham Singh. The brief I got from Shoojit da was that we need to explore the state of mind of the character at any given point of time. This is not the kind of biopic where you have to crack how he walked, talked or what his behaviour was. This is not a biopic of a person, it’s the biopic of an ideology. It’s about what he started believing in and what he started aspiring the country to be. The kind of friends he made, like Bhagat Singh, the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA). He was travelling the world to get support for the Indian freedom movement, be it in Russia or America. He wanted to be in the heart of the British empire to shake it from within so that the world took notice of the injustice that was happening in India. So he remained under the radar, kept a low profile, changed identities, names..and all he gets is one paragraph or maximum a page in our history books. Shoojit da is emotionally involved in this story. It’s amazing how much he’s studied about this topic.\n\nI call him the encyclopaedia of the Indian Freedom Movement. He knows so much about it, I don’t think there’s a better person to tell this story.\n\nDo you believe violence is the answer?\n\nIf you start seeing it as violence, then you also have to see where he came from. For a person who has experienced the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, murder is not an act against a person, it’s an act against the ideology of imperialism and colonialism. He wanted to make a statement against that. He wasn’t angry with the British and he didn’t count each of them as his enemy. It was the people who represented imperialism and colonialism. He considered them to be evil and he was fighting against that. It was a thought against a thought, an ideology against an ideology.\n\nHow did you sketch the graph of Sardar Udham Singh?\n\nI kept questioning things like why was he this person in 1933 and this other person in 1937. He’s a person who has acted as a background artiste in British films when he was in London. There is a film called The Elephant Man where he is the background artiste. He sold lingerie, worked in a factory, he was hustling throughout for survival and at the same time, he was a part of HSRA. He was trying to team up with people all across the globe to help people in India in their struggle. It’s just bizarre. It feels like he was five people at the same time. So I was just trying to crack that and then I was told that he was a jovial person. I was like where in all this is there a scope to bring out his joviality now?\n\nHe was a Punjabi who would be living in the moment and was popular with the ladies over there. I blindly surrendered myself to Shoojit da and worked on internalising the emotion\n\nI was trying to portray.\n\nPatriotic films are often in the danger of turning jingoistic. How do you find the balance?\n\nFor me, my Quran, my Gita, my Bible is always the script and the person guiding me through this storytelling is my director. Regarding jingoism, Shoojit da is very sensitive to the characters and the story they’re portraying. One of the briefs that I had for playing Sardar Udham Singh was that we want to treat him like he’s one of us. We wanted to believe that there is a revolutionary in each one of us. He was just another kid, another guy who had this passion inside him and that’s how he became a revolutionary.\n\nWe’ve heard that he had a journal in which he wrote about General O’Dwyer and he would spell it as Dyer…\n\nHe had a diary where he used to write in English and then he used to write in Hindi and Urdu as well. So his spellings were different. What Shoojit da has followed is what people who were at the Jallianwala Bagh had said. There are many documents that were given to the Hunter Commission and there were other committees that Shoojit da is well aware of. So he’s referred to these documents.\n\nTake us through your physical transformation for the film…\n\nWhen the Jallianwala Bagh episode happened, he was twenty years old and he was forty when he assassinated O’Dwyer and was later hanged. I had to go from a twenty year old to a forty year old. I had to lose 14kgs for the younger portions and I had to gain all that weight back in a month’s time because we were shooting the portions where he is 35 to 40. Strangely, gaining for me is a difficult task. But honestly, this was a part in the film that\n\nI was least worried about.\n\nWhat was the routine like when you were trying to lose weight?\n\nCloser to the shoot, I was off salt and carbs completely. I was mostly on a liquid diet, black coffee and the only thing I did for the energy while shooting those parts was have biscuits with the coffee through the day. I also wanted to feel like I’m starving and I’m not satisfied with the food in my stomach. I wanted some kind of disturbance inside as well.\n\nYou do have some kind of resemblance to him...\n\nStrangely, he did have a fat nose like me and was clean shaven. (Laughs) He didn’t have a jawline, I also don’t have one and that’s why I keep a beard all the time. I didn’t know we had these small similarities but eventually it landed in the right place.\n\nIf you were to meet Udham Singh, what three questions would you ask him?\n\nWe have shot and shown the episode of Jallianwala Bagh to the best of our capabilities. But I would really want to know what he saw that day that changed him. We have really tried to showcase it to the world but I would like to know about what he actually went through. And of course, the stories of him working as a background artiste in a British film, or as a salesman or factory worker, driver, carpenter… I just want to know his journey. Like he was in America as a Brazilian citizen called Frank Brazil. You can go and shoot all that but to know of it from the horse’s mouth is another thing. I think I would have three thousand questions, not just three.\n\nTell me about his friendship with Bhagat Singh.\n\nAmol (Parashar) plays Bhagat Singh in the film and it’s amazing how much he resembles him. Udham Singh was five years elder to Bhagat Singh but he considered him his guru. That just gives you the first note on how they were together. Bhagat Singh was 23 years old when he was hanged. And was just 21 when he had orchestrated the blast at the assembly. He was so well read, he had read all possible books on world politics. So Udham who is five years elder to him, used to consider Bhagat Singh as his guru. A guru, a friend, a brother. Udham Singh, if I may say so, was a fanboy. After Bhagat Singh passed away, all he wanted to do was regroup HSRA and carry forward Bhagat Singh’s dream, his vision of a free India. That became his driving element. He had letters and pictures of Bhagat Singh that he’d carry along with him. You will get to see all this in the film as well. He was completely consumed by the ideology of what Bhagat Singh represented.\n\nWhat was the defining moment for you in the film, a moment you felt you’ve cracked the character?\n\nIt has to be the Jallianwala Bagh episode. We started the shoot with that and it helped me immensely because all through the film, in my head, I had visuals of what I went through as an actor while shooting for that and that helped me base my later reactions. When we were shooting for the later parts of his journey, all Shoojit da had to come and whisper in my ear was, “You remember that moment we shot there as a twenty year old? I want to see that in you now.” It would give me a reference point. That scene was the moment\n\nI got the gravity of being Sardar Udham Singh.\n\nDescribe your equation with Shoojit da.\n\nShoojit da is a man of very few words and when he’s jamming with you on a character, he doesn’t say a lot. I remember when we were travelling to Russia to shoot some parts, he gave me a track which was just sounds of nature and waves. I kept listening to it and it had a meditative effect on me. But I kept wondering why he gave me a track that calmed me down when I have to play a guy who is really turbulent from the inside. So I asked him on the flight and he said, “That’s the thing. When you find turbulence in a world that’s calming you down, that’s my Udham.” I realised I had to really dig in deep to find my turbulence in the calming atmosphere. That’s how he functions. He was directing me for a scene when I had to talk to a child. There were a few lines and he kept it open to improvisation. He told me to talk as if I were talking to my eight-year-old version. I’ve never been directed like that. It just blew me away. It just changed everything for me. He flows, he’s not very structured. He doesn’t have a textbook way of directing a film. It almost felt like I had gone back to my theatre days as an actor. It’s a very fluid way of executing a story.\n\nYou came into the industry without the chocolate boy looks. Do you think Ayushmann Khurrana, Rajkummar Rao and you have changed the parameters of what it means to be a Hindi film hero today?\n\nI think Ayushmann, Rajkummar or me, we were lucky with the people who directed us, who kind of brought a change in storytelling. At the same time, the audience was evolving and is evolving in a beautiful way. We are living in a time where if you do one scene in a film and it stands out, they will Google your name and they will want to know more about you. You will become a household name. We are living in a time when we can get opportunities that are mainstream. It does surprise me but I don’t want to question it or over-analyse it. I want to go with the flow and grow as an actor.\n\nHas there been an audition you flunked and later when you saw the film, you felt you could have done a better job?\n\nMany. I have probably succeeded at ten auditions but have failed at ten thousand of them. I’ll tell you about my first ever audition which scared the hell out of me because that night I could not sleep. It was the first audition I gave for a very small part in Bhaag Milkha Bhaag. Honey Trehan was the casting director and spent three hours with me just to get me to act. I was nervous, it was the first time I was facing the camera, first time I was going through the process of auditioning. I just couldn’t do it. That night I came home feeling so defeated and disheartened. I felt like I just don’t know this job. I decided that the next day\n\nI wake up, I’m either going to be a stubborn guy who will learn till he can prove it or\n\nI will continue to feel defeated and never do anything about it in life. I decided to go out there and learn, give as many auditions as it takes, join theatre, fail, fail and fail till you know succeed.\n\nWere there more heart-breaking auditions?\n\nI still remember there was an ad film audition for a deodorant and this is the time when all you had to do was spray it on your body and have girls falling all over you. You need a great physique and good looks. I went there with no physique and no looks. I knocked on the door and the casting director opened it. I asked him whether if I was fit for the audition and he didn’t say if I was fit, he said, “It’s an ad film for a deodorant,” and I had to understand that he meant no but I was stubborn. So I asked again and he told me to come in. So I went in and it was a small room with a hundred boys and every one was in great shape and good looking. I was sitting there like an under confident fellow and I was like, “I’m not getting this job, so let me just enjoy it and go for it.” So, I went and did all I could and performed. I obviously didn’t get it.\n\nYou’ve done a film like Lust Stories where the hero suffers from premature ejaculation. Ayushmann too has done something similar. Do you feel you’ve somewhere changed the narrative for heroes?\n\nAt the end of the day, we may be actors but we’re also an audience. I, as an audience, find characters that I relate to appealing. They are as flawed as I am or anybody whom\n\nI know. So there’s a charm in playing a character that is flawed in some sense.\n\nA hero isn’t somebody you can’t touch. A hero is someone who makes you believe that you have your flaws but you are still the hero in your story.\n\nCan you tell us the turning point which made you realise that acting was your calling?\n\nI have been active on stage since school. I genuinely connect to the joy performing gives me. It’s my dream to tell Shah Rukh sir that, maybe one day I’ll get to work with him. I had the opportunity to be on the set of Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi and there’s a scene where he’s fighting a sumo wrestler. So the shot was a close up where he wasn’t really picking up the wrestler but was just enacting it. I was looking at him in awe, as the way he performed gave me goosebumps. I was like a kid. And that day, that moment for me was so inspiring. As a scene, it was nothing unusual or dramatic but for the guy who was watching him, I felt like if someday I can make someone else feel what I felt that day, if someday I can be an actor and someone visits my set and watches me perform and he can feel this inspired and affected... that’s what\n\nI want to do. That became my inspiration to become an actor. I wanted to affect lives like I was affected that day. I’ve decided that the day I get to share a frame with him is when I will tell him this story.\n\nWas your father okay with your decision to be an actor?\n\nHe just wanted to be sure of my reason to be an actor. He was okay with me pursuing engineering and doing my post-grad in the US and then doing a job over there. He just wanted to make sure that my reasons to become an actor were genuine. He did not want me to be influenced by the glamour of the world. As a technician, he has seen a lot of hardships to just survive in this industry. To be doing this for thirty years, he knows it’s not a walk in the park. It’s not a secure job. You always have to keep thinking about what’s next.\n\nWhat’s the best piece of advice he’s given you?\n\nHe’s told me, “Beta, it’s okay if you’re an 8 or 10 as an actor but always try to be a 10 on 10 as a human being.”\n\nTell me about your equation with your brother Sunny. He’s had great reviews for Shiddat…\n\nWith Sunny, I strangely feel so many things all at the same time. He’s my friend on most occasions but when I get to see his work, I become a parent, a proud father.\n\nI remember whenever my film was released and I called my family for the screening, they used to be very proud on our way back home together. When I first saw him in Gold, I was going back with my mom and dad and I told them, “Today I understand what you feel because today I feel like a proud parent.” It’s just strange, I feel very protective about him and sometimes I also feel like I have a lot of respect for him for the rational person he is. He’s the most Zen guy in the family. Sometimes, my parents and I are all over the place and this guy, as the youngest member of the family, will come and talk so much sense. So I really depend on him a lot for my emotional clarity."
