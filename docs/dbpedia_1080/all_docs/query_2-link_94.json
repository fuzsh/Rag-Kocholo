        "text": "This music video is a tribute the revolutionary freedom fighter Udham Singh, portraying his journey from Amritsar to London where he killed Michael O’Dwyer, taking revenge for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.\n\nA music video honouring freedom fighter Udham Singh was released on 31st July, marking his 75th death anniversary. It is a way for Indian pop group, Ska Vengers, to pay tribute to the legend, who appears as a graphic novel hero in the video. The background score is the first single from Ska Vengers’ fifth album.\n\nIt portrays the journey of Udham Singh, when he was on a secret mission and had travelled to London to kill the then Lieutenant Governor of Punjab, Michael O’Dwyer, to avenge the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre of Amritsar. For this, he was executed in 1940.\n\nThe animated video takes viewers thorough his story with the help of graphic novel images.\n\nThe brave Udham Singh had no regrets. “For full 21 years, I have been trying to wreak vengeance. I am happy that I have done the job. I am not scared of death. I am dying for my country,” he had said during his court trial.\n\nThe video is around 4 minute long and has been made by Kunal Sen and Tisha Deb Pai. Stefan ‘Flexi’ Kaye, who is a band member, told The Indian Express that the music video is basically a murder ballad, like those found in many folk traditions across cultures.\n\n“I don’t care if I spend 99 years in jail, send me to electric chair,” says one of the lines in the song.\n\nThe album is called ‘Frank Brazil’, named after an alias which was used by Udham Singh, during his overseas undercover travel. Ska Vengers is known for making socially relevant and political music.\n\nWatch the video here:"
