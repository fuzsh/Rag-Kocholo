        "text": "Die Weiße Rose (“The White Rose”) was a coalition of university students in Germany during the Third Reich who opposed Hitler by independently writing, producing, and distributing leaflets throughout Germany which sought to expose the tyranny of the Nazi party in a country otherwise totally controlled by government-produced news and propaganda.\n\nThere was certainly no honour amongst thieves during the trial of Simon Mann who was sentenced to 34-years imprisonment for his part in the 2004 failed coup attempt to topple the government of Teodoro Obiang Nguema in Equatorial Guinea.\n\nPatrice Lumumba became the first democratically elected leader of the Republic of the Congo on June 23, 1960. He was a staunch anti-imperialist who believed in African self-determination and black pride. He was eventually overthrown and murdered in a coup supported and sponsored by the governments of the United States and Belgium.\n\n“Stand for change,” “Change you can believe in,” “Are you ready for change?” Change is clearly the message that the Barack Obama campaign team are trying to get across, and with the recent victory over Hilary Clinton it would appear that many voters are hearing the message loud and clear.\n\nAmilcar Cabral was a marxist revolutionary leader who fought against Portuguese colonial rule in Guinea-Bissau. He was assassinated in 1973. The following is an excerpt from his address delivered to the first Tricontinental Conference of the Peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America held in Havana in January, 1966.\n\nAfter the Labour Party’s worst local elections defeat in over four decades, I think it is safe to say that the people have spoken and the carcass of New Labour is now in the process of decay, marked by the appointment of Conservative Mayor Boris Johnson, lovable rogue and full-time stand-up comedian, who now holds the keys and financial reins to London.\n\nUdham Singh was charged with the murder of Sir Michael O'Dwyer, the former Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab who had approved of the action of Brigadier-General R.E.H. Dyer at Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar on April 13, 1919, an event which resulted in the massacre of hundreds of men, women and children and left over 1,000 wounded during the course of a peaceful political meeting.\n\nImprisonment has become the response of first resort to far too many of the social problems that burden people who are ensconced in poverty. These problems often are veiled by being conveniently grouped together under the category \"crime\" and by the automatic attribution of criminal behavior to people of color. Homelessness, unemployment, drug addiction, mental illness, and illiteracy are only a few of the problems that disappear from public view when the human beings contending with them are relegated to cages.\n\nFidel Castro has retired after forty-nine years as President and Commander-in-Chief of the larger-than-life revolutionary island of Cuba. After almost two years as acting President, Raul Castro was elected his successor and is now the custodian of the world’s most famous revolution.\n\nPeter Kropotkin was a Russian prince and a prominent Russian anarchist. Throughout his life, he advocated for a communalist society free from central government. He wrote many books, essays, and articles on the subject of anarchist communism and was known throughout Russia as “the Anarchist Prince.”\n\nThe following is an excerpt from his 1897 essay, “Anarchist Morality.” ...\n\nAfter leading Ghana to independence, Kwame Nkrumah served as the country’s first Prime Minister from 1952-1966. As one of the most influential Pan-Africanists of the twentieth century, Nkrumah was a member of the Organization of African Unity and spent his political career working tirelessly toward a united Africa.\n\nMichael Parenti is an American writer, lecturer, scholar, political scientist, and historian. His broad spectrum of work embodies the topics of American foreign policy, imperialism, economics, communism, fascism, socialism, religion, history, and politics, to name a few. He is a widely-known and well-respected lecturer at universities and conventions around the world. The following is an excerpt from his essay, “Imperialism 101.”\n\nThe Acholi people live in Northern Uganda where war between the Government and insurgent rebels has been on-going for over twenty years.\n\nToday the guns are silent and there is talk of a peace settlement. Millions of people who have been displaced are hopeful that their villages will be made safe to return to.\n\nUnder this umbrella of uncertainty Otim Odoge and Evelyn Aparo are getting married according to Acholi tradition.\n\nAfter serving forty-six years in the army, eight of which have been spent as a military dictator, General Pervez Musharraf has finally traded in his combat fatigues for what he hopes will be the fine-tailored suit of a legitimate Pakistani president.\n\nFrantz Fanon (1925-1961) was a revolutionary writer from the Caribbean island of Martinique. He joined revolutionary movements all over the world, including the resistence movement against the French in Algeria. He published accounts of the effects of torture imposed upon Algerians by the French in his book, The Wretched of the Earth, which was later censored by the French.\n\nAlthough most famously known for The Twilight Zone, Rod Serling was a writer ahead of his times. His social and political consciousness brought him to face a great deal of censorship throughout his career as a screen-writer during a time in American history where television and film were reserved strictly for escapist entertainment."
