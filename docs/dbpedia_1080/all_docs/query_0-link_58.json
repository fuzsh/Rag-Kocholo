        "text": "Great write up and a great imitation of BR saab. Had there been no Readers Write in the title and had I not read the byline, I wouldnâ€™t know the difference. This sounds like a great watch!\n\nThanks Madan! I tried hard to imitate:)\n\n@Satya I felt the length was justified because the movie had set up the slow burn premise effectively and it needed that explosion, in the end, to fully unleash the trauma. Given that most ongoing rewrite-the-history endeavors (in books, movies) are becoming rah-rah exercises, we have lost the ability to deal with the trauma of the past. We are carrying it, whether we like it or not, at a collective level. And so I thought it was a fantastic choice by the director to keep things muted all along, and hit you at your gut towards the end.\n\nMP, thanks for the write up.\n\nI echo your point 5. This is the first time I have seen a cinematic equivalent of JW Bagh massacre and I shook, I was numb, I cried.\n\nHow could fellow Indians kill fellow Indians like this. What were they thinking? How did they sleep after? Why did they not come back to help the victims? How did their lives transpire post this event? How did their family members feel about them? We need some movies to take us through these I feel.\n\nLooking forward to watching this. I tend to stay away from â€˜nationalisticâ€™ movies â€“ Shaheed (1965) still makes me feel more patriotic than the spate of jingoistic narratives masquerading as patriotism today. But the fact that Shoojit Sircar is associated with this makes me hopeful about it, and Iâ€™ve been hearing such good things about the film.\n\nThanks, Macaulay.\n\nNow that the video has killed the essay writer (save a few exhibition match appearances)\n\nSomething that I mourn deeply. ðŸ˜¦ The video reviews, because thatâ€™s the nature of the beast, do not have the same punch as his writing did.\n\nGiven that most ongoing rewrite-the-history endeavors (in books, movies) are becoming rah-rah exercises, we have lost the ability to deal with the trauma of the past.\n\nWhen we see Udham fulfilling his vow of revenge in like the first 40 minutes of the film, and after a long wait, where you can already understand what he went through, the Jallianwallah Bagh sequence appears. I donâ€™t say no for the grit and pain, but isnâ€™t this too extra for its own good? Udhamâ€™s resilience and the villainâ€™s speeches in Britain can already create a mental image of the massacre which IMHO is far more scary than what unfolds.\n\nUnlike the interrogation scenes in Visaranai which unfold with a matter-of-fact calmness (thereby making us uneasy), this was a 20 minute long punishing sequence with a gaze that forces you to look and feel again the same thing. Having said that, I also have this thought that the writer-director wanted to explain things to the audience the way Nolan does by taking their intellect for granted.\n\n@hari Yes, This continues to confound me. At one level, whether it was Michael Oâ€™Dwyer or Reginald Dyer. They were decision-makers. But who fired those rounds? It was us.\n\n@Anu Warrier. Yes, I too deeply mourn. The movie is a fantastic watch, and, when I look at a news item like this, it reinforces the point I mentioned above in the post. https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/why-was-koozhangal-chosen-as-indias-oscar-entry/articleshow/87228798.cms?from=mdr\n\n@Satya Perhaps, youâ€™re right. I didnâ€™t feel the sequence to be gratuitous. For someone like me, who didnâ€™t see cinematic depictions of Jalianwalabagh massacre until Rang De Basanti came out, I thought this was important to show the scale at which this was orchestrated. I havenâ€™t seen movies which showed this in the 70s and 80s. In Rang De Basanti, he had shot it in a pointillistic manner. But here, we get the full picture, of course with the directorâ€™s own subjectivities. I felt this was done to show the scale more than anything else.\n\n@Anu To me, this shows how poorly we understand the forces that have shaped our history. But, yes, today colonialism has become the favourite strawman, poorly understood though. We talk of colonialism, we think of Africa. We donâ€™t think about ourselves."
