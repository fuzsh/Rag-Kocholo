        "text": "In her new book The Patient Assassin, long-time BBC journalist Anita Anand uses the Amritsar Massacre as the backdrop to tell the fascinating story of Udham Singh, a low-caste Punjabi orphan who spent the next 21 years planning to avenge those who were killed at Amritsar by assassinating British officials he believed were responsible for the massacre.\n\nOn March 13, 1940, at a meeting of the East India Association at Caxton Hall in London, Udham Singh murdered Sir Michael O’Dwyer, who was Lieutenant Governor of the Punjab at the time of the massacre and who endorsed and defended the British action. Three other British officials were wounded in the attack.\n\n“The moment [Singh] pulled the trigger,” Anand writes, “he became the most hated man in Britain, a hero to his countrymen in India and a pawn in international politics.”\n\nAnand views Singh as neither saint nor villain. Radicalised by the massacre and other manifestations of British repression and resistance to Indian national aspirations, he was also used by militant Indian nationalists, the Comintern, and later the Nazis in efforts to weaken and undermine British imperial rule.\n\nThe author has personal roots in this story. Her grandfather, a teenager at the time, was in Amritsar on the day of the massacre; he left Jallianwala Bagh shortly before British forces arrived, and he lost friends in the attack. Her husband’s family was from Punjab, and one of his relatives briefly lived with Singh. Her perspective is very much an Indian one – that doesn’t make it wrong, just incomplete. The British perspective is not entirely missing from her book, but it is given relatively short shrift.\n\nBritain ruled its empire ruthlessly when necessary, and Britain’s political and military officials in India understood their tenuous hold on power. Anand describes the British attitude as “act early, act decisively, show strength, or risk being swept away” at the first sign of rebellion.\n\nThe Indian Mutiny of 1857 provided a lesson in this regard. There, a mutiny by sepoys (Indian soldiers serving in the British army) in Calcutta quickly spread throughout northern India. “Rebels rampaged across the region,” Anand notes, “and a minority committed unspeakable atrocities against British civilians,” including the slaughter of more than 200 British women and children at Bibighar. The British government exacted terrible retribution by executing nearly 100,000 sepoys, including many who were innocent.\n\nIn 1919, British officials did not want a repeat of the sepoy mutiny. To them, Gandhi’s non-violent movement for home rule was being hijacked by Indian radicals.\n\nTwo weeks before the massacre, anarchy reigned in Delhi. Soon after riots broke out across the Punjab. Three days before the massacre, after British police arrested Gandhi and two other anti-colonial leaders, mobs in Amritsar terrorised some Europeans and were not stopped by native police. The mob murdered five men, burning three of their corpses in the street, and brutally beat an elderly female missionary and left her for dead.\n\nOn the morning of April 13, General Dyer banned public meetings and warned that any assemblies would be dispersed by force. His warnings were ignored as 15,000 to 20,000 people – many carrying metal-tipped sticks – gathered at Jallianwala Bagh.\n\nTo British eyes, Dyer’s actions that day may have prevented a much more widespread rebellion which would have resulted in countless more lives lost. The British action brought calm to the Punjab within a few days, and some Indian shopkeepers and merchants praised Dyer for preventing looting and more destruction. The guardians of the nearby Golden Temple made Dyer an honorary Sikh.\n\nIt is not the facts that divide Anand’s and some British viewpoints; it is their differing perspectives.\n\nGeneral Dyer was disciplined and lost his command after a British-led commission found fault with his actions. To Indians he was “the Butcher of Amritsar”. To many Britons at the time, he was a sacrificial lamb in an effort to appease the people of India and preserve British rule there. He died a broken man in July 1927.\n\nOPTIONAL CUT STARTS\n\nWhat is not in doubt is that the Amritsar Massacre further fuelled the fire of Indian nationalism and anti-British sentiment. It did not help matters any that in the years preceding the massacre tens of thousands of Indian troops had bravely served the Empire in World War I. Was the massacre at Amritsar how the British showed their gratitude?\n\nIn the next 20 years, Singh, often using aliases, travelled to Africa, to the European continent, to America, and to England in an effort “to become the avenging angel for his people”. He was frequently on the radar screen of various British intelligence services because of his associations with Indian radicals and Russian communists.\n\nSingh’s patience finally paid off on March 13, 1940. After he killed Sir Michael O’Dwyer, he confessed to the crime and his motives – the Amritsar Massacre and Indian independence. His trial lasted two days. He was found guilty and condemned to death. He was hanged at London’s Pentonville prison on July 31, 1940. British authorities portrayed him as a lone-wolf terrorist, without political connections or motivations. There was a war to win and, hopefully, an empire to be preserved.\n\nBritain won the war but did not preserve the empire. Indian independence was achieved, but not peacefully. Anand notes that liberation from British rule came at a terrible price – 15 million people displaced and two million dead. She mostly blames the British for this.\n\nAnand concludes by noting that in 2017, a statue of Udham Singh was placed at the sight of the massacre. “It depicts him,” she writes, “standing with his arm outstretched, palm up, holding a clod of blood-soaked earth in his hand. A reminder of a promise which took 20 years to fulfil.”\n\nAsian Review of Books\n\nThis article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: DEAD SET ON REVENGE – EVEN IF it TOOK 21 YEARS"
