I have an example for you guys.\n\nIn the 70s there was a movement to bring back Udham Singh's ashes, Indira Gandhi and the Congress quickly latched on so they could be associated with it and when his ashes came back to India they went with it to his house in Sunam and eventually to Haridwar where his ashes were immersed in the Ganges.

It's great to check out your family history and realize that they have been coming to the same place since the mid 1800's.."
