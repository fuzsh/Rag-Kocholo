        "text": "This was the date in 1984 of the Hondh-Chillar massacre\n\nIt was one of the many atrocities of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots that ensued the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards.\n\nHondh today sits in ruins. Prior to November 2, 1984, it was a tiny dhani — basically a hamlet — outside a still-extant village known as Chillar in the northern state of Haryana.\n\nOn that dread day, a couple of hundred toughs trucked in by the Congress Party arrived at the dhani and set about sacking the settlement and brutalizing the Sikh inhabitants; at least 31 were beaten or burned to death over the course of several hours.\n\nSurviving villagers eventually rallied to drive off the mob and escaped that night from their devastated homes.\n\nLike other anti-Sikh vigilantism this horror has never been published, and allowed to languish into forgetfulness, as was the physical village itself. The place flashed in the news in 2011 when an engineer in nearby Gurgaon learned about the event accidentally and visited the site’s ruins, later posting heartbreaking photos to social media. That brought calls for reopening case files and preserving the site, none of which occurred; the engineer was forced out of his job a few weeks later, however.\n\nOn this day..\n\n1675: Boyarina Morozova, Old Believer\n\n1907: Afanasi Matushenko\n\n1715: Seven at Tyburn\n\n1803: Ludovicus Baekelandt, Vrijbos bandit\n\n1483: Henry Stafford, Duke of Buckingham\n\n82 BCE: The defeated populares of the Battle of the Colline Gate\n\n1984: Velma Barfield, the first woman in the modern era\n\n1801: James Legg, crucified ecorche\n\n1972: Evelyn Anderson and Beatrice Kosin, missionaries\n\n1920: James Daly, Connaught Rangers mutineer\n\n1924: Ali Reshti and Sayyid Husain, to placate America\n\n2001: Mona Fandey, witch doctor\n\n1963: Ngo Dinh Diem\n\nTwo Sikh militants of the Khalistan Commando Force were hanged on this date in 1992 at Pune for assassinating the India army chief who conducted Operation Blue Star.\n\nThis operation in 1984 aimed to corral the Sikh independence movement that proposed to carve out a state called Khalistan in Punjab — specifically by capturing (or as happened in the event, killing) the Sikh leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. In a notable pre-Blue Star outrage, Bhindanwale had a top policeman murdered, and his body remained on the steps of the Golden Temple for hours because other Punjab police were afraid to remove it until Bhindranwale consented.\n\nIn the first week of June 1984 the Indian army besieged Bhindranwale, and supporters, in that same temple, eventually assaulting the premises despite a heavy civilian presence, hundreds of whom were killed in the resulting firefight. The Indian state emerged with a firmer hold on regional sovereignty, and the renewed enmity of a lot of aggrieved Sikhs.\n\nIt was these outrages that led to Indira Gandhi’s assassination* later in 1984 … and at slightly greater remove, it led to the murder of the Army Chief of Staff who had implemented the operation, General Arunkumar Shridhar Vaidya. Vaidya well knew that this role might be his own death warrant and took the risk in stride; “If a bullet is destined to get me,” he said, “it will come with my name written on it.”\n\nThat bullet arrived in August 1986, a few months after Vaidya’s retirement when motorcycle gunmen assassinated the former chief of staff as he drove back from the Pune marketplace.\n\nSukhdev Singh Sukha and Harjinder Singh Jinda — both seasoned Khaistani assassins — got clean away at that moment, but Sukha was caught several weeks later when he got into a traffic accident riding the same black motorbike he’d used to ice the general. Both men admitted their involvement but pleaded not guilty, arguing that Vaidya had incurred the “death sentence” that they executed.\n\nThey were hanged together at Yerwada Central Jail on the morning of October 9, 1992 amid Sikh protests throughout Punjab. They’re often honored by protests and Sikh nationalist events on this anniversary of their execution.\n\n* Indira Gandhi’s killing triggered anti-Sikh pogroms in India with somewhere around 3,000 killed, which was in turn answered by Sikh extremists bombing an Air India flight in 1985.\n\nOn this day..\n\n1732: Edward Dalton, brotherly hate\n\n1685: Rebecca Fowler, Chesapeake witch\n\n1601: Nikolaus Krell, Saxon chancellor and Crypto-Calvinist\n\n1646: The effigy of Jean de Mourgues\n\n1938: Ivan Stepanovich Razukhin\n\n1796: Thirty Jacobins for the Affaire du camp de Grenelle\n\n1968: Pierre Mulele, hoodwinked\n\n1569: Vladimir of Staritsa, royal cousin\n\nFeast Day of Saint Denis, cephalophore\n\n1401: Llywelyn ap Gruffydd Fychan, an army marching on his stomach\n\n2002: Aileen Wuornos, Monster\n\n1967: Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara\n\nLate (and seemingly past midnight) the night of August 6-7 of 2001, two teenage* lovers named Vishal Sharma and Sonu were hanged in the Uttar Pradesh village of Alinagar ka Majra, for loving across the caste line.\n\nLate on Monday night [Monday, August 6, 2001 -ed.] the week before last, a neighbour caught the pair together as they chatted on the roadside next to a bush. She accused them of having “suspicious intentions” and dragged them into her shed. And then she summoned their families. It was not that the teenagers had been caught in flagrante — they were not even holding hands. Their crime was far more primal and ancient: they were from different castes. Under India’s enduring system of social stratification, a relationship between the pair was unthinkable.\n\nVishal was an upper-caste Brahmin; Sonu was a lower-caste Jat. Though it was not generally known, Sonu had recently been expelled from school for skipping lessons and, it seems, being galat — the Hindi word for immoral.\n\nThe girl’s parents, Surender and Munesh, decided there was only one way to escape the terrible social humiliation their daughter had heaped upon them — they would kill her. And so, aided by three neighbours, they proceeded to strangle her in the dark shed, with its abandoned bicycle and mattresses, in front of her terrified boyfriend.\n\n“The boy’s mother told them: ‘Don’t do this.’ The girl’s parents then scolded her, so the boy’s mother went and stood outside,” says local police officer Raispal Singh. “After that, they got a rope. They made a noose out of it and hanged the girl. They then told the boy’s mother and brother and sister-in-law: ‘Now you kill the boy.’ They replied: ‘We can’t kill him. You only kill him.’ At this, the girl’s parents hanged the boy.”\n\nAfterwards, both Vishal and Sonu were burned on an impromptu pyre fired by balls of dung.\n\n“Honor killings”, the extrajudicial slaying of kin for bringing shame on the family — often, as here, tied to caste-breaching illicit concupiscence** — remain a going concern in India, particularly the north. The official annual count of such instances runs to dozens per annum, with an unimaginable 251 in 2015 … yet activists think there are many more that go unreported.\n\n* Seemingly every story situates their ages slightly differently in that older teen/young adult spectrum. The youngest ages I’ve seen reported for the pair were 15 and 16 — the oldest, 18 and 19.\n\n** In other cases, consensual relationships that are opposed by a woman’s family are sometimes reported as “rape”.\n\nOn this day..\n\n1661: Jin Shengtan, literary scholar\n\n1849: Celigny Ardouin, Haitian Minister of the Interior\n\n1849: Ernst Elsenhans, Rastatt revolutionary\n\n1844: William Saville, brutalising scene\n\n1933: The Simele Massacre of Iraq's Assyrians begins\n\n2009: Li Peiying, corrupt aviation kingpin\n\n1864: Li Xiucheng, Taiping Rebellion general\n\n1896: Charles Thiede, the first since Utah statehood\n\n1930: Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith, strange fruit\n\n1936: The Sacred Heart, by Spanish leftists\n\n1859: Ormond Chase, casus belli not quite\n\n1777: A British spy, by Israel Putnam\n\nOn this date in 1915, Indian revolutionary Pandit Kanshi Ram was hanged by the British.\n\nPresent on the U.S. west coast for the founding of the heavily Sikh revolutionary Ghadar Party, Ram repatriated to participate in that clique’s eponymous Ghadar Mutiny.\n\nThis attempt to incite rebellion in the Raj was heavily surveilled, and crushed at the outset. The result was a series of trials bringing 20+ executions in 1915 known as the Lahore Conspiracy trials. (It’s not to be confused with the Delhi-Lahore Conspiracy.) “The British as a nation, all white men as a race and the English Government in particular, are all maligned in a spirit born of a depraved nature,” fumed the first court, the one that condemned Pandit Kanshi Ram. “Facts are not only distorted but most maliciously perverted to appeal to the lowest passions of Indian subjects. In the most open, defiant and unmasked manner mutiny is preached. “\n\nOn this day..\n\n1940: The Sass Brothers, Weimar burglars\n\n1728: Five at Tyburn\n\n1634: John Bartendale survives hanging and burial\n\n1894: Walter Smith\n\n1889: Mark Francis and James Turney\n\n1878: The Brassell boys\n\n1811: Adam Lyal, highwayman\n\n1947: Hisakazu Tanaka, Hong Kong occupier\n\n1677: Giles Bland\n\n2009: Two thieves in Riyadh\n\n1836: Goliad Massacre\n\n2001: Robert Lee Massie, who spent a lifetime dying\n\nAkshay Thakur, 31, Pawan Gupta, 25, Vinay Sharma, 26, and Mukesh Singh, 32, were hanged at Delhi’s Tihar Jail today — four of the six* widely hated perpetrators of in infamous 2012 gang rape.\n\nOn December 16, 2012, a 23-year-old physiotherapy student and call center worker named Jyoti Singh was returning from the cinema with a male friend on a private bus in a South Delhi neighborhood when the five other passengers plus the driver sealed the doors and assaulted them. After the man was knocked out with an iron rod, the five passengers turned on Singh and horrifically gang-raped her while the driver continued to steer the bus, even using a wheel jack to sodomize the struggling woman. By the time it was finished, and both victims tossed out of the moving vehicle, she’d suffered “massive damage to her genitals, uterus and intestines.” (Per medical examiners.) She succumbed several days later after desperate surgeries, but she lived long enough to identify her attackers, who were being arrested by the very next day. (Her male friend, Avanindra Pandey, survived the attack with broken ribs.)\n\nThe victim became publicly known as “Nirbhaya”, meaning “fearless”, owing to laws against doxxing sex crime victims, but her parents revealed her identity in the media in 2015. “We want the world to know her real name,” her father told British media. “My daughter didn’t do anything wrong, she died while protecting herself. I am proud of her. Revealing her name will give courage to other women who have survived these attacks. They will find strength from my daughter.”\n\nInstantly iconic, the case gestated huge public protests against endemic sexual violence, and allegedly contributed to a massive decline in tourism by women costing India billions of dollars. The prosecutions were naturally fast-tracked by a judiciary under intense public pressure, and Delhi police handed down internal punishments to officers for failing to prevent the crime when it emerged that the crime-van had been used to rob another passenger earlier that same night. The seven-year span from crime to execution is relative lightning speed for a country which in recent times has only rarely enforced death sentences. But comparative timetables were of no comfort to Nirbhaya’s parents, who have been publicly implacable on the matter of punishment throughout.\n\n“We all have waited so long for this day,” her mother said upon news of the men’s execution. “Today is a new dawn for daughters of India. The beasts have been hanged.”\n\nThis case has been the subject of considerable international commentary, most controversially a BBC documentary titled India’s Daughter (often available on YouTube despite its copyright) which includes interview footage with one of the now-hanged defendants attributing the attack to Jyoti Singh’s “indecency”. The film is still banned in India as of this writing.\n\n* Besides the four executed, a fifth man, the driver Ram Singh, was found hanged in pretrial detention — either suicide or murder — and a sixth was underage. The latter has long been released from his juvenile sentence; he’s reportedly working as a cook, ostracized by his family.\n\nOn this day..\n\n1738: Nicolas Doxat de Demoret\n\n1549: Thomas Seymour, more wit than judgment\n\n1954: Ernst Jennrich, for 17 June 1953\n\n1916: Abraham Bevistein, child soldier\n\n1531: Sikke Freriks, Menno Simons inspiration\n\n1899: Martha Place, the first woman electrocuted\n\n2007: Taha Yasin Ramadan, Iraqi Vice-President\n\n1428: Matteuccia di Francesco, San Bernardino casualty\n\n1393: John of Nepomuk, Bohemian rhapsody\n\n1897: Scott Jackson and Alonzo Walling, Pearl Bryan's murderers\n\n1809: Mary Bateman, the Yorkshire Witch\n\n1933: Giuseppe Zangara, who is not on Sons of Italy posters\n\nOn this date in 1915, Mewa Singh Lopoke was hanged in British Columbia, Canada.\n\nHe was part of a massive influx of Punjabi migrants to Canada, and particularly its westernmost province of British Columbia, from around 1904 until Canada clamped down on immigration from the subcontinent in 1908.*\n\nThere Mewa Singh became involved in activism for the Ghadar Party — the North American expatriate movement for Indian independence. This movement was heavily infiltrated by spies and informants, some of whom ratted Mewa Singh out after he attempted to deliver some firearms to Punjabi passengers stranded on the Komagata Maru in Vancouver’s harbor and slated for return to the subcontinent.**\n\nIn an atmosphere of rising tension within the Vancouver Sikh community, a police informant named Bela Singh, driven to desperation by the pressure of his handlers and fear of exposure, opened fire on his coreligionists inside a Sikh temple. In the resulting trial, B.C. immigration inspector William C. Hopkinson — the man who ran the spies within the Sikh community — was scheduled to testify on the gunman’s behalf. Instead, Mewa Singh shot him dead in the hallway outside the courtroom, them immediately surrendered his pistol and calmly submitted to arrest. As he entered a guilty plea and took full responsibility for the murder, his trial came in under two hours.\n\n“These people have disgraced us,” Mewa Singh said in his confession, accusing Hopkinson of exploiting vulnerable Sikhs to mine them for information and bribes.\n\nWe are poor, only coolie men, and whatever Hopkinson said was law. The Government listened to him completely.\n\nEveryone knows that Hopkinson did these underhand things and it must be brought to light. The European public must be aware of the fact that Hopkinson draws money from us poor native men. In the Vancouver public there are a few that are Christian men who have received us with the proper spirit. The other have treated us like dogs.\n\nHe hanged at 7:45 a.m. at New Westminster jail. To this day he remains a martyr to many within his community; there have been campaigns for a posthumous pardon on grounds that his assassin’s turn was strictly the result of the injustice Sikhs faced in Vancouver.\n\nFunerary procession for Mewa Singh.\n\nBy the time of Mewa Singh’s execution, World War I was well underway and Ghadrites, sensing their chance to break free from British domination, were working on orchestrating a mutiny in India. Thanks in no small part to the many spies keeping tabs on the Ghadrites, that mutiny was strangled in its crib.\n\n* As a longer-range effect of this migration period, Canada today has a reputation as “Little Punjab” and its substantial Sikh minority is a significant political bloc — especially in B.C.\n\n** This incident, in which 352 Punjabis were refused entry into Canada and forced to return to India — where Raj police arrested a number of the leaders as subversives, triggering a riot that took 20 lives — is still notorious in Canada today. “Not to be confused with Kobayashi Maru,” Wikipedia observes, sagely.\n\nOn this day..\n\n1800: Kyra Frosini, Ioannina socialite\n\n1769: John Martin Andrew, John Fielding prey\n\n2017: Christopher Wilkins, straight talker\n\n1957: Jack Gilbert Graham, terror of the skies\n\n1830: William Banks, housebreaker\n\n1909: The Pollet gang, breaking the French moratorium\n\n1951: Harley LaMarr, dutiful son\n\n1801: Chevalier, bomb plot scapegoat\n\n2010: Salah ibn Rihaidan ibn Hailan Al-Johani, Medina serial rapist\n\n1897: The Thirteen Martyrs of Bagumbayan\n\n2003: Nobody in Illinois\n\n1944: Galeazzo Ciano and four other Italian Fascists\n\nOn this date in 1929, the Punjabi Muslim youth Ilm Deen was hanged for murdering a blasphemous publisher.\n\nThe Rangila Rasul is a pamphlet-length send-up satirizing the “widely experienced”, chortle chortle, Prophet Muhammad for his many wives; Muslim fury at its publication brought the Raj to legislate against “outraging the religious feelings of any class” — a law that’s still on the books in India.\n\nHowever, there was no such law at the time of the naughty screed’s publication, and as a result the Hindu publisher, Mahashe Rajpal of Lahore, was acquitted of any charge in 1929.\n\n‘Twas a temporary exoneration, for Ilm Deen (or Ilm-ud-din, or Ilmuddin), a 20-year-old carpenter, delivered his verdict extrajudicially by daggering Rajpal in the chest in a Lahore bazaar on April 6, 1929.\n\nThe assassin’s speedy trip to the Raj’s gallows thereafter only cinched his place as a sectarian, and later (for Pakistan) national, martyr; the poet Allama Iqbal exclaimed at the young man’s funeral that “this uneducated young man has surpassed us, the educated ones!” To this day, Ilm Deen’s solemn tomb is a place of pilgrimage and veneration.\n\nThe case remains a fraught precedent for latter-day sectarian tension, as well as a ready vein of propaganda as with Ghazi Ilam Din Shaheed, a 1978 film released under the Pakistani military government after overthrowing Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.\n\nOn this day..\n\nTriskaidekaphobia: Executed Today's 13th Annual Report\n\n1904: Wang Weiqin, by lingchi\n\nStriking Midnight: Executed Today's 12th Annual Report\n\nEleventh Hour: Executed Today's (cursory) 11th annual report\n\n1926: Anteo Zamboni, Mussolini near-assassin, lynched\n\nDecimated: Executed Today's Tenth Annual Report\n\n1860: Johannes Nathan, the last ordinary execution in the Netherlands\n\n1862: Thomas Sanders, rapist\n\nDeathed Up to the Nines: Executed Today's Ninth Annual Report\n\nThe Eight Pains: Executed Today's Eighth annual report\n\n1460: Tiburzio di Maso, Roman brigand\n\nSeven-Out: Executed Today's Seventh Annual Report\n\n1814: Private John McMillan, deserter\n\nSix Years Under: Executed Today's Sixth Annual Report\n\n1698: The last Streltsy executed in October\n\nExecuted Today's Fifth Annual Report: Hang Five\n\n1907: Evstolia Ragozinnikova\n\nExecuted Today's Fourth Annual Report: Wrung, Wan and Quartered\n\n1893: Bertha Zillmann, completely prostrate\n\nExecuted Today's Third Annual Report: Third Time Lucky\n\nVasudev Balwant Phadke died on hunger strike against his British captivity on this date in 1883.\n\nThe “father of armed rebellion” in India, Phadke radicalized while working as a clerk in Pune and arose as a prominent revolutionary in 1875 whipping up protests against the British for deposing the Maharaja of Baroda State and for the grinding agricultural crisis.\n\nHe took his sharp anti-colonial oratory on a then-novel barnstorming tour, and eventually formed the Ramosi Peasant Force — an armed peasant insurgency consisting of a few hundred souls.\n\nIts successes were more of the local and symbolic variety — most notably, he got control of the city of Pune for a few days — but they sufficed to draw a price on Phadke’s head which eventually found a seller. (Phadke had made contemptuous reply by issuing his own bounty on the Governor of Bombay, a purse that was not claimed.) Even after capture, he briefly escaped by tearing his cell door off his hinges.\n\nNeeding to defuse his power as a potential martyr, the British gave him a term of years rather than a death sentence, and they moved him to Aden, Yemen, to serve it. Phadke overruled the sentence and clinched his martyr’s crown by refusing food until he succumbed on February 17, 1883.\n\nThere’s an eponymous 2007 biopic celebrating this Indian national hero, clips of which can be found in the usual places.\n\nOn this day..\n\n1819: Pierre Charles Rodolphe Foulard, Henry-Clement Sanson's first execution\n\n1955: Three for the death of King Ananda of Thailand\n\n1719: Richard Worley, pirate\n\n1688: James Renwick, to end the Killing Time\n\n1526: Guillaume Jobert, Genevieve-blasphemer\n\n1815: Eight deserters by order of Andrew Jackson\n\n1938: Juan Soldado, patron saint of Mexico-US migrants\n\n1524: Not Jean de Poitiers, father of the mistress\n\n1944: Jean Cavailles, philosopher-mathematician\n\n1872: Gomburza\n\n1600: Giordano Bruno, freethought martyr\n\n2004: Cameron Willingham, for an accidental fire?\n\nA national revenge drama 21 years in the making culminated on the gallows of Pentonville Prison on this date in 1940.\n\nThe story of Udham Singh‘s hanging begins long before and far away in the British Raj.\n\nThere, a crowd of 20,000-25,000 protesting for independence in the restive Punjab city of Amritsar were wantonly fired upon by Raj authorities — an atrocity remembered as the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. British authorities acknowledged a staggering 379 dead; Indian accounts run much higher than that.\n\nThe massacre’s principal immediate author was the army commander Reginald Dyer, who fired on the crowd without warning and with so much premeditation as to bar exits from the Jallianwala Bagh garden for maximum bloodshed — his acknowledged intent “not to disperse the meeting but to punish the Indians for disobedience.” but Punjab Lieutenant Governor Michael O’Dwyer, for many years a noted rough hand in the suppression of national militancy on the subcontinent, had his back. “Your action correct,” read an O’Dwyer-to-Dyer telegram on the morrow of the bloodbath. “Lieutenant Governor approves.”\n\nBritish opinion was not quite so approving; indeed, many Britons were outraged and both Dyer and O’Dwyer ended up sacked. But as is usual for a horror perpetrated under the flag they also never faced any sort of punishment.\n\nUntil Udham Singh, avenger, entered the scene.\n\nA survivor of that horrific day — when he’d been dispatched from the orphanage that raised him to serve drinks to the protesters — Singh had unsurprisingly thrilled to the revolutionary cause. A Sikh by birth, the name he adopted, Ram Mohammed Singh Azad, gestures to his movement’s now-remote spirit of unity across sect and nation.\n\nCome 1934 Singh had made his way to London, where he worked as an engineer and quietly plotted revenge against O’Dwyer, pursuant to a vow he had taken many years before. (Dyer escaped justice in this world by dying in 1927.) And on March 13, 1940, he had it when the retired colonial hand addressed a joint meeting of the East India Association and the Royal Central Asian Society at Caxton Hall. As proceedings concluded, Singh produced a concealed pistol and fired six shots at the hated O’Dwyer, killing him on the spot.\n\nLike many (not all) of his countrymen, Singh gloried in his long-awaited triumph in the few weeks remaining him.\n\nI did it because I had a grudge against him. He deserved it. He was the real culprit. He wanted to crush the spirit of my people, so I have crushed him. For full 21 years, I have been trying to seek vengeance. I am happy that I have done the job. I am not scared of death. I am dying for my country. I have seen my people starving in India under the British rule. I have protested against this, it was my duty. What greater honour could be bestowed on me than death for the sake of my motherland?\n\nMany countrymen shared his exultation, even if those in respectable leadership positions had to disapprove of assassination. Nevertheless, a few years after the subcontinent’s Union Jacks came down for the last time, PakistanIndia independence leader-turned-president Jawaharlal Nehru publicly “salute[d] Shaheed-i-Azam Udham Singh with reverence who had kissed the noose so that we may be free.”\n\nOn this day..\n\n1909: Sheikh Fazlollah Noori, anti-constitutionalist martyr\n\n1849: Maximilian Dortu, republican martyr\n\n1934: Otto Planetta and Franz Holzweber, for the Juliputsch\n\n1767: Obadiah Greenage, colonial gangster\n\n1701: Esther Rodgers, repentant\n\n1868: Stefan Karadzha, Bulgarian national hero\n\n1812: Hölzerlips, Blood Court prey\n\n1722: Cartouche's brother, hanged by the armpits\n\n1602: Charles de Gontaut, duc de Biron\n\n1903: Hilario Hidalgo and Francisco Renteria\n\n1959: Cho Pong-am, Presidential runner-up\n\n1963: 21 Iraqi Communists"
