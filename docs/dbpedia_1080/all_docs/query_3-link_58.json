        "text": "On the afternoon of 13 March 1940 a gunman entered a public meeting at Caxton Hall, Westminster, and assassinated Sir Michael O’Dwyer, a former lieutenant governor of Punjab. That primary job done, he took aim at other members of the platform party and wounded Lord Zetland, the secretary of state for India, Sir Louis Dane, who had been O’Dwyer’s predecessor, and Lord Lamington, a former governor of Bombay.\n\nThis grand assembly of old India hands had just finished their discussion of Afghanistan and the threat posed to it by Germany’s then ally, the Soviet Union. They were relaxed and unaware of any danger; a better-equipped assassin would have made a clean sweep of all four. But the gunman, Udham Singh, had somehow managed to acquire the wrong calibre bullets for his Smith & Wesson; O’Dwyer alone died because he was shot in the back at point blank range and, as the first target, he had no time to defend himself. But O’Dwyer was the only victim Singh cared about – the rest were a bonus in a long-delayed act of revenge that had its origins more than 20 years before, when on 13 April 1919 troops led by General Reginald Dyer fired into a crowd of unarmed civilians in the city of Amritsar, killing either 379 (the official figure) or more than 1,000 of them (the unofficial estimate of the Indian National Congress). Indian fury at the slaughter extended well beyond the nascent independence movement, and the relationship between the rulers and ruled lurched into what became an unstoppable decline.\n\nThe broadcaster Anita Anand had a grandfather who could recall scenes from that terrifying day a century ago, but her book’s preoccupation is the aftermath: how a low-born Sikh murdered a country-born Irishman in the august surroundings of imperial London. In this story, very little is predictable. O’Dwyer, one of 14 siblings born to a Catholic farmer in County Tipperary, is hardly the conventional idea of a senior Raj administrator. Singh, flamboyant enough to find work as an extra in Alexander Korda’s Elephant Boy (where he appears in a corner of the Indian jungle created by the Denham Studios in 1936), refuses to conform to typical characterisations of the lone assassin. In Anand’s narrative, the courses of two lives separated by a gulf in race, class and geography narrow slowly until they meet each other, momentarily and theatrically, on stage in front of a London audience. Hitchcock might have made the film.\n\nAt first glance, neither Singh’s choice of victim nor the source of his motivation is obvious. O’Dwyer was 30 miles away in Lahore, the provincial capital, when General Dyer ordered his troops to fire, and nothing suggests that Singh was a witness to the slaughter. O’Dwyer, however, got up to some bloody mischief of his own the next day when he ordered RAF planes to bomb and machine-gun what he wrongly identified as a rebellious mob in another district of Punjab, while a telegram to Dyer left no doubt that the lieutenant governor approved of the general’s action in Amritsar.\n\nThe Indian members of the official inquiry into the whole tragic debacle issued a minority report that castigated O’Dwyer for his assumption that Punjab was on the brink of revolt, arguing that the massacre had been precipitated by his overreaction. That didn’t moderate O’Dwyer’s views in any way. He continued to support Dyer long after the general resigned and never stopped publicising his belief that the massacre had prevented widespread rebellion. He was a die-hard. He believed that Indian nationalism should never be appeased and that threats to the status quo needed to be punished severely. When Dyer, for long a sick man, died in his West Country cottage in 1927, O’Dwyer was left as the massacre’s most prominent apologist and a good replacement as its chief culprit.\n\nWhat isn’t at all clear is when Singh resolved to kill him. Anand gives the impression that he swore vengeance on the day of the massacre itself or soon after. She has a puzzling passage in italics, no other author credited, which reads like a historical romance: Singh “took a handful of blood-soaked earth in his hand … and he swore a terrible vow … No matter how long it took, no matter how far it took him … he would track down the dogs who did this to his people and kill them.” In fact, no firm evidence places him at the scene of the killings or anywhere else in Amritsar in April 1919. Perhaps Anand intends only to show how popular Indian history would like to see Singh, or how Singh would have liked to see himself. Certainly the earlier that Singh’s resolve can be shown to take hold, the more the book’s title can be justified, though given the shortage of information about his intentions for most of the period 1919 to 1940, a more accurate title might have been “The Wandering Assassin”. What Anand provides about his state of mind is reasonable biographical speculation; all we know for certain is that he moved about the world like an adventurer.\n\nBorn the son of railway crossing-keeper in rural Punjab and raised in an orphanage, Singh left India for the first time during the first world war, when he joined the Indian army’s expeditionary force to Mesopotamia as a carpenter. Lowly jobs in India followed, and then he went off again to work as a labourer on the Uganda Railway in East Africa. He travelled to England via France and eventually to Mexico, where he settled in El Paso for a time until in 1924 he was smuggled across the US border and into California. It was here, under the tutelage and occasional subsidy of the revolutionary Ghadar movement, that Singh seems to have discovered his vocation as an anti-Raj propagandist.\n\nAccording to Anand, the Ghadars sent him on tours to continental Europe and the Soviet Union, and eventually to the UK, where his multiple aliases and addresses and his trip to Russia soon made him of interest to the authorities. In 1936, a Scotland Yard memo noted that he was believed to be “co-habiting with a white woman somewhere in the West End of London and working at intervals on ‘crowd scenes’ at film studios”. He began to be followed everywhere by two policemen in plain clothes.\n\nOther Punjabis who had settled in London were often pedlars – door-to-door salesmen of household goods – and he made friends with several of them. They noticed his boldness – his irreligiousness, his pub going, his white girlfriends, and how he would sometimes speak to the detectives who were trailing him. “Why don’t you go home to your family? Don’t waste your time on me. Honestly, I promise I will be a good boy.” In Anand’s phrase, he adopted a “Punjabi prince” persona. And yet somehow the police lost sight of him.\n\nHis trial at the Old Bailey in June 1940 lasted only two days. Worried about its effect on Indian and foreign opinion, the British government determined that it should attract as little publicity as possible. The number of reporters attending was to be limited; all press messages to India and America in particular were to be carefully scrutinised; censors in India were to be put on their guard against any rhetorical “heroics” that Singh might indulge in the dock. In the event, it was Reuters who supplied most of the copy from the trial, and Reuters had agreed to omit anything that could be described as incendiary in the political sense, and to make no connection between the massacre of 1919 and O’Dwyer’s assassination. Helpfully to the government’s purpose, Nehru and Gandhi and other Congress leaders found the murder inconvenient to the policy of peaceful cooperation they were then trying to pursue. Gandhi declared it “an act of insanity”. Singh sank below the waves of wartime news as a solitary killer unconnected to history, perhaps a little mad.\n\nHe was hanged at Pentonville prison – a shamefully bungled execution by a nervous hangman, so Anand has discovered from documents released under the Freedom of Information Act. Her book isn’t perfect. There are some jarring Americanisms – “grunt” for army private, for example – and in terms of technique an inclination to go beyond the cautiously speculative (“There is no reason to believe that he would not have helped spread the word …”) into the assertively fictional (“He took the gun from his overcoat to check it one last time”). But all the same it is an involving account of a strange and obsessive life."
