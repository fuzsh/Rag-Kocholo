        "text": "Pop group The Ska Vengers has made a music video honouring freedom fighter Udham Singh who assassinated a British official in revenge for the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre.\n\nThe animated video tells the story of Shaheed Udham Singh, who shot dead Michael O'Dwyer for sanctioning the killing of hundreds of Indians in Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar, a massacre that hardened opinion against British rule.\n\nThe four-minute video by the group The Ska Vengers takes its title, \"Frank Brazil\", from an alias used by Singh during an overseas undercover trip. It traces Singh's life between the Amritsar massacre and his shooting of the British official in London.\n\nThe video premiered on VH1 India today, 75 years to the day after Singh was executed in London for the assassination of O'Dwyer four months earlier.\n\nO'Dwyer was the British Lieutenant Governor of Punjab when the Jallianwala Bagh killings took place. Singh traveled to England to avenge the atrocity and shot O'Dwyer dead in public in a London hall.\n\nTaru Dalmia, The Ska Vengers' vocalist, said the group was inspired by American blues singer Bessie Smith's famous death song \"Send me to the 'lectric chair\".\n\nIn the new song, the fiery pro-independence protagonist says he doesn't care if he spends 99 years in jail or is sent to the electric chair.\n\nWatch the video here:"
