Lorraine Willis Gillespie

HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) _ Lorraine Willis Gillespie, widow of jazz legend Dizzy Gillespie, died Saturday. She was 84.

Dizzy Gillespie, a trumpeter who helped create the bebop and Afro-Cuban schools of jazz in the 1940s, died in 1993.

The couple met in 1937 when Gillespie was playing with the Teddy Hill Orchestra in Washington, and they married three years later in Boston, Marion "Boo" Frazier, Dizzy's cousin, told The Record of Bergen County.

Lorraine Gillespie was born in Long Branch and grew up in New York City. She worked in a chorus line at the Apollo Theater in Harlem as a teen, and had a tap-dance school in Queens, where the couple first lived.
