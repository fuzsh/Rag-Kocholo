        "text": "May 5, 2023 celebrates the 170th Anniversary of the day the Charter for FLUSHING CEMETERY was accorded. Inasmuch as the surrounding area was abuzz with a horticultural zeitgeist not surprisingly FLUSHING CEMETERY is still a floral and arboreal oasis. A very walkable space it’s the spiritual resting place of many JAZZ giants (HAZEL SCOTT, JOHNNY HODGES, LOUIS ARMSTRONG et al). What is not widely appreciated is that DIZZ GILLESPIE added his swinging presence to the Band upon his Transition on 6 January, 1973. Let’s hear what’s playing in this Jazz Vineyard and discover unsung rhythms and melodies. The venue is easily accessible by LIRR, train and/or bus. Bring your own instrument and let’s create a compositional Tribute."
