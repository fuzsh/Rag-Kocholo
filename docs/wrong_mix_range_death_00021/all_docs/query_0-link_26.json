        "text": "Most people other than perhaps players and player families have long forgotten the 2009 Orange Bowl game, a 20-7 victory by Cincinnati over Virginia Tech.\n\nMany in Miami that night, however, would never forget the rousing version of “The Star-Spangled Banner,” performed by trumpet wizard Arturo Sandoval, who spent 20 years in the Florida city after securing asylum from his native Cuba.\n\nMore than 600,000 have viewed Sandoval”s vibrant performance on YouTube.\n\n“I was very proud of that,” Sandoval said, adding humbly with a laugh, “I think I was lucky that night.”\n\nSandoval, an American citizen now living in Southern California, always reminds himself the song means far more than the start of an athletic event.\n\n“It means a lot of opportunity for me and for my family,” he said by phone. “I am so proud and happy to be an American citizen. Any time they ask me to do the anthem, I say Yes, yes, yes. I never say No.”\n\n“When you play the anthem, you do it with dignity, with respect to the melody, and with a passion,” Sandoval said. “You must show your passion.”\n\nSandoval discussed his stellar career three days removed from a minor car accident that postponed this interview. “My back still hurts,” he said.\n\nHowever, he fully expects to recuperate for his Monday appearance at Kuumbwa Jazz Center.\n\nNow in Southern California, the protégé of the late, great Dizzy Gillespie is still at it, touring the world.\n\nSandoval”s extensive tour has him booked through April 2013, plenty of gigs to promote his latest recording, a tribute to Gillespie: “Dear Diz [Every Day I Think of You].”\n\n“Doing this recording, to be honest, was very important,” Sandoval said. “Every recording I ever did since I met him, in a certain way, was dedicated to Dizzy. He was my hero, my mentor. He gave me all kinds of opportunities.”\n\nIt was Gillespie who assisted in gaining Sandoval”s asylum.\n\n“I”m in the U.S. because he brought me here,” Sandoval said. “When I met him, I was frustrated in Cuba, doing almost nothing. He really gave me so many chances and encouraged me to keep trying.”\n\nWithout Gillespie”s intervention, no telling where Sandoval would be today.\n\n“I couldn”t predict the future,” he said. “It”s in the hands of God.”\n\nAnd, seemingly, Gillespie, described by Sandoval as “my spiritual father.” who died at 75 in 1993.\n\n“His advice was always have a love and passion for music,” Sandoval said, adding that there”s no way he could remember one gig during his tours with Gillespie.\n\n“I enjoy equally of them,” Sandoval said. “I always was privileged to play with him. Being together in the same room was a gift from God.”\n\nBesides Gillespie”s “outgoing personality and way he opened his heart to everyone, he was a genius in music,” Sandoval said.\n\nIt was always about entertaining the audience, said Sandoval, “and I agree with that 150 percent. This is our mission. Some people go on stage and forget. But our mission is to entertain people. That”s the most important thing.”\n\nNever is Gillespie gone, Sandoval said.\n\n“Every time I play, I ask him for feedback. I look at the sky and say, Hey Diz, I”m trying my best. Show me the way.””\n\nWhether it”s Gillespie or the late Maynard Ferguson, another trumpet legend Sandoval admires, it”s all about dedication.\n\n“When you”re doing it for a long period of time, it”s all a matter of dedication,” Sandoval said, chuckling that “when I was a younger man, I used to practice 25 hours a day. I still practice, of course. I have no choice.”"
