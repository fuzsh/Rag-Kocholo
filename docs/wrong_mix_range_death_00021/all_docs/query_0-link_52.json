Half Nelson\n\nNotes:\n\n* ALL tracks are fragmented.\n\nThis recording is very lacking in sound quality. The sound, when audible over\n\nthe flaws, is very muffled and distorted. If you take the time to concentrate through\n\nthe flaws, this sounds as though it was a fantastic show. I would have to mark this for\n\nvery enthusiastic completists only.\n\nThanks to Peter Losin for the source!\n\n“In the notes to Philology W 843 Robert Bregman claims that “Miles was on the bill\n\n[this] night but our tapes do not have him and Bird together.” Philology W 843 gives\n\n“possibly August or Fall, 1948” as the date for this session. This raises difficulties,\n\nhowever, since Davis (as a member of the Parker Quintet) was booked in various New York\n\nvenues throughout July, spent the month of August rehearsing his Nonet, and spent most\n\nof September in the Royal Roost with both groups. All of this is well documented on\n\nrecordings. And by December Parker was back at the Roost for a four month gig that\n\nextended through March 1949. Despite these difficulties, Ken Vail (Bird’s Diary)\n\nplaces the Pershing Hotel Gillespie Big Band show on September 26. He makes no mention\n\nof Davis.”- Credit to Peter Losin,http://www.plosin.com/\n\n“A Davis-like trumpet is certainly present on the three titles indicated; it’s hard\n\nto tell whether he plays on the rest of the titles. And given the schedule alluded to\n\nabove, I’m very skeptical that Davis is present at all.” – Credit to Peter Losin,\n\n//www.plosin.com/\n\n“There is also a Parker quintet item (“Groovin’ High,” 1:21) usually placed at\n\nthe Pershing on or around this date. There’s no trumpet solo on this fragment,\n\nso it’s impossible to tell if Davis is present. My guess is that he’s not.”\n\nCredit to Peter Losin,http://www.plosin.com/\n\nQC done by Bgreen\n\nCharlie Parker – Portland, OR (02/25/54)\n\nCHARLIE PARKER & DIZZY GILLESPIE\n\nwith STAN KENTON & HIS ORCHESTRA\n\nCivic Auditorium\n\nPortland, OR (USA)\n\nFebruary 25, 1954 Sound cleaned and Pitch Fixed\n\nDownload FLAC: Amazon Drive\n\nuploaded to Dime 2012 February 5 by u014945\n\na Flambay – u014945 production\n\nThe Sound was good\n\nThere were just 2 clicks in the first 2 tracks and one in the following 3 tracks (7 clicks in total)\n\nNothing else was done\n\nDime > Audacity (noises cutting ) > TLH ( SBE – Flac 8) > dime\n\nCharlie Parker (as on tracks 1 – 3)\n\nDizzy Gillespie (tp,announcements on tracks 4 – 6)\n\nwith Stan Kenton & his Orchestra:\n\nSam Noto, Vic Minichiello, Buddy Childers, Don Smith, Stu Williamson (tp),\n\nMilt Gold, Joe Ciavardone, George Roberts, Frank Rosolino tb),\n\nCharlie Mariano, Dave Schildkraut (as), Mike Cichetti, Bill Perkins (ts),\n\nTony Ferina (bs), Stan Kenton (p), Bob Lesher (g),\n\nDon Bagley (b), Stan Levey (dr), Candido (cga on track 5)\n\nNIGHT AND DAY (2:42) 2:47\n\nMY FUNNY VALENTINE (3:17) 3:23\n\nCHEROKEE (3:03) 3:09\n\nON THE ALAMO (2:50) 2:56\n\nMANTECA (5:56) 6:11\n\nA SHORT ONE (0:22) 0:24\n\nTotal time: 18:13 18:55\n\nOn the right timing after pitch Correction\n\nSound: B\n\nLineage: 7″ blank disc @ 33 1/3 r.p.m > CDRec > CD > Nero (flac 8) > HDD\n\nNote: As to the best of my knowledge these recordings are/were only available on various bootlegs (EPs, LPs, CDs); no official release is known.\n\nDiscographical information:\n\nPiet Koster: Bird Lore, a revised Charlie Parker Discography (Names and Numbers, Almere 2005)\n\nChris Sheridan: Dizzy Gillespie Discography (not yet published but in progress)"
