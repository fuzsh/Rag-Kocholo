        "text": "South Carolina is the birthplace of a number of famous people, including one of the world’s best jazz musicians, Dizzy Gillespie. Born John Birks Gillespie in 1917 in Cheraw, South Carolina, the jazz trumpeter, band leader, composer, singer, and educator started playing piano at just four years of age. He was the son of a local bandleader in Cheraw. After Gillespie’s father died when the boy was just 10, Dizzy Gillespie would go on to teach himself trumpet and trombone by the age of twelve. When he was 18, his family moved to Philadelphia, but Gillespie spent his childhood and teen years right here in South Carolina.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHave you been?
