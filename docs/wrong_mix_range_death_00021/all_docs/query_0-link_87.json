        "text": "Fats Navarro (born September 24, 1923, Key West, Florida, U.S.—died July 7, 1950, New York, New York) was an American jazz trumpet virtuoso, one of the founders of bebop, who was distinguished by the beauty and fertility of his melodic creations.\n\nNavarro first performed as a tenor saxophonist in Miami, Florida, and went on to play trumpet in big bands, most notably Andy Kirk’s (1943–44) and the avant-garde Billy Eckstine band of 1945–46. He then worked and recorded with other well-known leaders, including Illinois Jacquet and Coleman Hawkins, before making the most important association of his career with composer-bandleader Tadd Dameron in 1948–49. By then, however, Navarro’s heroin addiction had made him undependable; in his last year, as he grew progressively more ill from tuberculosis, he performed less often."
