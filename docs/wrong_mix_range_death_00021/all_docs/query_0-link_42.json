        "text": "American jazz trumpeter, pianist and composer\n\nMusical artist\n\nArturo Sandoval (born November 6, 1949) is a Cuban-American jazz trumpeter, pianist, timbalero, and composer. While living in his native Cuba, Sandoval was influenced by jazz musicians Charlie Parker, Clifford Brown, and Dizzy Gillespie. In 1977 he met Gillespie, who became his friend and mentor and helped him defect from Cuba while on tour with the United Nations Orchestra. Sandoval became an American naturalized citizen in 1998. His life was the subject of the film For Love or Country: The Arturo Sandoval Story (2000) starring Andy García.\n\nSandoval has won 10 Grammy Awards, Billboard Awards and one Emmy Award. He performed at the White House[1] and at the Super Bowl (1995)[2]\n\nSandoval was born into a poor family in Artemisa, a small village in the province of Havana, Cuba. He started playing music at the age of thirteen in the village band, learning the basics of music theory and percussion. After playing many instruments, he finally settled on the trumpet, playing with street musicians. In 1964, Sandoval enrolled at the Cuban National School of Arts where he took classical trumpet lessons for three years, and earned a place in the country's all-star national band. He helped establish the Orquesta Cubana de Musica Moderna, which became the band Irakere in 1973. He toured worldwide with his own group in 1981. During the following year he toured with Dizzy Gillespie, who became his friend and mentor. From 1982 to 1984, he was voted Cuba's Best Instrumentalist and was a guest artist at the BBC and Leningrad Symphony Orchestras.\n\nIn 1989, Gillespie invited Sandoval to be part of the United Nations Orchestra. During a tour with this group, Sandoval visited the American Embassy in Athens, Greece, accompanied by Gillespie who helped him with his plan to defect from Cuba. He became an American citizen on December 7, 1998.[3]\n\nSandoval has performed Latin jazz with Paquito D'Rivera, Tito Puente, and Chico O'Farrill, Cuban music in Miami, and classical music in England and Germany. In the 1990s, he was a member of the GRP All-Star Big Band.[3]\n\nIn 2014, Sandoval performed at Eastman Theatre with Zane Musa, Dave Siegel, Teymur Phel, Johnny Friday, and Armando Arce.[4]\n\nHe has taught at Florida International University and Whitworth University, where he is in charge of its jazz ensemble.[5] He has performed with Los Angeles Philharmonic, Pittsburgh Symphony and National Symphony Orchestras. In 1996, Sandoval was commissioned by the Kennedy Center Ballet to score Pepito's Story, a ballet based on the book by Eugene Fern and choreographed by Debbie Allen. Sandoval also composed a classical trumpet concerto that he performed and recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra.\n\nSandoval's score for a film about his life won an Emmy Award.[6] His compositions and performances can be heard on The Mambo Kings, which was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1992 for Best Instrumental Composition Written for a Motion Picture or for Television.[7]\n\nHis song \"A Mis Abuelos\" (To My Grandparents) received Grammy Award nominations for Best Instrumental Composition and Best Arrangement. This composition appeared on his Grammy-winning album Danzon.[7]\n\nOn November 20, 2013, President Barack Obama presented Sandoval with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[8]\n\nOn December 8, 2024 will received the Kennedy Center Honor.[9]\n\nIn 2015, Arturo Sandoval joined the 14th annual Independent Music Awards judging panel to assist independent musicians' careers.[10] He was also a judge for the 10th,[11] 12th[12] and 13th Independent Music Awards.[13]\n\nTuri (Areito, 1981)\n\nArturo Sandoval y Su Grupo (Areito, 1982)\n\nTo a Finland Station with Dizzy Gillespie (Pablo, 1982)\n\nBreaking the Sound Barrier (Chicago Caribbean, 1983)\n\nTumbaito (Messidor, 1986)\n\nNo Problem (Jazz House, 1987)\n\nStraight Ahead (Jazz House, 1988)\n\nPlays for the Pandas (Cocoral, 1988)\n\nJust Music (Jazz House, 1989)\n\nArturo Sandoval (Areito, 1991)\n\nFlight to Freedom (GRP, 1991)\n\nI Remember Clifford (GRP, 1992)\n\nDream Come True (GRP, 1993)\n\nDanzón (GRP, 1994)\n\nThe Classical Album (RCA Victor, 1994)\n\nArturo Sandoval & the Latin Train (GRP, 1995)\n\nSwingin'(GRP, 1996) [14]\n\nHot House (N-Coded, 1998)\n\nAmericana (N-Coded, 1999)\n\nLos Elefantes with Wynton Marsalis (In-akustik, 1999)\n\nFor Love or Country: The Arturo Sandoval Story (Atlantic, 2000)\n\nJam Miami (Concord, 2000)\n\nRonnie Scott's Jazz House (DCC, 2000)\n\nL.
