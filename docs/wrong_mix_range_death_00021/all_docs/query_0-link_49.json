        "text": "A year ago, it was trumpeter Jon Faddis. Now, the Spartanburg Jazz Ensemble is set to bring another world-class musician with direct ties to the late Dizzy Gillespie to the Hub City.\n\nAfro-Cuban jazz drummer Ignacio Berroa, who played with Gillespie from 1981 until his death in 1993, will join the Spartanburg Jazz Ensemble for a performance at 8 p.m. Friday at Wofford College’s Leonard Auditorium. The concert is free and open to the public.\n\n“I’m very excited to be coming there for the first time; I’ve never been to Spartanburg,” Berroa said when I reached him by phone recently. “I’ll be playing with some great musicians, I’m sure, and I’m looking forward to making some new friends.”\n\nThis won’t be Berroa’s first time performing in South Carolina, however. He was in the Palmetto State as recently as 2015 when he played the S.C. Jazz Festival in Cheraw, which is the birthplace of Gillespie.\n\nBerroa, who was born in Cuba and now lives in Miami, described his association with Gillespie as “something meaningful in both my personal life and my musical career in the United States.”\n\nHaving immigrated to the U.S. during the Mariel boatlift in 1980, Berroa quickly established himself on the New York City jazz scene and was introduced to Gillespie by Afro-Cuban jazz legend Mario Bauzá.\n\nBerroa said he listened to records by Gillespie while he was growing up and that he actually got to see the jazz icon perform live in Havana in 1977.\n\n“The most amazing thing for me about Dizzy Gillespie is that, as great as he was as a musician, he was also an incredible human being (who was) always eager to help others,” Berroa said. “Dizzy Gillespie was one of the greatest human beings I have ever met.”\n\nAmong other ensembles, Berroa was a member of Gillespie’s United Nations Orchestra, which won a Grammy Award for its 1990 album, “Live at the Royal Festival Hall.”\n\nGillespie once described Berroa as “the only Latin drummer in the world in the history of American music (who) intimately knows both worlds: his native Afro Cuban music as well as jazz.”\n\nBerroa, who received Grammy nominations for his first two albums as a band leader in the mid to late 2000s, is noted for blending the music of his native land with American jazz.\n\n“My mentor, the Cuban musician Mario Bauzá, advised me to do something that would be my trademark,” Berroa said, “so while I was in Dizzy Gillespie’s quartet, I started to explore mixing straight ahead jazz with Afro-Cuban rhythms.”\n\nBerroa said that, during the reign of Fidel Castro, the Cuban government looked upon jazz as being “music that represented the enemy,” yet he was able to listen to it regularly through radio broadcasts from the U.S. and on records released prior to the 1959 revolution. Having played violin as a youth, Berroa, 65, switched to drums after hearing Gene Krupa.\n\nBerroa became a U.S. citizen in 1987.\n\n“It means the whole world to me being a citizen of the greatest country in the world,” Berroa said. “I’m very grateful for the opportunity this great nation gave me, and that means a lot regardless of who’s at the White House.”\n\nIn addition to Friday night’s concert, Berroa will lead a masterclass workshop that is also open to the public at 3:30 p.m. at Leonard Auditorium.\n\nI think it’s really cool that the Spartanburg Jazz Ensemble is able to bring world-class musicians such as Berroa to the Hub City, and I encourage area music lovers to take advantage of such a rare opporunity.\n\n“I really hope that not only jazz fans but also those who aren’t as familiar with jazz come to the concert,” Berroa said. “I can assure them that they’re going to see a great jazz concert with a bunch of musicians who are going to play their hearts out.”\n\nA closer look at some of this week’s area shows:\n\nThe Shane Pruitt Band will perform at 9:30 p.m. Friday at Delaney’s Irish Pub in Spartanburg. The Hub City-based trio has been a fixture on the regional music circuit for more than a decade, wowing audiences with an electrifying mix of blues-oriented rock ‘n’ roll that’s tinged with elements of vintage gospel.\n\nThe Wes, Bob and Bill Show will perform at 8:30 p.m. Friday at Growler Haus in Spartanburg. Armed with acoustic instruments and fueled by plenty of passion, the Hub City-based trio delivers a hi-octane blend of bluegrass, folk and old-time country that features some undercurrents of jazz and swing.\n\nDiamond Rio will perform at 8 p.m. Friday at the Blind Horse Saloon in Greenville. One of the most successful country music acts of the 1990s, the Grammy Award-winning band is known for such major hits as “Meet in the Middle,” “How Your Love Makes Me Feel” and “Beautiful Mess.”\n\nCPR will perform at 5:45 p.m. Saturday at RJ Rockers in Spartanburg. Composed of some of the Upstate’s finest musicians, the band aims to resuscitate rock ‘n’ roll with an edgy sound that’s loaded with crunchy guitar riffs and solid vocal harmonies.\n\nLooking ahead:\n\nNew Edition’s Ronnie DeVoe, Bobby Brown, Ricky Bell and Michael Bivins have joined forces again as RBRM and will bring their “4 The Love of It” tour to the Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium for a performance at 8 p.m. May 24. Tickets are $48-$108 and on sale now. For more information, call 800-745-3000 or visit www.ticketmaster.com."
