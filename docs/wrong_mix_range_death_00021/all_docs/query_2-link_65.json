        "text": "By Mia Jackson\n\nDizzy Gillespie helped make Minton’s Playhouse famous.\n\nMinton’s in Harlem was where jazz musicians — from out-of-towners to locals performing in nearby big band theaters in Harlem — sought refuge during late-night jam sessions, and a new genre, bebop, was born. Gillespie, together with Charlie Parker, is largely considered a pioneer of the rebellious jazz style that diverged from mainstream swing jazz’s emphasis on orchestrated productions and collective harmony. Instead, it ushered in an era of artistic experimentation that better reflected the realities of Black urban life and the talents of Black musicians.\n\n“Jam sessions, such as those wonderfully exciting ones held at Minton’s Playhouse, were seedbeds for our new, modern style of music,” Gillespie wrote in his autobiography, “To Be or Not to Bop.”\n\nBut there was another gathering spot for Gillespie and his peers: the three-story Colonial Revival-style building in Corona, a neighborhood in Queens, that he bought in 1953.\n\nJazz clubs were in Harlem. But jazz musicians lived on the tree-lined streets of Queens. While white musicians skedaddled to the suburbs, Black jazz virtuosos sought solace in the neighborhoods where their racial identity was welcomed — ultimately congregating into two enclaves in the borough. The first was in the southeast by Addisleigh Park where composer Clarence Williams and his wife moved in the 1930s, with Count Basie, Lena Horne, Duke Ellington’s son, Mercer Ellington, and James Brown eventually following suit. The second was in Corona, where Louis Armstrong lived until his death, and a place that Gillespie, fellow trumpeter Clark Terry and Ella Fitzgerald once called home.\n\nQueens had the charm of the South, conveniences of the northern lifestyle and was close enough to the teeming jazz scene of Harlem without being ensnared. The borough didn’t generate a fresh jazz genre like Harlem. But the borough was an incubator where music got worked out, imagined and revised, as Black musicians were grappling with the commercialization of their craft.\n\nIn June, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission honored the formal and informal spaces from which New York’s jazz scene spawned and flourished by designating three sites as landmarks for their cultural significance to modern jazz — the building at 935 St. Nicholas Ave. in Washington Heights where Duke Ellington and Noble Lee Sissle once lived; Minton’s and its home the Hotel Cecil; and Gillespie’s house at 105-19 37th Ave. in Corona.\n\nAlthough Gillespie lived in Corona after bebop had been established as a genre, he continued to hone his craft while living in Queens. He adopted his iconic bent trumpet and recorded several popular albums, including “Jazz at Massey Hall” (1954) and “Manteca” (1958), and appeared live in 1956 from his home in a broadcast interview on Edward R. Murrow’s “Person to Person” television program.\n\nGillespie often invited fellow musicians to his basement to play alongside him.\n\n“Dizzy, Babs Gonzales and I would mainly spend time down in the basement because that’s where he would rehearse,” said Ernest Gillespie, Dizzy’s cousin. Ernest Gillespie, now 96, lived in nearby East Elmhurst during that time and currently resides in Fresh Meadows, Queens.\n\nThe basement housed a full set of drums, a piano and, eventually, a pool table and train set. The fridge in the basement was always stocked with Carlsberg Elephant, his favorite beer. The walls were adorned with art from other countries, souvenirs collected during his time as the nation’s first jazz ambassador. Starting in 1956, the State Department financed Gillespie and his band to travel across the world promoting democratic values.\n\nGillespie also nurtured many up-and-coming musicians. “I met Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald and Junior Mance in that basement,” said Dizzy’s godson, Harris Stratyner, now 68, who was a budding saxophone and clarinet player at the time. “Dizzy really was a teacher. He would teach the young cats how to play and how to follow rhythms, and it all happened in his basement in Corona.”\n\nJeanie Bryson, 65, Gillespie’s daughter and an accomplished singer, lived in nearby LeFrak City along with her mother, composer Connie Bryson, who was never married to Gillespie.\n\nThe father-daughter relationship, hidden from public view, was limited, but Jeanie Bryson recalled how her father would visit and she remembered his mentorship of musicians fondly.\n\n“He helped so many young musicians from different countries and gave these guys an opportunity that was beyond their imagination at the time,” she said.\n\nGillespie was married to Lorraine Gillespie, who was also his personal manager. They had no children together, but they built a family in the neighborhood. On the outside, their home was an ordinary redbrick building much like the other homes in the area, including their neighbor’s, Armstrong, who lived around the corner. Armstrong’s home was designated a historic landmark in 1988 and opened for public tours in 2003.\n\nArmstrong bought a home in Corona with his wife, Lucille, in 1943, a decade before the Gillespies. Here, he carved out a humble life in a neighborhood of predominantly Italian immigrants and a growing community of middle-income Black residents. “We’re right out here with the rest of the colored folk and the Puerto Ricans and Italians and the Hebrew cats,” Armstrong told Ebony magazine in 1964. “What the hell I care about living in a ‘fashionable’ neighborhood?”\n\nHis classic hit “What a Wonderful World” was written by Bob Thiele and David George Weiss as a tribute to Armstrong’s beloved Corona.\n\nThe demographics of the neighborhood have changed in the decades since, with Latino immigrants replacing Italian immigrants in the 1960s, drawn by relatively affordable real estate and a welcoming attitude, the same forces that once lured Black newcomers. Now, the neighborhood is a hub for the next generation of Mexican, Ecuadorian and Dominican residents.\n\nThere are very few public acknowledgments of the period when Black musicians called Corona home. The Corona East Elmhurst Historic Preservation Society has long argued that the city’s Landmarks Preservation Commission has not properly recognized the historical significance of Queens properties. The society filed the initial petition in 2015 to have Gillespie’s home designated a landmark, but was denied. “Corona East Elmhurst, with its rich history and significant traditions is in jeopardy of becoming a negligible factor in the thought of the world,” the group wrote in the initial petition.\n\n“We felt we needed to create this society to preserve, protect and promote the history and legacy so future generations will know the greatness of the community,” said Deborah Tyson, one of the founders of the local society.\n\nThe Queens Borough President’s Office, in collaboration with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, has been placing banners, murals and signage along the AirTrain’s John F. Kennedy Airport route from Jamaica, Queens, as a small but insufficient attempt to bring awareness to the borough’s rich musical heritage.\n\n“We need to try to preserve the history because there aren’t many people left who know the story of the community,” Tyson said. “We have places that are worthy of preservation. They may not look like a brownstone or a mansion on Fifth Avenue, but it doesn’t mean they aren’t worthy of preservation as well.”"
