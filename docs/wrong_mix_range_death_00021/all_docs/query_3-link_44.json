        "text": "In late 1975, the 34th Medical Battalion, at Fort Benning GA took on the task of putting a proper marker on the grave of Blind Tom Wiggins, as a Bicentennial Project. I was the Battalion project officer for this effort. We collected donations from everyone who wanted to give, but were still short several dollars on buying a proper tombstone. Sgt Bruce Bergstresser and I went to see Ed Stovall, who had a monument business in Columbus. I explained the project and told him we were a tad short on funds. He replied, \"Give me what you have and go out in the yard and pick out any tombstone that you like. I will engrave it and place it on Blind Tom's grave. I am happy to be able to help in a project like this.\" The picture was made when we went to look at the stone, for the first time.\n\nSgt. Bruce Bergstresser, Project Officer Bill Walton and Ed Stovall\n\nI had requested that Stovall put some musical notes on the marker, but the trumpet was his idea. When I told him the Tom was a piano player it didn't take him a second or to to say, \"This trumpet is the one Gabriel used to call Tom home.\" Lisa Battle, Ledger-Enquirer reporter who was covering this story put that quote in one of her articles. The marker dedication at the Westmoreland estate took place on 10 Feb 1976. My battalion commander wanted to put a little marker on the tombstone indicating that it was placed there by the 34th Medical Bn. I convinced him that this was \"tacky-first class\" and besides if you add up the figures in the dates it totals 34, the number of our Battalion. Coincident-Of course, but it worked. I know there is some question about Tom's birthdate so we used the same dates which are on the bronze historical marker, put up by the GA Historical Society on nearby Warm Springs Road.\n\nLt Wayne Valadez, 34th Medical Battalion, looks over the gravesite and original tombstone once believed to be that of Blind Tom, on Westmoreland estate, near Columbus GA. Bruce Bergstresser and I assumed the responsibility of digging up this tombstone so the new one could be put it place. We did not realize how big the stone was or the fact that the cedar tree on the left had wrapped it's roots around the stone. It took us a long time, digging and chopping, to remove the original stone. After we were finished I asked Mrs. Fredrick Dismuke if she wanted to keep the stone. She said, \"No, it is just an old rock as far as I am concerned.\" So Bruce and I carried/rolled it to my car and drove it to my house. It has been in my backyard for over 25 years. I keep trying to interest some of the local historians into putting the stone \"somewhere,\" but so far no luck.\n\nThe participants at the dedication of the Blind Tom marker at Westmoreland estate, on 10 Feb 1976, were Elnora Walker (left), Tom's niece and the only person I could find that had seen/been with him, Fredrick Dismuke (right), who owned Westmoreland, and LTC Donald L Hull (second from right), 34th Medical Battalion Commander. They were supposed to raise the cloth covering the tombstone. But at the last second, Therese Dismuke came out of the crowd and lifted the cloth herself and then stepped back into the crowd. It happened so fast that I don't think Mrs. Walker ever realized what had happened. I was laying under a cedar tree and snapped this picture just as it took place. I made another after Mrs Dismuke disappeared and that was used in the local paper. But I think this one tells a better story. Following the dedication ceremony Mrs Dismuke invited the all the attendees for a tour of Westmoreland and refreshments. Nothing was ever said or written about her participation in the ceremony.\n\n- Bill Walton, personal correspondence October 2001\n\nAlso present at the dedication was family member Carrie E. Wiggins Poulain-Ford shown standing on the left in this photo next to Elnora Walker who is seated with the cane.\n\n- photo courtest of Henry Stallings, Jr., January 2006.\n\nDizzy Gillespie Plays \"When The Saints Go Marchin' In\"\n\nAt Thomas Wiggins (Blind Tom) Gravesite\n\nnear Columbus, Georgia, May 1979.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Columbus Times."
