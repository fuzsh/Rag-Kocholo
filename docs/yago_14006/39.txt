Cliff Robertson, who won an Oscar for portraying a mentally handicapped man in Charly in 1968, died on Saturday at age 88.

Roberton's secretary of 53 years, Evelyn Christel, told the Associated Press the actor died of natural causes in Long Island, one day after his 88th birthday.

In 1963, Robertson played a young John F. Kennedy in PT 109. In recent years, Robertson was known for his role as Uncle Ben in the Spider-Man movies.

The California native was married to Cynthia Stone from 1957 to 1960; they had one daughter together, Stephanie. He was married to Dina Merrill from 1966 to 1986 and had a daughter named Heather together. Heather passed away in 2007 of pancreatic cancer, before both of her parents.

His daughter Stephanie Saunders said in a statement obtained by the wire service: "My father was a loving father, devoted friend, dedicated professional and honorable man. He stood by his family, friends, and colleagues through good times and bad. He made a difference in all our lives and made our world a better place. We will all miss him terribly."
