        "text": "NEW YORK — President John F. Kennedy had just one critique when he saw photos of the actor set to play him in a World War II drama.\n\nThe year was 1963 and actor Cliff Robertson looked convincing in his costume for “PT-109,” the first film to portray a sitting president. Kennedy had favored Robertson for the role, but one detail was off.\n\nRobertson’s hair was parted on the wrong side.\n\nThe actor dutifully trained his locks to part on the left and won praise for a role he’d remain proud of throughout his life.\n\nRobertson, who went on to win an Oscar for his portrayal of a mentally disabled man in “Charly”, died of natural causes Saturday afternoon in Stony Brook, a day after his 88th birthday, according to Evelyn Christel, his secretary of 53 years.\n\nRobertson never elevated into the top ranks of leading men, but he remained a popular actor from the mid-1950s into the following century. His later roles included kindly Uncle Ben in the “Spider-Man” movies.\n\nHe also gained attention for his second marriage to actress and heiress Dina Merrill, daughter of financier E.F. Hutton and Marjorie Merriweather Post, heiress to the Post cereal fortune and one of the world’s richest women.\n\nHis triumph came in 1968 with his Academy Award performance in “Charly,” as a mentally disabled man who undergoes medical treatment that makes him a genius — until a poignant regression to his former state.\n\n“My father was a loving father, devoted friend, dedicated professional and honorable man,” daughter Stephanie Saunders said in a statement. “He stood by his family, friends, and colleagues through good times and bad. He made a difference in all our lives and made our world a better place. We will all miss him terribly.”\n\nRobertson first appeared in the “Charly” story in a TV version, “The Two Worlds of Charlie Gordon.” Both were based on “Flowers for Algernon,” a short story that author Daniel Keyes later revised into a novel. Robertson was determined that this time the big-screen role would not go to another actor.\n\n“I bought the movie rights to the show, and I tried for eight years to persuade a studio to make it,” he said in 1968. “Finally I found a new company, ABC Films. I owned 50 percent of the gross, but I gave half of it to Ralph Nelson to direct.”\n\nCritic Roger Ebert called Robertson’s portrayal “a sensitive, believable one.” The motion picture academy agreed, though Robertson was unable to get a break from an overseas movie shoot and was not on hand when his Oscar was announced.\n\nBorn Sept. 9, 1923, in La Jolla, Robertson was 2 when he was adopted by parents who named him Clifford Parker Robertson III.\n\nRobertson studied briefly at Antioch College, majoring in journalism, then returned to California and appeared in two small roles in Hollywood movies. Rejected by the services in World War II because of a weak eye, he served in the Merchant Marine.\n\nRobertson’s first performance for Columbia, “Picnic,” was impressive, even though his screen pal, William Holden, stole the girl, Kim Novak. He followed with a tearjerker, “Autumn Leaves,” as Joan Crawford’s young husband, then a musical, “The Girl Most Likely” with Jane Powell. In 1959, he endeared himself to “Gidget” fans as The Big Kahuna, the mature Malibu surf bum who takes Gidget under his wing.\n\nRobertson’s funeral is set for Friday in East Hampton."
