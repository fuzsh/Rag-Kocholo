He was 88.\n\nMr. Robertson had enjoyed a career lasting 50 years with success not only in movies but also on TV and the stage. However, he was blacklisted in Hollywood for several years after blowing the whistle on a financial scandal in 1977.\n\nHe was heir to a ranching fortune but it was acting that he wanted to pursue and got his first big break in films in 1955 when he appeared in Picnic with William Holden.\n\nRuggedly handsome, Mr. Robertson played the young John F. Kennedy in P.T. 109 (1963), which dramatised the President’s wartime experiences.\n\nMr. Robertson won an Oscar in 1968 for the film Charly in which he played a man who was mentally disabled.\n\nAmong his TV credits was 1977 mini series Washington: Behind Closed Doors, in which he co-starred with Jason Robards and Stephanie Powers.\n\nAmong his final work in films was as the kindly uncle Ben in the Spider-Man series of the early 2000s.\n\nMr. Robertson was married three times.
