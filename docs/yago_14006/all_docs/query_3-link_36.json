        "text": "Cynthia Stone believes she and Sting were twins separated at birth, because they share the same birthday and original last name. Since she's a native Austinite, some complications in proving their kinship are sure to arise. All of which provides creative fodder for the family sagas she loves to write. Cynthia wrote her first story at age five and has continued to indulge that Muse ever since. Her checkered career includes magazine publishing, copywriting, professional fundraising for the fine arts, antiques importing, and interior decorating. She still lives in Austin with her ever-patient husband, Gerald.\n\nConnect with Cynthia online: www.TreatyOakPublishers.com"
