        "text": "Godzilla suddenly attacks the First Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building.\n\nThe human race is determined to intercept Godzilla with a new super-weapon, the \"Super X2 Kai\", but...\n\nâ This is the third attack on Shinjuku since \"Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah\" was released in 1991!\n\nFor the first time in 33 years, Godzilla appears in the Shinjuku New Urban Center area since the 1991 attack on Shinjuku. After 33 years, Godzilla appears and destroys the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building with far more power than expected. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government scrambles the \"Super X2 Kai,\" a dedicated Godzilla interceptor that had been secretly developed to intercept Godzilla, in an attempt to intercept Godzilla... What will become of the battle between \"Godzilla\" and \"Super X2 Kai\"? And will a savior appear?\n\nâ A 100-meter-sized Godzilla will appear before your eyes!\n\nA life-size Godzilla will destroy the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building and appear before your eyes, a feat only possible through projection mapping on the largest scale ever achieved. You will be able to experience the real Godzilla, which no one has ever seen before, with your whole body!\n\nâ Using the Godzilla suit from the Heisei VS series\n\nThe 100-meter tall Godzilla from the \"Heisei VS Series\" will appear in this projection mapping. The Godzilla in the projection mapping was filmed using the Godzilla suit from the Heisei VS series, and the content was created by combining special effects and computer graphics. The powerful Godzilla, projected on the wall of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building on a life-size scale, will make a great stand against the \"Super X2 Kai\" and is a must-see!\n\nDirector : Kazuhiro Nakagawa\n\nGodzilla is a globally popular content that Japan is proud of, with \"Godzilla-1.0,\" a film commemorating the 70th anniversary of Godzilla's birth released last year, and \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" released in Japan on April 26, each a huge hit around the world. The Shinjuku area and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building have a deep connection with Godzilla.\n\nIn \"Godzilla\" (1984), the super-weapon \"Super X\" intercepted Godzilla in a fierce battle in Nishi-Shinjuku. In \"Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah\" (1991), the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building No. 1 appeared in the film. It was severely damaged in the fierce battle between Godzilla and Mecha King Ghidorah, adding to the impressive scene.\n\nIn 2015, a 12-meter-tall Godzilla head was created in Kabukicho, Shinjuku-ku, and Godzilla was appointed as a special envoy for Shinjuku tourism.\n\nâ What is \"Godzilla\"?\n\nSince its appearance before us, the king of monsters has made his name known around the world.\n\nThe first film in the series, released in 1954, was an unprecedented hit, drawing an audience of 9.61 million. Since then, more than 30 films have been produced in Japan alone, and the total number of viewers for the series has exceeded 100 million. To this day, the series continues to enjoy broad popularity and overwhelming recognition among men and women of all ages. Godzilla, who has been portrayed as an existence beyond human understanding, sometimes plays an active role on the screen as a barrier that humans must overcome and sometimes as an ally of humans. Godzilla's themes reflect the social conditions of each era, and he has captivated the people of that era.\n\nThe popularity of Godzilla has transcended the oceans, and the new Hollywood version of \"Godzilla x Kong: A New Empire\" has been a huge hit in North America and other parts of the world.\n\nUkiyo paintings, which were developed in the Edo period and are works of art depicting various aspects of daily life of the time with vivid and delicate colors, and âUkiyoâ as a world that is constantly changing are combined in this work.Ukiyo-e depicts various aspects of Japanese culture and daily life as it changed with the times, from the Edo period to the present day.\n\nThe context in which the world of Ukiyo-e paintings is connected to contemporary pop culture is expressed through a combination of visuals generated by AI learning and CG by the creators.\n\nPlanning and Supervisionï¼Michiyuki Ishita (Japan)\n\nVideoï¼Johnï¼Kourtney\n\nA spectacular projection mapping show created based on the concept of Tokyo's attractions \"playing in concert\" with music. Various essences of Tokyo are condensed into three movements, running from the past to the future. The first movement depicts the mysterious rising of the sun and the beginning of everything, followed by the natural charm of Tokyo. In the second movement, Edo, which used to be a countryside of rice paddies, is transformed into the birthplace of culture and eventually leads to the powerful Tokyo, which has developed into one of the world's most prominent cities. The second movement depicts the diverse activities and cultures of the people of Edo. The third movement depicts the technology and power that Tokyo possesses as it leads into the future, and the positive creativity of the future emerges.\n\nThe music will be composed by Hideaki Takahashi, a musician active both in Japan and abroad, including Team Lab. The classical and grandiose first movement is followed by a festive band music in the second movement, and a fast-moving techno music in the third movement. Each movement was created by top creators from Japan, Canada, and Thailand, and their individual personalities are united in the music of Tokyo Concerto.\n\nPlanning/Direction/Director: Michiyuki Ishita (Japan)\n\nComposition: Hideaki Takahashi (Japan)\n\nSound Effects: Makato Shozu (Japan)\n\nFirst movement video: DecideKit (Thailand)\n\nSecond movement video: AVA Animation & Visual Arts (Canada)\n\nThird movement video: FLIGHTGRAF (Japan)"
