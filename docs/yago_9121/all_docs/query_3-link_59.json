Created by the UK Oxford based field recording and sound art network Cities And Memory, the interactive map documents demonstrations, political activism and civil resistance from 49 cities and 27 countries. Users can upload their own sounds, and artists have been invited to remix new musical montages from the database contents.\n\nMostly made this year, the recordings from Chile, Cambodia, Iceland, India, UK, the USA and elsewhere tackle Donald Trump, Brexit, The Occupy movement, Black Lives Matter, G20 and the COP conferences, Womenâ€™s March, Islamic State, Syria, education cuts, a radio station closure, and more."
