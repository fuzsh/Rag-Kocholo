        "text": "Earlier this year in February, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government No. 1 Building in Shinjuku took on a new role after sundown. Designed by famed Japanese architect Kenzo Tange, this iconic building now serves as the backdrop for a jaw-dropping and record-breaking projection mapping show. Covering an impressive area of roughly 13,905sqm, the after-dark spectacle was certified by Guinness World Records as the largest permanent display of its kind in the world.\n\nThis nightly showcase features a handful of distinct projection mappings created by a mix of local and international artists, each drawing inspiration from Tokyo's rich history and themes like the lunar cycle. On weeknights you’ll see ‘Evolution’ and ‘Lunar Cycle’ while weekends and holidays present ‘Tokyo Concerto’, ‘Zankyo Sanka (Aimer)’, ‘Evolution’ and ‘800 (Aimer)’. These five shows have been in the building's regular programme since February, but the organisers recently introduced a monstrous new addition to the building’s nighttime repertoire.\n\nUnveiled on April 27, 'Godzilla: Attack on Tokyo!' is an ode to Japan’s OG kaiju (monster) franchise. The show feels timely following the global success of 'Godzilla Minus One' (2023), but longtime superfans will appreciate the special connection between Godzilla and the Shinjuku ward, famously showcased in the 1991 film 'Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah'. Tokyo already has a nod to this battle in the form of a Godzilla head peering out from the Toho Cinemas Shinjuku building, but we feel that the legendary monster franchise is deserving of more site-specific tributes like this one.\n\nA creature that’s infamous for crushing entire neighbourhoods with one swish of a spiked tail isn’t normally what you’d want to see appear amid one of Tokyo’s busiest districts. But thankfully, this 100-metre-tall Godzilla is all special effects and poses no real threat to you or the metropolis.\n\nThe Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building projection mapping shows currently run every night from 7pm to 9.15pm on weeknights and from 7pm to 9.10pm on weekends and public holidays. From May 7, the shows will run from 7.30pm to 9.40pm daily. Note that 'Godzilla: Attack on Tokyo!' only runs on weekends and public holidays for the time being. The full programme of daily projection mapping shows is available here.\n\nFor more information, visit the Shinjuku Convention and Visitors Bureau website.\n\nThis article was published on February 27 and updated on April 30.\n\nMore from Time Out\n\nTokyo is ranked the sixth most walkable city in the world\n\nShibuya Sky is opening its rooftop bar for a limited time\n\nKawaguchiko is blocking the Mt Fuji view at this popular Lawson store\n\nTokyo Disneyland is suspending its daily fireworks show this summer\n\nIn photos: Tokyo's first Sailor Moon manhole covers are now installed at Azabu-Juban"
