        "text": "Yokohama's Minatomirai area will be transformed into a Star Wars galaxy over Golden Week 2024 to celebrate Star Wars Day on May 4. For fans of the iconic space saga, May 4 is known as Star Wars Day, as the iconic line ‘May the force be with you’ cheekily sounds a lot like ‘May the 4th be with you’.\n\nCelebrations include a host of events and exhibitions that will take place across Minatomirai, at venues such as Landmark Plaza, Mark Is Minato Mirai, the Sky Building, Yokohama City Hall, Grand Mall Park and around Sakuragicho Station.\n\nAt Landmark Plaza, you’ll find an exhibition featuring images of famous scenes from the movies showcased along with music. The plaza will also host a Yoda statue on the third floor as well as posters for all the movies. There'll also be a Star Wars Pop-up Store where you can pick up merch like T-shirts, tote bags, figurines and smartphone accessories.\n\nA special screening of all nine Star Wars movies will be held at the new United Cinemas theatre at Mark Is Minato Mirai from May 3 to May 6. The movies will be in English with Japanese subtitles. Additionally, there will be 3D lego models of iconic Star Wars characters like R2-D2 and BB-8 shown at the Mark Is Minato Mirai Grand Galleria. Want to own your own lightsaber? You'll also be able to pick up a lightsaber-shaped balloon here between May 3 and 5 (from 10am, while stocks last).\n\nHead on over to the Sky Building to catch the special Star Wars: Visions exhibition featuring nine short animations created by renowned Japanese anime illustrators. Along with the animations, there will be a number of special Star Wars items on display, as well as photo spots set up throughout the facility.\n\nAt nearby JR Sakuragicho Station Square, you'll be able to enjoy live music as well as an impressive photo wall featuring visuals from the Star Wars movies and series. An original promotional video will also be shown on a large screen outside Yokohama City Hall.\n\nWant to meet your favourite Star Wars characters? Special character greetings will be taking place at various locations including the Sky Building, Grand Mall Park and Sakuragicho Station between May 3 and 5."
