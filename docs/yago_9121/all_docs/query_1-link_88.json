Director Seijun Suzuki’s onslaught of stylized violence and trippy colors is equal parts Russ Meyer, Samuel Fuller, and Nagisa Oshima—an anything-goes, in-your-face rampage. Tokyo Drifter is a delirious highlight of the brilliantly excessive Japanese cinema of the sixties.\n\nPicture 8/10\n\nCriterion gives Seijun Suzuki’s out-there Yakuza flick Tokyo Drifter a much needed upgrade on Blu-ray, presenting the film in its original aspect ratio of 2.35:1 on this dual-layer disc in a new 1080p/24hz transfer.\n\nThe original DVD from 1999 was a mess; I assume it was a poorly done port from their original Laserdisc edition. It was laced with halos, jitters, pixilation, moiré effects, shimmering, compression artifacts, poor colour rendering, and, to top it all off, an incorrect aspect ratio presentation that squished the image in on the left and right sides, making everything thinner than it should be.\n\nThe Blu-ray, thankfully, improves substantially over all of that. The ratio has been corrected so no one looks like a pillar, colours are more natural and far cleaner, and also much more vibrant, better presenting Suzuki’s style. Other than some mild pixilation noticeable in a few spots noise and other artifacts aren’t an issue, and the image looks far more filmic with better rendering of the film’s grain. The film’s style does hamper it in some ways, like in overall definition which is never all that sharp, coming off like it was filmed just a smidge out-of-focus, which I’m pretty sure was the case. Whites can bloom but again this looks inherent in the film, but colours don’t appear to bleed like they did in the DVD, and the reds look much better, though I noticed a little bit of blocking in the blending between reds and darker colours. The opening sequence is in black and white and contrast has been boosted severely, which is intentional, but you can make out more details easier here than you could with the DVD, which presented black blobs.\n\nThere’s a few minor nicks here and there but in general the source materials are in impressive shape. At last we get the presentation we were hoping for and Criterion has absolved itself of its previous sins.\n\nAudio 5/10\n\nThe lossless PCM mono track also improves upon the DVD’s (which was, not surprisingly, poor itself) but the sound quality is still rough. There’s still an edge to everything and dialogue sounds incredibly distorted in places. Music is also uneven, with a heavy tinny sound, and the title song comes off far more grating because of it.\n\nThe DVD’s track showed all of these same traits though was far more hollow and flat. This track offers a bit of an improvement but I think the overall quality of the source materials is what’s still limiting the presentation.\n\nExtras 4/10\n\nCriterion ports over everything (or I should say, the one thing) from the DVD edition and only adds on a theatrical trailer and a new interview with director Seijun Suzuki and assistant director Masami Kuzuu. Unfortunately this new feature, recorded this past summer, is only 12-minutes long and also feels to have been rushed through; in what could possibly be an ode to the film’s editing style the piece moves from one topic to another without a natural segue, occasionally leaving me wondering how we got to this discussed topic all of a sudden. In the piece we jump back and forth between the two, who were recorded separately, as they cover multiple aspects of the film’s production from the title song to the limited budget and then the studio’s reaction to the film. There’s a bit about the studio system in Japan at the time, or at least what it was like at Nikkatsu, and how they centered on the stars. There’s also a little bit of discussion about the film’s original ending. Suzuki addresses the comments about people calling the film surreal but says ultimately “that’s just how it turned out.” As rushed as it may feel I did enjoy it, though it was sad to see Suzuki in fairly poor health.\n\nCriterion then includes the 20-minute piece that was found on the original DVD edition, which is yet another interview with Seijun Suzuki, which was taken in 1997 during a retrospective of his work. Here Suzuki talks specifically about his work at Nikkatsu and the politics there at the time. He goes over how he was able to get out of directing bad scripts, talks about their tight shooting schedules, the limited budgets, and just the hoops he had to jump through to get films made there. He talks some more about the production of Tokyo Drifter and some of his other films, and again goes over the film’s original ending. Some of the information in here is repeated but it’s still worth watching for the director reflecting on his body of work.\n\nThe booklet then contains an essay by Howard Hampton but Manohla Dargis’ essay from the original DVD didn’t make it over.\n\nThough the supplements are fine in terms of quality there is very little here, only 35-minutes or so worth, 20 of which comes from a previous edition, making this release feel incredibly overpriced (it really only has about 15-minutes more of material in comparison to the 1999 DVD edition and that one was priced at around $30.) In this regard the supplements are a huge letdown.\n\nClosing\n\nThe supplements are slight and because of this the edition feels overpriced at an MSRP of $39.95, but those waiting for a stellar transfer to replace Criterion’s previous eyesore will be very pleased. Despite some minor issues it does look fantastic!\n\nBUY AT:"
