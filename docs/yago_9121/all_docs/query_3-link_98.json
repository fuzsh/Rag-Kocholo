        "text": "Late August is always a good time for dancing in the streets, with many major festivals happening around this time of year. The Yosakoi dance originated in Kochi prefecture in 1954, where it was created to help revitalise the struggling post-war economy. Tokyo's very own Super Yosakoi festival, however, while relatively new, has been going on for over two decades now.\n\nThis massive event sees about 106 teams of brightly attired dancers trying to outdo each other as they strut their stuff to the rhythm of the naruko – a type of clapper that the people of Kochi originally used to scare birds away from the fields.\n\nThe dance performances take place at various locations within the Harajuku/Shibuya area. But if you only see one thing, make sure it’s the massive parade along the tree-lined Omotesando avenue on Sunday from 11.10am to 4.15pm.\n\nStage performances will be held at Yoyogi Park from 10am to 7pm on Saturday and until 5pm on Sunday. There are also smaller parades along the road between NHK Hall and Yoyogi National Gymnasium around the same time.\n\nAt the Yoyogi no Mori Bon-Odori venue (5-68-1 Yoyogi, Shibuya), you can enjoy Yosakoi performances from 11.30am to 4.30pm on Saturday and from 11.00am to 4pm on Sunday.\n\nFor more information, check the event website.\n\nThe amazing Koenji Awa-Odori street dance festival is back on August 24-25, 2024\n\nOne of the most popular street dance festivals in Tokyo, Koenji's Awa-Odori is returning this summer in full swing. This year, the celebration will feature over 150 Awa-Odori dance groups parading around Koenji Station’s North-South shotengai shopping arcade and Konan-dori street over the August 24-25 weekend.\n\nThe tradition of Awa-Odori can be traced back to Tokushima in Shikoku. Legend has it that the local daimyo plied his citizens with booze to celebrate the completion of the local castle in 1586, leading to a citywide outbreak of dancing in the streets. Whatever the accuracy of that tale, the enthusiasm was contagious, and Koenji has been holding a street dance fest of its own since 1957.\n\nWhile the action starts at 5pm, you'll need to arrive much earlier if you want to snag one of the best viewing spots along the two streets mentioned above.\n\nThis lively Roppongi Hills event features traditional Bon Odori dance by yukata-clad performers in a purpose-built arena. So put on your favourite yukata and feel free to join in.\n\nTraditional Japanese lanterns add to the festive atmosphere while the surrounding food stalls cater to hungry crowds. You can expect a varied gourmet selection prepared by popular restaurants in the area, including 37 Steakhouse and Bar, Diya, Rigoletto Bar and Grill, Grand Hyatt Tokyo, Le Chocolat Alain Ducasse, and more. There will also be plenty of activities like yo-yo fishing, ring tossing, and a face mask stall for children and adults to enjoy.\n\nWhile there's no Bon Odori dancing on Friday, you’ll get to watch a modern interpretation of Gigaku (masked drama performance) and Dengaku (traditional Japanese dance) instead. The show is put on by Roppongi Raku, the venue’s performing arts group that consists of about 150 people, starting at 7pm.\n\nOne of Tokyo's favourite traditional festivals, the annual Azabu-Juban Noryo Matsuri (‘noryo’ translates as 'cool of the evening') has been going on for over 50 years now. The festival is returning this year on August 24 and 25 at Patio Juban Square, the nearby Ichinohashi Park and along the streets of the fashionable Azabu-Juban shopping district.\n\nThere will be plenty of dancing, performances and live music, along with food and game stalls, some of which are set up by local businesses. Additionally, the Tokyo Craft Beer Festival will be held concurrently over at Ichinohashi Park, perfect for cooling off with a refreshing pint on a hot summer evening. Dust off your yukata and prepare to mingle among the crowds.\n\nVisit the website for the festival map and programme.\n\nWhile the luxurious Ginza Six has gained a reputation for its art showcase, not many people know that hidden in the shopping centre basement is one of Tokyo’s most elegant noh theatres. And if that includes you, now is the perfect time to get acquainted with this Tokyo attraction and learn more about this traditional Japanese performing art.\n\nHeld at the beautiful Kanze Noh Theatre from August 19 to 25 (2pm-8pm daily), Tokyo Ginza Noh Week seeks to raise awareness of noh among today’s generation. Noh is widely regarded as one of the oldest surviving forms of Japanese theatre, where dance, music and drama combine to enact famous scenes from classic Japanese literature such as the ‘Tale of Genji’. Throughout this special week, you can expect workshops and exhibitions that will enhance your understanding of this classic artform.\n\nThe 45-minute workshop held twice a day at 3pm and 6pm will explain the history of noh as well as the role and meaning of the different masks and costumes. Additionally, there will be acting and vocal training practices for participants who are interested in an experiential way to dive deep into this unique artform. On site you’ll also find an exhibition of costumes and masks that are central to noh theatre – and the best part is, you can try on more than 30 types of noh masks at the dedicated booths.\n\nThe workshops offer simultaneous English translation and are limited to the first 400 participants per session. Tickets (¥500, cash only) are sold at the venue prior to each session ​​(free for individuals 15 years old and below).\n\nThe Tokyo Metropolitan Government No. 1 Building in Shinjuku now serves as the backdrop for a jaw-dropping and record-breaking projection mapping show. Covering an area of a whopping 13,905sqm, the after-dark spectacle has been certified by Guinness World Records as the largest permanent display of its kind in the world.\n\nThe nightly showcase features a range of visual wonders created by a mix of local and international artists. Some shows are inspired by Tokyo's rich history, while others draw on themes like the lunar cycle.\n\nCurrently, on weeknights, you can catch ‘Evolution’, ‘Lunar Cycle’, 'Synergy', 'Poetic Structures' and 'Golden Fortune'. Additionally, there’s a new show that's just been introduced called ‘Butai ni tatte’, which is synchronised to a song by hit Japanese pop duo Yoasobi. On weekends, you can look forward to a showcase featuring 'Godzilla: Attack on Tokyo!', the aforementioned ‘Butai ni tatte (Yoasobi)’ as well as ‘Tokyo Concerto', a display featuring Tokyo attractions alongside music.\n\nShows take place every night from 7.30pm to 9.45pm. For more details and to check the full programme of daily projection mapping shows, visit here.\n\nFeel the breeze of 1,000 windmills at Tokyo Midtown Hibiya’s annual outdoor summer fest. This picturesque event features a large dome adorned with over a thousand colourful windmills made from unused clear files from the shopping centre’s tenants. Come evening, the dome as well as the staircase at the plaza are lit up with blue and white lights, while cooling mist envelopes the area to create a mesmerising sight.\n\nMore importantly, the summer festival is hosting several Japanese performances at the open-air stage in Hibiya Step Square. Don’t miss the Iwami Kagura dance-theatre from Shimane Prefecture on August 10 as well as the other regional dance performances such as Tokushima Awa Odori (August 11), Kagoshima Ohara (August 12), Okinawa Eisa (August 17) and Hokkaido Soran (August 18). The above-mentioned performances will be held twice a day at 3pm and 5pm.\n\nTokyo Midtown has a packed programme of summer fun this year. If you want to take it easy, cool down at Midtown Garden’s Ashimizu area. The gentle stream here has been transformed into a foot bath, open between 3pm and 9pm (closed on Tuesdays). It can accommodate up to 70 people at a time and best of all, it’s free. Towels are available at ¥100 each, but of course, you can always bring your own.\n\nAt the adjacent outdoor Midpark Lounge (5pm-10pm; Sat, Sun and hols 12noon-10pm), you can enjoy casual meals like buttermilk fried chicken, summer vegetable and seafood curry, and vegan cob salad, as well as sweet treats like fruity panna cotta and Basque cheesecake. The drink menu, on the other hand, offers a selection of cooling refreshments such as yuzu gin and tonic, green tea gin and ice cream soda. There are tables and seats for 120 people.\n\nStudio Ghibli fans can get a rare behind-the-scenes look at the making of the anime powerhouse’s much-loved films, and of its own Ghibli Park theme park, at this travelling exhibition that hits Tokyo on June 28. The event’s three-month Tokyo run, ending September 23, is the finale of a two-year roam around Japan that has included a stop in Aichi prefecture, home to Ghibli Park.\n\nThree vast halls of Warehouse Terrada, in the waterfront Tennozu district, will house a wealth of exhibits that range from initial sketches by Goro Miyazaki and models used in the production process, to life-size recreations of scenes from some of Ghibli’s most popular productions. These include the train carriage from ‘Spirited Away’, in which you can put yourself in the position of protagonist Chihiro by taking a seat next to the mysterious Kaonashi (aka ‘No Face’). Elsewhere, Catbus from ‘My Neighbor Totoro’ looms large.\n\nFor the event’s duration, an adjacent floating restaurant will bring some of the retro vibes that pervade Ghibli productions, and serve up dishes including napolitan (ketchup spaghetti) and ramen.\n\nTokyo Tower's alternative to the ubiquitous summer beer gardens is welcoming the outdoor drinking season with a double dose of whisky highballs. Head to the terrace at the base of the tower for a lengthy menu of highballs combined with a variety of drinking snacks (think karaage and grilled bacon).\n\nThere's also a meatier option on the roof of the Tower Foot Town building. The Tokyo Tower Rooftop Highball Garden serves up all-you-can-eat jingisukan, the Hokkaido-born lamb barbecue named after the Mongol warlord Genghis Khan.\n\nTwo hours of all-you-can-drink alcohol and limitless jingisukan can be had for ¥5,800 (teens aged 13-19 ¥3,800, primary school students ¥2,800, children aged 4-6 ¥1,800, all with non-alcoholic drinks, of course).\n\nThe Tokyo Tower Cho-Ten Highball Garden at the base of the tower is open until October 6, from 4pm-10pm on weekdays and 12noon-10pm on Sat, Sun & holidays.\n\nThe Tokyo Tower Rooftop Highball Garden is open until October 14, from 5pm-9.30pm daily. Make your reservations here.\n\nTokyo Skytree is getting a Pokémon-themed makeover for summer. From now until September 24, the 634m-tall tower will be illuminated in colours inspired by popular Pokémon.\n\nAt one of its observation decks, the 450m-high Tembo Galleria, you’ll find photo spots featuring Captain Pikachu and friends. Avid fans will be delighted with the special Pokémon-themed menu at the lower observation deck’s Skytree Café. There’s a cute fruit parfait (¥1,400) with three ice cream flavours plus a Pokéball biscuit. And if you get the special kiwi-melon soda or the ginger mango soda with Pokémon illustrations (¥1,000 each), you can then order the mystery cupcake as a dessert set, which will come decorated with one of six Pokémon picks.\n\nTo make the most of your visit, be sure to stay until sundown and catch screenings of Pokémon anime. The evening shows are projected onto the observatory windows at the Skytree Round Theater. This will surely make the Tokyo skyline look even more mesmerising. Each screening runs for six minutes, with shows at 7.30pm, 8.15pm and 9pm daily.\n\nIn teamLab's new pop-up exhibition in collaboration with the Galaxy store in Harajuku, the digital art collective's enchanted forest has been transformed into an underwater fantasy. This latest installation is also an interactive one, where visitors can use smartphones to catch, study and release the colourful sea creatures they encounter in the space. There's a great variety of marine animals to see, including fish like tuna as well as aquatic creatures that are endangered or extinct.\n\nTo catch a creature to study it, you can use the designated app on a Galaxy smartphone to scan fish swimming in the space, or throw out a 'Study Net' towards the floor if you see something interesting darting around your feet.\n\nEach session is an hour-long, with daily exhibitions open from 11am until 7pm.\n\nNote: an end date for this exhibition has yet to be announced.\n\nBorn in Tokyo in 1936, Keiichi Tanaami is a pioneer of pop art in Japan. Though his ultra-vivid, cartoon-esque creations in assorted media have long been widely acclaimed, and exhibited at such major institutions as the Art Institute of Chicago and London’s Tate Modern, right now Tanaami’s profile is higher than ever. The still-active veteran is currently represented by hip Tokyo gallery Nanzuka, he collaborates with the likes of Adidas and Yohji Yamamoto, and his work is undergoing a major positive reappraisal by the art world’s tastemakers.\n\nTanaami’s late-career surge in popularity is crowned by his first major career retrospective, taking place at one of his home city’s most prestigious art museums. Across the venue’s expansive galleries, consistently retina-popping work traces the artist’s progression from commercial designer – he was the first art director of Playboy magazine’s Japanese edition – to a leading figure in the country’s underground art scene.\n\nAcross paintings, collages, installations, sculptures, film, animation and more, Tanaami’s work shares a degree of spirit with Western pop artists. Simultaneously evident, though, is a visceral understanding of Japan’s unique wartime and postwar history, derived from the artist’s lived experience. The 1967 screen print ‘No More War 1’ echoes the pacifist sentiment of many young Japanese in that era, while ‘Drama of Death and Rebirth’, a 2019 canvas, is a psychedelic hellscape punctuated by fire from US fighter planes. Bringing things right up to date is Tanaami’s 2024 work for Japanese rock band Radwimps.\n\nYayoi Kusama is celebrated worldwide for her abstract paintings and objects that feature repetitive rendering of a single motif: most famously those iconic polka-dotted pumpkins. The very beginnings of her artistic journey, however, saw Kusama pursue accurate and finely detailed depictions of animals, plants and familiar everyday items. As this exhibition reveals, these fledgeling works nonetheless contain the seeds of Kusama’s later practice of translating her visions and inner perceptions into figurative, abstract forms.\n\nWorks featured here, spanning the 1940s through to the present, include sketches and traditional Japanese paintings that predate Kusama’s career-shaping 1957 relocation to the United States. There are also collages that the artist worked on intensively from the 1970s to the 1990s, and prints representative of those she has been producing prolifically since 1979.\n\nDocumenting the later decades of this ongoing artistic journey, meanwhile, are 21st-century paintings characterised by figurative images, such as eyes repeated to fill the entire canvas. Finally, the artist’s three-dimensional work is represented by an infinity room installation originally created to mark this museum’s inauguration, along with the world premiere of a soft sculpture-covered boat which embodies a concept Kusama first explored in the 1960s.\n\nNote that tickets are not available at the door; they must be purchased in advance online.\n\nThe exhibition is closed on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays (except July 15, Aug 12).\n\nItalian luxury house Gucci celebrates its 60 years in Japan with this special exhibition of bags transformed into one-off collectibles by revered Japanese artists and artisans. Photographer Daido Moriyama, ceramicist Hirotsune Nakazato and contemporary painter Yui Yaegashi are among the diverse talents who have turned their hands to reinterpreting the label’s iconic Bamboo 1947 handbag.\n\nThis coveted item has a historic connection with Japan, beyond the country long being one of Gucci’s biggest markets. With high-quality materials being difficult to obtain in the years immediately following World War II, Gucci hit upon the idea of using processed Japanese bamboo for bag handles, and what is now known as the Bamboo 1947 bag was born.\n\nFor this special art project, a dedicated Gucci archivist selected 60 outstanding vintage examples of the Bamboo 1947, each to be utilised as a ‘base’ for creative remodelling. The results connect the creativity of Japanese artists and craftspeople with the skills of the Italian artisans who originally produced these handbags. For devoted (and wealthy) fashionistas, the exhibited creations are available to purchase.\n\nThough it was Beatles legend Paul McCartney’s former wife, Linda McCartney, who was the acclaimed photographer in that marriage, a recently rediscovered cache of photos shot during The Beatles’ rise to fame demonstrates that Sir Paul himself was a talented cameraman. This exhibition, comprising over 250 of these archive images, documents life from the insider perspective of one of the four members of this band that shook the world. To this day, this band is still especially loved in Japan. Following runs at London’s National Portrait Gallery and NYC’s Brooklyn Museum, the show touches down at this sky-high Roppongi venue.\n\nVideo clips and archival materials set the scene for these photos shot by McCartney over three-month spanning late 1963 and early 1964: a key period in The Beatles’ career, as they developed from a phenomenon in Britain into a global success that incited ‘Beatlemania’ wherever they travelled. The candidness of the all-monochrome images, in which fellow band members John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr loom large, evokes the feeling of a family album full of once-in-a-lifetime memories.\n\nTatsuya Tanaka has been wowing Instagram since 2011 with images of his astonishingly detailed miniature models, which depict scenarios ranging from the slightly off-kilter – tiny human figures interacting with regular life-size objects – to the outlandishly surreal. In one work, ‘trains’ formed of sushi rolls, hotdogs, pencil cases and strawberry cakes simultaneously pull into a railway station.\n\nThis exhibition at Nihonbashi’s Takashimaya department store is a triumphant homecoming for Tanaka and his minuscule marvels. ‘Miniature Life, Mitate Mind’ recently completed its premiere run over in Seoul, where it attracted over 90,000 visitors in the space of two months. Around 160 miniature works, all being exhibited in Japan for the very first time, are divided into seven zones taking the themes of ‘Home’, ‘Form’, ‘Colour’, ‘Scale’, ‘Motion’, ‘Life’ and ‘World’.\n\nOne standout piece wittily evokes the work of Swedish-American artist Claes Oldenburg (1929-2022), which included everyday objects such as spoons and wood saws rendered way, way larger than life size. In this Tanaka work, visitors in a miniature art gallery marvel at sellotape dispensers and other stationery items that are to them similarly oversized, yet of standard dimensions in our own eyes.\n\nAll of the works may be photographed, giving you the sense of being a colossal giant behind the lens. Better yet, there are dedicated photo spots that allow you to pose beside large-scale works that, when photographed, will reduce you to the size of one of Tanaka’s tiny human figures.\n\nThe exhibition is closed on Aug 21.\n\nAlexander Calder (1898-1976) is considered one of the most important artists of the 20th century, primarily for works that revolutionised modern conceptions of sculpture. This US-born artist fused artistic sensibility with his engineering training to invent the kinetic abstract mobile: the kind of moving sculpture with which he is most closely associated.\n\nCalder’s dynamic metal-based creations loom magnificently large at what is the artist’s first Tokyo solo exhibition in almost 35 years, alongside static sculptures dubbed ‘stabiles’, as well as oil paintings and works on paper. ’Calder: Un effet du japonais’ explores, via around 100 pieces, the enduring resonance that this modernist artist’s work has with Japanese aesthetics and traditions. Though Calder never travelled to Japan, and avoided explaining the inspirations and concepts behind his work, a Japanese-style sensibility is perceptible in pieces such as 1963’s ‘The Pagoda’, a 10ft-high stabile featured here.\n\nOther highlights reveal how Calder’s mobiles and stabiles embraced the extremes of stark all-black rendering on the one hand and pops of primary colours on the other. ‘Black Beast’ (1940) is a 14ft wide and 9ft tall stabile with a foreboding air, while ‘Untitled’ (1956) is a hanging mobile whose arrangement of leaf-like sheet-metal shapes demonstrates the artist’s pursuit of what he called ‘disparity’, over symmetry. The latter work is also a great example of how Calder’s mobiles can appear subtly different with each viewing, thanks to their multiple moving elements.\n\nA special touch to this exhibition is given by the spatial design, which combines geometric principles favoured by Calder with references to modern Japanese architecture and materials.\n\nThe exhibition is closed on June 4, as well as July 2 and Aug 6.\n\nThis debut Japanese solo show from Chicago-born Theaster Gates takes place at one of Tokyo’s most prestigious art venues. Gates’s rise to prominence is very much part of the art world’s increasing recognition of the voices of African-American and other non-white communities. A truly multi-disciplinary creative – focused primarily on sculpture and ceramics but also working in architecture, music, performance, fashion and design – Gates strives to preserve and promote Black culture via projects as large as a Chicago initiative that has transformed over 40 abandoned buildings into public art spaces.\n\nAlso key to Gates’s vision, and a central theme of this show, is the influence that Japanese cultural and craft traditions have had on the artist over the past two decades. From initially travelling to Japan in 2004 to study ceramics, encounters and explorations over the subsequent decades have led Gates to formulate 'Afro-Mingei'. This is a creative ideology inspired by Gates’s identification of a spirit of resistance shared by Afro-American culture and Japan’s Mingei folk crafts movement. It imagines Black aesthetics and Japanese craft philosophies coming together in our globalised era to form a future hybrid culture.\n\nThis exhibition explores the Afro-Mingei concept through installations including a revolving, mirror-surfaced 'iceberg' that pays homage to Chicago house music, and an endlessly reverberating church organ. There are also works utilising materials as disparate as Japanese incense and firefighters’ hoses, ceramics and sculptures from both Gates and fellow US and Japanese artists, and much more.\n\nThe exhibition closes early at 5pm on Tuesday (except August 13).\n\nThe debut Tokyo solo show from Los Angeles-based artist, filmmaker and writer Miranda July is one that is pertinent to our social media-fixated times. F.A.M.I.L.Y. (the initials standing for ‘Falling Apart Meanwhile I Love You’), taking place at luxury house Prada’s landmark Aoyama building, is an Instagram-facilitated video installation born from the artist’s favoured method of initiating exchanges that she controls to some degree, while simultaneously inviting her counterpart in the dialogue to express desires and perform actions. An array of screens span a section of the Herzog & de Meuron-designed flagship store, showing the results of a year-long artistic experiment in which July collaborated with seven complete strangers via Instagram. The artist sent these individuals a series of prompts, with their subsequent video responses then manipulated in her studio using the basic ‘cut-out’ tool of a social media video editing app. These surreal performances see July and her participants together explore intimacy and personal boundaries through a new form of physical language, with the artist hoping the project might achieve what she sees as one of the promises of Instagram: that the user is looked at so lovingly that they finally ‘feel okay’.\n\nLate August is always a good time for dancing in the streets, with many major festivals happening around this time of year. The Yosakoi dance originated in Kochi prefecture in 1954, where it was created to help revitalise the struggling post-war economy. Tokyo's very own Super Yosakoi festival, however, while relatively new, has been going on for over two decades now. This massive event sees about 106 teams of brightly attired dancers trying to outdo each other as they strut their stuff to the rhythm of the naruko – a type of clapper that the people of Kochi originally used to scare birds away from the fields. The dance performances take place at various locations within the Harajuku/Shibuya area. But if you only see one thing, make sure it’s the massive parade along the tree-lined Omotesando avenue on Sunday from 11.10am to 4.15pm. Stage performances will be held at Yoyogi Park from 10am to 7pm on Saturday and until 5pm on Sunday. There are also smaller parades along the road between NHK Hall and Yoyogi National Gymnasium around the same time. At the Yoyogi no Mori Bon-Odori venue (5-68-1 Yoyogi, Shibuya), you can enjoy Yosakoi performances from 11.30am to 4.30pm on Saturday and from 11.00am to 4pm on Sunday. For more information, check the event website.\n\nIn teamLab's new pop-up exhibition in collaboration with the Galaxy store in Harajuku, the digital art collective's enchanted forest has been transformed into an underwater fantasy. This latest installation is also an interactive one, where visitors can use smartphones to catch, study and release the colourful sea creatures they encounter in the space. There's a great variety of marine animals to see, including fish like tuna as well as aquatic creatures that are endangered or extinct. To catch a creature to study it, you can use the designated app on a Galaxy smartphone to scan fish swimming in the space, or throw out a 'Study Net' towards the floor if you see something interesting darting around your feet. Each session is an hour-long, with daily exhibitions open from 11am until 7pm. Note: an end date for this exhibition has yet to be announced.\n\nOne of Tokyo's favourite traditional festivals, the annual Azabu-Juban Noryo Matsuri (‘noryo’ translates as 'cool of the evening') has been going on for over 50 years now. The festival is returning this year on August 24 and 25 at Patio Juban Square, the nearby Ichinohashi Park and along the streets of the fashionable Azabu-Juban shopping district. There will be plenty of dancing, performances and live music, along with food and game stalls, some of which are set up by local businesses. Additionally, the Tokyo Craft Beer Festival will be held concurrently over at Ichinohashi Park, perfect for cooling off with a refreshing pint on a hot summer evening. Dust off your yukata and prepare to mingle among the crowds. Visit the website for the festival map and programme.\n\nThis lively Roppongi Hills event features traditional Bon Odori dance by yukata-clad performers in a purpose-built arena. So put on your favourite yukata and feel free to join in. Traditional Japanese lanterns add to the festive atmosphere while the surrounding food stalls cater to hungry crowds. You can expect a varied gourmet selection prepared by popular restaurants in the area, including 37 Steakhouse and Bar, Diya, Rigoletto Bar and Grill, Grand Hyatt Tokyo, Le Chocolat Alain Ducasse, and more. There will also be plenty of activities like yo-yo fishing, ring tossing, and a face mask stall for children and adults to enjoy. While there's no Bon Odori dancing on Friday, you’ll get to watch a modern interpretation of Gigaku (masked drama performance) and Dengaku (traditional Japanese dance) instead. The show is put on by Roppongi Raku, the venue’s performing arts group that consists of about 150 people, starting at 7pm."
