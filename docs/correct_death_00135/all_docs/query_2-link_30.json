        "text": "I’m always somewhat surprised to discover how many of the writers and thinkers I’ve admired over the years grew up reading Eugene O’Neill with a passion equal to my own. For years, I thought of O’Neill, who spoke so deeply to my adolescent self, as a kind of private pleasure. So I experienced something of a jolt when, in 2006, Joan Didion told me, during an interview, that as a girl she’d read all O’Neill’s works in one summer, captivated by his theatricality. Mike Nichols, in a 2016 PBS “American Masters” program, described how much O’Neill meant to him, too. What impressed me, as I watched Didion’s and Nichols’s eyes light up at the thought of those maddening sexist, racist, restless, complicated, and important dramas, was how little either of them had in common stylistically with O’Neill’s raw imperfections. And yet they responded to his narratives in their souls, as did I. O’Neill’s words made me feel that working with your imagination was a noble calling somehow, and that any kind of story could work onstage if you strongly believed it belonged there. Even when reading his mystifyingly bad works, such as “The Fountain” (written 1921-22) or “Lazarus Laughed” (1926) or “Dynamo” (1928), I was in O’Neill’s corner, fascinated by the way he illuminated his invented worlds with hysteria.\n\nOf course, my interest in the art was inseparable from my interest in the artist—that melancholy boy with Black Irish looks, who grew up in a drama of his own. His father, James, was the headliner, a ham actor, whose matinée-idol posturing and self-delusion prompted his brilliant son to run away and cook up a new kind of realism—fuelled by European-influenced ideas about angst and hopped up on the American vernacular. And then there was the high drama that his mother, Mary Ellen, a morphine addict, indulged in. O’Neill’s beloved older brother, James, Jr., or Jamie, inherited both forms of helplessness. An alcoholic sometime actor, he died in 1923, at the age of forty-five, but his depression, his wry humor, and his anguished relationship with his mother live on in a number of O’Neill’s characters, including James Tyrone, Jr., in “A Moon for the Misbegotten” (1941-43) and “Long Day’s Journey Into Night” (1941-42).\n\nIn 1942, while working on those masterpieces, O’Neill also wrote his last one-act play, “Hughie” (in revival at the Booth, under the noteworthy direction of Michael Grandage). It was a period of personal turmoil. The playwright was fifty-three; his career was in decline. (From 1934 to 1946, O’Neill had no new plays produced.) In the midst of the war, writing seemed to him a trivial activity, the commercial theatre meaningless. More or less estranged from his children—he had no real gift for intimacy, just a near-obsessive drive to be close to women he’d rejected or who’d rejected him—O’Neill was also beginning to show signs of the brain disorder that led to his death, in 1953, at sixty-five. Nevertheless, “Hughie” signalled an upswing in his artistic life. This hour-long song was intended to be one in a series of eight one-act plays, titled “By Way of Obit,” in each of which a character would tell another about someone who had died. “Via this monologue, you get a complete picture of the person who has died—his or her whole life story—but just as complete a picture of . . . the narrator,” O’Neill said. “And you also get, by another means—use of stage directions, mostly—an insight into the whole life of the person who does little but listen.”\n\nAnd listen the Night Clerk does—even before Erie Smith (Forest Whitaker) enters and starts talking about Hughie, who preceded the Night Clerk in his job. Sitting on a stool, facing the audience, the Night Clerk (played by Frank Wood, who is immense in a constricted part) “stares acquiescently at nothing” and listens. We hear what he seems to be listening to, not for: the car horns and footfalls of midtown Manhattan in 1928. It’s approaching 4 A.M., what James Baldwin called the “devastating hour”: the day “is indisputably over; almost instantaneously, a new day begins, and how will one bear it?” The Night Clerk bears it by letting sound, atmosphere, time run through him like sand through an hourglass.\n\nErie bears it in another way. Our first sight of him tells us everything, or everything he wants his audience to know, which is how he treats the world—as spectators, potential pals he needs to win over in order to feel right in his mind. Entering through a heavy door, upstage center, Erie is tall, with rounded shoulders and a slightly shambling walk; he looks as though he were caving in on himself while trying to remain upright, spiritually and otherwise. We recognize him, or ourselves, in his effort to be sprightly, upbeat—to make life something other than what it is—even, or especially, in places like this dark, sad hotel lobby, which might as well be on the edge of the world. (Christopher Oram and Neil Austin, who have done a mighty job with the set and the lighting, respectively, have made the lobby look like a way station, the next-to-last stop before the elevator to the gallows.)\n\nCatching sight of the new Night Clerk, Erie smiles a broader smile—it’s part of his mask—and introduces himself. He’s been on a drunk precipitated by Hughie’s death, he says. Now the alcohol is wearing off, and perhaps reality is settling in just a little, and Erie stands at the center of what “Hughie” is about (in addition to O’Neill’s nostalgia for the slang of the era): how you can be held captive by the guilt you feel at being alive. In any case, Erie is delighted that the hotel has replaced the “young squirt they took on when Hughie got sick. One of them fresh wise punks. Couldn’t tell him nothing.” It’s probably fair to assume that that clerk put up a wall against Erie’s verbiage, and that Erie didn’t take the rejection well. Now he’s been given another chance to talk, to win a guy over and maybe love him, just as he loved Hughie, who was his anchor in a sea of booze and loneliness. When the Night Clerk mentions that his last name is Hughes—as was Hughie’s—Erie gets excited, but then the Night Clerk points out that they weren’t related. “No, that’s right,” Erie replies. He continues:\n\nHughie told me he didn’t have no relations left—except his wife and kids, of course. Yeah. The poor guy croaked last week. His funeral was what started me off on a bat. Some drunk! I don’t go on one often. It’s bum dope in my book. A guy gets careless and gabs about things he knows and when he comes to he’s liable to find there’s guys who’d feel easier if he wasn’t around no more. That’s the trouble with knowing things.\n\nThat last sentence, such an honest response to one’s own consciousness, slays us in the way that only O’Neill can; its subjectivity, its credibility remake the world for us, framing it with a proscenium and peopling it with Whitaker and Wood. Together and separately, they’re more than fine actors; they’re poets equal to O’Neill’s poeticism. But this appreciation may be delayed. In fact, I wasn’t sure what I thought of the show until a few days after I’d seen it. Perhaps, while watching, I was on guard against the possibility of O’Neill’s occasional mawkishness interfacing with Whitaker’s. But later, closing my eyes, I remembered Whitaker’s light-colored suit and his gracefulness, which works in counterpoint to his outsized frame. For years, I didn’t respond to Whitaker as much as I wanted to. In film after film, he played what I called Negro yearning: he was always on the outside looking in, especially at love. At times, this stance felt to me like special pleading. And I wasn’t sure about his authenticity. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Whitaker didn’t eschew sentimentality; in fact, he often hid behind it. Neil Jordan tempered that tendency in “The Crying Game” (1992), not by casting Whitaker against type but by making his type—his sensitivity and awkwardness—seem sexy to his transsexual partner. In “Panic Room” (2002), David Fincher revealed how attractive Whitaker could be when his performance as a thug had hints of melancholia and tenderheartedness without being subsumed by them. But in other films, such as “A Rage in Harlem” (1991) and “Bird” (1988), in which he starred as the jazz legend Charlie Parker, there was too much hazy nostalgia for Whitaker’s softness to sink into. He was a junkie Teddy bear. Grandage, like Jordan and Fincher, emphasizes what’s most interesting about Whitaker—his emotional accessibility, his curiosity about his own pain and that of the society that surrounds him—but he doesn’t make Erie a nostalgic figure. There’s critical distance here; Erie is a white character played by a black man, and the complications inherent in that casting keep the production contemporary and important.\n\nNothing significant happens in “Hughie” except theatre—and the creative lives of its actors. As Erie stands beside his new hope, the Night Clerk, while bent low, internally, by grief, Whitaker may remind you of Charles Laughton, another actor who was uncertain in his body and made a style out of trying to mask it, too. ♦"
