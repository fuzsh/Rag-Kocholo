        "text": "TEXT AND IMAGES: Birth and early years\n\nUntil he came to Tao House in California, America’s groundbreaking playwright had been a wanderer. Eugene O’Neill was born in New York City on October 16,1888, the son of James O’Neill, an actor who, like other major stars of the time, spent his life on extended tours of the country. The young O’Neill was raised in hotel rooms and the wings of theatres. As he grew older, Eugene was sent to Catholic boarding schools and to Princeton University. His growing realization that his father’s considerable talent had been cheapened by repeated performances of the melodrama The Count of Monte Cristo, and his shocked discovery that his mother was addicted to the morphine prescribed for her painful recovery from Eugene’s birth, were realities too great for the young man to endure. He ran from them.\n\nCaption:\n\nO’Neill’s parents Mary Ellen Quinlan O’Neill and James O’Neill.

He tried to escape by drinking and for a time lived in a flophouse on the Manhattan waterfront. Once he attempted suicide, and in 1912, when he was 24, he fell ill with tuberculosis. In the sanatorium, for the first time, he was forced to pause.\n\nHis illness was quickly arrested, but during his convalescence he began to write plays, testing himself in the theatrical world he had long watched from the wings. In the summer of 1916 at Provincetown, Mass., he fell in with a group of amateur actors who staged his short play about the sea, Bound East for Cardiff.\n\nCaption:\n\nO’Neill, left, en route to Honduras in 1909 to prospect for gold.\n\nCredit:\n\nBeinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University\n\nDescription:\n\nA black and white photo of two well dressed young men standing on the deck of a ship looking into the camera.

Both structures are on a large platform supported by many wooden pilings underneath. These buildings are over the water, though near the shore. In the foreground of the photo, at the bottom right, a large dory is seen pulled ashore.\n\n↑ back to top\n\nTEXT: Success as a Pulitzer Winner\n\nHis playwriting ambitions were affirmed by its success. Critical and popular acclaim followed rapidly. In 1920 he received the first of his four Pulitzer Prizes for the tragedy Beyond the Horizon, a play that combined the real and the poetic in a way that Broadway playgoers had not seen. Two years later the tragi¬comic ”Anna Christie” won his second Pulitzer Prize.\n\nO’Neill rapidly became known as America’s most exciting dramatist. Actors and scenic designers were taxed by the demands of his imagination, but he was no less demanding of himself. The scope of his plays is wide: Marco Polo’s voyage to China (Marco Millions, 1928); a play of contemporary life using masks in the Greek manner (The Great God Brown, 1926); a nine-act drama in which the characters speak their thoughts aloud (Strange Interlude, 1928, for which he won his third Pulitzer Prize); and a gentle comedy about young love in early-1900s New England (Ah, Wilderness!, 1933). By the time he came to California in 1936, 35 of his plays had been produced. Counting those that remained incomplete or had been destroyed, he had written nearly 60 plays.\n\n↑ back to top\n\nTEXT: His Nobel Prize for Literature\n\nBy 1936, with no clear idea of when or how it would be produced, O’Neill had begun work on a cycle of 11 plays about the history of an American family. Its theme was announced in its title, A Tale of Possessors, Self-Dispossessed. He often had to work on several plays simultaneously, and he craved isolation so his focus on the ambitious project could be undisturbed. In 1936 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. With the stipend, he and his wife Carlotta were able to build the house he came to call his “final home and harbor,” Tao House.\n\n↑ back to top\n\nTEXT: Susan Glaspell Quote\n\n“The sea has been good to Eugene O’Neill. It was there for his opening. There was a fog, just as the script demanded, fog bell in the harbor. The tide was in, and it washed under us and around, spraying through the holes in the floor, giving us the rhythm and flavor of the sea . . . .”\n\n—Susan Glaspell, of the Provincetown Players\n\n↑ back to top\n\nIMAGE: Tao House\n\nCaption:\n\n“I have never had a home, never had a chance to establish roots.

It has the appearance of an adobe with two visible chimneys, dark terra-cotta roof tiles and reddish-brown shutters. Red tiles cover the porch area on the ground level underneath the windows. The area around the house has some landscaping bushes and small conifer trees, with one large leaved tree standing alone in the middle of the photograph. In the foreground is a large stone birdbath fountain.\n\n↑ back to top\n\nTEXT: O'Neill's Later Years\n\nDuring the early years in California, he worked single-mindedly, at times almost desperately, on the historical cycle. But he was plagued with health problems, and the overwhelming task he had set himself was draining him of energy and spirit. After completing A Touch of the Poet he shelved the cycle (he burned two of the plays before leaving Tao House) and in rapid succession wrote the autobiographical plays that rank among the highest achievements of the English-speaking theatre: The Iceman Cometh, Hughie, A Moon For The Misbegotten, and Long Day’s Journey Into Night. For the last play, he received his fourth Pulitzer, awarded posthumously following the New York premier in 1956.\n\nHe never completed another play after 1943. A worsening tremor in his hands slowly robbed him of the ability to write, and he found himself blocked when he couldn’t set pencil to paper. With the coming of the war, servants were unavailable, and neither of the O’Neills could drive. Suffering from a rare degenerative disease, O’Neill had to leave his sanctuary and once again move on. In a hotel room in Boston he destroyed the drafts and notes for his unfinished plays. Carlotta said it was like “tearing up children.” Effectively silenced by illness, O’Neill died there in 1953.\n\n↑ back to top\n\nIMAGE: Eugene O'Neill playing a piano\n\nCaption:\n\nRight: Giving one of his rare smiles, O’Neill relaxes at his cherished “Rosie,” an old player piano reputedly from a New Orleans bordello.\n\nCredit:\n\nBeinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University\n\nDescription:\n\nIn this black and white photo, Eugene O'Neill is sitting at an old upright piano with stained glass in it's face. His hands are on the keys and he is smiling turning to the camera. He is wearing a white shirt and dark striped tie and a sweater with light pants.\n\n↑ back to top\n\nTEXT: Reasons Why O'Neill Purchased Tao House\n\nOf all the places Eugene O’Neill called home during his restless life, Tao House was the one that held him longest, the refuge where he wrote his last plays. In early 1937 he and Carlotta were living in a San Francisco hotel. “No roots. No home,” Carlotta wrote as they searched for a place to live. Drawn to the privacy and climate of the San Ramon Valley, they purchased a 158-acre ranch near Danville and planned what O’Neill hoped would be his final home.\n\n↑ back to top\n\nTEXT: Asian Cultures and Religions that inspired the Interior Design of Tao House\n\nO’Neill’s interest in Eastern thought and Carlotta’s passion for Oriental art and decor inspired the name Tao House. Taoism is one of the great religious traditions of China. “Tao” (pronounced dow), generally translated as “The Way,” is the term given to the primal reality that gives birth to the visible world. O’Neill was aware of Taoist concepts, some of which paralleled his own dramatic ideas. The sea symbolized for him the “impelling, inscrutable forces behind life which it is my ambition to at least faintly shadow . . . in my plays.”\n\nWhile O’Neill wrote, Carlotta channeled her own creative energy into the house. Combining a Spanish colonial exterior of adobe-like blocks with an interior of deep blue ceilings and red doors, tiled or black-stained floors, and Chinese furniture, she called it her “pseudo-Chinese house.” Because Carlotta’s eyes were overly sensitive to light, most of the shades were kept drawn. The darkness and the ghostly images reflected by colored mirrors created a shadowy, enclosed atmosphere that unsettled some visitors.\n\n↑ back to top\n\nTEXT: The O'Neills Life at Tao House\n\nThough the O’Neills rarely spent a night away from Tao House and Carlotta often kept people at arm’s length, especially when the “Master,” as she called him, was at work, the couple was far from reclusive. They were visited by relatives, friends, and O’Neill’s old theatre colleagues. O’Neill enjoyed gardening and attending football games, where the intensely private man relished a rare anonymity in the crowd. His health permitting, though, he mostly immersed himself in his plays, working on several at a time. Shut away by thick walls and three doors leading to his study, Carlotta ensuring that his isolation was undisturbed, his creative energy flowed unchecked for days, even weeks at a stretch. He rose early and usually worked uninterrupted from early morning to about 1 pm. After lunch he generally napped, swam in the pool, or walked with Carlotta, though sometimes he worked without break into the night. He also devoted time to his dog Blemie, something of a surrogate child for the couple. In the evenings they usually read or listened to their collection of jazz and blues records.\n\n↑ back to top\n\nTEXT: The Reasons Why O’Neill Seldom Left Tao House\n\nWhile he was at Tao House, O’Neill refused requests to produce the plays he wrote there. He wanted to complete five of the cycle plays first, and he did not want the others staged until the war was over. During his years there he turned his back on the “show shop,” his jaundiced term for the theatre world, giving himself to “soul-grinding” work on the cycle and transforming his past into the autobiographical plays that made him America’s most important playwright.\n\n↑ back to top\n\nIMAGE: Eugene and Carlotta O'Neill reading\n\nCaption:\n\nRight: Eugene and Carlotta O’Neill spent most evenings reading. The private couple led a quiet life in the cool, dark rooms of Tao House.\n\nCredit:\n\nBeinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University\n\nDescription:\n\nOn the left side of this black and white photo is Eugene O'Neill sitting on a couch. He is in a living room. Behind him is a mirror reflecting the image of the lamp and cabinet beside him. He is reading a book in his lap. He is wearing a tie and grey pin-strip suit. His legs are crossed. In front of him is a coffee table with a pile of books on it.\n\nIn the center of the photo Carlotta O'Neill is sitting in a chair, reading a large magazine in her lap. She has short dark hair and is wearing a polka dot dress with a white collar. The large Asian rug beneath her has many intricate designs on it with a short striped boarder. Behind Carlotta is a bookcase filled with books. To the left of the bookcase is a dark wood cabinet with painted designs. A short carved dark wooden stool is beneath the bookcase, and a tall two section Chinese wooden screen with porcelain inlays of drawings is to the right of the bookcase.\n\n↑ back to top\n\nTEXT AND IMAGE: Eugene O’Neill quote\n\nCaption:\n\n“This is a final home and harbor for me.”\n\nCredit:\n\nBeinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University\n\nDescription:\n\nIn this black and white photo is Eugene O'Neill sitting at his desk in his study at Tao House. He is sitting in a padded office chair with a pillow at his back. He is turned in profile looking down at the long paper tablet on the desk. He is holding a pencil, but not writing. He is wearing a pinstriped suit and dark tie. His desk is not cluttered and has a small barrel on the upper left corner. It is dark wood with four lightly covered straps on it. There is also a medium modern lamp with a flat metal circle shade, centered before him. On the upper right corner of the desk there is a wooden box with a back slanting front and a small drawer beneath it. It would have held writing supplies.\n\nThe two walls of his study one can see, in front of the desk and to the right, are covered with rows and rows of books.\n\n↑ back to top\n\nTEXT: Eugene O’Neill: American Drama Transformed\n\nIn 1930, Sinclair Lewis defined Eugene O’Neill’s place in American culture: “[O’Neill] has done nothing much in the American drama save to transform it utterly in ten or twelve years from a false world of neat and competent trickery to a world of splendor, fear and greatness . . . . [he has] seen life as something not to be neatly arranged in a study, but as terrifying, magnificent and often quite horrible, a thing akin to a tornado, an earthquake or a devastating fire.” Growing up literally backstage in the theatre of his father, O’Neill knew intimately the kind of drama he did not want to write. He was repelled by the hackneyed and melodramatic plots, broad gestures, and overwrought oratory of the American theatre and responded instinctively to the realism and experimental techniques of the European dramatists Shaw, Ibsen, and especially Strindberg.\n\nO’Neill believed that the theatre should be taken as serious art rather than pleasant diversion. He wanted to pull in his audiences, make demands of them, commit them to the experience. He freely used experimental techniques to do so, but always in the service of a fundamental realism. From the start O’Neill was interested in the inner drama of his characters more than their physical or social world, and he evoked psychological states through powerful metaphorical settings. His innovations and revivals of ancient techniques were legion: masks and other expressionist devices, great length, the casting of black actors, taboo subject matter, extended asides with the action frozen, and serious dramatic treatment of the poor and powerless.\n\n↑ back to top\n\nTEXT: O'Neill's Experiment with Plays\n\nO’Neill’s experiments, his unblinking look at raw, sometimes ugly truths were theatrical blows in a broader cultural revolution. He worked during a time of radical change and cross-fertilization in the arts, sciences, and social thought. Modernists like Brecht and Artaud in the theatre; Joyce, Woolf, and Eliot in fiction and poetry; Stravinsky and Schoenberg in music; and Picasso and Kandinsky in painting were breaking with old assumptions and conventions. O’Neill was in the thick of this movement to, in Ezra Pound’s words, “Make it new.”\n\n↑ back to top\n\nTEXT: O’Neill aspired to the tragic\n\nAbove all, O’Neill aspired to the tragic. He was challenged by Greek and Elizabethan tragedy and by what he termed the “first theater that sprang, by virtue of man’s imaginative interpretation of life, out of his worship of Dionysius.” His great achievement, in plays like Desire Under the Elms and Mourning Becomes Electra, was to forge native materials into true American tragedy.\n\nFor all O’Neill’s disdain for his father’s theatre, the “tricks” he had absorbed in his youth continued to emerge in his mastery of staging and his adaptability to the practical demands of the theatre. Even some of what he considered the less desirable characteristics of the old school colored his work. In critic Heywood Broun’s words: “In many external things, O’Neill is a pioneer. . . . But he is still the true son of the man who played The Count of Monte Cristo more than a thousand times. . . . Heredity has left in O’Neill the actor’s greediness for every last potential twist and turn in any given situation.” O’Neill himself said of the leading role in A Touch of the Poet: “What that one needs is an actor like Maurice Barrymore or James O’Neill, my old man. One of those big-chested, chiseled-mug, romantic old boys . .\n\n↑ back to top\n\nIMAGE: Eugene O’Neill’s father James O’Neill\n\nCaption:\n\nO’Neill’s father James O’Neill in his most famous role, The Count of Monte Cristo, in 1900.

His remark that “There are moments [in The Iceman Cometh] . . . that suddenly strip the secret soul of a man stark naked . . . .” reflected his own need to forgive and ask forgiveness.

His head is thrown back in laughter, with his eyes closed and mouth open to reveal his top row of teeth. His right arm is leaning on the table with his hand made into a fist. It appears he is striking the table with that fist, as an emphasis to something he finds funny.\n\n↑ back to top"
