        "text": "27 Eugene O’Neill: Thirst\n\nMs. Safia Begum\n\nLiterary Style of Eugene O’Neill:\n\nEugene O’Neill is known for his characters, their appearance, expressions and especially stage directions in detail. Before the play begins his stage directions highlights the nature of play which was not so common before him. For example he even names every book to be kept in on which book shelf, mentions time, day and describes different rooms. Eugene brought this newness in American theatre scenario. This precision and detailing of both characters and stage is marked as his style.\n\nHowever, it is difficult to define his style in an exact manner because “…At different times, and sometimes within the same framework, he is a naturalist, a romanticist, an impressionist, a symbolist and expressionist, often bordering on the surreal. He is an empiricist, a psychoanalyst, and a mystagogue.”5 This makes difficult to categorise and define his style in simple terms as he gives different layers of meaning to his work by mixing distinct ‘isms’ into one frame. He also gives suggestive titles and use Greek styles structure.\n\nBackground of the Play:\n\nThe play Thirst was written in 1913 when Eugene O’Neill was living in New London, CT. He was then recently released from sanatorium after his successful treatment of tuberculosis. While writing Thirst he wrote two other plays which are also based on shipwreck. These stories are partially influence d by the traumatic sinking incident of Titanic that took place in 1912 which has prompted him to write these plays based on shipwreck.\n\nO’Neill projects a tragic vision especially in his earlier plays. Thirst is one among them where one finds the tortured souls on the verge of a crisis. The three unnamed characters, the Gentleman, Dancer and Sailor, of the play are stranded in mid ocean. Through their agonies, problems and loss of their hopes, O’Neill highlights the emptiness of human beings in this enormous cruel world. Irony of life stands against human progress and the hidden wicked animal instincts of the civilized race. The loneliness is highlighted by the presence of the natural elements like glaring sun like ‘a great angry eye of God’, ‘pitiless clear sky’, ‘the scorching heat waves’ and the madness of silence of the hungry red ocean.\n\nO’Neill’s characters and even his abstract ideas are quite recognizable. In Thirst he has experimented with the Expressionist way of characterization through the West Indian Mulatto Sailor. The Sailor is the most ‘living’ of all the three characters presented. He basically represents the characteristic feature of civilized human beings in contrast to ‘savage’. However, he is presented as the most practical and humane than the rest of the characters of the play. The Sailor is the one who for the first time reveals the urgent need of water. At the mention of water by the Gentleman he stops his song abruptly and turns quickly around. He asks “Water? Who’s got water”…(11).\n\nWhereas the other two characters complain of the maddening silence, pervading red colour like blood over the sky, their aching eyes and so on. When the Sailor stops singing the Dancer asks him why he has stopped singing the Sailor then replies “sticking out his swollen tongue and pointing to it…Water! I want Water! Give me some water and I will sing” (28). So, he seems to be more practical than the other two who are busy in lamenting their lost and unfulfilled achievements. But the Sailor on the other hand keeps singing a Negro song to charm the sharks. He says “It is a song of my people…I am singing to them. It is a charm. I have been told it is very strong. If I sing long enough they will not eat us” (12-13). He tries to adjust to the situation and wants to survive as long as possible. He also remains quite and thus saves energy. But his keeping quiet enhances the mysteriousness of his intentions. In contrast to the Sailor who is awaken to the reality the other two, the Gentleman and Dancer experience visual hallucination of an island and a tumbler full of water.\n\nThe play also reveals the helplessness of humans and the control of nature over destiny of humans. When the Dancer dies the Sailor does not take much time or hesitate for a moment. He begins to sharpen his knife. He also suddenly begins to sing a happy song and says parting his swollen lips…“We shall eat. We shall drink” (42). However, he is punished for his sin and dies in a scuffle with the Gentleman who could not imagine the idea of eating a fellow traveller in order to survive."
