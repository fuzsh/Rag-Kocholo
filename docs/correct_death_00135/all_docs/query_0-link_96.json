        "text": "The Boston area has seen quite a few closures of Irish pubs over the last few years, but in a reversal of the disappointing trend, one Irish pub near Forest Hills that closed its doors in the fall of 2017 is apparently looking to reopen at the same address. Eugene O’Neill’s — reportedly under the stewardship of its former manager Melissa Hunt — petitioned the City of Boston Licensing Board for a common victualler license to be applied at 3700 Washington St. The Licensing Board will meet on July 31 to determine whether to grant Hunt and O’Neill’s the license.\n\nHunt currently works as the operations manager for Irish pub mini-chain Napper Tandy’s, per LinkedIn. When Eugene O’Neill’s was previously open, it was under the same ownership as Napper Tandy’s.\n\nIn addition to the common victualler license, O’Neill’s is seeking an entertainment license, which would allow the bar to host up to three live performers. The Jamaica Plain Neighborhood Council met on July 23 and discussed the potential reopening. Attendees at the meeting were concerned about the noise live music would create, according to an account in the Jamaica Plain Gazette, but despite the concerns, the council voted in support of Hunt and O’Neill’s.\n\nEater has reached out to representatives with Eugene O’Neill’s and will update this post as more information becomes available."
