        "text": "Tell me, frankly, do you think colored people feel as primitive as many writers describe them as feeling . . . ?\n\nHarold Jackman, in a 1928 letter to Claude McKay\n\nWhen the introduction of a critical insights guide, American Multicultural Identity (2014), claims that “identity is certainly shaped in part by one’s current environment, but we imperil our understanding of identity if we also fail to address the past that informs it,” a modern reader would barely bat an eye (xiv). This notion—that one finds and cultivates one’s identity through a connection with one’s past—has become so familiar as to be taken as mere commonplace, within both academic study of identity and everyday interpersonal discourse. Moreover, as the guide’s title makes clear, identity’s grounding in the past seems to matter particularly for members of minoritized US racial or ethnic groups, whose senses of self and of community solidarity are often framed as springing from a shared past marked by oppression, trauma, and resistance.\n\nYet if we “imperil our understanding of identity” by not thinking historically, there may also be peril in the presumption that one’s sense of self must be found in a collective racial past, especially when considering who is responsible for constructing that presumption. Jackman’s question (whose “primitive” I read as shorthand for how the Black past was figured in his era) implies that he may not relate to the sense of the past that others imply Black people should. And the cultural context of this letter further complicates the easy premise expressed by the Critical Insights guide; given that early-twentieth-century white Americans [End Page 23] rewrote and appropriated for their own purposes a Black past primitive and exoticized in nature, it’s not surprising that Jackman feels more alienated from than warm to this version of the past as a basis for identity. As Valerie Rohy has noted, “history . . . is something one cannot simultaneously possess and embody: to have history is the sign of modern culture. To be history is the mark of the primitive” (86). Jackman’s earnest question indexes an anxiety about whether the primitiveness—or more broadly, this version of his past—he thinks he is expected to identify with in fact belongs to him or marks him as constructed by someone else.\n\nEugene O’Neill’s 1920 play The Emperor Jones stands as one of many texts from the early twentieth century that are uncomfortable to revisit because of their racial representations, even as the play was acclaimed by many in its own era as a landmark in African American representation and visibility.1 A return to this play—as well as to its critical interpretations of the last several decades—offers a compelling glimpse at both the relationship between a Black subject and his past, and how that relationship gets constructed and mediated by white authorship, audience, and interpretation, that is emblematic of 1920s-era politics but evocative in our contemporary context as well.2 The Emperor Jones takes as its subject the terrifying and ultimately destructive encounter between an African American man and a series of scenes from his personal past and a collective racial past. For many early audiences and critics (largely white), the play was seen as offering a universal story of humans’ inevitable regression into primitivism and savagery. Later readers corrected these race-blind interpretations by exposing the way O’Neill’s seemingly universal parable in fact traded in familiar and disturbing racial stereotypes. Yet alongside their critiques, these same readers often extract from the play a straightforward moral lesson—that the main character, Brutus Jones, meets his tragic end because of his personal failure to acknowledge his own past. In what follows, I engage with these readings as well as with the play’s historical moment—an era in which African American writers and thinkers vocally promoted the need to reclaim their own history yet debated how best to do so—to reveal how the play’s fundamental weirdness on these topics can be harnessed to trouble historic and contemporary senses of a Black subject’s engagement with their past and the moral resonances of that engagement, as well as to expose the often invisible demands and evasions of white readers and viewers. [End Page 24]\n\nThis inquiry relates to a larger debate in contemporary African American studies about the moral relevance of the past to the present. Both literature (e.g., Toni Morrison’s 1987 Beloved) and criticism (especially that based in trauma theory) raise the notion that the past does not remain past, but persists into the present. This claim has particular force in the context of the past of US slavery, such that voices in both academic and popular discourse urge an ethical commitment to acknowledge how the past intrudes into the present and cannot be consigned to history; as Saidiya Hartman argues, we must attend to the ways the “afterlife of slavery” continues to devalue Black life (6). At the same time, some protest the lengths to which the temporal convergence sometimes goes; Stephen Best, for one, interrogating the presence and force of the “slave past . . . for an entire generation of thinkers,” goes on to wonder why we base “an ethical relation to the past on an assumed continuity between that past and our present . . . ?” (454).3 In her book How to Read African American Literature (2016), Aida Levy-Hussen distills this debate as one between two modes of reading: therapeutic reading, which finds in re-encounters with the past a painful but ultimately positively transforming experience; and prohibitive reading, which sees such attachments as harmful and dangerously tethered to a past which can and should be left behind.4\n\nInspired by these vital conversations, I focus more narrowly—not on the broader question of whether the past is relevant, or whether it coexists with the present, but on how contemporary notions of the past as necessary ingredient for healthy and authentic present-day identities get questioned in the unlikely context of Eugene O’Neill’s century-old play. I approach the play by way of a backward look at the history of buttressing Black identity by means of encounters with the past, from the way Toni Morrison and August Wilson (among many others) have made this past-present convergence foundational, to the early architecture of the concept in O’Neill’s era. As both text and vehicle for Black performance, The Emperor Jones does not simply rehearse this familiar narrative of a Black subject’s need to right his relationship to the past to become whole; instead, it almost surreally embeds this story in a hyperperformative, hyperdramatized context that serves to defamiliarize and deconstruct it. The play’s protagonist Brutus Jones—a man who has created his identity as “Emperor” by way of tight control over and self-narration of his own history—is confronted with a series of representations from a personal and collective past that are fundamentally [End Page 25] strange, dissonant, non-linear, and metahistorical rather than recognizable or recuperative. Moreover, the play’s palpable undercurrent of performativity—as Jones “plays” an Emperor and the Natives he has subdued “stage” an overthrow powered by scenes they may be conjuring—as well as its long legacy of performance landmarks together serve to create a layered and ironic distance from any earnest core moral lesson about the need to face the past to shore up one’s self.5\n\nI consider The Emperor Jones through both a historicist and a presentist lens, as a means of retracing how differently Black and white Americans thought of the Black past’s meaning for present-day identities, and of using these discoveries to probe the origin of and stakes in what today is often taken as given—that Black subjects avoid identifying with the past at their peril. My readings of The Emperor Jones, its early-twentieth-century context, and its more recent interpretations aim to unsettle this knowing narrative about a Black subject’s need to connect with their past by unsettling both the senses of ownership (“their”) and the simplicity of the “past” in this framing. Reconsidering this precept in the context of a racist text by a white canonical author who in his time was heralded as a boon for African American representation enables a complex reconsideration not just of the relevance of the Black past for Black subjects, but also of white Americans’ investment in that precept. If white Americans too easily, a century ago, both misrepresented the Black past and appropriated it as their own, in more recent decades we have seen a competing impulse to cordon off the Black past as meaningful, burdensome, and morally relevant exclusively for Black Americans. A glimpse backward at this strange hundred-year-old play can lead to the discovery of the possibilities and limits of shared recognition, ownership, and responsibility for that past.\n\nBecause this essay dwells on audience and reader reception, I want to pause to acknowledge my own positionality as interpreter. As a white scholar, my investment in this reading rests in part in a broader curiosity about how and to what extent we (of any racial identification) ought to seek traces of insight in racist texts by white writers. The trajectory of (largely white-authored) critical reception of O’Neill—from finding in his use of Black characters and tropes a transcendently raceless genius, to calling out the many racist parts of his work yet salvaging some moral lesson that pertains, presumably, merely to Black people—includes also a persistent minority of voices (including some Black voices) who read in O’Neill’s writing of Black characters and stories something [End Page 26] that amounts to a genuine contribution to African American studies.6 While my first instinct is to question these latter voices as misreadings, they’ve yet led me to wonder about what appeal this play—with all of its antiquated and offensive representations—still holds, and how our current moment of being highly attuned to the persistent threats to and precarity of Black life might refract the play’s messages differently today. The Emperor Jones might also reveal a self-awareness about white involvement in the Black past that, while problematic in itself, yet resists merely replicating an all too familiar erasure of white complicity in Black trauma.\n\niii.\n\nThe Emperor Jones tells of a Black self-made man’s undoing by a confrontation with visions from the past, while also providing entry points into reconsidering familiar narratives—both historical and contemporary—about that kind of story and the relationship it dramatizes. In the one-act play’s opening scene, the audience learns that, to become Emperor, Brutus Jones has literalized Schomburg’s call to “remake his past . . . to make his future.” Upon arriving at the West Indies island that the play introduces as “as yet not self-determined by White Marines” (echoing in “self-determined” the discourse of self-making), Jones has suppressed his past identity as Pullman porter and ex-con to fashion himself instead as a man so strong “only a silver bullet” can kill him (O’Neill 3, 11), giving him the power to subdue and rule over the [End Page 38] island’s Natives. The action of the play, however, charts his downfall from that high position, by way of a series of encounters with haunting visions from his personal past and a collective Black past; as I detailed above, it’s this devolution which leads so many critics to read the play as a parable speaking to the perils of neglecting one’s authentic past. Yet the particulars of the play and its production and reception histories can be understood together to trouble rather than reinforce that easy moral lesson, exposing what that story tends to occlude.\n\nIn a historical moment of widespread white appropriation of African and Black culture, The Emperor Jones opens by centering Jones’s agency in reclaiming and authoring his own identity, and highlights the power inherent in that move. His erasure of his actual past is what enabled him to ascend to Emperor, but the first, expository scene has Jones re-telling and re-possessing his story in conversation with Smith-ers, the white “Cockney” trader who has inhabited the island since before Jones arrived. When Smithers tries to goad Jones into exposing his criminal past, Jones responds evasively and threateningly:\n\nMaybe I goes to jail dere for gettin’ in an argument wid razors. . . . Maybe I gits twenty years. . . . Maybe I gits in ‘nother argument with de prison guard . . . and I splits his head wid a shovel. . . . Maybe I does all dat an’ maybe I don’t. It’s a story I tells so’s you knows I’se de kind of man dat if you evah repeats one word of it, I ends yo’ stealin’ on dis yearth mighty damn quick.\n\n(14)\n\nJones’s tight control over his past, these lines emphasize, is what gives him power over the Natives and Smithers; and it’s this canny storytelling that literally remakes him—“What I was den is one thing. What I is now’s another” (9). Particularly fascinating is the way even the stage directions seem to be undermined in their certainty by Jones’s self-making gestures. After introducing him as a kind of emperor-minstrel hybrid, wearing a uniform coat “sprayed with brass buttons” and “heavy gold chevrons” along with “bright red” pants with a “light blue stripe,” the stage directions hesitate: “Yet there is something not altogether ridiculous about his grandeur. He has a way of carrying it off” (7–8). In short, Jones is performing the role of Emperor—“I pretends! . . . Dat’s part o’ my game from de fust”—but his performance looks like authenticity (19). [End Page 39] As such, the play’s opening establishes the relationship between a Black man and both his public identity and his past as an empowered and self-directed one, with meaningful impacts.\n\nJones’s precipitous fall from this high place can most easily be taken as a progressive critique of early-twentieth-century Western imperialism, given the play’s date and Caribbean setting, and especially considering Jones’s boast to Smithers that he learned everything he knows about plundering the island and its Natives from “ten years on de Pullman ca’s listenin’ to de white quality talk” (10). And because Jones’s tragic end is driven by these successive visions from the past, most view the play’s moral comeuppance as directed at Jones for the denial of his past that his self-making involves. However, The Emperor Jones’s representations of the past, of temporality in general, and of Jones’s relationship to these serve more to muddle than moralize about a person’s relationship to their past. O’Neill depicts Jones at first as relying on a Western, rational, progress-oriented temporality as a means of confidence and control as he sets out on his trip across the island to escape the Natives’ uprising: he consults his “gold watch,” marks the time as 3:30, and announces that since “sundown is six-thuty or dereabouts,” he has plenty of time to “make it easy” (16). The island’s Indigenous, however, are embedded in and produce an opposing sort of temporality through the rhythm of a drum that beats constantly from the end of Scene One. As the stage directions describe it, “from the distant hills comes the faint, steady thump of a tom-tom, low and vibrating. It starts at a rate exactly corresponding to normal pulse beat . . . and continues at a gradually accelerating rate from this point uninterruptedly to the very end of the play” (17–18). A human heartbeat, or a regularly ticking metronome—either way, insofar as this drumbeat is unchanging and constant, it could represent a sort of eternal now—the marker of the continuous present that accompanies and forces Jones’s journey into the past. Moreover, Jones’s physical movement in the forest—while he aims to travel a straight line progressing to his port of escape, he ends up forming a loop that returns him to the same place he entered—mirrors, spatially, this sense of unchanging now-ness. And other forms of time emerge as well. There’s a small but compelling reference to something like deep geologic time in Scene Five’s reference to a “big dead stump worn by time into a curious resemblance to an auction block” (31). Finally, it would seem to be a sped-up regressive [End Page 40] evolutionary or atavistic time that morphs Jones from finely dressed emperor at the play’s opening into a loincloth-clad creature “squirming on his belly” by the end (38).\n\nRelatedly, the play troubles linear chronology, and offers a puzzling vision of the spaces and people of the present and past. While it’s frequently presumed that the play articulates Jones’s movement through the forest as a steady journey backward into his personal past and then into the collective racial past, the scenes do not in fact line up like that. Jones first encounters his old friend Jeff, whom he once murdered, and shoots again in this scene (Scene 3); in the next scene he confronts a vision of the chain gang-overseer whom he fought while in prison for Jeff’s murder (Scene 4). Were this a trip straight back in time, these scenes ought to be reversed. Although the next three scenes—featuring a slave auction (Scene 5), a Middle Passage ship (Scene 6), and a Congo witch doctor’s ceremony (Scene 7)—arguably follow a more linear regressive pattern, the play nonetheless suggests a series of disjunctions here as well. The witch doctor’s conjuring ceremony, for example, seems similar enough to the Natives’ ceremony that frames and haunts Jones’s entire journey that it makes that witch doctor scene as related to the present as to the distant past; meanwhile, the slave auction scene is explicitly historicized. This connects to the way the relationship between Jones and the Natives—in terms of past and present—gets muddled as well. If Jones’s regression into the past returns him to a tribal conjuring scene, the Natives themselves would seem to stand for the “primitive” origin point to which he is being forced to return. Their status as manifestations of his racial past and the play’s derogatory reference to them using a familiar racist epithet would suggest them to be African Natives, but as uncolonized peoples on a West Indian island, they would be more like New World Indigenous people; indeed, Chief Lem, the only named member of the group, speaks a stereotypically rendered Native American style dialect: “Lead bullet no kill him . . . I cook um money, make um silver bullet” (40). And the earliest appearance of a Native woman diverges from both of these in an even stranger way. When the curtain rises, according to the stage directions, on stage is “a native negro woman . . . dressed in cheap calico . . . a red bandana handkerchief covering [her] . . . hair,” with “[a] bundle bound in colored cloth . . . over her shoulder on the end of a stick” (5). As such she fits the stereotype of an American enslaved person, and indeed, with her [End Page 41] bundle, matches the hand-drawn images of runaway slaves printed in nineteenth-century newspapers.\n\nThese disjunctions could hint at O’Neill’s general clumsiness or even willful ignorance around matters of race. Yet they also constitute a vision of the past that can hardly be seen as transparently morally instructive. Moreover, the ways Jones interacts with these scenes and people from the past further undermine the argument that he has some essential relationship to that past or in fact anything real to learn from these experiences. Scene Five, in which Jones finds himself at a slave auction where he is to be sold, offers the best example of these dynamics. In August Wilson’s Joe Turner’s Come and Gone, the main character’s initial terror at the ghosts of enslaved ancestors gives way to recognition and even embrace, but there is none of that here. As he rests from the previous encounter at the scene’s beginning, a crowd “dressed in Southern costumes of the period of the fifties of the last century” as well as “a batch of slaves” gather around him (32). Seeing this, Jones “screams and leaps madly” onto a nearby stump-cum-auction block, and thus becomes the first slave for sale (32–33). In place of recognition, his face reveals “abject terror giv[ing] way to mystification,” and then he protests:\n\nWhat you all doin’, white folks? What’s all dis? What you all lookin’ at me fo’? What you doin’ wid me, anyhow? (suddenly convulsed with raging hatred and fear) Is dis a auction? Is you sellin’ me like dey uster befo’ de war? (jerking out his revolver just as the auctioneer knocks him down to one of the planters—glaring from him to the purchaser) And you sells me? And you buys me?\n\n(33)\n\nNot only does Jones fail to recognize or accept his interpellation into this scene—asking four times versions of “What is this?”—but he frames his dawning realization of what is happening in terms of historical distance—“like dey uster befo’ de war” (a distancing the stage directions quoted above echo in “the period of the fifties of the last century”). Finally, rather than identify or sympathize with the enslaved people whom he has now been thrown in with, Jones ragingly refuses, emphasizing the individual over the collective: “And you sells me? And you buys me?” Through these gestures, this scene frames the past as anything but morally or emotionally salutary for Jones. [End Page 42]\n\nIn the next two scenes, Jones’s resistance wears down and he does end up joining in with the characters—first, as a passenger on a slave ship; second, as a participant in the conjuring ceremony. Yet these engagements are framed in terms that explicitly diminish Jones’s conscious participation in what is happening. On the slave ship, “a low, melancholy murmur rises among” the passengers, “increasing . . . to a long, tremulous wail of despair” (35). Jones first tries to “shut out the sight” of them, but then “his voice, as if under some uncanny compulsion, starts with the others” (35). In the next scene, the “croon” of the witch doctor makes Jones “completely hypnotized,” his voice said to “join . . . in the incantation” and his body acting out a “pantomime” (37). This language of unconscious, impelled participation in the scenes’ action amplifies a pattern in how the ghostly characters in previous scenes are portrayed. Jones’s old friend Jeff whom he finds playing craps throws dice “with the regular, rigid, mechanical movements of an automaton”; the men in the chain gang move like “automatons—rigid, slow, and mechanical”; and the spectators at the slave market are said to have “something stiff, rigid, unreal, marionettish about their movements” (26, 29, 32). All of these describe unwilful, mechanical, puppeteered participation in scenes from the past, which makes one wonder: who is the puppeteer? Relatedly, and importantly, the manufacturer of the visions from the past that make up the bulk of the play remains obscured. Jones admits the “hants” might be a result of his own exhausted, anxious mind, but the Natives’ conjuring ceremony, ever-present in the background as the tom-tom plays continually, could also be the source (and of course in a play that so foregrounds performance and authorship, O’Neill seems to invite us to remember he as author is ultimately responsible for them). In sum, by making Jones and others in the scenes from the past into unconscious, coerced participants, and by continually implying that someone or something offstage is pulling the strings, the play invalidates any moral precept about a person—and here, particularly a Black American—needing to own and take responsibility for their past.\n\nI turn finally to the character Smithers—the white trader, whose role in the play gets less critical attention. Such neglect makes sense, because Smithers has little to do with the drama unfolding onstage—he appears in Scene 1 as Jones’s interlocutor, and returns only at the end to comment on Jones’s death. A cursory look at Jones’s and Smithers’ [End Page 43] brief interactions might suggest that even in his passivity, Smithers is a supportive co-conspirator: having been on the island longer than Jones, Smithers can share his greater knowledge (when the drumbeat begins, he explains “That means the bleedin’ ceremony ‘as started. I’ve ‘eard it before and I knows” [18]); and witnessing Jones’s dead body being brought on stage at the play’s end, Smithers elegizes Jones with “Gawd blimey, but yer died in the ‘eighth o’ style, any’ow!” (41). Yet Smithers’ ostensible shows of support seem to hide a more powerful complicity in Jones’s fall. Smithers is on stage before and after Jones in Scene One; at the end of the scene, after Jones’s departure, Smithers reveals that he’s in fact rooting for Jones’s defeat, describing him as “puttin’ on ‘is bloody airs! I ‘opes they nabs ‘im an’ gives ‘im what’s what!” (20). In Jones’s presence, Smithers never admits to such hopes, but it’s interesting that O’Neill earlier has him taking credit for Jones’s success—“I give yer a start, didn’t I?—when no one else would?” while acknowledging no responsibility for his failure (9). Jones himself sees through the charade of Smithers’s faux support; just before Smithers shares the news about the Natives planning an overthrow, Jones says “Must be bad news from de happy way you look” (14). And yet, through all of his taking credit for Jones’s successes and rooting for his failures, the play also posits that Smithers is affected not at all by Jones’s misadventures; when he reappears in the final scene, the stage directions simply announce “Smithers is the same as in Scene One” (39). In sum, then, Smithers’s passivity is far from harmless, since the play calls out on multiple levels his subtle enjoyment of Jones’s fall and his failure to help in any meaningful way. What’s more, there’s a strange prelude to Scene One that implies his more active engagement in violence against Black characters. The lengthy stage directions that precede this scene describe Smithers appearing onstage as a “native negro woman” makes her way quietly across it, then springing forward to grab the woman as she tries to escape. Paul D. Streufert refers to this prelude as a “dumb show” version of the entire play itself (131–32); if true, this mini-version hints at Smithers’s much more central role as aggressor rather than mere passive onlooker. As such, any moral drawn from the play that doesn’t somehow implicate this white character comes to feel incomplete.\n\nI wouldn’t go so far as to credit O’Neill with such a critique, but this reading of Smithers is generative for thinking about the role of white people vis à vis the narrative of Black Americans finding their identity [End Page 44] in the past. The play’s staging of Jones’s fall and Smithers’s complicity in that fall can serve as a lens for magnifying the problems not just in the white appropriation of Jones’s story that was endemic to early universalizing interpretations of the play, but also in later critics’ full return of the burden of Jones’s past back to himself. In a 2003 interview with Saidiya Hartman, Frank Wilderson praised Hartman for refusing to do what too many do with respect to Black history: “consciously or unconsciously peel away from the strength and terror of their evidence in order to propose some kind of coherent, hopeful solution to things” (183). Hartman’s pioneering work in allowing the terror to remain, in not forcing a salutary solution (a mode of thinking now understood as Afro-Pessimism) is instructive here for illuminating how O’Neill’s play resists interpretations that want to make Jones’s harrowing journey back into the past into a moral lesson with particular meaning for Black people.\n\nThere is an oft-told story of The Emperor Jones’s Harlem premiere at the Lincoln Theater in 1927. As Langston Hughes relayed in his autobiography, the Black audience responded quite differently from how prior audiences had at the climax of Jones’s terrifying experience.\n\nWhen the Emperor started running naked through the forest, hearing the Little Frightened Fears, naturally they howled with laughter.\n\n“Them ain’t no ghosts, fool!” the spectators cried from the orchestra. “Why don’t you come on out o’ that jungle back to Harlem where you belong?”\n\n(198)\n\nWhile some Black viewers had taken O’Neill’s play seriously, this audience clearly refused to, insisting instead that people like Jones should reject this forced story of the past and come live in the here and now of Harlem. My reading of The Emperor Jones against the backdrops of its reception history and debates over framing the Black past in its own era has aimed to complicate what the “past” means in these discussions, to trouble the narrative that stories of Black subjects struggling with their pasts are meaningful only for Black people, and to reveal how much this narrative obscures white Americans’ dangerously invisible role in scripting and sabotaging those relations. If Hughes’s fellow play-goers resisted acknowledging themselves in Jones’s fall, perhaps white Americans could stand to take a bit more responsibility for and a sense [End Page 45] of shared ownership of stories such as these, for the inescapability of the Black past embroils us all."
