        "text": "1 Eugene O’Neill and Ireland Dr Richard Hayes Waterford Institute of Technology Public Lecture, University of Malta, Valetta 23 November 2016 I Iŵ pƌeseŶtiŶg these ƌeŵaƌks Ŷot oŶlǇ oŶ ŵǇ oǁŶ ďehalf ďut oŶ ďehalf of Đolleagues assoĐiated ǁith the PeƌfoƌŵiŶg the ‘egioŶ theatƌe studies pƌojeĐt at the School of Humanities at Waterford Institute of Technology. 1 That project looks to understand the relatioŶship ďetǁeeŶ the theatƌe that goes oŶ iŶ a ƌegioŶ aŶd that ƌegioŶs identity, and the group has work going on, for instance, on the Red Kettle Theatre Group (the Waterford-based theatre group that flourished until recently from the 1980s), work on the playwright Jim Nolan, and a new project on the work of female playwrights from the region like Teresa Deevy. Deevy is a particularly important figure. Rejected by the Abbey in the 1940s, she has only recently been recovered for the national repertoire; she is a disruptive figure in the narrative as are, we argue, all regional writers. Our project aims to correct the prevailing narrative of modern theatre in Ireland, suggesting that there are alternative ways of understanding the story than are provided for within what is broadly a Dublin-Connemara axis. Whats clear to the group is that there is a very strong relationship between not only a country but a region and the drama (and perhaps also the literature) that is written by the people of that region. In some ways, the group contends, the theatre pƌoduĐed iŶ a paƌtiĐulaƌ plaĐe is a ǁaǇ of deĐlaƌiŶg ǁheƌe Ǉouƌe fƌoŵ aŶd at the same time a means of understanding where you are from—and in this way is a way of peƌfoƌŵiŶg the ideŶtitǇ of that plaĐe. This is the immediate context within which are set these remarks aďout EugeŶe ONeill, a strange presence perhaps within the ĐoŵpaŶǇ aŶd aŶ uŶusual ĐhoiĐe as ƌepƌeseŶtatiǀe iŶ soŵe ǁaǇ of ƌegioŶal ǁƌitiŶg—I hope justification for that choice will emerge as we talk. What I want to play out in these remarks is something of the meaning of Ireland for EugeŶe ONeill and the meaning of Ireland in his work. How did Ireland manifest itself iŶ the plaǇs of EugeŶe ONeill, aŶd ǁhǇ did it appeaƌ iŶ that way rather than 1 The members of the Performing the Region Theatre Studies group at Waterford Institute of Technology are: Dr Richard Hayes, Dr Una Kealy, Kate McCarthy, Elizabeth Howard.\n\n2 any other? And (I suspect of particular interest to this group), how was Ireland geŶdeƌed iŶ his ǁoƌk? My interest is in gender and representations particularly of motherhood and the (potential) relationship between these representations and emigration. (The representation of motherhood—and non-motherhood—is interesting, I think, within the feminist project and certainly carries with it an important political charge. The political implications of certain representations of motherhood might, indeed, be worth discussing in the dialogue afterwards.) We know EugeŶe ONeill never visited Ireland, but I will contend that nonetheless Ireland was an important presence; it ǁas paƌt of the teaƌs aŶd ďlood out of ǁhiĐh he created his greatest work, including his masterpiece, LoŶg Day’s JourŶey iŶto Night. I want to suggest some new ways of looking at the play as well as considering the meaning of the presence of Ireland, its form, the way it is gendered. I wish to beg your indulgence and excuse this piece as something of a work in progress; from the dialogue afterwards, I would hope to discern some useful ways of developing the work, resolving some of my own questions as well, I hope, as contributing to resolving some of yours. Some of my questions are intensely personal, having to do with attempts (in my middle years!) to come to terms with notions of family, inheritance, and legacy (as our own parents die, we move to the front of the line!); some of my questions are aesthetic and have to do with coming to gƌips ǁith the ƌeŵaƌkaďle ǁoƌk of EugeŶe ONeill, a ŵaŶ of eŶoƌŵous ĐoŵpleǆitǇ, aŶd a ǁƌiteƌ of uŶeƋualled poǁeƌ. IŶdeed it is peƌhaps the uŶdeƌstaŶdiŶg of ONeills particular tragic power that is of most interest to me. II I want to begin with the idea of family and inheritance. My own father died when I was five, in an air crash. As a consequence, when I thought of inheritance, growing up, I always thought in terms of the air. In a strange inversion, I was Dedalus to my fatheƌs IĐaƌus aŶd assoĐiated hiŵ, aŶd faŵilǇ, alǁaǇs gƌoǁiŶg up, ǁith ǁiŶgs, the sky, the air. In recent years, however, as I discovered more, the silences that prevailed relating to my ŵother’s family began to be filled in, spoken about. Her family story is that of the sea, for her father, her grandfather, and his father in turn all died at sea; I have begun to think more of the sea as carrying my inheritance, through her, and I have looked away froŵ the aiƌ toǁaƌds ǁhat Isŵael Đalls the ǁateƌǇ paƌt of the ǁoƌld. IŶdeed, he speĐulates ;I aŵ ƋuotiŶg heƌe fƌoŵ the opening paragraph of Moby-Dick): Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own"
