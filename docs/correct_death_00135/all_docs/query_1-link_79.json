I have already expressed my gratitude to the many friends and theater colleagues of Eugene O'Neill who gave me their recollections, and also to Carlotta Monterey O'Neill, and to the many librarians and curators who assisted my research in my earlier biographical study, The Tempering of Eugene O'Neill, which appeared in 1962. I am indebted since then to Max Wylie (who worked in close conjunction with Agnes Boulton when she was writing Part of a Long Story and he was working on his novel Trouble in the Flesh) for sharing documents with me, to Kenneth Macgowan for his recollections, and to John H. G. Pell for recollections of O'Neill and information on the fate of Eugene O'Neill's private library at Yale and at the C. W. Post College of Long Island University. I also thank Donald Ungarelli and the other librarians of C. W. Post College who assisted me there. I am also thankful for a fellowship from the Institute for the Arts and Humanistic Studies at The Pennsylvania State University, in the fall of 1968, which allowed me to do the solid reading in all of O'Neill's intellectual sources discovered from the books at Yale and those in the C. W. Post Collection. I have friends to thank for support and assistance during the years when I was working on this book outside the United States, particularly for supplying\n\nviii\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nme with suddenly needed books. I am especially grateful to Professor George Wellwarth of the State University of New York at Binghamton (who always does more than is asked of him), and grateful for the extraordinary time and trouble generously given by Professor Edward Margolies of the City University of New York; Professor Joann Ryan Morse of Barnard College, Columbia University; Professor Edith Link of the City University of New York; Professor John Shawcross of the University of Kentucky; and Professor Charles Mann, Chief of Rare Books and Special Collections at The Pennsylvania State University Libraries. I had much encouragement from Professor Robert Proctor of Connecticut College, who was especially interested in the theory of creativity and its implications for teaching, and from Professor William Fisher of Rutgers University, who read the manuscript here in Italy and gave me an invaluable suggestion for revising the introduction. I also owe more than I can say to the great spirit of Professor Robert Worth Frank, Jr., Pennsylvania State University, to the large vision of my editor at Penn State Press, Philip Winsor, and to the nurturing over many years of my agent, Gunther Stuhlmann. My debt to many libraries for assistance and for permission to quote from manuscripts in their collections is enormous. Yale University assisted over many years with its great wealth of manuscripts and letters of Eugene O'Neill and the Theatre Guild in the Collection of American Literature, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, particularly the present curator of American Literature, Patricia C. Willis; the curator during the many years I did my research there, Donald Gallup; and the librarian of the American Literature Collection in those years, Anne Whelpley. Yale University also gave literary permission to quote extensively from manuscripts of Eugene O'Neill in their collection at Beinecke Library and from the collections of many other libraries.

Somewhere, between the two, lies the mystery of the creative process, and that word \"imagination,\" so often used to explain the mystery, evades rather than fills the emptiness. This book sets out to fill in the blank, at least in the case of one author, Eugene O'Neill, by tracking him through nine consecutive plays to discover the whys and wherefores of what happens in them. If a \"source\" means a person or event the author knew, or his recollection of some other work of literature, or his use of a directive idea from his intellectual ambient, one can then ask, \"Why did exactly this configuration of sources come together at the borderline of consciousness to shape characters, plot, conflict, events? How did they work toward and reach the dramatic resolution of the life experience in each play?\" In searching into these nine O'Neill plays-Desire Under the Elms, Marco Millions, The Great God B r a , Lazarus Laughed, Strange Zntedude, Dynamo, Mourning Becomes Electra, Ah, Wilderness! and Days Without End-the \"why\" begins to show itself in the first two. O'NeiU finished Marco Millions after he had written Desire Under the Elms, but he had begun it before, had\n\n2\n\nIntroduction: The Mystery-and the Solving of It\n\ndone the scenario and written one act. Strangely enough, the act so insistent on being written first was the last act, the funeral and great mourning scene for his heroine, the Princess Kukachin. After that, the play went cold, and O'Neill put aside the writing of all the other acts, which are all concerned with a satirical comedy on American business values by way of Marco Polo and his father and uncle. O'Neill began with the end, with the funeral and mourning over the Princess, because at the time he was absorbed in grief and mourning over the death of his mother. And it was the same grief for his mother that caused him to drop Marco Millions after that one act and turn to other work, so that he became caught up in a play that had been born out of his mourning, Desire Under the Elms, the first idea for which had come to him shortly after his mother's death in 1922. What brought it instantly to life two years later was a dream about his mother fraught with her meaning for him, so that he could confront his grief and all the pulls it created in him directly by writing Desire Under the Elms. At that point he had to write it. For Eugene O'Neill-as this book shows-a play was an opportunity to confront and solve a pressing life problem, and the order in which he tackled his plays, and the arousal in his mind of a particular configuration of memories and ideas to shape them, came from the urgency of the life problem that he was facing in each one. The great lure against which O'Neill was battling in Desire Under the Elms was the irresistible pull to join his mother in the grave. His need to struggle against that powerful undertow awakened the particular configuration of memories and ideas that would shape his drama. Before he had made a playwright of himself, O'Neill had fought just such a battle within his mind and lost. He had tried to kill himself, and only luck had saved him from succeeding. If he never attempted suicide again, he was preserved from it by the ability to fight out his battle against suicidal impulses with greater insight and wisdom in his plays. He could fight that battle through his characters and their story with perspective and unflinching honesty because he himself remained unaware of the real battle he was fighting. He could declare, when asked about the theme of Desire Under the Elms, that he was writing a play about possessiveness-in money, in property, in love-and that theme certainly worked for him both in harmony and in counterpoint with his larger theme of the life-and-death battle. Both together created the play's ultimate shape, but all the richness, intensity, and significance of his characters and their fate in the play derive from the larger theme that impelled him to write. So, although O'Neill was perfectly clear that there was more to his play than the theme of possessiveness so easily\n\nIntroduction: The Mystery-and the Solving of It definable, he was also clear that, whatever that \"something- more\" was, he could write it into his play-but he could not capture it in an explicit statement. All this will be seen in the chapter on Desire Under the Elms. What the play would have been had it been impelled only by the theme of possessiveness is revealed in one of the many notes that place this chapter in perspective. It shows that when O'Neill wrote a film scenario and deliberately cut all the dream-unconscious elements of his play as the most likely to be censored, he changed it into a simple sermon on avarice devoid of all the tragic power and poetry of his play. One interesting question that arises from this study of O'Neill is whether the old categories of \"conscious\" and \"unconscious\" do not muddle the picture of his state of mind. He could be entirely unconscious of the fact that he was undertaking a great battle of the forces for life in him against the forces for death while he wrote Desire Under the Elms-yet only a year later, when he began work on The Great God Brown, be perfectly clear that his purpose was to create a real mystery drama, like the first plays that arose out of the worship of the god of life, Dionysus, in which, as in the mystery rites, the forces of life and eternal renewal triumph over death. So he was unconscious in one context of what was soon to become his explicitly reasoned purpose in another. And even though he followed The Great God Brown up with another mystery drama in Lazarus Laughed, he never gained conscious awareness that he had begun his mystery dramas with Desire Under the Elms. In other words, he had been creating - his own future awareness, his own future conscious, but it never became retroactive. His own mind had engineered the entire battle of forces in Desire Under the Elms, yet he never saw that he had done so in that context, even though that victory had created in his mind a new purpose and new consciousness for his coming plays. Indeed, the way in which O'Neill confronted in these nine plays his intense problems in love and maniage shows the same curious combination of knowing and not knowing at the same instant, and the same constant evolution in his thinking brought about by his actual knowledge of what refused to report itself in explicit reasoning. Thus we can watch the trouble in his marriage to Agnes Boulton already tangentially revealing itself in Desire Under the Elms, and powerfully charging the tragedy of The Great God Brown, until finally, unbeknownst to him, he sought and found in Strange Interlude (in which he combined the novel with the play form) the answer to his marriage problem. He was still fighting in real life to preserve his maniage after he had already seen in the form of his play that it could end only in divorce. The decision as to what to do with two such lovers as he and Agnes came a full year later in his life than\n\nIntroduction: The Mystery-and the Solving of It\n\nin his play. Yet within the world of his plays, O'Neill fully understood-knew without knowing-that he had determined the future of his marriage in his novel-play. In fact, as soon as he finished it, he got an idea for a play about a man who works out the fate of his marriage by way of writing a novel. Yet O'Neill never saw that this play-which would be Days Without End-had originated with a decision to divorce Agnes. Nor did he discover the connection in the writing of it. Yet the two women between whom he had been tom, his wife Agnes and Carlotta Monterey, came together in both the wife of the play and the woman threatening her, not only as the real two women were when he first thought of the play, with Agnes the wife and Carlotta the threat, but also as they were when he came to write it, with Carlotta the wife and Agnes the threat to her. There is the strangest fusion of parts of the life story and character of these two women in both the women of his play. Nevertheless, even while he worked with these ambiguities, perfectly clear that he was seeking in this play a renewed faith in love to live by, he never saw the genesis of this play in the decision that he had made through writing his novel-play Strange Interlude. The creation of his own consciousness, his own awareness, steadily taking place as he created his plays, is rendered particularly piquant by the surprises in his results, brought about by the conflicting forces within him. If O'Neill was a playwright, and exclusively a playwright, he was so because the life of a play is conflict and conflict was built into his personality. Not only was he swept by contradictory forces of life and death, of love and hate, but all his tendencies toward faith and positive affirmation were invariably accompanied by powerful forces of doubt and critical disbelief. His individual plays were charged with these conflicting forces, and he even conceived two of his plays at the same time, planning and writing the scenarios of both together, one of which, Strange Interlude, is ideologically antithetical to the other, Lazarus Laughed. We find him, in Strange Interlude, picking up the poetic images in celebration of faith of Lazarus Laughed and reversing them into images of despair. Even more surprising, after writing The Great God Brown and Lazarus Laughed, in which the god Dionysus and the goddess Cybele-Demeter are visible within his characters, he suddenly turned upon himself and attacked god-making with his play Dynamo. In Dynamo he investigated the twisted psychology behind the creation of gods-mother gods and father gods-in an astonishing breaking-down of the whole basis of his affirmations of faith before it. And in Dynamo he also attacked his own compulsive doubt and skepticism, which had come from his never having really gotten past his rebellion against his father and his childhood faith. So O'Neill could then go on to create the last two plays of this study, Ah, Wilderness! and Days Without End, the first of\n\nIntroduction: The Mystery-and the Solving of It which was born drectly out of the frustration of trylng to write the second, and those two plays, which critics saw as representing a complete return to his boyhood beliefs, actually represented (had his judges been able to see the struggle that produced them) O'Neill's victory in liberating himself both from the need to create gods and from his old compulsive reaction against faith and belief. Exactly at the point when almost everyone thought he had committed himself to a return to Catholicism, he had succeeded in liberating himself entirely from past compulsions and old rebellions that had bound him inextricably, if negatively, to those beliefs. In the excruciating struggle to create a renewed faith in life through Days Without End, O'NeiU gave birth to the voice and larger perspective of the last plays he would write. Even though, in the end, he had to suppress that voice from Days Without End to reach a resolution of his old compulsive rebellion, it would sound out strong and clear in the plays he was still to write, particularly in the last three: The lcemun Cometh, Long Day's journey into Night, and A Moon for the Misbegotten. This story of the writing of nine of O'Nedl's plays starts with the dream play Desire Under the E l m because it allows for a very intimate penetration into the Life problem impelling him and the configuration of memories guiding him, and ends with another dream play, Ah, Wilderness! along with the play that gave birth to it, Days Without End, and its great struggle to achieve new balance. Although the focus is entirely on the plays, a moving story of one man's struggle for life understandng emerges. O'Neill's most intimate biography starts, not stops, at the door to his writing room, for it was there that all the great battles of his life were fought out to a steadily expanding understanding. If his plays have awakened an abidng worldwide interest, both in productions and as books to be read, it is so, certainly, because he has conveyed through them much of that expanding understanding and compassion for the human condition to others. What stands, then, between the source and the finished work in O'Neill's case is the impehng power of a particular life problem and the configuration of interlocking memories that came to him as the raw materials for solving it. Of all his plays, Marco Millions depends most heavily on what is usually taken for a \"sourcem-that is, on his readings about Marco Polo in the scholarly editions by Yule and Marsden, his own political orientation aimed at notorious scandals of his time, and his readings in Chinese philosophy and poetry. Yet even in this play, the magic that turns prosaic readings into the enchantment and poetry of the play is the configuration of memories that gave immediacy and life to the facts. The entire tragic story of the beautiful Princess Kukachin could never have taken shape from the few bare facts about her in the sources\n\nIntroduction: The Mystery-and the Solving of It\n\nhad she not become infused, through O'Neill's first vision of her as a dancing girl, with the poetry and beauty of his wife Agnes in her dancing photograph, and had she not become an outlet for his grief over his mother. Take, for example, the Prologue to the play that resolves her whole tragedy. That tragedy had not been resolved by the last scene of the play-the one that O'Neill had written first-which had been full of O'Neill's doubt, for nothing in Chinese religion could deny death. Instead, he found his answer by writing a Prologue based on a long scholarly footnote in Yule about the legends of prophetic sacred trees, one of which Marco Polo had spoken of seeing. What transformed this lengthy footnote into drama was its infusion by specific memories of the funeral of O'Neill's mother. In fact, the entirely unhistorical funeral journey of the play's Princess from Persia, where she died, back to China for her funeral, had been born directly out of the actual journey of O'Neill's mother in her coffin from California, where she died, back to New York for the funeral and burial in New London. The dead Princess's taking on the power to speak when her coffin comes under the prophetic tree, so that she can deliver a message of eternal life and love, came partly from O'Neill's profound longing for a message of faith from his mother like the one he had taken from his dying father, and partly from the linkage of his mother to a tree that had been riveted in his mind through his writing of Desire Under the Elms with its maternal trees, for he had achieved through them his first victory over the pull of death, just before returning to the writing of Marco Millions. The entire nine plays of this study show how plot, character, and imagery have been shaped by a specific nexus of personal memories brought into activity by a pressing life problem. Even something as seemingly external as the time sequence in a play may be determined by the particular memory impelling O'Neill's writing. For instance, Lazarus Laughed, a play that treats the fear of death, is charged with memories from the death of O'Neill's father. This play begins with the setting of the sun, and although there are gaps of months between the acts, all the scenes that follow are placed consecutively later and later, as if they were taking place all on one night, and the last four scenes actually do take place on the same night beginning at two o'clock in the moming and ending with the dawn of the next day. The same sequence had occurred to O'Neill for his much earlier play The Emperor Jones, in which he was also treating the psychology of fear and to which he had turned immediately after his father's death. In this play all the action takes place in the course of one night, starting with late afternoon and then moving later and later into the night until the final scene ends with dawn, just as in Lazarus Laughed. The odd thing about the time is that it follows that of the events when James O'Neill died.\n\nIntroduction: The Mystery-and the Solving of It\n\nO'Neill, with his mother and brother, had stayed with his father at the hospital until late that afternoon. They had been awakened by a telephone call close to midnight summoning them with the news that his father was dying. Back they rushed to the hospital, and they stayed there at the deathbed until James O'Neill breathed his last at 4:15 in the morning of August 10,1920. Dawn was breaking when they left the hospital, as it breaks at the end of the two plays that emerged out of that traumatic night. Not only immediate time, but also the historical setting of a play, may emerge from the configuration of memories impelling it-such as the California gold rush setting of Desire U n h r the Elms. That the nexus of memories behind a play works powerfully to shape it appears most dramatically in the instances (a number of which are noted in this study) where the memories assert themselves so intensely that they begin to break out of the play logic and actually contradict the facts of the play. For instance, memories of O'Neill's brother Jamie assert themselves so authentically in the character of Dion Anthony at some points in The Great God Brown that, just as Jamie had always insisted that he had created Eugene's success, so Dion insists that he had created Brown's, even though in the play Brown has already been a success before he began feeding on Dion's creative power. Indeed, errors and inconsistencies sometimes arise in a play simply because a particular configuration of memories dominates the author's mind as he writes. In The Great God Brown O'Neill had at first stayed very close to his brother's last days in New London, as the early drafts show. Later he changed such scenes as the one in Jamie's old haunt, the local brothel, probably to avoid censorship, and he set this scene instead in the prostitute's own cottage. Yet he has Brown look for Dion there as if it were a well-hown haunt of his, although as the play facts stand, Dion has turned up there by chance for the first time that night. O'Neill himself never caught this error from changing one major fact in the memory system that he was taking for granted as he wrote. Of course, the human mind-even in processes that take place before ideas report themselves to consciousness-does not work literally and mechanistically, but always has the capacity of itself to create out of the facts symbolic images that get at an emotional or intellectual essence. One cannot penetrate the creative process merely by making a point-by-point comparison of the facts in the memory system and the facts in the play. One must go beyond to an understanding of habitual ways of seeing life on the author's part. For instance, O'Neill could transmute his mother's fatal journey to California to realize the money on some property James O'Neill had purchased there into an idea for a play about the California gold rush with death at its finale because he had been in the habit of seeing his father's financial investments as the gold buried on\n\nIntroduction: The Mystery-and the Solving of It\n\nthe island of Monte Cristo in the play that had made him rich. To reach any understanding of the transformation of memory facts into the living imagery of the play, one needs to know not only the facts of the particular memory feeding it, but also the habitual structure of thought and ways of interpreting life that have operated in the author from boyhood. In O'Neill many of these can be discovered from his images in letters, and also from some of the cruder imagery in his earliest apprentice plays. Also, as we shall see in the analysis that follows, O'Neill had a tendency to repeat certain crucial wishes or symbolic ideas, so that they recur in several plays. The Princess in the Prologue of Marco Millions is not the only woman who rises momentarily out of death to deliver a message of life and love; two others do so in the course of these nine plays. Also, Dion Anthony in The Great God Brown is one out of quite a procession of men in O'Neill's plays who get down on their knees before a beloved woman. In comparing memory with play, neither can one amve at truth by assuming a one-to-one relationship between character and original. A number of O'Neill's critics have thought that a father in an O'Neill play must ipso facto be his own father, a mother his own mother, and a son himself. Thus most critics have taken the old father Ephraim in Desire Under the E l m for O'Neill's father, and the son Eben who cuckolds him for O'Neill. But this character comes not as a reproduction of James O'Neill, but as an embodiment of O'Neill's identification with his father, so that as the play progresses, Ephraim expresses O'Neill's own philosophy of life and creativity and embodies the distrust and loneliness that O'Neill himself felt at the core of his mamage. O'Neill certainly recognized Ephraim as a self-portrait-he actually said he was-but his critics have been so imbued with the preconception that father in literature is father in life that they have managed to misconstrue his words. No more does O'Neill's mother make her appearance in O'Neill's plays necessarily as a mother. She is as likely to appear as a child. Another misinterpretation of what is going on in an O'Neill play comes from the assumption, slipped into by some of his psychoanalytic critics, that O'Neill was unconscious of the Freudian implications of his characters, as if psychoanalytic theory was a secret to which outsiders had no access. They have thought that O'Neill had no idea of the psychological significance of Eben's sexual attraction to his stepmother in Desire Under the Elms. They assume that O'Neill had been releasing by way of Eben his own unconscious incestuous wishes. Actually, O'Neill was perfectly aware of these psychoanalyhc implications, for he had examined critically not only the theories of Freud but also those of Stekel and Jung. It is impossible to assess correctly what forces had been acting\n\nIntroduction: The Mystery-and the Solving of It to shape an O'Neill play without knowing well the whole range of his intellectual equipment. Another assumption that obscures the dynamics of O'Neill's creativity sees him as mechanically subject to influences, so that ideas from others fell dead into his head. Actually, as these nine plays reveal, O'Neill no sooner grasped an idea than he was transforming it creatively. In his very fruitful association with Kenneth Macgowan and Robert Edmond Jones, O'Neill had no sooner taken up an idea of theirs than he was in turn influencing them by all the original applications and combinations of it to which he had leapt ahead. His active intellectual life was a potent force in shaping his plays, working hand in hand with the memory systems leading him to resolve urgent life problems. Always he used ideas flexibly, criticallytransforming them, and the history of these nine plays shows his critics limping along after him, trying to catch, in their limited ideological nets, conceptions built on fields of knowledge that are totally unfamiliar to them. We shall also see that his most artistically successful works show a reinforcing harmony between the memory system nourishing them and the intellectual conceptions operating through them. These shaping forces are put forth here as if they had all been set up a priori. Actually they came out of an analysis, play by play, of the configuration of memories within each, canied out with awareness of all the pitfalls lying in wait in such an approach. A major danger in trying to reconstruct the memory system operating in a play by comparing play facts with life facts is that there are many specious, farfetched resemblances that can be read into the process. How can one be sure that a particular set of memories actually was operating in a play and that they really had been activated by the need to solve a particular life problem? The best confirmation lies in the extent of the configuration. Two or three resemblances of minor details may come through sheer chance or through intellectual straining on the part of the analyst. But if a whole scheme of details, most of them major, fit one another, the identification is probably correct. In such a configuration one or two details may indeed be erroneous, but the mass of them, in all probability, will be trustworthy. In the making of this analysis, a number of trails had to be abandoned because they never achieved a sufficiently convincing solidity. No hint of the trial and error is apparent in the final chapters, but traces appear in the Notes at the end of this book. Indeed, the Notes do more than iden* the sources of quotations and information. Many of them reinforce the evidence in the chapters and explain why one interpretation is more likely than another. A few comparisons have been allowed to stand, even though more needs to be known about them, because they are suggestive in the light of other evidence. For all the\n\n10\n\nIntroduction: The Mystery-and the Solving of It\n\nmajor points, however, the weight of evidence is substantial enough to cany conviction. If one is certain of the memory system, how can one be sure that it had been set in motion, not only because the author wanted to create a play with a plot, characters, scenes, and confrontations, but also because all these elements allowed him to tackle major problems in his life? Analysis reveals the problems, as it reveals the memories they have summoned up. One can deduce the problem from the memory system itself, from the genesis and awakening in O'Neill's mind of a play, from the way he aligned the forces in his life among the characters and conflicts of the play, and from the way that the balance achieved in a play influenced O'Neill. The most efficient check is this last one of seeing what changes took place in O'Neill's life after completion of a particular play. If the memory system in the play was impelling him to certain basic decisions, once he made them for his play he would inevitably take a fresh perspective on his living and act upon it. The chapters present all the evidence, as far as possible, so that even one who is unfamiliar with O'Neill can follow and evaluate the analysis. Of course, what is true for O'Neill may not necessarily be true for other writers. Only further studies of individual authors wiU make for a genuine science of creativity. Nevertheless, this picture of how O'Neill faced life problems in his plays, and how the memory systems awakened by them shaped plot, character, and imagery, suggests the likelihood that other writers-probably many other writers-create their works in a similar way. If this is so, a whole range of aesthetic values may be traced to the creative process behind the work. The unity and richness of tone and imagery, even much that is thought of as \"style,\" may come from the intensity of the memory system directing a writer. Probably the validity of a work of art depends on how honestly and penetratingly the author has perceived and stored his life experience, as well as how fully memories of those experiences nourish his writing. If he is striving, even though unconsciously, to solve his life problems honestly through them, then the motive power behind literature is essentially healthy, rather than diseased as some critics have believed. The value of the work lies in how profoundly reality has been faced and resolved in it. If it is based on valid memories, it should give a reader a wider life experience than the living of his one life can, and should enlarge his understanding of what it means. Thus the value of reading great literature would be similar to the value of writing great literature-that of reaching a greater wisdom in living. One may answer all kinds of critical questions by way of this idea of the creative process. Why, for instance, does a literary collaboration-even one\n\nIntroduction: The Mystery-and the Solving of It\n\n11\n\nbetween, say, a writer of the grandeur of Joseph Conrad and the potential excellence of Ford Madox Ford-produce a work bereft of the emotional intensity and scope of meaning that each could create alone? Apparently the collaboration allows neither to work profoundly with his life through the writing, and thus excludes its nourishment by a transforming personal memory system. Indeed, the reason why one potboiler remains merely a potboiler and another achieves literary value probably depends on whether the chosen subject allows for the infusion of a profound memory system impelled by the urgency to come to terms with some aspect of living. In O'Neill's case the memory system that shapes his play remains largely unconscious. Most of the time O'Neill is not consciously recalling old experiences, yet they steadily direct and inform him. Here and there an aspect of the memory may be registered consciously, but never the intricate nexus that brings the work to life. This is probably a characteristic of the way memory of personal experience operates as a force in any confrontation of life, not only of the way an artist creates. Certainly a man in a stressful situation-say, with a tiger in his path-cannot spare any part of his consciousness from watching the tiger and perceiving his options for safety. When a pounce on the part of the tiger sets him to act, he will do so out of a combination of a push from activated memories of similar dangers and the necessities of his immediate situation. He could not cope at all with the peril were he to turn his conscious attention to mulling through old experience, for he would lose his awareness of what the tiger is about to do. The mind of the creative artist apparently works the same way that the human mind works to determine very different lines of action. The brain can work intricately and purposefully without reporting itself to consciousness. And for the writer, the unconsciousness serves to insulate him from the lethal charge of his materials until he has put them, by way of the writing, into a managable form. Reports from creative people suggest that the arousal of memory, even though unconscious, is not simply a passive procedure, with the materials inert but available, like a file taken out of a cabinet. It seems that the memories awaken to violent activity, with some reinforcing others and some canceling one another out, so that by themselves they are moving toward a solution. A number of persons in the thick of creativity have noticed the strange combination, at certain stages, of a physical sense of tension, excitement, and a perfectly blank mind. Charles Dickens-that most acute observer-in the act of generating a new novel reported long periods of a blank mind and an almost unbearable feeling of restlessness, so that he was driven to walk for miles and miles, or had the feeling that he must set out instantly for some distant part of the world. He\n\n12\n\nIntroduction: The Mystery-and the Solving of It\n\nwould find himself walking around and around his study carpet, stepping compulsively on the same parts of the pattern, with no idea why he was doing so. Clearly immense tension from inner mental activity was impelling him, and an active attempt to \"think at that particular point would only have impeded the process. Writers are always being surprised, sometimes astounded, by what comes out in the writing. The author of Light on the Path, for example, a woman fatally bitten by the spiritualist bug, felt herself to be merely taking dictation from a holy man who had died centuries before choosing her as a channel for his wisdom. Her explanation may be absurd, but she came up with it to account for an authentic sensation that a number of less obsessed authors have observed and reported. Of course, the entire creative process does not take place unconsciously. That is why, in the chapters to follow, much care has been taken to register all of O'Neill's conscious critical perceptions of what he was doing, as well as all his conscious planning and theorizing. To weigh accurately all the forces interacting in the writing, these must be known. But certainly for O'Neill, with all his intellectual directives, the most intense part of the creative process-the push of the memory system directing him-reported itself only through the writing. His experience with Ah, Wilderness!where he woke up with the whole play shaped and ready to write differs only in degree from the generation of his other works. It demonstrates visibly how-with a life problem impelling him-he came quite unconsciously to plot, events, and characters. When a draft of Ah, Wilderness!was all written, he could then attack it critically and add a final scene to give its resolution greater appropriateness for his mature life. From these nine plays by O'Neill, a fascinating picture emerges of the way a body of closely related memories, of which the author was largely unconscious, worked to shape his plot, setting, characters, and imagery and to determine the ultimate resolution of the play's conflicts.\n\nChronology of Important Events Leading Up to This Story\n\nJuly 14,1877\n\nJames O'Neill, the popular young actor, marries Mary Ellen Quinlan (\"Ella\"), daughter of his old friend Thomas J.

After her death, he made a note of it with the title \"Under the Elms\" and the date \"1922\":\"Play of New England-laid on farm in 1850, time of California gold rush-make N.E. farmhouse and elm trees almost characters.\" It had a \"hard father who has \"killed off wives (2) with work,\" along with \"3 sons-all hate him.\" The old man's \"possessive pride\" is in the farm because \"it is so hard.\" In his \"old age in moment of sensual weakness\" he manies a young woman and brings her back to the farm. The \"youngest son falls for her\" and brings on the tragedy. The clue to O'NeiU's grief lies in the California gold rush setting. Of course, the lust for possession is a central theme, and the gold rush expresses it, but O'Neill might have chosen another symbol for it, and later he did hesitate about whether to make it the Silver City silver rush. California and the gold rush won out because they came straight out of memories of his mother's death journey. At the beginning of January 1922 his mother and his brother Jamie had set out for California. No sooner had they anived than his mother was felled by a brain tumor. She was dead by February 28. They had gone to realize the money on a piece of property-suddenly booming in value-his father had bought out there years ago. The pursuit of his\n\nEugene O'Neill's Creative Struggle\n\nfather's money had powerful associations for O'Neill. He had always seen it as the gold buried on the island of Monte Cristo in the play that had made his father rich from years of staning in it. After his father died, he had written the family friend George C. Tyler that his mother was putting the estate in order: \"The treasures of Monte Cristo are buried deep again in prairie dog gold mines, in unlubricated oil wells,\" he said, but he hoped that with his mother's capable direction \"some dividends may finally accrue from the junk buried on the island of Monte Cristo.\" The modest allowance from his father during his wild years had always appeared to him a withholding of love, and he had always resented the odd investments in which his father had buried the money. Two of his early plays, Where the Cross Is Made (1918) and Cold (1920), had dealt with a son madly determined to go after his father's treasure of gold buried on a desert island--gold that ironically is actually \"junk.\" Out of these old associations his mother's fatal pursuit of his father's gold buried in California earth naturally transmuted itself for him into a tragedy of the California gold rush with death at the end. The plot had come to him with three sons, the number his mother had had, and dominated by the image of a house brooded over by two elm trees and pervaded by memories of two dead mothers. The description of the trees in the play shows that they were meant to express the pull out of the past of those two dead women: Two enormous elms are on each side of the house. They bend their trailing branches down over the roof. They appear to protect and at the same time subdue. There is a sinister maternity in their aspect, a crushing, jealous absorption. They have developed from their intimate contact with the life of man in the house an appalling humanness. They brood oppressively over the house. They are like exhausted women resting their sagging breasts and hands and hair on its roof, and when it rains their tears trickle down monotonously and rot on the shingles. The house is of a \"sickly grayish color with faded green shutters under its shingled roof, recalling the house in New London where O'Neill spent his boyhood summers, which also had gray paint and shutters and shingles. The extraordinary thing about the two maternal trees that brood over it and their association with two dead women is that O'Neill had actually had two mothers. He himself would draw up a \"Diagram\" of his early emotional life with three love lines in it: one for his father, and two more close together, one labeled \"mother love\" and the second labeled \"nurse love,\" connected to the other\n\nDesire Under the Elms\n\n23\n\nwith a line and the word \"meaning.\" So he had mother love from his actual mother and \"nurse love meaning mother love\" from his nurse Sarah Sandy. When he broke off both lines in adolescence, he terminated Sarah's with the words \"breaking away from nurse as mother value.\" His two mothers often mingled in his mind. He had called the ship that would get the father's gold in Where the Cross Is Made the \"Mary Allen,\" a name just one letter off his mother's name, \"Mary Ellen.\" In Gold the name combined both mothers to become the \"Sarah Allen.\" The dead spinster Sarah would be floating in the back of his mind when he wrote the square dance scene for Desire Under the Elms, for he had the fiddler call out to one of the guests, \"Ye're wallcin' like a bride down the aisle, Sarah! Waal, while they's life they's allus hope, I've heerd tell.\" So the two maternal trees and the two dead mothers of his 1922 plot emerged directly out of the double mother of his infancy, called up by his grief for his actual one. O'Neill did not spell out the \"tragedy\" of this first plot, but he must have had in mind the killing of the old man, and the subsequent immolation of the young lovers. It was so much the obvious ending for the love conflict that afterward, when O'Neill discarded it, he had to explain it away by having the woman realize confusedly, \"That's what I ought t' done, hain't it?\" But the murder of the old man did not interest O'NeiU. He tried to prod his thinking on the murderous rivalry of father and son by reading pertinent case histories in one of Wilhelm Stekel'c psychoanalytic books. It was early November 1923, and Malcolm Cowley I ,ened to be visiting him in his home at Ridgefield, Connecticut. As Cowley recalled, he talked of plans for a \"New England play and showed him Stekel's book, which, he said, had plots enough for \"all the playwrights who ever lived.\" He pointed out particularly-so Cowley recalled-the case record of a mother who seduced her son and drove him mad. (Actuallythe case-from Twelve Essays on Sex and Psychoanalysis-was closer to O'Neill's plot than Cowley remembered, for the seducing mother was really a stepmother, and the son in it was tom by conflicting thoughts of his good mother and his \"whore\" stepmother in a manner similar to O'NeiU's character.) But Stekel did not bring his idea to life. He needed something more meaningful than the murder of the old man to plunge him into participation. The plunge came when he woke up on New Year's morning in 1924 with his mind still ~ervadedby a dream. It gave him, he realized, just the right tragic ending for his play. It added Desire to the title, making it \"Desire Under the Elms.\" It added a baby to the characters and changed the tragedy to that of a mother who kills her baby to prove her greater love for its father. Like the first plot, this idea came out of his grief, for it recalls the major tragedy of his\n\n24\n\nEugene O'Neill's Creative Struggle\n\nmotheis life back in 1885, more than three years before he himself was born. His father, James O'Neill, had been on tour in Monte Cristo out west and had become desperately lonely for his wife, whom he had left in New York with the two children: Jamie, who was seven, and the baby Edmund. For love of her husband, Mary Ellen O'Neill left the two children with her mother and went out to join him. They had just reached Denver when they received a telegram telling them that the baby Edmund was mortally ill. She took the first train back on March 4, but he died that very day. The older boy had caught the measles, and her mother had carelessly allowed him to infect the baby. She felt that if she had been there she could have kept them apart. She felt she had killed the baby by abandoning him, and she was haunted by guilt for the rest of her life. Eugene O'Neill had been born into the dead baby's place. All his mother's bereavement had focused-so he wrote in a sketched \"family historyn-into a \"fierce concentration of affection\" for him. From that time on, he was her baby. She was still calling him \"my baby\" after he had a baby son of his own, Shane. She ended a letter to him with love for his wife, his baby, \"and the biggest baby of the three, You.\"So he was linked eternally to the dead baby whose place he had taken. When he came to write his autobiographical play Long Day's ]ourney into Night, he actually exchanged names with the dead baby, making the live son \"Edmund and the dead baby himself, \"Eugene.\" His brother Jamie had longed only to follow their mother into the grave, and he had had his wish-had succeeded in drinking himself to death-only a little less than two months before Eugene O'Neill dreamed his New Year's dream. The same wish was in the dream of the dead baby which brought the play to such urgent life for O'Neill that he started in on it at once. The dream had been fraught with his current feelings for his wife Agnes, who was-so he told her-\"mother of the best of me\" and whose baby he also was, as her letters to him show. \"My own dear big baby,\" she would write, urging him to take care of himself, or, \"You poor, poor dear baby,\" wanting to take care of him. Somewhere behind the dream of the beloved dead baby had lurked his growing unhappiness as the live baby of Agnes. He had founded his life on his love for her, but their marriage had been \"unhappy.\" He had said so after only two years of it, and after six, abysses of silence had begun to open between them, and more and more frequently destructive quarrels broke out between them. He had always felt uncertain of his wife's love. She had come to him out of a precociously complicated love past that made him doubt her. She herself was chronically jealous, and so she had always instinctively reassured herself of his love by provoking his jealousy. Besides, he had a basic\n\nDesire Under the Elms\n\n25\n\ndistrust of love because of his traumatic discovery at the age of fifteen that his mother was addicted to morphine. So great had been this shock to his faith in life and love that he had discontinued his mother's love line in his \"Diagram\" at this point. AU that basic distrust had been accentuated in his mamage, blending his feeling for his mother with his feeling for Agnes inextricably. Blended too were his feelings of guilt toward both his wife and his mother. He was convinced that his own birth had shattered his mother's health and made her vulnerable to addiction when her doctor prescribed morphine. He felt the same guilt in his mamage for all the pain that he caused his wife. So Agnes joined his mother to enter both into the dead mother of his play and into Abbie, the new \"Maw.\" O'Neill drew Eben's overall guilt toward his mother from his own, but the concrete example of it recalls Agnes at the time shortly after their marriage when they lived in her house at Point Pleasant on the New Jersey shore. She knew the house, so he had let her take care of the coal stoves, which- Agnes said-needed \"to be shaken down every day and the ashes taken out.\" Only after some time did he awake to the fact that the work was much too heavy for his fragde wife. Then, remorsefully, he took over. His remorse enters the play as Eben's haunted vision of his mother \"come back all cramped up t' shake the fire, an' carry ashes, her eyes weepin' an' bloody with smoke an' cinders same's they used t' be.\" Agnes enters into the stepmother too. Although O'Neill called this character \"Abbie\" because it is a typically New England name, he could never have chosen a name so close to his pet name for Agnes, \"Aggie,\" had not Abbie been imbued with his feeling for her. All his distrust of Agnes enters Eben's distrust of Abbie when she first enters his life, and after their union, when it sets off her proof of love by infanticide. The same distrust of Agnes invests Abbie as the betraying wife and pulls O'Neill into the betrayed old man. O'Neill found that he could use for Desire Under the Elms some ideas that he had used for a one-act play back in 1918 called The Rope. It had also been a farm play, and he had apparently based it on the story of a real farmer he knew, probably from the Truro area near his Provincetown summer home. O'Neill changed him from the fragile old lunatic of The Rope into a powerful patriarch for Desire Under the Elms but kept his other features. In both plays he is tall, gaunt, stoop-shouldered, and has very weak eyesight. He quotes scripture, often wrathfully. By hard work he has made his farm extraordinarily valuable for the area, but he is a miser and has an ugly history of driving an earlier wife to death. In The Rope he has had a second, much younger wife, who has been flagrantly unfaithful. She became the third wife, Abbie, of Desire Under the Elms. In both plays he has a hidden treasure of twenty-dollar gold pieces.\n\n26\n\nEugene O'Neill's Creative Struggle\n\nThe younger son of Desire Under the Elms digs it up from under the floorboards to buy out his brother's share in the farm with the boatfare to California. In The Rope the coins are attached to a noose the old man has set up in the barn, supposedly for his son to hang himself but actually to shower him with the gold. O'Neill's most intimate feelings toward his family had gone into The Rope, for it is an ironical version of the prodigal son story. During his wild years of wandering, O'Neill saw himself as a prodigal son, and he had longed for the prodigal's fated return to the love of his father. The idea of a return to love became permanently linked for him with his feeling of being the prodigal. When he was coming back to New London from Harvard to see his beloved Beatrice Ashe in the fall of 1914, he told her once to expect her \"Prodigal Bridegroom\" and another time to expect her \"Prodigal Husband.\" A year before he wrote The Rope, his own father had literally turned into the prodigal's father, for he had taken that role in The Wanderer, a play based on the parable in the Bible. O'Neill had watched him deliver the moving words \"For this my son was dead, and is alive again\" months before he put them into the mouth of the miser father in his play. Quite naturally all his ambivalent feelings for his own father had gone along with them: all the \"resentment & hatred (so labeled in his \"Diagram\") that he had felt when his father had exiled him to boarding school, all his longing for the love he had had before, all his later resentment at his father's miserly withholding of his \"gold,\" and all the longing to take it. In the play, the father's gold is actually waiting for his son, if he can triumph over his fear of the invitation to hang himself with the rope. Although the prodigal's mother has already died in The Rope, O'Neill found a way to bring his own mother into the play along with all his distrust of her. She enters in the form of a \"soft-minded\" child whose commonplace name is actually her own: \"Mary.\" The play opens with the child enacting a little pantomime with her doll strangely expressive of O'Neill's mother with her \"baby\" Eugene. (In The Great God B r m O'Neill would have his protagonist see his mother as a child and himself as her \"doll,\" and have him say, \"She played mother and child with me for many years.\") He gave the child Mary in The Rope his mother's \"fierce concentration of affection\" for her baby. Startled by a noise, she \"quickly snatches up the doll, which she hugs fiercely to her breast,\" and then she runs to hide. She is very like his picture of his mother Mary in his later autobiographical play Long Day's Journey into Night, who \"hugs him with a frightened, protective tenderness\" and hides herself in the depths of her drug addiction. Indeed, the \"soft-minded\" child stands in the place of his mother, soft-minded from the drug, and she gives herself away by\n\nDesire Under the Elms\n\n27\n\na curious parody of his mother's gestures. In Long Day'sJourney into Night he describes them: \"Her hands flutter up to pat her hair in their aimless, distracted way.\" Under the drug, she \"settles back in relaxed dreaminess, staring fixedly at nothing. Her arms rest limply along the arms of the chair.\" The child Mary is first seen \"staring fixedly\" at her doll, and her \"hands flutter about aimlessly in relaxed, flabby gesturesw-a combination of his mother's tremor with her limpness under the drug. It is this \"mother-child (O'Neill actually once called Beatrice that) who brings down the father's gold by swinging on the rope that the prodigal son feared to touch. At the play's end she is foolishly tossing the goldpieces one by one into the sea. If there is an \"unconscious\" substratum in all this, it reads like this: the father's gold (love), ardently desired by the son, goes to the mother, but it is \"thrown away\" on her, soft-minded as she is from the drug. Both O'Neill's mother and father, trailing the shapes that they had taken in The Rope, pushed their way into Desire Under the Elms. The miser father even takes on the same age at the end of the play as O'Neill's father when he died in 1920, seventy-six. He also takes on his actual vitality in his old age. Even as late as 1913, James O'Neill's interviewers were rapturous over \"the robust power of his features and the strength-physical and mental-that has made him what he is.\" An echo of the soft-minded child of The Rope sounds in the lines of Desire Under the Elms on the dead mother of Eben. His father comments on him: \"Soft-headed. Like his Maw.\" O'Neill's own father had thought that he was out of his head during his wild youth, and had always considered him \"a bundle of nerves like his mother.\" O'NeiU was so possessed by this oneness with her, and by thoughts of her death as he wrote, that he had the old man at one point threaten to take his shotgun to his son \"an' blow his soft brains t' the top o' them elums!\" That gives Eben-and O'Neill with him-a death like his mother's death of brain tumor. It merges his soft brains with hers (at the top of the maternal tree). If O'Neill's parents had haunted The Rope, written when they were both alive, they could only do so more intensely in Desire Under the Elms, written when they were both dead, his mother after his father, united with the dead baby Edmund in the New London earth. No wonder, then, that as he wrote, the house with its brooding elms became a haunted house, drenched in past sorrow, pervaded by the memory of the dead mother. The set shows all four rooms of the house with its elms, the sky, and a piece of the road, and O'Neill deliberately contrasted its haunted interior with the freedom and promise of the sky and road. The indoor scenes are all set in the shadows of twilight, dawn, or candlelit night. The dead mother pervades these shifting shadows, first in her kitchen where her son Eben sees her\n\nEugene O'Neill's Creative Struggle come back \"all cramped up\" to stand by her stove, and then even more palpably in the tomblike parlor-O'Neill says that it is like a \"tomb7'-where she was laid out. Even the old man senses the chill of her presence, \"droppin' off the elums, climbin' up the roof, sneakin' down the chimney, pokin' in the corners!\" By contrast, almost all the outdoor scenes are flooded with golden light. A golden sunset begins the play, and the opening lines link it with the longing for love and the gold in California. It is golden sunrise when the two older brothers break free of the farm and go capering off down the road bound \"fur the gold fields o' Californi-a.\" It is golden sunrise again when Eben and Abbie find love, and it is most intensely golden sunrise at the end of their tragedy when they stand for a moment, transfigured by love and sacrifice, \"looking up raptly in attitudes strangely aloof and devout.\" No one could have sensed more sharply than Eugene O'Neill the push of all these memories arising to direct his plot, his set, his dialogue. He was used to looking beyond the surface in himself and others. He had chosen the Swedish playwright Strindberg as his \"master,\" because Strindberg had led the way that he wanted to go with dramas that pierced the banal exterior of life to reveal the immense realities-psychological, biological, sociological-that work behind them. O'Neill had selected one of the most difficult of Strindberg's \"behindlife\" dramas, The Spook Sonata, for the very first production of a new theater group he had formed with Kenneth Macgowan and Robert Edmond Jones, and, even though he hated essay-writing, he took the trouble to write an explanation of Strindberg's greatness for the program. It would serve to prepare audiences for coming productions of his own plays by educating them to his intention to cut through surface realism. (The Spook Sonata had opened on January 3,1924, two days after his New Year's dream.) Of course, this was his intention in Desire Under the Elm. After it went on he told his friend George Jean Nathan: \"What I think everyone missed in 'Desire' is the quality in it I set most store by-the attempt to give an epic tinge to New England's inhibited life-lust, to make its inexpressiveness poetically expressive, to release it.\" He was not reproducing New England speech literally; he was \"trying,\" he said, \"to write a synthetic dialogue which should be, in a way, the distilled essence of New England.\" He had his characters speak in powerful fragments and piquant arrangements of New England cliches that convey their inexpressiveness yet become vivid poetry. The two older brothers sum up Eben and his belief that he is \"Maw-every drop o' blood!\" with an ironic refrain that comes up three times, each with variations: SIMEON. Like his Paw. PETER. Dead spit an' image! SIMEON. Dog'll eat dog!\n\nDesire U d r the Elm\n\n29\n\nO'Neill knew that a playwright works \"as Beethoven did\" (so he declared in an interview) \"molding tones, giving them color, new meaning, thus creating music.\" In the dialogue of Desire Under the Elms, O'Neill creates a musical theme and variations on the New England stones beginning with Peter's chant \"Here-it's stones atop o' the ground-stones atop o' stones,\" and going on to Eben's \"stone atop o' stone-makin' walls till yer heart's a stone,\" to reach a climax in the old man's \"God's in the stones! Build my church on a rock-out o' stones an' I'll be in them! That's what he meant t' Peter! Stones. I picked 'em up an' piled 'em into walls. Ye kin read the years o' my life in them walls, every day a hefted stone.\" Both in action and in words his characters recall the animals they live with. The older brothers come in from work \"like two friendly oxen\" and move clumsily toward their food, \"their bodies bumping and rubbing together.\" Simeon sees their escape from the farm as if they really were oxen: \"The halter's broke-the harness is busted-the fence bars is down-the stone walls air cmmblin' an' tumblin'! We'll be kickin' up an' tearin' away down the road!\" Going off to visit Min, the village prostitute, young Eben is \"all slicked up like a prize bull,\" and when he takes her for the first time he begins \"t' beller like a calf.\" AU the women- Min, Eben's Maw, and Abbie-are called cows. His characters see life as did the ancient agricultural civilizations that created all the mythical cow-mother goddesses and all the bull gods. O'Neill knew them from reading Sir James Frazer's The Golden Bough and Carl Jung's analysis of the myth-making unconscious in The Psychology of the Unconscious, the psychoanalytic book that had interested him most. He explained, \"I never intended that the language of that play should be a record of what the characters actually said. I wanted to express what they felt subconsciously.\" Subconsciously, all his characters make the age-old equation of the fertile woman with the fertile land. They see in the cultivation of the earth, just as all the ancient cults did, \"the fertilization of the mother.\" They think of the farm as a woman. Eben says that Min, the prostitute, \"smells like a wa'm plowed field,\" and when he takes her, a woman his father and his brothers have possessed before him, he is making his opening battle to possess his mother's farm. The new stepmother, Abbie, lusting for him, \"squirms desirously\" under the masculine sun, receiving it as if she were the fertile earth. \"Hain't the sun strong an' hot?\" she asks Eben pointedly. \"Ye kin feel it burnin' into the earthNature- makin' thin's grow- bigger an' bigger- burnin' inside ye-makin' ye want t' grow-into somethin' else.\" The old man looks upon her directly as the fertile earth that he possesses. He tells her: \"Sometimes ye air the farm an' sometimes the farm be yew!\" He pounds his fist on his knee, crying, \"Me an'\n\n30\n\nEugene O'Neill's Creative Struggle\n\nthe farm has got to beget a son!\" Eben takes possession of the farm by possessing Abbie. Coming upon his father right afterward, he reverses their roles and orders the old man to get to work. \"Ay-eh! I'm bossin' yew! Ha-ha-ha! See how ye like it! Ha-ha-ha! I'm the prize rooster o' this roost.\" The primeval life-lust creates mythlcal overtones in his characters so that their struggle takes on an \"epic tinge.\" He told George Jean Nathan, \"It's just that-the poetical (in the broadest and deepest sense)vision illuminating even the most sordid and mean blind alleys of life-which I'm convinced is, and is to be, my concern and justification as a dramatist. . . . It's where the poetic is buried deep beneath the dull and crude that one's deep-seeing vision is tested.\" Later, asked point-blank what Desire Under the E l m was all about, O'Neill answered, \" 'Desire,' briefly, is a tragedy of the possessive-the pitiful longing of man to build his own heaven here on earth by glutting his sense of power with ownership of land, people, money-but principally the land and other people's lives.\" He did shape his play with this idea in mind, and saw to it that his principal characters transcended their lust for possession through tragic suffering. But O'Neill himself realized instantly the inadequacy of his own explanation, and he added: \"Of course, there's more to it than that, and the above is so crude as to misrepresent, but it's the best I can do.\" Actually, the meaning of the play emerged from the directive push of the dead-baby dream working itself out within the channels of his theme of possessiveness. His memories formed no passive reservoir but a shaping force. Abbie is driven toward her tragic apotheosis by the same force that impelled O'Neill's mother toward hers. O'Neill derives her passion to possess the farm out of her bitterly homeless state. Homelessness had been his mother's agony. As a touring actor's wife, she had moved endlessly from one alien hotel room to another. In his \"family history,\" O'Neill said that \"her bitterest resentment\" against her husband had been \"that she never had [a] home.\" In Long Day's Journey into Night she attributes the baby's death to that, declaring, \"Women need homes, if they are to be good mothers.\" Abbie enters the play with a passionate utterance of the word \"Hum!\" and repeats almost the same words with a New England accent: \"A woman's got t' hev a hum!\" Within the play logic, she seduces her stepson primarily to get a baby that will give her title to the farm (with lust and pique intermixed). The seduction brings her love, so that when Eben discovers that his baby gives her the farm and furiously rejects her, she proves her greater love for him by killing the baby she loves. Out of the magnitude of her sacrifice for love, she rises to tragic exaltation. The scenes that deal with the baby's death were shaped by O'Neill's sense of oneness with the dead baby Edmund. He has the old man celebrate the birth\n\nDesire Under the Elms\n\n31\n\nof the baby with a square dance at which he flaunts his pride in begetting a son so late in life. The scene was called up in O'Neill by his own birth. In his \"family history\" he wrote of it: \"Husband very proud of his birth (confirmed by stories to me)-44 years old at time.\" The transfer of that pride from his forty-fouryear-old father to one seventy-six is enough to make it grotesque, but it is made far more so by the savage irony with which O'Neill designed these scenes. His picture of the old man dancing in triumph before his neighbors what is actually his disgrace emanated from a witches' brew of self-loathing and hatred in himself set off by this proxy vision of his birth (the birth that had caused-so he believed-his mother's addiction). The same witches' brew must have been boiling up in him twelve years before his dream of the dead baby, when he had tried to kill himself. That had been shortly after he supplied the evidence for his divorce from Kathleen Jenkins late in December 1911. It had been a New York divorce, with adultery the only legal grounds, and so he had had to arrange to be seen in bed with a prostitute by several witnesses. That degrading scene had demonstrated intolerably for him the mess he had made of life and love. After it, he had tried to kill himself with an overdose of sleeping tablets. Somewhere in that rush to die out of the loveless world in which he found himself must have been the desire to become what his brother Edmund had always been, his mother's eternally beloved baby. That desire had created his New Year's dream, and so he merged both the baby's birth and his death with his own. Abbie's words on it are redolent of his own suicide attempt: \"I left the piller over his little face. Then he killed himself. He stopped breathin'.\" The old suicidal pull drew O'Neill more powerfully now that becoming the dead baby meant joining his mother in the grave. That pull sweeps Eben to his tragic end. His is the greatest triumph over possessiveness and the greatest sacrifice for love. Abbie's sacrifice had aimed at possessing him, but his sacrifice of farm, liberty, and life is directed only at sharing her suffering in \"prison 'r death 'r hell.\" Through Eben's tragic end, O'Neill shares with his mother the guilt for the dead baby that proved her love for his father and at the same time is united to her forever as the dead baby. So powerful was this drive toward a reunion in death that it almost broke into complete expression before the tragic climax of the play during the scene in which Abbie and Eben are joined in love. Within the play logic, he takes her in the parlor haunted by his dead mother because the act revenges his mother on his father. But the union vibrates with overtones of a consummation in death. It takes place in a room that looks like \"a tomb in which the family has been interred alive.\" (O'Neill's whole family was in the grave as he wrote.) Its candles summon up the image of Eben's Maw laid out in death, and he takes his new Maw in her name. This initial union\n\n32\n\nEugene O'Neill's Creative Struggle\n\nwith her foreshadows the ultimate union at the end of the tragedy, when he joins her in death. Those final moments reveal the ultimate aim of that drive toward death. Logically, the Sheriff (alerted by Eben in his first horror at the murder of the baby before his love triumphs) enters at the last as a mere dramatic device to carry the lovers off at the apotheosis of their sacrifice. Actually he comes out of the very heart of the dream wish. O'Neill gives him a quite unnecessary personal name, which rings out with peculiar insistence in the last few lines of the play. It turns out to be that commonplace name-so redolent of meaning for O'Neill-his father's name, \"Jim.\" It is pronounced three times in the space of a few seconds and emerges yet again in the last words of the play, in which the story logic meets the dream logic: \"It's a jim-dandy farm, no denyin'. Wished I owned it!\" By joining the mother in death through his protagonist, O'Neill is taken up with her into the eternal custody of a father figure in authority (like James O'Neill, who was usually called \"the Governor\" among theater friends), and he actually bears O'Neill's father's name, \"Jim.\" The image emerges wordlessly out of O'Neill's earliest image of felicity in love. As a real baby, he had been doubly encircled in love, first in the protective arms of his mother and then along with her, in the greater love of his father, that \"indefinite hero\" of his infancy (so O'Neill called him in his \"Diagram\"). The same image had inspired his plays of the son who strives to attain his father's gold by way of a mother ship. Eben is impelled by O'Neill's own longing to join his mother in love and death and so attain eternal custody by his father. With such a powerful death-urge sweeping through his play, O'Neill might easily have been swept along with it. But he was writing drama, the essence of which is conflict, and so he could struggle against it within his play. He fought out his battle by way of his warring father and son. Their clash represents all the life forces in Eugene O'Neill struggling against the lure of death. O'Neill had been drawn into both characters-in part-because he had a powerful sense of being both father and son at this time. He was living among the stony Connecticut farms of Ridgefield, which called up his boyhood New London, Connecticut, summer home surrounded by fields a long walk over the railroad trestle away from the town. \"I have a place at New London where I bury stones in the summer,\" his father had said of it. Eugene O'Neill had raised chickens as a boy, and now his son Shane repeated him, running about with his pet rooster. His other son from his first marriage, Eugene Jr., had been staying for the Christmas holidays with him just before he dreamed his New Year's dream, and he arranged a ticket for him to see The Spook Sonata when he returned to school in New York, just as his own father had arranged New York theater tickets\n\nDesire Under the Elms\n\nfor him when he was a boy at school in Stamford, Connecticut. He also had vivid recollections of his father in his roles as the father of the biblical prodigal son in The Wanderer and even more as the patriarch Jacob in the play Joseph and His Brethren, in which he had toured from 1913 to 1915.(Echoes of the Joseph story crept into Desire Under the Elms, such as in Abbie's advances toward Eben and her revenge when repulsed by accusing the boy, which recall Potiphar's wife with Joseph.) All that winter O'Neill had been reading the Old Testament to himself. He later told Lawrence Langner: \"Ridgefield always drove me to hard cider, acidosis, and the Old Testament in the weepy, muddy, slush-and-snow days.\" He was also writing a \"Book of Revelation\" adaptation from the New Testament when he dreamed his New Year's dream. (Robert Edmond Jones wanted to use it as a medium for experiment with dance movements as theatrical expression.) Finishing it had kept him from starting in on Desire Un&r the Elms after the dream. When he did begin, on January 15,he fit smoothly into the scripture-quoting old man of his play. This character had originally been conceived as the most possessive of all, one who could gladly set fire to the farm when he died so as to h o w that \"it was all a-dying with me an' no one else'd ever own what was mine, what I'd made out o' nothin' with my own sweat an' blood!\" But, as O'Neill wrote, old Ephraim came virtually to transcend the possessiveness that dominates him because he values the farm, not for itself but for its expression of his own creative power. \"When ye kin make corn sprout out o' stones, God's livin' in yew!\" he says. Ephraim takes on grandeur because O'Neill's most intimate life philosophy flowed into him. Whereas Eben had been impelled to his tragic destiny by O'Neill's sense of oneness with his mother, Ephraim became impelled by O'Neill's realization that he was also \"spit an' image\" of his strongwilled father. He had early absorbed the striving spirit that had transformed his father from a poor Irish immigrant file-cutter with a heavy brogue into a prominent actor-manager famous for the beauty of his diction. James O'Neill's anecdotes all stress his enthusiasm for overcoming limitations and triumphing over difficulties. One of his favorites had the dying Charlotte Cushman advising him-after their last tour together-to \"work, work, WORK!\"He made a creed of that \"work, work, WORK!\" He often told of his flat failure when he first stepped into the role of Monte Cristo with no time to rehearse, and of how he got at the part \"hammer and tongs\" to convert it into success. O'Neill had taken over the striving philosophy of his \"Hero Father\" (so called in his \"Diagram\"). At eighteen he had discovered Friedrich Nietzsche's Thus Spake Zarathustra, and he went on to reread it almost every year of his life thereafter. Its philosophy of striving to create and live by higher values, he found, blended easily into\n\nEugene O'Neill's Creative Struggle\n\nhis heritage from his father. Nietzsche has a dialogue between a diamond and a piece of charcoal over the virtues of hardness and softness, with the diamond being hard as all \"creators are h a r d and suggesting the new commandment: \"Become hard!\" O'Neill had accepted that commandment, and the hard, the d i j j b l t , became his object. Outlining his ideal program for life, he described it as \"years of undisturbed hard and difficult work.\" In his program explanation of The Spook Sonata, he said that they had chosen it because \"the difficult is properly our special task.\" \"Easy\" was his favorite term of contempt. He insisted: \"Truth, in the theatre as in life, is eternally difficult just as the easy is the everlasting lie.\" He never had forgotten his father's regrets in his old age at missing his opportunity to become a great Shakespearean actor. O'Neill thought that he had given in to the lure of \"easy\" popularity and money with Monte Cristo, and he swore on his deathbed to \"remain true to the best that is in me though the heavens fall.\" He knew he could go on writing one successful Anna Christie after another, but he declared scathingly, \"It would be too easy!\" He meant to follow his dream unsweningly so that \"my real significant bit of truth, and the ability to express it, will be conquered in time-not tomorrow nor the next day nor any near, easily-attained period, but after the struggle has been long enough and hard enough to merit victory.\" He put this entire creative philosophy into the old man of his play, even to his own way of using the words \"hard and \"easy.\" Ephraim says: When I come here fifty odd year ago-I was jest twenty an' the strongest an' hardest ye ever seen-ten times as strong an' fifty times as hard as Eben. Waal-this place was nothin' but fields o' stones. Folks laughed when I tuk it. They couldn't know what I bowed. When ye kin make corn sprout out o' stones, God's livin' in yew! They wa'n't strong enuf fur that! They reckoned God was easy. They laughed. They don't laugh no more. . . . They're all underground-fur follerin' arter an easy God. God hain't easy. As O'Neill rejected easy wealth from repeating plays like Anna Christie, Ephraim has rejected the easy money he could have had from farming the fertile lands out west. \"I could o' been a rich man-but somethin' in me fit me an' fit me-the voice o' God sayin': 'This hain't wuth nothin' to' Me!' \" He sums up O'Neill's faith as a creator in four words: \"God's hard, not easy!\" O'Neill gave the old man his own loneliness as a creator-his own loneliness as a man. Ephraim is \"allus lonesome\" because everyone covets the farm he has created \"without knowin' what it meant.\" O'Neill had experienced that\n\nDesire Under the Elms\n\n35\n\nloneliness deeply in his marriage. Agnes had felt crushed by his triumph as a writer, which was so much greater than her own. Yet she never could grasp his advice to write only out of the best that was in her, and instead had been turning out easy items for money. The abyss between their viewpoints became ever wider; silence divided them. O'Neill put all the pathos of his own \"inexpressiveness\" into his lonely and betrayed old New Englander's one effort to break his silence and communicate his deepest thinking to his wife. She does not hear a word of it, absorbed as she is in her own designs. Bitterly, the old man tells her to pray \"fur understandin'.\" He foreshadows O'Neill's words to Agnes when all was over between them: \"But what do you understand of me or I of you?\" Into the old man too he put his own realization of his tragic possessivenessparticularly in love. The fiercely repeated \"my\" and \"mine\" of his characters came right out of his own self-knowledge. His ktters to Agnes call her \"My Own\" or \"Own Sweetheart\" or \"Own little wife.\" He had been struggling throughout their maniage to adapt to her need for superficial socializing and to accept the invasions of Ridgefield by her impecunious family or casual friends. He did not feel he had conquered it until they moved to their Bermuda home later, and then he told her: \"I love Spithead-and not with my old jealous bitter possessiveness-my old man Cabotism!-but as ours, not mine except as mine is included in ours.\" He had given old Ephraim Cabot his own possessiveness in love, which echoed his father's. In the \"family history\" O'Neill describes his father as \"morbidly jealous of her, even of her affection for children\" when he took his wife from them and Edmund died. O'Neill knew he had within him the same \"jealous bitter possessiveness.\" His sense of himself as \"spit an' image\" of his father shaped old Ephraim Cabot and determined his end. So powerful was that sense of his father as a directive ideal working within him that he contradicts Ephraim's history in the play to make him fulfill it. His father had been for him the supreme example of romantic married love. He had held him up as a model to live by when he wrote Agnes from his deathbed of the enduring power of his love for his wife. He had been, O'NeiU said, \"a husband to marvel at.\" Despite Ephraim's history of working his former wives to death, O'Neill converts him into a standard and model for love. He says of the dead baby, \"He'd ought t' been my son, Abbie. Ye'd ought t' loved me. I'm a man. If ye'd loved me, I'd never told no Sheriff on ye no matter what ye did, if they was t' brile me alive!\" (At his father's funeral O'Neill had heard William F. Connor sum up James O'Neill as \"a man in every sense and in the noblest interpretation of the word.\") It is Ephraim who grudgingly praises Eben for his decision to share Abbie's guilt. \"Purty good-fur yew!\" he says. Although O'Neill devoted the last moment of his play to his exalted lovers walking \"hand\n\n36\n\nEugene O'Neill's Creative Struggle\n\nin hand\" out of life, the most impressive final figure is that of the old man, bereft of love and money, relinquishing an impulse to follow his elder sons to California and going back to work with the words \"Waal-what d'ye want? God's lonesome, hain't He? God's hard an' lonesome!\" If, in the end, the old man took on the most pronounced epic tinge of all, it was because O'Neill put into him his own philosophy of work, taken up from his father, and it was that philosophy beyond everything else that bound him to life. Through Ephraim all the life forces in Eugene O'Neill .triumph over the lure of death. O'Neill knew well how much of himself had gone into this character. He said, \"I have always loved Ephraim so much! He's so autobiographical!\" If Eugene O'Neill found a theater ready for this play of adultery and infanticide in 1924 America, he did so only because he had taken care to create the theater for it. He had been the prime mover in resurrecting Jig Cook's Provincetown Playhouse and bringing to it the fresh creative talents of Kenneth Macgowan and Robert Edmond Jones. A fluny of productions in their new theater had actually split the writing of Desire Under the Elms into two distinct parts. O'Neill had just finished part one at the end of January when he was swept into rehearsals for no less than four of his plays: Welded, All Cod's Chillun Cot Wings, The EmperorJones (a revival with Paul Robeson, who would also take the lead in All Cod's Chillun Got Wings),and an adaptation of Coleridge's Rime of the Ancient Mariner (like his adaptation of the last book of the New Testament, which he called the \"Book of Revelation,\" for Robert Edmond Jones to experiment with dance movement). Not until May 24 could O'Neill get back to Desire Under the Elms. He finished it on June 16, 1924, and a week later he was reading it to his'partners Kenneth Macgowan and Bobby Jones in a hospital where Jones happened to be \"laid up.\" They decided to open Desire Under the Elms that fall in their Greenwich Village theater and fill the smaller Provincetown Playhouse with a revival of four of O'Neill's one-act sea plays combined into a cycle to be called \"S.S. Glencairn.\" Rehearsals got under way October 18. O'Neill found himself, as often before, rushing from play to play, with Desire Under the Elms rehearsing all morning and afternoon and \"S.S. Glencairn\" in the evening. They were painfully handicapped by lack of time and money. Even a brilliant set designer like Bobby Jones could not, in such short time, create elms redolent of a \"sinister maternity\" which would participate in the play like characters. (In the opening scene, for instance, they were to glow green to make the house they oppress \"pale and washed out by contrast.\") Neither the elms nor \"the house as character\" with its \"flow of life from room to room\" came through as\n\nDesire Under the Elms\n\nO'Neill knew they could. He had divided each of the three parts of his play into four quick scenes punctuated by moments of darkness. Unfortunately, in performance, these were extended to intermissions with lights turned up in the theater. Later, he declared, \"It ruined my idea in 'Desire Under the Elms,' that lights up business! What I want is black out, curtain down, change made in a few seconds, curtain up, then lights again.\" In compensation, O'Neill was delighted with Walter Huston's acting in the role of the old man. It was, he said, \"exactly what I had in mind.\" He added: ''Walter's work was as fine as any I've seen in a theatre. He was infinitely superior to Mary Monis [as Abbie], who was good in sections but had nothing to contribute but stock acting and pumped emotion when something deeply passionate was demanded. The part canied her a lot of the time. Yet it was Mary who made the biggest hit with the public, who received most publicity and critical praise.\" They opened on November 11, and the first-night critics did their best to kill the play. Most of them thought it a \"gruesome morbid thing. It was the subscription audiences who turned it into a success. When they moved uptown to the Earl Carroll Theater in January, the District Attorney of New York, Joab Banton, provoked a sudden run on their box office by attacking the play as obscene and threatening to close it. Later that year, when O'Neill payed his dentist, Dr. Lief, he remarked humorously, \"But don't thank me, thank that so-amiable District Attorney! Seriously though, his pressagent work is bad in the long run. It attracts the low-minded, looking for smut, and they are highly disappointed or else laugh wherever they imagine doublemeanings.\" The threat to close was opposed so vigorously by those who saw the play's greatness that Banton finally agreed to submit the question to a play jury, which the Authors League had suggested as a way of getting censorship out of the hands of ignorant officials and into those of people competent to judge. When the jury cleared it, laughingly O'Neill said to Kenneth Macgowan: \"All's well what ends in publicity only.\" In the midst of the Banton uproar O'Neill had asked his agent, Richard Madden: \"Do you have to send in script of 'Desire' to committee to make it eligible for Pulitzer Prize? If so, do so. Of course, I know there's no chance for it, but I do, for the sake of principle, want to make them pass it up.\" They did pass it up. The prize went to Sidney Howard's comedy They Knew What They Wanted, which had opened at about the same time. Howard's own judgment was better. He had rushed to O'NeiU's defense during the Banton threat with a letter to the New York Times (December 14, 1924) in which he said, \"I only ask to be shown anything produced in the English-speaking theatre of recent generations\n\nEugene O"
