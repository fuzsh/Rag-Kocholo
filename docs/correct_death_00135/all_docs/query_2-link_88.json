        "text": "4 I am very grateful to Susan Naulty, of the Rare Books Department of the Huntington Library, for generously allowing me access to this collection and in many ways helping me to understand and make use of the materials. The papers were officially turned over to the Huntington in 1987, where they are being catalogued and prepared for use by qualified scholars. The collection should be fully accessible by 1990. The 118 scrapbooks cover the entire history of the Playhouse until its cessation of activity in the late 1950s, as well as a file of around 5000 photographs. There are 73 document case boxes of production files (programs, clippings, and promotional material)—44 for mainstage productions, 18 for non-mainstage, 6 oversize boxes; also, one box of material related to the Savoy Players, Gilmor Brown's professional group that preceded the formation of the Pasadena Community Players, and 10 boxes of School publications, records, and photographs. There are also 5 to 7 boxes of photographs (mainly negatives) by one of the Playhouse's commissioned photographers, C. Gordon Spalding. There are 12 file drawers of correspondence, including some portion of the files of Gilmor Brown, Fairfax Proudfit Walkup (Dean of Students), and Earl Messer (long-time secretary of the Board of Trustees). Finally, there is a ledger book recording Playhouse productions (cf. note 104). (A small collection of papers at UCLA, concerning the efforts made in the 1960s to solve the financial difficulties of the Playhouse and reopen it as a theatre, supplements the Huntington collection and completes the organization's entire history until its recent reopening.)\n\nThe clipping books of the Pasadena Community Playhouse contain pasted clippings in roughly chronological order, often with a stamped date (presumably supplied by a professional clipping service or by someone on the staff of the Playhouse). Almost always the clippings are presented apart from or without a printed title of the periodical, but usually a stamped title is attached or the title is handwritten. I have trusted the accuracy of these identifying devices, except where it was practical to check. Occasionally the title of the article is incomplete or missing; only rarely does a page number appear. In these notes, I include whatever bibliographical information is available and always refer to the volume and page number of the scrapbook where the clipping appears, indicating first the volume number, then the page number (volume: page).\n\n18 “The Great World Theatre,” Theatre Arts Monthly, Vol. XI, No. 3 (March 1927), p. 163. Most of the negotiations on this ultimately unsuccessful venture can be gleaned in the papers of the Kenneth Macgowan Collection at UCLA, which contains virtually all of the correspondence coming from Chicago and carbons of many of Macgowan's responses, as well as the contract and other materials. There is also a carbon of a letter from Macgowan to O'Neill that is not included in TWWF, detailing nuts and bolts of the Chicago negotiations. At this time the Chicago Play Production Company was trying to persuade Macgowan and possibly O'Neill to join its board in an advisory capacity. Macgowan seems to have agreed to this. The terms of the eventual contract were 5% on the first $4,000 of gross, 7.5% on the next $2,000, and 10% on everything over $6,000. The rights were limited to Chicago. A four week guarantee was discussed. It is clear that some actors were signed, some were even on payroll; by January 1927, they expected the production to get under way at any moment. One interesting detail was that Gering agreed to leave all film rights out of the deal. Also, at one point the Chicagoans suggest that Reinhardt direct the project in Chicago, then take the American production to Germany! What better way to show the world the strength of the American theatre? One term of negotiation that was disputed back and forth was the amount of money the CPPC was willing to commit to a budget. Initially, Gering was willing to undersign $20,000, but Macgowan insisted on $30,000. The CPPC produced a tentative budget, listing 5–7 thousand for sets, 4.5–7.5 for costumes, 2–3 for masks, and 3–4 for properties. The budget, which totaled $31–38,000, also mentioned $3,000 for Geddes' fee, $500 for the composer, and $ 1,500 for the Advisory Counsel (i.e., Macgowan). Toward the end of the negotiations it becomes clear that the board has lost confidence in Gering as its director; there is talk of replacing him with B. Iden Payne (Director of the Goodman Theatre). Finally, in February 1927, CPPC proposes to postpone the production until October, and the project collapses.\n\n43 A superficial and incomplete study of Brown, Gilmor is available in Gilmor Brown: Portrait of a Man—And an Idea by Green, Harriet L. (Burns Printing Co.: Pasadena, 1933).Google Scholar A similar work on the Pasadena Playhouse is Book of the Pasadena Community Playhouse, ed. Green, Harriet L., assisted by Chapinand, Robert F.Marshall, Everett C. (Pasadena Playhouse Press, 1934).Google Scholar A more recent study by Alexander, Diane, Foreword by Burr, Raymond, Playhouse (Los Angeles: Dorleac-MacLeish, 1984)Google Scholar is filled with good anecdotes, especially of the later years of the organization, and first-hand reports by many of the stars who have worked at the Playhouse, but it is not properly a history and occasionally falls short on accuracy. Most important is a 1968 UCLA dissertation by Shoup, Gail Leo Jr, “The Pasadena Community Playhouse: Its Origins and History from 1917 to 1942.” Oral histories of Gilmor Brown (covering only his early life and the very early years of the Playhouse)Google Scholar, Lenore Shanewise, and several others connected with the theatre are also available at UCLA.\n\n52 The masks of the principals were built by students from Chouinard Art School, those of the chorus by UCLA art students. See “Remembering the Pasadena Playhouse: Lenore Shanewise,” interviewed by Bernard Galm in 1974 (UCLA Oral History Program, 1980 transcript). Shanewise reports that the masks were later destroyed in a warehouse fire. On the subject of the double-sized masks, O'Neill wrote to Macgowan, : “My objective was to approximate the effect of the Greek masks and give plenty of room for a megaphone effect inside the mouths that would give a distinctive volume & sound to the chanting and help to carry across each word distinctly… My notion was that the masks should be double in every sense—the Chorus as utterly distinct (visually) from the crowd…a strange & unreal intensification of the crowd… But remember the megaphone… The Chorus chant must sound different from the chant of Crowd” (TWWF, p. 148).Google Scholar Shanewise recalls that the masks ‘of the crowd muffled the voices too much, and holes had to be cut into the masks (quoted in Alexander, , Playhouse, p. 99).Google Scholar Monroe Lathrop noted that the effect of “weird unreality” created by the masks was “heightened still further with the muffling of voices behind the masks to hollow, sepulchral tones” (Lathrop, , Los Angeles Evening Express, April 10, 1928 (10:61)).Google Scholar\n\n69 Rall, Pearl, “Theaters,” Saturday Night, April 14, 1928 (10: 89)Google Scholar; Hollywood Magazine, April 27, 1928 (10: 99). On opening night, the performance ran from 8:15 (moved from the usual 8: 30) until after midnight; Brown claimed the piece was originally three and a half hours long, from which he cut one half hour—he did not indicate how he managed to do so. See “Lazarus Laughed,” Variety, April 18–28, 1928 (10: 86), and also “Irving Pichel Has Role at Playhouse,” Pasadena Star-News, April 13, 1928 (10: 69). A letter from Irving Pichel to Kenneth Macgowan on April 10, 1928, says the “first performance ran till exactly midnight. We will gain half an hour on intermissions and on early start to-night” (Macgowan Collection, UCLA). Runyon, in the Pasadena Evening Post, April 10, 1928, wrote: “never was more sincere applause given to any body of actors than that which followed the first scene of this interesting play. It could have ended there and rested on the laurels of being one of the greatest of one-act plays. But it didn't end and we were glad it didn't. However, it should have ended sooner than it did” (10: 60). According to the playbill, the interval between the second and third scenes required five minutes, and ten minutes were taken at the mid-point; otherwise, the breaks were all of three minutes.\n\n70 The critic for Los Angeles' Saturday Night, Pearl Rall, theorized that “the children [Miriam] had borne him, long dead, were ever in her mind, so that the creed of constant joy was hard to accept” (April 14, 1928 (10: 89)). Egil Tornqvist quotes a few of O'Neill's notes on this character; she is sad “with the aged sadness of her race” and cannot laugh “because of her memory of the grief when he [Lazarus] was dead and her fear of his dying again” (A Drama of Souls (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1969), p. 170n). Part of the ad copy used during the 1929 revival suggests another interpretation: “Poor, frightened but loyal Miriam following timidly behind the resurrected Lazarus, feels fate's clutching hand closing about her heart, yet she goes on into the swirl of the mob, into the iniquitous den of Caesar—and dies, only to live— ‘There is no death’” (Pasadena Star-News, April 11, 1929 (12: 246)). Shanewise was Associate Director of the theatre at this time; over about 40 years with the company she directed some 150 productions, acted in many others, and taught in the school.\n\n99 Letter dated April 10,1928, published under the title “Regarding ‘Lazarus Laughed,’” New York Times, April 15, 1928, sec. 9, p. 4. Edgar B. Davis was a Texas oil millionaire who produced a play called The Ladder in 1926. The play did not succeed, but Davis kept it open, making it free to all comers, for nearly a year and a half, losing some $750,000 (cf. Show Biz from Vaude to Video by Abel Green and Joe Laurie, Jr. (New York: Henry Holt Company, 1951), pp. 298–99. Atkinson's book review said the play “recovers some of the primordial impulses of drama” and “takes rank with heroic poetry,” adding: “Each one of Mr. O'Neill's plays pushes further away from literature to the theatre of movement and sound. If ‘Lazarus Laughed’ seems a little turgid to the reader, it should be strangely grand to the playgoer if the script can be brought to life behind the footlights as Mr. O'Neill has planned it” (Brooks Atkinson, J., “Man's Challenge to Death in ‘Lazarus Laughed,’” New York Times, November 27, 1927, sec. 4, p. 5.)Google Scholar O'Neill thanks Macgowan for his letter on April 27 (TWWF, p. 175)).\n\n104 All of this information came from a ledger book in the Huntington Collection that lists all mainstage productions from 1917–18 through 1955–56, giving attendance figures and gross from 1921–22 on. Expenses are listed for some of the productions from 1923 through 1926. The ledger is divided into ten sections—Main Stage; East & West Balcony; Patio; Playbox; Television Plays; Radio; School Assemblies; State Players Theater; Tournament One-Act Plays; Coleman Concerts—and includes titles and grosses for many of the non-mainstage events. The gross receipts for 1927–28 were $127,337.09 for 315 performances of 27 productions, which can be compared with $105,988.28 for 292 performances of 30 plays the year before, and $102,972.07 for 312 performances of 25 plays the year following.\n\nThe treasurer's report for 1927–28 showed that receipts exceeded disbursements by $9515, but “dues for various forms of membership” came to $9691, so the Playhouse came within $ 176 of meeting its operating expenses through the box office. Total operating budget for the year was reported as around $100,000. By means of gifts and other sources of revenue the “funded debt” was reduced by $7,500 (“Playhouse Year Successful,” California Graphic, July 7, 1928(10: 211))."
