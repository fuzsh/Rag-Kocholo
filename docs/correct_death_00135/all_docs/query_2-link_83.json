        "text": "“We are such things as rubbish is made of, so let’s drink up and forget it.”\n\n― Eugene O’Neill, Long Day’s Journey into Night\n\n“We are such stuff as dreams are made on” – William Shakespeare’s The Tempest. The line appears in Act IV, Scene 1.\n\nThis parody of Shakespeare’s famed line befits the Irish Bard of pain, misery, and drunkenness. Harold Bloom even though he didn’t much like Eugene O’Neill’s worldview based as it was on Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and Freud would give him an underhand compliment as the progenitor of American Drama. Before O’Neill there was nothing of repute on the stage worth notice.\n\n“O’Neill would appear to be the most non-Emersonian author of any eminence in our literature. Irish-American through and through, with an heroic resentment of the New England Yankee tradition, O’Neill from the start seemed to know that his spiritual quest was to undermine Emerson’s American religion of self-reliance.”\n\nI’ve read and reread O’Neill most of my adult life, watched some of the best adaptations in screen and stage (Chicago theatre, not Off-Broadway!). I agree with Bloom’s estimation of O’Neill’s undermining of Emersonianism with its incessant optimism and up-beat American myth of exceptionalism and transcendence. Not sure if O’Neill ever read the late Emerson whose Conduct of Life essays would turn against his own optimistic heritage, but that is no import, what we have is the inheritor of that ancient lineage of pessimism found in Sophocles. O’Neill would return us to Sophocles and the pessimism of Racine among others for his dramatic thought on that irrational force that conquers us all. Only that old curmudgeon, Robert Penn Warren, the Agrarian conservative of the Old South clap track would be more anti-Emersonian. Unlike Warren, O’Neill would not pretend to political prophet, but rather keep to the loner, the solitary nihilist on the edge and margins of life: the drunk, loser, and all those failed and broken creatures that emerge from the hinterlands of the American Nightmare.\n\n“Happy roads is bunk. Weary roads is right. Get you nowhere fast. That’s where I’ve got—nowhere. Where everyone lands in the end, even if most of the suckers won’t admit it.”\n\n― Eugene O’Neill, Long Day’s Journey into Night\n\nTalking of O’Neill’s The Iceman Cometh Bloom suggest the play’s “true argument is that your own soul cannot be possessed, whether by possessing something or someone outside it, or by joining yourself to a transcendental possibility, to whatever version of an Emersonian Oversoul that you might prefer. The United States, in O’Neill’s dark view, was uniquely the country that had refused to learn the truths of the spirit, which are that good and the means of good, love and the means of love, are irreconcilable.” (Bloom’s Critical Views) In a world where transcendence is a inherent myth handed down from the times of the Greeks and Romans, central to the whole Judeo-Christian worldview, we are left in our secular world of atheistic and Enlightenment humanism within an immanent cosmos of nihilism where there is no escape, no reprieve, no exit.\n\nO’Neill was a metaphysical nihilist, whose desperate faith in art, and phantasmagoric naturalism left him in a world bereft of hope and any promise of transcendence. A solitary voyager of our nihilism he would stare into the abyss, but nothing would stare back of its silent black void. “His strength was neither in stance nor style, but in the dramatic representation of illusions and despairs, in the persuasive imitation of human personality, particularly in its self-destructive weaknesses.” (Bloom) We see this in the various family tragedies and in his own life. Bloom’s Gnosticism is not O’Neill’s tragic view, but the notion that O’Neill’s characters live in the kenoma – the great emptiness of things seems fitting in its nihilistic vectors. Comparing him to Beckett he states: “All that O’Neill and Beckett have in common is Schopenhauer, with whom they share a Gnostic sense that our world is a great emptiness, the kenoma, as the Gnostics of the second century of the common era called it.”\n\nHis biography tells us,\n\nIn the winter of 1952, the intolerable possibility that some intrepid director might produce what he’d finished off his Cycle after his death moved O’Neill to a desperate act: he and Monterey must destroy the manuscripts. For hours, according to Monterey, they tore the pages up into little pieces, and she flung them into a fire. “It was awful,” she recalled. “It was like tearing up children.” After that, he lost any will to live. “He died when he could no longer work,” Monterey said. “He died spiritually. And it was just a matter of dragging a poor, diseased body along for a few more years until it too died.” All the while, O’Neill refused any comfort from the possibility of God or an afterlife. “When I’m dying,” he’d insisted, “don’t let a priest or Protestant minister or Salvation Army captain near me. Let me die in dignity. Keep it as simple and brief as possible. No fuss, no man of God there. If there is a God, I’ll see Him and we’ll talk things over.”1\n\nThe irony of that last sentence seems fitting for a man who did not believe in God. A nihilist joke at having been born into a Catholic world he hated and yet could not escape."
