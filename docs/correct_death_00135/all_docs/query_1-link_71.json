        "text": "Eugene O’Neill, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, has been called “The father of modern drama” His outstanding play, “The Iceman Cometh” was last produced in 2018 on Broadway with Denzel Washington in the lead. The work tells the story of a number of alcoholic dead-enders who live together in a flop house above a New York saloon and what happens to them when the most outwardly \"successful\" of them embraces sobriety and reveals that he has been on the run after murdering his \"beloved\" wife.\n\nI have carried out a study of O’Neill’s manuscripts in progress for the play—together with interviews of his wife, Carlotta O'Neill, on his biographical information regarding the actual writing period—in order to isolate specific findings about the creative process itself. The study revealed that O'Neill was absorbed with thoughts of committing infidelity as well as having sexual problems during the time of writing the play. None of the major reviews and critical or psychiatric studies of the play refers to such an issue; only one suggests a related idea that the play's theme is that love is an illusion. Most studies focus on the theatrical presentation of alcoholism and its connection with O'Neill's life history. Although this play surely is about alcoholism, and O'Neill's own history of alcoholism was involved, the data about his thoughts and concern with committing infidelity during the writing process led me in other directions.\n\nThat finding suggested an important and quite specific link between O’Neill’s early \"Tomorrow\" story, a beloved friend and story character Jimmy Bythe's suicide, and his decision to write the play. In \"Tomorrow,\" Jimmy had committed suicide because of remorse over his wife's infidelity. He had confided first to Art—the character representing O'Neill himself—but Art had in response fallen silent and gone downstairs. Following that, the thud of Jimmy's body resounded in the backyard. Anyone exposed to such an experience would surely feel quite guilty about not having responded to Jimmy and somehow prevented the suicide. Whether this was realistically possible or not, O'Neill himself apparently felt such guilt. Unresolved feelings of responsibility and guilt could then have been directly linked to his conflict about infidelity. If, however, he could feel that the real Jimmy Bythe had wanted his wife to be unfaithful, he would have felt absolved from blame about the suicide.\n\nGuilt about suicide is depicted concretely in the play through the relationship of the major characters Larry and Parritt. Parritt constantly badgers Larry in the play until Larry finally tells him to kill himself. Parritt complies, and Larry becomes the only truly disillusioned person in the saloon, actively yearning for death. This sequence might well have represented O'Neill's own feelings during the year of Jimmy's suicide; he felt as if he actually told Jimmy to do it and then he looked forward to death and punishment.\n\nThe plot of the play is dually faceted, concerning both a man who kills his wife and a son who betrays his mother. Although there surely were many factors leading to such a plot construction, both of the facets interconnect with a basic issue often involved in a preoccupation with infidelity: hostility to a wife derived from hostility to a mother.\n\nHickey's feelings toward his wife are highly ambivalent. He convinces himself that he killed her out of love and his desire for her to have peace. Actually, he feels overwhelmingly guilty because she had been quite maternal to him and constantly forgave him for his transgressions. Finally, he reveals his real hostility to her and is taken away to be punished. Not ending at that point, the play continues to a dramatic climax that reveals the young Parritt's own hostility to his mother and ultimate self-punishment. The sequence and structure of the events surely suggest that hostility to one's mother is the greater sin. At the very least, the idea that hostility to a wife and a mother are related is unmistakably represented in the play.\n\nI believe that O'Neill's preoccupation with commiting infidelity, including its overtones of hostility to women, was related to his own conscious and unconscious hostility to his mother. That his famously drug-addicted mother was in some way on his mind is suggested by the constant use throughout the play of the denizens of the saloons' pipe dreams—a term that retains the overtones of its derivation from opium smoking. In one place in the manuscript, O’Neill actually wrote the words dope dreams—very likely an overt mistake that he immediately deleted. His choice of the themes of alcoholism and the saloon habitues' intractable addiction to drink were determined to some degree by thoughts and feelings about his own mother’s addiction. The writing of this play was not simply a nostalgic return to the past by a recovered alcoholic, as some critics have alleged, but was more a matter of unearthing and working out troubling feelings about his mother.\n\nUp to this point, I have focused on the emotional context from which the play arose. Although this serves to emphasize the importance of emotional conflict in determining the content of a work of art, the particular conflicts are not themselves creative. Paying careful attention to the way these conflicts relate to the ideas achieved, however, clarifies the unique thought processes involved in creation.\n\nO'Neill developed the key idea for the play by means of the creative janusian process, or actively conceiving two or more opposites or antitheses simultaneously, a conception leading to the construction of new identities—a key creative factor in literature and all the arts. His germinating notion regarding Jimmy Bythe's infidelity consisted of simultaneously opposite or antithetical ideas. In the \"Tomorrow\" story, his first written formulation, he had depicted Jimmy as committing suicide because of remorse over his wife's infidelity.\n\nClearly, as far as he knew and understood at that time, Jimmy Bythe did not want his wife to be unfaithful. But in the writing of The Iceman Cometh several years later, O'Neill was preoccupied with an opposite feeling—a desire or wish for infidelity. I believe therefore that the sequence of events was the following: Intensely concerned with Jimmy’s suicide over a period of many years, O'Neill eventually concluded that Jimmy actually had both wanted and not wanted his wife to be unfaithful to him. This happened either prior to or during the actual playwriting process. Fueled by his own conflict about infidelity, O'Neill consciously formulated the simultaneously opposite and antithetical feelings."
