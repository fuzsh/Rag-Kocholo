Eugene O'Neill was a pioneering American dramatist in the early 20th century who helped establish American drama as a serious art form. He brought psychological depth and candor to his plays that examined human relationships and the American experience. His works such as Long Day's Journey into Night and The Iceman Cometh explored themes of alcoholism, disappointment, and alienation and probed the American Dream and modern relationships. O'Neill drew from European modernists like Ibsen and Strindberg as well as movements like psychoanalysis to create dramas that were considered the finest examples of American theater in the 1920s-1930s and established him as a representative of the modernist movement in American drama.",
