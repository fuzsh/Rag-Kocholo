        "text": "A laid-back Irish pub and restaurant in Jamaica Plain has very quietly shut down.\n\nAccording to a tweet from @john_godfrey, Eugene O'Neill's in the Forest Hills section of JP is no longer in business, with a sign out front showing that the space is now for lease. A Twitter reply from @02130News confirms its closure, saying that a person at Napper Tandy's in Roslindale (which is under the same ownership) mentioned that the dining and drinking spot has been closed since Saturday.\n\nEugene O'Neill's first opened its doors in September of 2012, moving into the space where Griffin's Cafe had once been. In addition to its connection with Napper Tandy's in Roslindale, it was also affiliated with other Napper Tandy's pubs in Norwood, Millis, and Walpole.\n\nThe address for this now-closed pub in Jamaica Plain was: Eugene O'Neill's, 3700 Washington Street, Jamaica Plain, MA, 02130. The website for the Napper Tandy's pubs can be found at http://nappertandyspubs.com/"
