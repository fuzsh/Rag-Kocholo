CONCLUSIONS 358 Indications for Further Research BIBLIOGRAPHY 375 iii CHAPTER I INTRODUCTION Statement of the Problem From the reading of Eugene O'Neill's plays and the O'Neill criticism, the strong impression emerged that the role of the father is much more important than has been generally recognized. Upon careful analysis of each play the father seems to emerge as a compelling character, as a unique influence on ether characters, and as one of the important forces that shape the course of the play itself. O'Neill dramatizes his personal relationships. In his plays, the family, especially the father, when combined with other forces, often drives the protagonist to revolt, or to perform some self-destructive act. The only relief from the pressures portrayed seems to be found in dreams or in death. In many of O'Neill's plays, the major influence, more often than not, is the father of the central character. Many of the better critics have praised the strength 1 2 with which the father characters are drawn. In some plays the structure of the play itself is criticized because there is an overbalance of interest in the father character rather than in the central character.^ O'Neill portrays much an­ tagonism and conflict between the father and his children. Emerging more and more as the canon progresses, we discover that aggressive and rebellious impulses against the father seem often alternated with submissive and affirmative im­ pulses toward the father, closely paralleling O'Neill's relationship with his own father. O'Neill seems to have a personal desire to work out his feelings of hostility and to understand his need to escape from the dominating influence, from the awe and the overwhelming admiration for his father, 2 James O'Neill. The portrayal of his own experiences in play after play seems to illustrate a personal striving to 1-See William Jennings Adams, \"The Dramatic Structure of the Plays of Eugene O'Neill\" (unpublished Ph.D. disserta­ tion, Stanford University, 1956), hereinafter cited as Adams, \"Dramatic Structure,\" and James F.

V (July, 1957), 436. understand, to admire, and to reconcile his conflicting feelings toward his own father. An important aspect of some of O'Neill's protago­ nists is their feeling of inadequacy in facing the demands of fatherhood. O'Neill's personal relationships to his own children were ineffective. He suffered a sense of failure and guilt. This portrait of fathers unable to meet the demands of fatherhood appears again and again in the O'Neill canon. There is in the plays a comparison contrasting the demands of the father upon the hero with the demands of fatherhood upon him. There are several reasons, therefore, for selecting the fathers for study. The father represents a repeating and vivid character in the O'Neill canon. Most of his major plays contain a vivid portrayal of father characters. In the second place, there are many similarities amongst the father characters. Fathers have many similar personal characteristics, attitudes, and relationships with their children. It appears, therefore, that O'Neill is able to imagine the father characterization more vividly than many other types of characterization. It also appears that the father is a fundamental part of O'Neill's dramaturgy. In dealing with family relationships, the father is the most influential family member. Repeatedly, then, the way a father and his children interact is portrayed, and the effects of a father upon son or daughter is often an examination of the many ways a father restricts and prevents the fulfillment of his chil­ dren . ^ We discover, therefore, that the fathers in the various plays have similar functions. O'Neill seems to use the father to assist the plotting of his plays. The father has a very definite relationship to the themes. Often the father helps provide the forward movement. It seems that much of the conflict and its further motivating force is provided by the father. The father is often overbearing, or demanding, or manipulative. He is frequently an obstacle to the love fulfillment of the protagonist. He often threatens to deny the aspirations of the protagonist. Despite all this, he seems sincere and well-meaning and follows the dic­ tates of his very nature. The father, therefore, often seems to be the major obstacle in the path of the protago­ nist. The hero, in seeking to find some way to fulfill him­ self and find life-fulfilling forces, is in some way 3Sophus Keith Winther, \"O'Neill's Tragic Themes,\" The Arizona Quarterly. XII, No. 4 (Winter, 1957), 296. 5 4 blocked, inhibited, or put on a wrong track by the father. In addition, we find that the very nature of the protagonist seems to be shaped by the father. He inherits many of his father's characteristics and is deeply influ­ enced psychologically by him. The hero also learns from his father and assimilates the attitudes and personal problems he exemplifies.^ The father seems to be portrayed as a source of bio­ logical continuity. The father-son, birth-death, growth- decay cycle pivots around the father. Life continues and is portrayed as continuing in many plays, in which fathers pass on to their sons, who pass on to their grandchildren, both the attitudes and attributes that shape their existence. ^Thomas P. McDonnell, \"O'Neill's Drama of the Psyche,\" Catholic World. CXCVII (May, 1963), 120-125. 5Sophus Keith Winther, Eugene O'Neill: A Critical Study (New York: Random House, 1934), p. 159. Hereinafter cited as Winther, Euaene O'Neill. Professor Winther poses the question: How much free will does an O'Neill hero have? The father as a determinant of the hero follows this thesis. \"O'Neill's strength as a dramatist is emphasized by his de­ terministic philosophy. It makes his tragedies logically sound and emotionally convincing.\" Richard Dana Skinner opposes this view in Euaene O'Neill: A Poet's Quest (New York: Longmans, Green, 1935), p. 9. \"The poet of the in­ dividual soul, torn and warped, perhaps, by the surrounding mass currents, but still supremely the master of its indi­ vidual choice.\" Thus O'Neill portrays immortality as a biological conti- •4. 6 nuity. Again, as the O'Neill canon progresses, a change in the treatment of the father-child relationship seems to emerge. In most of the early family plays, the subject of the plays seems to be the impact of the father upon his children. In the mature plays, the subject of these plays is a search for self-fulfillment. But in these mature plays, the father, while not being the protagonist in most cases, is a major influence in the course of events. In all the final plays, O'Neill again takes as his subject the father-child relationship. Thus we find O'Neill examining the effects of the father on a protagonist who suffers and 7 ages under the shadow of his parent. The quality of characterization progresses through the O'Neill canon, and the father image seems to become more clear. There appears to be a changing attitude toward the father. A progressive examination of the plays reveals O'Neill developing more and more kindliness and sympathy 6Bryllion Fagin, \"O'Neill Contemplates Immortality,\" The Open Court. XLV (April, 1931), 215. ^John Henry Raleigh, in 0'Neill, ed. by John Gassner (Englewood Cliffs, N. J.: Prentice-Hall, 1964), p. 20. toward the father characters. From this progression, much of O'Neill's personal experience, his attitudes toward life, and his skill in dramaturgy can also be learned, particu­ larly in the father characters. The problem, therefore, became one of abstracting from the O'Neill canon, material about the fathers, then noting what happens and assessing its significance as the canon progresses, then finally comparing these materials with what is known about Eugene and James personally. Limitations of the Study The first limitation is to select plays that have actual father characters. Most of O'Neill's characters make references to their fathers. This is different, however, from the concrete exemplification of the father himself. Although there are many similarities to father characters in the references to fathers, the references are far more gen­ eral and lack specific quality. For this reason, therefore, it was felt that to study the role of actual father charac­ ters would be far more rewarding than to study the refer­ ences to fathers who never appear onstage. This, therefore, is a study of the role of the fathers represented in Eugene O'Neill's plays. It does not concern plays in which fathers are referred to but do not actually appear. Omitted are most of the one-act plays (except Abortion, Warnings, and The Rope), The Emperor Jones. The Hairy Ape. The Fountain, Welded. All God's Chillun Got Wings. Days without End, and The Iceman Cometh. The second important limitation is to exempt char­ acters that may bear a similarity to James O'Neill but have no role as a father in the play. To assume other characters were suggested by O'Neill's own father has indeed been done by the O'Neill critics. That James O'Neill was the model for Jim Harris, the Negro hero of All God's Chillun Got 0 Wings has been assumed by the Gelbs. The Gelbs also point out that Ponce de Leon in The Fountain and Marco Polo in Marco Millions both have many resemblances to James 9 O'Neill. However, neither Jim Harris, Ponce de Leon, nor Marco Polo has any role as a father, and it seems much safer to deal with characters that are used by O'Neill to exem­ plify the father instead of looking for resemblances to O'Neill's own father. A third limitation then suggests itself, but this limitation is a natural one in the examination of the ®Arthur and Barbara Gelb, 0'Neill (New York: Harper and Brothers, 1962), p. 534. ^Ibid.. p. 528. father's role. The size of the role is limited by the part that the father and fatherhood take in each play. The smaller the role the more limited the information about the father. With these limitations stated, then, \"a father\" is defined as the male character that has a parental relation­ ship to another character in the play. The term \"The Fa­ ther\" is the male parent of the protagonist. The term \"Fatherhood\" refers to the relationship of a male parent to his children who are the grandchildren of \"The Father.\" Other distinctions must be made. Different kinds of fathers are portrayed. The term \"paternal father\" refers to a bio­ logical male parent who procreates offspring. The term \"parental father\" designates a male parent who, lacking actual paternity, nevertheless maintains a parental rela­ tionship to another character. The term \"substitute father\" designates a male character who has neither paternity nor parental status, but who nevertheless may take the place, if only briefly, of a male parent. The plays examined were divided into five periods. The first period includes O'Neill's apprentice plays: Abor­ tion , Warnings. Servitude, Rope. Where the Cross Is Made and Gold. The second period includes the early plays Beyond the 10 Horizon. The Straw. Anna Christie. Diff'rent, and The First Man. The third period includes the middle plays: Desire under the Elms. Marco Millions. The Great God Brown, and Lazarus Laughed. The fourth period includes the later plays: Strange Interlude. Dynamo, and Mourning Becomes Electra. The last period includes the final plays: Ah. Wilderness 1. A Touch of the Poet. Long Day's Journey into Night, and A Moon for the Misbegotten. Method of Analysis Because so many of Eugene O'Neill's plays have simi­ larities to his own autobiography or are admitted by O'Neill to be autobiographical, fathers seem to have many character­ istics of O'Neill's father, James, as well as of O'Neill's own fatherhood. Chapter II of the study summarizes the pertinent characteristics of James O'Neill and Eugene O'Neill as fathers. When similarities to these character­ istics appear in the plays, they are referred to in the footnotes. The rest of the study is an analysis of the role of the father in each of the plays, taken in the chronological sequence listed above.In analyzing the role of the ^Several different chronological sequences of the father, the characterization is examined as it emerges in the action of the play. As each situation involving the father is presented by O'Neill, its cause and its effect are considered. As a result, essential motivations and atti­ tudes emerge and are more clearly defined. Following this analysis, the father's real function in the dramatic struc­ ture is considered. How he assists in exposition, in set­ ting up the essential action, in providing essential com­ plications, as a source of conflict, in heightening emo­ tional values, in setting the course of the action, and as a force in the resolution— all become a part of the analysis necessary in meeting the principal objective of this study. plays are available in the literature.

However, Gold is out of sequence because it was conceived at the time of Where the Cross Is Made, and in style, form, and treatment properly belongs among the apprentice plays. CHAPTER II SIGNIFICANT CHARACTER INFLUENCES IN THE LIVES OF JAMES AND EUGENE O'NEILL James O'Neill was born October 14, 1846, in Kil­ kenny, Ireland, the fourth of six children.^- His parents were \"potato famine\" Irish farmers who emigrated to Buffalo when he was ten, but almost immediately his father left the family and returned to Ireland, where he died. James had to go to work. At twelve, his family moved to Cincinnati, and his two elder brothers abandoned James, who helped support 2 the rest of the family. For two years he worked at his trade in a machine shop, then in his brother-in-law's clothing store in Norfolk, Virginia, during the Civil War. ^Ada Patterson, \"James O'Neill, the Actor and the Man,\" Theatre. VIII(April, 1908), 101. Hereinafter cited as Patterson, \"James O'Neill.\" 2Gelb, O'Neill, p. 20. 12 13 At age nineteen he returned to Cincinnati and worked as a 3 file-cutter. James began his acting career by accident. His first role, when he was twenty-two years old, was somewhat of a lark. He was recruited as a \"super\" in The Colleen Bawn in Cincinnati, October 17, 1867. He was quickly pro­ moted to \"walking gentleman,\" then to \"juvenile lead,\" and he started an acting career that took in several regional 4 stock companies. In these old stock companies, however, he had the advantage of acting with such stars as Edwin Forrest, Joseph Jefferson, and Charlotte Cushman. In four short years he moved to the leading regional stock company, McVickars of 5 Chicago. James was very successful m Chicago. Both audi­ ences and critics were flattering. Often doing a new play a week, he added experience with Edwin Booth, Dion Boucicault, 6 Adelaide Neilson, and Tommaso Salvini. Edwin Booth praised 3Ibid.. p. 22. 4James O'Neill, \"Personal Reminiscences,\" Theatre.

James thoroughly enjoyed the adventure of touring in California: What true Bohemians we were. And what flashes of wit used to illume the Arion Symposium when all the bright fellows gathered together to discuss kindred topics. . . . Ah, these were the halcyon days, and as for the nights they have no parallel now, for Bohemianism is a thing of the past.^ Part of his reputation was due to the fact that James was an unusually handsome man. Compact and trim, he had a well-balanced, graceful physique. Only of medium height— five feet eight inches— he nevertheless had strong facial features, classically chiseled and with a finely modeled nose. His dark eyes are described as \"the sunshine of Italy.\" He looked at the world candidly, yet his eyes ^MS in the W. C. Cawley Collection, New York Public Library. ®C. M.

His hair was black and curled over his high forehead. With an open sunny disposition, his voice had \"the glitter of moon­ light.\" He dressed in dapper, fashionable attire. Many a 10 Chicago lass was taken with this romantic leading man. James seemed to be an extrovert, displaying many pleasant personal qualities. He had a vivid personal mag­ netism. He was always lively and pleasant, and extremely sociable.^ Many who knew James commented on his use of wit and humor. He enjoyed joking with others and he never 12 took himself too seriously. James enjoyed being amused. He was sometimes a practical joker and was a personal clown 13 who often performed for the amusement of others. James now felt that he had succeeded in the most important provincial theatres of Chicago and San Francisco, •^°MSS in W. C. Cawley Collection.

On the strength of a secure job with the leading New York stock company, on January 16, 1876, James married Ellen (\"Ella\") 15 Quinlan. But now James struggled with disappointment after disappointment as he tried to forward himself in his profession. The New York reviews were not good. On October 3, 1876, he was criticized as being \"altogether too robust\" 16 in The Two Orphans. In Miss Mu1ton he was \"more aston­ ished at his presence on the stage than au fait of the pro- 17 ceedings he was supposed to be engaged in.\" In The Dani- cheffs. the reviewer thought James gave \"a hard and arti- 18 ficial portrayal.\" By September James was no longer in the New York company.

As a young man, James was \"no St. Anthony.\" Before his marriage he had had a discreet liaison with Nettie Walsh in Chicago. To James sex was a private, personal matter and his affair had been secretive. He also had a double stand­ ard about sex. There were two kinds of girls— some \"nice girls,\" and then the other kind. Once married, James— evi­ dently faithful as a husband— was probably morally severe 20 and prudish. However, his experiences led him to regard \"impure\" girls as sexually designing. For James, sex was entrapment. Ella had other problems with James. A social drinker who believed that he should hold his liquor well, he enjoyed a sociable glass after his performances. He drank discreetly, however, and was always careful not to appear drunk. In his home, liquor was always available because it was a hospitality, a means of social recreation, James O'Neill,\" New York Times. October 29, 1877, p. 2:4. ^^Weissman, \"Autobiographical Dramas,\" p. 458. 18 21 and such hospitality was a business asset. From all reports, James had a deep love for his wife Ella. Yet his married life was difficult. First, Ella had to face the scandal of a paternity suit against her new husband the first year of her marriage. Further, it seemed clear that Ella had a hard time adjusting to the loneliness of waiting for her husband after his performances night after night. Touring was even lonelier, and Ella was quite dependent on James. Yet James seemed to depend on Ella's being with him. But dependent as they were, they were de- 22 voted to each other. No longer employed in New York, James was forced to tour to Chicago and San Francisco. Somehow, Ella began to be addicted to drugs, probably associated with an inability to adjust to traveling and to raising children. It is al­ most certain that James did not understand what was happen­ ing. When he discovered the truth, he could do little about it. Both he and Ella tried to hide Ella’s addiction, and it was a well-kept secret, but it grew progressively worse over Jim Shay, bartender of the Thames Club in New London, quoted in Gelb, 0'Neill, p. 96. ^Agries Boulton, Part of a Long Story (New York: Doubleday, 1958), p. 233. Hereinafter cited as Boulton, Long Story. 19 a fifteen-year period until it became a critical problem 23 around 1912. Ella was hospitalized several times, but each time she came home she quickly returned to narcotics. Despite his difficulties, emotionally James liked to maintain a positive and enthusiastic outlook. He liked to display a gallant optimism. He \"kept smiling\" despite ad- 24 versity. Yet James was emotionally volatile. Ordinarily cheerful and tolerant, with provocation his temper would flare. Things had a way of piling up, and he could be irri­ table. At other times he was deeply discouraged, and when 25 depressed he was hopelessly miserable. James's own account of the next two years are con­ fusing, but he probably played Led Astray and A Celebrated 26 Case in California. The following years were rigorous ones. He touched New York twice. He played in tours of about four new plays a year, developing a reputation as a ^3Ibid.. p. 185. ^Eugene O'Neill in Alexander, Tempering, p. 110.

In 1883, Fechter, who had been fighting a drinking problem, came to the end of his career and was un­ able to open in Monte Cristo. James stepped into the role 27 with only three rehearsals. \"Mr. O'Neill failed to make 28 an impression of strength,\" commented the New York Times. Yet the play prospered, and James O'Neill found an oppor­ tunity to purchase the rights and settled down to make money. James O'Neill was determined to be strong and self- sufficient. He was a man who had great drive and energy, who fought poverty and personal handicaps and given the 29 advice to \"work, work. WORKi\" he took the advice as dogma. He was determined never to quit. He was highly perfeetion- istic. A competitive man, he tried hard not to be outdone professionally and moved to the top of his profession, breaking out of the confinements of economic necessity. In 30 emergencies assumed leadership and \"took charge.\" ^Patterson, \"James O'Neill,\" p. ix. 28\"Monte Cristo,\" New York Times. February 13, 1883, p. 5:2. John McLandburg, ca. 187 3, quoted in Alexander, Tempering, p. 38. 30Ibid.. p. 35. 21 A stubbornly independent man, he could disregard advice if he thought it was wrong and made it a fetish never to be dominated by others. Indeed, the work he did required great stamina and resilience. Touring was extremely rigorous and 31 James was able to follow a grinding schedule. Jamie was born in 1878 and was five years old when his father opened in Monte Cristo. He and his mother had toured most of the time. Even after the New York run of Monte Cristo Jamie continued to tour with his father. After two years O'Neill added a Hamlet to the run of Monte 32 Cristo. He found that repertory was good business. Monte Cristo brought him audiences and insured the income and the run could be extended in each city with other perform- 33 ances. James instinctively loved and enjoyed small chil­ dren. Yet the children were forgotten when James threw all of his energies into the theatre, and he left to concentrate on his work. Thus Jamie's early childhood alternated fun with periods of absence, and at age nine Jamie was sent to 31Gelb, O'Neill, p. 39. 32players Collection, New York Public Library. 33piaybills in the James O'Neill scrapbook, Beinecke Library, Yale University. 22 boarding school, where he stayed until he was seventeen years old. James and Jamie had much in common, and when they were together, during Jamie's boyhood, their relation­ ship was comradely.\"*4 James continued to add plays to the Monte Cristo tours, hopeful that he could find another play to establish his reputation in New York. Yet the plays he placed into the repertory were financially \"popular\" plays like The Dead Heart. The Envoy. The New South. When Eugene was born, James continued to add plays to his repertory and by 1893, when Eugene was five, James had a repertoire of The Three Musketeers. Virainius. Julius Caesar. Fontanelle, and of 35 course Monte Cristo. In contrast to his father, Eugene was born into an affluent family. He had a nurse and played with expensive toys. He had the best clothes and went to the finest pri­ vate schools. James took care of his sons in material 30 things, wanting to supply his children with the luxuries that he as a child could never afford. He became an over- 34Alexander, Tempering, p. 80. 33Playbills in James O'Neill scrapbook, Beinecke Library, Yale University. 36Gelb, O'Neill, p. 62. 23 protective father and prolonged the dependency of both his . 37 boys. James struggled to understand his son Eugene, who was always strange and had difficulty relating to his fa­ ther. As was necessary because James had to travel, Eugene was sent away to school, and Eugene, feeling rejected and punished, did not always do well. James tried to assist Eugene with his schooling difficulties but was constantly • 4-- 1 3 8 critical. James had a unique verbal facility. His stories were elaborately embellished and his speech was decorated 39 with \"elocutionary flutings.\" In contrast to his father's gift for \"blarney,\" Eugene, generally inarticulate, found conversation difficult, was by habit terse and laconic, and people felt he had more to communicate than he spoke. His communication often had personal private meanings and his speech contained many silences. He seemed to edit his 40 thoughts before he spoke. Eugene was overwhelmed by his ■^Weissman, \"Autobiographical Dramas,\" p. 458. 38Alexander, TemperingT p. 172. 38Irvin S.

Where James was facile and quick to express himself, Eugene could only withdraw. Nor could James understand his son in this regard. While James preferred to express his feelings and preferred social con­ tacts, Eugene's enigmatic silence, constant reading, or just plain dreaming could not be understood by his father. James's reaction was to criticize him for \"loafing\" and for 41 his posture and his diction. Jamie too was becoming difficult. He had learned to drink and after an episode involving a prostitute, he was expelled from college in his senior year despite high 42 marks. His hostility grew. He began acting and at first he was promising. But he felt pressured and demanded upon by his father. A less successful rival to his father, he soon quit trying. He then started drinking excessively, and showed his hostility toward his father, pushing James to the 43 limit. James was deeply hurt. All of his values were violated by Jamie. Yet he continued to provide for him financially, despite alternating scolding with hostile ^Alexander, Tempering, p. 73. 42Gelb, O'Neill, p. 71. 43Ibid.. p. 101. 25 silence, being furious with him or avoiding him. Only after James died did Jamie shape up and face his responsibili- 44 ties. Finally James tried to profit from another vehicle besides Monte Cristo. which after fifteen years was still his mainstay. With over twenty new plays in his repertoire, the only one he had confidence enough in to open in New York was the relatively safe Three Musketeers in 1899. But he must have been very nervous. The reviewers found him \"husky of voice, mature of person, imperfect in his delivery of text, uncertain of his 'business' and by no means repre- 45 sented an ideal of the Chevalier and lover.\" James was now a mature man of fifty-five. Despite his well-carried shoulders and erect military posture which gave him a younger appearance, he seemed stocky, had an un­ usually large chest, and was physically robust. An athlete, he relished stage sword-play. His face took on a florid, puffy-cheeked appearance. His deep-set dark eyes were youthful, bright and pleasant seeming. His classic nose still made a good profile. Although his lips were thinner, “ ^Alexander, Tempering, p. 288. 45\"Another D'Artagnan and More Vociferous Muske­ teers,\" New York Times. March 14, 1899, p. 7:1. 26 he still retained his illuminating smile and flashing teeth. James's hair grew thin on the top and was iron grey. His 46 hairline receded markedly. His voice remained \"the finest speaking voice on the American stage.\" It was deep-toned, 47 rich, but still had a distinct flavor of Irish brogue. Despite touring, James tried to establish a home in New London. He wished to avoid being \"provincial\" and did his best to suppress his Irish brogue. With fame and for­ tune he tried to become an American gentleman and strove hard for social acceptance in the community of New London. Yet he was proud of his Irish heritage. He always loved the companionship of all manner of Irish friends, and he main­ tained the Irish clannishness, the Irish hatred of the Eng- 48 lish, and its American counterpart the high-class Yank. He was popular in New London. A candid, simple man, gracious and unassuming, he was universally admired for his modesty; cordiality was one of his trademarks, and he was as cordial to the humble as he was to the great. Unawed by wealth, position, or fame, he was amused at the pretenses of ^Patterson, \"James O'Neill,\" p. 104. 4 7Boulton, Long Story, p. 18. 4^Patterson, \"James O'Neill,\" p. 104. 27 others. James combined serene, kindly humility with dignity 49 and authority. His house was constantly full of visitors and his many friends regarded him as \"hospitality personi­ fied.\" He was a charming host and belonged to a large num­ ber of clubs. \"He drew celebrities about him as moths to a flame.\"^ James held education in high esteem. He himself had little formal education, although his older sister provided him with a tutor, and he was a great reader with an exten­ sive knowledge of dramatic and romantic literature. James tried to get the best possible education for his boys, send- 51 ing them to the best private schools. It was Eugene's early schooling that caused his first break with his father. His early schools were very strict in the Roman Catholic training, but Eugene began to dislike the religious demands made upon him by the Catholic Mount St. Vincent. Associating these demands with his 49eilly Crane, quoted in Alexander, Tempering, p. 45. 5°George C. Tyler, \"Recalling the New York Stage,\" New York Dailv News.

On the other hand, James was simple in his devotion to Catholic precepts. He stubbornly maintained his faith despite not always being able to attend Mass regularly. Catholicism had a strong emotional hold on James, and he would have liked to have been a priest. He enjoyed playing roles such as the 52 Christus in the Passion Play of Salmi Morse. Eugene was fifteen when he rebelled against the Catholic Church, re­ fusing to attend Mass despite James's attempt to use physi- 53 cal force to make him go. So James allowed Eugene to go to non-sectarian Betts Academy. Eugene lost respect for all institutionalized re­ ligion. He did not believe the fundamentalism and conserva­ tism of his father's Christianity. However, he was still religious. He wrote in 1931, \"I have studied the history and development of all religions with immense interest as being— for me at least— the most illuminating 'case his- 54 tories' of the inner life of man.\" He began to associate ^Charles Warren Stoddard, letter dated December 16, 1879, James O'Neill scrapbook, Beinecke Library, Yale Uni­ versity. 53Gelb, O'Neill, p. 73. ^Martha Carolyn Sparrow, \"Influences of Psychoana­ lytical Material in the Plays of Eugene O'Neill\" (unpub- 29 55 religion first with psychology, then with the family.

College was some­ what of a lark and Eugene indulged himself, drinking and playing pranks. One of them got him in trouble and he was dismissed.^7 Returning home in 1907, James found Eugene a job in a cheap jewelry mail-order house in which James had a finan­ cial interest. Two years later Gene was again in trouble. Eugene married Kathleen Jenkins, whom he had made pregnant. The pregnancy of Kathleen Jenkins had a distinct parallel with James's affair with Nettie Walsh.

However, Eugene did not agree with his father because he regarded Kathleen as a i i • • -I H 60 nice girl.\" For Eugene, sex was an ever-present concern. He strove for guiltless sexual fulfillment. As a young man, he experienced sex early when his older brother Jamie intro­ duced him to \"loose women.\" As a matter of fact, Eugene used sex as a form of rebellion against his father, 5®\"Actor James O'Neill Sued,\" New York Times.

Premarital sex was almost a matter of course. He had affairs with Louise Bryant, then with Agnes Boulton. But like his father, Eugene regarded girls either idealis­ tically as \"nice\" or as prostitutes.^^ Yet sex was guilt- creating for Eugene. He did not understand the sex drive within himself and even, at times, he admitted to his wife 63 Agnes, he was fearful of impotence. Eugene also was handsome. Taller than his father, he stood over six feet. As a young man, he was athletic and strong. Like his father, he had fine features, but Eugene's face was somewhat longer, and he also had a well-formed nose. Both James and Eugene had dark eyes. Every commen­ tator describing Eugene noted his eyes. They were large and dreamy, yet intelligent. They could be penetrating and held the attention of the viewer. At other times, they were 64 restless and failed to make personal contact. His mouth was glum, seldom smiling, cruel seeming. His hair was wavy ^Ed Keefe, in ibid.. p. 129. 62Ibid.. p. 204. 63Boulton, Long Story, p. 182. fr^Ibid.. pp. 17f 21, 36, 46, etc. Agnes Boulton describes his eyes repeatedly. 32 and black. Nervous and shy, with a habit of silence, O'Neill spoke in monosyllables which gave way to an occa­ sional cutting remark or an infuriated sense of humor. Yet 65 Eugene was attractive to the opposite sex. After Eugene went with his father's friend, Earl C. Stevens, to prospect for gold in Honduras, James made him stage manager for the road company of The White Sister. Eugene hated it and in rebellion he shipped out on a sailing vessel, jumped ship in Buenos Aires, lost a few jobs, shipped out again to Durban, South Africa, returned again to Argentina, and finally, returning to New York, consented to 66 give Kathleen Jenkins a divorce on grounds of adultery. Destitute, Eugene lived at Jimmy the Priest's (a rundown saloon and rooming house) and then shipped to Liver­ pool. Returning to New Orleans, he caught his father’s Monte Cristo tour and was given a bit part \"slaving\" in the company. Nor was James happy with Eugene's ability as an actor, so that summer in New London, James again got Eugene a job, this time as a reporter on the New London Telegraph. Eugene's tuberculosis became evident at this time and in ^^John v. A. Weaver, \"I Knew Him When,\" New York World. February 21, 1§26, p. 8 . 66Miller, Eugene O'Neill, p. 93. 67 December, 1912, he was hospitalized. James did not understand illness. He had always enjoyed good health. As a result he was suspicious of doc­ tors. The only serious illness he ever had was the one which led to his death in 1920. But in 1912, he also had to hospitalize his wife for her drug problem. Drug addiction was beyond his ken and tuberculosis in that age was a frightening fact. It was a leading cause of death and there had been no known cure. It can be said to James's credit that he never gave up with either of these problems. He sought desperately for proper care for both Eugene and Ella despite the expense. Eugene, however, felt that James held saving money and the health of his wife to be more important 68 than the recovery of his son Eugene. Despite James's attempt to be optimistic and to maintain a positive attitude, he actually had conflicting feelings. In the first place, he had a fatalistic, almost superstitious belief in chance. It was to chance that he attributed his success, and it was the \"curse\" of fate that 67Ibid.. p. 94. 88Croswell Bowen, The Curse of the Misbegotten: A Tale of the House of O'Neill (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1959), p. 53. Hereinafter cited as Bowen, Curse of the Misbegot­ ten . 34 69 prevented him from going on to more fulfilling success. Illness was a curse. In the meantime the earning capacity of Monte Cristo was dwindling. Although James had so far managed his acting career successfully, he was a bad investor. He was often taken advantage of. His business ventures before he started 70 acting had been failures. During the Gold Rush he in­ vested in gold and silver mining. He invested in oil ven­ tures, cattle ranches, and promising inventions (like the zipper) that did not work out. Feeling that New London would ultimately become another major seaport, he invested 71 in New London property. So, despite the fact that he earned over $7,000 a week in Monte Cristo. he never invested 72 the money productively. Ready cash was always scarce. He was always fearful of reverting to the poverty of his child­ hood. Even his theatre ventures aside from Monte Cristo Ibid.. pm 120.

He also tried motion pictures, but never obtained distribution.^ Actually James was faced with the divergence between his own high ideals and personal standards and the actual circumstances of his life. He felt he should be positive, that he should be artistic, that he should be a good father and husband, that he should be gentlemanly, that he should be a good Catholic. All of these ideals had to be compro­ mised in the face of actual difficulties. He was beset by doubts and insecurities. He was more a popular actor than an artist. His desire to be a good husband and father was offset by severe family problems. He was always conscious of his humble Irish origins. His religious standards and 74 ascetic ideals were often beyond his ability to achieve. James had a further quality as a result of his trusting, credulous, even gullible nature. He automatically liked everyone. He liked to be pleasant and helpful. As a 75 result, he was frequently taken advantage of. In ^Patterson, \"James O'Neill,\" p. ix. ^Gelb, Q 'Neill, p. 45. ^George c. Tyler, Theatre Collection, Lincoln Cen­ ter, New York City Public Library. 36 opposition to his credulity, at times James could be un­ reasonably suspicious. He distrusted authority, frequently feared betrayal, and when he felt his independence threat- 76 ened, he often became stubbornly distrustful. James felt a strong need to be thrifty. No doubt due to his early poverty, he was almost obsessed by finan­ cial insecurity, doing his own gardening and saving on 77 utilities. Yet James wished to appear generous. He al­ ways could be counted on to buy the drinks, donate to chari- 78 table causes, and was \"generous to a fault.\" Eugene reacted strongly to James's conflicting atti­ tudes. In some cases he was overly aware of the fagade that James maintained in order to mask his insecurities. He was extremely conscious of the social front that his father put on, and was acutely aware of the degree to which his father 79 failed to match his own standards. James was clearly caught between the ideal and the real and this dichotomy was 76Alexander, Tempering, pp. 44-45. 77Gelb, O'Neill, p. 177. 7®George C.

He made a fetish of bluntness, becoming almost misanthropic. His consciousness of the discrepancy between the ideal and 80 the real caused his ironic view of the world. Eugene had his peculiarities. It was difficult to separate the tendency to dramatize himself from the truth, and, as a result, many incidents of Eugene's life became more legend than fact. Also, he was very forgetful and absent-minded. Perhaps the one thing that could be said of 81 Eugene was that he was preoccupied. Eugene was a \"loner.\" He preferred being alone, yet was lonely, and he often dis- 82 appeared for long periods of time. Like his father, Eu­ gene had many insecurities. His family life never allowed him any confidence in himself. He was easily hurt and easily experienced a sense of rejection. The main feeling that some observers experienced with Eugene was that he had a childlike quality. In his own innocent and artless way he 80Ibid. ^Hamilton Basso, \"The Tragic Sense,\" The New York­ er. XXIV (March 13, 1948), 37, 44. 8^Edith Isaacs, \"Meet Eugene O'Neill,\" Theatre Arts.

Eugene's stay at Gaylord Farm (a tuberculosis sani­ tarium), however, was a critical turning point for him. It was during his illness that he decided to become a play­ wright. Cured of tuberculosis, Eugene spent a considerable length of time without any success. He was encouraged by Clayton Hamilton to attend George Pierce Baker's English 47, Dramatic Composition, at Harvard. James, feeling that Eu­ gene had not been a success at Princeton, only reluctantly was persuaded to send his son to Harvard. But he did en­ courage his son's writing, despite never understanding it. James suggested a \"practical\" writing career. Further, he tried to find a producer for Eugene's plays, speaking to George Tyler and Holbrook Blinn. He also sought advice from 84 writers like Irvin S. Cobb and Clayton Hamilton. Then 85 James financed the publication of Thirst. and he gave his ^George Jean Nathan, The Intimate Notebook of Georae Jean Nathan (New York: Knopf, 1932), p. 30.

Eugene's writing career, now begun seriously, lan­ guished for four years before he had any recognition. Still receiving $10.00 a week from his father, he lived in Green­ wich Village, then moved to Provincetown, where a rag-tag group of struggling artists began producing his one-act 86 plays, and Eugene's Bohemian exploits became legendary. However, James came to the production of Eugene's plays and was impressed. He even helped Eugene in the directing, giving his suggestions to the actors of Before Breakfast and 87 Fog. Finally the earning capacity of Monte Cristo had been exhausted. James sought parts in other plays and con­ tinued to act until he was past seventy in such vehicles as The White Sister. Joseph and His Brethren. The Wanderer, and The Melody of Youth. Not only James, but also others were 88 saddened that he had failed to fulfill his early promise. James was now playing older parts, Biblical patri­ archs, churchmen, and small character roles. He had been 88Miller, Eugene O'Neill, p. 95. ^Alexander, Tempering, p. 238. 88Players Collection of the New York Public Library, Lincoln Center, New York. 40 ageless in his appearance, but now suddenly he grew thin and old. Although he maintained his dignified manner, his ap­ pearance, no longer stocky and robust, made him seem little and shrunken. His face in old age grew thin, although his nose still made a good profile. His lips grew even thinner. James's eyes, still youthful and sparkling, now required the use of eyeglasses. His thinning hair was carefully combed 89 to conceal his baldness. In his old age, James began hav­ ing difficulty with his memory. Yet he retained the delib­ erate spryness on the stage that always characterized him, until he was injured in an automobile accident in 1920 which forced him to rely on a cane. This heightened the effect of 90 his being a little old man. When Eugene got married to Agnes Boulton, James made it possible for him to continue his writing career by con­ tinuing his allowance and providing a house at Peaked Hill Bars. He established good relations with Agnes. James was proud of all of Eugene's successes, and when he saw the 99The description of James in his old age is based on pictures in the Theatre Collection of the Lincoln Center branch of the New York Public Library which dramatically contrast the sudden aging of James in pictures dated 1889, 1917, and 1919. 90Gelb, O'Neill, p. 407. 41 Broadway production of Beyond the Horizon. James was deeply moved. Despite the lack of understanding for the mood and tone of the play, he felt its effect on the audience and was very pleased. Father and son had stimulating conversations 91 and James offered his professional advice to his son. Thus James established close relations with Eugene just before his death. Eugene was a hard worker also, but in a different way from his father. For him, hard work was an escape. He was faced with many painful feelings that he tried to avoid. He fought against his degrading dependence. He needed to leave home and seek his own way. In search of independence, he went through a Bohemian period, but remained financially unsuccessful. He acutely felt his own inadequacies as he continued to rely on paternal assistance. The continuing need caused him to become more and more resentful and rebel­ lious against his father's well-meaning advice and assist- 92 ance. This rebelliousness was not really against his father so much as against all the attitudes and social 91Boulton, Long Storv. p. 231. 92Gelb, O'Neill, p. 163. 42 standards that his father stood for. Eugene defied and attacked the conventional. He himself had little resistance to emotional shocks. Annoyances and frustrations caused him acute agony. He found that the world was a cause for in- 93 dignation. Eugene had feelings of rejection combined with the impulse to fight back. Feeling that his father paid great respect to those things that Eugene himself felt unimportant caused him to be easily annoyed by superficialities. Surfaces, veneers, and the like were \"banal\" and therefore contemptible. Eugene was intolerant of things he considered wrong, unimportant, or inconsequential. He wished strongly to push aside the 94 unessential and to find the significant. Eugene developed a harsh and punishing quality, not only toward superficialities, but also toward himself. Strongly idealistic, he was intolerant of his own weaknesses and was often self-destructive. Sometimes he was a strange mixture of understanding and cruelty. He could be self- 95 tortured. He could also be sadistic. ^Nathan, Intimate Notebook, p. 23. ^Harold Clurman, \"At Odds with Gentility,\" The Nation. CXCIV (April 7, 1962), 312. 95Granville Hicks, \"O'Neill,\" Saturday Review of 43 Basically, the attitudes that James adhered to, and that Eugene often rebelled against, were middle-class, nineteenth-century attitudes with an Irish flavor. In some ways, James was very conventional. He had a strong code of \"honor.\" Acting \"squarely and honorably\" was a personal 96 dogma for James. Eugene suddenly found himself outdoing his father in his father's own profession. He \"went in a new direction,\" and his father had difficulty understanding the new kind of 97 theater that Eugene was creating. Still James's death was a blow. Eugene suddenly became conscious of the loss of closeness and affection. He was hurt by watching his father suffer with cancer, and he became obsessed by the \"living 98 corpse\" image. Eugene's marriage to Agnes Boulton became increas­ ingly inadequate. He was obscure and difficult, and he felt that Agnes enjoyed the social contacts that Eugene's fame brought to them. Eugene did not share her sociability. Literature.

Eugene O'Neill also fought a severe drinking problem. He needed liquor as a \"prop to meet the situation.\" Drink began to frighten him and he finally decided to be psychoanalyzed. After analysis he tried to stay \"on the wagon\" but had a few bad relapses. Eugene was proud at the birth of Shane. Yet in his early childhood Shane was a lonely boy. Resembling his father, he was a delicate, withdrawn child, good looking, thin, and shy. Eugene alternated closeness with periods of isolation. O'Neill played with Shane some, but his interest was short-lived. Eugene was usually preoccupied, and Shane 102 could never count on attention from his father. And yet he adored his father. When O'Neill was in New York for rehearsal, Shane missed him terribly. O'Neill demanded quiet while he worked, and Shane was not allowed to be \"ibid., p. 625. ■ L00Boulton, Long Story, pp. 158-159. ■^^^Kenneth Macgowan in Gelb, O'Neill, pp. 596 and 612.

To a boy, O'Neill could be frighteningly overwhelm­ ing . Unlike James, who refused to acknowledge his alleged son Alfred H. O'Neill, Eugene did establish relationships with his son Eugene Jr., who was very much like his father. Eugene Jr. was tall— six feet two inches— and thin. He had his father's long, handsome face and was intellectually brilliant, with a charming personality. Unheard of by O'Neill for ten years, his mother, Kathleen Jenkins, to her credit, brought Eugene Jr. up with good feelings toward his 103 father. Eugene, finding out about his son's intellectual promise, was persuaded to contribute to his education. When they first met they were both nervous. Although both were 104 inarticulate, they soon discovered a common interest. A good deal of Eugene's guilt and avoidance can be attributed to James's attitude. Only after his father's death did 105 Eugene feel free to acknowledge his son. Unlike James, Eugene never felt at home as a parent. He was uneasy and unable to relate with small children. •^•^Bowen, \"The Black Irishman,\" p. 75.

He considered children love rivals and feared they would deprive him of the love of his wife. Moreover, they distracted him from his work. With the addition of Barbara Burton, Agnes's daughter from a previous marriage, and with the birth of Oona, O'Neill sud­ denly had quite a large family. \"Children in squads, even when indubitably my own tend to 'get my goat,'\" he said, 106 although admitting they had their compensating moments. 107 Although at times paternal, he still remained aloof. He wanted to enjoy them and had love feelings for his children, but felt helpless to express them. Leaving his family in Bermuda, he went to New York for the rehearsals of Strange Interlude and never re- 108 turned. He then established a relationship with Carlotta Monterey. He appealed to her from a sense of need. For him Carlotta was an ideal who had played the symbol of feminine unapproachability in The Hairy Ape and was aristocratic, beautiful, and well organized. After he married Carlotta 106 Eugene O'Neill in a letter to Kenneth Macgowan, quoted in Gelb, 0'Neill, p. 612. •^•^^Hansford, \"O'Neill as the Stage Never Sees Him,\" p. 5. 108Miller, Eugene O'Neill, p. 100. 47 he wrote of her as \"mistress,\" \"wife,\" \"mother,\" \"daughter,\" and referred to his plays as \"our children.\" From this point on, the portrayal of fatherhood disappears from the 109 O'Neill canon. There is no doubt that Carlotta sought to protect O'Neill. She intercepted letters and phone calls that were apt to \"upset him.\" She disapproved of his friends. She interfered with contacts with his children. But his mother and father's divorce was shattering to Shane and the emotional letters his father wrote him seemed cruel. There is no doubt O'Neill felt guilty about his inability to fulfill himself in fatherhood. After the divorce he was almost pathologically afraid his children 110 would forget him. In comparison to his own father, O'Neill abandoned his children. James may have manipulated his children too much, but O’Neill gave them too little contact.

They were short, and some years there were no visits. When Shane grew older, he sought a guidance from 112 his father that he never received. To do Eugene justice, he had all he could do to cope with his own problems. A combination of factors was wearing him down. In 1927, just before his divorce, he underwent 113 psychoanalysis, but only briefly.

In 1951 he was hospitalized with hallu­ cinations, and there were conflicting diagnoses of mental 119 illness and chloral poisoning. His last illness in 1953 120 was bronchial pneumonia. Oona actually had only a slight relationship with her father. Before the divorce, she was a shy, pudgy three- year-old with enormous eyes. Oona has a happy memory of her 121 father on a trip to the zoo when she was three. But she did not see her father again until she was six, and only 122 four more times thereafter. O'Neill found Oona an at­ tractive teenager. She was charming and they enjoyed swim­ ming together. But Oona's relations with Carlotta were not 123 good.

But when Charlie Chaplin started coaching her in her acting, he found her \"charming.\" With both intelligence and understanding, Oona was a capable girl who knew herself well, who could see the other person's point of view, and who had a delightful sense of humor, keen wit and great poise. Although Chaplin was involved in a paternity suit, they decided to get married when Oona became eighteen 127 and no longer needed her parents' consent. When O'Neill learned of his daughter's marriage, he refused to speak of her and for the rest of his life he refused to talk when Oona was mentioned.

Eugene Jr. entered Yale and gained academic dis­ tinction, winning prizes and fellowships. Taking his Ph.D. from Yale and an assistant professorship, he became an au­ thority on Greek drama. There was great intellectual com­ panionship between Eugene Jr. and his father. Eugene Jr.1s visits were short and tactfully spaced. He knew when he was welcome with his father and when he was not. \"I am proud of him— \" Eugene O'Neill said, \"and I think he is proud of me— and our relationship is naturally brotherish with none of 130 the forced 1pal-father-son1 bunk in it.\" However, in 1946 Eugene Jr. \"changed suddenly,\" Carlotta said. \"He grew a beard, got a fat belly from drinking, and became a commu­ nist.\" No longer welcome in the O'Neill home, he had to 131 meet his father elsewhere. •^^Chaplin, My Autobiography, p. 49. 130Gelb, O'Neill, p. 706. 131Ibid.. p. 867. 52 Eugene Jr. began to find his difficulties piling up on him. Twice divorced, \"he had eighteen girls during that 132 period. He also started drinking heavily.\" Finally, realizing that his own instability was destroying his ca­ reer, he felt powerless. On September 25, 1950, Eugene Jr. cut his wrists and ankles and bled to death. Carlotta tried to hide the news, but O'Neill knew instinctively. \"When did he die?\" he asked her. After that he never mentioned his 133 son Eugene again. Out of school, Shane had an erratic job history. Shortly after Shane's marriage, their child Eugene III died through accidental neglect. O'Neill was \"appalled.\" And 134 Shane never saw his father again. In 1948 Shane was ad­ mitted to the Federal Hospital at Lexington, Kentucky for drug addiction. In 1951 he was committed to Ancora State Hospital for the mentally ill \"because of long indiscrimi­ nate use of drugs,\" after being found wandering on the high- 135 way.

O'Neill seemed to grow taller as he aged prematurely and became more bone than flesh. He was painfully thin and shrunken, spare, rangy, and brittle seeming. Although 137 slightly stooped, he had a flexible erectness. His arms appeared long and thin, while his hands were palsied. \"His paralysis aaitans involved his whole emaciated body in one 138 miserable stammer.\" O'Neill's face remained \"difficult 139 to put out of mind.\" It was white as a stick of chalk. He had a forceful jaw, and his thin face was shrunken tightly against his fine skull. O'Neill's finely-drawn features made his nose appear even more bulbous than it was. His mouth remained wry and sardonic, but he startled ob­ servers with his sudden smile. His dark, deep-set eyes were still dreamy, yet intense with a probing, sad, piercing 136\"piayWright's Son Jumps through Second Story Win­ dow,\" United Press International, December 13, 1966. 137Basso, \"The Tragic Sense,\" p. 37.

Eugene's neatly brushed hair became more and more a distinguished gray, while his wispy moustache became 141 nearly white. His low voice was often lacking m con­ trol. At times it could be scarcely heard. At other times 142 it was a deep booming bass. O'Neill retained his well- groomed, immaculate, expensive dress. He had an impeccable, 143 aloofly mannered gentlemanliness. As he matured he be- 144 came more calm and less rebellious. Yet even though he was at times more relaxed, calm, and genial, he was always unusually deliberate in his speech. His romantic somberness startled and held attention. His softer qualities were abrupt and unexpected. His sudden laughter was deep and 145 generous, and his smile was quick. ■^^Mary Welch, \"Softer Tones for Mr. O'Neill's Por­ trait,\" Theatre Arts.

CIII (January, 1922), 353. 145sean O'Casey, in O'Neill and His Plays, ed. by 55 Eugene O'Neill was an extremely complex man whom others found difficult to understand. He was very self­ concerned and self-observing. He seemed convinced of the priority of his personal awareness. As a result, to some he 146 seemed cocksure and vain. As a young man, O'Neill may have found the nine­ teenth-century code of honor to be a little old-fashioned. But as he aged, more and more commentators remarked about his gentlemanliness. As he grew older, he became more and more conservative and began to adhere to his father's atti­ tudes. Discounting his earlier rebelliousness, he based his \"modern mores\" on old virtues. Montiville Hansford, his neighbor in the Bermuda days, commented, \"He has an old- 147 fashioned attitude toward many things.\" Like his father, Eugene experienced poverty and an increasing burden of responsibility and of material needs. But his gradual success became increasingly important. As he became more and more successful, Eugene expected Oscar Cargill, N. Bryllion Fagin, and William J. Fisher (New York: New York University Press, 1961), p. 96. ^-^Norman Chiatin, \"O'Neill: The Power of Dar­ ing,\" Modern Drama.

Unlike his father, he carefully managed his 148 surplus capital. As a businessman, O'Neill maintained good professional relations. He kept on good terms with producing organizations, and the actors in the plays re- 149 ceived gentle help and warm appreciation. Becoming increasingly independent, Eugene wrote what he pleased with but little consideration of popular public taste. Gradually, however, he withdrew from his own pro­ duction, despite writing increasingly ambitious projects. His ultimate tragedy was spending the last ten years of his life unable to write, and therefore almost completely un­ productive. Nevertheless, fifteen years after his death, his plays continue to add to the New York theatre. ^®Basso, \"The Tragic Sense,\" p. 38. l^Agee, \"Ordeal of Eugene O'Neill,\" p. 75. CHAPTER III EUGENE O'NEILL'S APPRENTICE PLAYS Despite the crude, often melodramatic approach, O'Neill's early plays are interesting because they antici­ pate his later development. The family plays are few. Yet in the four plays that contain father characters, both the kind of father and the relationship of the father to the theme and structure of the play are often repeated in his later plays.^ Abortion Celebrating his college athletic victory with his family, Jack Townsend is accosted by Joe Murry, the brother of a girl Jack has made pregnant. Learning the girl has died, Jack commits suicide. The exposition of Abortion consists largely in es­ tablishing the character of the protagonist, young Jack •^Cf. Sparrow, \"Influences of Psychoanalytical Mate­ rial,\" p. 13. 57 58 Townsend, and in showing his relationship to his family, which is a pleasant one. Jack's father, John Sr., has 2 lingered to talk with one of the professors. Described on entering as \"kindly,\" Townsend is a man around sixty years old of tall stature. He is \"erect, well 3 preserved, energetic, dressed immaculately but soberly.\" He laughs and teases his son's fiancee, but arranges to be alone with his son. The action of the play actually begins with the confidential discussion that follows. Although Townsend is loquacious and sentimental and reminisces flu- 4 ently about his own college days, he is actually avoiding a discussion of \"such a deuced painful subject for both of 5 us\" that he hardly dares to speak of it. The painful sub­ ject is the abortion which young Jack has arranged— using money from Townsend— for a girl he has made pregnant. Sex is a subject that makes Townsend uncomfortable. Although he 2Eugene O'Neill, Ten \"Lost\" Plavs (New York: Random House, 1964), p. 146.

Yet, \"we've retained a large por­ tion of the original mud in our make-up.\" However, Townsend insists that Jack is as responsible \"for the Mr. Hyde . . . as for the Dr. Jekyll,\" and the answer for sexual urges is \"restraint. Townsend is a political conservative and somewhat of a snob. For him, \"radical arguments\" about social evils and moral laws are \"too deep,\" He will not even consider them. The girl his son got into trouble, a \"working girl, a ste­ nographer\" is \"hardly the class [his son has] been accus- 7 tomed to associate with.\" Townsend is sentimental about the conventional marriage, and believes his son will be a \"worthy husband.\" The religious references are conserva­ tive, with a Catholic flavor. He sincerely and humbly feels g God may grant happiness to his son. Townsend and his son seem to have a pleasant and successful relationship. Father and son enjoy each other's 6Ibid.. pp. 154-155.

He seeks his son's well-being, and actively does his best to assist young Jack. Proud of his son's accomplishments, he gains vicarious satisfaction from Jack's 9 athletic triumphs. Although Townsend serves a unique function in the plotting of this play, he actually takes no direct part in its action. Yet his position is a key one. It is Townsend who initiates the major action. The inciting incident is arranged by Townsend, and following that, Townsend most clearly defines the major conflict. However, in this play, Townsend is largely the confidant and accessory. He leaves before the crisis. The responsibility for the change of events is his son's. Jack got the girl into trouble and made all the arrangements for the abortion. His father merely supplied the necessary money. But he aids and abets his son, starting the chain of events in a certain direc­ tion. The decisions are clearly the wrong ones in view of their results. Yet Townsend's attitude is that the deci­ sions and method of solving the problem were both practical and correct. The practical approach, the conventional ap­ proach, and the advice the father gives the son are all 9Ibid.. p. 157. 61 portrayed as wrong. Where Jack errs is in adopting the viewpoint and attitudes espoused by his father. Thus O'Neill uses Townsend to portray conventional and practical 10 attitudes that are mistaken, wrong, and damaging. Warnings Warnings is one of the \"other\" plays in the rare volume (now a collector's item) THIRST and Other One Act Plays. the publication of which was financed by Eugene O'Neill's father.^ This apprentice work concerns a ship's wireless operator, James Knapp, who is the father of five children and is struggling to support himself and his family in a marginal job as wireless operator. He is losing his hearing and feels unable to continue his job. Nevertheless, Knapp ships out again and, unable to hear the warnings on the wireless, permits the ship to hit a derelict and sink. When the ship's doom is certain, Knapp commits suicide. The play opens with the children quarreling and Mrs. Knapp angrily scolding them, hardly able to cope with their ■^Cf. Chester Clayton Long, \"A Study of the Role of Nemesis in the Structure of the Plays of Eugene O'Neill\" (unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, Northwestern University, 1962), p. 98.

She threatens the children by saying \"'I'll tell 12 your father,'\" and \"'your father will whip you good.'\" The exposition reveals that the father, James, despite fi­ nancial difficulties, is impusively generous with money to his children, and has become increasingly irritable because of difficulty with his hearing. When Knapp arrives, we see a slight stoop-shouldered man of about fifty. He has a thin face; a stubby, shapeless nose; small, close-set, dark eyes; a large, weak mouth; and a thin line of gray hair extending over his large ears and 13 around the back of his almost completely bald head. He is in a state of depression and, despite the efforts of his oldest son to cheer him up, he remains listless, feeling trapped, inadequate for a job he dislikes. When his son asks for money and his wife nags him about her insecurities, 14 Knapp replies, \"'I'm trying to do the best I know how.'\" His wife reminds him that his prospects of getting another job are very slim. He therefore agrees to take one final trip, despite revealing that his hearing has deteriorated to 120'Neill, THIRST and Other One Act Plavs. p. 63. • * - 3Ibid. . p. 6 6. 14Ibid.. p. 69. 63 the point where he feels unable to perform his duties as the ship's wireless operator. On board ship, straining to hear messages on the wireless, Knapp suddenly realizes that he is now completely deaf. The ship hits a derelict. Knapp becomes increasingly tense while trying to perform his job, then learns that he had failed to hear the radioed warning message and is there­ fore responsible for the accident. As all abandon ship, Knapp commits suicide. Knapp is the protagonist and the main action con­ sists in his inability to perform his duties in an emergency because of his deafness. Yet his fatherhood serves two im­ portant functions. First, it sets up the situation which reveals the nature of Knapp's problem. Much of the role of fatherhood is to provide the exposition and to initiate the major action. Further, because of his fatherhood, Knapp feels obliged to ship out in a job that he is incompetent to perform. Thus the responsibilities of fatherhood help ini­ tiate the course of action which leads to disaster. Knapp is trapped between his own physical inadequacies and the need to support his family as the father of his children. Servitude A second \"lost\" play, Servitude, concerns itself with a successful author, Roylston, and his relationship with his wife and \"another woman.\" Fatherhood is a minor and incidental part of this relationship. Roylston, at thirty-five years of age, is a slender, tall man with large handsome features and intelligent dark eyes. He has dark hair and a \"strong, ironical mouth half hidden by a black 15 moustache.\" He is a playwright and a novelist. Roylston's wife and children being away, his atten­ tion turns to the various \"ladies\" who seek his advice.^ Roylston is unconventional, a writer of books and plays de- 17 signed to disillusion the reader \"about Wall Street.\" He explains that for him the family relationship is \"purely secondary.\" His work comes first. \"‘As long as my home life gives free scope for my creative faculty I will demand noth- 18 ing further of it.'\" •^O'Neill, Ten \"Lost\" Plavs. p. 228. Written when O'Neill was twenty-six, his circumstances ten years later were almost exactly as described. See pp. 31-32 above. 16Ibid.. pp. 228, 231, 283. 17Ibid.. p. 238. 3 - 8Ibid. . p. 249. See also Eugene O'Neill, pp. 43- 44 above. 65 The only appearance of his children is a device to bring his wife home unexpectedly. The younger child, Ruth, has become ill and has cut short their trip to New York just when Roylston has allowed a designing \"other woman\" to spend the night. The children are not allowed to disturb their 19 father. In the confrontation between wife and \"other woman\" the theme of the play is explained. \"Love means 20 servitude ...\" and love is happiness. Despite that, Mrs. Roylston is insecure with the love of her husband be­ cause he was \"becoming indifferent\" to his wife and chil­ dren. Indeed, despite the fact that Roylston's daughter is ill enough to require a doctor, Roylston expresses not a ^ 4= 2 1 word of concern. Roylston is further characterized as \"Mr. Narcis- 22 sus,\" and \"an egotist.\" He confesses, \"'I have been too 23 busy to love anyone.1\" Yet, although his wife had been prepared to leave him early in their marriage, the birth of 24 the children prevented it. Now he is caught m a ^ 0 1 Neill, Ten \"Lost\" Plays, p. 259. 20Ibid., p. 270. 21Ibid.. pp. 274-275. 22Ibid., p. 281. 2^Ibid., p. 283. 24Ibid., p. 293. 66 compromising position, and is forced to examine himself. Roylston admits, \"'I do not even know my own children. . . . For all the loving interest I have taken in them they might 25 just as well be the gardener's . . Nevertheless, he is still \"'the sovereign individual. The Superman. The great lonely one . . . determined to be exceptional though 26 the heavens fall.'\" Mrs. Roylston is prepared to leave him so that he can have his love, his happiness, and his children. She feels she has no right to deprive him of the children. For Roylston's sake, \"'it was best for them to 27 stay.'\" Then, however, his wife learns that he had not even spent the night in the house with the \"other woman.\" Fatherhood is useful to the play for two reasons. First, it motivates the plotting. By providing the reason for the wife to be away, it allows for the success of the inciting incident of the \"other woman.\" It further provides the reason for his wife's unexpected return. Second, it becomes an issue in the crisis of the play. The fate of the children adds to the sentimental and emotional elements of ^5Ibid., p. 294. ^Ibid., p. 295. See also Eugene O'Neill, pp. 40-43 and 54-55 above. 21 O' Neill, Ten \"Lost\" Plays, p. 302. 67 the ending. Seemingly, the wrong decision about the chil­ dren is made. The wife is prepared to give up the children so that her husband can have their love and the happiness he is entitled to. Despite the fact that he is not suited to care for the children, keeping them will be best for him, to insure his happiness. Not regarded as people, the children are mere commodities to provide Roylston with love. For Roylston to receive love, he must be served because love 28 means servitude. The Rope In The Rope O'Neill introduces the prodigal son motif which he had seen used successfully in his father's 29 portrayal of Jesse in David Belasco's The Wanderer. Luke Bentley returns for his father's money. But his father has hidden the money, which the feeble-minded grandchild finds and throws into the sea. Abraham Bentley, at sixty-five, is a doddering wreck of a man. Lean, stoop-shouldered and tall, his legs are twisted with rheumatism, and his face is gaunt, chalky white, and furrowed with wrinkles. His eyes ^®Cf. Doris V. Falk, Eugene O'Neill and the Tragic Tension (New Brunswick, N. J.: Rutgers University Press, 1958), pp. 18-19. Hereinafter cited as Falk, Tragic Ten­ sion . ^Cf.

He has a shiny bald scalp with scanty white wisps of hair. He is 30 wearing a threadbare brown overcoat and is without a hat. He has come into the barn to check on a rope noose he has hung, and his first speech reveals several attitudes: his dislike of children and Catholicism and his use of biblical references to scold and threaten others, all combined with a paranoid suspiciousness.^ His \"thin slovenly worn-out looking\" daughter fol­ lows him and \"warily keens out of range of his stick.\" She reveals his compulsion to sneak out to the barn despite the 32 doctor's orders to avoid walking.

See also James O'Neill, pp. 27-28 and 35 above. 69 In this exposition we further learn about Bentley's relationship with his son. Half-brother to Annie, Luke was abandoned by his mother after \"'carrin1s-on . . . when she got sick of [Bentley] and ran away'\" and then she died when 34 Luke was only five years old. Yet Bentley was \"'fond enough of him all them years'\" until Luke, at sixteen, stole Bentley's money and informed his father that he intended to leave home. This incident caused Bentley to \"turn crazy,\" to curse his son, and to fashion a rope for Luke to hang himself with if he ever came home again. Since then Bentley has tended the rope, kept all from touching it, is fright­ ened lest his son not return, is comforted by reading his 35 Bible, and has occasional \"fits\" where he knows no one. In a senile rage, Bentley curses and beats his daugher. At that point, Sweeney, Annie's husband, arrives and rescues his wife. Sweeney is a stocky, muscular, sandy- haired man, and \"the bony face of his bullet head has a pressed-in appearance except for his heavy jaw which sticks out pugnaciously.\" He has small round blue eyes, and there is a mean cunning about the mouth. Drink has brought out his hostilities. 340'Neill, £laya, I, 580. 35Ibid.. p. 581. 70 After threatening Bentley and commenting on his \"madness,\" his wickedness, and his poor relationship to his son Luke, Sweeney turns his attention to his daughter Mary. He handles her roughly, threatens her, comments on her \"soft mindedness\" and stupidity, and tells her to take Bentley back to the house out of hearing, after roughly disarming 36 him of his cane. Bentley's only response is to quote menacing passages from the Bible. When Bentley is gone, Sweeney discusses Bentley's will with his wife. Sweeney has learned that Bentley has hidden a thousand dollars in cash. He vows to choke Bentley until he reveals where the twenty-dollar gold pieces are hidden. Annoyed by the sound of Mary's laughter, Sweeney 37 discovers that Luke has returned. Luke is playing with Mary by skipping a silver dollar on the sea. \"'I'm learning 38 your kid to be a sport, Tight-Wad,\"1 he tells Sweeney. Sweeney continues to threaten his child, and after plotting with Annie to gain a portion of Bentley's money at Luke's expense, he begins to plan with Luke to find the money. Luke recalls his father on the day he left. He 36Ibid.. pp. 582-584. 37Ibid.. pp. 585-586. 38Ibid.. p. 589. 71 reiterates his opinion that Bentley is crazy, a slave- 39 driver, a raiser, and a \"sly old bird.\" Sweeney and Luke begin to drink together. At that point, Bentley appears and becomes so excited with \"overwhelming joy\" at seeing his 40 lost son that he is speechless with agitation. Bentley even drinks with Luke, and, unable to explain himself, tries to get Luke to use the noose that he has tended for the last five years. It slowly dawns on Luke that his father really wants him to hang himself now that he has returned. Sweeney re­ strains Luke's violent anger and makes use of it to motivate his gain of both the farm and half the money. Determined to \"get even\" for his father's meanness and wanting ready cash, Sweeney easily gets Luke to agree to give up his inheri- 41 tance, and to torture the old man until he reveals the hidden money. They are thwarted in their greedy plan, however, by Mary. Despite her father's intimidation, Mary swings on the noose, pulling it to the floor, and finds a sack of coins tied to the other end. \"Giggling ecstatically,\" the half- •^Ibid. . p. 593. 41Ibid.. p. 599. 40Ibid.. pp. 594-595. 72 witted girl runs offstage to skip the twenty-dollar gold 42 pieces into the sea. The action of the play is centered around the rope noose. Basically, the play is pantomimic, and the pantomime is intended to illustrate the theme of greed and the cor­ rupting influence of money. If we ask to whom the action belongs, we must reply that it belongs to the three men equally or to the rope noose. Bentley exists to explain how the rope was placed, and why it happened to have a thousand dollars in gold coins attached to it. Sweeney and Luke exist to illustrate the corrupting influence of greed. Luke and Mary exist to illustrate the ironic loss and uselessness of the money. As such, there is no protagonist unless we consider the family a group protagonist. All of the family share in portions of the action that interrelate; however, 43 the action itself does not center around any one of them. The play opens interestingly in the conflict between Bentley and his daughter. From this conflict and Bentley's senile, demented, and unpleasant behavior, the antecedent events are revealed. Bentley is the motivating factor. He ^Ibid. . pp. 601-602. ^Adams, \"Dramatic Structure,\" p. 81. 73 motivates Annie to use the biographical facts to scold her father. As a result the audience learns what it needs to know. Even in these antecedent events, Bentley is the moti­ vating force. It was his \"slave-driving\" and \"miser- stinginess\" that caused the death of Luke's mother and re­ sulted in Luke1s stealing of his father1s money and leaving 44 home. From these circumstances the rope is arranged for the use of Luke upon his return. However, during the course of the play, after the exposition, Bentley's role is a pas­ sive one. All he does is quote hypocritical biblical pas­ sages to accentuate his unpleasantness and hypocrisy. Yet again he is the motivating factor at the crisis of the play. The obsession with the noose and the incoherent joy at Luke's return cause Luke to believe his father wanted him to hang himself. Out of anger, a desire for revenge and greediness for immediate cash, Luke gives up his inheritance and agrees to force the old man to reveal the money. The irony of the crisis is that the father really wishes Luke to 45 . . . have the money anyway. Love, distorted, is denied reali­ zation . Sweeney is not passive, however. He initiates the 440'Neill, Plays, I, 580. 45Ibid.. p. 599. 74 action of the play and his intrigue causes the incidents leading to the crisis. The crisis only incidentally leads to the climax, however, because it is the absence of the three as a result of the crisis that allows the half-witted Mary to find the coins that she skips into the sea. Swee­ ney's only relationship to his daughter is one of intimida­ tion. He threatens her and frightens her. She is a target for his hostilities and his scorn. Although it is possible that she inherited her feeble-mindedness from her father, this is not directly stated. However, in this play we have an example of many of O'Neill's ingredients. Both the sly old man and the cunning \"shanty-town Irishman\" attempt to manipulate circumstances for their selfish ends. To this degree they are responsible for the circumstances. Yet the circumstances defeat them and despite their responsibilities these circumstances are largely out of their control. Above all, the characters share a preoccupation with materialistic greed that denies them more meaningful human relationships. Eugene O'Neill wrote Where the Cross Is Made at the request of the Provincetown Players for their production of 75 December 20, 1918. The play was written purely for its own 46 sake \"as an instructive form of recreation. It concerns the influence of an insane delusion of treasure which Bart­ lett holds, on his son Nat. The play opens with Bartlett's son, Nat, talking to a doctor, and it soon becomes clear that Nat is making ar­ rangements to have Bartlett placed in an asylum. For the past three years Bartlett has lived alone upstairs in \"a 47 lookout post at the top of his house\" overlooking the sea. Despite the fact that he knows that the ship he looks for 48 has been lost, he refuses to believe. His delusion had begun when he was shipwrecked and, crazed with thirst, he found what he imagined to be treasure. Despite the trinket which proves the \"treasure\" worthless, Bartlett mortgaged his house to bring it back. Since his wife was dying, he sent the schooner without him. After her death and the loss 49 of the schooner, Bartlett lives only to dream of treasure. The doctor leaves and Nat's sister arrives. She is 46Isaac Goldberg, The Theatre of George Jean Nathan (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1926), p. 151. 47Eugene O'Neill, Where the Cross Is Made. Plays.

In justifying himself, Nat reveals that he is afraid of his father's \"'mad game . . . whispering dreams in my ear . . . mocking me . . . I hate him*. He's stolen my brain I I've got to free myself . . . 51 from his madness.'\" Nat has reason to fear his father's power over him. Bartlett took his son from school and 52 forced him to sea. Because of his father, Nat has become 53 \"'another one of his wrecks'.'\" Bartlett then enters. \"He bears a striking resem­ blance to his son but his face is more stern and formidable. his form more robust, erect and muscular.\" Very tall, gaunt, loose-framed, with stooped shoulders, he has a leather-colored, weather-beaten, furrowed, strong and bony face with a massive head. His bushy brows accompany fierce, deep-set, dark eyes. His thin-lipped mouth goes with his large aquiline nose and bushy moustache. Contrasting with 50Ibid.. p. 563. 51Ibid.. pp. 566-567.

Bartlett strides in \"in a state of mad exultation,\" accuses Nat of trying to put him behind bars, and curses him for mocking his father. Bartlett has seen the return of the 55 Marv Allen, hailed her, and received a signal in return. This abnormal behavior convinces Sue, finally, that Bartlett needs help. Now it is Nat's turn to disagree, \"his eyes wild and exulting,\" as he joins his father in watching the imaginary crew of the Mary Allen bring the heavy treasure 56 chests into the room. Only Sue fails to see the hallucination, which moves upstairs. Bartlett denies his son any part of the treasure, and locks himself into the room above. With the help of Dr. Higgins, Nat forces the door open, only to find the body of his father. In his dead hand is a map. Nat continues \"with a mad, solemn decision.\" He looks to his chance. \"I'll go and I'll find it . . . 'The treasure is buried where the cross is made.'\" The play is interesting because from start to finish ^Ibid.. p. 567. Cf.

Yet the protagonist around which the action cen­ ters is his son Nat. It is also the first clear statement of a son much like his father except weaker, who then turns into a likeness of his father. The father is absent during the exposition, yet the antecedent circumstances concern the father. Nat is taking action to place his father in an asylum. Although inter­ esting, the long exposition is designed to explain the cir­ cumstances that the father has created. Nor is the father present while the basic conflict of the play is explained. Yet the conflict is defined as Nat's fear of his father's insanity, and the effect his father is having upon him. The dramatic question at that point becomes: Will Nat be over­ whelmed by his father's madness? Bartlett bursts onto the scene at the moment of major crisis in the play. O'Neill has carefully prepared the audience for the theatrical qualities that illustrate stage insanity. Bartlett is \"too quiet.\" He walks back and forth all night1 . He has not left the house in three years and he fiercely protects his delusions. He likes the dark­ ness because it helps him to dream. While dreaming, he whispers and calls to the sea, gestures, exults over 79 worthless jewelry and receives great satisfaction from his delusion. Bartlett's entrance and immediate presence illus­ trate the dominating effect he has on his children. Bart­ lett literally teaches his son the delusions he maintains. Nat has been trying to escape this force by hospitalizing his father. But Bartlett curses his son for trying to com­ mit him, and at the climax, overwhelms Nat with the hallu­ cination of the crew of the Mary Allen carrying in the treasure chest. Bartlett's daughter, Sue, represents sanity and tries to bring the men to reality. She soothes and humors her father and tries to protect him. Bartlett ignores and disregards her. Sue thus escapes the hold of his delusions and is the only one who fails to see the hallucination. The crisis which brings about the resolution and death of Bartlett is the threat of removal from the sea. Presumably death is preferred over being denied the materi­ als for delusional behavior. Yet the resolution shows the power of insanity. Nat continues where his father left off. The past has its hold on the present and the sins of the father are visited upon the son. Nat maintains the delusion and the insane fixation on the quest for treasure. 80 Thus we find that Bartlett is the major source of conflict in the play. He caused the chain of events that precipitated the action. He is the major obstacle to the happiness of Nat. By direct example, his impact causes his son to become like his father. Bartlett literally forces Nat to think the way he does, and acts as a constantly de­ manding force on his son, who cannot be free to go his own way. Gold Where the Cross Is Made uses the basic plot idea and the same principal characters as found in Gold, but Eugene O'Neill insisted that GoId was not simply a long version of the short play. He had intended to write the long play all 57 along. There is without doubt a strong shift in emphasis. Bartlett is now the protagonist and the theme shows that true values are destroyed in the pursuit of illusory val- 58 ues. All the action in the exposition of the short play is now shown. Gold opens on the \"barren coral island\" where Bartlett and five crew members have been marooned. All are ^Goldberg, Theatre of George Jean Nathan, p. 147. 5®Skinner, Eugene O'Neill; A Poet's Quest, p. 70. 81 desperately searching for water. Yet Bartlett is physically stronger than all of them and by sheer physical power keeps 59 his men under his will. O'Neill now emphasizes Bartlett's immense strength. \"A tall, huge-framed figure of a man.\" he has a heavy­ muscled body, a massive head with a large, bony, leather- tanned face. \"Bushy gray brows overhang the obsessed glare of his somber dark eyes.\" A determined, tight-lipped gash of a mouth with a bristling gray moustache, and broad stub­ born jaw, with a long aquiline nose are all topped with 60 tangled iron-gray hair. We watch the way he leads his men. In a \"crooning, monotonous voice\" he tells them where to put a heavy chest, allows them rest, drives weakness \"from his brain,\" threatens them, mocks them with scorn, encourages them with his own resolution, and promises them \"'GoldI . . . to buy rum, and wine, and women, too, for the rest o' your life.'\"^ However, Bartlett has other objectives. He will be able to give up whaling just as his wife, Sarah, has wanted. ^9Eugene O'Neill, Gold. Plavs. II, 626. 6Qlbid.j p. 627. See also Eugene O'Neill, p. 31 above, and James O'Neill, pp. 25-26 above. 'Neill, Plays. II, 628. 82 He will go to church and \"'settle down to home'\" with her. \"'We'll make the neighbors open their eyes,'\" with carriages and silks, a big house with shade trees, and the cool sea 62 wind. Comfort, peace with his wife and children, and the esteem of the neighbors is what wealth means to Bartlett. Bartlett further reveals he had always hoped for wealth. At first it was a hope for ambergris. Then it became the prospects of treasure. Yet his savage protec­ tiveness, his uncalled-for anger, his violent punishment of Butler, the cook, and Abel, the cabin boy, when they doubt the authenticity of the gold come from paranoid suspicious- 6 3 ness that Butler and Abel plan to cheat him of his wealth. However, the arrival of a rescue ship, although bringing safety also brings threat. Bartlett and the three loyal crewmen fear the theft of their treasure. Despite Bartlett's knowledge that \"'It's agin the law,'\" he suggests drastic action and permits the Islander, Jimmy Kanaka, to murder both Butler and Abel. Although he denies responsi­ bility, Bartlett supervises the burial and personally hides the chest. \"'In spite of hell,'\" he vows to his treasure, 62Ibid.. p. 629. 63Ibid.. pp. 629-633. \"■‘ I'll dig ye up again.'\"64 When we next see Bartlett, six months later, \"his hair has turned white. There are deep hollows under his cheek-bones.1 1 He "
