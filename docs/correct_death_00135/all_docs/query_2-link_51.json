        "text": "It appears that an Irish pub that closed a couple of years ago could be coming back to its space, though details are few at this point in time.\n\nAccording to a licensing board hearing page within the City of Boston website, Eugene O'Neill's has applied for a liquor license to operate at its former home on Washington Street in the Forest Hills section of JP. An earlier post from the Jamaica Plain Gazette also shows this, with both indicating that Melissa Hunt will be the manager; this is presumably the same person who is involved with Napper Tandy's, a group of Irish pubs with locations in Roslindale, Norwood, Millis, and Walpole, and which had been connected to the original Eugene O'Neill's. More information should be given in next week's hearing, so stay tuned for updates.\n\nEugene O'Neill's closed in the fall of 2017 after being in business for approximately five years.\n\nThe address for the Eugene O'Neill's space is 3700 Washington Street, Jamaica Plain, MA, 02130.\n\nMore from Boston's Hidden Restaurants\n\nEugene O'Neill's in Jamaica Plain Has Closed\n\nby Marc Hurwitz (Also follow us on Twitter at @hiddenboston)"
