        "text": "Fifty years after playwright Eugene O’Neill’s dramatic death in suite 401 of Shelton Hall, the building’s Office of Residence Life honored his life Wednesday by unveiling a new memorial plaque.\n\nMore than 40 Boston University faculty members, students and history buffs attended the event in Shelton’s Music Room, which honored the Nobel and Pulitzer prize-winning playwright.\n\nSeveral speakers, including President ad interim Aram V. Chobanian, honored O’Neill at the event.\n\n‘Eugene O’Neill is one of my favorite playwrights, so it’s special to me to be here,’ Chobanian said. ‘I’m pleased to acknowledge Boston University’s connection with a great artist. A university rests on traditions some important, some trivial and some amusing.’\n\nAccording to theater studies professor Sidney Friedman, O’Neill spent his early life constantly moving from hotel to hotel to support his father’s acting career.\n\n‘These situations are the witch’s brew from which O’Neill’s plays were conceived,’ Friedman said, later quoting O’Neill as saying, ‘I was born in one hotel, and I’m going to die in another.’\n\nEventually O’Neill’s prophetic statement came true in his room on the fourth floor of what was then the Hotel Shelton on Nov. 27, 1953. The author of ‘The Iceman Cometh,’ ‘Long Day’s Journey Into Night’ and ‘A Moon For the Misbegotten’ drank himself to death.\n\nBut some attendees said O’Neill’s influence on Shelton did not end with his death: Many discussed rumors of his ghost haunting the fourth floor.\n\nHowever, Director of Residence Life David Zamojski, a former Shelton Hall resident, said he ‘never witnessed a ghost stalking the corridor as so many students claim to.’\n\nFriedman spoke about the novelty of O’Neill’s work, stating that ‘he tried to reach through the physical boundary of the stage’ to add a new dimension to dramatic performances.\n\nCollege of Arts and Sciences student Sara Bilman unveiled the plaque, which currently rests on an easel. It will be moved once a proper location is found, chemistry professor Scott Mohr said, adding that the plaque will probably be installed next to O’Neill’s picture.\n\n‘The first American dramatist to attain international recognition, today he is considered our foremost playwright,’ the plaque reads.\n\nMohr said he is also interested in honoring O’Neill in other ways in the future, suggesting something ‘with more student involvement such as a reenactment of one of O’Neill’s plays.’\n\n‘I was disappointed in the number of students who attended, although I am impressed by the commitment of many to their classes,’ Mohr said.\n\nHowever, several students did find time to attend.\n\nCollege of Communication sophomore Andrew Schechter said he came because the dedication related to his current studies.\n\n‘I’m into theater and reading a play of his right now, so it seemed like it would be a cool event to attend,’ he said.\n\nChristianna Taylor, a College of Engineering junior, said she came because she ‘didn’t know much and wanted to find out more.’\n\n‘It was nice to hear about. I’m in engineering, so I don’t get a chance to hear about things like the history of Shelton very often,’ she said.\n\nChobanian said he enjoyed taking a break from his normal duties as university president ad interim.\n\n‘It gave me a wonderful view of the breadth of this university,’ he said. ‘It was fun more than fun it was intellectually stimulating. And it’s great to have something that is intellectually stimulating at this point.’"
