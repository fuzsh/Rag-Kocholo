O'Neill was born in a hotel and also died in a hotel.

He spent much of his childhood either in hotel rooms or on trains.

Many critics consider him the father of the modern American theatre.

In 1936 he became the first American dramatist to win the Nobel Prize in literature.

In 1909 he secretly married Kathleen Jenkins, which he concealed untill Kathleen's pregnancy. Kathleen gave birth to Eugene O'Neill, Jr.

Having separated from his second wife O'Neill married Carlotta Montere in 1929.

After O'Neill's birth his mother was addicted with morpheme, which the doctor prescribed her to alleviate the pain.

At his 14th year O'Neill was informed by his family that his birth caused all the miseries to his mother. The information greatly affected his mind and O'Neill resorted to alcohol, narcotics, and prostitutes to soothe this sense of guilt.

O'Neill disowned his daughter Oona for marrying the legendary actor Charlie Chaplin, who was only six months junior to him.

Although O'Neill clearly instructed not to publish the autobiographical play Long Day's Journey Into Night until 25 years after his demise, Carlotta opted to publish it in 1956.

In 1912 O'Neill attempted a failed suicide.

He contracted tuberculosis In 1912.

Due to a severe Parkinson-like tremor in his hand, O'Neill could not write for the last 10 years of his life.
