I was just wondering when Astronautalis would release another album as i've been on a binge since him and Doomtree/Rhymesayers emcee P.O.S. aka Four Fists tore down our Axis of Audio SXSW show. Now the time has come for Andy to release his 4th LP, This is Our Science, on September 13th. The album feature collaborations with several members of Doomtree, including his Four Fists partner P.O.S., Sims and production from Cecil Otter and Lazerbeak, as well as a collaboration with Tegan Quin (of Tegan & Sara) who will appear on the album's first official single, "Contrails." We got our first taste of the album earlier this year with smooth track "Midday Moon" which is currently available to purchase at Astro's Bandcamp page.

City Pages reports that the album will be released around the same time as P.O.S.'s forthcoming new studio album on Rhymesayers and once both rappers have released their forthcoming solo albums, they plan to finish up the Four Fists debut EP. Which i've been waiting to hear ever since it was announced last year. Check out Astronautalis performing 2 new songs, the title track "This Is Our Science" (above) and the upcoming single "Contrails" from Dallas' Homegrown Music and Arts Festival earlier this year as well as the album tracklisting after the jump.
