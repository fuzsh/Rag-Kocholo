Although we haven’t heard much from Bon Iver, this year has proved to be plenty busy for frontman Justin Vernon. In just the last few months alone, he’s collaborated with The Rosebuds and released a new album as Jason Feathers, his joint project with rapper Astronautalis. Now, Vernon’s lent his talents to British folk trio The Staves, producing their latest single, “Blood I Bled”.

Rich and bewitching, the track features crisp harmonies interwoven with inspiring, robust instrumentation. Vernon may not physically make an appearance, but his presence is felt throughout — there’s a hushed, yet haunting poignancy à la For Emma, Forever Ago and resplendent swells of brass that recall moments off Bon Iver.
