(on top?)′ve been saved now\n\nHard reboot can't compute is the a take down\n\nIt never feels like you are ready\n\nTo let′em nail you to the rood\n\nGive Judah's best to the forgiving daddy\n\nIt′s time to start the hard reboot\n\nIt never feels like you are ready\n\nTo let'em nail you to the rood\n\nSay \"hi\" from Judahs to the forgiving daddy\n\nIt′s time to start the hard reboot\n\nIt's time to start the hard reboot\n\n(Yeah/now?) Minneapolis, Moscow\n\nNoize MC and Astronautalis\n\nJust gonna start the hard reboot now\n\nJust gonna start the hard reboot now\n\nGonna start the hard reboot now\n\nWriter(s): Charles Andrew Bothwell, Ivan Aleksandrovich Alekseev, иван алексеев<br>Lyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
