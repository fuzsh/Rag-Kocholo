        "text": "Astronautalis w/ Sarah Jaffe, Transit\n\nBlue Moose Tap House — Saturday, September 27 at 9 p.m.\n\nKnown for his witty freestyling abilities and synth-heavy beats, Minneapolis rapper Astronautalis has garnered praise for his memorable, lively shows, and this Saturday’s performance alongside Sarah Jaffe and Transit at the Blue Moose Tap House should be no exception.\n\nAstronautalis, aka Charles Andrew Bothwell, made a name for himself as a teenager, competing in freestyle competitions and traveling to promote his music. His latest release, This is Our Science, came together thanks to his friends, such as Doomtree affiliates, P.O.S. and Tegan Quinn (of Tegan and Sara), among others.\n\nSarah Jaffe, meanwhile, combines blues and folk roots with her more modern style. Touring alongside Astronautalis in support of her new album, Don’t Disconnect, the Texas native has demonstrated quite a bit of range since her 2010 debut, Suburban Nature, featuring the popular folk tune, “Clementine.” As a multi-instrumentalist, Jaffe isn’t afraid to deviate styles, most notably with her 2012 release The Body Wins, which touts R&B beats combined with pop melodies and smooth, yet enigmatic lyrics.\n\nThis is the last stop on their tour before parting ways, so die-hard fans take note. The show starts at 9 p.m. with the Canadian hip-hop artist Transit."
