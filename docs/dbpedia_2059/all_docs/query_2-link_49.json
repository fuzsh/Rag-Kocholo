I'm super, super, super, super bummed that I'll miss the Cleveland show because it's the day I leave for Chicago and I won't be able to catch any other shows that are remeolty close. The new album is very dope. It's been two years since I've seen him live and now I'm worried it'll be a lot longer since this tour is so damn massive.\n\nI've got tickets for the Boston show. Saw him in San Diego 3 years ago-The show blew me away. Stoked to see him again. He's a true entertainer! One of my favorite albums this year, hands down.\n\nI think Cut the Body Loose is amazing. I am very curious to see what you (@Jason Tate) thinks of he's newest album. Jason introduced me to him, on one of his best year-end of 2011 albums with \"This is Our Science\" on AP.NET- It became one of my all time favorites."
