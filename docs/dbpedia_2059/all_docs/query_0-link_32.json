Severed heads, barbecue, and SXSW BY LOUIS BLACK Parti “The love that loves to love the loves to love the love that love to love the love that loves to love ” - Van Morrison “Madame George” “In the end, in the end In the end, in the end In the end, in the end In the end, in the end In the end, in the end” -John Cale “Guts” South by Southwest 07 is only two weeks away, but, of course, around these parts we’re so deep into it already that we’ve changed our breathing patterns and are trying to remember how to live without sleep and work without break. It’s seven days a week, nine to 10 hours a day now, and compared to most everyone else at SXSW and the Chronicle, for me, those hours are more like vacation than work. By now, the day-to-day of all-yearlong has changed into a different texture, a kind of three-dimensional pattern with floating sur- faces of shifting planes. All so casually but continually moving; taking a step forward or pausing for a thought often finds you ending up in some place very different than where you started. Most of the year probably isn’t all that different, except that it isn’t so obvious that you’re lost among the flotsam and jetsam - floating bits of space, time, detail, words, voices, memory, and work. During this time, I’m not always wearing a beyond-wrinkled, ill-fitting suit and driving a beat-to-hell red Chevy Impala convertible spewing smoke while heading down dirt roads even more wretched than the vehicle. Talking to the severed head wrapped in a stinking, stained bag alongside me with buzzing flies so thick it’s as though they’re inside my head on this brutally hot day. She’s dead and so, obvi- ously, is the head. I’m dead, which I both don’t really know and know only too well, my eyes bloodshot to sunglasses red: Warren Oates playing Sam Peckinpah in the midst of hell. Sometimes it’s better, and, at least, it’s usually different all the time. In the morning there’s no better way to face the day than music. Jonathan Richman’s “Roadrunner,” Grandmaster Flash’s “The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel,” and John Cale’s “Ready for War” used to regularly heat me up for the day. Then, when things got rough, for nostalgia’s sake I’d put on a vest, so I would be ready for the day, ready for anything. Now I just listen to CDs in my car, playing certain songs over and over. Part II Around SXSW I always think of Calvin Trillin’s exquisite celebration of American hoi polloi cuisine, American Fried, where he’s talking about Arthur Bryant’s in Kansas City, his favorite barbecue restaurant. Some time after World War II, it was one of the few restaurants in town that wasn’t seg- regated. Trillin imagines that in the newly integrated U.S. Army a white soldier has befriended a black soldier. They’re hungry and in Kansas City, but they have to keep passing by restaurants. Finally they come to Bryant’s and head inside. Trillin is in near swoon (or as near as he can get to a swoon), noting that they’ve just entered the best barbecue restaurant in the world. For one of the few times in the history of our republic, he goes on to note, virtue has indeed been justly rewarded. Now admittedly I usually start thinking of this because of Iron Works BBQ. Sometimes I’ve actually been forced to speak up to total strangers when I hear them deciding to go elsewhere in town for barbecue, because they figure that since Iron Works is right next to the Austin Convention Center, it must be very tourist-centric. When I’m asked to rec- ommend a barbecue place in and/or around Austin, my list is so extensive, and I tend to go on for so long that usually at some point the folks who have so foolishly asked me just walk away, leaving me babbling to air. Without in any way disparaging those other smoky havens, overhearing such comments, I have to point out that Iron Works was here long before the Convention Center and that it would be truly foolish to let the location discourage one. But this is really the beginning of my Trillin day drift. It’s where I start. The bigger picture is that this is really the magic of and most reliable way to experience SXSW - drifting along with friends, sampling the unknown. Maybe catching a movie you know nothing about or listening to some speaker speculate on next-generation media. Ignoring long lines at some clubs to visit the dozens and dozens of SXSW venues that are easily entered. A voy- age of discovery defined by the unknown and detailed by pleasures unexpected. Part III “From soul to poison soul to poison soul Guts, guts, got no guts And stitches don’t help at all Guts, guts, got no guts Holes in the body, holes in the legs Holes in the forehead, holes in the head Holes in the body, holes in the legs There should never be holes at all There should never be holes at all” -John Cale “Guts” Now usually when writing this column, I try to fully craft positions so that they’re understandable and not toppled by casual objections. I doubt I succeed at this very often, but I do try. Not here, not now. It’s hopeless to try convincing most, especially the easily cynical, too casually hostile, and insistently negative, of anyone’s intentions or ambitions, especially mine. Arguing as to the convictions and concerns of either SXSW or Chronicle staff is not just fruitless but foolish. Rebels, the young, the angry, artists, activists, the saved, and the unwashed all have visions true and pure. Many of them about my evil motivations and unerring corruption. So, let me admit to all and get it out of the way. Yes, it’s true! Whatever, however, and exactly what you know I am up to, I am. I am corrupt, corpu- lent, soulless, blind, and greedy. I’m obscene and dirty; I steal, cheat, lie, forge, and deal. Consciously I’m out to destroy film and cor- rupt music by privileging money, power, and politics over creativity. Anything you feel like adding here, you should. It’s true! Part IV: An Interlude Edited excerpts from a recent e-mail exchange I had with a number of folks involved in an Internet fan group: “What do you do? Respond back in a fucked- up and disrespectful manner to us. Well ... we’re organized, we have our own resources, and we network. So keep it up. We’re about to respond. You think were powerless? Toothless? A bunch of jag-offs? Well ... Okaaaaaaaaay. We’ve seen your type before and were the ones still standing. We’ve been around 10 years. “Just let it drop. Man, I can’t believe how you talk to people. Keep it up! The gloves are about to come off! ” “[What you threatened to do] is so unpro- fessional, I don’t even know where to begin. So, suffice to say: Blow me, you fucking hack. I don’t give a shit what you do or don’t do ... tape it to a vibrator and shove it up your ass. Why anyone would even want such an obvious lowbred, asinine, unprofessional blowhard of an individual - or anyone from an organization that would hire him/her - to review their record is beyond me. I don’t understand the logic behind it. You have confirmed my opinion of journalist’ in every way: a bunch of fucking ink-stained whores. I am also sorry if this condemns your fellow hacks to the same fiery pit in journalistic hell that I condemn you, but fuck, if they didn’t blow your pedantic, jackass brains out the first time they met you, then they deserve it. ” “So quit treating us like a bunch of jag- offs. Quit talking to MY people in a fucked up and disrespectful manner. ’Cause we can bring it on if you want ... “Why do you gotta work at pissing people off?” As to the allegations and accusations I made against myself in Part III, I rest my case. Part V In a very real sense, I’ve never been to SXSW because I’ve been busy working every one. It’s great fun, but one doesn’t actually get to experience it, to watch movies, attend panels, or hear music. Almost every year I take an hour or so off and just stand on a corner watching all the folks from all over the world race from club to club. Often this is as deep into it as I get. continued on p. 6 1512 ) 416*1715 pirtaifi sktJtPtg.iQl.fonn If your last blind date was a comedy, maybe it's time to rewrite the script!

A few years back during SXSW, a whole party of us were eating there. I didn’t eat much, wrapping most of it up to eat later in the wee hours of the morning when our work was, if not done, than at least temporarily subdued. Part of that party was the legendary and amazing Elliot Roberts, Neil Young’s long- time manager, though as important as that is on his list of his credits, it doesn’t actual- ly occupy that much space, relatively speak- ing, in light of all else that he’s done. If you pay attention all the time that you’re with Roberts, it’s educational and just as often enlightening, as well. Certainly this is true about the music business. It’s not just that he’s one of a bare handful of geniuses still working in the industry, although that does count for a lot. It’s that he so completely understands and acts on the belief that the purpose of the business is to serve music and musicians, not the other way ’round. One can also learn many other things from Roberts - grace, patience, enthusiasm, and passion among them. At a Neil Young or Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young concert, it’s always an added pleasure to see Roberts off to one side, smiling and moving, lost in the music, especially when you consider just how many times he’s heard it all. In comparison, as I noted to Nick Barbara just yesterday, it continually amazes me that I make it through this world given how truly inept, tongue-tied, clumsy, and unfocused I am. In much the same way that the Shaggs music sounds like it’s being made by people who’ve never actually heard music but have only had it described to them, my hands operate completely independently of me, only loosely imitating focused motion. On very rare occasions they seem to be doing, at least generally, what I’m trying for, but rather than coordination or skill, this is more along the lines of how a stopped clock is right twice a day. Thus when I finished wrapping the rest of my meal, the package looked like a kinder- garten class’ head-on assault on a wastepaper dump. Shaking his head as he looked at it, Roberts picked it up and headed to the front of the restaurant. A short time later he came back with a package efficiently, economically, and exquisitely wrapped in brown butcher paper. This was Christo to my team of anar- chist tots. I almost asked him to sign it and did plan to keep it as a piece of art rather than opening it. Unfortunately, in the swirl of SXSW, I lost this work. In the best way I can get at it, this is why SXSW is so special to me. Sure, I’m not even broaching the real content, purpose, and/or activities of SXSW, which may make this col- umn seem even more painfully self-absorbed than usual. It doesn’t even begin to touch on the outstanding films, music, panels, parties, workshops, speakers, and so on. It’s akin to talking about a mountain climb in the middle of relating a story of an ocean journey. When I was growing up, food in my house was served without spices, the table usu- ally lacking salt and pepper. One time, as a teen, over at a friend’s house for dinner, I discovered how much better meat tasted when salted. The next time we were in New York City, we went to a Horn and Hardart’s Automat for lunch. There was a glass cylinder filled with white grains on the table. Excitedly I poured it all over my roast beef sandwich. It was sugar. So maybe this story is about salt, and maybe it’s about sugar. Then again, maybe it’s not. ■ POSTMARKS Always There's the Backlash ... Dear Editor, Goodness, the Ann Richards School has yet to even open its doors, and already the backlash has begun. (If girls are getting something, then boys must be losing out! Are we gonna let ’em get away with that?) If AISD Superintendent Pat Forgione can truly stomach the heartbreaking effects of a Webb Middle School diaspora by offering up a boys’ school in its place, then let him bring forward the available research show- ing that single-sex education for boys has any positive effect on their schooling. Positive effect - not neutral. (“Forgione’s BEST-Laid Plan for Closing Webb,” News, Feb. 16.) And while the TEA may argue that it’s caring and responsible to tell Webb children and their parents that their school isn’t good enough for them and so it must close, it’s just more of the same, failing, punitive responses to the same problems. When will they ever learn?

Not So Much Dear Editor, With all due respect, l have to wonder if Katherine Gregor is living in an alternative universe, it is not my experience at all that neighborhood groups are supporters of New Urbanism [‘Developing Stories ,\" News, Feb. 16]. My experience, both with my local neigh- borhood association (Bouldin) and the Austin Neighborhoods Council, is that “New Urbanism” is usually spat out like a swear word. Those of us who support New Urbanism and walkable and transit-oriented neighborhoods are often attacked personally as \"'being in bed with devel- opers\" or receive nasty offline flames. Don't get me wrong, l f d love it if Responsible Growth for Northcross is the beginning of a sea change in attitudes, but remember Crestview is perhaps more responsible than any other neighborhood for killing light rail, and this is the same city that killed Kirk Watson’s New Urbanist Smart Growth policies. Austin spends a lot of energy telling people how “green\" and \"progressive\" it is. Implementing green and progressive policies? Not so much. Chris Cosart [Katherine Gregor responds: l don't disagree. As noted in the column, “New\" Urban is m is now at /east 15 years ago; oniy now is pub- lic thinking in Austin evolving to the point of sophistication where density Is being (grudg- ingly) understood and embraced. But Austin is growing up fast, and attitudes are changing apace . The imperative for swift action to avert giobai warming , and the new Austin Climate Protection Pfan, makes it equally imperative that intellectually honest green-and-progres- s/Ve types champion the sustainable virtues of density over sprawi .] Article Inspires Memories Dear Editor, As a longtime Austinite, l have fond memo- ries of Casiraghi’s and other old Austin restau- rants [“Then and Nau Food, Feb. 16]. Many thanks for Virginia Wood’s researching Old West eateries, and especially for including the original menu. Shelley Bueche A Disservice to Josephine Viscardi Dear Editor, I was bom in Austin on Theresa Street, lived in ' the Josephine House” for four years when Clarksville was nothing more than my hood, and as we both grew, I was proud to be a part of it. But that's another story. Something's been gnawing at me for a couple of days after reading your feature article on the history of the Clarksville area \"Then and Nau” [Food, Feb. 16], This bone I have been chewing on is a statement on p.5G where the author so eloquently noted that my Nonna, Josephine Viscardi, sold her properties. There were four properties involved In the sale, not two, protect- ing them from potential issues with my family or the developer who would have come in for their share of the double-digit profits. The Clarksville Neighborhood Association was wise enough to stop a request for additional parking - in the form of lots - along Waterston Avenue made by the new owners of the properties not long after Nonna died. The owners of Jeffrey's pose inside this article almost like members of the family, and they should because they were treated like family. Got to that statement concerning my family's politics and all my feelings of pride over the article were history. As for my family and the comment made here about them, frankly l find it tasteless and won't take up any more space with it because it doesn’t deserve any. Second bone, I see pictures of a lot of people in this bit, but where is Josephine? How was she not celebrated here, y'all? How? The Josephine House was a nice gesture, but the lack of men- tion beyond that rankles me. There was plenty of opportunity to celebrate her efforts to help the new businesses become what they are today. Her business acumen always took a backseat to higher rents, building maintenance, remodels, real estate deals, the works. My Nunnu died in 1972, and Nonna stepped up to the plate, became head of the household, and flourished in business. She helped the new property own- ers of my heritage tremendously, and someone should have taken the time to say that, but no one did, so I am. Nonna was our family matri- arch, our history without her none of us would be here today or be who we are today because she helped each one of us. I can't even imagine the look on her face if she knew how forgotten she is by the people she helped, even when the family didn’t agree with her. Kathryn Marie Sanders (Henley) aka Kathy Wlison What's Wrong With This Paper? Dear Editor, Austin music legend George Kinney has a new CD out, and your paper is refusing to review it? Additionally, it’s with the Golden Dawn and represents their follow-up release to the legend- ary Power Plant LP put out on the Internationa! Artists label. What’s wrong with your paper? Kiloh R.

POSTMARKS :: FROM P.a a while back when that proposed development was fumigating some people out in North Austin, and you made a short report on that, I think it is great that your paper keeps us updated on the anti-developments , but I don't think it’s nice to slap it in our faces later when defeated by the man with the money in his hand. I support you In getting your ad money from somewhere else. Peace out, Thomas Grzinich /■Editor's note; We keep a pretty strict bar- rier between our editorial and advertising sides.

The city loses the chance to gain $60 million to $75 million in tax base in the form of a mixed-use residential building that could occupy the frame. The federal judges lose an opportu- nity to have their much-needed courthouse years sooner if it were built by the private sector and leased back (a proposal was on the table). In short, a win/win solution becomes a lose/lose expensive disaster, and the GSA loses credibility in addition to about a $5 million profit by selling the frame. (That offer had been made.) The main fact that everyone including the GSA seems to have missed is that the GSA actions directly defy a standing presidential order requir- ing the expenditure of federal money on a courthouse to be spent in an area which needs economic development If there is any one spot in the U.3. right now that doesn't need help from federal spending, it Is the Southwest quadrant of downtown Austin. We should all be very proud of Mayor Wynn for standing up for what would have been best for everyone. Sen. Lloyd Doggett and the offices of all of our elected officials were very cooperative when asked for time to discuss alternatives. austinchronicle.com/postmarks By contrast we should be sickened by the bureaucratic arrogance of the GSA, Scott Armey of Fort Worth in particular, as well as the incred- ible waste of opportunity that will result, SJnc/a/r Black Fellow of the American Institute of Architects Quality Coverage of Education Dear Editor, Over the past few months, as AISD has announced or considered closing/ re purposing a number of local campuses, I have often found myself thinking \"I miss Rachel Proctor May!\" Her in-depth coverage and analysis of AISD issues for the Chronicle was always impressive and informative. Since she left the Chronicle to join Council Member Brewster McCracken's staff, the Chronicle has not had an on-staff education reporter, and I haven’t seen the same level or quality of coverage of local education issues. ! was so pleased to open up last week’s issue to find a well-researched and thought-provoking piece by Rachel's husband, Michael May, [“Left Behind, B News, Feb. 16] and an additional editorial piece by Michael King about the proposed closing of Webb Middle School [“Point Austin,\" News, Feb, 16], Michael King suggested that local school leaders need to be prepared to take positions against state and federal policies that they don’t feel are in the best interest of our children. I would suggest that the entire Austin community needs to do the same. Thank you for keeping us informed on the issues so that we can do that - please keep it up!

Unless we move forward to place firm limitations on appropriations, we will leave this war-making presi- dent restrained only by Dick Cheney’s imagination.” HEADLINES Despite last-ditch efforts to work a deal with the feds, the long-unfinished carcass of the Intel building is scheduled for a demolition by implosion at 7am Sunday morning, to be replaced by a new federal courthouse. As of press time, the city hadn’t officially designated any areas for public viewing; however, an announcement will be made before the weekend. (See “Farewell, Intel Shell,” p.18, for more.) Austin Judge Stephen Yelenosky derailed (at least tem- porarily) Gov. Rick Perry’s 2005 executive order fast- tracking coal-plant permitting - ruling on Tuesday that Perry lacked constitutional authority to dictate an accelerated timetable. See details on p.15. In another slap at Perry’s presumption of executive power, House members announced legislation to over- turn his executive order mandating the vaccination of young girls against the human papillomavirus and said they have at least 90 sponsors for the measure. For the first time in 29 years, the Texas House and Senate both voted to exceed the constitutionally man- dated spending cap in order to pay for last session’s school-finance reform and related property-tax cuts - although no actual budget has been drafted yet. The U.S. Senate failed Saturday to act on a nonbinding resolution against the Bush administration’s escalation of the war in Iraq, as Democrats could not convince enough Republicans to reach 60 votes for closure. The House earlier passed a resolution opposing the increase in troops. Opponents say they’ll now look at other tactics to impose limits on further escalation. - Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Austin, arguing for a nonbind- ing resolution opposing Bush’s “surge” of troops to Iraq. The resolution passed 246-182. NAKED CITY SaveTownLake.org will hold a rally of concerned citi- zens in front of City Hall at 5:30pm Tuesday, Feb. 27. The rally draws attention to new developments proposed directly on the shores of Town Lake, which are seeking variances from the city to build closer to the shoreline than allowed in the Waterfront Overlay District. Specific- ally, the nonprofit hopes to demonstrate strong citizen interest to the Parks and Recreation Board - voting that same night on variances sought by CWS Capital Partners to build condo towers at 222/300 E. Riverside - and the Planning Commission - voting on variances request- ed by Star Riverside development for 1300 E. Riverside. For more, see www.savetownlake.org. - Katherine Gregor Law enforcers from 150 jurisdictions across the state are banding together for the state’s largest-ever war- rant roundup, to begin March 3. Class C misdemeanor scofflaws - folks who have ignored tickets for parking violations, city-ordinance violations, and various criminal charges (such as being drunk in public) - are the main target of the roundup, which includes citations issued locally by APD, and coordinated with warrant enforce- ment activities from around the state. Thousands of notices have been mailed out, and officials are urging offenders to pay up before the roundup. Individuals with unpaid tickets will go to jail, officials warn, which could be an “inconvenience and an embarrassment,” notes a city press release. For more on paying outstanding tick- ets, see www.ci.austin.tx.us/court. - Jordan Smith Have a park-improvement project that you’d like to see happen? Thanks to the Rolling Stones concert held in Zilker Park last fall, the funds could be available. The Stones’ presenters - Capital Sports & Entertainment and Charles Attal Presents - agreed to donate part of the proceeds as a way to “give back” to Zilker Park and the surrounding neighborhoods affected by their events. (They’re doing the same thing with the Austin City Limits Festival.) As a result, the Austin Parks Foundation received $300,000. The city will use half of that to fund the next phase of an irrigation system for Zilker Park, which, appropriately, helps mitigate heavy public use at big events. The other $150,000 is now available for neighborhood park-improvement grants. The eligible continued on p.15 POINT AUSTIN The Lege Provides 'Alternatives' to health care BY MICHAEL KING For a couple of years, Chronicle staff writer Jordan Smith has been following the curious story of the “alternatives to abortion” programs authored by the Legislature and underwritten by Texas taxpayers. Predictably, as Smith reported most recently on Jan. 26 (“No Real Alternative”), the programs have now begun to siphon state money from effective family plan- ning and women’s health care programs into anti-abortion counseling efforts marketed as “crisis pregnancy centers.” Note well that con- tradiction, which has literally nothing to do with abortion: Funding for comprehensive health care is being diverted to feel-good coun- seling (without pretense of medical services) promoting childbirth. Smith’s diligent reporting has had an effect at the Capitol, where House Appropriations Committee members, most prominently Austin Democrat Dawnna Dukes, questioned sharply the misuse of health-care money to fund coun- seling programs and expensive, barely opera- tional programs at that. The Houston Chronicle and the Los Angeles Times picked up the story, and, stung by public exposure, the “alterna- tives” advocates at the Texas Pregnancy Care Network - who now, as then, dodge Smith’s inquiries - attempted a stealth strike-back cam- paign about as effective as the rest of their work. (See “TPCN Flack Attack,” next page.) In their franker moments, the “alternatives” crowd admits that it’s not all that interested in women’s health care. Their true intent is to find ways to “defund” health-care providers that also provide abortion services - albeit not with forbidden tax funds. Their primary target is Planned Parenthood. (“Everyone knows this is a debate over Planned Parenthood and preg- nancy resource centers,” Georgetown Republic- an Dan Gattis told the Statesman.) In that regard, they can congratulate themselves - while they were spending hundreds of thou- sands of dollars (and anticipating millions) to encourage a few hundred Texas women to give birth, they “saved” thousands of other women (mostly uninsured or underinsured) from pro- fessional health care at the hands of medical providers who believe women are adults who can make their own choices. The Los Angeles Times reported the effect of these and related legislative funding cuts, just in Austin: “To deal with its 62 percent budget cut, the Planned Parenthood clinic in down- town Austin began charging for services long offered free to low-income women. Since the fees took effect, the clinic has distributed 40 percent fewer birth control pills and has con- ducted 50 percent fewer Pap smears to screen for cervical cancer. Several thousand patients have stopped coming.” Rep. Gattis and his colleagues should be proud. For more on the Texas Pregnancy Care Network and its defenders, see austinchronicle.com. austinchranicle.com I FEBRUARY 23, 2007 I THE AUSTIN CHRONICLE I 13 news TPCN Flack Attack: No nutritional content BY JORDAN SMITH On Feb. 13, The Austin Chronicle acquired a seven-page docu- ment, produced on Texas Pregnancy Care Network letterhead, recounting a host of complaints about our Jan. 26 news feature, “No Real Alternative,” detailing TPCN’s administration of the new, state-funded Alternatives to Abortion program. The Feb. 1 memorandum is unsigned, but we’ve been told that it originated with the office of Sen. Tommy Williams, R-The Woodlands, who authored and carried the budget rider that created the Alternatives to Abortion program back in 2005. More precisely, the document appears to have been produced by the high-pow- ered political consulting firm the Eppstein Group, led by Bryan Eppstein, which has done campaign work for many GOP lawmak- ers, including Williams. We tried to confirm this provenance from the horses’ mouths, but at press time, neither Eppstein nor Williams’ aide had returned numerous calls requesting comment on the document - supposedly aimed at “correcting” a story we had published. (See the whole document at austinchronicle.com.) That’s not surprising; during the time the story was being reported, TPCN declined to respond to numerous direct inquiries about its government-funded program. According to the memo, a “tabloid publication” (that’s us) had published an article about TPCN that was rife with errors; this memo, its unidentified author writes, is intended to provide “responses to several of the most egregious errors reported in the story” - including that we misled readers about the program’s purpose and progress and raised questions about certain TPCN efforts in a way that unfairly implied an underlying ill motive. The complaints themselves weren’t surprising - our assess- ment of the TPCN program was hardly flattering. Yet none of these alleged errors were ever raised with the Chronicle : Following publica- tion, neither Williams, Eppstein, nor TPCN Executive Director Vincent Friedewald contacted us to complain about errors, to request a retraction, or even to offer a written response for publica- tion. Instead, the memoran- dum was submitted to the Houston Chronicle, in an effort to have retracted a Feb. 1 Houston Chronicle editorial that cited our story and called into question the process by which funding for the Alternatives to Abortion program was appropriated - through a rider offered by Williams, during a meeting of the Senate Finance Committee in March 2005. As we’ve reported over the past year, Williams’ rider set aside $5 million (from family-plan- ning funds) over the biennium to administer a program explicitly intended to “promote childbirth” over abortion, primarily through a network of nonprofits, mostly “cri- sis pregnancy centers” - most run by vociferously anti-abortion groups tion, abortion, parenting, and domestic and sexual vio- lence). By contrast, the providers funded by Alternatives to Abortion provide no medical services at all but must simply guarantee that they will not “promote, refer or perform” abortions. The rider passed without any real debate and without the consideration of lawmakers outside the Senate Finance Committee. A year later, in March 2006, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission awarded the $2.5-million-per-year contract to the TPCN, a brand-new nonprofit whose directors, according to their resumes, have no experience in nonprofit administration nor in women’s health care. Under the contract, TPCN gets a lump sum from the state each month - unlike most other programs funded with federal welfare money, like women’s health-care services, which are reimbursed after services are rendered and documented. In January, we reported that under this system, during FY 06, TPCN had invoiced the state for more than $600,000. Although well more than $100,000 supposedly went to pay for “client services,” it wasn’t until August that the group reported spending any money on services; in that invoice, TPCN reported spending $50.98 on client services. In all, according to TPCN’s numbers, in FY 06 the group served just 11 clients statewide - in essence, at that time, the program had cost $58,086 per client. In its Feb. 1 memorandum to the Houston Chronicle, TPCN and its defenders assert that our reporting of the FY 06 num- bers - based directly on TPCN and HHSC documents, since TPCN declined to speak with us - was “misleading.” Flow it was misleading isn’t clear. The letter says that TPCN was only ready to serve clients during the last three weeks of FY 06, and therefore, apparently, serv- ing 11 clients was a great show of success. While it is true that TPCN didn’t ink its contract with HHSC until March, it is also true that TPCN itself designed the rollout of the program and provided H HSC in late February 2006 a revised plan of action, along with estimates for the amount of money needed to get the program up and running and the number of cli- ents that would be served by the end of the fiscal year. In the end, TPCN missed the mark on many of its own self-designed performance measures, including an estimate that total start-up costs would come in at less than $300,000 and that as many as 350 clients would have received services by Aug. 31. (The memo also offers a revised version of cost-per-client at $52.95, but that number is accurate only if what TPCN calls “client visits” were actual counseling sessions, not walk-throughs, and if it’s allowed to ignore several hundred thou- sand dollars in its own “adminis- trative” costs - a real stretch.) The Alternatives to Abortion program diverted $5 million from actual health-care workers such as these at East Austin's Planned Parenthood clinic, to fund nonmedical \"crisis pregnancy centers\" that directly served only a few women last year. that offer no medical services whatsoever. Lawmakers later told us they felt misled by Williams’ assertion that the rider would not impact funding for traditional providers of preventative medical services for poor women - as in fact it has done. Traditional family-planning service providers - like Planned Parenthood (the best-known but by no means the only group providing reproductive health care for low-income, underin- sured women) - offer a host of medical services (including gynecological exams and cancer and diabetes screenings), as well as counseling on a wide range of topics (including adop- Atumsigned memorand>M 1n to respond to \"several of t e \" 10 9 the \"errors\" are a recent Austin chr °\" ,c ^ S *° V ‘ on d to our questions imaginary, and TPCN w ^ our reS ponse, ahout its programs. The mu memu, • bleataustinchronicle.com. are similarly empty in substance. One is 1S aval that our story “raised questions about the content and quality of educational materials approved by HHSC and purchased by TPCN for distribution to its Service Providers.” This is true: The other objections from TPCN Although we sought to review the materials prior to the story’s publication, we were denied access - first by HHSC, which claimed it did not have the materials, and then by TPCN’s Friedewald, who sent us an e-mail (which we published in its entirety), informing us that “as a small private business” TPCN didn’t have the time or inclination to respond to open- records requests. (Apparently, they’re much too busy writing self-justifying memoranda.) Shortly after our article was published, we were contacted by HHSC and told that the agency had acquired the materials and would be able to make them available for inspection. We reviewed them earlier this month - under the watchful eye of an HHSC representative, who told us she was directed to sit with us during the entire visit. The TPCN memorandum asserts that the group only buys educational materials that “meet high quality standards”; that cite “legitimate authorities, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or ... articles published in peer- reviewed medical literature”; and that it buys no “materials that are political, judgmental, reflect activist sentiments or that contain spiritual or religious content.” Our review of the TPCN materials contradicts those assertions. We found biased materials - many that appear to spin medical information toward a particular political point of view, such as that found in abstinence-only sex education - and materials that cite dubious sources other than medical and/or health authorities. For example, some sources of information were commer- cial interests and not legitimate scientific sources. The pamphlet “Coming Home With Your Baby” refers to a com- mercial Web site, MothersBliss.com, based in the United Kingdom (which sells items for pregnant women, such as lollipops that are supposed to help with morning sickness) as a source of medical information regarding jaundice in newborns. But the MothersBIiss Web site does not cite any legitimate medical authority for any of its information, and a site disclaimer says it is not in the business of “giving med- ical counseling or other professional services or advice” and is not intended “in any way” to “take the place of a doctor’s or a health professional’s advice and treatment.” (At press time, company representatives had not responded to our request for sourcing information.) Additionally, many of the educational materials - pamphlets, brochures, books, DVDs, and videotapes - paid for by TPCN with $75,000 in taxpayer money, according to the state con- tract - are already available for purchase (or, in some cases, for free) from the few legitimate medical authorities they do cite. For example, the pamphlet “Your Baby Learns From Every Experience,” which TPCN bought from the self-described pro- life publisher Heritage House 76, cites as references the National Institutes of Health and the D.C.-based nonprofit Zero to Three (whose work is supported, in part, by the federal gov- ernment and the Boston University Medical Campus), both of which will provide educational materials to nonprofit groups like TPCN without using the Heritage House middleman. In short, the state of Texas (and Texas taxpayers) have paid TPCN to buy materials that are either religious propaganda or that could be acquired directly elsewhere - often at no cost. There is at least one thing in the TPCN memo that is abso- lutely correct. It complains that the Chronicle's “critiques” of the Texas Pregnancy Care Network were based in part on the fact that TPCN doesn’t provide any health care or medical ser- vices to women. But “The Program,” they write, “was never intended to provide medical services.” Indeed. 14 I THE AUSTIN CHRONICLE I FEBRUARY 23, 2007 I aUStinchronicle.com NAKED CITY :: FROM P.13 COVER IT ALL neighborhood associations are Zilker, Barton Hills, and Bouldin Creek (all near Zilker Park), plus Old West Austin and the West Austin Neighborhood Group (which also endure traffic and noise impacts from events) and Rollingwood.

The presentation is part of Round Rock dentist Fredrick Lewcock’s outreach for National Children’s Dental Health Month. With students nationwide losing more than 51 million school hours annually to dental-related illness, schools have good reason to promote pre- ventative care, especially to low-income children, among whom 50% of tooth decay goes untreated. To meet those children’s needs, Travis County’s Title I schools have partnered with the St. David’s Community Health Foundation Leadership, whose five mobile clinics (up from last year’s two) allow volunteer dentists to perform free exams and even tooth extractions right on school grounds. Last year, the program screened 30,000 children and treated 5,000, and while it will triple those numbers in 2007, “It doesn’t even begin to touch the need,” says program director Marsha Cook. - Nora Ankrum Austin teachers are eligible for a grant that could provide up to $10,000 to create or supplement arts and music classes.

BEYOND CITY LIMITS Opponents of dirty coal rejoiced Tuesday evening when a Travis County district judge issued a temporary injunction instructing state administrative hearings judges to ignore Gov. Perry’s 2005 executive order fast-tracking coal-plant permitting as hearings were set to begin Wednesday on six TXU plants, con- solidated into one case under Perry’s order. The hearings were set to proceed at press time, with the possibility of being delayed and rescheduled at a slower pace; the ruling could have broad implications on the state’s proposed 17-plant coal rush. Austin Judge Stephen Yelenosky upheld arguments brought by two rural citizens groups - directly impacted by the plants and overwhelmed by the fast-track - that Perry lacked the constitutional authority to dictate an accelerated timetable to State Office of Administrative Hearings judges, who hear public testimony and recommend or deny permit approvals to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Tuesday night at the Waco Convention Center - rallying behind the Texas Cities for Clean Air Coalition, a group of 36 cities, counties, and school boards organized by Dallas Mayor Laura Miller - Steve Sussman, the coalition’s pro bono lawyer, told the crowd that he seeks to prove there is no energy crisis and that TXU’s billion-dollar 11-plant plan has nothing to do with affordable energy and everything to do with locking out competitors (including cleaner alternatives) while pumping as much carbon dioxide as possible into the air in hopes of profiting from anticipated federal climate-change emissions cap and trade laws. Sussman says he has the wit- nesses and high-level TXU documents to prove it. - Daniel Mottola On a related note, the new report, “Tackling Climate Change in the U.S.: Potential Carbon Emissions Reductions From Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy by 2030,” released recently by the American Solar Energy Society, rep- resents perhaps the most comprehensive road map for what the U.S. can do to halt and reverse the effects of climate change. With contributions from the nation’s top scientists, engineers, and energy experts, the report also defini- tively illustrates how we can curb climate change while maintaining ample energy supplies without resorting to outdated and polluting fossil-fuel sourc- es. Depicted in unique wedge graphs, the report lays out precisely how key carbon reductions can be achieved through phasing out fossil-energy sources while phasing in energy-efficiency measures and renewable-energy resources. Edited by Chuck Kutscher of the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the report combines the results of six individu- al reports examining possible carbon reductions from energy efficiency in buildings, transportation, and industry and from renewable-energy technolo- gies.

Don Hutto Residen- tial Center after 3V2 months of incarceration. The woman, who is from Honduras, entered the U.S. illegally by crossing the border on foot, a victim of domestic violence seeking asylum in the U.S. “In many Latin American coun- tries, police departments don’t protect victims of domestic violence,” explained Frances Valdez of the UT Immigration Center, who is representing the woman. Valdez says that her client, whose identity is being kept secret for her protection, was offered help from a stranger who, after finding her walking on the side of the road with her children, took them to his home and helped her contact her mother, who lives in Houston. The next day, the man’s Hundreds of people marching and chanting, \"Save Webb! Save Webb,\" stopped traffic on St. Johns Avenue in Northeast Austin Saturday, as part of an annual neighborhood march and celebration. The march ended at Webb Middle School, which Austin Independent School District has proposed closing because of low Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills test scores. St. Johns Neighborhood Association vice president Alan Weeks and PTA president David Delgado rallied the crowd with a speech > translated into both English = and Spanish. \"Don't close the < school! Webb is getting better; | let that continue. Webb Middle School needs you! Webb is growing strong!\" Student activist Luis Orozco, a former Webb student, took the sentiment one step further. \"We need to call our representatives,\" he yelled, growing hoarse, \"and tell them we want our school! We will not allow the district to close Webb. We won't allow it! Is that clear?\" The crowd erupted in applause - before heading to the cafeteria, where the St. Johns neighborhood was proving it could throw a hell of a party. - Af.Af. wife apparently talked the woman into turning herself into U.S. Immigration authorities, saying that they would help her. Instead, she and her daughters were arrested for being in the country without documentation and wound up in the prison-turned-“residential facility” north of Austin in Taylor, with a bond set at $18,000, plus separate $3,000 bonds for her children. Valdez’s client couldn’t pay, so she remained in custody until her sudden release on Friday. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials could not answer questions about the decision to forgo the bonds and release the family on their own recognizance; ICE spokeswoman Nina Pruneda only said, via e-mail, “If a detainee needs to be released from ICE custody due to medical reasons, ICE and [Public Health Services] will determine that on a case by case basis.” No matter the reasoning, members of Texans United for Families, which has led numerous protests and vigils to draw attention to the facility, are pleased with the outcome. “We don’t know exactly why they chose to release her, but we’d like them to exercise that discretion more often,” says Rebecca Bernhardt of the American Civil Liberties Union, part of TUFF. - Diana Welch Spc.

Around 200 activists will descend on Wimberley next weekend, March 2-5, for the eighth annual Radical Encuentro camp, a grassroots-organizers conven- tion of sorts that, in true light-footprint fashion, gathers at a campsite rather than a conference center and features three vegan squares a day in lieu of the usual coffee and pastries. Radical Encuentro (www.radicalencuentro.org) started as the Radical Education Community but later adopted the Zapatista- coined “encuentro” - “encounter” - as more descriptive of its gatherings, which bring together diverse activist groups not only for skills-training and issue education but for meaningful encounters (or, as they put it, “building solidarity,” an arguably more eloquent turn of phrase than its conference- speak counterpart, “networking”). RE will include workshops on everything from media skills to “creative strategic campaigning,” with a special focus this year on utility company TXU’s 11 proposed coal plants. While global warming is on the tip of everyone’s tongues right now, RE’s 2007 theme, Climate Change and Climate Justice, emphasizes not just the science of the matter but its disproportionate impact on different groups of people; panels include members of New Mexico’s Dine tribe, who are fighting coal extraction from their land, as well as Appalachia and Gulf Coast residents. - N.A.

How dense? And do we want it in our back yard? In Austin, broad questions of land-use and planning policy typically get addressed, by default, through City Council reviews of controversial individual projects. That’s a weak sub- stitute for comprehensive urban planning, but doin’ it at the dais is a time-honored tradition in Austin. A hefty list of con- tested development issues - including many proposed proj- ects whose scopes would significantly reshape their Austin neighborhoods - made the agenda at last week’s Feb. 15 City Council meeting (see “Pulling Our PUDs,” at right). Here’s a spotlight on one project with important urban-plan- ning implications: the future of the Concordia campus. The Project: Redeveloping the Concordia University campus The Backstory: The former Concordia Lutheran College is moving to a new campus in far North Austin and selling off its Central 22-acre campus (on the west side of 1-35, north of 32nd) to developers, who plan to redevelop it as a dense mixed-use project. The Hancock Neighborhood Association wants less height and density, and a better-designed project, than the developer had proposed. Despite regular meetings since last summer, the neighborhoods had been unable to wring an acceptable project from the developer and its repre- sentatives, whom they characterized as unwilling to respond in meaningful and substantive ways to citizen concerns. The Players: Developer: East Avenue IG LP (out-of-town inves- tor group represented by Andy Sarwal, former general counsel for Grande Communications) Developer’s attorney: Richard Suttle, Armbrust & Brown Neighborhood’s attorney: Nikelle Meade, Brown McCarroll Architect: Larry Speck, Page Southerland Page At Issue: How tall and dense should it be? Council must vote on whether to grant the developer’s request to rezone the property as high-density mixed-use and to create a planned unit development granting broad entitlements. The developer hopes to win council approval on March 8; its contract to buy the land runs out March 31. If that deal falls through, it could in turn jinx Concordia’s acquisition and development of its new campus up north. Council action: Vote deferred to March 1, with the public hearing kept open The News: To break the deadlock in negotiations, ROMA Design Group has been brought in to work for at least two weeks with the parties to devise a stronger, clearer - and hopefully, mutually acceptable - redevelopment plan. At the urging of Brewster McCracken and other council members, the developer is footing the bill for ROMA to craft a better site design (working on behalf of both sides) and for legal counsel for the neighborhood association, to level the playing field. Meade says the developer “got a clear message from council that they couldn’t just bring the project like it was” and win the rezoning case over neighborhood objections. So, as Suttle cracked at council, “We finally got some adult supervision to help us get this done.” Meade reports that real progress is at last under way. “ROMA has been able to help the neighbor- hood representatives focus on what really impacts our lives, what really matters. And they’re helping the developer see that in Austin, for a project of this magnitude, you have to get the community involved and on board, to get your project done.” The Devilish Details: The Hancock Neighborhood Plan (which predates the campus sale) calls for mixed-use development that is “neighborhood friendly, neighborhood scaled, and serves neighborhood needs.” Instead, the developer wants to build a high, dense “mini-downtown” on a regional scale, with 300,000 square feet of offices (largely medical), 400,000 square feet of retail, a hotel, and about 1,400 shops and condos. The Hancock neighbors (and Eastwoods Neighborhood Association) have opposed the proposed 20-story buildings, high-rises directly across from homes, and the intense traffic the project will generate, likely to overflow onto neighborhood streets. City staff members have recommended less dense mixed- use zoning as being more compatible with the neighborhood plan. The Design Commission has recommended that the redevelopment be “regarded as a major transit-oriented devel- opment,” with future streetcar and commuter rail. It also noted, “The PUD as presented is lacking the kind of detailed information upon which substantive recommendations and agreements can be made,” and continued, “While current PUD application requirements may have been met, urban infill pro- posals such as this one may require greater information and detail, and this should be considered by council in the future.” Commentary: Engaging a knowledgeable urban design- er to help shape a better project on such a significant urban infill site is a positive and, dare we say it, rather painfully obvious solution here. As Meade observed, “It is such a shame this didn’t happen months ago.” (Where were Larry Speck and PSP?) “The work ROMA has done in such a short time is phenomenal. We’re thrilled! And the developer is seeing some real benefit, too.” While urban designer Jana McCann had said that four to five months should be allowed to properly design a site of this size and com- plexity, ROMA is fast-tracking the project to tailor a work- able site plan before council meets again on March 1. The other key issue here is the perennial problem with PUDs. While PUD zoning is intended to result in better, more holistically conceived projects on large sites, coun- cil is too often granting them without requiring sufficient detail to ensure a quality project. (Another prime exam- ple is the just-granted Fairfield PUD at the Hyatt on Town Lake, where the developer of the adjoining AquaTerra condominiums, Crescent Resources, footed the bill at the 11th hour for its own architect, Rhode:Hurt, to draw up a bet- ter PUD site plan.) ROMA’s McCann and team now are working to fill in many of the blanks that had troubled neighbors for the Concordia site. Within the PUD, they’re drawing internal roadways, laying out city blocks, siting smaller buildings adja- cent to homes, and otherwise addressing specific issues of concern to the Hancock neighbors. If the effort ends well, it could provide a useful new model for battle-beleaguered Austin. Clearly, something needs to change. With large-scale developments threatening to alter neighbor- hoods all over town, the city needs a more sophisticated approach to get the best possible projects on sites like Concordia, of significant size and sensitivity. Why not make it standard policy to provide - or at least require of the developer - an experienced urban designer to facilitate superior solutions for all such key sites? Engage experts - early on - to ensure that big projects reflect not only neighborhood plans and prefer- ences but the city’s design guidelines and sustainability goals. (Far more productive than expecting win-win solutions from law- yers, and far more fair and reasonable than putting the job on the backs of untutored volunteers at neighborhood associa- tions.) Many other large sites, such as Northcross Mall, cry out for intervention by a top-notch urban designer. In adopting such a policy, the city would be executing its public responsibili- ty to see that major developments on key sites are optimally conceived and executed. Good urban design has become an indispensable part of the infrastructure now necessary for Austin to grow, while remaining a great and livable city. Noted Meade, “We’re a special community, so these compa- nies that want to do business in Austin need to give us equal- ly special projects, just as they do in other cities that require them to think outside the box.” The Migas Retention Fund In the silver-lining department, the plight of Las Manitas and Escuelita del Alma has led to a new city program that could help not just the iconic Tex-Mex joint and Spanish-immer- sion child-care center but other small businesses forced by new development Downtown into expensive relocations and renovations. City Council approved last Thursday a new Retail Retention and Enhancement Program for Congress Avenue - and expanded it to East Sixth Street. RRE Program funds will come from fees paid to the city by Downtown developers, in a nice bit of social justice. The 12-month pilot program, billed as an economic development initiative, makes low-interest loans of up to $250,000 available to help existing business- es - shops, galleries, restaurants, and so on - cover the costs of being displaced. The loans also are available to help new retail businesses locate on those streets. (Initially, the loans will be available to qualifying businesses on Congress between 11th and Town Lake and on East Sixth between Fundraiser alert: An exceptional lineup of musical talent has volunteered to play at this Friday’s A Concert of Voices to benefit Escuelita del Alma and Las Manitas.

Locally owned, minority-owned, and women-owned business- es will receive preference for the need-based loans. Score three for three for Las Manitas and Escuelita! Funds can be used for street-front and interior improvements and for new business equipment. For complete program information, con- tact Sue Edwards at the city of Austin, 974-7820. The program guidelines reminisce about the healthy Downtown Austin of the pre-mall 1960s, when numerous major department stores and more than 100 small retailers were Downtown, and reference decades of studies and reports calling for the revitalization of retail Downtown. But it took the outcry over Las Manitas and Escuelita to actually put money in the pot. Certainly the program syncs up well with the city’s requirements for ground-floor retail space in all new buildings. An interesting clause addresses “Special Circumstances.” For existing businesses that remain within the zone (does that sound like Las Manitas, moving two doors down, or what?), the city may, at its discretion, choose to increase the loan amount to $750,000 - of which the outstanding loan balance may be forgiven after five years if the joint is still open and the payment record has been good. That figure corresponds nicely with construction-cost estimates for the renovations of the building at Congress and Third, also owned by Las Manitas owners Lidia and Cynthia Perez. Perhaps to the outside world, the whole idea of City Council passing an ordinance with special treatment to help save the politicos’ favorite taco joint makes Austin sound weird. But then, that would be the point. - K.G. 16 I THE AUSTIN CHRONICLE I FEBRUARY 23, 2007 I aUStinchronicle.com news Council Watch: Pulling their PUDs BY WELLS DUNBAR Popquiz:Thefollowing statement, “Austin has clearly become the next Texas boomtown,” appeared in the following: 1) New Chamber of Commerce pamphlet, “Austin: Just Send Us Bags of Cash” 2) “Wynning Edge,” the Mayor’s new collection of motivational lectures 3) The New York Times 4) None of the above If you chose 3, well, you’ve pinned the point tower on the site plan. Last week, the Times ran an article about Our Fair City, “It’s Also the Texas Capital of Construction,” highlighting the local building frenzy. In a show of hospitality, last week City Council did its best to keep the cranes moving. On the infill agenda last meeting, two items seeking similar zoning raised interest - along with a question for the discerning city planner: Is PUD the new VMU? If you’re choking on your alphabet soup, PUDs are “Planned Unit Developments.” According to city code, PUD zoning fits “large or complex single or multiuse development that is planned as a single contiguous project ... under unified control.” A perfect example of this kind of project is the proposed Concordia development, with its self-contained ideal of a miniature downtown (see “Developing Stories,” facing). (Whether the Eastwoods and Hancock neighborhood groups will find living near an exciting, extrapolated urban center its own reward - or whether the ensuing traffic is just gravy - are entirely different questions.) Regardless of its merits, the Concordia team has a specific idea of what it wants and, with PUD zoning, a hope of achieving it. Meanwhile, down along the lakefront, there was concern that the PUD just didn’t cut it. There, the Town Lake Hyatt was up for rezon- ing as a planned unit development. Detractors - nearby business owners and other developers with designs on the area - argue that granting the zoning tabula rasa (minus specific plans aside from more condos) is irresponsible on the city’s part. Unlike responsible city plan- ning, it’s potentially akin to any one of the interchangeable episodes of real estate porn littering basic cable - Flip My PUD, anyone? Yet presented with a Town Lake project not begging for any setback variances, council decid- ed its energies could be better directed else- where. Mercifully, late agreement between the developers and nearby property owners blunted the sharpest corners, but the development del- uge the Times describes will only worsen if the city continues to treat zoning as laissez-faire. Too many condo projects that include a perfunc- tory nod to “mixed use” better resemble Winston Churchill’s thoughts on vermouth in his martini: A glance at the bottle will do. With our fever-pitch construction telegraphed to the world, the city needs more precisely to steer and shape the future of development through the zoning tools it has - instead of bestowing permissive agreements, few concessions asked. The age of the undifferentiated boom is over. Miscellany: The detritus of construction lit- tered the rest of last week’s agenda. Briefly: • The Las Manitas-inspired Retail Retention program for Congress Avenue was expanded to envelop Sixth Street, with the caveat that bars aren’t included (there’s a joke in there somewhere). • The CLB Partners’ 400-foot tower at Sev- enth and Rio Grande, amidst a whirlwind of neighborhood controversy, was approved on first reading. • The Big Box Ordinance creating expanded notification, hearings, and conditional-use per- mitting passed on final reading. • Dark horse in the controversy sweepstakes was Item 73, overseeing billboard relocation. Surprise-the recipients didn’twantthem either! With the variances denied, the discussion was put on hold for now. Council’s meeting is cancelled for this week, but that doesn’t mean they’re off the hook: Instead, this Friday is a City Council work session -none of this “retreat” business- inside council chambers. Onelastaside: Lastweek’s column on the size of the Northcross Wal-Mart drew several responses, not the least of which came from KXAN’s own Chris Willis. Going with a revised Northcross site plan, Willis insisted the proposed store would still be smaller than the two other stores I cited. Staying with the 225,085 square feet on file with the city as of my writing last week, Northcross would still outsize the Ben White Wal-Mart, but, by Willis’ numbers (includ- ing those nature-forsaken garden centers), the Norwood Boulevard Wal-Mart by 183 would edge out Northcross. Which I’m sure will calm all the neighbors down. I mean, what’s the big deal?

(That’s about the average length of a development cycle, by the way.) And, to mix a meta- phor, the project offers a fascinating barometer of the chang- ing winds that have blown Downtown since 2000. When Intel selected Austin as the site for a new 10-story, $124 million chip-design center, we gloated that our town was hotter-than-hot. Winning the new Intel project symbolized all that was robust about Austin’s economy and the revitalization of Downtown, in those high tech glory days. But as the econo- my slowed, in March 2001 Intel abruptly stopped construction - a harbinger, as it turned out, of the deeper economic down- turn to come after 9/11 later that year. As the ugly Intel shell sat forlorn and abandoned from 2001 to 2004, it came to painfully symbolize all of Austin’s broken economic develop- ment dreams. (And to some, the folly of the rich $15 million incentive package the city had provided Intel to build it.) In 2004, the U.S. government finally closed a long-simmer- ing deal to buy the site for a new federal courthouse. City leaders expressed relief and gratitude that at last the prime site fronting Republic Square at Fifth and San Antonio would gain a respectable new structure. But the timeline has dragged out; the U.S. General Services Administration now talks of construction starting in 2009, with the courthouse opening in 2012. Under local pressure to at least clear the site, the GSA this month announced an “implosion event” to take down the long-derided skeleton - with the pyrotechnics scheduled for this coming Sunday morning, Feb. 25, at 7am. (What fun!) But did this announcement that the despised Intel shell would at last disappear like a bad dream make Downtown boosters happy? No! Suddenly, they wanted to save it! Just in the past few months, civic visionary Sinclair Black had rallied supporters - including the mayor, the Downtown Austin Neighborhood Association, and the Downtown Austin Alliance - around a whole new idea for the Intel shell: Trade up, use the existing frame for a more vibrant condo project with ground-floor retail (or even the Austin Museum of Art), and build the same courthouse design somewhere else. To prove up the market viability of the idea, local developer Andrews Urban offered the GSA $13 million for the site (said to represent a $5 million profit, plus a savings of the $1.3 mil- lion demolition cost). Even more impressive, the developer had a lender in hand willing to immediately finance a privately constructed courthouse - to be built far sooner on another site, with a lease-purchase option for the feds. The idea was creative, entrepreneurial, forward-thinking - and far too weird for the federal bureaucracy. Saying it was simply too late in the game to change its course, the GSA and If you live in or near Downtown, prepare this thought for that 7am moment when the big boom of implosion wakes you from a dead sleep: No, it's not a terrorist attack. the federal judges turned the propos- al down cold. Yet, the site still will sit empty for at least two more years. Perhaps the most compelling case made by Black is this: A standing presidential order directs that the funding of federal projects be used to promote eco- nomic development in areas that have suffered from disinvest- ment. When Rep. Lloyd Doggett first started wooing the feds to the site in 2002, perhaps it qualified. But in million-dollar- condo-crazed 2007, the idea that Downtown Austin needs a federal investment to rebound seems pleasantly ridiculous. So why isn’t the Eastside getting the courthouse? Then again, development cycles being what they are, Downtowners just might be grateful for that courthouse when it finally starts in 2009 or in 2012. Special note: If you live in or near Downtown , prepare this thought for that 7am moment when the big boom of implosion wakes you from a dead sleep: No, it's not a terrorist attack. - Katherine Gregor Capitol View Corridors Update County officials appear unlikely to want to pursue an exception to the Capitol view corridors this ses- sion. After a lengthy presentation by consultants - and some discussion from the dais - County Judge Sam Biscoe said he could only conclude that it was unlikely the court could present a unanimous front on the corridor issues - specifically all five members of the court voting to use one of two proposed county- owned sites for a new civil courthouse. Nor did the commissioners appear particularly inclined to con- demn anything else Downtown and take it off the tax roll, an idea that appeared particularly repugnant to Commissioner Gerald Daugherty. Instead, Commissioner Margaret Gomez raised the possibili- ty, once more, of using the Stokes Building site for a courthouse site. That, however, would mean serious logistical headaches for the county. Biscoe said he would put the issue back on the agenda for a final vote next week. - Kimberly Reeves Capitol view corridors came out of a Capitol view preservation study issued by the city in February 1983. Since that time, the number of protected views of the Capitol has grown to 35. Initially, the city designated only 10 views of \"greatest public value.\" - K.R. 18 I THE AUSTIN CHRONICLE I FEBRUARY 23, 2007 I aUStinchronicle.com SM Us Dilemm 'GREAT !
