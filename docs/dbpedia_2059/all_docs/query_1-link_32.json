        "text": "Introducing a new, occasional feature (i.e we'll do it once and forget about it) exploring a semi-random MySpace band page)\n\nThe Band: The Berg Sans Nipple\n\nAt: http://www.myspace.com/thebergsansnipple\n\nDownloadable tunes? Nope\n\nThey say: Tropical / Melodramatic Popular Song / Roots Music\n\nThey sound like: Music to skip to in space elevators\n\nThey look like: Mathematicians going on A Place In The Sun\n\nHow many friends? 2138, including Ghostface Killah, Grizzly Bear and Maggie Horn\n\nHave they reskinned? Nope, it's the standard MySpace skin\n\nDo they blog? A little, but it's mostly of the buy/try sort\n\nBest comment: so i randomly heard your record when it was randomly put on at the record store, and i wasn't even listening to it. i had headphones on. the music got softer, and i noticed the keyboards. i took off my headphones and couldn't stop listening. i listened to two songs and said, \"i think i'm gonna buy this!\" so i did. and so far, it's my cd of the year. everyone i've introduced to your music has liked it a lot. cheers!\n\nDo we learn anything? \"Once rumored to have been Siamese twins separated at birth (according to them, their relationship is really much closer to that of Ghost Dog and the ice cream vendor), the reality is only more mundane at first glance.\"\n\nDo you really want to add The Berg Sans Nipple as a friend? If you like computery tunes, yes\n\nThe thought of McFly being blasted into space is one to cheer the sould on a cold winter's morning, although the apparent plans to bring them back as well takes the edge off slightly.\n\nThey're supposedly going to do something linked to Richard Branson's supposed holiday-in=space company.\n\nEven if the technology exists, and Branson's underwriters let him go ahead, this won't be until 2009 at the earliest, so it's quite a leap of faith to assume that McFly will still be a going concern by then. It's always dodgy planning to put musicians on spaceflights too far ahead of time - NASA had a terrible time explaining to Eddie Fisher why he lost his seat on the manned trips to the moon - but even if Branson was blasting idiots off into space tomorrow, would the very rich really want to be entertained by a band aimed at nine year-old girls?\n\nStill, at least in space, nobody can hear you scream \"they're a bit like a poor man's Busted, aren't they?\"\n\nYou'll find them - \"them\" in this case being Femi Kuti, Akli D and Ba Cissoko - on tour at the following places:\n\nFeb 14 - Leicester - De Montfort Hall\n\n15 - London - Barbican Centre\n\n16 - Liverpool - Philharmonic Hall\n\n18 - Edinburgh - Usher Hall\n\n19 - Manchester - Bridgewater Hall\n\n20 - Gateshead - The Sage\n\n21 - Northampton - Royal & Derngate\n\n22 - Warwick - Arts Centre\n\n23 - Poole - The Lighthouse\n\n24 - Basingstoke - The Anvil\n\n26 - Brighton - Dome\n\n27 - Bristol - Colston Hall\n\nAkli D and Ba Cissoko's sets from Liverpool will turn up later on the Andy Kershaw programme, which - in a spot of Peelesque downgrading - shifts from its usual Sunday night slot to a new home of 11.15 on Monday evenings on BBC Radio 3. We presume that it does a lot of its business on listen again, and so the actual TX doesn't matter much, but it's still a shame to see one of the most consistently interesting programmes on British radio shoved back another hour into the dark.\n\nHeather Mills insisted just before Christmas that if she was a gold digger, she'd have lots of money. And besides, she had lots of money of her own.\n\nWe didn't quite understand the logic. But if she thinks the fact she's not rich proves, in some way, that she's not after Paul's money, she's copper-bottoming the proof: the Evening Standard reckons that Mills has driven herself into debt with the divorce battle.\n\nOr rather, that Mills believes McCartney has deliberately drawn-out the legal battle in order to wear down Heather's resources so that she'll have to accept a lower settlement as she won't be able to afford to carry on fighting. Although the Standard then says that because Paul has drawn out the legal battle, it means Heather is needing to seek more money because she needs to pay more legal bills.\n\nThe sense it's all being made up hangs over it all.\n\nMore years ago than I suspect either of us would care to remember, Simon Breed came into the Trading Places cafe in Liverpool to announce he was heading off to London to seek his fortune. Trading Places isn't there any more, swept away as an early casualty of the city council's policy of encouraging the cultural life of the city by making it unsustainable to run a small arts-centred business anywhere near the heart of the place.\n\nSimon Breed is, however, still going (although we have heard speculation that property developers are interested in hollowing out the back of his head to put in an All Bar One) and just about to head off out on tour:\n\n10 February The Stage Door, Waterloo, London\n\n16 The Spitz, London\n\n1 March The Enterprise, London\n\n5 The Bleeding Hearts Club, Prince Albert, Brighton\n\n12 The Social, London\n\n24 The Windmill, London\n\nYou might notice a rather Londonesque bias in that tour, but there's a limit to what you can do with an Oyster card. (We're guessing the Brighton date is going to use the old Preston Park dodge.)\n\nSo, this is the future, then: Morrissey fans getting together to propel Life Is A Pigsty into the charts.\n\nWhy, though? Why?\n\nYes, chart rules make it possible. But does that make it desirable?\n\nSurely the danger is that - rather than entering the top five and showing how large Mozzer's fan base is - it limps into the lower reaches of the top forty? It could end up looking like that Frasier Crane demonstration where the depth of affection was undeniable and obvious as its lack of breadth.\n\nA similar project, It Should Have Been Number One, at least has a clearer mission. It's setting out to be like a musical Sam Beckett, seeking to put right what once went wrong, giving songs which never got to the top first time round a second chance. You don't need Hologram Al, though, to see the problems here.\n\nFirst, there's something noble about the way, say, Vienna never made it to number one - arguably, it's done more to keep the song fresh in the popular memory than if it had got to the very top. The last thing its record needs is a patronising hands-up.\n\nSecond, they're starting with Roll With It. Which, surely, is the walking definition of a single that shouldn't have been number one. Unlike Ultravox, who lost out to a song that was tapping a different market, Oasis knowingly and willingly entered into a chart battle with Blur, and were beaten by the better single. Now, much as we'd love to see someone set up a campaign to try and give Brighton and Hove Albion the victory they could have had in the 1983 FA Cup Final, I can accept they were lost and that's why the records say that. Trying to give them a victory on the basis of a show of hands a decade or more later doesn't really count, does it?\n\nThe horse-frightening Daily Mirror website redesign this morning (and who knew that the terrible Times Online wouldn't be the worst national newspaper web relaunch this week?) must send something of a shudder through the four remaining shoulders of the 3AM Girls - they've slipped from having a direct link just under the masthead to being two-clicks from the front page. And the \"showbiz extra\" which used to sit beneath their page has now risen to push them below the fold.\n\nWe're sure this has been explained positively to them, though, in the same way old people in hospital are told they're being moved closer to the door for the view.\n\nWe're starting to think that Michael Jackson has already remade his career, and rather than returning to music, his new job is popping up talking to rich people all over the place.\n\nHe's now allowed himself to be spotted taking lunch with Simon Fuller, setting a tongue-clack that Fuller is going to bring Jackson back to the top.\n\nAfter all, if Fuller could make a success out of such difficult cases as Victoria Beckham solo, the movie from Justin To Kelly, S Club 8 meets Kids From Fame series I Dream, and the 21st Century Girls, how could he fail with a one-man circus widely perceived to have got up to funny business with young kids, whose creative peak was getting on for three decades ago?\n\nUnless Fuller has connections to Ripleys Believe It Or Not.\n\nBloody hell, Sharon must be winning a fortune on that Gala Bingo website. This year's Ozzfest is going to be free, with all costs being met by tour sponsors.\n\nIt's quite a gesture, although we can't help wondering if the motivation is in part allowing Sharon to exercise more control over the lower orders. After all, when people are buying tickets with the hope of seeing, say, Iron Maiden, it's hard for Sharon to throw Iron Maiden off the tour if they fall out, and so she's reduced to humiliating herself with a childish stunt or two. After all, nobody wants to have to refund tickets, do they? But if the cost of the tickets has been picked up by Nike or Snickers or whoever... well, that shifts the balance of power.\n\nAnd, in passing, Kelly Osbourne appears to have been the victim of a Freudian slip during the business news on the World Service this morning - ending a report on Windows Vista complaints, the anchor asked if \"geek\" was now an acceptable term. \"Kelly Osbourne likes geeks...\" volunteered the business reporter:\n\n\"Kelly Osbourne? Who's that?\"\n\n\"Ozzy Osbourne's son...\""
