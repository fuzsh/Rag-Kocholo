        "text": "Both P.O.S. and his transplanted hometown pal Astronautalis have been saying/threatening for a couple years now that they would one day release material under the guise of Four Fists, and that day will finally be Oct. 8. The duo's debut 7-inch single will arrive that day via Doomtree Records, and one of the tracks, \"MMMMMHMMMMM,\" premiered today on the Village Voice's site and is posted below.\n\nThe single -- which also features a track called \"Please Go\" – will be sold in special-edition colored vinyl. Pre-orders are now available via the Doomtree site with a \"deluxe bundle\" featuring a T-shirt and pin. It's reportedly just a warm-up to a full-length album.\n\nAs is recounted in the Village Voice feature, the Twin Cities rap vet and the Florida-reared indie maven first met on the Warped Tour in 2004. They started recording together up in P.O.S.' attic studio space during the especially brutal winter of 2011 (remember that one?), around the time when Astronautalis somehow came to the conclusion he should live here. If that doesn't sound Minnesotan enough, their moniker and some of the lyrics are also based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's short stories.\n\nThere's no mention of a Four Fists live gig. However, during his performance in Friday's MN Music-on-a-Stick concert at the State Fair grandstand, P.O.S. did hint he'd be involved in a surprise gig \"sometime in October.\" A day earlier, he also told the masses via his live on-air appearance at 89.3 the Current's fair booth that he has found a matching donor to receive a kidney transplant – news he has been waiting to hear for almost a year now. He also has a smattering of fall tour dates lined up, and then, of course, come the Doomtree Blowout gigs in early December (details still TBA)."
