As a rule, we endorse only in contested races on the Travis County ballot, although we reserve the right to speak on other selected Central Texas races. We offer these endorsements to our readers equally as information and recommendation; our strongest endorsement is that you all take seriously your right and responsibility to vote. President: Barack Obama-Joe Biden While it’s unsurprising that were endorsing Barack Obama for president - he’s the only chance we have of the U.S. turning away from the disastrous domestic and foreign policies of the last eight years - the reasons for doing so have become increasingly urgent in the last weeks of the campaign. The spreading eco- nomic crisis requires a broad approach that does not rule out, on ideological grounds, direct government intervention, and the Bush administration is dither- ing and delaying - and John McCain promises more of the same. We need a broad and deep voter mandate for the end of the occupation of Iraq and a straight- forward and efficient withdrawal - and McCain threatens only more of the same. Whatever one thinks of the limits of the Democratic Party, or even of electoral politics, we need a broad and strong message from voters in support of pro- gressive change, and the only immediate means at hand is a widespread activist vote for Barack Obama. We urge all our readers to spread the word and to get out and vote. U.S. Senate: Rick Noriega After nearly six years as a staunch supporter of President Bush’s failed policies, Republican Sen. John Comyn now has the gall to run ads claiming that he’ll be an agent of change. Houston state Rep. Noriega isn’t exactly a revolutionary, but electing the Democrat would mark a welcome new direction. He wants to end this immoral and illegal war in Iraq, he’s opposed to a border wall, and as a lieutenant colonel in the National Guard, he has firsthand knowledge of both border secu- rity and foreign policy. As a state legislator, he voted to expand the Children’s Health Insurance Program, unlike Cornyn. While we’d like Noriega to be bolder in certain areas, a Sen. Noriega would on balance certainly be better than Comyn and, in the untoward event of a McCain presidency, might help give the Democrats a veto-proof majority. U.S. House, District 10: Larry Joe Doherty What we said about John Comyn above applies equally to Rep. Michael McCaul - he’s little more than a rubber stamp for President Bush’s warmongering, pro-corporate policies. Attorney and former TV personality Doherty is chomping at the bit to return District 10 to the progressive, populist tradition it had under Lyndon Johnson, Homer Thornberry, Jake Pickle, and Lloyd Doggett. First and foremost, he’s sick of the Iraq war and recognizes its immorality. He also supports universal, single- payer health care and effective re-regulation of a freewheeling Wall Street that has spun out of control. Having lawyered in Houston, lived near Brenham, and now residing in Austin, he understands all aspects of this diverse district. It’s time to root out “Congressman Clear Channel” and let Doherty represent people, not money. U.S. House, District 21: James Arthur Strohm We’ll confess - we’re less than enthusiastic about Libertarian Strohm. In general, we think libertarian economic ideas are mostly abstract exercises in free-market fundamentalism, of little use in the current economic crisis. But Lamar Smith has been little more than a cog in the minous Republican machine of the past 7Vi years (longer, if you recall the Newt Gingrich Congress), and we’re embarrassed that the focus of his career has been beating up on immigrants. At least we agree with Libertarians on issues such as the Iraq war and drug legalization, and we’re willing to check Strohm’s name as a protest against a destructive regime. U.S. House, District 25: lioyd Doggett There’s a good reason Rep. Doggett has no formidable opposition (his Republican oppo- nent, Fayette Co. rancher George Morovich, is a flat-tax and anti-immigrant enthusiast, and his Libertarian opponent is pro forma). He’s one of the most progressive and hardest work- ing congressmen on the Hill, and he has served the people of Austin and Central Texas with distinction, courage, and forthrightness for many years. He hardly needs our endorse- ment, but we’re very proud to provide it. Railroad Commissioner: Mark Thompson Thompson faces an uphill battle against Railroad Commission Chair Michael Williams, but we welcome his committed effort to take on an incumbent whose campaign is fueled by the oil and gas industry he’s supposed to regulate. Thompson, a disabilities rights advo- cate, calls for agency reforms and tougher enforcement of laws intended to protect the little guy. Can’t argue with that. Supreme Court, Chief Justice: Jim Jordan Supreme Court, Place 7: Sam Houston Supreme Court, Place 8: Linda Reyna Yanez In recent years, the state’s highest civil court has become a rubber stamp for corpo- rate defendants, for whom it votes unani- mously much of the time, with little regard for the legal rights of ordinary citizens nor even the necessity of balance and fairness. Moreover, the current incumbents are finding it increas- ingly difficult even to manage their dockets, as cases disappear into endless delay and conse- quent denial of justice. It’s time to swing the pendulum back in a progressive direction: Jordan and Yanez have distinguished judicial records, and Houston is an accomplished civil attorney. We urge our readers to support them. Court of Criminal Appeals: Place 3: Susan Strawn Place 4: J.R. Molina Place 9: Cathy Cochran Changeover is perhaps even more necessary at the Court of Criminal Appeals, where Chief Justice Sharon Keller has presided over an increasingly “Hang ’em high!” court, out of step with either progressive criminal justice or sometimes even rational court proce- dure, barely managing its docket let alone delivering impartial deci- sions. This is an outcomes-based, right-wing activist court, deter- mined to rubber-stamp harsh prosecutions with little regard for fairness or justice, let alone mercy. Democrats Strawn and Molina would bring both experience and fairness to the CCA and deserve voters’ support. No Democrat is running in Place 9, and Libertarian William Bryan Strange III appears to have filed purely out of partisan ideological conviction. GOP incumbent Coch- ran has shown fairness and a judicial tempera- ment - she was livid at Keller’s notorious 5pm closing on a death penalty appeal - and she has earned another term. Texas House, District 46: Dawnna Dukes We’ve had some differences with Dukes - notably over her support for House Speaker Tom Craddick - but she’s better than the Libertarian running against her. Texas House, District 47: Yalinda Bolton By concentrating her agenda on the two hallmark issues for most Texans - education and health care - Bolton is keeping to the heart of a state rep’s responsibilities. While a baseless smear campaign has tried to target her as soft on sexual offenders, Bolton’s national reputation and practical experience as an expert on sexual and domestic abuse was invalu- able when she stepped with little fanfare into the quagmire of the Texas Youth Commis- sion scandal to help legislate essential abuse counseling ser- vices. It is hard to see GOP chal- lenger Donna Keel’s candidacy as more than vendetta politics, with an agenda that does not relate to the real con- cerns of the district. Moreover, putting the sister-in-law of Speaker Tom Craddick’ s parlia- mentarian (and former HD 47 incumbent) Terry Keel in the House would be a re-enforce- ment of Craddick’ s dictatorial style. We strongly endorse Bolton for a second term. NOV. 4 GENERAL ELECTION (EARLY VOTING OCT. 20-31) You may vote at any early-voting location, as long as it’s in the county in which you are registered.

While other legislation, such as extra protec- tion for hospital whistle-blowers, died in committee, Howard’s commitment to these pivotal issues is undeniable. So is her ability to forge strong working relationships with House Republicans without excessive con- cessions. Republican Pam Waggoner is run- ning on an education platform, but her tax proposals would further hamstring school funding, and making illegal immigration her No. 2 issue is straight from the GOP play- book and a diversion from real state prob- lems. Libertarian Ben Easton’s blanket oppo- sition to public education outweighs any potential good in his platform. We strongly endorse Donna Howard. Texas House, District 49: Elliott Naishtat Naishtat is unopposed, but we wanted to give him a shout-out anyway for years of dedicated service to Austin and Texas. Keep up the good work! Texas House, District 50: Mark Strama During the revolt against Speaker Craddick last session, Strama could have shrunk into the background like some other members of his caucus pegged as Craddick Ds. Instead, he delivered a clear legal argument that dis- mantled Craddick’ s claims that he who wields the gavel wields absolute authority. His package of proposals to create an inde- pendent redistricting committee, to expand campaign finance reform, and to improve bal- lot access could make him a major factor in political battles before the 2010 redistricting. In addition, his authoring of effective green legislation and creating funding that bridges the gap for veterans going to college are solid policy. Republican Jerry Mikus’ proposal to shift all state revenue to sales taxes defines “regressive tax,” and Libertarian Jerry Chand- ler has done little to promote his agenda. Texas House, District 51: Eddie Rodriguez Rodriguez has represented his district and Austin well, with particular attention to Eastside residential concerns and those of everyday working people. He has also been an independent mind on the House Boor and a calm temperament who understands how progressive action gets done, a piece at a time. Libertarian Arthur DiBianca is an earnest fellow who’s doing what he can to build his party, but Rodriguez has fully earned the voters’ support. Texas House, District 52: Diana Maldonado Attempts by the Williamson County GOP to paint Round Rock Independent School District trustee Maldonado as a single-issue education candidate seem galling when com- pared to Republican Bryan Daniel’s close connection to the agriculture political action committees.

Maldonado, who arguably has far better links to the Central Texas business community than Daniel, will also bring an often-missed voice for Hispanic- owned and female-owned busi- nesses and coalitions, and her hands-on understanding of the legislative and budget traumas facing school districts can be an essential addition to the next session. 3rd Court of Appeals, Chief Justice: Woodie Jones The incumbent is Justice Kenneth Law, who won his seat on a fluke with little experi- ence and has grown less worthy in the job. Recently he and his former business lobbyist colleague Alan Waldrop ruled that “checks” are not necessarily “cash,” in a transparent attempt to exempt disgraced former Rep. Tom DeLay from prosecution for campaign finance violations. Shortly thereafter, Texans for Public Justice filed civil and criminal com- plaints against Law for apparent campaign finance violations. By contrast, former 3rd Court Justice Jones has both an exemplary reputation and still more judicial experience than Law, and he will help restore the reputa- tion of a court that has disgraced itself with right-wing partisanship. District Judge, 427th Judicial District: Jim Coronado Last spring, for the Democratic primary, we described Coronado as “an experienced attor- ney, court officer, and legal activist who has been centrally involved in social-justice issues in and out of court for many years . . . [who] has the length of service and the breadth of legal and community experience” to earn our endorsement. Melissa Goodwin, appointed by Gov. Rick Perry for the newly created court to provide incumbency in this campaign, has served only a few months, with prior experience primarily as a justice of the peace. We believe Coronado has the broadest range of experience and the temperament to best serve in this seat. Travis Co. Sheriff: Greg Hamilton Although incumbent Hamilton has recently been criticized for allowing too-generous jail access to federal immigration authorities, he has otherwise held hands off on immigration enforcement, saying it would detract from fighting crime, and he has in general contin- ued and expanded the better traditions of local law enforcement in recent years. Specifically, his office quickly adopted the “cite-and- release” option for minor offenses made avail- able under state law while the Austin Police Department was still dragging its feet - and he no doubt had an influence on the larger department to get with the program. Republican challenger Raymond Frank is 83, carries a few old skeletons from his Seventies-era tenure, and would undoubtedly be entertaining; when he ran in 1996, he told the Statesman , “I real- ize I’m 70, but so is B.B. King, and so was Picasso when he did some of his best work. ” A dozen years later, Frank is bucking GOP ortho- doxy by promising to renounce Tasers and to work for marijuana decriminalization, but his candidacy is largely a diversion, as is the token filing of Libertarian David McDaniel. Travis Co. Tax Assessor-Collector: Nelda Wells Spears Some good ideas have been raised as to how the Tax Assessor’s Office could be improved - but those suggestions came back in the Democratic primary from challenger Glen Maxey, not from her current Republican oppo- nent. Even Maxey’s suggestions couldn’t con- vince Dems to end the 17-year tenure of Spears, who has rightly earned praise as an effective, competent public servant in her roles of tax collector and voter registrar. Libertarian- oriented Republican Don Zimmerman’s candi- dacy borders on the cartoonish and offers no evidence he could defeat her in any case. Travis Co. Commissioner, Precinct 1: Ron Davis Davis has been a reliable progressive vote on the Commissioners Court and an effective advocate for his northeast district. He well deserves another term.

Commissioner, Precinct 3: Karen Huber We’ll give incumbent Republican Gerald Daugherty the same credit we gave him back in 2002: We appreciate the fact that he says what he believes, not just what he thinks people want to hear. Unfortunately, what he believes is sharply at odds with our vision for the western portion of Travis County that he serves. His longstanding prioritization of road- building ahead of mass transit and opposition to increased county powers over development have not served this county well. Within county lines, alas, there isn’t much left of the Hill Country to save, but we believe Huber’s business background mixed with her strong conservationist bent will help protect what remains of a formerly (and in some places, still) beautiful part of the county. Travis Co. Constable, Precinct 2: Bob Vann This is not the first time we’ve endorsed Vann, a Republican, for this seat, but he has served in this office since 1996, and it would be nice to see a viable Democrat making a run for this seat. The Democratic candidate in this ested in self-advancement than serving the people. We welcome the opportunity to praise and endorse Elfant.

Proposition 1 (which originated from a council proposal) is designed to insulate the city auditor - who investigates wasteful spend- ing and fraud and conducts more general administrative reviews - from political pres- sure by making the position a fixed, five-year term and requiring a council supermajority (at least six of seven, currently) to remove the auditor. The point is to insulate the auditor from outside pressure should uncomfortable questions emerge from the auditor’s office. As the auditor’s office has occasionally been sub- ject to political or managerial arm-twisting in the past, Proposition 1 is a commonsense way to better government at little cost. race is Adan Ballesteros, but we couldn’t bring ourselves to endorse him (or for that matter his opponent, Paul Labuda) in the Democratic primary, and we find no reason to endorse him now.

We’re doing so because punishing the Domain - the North Austin mixed-use devel- opment that Proposition 2 targets - is not worthy of a charter amendment of unknown general consequences. Equally important, the potential damage to the city’s reputation and the murky amendment language itself will likely generate negative consequences. This amendment is a risk we don’t need to take. Certainly we sympathize with the impulse to protect local businesses by forbidding the kind of subsidies provided to the Domain and reining in city largesse to commercial developers and national chain stores. In hindsight, the 2003 deal the city of Austin made with the Domain’s original developer, Endeavor, gave away too much (up to $25 million in subsidies, in 2003 dollars) while asking for too little in return. But the city did get the benefits that council contractually demanded in exchange: a redesign as a mixed-use, New Urbanist project planned for mass transit, with some affordable housing and a complement of local businesses. Voters need to clearly understand that this amendment will not affect only the Domain. With some exemptions, it would eliminate incentives - including, for example, afford- able housing buy-down grants - for any proj- ect that includes a retail component. Used well, incentives of various kinds have been a valuable tool for positively shaping developer behavior and mixed-use projects. Yet the full amendment (not visible on the ballot) would broadly “restrict the use or expenditure of tax revenues or other resources of the city to pro- vide subsidies, financial benefits or advan- tages for development of real property that includes one or more Retail Uses” (emphasis added) - whatever the extent or kind of those uses and regardless of the community goals the subsidy might achieve. In particular, the amendment would affect the Mueller neighborhood, another project subsidized in part by its own sales taxes. The inability to make grants from the city’s Afford- able Housing Fund could also negatively affect the Green Water Treatment Plant rede- velopment, as well as mixed-use projects too small for tax-increment financing (exempted from the amendment) yet crucial to the rede- velopment of inner-city neighborhoods. The current council has already enacted a new policy that forbids future Domain-style subsidies. Unlike a charter amendment, that policy can be changed at will without waiting on another charter election. While we under- stand and respect the frustration of propo- nents who want to end large-scale retail subsi- dies and who don’t trust City Hall to hold the line of its own accord, most of us believe this charter amendment is not the right solution. AISD, Tax Ratification Election: YES Even in the face of dire economic times and after the Austin Independent School District bond election in May, the real no-brainer on this ballot is the 3.9-cent property-tax raise for education funding. Tying the teachers’ pay raise to the tax increase may seem like extor- tion, and Education Austin made a sensible argument that the district should have asked for the maximum 13 cents allowed by the state, saving it from having to come back, cap in hand, next time it has any additional expenditure. (Despite rises in property value, additional collections do not benefit AISD but are “recaptured” by the state for other dis- tricts.) The reality is, until someone in the Tegislature has the spine to separate school funding from the political kick ball of prop- erty tax, the staff and students of AISD should not be penalized for a flawed funding system. We strongly endorse the tax increase and implore legislators to make school finance again a prime issue in the next session. ■ To read the city ordinance mandating the Proposition 1 and 2 charter amend- ments, including the ballot language and the full amendment proposals, see the endorsements online at austinchronicle.com.

A dog jumps out to run across afield.] September and October have long been “the Rocking Horse Winner” months here at the Chronicle, breeding the “Best of Austin” out of an already sapped staff, with nothing left to give, still giving. It is a quiet hum but always there. It is a hum of hunger demanding to be fed by a constant tabulation going on, a hum insisting it be fed by content - content to be decided on, thought about, researched, written, proofread, corrected, fact-checked, designed, printed. It is a hum of worrying - never shouting, always urgently whispering to all that they go quicker, do more, finish entries, vet sections - a hum of concern that time is fleeting. Without changing sound levels, it gets louder and louder. No longer just in the walls, it enters into the head and the blood. There are no explosions, no detonation, usually little outrageous conduct, but the hum is 24 hours a day, seven days a week. All the time in Austin, there is the unre- lenting drizzle of lament - of voices recall- ing, dismissing, celebrating, singing, and accusing - of voices torn with pain. Neither geological nor structurally permanent, the intellectual, social, and political swift-moving violent white-water rapids of conversation, discourse, and disagreement rip through the city, defining it daily. Guiding it without directing. Dominating dangerous mirages of illusion, weather and emotion, metaphoric and real, poetic and bland. City veterans love the thrill; novices often are swamped and nearly drowned. Any citizen here for not much longer than 24 hours soon spices his or her conversation with the true vernacular incongruities and accents of the Hill Country. They slip into pot, beer, barbecue, Mexican food, harder drinks, and beginning too many sentences with the most classic River-City-polite phraseology, “You should have been here when ...” They talk of the loss of the magic city of Oz past. They note how much better the city used to be when the Armadillo was open or KUT- FM was when the population was so much smaller and John Aielli was on for stretches of 24 or 48 hours or more. They bemoan the present’s lack of quality, waxing nostalgic for how good . . . Austin City Limits TV show, cable access, Joe Ely’s band, Giiero’s tacos, Esther’s Follies, Ruby’s barbecue, Threadgill’s chicken- fried steak, and Curra’s whole menu . . . used to be, about how easy it was to park, that the summers were never so hot, and sometimes in the winter it even snowed. They recall the good old days when Guy Juke’s and Micael Priest’s posters were every- where, the Butthole Surfers were dangerous, all the people were decent, pot was inexpen- sive, traffic was always light, and more often than not the cost of living was so cheap that landlords would be paying rent to the ten- ants. They reminisce how great KLBJ-FM was when Dale Dudley and Bob Fonseca were on in the morning or the KGSR-FM glory days with Jody Denberg and Bryan Beck, when Antone’s and the Continental Club were cool, Ann Richards was governor, Raul’s was open, South by Southwest was hip, and the Chronicle relevant and interesting. When Clifford Antone, Janis Joplin, Danny Young, Townes Van Zandt, and Doug Sahm were all alive, and Stevie Ray Vaughan, years away from becoming a statue, played the Rome Inn most weekends. One of Mad Magazine's most legendary fea- tures was published some number of decades back, a riff on advertising that continually insists that products are currently at their very best! Consumers are assured that now these products are newer, stronger, cheaper, healthier, more powerful, better-tasting, and better for you. Imagining some consistency in advertising, the magazine offered parody prior to ads of products - declaring that the taste was off, the cleaners ineffective, ingredients weak, that they weren’t healthy, and indeed couldn’t do much at all. In Austin, it is rare to hear a positive comment about anything local except if it is in the past tense. One of my recent columns was about Austin as it is now. It was not advocating change but arguing that change had happened. Some were so obsessed by what has been lost that they were missing the wonders still here. Some chastised me for acquiescing so eas- ily and not resisting. Resist we had; this was not advocacy but acceptance. The Chronicle has fought and continues to fight one of the longest rear-guard actions in history. The column was simply describing where this city is now, finding it still outstanding though different. The choice is not to change back - that is not an option. The choice is to embrace it or not. The “Best of Austin” issue brings home the changes and the resulting losses as well as the ongoing and newly added strengths.

A long line of Model Ts drives off into the distance.] The “Best of Austin” issues feature read- ers’ and critics’ opinions. Each one is part of the greater story of Austin. Run together over the years, the “Best of Austin” issues offer a vast four-dimensional picture of Austin, of so many of the places, people, and businesses that define the city. Hundreds of items are already here, addi- tions and suggestions are always welcome. In Austin the topic of Whole Foods Market can attract such electricity, it makes lightning rods look inhospitable. Opinions abound based on everything from ideology to cuisine, from attraction to quality, to an obsession with economic class concerns. Unfortunately, once you begin to eat organ- ic fruits and vegetables and free-range chicken rather than skin-wrapped flesh and water, you can easily become addicted. It is not ideology or politics but taste. Discussions often narrow focus. One of the realities we are privileged to live with is how Whole Foods has changed the supermarket landscape all across the country. In many, many communities where good food was once nearly impossible to find, now all kinds are readily available. [President Bush and Vice President Cheney - the Ritz Brothers The Bush daughters - Thelma Todd & Zazu Pitts ] CONTINUED ON P.14 Some would rather tear down than build, insult rather than praise.

The idea now is innuendo. Obama is chas- tised because of his past “relationships.” This is not guilt by association, we are assured. No, the problem is the way he shared information about them. If he had talked about them differently, then that would have been the problem. The idea is to attack and discredit and not to present an idea or anything that looks or comes across as one. The idea is the bucket of pigs’ blood at the end of Carrie to be anonymously dumped on Obama again and again. Baptizing him, drown- ing the Democrats. I knew some Weather Underground folks in Boston and in Vermont. During the summer of 1968 in Peekskill, N.Y., Jeff Jones and I got into an intense, ugly argument. I never much liked the Students for a Democratic Society in general; the Weather Underground were worse. They quite unattrac- tively combined a sense of privilege (because of their race and class) with an arrogant self- righteousness. They offered a very simplistic political, social, and ideological agenda. Still, what drove them was not terrorists’ hatred of the United States but rather the deep disillusionment and desperation of those who loved this country but were hor- rified by what was happening in Vietnam and Southeast Asia. The idea was not to destroy the U.S. but to right its course. Twenty years or more after their brief hey- day, when Obama met them (i.e., William Ayers), they were not on the run but were integrated legal members of the society. The Association of Community Organi- zations for Reform Now hires folks to go out to register people to vote. They pay those that sign them up a rate per person signed. Not surprisingly, some of these folks got quite creative at generating voters. This is not a top-down conspiracy. It is not really massive voter fraud until the registered noncitizens show up to try to vote. Don’t expect much of that, because for the most part they won’t show up at the polls. This is why the GOP is pumping it up now to capture the excitement before it implodes on itself. I’m not sure how it works exactly, but it doesn’t seem likely that an independent orga- nization that registers voters can have much discretion over what voter registration forms it turns in and which ones it doesn’t. Think about it. Now if only the blowhard, dishonestly disingenuous, hard-right pundits who now insist this blatant corrupting of the electoral system hurts them in their constitutionally pristine hearts had shown any but the most base partisan commitments to the integrity of the electoral system in Florida and Ohio, think how different things might have been. President Bush sings a medley of songs about tax-cutting, insisting that he is cutting taxes for all Americans because it will stimulate the economy. The hard-right pundit gang trip over themselves explaining how American families will each save an average of $1,000 in taxes. Some were just up to their usual tricks, kicking back into the sweet old dishonesty that brays about its own integrity while turn- ing tricks on street corners. Casually con- demning as worthless all who disagree with them, their staccato cadence lulls listeners into not objecting to their absurd claims that members of a racially mixed, nationally orga- nized political party should be branded as racist because they simply bring up the idea of race in politics. There is nothing quite as amusing as two or three relatively clueless cable news Anglo talking heads weighing in on racism, when they really have precious little idea as to what they are talking about, with some of them undoubtedly thinking the topic of race is related to the Triple Crown. Later, as the lies go out into the night on little cat’s feet, Sarah Palin shoots them dead. COMING NEXT WEEK, TO A THEATRE NEAR YOU: Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn.

You are severely damag- ing the many millions of American citizens who actually do live responsible and accountable lives. Pay off those two credit cards so that the rest of us who have managed our debt and stayed out of debt will not have to. Remarkably, we do know who to blame; the predictable results of this credit binge have been publicly discussed for our entire adult lives, and we knew that the accounting would come before we retired. I guess you weren’t paying attention, so sell your most prideful possession - your damn stupid car - and pay down your debt. Do the responsible thing, and pass the word on to any others that you know that bought more house than they can afford and lived lifestyles they couldn’t afford. I know too many people who for all the right reasons were not enjoying this wild roller coaster of rising home appreciations and the dislocations that it cost them and their families in this city. Please quit deceiving yourself with your semi- intellectual philosophical outlook. Michael Cosper PLAY FAIR, ‘CHRONICLE’ Dear Editor, I enjoyed the listings of restaurants, and quite a few of my suggestions made your follow-up article, but your “our game, our rules” thing is just wrong [“Landmark Eateries,” Food, Sept. 12]! You’ve included establishments in Driftwood, Bee Cave, and Lakeway/Lake Travis, but you don’t consider equally close establishments because of your “rules.” You should do a follow-up article with the most logical, commonsense rules - consider any place in any area that gets copies of The Austin Chronicle. That includes San Marcos, for example. THIS MSSIIH WSILI So SARAH PALIN HAS BEEN MOCK- ING OBAMA'S COMMENT ABOUT U.S. TROOPS IN AFGHANISTAN 'AIR-RAID- ING VILLAGES AND KILLING CIVIL- IANS'...

People are hanging on to their money, with good reason. They aren’t spending it, which means businesses aren’t getting it - national chain businesses, Internet businesses, and, more importantly, local businesses. Personally, I care a lot more that places like Kerbey Lane, Vulcan Video, and BookPeople stay in business than I do that places like Netflix and Amazon make their profits. This is the time for us to buy local - to spend our dollars here in Austin, with Austin busi- nesses, and not on the Internet. If we don’t, these priceless local businesses may not be there when this crisis passes. We have to buy local - now - if we want a “local” to be there to buy from later. Tom Davis GUNS AREN’T FUNNY Dear Editor, Re: The Oct. 3 Austin Chronicle cover: I can pretty much imagine that people who would laugh at a picture of this would also claim to believe in God, as I do, too. However, most “Christians” don’t bother, for some reason, to express any respect for all of God’s creatures. If you think this pic is funny, then there is something wrong with you; seriously. Sick people are out there assuming that animal cruelty is OK, and y’all that laugh about it contribute to non-Christian values. Guns aren’t funny; they are designs of human stupidity, not intelligence. Thanks Timothy Verret for being a voice of reason [“Postmarks,” Oct. 10]. Randy Oakes FINANCIAL FUDGERY Dear Austin Chronicle, On the Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization agenda Monday, Oct. 13, in item No. 7 is an agreement between CAMPO and the Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority to skip doing a formal market valuation on tolled 290 East and instead come to some sort of agreed-upon valuation for this road. The reason the substitute valuation is being proposed is that the preliminary mar- ket valuation on this roadway came in showing negative financial numbers, putting this project in the red. This sort of financial fudgery is just exactly how our nation got into the economic mess we are in right now. It may seem somehow like a good idea to override the negative financial data from the initial valuation in order to get the road built, but it is not. Subprime lenders ignored negative financial valuations to get people into homes they could not afford, and the snowball effect has nearly brought our country to its knees. CAMPO should not override the red flags the initial market valuation is raising. The CTRMA wants to overlook the financials on this road and build it. The CTRMA wants to use shaky toll revenue from 183-A to secure toll bonds for 290 East because bond insurers like AIG are no longer able to insure these risky projects. And the CTRMA wants to use scarce taxpayer resources to build a toll road in an economically challenged part of town in a time of shrinking discre- tionary incomes from which they expect tolls to be paid. The CTRMA is getting further and further out on a limb, and as we have recently seen in the U.S. and world economies, limbs break. The CTRMA should perform a true market valuation using up-to- date figures to reflect current market and economic conditions to determine if it is in the best interest of the community to build this tolled design. I’m not sure who is following transportation for the Chronicle right now, but please give this your attention. Thank you! Sincerely Beki Fla I pin [Editor’s note: At its Oct. 13 meeting , CAMPO postponed action on this proposal and related matters until next month.] METRO Fare Card Full Fare Service Dillos (two hour pass) Local Adults 50$ 75$ $1.50 IIBIMIM | • Students (l8 & under with student ID) • Active Duty & Reserve Military (with ID) • Seniors & Disability Fare Card Holders • UT Students | • Law Enforcement, Fire & Military (in uniform) • MetroAccess Certified (formerly STS) I • Children under six Free w/Capital Metro issued ID Free w/ID card Dillos MetroBus (Local) Express 31-Day Adult Pass $5-00 $18.00 $36.00 31-Day Reduced Fare Pass N/A $9.00 $18.00 Day Pass N/A $1.50 $3.00 7-Day Pass N/A $7-00 N/A Qi-Ride $1.00 (l Zone) $1.50 (2 Zones) Dillos (two hour pass) Local Express I MetroRail 50$ (l Zone) 75$ (2 Zones) Discount Tickets and Passes Stored Value Card MetroAccess lO-Ride Ticket Book RideShare Monthly Fare (per person) Description Good for $15 worth of rides lO MetroAccess tickets, each good for one ride for enrolled passengers In Service Area $45.00 (formerly STS) $22.50 N/A N/A N/A $ 12.00 $ 7.00 A fare to remember.

Naked City > DESIGNING THE NEW CENTRAL LIBRARY If you’re interested in the design of the new central library, you’ll soon have the chance to see presenta- tions by the three finalist teams vying for the job of architect when they present to City Council on Thursday, Oct. 23, at 2pm. (Names of the finalists will be announced Oct. 17.) Following at about 6pm, the Library Commission and Austin Public Library Foundation will host a meet-and-greet social with the design teams in the City Hall atri- um; comment forms and laptops for online com- ments will be provided. Council expects to make a final selection in two weeks. The library will include numerous community spaces of special interest. In selecting finalists, city staff gave extra weight to the architects’ skill with community involvement and communication - even amending the selection cri- teria to more heavily weigh the teams’ experience with Austin issues. Next March and April, a series of community forums will provide opportunities for design input. Active design work will begin May 2009; construction is expected to start in late 2011, with a grand opening in 2014.

Emrobrai Homes had initially planned to build a new home on spec, but with home sales down 20% over last year, the homebuilder decided to first nail down a buyer before turning dirt. Sale price: $799,000. FUELING THE FUTURE The fabulous cars of the future will be on display this weekend at the Austin Energy AltCar Expo & Conference, a free event this Friday and Saturday, 10am-5pm, at the Palmer Events Center. Attractions include a hands-on ride-and-drive area and the region’s larg- est presentation of alternative-fuel vehicles and innovative transportation options. Friday’s events feature technology and policy discussions and in-depth talks about topics such as climate change and the auto industry, battery technology, and the vehicle-to-grid (aka, V2G) technology that will enable plug-in hybrid vehicles and potentially decrease gasoline demand by an estimated 71%. On Saturday, guests can hear a no-holds-barred CONTINUED ON P.22 Unpropped Prop. 2 is about much more than a vote against the Domain BY MICHAEL KING It’s not a “no-brainer.” That slogan, adopted by the Proposition 2-support- ing Stop Domain Subsidies campaign, is both mislead- ing on its face and an insult to Austin voters. However you choose to vote on Prop. 2, please take the time to consider both the intended and unintended but likely consequences of an attempt to ban any and all “finan- cial incentives [for any development] that includes one or more retail uses.” If you’ve read this week’s editorial board endorsements, you’re aware that, we’ve come down (although not unan- imously) against Prop. 2 as an inappropri- ate attempt to reject one particular city agreement by amending the charter and also as what one of us called “using a sledgehammer where a scalpel would be appropriate.” We’re not happy to be on the opposite side of an argument embraced by many activists we respect, as well as by numerous local businesses and political groups. But after reviewing the amendment in full (not possi- ble on the ballot itself) and talking with people on both sides, most of us concluded that Prop. 2 is a well- intentioned but bad amendment that will likely back- fire in its principal goal (ending subsidies to the Domain) and, even more likely, cause municipal head- aches and unnecessary expense over other projects, while eliminating a useful city tool that can and has worked well when used judiciously. austi I’m tempted to write “a pox on both their houses,” since either way the vote goes, bad results are pos- sible. A yes vote will invite lawsuits, require the city to violate a legal contract, damage the city’s credibil- ity, and undermine good projects; a no vote will be interpreted in some quarters as authorizing retail subsidies without conditions. But as the public con- sensus remains highly skeptical and the current council is on record as opposing such subsidies, I’m less worried about the latter outcome. We elect public officials to make decisions, and sometimes they make poor ones; but this proposition campaign is yet another Austin demonstration of the folly of government by petition. In brief, voters are being asked to amend the City Charter - the fundamental structural document of city government - to punish a single developer and a previous City Council and then to wait two years (until the next available charter election) while the unintended effects are sorted out (some likely by courts) and other quite worthy and progressive city projects are derailed or delayed. That doesn’t strike me as a good deal nor a rational way to make city policy Supporters insist that the proposition targets only the Domain. If it’s that simple, then why rewrite the City Charter for a policy obstreperously aimed at a single property and project?

Winograd is a national figure in no-kill sheltering and runs a consulting business that implements his “No Kill Solution” in individu- al animal shelters. He has made a name for himself for marshaling shelter “regime” changes for a fee, at times involving the toppling of shelter officials and mass firings. When last in town, Winograd con- demned Karen Medicus of Austin’s Mission: Orange in a report slam- ming the relocation of Town Lake Animal Center; he referred to her emphasis on the collaboration model as “ignorant.” (See “Does Austin Need Fixing?

KVUE-TV, the local ABC affiliate, is replacing Christine Haas, the blond anchor babe from Minnesota, with Terri Gruca, a blond anchor babe from Minnesota. Gruca is cur- rently at WCCO-TV in Minneapolis, where she’s the consumer reporter, in addition to her news-reading chores. Before Minnesota, she clawed her way up through the minor leagues of TV news, with stops in Spartanburg, S.C.; Knoxville, Tenn.; and Raleigh, N.C. Meanwhile, NBC affiliate KXAN has hired a familiar face, Leslie Rhode, formerly Leslie Cook, to replace the recently departed Michelle Valles. Rhode spent six years at KXAN before jetting off in 2003 to Washington, D.C., where her husband took a job with the Bush administration. Rhode will team with Robert Hadlock, beginning Oct. 27, just in time for the November sweeps; Gruca won’t start at KVUE until Dec. 8. - Kevin Brass AO * “ MPH „ > REPLACING THE GAS TAX If everyone shifts from gas-guzzling vehi- cles to more efficient cars, tax revenues that fund roadway mainte- nance and construction could take a huge hit - that’s why Austin is part of a new federally fund- ed road-user study about shifting from the gas tax to a per-mile charge. The project, which involves installing a computer into private vehi- cles, proposes to find out if the metering equipment is “reliable, secure, flexible, user-friendly and cost-effective [and] to find out why vehicle opera- tors accept or reject the system.” The city is one of six field-test sites selected for this University of Iowa research study (along with San Diego, Baltimore, Boise, Eastern Iowa, and the North Carolina Research Triangle). Volunteers willing to take part for eight months in this two-year pilot proj- ect can apply online at www.roaduserstudy.org. - Richard Whittaker $$SSS$$f?

The Hustle would often find clubs, tees, and - most enticingly - books of golfing jokes lying around Grandpa’s. One joke especially stuck. As rediscov- ered online: Robert goes golfing every Saturday. One Saturday he comes home three hours late. His wife asks him , “ What took you so long?\" The guy says, “ That was the worst game of golf I’ve ever had. We got up to the first tee , and Charlie hit a hole in one and immediately dropped dead of a heart attack.\" The guy’s wife says, “ That’s terrible!\" The guy says, “I know. Then , for the rest of the round , it was hit the ball , drag Charlie , hit the ball , drag Charlie , hit the ball , drag Charlie ...\" Right now, the city’s a little bit like Robert, caddying all manner of baggage for the University of Texas, in the wake of UT’s decision to redevelop its West Austin Brackenridge Tract - a process in which UT’s been about as (characteristically) helpful to Austinites as a corpse. That may be changing - at least on one side. On Tuesday, Council Members Lee Leffingwell, Mike Martinez, and Laura Morrison held a press conference at the Lions Municipal Golf Course - cradled in the Brack Tract - announcing their intention to hold on to the greens. That item surfaces at today’s council meeting; Leffingwell says council’s directing the city manager “to evaluate the possibility of land swaps,” in tandem with “a voter-approved bond per- haps.” Fore! LOCAL SLOWDOWN? But will putters still hit the links with the economic uncertainty gripping the country? Maybe we’ll know more after a presentation, slated for council at 2pm today, detail- ing the potent impact of the national downturn on local government. Specific topics should include the effects on sales-tax and property-tax revenue; city staffing levels; bond programs, plus other capital improvement projects; the city’s bond ratings and debt service; plus pension costs and more. “It sounds like a lot to put together,” says Leffingwell, “but staff has been looking at this themselves, as they should be.” Another topic I hope will be addressed is the effect on potential add-backs to city services; having just passed a budget cutting library hours and parks maintenance, is hope for additional funding lost? “Add-backs, I think, are gonna be made more difficult,” says Leffingwell. “It’s gonna be more problematic whether you can add.” He says it largely depends on the city’s future revenue streams; while property tax “is pretty much set for this budget cycle,” new sales-tax numbers arrive monthly. “For example, we had programmed this underlying assumption on sales-tax reve- nue, that we would see an average of 3 percent growth in sales tax for the year,” he says, that 3% having already shrunk from earlier, more optimistic num- bers. “And I think if there’s a severe economic downturn, that number could be affected sub- stantially, it could even go negative like it did in 2002, 2003.” Also, while the city should be “pretty much fully reimbursed by [the Federal Emergency Management Agency]” for its hurri- cane expenses, Leffingwell says, “Sometimes you have to wait a little while to get it,” and it can be “a matter of months, not a matter of days.” For Leffingwell, the intent this week ain’t to spook the public. “Hopefully there will be an element of reassur- ance involved in this. Because I think for years the city’s had pretty sound fiscal policies and good-sized reserve funds to deal with crises like this, as long as they’re not super-long-term.” PERSONAL BEST It’s that time of year: time for the Hustle’s own “Best of Austin” accolades for all things City Council related. Best Council Accommodators: Laura Morrison and Randi Shade, who appeared at Sunday night’s Better Austin Today fundraiser at Scholz Garten. The Hustle was in the house recording interviews for the new episode of HUST-FM, our new political audiocast exclusively available at austinchronicle.com. We spoke with Morrison and a couple of other characters who would love to join her on the dais come May - all-but-announced mayoral contenders Bill Spelman and Jackie Goodman.
