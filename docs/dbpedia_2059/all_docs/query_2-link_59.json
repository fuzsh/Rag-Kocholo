Get ready for some great lyrical rap that’s done a bit differently than most. These guys have got some unique stuff for you.\n\nAstronautilus is a rapper from Jacksonville, Florida who is currently based in Minneapolis. He has been making music since at least 2003 when he self-released his first album. Since then he has released four more albums. His style is very unique. The production in his songs is very different than what you hear from most mainstream hip hop as it has an almost indie rock type sound. His flow is great and he raps about a variety of different subjects. He has describes himself as a historical fiction rapper because he likes to use that theme in many of his songs. Joining him will be a fellow rapper from Florida, Bleubird. He has been active for even longer than Astro and has a discography to match. He is known for his fast flows and comedy he throws into his bars. Take a listen below.\n\nThese guys aren’t very big and that’s a shame. Astronautalis is doing some pretty innovative things in the rap game right now and his hard work has payed off. He’s got a great vibe and if you’re a hip hop fan looking for something new, this could be for you. Check it out in October."
