ACTION: Final rule. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SUMMARY: FRA is issuing comprehensive Federal safety standards for railroad passenger equipment. The purpose of these safety standards is to prevent collisions, derailments, and other occurrences involving railroad passenger equipment that cause injury or death to railroad employees, railroad passengers, or the general public; and to mitigate the consequences of any such occurrences, to the extent they cannot be prevented. The final rule promotes passenger train safety through requirements for railroad passenger equipment design and performance; fire safety; emergency systems; the inspection, testing, and maintenance of passenger equipment; and other provisions for the safe operation of railroad passenger equipment. The final rule addresses passenger train safety in an environment where technology is advancing and equipment is being designed for operation at higher speeds. The final rule amends existing regulations concerning special notice for repairs, safety glazing, locomotive safety, safety appliances, and railroad power brakes as applied to passenger equipment. The final rule does not apply to tourist and historic railroad operations. However, after consulting with the excursion railroad associations to determine appropriate applicability in light of financial, operational, or other factors unique to such operations, FRA may prescribe requirements for these operations that are similar to or different from those affecting other types of passenger operations. DATES: This regulation is effective July 12, 1999. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the rule is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of July 12, 1999. ADDRESSES: Any petition for reconsideration should reference FRA Docket No. PCSS-1, Notice No. 5, and be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel, FRA, 1120 Vermont Avenue, Mail Stop 10, Washington, D.C. 20590.

List of Subjects I. Introduction Passenger railroads offer the traveling public one of the safest forms of transportation available. In the eight-year period 1990-1997, there were 0.89 passenger fatalities for every billion miles of passenger transportation by rail. Nevertheless, collisions, derailments, and other such occurrences continue to occur, often as a result of factors beyond the control of the passenger railroad. Further, the rail passenger environment is rapidly changing. Worldwide, passenger equipment operating speeds are increasing. Passenger trainsets designed to European safety standards have been proposed for operation in the United States-and a few are in operation. Overall, these trainsets do not meet the structural standards that are common for passenger equipment operating in the United States. FRA believes that adherence to such common standards by the nation's passenger railroads has in large measure contributed to the high level of safety at which rail passenger service is currently provided in the United States. However, these standards generally do not have the force of law. Effective Federal safety standards for freight equipment have long been in place, but equivalent Federal safety standards for passenger equipment have not existed. Further, the Association of American Railroads (AAR) currently sets industry standards for the design and maintenance of freight equipment that add materially to the safe operation of such equipment. However, over the years, the AAR has discontinued the development and maintenance of industry standards for railroad passenger equipment. FRA must necessarily be vigilant in ensuring that passenger trains continue to be designed, built, and operated with a high level of safety. In general, the railroad operating environment in the United States requires passenger equipment to operate commingled with very heavy and long freight trains, often over track with frequent grade crossings used by heavy highway equipment. European passenger operations, on the other hand, are intermingled with freight equipment of lesser weight than in North America. In many cases, highway-rail grade crossings also pose lesser hazards to passenger trains in Europe due to lower highway vehicle weight. FRA is concerned with the level [[Page 25541]] of safety provided by passenger equipment designed to European and other international standards when such equipment is operated in the United States. A clear set of Federal safety standards for railroad passenger equipment is needed that is tailored to the nation's operating environment in order to provide for the safety of rail operations in the United States and to facilitate sound planning for these operations. In furtherance of this safety objective, FRA is pleased by the American Public Transit Association's (APTA) initiative to continue the development and maintenance of voluntary industry standards for the safety of railroad passenger equipment. These standards will complement FRA's safety standards and, thus, will work together to provide an even higher level of safety for rail passengers, rail employees, and the public as a whole. II. Statutory Background In September, 1994, the Secretary of Transportation convened a meeting of representatives from all sectors of the rail industry with the goal of enhancing rail safety. As one of the initiatives arising from this Rail Safety Summit, the Secretary announced that DOT would begin developing safety standards for rail passenger equipment over a five-year period. In November, 1994, Congress adopted the Secretary's schedule for implementing rail passenger equipment regulations and included it in the Federal Railroad Safety Authorization Act of 1994 (the Act), Pub. L. No. 103-440, 108 Stat. 4619, 4623-4624 (November 2, 1994). Section 215 of the Act, as now codified at 49 U.S.C. 20133, requires: (a) MINIMUM STANDARDS.--The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe regulations establishing minimum standards for the safety of cars used by railroad carriers to transport passengers. Before prescribing such regulations, the Secretary shall consider-- (1) the crashworthiness of the cars; (2) interior features (including luggage restraints, seat belts, and exposed surfaces) that may affect passenger safety; (3) maintenance and inspection of the cars; (4) emergency response procedures and equipment; and (5) any operating rules and conditions that directly affect safety not otherwise governed by regulations. The Secretary may make applicable some or all of the standards established under this subsection to cars existing at the time the regulations are prescribed, as well as to new cars, and the Secretary shall explain in the rulemaking document the basis for making such standards applicable to existing cars. (b) INITIAL AND FINAL REGULATIONS.--(1) The Secretary shall prescribe initial regulations under subsection (a) within 3 years after the date of enactment of the Federal Railroad Safety Authorization Act of 1994. The initial regulations may exempt equipment used by tourist, historic, scenic, and excursion railroad carriers to transport passengers. (2) The Secretary shall prescribe final regulations under subsection (a) within 5 years after such date of enactment. (c) PERSONNEL.--The Secretary may establish within the Department of Transportation 2 additional full-time equivalent positions beyond the number permitted under existing law to assist with the drafting, prescribing, and implementation of regulations under this section. (d) CONSULTATION.--In prescribing regulations, issuing orders, and making amendments under this section, the Secretary may consult with Amtrak, public authorities operating railroad passenger service, other railroad carriers transporting passengers, organizations of passengers, and organizations of employees. A consultation is not subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.), but minutes of the consultation shall be placed in the public docket of the regulatory proceeding. The Secretary of Transportation has delegated these rulemaking responsibilities to the Federal Railroad Administrator. 49 CFR 1.49(m). III. Passenger Equipment Safety Standards Working Group Consistent with the intent of Congress that FRA consult with the railroad industry in prescribing these regulations, FRA invited various organizations to participate in a working group to focus on the issues related to railroad passenger equipment safety and assist FRA in developing Federal safety standards. The Passenger Equipment Safety Standards Working Group (or the ``Working Group'') first met on June 7, 1995, and has assisted FRA throughout the rulemaking process. Since its initial meeting, the Working Group has evolved so that its membership includes representatives from the following organizations: American Association of Private Railroad Car Owners, Inc. (AAPRCO) American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) APTA AAR Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (BLE) Brotherhood Railway Carmen (BRC) FRA Federal Transit Administration (FTA) of DOT National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) National Association of Railroad Passengers (NARP) Railway Progress Institute (RPI) Safe Travel America (STA) Transportation Workers Union of America (TWU) United Transportation Union (UTU), and Washington State Department of Transportation (WDOT) The Working Group is chaired by FRA, and supported by FRA program, legal, and research staff, including technical personnel from the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) of the Research and Special Programs Administration of DOT. FRA has included vendor representatives designated by RPI as associate members of the Working Group. FRA has also included the AAPRCO as an associate Working Group member. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has designated staff members to advise the Working Group. In developing proposed safety standards for passenger equipment operating at speeds greater than 125 mph but not exceeding 150 mph, FRA formed a subgroup (the ``Tier II Equipment Subgroup'') of Working Group members representing interests associated with the provision of rail passenger service at such high speeds. The full Working Group recommended the formation of a smaller subgroup to consider Tier II passenger equipment standards, as a number of Working Group members found the operation of high-speed passenger equipment to be outside their immediate interest and expertise. FRA invited representatives from organizations including Amtrak, the BLE, BRC, RPI, and UTU to participate in developing the Tier II standards. In accordance with 49 U.S.C. 20133(d), the evolving positions of the Working Group members--as reflected in the minutes of the group's meetings and associated documentation, together with data provided by the members during their deliberations--have been placed in the public docket of this rulemaking. IV. Proceedings to Date On June 17, 1996, FRA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) concerning the establishment of comprehensive safety standards for railroad passenger equipment (61 FR 30672). The ANPRM provided background information on the need for such standards, offered preliminary ideas on approaching passenger safety issues, and presented questions on various topics including: system safety programs and plans; passenger equipment crashworthiness; [[Page 25542]] inspection, testing, and maintenance requirements; training and qualification requirements for mechanical personnel and train crews; excursion, tourist, and private equipment; commuter equipment and operations; train make-up and operating speed; tiered safety standards; fire safety; and operating practices and procedures. FRA's commitment to developing proposed regulations through the Working Group necessarily influenced the role and purpose of the ANPRM. FRA specifically asked that members of the Working Group not respond formally to the ANPRM. The issues and ideas presented in the ANPRM had already been placed before the Working Group, and the Working Group had commented on drafts of the ANPRM. As a result, FRA solicited the submission of written comments that might be of assistance in developing a proposed rule from interested persons not involved in the Working Group's deliberations. FRA received 12 comments in response to the ANPRM. These comments were shared with the Working Group and were taken into consideration by the members of the group as they advised FRA during the development of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM). The Working Group worked intensively, and concluded with a meeting in Philadelphia on September 30-October 2, 1996. Working Group members agreed to the preparation of a NPRM reflecting partial consensus on a number of the issues in the rulemaking. However, the industry parties were unable to agree on any option with respect to inspection requirements for power brakes or daily inspection of equipment. Further, one labor organization later advised FRA that it could not participate in a consensus on less than the full range of issues in the rulemaking. FRA prepared in draft an NPRM and shared it with the Working Group members on March 19, 1997. The NPRM was then enriched with discussions of issues and options reflecting concerns of Working Group members in response to the draft, and some changes were incorporated into the proposed rule. On September 23, 1997, FRA published the NPRM (1997 NPRM) in the Federal Register to add a new part, 49 CFR part 238 (Passenger Equipment Safety Standards), and to amend 49 CFR parts 216 (Special Notice and Emergency Order Procedures: Railroad Track, Locomotive and Equipment), 223 (Safety Glazing Standards--Locomotives, Passenger Cars and Cabooses), 229 (Railroad Locomotive Safety Standards), 231 (Railroad Safety Appliance Standards), and 232 (Railroad Power Brakes and Drawbars). 62 FR 49728. The proposed part 238 set forth comprehensive Federal safety standards for the safety of railroad passenger equipment, including equipment design and performance standards for passenger and crew survivability in the event of a passenger train accident, as well as inspection, testing, and maintenance standards for passenger equipment. The 1997 NPRM generated written comments from 34 separate parties, and all of these comments may be found in the public docket of the rulemaking. The written comments included a request by the New York Department of Transportation (NYDOT) to extend the comment period for 90 days. The NYDOT sought this additional time to more thoroughly review the proposed rule, and secure expert testimony and empirical data on the proposed rule's possible impact on the high-speed intercity rail passenger program in the State of New York. FRA did not grant the request, however, particularly because FRA had planned to convene the Working Group in the interim and needed to assemble the comments on the rule for discussion within the Working Group. FRA asked the NYDOT to submit its comments by the close of the comment period on November 24, 1997, and it did so. FRA did explain to the NYDOT that it would consider comments submitted after the formal close of the comment period to the extent possible without incurring additional expense or delay in issuing the final rule, and FRA has done so. FRA held a public hearing on the proposed rule in Washington, D.C. on November 21, 1997, at which nine parties submitted oral comments. These parties consisted of: APTA; the BRC; the BLE; Amtrak; Renfe Talgo of America, Inc. (Talgo); WDOT; NARP; the Omniglow Corporation; and The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. (IEEE). A copy of the transcript of this hearing is available in the public docket of this rulemaking. As noted earlier, FRA convened the Passenger Equipment Safety Standards Working Group following the close of the comment period to consider the comments received in response to the 1997 NPRM and help develop the final rule. This continued the consultative process FRA has used throughout the rulemaking. Notice of the Working Group meetings was available through the FRA Docket Clerk, as stated in the NPRM, see 62 FR 49729, and the meetings were open to the public. The Working Group met in full in Washington, D.C., on December 15- 16, 1997. A smaller body of the Working Group met again on January 6, 1998, to discuss in particular high-speed passenger equipment safety issues, as well as brake inspection, testing and maintenance issues for long-distance intercity passenger trains. Minutes of these meetings, including copies of the discussion documents circulated at the meetings, are available in the public docket of the rulemaking. See 63 FR 28496; May 26, 1998. FRA received one set of written comments on the minutes of the meetings, which FRA had prepared, and these comments are also available in the same docket. V. Discussion of Specific Comments and Conclusions A. Application of the Final Rule to Rapid Transit Operations and ``Light Rail'' In the 1997 NPRM, FRA proposed applying the rule to rapid transit operations in an urban area, unless those operations are not connected with the general system of railroad transportation. In other words, FRA made clear that its rule would apply to rapid transit operations over the general system. The Utah Transit Authority (UTA), in commenting on the NPRM, expressed concern with the inclusion of rapid transit operations, including light rail transit, in the proposed rule. The UTA stated that the rule provided no definition of what is meant by the phrase ``not connected with the general railroad system of transportation.'' As a result, the UTA requested that the final rule provide such a definition. Further, the UTA requested that any such definition take into account rail operations that are time-separated or physically separated (using derails and electric locks), or both, so that under such circumstances rapid transit systems would not be considered connected with the general railroad system of transportation and, therefore, be excluded from the rule. In response to the 1997 NPRM, New Jersey Transit (NJT) commented that by permitting FRA to rule on whether a transit agency may operate light rail service over a freight right-of-way, FRA's jurisdiction would be expanded in conflict with FTA's mandate in 49 C.F.R. part 659. NJT explained that the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, Public Law 102-240, and 49 C.F.R. part 659 promulgated in its pursuance, required states to designate an agency of the state, other than a transit agency, to oversee and implement requirements concerning all fixed-guideway systems not under FRA's jurisdiction. [[Page 25543]] The safety jurisdictions of FRA and FTA are mutually exclusive. FTA's regulatory authority to issue regulations creating a state safety oversight program applies only to ``rail fixed guideway mass transportation systems not subject to regulation by the Federal Railroad Administration.'' 49 U.S.C. 5330(a). Consistent with DOT Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater's concept of One-DOT and the need to assure seamless application of intermodal transportation policies, FRA and FTA are jointly developing a proposed policy statement outlining the scope of FRA's jurisdiction over ``light rail'' operations that share the use of rights-of-way with conventional railroads. As discussed later in this document, the two agencies will be soliciting input from rail operators and other interested entities during the development of this policy statement. FRA's safety jurisdiction is very broad and extends to all types of railroads except for urban rapid transit operations not connected to the general railroad system. The term ``railroad'' is defined by statute as follows: In this part-- (1) ``railroad''-- (A) Means any form of nonhighway ground transportation that runs on rails or electromagnetic guideways, including-- (i) Commuter or other short-haul railroad passenger service in a metropolitan or suburban area and commuter railroad service that was operated by the Consolidated Rail Corporation on January 1, 1979; and (ii) High speed ground transportation systems that connect metropolitan areas, without regard to whether those systems use new technologies not associated with traditional railroads; but (B) does not include rapid transit operations in an urban area that are not connected to the general railroad system of transportation. 49 U.S.C. 20102. The statutory definition of the term ``railroad'' makes certain elements of FRA's safety jurisdiction quite clear: FRA, with one exception, has jurisdiction over all railroads regardless of the type of equipment they use, their connection to the general railroad system of transportation, or their status as a common carrier engaged in interstate commerce. FRA will, for example, assert jurisdiction over high-speed intercity rail service even if completely separated from the general railroad system that now exists and magnetic levitation systems that are not urban rapid transit. Commuter and other short-haul railroad passenger operations in a metropolitan or suburban area (except for one type of short-haul operation, i.e., urban rapid transit) are railroads within FRA's jurisdiction whether or not they are connected to the general railroad system. For operations on or over the general system, the commuter/rapid transit distinction has no jurisdictional relevance--all general system operations are within FRA's exercise of jurisdiction. Because the only urban rapid transit operations that FRA intends to cover under this rule are those on the general system, there is no need to expand on the commuter/rapid transit distinction here. Rapid transit operations in an urban area that are not connected to the general railroad system are not within FRA's jurisdiction. This is the sole exception to FRA's jurisdiction over all railroads. There is no exception for ``light rail,'' a term not found in the statute. Although FRA could assert jurisdiction over a rapid transit operation based on any connection it has to the general railroad system, FRA believes there are certain connections that are too minimal to warrant the exercise of its jurisdiction. For example, a rapid transit system that has a switch for receiving shipments from the general system railroad is not one over which FRA would assert jurisdiction. This assumes that the switch is used only for that purpose. In that case, any entry onto the rapid transit line by the freight railroad would be for a very short distance and solely for the purpose of dropping off or picking up cars. In this situation, the rapid transit line is in the same situation as any shipper or consignee; without this sort of connection, it cannot receive goods by rail. Absent a change in policy, FRA will not attempt to apply this rule to rapid transit systems with these sorts of connections. However, if such a system is properly considered a rail fixed guideway system, FTA's rules (49 CFR 659) will apply to it. Rapid transit operations in an urban area that are connected to the general railroad system of transportation are within FRA's jurisdiction. FRA will assert jurisdiction over a rapid transit operation that is conducted on or over the general system. It does not matter that the rapid transit operation occupies the track only at times when the freight, commuter, or intercity passenger railroad that shares the track is not operating. While such time separation could, as explained in the 1997 NPRM, provide the basis for waiver of certain of FRA's rules, it does not mean that FRA will not assert jurisdiction. However, FRA will assert jurisdiction over only the portions of the rapid transit system that are conducted on the general system. For example, a rapid transit line that operates over the general system for a portion of its length but has significant portions of street railway that are not part of the general system would be subject to FRA's rules only with respect to the general system portion. The remaining portions would not be subject to FRA's rules. If the non-general system portions of the rapid transit line are considered a ``rail fixed guideway system'' under 49 CFR part 659, those rules, issued by FTA, would apply to them. As discussed above, it is the nature and location of the railroad operation, not the nature of the equipment, that determines whether FRA has jurisdiction under the safety statutes. Light rail operations that operate on the general system are always within that statutory jurisdiction. They are not within the sole statutory exception (urban rapid transit not connected to the general system) so they are railroads under the safety statutes. The greatest risk inherent in the shared use of the trackage is a collision between the light rail equipment and conventional equipment. The light rail vehicles are not designed to withstand such a collision with far heavier equipment. Were such a crash to occur with either or both equipment operating at high speeds, the consequences for passengers in the light rail vehicle(s) would likely be catastrophic. In the past, FRA has withheld exercise of its jurisdiction with respect to light rail operations over general system trackage where there was full time separation (freight operations limited to nighttime hours). The recent proliferation of proposals for light rail operations on the general system and the issuance of this final rule establishing the first comprehensive Federal standards for railroad passenger equipment call for changing this approach. Moreover, recent developments have indicated that FRA's current approach assumes a degree of separation that is unlikely to be maintained over time. Proposals for limited overlap, deadhead movement of transit equipment, etc., have demonstrated the complexity of using common trackage for disparate purposes. Accordingly, FRA has asked that new transit starts that propose using the general rail system trackage submit appropriate waiver applications to FRA; such applications should be submitted as early as possible. As previously noted, FTA and FRA are working toward the development of a joint policy statement on the appropriate scope of FRA's jurisdiction over ``light rail'' that shares rights-of-way with conventional railroads. The agencies foresee an approach intended [[Page 25544]] to dovetail FRA's safety regulations with the FTA state safety oversight program where that is appropriate and FTA jurisdiction is applicable. The agencies would work together to ensure coordination of decision making. Before general implementation, the policy statement will be discussed with the affected communities of interest and may be published (together with any needed regulatory amendments) for formal comment in the Federal Register. At the same time this joint policy is issued, FRA plans to issue a separate proposed statement of policy that, among other things, will provide guidance on how light rail operators may seek waivers of FRA's rules. In the interim, the policy expressed in this preamble will guide FRA's actions with respect to this rule (subject to an appropriate period of consultation and adjustment with respect to the two time-separated shared use projects currently in operation). FRA does, however, recognize that lower speed rail operations that do not operate over highway-rail grade crossings and that totally preclude the sharing of trackage between light rail equipment and conventional equipment provide an operating environment that does not require the structural standards needed for commingled passenger and freight operations. Accordingly, the final rule (in Sec. 238.201) provides that passenger equipment, including locomotives, are not subject to the structural requirements of the rule if they are used exclusively on a rail line (A) with no public highway-rail grade crossings, (B) on which no freight operations occur at any time, (C) on which only passenger equipment of compatible design is utilized, and (D) on which trains operate at speeds no higher than 79 mph. FRA will discuss with the Working Group in Phase II of the rulemaking what structural standards are appropriate for such operations. B. Static End Sstrength Requirement: Application to Existing Equipment In Sec. 238.203 of the 1997 NPRM, FRA generally proposed that on or after January 1, 1998, all passenger equipment shall be required to have a minimum static end strength (or ``buff'' or ``compressive'' strength) of 800,000 pounds. As some commenters recognized, FRA intended the date of January 1, 1998, to represent the effective date of the final rule. Yet, in light of the actual publication date of the 1997 NPRM, the date of January 1, 1998, appeared anachronistic, and FRA should have modified the NPRM to make its intent more explicit. A number of commenters nonetheless raised concerns with the application of this section-whether the date were January 1, 1998, or later-since FRA proposed to apply the static end strength requirement to existing passenger equipment. APTA recommended, in its comments on the rule, that FRA modify the proposal so that the requirement apply on or after the effective date of the final rule to passenger equipment placed in service for the first time. APTA stated that the AEM-7 locomotive and the RTG model turbo train could not meet the requirement as proposed. APTA estimated that the purchase of replacement equipment could take up to four years and would cost more than $500 million. Amtrak commented that the proposed requirement to have buff loading apply to the existing rail fleet is not justified based on the industry's experience. Amtrak did agree that, in order to move the industry forward on crash energy management, new equipment must be built to a uniform strength standard. Amtrak stated that it currently operates AEM-7 locomotives that do not meet the proposed requirement. In addition, Amtrak was not sure it had available the appropriate technical information on whether its fleet of Heritage equipment conformed to the proposal. At the public hearing, though, Amtrak did explain that it had no evidence that its fleet of passenger cars did not comply with the proposal. (See transcript of public hearing, pages 173-174). The Northeast Illinois Regional Commuter Railroad Corporation (Metra), in its comments on the rule, recommended that the static end strength provision apply only to new passenger equipment orders placed on or after January 1, 1998. Metra explained that it was awaiting delivery of cars under construction, that some of the cars may be built after January 1, 1998, and that a change order would cause a series of problems. In commenting on the 1997 NPRM, Talgo expressed concern that FRA proposed applying the static end strength requirement to existing passenger equipment in service on or after January 1, 1998. Talgo stated that this proposal would render unusable its two trainsets then in service on lease to the WDOT. Additionally, Talgo explained that it was well underway in manufacturing five new trainsets--two for the WDOT, one for Amtrak, and two others for future sale in the U.S. market--that would likewise be rendered unusable in their current form. Talgo stated that neither it nor any other manufacturer of rail equipment could have anticipated the proposed regulation's immediate application of broad structural design changes. Citing discussions within the Working Group and the comments of other parties, Talgo asserted that other passenger equipment manufacturers and operators likewise assumed that modifications in basic structural standards would be applicable only to equipment purchased after January 1, 1999, or placed in service after January 1, 2001, and that much existing passenger equipment operating in the United States would be unable to comply with the structural requirements scheduled for early implementation. Talgo also stated that FRA did not properly identify the economic impact of its proposal on Talgo equipment. Talgo requested that FRA modify the rule so that the static end strength requirement and other structural requirements apply only to passenger equipment ordered on or after January 1, 1999, or placed in service for the first time on or after January 1, 2001. The WDOT commented that FRA's proposal appeared to be directly targeted at the State of Washington and Amtrak's purchase of Talgo trains under manufacture. WDOT stated that imposition of the proposal in the middle of the construction process, without ``grandfathering,'' appeared to reveal an effort to make its Talgo equipment non-compliant. WDOT recommended that the rule be modified so that the static end strength provision only apply to passenger equipment ordered after January 1, 1999. The NARP, in its comments on the proposed rule, shared WDOT's opposition to imposing the static end strength requirement on existing passenger equipment, and it recommended instead applying the requirement under a time-table similar to that proposed generally for structural requirements--i.e., ordered on or after January 1, 1999, or placed in service for the first time on or after January 1, 2001. The NARP believed that the proposal could cancel WDOT's rail passenger program and thereby lead to countless, unnecessary highway deaths involving people that otherwise would have been on a WDOT passenger train. In commenting on the 1997 NPRM, the State of Vermont Agency of Transportation (VAOT) explained that it was in the process of implementing new passenger rail service with used rail diesel cars manufactured by Budd. The cars were originally built to meet the AAR buff strength requirement, according to the VAOT, but it could not assure that the vehicles meet the standards today. The VAOT requested that the Budd cars be grandfathered because they were manufactured to AAR standards, built prior to April 1, [[Page 25545]] 1956, and have a proven service record. The VAOT believed it fair for the rulemaking to grandfather these cars as being compliant at the time ordered by VAOT. Similarly, the NYDOT recommended in its comments on the proposed rule that the structural requirements apply only to new equipment, citing its intent to operate rebuilt turboliner equipment in the Empire Corridor through a cooperative effort with FRA and Amtrak. Further, the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) expressed concern in its comments on the proposed rule that the rulemaking would require its fleet of rebuilt passenger, food service and specialty cars to undergo additional renovations and retrofitting to comply with the rule. NCDOT commented that its trainsets were designed to meet the passenger equipment safety standards in effect at the time of their order, and that the proposed regulation has the potential to thwart its rail passenger initiative. In the final rule, FRA is retaining the 800,000-pound static end strength requirement for most new and existing passenger equipment. However, the final rule does provide that the static end strength standard and other structural standards do not apply to equipment used exclusively on a rail line (A) with no public highway-rail grade crossings, (B) on which no freight operations occur at any time, (C) on which only passenger equipment of compatible design is utilized, and (D) on which trains operate at speeds no higher than 79 mph. See Sec. 238.201. Furthermore, the final rule creates a presumption that passenger equipment in service in the United States as of the effective date of the final rule meets the 800,000-pound static end strength requirement, unless the railroad operating the equipment knows, or FRA can show, that the equipment was not built to this 800,000-pound strength requirement. See Sec. 238.203(b). Under this formulation, for example, Amtrak's fleet of Heritage passenger cars are presumed to comply with the static end strength requirement on the basis of Amtrak's testimony at the public hearing on the NPRM. FRA has decided that it is in the best interest of safety to apply the buff strength requirement to existing passenger equipment and effectively regulate the use of passenger equipment not possessing at least 800,000 pounds of buff strength as specified in this rule. As noted, the operating environment in the United States requires railroad passenger equipment to operate commingled with heavy and long freight trains, often over track with frequent grade crossings used by heavy highway equipment. FRA has serious concerns about the operation in such an environment of passenger equipment not possessing a minimum buff strength of 800,000 pounds. As a result, and in response to Talgo's and WDOT's comments on this rule, FRA cannot avoid directly addressing the current operation in the United States of the passenger trainsets manufactured by Talgo unless FRA disregards its duty to provide for the safety of rail passenger transportation. Since FRA has raised the issue of compressive strength on passenger equipment with all affected parties since well before the inception of this rulemaking, it would strain credulity to assert that a requirement for 800,000 pounds of compressive strength could truly be a matter of surprise in a rulemaking on railroad passenger equipment safety. Making the 800,000-pound compressive strength requirement applicable to existing passenger equipment creates a bright line that will help bring needed clarity to the growing number of situations where light rail equipment is likely to be used on the general railroad system of transportation. Operation on the general system of this equipment, which is built to standards far lower than the 800,000-pound standard specified in this rule, presents enormous safety risks to the occupants of the equipment, absent imposition of strict conditions designed to virtually eliminate the risk of a light rail/conventional equipment collision. The need to address these risks as a condition of operation will be made perfectly clear by imposition of the buff strength requirement across the board. Light rail operators will have to seek a waiver of the requirement and will have to plan their operations in such a way as to maximize the likelihood of obtaining such a waiver. (A petition for grandfathering approval of the equipment could also be filed in certain cases, as discussed below.) In regulating the use of passenger equipment not possessing a minimum buff strength of 800,000 pounds as specified in this final rule, the rule permits non-compliant passenger equipment to be continued in service for a six-month period following publication of the rule in order to permit the filing of a grandfathering petition with FRA; if a petition is filed within this six-month period, operation may continue for up to an additional six months while the petition is being processed. Grandfathering approval of non-compliant equipment is limited to usage of the equipment on a particular rail line or lines. Before grandfathered equipment can be used on another rail line, a railroad must first file and secure approval of a grandfathering petition for such usage. See discussion under Sec. 238.203 for the contents of the petition and the approval process. FRA will approve a petition for ``grandfathering'' if it complies with the requirements of Sec. 238.203 and the proposed usage of the equipment is in the public interest and consistent with railroad safety. Amtrak and WDOT may file petitions for grandfathering approval of their Talgo-manufactured passenger equipment, in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 238.203. C. United States International Treaty Obligations The United States is a party to the General Agreement on Tarriffs and Trade (GATT). One of the GATT agreements is the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT), originally concluded in 1979 and approved by the United States Congress in the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, Pub. L. No. 96-39 (July 26, 1979). A new TBT Agreement was reached as a result of the 1994 Uruguay Round of GATT multinational trade negotiations, and subsequently approved by the United States Congress in the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, Pub. L. No. 103-465 (December 8, 1994). The TBT Agreement seeks to avoid creating unnecessary obstacles to trade, while recognizing the right of signatory countries to establish and maintain technical regulations for the protection of human, animal, and plant life or health. The TBT Agreement has been codified into law at 19 U.S.C. 2531 et seq. In commenting on the NPRM, Talgo believed that a number of the proposed structural standards were inconsistent with the TBT Agreement in that domestic industry would be favored by adopting the de facto standards of North American passenger equipment. Talgo stated that many requirements in the proposed rule seem to have been developed exclusively with domestically-manufactured equipment in mind, ``arbitrarily making compliance with the rules by other, non-U.S. manufactured equipment--such as Talgo equipment--extremely difficult.'' Talgo also asserted that domestic industry would be favored under the implementation schedule of the rule by noting FRA's statements in the NPRM that several of the proposed structural requirements chosen for early implementation reflect the current construction practice for North American passenger equipment. Talgo contended that the implementation [[Page 25546]] schedule disregards that, solely because imported equipment has been designed differently, it cannot satisfy the requirements at once. FRA believes that this final rule is consistent with the United States' obligations under the TBT Agreement, and that Talgo's concerns arise, in part, from a misunderstanding of FRA's use of the term ``North American passenger equipment.'' Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement, cited by Talgo in its comments, states: Members shall ensure that in respect of technical regulations, products imported from the territory of any Member shall be accorded treatment no less favorable than that accorded to like products of national origin and to like products originating in any other country. A ``technical regulation'' refers to mandatory product standards, and FRA agrees with Talgo that the structural standards in this rule fall under this definition. See Annex 1 to the TBT Agreement, ``Terms and Their Definitions for the Purpose of this Agreement, 1.'' However, the impact of this rule on Talgo passenger equipment, specifically its passenger cars, has nothing to do with the fact that the equipment originates in a foreign country, Spain, as opposed to the United States. Through this rule, FRA is not favoring rail passenger cars that are domestically manufactured over those of foreign origin since, as far as FRA is aware, there is currently no domestic manufacturer of rail passenger cars in the United States. (The General Electric Company and the General Motors Corporation manufacture locomotives in the United States--not rail passenger cars; and neither entity is being favored by FRA in this rule over foreign manufacturers of locomotives.) Of course, a significant portion of the nation's rail passenger car fleet--the oldest portion--has been manufactured in the United States. Yet, over the years, manufacturers from Japan, Canada, and other countries have exported passenger cars to the United States for service on the nation's railroads. Overall, these imported rail passenger cars have possessed the same minimum structural strength as their domestic forebearers; they have been constructed to standards that are common to North American passenger equipment, i.e., passenger equipment operated in North America. The five Talgo trainsets noted earlier have not been so constructed. FRA's use of the term North American passenger equipment (or United States passenger equipment, for that matter) was not intended to refer to passenger equipment manufactured in North America in distinction to passenger equipment manufactured elsewhere. Talgo also commented that, to a significant extent, the proposed requirements were design-based and phrased in a number of places in variables dependent on design rather than performance. In this regard, Talgo believed the proposed rule violates Article 2.8 of the TBT Agreement, which states: ``Wherever appropriate, Members shall specify technical regulations based on product requirements in terms of performance rather than design or descriptive characteristics.'' Talgo asserted that the rule can and should be stated in terms of variables relating to the performance of the equipment rather than its design, and that the rule should accommodate different engineering designs, such as its articulated, lightweight trainsets. The principal structural requirement of the final rule, which existing Talgo-manufactured passenger cars do not meet, is in fact a performance-based requirement. As further specified in Sec. 238.203, the rule requires that new and existing passenger cars must possess a minimum static end strength of 800,000 pounds. The rule does not dictate how a passenger car must be constructed to meet this requirement, as long as the car can resist the specified 800,000-pound load. This formulation is consistent with the requirements of 19 U.S.C. 2532(3), which states: Performance Criteria.--Each Federal agency shall, if appropriate, develop standards based on performance criteria such as those relating to the intended use of a product and the level of performance that the product must achieve under defined conditions, rather than on design criteria, such as those relating to physical form of the product or the types of material of which the product is made. (Of course, the rule does require that the body structure of a passenger car be designed, to the maximum extent possible, to fail by buckling or crushing, or both, of structural members when overloaded in compression rather than by fracture of structural members or failure of structural connections. See Sec. 238.203(c). Yet, in any regard, FRA believes it unsafe to design a passenger car to fail first by fracture of structural members or failure of structural connections, as the ability of the car structure to absorb collision energy is negated.) FRA recognizes that the five Talgo trainsets were designed to international standards that require lesser compressive strength. Talgo has pointed out that these trainsets will be configured in the same manner as two leased trainsets formerly operated in the State of Washington. These trains are intended to be pulled by a conventional locomotive and have unoccupied units at the front and rear of the trainsets which are available to absorb initial crash energy. Talgo contends that this configuration provides equivalent protection from loss of occupied volume in a rear-end or head-on collision when compared with conventional cars which would be occupied by passengers or crew. FRA has provided a process for WDOT and others to secure grandfathering approval regarding the compressive strength requirement for passenger equipment placed in use prior to November 8, 1999, as previously noted. However, as explained below, FRA is unable to relax the minimum compressive strength requirement for passenger equipment simply on the basis of train configuration, since to do so would diminish the safety provided for the rail travelling public as a whole. FRA believes the minimum static end strength requirement in the final rule is not inconsistent with the TBT Agreement, in that it fulfills FRA's objective of protecting human safety and only restricts the use of equipment not meeting that objective because of the performance of the equipment--not because of the origin of the equipment. In this regard, 19 U.S.C. 2531(b) provides in part: No standards-related activity of any * * * Federal agency * * * shall be deemed to constitute an unnecessary obstacle to the foreign commerce of the United States if the demonstrable purpose of the standards-related activity is to achieve a legitimate domestic purpose including * * * the protection of legitimate health or safety * * * and if such activity does not operate to exclude imported products which fully meet the objectives of such activity. Having a passenger car possess a minimum compressive strength of 800,000 pounds, along with other features, has evolved as a result of a long history of efforts by railroads and suppliers to learn the hard lessons taught by a difficult operating environment in the United States. Passenger train collisions and derailments may occur in a variety of different scenarios and implicate structural features of passenger equipment in similarly numerous ways. The rule cannot be applied in a general way to both (1) except any consist of passenger cars from the same compressive strength requirements applicable to all other passenger cars solely because the passenger car consist is buffered at each end by an unoccupied car and linked by articulated connections, and (2) provide [[Page 25547]] for the safety of the occupants of passenger cars. Further, over the past few years, FRA has funded the most extensive and detailed research and analysis ever conducted by a public body in the United States concerning passenger car safety. That effort has included attention to international practice, particularly for high- speed equipment. However, given existing data and analysis, FRA is unable to specify an alternate performance standard for passenger car compressive strength that would meet FRA's safety objectives and be equally applicable to passenger cars of any design that might some day be proffered for use in the United States. Nor, so far as FRA is aware, has any government or international body achieved a similar feat. Certainly doing so within the time available to issue standards under the 1994 statutory mandate would not have been possible. FRA notes that Talgo further commented that the early implementation dates proposed for certain structural requirements are inconsistent with Article 2.12 of the TBT Agreement in that a sufficient amount of time would not be provided foreign producers to modify their products' design or manufacturing processes to comply with new or significantly revised regulatory requirements. Article 2.12 provides: Except in those urgent circumstances referred to in [Article 2] paragraph 10 [of the TBT Agreement], Members shall allow a reasonable interval between the publication of technical regulations and their entry into force in order to allow time for producers in exporting Members * * * to adapt their products or methods of production to the requirements of the importing Member. In the final rule, the compressive strength requirement takes effect sooner than any other principal structural requirement, and it applies to both new and existing passenger cars and locomotives. If any provision of the rule were found to be inconsistent with Article 2.12 of the TBT Agreement, then, it would most likely be the compressive strength requirement. However, the United States Congress has expressly authorized applying the requirements of the final rule to existing passenger cars, provided only that the basis for doing so is explained in the rulemaking document. See Section 215 of the Federal Railroad Safety Authorization Act of 1994, above, as codified at 49 U.S.C. 20133 (``The Secretary may make applicable some or all of the standards established under this subsection [, 49 U.S.C. 20133(a),] to cars existing at the time the regulations are prescribed.''). FRA has made the compressive strength requirement applicable to existing passenger cars as explained in the preamble. However, through the submission of appropriate data and analysis, and approval by FRA as further specified in Sec. 238.203, discussed below, certain passenger cars not possessing the minimum compressive strength of 800,000 pounds may operate on the general railroad system of transportation, and the rule does afford a reasonable time for that information to be gathered. In providing the possibility that some equipment now being used which does not meet the buff strength requirement of this rule might continue to be used (``grandfathered''), FRA intends to permit only very safe operations to occur. Petitioners will need to demonstrate-- through a quantitative risk assessment that incorporates design information, engineering analysis of the equipment's static end strength and of the likely performance of the equipment in derailment and collision scenarios, and risk mitigation measures to avoid the possibility of collisions or to limit the speed at which a collision might occur, or both, that will be employed in connection with the usage of the equipment on a specified rail line or lines--that use of the equipment, as utilized in the service environment for which recognition is sought, is in the public interest and is consistent with railroad safety. In this regard, FRA notes that passenger equipment not possessing the minimum static end strength specified in this rule does not have the same capacity to absorb safely within its body structure the compressive forces that develop in a collision as equipment meeting the standard. The engineering analysis submitted by the petitioner should address how these forces will be dissipated in a manner that does not jeopardize occupant safety in collision scenarios. D. Non-Conventional Passenger Equipment As noted above, commenters have requested that FRA specify design- neutral or performance-based requirements so that the safety of all passenger equipment may be evaluated on the same basis. In comments in this docket, Talgo has suggested substituted (and reduced) force levels that it believes are appropriate for inclusion in the final rule in lieu of those proposed for truck-to-carbody attachment and anti- climbing arrangements, for instance. As explained, FRA has specified the compressive strength requirement as fairly as we are able in consideration of the safety of the rail travelling public. FRA has also done so with respect to the other structural requirements in the rule. FRA recognizes that the existing Talgo trainsets presents unique challenges in terms of describing appropriate force levels in several regards. FRA understands that the Talgo trainsets are articulated, low- floor trainsets with independently rotating wheels. The car bodies are made from light-weight aluminum extrusions. In contrast, the vast majority of passenger carrying equipment used on the nations's railroads is individually suspended, has automatic couplers, has a higher floor height above the rail, has wheels fixed to an axle, and is constructed with a steel underframe made up from fabricated members. FRA has conducted, and continues to conduct, research which addresses the influence of carbody construction, suspension configuration, and coupling arrangement on the crashworthiness, derailment tendency, and other safety-related aspects of Talgo and other non-conventional equipment. Developing safety regulations requires detailed technical knowledge of the system being regulated. At the time this rule is being written, FRA is unable to specify alternative performance-based standards with respect to the structural requirements in this rule that would meet FRA's safety objectives for passenger equipment of any design. Areas of particular technical concern with regard to the Talgo trainsets, which need to be resolved by FRA through an ongoing exchange of information, include the nature of its articulated connection and its potential to allow override in a collision, and the welding of the aluminum extrusions which make up the body shell. The Talgo tilt trainsets have characteristics that are unique, or nearly unique, that may either reduce or increase vulnerability in a derailment or collision. For instance, the articulated design of the trainset may tend to keep the train in line in the case of a derailment where the decelerations are reasonably uniform throughout the length of the train, preventing secondary impacts. On the other hand, the absence of major structural members in the floor of the passenger units could be a serious problem should the train be involved in a collision with freight train cars or lading that has fouled the track on which the passenger train is travelling, as a result of the freight train having derailed. In this regard, the absence of major structural members in the floor of the Talgo passenger units increases their vulnerability to penetration by the [[Page 25548]] trainset's trucks, should the trucks separate from the train. Historically, the United States industry requirement for a minimum compressive strength has reinforced a pattern of passenger car construction resulting in use of stiff, quite substantial underframes that have served other practical purposes in derailments and collisions, including prevention of car body buckling, prevention of harm to passengers from failure of the floor structure and entry of debris, and resistance to penetration of the car from the side where the primary impact was at the floor level. Both with respect to compressive strength and other structural requirements that the Talgo trainset may not be able to meet, it is important to ensure that alternative means of achieving crashworthiness are just as successful as the standards described in this final rule. Creating alternative performance-based standards for a particular type of passenger equipment requires a very early dialogue and technical information exchange. In the summer of 1995, FRA convened the first meeting of equipment manufacturers (including representatives of Canadian, European and Japanese consortia) to discuss passenger safety standards. That meeting led to designation of equipment manufacturer representatives as associate members of the Passenger Equipment Safety Standards Working Group. Although notified along with a number of other manufacturers of passenger equipment, Talgo representatives did not participate in the process. (For its part, the WDOT did not formally indicate to FRA an interest in participating in the rulemaking until after the Working Group had tentatively agreed on the structural standard proposals--FRA received a letter from the WDOT commenting on the ANPRM on September 4, 1996. However, AASHTO had participated from the beginning of the rulemaking.) Talgo did not enter the discussions directly until publication of the NPRM in September of 1997, and was still in the process of providing engineering data through October of 1998. Given the timing of this latest submission of data to FRA, approximately ten-months after the close of the public comment period on the NPRM, FRA has not had the opportunity to fully evaluate the information provided by Talgo for purposes of this rule. FRA appreciates Talgo's recent undertakings to conform any future trainsets (beyond the five trainsets noted earlier) built for North American service to the 800,000-pound static end strength requirement and any other applicable requirements in this rule. FRA will be pleased to work with Talgo and members of the Working Group in Phase II of the rulemaking to determine whether different performance-based regulations are appropriate. In the interim, FRA has provided a special approval process in Sec. 238.201 for considering whether the new generation of Talgo equipment and any other passenger equipment of special construction provide an equivalent level of safety with the Tier I standards (other than the static end strength requirements) contained in the final rule. See the discussion in the section-by-section analysis of Sec. 238.201 for an explanation of the special approval process. E. System Safety FRA believes that passenger railroads should carefully evaluate their operations with a view toward enhancing the safety of those operations. The importance of formal safety planning has been recognized in Emergency Order No. 20 (61 FR 6880; Feb. 22, 1996) and the rule on passenger train emergency preparedness (63 FR 24630; May 4, 1998). In furtherance of safety planning, the 1997 NPRM contained a set of system safety requirements to be applied to all intercity passenger and commuter rail equipment. See 62 FR 49760. FRA intended that each individual passenger railroad be required to develop a system safety plan and a system safety program tailored to its specific operation, including train speed. FRA explained, however, that the Working Group did not reach consensus on system safety requirements for Tier I equipment; whereas the Tier II Subgroup did reach full consensus on system safety program requirements for Tier II equipment. Strong support did exist among Working Group members to apply formal system safety planning to Tier I equipment, yet views differed as to whether system safety planning should be required by law. In particular, the 1997 NPRM noted that APTA objected to FRA issuing any regulations governing system safety plans because commuter railroads have voluntarily agreed to adopt such safety plans. 62 FR 49734. FRA also explained its understanding that APTA's system safety approach will be more comprehensive than what FRA proposed and address each commuter railroad's system more as an integrated whole, not focused principally on rail equipment. See 62 FR 49734. FRA therefore invited comment on APTA's suggestion that commuter railroads be allowed to regulate themselves in this area; whether FRA should mandate the contents of system safety plans; whether the areas FRA proposed to require railroads to address were appropriate; whether additional areas should be added; and to what extent FRA should propose to enforce portions of the system safety plans. FRA further asked whether the rule should require that system safety plans be comprehensive and address the entire railroad system in which the equipment operates, as well as whether the emergency preparedness planning requirements contained in the passenger train emergency preparedness rulemaking be expressly integrated with the system safety planning requirements contained in this part. Id. at 49733-4. In commenting on the rulemaking, APTA believed FRA's approach to system safety short-sighted in that it would apply only to the equipment component of the commuter railroad system and therefore ignore track, signal system, other infrastructure, and operating practices components. Further, APTA questioned FRA's general focus in the system safety plan (on fire safety; software safety; inspection, testing and maintenance; training; and new equipment) prior to having a railroad identify its major safety risks through its individual system level analysis. APTA stated that it supports a true system safety approach that allows each railroad to determine its own major safety risks and addresses all the components of the passenger rail system-- not just the equipment component. As an alternative to Federal regulation, APTA proposed a system safety program based on system safety plans--developed using MIL-STD- 882C as a guide--that would be submitted by its individual member railroad properties and audited by APTA. APTA explained it would invite FRA to observe the audits and the follow-up actions taken by the commuter railroads in response to the audits. APTA requested that FRA hold Federal requirements for commuter railroad system safety plans in abeyance for a 3-year probationary period--corresponding to one complete audit cycle--while FRA observes and evaluates the program. Amtrak commented that it supports APTA's position on system safety for both Tier I and Tier II equipment. Amtrak believed it appropriate for FRA to start with a voluntary system safety approach and then, based on actual experience, follow up with specific regulations in the future. Amtrak believed FRA needs to allow the industry the time to establish the [[Page 25549]] culture and process that allows system safety to function without creating an unwarranted bureaucratic burden. In its comments on the 1997 NPRM, Metra agreed with the value of a system safety plan, but believed that such plans should not be regulated. Metra recommended the rule contain only a top-level system safety plan requirement for railroads to identify the most serious safety risks within their specific operations, and then allow each railroad to create its own programs to reduce those risks. Metra explained that a railroad's system safety plan should project beyond current practice to continuously improve that practice and that Federal enforcement of such a plan would continually find violations because current practice would not reflect the ideals set forth in the plan. Metra believed that FRA regulation would make a system safety plan a useless tool for improving safety, as the plan would be limited to mimicking Federal regulation and describing current practice. In addition, Metra noted that a system safety plan is distinct from a document that describes current practice for routine and regulated activities. Metra proposed that this document, a safety policy, reference all current-practice safety-related procedures and require railroads to adhere to them. Bombardier commented that the 1997 NPRM does not provide the latitude for each railroad to tailor or customize its system safety plan to its individual operations and needs. Further, Bombardier believed that the NPRM confuses the requirements for the railroad's system safety plan with those required for equipment acquisition. If FRA insists that the rule contain a requirement for a system safety plan, according to Bombardier, it should be limited to requiring each railroad to develop its own plan based on MIL-STD-882C or APTA's Manual for the Development of a System Safety Plan for Commuter Railroads. Separately, the rule should require a system safety plan specifically addressing equipment procurement. The BRC commented that FRA must mandate the contents of system safety plans to ensure that vital topics are included in such plans. Further, the BRC believed FRA must have the power to enforce compliance with system safety plans. Otherwise, the BRC believed the plans themselves would amount to little more than suggested operating practices. The BRC also believed that FRA must review each railroad's system safety plan and approve it only if it complies with Federal regulations. Similarly, the UTU commented that the 1997 NPRM's provisions on system safety plans is the most important section of the rule. The UTU believed FRA should continue to treat it as such and not allow it to be weakened. The NTSB commented that it supports FRA mandating the contents of system safety plans for minimal consistency and oversight, rather than allowing the railroads to regulate themselves in this area, so that important safety elements are consistently included in each safety plan. The NTSB believed that the system safety plans should be comprehensive and address the entire railroad system in which the passenger equipment operates. The NTSB observed that if the industry does not have a comprehensive system safety plan, it may not be able to identify, track, monitor, or rectify situations that can lead to unsafe conditions. Further, the NTSB remarked that system safety should be a continuous, iterative process that has a built-in feedback mechanism and should be used throughout the program's life cycle to arrive at the best plan possible. The NTSB noted that it has made safety recommendations urging FRA to include specific safety requirements in a system safety plan. It urged FRA to incorporate the following recommendations into FRA's general requirements for system safety plans: Require carriers to train employees in emergency procedures to be used after an accident, to establish priorities for emergency action, and to conduct accident simulation to test the effectiveness of the program, inviting civic emergency personnel participation. (R-76-29) Develop and validate through simulated disaster exercises a model emergency response plan for the guidance of the railroad industry in formulating individual plans to be utilized by their train crewmembers in the event of an emergency. (R-80-6) In this regard, FRA did issue final regulations governing the preparation, adoption, and implementation of emergency preparedness plans by railroads connected with the operation of passenger trains, in the passenger train emergency preparedness rulemaking. See 63 FR 24630, May 4, 1998. That rule specifically requires emergency preparedness plans to address such subjects as communication, employee training and qualification, joint operations, tunnel safety, liaison with emergency responders, on-board emergency equipment, and passenger safety information. The plan adopted by each affected railroad is also subject to formal review and approval by FRA. FRA believes the approach taken in the emergency preparedness rulemaking in requiring railroads to adopt a safety plan addressing specific topics is more appropriate than imposing a general requirement for railroads to adopt a comprehensive system safety plan. FRA believes this is consistent with the view of the commenters to mandate the contents of safety program plans for minimal consistency and oversight, so that important safety elements are included in each safety plan. At the same time, focusing the safety planning requirements and streamlining the rule will facilitate the regulated community's understanding of the rule's requirements and thereby aid in its compliance. As further specified, the final rule will require that each railroad adopt safety program plans addressing: Fire safety; Employee training and qualifications; Equipment inspection, testing, and maintenance; Pre-revenue service acceptance testing of equipment; and Train hardware and software safety. In addition, more particular safety planning requirements are imposed on Tier II passenger equipment, as discussed below, reflecting both the greater risks to safety from operating the equipment at such high speeds and the importance of advanced planning in order to meet new safety challenges. As FRA recognized in the 1997 NPRM, FRA's proposed approach to system safety focused principally on rail passenger equipment. This was not a pure system safety approach, inasmuch as FRA did not focus on safety planning for others elements of the railroad infrastructure such as the track and signal system, or for a host of items including platform safety, security and trespasser prevention. FRA will closely monitor Tier I railroad operations in their development and adherence to voluntary, comprehensive system safety plans. FRA has already established a liaison relationship with APTA and has already begun participating in system safety plan audits on commuter railroads. FRA is using this involvement to enrich FRA's Safety Assurance and Compliance Program (SACP) efforts on these railroads--which, unlike the triennial audit process for system safety plans, is a continuous activity with frequent on-property involvement by FRA safety professionals. FRA will reconsider its decision not to impose a general requirement for system safety plans on Tier I railroad operations if the need to do so arises. FRA expects that [[Page 25550]] Tier I railroad operations will be able to integrate the specific safety planning requirements contained in this final rule into their own system safety plans, in the same way the railroads will incorporate into their plans the emergency planning requirements contained in 49 CFR part 239. FRA is retaining more extensive safety planning requirements for Tier II railroad operations. These requirements are directed at ensuring the safety of the equipment in its operating environment and that the introduction of novel technology is thoroughly analyzed prior to procurement of the equipment. Tier II railroad operations will be operations with new characteristics that require special attention and have heightened safety risks due to the speed of the equipment. In particular, each railroad must a have safety program plan for the operation of its Tier II passenger equipment prior to placing the equipment into revenue service. In addition, each railroad must have a safety program plan for each procurement of Tier II passenger equipment or major upgrade or introduction of new technology in Tier II passenger equipment. The railroad must also receive FRA approval of a pre-revenue service acceptance testing plan, as well as FRA approval prior to placing such new or modified equipment into revenue service. In general, however, the final rule does not require that FRA approve a railroad's safety plans required under the rule. As noted, FRA believes it best to focus its resources on Tier II passenger equipment operations due to their special circumstances. Further, FRA approval may not be necessary when, by operation of the rule, each railroad must independently comply with specific safety planning requirements or face sanction from FRA. Under 49 CFR Sec. 238.11 of the final rule, any person who violates any requirement of this part or causes the violation of any such requirement is subject to a civil penalty. F. Side Exit Doors on Passenger Cars In the 1997 NPRM, FRA generally proposed that new passenger cars have a minimum of four exterior side doors--or the functional equivalent of four such doors--each door permitting at least one 95th- percentile male to pass through at a single time. See 62 FR 49807 (Sec. 238.237), and 62 FR 49820 (Sec. 238.441). Exterior side doors are the primary means of egress from a passenger train, yet there is no Federal requirement that a passenger car be equipped with such doors. FRA does recognize that in an emergency passengers would generally be able to move through a passenger car's end doors to seek refuge in adjacent cars. In fact, it is safer for passengers to remain on a train unless doing so in itself risks their safety, because of hazards along the railroad right-of-way such as electrified rails and other trains. However, the tragic September 22, 1993 Amtrak train derailment near Mobile, Alabama, and the February 16, 1996 collision involving MARC and Amtrak passenger trains near Silver Spring, Maryland, show that in a life-threatening situation passengers have no alternative but to exit the train. All of the 42 passenger fatalities in the Mobile, Alabama train derailment resulted from asphyxia due to drowning (NTSB Railroad- Marine Accident Report 94/01), and the deaths of at least eight of the eleven persons killed in the Silver Spring, Maryland train collision resulted from the fire that ensued (NTSB Railroad Accident Report (RAR) 97/02). FRA is not suggesting that the cars involved in those accidents lacked a sufficient number of emergency exits; nevertheless, these are examples of instances where passengers have died because they could not leave the train. (However, the NTSB did note in its investigation report of the Silver Spring, Maryland train collision that ``[e]xcept for those passengers who died of blunt trauma injuries, others may have survived the accident, albeit with thermal injuries, had proper and immediate egress from the car been available.'' Id. at page 63. The NTSB explained in its explicit findings on the collision that ``the emergency egress of passengers was impeded because the passenger cars lacked readily accessible and identifiable quick-release mechanisms for the exterior doors, removable windows or kick panels in the side doors, and adequate emergency instruction signage.'' Id. at 73.) So that each passenger car has sufficient doorway openings to allow passengers and crewmembers to exit quickly in a life-threatening situation, FRA proposed requiring that passenger cars be equipped with side doors. Exiting a passenger train through a functioning emergency window exit is slower than exiting a train through a functioning door, and presents a risk of non-fatal injury. FRA made clear in the 1997 NPRM that the proposed side door requirement was not a recommendation of the Working Group, although FRA believed such a requirement necessary at least as an interim measure. See 62 FR 49770. FRA also recognized that existing designs of passenger cars do not always provide for four side doors, and, in fact, the proposed requirement did not specifically require that passenger cars have four side doors. For instance, the requirement would have been met if a passenger car had two double-wide doors that permit two 95th-percentile males to pass through each such door at the same time--the functional equivalent of four side doors having openings of the same size in the aggregate. FRA invited comments concerning the extent to which existing designs of passenger cars could not comply with the proposed requirement, noting that modifications to the proposal may be necessary based on the information supplied. Further, as a long-term approach, FRA explained that it is investigating an emergency evacuation performance requirement similar to that used in commercial aviation where a sufficient number of emergency exits must be provided to evacuate the maximum passenger load in a specified time for various types of emergency situations. In its comments on the 1997 NPRM, APTA stated that the proposed requirement would eliminate certain types of cars as well as certain desirable car design safety features. Specifically, Amtrak would not be able to procure Viewliner cars and NJT would not be able to increase the number of Comet IV cab cars with extra structural protection for train operators, according to APTA. APTA recommended that the rule text be modified to include passenger car end doors in the calculation of the required number of door exits. APTA believed this would encourage structural changes that involve the elimination of a side door to provide additional protection to train operators and allow Amtrak to continue its Viewliner cars in service. Amtrak, in commenting on the proposal, expressed particular concern that the proposed requirement would prevent the future construction of its Bi-Level Superliner equipment in a configuration that maximizes the equipment's economic performance. Amtrak noted that its current policy calls for equipping every window in such equipment with at least one emergency pane, and that the proposed requirement would not take that into consideration. Amtrak supported APTA's recommended modification to the rule text. The NARP also questioned the proposed side exterior door requirement for passenger cars. The NARP noted that the most common way to exit a car in an emergency is through the car's end doors, and it suggested that emergency window exits are probably more reliable than additional doors, believing the [[Page 25551]] doors are more likely to be rendered inoperable. The NARP stated that research should focus on the relationship between a car's seating capacity and layout and its emergency-exit capacity. The NARP opposed requiring four doors on a 44-foot Talgo car, and saw little benefit from adding additional doors to a Superliner dining car without a costly stairwell installation. The NARP asserted that a requirement for four side doors may be economically fatal for a single-level dining car, and advised instead that one side door may be provided in the hallway opposite the kitchen and a second side door placed in the kitchen. In commenting on the proposal, WDOT believed it not appropriate to require four side doors on a 44-foot Talgo passenger car, which is approximately half the length of conventional passenger cars. WDOT stated that a Talgo passenger car has two exterior doors for a maximum of 36 people in each car, while an Amtrak Horizon coach has four exterior doors and seats 72 passengers. WDOT maintained that the rule should reflect these differences or provide clear, concise performance- based standards in the alternative. In this regard, WDOT found the term ``functional equivalent'' as used in the rule to be vague and in need of better definition. Further, WDOT commented that, traditionally, dining and bistro cars have not had exterior side doors; and requiring such doors in these cars would significantly decrease the amount of available dining space, decrease revenue-generating space, and add substantial costs. WDOT recommended FRA remove dining and bistro cars from any exterior side door requirement as it would decrease the amount of available dining space and thereby reduce passenger convenience, comfort and satisfaction. Talgo similarly commented that the proposed requirement should be modified to state that the functional equivalent of four side doors in a car of conventional length is two side doors in a car of half the length, and that dining and bistro cars be exempted from any requirement. In response to the proposal in the NPRM, Bombardier recommended that the wording of the rule be changed to require that each passenger car have a minimum of two side doors. Bombardier noted that on Amtrak's high-speed trainsets (HST), the passenger cars that will be positioned next to the power cars are equipped with only two exterior side doors, both of which are located on the end nearest to the power car. In the event of an evacuation, Bombardier explained that passengers could exit through those side doors as well as through the door at the opposite end of the car. Bombardier believed the use of such end doors should be considered in determining the time needed to evacuate a passenger car, and it noted in this regard that intercity passenger cars generally carry fewer passengers than commuter cars. Based on the comments received, FRA has decided to modify the requirement for exterior side doors on Tier I passenger cars ordered on or after September 8, 2000 or placed in service for the first time on or after September 9, 2002, and for any Tier II passenger car placed in service. The final rule requires that each such passenger car have a minimum of two exterior side doors, and each door must have a minimum clear opening of 30 inches horizontally by 74 inches vertically. Since the minimum number of required side doors has been reduced from that proposed in the NPRM, this provision should not hinder railroads from removing the locomotive engineer's exterior side door in cab car and MU locomotive control compartments for purposes of adding to the structural integrity of the equipment. As the BLE raised in its comments on the rule, removing this side door allows for a continuous side sill structure along the control compartment, thereby enhancing the compartment's structural integrity and reducing the risk the compartment will be crushed in a corner or side impact. A dining car or other food service car is subject to the side door requirement as a passenger car under this rule, since FRA believes that all passenger cars must have exterior side doorway openings to allow for passenger and crew escape in a life-threatening situation, and also permit emergency rescue access. Unlike the proposed rule, FRA has specified the dimensions of the doorway opening in inches rather than retain the language referencing a 95th-percentile adult male. This modification clarifies the rule for the regulated community in that what constituted a 95th-percentile adult male was originally not defined. FRA believes that a doorway with a minimum clear opening of 30 inches horizontally by 74 inches vertically will provide passage for a large, fully-clothed person and accommodate emergency response personnel equipped with fire and rescue gear. For instance, see the discussion below of Sec. 238.113 (Emergency window exits) for detail on the sizes of adult backboards used by emergency responders to evacuate injured persons. FRA has specified the vertical dimension of 74 inches based on the height of the 95th- percentile adult male (72.8 inches) stated in Table 2 of Public Health Service Publication No. 1000, Series 11, No. 8, ``Weight, Height, and Selected Body Dimensions of Adults,'' June 1965. (A copy of this document has been placed in the public docket for this rulemaking.) The stated height of 72.8 inches was recorded for adult males not wearing shoes, and FRA has adjusted for this. FRA did not find this Public Health Service Publication that useful for purposes of specifying a horizontal dimension of the doorway as the stated body dimensions were, in effect, recorded without clothing (see page 5)--and of course did not address the size of equipment carried by emergency response personnel. FRA notes that the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Accessibility Specifications for Transportation Vehicles also contain requirements for doorway width clearance (See 49 CFR part 38). These ADA requirements apply by their own force independent of the requirements of this rule. Further, unlike the proposed rule, the final rule no longer provides that a passenger car may have the functional equivalent of the specified number of side doors. Each passenger car must have at least two separate, exterior side doorway openings. This will increase the likelihood that at least one of a passenger car's side doorway openings will allow passage in the event a train collision or derailment results in either, or both, structural damage to--or blockage of--the door. In this regard, railroads should consider where the passenger car side doors are located so as to facilitate passenger and crew escape in a life-threatening situation. FRA reemphasizes that this requirement is only an interim measure that will prevent passenger cars from being introduced into service without side exterior doors. In Phase II of the rulemaking, FRA will focus on formulating a systems approach to emergency egress that provides for a sufficient number of emergency exits to evacuate the maximum passenger car load in a specified time for various types of emergency situations. FRA will evaluate with the Working Group whether APTA's recommended approach to emergency egress under development in APTA's PRESS Task Force should be incorporated into the Phase II rulemaking. G. Fuel Tank Standards Locomotive diesel fuel tanks are vulnerable to damage from collisions, derailments, and debris on the roadbed due to their location on the underframe and between the trucks of locomotives. Damage to the tank frequently results in spilled fuel, creating the safety problem [[Page 25552]] of an increased risk of fire and the environmental problem of cleanup and restoration of the spill site. Although 49 CFR 229.71 does require a minimum clearance of 2.5 inches between the top of the rail and the lowest point on a part or appliance of a locomotive, such as a fuel tank, FRA regulations do not address the safety of fuel tanks in particular. In 1992, the NTSB issued a report identifying concerns regarding safety problems caused by diesel fuel spills from ruptured or punctured locomotive fuel tanks. Entitled ``Locomotive Fuel Tank Integrity Safety Study,'' the NTSB report cited in particular a collision involving an Amtrak train and an MBTA commuter train on December 12, 1990, as both trains were entering a station in Boston, Massachusetts. (NTSB Safety Study-92/04.) Fuel spilled from a tank which had separated from an Amtrak locomotive during the collision. The fuel ignited. Smoke and fumes from the burning diesel fuel filled the tunnel, increasing the hazard level in the post-crash phase of the accident, and hindering emergency response activity. As a result of the safety study, the NTSB made several safety recommendations to FRA, including in particular that FRA: Conduct, in conjunction with the Association of American Railroads, General Electric, and the Electro-Motive Division of General Motors, research to determine if the locomotive fuel tank can be improved to withstand forces encountered in the more severe locomotive derailment accidents or if fuel containment can be improved to reduce the rate of fuel leakage and fuel ignition. Consideration should be given to crash or simulated testing and evaluation of recent and proposed design modifications to the locomotive fuel tank, including increasing the structural strength of end and side wall plates, raising the tank higher above the rail, and using internal tank bladders and foam inserts. (Class II, Priority Action) (R-92-10) Establish, if warranted, minimum performance standards for locomotive fuel tanks based on the research called for in recommendation R-92-10. (Class III, Longer Term Action) (R-92-11) The NTSB reiterated Safety Recommendation R-92-10 in a letter to FRA dated August 28, 1997, conveying the NTSB's final safety recommendations arising from the February 16, 1996, collision between a MARC commuter train and an Amtrak passenger train. During the collision, the fuel tank on the lead Amtrak locomotive ruptured catastrophically. The fuel sprayed into the exposed interior of the MARC cab control car and ignited, engulfing the car. (Letter at 12.) As explained in FRA's report to Congress on locomotive crashworthiness and working conditions, FRA believes that fuel tank design has a direct impact on safety. Minimum performance standards for locomotive fuel tanks should be included in Federal safety regulations. Accordingly, FRA proposed in the 1997 NPRM that AAR Recommended Practice No. 506 (RP-506), Performance Requirements for Diesel-Electric Locomotive Fuel Tanks, be incorporated into the rule as the external fuel tank requirements for Tier I passenger locomotives. FRA believes that RP-506 represents a good, interim safety standard for Tier I passenger locomotives. In the final rule, FRA has restated the requirements of RP-506 as Appendix D to part 238, as explained below, and has thereby incorporated it into the final rule. FRA does note that further study may yield additional safety improvements for locomotive fuel tank design, and in September of 1997 FRA convened a Locomotive Crashworthiness Working Group of the Railroad Safety Advisory Committee (RSAC) to develop standards regarding a broad range of crashworthiness issues for both passenger and freight locomotives, including fuel tanks. Freight locomotive fuel tanks can cause a risk to passengers in the event of a train-to-train collision involving a passenger and a freight train. Therefore, in addition to the economy that can be achieved from standard fuel tank design requirements for the entire industry, industry-wide design requirements benefit both public and employee safety. Based on currently available information through the Locomotive Crashworthiness Working Group, it appears that locomotives built with AAR RP-506-compliant fuel tanks are performing well in derailments and highway-rail crossing collisions. In its comments on the proposed rule, the NTSB agreed that external fuel tanks on Tier I locomotives should incorporate at a minimum, and on an interim basis, RP-506. Yet, the NTSB believed that more demanding safety standards for passenger locomotives be included in the permanent Tier I fuel tank regulations, specifically: higher ground clearance, compartmentalization, and a bottom skid plate. The NTSB noted that the advantages of higher fuel tank ground clearance were shown in Amtrak derailments in Kingman, Arizona, and Garden City, Georgia. According to the NTSB, investigation of both accidents revealed that essentially no fuel loss occurred in the involved locomotive units (GE Models P40 and P42), despite a substantial accumulation of debris beneath the fuel tanks that may have otherwise damaged current, conventional frame- suspended fuel tanks. The NTSB attributed the maintenance of fuel tank integrity to higher than typical fuel tank ground clearance, not found in conventionally designed, frame-suspended fuel tanks. Accordingly, the NTSB specifically recommended that fuel tank regulations should require higher ground clearance for both Tier I and Tier II operations. In light of the strong potential safety benefits associated with higher locomotive fuel tank ground clearance, FRA will carefully consider with the Working Group how best to implement the NTSB's recommendation in Phase II of this rulemaking. In addition, FRA invited comments whether the proposed rule should require that locomotive fuel tanks be compartmentalized. The Working Group specifically discussed requiring whether the interior of fuel tanks be divided into a minimum of four separate compartments so that a penetration in the exterior skin of any one compartment results in loss of fuel only from that compartment. The Working Group recommended that such a requirement be addressed in the second phase of the rulemaking, to allow for additional research to remedy fuel feeding disruptions that may result from the compartmentalization of fuel tanks. Commenters were therefore requested to provide the results of specific research and operating experience showing how compartmentalization can be practically accomplished. Commenters were also asked to explain why the issue of compartmentalization should or should not be addressed in the final rule of this first phase of the rulemaking. The NTSB commented that it supported continued research for fuel tank compartmentalization to remedy fuel loss during derailments. It stated that compartmentalization is required in aviation applications, where fuel tanks within the airframe contour must be able to resist rupture and retain fuel under inertial forces prescribed for emergency landing conditions (citing 14 CFR 25.963). Therefore, research should be conducted to determine if similar successes can be attained in railroad application, according to the NTSB. The BLE also commented that it supports requirements for compartmentalized fuel tanks on all passenger locomotives. Noting that diesel fires create devastating results in passenger train accidents, the BLE believed every effort should be made to avoid them, including using the most advanced technology possible. Further, APTA commented that it believes fuel tank compartmentalization has the potential to reduce the amount of fuel [[Page 25553]] spilled in a railroad accident; recommended that FRA consider requiring compartmentalized fuel tanks on new locomotives if the technical difficulties resulting in interruptions in fuel flow are resolved; and suggested that FRA make a priority to resolve these technical difficulties. In accordance with these comments, FRA will carefully consider with the Working Group in Phase II of the rulemaking a requirement to compartmentalize fuel tanks on new locomotives, drawing upon research conducted and experience gained in the interim through the Locomotive Crashworthiness Working Group and the APTA PRESS Task Force. H. Train Interior Safety Based on previous research results, the interior passenger protection requirements for Tier I and II passenger equipment rely on ``compartmentalization'' as a passenger protection strategy. Such a strategy has the advantages of being passive, i.e., requiring no action to be taken on the part of the occupants, of being effective for a range of occupant sizes, and potentially being effective in a wide range of interior configurations. Research results indicate that during a collision the interior environment of a passenger coach car is substantially less hostile than the interiors of automobiles and aircraft. Owing to this lower hostility in a collision environment, the interior of a typical passenger coach car can provide a level of protection to passengers without active restraints at least as effective in preventing fatality as that protection afforded to automobile and transport aircraft passengers with active restraints. See the discussion on train interior safety in the NPRM for more detail. 62 FR 49745-49749. Conclusions from the research previously conducted on passenger protection in train collisions show that lap belts and shoulder restraints, if used, provide the highest level of occupant protection of those protection strategies studied--greater than the level of protection afforded by compartmentalization. However, as noted in the NPRM, FRA believes that more research is necessary to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of these active restraints, as well as the impact on seat design and strength necessary to support the loads associated with use of the restraints. In this regard, FRA requested information and comment from interested parties whether there is any existing research or experience which would justify active seat restraints in this phase of"
