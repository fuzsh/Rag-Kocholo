Products that transport only objects without transporting people are called lifts, and there are products with various lifting mechanisms, such as products that can transport heavy objects and products that can transport objects at high speeds.\n\nUses of Electric Lifts\n\nElectric lifts are used in warehouses, public facilities, and construction sites. In warehouses and construction sites, they are used for transporting objects, and in public facilities, they are used to transport wheelchairs and other items. When selecting an electric lift, it is necessary to consider whether the object to be transported is suitable for the electric lift, the speed of transport, transport distance, safety, size, and other factors. In addition to the equipped type, there are also products that can be easily moved, so it is important to select the right type of elevator for the application.\n\nPrinciple of Electric Lifts\n\nThe following is an explanation of the principle of operation of electric lifts, divided into typical electric lifts: Lift table type, wire type, and wheelchair type.\n\n1. Lift Table Type\n\nThe lift table type consists of a base, a scaffold, and a movable pillar connecting them. The two columns are connected in the form of an intersection, and an electric motor is installed at the intersection. During operation, the motor rotates to raise or lower an object by changing the angle of intersection of the crossed columns.\n\n2. Wire Type\n\nThe wire type consists of a wire, a wire winder, and a motor. The wire type is placed above the object to be moved, rotates the motor, and winds the wire to transport the object to the top.\n\n3. Wheelchair Type\n\nThe wheelchair side consists of a rail attached to the stairs, tires to move on the rail, and a scaffold. In operation, the motor rotates, causing the tires to move on the rail and transport the scaffold, thereby transporting the person appearing in the wheelchair by the wheelchair."
