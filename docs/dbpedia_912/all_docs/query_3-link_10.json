Subsequent recommissioning work is said to have included overhauling the four Keihin carburetors, flushing the brake fluid, and changing the battery. Powered by a 749cc DOHC inline-four paired with a five-speed transmission, the motorcycle is finished in two-tone maroon and red with gold pinstriping, chrome fenders, and 10th Anniversary badges. It also features a stepped two-up seat, an electric starter, a chrome four-into-four exhaust system, a front disc brake, ComStar cast alloy wheels, and both center and side stands. This CB750K is offered at no reserve with a tool kit and a clean California title in the seller's name. http://dlvr.it/TB8Kbd Bringatrailer.com #carsofinstagram #carporn #classiccar"
