        "text": "The timeline of mechanical engineering innovation is a chronological list of particularly important or significant mechanical engineering inventions and their inventors, where known. This timeline initially started as an inventory of significant mechanical engineering innovation by the History and Heritage Committee of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). The extensive inventory then added some items from a listing prepared by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE).[1] The resulting inventory was then prepared into a Timeline, to which additional mechanical engineering innovations are added periodically as information and documentation becomes available.\n\nIf you are aware of a significant mechanical engineering innovation that is not listed, you are encouraged to add it to this timeline. Edits are also welcome.\n\nNote: Dates for inventions are often controversial. Sometimes several inventors create an important innovation around the same time, or an innovation may be invented in an impractical form many years before another inventor improves the invention into a practical form. The intention of this timeline is to emphasize innovation that has been created, rather than hypothesized, although often both events are cited in this Timeline.\n\nBefore Common Era\n\n8000 BC: First boats[2]. Egyptian rock paintings illustrate canoes, dugouts and rafts. The oldest recovered boat in the world is the 3 meter long Pesse canoe constructed around 8,000 BCE, however far earlier boats most likely existed. A rock carving in Azerbaijan dating from ~10,000 BCE shows a reed boat manned by about 20 paddlers.\n\n3500 BC: The Bronocice pot from Southern Poland illustrates a wheeled vehicle. It shows a wagon with four wheels and two axles.\n\n3300 BC: The first depiction of a ship using cloth sails in found in Egyptian paintings. The earliest known explorer, Hannu from ancient Egypt, made the first recorded exploring expedition by sail around 2750 BC and wrote his account of the exploration in stone.\n\n3000 BC: Evidence for the potter's wheel[3]. At first, this device was a simple turntable, but later evolved into a more elaborate device. These potter's wheels were hand turned and the kick wheel variety was probably not developed until the Persian or Ptolemaic periods, although there is some disagreement among Egyptologists on this matter. The potter's wheel also spurred the development of more refined kilns. The Potter's wheel allowed pottery to be made in greater abundance.\n\n1800 BC: The earliest known production of steel, as evidenced by pieces of ironware excavated from an archaeological site in Anatolia (Kaman-Kalehoyuk), dating from 1800 BC. The Roman poet Horace identified steel weapons like the falcata in the Iberian Peninsula, while Noric steel was later used by the Roman military.\n\n280 BC: The Pharos at Alexandria[4], the most famous lighthouse of the ancient world, is constructed around 280 BCE. It was built by Sostratus of Cnidus. The lighthouse stood in the harbor of Alexandria on the island of Pharos. It is believed it was more than 110 meters high, making it perhaps the second highest man-made structure at the time—the pyramids of Giza being the highest. The lighthouse was still standing in the 12th century, but was likely destroyed by an earthquake in the 1300s. In 1477 the Mamlūk sultan Qāʾit Bāy built a fort from its ruins.\n\n80 BC: Antikythera mechanism. The Antikythera mechanism, is an ancient mechanical computer designed to calculate astronomical positions. The device is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears. Its remains were found as 82 separate fragments, of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions. It was recovered in 1900–1901 from the Antikythera wreck. The construction has been dated to the early 1st century BCE. All known fragments of the Antikythera mechanism are kept at the National Archaeological Museum of Athens. The Antikythera mechanism was designated a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by ASME in 2019 (ASME Landmark number 271).[5]\n\nFirst Century\n\n1: Fire piston invented in Southeast Asia for starting fires, preceded the invention of the match. A fire piston, sometimes called a fire syringe or a slam rod fire starter, is a device of ancient Southeast Asian origin which is used to kindle fire. It uses the principle of the heating of a gas (in this case air) by rapid and adiabatic compression to ignite a piece of tinder, which is then used to set light to kindling.\n\n1: Fulling mills are in use, in which workers press fabric by foot. Fulling is a process that increases the thickness and compactness of woven or knitted wool by subjecting it to pressure, as well friction, moisture, and heat. (France)\n\n25: Hypocaust system for building heating used: charcoal furnaces with tile flues in walls. Excavations at Mohenjo-daro in what is now Pakistan have unearthed what is believed to be a hypocaust lined with bitumen-coated bricks. If it fulfilled a similar role, the structure would predate the earliest Roman hypocaust by as much as 2000 years. (Roman Empire and Asia, Europe, Japan, and China)\n\n50: Hero writes Pneumatic, which includes 75 devices that work on air, steam or water pressure, including the hydraulis or water organ and \"Mechanica\" which includes gear ratio, basic devices, and hoists. (Hero, Alexandria, Egypt)\n\n62: Aeolipile devised; a pure-reaction machine that can be called the first steam engine. (Hero, Alexandria, Egypt)\n\n70: Gaius Plinius Secundus aka Pliny the Elder publishes \"Naturalis Historia\". The work is divided into 37 books, organized into ten volumes. These cover topics including astronomy, mathematics, geography, ethnography, anthropology, human physiology, zoology, botany, agriculture, horticulture, pharmacology, mining, mineralogy, sculpture, painting, and precious stones. The Natural History became a model for later encyclopedias and scholarly works as a result of its breadth of subject matter, its referencing of original authors, and its index. (Pliny the Elder)\n\n80: Two-barreled reciprocating pump is first seen. The device was cut from a block of wood, lined with lead sheet (0409 ca). (Romans in Britain, Silchester)\n\nSecond Century\n\n105: Under the Han Dynasty emperor Ho-Ti, a government official in China named Ts'ai Lun was the first to start a papermaking industry. Ts'ai Lun seems to have made his paper by mixing finely chopped mulberry bark and hemp rags with water, mashing it flat, and then pressing out the water and letting it dry in the sun. However, the discovery of specimens bearing written Chinese characters in 2006 at Fangmatan in north-east China's Gansu Province suggest that paper was in use by the ancient Chinese military more than 100 years before Cai, in 8 BC, and possibly much earlier as the map fragment found at the Fangmatan tomb site dates from 179–41 BC. See history of paper, subheading techniques. (Tshai Lun, China)\n\n132: Seismograph built; it incorporated an inverted pendulum.[6] It was cylindrical in shape with eight dragon heads arranged around its upper circumference, each with a ball in its mouth. Around the lower circumference were eight frogs, each directly under a dragon head. When an earthquake occurred, one of the balls was released from a dragon's mouth, probably by an internal pendulum, and was caught by a frog's mouth. (Chang Heng, China)\n\n180: Rotary fan first used for ventilation in China. The technology was not transferred to west until 1556. (China)\n\nThird Century\n\n200: Archaeological evidence indicates the earliest wheelbarrows were in use around year 200 in the form of a one-wheeled cart. Depicted in 2nd century Han Dynasty Emperor Hui's tomb murals and brick tomb reliefs. The painted tomb mural of a man pushing a wheelbarrow was found in a tomb at Chengdu, Sichuan province, dated precisely to 118 AD. See Wheelbarrow#Ancient China for additional information. (China)\n\n200: A Roman iron crankshaft of yet unknown purpose dating to the 2nd century AD was excavated in Augusta Raurica, Switzerland. The Roman Hierapolis sawmill from the 3rd century AD saw the earliest known machine to combine a crank with a connecting rod. The earliest evidence, anywhere in the world, for a crank and connecting rod in a machine appears in the late Roman Hierapolis sawmill from the 3rd century AD and two Roman stone sawmills at Gerasa, Roman Syria, and Ephesus, Asia Minor. (both 6th century AD)\n\nFourth Century\n\n300: The water wheel is recognized as a prime mover in Western Europe for diverse applications. However, the waterwheel dates back to the 3rd Century BC in Ancient Byzantium and in Alexandria.\n\n315: The Barbegal Aqueduct and mill complex is built. It was a Roman watermill complex located on the territory of the commune of Fontvieille, near the town of Arles, in southern France. The mill had 16 waterwheels arranged in two descending columns built into the hillside. The site shows evidence of foundations of the individual mills, along with the water channels. The capacity of the mills was calculated in terms of the amount of flour that could be milled—recorded at 4.5 tons of flour per day. [7] (Barbegal, France)\n\n370: Ship propelled by paddle wheels and a number of fanciful war machines were suggested by unknown Latin author of de Rubus Bellicus.\n\nFifth Century\n\n400: Wind-driven prayer wheels were written of by a Chinese pilgrim around 400 C.E. in Ladakh. (China)\n\n400: Windmills appear in Chinese writings and in Islam for Caliph Omar I. The authenticity of the windmill involving the second caliph Umar (AD 634–644) is questioned on the grounds that it appears in a tenth-century document. Furthermore while it was probably invented much earlier, the earliest recorded use found by archeologists in China is a.d. 1219 (Asia)\n\n400: A Roman edict is issued to protect watermills, indicating that they were in existence and valued. (Romans, Europe)\n\n400: Double-piston bellows for continuous blast used. (China)\n\n400: Mineral oil used as lubricant: Chinese work refers to its use (difficult to be certain about earlier references). (China)\n\n438: \"Senchus Mor\" written, followed by \"Book of Aicill\". The writings describe Irish code on mills, including horizontal waterwheels. (Ireland)\n\nSixth Century\n\n500: Earliest specimens of fabric produced using a draw loom in western world date from this century. Fabric looms for appear to have been originally developed in East Asia for silk weaving, unknown date. (Egypt)\n\nSeventh Century\n\n644: The Persians build a pumping machine powered by the wind. The Persian windmill was invented sometime around 700–900 AD. This design was the panemone windmill, with vertical lightweight wooden sails attached by horizontal struts to a central vertical shaft. It was first built to pump water, and subsequently modified to grind grain as well. Wind-powered machines may have been known earlier, but there is no clear evidence of windmills prior to the 9th century.\n\nEighth Century\n\n725: Evidence of escapement mechanism devised in China to regulate oscillation of clock hands. Not introduced in the Western World until 1759. (I Hing, China)\n\nNinth Century\n\n800–900: Evidence of a plow with curved iron board (concave) being used to guide and turn over heavy clay soil in a continuous-ribbon motion: 9th century in China. Not introduced in Europe until 1300–1700. The principle was later used for wrapping and folding for machinery. (China)\n\n830: Crank mentioned on Utrecht Psalter. It was used with a rotary grindstone. (Western world)\n\n833: Windmills begin to be introduced into Germany. (Germany)\n\nTenth Century\n\n985: Hand crank is in use on an organistrum in northern Spain as an instrument used for singing instruction in monastic settings. It produces sound by a crank-turned, rosined wheel rubbing against the strings. (Also known as a 'hurdy gurdy').\n\nEleventh Century\n\n1000: Geared astrolabe designed with calendrical gearing: earliest record of complicated gear relating to a clock. (al Biruni)\n\n1041: Movable type introduced in China. The system was made of Chinese porcelain and clay. The length of clay movable types in China was 1 to 2 centimeters. (Pi Sheng, China)\n\n1086: Domesday Book lists 5,624 mills. The mills in use at that time were probably driven by a mix of primitive vertical and horizontal watermills. (Britain)\n\n1088: Su Sung escapement mechanism uses a trip lever and scoop wheel for clock towers. The action of the escapement's arrest and release was achieved by gravity exerted periodically as the continuous flow of liquid filled containers of a limited size. In a single line of evolution, Su Song's clock therefore united the concept of the 'clepsydra' and the mechanical clock into one device run by mechanics and hydraulics. (Su Sung, China) (Note: A detailed model exists at Gishodo Suwako Watch and Clock Museum, in Suwa City, Nagano Prefecture)\n\nTwelfth Century\n\n1100: Evidence of forge bellows with wooden boards and leather flap-valves introduced in Britain. (Britain)\n\n1105: Windmills introduced into France. (France)\n\n1150: Stamp mill used in papermaking (not mentioned by L7) (E9 says 1144, Spain). (Italy)\n\n1150: Floating mills on the Seine in Paris depicted. (Paris)\n\n1170: Tide mill reported at Woodbridge, Suffolk. The Woodbridge Tide Mill still operates at the site as a tourist attraction. A tide mill is a water mill driven by tidal rise and fall. A dam with a sluice is created across a suitable tidal inlet, or a section of river estuary is made into a reservoir. As the tide comes in, it enters the mill pond through a one way gate, and this gate closes automatically when the tide begins to fall. When the tide is low enough, the stored water can be released to turn a water wheel. During 1950s it had become the last working tide mill in the country before being closed in 1957 restored in 1968. The first recording of a tide mill on this site was a medieval mill in 1170 but the present surviving tide mill was actually built in 1793. Its machinery reflects the skills and achievements of the early Industrial Revolution.[8] (Britain)\n\n1180: Earliest mention of western windmill; Abbey of Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte. (Normandy)\n\n1185: Earliest records of fulling mills in England, at Newsham (Yorkshire) and Barton. (Britain)\n\n1185: Post windmill appears in Europe. The first recorded use of a post windmill occurs in 1185 in Yorkshire.\n\n1195: Arab treatise by Fakhr ad-din Ridwan b. Muhammad on great automaton water clocks. (Ridwan)\n\nThirteenth Century\n\n1200: Stone stove heating system with chimney flue and slide damper used in German castles. (Germany)\n\n1200: Horizontal bench lathe appears, using foot treadle to rotate object.\n\n1200: Cog ship (single-masted merchant ships) built for northern trade. The transformation of the cog into a true seagoing trader came not only during the time of the intense trade between West and East, but also as a direct answer to the closure of the western entrance to the Limfjord. The need for spacious and relatively inexpensive ships led to the development of the first workhorse of the Hanseatic League, the cog. The new and improved cog could cross even the most dangerous passages. (Europe)\n\n1221: Astrolabe: oldest geared machine (in complete state) in existence; signed and dated. (Muhamad b. Abi Bakr, Isfahan, Persia)\n\n1225: Water-driven machinery recorded: sketches of sawmills, including spring motion. (Villard de Honnecourt, medieval Europe)\n\n1250: Primitive rope escapement for clocks illustrated in \"Album\" by Villard de Honnecourt.\n\n1256: 'Five Books of Clocks' in \"Libros del Saber de Astronomia\": on water clocks is published. (King Alfonso X of Castile)\n\n1280: The spinning wheel is illustrated for the first time (in known history). It was a primitive, spindle-on-an-axle type. (Europe)\n\nFourteenth Century\n\n1300: Iron manufacture begins to use blowing furnaces driven by water power. (Britain)\n\n1304: The mechanical clock first emerged during the 14th century using the verge and foliot mechanism. The foliot is a horizontal bar with weights on either end. It sits on a vertical rod, called a verge. The verge has pallets to engage and release the main gear which is turned by a heavy stone on the end of a cable. The verge nudges the foliot back and forth in an inertial rhythm, and that determines the pace of the gear train. The first clear drawing of an escapement was given by Jacopo di Dondi and his son in 1364; they may have been building clocks for twenty years by then. The Heinrich von Wieck clock in Paris dating from 1362 is the first clock of which it is known with certainty that it had a foliot and a verge escapement. The clock at Graggenturm in Luzern, Switzerland, from 1385, was the first with written operating instructions. See Wikipedia article on the Turret Clock.Turret clock\n\n1322: Evidence of the sawmill invented (Domesday Book mentions sawmills in 1076—H5). (Europe)\n\n1350: Windmill-driven scoop wheel developed. (France)\n\n1361: Noria al-Muhammadiyya is placed in service. Hama-3 norias It has a diameter of 21 meters (69 feet), making it among the largest water wheels ever constructed. (Note: The word noria means a device for raising water. Noria finds its origin in the Arabic word \"naurah\". This word is used in Syria for a water wheel and literally means \"the wailer\" after the noise that the wooden bearing must have made.) It is located in the city of Hama, Syria, where a set of seventeen large water wheels continues to operate on the River Orontes as they have for many centuries. It was designated a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by ASME. The landmark plaque notes that its \"very existence today serves as a lasting testimony to engineering ingenuity in the ancient Arab world and to the central role of technology in creating and sustaining such sophisticated civilizations\". [9]\n\n1386: Salisbury clock with crank mechanism is invented. Dating from about 1386, it is one of the oldest working clocks in the world. It has been relocated in the London Science Museum, where it continues to operate. (Britain)\n\nFifteenth Century\n\n1400: Holland adapts the windmill for large-scale drainage (1439 for grinding grain – Q9). (Dutch, Holland) Reflected by Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmarks Nos. 151 and 161 (Victoria Dutch Windmill [10] and Old Mill in Nantucket [11].\n\n1400: Rapid evolution of full-rigged ship from a one-mast cog with square sail to four-mast galleon with bowsprit. Eventually, around the 14th century, the cog reached its structural limits, resulting in the desperate need for a quick replacement. The replacement, the hulk, already existed but awaited reconditioning. Although there is no evidence that hulks descended from the cogs, it is clear that a lot of technological ideas were adapted from one to the other and vice versa. By 1528, documentary sources point to a new type of ship called the Galleon which was used by the Venetians against pirates.[12] (Atlantic Ocean)\n\n1400: Improved loom advances weaving of elaborate silk fabrics.[13] On this loom, loops were tied around the tail cords, and those that would be pulled to open each figure shed were knotted together. A cord tied to this knot passed through holes in another board and terminated in a button that prevented the cord from slipping back. To open each figure shed, the weaver simply pulled the buttons in the prearranged order. It would be universally adopted across Europe during the 5th century.[14] (John the Calabrian)\n\n1400: Flywheel recorded as a machine in 15th-century manuscript.\n\n1421: German manuscript depicts early crank and connecting rod system. (Munich)\n\n1430: Spring drive introduced into mechanical clock. (Europe) (Note: Spring-driven clocks appeared during the 15th century, although they are often erroneously credited to Nuremberg watchmaker Peter Henlein (or Henle, or Hele) around 1511. The earliest existing spring driven clock is the chamber clock given to Phillip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, around 1430, now in the Germanisches National museum. Spring power presented clockmakers with a new problem: how to keep the clock movement running at a constant rate as the spring ran down. This resulted in the invention of the stackfreed and the fusee in the 15th century, and many other innovations.)\n\n1435: Ship called 'Scraper' dredges harbor channel. (Dutch, Maiddelburg)\n\n1440: Earliest evidence of block book, \"Spirituale Pomerium\": block-printed wood cuts. (Brussels)\n\n1441: First rain gauge: to measure precipitation with precision, for agricultural purposes. As the trend towards continuous farming grew, King Sejong was keen to determine the levels of rain which were falling in the various parts of his kingdom. In 1441, a more precise method for measuring precipitation was invented with the rain gauge, a milestone in the history of meteorology. The new metallic, circular gauge was an invention of Yi Chon. Measuring 42.5cm in height and 17cm in diameter, it was the first device in the world capable of measuring levels of rainfall accurately, preceding Benedetto Castelli's pluviometer by almost 200 years.\n\n1448: Gutenberg printing press developed for Mainz printing office. It used movable and reusable type. Johannes Gutenberg's work on the printing press began in approximately 1436 when he partnered with Andreas Dritzehn—a man who had previously instructed in gem-cutting—and Andreas Heilmann, owner of a paper mill. A 1439 lawsuit against Gutenberg shows an official record of witnesses' testimony discussing Gutenberg's types, an inventory of metals (including lead), and his type molds. He was the first to make type from an alloy of lead, tin, and antimony, which was critical for producing durable type that produced high-quality printed books and proved to be much better suited for printing than all other known materials. Gutenberg is also credited with the introduction of an oil-based ink which was more durable than the previously used water-based inks. In 1454 Gutenberg put his press to commercial use, printing thousands of indulgences for the Church. The following year he printed his famous 42-line Bible, the first book ever printed on a moveable type printing press. It should be noted that Gutenberg technically did not invent the printing press. Chinese and Korean inventors had been using the printing press for centuries before Gutenberg (Gutenberg, Fust, Europe) Designated a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by ASME (No. 269) in 2019.[15]\n\n1450: Instrument making at Nuremberg: observatory, machine shop, and printing plant built. It was the first permanent European observatory (Johann Muller (Regiomontanus), Germany)\n\n1450: Blast furnaces with water-driven bellows (1340, H2) first used. (Rhine Valley)\n\n1480: Continuous rotary action analyzed: especially friction, motion, and power. (Leonardo da Vinci, Italy)\n\n1485: Evidence of vertical grinding wheel with treadle and crank.\n\n1487: Earliest surviving evidence of application of numerical reasoning to water-power technology in Leonardo da Vinci notebooks. It contains notes and diagrams for devices relating to hydraulic engineering and on the moving and raising of water. Some of the ideas recorded investigate perpetual motion. (Codex Forster)\n\n1488: Leonardo da Vinci conceives of flying machines, creating over 100 sketches to illustrate his ideas. He learned by imitating the way birds glide was more practical that than human powered wing motion for a sustained flight for any extended period. However, he had designed winged gliders exclusively by and for human use in mind. (Paris Manuscripts and Codex on the Flight of Birds)\n\n1490: First stove of record produced: brick and tile. (Alsace, France)\n\n1490: Leonardo da Vinci's Codex Madrid (discovered in 1960s).[16] The two notebooks contain 197 pages, with the first volume largely discussing mechanics, statics, and geometry. The notebooks, in his handwriting, outlined engineering ideas that were unheard of at the time. Among other mechanics, the notebooks include da Vinci's thoughts on improved ball bearings, worm gears, and bicycle chain drives. (Leonardo da Vinci)\n\n1491: Blast furnace introduced into Britain. The oldest extant blast furnaces were built during the Han Dynasty of China in the 1st century BC.Blast furnace#Origin and spread of early modern blast furnaces The Weald of Sussex was where the first furnace called Queenstock in Buxted was introduced in Britain built in about 1491. It followed by one at Newbridge in Ashdown Forest in 1496. They remained few in number until about 1530 but many were built in the following decades in the Weald, where the iron industry perhaps reached its peak about 1590.\n\nSixteenth Century\n\n1500: Wheellock invented in Italy. It is a friction-wheel mechanism to cause a spark for firing a firearm. It was the next major development in firearms technology after the matchlock and the first self-igniting firearm. Drawings made by Leonardo of a wheellock mechanism date from either the mid-1490s or the early 1500s. However, a drawing from a book of German inventions dated 1505 and a 1507 reference to the purchase of a wheellock in Austria may indicate the inventor was an unknown German mechanic instead. (Italy)\n\n1500: Leather foot bellows used by Egyptians (earliest mechanical air pump in west is blowpipe).\n\n1500: Tinplate. Tin-coated vessels are known to have existed as early as 23 A.D., but the tin was apparently only used for decoration. The first tinplate appears to have been made in Bavaria in the fourteenth century, and by the sixteenth century, a thriving tinplate industry existed in Saxony and Bohemia. Tinplate manufacture spread to England in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. (Europe)\n\n1500: Mitre-gate pound locks. The development of the mitre lock, a double-leaf gate the closure of which formed an angle pointing upstream, heralded a period of extensive canal construction during the 16th and 17th centuries. The canals and canalized rivers of that period foreshadowed the European network to be developed over many years. (Italy, Spain, Portugal)\n\n1500: Clear glass produced in large beehive furnaces fired by charcoal. (Europe), although Romano-Alexandria was producing clear glass works since 1st century BC. By the 11th century, clear glass mirrors were being produced in Arab Islamic Spain.\n\n1500: Large undershot waterwheels used to drive pumps for water supply: later erected in Paris and London. In India and Asia Minor, wheels of this kind were used for irrigation in pre-Christian times. The Franconian waterwheels have been built along almost the same lines for over 500 years. Of the 200 wheels on the Regnitz, 12 still remain in 1985 as technical monuments. (Germany)\n\n1505: Original Nuremberg watches: spring driven clocks with single hand. Production was made possible by the miniaturization of the torsion pendulum and coil spring mechanism by Nuremberg clockmaker. It is known that he first succeeded in producing a portable clock in 1510, and his contributions were clearly instrumental in giving rise to the later Nuremberg \"neck-watch\" industry (Peter Henlein, Nuremberg, Germany)\n\n1511: Bellows pump demonstrated. (Vegetius)\n\n1523: Earliest record of steelworks in Britain. (Britain)\n\n1530: Foot-driven spinning wheel. A citizen of Brunswick</ref> is said to have added a treadle, by which the spinner could rotate her spindle with one foot and have both hands free to spin. Leonardo da Vinci drew a picture of the flyer, which twists the yarn before winding it onto the spindle. During the 16th century a treadle wheel with flyer was in common use, and gained such names as the Saxony wheel and the flax wheel. It sped up production, as one needn't stop spinning to wind up the yarn.\n\n1534: Ball thrust bearing introduced: free wheeling and made of wood. In 1534 The King of France commissioned a Florentine goldsmith to produce a statue of Jupiter about 1.4 meters (4 1/2 ft) high. He describes his ball bearing stating \"I placed it upon a wooden socle, and within that socle I fixed four little globes of wood which were more than half hidden in their sockets.\" See History of Ball Bearings.[17] (Benvenuto Cellini, Italy)\n\n1539: Molds made for casting lead pipe. It consisted of casting the lead pipes complete in short lengths in molds placed in perpendicular position. After a number were cast, they were united together in a separate mold by pouring hot metal over the ends until they were a single long piece. Allowed for the conveyance of water through pipes.[18] (Robert Broke, England)\n\n1540–1546: In Book VI of the De re metallica, Georgius Agricola extensively illustrated and describes the tools and machinery associated with mining during the era, including details of various kinds of machines for lifting weights. Some of these are man-powered and some powered by up to four horses or by waterwheels. Horizontal driveshafts along tunnels allow lifting in shafts not directly connected to the surface. If this is not possible treadmills will be installed underground. Instead of lifting weights, similar machines use chains of buckets to lift water. Agricola also describes several designs of piston force pumps which are either man or animal powered or powered by waterwheels. Because these pumps can only lift water about 24 feet, batteries of pumps are required for the deepest mines. Water pipe designs are also covered in this section. Designs of wind scoop for ventilating shafts or forced air using fans or bellows are also described. Finally ladders and lifts using wicker cages are used to get miners up and down shafts. This text along with his other works compose the earliest comprehensive \"scientific\" approach to mineralogy, mining, and geological science. Georgius Agricola, Germany)\n\n1540: Biringuccio's Pirotecnia on metallurgy and machine tools.[19] The work was printed in Venice, and has been reprinted numerous times. It is divided into ten books dealing with minerals, semi-minerals, assaying, smelting, the separation of gold from silver, alloys, the art of casting metals (especially bells and cannons), and alchemy. He describes in detail the way moulds are made for casting so as to avoid defects, including the way patterns are made for the final product shape. (Biringuccio)\n\n1550: Universal joint described in physics treatise: de Subtilitate (1550) and de Rerum (1557) by Geronimo Cardano.[20] Cardano studied the inclined plane and the lever and described other mechanical devices. as well as hydrodynamics. (Geronimo Cardano, Italy)\n\n1552: Iron rolling machine is developed. (Brulier)\n\n1561: Baldewin's astronomical clock was built for Landgraf William IV of Hesse. In this instance the calculations for the clock were made by the Landgraf and his Astronomer, Andreas Schoener. Dials were provided for Mars, Venus, Mercury (planet), Saturn, Jupiter, the Earth's Moon, ar Astrolabe and one for the calendar dial. On the top of the clock a celestial globe was mounted.[21] (Baldewin)\n\n1562: Dredgers of the Chinese chain-pump type used in Low Countries. (Germany)\n\n1568: Simple mandrel lathe shown on a woodcut of the \"Panoplia Omnium\" by Hartman Schopper.\n\n1571: Improved (screw) lathe described in Theatrum Instrumentorum; tool held rigidly and moved axially forward by lead screw. Theatrum Instrumentorum was a collection of Jacques Besson's own new inventions with detailed illustrations of each engraved by Jacques Androuet du Cerceau to his specifications. Some of his designs suggested important improvements to lathes and the ppwaterwheel. (Jacques Besson, France)\n\n1571: Instruments Mathematiques et Mechaniques shows math concepts applied to machines. (France, Geneva)\n\n1582: Undershot tide-mill pumps installed in London</ref> water system. The three waterwheels worked a total of 52 water pumps; the wheels could turn in either direction and so be driven by the flowing and ebbing tide; and the pumps were designed to force 132,120 gallons an hour to a height of 120 feet. The machinery was largely destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666 but replacements engineered by Morice's grandson remained under the bridge until the early 19th century, before the New London Bridge was erected in the 1830s. (London Bridge Waterworks established). (Morice (Dutch), Britain)\n\n1584: First British water closet or as it is known today, the toilet, is invented by Sir John Harington. The water-closet had a pan with an opening at the bottom, sealed with a leather-faced valve. A system of handles, levers and weights poured in water from a cistern, and opened the valve. (John Harrington, Britain)\n\n1586: Claude Dangon, a French weaver in Lyons, made improvements on the draw loom by refining the shedding mehanismuse forbidden according to legend thus inventing the lever draw-loom. The number of lashes on the loom could be increased from 800 to 2400. Though it was not successful, the principles exemplified were later applied to multi-shuttle looms. Other weavers were said to have made improvements including Anton Moller of Danzig who is said to have made a similar improvement but forbade it's use.[22] (Dangon, France) (Moller, Danzig)\n\n1588: Rotary pumps were described by Ramelli, in \"Le diverse et artificiose machine del Capitano Agostino Ramelli\", (The various and ingenious machines of Captain Agostino Ramelli) too difficult to make before 16th century due to manufacturing accuracy, sealing and pipeline problems.[23]\n\n1588: Internal workings of western windmill depicted: includes a chain-pump in a tower mill. (Agostino Ramelli, Lyons)\n\n1589: An English clergyman and inventor, William Lee Britain devised the first stocking frame knitting machine which remained the only one in use for centuries. Its principle of operation remains in use. His first machine produced a coarse wool, for stockings. Refused a patent by Queen Elizabeth I, he built an improved machine that increased the number of needles per inch from 8 to 20 and produced a silk of finer texture, but the queen again denied him a patent because of her concern for the employment security of the kingdom's many hand knitters whose livelihood might be threatened by such mechanization. Eventually, he moved to France with his brother James, taking 9 workmen and 9 frames. He found better support from the Hugenot Henry IV of France, who granted him a patent. Lee began stocking manufacture in Rouen, France. (William Lee Britain, Britain and France)\n\n1590: Galileo Galilei of Italy shows that a load supported by cantilevered beam can be calculated as step toward studying strength of materials. (Note: The discovery of The Codex Madrid in the National Library of Spain in 1967 found that Leonardo da Vinci's work in 1493 preceded Galileo's by over 100 years and also correctly identified the stress and strain distribution across a section in bending.) (Galileo Galilei, Italy)\n\n1590: Updated analysis of simple machines and treatise on statics (Guidobaldo also called Guido Ubaldi). (Guidobaldo de Monte, Italy)\n\n1590: \"On Mills\" published by Simon Stevin: gives mathematical theory to scoop wheel improvements to raise water; first use of theory to analyze wind-powered, water-lifting devices. Suggested improvements including ideas that the wheels should move slowly with a better system for meshing of the gear teeth. These improved the efficiency of the windmills used in pumping water out of the polders by three times. Stevin received a patent on his innovation in 1586. (Simon Stevin, Holland)\n\n1593: Open, air-expansion thermoscope developed by Galileo Galilei of Italy: forerunner of thermometer, for comparing temperatures. The device was built from a small vase filled with water, attached to a thin vertically rising pipe, with a large empty glass ball at the top. Changes in temperature of the upper ball would exert positive or vacuum pressure on the water below, causing it to rise or lower in the thin column. Based on the principles of buoyancy, temperature effects on fluids, density and floating objects. (Galileo Galilei, Italy)\n\n1594: The wind-powered sawmill is invented, which made the conversion of log timber into planks 30 times faster than before. It used a crankshaft to convert a windmill's circular motion into a back-and-forward motion powering the saw. The sawmill \"\"Het Juffertje\"\" soon developed into a more advanced version, a type known today as the paltrokmolen (post mill), which played a key part in the economic success of the Dutch Republic during the Dutch Golden Age in the 17th century by enabling the mass construction of ships for overseas trade. The mill turned the Zaan district, north of Amsterdam, into the world's first industrial area. (Cornelis Corneliszoon van Uitgeest, Netherlands)\n\nSeventeenth Century\n\n1600: Evidence of gear pump in use, although it initially had no effect on the development of hydraulics until Blaise Pascal laid the foundations for the further development of hydraulics with the \"hydrostatic law\" (Kepler)\n\n1600: Rag-and-chain pump used to drain Cornish mines. Rag and chain pumps were constructed from a series of interconnecting wooden pipes, made from hollowed out logs that reached all the way down to the lowest point of the mine. An endless chain (looped so it could be continuously pulled round and round) with balls of rags attached at intervals was pulled up through the pipe, drawing the water up with it in a continual flow. (Britain)\n\n1604: Ribbon frames patented in Europe. Mechanization of ribbon weaving and twining. Allowed a single worker to weave twelve ribbons at a time and were widely used in the Haarlem linen industry in the 1660s.[24] The Dutch called this engine lintmolen or \"ribbon mill\" (Willem Dierickzoon van Sonnevelt, France)\n\n1606: Giambattista della Porta describes a method to move water by vacuum created when steam condenses: concept proved in laboratory and described in de' spiritali. It would later prove to be the foundation of the steam engine. (Giambattista della Porta, Italy)\n\n1608: Practical refracting telescope invented by Hans Lippershey, called a 'kijker' (Dutch), later known as binoculars. This device achieved a 3X magnification. The patent was filed in 1608 but never granted since the same claim for invention had also been made by other spectacle-makers. (Hans Lippershey, Germany, Netherlands)\n\n1610: Temperature regulator developed: later called a thermostat; initially used for scientific laboratory experiments. Used a column of mercury and a system of floats and levers to maintain a steady temperature within a furnace. (Cornelis Drebbel, Dutch)\n\n1614: Cementation steel process patented by Ellyott and Meysey. While they did receive the British patent, they were not the actual inventors. (Ellyott and Meysey, Britain). The process was described in a treatise published in Prague in 1574. It was again invented by Johann Nussbaum of Magdeburg, who began operations at Nuremberg in 1601.\n\n1619: Experiments to forge pig iron using coal-fired furnace begin: also many have used coke. (Dud Dudley, Britain)\n\n1620: First successful submarine developed by Cornelius van Drebbel. His human-powered submersible was successfully demonstrated in 1624 on the Thames River. (Britain)\n\n1623: Automatic multiplying and subtracting machine devised. In two letters that he sent to Kepler, Wilhelm Schickard reported his design and construction of what he referred to as an \"arithmeticum organum\" that he has invented, but which would later be described as a Rechenuhr (calculating clock). The machine was designed to assist in all the four basic functions of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The machine could add and subtract six-digit numbers, and indicated an overflow of this capacity by ringing a bell. The adding machine in the base was primarily provided to assist in the difficult task of adding or multiplying two multi-digit numbers. In the 1950s, scholars who were collecting the works of Kepler found tucked into a book Schickard's original drawings of his device. This made it possible for Professor Bruno Baron von Freytag Loringhoff of the University of Tübingen to reconstruct Schickard's calculator. (Wilhelm Schickard, Tubingen, Germany)\n\n1629: Giovanni Branca describes water-operated pumps of direct air-pressure type; also described form of impulse steam turbine. (Giovanni Branca, Italy)\n\n1630: William Oughtred of Cambridge invented a circular slide rule, and in 1632 combined two handheld Gunter rules to make a device that is recognizably the modern slide rule. Used primarily for multiplication and division, and also for functions such as roots, logarithms and trigonometry. (William Oughtred)\n\n1630: Auxiliary, or vernier, scale invented. The vernier, dial, and digital calipers give a direct reading of the distance measured with high accuracy and precision. They are functionally identical, with different ways of reading the result. These calipers comprise a calibrated scale with a fixed jaw, and another jaw, with a pointer, that slides along the scale. (Pierre Vernier, France)\n\n1635: Gearwheel pump illustrated by Schwenter. (Schwenter)\n\n1638: Galileo demonstrates parabolic trajectory: based on fundamental laws of motion (on mechanics). (Galileo Galilei, Italy)\n\n1639: Castelli's cylindrical rain gauge. (Castelli)\n\n1640: Screw caliper devised, used with telescope: later improved by Maudslay as micrometer. It was used in a telescope to measure angular distances between stars and the relative sizes of celestial objects. (Wm Gascoigne, Britain)\n\n1642: First manufactured cast-iron stove produced. This stove had no grates and was little more than a cast-iron box. (Lynn, Mass)\n\n1642: Blaise Pascal designed and began work on his calculator at the age of 19 to help his father who was a tax commissioner by building a device that would reduce some of his workload. It was the only operational mechanical calculator in the 17th century. The Pasaline was the first calculating machine to be made public, to have a controlled carry mechanism which allowed for an effective propagation of multiple carries, to be used in an office, to be commercialized, to be patented and to be sold by a distributor.Of the 9 surviving Pasalines, 4 exist at the CNAM museum in Paris and 2 at the musée Henri Lecoq. Supposedly, one also still exists at the IBM collection in the U.S. (Blaise Pascal, France)\n\n1643: Mercury barometer invented; a tube approximately one meter long and sealed at the top was filled it with mercury, and set vertically into a basin of mercury. The column of mercury fell to about 76 cm, leaving a Torricellian vacuum above. The column's height fluctuated with changing atmospheric pressure (Evangelista Torricelli, Italy)\n\n1647: Experiments on fluid forces involving syphons, bellows, and tubes published. Blaise Pascal produced Experiences nouvelles touchant le vide, (\"New Experiments with the Vacuum\"), which detailed basic rules describing to what degree various liquids could be supported by air pressure. It also provided reasons why it was indeed a vacuum above the column of liquid in a barometer tube. (Blaise Pascal, France)\n\n1647: Saugus Iron Works produces pig iron and wrought iron by puddling, first in US. Designated a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by ASME; Landmark No. 7 in 1975.'[25]\n\n1650: Horse-powered cog-and-rung gin invented to raise coal from mine shaft. The wallower was turned by means of a wooden gear mechanism, driven by a horse. A double ended rope, each end being attached to a basket (corve), was used for lifting the coal. One basket descended as the other ascended. After each lift the horse was turned and driven in the opposite direction. The size and placement of the mechanism limited the overall operational efficiency of this type of gin. Cog and rung gins were widely used in mine shafts during the 18th century to bring coal to the surface using a wooden gear mechanism driven by a horse that used a double ended rope to lift baskets up and down the mine shaft. A full scale model currently exists at Middleton Park in West Yorkshire, England (improved by Whim Gin).\n\n1650: Machine-bored pump barrels used, mostly later in century; flanged and bolted pipes used. (Bate, Britain)\n\n1652: Air (vacuum) pump devised: steadily improved upon later. Consisted of a piston and an air gun cylinder with two-way flaps designed to pull air out of whatever vessel it was connected to, and used to investigate the properties of the vacuum in many experiments. This pump is described in Chapters II and III of Book III of the Experimenta Nova and in the Mechanica Hydraulico-pneumatica (p. 445-6).(Otto von Guericke)\n\n1655: High-resolution telescope invented: followed lens grinding process development. Designed in 1662 the Huygenian eyepiece, with two lenses, as a telescope ocular.Would later help Huygens study the rings of Saturn and discober its moon Titan.(Christiaan Huygens, The Hague, Netherlands)\n\n1655 Epicycloidal profile for gear-wheel teeth developed. A system for raising water was installed near Paris. It was based on the use of the at the time unrecognized principle of the epicycloidal wheel (Gerard Desargues)\n\n1655: Air pump experiments conducted. Ended up creating the first British vacuum pump which was an improvement on Otto von Guericke's original vacuum pump from 1652. Boyle used the pump extensively in his early work, making discoveries such as that sound does not travel in a vacuum and that air is necessary to sustain a candle flame. (Boyle and Hooke)\n\n1656: Pendulum-regulated clock built: 1675 balance wheel and spring oscillator, reliable accuracy, and precision gearing. The introduction of the pendulum, the first harmonic oscillator used in timekeeping, increased the accuracy of clocks enormously, from about 15 minutes per day to 15 seconds per day. These early clocks, due to their verge escapements, had wide pendulum swings of up to 100°. The Horologium Oscillatorium showed that wide swings made the pendulum inaccurate, causing its period, and thus the rate of the clock, to vary with unavoidable variations in the driving force provided by the movement. The realization that only pendulums with small swings of a few degrees are isochronous motivated the invention of the anchor escapement around 1670, which reduced the pendulum's swing to 4°-6°. The anchor became the standard escapement used in pendulum clocks. In addition to increased accuracy, the anchor's narrow pendulum swing allowed the clock's case to accommodate longer, slower pendulums, which needed less power and caused less wear on the movement. The increased accuracy resulting from these developments caused the minute hand, previously rare, to be added to clock faces beginning around 1690. (Christiaan Huygens, Netherlands)\n\n1657: Public demonstration to overcome vacuum: trial of two-horse teams pulling in opposite directions cannot overcome air pressure. (Otto von Guericke, Magdeburg, Germany)\n\n1660: Modern thermometer, also known as the Galileo thermometer was developed by the Florentine Accademia del Cimento. The Galilean thermometer works on the principle of buoyancy. Details of the thermometer were published in the Saggi di naturali esperienze fatte nell'Academia del Cimento sotto la protezione del Serenissimo Principe Leopoldo di Toscana e descritte dal segretario di essa Accademia (1666), the Academy's main publication. It was revived in the modern era by the Natural History Museum, London, which started selling a version in the 1990s.(Italy)\n\n1660: Effective balance spring for marine clock devised: Hautefeuille and Huygens also claim. In the process, Hooke demonstrated a pocket-watch of his own devising, fitted with a coil spring attached to the arbour of the balance. For the first time it is possible to make a watch which is reasonably accurate and slim. In February 2006, a long-lost copy of Hooke's handwritten notes from several decades of Royal Society meetings was discovered in a cupboard in Hampshire, England. The evidence contained in those notes seems to settle in favour of Hooke's claim.\n\n1661: Boyle's law of compression of gases expressed in DEFENSE AGAINST LINUS: volume of gas varies inversely as pressure.This law was the first physical law to be expressed in the form of an equation describing the dependence of two variable quantities. (Robt Boyle, Britain)\n\n1662: Water-driven boring mill with guided auger for pump logs illustrated. (Bockler, Britain)\n\n1663: Direct-steam 'water commanding' engine design devised by Marquis of Worcester. Constructed from the barrel of a cannon, it was an obvious prototype design for what would later become the steam engine, and clearly anticipated the power and applications of that machine.(Worcester, Britain)\n\n1665: Differential and integral calculus developed. Newton was the first to apply calculus to general physics and Leibniz developed much of the notation used in calculus today. The basic insights that both Newton and Leibniz provided were the laws of differentiation and integration, second and higher derivatives, and the notion of an approximating polynomial series. (Newton, Leibniz, and Takakazu)\n\n1666: Screw-type micrometer described and perfected.It was aspecialized eyepiece used in astronomical telescopes for astrometry measurements, in microscopes for specimen measurements, and in alignment and surveying telescopes for measuring angles and distances on nearby objects. (Adrien Auzout, France)\n\n1667: Robert Hooke likely invented the wind pressure gauge and improved bathometer, hygrometer, hydrometer, and barometer. (Robert Hooke, Royal Academy of London)\n\n1670: Highly efficient microscope developed: uses single lenses of high quality and short focal length. By placing the middle of a small rod of soda lime glass in a hot flame, Leeuwenhoek could pull the hot section apart to create two long whiskers of glass. Then, by reinserting the end of one whisker into the flame, he could create a very small, high-quality glass sphere. These spheres became the lenses of his microscopes, with the smallest spheres providing the highest magnifications. (Antonie van Leeuwenhock, Delft, Netherlands)\n\n1670: Rolled sheet lead made. (Hale, Britain)\n\n1671: Machine invented for cutting clock wheels by Robert Hooke: developed by 1784 into commercial availability. (Robert Hooke, Britain)\n\n1674: Morland's plunger pumps patented in an attempt to improve the water supply to Windsor Castle,: made in sizes up to 10-in-dia by Isaack Thomson (1675). (Moreland, Thomson, Britain)\n\n1674: Mechanical-calculator mechanism designed and construted (called a Stepped Reckoner): with stepped drum mechanism called the Leibniz wheel (which was designed in 1673 and used in calculators for the next 3 centuries until the mid-1970s). It was the first calculator that could perform all four arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Two prototypes were built; today only one survives in the National Library of Lower Saxony (Niedersächsische Landesbibliothek) in Hanover, Germany.(G Leibniz, Germany)\n\n1675: Marine chronometer built: driven by coiled spring, with verge escapement for regulation, instead of a pendulum, opening the way to marine chronometers and modern pocket watches and wristwatches. (Christiaan Huygens, Netherlands)\n\n1675: First spring-operated watch built: under Huygens' supervision. (Isaac Thuret, Netherlands)\n\n1675: Anchor escapement introduced by Robert Hooke: replaces verge and foliot. The escapement is a mechanism in a mechanical clock that maintains the swing of the pendulum by giving it a small push each swing, and allows the clock's wheels to advance a fixed amount with each swing, moving the clock's hands forward. (Clement disputes Hooke claim). (Robert Hooke, Europe)\n\n1675: Suction hose used in Amsterdam for fire engines.The forerunner of the modern fire hose was invented in 1672 in Amsterdam by Nicholas and Jan van der Heiden. Their discharge hose was made of leather with tightly sewn seams. Brass fittings were attached to each end to allow several sections to be coupled together. In 1698, they made a suction hose of heavy sailcloth coated with paint or cement to make it watertight. The hose was reinforced with internal metal rings to prevent it from collapsing under a vacuum.\n\n1676: Repeating clock invented. The rack and snail striking mechanism for striking clocks could easily be made to repeat the striking of the hour. Therefore it was used to construct repeater clocks, which at the pull of a string would strike the number of hours. Used to tell the time after dark before artificial illumination. (Edward Barlow, Britain)\n\n1675: Deadbeat escapement for mechanical clock developed by astronomer Richard Towneley and first used by Thomas Tompion in a clock built for Sir Jonas Moore. (Note: The deadbeat escapement is often erroneously credited to George Graham who introduced it around 1715 in his precision regulator clocks. Category: Timekeeping-Clockwork-Astrolabes\n\n1676: Robert Hooke's law of elasticity is developed; discusses material behavior with stress. The modern theory of elasticity generalizes Hooke's law to say that the strain (deformation) of an elastic object or material is proportional to the stress applied to it. (Britain)\n\n1677: Abbe Jean de Hautefeuille ignited gunpowder to create vacuum: pumps water from the Seine to supply the palace of Versailles. Unlike Huygen's engine below, did not consist of a piston and cylinder. (Hautefeuille)\n\n1678: Christiaan Huygens outlined a gunpowder engine consisting of a vertical tube containing a piston. Gunpowder was inserted into the tube and lit through a small hole at the base, like a cannon. The expanding gasses would drive the piston up the tube until the reached a point near the top. Here, the piston uncovered holes in the tube that allowed any remaining hot gasses to escape. The weight of the piston and the vacuum formed by the cooling gasses in the now-closed cylinder drew the piston back into the tube, lifting a test mass to provide power. He built an example of this gunpowder explosion-driven motor in 1678 or 1679.[26]\n\n1679: Steam digester invented: a high-pressure cooker that extracting fats from bones in a high-pressure steam environment, forerunner of autoclave, pressure valve invented to prevent explosions. (Denis Papin, London)\n\n1680: Simple centrifugal pump invented. (Jordan)\n\n1680: Lever safety valve devised for steam engine: The first safety valve was invented by Denis Papin for his steam digester (1679), an early pressure cooker rather than an engine.By using a \"steelyard\" lever a smaller weight was required, also the pressure could easily be regulated by sliding the same weight back and forth along the lever arm. Papin retained the same design for his 1707 steam pump.[27] that powered more than 250 pumps to bring water 500 ft (162 m) up a hillside from the Seine River to the Louveciennes Aqueduct. The chief engineer for the project was Arnold de Ville who contracted the master carpenter and mechanic Rennequin Sualem and his brother Paulus Sualem. The construction lasted 7 years and was inaugurated in the presence of the King in June 1684. It was considered a wonder of the world at the time, and may have been the largest system of integrated machinery ever assembled to that date. (Ranneguin, France)\n\n1685: Air compressing pump for high pressures for experiments invented. (Denis Papin, Britain)\n\n1687: Astronomia Europaea describes wheeled vehicle driven by steam turbine. (Ferdinand Verbiest, China)\n\n1687: Cast plate glassused a new pouring process that allowed it to make plate glass mirrors measuring at least 60 by 40 inches wide: Saint Gobain factory established at Tourlaville to make mirrors by Compagnie Thévart. (Nicolas du Noyer, France)\n\n1688: First reflecting telescope built: uses mirrors instead of lenses. Was a prototype for a design that later came to be called a newtonian telescope.The telescope also acted as proof for the theory that white light is composed of a spectrum of colours. The telescope used mirrors as the objective which bypass that problem of chromatic aberration .(Sir Isaac Newton, Britain)\n\n1689: Centrifugal pump, known as Hessian pump, described. Within a year of becoming a chair of mathematics at the University of Marburg, Papin invented the earliest form of centrifugal pump, which was used in local drainage work; he applied the same principle to the ventilation of a coal mine. Neither version was widely adopted. (Dennis Papin, Germany)\n\n1690: First demonstration of raising a piston using steam: considered early atmospheric engine. The purpose of the steam engine was to raise water to a canal between Kassel and Karlshaven. He also used a steam engine to pump water to a tank on the roof of the palace to supply water for the fountains in the grounds. (Denis Papin, England)\n\n1690: Master patent received 7/28/1698 for practical steam pump: 'fire engine' demonstrated in 1699 It was also the first commercially used steam powered engine.

The slide rest (as the earliest forms of carriage were known) can be traced to the fifteenth century. In 1718 the tool-supporting slide rest with a set of gears was introduced by a Russian inventor Andrey Nartov and had limited usage in the Russian industry. In the eighteenth century the slide rest was also used on French ornamental turning lathes. The suite of gun boring mills at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, in the 1780s by the Verbruggan family also had slide rests.

Category: Forging and Fabrication\n\n1721: Modern manual fire engine evolves from fire engine. The engine had two single-acting pistons and an air vessel placed in a tank which formed the frame of the machine. The pump was worked by people at the long cross handles. At the front of the engine, protected by a sheet of horn and a door, were directions for keeping the machine in order. The cistern could hold about 170 US gallons (640 L) of water pumping up to 100 US gallons (380 L) a minute. Patented in 1721. (Richard Newsham) Category: Pumps\n\n1722: The earliest mercurial pump, devised by Swedenborg and described in his Miscellanea observata circa yes naturales (1722), was statical in action, consisting essentially in replacing the solid piston of the mechanical pump by a column of mercury, which by being alternately raised and lowered gradually exhausted a vessel. (Emanuel Swedenborg) Category: Pumps\n\n1725–1728: In 1725 John Harrison investigated the expansion of metals caused by the effects of heat and cold. In 1727–28 he developed the gridiron pendulum consisting of four steel rods (in addition to the pendulum rod itself) and four brass rods. The extra rods are arranged in a frame which allows them to move freely in relation to the pendulum rod. However, they are riveted so that the steel rods can only expand downwards and the brass rods upwards. This keeps the pendulum bob at a constant position.

It is a great hollow wheel, forming a kind of barrel or drum composed of several planks joined together with a horizontal axle on which it turns. The interior of this drum is divided into 8 equal spaces by the partitions placed in the direction of the radii. Each space has an orifice about half a foot in the rim of the drum or wheel shaped in such a way to facilitate the admission of water. The tympanum raises water from the running stream moved by the means of float boards. The chief defect of this machine is that it raises water in the most disadvantageous situation possible, since the load is always found towards the extremity of the wheel's radius it cannot act uniformly. M. de la Faye, improved the machine to make this process far more efficient.[28] (M.

The Flute Player, a life-size figure of a shepherd that played the tabor and the pipe and had a repertoire of twelve songs. The figure's fingers were not pliable enough to play the flute correctly, so Vaucanson had to glove the creation in skin. The following year, in early 1738, he presented his creation to the Académie des Sciences.

The design of the chain and the drive wheel decreased link wear and also reduced the probability that the chain would slip or jerk back under the load. With fewer men working it, the pump discharged more water than other contemporary pumps. In a trial on the HMS Seaford, the new pump operated by 4 men pumped 1 ton of water in 43.5 seconds. Another important feature of this chain pump was the ease and speed of which it could be disassembled and reparied.[33] (John Bentinck & William Cole) Category: Pumps\n\n1769: Watt's flyball governor introduced: a device that regulated steam flow to a steam engine to maintain constant engine speed despite a changing load. It was the first automatic feedback controller in industrial process. (James Watt, Glasgow) Category: Valves-Control Mechanisms\n\n1769–1770: Steam road wagon built 1769 by Nicolas Joseph Cugnot. It was a three-wheeled artillery tractor driven by a steam engine. It was demonstrated in 1770, traveling approximately 3 mph. It was the first self-propelled vehicle in the world, making him the world's first automotive engineer. The first was built in 1769 and the second in 1770. This vehicleʾs two-piston steam engine was designed independently of Thomas Newcomen and James Watt and was based directly on the theoretical descriptions of the French physicist Denis Papin. The engine in it was the first to employ high-pressure steam expansively without condensation. The carriage was tricycle-mounted, with the single front wheel performing both steering and driving functions.

Watt invented the condenser in 1765 after repairing Newcomen model engine. James Watt, was assigned the job in 1763 of repairing a model Newcomen engine for the University of Glasgow, and noted how inefficient it was. Watt conceived the idea of a separate condensation chamber to turn the steam back into water. Watt's idea was to equip the engine with a second, small cylinder, connected to the main one. In Watt's design, the cold water was injected only into the condensation chamber. Because the chambers were connected, this caused condensation without significant loss of heat. The specification was accepted on 5 January 1769 and enrolled on 29 April.

(John Smeaton) Category: Submersibles\n\n1788: Drum thresher patented: invented 1784–86. This used fluted rollers to feed sheaves of corn to a rotating drum which beat the corn against a curved casing (the concave). The ears of corn and the chaff then fell through a grating while the straw continued horizontally out of the drum casing. Before Meikle's invention ears of corn had to be separated from the stalks on which they had grown by men wielding jointed wooden sticks – flails – a slow and laborious process. The rate of threshing, as this was called, limited the output of wheat, oats and barley as food for people and horses, and as the raw material for brewing and whisky distilling. (Andrew Meikle) Category: Agriculture-Food Production\n\n1789: Caloric heat theory described; experiments end phlogiston; modern combustion theory established. Caloric theory is an obsolete scientific theory that was superseded by the mid-19th century in favor of the mechanical theory of heat (A L Lavoisier, France) Category: Thermodynamics—Theory\n\n1790: Nail-making machine with toggle joint invented. (Jacob Perkins, Massachusetts) Category: Machine Tools\n\n1790: Use of cast iron for rail track begins to develop first in South Wales and northeast New England (USA): promoted by Wm. Jessop of Britain. However, cast iron rails had a propensity to break easily, and the short lengths soon became uneven. In 1820, it was replaced by John Birkenshaw's method of rolling rails in greater lengths using wrought iron. (Britain and USA) Category: Railway\n\n1790: Wet-spun process using machine for spinning flax yarn patented and installed in factory. (Matthew Murray, Leeds, England) Category: Textile Industry Mechanization\n\n1790: Sewing machine patented. Commercially unsuccessful but included many practically functional features: an overhanging arm, a feed mechanism (adequate for short lengths of leather), a vertical needle bar, and a looper. (Thomas Saint, Britain) Category: Textile Industry Mechanization\n\n1790–1798:First US cotton mill built using powered machinery; built by Wm Almy and S Brown. It was designed from memory of Slater's time as an apprentice in an industrialized cotton mill in Britain to produce spindles of yarn. (Samuel Slater, Pawtucket, R.I.) Category: Textile Industry Mechanization\n\n1790: Laws of friction established in experiments to improve vehicle performance (soil mechanics). (C A de Coulomb) Category: Tribology\n\n1791: An improved steam heating method for factory and other buildings developed by James Watt. He is awarded the first British patent the same year). Category: Heaters-Furnaces, Boilers\n\n1791: Gas turbine patented in Britain by John Barber (engineer) but not built. Barber's concept was for a turbine to burn gas obtained from wood, coal, oil, or other substances, heated in a retort or producer, from where the gases were conveyed into a receiver and cooled. Air and gas were then to be compressed in different cylinders and pumped into an \"exploder\" (combustion chamber) where they were ignited, the mixture of hot gas then being played against the vanes of a paddle wheel. Water was to be injected into the explosive mixture to cool the mouth of the chamber and, by producing steam, to increase the volume of the charge. Barber's concept appears sound, but given the technology of that day, it was not possible for the device to create sufficient power to both compress the air and the gas and produce useful work. (John Barber, Britain) Category: Gas Turbines\n\n1791: Titanium isolated by isolating the calx of an unknown metal (William Gregor, Cornwall Britain) Category: Materials in Tooling\n\n1792: Cotton factory heated by hot air system, air flow measured with anemometer; wrought-iron furnace. Based on the distribution of warm air through networks of ducts incorporated in floor and wall construction.A similar installation was built at the Derby infirmary building.[40] (William Strutt, Derby, Britain) Category: Heaters-Furnaces, Boilers\n\n1793: Rotary shearing engine, with spiral knives working against a bed plate, for textile industry. (US) Category: Materials Handling\n\n1793: Water-tube boiler used on steamboat. It would be the same boiler Robert Fulton uses in his \"Clermont\" (Barlow, France) Category: Heaters-Furnaces, Boilers\n\n1793: Woodworking machinery patented (includes planing machines with rotary cutters) helping to revolutionize the production of the wooden pulley blocks used in ships' rigging, devising woodworking machinery to improve production efficiency. (Samuel Bentham, Britain) Category: Machine Tools\n\n1793: First important US water-powered woolen mill. (Scholfield, Newburyport, Mass) Category: Textile Industry Mechanization\n\n1794–1945: Springfield Armory established for US govt manufacturing: includes research and development, gauges, metal working, etc. The Springfield Armory was designated a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark (No. 41) in 1980[41] (Warner, Thomas Blanchard, Springfield, Mass) Category: Machine Tools\n\n1794: First US stamp mill built. (Josiah Hornblower, New Jersey) Category: Forging and Fabrication\n\n1794: Compound slide rest developed. Slide rest was already invented but was the first time someone combined the slide rest, leadscrew, and change gears in a precision machine, which popularized the concept and caused modern industry to widely adopt it. (Henry Maudslay, Britain) Category: Machine Tools\n\n1794: Coal gas produced by decomposing coal in a retort. Murdoch was producing coal gas from a small retort containing heated coals with a three or four-foot iron tube attached, through which he piped the gas before sending it through an old gun barrel and igniting it to produce light. Murdoch's house (which still exists) at Redruth was the first domestic residence to be lit by gas. (William Murdock, Britain) Category: Fuels Processing\n\n1794: Eli Whitney develops a machine for separating seeds from cotton and applies for a patent in 1793. The patent was not validated until 1807, allowing numerous 'copy cats.' The device, generally referred to as a cotton 'gin' (an abbreviation for machine) used a combination of a wire screen and small wire hooks to pull the cotton through, and brushes to continuously remove the loose cotton lint to prevent jams. It effectively separated cotton fibers from their seeds. By allowing greater productivity than manual cotton separation, it established Southern plantation wealth and influenced manufacturing industries. (Eli Whitney, US) Category: Agriculture-Food Production\n\n1794: Internal combustion engine using piston and system of levers patented: raised water. (Robert Street, Britain) Category: IC Piston Engines\n\n1795–1798: Assembly process machines to produce interchangeable gun parts developed (independent of French work). (Eli Whitney and Samuel Bentham, New Haven, Conn) (Note: Samuel Bentham worked independently from Whitney to help create interchangeable parts for sailing blocks not firearms. Secondly, while Whitney did demonstrate the potential benefit of \"interchangeable parts\" for the firearms to the US Congress, he never achieved interchangeable parts manufacturing. His family company did so after his death.) Category: Machine Tools\n\n1795: Advanced management practices implemented in Soho Factory setting up executive development programs, sickness benefit schemes and welfare programmes.: 2d generation (sons). (Boulton and Watt (sons), near Birmingham, Britain) Category: Management Science and Policy\n\n1796: Drop process for producing spherical lead shot patented; 1807, used at Jackson Shot Tower. ASME Designated the Jackson Ferry Shot Tower in Austinville, VA as a Historic Mechancial Engineering Landmark in 1981 as one of the few surviving shot towers.[42] Category: Arms, Weapons, and Military\n\n1796: Self-acting hydraulic ram introduced: in use by 1827 for raising water in a paper mill at Voiron. (J M Montgolfier, France) Category: Forging and Fabrication\n\n1796–1798: Hydraulic press*, using Pascal's hydrostatic principles, built 1795, patented 1796: with Henri Maudsley, first functional hydraulic press. The press had two cylinders and pistons of different cross-sectional areas. If a force was exerted on the smaller piston, this would be translated into a larger force on the larger piston. The difference in the two forces would be proportional to the difference in area of the two pistons. In effect the cylinders act in a similar way that a lever is used to increase the force exerted.
