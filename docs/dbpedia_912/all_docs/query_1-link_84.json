You may recognize the Lockheed Corporation SR-71. Although its last flight was in the late 90s, Blackbird remains the fastest airbreathing manned aircraft with a top speed of 2,200mph...until its successor (the SR-72) hits the sky. The Porsche is a creation of the French guys with Mechanical Hearts & Artistic Souls...I'm talking about Machine Revival It's a 1968 Porsche 912-based build fitted with a flat six 993 M64 block. A pair of carbon buckets, a Sparco steering wheel, and the right amount of pedals connect the vehicle with its driver. Make no mistake by looking at its silhouette! The Porsche was built for one purpose....Time Trials! While 300 horsepower is not a number to be impressed with nowadays, the Porsche weighs just 1,900 lbs, and it's dressed with performance goodies. What do the car and the spy plane have in common? Like most top-notch builders, the French gearheads believe that every car deserves a name...and this Porsche they named after the aircraft - \"913 Blackbird\" It may not fly at 2,200 mph, but it's surely capable of propelling its pilot with fury on the runway. #porsche #automotive #classiccars\n\nThe Volkswagen ID.7 has become the first ever vehicle to achieve an overall rating of ‘very good’ in the independent test performed by ADAC, Europe’s largest automobile club! 👏 Last month, the ID.3 clinched the Best Buy-award from Test-Aankoop/Test Achat (see: https://lnkd.in/eWZaP8b8). Now the ID.7 has received a historic top score in ADAC's vehicle test, becoming the very first vehicle to be rated as 'very good'. Here's a short resume of their findings: ▶ Every year, 100 vehicles are put through their paces bij the ADAC, testing them according to more than 350 criteria in seven main categories. The ID.7 received outstanding scores in the categories of engine/drive (1.0), safety (1.1), environment/ecological test (1.2) and comfort (1.5). ▶ The electric saloon also impressed in the other main categories that contributed to the overall rating. For instance, the areas of driving characteristics (2.1), body/luggage compartment (2.3) and interior (2.4) were rated as ‘good’. Since the two categories of environment/ecological test and safety have the highest weighting, the overall score for the ID.7 was 1.5, resulting in its historical overall rating of ‘very good’. 💬 I've personally driven the ID.7 over a longer period and came away very impressed by its overall comfort, silence and zen-factor. If you haven't tried our electric flagship yet, please do so at your nearest Volkswagen-dealer and get ready to be amazed!
