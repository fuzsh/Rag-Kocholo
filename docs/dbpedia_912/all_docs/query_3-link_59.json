        "text": "All-New Electric Powertrain Elevates the Industry’s Hardest Working, Smoothest Riding UTV to a Whole New Level of Capability, Durability and Performance\n\nMINNEAPOLIS, MN (Dec. 1, 2021) – Polaris (NYSE: PII), the world leader in powersports and off-road innovation, has harnessed the power of electrification and is once again pushing the industry forward with the introduction of its highly anticipated RANGER XP Kinetic – the hardest working, smoothest riding UTV ever built. Featuring an entirely new electric powertrain born from Polaris’ partnership with Zero Motorcycles®, RANGER XP Kinetic establishes a new standard for UTV performance and productivity, delivering uncompromised capability, unrivalled durability and refined performance.\n\n“Time and again, Polaris has demonstrated our commitment to rider-driven innovation, delivering what our riders need and going beyond what they imagined was possible,” said Mike Speetzen, CEO of Polaris. “Building on this rich legacy, we continue our relentless pursuit to create unmatched riding experiences and are partnering with Zero Motorcycles® to harness the incredible capabilities of electric for our customers. The new RANGER XP Kinetic is a powerful example of this.”\n\nWith industry-leading horsepower and torque, RANGER XP Kinetic offers more power than ever to pull more, haul more, and get more done. The electric powertrain’s instantaneous torque delivers precise control when pulling or towing heavy loads. In addition, the industry’s most advanced drivetrain performs with less moving parts for lower maintenance costs and more uptime for increased productivity. Plus, the quiet electric powertrain means easy conversation with family and friends, the ability to work in the early morning without waking neighbours, quiet operation around animals and offers stealthy entry and exit to hunting spots.\n\n“The RANGER XP Kinetic is built for our hard-working customers who take pride in their work, value accomplishment, and are always looking for ways to maximise their productivity,” said Steve Menneto, President of Polaris Off-Road. “The RANGER XP Kinetic unlocks the benefits of electrification to enable these customers to drive efficiency and get more done, giving them the power to do more than ever before.”\n\n“Electrifying an already class-leading product is a very complicated undertaking, but with Polaris we had the advantage of starting with both the best UTV in the industry and a very talented and collaborative team,” said Sam Paschel, CEO of Zero Motorcycles. “The combination of Zero Motorcycles’ technology, our passion for electrification as a powertrain solutions provider, and Polaris’ dedication to consumer-led innovation has created an all-new electric Ranger that delivers an incredible rider experience.”\n\nRANGER XP Kinetic is available as a 3-seat model and will feature a Premium and Ultimate trim. The Premium trim contains a single 14.9 kWh lithium-ion battery that offers an estimated range of 45 miles (70 kilometres), while the Ultimate trims delivers 29.8 kWh of battery capacity and offers an estimated range of 80 miles (130 kilometres).* The Ultimate trim also offers a 18-centimetre infotainment screen powered by RIDE COMMAND technology.\n\nUNCOMPROMISED CAPABILITY\n\nThe all-new RANGER XP Kinetic offers uncompromised capability to help customers get more done and features the most horsepower and torque ever found in a utility side-by-side. Industry-leading 110 HP and 140lb-ft of instant torque delivers maximum capability for confidently hauling and towing heavy loads even over the toughest terrain. Together, the unmatched horsepower and torque gives customers the power they need, when they need it, for the ability to effortlessly tow 1134kg and haul an industry-best 567kg. RANGER XP Kinetic also features a class-leading 35.5-centimetres of ground clearance to confidently rise over obstacles, and is equipped with 74-centimetre, 8-ply Pro Armor X-Terrain tires for maximum traction and durability to crawl over rocks and ruts. And with 25.4-centimetres of suspension travel, XP Kinetic smooths out the bumps so customers can ride comfortably in challenging terrain – no matter where the job takes them.\n\nUNRIVALLED DURABILITY\n\nRANGER XP Kinetic also delivers unrivalled durability so riders can maximise their uptime and improve productivity. The electric powertrain features fewer moving parts, meaning less maintenance and more uptime. RANGER XP Kinetic has been torture-tested in extreme conditions and treacherous terrain and is backed by a 1-year factory-installed warranty, 3-year electric powertrain coverage, and 5-year battery coverage**. What’s more, the electric powertrain does not require oil changes, filter replacements, spark plugs or clutch maintenance. Scheduled maintenance costs are expected to be 70% less than average maintenance costs for similar fuel-powered vehicles.***\n\nRANGER XP Kinetic also features a full-coverage front bumper and full-body skid plate for added vehicle protection while riding on tough terrain.\n\nREFINED PERFORMANCE\n\nCapable and durable, RANGER XP Kinetic also delivers refined performance with clean, quiet operation for easy conversations with friends and family, stealthy trips to remote hunting spots, and quiet operation around horses and other livestock. The electric powertrain delivers smooth, precise control when operating at low speeds, so customers will have full control and confidence while towing, backing up to a trailer, or spraying a fence line. The instantaneous torque also delivers faster acceleration for an exhilarating ride on the family property.\n\nRANGER XP Kinetic also offers smart performance features to help customers maximise productivity. A 12V cargo box outlet is convenient for powering accessories like sprayers or charging portable batteries. A new shifter design includes high, low, neutral and park, but features a new, integrated switch for forward and reverse so customers change directions with the flip of a switch, making tasks like plowing fast and efficient.\n\nIn addition to high and low gear, RANGER XP Kinetic also has three drive modes for maximum versatility optimised to driving conditions and range management:\n\n• Eco+: Optimises torque and top speed for maximum range and light duty jobs.\n\n• Standard: Optimises throttle response for everyday driving and moderate-sized jobs\n\n• Sport: Optimises throttle response for spirited driving and the toughest jobs"
