In the same year, the market share of electric vehicles was around 10% worldwide, up from just 2% in 2019. With this, there are now over 16.5 million electric vehicles on the roads across the world, which is 3X than that in 2018.\n\n2 million electric vehicle sales in the first quarter of 2022 amounted to a 75% increase over the same time in 2021. The market for electric vehicles has continued to grow rapidly. Electric vehicles of today are technological marvels. While their propulsion receives most of the attention, these vehicles also have other cutting-edge features.\n\nRegenerative suspensions, which recover energy through the car's shock absorbers, are one of the most prominent EV innovations. In 2009, MIT students created the initial regenerative suspension system. Numerous engineers and automakers have since created their own prototypes. This story is important for EVs since it shows how this energy can be used to produce electricity that can be used to power the vehicle. This could theoretically expand EV car ranges and expedite public acceptance of EVs.\n\nWhat Do Regenerative Suspension System Producers Need to Watch Out For?\n\n“High Initial Cost of Regenerative Suspension Systems to Dent Adoption in Passenger Vehicles”\n\nThe standard range of a regenerative suspension system can be developed, however, it is still not a feasible choice as sales would be limited to premium electric vehicles. Due to the high initial investment required in research & development, OEMs are reluctant to implement regenerative shock absorbers in vehicles. The cost is uncertain as regenerative suspension systems are currently in the development & prototyping stage, requiring a lot of work to be done for commercialization.\n\nHigher suspension costs would lead to increased prices of EVs, which could restrain the growth of this market. It’s no secret that the maintenance of the suspension is one of the most expensive aspects of a vehicle. Owing to the aforementioned factors, investments in the mass production of regenerative suspensions are a challenging task for manufacturers.\n\n“Limited Investments in R&D Slowing Product Development”\n\nCurrently, very few companies are investing in the research & development of regenerative suspension systems, and are more focused on currently trending air suspensions in EVs.
