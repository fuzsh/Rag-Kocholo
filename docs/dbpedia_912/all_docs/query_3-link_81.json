        "text": "As with many high end shock absorbers available today, this design employs the gas pressure monotube shock absorber principle patented by BILSTEIN ® in 1954. The basic idea is that by pressurizing the system, cavitation and foaming can be avoided which would otherwise compromise the performance of the shock absorber. Locating the pressurized nitrogen gas charge in a remote reservoir permits more room in the shock absorber for piston rod travel, thus maximizing suspension articulation. In typical monotube shock absorbers, the internal gas chamber is connected to the compression chamber (opposite the piston rod end). The gas pressure is set high enough to avoid cavitation in the rebound chamber and support the desired forces during compression events. In some off road racing applications, a remote reservoir can be seen connected to the rebound chamber (piston rod end). In this case, the gas pressure is set high enough to avoid cavitation in the compression chamber and support the desired forces during rebound events. With the BlackHawk ® e2 the reservoir is connected via check valves to both compression and rebound chambers, exploiting the advantages and avoiding the limitations of both configurations. Containing the nitrogen gas in the system requires more scrutiny of sealing due to the ability of gases to permeate elastomeric seals. Rather than relying on o rings and a separate cap on the nitrogen side of the reservoir, a hot formed steel tube is used. Hot forming allows the tube to be headed just under its melting point, causing the end to close into a single piece leak free barrier.\n\nIt’s not just a steel rod. Designed for the harshest conditions, our high\n\nstrength steel is case hardened to industry leading depths and showcases chrome plating that is thicker and harder than the competition. Superfinishing then creates an ideal sliding surface. Simply polishing the chrome to a smooth as glass finish would prohibit oil from lubricating the rod seals, increasing friction and seal wear imagine a dry squeegee on a dry window. Conversely, an overly rough chrome surface would carry too much oil past the rod seals and out of the shock absorber, directly damaging the rod seals. True to the demanding standards of BILSTEIN ®, perfecting surface finish controls are enforced for exceptional reliability.\n\nThe Black Hawk ® e2 includes ZoneControl ® Jounce Cut Off (JCO) technology to equip you with patented bottom out control, just in case you need to stick a landing after a short flight. The JCO is comprised of the JCO secondary compression valve piston and the two stage telescoping compression stop. As the shock absorber approaches full compression, the secondary piston engages the compression stop, providing a hydraulic cushion tuned specifically for the TRX The telescoping action of the compression stop creates a progressive transition, eliminating a harsh impact when suspension travel has been consumed during extreme jounce events.\n\nThe basic principle of typical automotive shock absorbers is to convert unwanted kinetic energy (vehicle motion) into thermal energy ( by forcing oil through hydraulic restrictions. The heat is then dissipated to the surrounding air. Cooling fins increase the surface area to enhance this heat dissipation. Rather than simply extruding fins along the length of the tube, these are meticulously machined on a lathe around the circumference of the tube to take full advantage of the natural air flow direction over the shock absorbers. Additionally, large radii on the fins and in the grooves between the fins simplifies washing after muddy adventures.\n\nAluminum does not rust and will even form a natural oxide layer that protects the base metal from additional oxidation. Anodizing is an electrolytic process that creates an enhanced form of this protective layer For the BlackHawk ® e2, anodizing is performed in accordance with US Military Specification MIL A 8625. This ensures a level of corrosion protection approved for use by all departments and agencies of the United States Department of Defense In addition to outstanding corrosion protection, an exclusive pretreatment is performed to achieve a sophisticated frosted appearance, helping the exterior echo the refined technology within."
