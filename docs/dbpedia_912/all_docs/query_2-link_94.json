The Lotus community has been benefiting from these high quality suspensions since 1999. Lower your 4C and dial in the handling to meet your specifics needs - whether on road or on track or a combination. A proper suspension is one of the best upgrades you can make on a sportscar.\n\nThese Nitrons come in two flavors: R1 & R3. The R1 is a 1 Way (Single Adjustable) and the R3 is a 3 Way (Triple Adjustable). R1 allow for easy adjustments to Rebound/Compression at the same time. The R3 separates Rebound from High Speed and Low Speed Compression.\n\nR1 kits provides uncompromising quality, reliability and performance without the need for a remote canister. Fade-resistant and hand built with ultra-low friction components, the R1 shock is made to last on the road and track.\n\nBy incorporating class leading large diameter piston and ultra-strong piston rod, the R3 system demonstrates outstanding levels of performance, damping control and adjustment. Remotely mounted reservoir allows quick and simple independent adjustment of rebound and fast and slow compression damping. The large range of adjustment and quality of feedback allows the experienced driver to fully exploit the full potential of their car. The R3 is a proven race winner and lap record holder across a wide spectrum of international motorsport formulas.\n\nThe high-grade materials protect against corrosion while reducing weight. Every Nitron kit is custom built, sprung and fully serviceable. Titanium and hard-anodised parts are hand built to last not only season after season, but also the harshest of winters.\n\nSpring Rates:\n\nFast road/track day rates are 275lbs front and 342lbs rear\n\nTrack/Race rates are 375lbs front and 456lbs rear\n\nModel Compatability:"
