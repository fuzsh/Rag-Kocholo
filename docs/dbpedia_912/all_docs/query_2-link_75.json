        "text": "Sit comfortably at work in the Trendway Elea kinetic office chair. If you outfit your workspace with these chairs, the office will not only look great but also feel great to everyone working there. Moving naturally with your body, the Elea seat encourages you not to sit still. In fact, it uses patent-pending Omni-Kinetic Suspension Technology. This moves along with your movements, keeping your body active in motion throughout the day. However, this kinetic office chair provides stability thanks to its alloy steel rods and cast aluminum frame. The load-bearing design provides a strong, secure construction. Of course, one of the most important features is comfort, and the curved chassis boasts just that. Youâ€™ll enjoy sitting in this chair for days, weeks, and years on end.\n\nMeet the Team\n\nGadget Flow is headquartered in New York City, and most of our team works remotely from the US and Europe.
