        "text": "[Note that this article is a transcript of the video embedded above.]\n\nIn February of 2017, one of the largest spillways in the world, the one at Oroville Dam in northern California, was severely damaged during releases from heavy rain. You might remember this. I made a video about it, and then another one about the impressive feat of rebuilding the structure. In the forensic report following the incident, one of the contributing causes identified in the failure was the drainage system below the spillway. Rather than being installed below the concrete, each drain protruded into it, reducing the thickness of the concrete and making it more prone to cracking. But why do you need drains below a spillway in the first place? Put simply: water doesn’t just flow on the surface of earth. It also flows through the soil and rock below it. Water that gets underneath a structure creates pressure that can lift and move it. That’s especially true when the water is flowing. Dam Engineers deal with the challenge in two ways: make concrete structures like spillways massive (so gravity holds them in place) and use drains to relieve that pressure, giving the water a way out.\n\nEven though we depend on it to live, water is the enemy of all kinds of structures. Pressure is far from the only problem it causes. Most of us have come face to face with it in some way or other. Water causes some soils to expand and contract. It freezes, promotes rot, erodes, and corrodes, wreaking all kinds of havoc on the things we build. On the surface, water is relatively easy to manage through channels and curbs and slopes. Below the ground, things get much more challenging. Subsurface drainage is a really interesting challenge, and it applies to everything from simple landscaping at your house to the biggest structures on Earth, and there are a lot of things that can go wrong if they’re not designed correctly. I’m Grady, and this is Practical Engineering. Today, we’re talking about French Drains.\n\nThe idea of a subsurface drain is really pretty simple. And I built a model here in the garage to show you how they work. This is just an acrylic box with a hole at the bottom. I filled the box with sand to simulate soil. And I left a small area of gravel in front of the hole. A few strategically-placed dye tablets will help with the visualization. When I turn on the rainfall simulator, watch what happens. Water percolating into the subsurface continues flowing within the sand. It moves toward the gravel, eventually flowing into the holes between the stones and out of the model. (Don’t pay attention to those dye traces on the left. Turns out there was a small leak in the box that was acting as a… secondary outlet to my drain). When the rain is over, the subsurface water continues to flow until the soil is mostly dries out.\n\nThis is a very simple model of what’s often referred to as a French drain. It’s not from France but named after an American farmer, lawyer, politician, and inventor Henry French whose 1846 book on Farm Drainage cataloged and described many of the practices being used around the world. Funny enough, he was explicit that he didn’t invent these drains, claiming “no great praise of originality in what is here offered to the public.” Still, I have to admit, after reading his book, I understand why he became the namesake of the drains he made famous. The man had a way with words:\n\n“The art of removing superfluous water from land must be as ancient as the art of cultivation; and from the time when Noah and his family anxiously watched the subsiding of the waters into their appropriate channels to the present, men must have felt the ill effects of too much water, and adopted means, more or less effective, to remove it.”\n\nWell before we worried about draining subsurface water to protect buildings and structures, farmers were doing it in one way or another to keep their fields from sogginess that affects the growth of crops and bogs down agricultural equipment. In fact, “tile drain” is another common term for subsurface drains because clay tiles were used to hold the drains open. And there are plenty of fields still drained using clay tiles today. But French pointed out that rocks sometimes work just as well:\n\n“Providence has so liberally supplied the greater part of New England with stones, that it seems to the most inexperienced person to be a work of supererogation, almost, to manufacture tiles or any other draining material for our farms.”\n\nHe was mostly right, and gravel-filled trenches are used all over the place for simple and non-critical applications. The problem with rocks is that they clog up. You can kind of see how sand migrated into the spaces between the gravel in my demo. Since it’s sand, it’s not really a problem, but if this were a finer-grained soil, it would eventually reduce the drain’s ability to transport water, slowing down the drainage process. Tiles provided the benefit of holding open a clear space for water to flow. Over time, perforated or slotted pipes began to replace tiles for use in drains. You’ve probably seen these before; there are a hundred different styles and materials. Rather than flowing in through the joints between the tiles, the water just comes into the holes in the pipe. But which way should the holes face? Turns out it’s a debate as old as pipes themselves among engineers and contractors, and there are strong opinions on both sides.\n\nIf the holes are on the top, water has to fill the gravel to the top of the pipe before it can get in and be carried away. If the holes are on the bottom, the flow path isn’t smooth, so the water flows slower and is less likely to wash away any soil or debris that gets inside. From my research, it seems like most of the manufacturers recommend holes down so the gravel envelope doesn’t have to be completely saturated before water can enter the pipe. I think, in practice, it’s really not too important, and actually, a lot of perforated pipes you can buy for drainage have holes all the way around so you don’t even have to think about it. That’s the best kind of decision, in my book. But, if it seems counterintuitive to you to orient the holes downward, I can demonstrate it in my model.\n\nWith a pipe in the middle of the gravel layer, I can turn on the rain again. Just like before, water makes its way through the soil toward the drain, and eventually out of the model. Let’s watch that sped up. When the rain is off, the soil continues draining out until it’s no longer saturated. Hopefully it’s clear how beneficial this is. Without that drain, water will eventually dry out of the soil by flowing away or evaporating over time. But getting it out quickly, with a drain, gives it less opportunity to apply pressure to basement walls, freeze against a structure creating long-term movement, swell the soils, or cause rot and corrosion.\n\nI’m using sand in my model to speed up these simulations, so this envelope of small gravel with a pipe inside is working pretty well to keep the soil in place. But, somewhat inconveniently, most places we want to drain aren’t overlain by playground sand. They have finer-grained soils, including silt and clay. These small stones are holding back the sand, but tinier particles would just flow right through the cracks. That can lead to erosion over time as water dislodges and carries soil particles away through the drain. Watch what happens when I try my French Drain model with large stones between the sand and the outlet. You can see the turbid water coming through the drain, indicating that soil particles are making their way out. And if you watch closely on the right side, you can see where they’re coming from. Eventually, enough sand washes through the rocks to create a sinkhole, and the rest of the water bursts through. Made a HECK of a mess (pardon my French drain). I’ve talked about internal erosion and sinkholes in a previous video, so check that one out if you want more details. This erosion can also result in clogging if the soil particles move into the gravel and pipe. In fact, clogging is the biggest problem with subsurface drains, so properly designed ones usually have some kind of filter.\n\nThe design you’re probably most familiar with if you’ve seen or installed a french drain yourself uses geotextile fabric. These are permeable sheets that have a wide variety of applications: separating different layers of soil or rock, protecting against erosion, adding reinforcement to backfill, and filtering soil particles out of flowing water. A typical french drain design uses geotextile fabric around the gravel envelope to keep the fines from migrating in. It’s sometimes known as a pipe-within-a-pipe. But geotextile has some limitations. It’s easy to damage during installation. It’s pretty much impossible to repair or replace once it’s in place. And it also gets clogged up. It’s just a thin mesh of fibers, after all, so once soil particles get stuck, they can quickly lead to a decrease in permeability and efficiency. But there is another option for filtration, and it’s most commonly used on dams.\n\nIt is hard to overstate the importance of properly filtered drains for dams. If you don’t believe me, take it from the Federal Emergency Management Agency in their 360-page report, Filters for Embankment Dams: Best Practices for Design and Construction. If that’s not enough, try the Bureau of Reclamation in their 400-page report, Drainage for Dams and Associated Structures. A civil engineer could spend an entire career just thinking about subsurface drains, and for good reason. Lots of high-profile dam failures have directly resulted from a lack of drains or ones that weren’t designed well, including the Oroville Spillway incident I mentioned. For embankment dams that are built from compacted soil, any movement of those soil particles can spell demise. And if you think about all the ways that water is terrible for structures, you can imagine how hard it is to design a structure whose literal job is to hold it back. That’s why they use filters of a different design. You can see it in bold right here in this FEMA status report: “It’s the policy of the National Dam Safety Review Board that geotextiles should not be used in locations that are critical to the safety of the dam.”\n\nInstead, they use sand. Just like the gravel in my demonstration lets the water through while holding back the sand particles, sand can hold back smaller particles of silt and clay, acting as a filter. But it’s a little more complicated than that. Every soil consists of a variety of sizes of particles. I can show that pretty easily, again using sand as an example. I have a collection of sieves with different sizes of holes, each one finer than the one above. I put my sand in at the top. Then give it a little shake (a little razzle-dazzle). And when I open it back up, the sand is all sorted out. If you weigh out the fraction that got caught in each sieve and plot that on a graph, you get something like this: a grain size distribution curve, also called the soil’s gradation. Soils can have a wide variety of gradations. And it’s super important to understand in this case, because before you can design a filter, you have to know what you’re trying to filter out. Once you know the base soil’s grain size distribution, there are a number of engineering methods to find a material that will both allow water to flow while still holding the soil back. And in a lot of cases, that just happens to end up being some variation on the sand we’re used to using in concrete and sandboxes and demonstrations about french drains.\n\nActually, for dams, you often can get either the filtration you need or the capacity to let water through, but not both in the same material. So lots of dams use two-stage filters. The first stage filters the base soil material. The second stage filters the first stage, but lets water flow more freely. And then, you put a perforated pipe in the middle to get the water out of the drain as quickly as possible. So they look basically identical to the demonstration I built: sand, then gravel, then pipe.\n\nAs for dealing with the water once it’s out of the ground, there are really just two options. The easiest is to simply release it by gravity to the surface at some low point. But if you don’t have a low point on the surface nearby, the other alternative is to pump it. If you have a basement at your house, there’s a good chance you have a sump, which is just a low spot for drainage to collect, and if you have a sump, it’s a REALLY GOOD idea to have a sump pump, to move that water out and somewhere outside your house.\n\nOf course, there’s a lot more to this. Dams have all kinds of drainage features depending on their design. Concrete dams often include a gallery or tunnel with vertical drains into the foundation. Embankment dams often feature a large internal drain called a chimney filter to keep water moving through cracks or pores from carrying soil along with it. And it’s not just dams. Plenty of structures, like retaining walls, rely on good subsurface drainage for protection against all the bad things that water does, not to mention their widespread use in agriculture. There are lots of interesting designs and maybe even more proprietary products on the market all trying to accomplish those two main tasks: get the water out without getting the soil out too. In the end, it’s all the same engineering whether you’re trying to protect a multi-million dollar structure or just keep your basement dry. I think Mr. French put it best:\n\n“Indeed, the importance of this subject of drainage, seems all at once to have found universal acknowledgement throughout our country, not only from agriculturists, but from philosophers and men of general science.”\n\nI don’t think anyone could reasonably call me a philosopher, but I do love drains, and I hope you agree that, from dams to fields to foundations of houses, they are pretty important.\n\nFrench drains are one of those topics that be hard to sell in a pitch meeting, right? No studio executive would be like, “Yes, this is a million dollar idea!” But the thing I love about this channel is that it’s created a passionate community around seemingly mundane things like subsurface drains. TV used to be like that too: something for everyone. I loved the old History and Discovery channel shows. Now it’s all converged into reality shows and reruns, and I’ve found that pretty much everything I watch these days is done by passionate independent producers. If you feel the same way, I have a recommendation for you: The Getaway by my friend Sam at Wendover Productions.\n\nIt’s a gameshow with a hilarious premise, which is that all of the contestants (who are all big YouTubers, by the way) are snitches, but each one thinks they’re the only one. And it just leads to all these very funny situations where everyone is trying to secretly sabotage the contests. Plus the behind-the-scene cuts to the producers trying to keep all the confusion under control are wonderful. It’s such a great twist on a game show, and it’s one of those creative experiments that only works because it’s independently produced. The chaos of it is what makes it great, and that’s why it’s only available on Nebula.\n\nI talk about Nebula a lot. It’s a streaming service built by and for independent creators, and it’s growing super fast. After the major overhaul of the home page, making it easier to find new stuff to love, we’ve leaned into producing really good original content, like The Getaway; basically allowing your favorite creators to make bigger budget videos without the fear of having it flop on YouTube’s algorithm. That means you get more creative, interesting, and thoughtful videos.

The rumor was that Columbus Joiner had struck oil. At 70 years old, Joiner had already won and lost several fortunes in the oil business, but it seemed like, on that October afternoon in 1930, he might just have one more in him. As the congregation grew, Joiner and his crew slowly swabbed the water and mud up and out of the well, relieving the pressure at the bottom. Eventually, the ramshackle derrick began to rumble and shake. Suddenly, the Daisy Bradford No. 3 erupted, showering black oil on the cheering crowd. It was the “discovery” well for what would quickly become the largest and most prolific oil field in the continental United States at the time. Joiner would lose that fortune too, but the boom he kicked off would change the state forever.\n\nThe sudden inrush of oil workers and their families inundated the area, including the unincorporated town of New London. New families needed a new school, so one was built in 1932. But no one could have imagined that what created the town in the first place would ultimately rob it of a generation only a few years later in one of the worst school disasters in US history. I’m Grady, and this is Practical Engineering.\n\nWith all of the extra population and tax revenue pouring in, New London quickly became one of the wealthiest rural school districts in America, and its new school was correspondingly designed. The building sat on a gentle slope with a footprint shaped like a large capital letter E. Both the north and south wings projected out from the hillside, creating space for classrooms below the main floor. But the main part of the school had a mostly unused crawlspace below its first level. This crawlspace had just two doors into the basement wings and four small vents to the outside for circulation. The school was originally designed to be heated by a large central boiler, but the school board changed the plan during construction to install cheaper, individual gas-fired radiators throughout the building. Gas was supplied by a local utility company for the following years until an opportunity arose in January 1937.\n\nThe Parade Gasoline Company had constructed a condensate extraction plant not far from the school. Natural gas is an incredibly important resource today, but at the time, it was mostly considered a byproduct of oil drilling. The supply was just so much higher than the demand because gas was difficult to transport at large scales. Networks of long-distance natural gas pipelines wouldn’t arrive until after World War II. But it was possible to extract liquids from raw natural gas by cooling the vapor. The resulting condensate (often known as “drip gas”) had many uses and could even be used as a low-quality substitute for gasoline in older engines.\n\nParade’s plant was a simple operation. It accepted raw natural gas from nearby wells, extracted the condensates, and then sent the “residue” gas back to the oil fields in another pipeline, where it was mostly burned off in flares. Since it was already a kind of garbage gas, it was common practice at the time for homes, businesses, and public institutions within easy reach of the residue pipe to tap a line without explicit permission to get the free gas. Since the company was already getting rid of it, they were usually happy to look the other way.\n\nThis might seem like an outrageous and dangerous practice today, but it’s not hard to become accustomed to risk, especially when lots of people are doing the same thing and the benefit is so immediate and obvious. In New London, the school board saw an easy opportunity to save about $250 per month on their heating bill (several thousand dollars in today’s money). In January of 1937, the connection was made by two bus drivers, a janitor, and a local welder. A radiator salesman inspected the new line. They installed a regulator to reduce the sometimes erratic pressure from the residue pipe. From there, the gas would flow into the school building’s crawlspace along a 2-inch line suspended by straps. 96 individual connections tied the main gas line to the heaters and burners throughout the school. But the district would never get to see the savings of the supply switch.\n\nOn Thursday, March 18, 1937, near the end of the day, the school was full of students and teachers eager to be let out for a long weekend. In the basement wood shop, near the crawlspace, a teacher powered on an electric sander, flipping a rudimentary knife switch to complete the circuit. Unbeknownst to the shop teacher and everybody else in the building, the crawlspace had filled with an explosive mixture of residue gas and air. The spark from the knife switch was all it took to ignite the gas and set off a terrible explosion.\n\nExcept for the two doors and four small vents, the crawlspace was practically a sealed chamber of concrete. With nowhere to escape, the pressure of combustion lifted the first floor of the building upward, buckling the walls, and then collapsing the roof into the school. A large chunk of a concrete slab was blown over 200 feet from the building, crushing a car in the nearby parking lot. There were over 500 students, faculty and staff in the building at the time. Chaos ensued as many parents, who had been at the PTA meeting at an adjacent building, reacted to the thunderous sound and ran to the scene. Soon, the school was overwhelmed by residents, oil field workers, and emergency personnel, all doing whatever they could to rescue victims within the collapsed building.\n\nThe Texas Inspection Bureau report described the effort involved:\n\nThe removal of this debris is worthy of comment since it is probable that in no past disaster of record, has it been approached in speed or efficiency and nowhere but in the oil fields would it have been possible to find the necessary equipment, labor and experience immediately available. In the short space of 17 hours after the work was organized, some 2000 tons of debris were picked up piecemeal and hauled away during an all night rain storm; concrete slabs were broken up, tangled steel cut with torches and the smaller fragments that had to be shoveled, were carried off in small baskets and carefully emptied under flood lights to avoid overlooking a hand or foot or any torn portion of a body.\n\nThe story broke across the US, and was reported on by journalists from across the country, including a very young Walter Cronkite, working for the United Press in Dallas at the time. Later in life, he recounted: \"I did nothing in my studies nor in my life to prepare me for a story of the magnitude of that New London tragedy, nor has any story since that awful day equaled it.\"\n\nMother Frances Hospital had just finished construction in Tyler, about 25 miles east of New London. An all-day ceremony, including a ribbon cutting and banquet, had been planned for Friday, March 19. But, when the staff received word of the explosion that Thursday afternoon they decided to open the hospital early. Medical facilities in the surrounding area were overwhelmed with victims, but also with donations and offers to help. In the end, the explosion killed 270 students and 24 adults.\n\nThe governor of Texas declared martial law in New London and appointed a team of officials to form a military court of inquiry, and investigators from the state and federal governments got involved as well. Their first job was to rule out potential causes of the explosion. There were rumors that the blast was a result of dynamite. Apparently, workers had been using it to construct a running track at the nearby athletic field. Eighteen sticks of dynamite were stored below the auditorium on the day of the explosion, but they were found intact afterward.\n\nInvestigators were confident that gas caused the explosion but were not yet sure of its source. They tested the school’s sewer system for combustible gases but found none. They also drilled more than 70 holes into the soil below and around the school to determine whether gases were seeping up from the ground. Their detectors found no meaningful traces of hydrocarbons. The only possible source was also the most obvious: the natural gas line traversing the crawlspace.\n\nLooking back, there may very well have been warning signs. Students and teachers had been complaining about headaches in the week leading up to the explosion. The superintendent and several board members had, in fact, met the day of the explosion to search for potential sources of the complaints. A school janitor even searched the crawlspace that morning and, struggling to see, lit a match to get a better view. Either the leak didn’t start until later that day, or it hadn’t reached an explosive mixture yet. The residue gas was tested in a lab after the event and found to explode when mixed with air at proportions between around 4 and 13 percent.\n\nAll the investigation reports suggested that switching sources from the utility gas to the extraction plant residue line didn’t directly contribute to the explosion. Even though the gas's chemical composition was different, it wasn’t significantly more explosive than the previous supply. And, the regulator should have been able to manage the less reliable pressures coming from the residue line. The Bureau of Mines report concluded that “no appreciable difficulty should have resulted from its use.” But, all the work involved in changing the gas supply was performed by an unqualified crew rather than professional plumbers.\n\nThe Texas Inspection Bureau report noted that the school janitors were often “jacks of all trades and probably masters of none” and that they might not have tested for leaks or tightened joints, or they may have just knocked something loose while they were working.\n\nWe’ll never know for sure what caused the leak because all the plumbing was destroyed in the explosion. But, the investigations did cite a bunch of factors that magnified the likelihood and severity of the disaster. The crawlspace was large, spanning the entire length of the school, creating a huge volume for natural gas to accumulate. The robust concrete foundation and limited sources of ventilation left no easy paths for the pressure of combustion to escape, making the explosion extra powerful. And most importantly, natural gas is mostly odorless. There was no way to detect a leak. And even the smell of the less-refined residue gas from the extraction plant would have been nearly impossible to notice in a town surrounded by oil wells where the smell of petroleum was just a constant part of life.\n\nBut, ultimately, the inquiry found no grounds to charge anyone involved in the disaster. Although the dangers of natural gas were well-known by that time, safety regulations just hadn’t kept pace with its growing use in buildings. The explosion resulted from a number of profound misjudgments, but no laws were broken. Instead of charges, the court issued recommendations to lawmakers to prevent a similar tragedy in the future, many of which were echoed by the other investigative reports. And several of those proposals would forever affect the fields of engineering, plumbing, petroleum production, and more.\n\nWithin a few months, Texas passed two sweeping new laws. First, they joined the growing ranks of states requiring the registration of engineers. At the time, anyone could call themselves an engineer and offer services to the public, regardless of their experience or qualifications. The new law created a regulatory board to oversee the licensing process, helping build public trust in the profession and limiting the possibility of unqualified engineers being involved in decisions that affect public safety. Similar laws and licensing would come for the plumbing industry a decade later.\n\nThe second major law that resulted from the explosion established regulations for the odorization of natural gas. Many utilities across the country (and elsewhere in the world) were voluntarily adding chemicals to their gas to make it more detectable by smell, but the new law in Texas created standards that would quickly spread through the rest of the US. Only a few months after that law came into effect, Peerless Manufacturing began shipping an odorizer invented by two Texans, one of whom helped in the rescue effort at New London. The Type “M” Oderizer could precisely dispense liquid odorant into a gas stream, accounting for any changes in flow rate and pressure. The device was designated a Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1992, and odorizers of its kind have likely saved countless lives by making natural gas leaks easily detectable by smell. Odorization got its federal mandate with the passage of the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, and is now a widely accepted and implemented safety measure across the world. Natural gas is so closely associated with the smell of ethanethiol (commonly known as ethyl mercaptan) that many never know that it is added artificially.\n\nIt’s interesting to look back on an event like this with a modern lens and see just how different our world is now. There are so many parts of the story that would have played out so differently within the current system of building codes and licensure and safety measures that we largely take for granted. And that’s a good thing, right? It means that, whether directly like those new laws, or indirectly in a wide variety of ways, we’ve learned from our mistakes. In the face of such a horrific tragedy, countless lives have been saved and accidents have been averted by our ability to reckon with errors and work hard to correct them. It gives me some comfort at least. Natural gas is one of the most important resources on the planet right now. That’s not to say there are no consequences that come with it, and hopefully, we’ll grow less dependent on it over time, but it’s driven countless innovations that benefit nearly everyone in a huge variety of ways. And so, even if you had never heard of New London, Texas before now, you can feel fairly confident that, all these decades later, you’ve also benefited in some way from the hard lessons learned there in 1937.\n\n[Note that this article is a transcript of the video embedded above.]\n\nThe essence of a bridge is not just that it goes over something, but that there’s clear space underneath for a river, railway, or road. Maybe this is already obvious to you, but bridges present a unique structural challenge. In a regular road, the forces are transferred directly into the ground. On a bridge, all those forces on the span get concentrated into the piers or abutments on either side. Because of that, bridge substructures are among the strongest engineered systems on the planet. And yet, bridge foundations are built in some of the least ideal places for heavy loading. Rivers and oceans have soft, mucky soils that can’t hold much weight. Plus, obviously, a lot of them are underwater.\n\nWhat happens when you overload soil with a weight it can’t handle? In engineering-speak, it’s called a bearing failure, but it’s as simple as stepping in the mud. The foundation just sinks into the ground. But, what if you just keep loading it and causing it to sink deeper and deeper? Congratulations! You just invented one of the most widely used structural members on earth: the humble foundation pile. How do they work, and how can you install them underwater? I’m Grady, and this is Practical Engineering. Today we’re having piles of fun talking about deep foundations.\n\nI did a video all about the different types of foundations used in engineering, but I didn’t go too deep into piles. A pile is a fairly simple structural member, just a long pole driven or drilled into the ground. But, behind that simplicity is a lot of terrifically complex engineering. Volume 1 of the Federal Highway Administration’s manual on the Design and Construction of Driven Pile Foundations is over 500 pages long. There are 11 pages of symbols, 2 pages of acronyms, and you don’t even get to the introduction until page 46. And just a little further than that, you get some history of driven piles. Namely that the history has been lost to time. Humans have been hammering sticks into the ground since way before we knew how to write about it. And that’s pretty much all a driven pile is.\n\nThe first piles were made from timber, and wood is still used all these years around the world. Timber piles are cheap, resilient to driving forces, and easy to install. But, wood rots, it has an upper limit on length from the size of the tree, and it’s not that strong compared to the alternatives. Concrete piles solve a lot of those problems. They come in a variety of sizes and shapes, and again, are widely used for deep foundations. One disadvantage of concrete piles is that they have to be pretty big to withstand the force required to drive them into ground. Some concrete piles can be upwards of 30 inches or 75 centimeters wide. It is hard to hit something that big hard enough to drive it downward into soil, and a lot of ground has to either get out of the way or compress in place to make room. Steel piles solve that problem since they can be a lot more slender. Pipe piles are just what they sound like, and the other major alternative is an H-pile. Your guess is as good as mine why the same steel shape is an I-beam but an H-pile. But, no matter the material, all driven piles are installed in basically the same way.\n\nNewton’s third law applies to piles like everything else. To push one deep into the ground creates an equal and opposite reaction. You would need either an enormous weight to take advantage of gravity or some other strong structure attached to the ground to react against and develop the pushing force required to drive it downward. Instead of those two options, we usually just use a hammer. By dropping a comparatively small weight from a height, we convert the potential energy of the weight at that height into kinetic energy. The force required to stop the hammer as it falls gets transferred into the pile. Hopefully this is intuitive. It’s pretty hard to push a nail into wood, but it’s pretty easy to hammer it in... well, it’s a little bit easier to hammer it in. There are quite a few types of pile drivers, but most of them use a large hammer or vibratory head to create the forces required.\n\nMaybe it goes without saying, but the main goal of a foundation is to not move. When you apply a load, you want it to stay put. Luckily, piles have two ways to do that (at least for vertical loads). The first is end-bearing. The end, or toe, of a pile can be driven down to a layer of strong soil or hard rock, making it able to withstand greater loads. But there’s not always a firm stratum at a reasonable depth below the ground. Quote-unquote “bedrock” is a simple idea, but in practice, geology is more complicated than that. Luckily, piles have a second type of resistance: skin friction, also known as shaft resistance. When you drive a pile, it compacts and densifies the surrounding soil, not only adding strength to the soil itself, but creating friction along the walls of the pile that hold it in place. The deeper you go, the more friction you get. Let me show you what I mean.\n\nI have my own pipe pile in the backyard that I’ve marked with an arbitrary scale. When I drop the hammer at a prescribed height, the pile is driven a certain distance into the ground. Do this enough times, and eventually, you reach a point where the pile kind of stops moving with each successive hammer blow. In technical terms, the pile has reached refusal. I can graph the blow count required to drive the pile to each depth, and you get a pretty nice curve. It’s easy to see how it got stronger against vertical loads the deeper I drove it in. Toward the end, it barely moved with each hit. This is a really nice aspect of driven piles, you install them in a similar way to how they’ll be loaded by the final design. Of course, bridges and buildings don’t hammer on their foundations, but they do impose vertical loads. The tagline of the Pile Driving Contractors Association is “A Driven Pile is a Tested Pile” because, just by installing them, you’ve verified that they can withstand a certain amount of force. After all, you had to overcome that force to get them in the ground. And if you’re not seeing enough resistance, in most cases, you can just keep driving downward until you do!\n\nBut piles don’t just resist downward forces. Structures experience loads in other directions too. Buildings have horizontal, or lateral, loads from wind. Bridges see lateral loads from flowing water, and even ice or boats contacting the piers. Both can experience uplift forces that counteract gravity from floods due to buoyancy or strong winds. If you’ve ever hammered in a tent stake, you know that piles can withstand loading from all kinds of directions. And then there’s scour. The soil along a bridge might look like this right after the bridge is built, but after a few floods, it can look completely different. Engineers have to try and predict how the soil around a bridge will scour over time, from natural changes in the streambed and those created by the bridge itself. Then they make sure to design foundations that can accommodate those changes and stay strong over the long term. This is why bridge foundations sometimes look kind of funny. Loads transfer from the superstructure down into the piers. The piers sit on a pile cap that transfers and distributes loads into the piles themselves. Those piles can be vertical, but if the engineer is expecting serious lateral loads, some of the piles are often inclined, also called battered piles. Inclined piles take better advantage of the shaft resistance to make the foundation stronger against horizontal loads.\n\nAs important and beneficial as they are, driven piles have some limitations too. For one, they’re noisy and disruptive to install. Just last year, I had two friends on separate trips to Seattle who sent me a video of the exact same pile-driving operation. It’s good to have friends who know how much you like construction. But my point is, this type of construction is pretty much impossible to ignore. In dense urban areas, most people are just not willing to put up with the constant banging. Plus the vibrations from installing them can disrupt surrounding infrastructure. Pile driving is crude; in many cases, the piles aren’t designed to withstand the forces of the structure they’ll support but rather the forces they’ll have to experience during installation which are much higher. They can’t easily go through hard geological layers, cobbles, or boulders; they can wander off path, since you can’t really see where you’re going, and they can cause the ground to heave because you’re not removing any soil while you force them into the subsurface. The second major category of piles solves a lot of these problems.\n\nAnd, wouldn’t you know it? There’s an FHWA manual that has all the juicy details - Drilled Shafts: Construction Procedures and Design Methods. This one a whopping 747 pages long. A drilled shaft is also exactly what it sounds like. The basic process is pretty simple. Drill a long hole into the ground. Place reinforcing steel in the hole. Then fill the whole thing with concrete. But, bridge piers are often, as you probably know, installed underwater. Pouring concrete underwater is a little tricky. Imagine trying to pour a smoothie at the bottom of a pool! Let me show you what I mean.\n\nThis is my garage-special bridge foundation simulator. It has transparent soil in the form of superabsorbent polymer beads… and you know we have to add some blue water too. You can probably imagine how easy it might be to drill a hole in this soil. It’s just going to collapse in on itself. We need a way to keep the hole open so the rebar and concrete can be installed. So, drilled shafts installed in soft soils or wet conditions usually rely on a casing to support the walls. Installing a casing usually happens while the hole is drilled, following the auger downward. I tried that myself, but I only have two hands, and it was pretty unwieldy. So, just for the sake of the demo, I’m advancing the casing into the soil ahead of time. Now I can drill out the soil to open the shaft. And now I’m realizing the limitations of my soil simulant. It was still pretty hard to do, even with the casing in place. It took a few tries, but I managed to get most of it out.\n\nSo now I have an open hole, but it’s still full of water. Even if your casing runs above the water surface, and you try to pump it out, you can still have water leaking in from the bottom. In ideal conditions, you can get a nice seal between the bottom of the casing and the soil, but even then, it’s pretty hard to keep water out of the hole, and luckily it doesn’t matter.\n\nInstead of concrete, I’m using bentonite clay as a substitute. It’s got a similar density, and it’s perfect for this demo because you can push it through a small tube… if you get the proportions right. Ask me how I know. This is me pondering the life decisions that led up to me holding a gigantic syringe full of bentonite slurry in my garage. You can’t just drop this stuff through the water. It mixes and dilutes, just turning into a mess. Same is true for concrete. The ratio of water to cement in a concrete mix is essential to its strength and performance, so you can’t do anything that would add water to the mix. The trick is a little device called a tremie. Even though it has a funny name, it’s nothing more than a pipe that runs to the bottom of the hole. As long as you keep the end of the tremie below the surface of the concrete that you’re pumping in, or concrete simulant in my case, there’s no chance for it to mix with the water and dilute. I’m just pushing the clay into the casing with a big syringe, making sure to keep the end of the tube buried. Because concrete is a lot more dense than water, it just displaces it upward, out of the hole.\n\nIn underwater installations, the casing is often left in place. One advantage is that you can build a floating pile cap. Instead of building a big cofferdam and drying out the work area to construct a big concrete structure, sometimes you can raise the pile cap into or above the water surface, reducing the complexity of its construction. These “high rise” pile caps are used a lot in offshore wind turbines. But, not all casings are permanent.\n\nIn some situations, it’s possible to pull the casing once the hole is full of concrete, saving the sometimes enormous cost of each gigantic steel tube. I tried to show this in my demo. It’s not beautiful, but it did work. Again, the concrete is dense, so the pressure it exerts on the walls of the hole is enough to keep the soil from collapsing. And because drilled shafts can be much larger than driven piles, sometimes you don’t even need a group of them. Lots of structures, including wind turbines, highway signs, and more, are built on mono-pile foundations. Just a single drilled shaft deep in the ground, eliminating the need for a pile cap altogether. Another interesting aspect of drilled shafts is that you can ream out the bottom, creating an enlarged base that increases the surface area at the toe. This helps reduce a pile’s tendency to sink, and it can help with uplift resistance too.\n\nDriven piles and drilled shafts are far from the only types of deep foundation systems. There are tons of variations on the idea that have been developed over the years to solve specific challenges: Continuous flight auger piles do the drilling and concreting in essentially one step, using a hollow-stem auger to fill the hole as it’s removed. Then reinforcement is lowered into the wet concrete. You can fill a hole with compacted aggregate instead of concrete, called a stone column or tradename Geopier if you’re only worried about compressive loads. Helical or screw piles twist into the ground, instead of being hammered, reducing vibrations and disturbance. Micropiles are like tiny drilled shafts used when there are access restrictions or geologic constraints. And of course, there are sheet piles that aren’t really used for foundations but are driven piles meant to create a wall or barrier. Let me know if I forgot to mention your favorite flavor of pile.\n\nEven though they’re usually much stronger than shallow foundations, piles can and do fail. We’ve talked about San Francisco’s famous Millennium Tower in a previous video. That’s a skyscraper on a pile foundation that sank into the ground, causing the building to tilt. It seems like they mostly have it fixed now, but it’s still in the news every so often, so only time will tell. In 2004, a bridge pier on the Lee Roy Selmon Expressway in Tampa, Florida sank 11 feet (more than 3 meters) while it was still under construction because of the complicated geology. It cost 90 million dollars to fix and delayed the project’s completion by a year. These case studies highlight the complexity of geotechnical engineering when we ask the ground to hold up heavier and heavier loads. The science and technology that goes into designing deep foundations are enough to spend an entire career studying, but hopefully, this video gives you a little insight into how they work.\n\n[Note that this article is a transcript of the video embedded above.]\n\nOn January 28, 2022, about an hour before dawn, the four-lane Fern Hollow Bridge in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, collapsed without warning. Five vehicles, including an articulating bus, fell with the bridge, and another car drove off the abutment after the collapse, not realizing the bridge was gone. Although there were no fatalities, several people in the vehicles were seriously injured. And this bridge had been listed as being in ‘poor condition’ for over a decade. Anyone who walked by the supports in the park below would have had reason to question its safety, as seen in this sadly prophetic tweet from 2018, four years before the collapse. So, why was it left open in this state?\n\nWhile some initial findings were released earlier, the official NTSB report was delivered to the public this year in February, more than two years after the collapse and over a year after the replacement bridge was built and open. The report included the use of some really cool technology for the forensic study of structures and revealed systemic flaws in how we inspect, analyze, and prioritize repairs for bridges. In fact, the NTSB issued recommendations to basically every organization involved in this bridge from the bottom to the top, and they referenced that tweet that got so much attention. This is a crazy case study of how common sense can fall through the cracks of strained budgets and rigid oversight from federal, state, and city staff. And the lessons that came out of it aren’t just relevant to people who work on bridges. It's a story of how numerous small mistakes by individuals can collectively lead to a tragedy. I’m Grady, and this is Practical Engineering.\n\nThe Fern Hollow Bridge was opened in 1973, replacing an aging arch bridge built at the beginning of the 20th century, crossing Frick Park and Fern Hollow Creek. The 1973 bridge used a K-Frame design with continuous steel girders supporting the deck, each with two angled steel legs supported on concrete thrust blocks. At the time, the bridge’s design was celebrated because it blended well into its settings. It was featured on the cover of the 1974 edition of Prize Bridges by the American Institute of Steel Construction. And a big part of why it looked so harmonious with the park below was the type of steel used for the design.\n\nThe Fern Hollow bridge was fabricated from weathering steel, sometimes referred to by its genericized trademark, COR-TEN. And it was developed commercially right there in Pittsburgh by US Steel in the 1930s. Unlike most types of steel, whose rust can continually flake away, exposing more material to corrosion, the oxide layer on weathering steel (called its patina) is more stable and protective, shielding the underlying material against exposure to the elements. In that way, weathering steel acts kind of like aluminum, which protects itself from corrosion in a similar way. And, architecturally, it’s a nice material. You get this rustic look that can give structures a more comfortable and less obtrusive appearance. But weathering steel has a limitation: For a stable patina to form, the material has to stay mostly dry. If water pools or the steel is kept damp for extended periods, that patina of rust isn’t enough to protect the underlying steel, and it will continue to corrode. Corrosion of structural steel is called section loss by engineers, and it's easy to see why in these photos of the bridge.\n\nWhat’s more alarming than what’s in those photos is where they came from: inspection reports of the bridge. It’s not that this deterioration somehow went unnoticed. The bridge supports were clearly visible from a popular walking trail. Between 2005 and 2021, this bridge was inspected a total of 14 times! In those reports, you get a clear and vivid story of its decline. First were the drainage problems. You can see in these images from multiple previous bridge inspections there were drainage grates on the roadway that were 100 percent clogged. Rainwater, and even worse, salty meltwater from the frequent snow that Pittsburgh sees each winter couldn’t follow the prescribed drainage paths off the deck and into the creek below. Instead, that water would leak through the bridge deck, dribbling over the structural steel, and pooling in portions of the legs where webbing and tie-plates could catch puddles of water, leaves, and debris.\n\nThe City was aware of the section loss due to these drainage problems for many years before the collapse. Nearly every inspection report noted problems with the drains and the accelerating corrosion that was resulting. In fact, in 2009, the cross-braces connecting each pair of legs were found to be failing, and steel cables were installed as a temporary retrofit until the framing could be replaced. These cables were lightly tensioned to add structural integrity to the bridge but were never meant to be a permanent solution.\n\nYou can see the ends of two of these cables in this now-infamous tweet from 2018. Of course, the more notable feature of this image is the fully separated steel cross-brace! That photo was taken about nine years after the temporary cables were installed. And they remained in place for the rest of the bridge's life, which ended up being only four more years. But the cross-bracing between the legs wasn’t the only place where corrosion was an issue. The legs themselves were also fabricated from weathering steel, and that steel was suffering, too. Since 2005, inspection reports marked them in fair to poor condition with areas where the steel had completely rusted through. By 2019, all four legs were given the worst assessment possible for an individual bridge element. According to the code, that should trigger a structural review to check whether the integrity is affected by the poor condition of a structural element, but it was never done. And that’s not all.\n\nAn important part of inspecting steel bridges is identifying members that are “fracture critical.” That’s engineering jargon, but the idea is actually pretty straightforward. It’s any piece of steel under tension that lacks redundancy. If it breaks, the bridge collapses. And these types of members get special attention because of their importance, so inspection teams identify them ahead of time to make sure they get a proper look. This drawing shows in green which elements of the bridge were considered to be fracture-critical. Notice that while the girders crossing the span are identified, the legs are not. And, at first glance, that might match your intuitions. Bridge piers, columns, and vertical supports usually don’t experience tension forces, right? They’re in compression. So if there’s a crack or break, the forces just squeeze it together, generally not that big a deal. But K-frame bridges are different. By splaying out the legs, there are loading conditions that can apply bending forces, putting part of each beam in tension. And, this particular bridge had another feature that was absolutely essential to its performance.\n\nEach leg of the bridge was essentially an I-beam: a central web with a top and bottom flange. To simplify the foundation design, each leg had a “shoe”: a tapered end that would connect to the concrete block. It’s clear that the narrower section would have less strength, so larger stiffeners were added to each shoe to strengthen that portion of the leg. These are just steel plates welded to the web and flanges to increase the leg’s rigidity. And I built a little cardboard model to clarify this point. This particular stiffener, called the transverse tie plate, bridges the two flanges right where they taper down. And if I apply a compressive force on the leg, it’s easy to see what kind of force that tie plate experiences as a result. It’s tension. These tie plates were fracture-critical members of the bridge, but never identified as such, and so, even though it was clear they were deteriorating quickly over time, the inspectors never elevated the concerns to a priority level that might have spurred a more immediate response. But there was another opportunity to catch the problem.\n\nIn 2013, an inspector was concerned enough about the bridge's safety to recommend that it be reviewed for a load rating. Most bridges are designed to allow any legal load to pass over, but sometimes, either because of an old design or poor structural conditions, it's necessary to limit the weight of vehicles allowed. Engineers analyzed the bridge in 2014 and decided it could only handle 26 tons per vehicle, just over half of its previous rating. When NTSB reviewed that decision in hindsight, they found some pretty serious errors.\n\nFor one, the load rating for the bridge was based on a layer of about 3 inches of asphalt paving on top of the concrete road deck. In reality, the bridge had about double that amount. The City’s records of the removal and addition of pavement were poorly kept, so the engineering firm doing the load rating had no idea there was so much extra weight. For two, the engineers didn’t fully account for all the corrosion on the legs. This was partly because inspectors hadn’t cleaned off the rust to measure and report the actual thickness of the remaining steel. Even so, the engineers used a method that distributed the section loss from corrosion evenly along the entire leg, instead of applying it where it actually was, at the shoes and tie plates. That’s a pretty commonly-used simplification that usually generates conservative results (since the worst corrosion is rarely located at the most critical part of a structure), but again, that wasn’t the case for the Fern Hollow Bridge, and no one had recognized how important those tie plates really were.\n\nAnd for three, those engineers made an incorrect assumption about how the bridge’s legs would buckle. A structural member under compression will buckle at different loads depending on how much restraint it has at the ends. This is something you learn in year one of engineering. If you keep a column from rotating at its ends, you substantially increase the amount of force it can withstand, and with the original cross-bracing between the legs, that would have been the case. But I’m sure I don’t have to tell you that steel cables don’t provide the same support as rigid members. Again, this is engineering 101: “You can’t push a rope.” The cables provided some restraint, but not in the same way that the original bracing could, so the load rating applied to the bridge ended up significantly overestimating its actual capacity. In fact, when NTSB updated the load rating with these errors fixed, they found that the bridge should have been limited to 3 tons, basically nothing for a bridge. In effect, this load rating exercise should have closed the bridge to traffic entirely. These structural issues were exactly what the process was meant to identify. But instead, the bridge stayed open to everyone except the largest of trucks,and here’s what happened, courtesy of NTSB’s animation team.\n\nThe transverse tie plate on the southwest leg, weakened by corrosion, failed first under tension, separating the flanges on the leg, and ultimately causing it to buckle. With no redundancy in the supports, the loads had nowhere to go, and so the rest of the bridge fell into the valley below. The articulated bus had both rear-facing and forward-facing cameras on it, which captured some truly harrowing footage of the event. Looking at the rear-facing camera, you can see the western portion of the bridge begin to fail. Keep an eye on the railing, and you can see the exact moment it starts. Once it started, there was no stopping it. Within two seconds, the front-facing camera shows that the collapse had propagated all the way to the eastern abutment, and the bridge fully failed.\n\nThankfully, the collapse happened during particularly inclement weather. School delays and generally poor conditions meant that traffic was lighter than normal, and the weather also likely kept folks away from the trail underneath. On a fair weather day during rush hour, it wouldn’t be uncommon for the eastbound lanes of the bridge to be fully occupied by heavy traffic, and the trail underneath to be populated with dog walkers, families, or even classes on field trips from nearby schools. The bridge also carried a large gas line, which was severed during the collapse, leading to a major leak and some evacuations, but they got it shut off in time. It really is remarkable that nobody was killed in a failure of this magnitude. But there were still multiple victims needlessly affected for the rest of their lives by the collapse, not to mention the overall erosion of trust in the organizations and engineering systems meant to keep the public safe.\n\nBy pure happenstance, President Biden was set to arrive in Pittsburgh on the very day of the collapse to speak in support of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, so he rearranged his trip to make some remarks at the site. One of the entities supported by the act is the National Highway Performance Program, which ultimately funded the replacement of the collapsed bridge. But at that time, no one understood the full scope of neglect and bad assumptions that led to the gradual, and then sudden, demise of the bridge. In those two years after Fern Hollow Bridge fell, the NTSB conducted numerous interviews with those involved, from the paving contractors to the inspectors to the bridge rating engineers. They performed 3D laser scanning of the bridge components to compare them to as-built conditions. They tested sections of steel for strength and durability. They reviewed all the previous records of the design, construction, and repairs. And they built a detailed finite-element model of the bridge to confirm that the gradual corrosion of one small structural element, the transverse tie plate on the southwest leg, initiated the collapse. And then they documented why it got to that point: the City of Pittsburgh just didn’t fix it.\n\nThis figure in the NTSB report tells the story as clearly as I think is possible. From 2005 onward, recommendations from inspection reports to repair parts of the bridge didn’t fall off the list. They just kept being repeated by each new inspection, year after year. Since 2007, every single inspection report that included recommendations said to repair the stiffener plates in the legs that were heavily corroded. These were Priority 2 recommendations, which means the timeframe to complete them is before the next inspection. But it was never done. They didn’t fix the drainage problems that were accelerating the corrosion, they didn’t apply the protective coatings that might have slowed it down, and they never analyzed the capacity of the legs after they were rated the worst possible condition a structural element can have. And, apparently, there was no mechanism to follow up on those recommendations by the state charged with overseeing the bridge inspection program. When there was finally a chance to recognize how deficient the structure really was through a new load rating, the engineers made a few bad assumptions, missed it by a mile, and left the bridge open, a ticking time bomb, for years. (Years, by the way, in which the City still didn’t address the recommendations from inspection reports.)\n\nDue to the nature of the emergency, the site was cleaned up quickly, with a huge crane brought in to remove the bus, and building of the replacement bridge happened on a fast-track schedule. The new bridge uses a more conventional design: pre-stressed concrete girders on vertical piers. The formed stone texture on the columns certainly doesn’t blend into the park as well as the graceful and patinaed K-frame once did, but I doubt anyone involved in the project could stomach another structure built from weathering steel, given the circumstances. The new bridge might not win any awards for beauty, but it could win some for speed. After a colossal effort from the design and construction teams, it opened to limited traffic less than a year after the collapse in December of 2022, and by July the next year, it was fully operational. It would be almost a year later before the NTSB concluded why the previous bridge collapsed, not for the purpose of blame, but to issue recommendations to prevent something like this from recurring in the future. And unlike the recommendations from those inspection reports, many of the NTSB recommendations have already been put into practice.\n\nThey published a special report on weathering steel bridges to highlight the specific challenges of keeping them in good condition, and they identified several similar bridges that needed a closer look. The City of Pittsburgh quadrupled their spending on inspection, maintenance, and repairs. And they redid the load ratings on all the bridges they owned, resulting in one bridge being closed until it can be rehabilitated and two more having lane restrictions imposed. PennDOT released a technical bulletin to shore up their bridge inspection program. And even the federal government has implemented a process to identify, prioritize, and follow up on recommendations related to weathering steel bridges.\n\nBut as I read through those recommendations from the NTSB, one thing struck me: They all add up to more paperwork. And this is just my own personal opinion as someone who did this kind of work for nearly a decade (not on bridges, but other large infrastructure projects). We have these national inspection standards and procedures - huge documents that you could spend an entire career understanding. We have the Federal Highway Administration overseeing the program, state DOTs charged with carrying it out, individual bridge owners, like Pittsburgh, responsible for inspecting their own bridges, and then the private contractors who do most of the actual work. We have this huge machine with thousands of people, federal, state, and local involvement, and millions of dollars meant to keep the traveling public safe. And what did it do for us when a photo like this is all it would take any reasonable person to say: “This bridge needs to be fixed”?\n\nThis big machine, in a lot of cases, has all the work sectionalized out. The inspectors see the bridge up close, but they have no autonomy to do anything but document and give recommendations. It’s not their bridge. But the owners who are charged with the safety of their bridges just see a piece of paper. Each recommendation is just another one on the list of sometimes hundreds of action items, to sort and prioritize and try to find the budget to cover. All the NTSB recommendations feel a little bit like bandaids if the real source of the problem was that no one person in this whole machine had both a full appreciation of the bridge's condition and the authority to do something about it. And if that’s the case, I’m not sure any of those recommendations really fixes that problem. I don’t know what the answer is, and I’m still wrestling with trying to understand how something like this can fall through the cracks of the enormous system we’ve built for the sole purpose of trying to prevent it.\n\nIf you take a walk on the Tranquil Trail through Frick Park beside Fern Hollow Creek and look carefully, you can still see remnants of the old bridge. And I’m glad the City left them, because they’re a good reminder that design and construction are two parts of a three-part system for keeping people safe. Maintaining infrastructure is thankless work. Don’t get me wrong, it can be a really rewarding career. Inspections involve a lot of time out in the field seeing cool structures up close. And repair projects are often interesting challenges for contractors. But they’re not rewarding in the same way that designing and building new stuff can be. No one holds a press conference and cuts a big ribbon at the end of a bridge inspection or structural retrofit. Building a new structure is not just an achievement in its own right; it’s a commitment to take good care of it for its entire design life, and then to rehabilitate, or replace, or even close it when it’s no longer safe for the public. And I think this is the perfect case study to show that there’s more we could do to encourage and celebrate that kind of work as well.\n\n[Note that this article is a transcript of the video embedded above.]\n\nIn March of 1989, Earth experienced one of its strongest geomagnetic storms in modern history. It all started when scientists observed a cluster of sunspots—active, magnetic areas on the sun's surface—emerging on its horizon. Over the next few days, the sun slowly rotated until the region began to point directly at Earth. Just as it did, two solar flares erupted from the sunspots. Accompanying the flares were coronal mass ejections: huge bursts of solar wind, essentially charged particles from the sun. The coronal mass ejections eventually crashed into the earth’s magnetic field, causing it to squish and compress and ultimately induce electric currents at the surface.\n\nIn Quebec, Canada, the rapid changes in magnetic fields would have mostly gone unnoticed by people, but they didn’t go unnoticed by the power grid. The region’s unique geology, a shield of hard rock that is a poor conductor of electricity, kept these induced currents from dissipating into the ground. So they found another path: the electrical transmission lines. The geomagnetic storm ended up blacking out a large part of the Hydro-Quebec power grid for nine hours. And the first domino of the collapse (or rather the first seven) were pieces of equipment known as static compensators. But to understand how static compensators work and why a solar flare could trip them offline, you kind of have to start with the basics.\n\nYou might know that most parts of all modern power grids use alternating current or AC. The voltage and current on the lines slosh back and forth, 50 or 60 cycles per second, depending on where you live. If you love power electronics, that low, dull, AC hum might be music to your ears. But if this is kind of new to you, alternating current can be a little bit mysterious. What’s even weirder is that, even though the current constantly alternates its polarity, electrical power only moves in one direction… under ideal conditions. And geomagnetic storms aren’t the only thing that can make the grid behave in funny ways. There are devices even in your own home that force the grid to produce power and move it through the system, even though they aren’t even consuming it. Let’s go out to the garage, and I can show you what I mean. I’m Grady, and this is Practical Engineering. In today’s episode, we’re talking about how power actually flows on the grid.\n\nI’ve built a model power grid here in the shop. (Not the first time I’ve said that, and it probably won’t be the last.) I’ll keep it simple at first and build up the complexity as I explain these concepts. And Zap McBody slam is back in the shop to help out. My grid has one power source, right now just a battery, a transmission line to carry the power, and a load (in this case, an incandescent light bulb). It’s probably not the most interesting circuit you’ve ever seen. But like I said, understanding the basics of power flow is essential to understanding the more complicated, and I think, the more interesting aspects of how it works on a huge scale. So, here’s a one-minute refresher on electrical circuits:\n\nThere are really only four numbers that matter the most in a circuit. First is voltage, the difference in electric potential between two locations. In the classic pipe analogy, voltage is the pressure that drives water to flow from one side to the other. In my circuit, the battery is supplying about 10 volts across the bulb. Next is current, the flow of electric charge. In the pipe analogy, this is the flow rate of the water. In my circuit, I can measure the current as 1.2 amps. Third is resistance, the opposition to the flow of current. It’s the size of the pipe. Incandescent bulbs actually change their resistance depending on voltage, so it can’t be measured directly with a meter. That’s okay, though, because all three of these values are related to each other. That relationship, called Ohm’s law, is about as simple as it gets. Voltage is equal to current times resistance. If you know two, you can find the other one with some basic math. For example, 10.1 volts flowing at 1.2 amps means the resistance of my lightbulb is around 8 ohms. The final number we care about is power, the transfer of energy. Power does the actual work, in this case, creating light and heat in the bulb. Calculating power is as simple as multiplying the voltage and the current together. 10 volts times 1.2 amps tells me that this bulb is dissipating 12 watts. That’s electrical engineering in a nutshell, and it’s relatively straightforward for a circuit like this that uses direct current or DC, because none of our important numbers change. But, as I mentioned, that’s not true on the grid.\n\nLet me swap out the battery with a transformer plugged into an outlet and see what happens. At first glance, there’s no change. The bulb is still lighting, just like it did with the battery. I can measure the voltage by switching my meter to AC: 8.4 volts, not too far from the DC circuit. I can measure the current with this clamp over meter: 1.2 amps, same as before. But those are just simplifications of what’s really happening on the lines. To see that, we need a different piece of equipment. This oscilloscope measures voltage over time and plots it as a graph on the screen. And I can insert a resistor into the circuit and use a second probe to plot the voltage across that resistor as a simple way of measuring current. “So the yellow will be the voltage, and the green will be the current.” You can see that neither the voltage nor the current are constant… unless you trip over all the cords. They’re switching directions over and over again. This might not be too surprising to you yet, but watch what happens if I switch out the lightbulb with a different kind of load. Let’s try a capacitor.\n\nThis is a device that stores energy in an electric field between two plates. You see them everywhere in electrical circuits, and they do a funny thing on the grid. When I insert the capacitor to my circuit, the graph of voltage and current looks different because they’re no longer in phase. “Hey… that worked perfectly.” The current waveform is leading the voltage; the current peaks happen before the voltage ones. That’s because the current has to flow into the capacitor before the voltage between the plates rises. It takes time for the capacitor to charge and discharge, which results in a delayed response in the voltage. Now, let’s try another type of load called an inductor.\n\nAn inductor is basically a coil of wire. Like a capacitor, an inductor stores energy, but instead of an electric field, it stores that energy in a magnetic field. This is just an electromagnet like you might see in a scrapyard. If I swap in an air-core inductor, you can hear the screwdriver rattle against the table as the magnetic field rapidly changes direction. And, we get the opposite effect of the capacitor when the inductor is inserted into the circuit. This time, the current waveform is lagging the voltage. That magnetic field resists changes in current, so it creates a delay, this time in the current waveform. I can even vary this inductance and thus the lag in the current by moving this ferrite rod in and out of the core. All this is interesting on its own, but these little shifts in a graph have serious implications on the grid, and have even resulted in numerous blackouts across the world. Here’s why:\n\nRemember, that the power consumed by an electrical load is just the voltage multiplied by the current. We can do that for any point in time across this graph. For a purely resistive load, like the lightbulb, the current and voltage are in sync. When one is positive, the other is positive. When one is negative, the other is too. So when you multiply them together at any point along the graph, you always get a positive number. The power fluctuates, but it’s always moving in one direction. For a reactive load (the term used for inductors and capacitors), that’s no longer the case. There are times in the cycle when the current and voltage are opposite polarity, meaning, instead of being consumed, power is actually flowing out of the load. In fact, for a purely capacitive or inductive load, there’s no power consumption at all - no work being done. It’s just stored in a magnetic or electric field and returned. But there’s still current flowing, and that matters.\n\nOf course, most things connected to the power grid aren’t purely reactive. But lots of devices that we plug in have some amount of inductance. Look around your home for any big motors. Air conditioners, refrigerators, washers, dryers, large power tools, and more primarily use induction motors because they’re cheap, simple, and last a long time. And inside an induction motor is a series of wire coils used to create magnetic fields that spin the rotor, just like the inductor I used in the demo. Part of the power that flows into those coils just gets sent back out onto the grid. You might be thinking, “So What? Nothing wrong with storing a little bit of energy, as long as I give it back in less than a sixtieth of a second afterwards.” But, the grid still had to produce that power, and more importantly, deliver that power to your home and carry it back away.\n\nThe electric meter at your home, in most cases, only tracks the power you actually consume. So, you don’t pay for the reactive power that flows into your devices and back out again. But that doesn’t mean it doesn’t come at a cost. It still has to flow through the power network, where some gets lost as heat from resistance in the lines. So, the generators have to make, and the transmission lines have to move, more power, in some cases a lot more power, than is actually being used in the system. Reactive power can make up a big part of the total load on the system, even though it’s not doing any work. Just having the infrastructure in place to handle it is also costly. The conductors, transformers, and generators on the grid have to be sized for the total current that needs to move through the system, not just the current that does work. And that stuff is expensive. It’s like if you were a photographer and bought a bunch of props for a shoot from a company with a generous return policy. After you take your photos, you return everything back to the store. Those props were useful, even necessary to you, but only for a period of time. And there was a real cost to warehousing, transporting, and restocking them, even if you didn’t bear it. Imagine if there were a hundred photographers that did the same thing. It wouldn’t be long before such a store wasn’t very profitable. But unlike at your home, where the utility is generous in their return policy, lots of industrial and commercial customers do get charged for reactive power that uses up capacity on the grid without doing any real work.\n\nEven though the oscilloscope graphs just show a shift between the two waveforms, with some clever math, you can actually separate the real power actually being used from the reactive power that oscillates on the grid into two parts, and treat them like they flow through the grid independently. I’m going to do my best to avoid that math here partly because it involves imaginary numbers but mostly because it’s not needed to understand the practical impacts. (This is already a lot to wrap your head around.) But out of that math comes this visualization: the power triangle. This leg is the real power that actually gets consumed, measured in watts or kilowatts that you’re probably used to. This leg is the reactive power that is returned instead of used, measured in volt-amps-reactive or VAR. By convention, we usually say that inductive devices “consume” reactive power and capacitive devices “supply” it. The hypotenuse of the triangle is the apparent power, the total amount of power that flows through the grid, measured in volt-amps. If you divide the real power by the apparent power, you get this ratio, called the power factor, a number that will be important in a minute.\n\nTake a look at the distribution transformer that connects your home to the grid, and you might see a rating on the side. That number is not in watts or kilowatts like what you might see on a toaster or microwave, but in kilovolt-amps because it includes the flow of real and reactive power. Large users of electricity, like factories and refineries, usually have a low power factor because they use lots of big induction motors. They need comparatively robust and high-capacity connections to the grid, even if they actually consume only a portion of the energy that flows through. So the electric utility installs a meter that can track power factor, or they just come out every once in a while to measure it, so they can put it on the bill. Instead of free returns on reactive power, like we usually get at our homes, those customers have to pay a rental charge on the power they store, even though it goes right back out. But, it’s not just a matter of keeping track of costs. The stability of the entire grid depends on managing the flow of reactive power.\n\nIf you’ve watched some of my other videos on the power grid, you know how important it is to closely match power generation with demands as they go up and down. If not managed carefully, the frequency of the grid, which needs to stay within a very tight tolerance, can deviate. And if it goes too far, the whole thing can collapse. That’s what almost happened to Texas during the winter storm in 2021. But, it’s possible for the grid to collapse even if there’s enough generation to meet the demand because you still have to move that power to where it’s needed over transmission lines. Engineers use a PV curve to keep an eye on this challenge. It relates the power flowing to a load on the system to the voltage it sees. As you would expect, the more power that flows, the more the voltage drops, since more power is lost on the transmission lines on the way to the load. It’s the same reason the lights dim in old houses when the air conditioner kicks on: current goes up, voltage goes down. If you combine Ohm’s law and the power equation, you can see that the power lost on a transmission line is related to the current squared. Double the amps; quadruple the power lost as heat. But the further along this curve that the system operates, the more dangerous things get. There is a point, the nose of the curve, beyond which greater demand on the system actually reduces the amount of power that can be delivered, all while the voltage continues dropping. The generators may have the capacity to supply more power, but it can’t reach the load because of the limitations of the system. Operating below the nose is unstable because generators lose control of their speed, like a rubber tire losing its grip on a road.\n\nInfrastructure is expensive, and building new power plants and transmission lines always comes with legal and environmental challenges too, so we’re often forced to use the grid to the very limits of its capacity. But, grid managers need to make sure to operate with enough margin that any contingency, like a generator going offline or a transmission line faulting, doesn’t push the system over the electrical cliff. Here’s where power factor comes in. Loads with lower power factor shift the nose of the PV curve down and to the left. That reduces the margin and lowers the voltages in the system for a given power demand, making a voltage collapse more likely if some part of the system goes down. So we use several ways to supply reactive power to provide voltage support and shift the curve back up.\n\nPower plants can adjust their operating parameters to supply reactive power, but transmission lines have their own inductance that consumes the reactive power as it travels through. So, it is usually more efficient to address the problem on the load side, and there are several types of infrastructure that make this possible. Synchronous condensers are big motors that aren’t attached to anything. Instead of converting electrical power to mechanical power, they basically spin freely, but with some clever circuitry, they can generate or absorb reactive power from the grid. They can also help stabilize fluctuations in the grid with the inertia of their heavy rotating mass, something that is becoming increasingly important as we transition more to renewable sources that use inverters to connect to the network.\n\nAnother option, and one you’re more likely to spot, are shunt capacitor banks connected across the lines. Sometimes you can see them in substations, but many capacitor banks are installed on poles out in the open for anyone to have a look. Like the capacitor in my demo, they increase the power factor and boost the PV curve up. That can actually become a problem during off-peak hours by boosting the voltage above where it should be, so many capacitor banks are switched on or off depending on system conditions. Looking back at the PV curve, you can see how leaving the capacitors off during periods of low demand keeps voltage within limits, and having them on when demand is high provides more margin and more voltage. Some run on timers to come on during the highest demands of the day, and many are operated at a utility’s discretion to accommodate the varying conditions on the grid. They’re usually either all the way on or all the way off, so deciding when to throw the switch is an important one.\n\nA third option for reactive power supply, called a static VAR compensator or SVC, addresses that challenge. These use electronics to rapidly switch inductors and capacitors on or off to constantly adjust to conditions in the system. That switching happens automatically and quickly, making them much better suited to the dynamic changes that happen on the grid.\n\nThat’s why Hydro-Quebec had them installed on their system in 1989. The long transmission lines between the hydroelectric power plants in the north and the load centers, like Montreal, in the south require careful control of the voltage to avoid instability. But the geomagnetic storm threw a wrench in the works. The induced currents in the transformers and along those transmission lines seriously increased the reactive power demand of the system. The resulting distortions in the voltage and current waveforms hadn’t been considered when the equipment was installed. The SVCs weren’t configured to handle the dynamic conditions affecting the system, so relays designed to protect them tripped, pulling the equipment out of service. Without the SVCs, the voltage on the grid dropped, the frequency increased, and chaos ensued. The grid operators couldn’t disconnect customers fast enough to keep things stable, and within seconds, the rest of the system collapsed. Lots of equipment was permanently damaged, and millions woke up that frigid morning with no real power, reactive power, or apparent power, shutting down basically the entire province for half-a-day and requiring costly and expensive repairs. They learned a lot of lessons that day, and adjusted a lot of relay settings since then. It’s just one of many case studies on the importance of understanding and managing this hopefully a little-less-perplexing idea of reactive power on the grid.\n\n[Note that this article is a transcript of the video embedded above.]\n\nThe Earth is pretty cool and all, but many of its most magnificent features make it tough for us to get around. When the topography is too wet, steep, treacherous, or prone to disaster, sometimes the only way forward is up: our roadways and walkways and railways break free from the surface using bridges. A lot of the infrastructure we rely on day to day isn’t necessarily picturesque. It’s not that we can’t build exquisite electrical transmission lines or stunning sanitary sewers. It’s just that we rarely want to bear the cost. But bridges are different. To an enthusiast of constructed works, many are downright breathtaking. There are so many ways to cross a gap, all kindred in function but contrary in form. And the typical way that engineers classify and name them is in how each design manages the incredible forces involved. Like everything in engineering, terminology and categories vary. As Alfred Korzybski said, “The map is not the territory.” But, trying to list them all is at least a chance to learn some new words and see some cool bridges. And honestly, I can hardly think of anything more worthwhile than that. I’m Grady, and this is Practical Engineering.\n\nOne of the simplest structural crossings is the beam bridge: just a horizontal member across two supports. That member can take a variety of forms, including a rolled steel beam (sometimes called a stringer) or a larger steel member fabricated from plates (often called a plate girder). Most modern bridges built as overpasses for grade separation between traffic are beam bridges that use concrete girders. And instead of a group of individual beams, many bridges use box girders, which are essentially closed structural tubes that use material more efficiently (but can be more complicated to construct). Beam bridges usually can’t span great distances because the girders required would be too large. At a certain distance, the beams become so heavy, they can hardly support their own weight, let alone the roadway and traffic on top.\n\nOne way around the challenge of the structural members’ self-weight is to use a truss instead of a girder. A truss is an assembly of smaller elements that creates a rigid and lightweight structure. Unlike a beam, the members of a truss don’t typically experience bending forces. The connections usually aren’t actual hinges that permit free rotation, but they are close enough. So, all the load is axial (along their length) in compression or tension. That simplifies the design process because it’s easier to predict the forces within each structural member. The weight reduction allows trusses to span greater distances than solid beams, and there are a wide variety of arrangements, many with their own specific names. In general, a through truss puts the deck on the bottom level, and a deck truss puts it on top, hiding the structural members below the road. A particularly photogenic type of truss is a lenticular truss bridge, named because they resemble lenses, which themselves are named because they resemble lentils! A Bailey bridge is a kind of temporary truss bridge that is designed to be portable and easy to assemble. They were designed during World War II, but Bailey bridges are still used today as temporary crossings when a bridge fails or gets closed for construction. Most covered bridges are timber truss bridges. Since wood is more susceptible to damage from exposure to the elements, the roof and siding are placed to keep the structural elements truss-worthy. A trestle bridge is superficially similar to a truss: a framework of smaller members. Trestle bridges don’t have long spans, but rather a continuous series of short spans with frequent supports which are individually called trestles, but sometimes the whole bridge is just called a trestle, so like so many other instances of structural terminology, it can be a little confusing.\n\nThis next bridge type uses a structural feature that’s been a favorite of builders for millennia: the arch. Instead of beams loaded perpendicularly or trusses that experience both compressive and tensile forces, arch bridges use a curved element to transfer the bridge’s weight to supports using compression forces alone. Many of the oldest bridges used arches because it was the only way to span a gap with materials available at the time (stone and mortar). Even now, with the convenience of modern steel and concrete, arches are a popular choice for bridges. They make efficient use of materials but can be challenging to construct because the arch can’t provide its support until it is complete. Temporary supports are often required during construction until the arch is connected at its apex from both sides. In stone arches, the topmost stone is key to keeping the whole thing standing, and, of course, it’s called the keystone. When the arch is below the roadway, we call it a deck arch bridge. Vertical supports transfer the load of the deck onto the arch. The area between the deck and arch has a great name: the spandrel. Open-spandrel bridges use columns to transfer loads, and closed-spandrel bridges use continuous walls. If part of the arch extends above the roadway with the deck suspended below, it’s called a through arch bridge. A moon bridge is kind of an exaggerated arch bridge, usually reserved for pedestrians over narrow canals where there’s not enough room for long approaches. They’re steep, so sometimes you have to use steps or ladders to get up to the top and back down.\n\nOne result of compressing an arch is that it creates horizontal forces called thrusts. Arch bridges usually need strong abutments at either side to push against that can withstand the extra horizontal loads. Alternatively, a tied arch bridge uses a chord to connect both sides of the arch like a bowstring, so it can resist the thrust forces. That means a tied arch is structurally more of a truss than an arch, and that provides a lot of opportunities for creativity. For just one example, a network arch bridge uses the tied arch design, plus criss-crossed suspension cables, to support the deck. To tell an arch from a tied arch by eye, it’s usually enough to look at the supports. If the end of each arch sits atop a spindly pier or some other structure that seems insubstantial against horizontal forces, you can probably bet that they are tied together and it’s not a true arch bridge. Similarly, a rigid-frame bridge integrates the superstructure and substructure (in other words, the deck, supports, and everything else) into a single unit. They don’t have to be arched, but many are.\n\nAnother way to increase the span of a beam bridge is to move the supports so that sections of the deck balance on their center instead of being supported at each end. A cantilever bridge uses beams or trusses that project horizontally, balancing most of the structure’s weight above the supports rather than in the center of the span. This is such an effective technique that the Forth Bridge crossing the Firth of Forth in Scotland took the title of longest span in the world away from the Brooklyn Bridge in 1890 and held the record for decades. This famous photograph demonstrates the principle of that bridge perfectly: The two central piers bear the compression loads from the bridge. And, the outer-most supports are anchors to provide the balancing force for each arm. This way, you can suspend a load in the middle.\n\nThe longest bridges take advantage of steel’s ability to withstand incredible tension forces using cable supports. Cable-stayed bridges support the deck from above through cables attached to tall towers or spars. The cables (also called stays) form a fan pattern, giving this type of bridge its unique appearance. Depending on the span, cable-stayed bridges can have one central tower or more. Their simplicity allows for a wide variety of configurations, giving rise to some dramatic (and often asymmetric) shapes.\n\nFor shorter spans, you can combine the benefits of a cable-stayed structure with girders to get an extradosed bridge. Imagine a concrete girder bridge that uses internal tendons to keep the concrete in compression, then just pull those tendons out of the girder and attach them to a short tower. Rather than holding the deck up vertically like a cable-stayed bridge, they’re acting more horizontally to hold the girders in compression, giving them the stiffness needed to support the deck. It’s a relatively new idea compared to most of the other designs I’ve listed, but there are quite a few cool examples of extradosed bridges across the globe.\n\nWhere a cable-stayed bridge attaches the deck directly to each tower, a suspension bridge uses cables or chains to dangle the deck below. In a simple suspension bridge, the cables follow the curve of the deck. This is your classic rope bridge. They’re not very stiff or strong, so simple suspension bridges are usually only for pedestrians. A stressed ribbon bridge takes the concept a step further by integrating the cables into the deck. The cables pull the deck into compression, providing stiffness and stability so it doesn’t sway and bounce. This design is also primarily used for smaller pedestrian bridges because it can’t span long distances and the deck sags in the middle.\n\nThen you have the suspended deck bridge, the design we most associate with the category with the longest spans in the world. Massive main cables or chains dangle the road deck below with vertical hangers. Suspension bridges are iconic structures because of their enormous spans and slender, graceful appearance. Towers on either side prop up the main cables like broomsticks in a blanket fort. Most of the bridge’s weight is transferred into the foundation through these towers. The rest is transferred into the bridge’s abutments through immense anchorages keeping the cables from pulling out of the ground. Alternatively, self-anchored suspension bridges connect the main cables to the deck on either side, compressing it to resist the tension forces. Because they are so slender and lightweight, most suspension bridges require stiffening with girders or trusses along the deck to reduce movement from wind and traffic loads. These bridges are expensive to build and maintain, so they’re really only used when no other structure will suffice. But you can hardly look at a suspended deck bridge without being impressed.\n\nBridges have to support the vehicles and people that cross over the deck, but they often have to accommodate boats and ships passing underneath as well. If it’s not feasible to build the bridge and its approaches high enough, another option is just to have it get out of the way when a ship needs to pass. Moveable bridges come in all shapes and sizes. A lot of people call them drawbridges after their medieval brethren over castle moats. A bascule bridge is hinged so the deck can rotate upward. A swing bridge rotates horizontally so a ship can pass on either side. A vertical lift bridge raises the entire deck upward, keeping it horizontal like a table. A transporter bridge just has a small length of deck that is shuttled back and forth across a river. That’s just a few, and in fact, every moveable bridge is unique and customized for a specific location, so there are some truly interesting structures if you keep an eye out.\n\nOn the other hand, sometimes there’s no need for ship passage or a lot of space below, and in that case, you can just float the bridge right on the water. Floating bridges use buoyant supports, eliminating the need for a foundation. These are used in military applications, but there are permanent examples too. Many use hollow concrete structures as pontoons, with pumps inside to make sure they don’t fill up with water and sink. And actually, a lot of bridges take advantage of buoyancy in their design, even if it’s not the main source of support. A design like this presents a lot of interesting engineering challenges, so there aren’t too many of them. Similarly, the pedestrian bridge at Fort de Roovere in the Netherlands (probably pronounced that wrong) has its deck below the water, giving it the nickname of the Moses Bridge.\n\nIf space or funding is really tight, one option to span a small stream is a low-water crossing. Unlike bridges built above the typical flood level, low-water crossings are designed to be submerged when water levels rise. They are most common in areas prone to flash floods, where runoff in streams rises and falls quickly. Ideally, a crossing would be inaccessible only a few times per year during heavy rainstorms. However, low-water crossings have some disadvantages. For one, they can block the passage of fish just like a dam. And then there’s safety. A significant proportion of flood-related fatalities occur when someone tries to drive a car or truck through water overtopping a roadway. Water is heavy. It takes only a small but swift flow to push a vehicle down into a river or creek, which means at least some of the resources saved by avoiding the cost of a higher bridge are often spent to erect barricades during storms, install automatic flood warning systems, and run advertisement campaigns encouraging motorists never to drive through water overtopping a roadway.\n\nYou may have heard the term viaduct before. It’s not so much a specific type of bridge, but really about the length. Bridges that span a wide valley need multiple intermediate supports. So, a viaduct is really just a long bridge with multiple spans that are mostly above land. There’s really not a lot of agreement on what is one and what isn’t. Some are singular and impressive structures. But many modern cities have viaducts that are, although equally amazing from an engineering standpoint, a little less beautiful. So, you’re more likely to hear them called elevated expressways. And that gets to the heart of a topic like this: without listing every bridge, there’s no true way to list every type of bridge. There’s too much nuance, creativity, and mixing and matching designs. The Phyllis J. Tilly bridge in Fort Worth, Texas combines an arch and stressed ribbons. The Third Millennium Bridge in Spain uses a concrete tied arch with suspension cables holding up the deck which is stiffened with box girders. The Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge in Turkey combines a cable-stayed and suspension design. In some parts of India and Indonesia, living"
