Toyota LandCruisers will cruise the land with more confidently and comfortably than ever before, thanks to the incorproation of Tenneco's patented Kinetic suspension technology.

Tenneco Inc., Lake Forest Ill., has announced that its patented Kinetic® suspension technology will be featured on the 2008 Toyota LandCruiser 200. The Toyota suspension, known as the Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS), will be standard on all five LandCruiser models except on the GXL turbo-diesel where it is offered as an option.

“The growth in our ride control business is driven by customers who want improved handling and stability and unique ride characteristics that help differentiate their vehicles,” says Gregg Sherrill, Tenneco chairman and CEO. “Our Kinetic technology is an excellent example of such differentiation, and we were proud to work with Toyota on this important launch.”

The KDSS system is designed to provide vehicle stability for the LandCruiser SUV, for both on- and off-road performance. It improves on-road ride, handling and steering feel by creating a flat operating stance during cornering and lane changing. For challenging off-road maneuvers, the LandCruiser maintains control, balance and an even keel, while helping the driver maintain a comfortable ride.

The system operates through the use of hydraulic pistons, which control the front and rear stabilizer bars.

In launching the 2008 LandCruiser 200, Toyota says, “KDSS enables the new LandCruiser 200 to enjoy two previously contradictory benefits: longer wheel articulation for the most challenging off-road driving and the roll control needed for confident on-road driving.”

The LandCruiser is the second Toyota sport utility vehicle to feature the KDSS suspension. Tenneco debuted its Kinetic technology on the 2004 Lexus GX470 sport utility vehicle.
