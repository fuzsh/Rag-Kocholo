        "text": "Bertrand-François Mahé count de la Bourdonnais (born Feb. 11, 1699, Saint-Malo, France—died Nov. 10, 1753, Paris) was a French naval commander who played an important part in the struggle between the French and the British for control of India.\n\nLa Bourdonnais entered the service of the French East India Company as a lieutenant at 19, was promoted to captain in 1724, and took part in the capture of Mahé on the Malabar Coast (southwestern India) in 1726. From 1735 to 1740, he was governor of Île de France (Mauritius) and Île de Bourbon (Réunion) in the Indian Ocean, but with the outbreak of war between France and Great Britain, he was put in command of a fleet in Indian waters."
