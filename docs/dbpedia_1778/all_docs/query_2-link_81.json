        "text": "This is the key point, I think. It isn't enough to say that the landings themselves would have been doable given the sea state. The success or failure of the invasion depends essentially on the Allied build-up in the battle area going faster than the German build-up. The weather in November-December will certainly be bad enough to impede the Allied build-up significantly, whereas the Germans, using railways for their build-up, won't be affected. Most likely scenario: eventually the Germans will bring in enough forces to seal off the beachhead (they will know that they have to do this, even if it means giving up large chunks of Russia), the Allies (who can't build up quickly enough because of weather) won't be able to push inland beyond the range of their naval gunfire support (which can't stay on station indefinitely in any case), and will have to evacuate the beach-head (because keeping them there is hurting the Allies more than the Germans).\n\nThe Germans have 25-30 divisions in the West, so it's not like there's only a small force there. Plus the sea state means that the Allies are going to lose a significant chunk of their landing craft, which means troops will be injured (if not killed, depending on where the craft go down) and equipment will be lost. That's fine when you're fighting Vichy France in North Africa (which is basically like going against a team of third stringers), but when you're facing the Wehrmacht it creates huge issues. The difficulties in supply and the weather will certainly create delays for the Allies.\n\nAnd I don't think the Vichy Government would flip that easily, or that it would matter if they did. The Vichy Army was only 50,000 men strong, and when Germany moved in to occupy it IOTL they basically gave up when Germany demanded that they did. Petain knew that Vichy France couldn't stand up to Nazi Germany, and trying to revolt meant his death and France becoming either an occupied territory or a Quisling government.\n\nTwo really major problems here:\n\nHow the hell do the tanks get ashore? Even ignoring the sea state, the British had Misoa, Tasajera and Bachaquero in service and with reasonably trained crews, while the US launched their first LST in October 1942 and managed to get 23 in commission by the end of the year. They had massively high priority anyway (to the extent that an aircraft carrier was scrapped on the stocks in 1942 to make way for LST production), so you really can't bring them any further forward. That means that until you capture a port you have a total of ~6 ships capable of landing 13 tanks over a beach each - 80 tanks at most (in the first lift, with if everything goes well another similar lift 3 days to a week later). You've somehow managed to get 550 tanks ashore, along with a very large number of vehicles, SP artillery and the like (1000+, from the sound of it). Simply can't be done without an intact port with the appropriate cranes - the sealift to go over a beach even in perfect conditions just doesn't exist and given your POD can't be brought forward enough.\n\nAir cover - the reason Brittany was discarded in OTL is that it's out of range of land-based air cover. The air support you're giving them is coming either from carriers (which requires you to divert a large fraction of your carrier force from the ongoing battle of Guadalcanal - good luck with that!) or is from medium or heavy bombers operating out of the UK with consequent effects on accuracy due to the appalling weather in Northern Europe in November which in OTL frequently forced the USAAF to area bombing in OTL. Close air support just isn't possible - you've got limited fighter cover and some ability to hit targets planned out at least a day before with the heavies, but that's it (incidentally that's why I think your paratroopers will be of little use - they'll be spread over a huge area and are little more use than the resistance at slowing down the Germans).\n\nEdit: I should probably also mention LCTs. The first US-produced one that is vaguely suitable is the Mark 6 of 1943, too late for this timeline. That means they're entirely dependent on a reluctant RN for tank lift, in the form of a handful of Mark 1s (most of the class was lost in the evacuation of Crete) plus ~300 Mark 2s and 3s each capable of carrying 4 tanks a reasonable distance. The far more numerous Mark 4s aren't designed for seagoing use so aren't suitable for the Bay of Biscay in November. They're in a far worse state than the LSTs for dealing with a sea state, being capable of 9 knots in a flat calm so given this it'll be at least a week before they can unload anything else over the beaches.\n\nNow, the RN has other interests for their landing craft - they're the only way to get supplies to quite a lot of places in the Med and points East - so you won't get the lot. Even a maximum effort will only get you another 300 tanks across the beach, at the expense of ensuring that the landed forces don't get any form of resupply for at least a week.\n\nUltimately you're making the same mistake Gudestein has, of ignoring the beans and bullets in favour of whizz-bang stuff. With a paylaod of ~250 tonnes and a turnaround time of about a week, each LCT can deliver about 35 tonnes/day onto the beach. US divisions consumed ~67 lbs/man/day in combat, so very roughly if they don't land any tanks at all your LCT force can support a battalion of infantry each without any of the supporting arms. A typical divisional level of consumption in the US Army was 600 tonnes per division per day for the ground element, again ignoring supporting arms like the air forces. That means you can either support ~5 divisions in combat with the LCT force, land ~500 tanks, or a mixture of the two. And I note that you're immediately landing 6 divisions.\n\nUnless you capture a port immediately (in the first day or two) and get it operating immediately, this is going to be a catastrophe along the lines of the unmentionable pinniped, and for exactly the same reason: logistics.\n\nFDR despised Churchill, and the British establishment.\n\nUm, rubbish, FDR had considerable respect for Churchill. There were times when he was annoyed with the British. But he certainly didn't \"despise\" them.\n\nHis loathing for the Nazis and recognition of their threat was the only reason he decided to intervene on their side.\n\nThis may surprise you, but FDR was not dictator of the United States. He didn't establish Bundles for Britain, or the the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies (its chairman, William Allen White, opposed FDR in all four elections.)\n\nAlso the German troops in this sector are just as green as the troops they face.\n\nRight, because while the US Army had zero troops who had seen combat since 1918, and the German Army had millions, the Germans carefully combed through the formations stationed in France to weed out everyone but new recruits.\n\nThe Luftwaffe has just 300 planes in France at the time of this Op and face 5,000 Allied Aircraft in Britain alone.\n\nMost of which are not based anywhere near Brittany. Bomber Command, for instance, is in East Anglia. Coastal Command has many squadrons in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland doing ASW patrol over the Irish Sea, the North Channel, and the northeast Atlantic. Fighter Command has squadrons all along the east coast to intercept any German raids.\n\nOn top of that... The Normandy beaches were 200 km from airbases in Britain; the Lorient area is 360 km away. That is going to play hell with the loiter time for Allied CAP over the landing area. Especially since the aircraft available to the Allies in 1942 are shorter range to begin with.\n\nOnce the Allies got ashore, they can't be pushed off.\n\nJust exactly how do the Allies supply the troops in the beachhead? The landing force at Normandy was supplied by beach landings using landing craft. The landing craft could make a round trip each day between the Normandy beaches and Portsmouth, a distance of about 150 km - less than seven hours travel for a 12 knot landing craft. From Lorient to Plymouth is about 450 km - over 20 hours. So one round trip every three days, with a much smaller fleet of landing craft. That's beside the high attrition the landing craft will suffer in bad weather.\n\nThe last point I'll mention is early detection. The Lorient area is deep inside Axis-patrolled space. Any landing force approaching it would be detected hundreds of km offshore. The Allies don't have the airpower to blanket the whole sea area west and southwest, so the regular German air patrols in this region will find the landing force. In addition, the area is full of U-boats leaving from or returning to the Biscay ports.\n\nThat means the Germans get a day's warning, roughly - enough time to send reserve troops and activate the Luftwaffe in the region\n\nThe landings will meet a fully alerted force, with air and naval forces attack.\n\nOverall the chance for success is nil.\n\nYou seem to be missing the logistical issues as well:\n\nRommel's logistical issues are well known or should be.\n\nWhat makes you think that Germany's key U-boat bases were in poorly defended ports? The defences along the coast may have been thin, but the ports would be hard nuts to crack as demonstrated by the raids on St Nazaire and Dieppe.\n\nThe St. Nazaire Raid succeeded, accomplishing its objectives. It has a few hundred troops in a construction battalion and a few hundred naval ratings. They are no match for heavily armed troops trained for street combat and backed by Battleships, naval aircraft, and tanks.\n\nSame with Lorient and Vannes.\n\nAirborne landings would have been limited as you note by lack of transports to 1 battalion per lift, with IIRC no gliders available to bring in heavy weapons. Also sea state 5 implies strong winds which might prevent airdrops completely or result in widely scattered forces with a large number of landing casualties.\n\nIt was done at night at low level with French Resistance and Allied Agents guiding them in and in areas sheltered from wind. The area was lightly held and thus easily seized. The Airborne's main job being to hold key bridges and intersections till relieved by mid afternoon of the landings by the latest. No German night fighter units eist in France at this time period with which to resist. Also the gliders exist at this time. They weren't used in Torch though as the transports had to fly all the way to Africa from England. Not an issue here as more shorter ranged transports can be used.\n\nEquipment landing especially tanks would have been limited by the number of landing craft available. There were very few LSTs available to land tanks on beaches, and LCTs would have been challenged by the weather conditions and length of sea voyage round Brittany. The main ports would not have been captured quickly (IIRC the French in North Africa surrendered before serious assaults on the ports were attempted) and unlike North Africa the Germans would have no hesitations in destroying port infrastructure. Without the port infrastructure landing supplies from ships would have involved transhipping into lighters offshore on an exposed Atlantic coast, in November.\n\nLSTs don't show up till next year, but the LCMs were capable of delivering light tanks ashore and did so. In Torch LCM delivered Stuarts decimated a French Armored Division in a rather lopsided battle.\n\nAnd the Vichy French fought hard for two days and knew the landing was coming and lost to a force a third the size depicted here.\n\nAnd the ports weren't rigged. The Germans not having the time to do so before being overran and lacking the explosives.\n\nOnce the ports are secured the Allies can unload in safety. Quiberron is sheltered waters to boot as well. The Bay of Biscay area is also a death trap for U-boats as well, its too shallow for them to fight in, HUFF DUFF and Leigh Lights are standard equipment and the Naval Escort is simply too strong. Deprived of their Atlantic Bases, the Type VIIs can't break into the Atlantic, leaving just nine Type IXs capable of making it into the Atlantic.\n\nGiven the actual state of the German War Machine, the Germans' problems are unsolvable. They are being hit in a time when the 43 buildup has yet to bear fruit.\n\nOnce Spring comes and the Allies break out of the lodgement and the Vichy French out of theirs, they'll be doing it with Sherman spam against a much weaker German Army with a quarter of the tanks they had in 44 and lacking Panzerfausts and Panzerchrecks and over a much less torn up rail network that lets the Allies bring more of its overwhelming might to bear without immobilizing several Divisions of their truck fleets.\n\nThe St. Nazaire Raid succeeded, accomplishing its objectives. It has a few hundred troops in a construction battalion and a few hundred naval ratings. They are no match for heavily armed troops trained for street combat and backed by Battleships, naval aircraft, and tanks.\n\nIn March 1942 from Wikipedia\n\nThe Germans had around 5,000 troops in the immediate area of St Nazaire. The port was defended by the 280th Naval Artillery Battalion under the command of Kapitän zur See Edo Dieckmann. The battalion was composed of 28 guns of various calibres from 75 mm to 280 mm railway guns, all positioned to guard the coastal approaches. The heavy guns were supplemented by the guns and searchlights of the 22nd Naval Flak Brigadeunder the command of Kapitän zur See Karl-Konrad Mecke.\n\nThe brigade was equipped with 43 anti-aircraft guns ranging in calibre from 20 to 40 mm. These guns had a dual role as both anti-aircraft and coastal defence weapons. Many were in concrete emplacements on top of the submarine pens and other dockside installations of the St Nazaire submarine base.\n\nThe harbour defence companies were responsible for local defence and for the security of the ships and submarines moored in the harbour. These companies and the harbour defence boats used to patrol the river were under the command of Harbour Commander Korvettenkapitän Kellerman. The 333rd Infantry Division was the German Army unit responsible for the defence of the coast between St Nazaire and Lorient. The division had no troops based in the town, but some were located in villages nearby and would be able to respond to any attack on the port.\n\nSo more defenders than you are allowing for, without all the other miscellaneous units the Germans had in France (eg 100 security battalions in 1944).\n\nAre you planning a direct assault on the port from the sea? That worked poorly during the original raid on St Nazaire and in North Africa against Vichy troops.\n\nThe alternative is to land away from the ports (and their coastal defence artillery) and take it from the landside in the traditional manner. That might work but it will not be quick as ports tended to have concrete pillboxes covering them. In North Africa it took 2 days of fighting before Oran surrendered; St Nazaire etc will take longer.\n\nTanks - you still haven't fully explained how you will be getting all those medium tanks ashore without LSTs.\n\nIt was done at night at low level with French Resistance and Allied Agents guiding them in and in areas sheltered from wind. The area was lightly held and thus easily seized. The Airborne's main job being to hold key bridges and intersections till relieved by mid afternoon of the landings by the latest.\n\nEven in 1944 Resistance activity made little difference to the Germans. Similarly accuracy of night drops was pretty bad; and there are few sheltered spots in Brittany. How many bridges are you spreading the single battalion of paratroops over? Where are the bridges? How will you be re-supplying them? Where will the gliders come from, as it a US paratroop (not glider infantry) regiment you are using.\n\nthe Vichy French fought hard for two days and knew the landing was coming\n\nEvidence for the claim that they knew the landing was coming?\n\nWhich ports were captured before the Vichy French stopped fighting?\n\nAnd the ports weren't rigged. The Germans not having the time to do so before being overran and lacking the explosives.\n\nNo explosives in a German naval base? What do you think they were putting into torpedoes and mines? From the evidence above they have at least 2 days to start blowing up cranes, demolishing quays and mining the waters.\n\nOnce the ports are secured the Allies can unload in safety.\n\nThe problem is the time it will take to re-open the ports; the capacity without much of the port infrastructure and the impact of German air raids and mining operations. Also don't forget that port operations will be daylight only - down to only 8.5 hours during the winter.\n\nOnce Spring comes and the Allies break out of the lodgement and the Vichy French out of theirs\n\nIIRC Vichy only had 8 lightly armed divisions in France - they would probably not last the winter.\n\nHolding a line across the Brittany peninsula would take at least 15 divisions; you will probably need more so that you can take Brest and St Malo as well. The ports you capture will have to enough capacity to supply these divisions (plus supporting air units and logistics units), build up reserves of supplies and land all these units. That's probably of the order of a million men. This was always the planner's paradox - the capacity of the ports was always less than the supply needs of the units needed to capture them.\n\nD-Day +3:\n\nUS Corps artillery goes into action with \"Long Toms,\" the long range guns helped by FACs in Piper Cubs proving a nasty shock to German Forces. Its sister pieces of 8 inch Howitzer M1s are yet to arrive, but are enroute.\n\nGerman forces regain control of Rennes.\n\nUS Divisions in the pocket are now 1st and 2nd Armor Divisions. Mostly equipped with Stuart Light Tanks and a handful of Shermans. They face very few German Tanks and contain more tanks combined than an entire German Panzer Army or for that matter nine times more tanks than Germany had in all of France! US Infantry Divisions are 1st, 3rd,9th, and 34th (on loan to the British till the Guards arrive), which had landed in the first wave. They were now reinforced by 5th Infantry Division which had had been relieved on Iceland by the 2nd Infantry Division and brought in to relieve 1st Armor Division on the line, and 4th Infantry Division came in and relieved 2nd Armor Division. This way 1st and 2nd could re-equip with Shermans and form an armored reserve. Their no longer needed Stuarts would be given to the Infantry Divisions to use as mobile pillboxes till the parts ran out. The airborne troops were also pulled back from the beaches in preparation for shipment back to Britain for paradrops planned net year. The main thing was to hold the lodgement till sufficient and overwhelming force was available to break out supported by French Forces in the south, support landings backed by paratroopers in North France and heavy air support.\n\nIn the US, the 6th Infantry Division earmarked for the Pacific is re-designated for Europe and ordered to the East Coast. 8th Infantry Division is also ordered to begin deploying to the lodgement. 28th ID to follow in one month. 3rd Armored Division was already loading for deployment. Once they arrived, the US would perform a limited offensive to Plerin to cut Brest off and begin capturing Brest prior to the breakout.\n\nAircraft in the lodgement has increased to 108 P-40Es who begin interdiction strikes against German Truck Convoys and escorting Allied Bombers and guiding stricken ones to the lodgement for hard landings. 40 Piper Cubs in the pocket also fly missions, with three rescuing the crew of a downed British Lancaster, a job they weren't trained for, but they didn't need much space to land and take off from a French Resistance held field and it was so ordered, the first of many such impromptu rescues.\n\nFor US and British Air Force commanders, initially reluctant to support this scheme, the Piper Cub rescues and escorts around Paris shut them up.\n\nBut the big show was 44th Bombardment Groups raid on the still traveling 6th Panzer Division. Flying high around the Bay of Biscay and avoiding the heavy Flak Defenses arrayed around the Channel Coast, they then dropped low to the ground at tree top level as they came over the lodgement and went straight for 6th Panzer Division.\n\nPreceded by P-40Es carrying cluster bombs for SEAD and support by Spitfires flying from Britain with B-25s in a decoy raid, and a separate group of P-40Es escorting naval bombers in attacks at Luftwaffe Airfields, the raid is a huge success.\n\nFor the loss of 20 P-40Es, 12 Spitfires, six B-25s, four B-24s, and two SBDs, the Allies destroy a 1/10 of the 6th Panzer Divisions Tanks, but more importantly destroy half his trucks, a quarter of his artillery of all types, and his locomotives carrying his ammo. Four thousand members of 6th Panzer Army are killed.\n\nThe Luftwaffe in turn lost 32 Fighters and was effectively destroyed in France. It would not challenge the Allies for control of French Skies again.\n\nFurther south, the French slowly give ground as they fall back to their ports. The North African Army was enroute and citizens of France were digging defenses around the ports and excess naval personnel were reinforcing them. De Gaulle was also on his way, the wayward but loyal true son of France was returning home with his forces. Their mission was to buy time for the lodgement to be made where upon protected by the guns of the French Navy and resupplied by the American Factories, they could then push North in a preliminary planned breakout in spring of 43.\n\nAt sea, the Vichy Fleet makes first contact with the Italian Naval Task Force in a four hour battle. Its a lopsided Vichy Victory.\n\nItalian Battleships Andrea Doria and Giulio Cesare are swiftly sent to the bottom by French BBs Strasbourg, Dunkerque, and Provence aided by CAs\n\nDupleix, Foch, Algérie, and Colbert. The escort Italian CLs barely escape destruction.\n\nFor German war planners, the nightmare scenario was occurring, simultaneous or near enough hitting at the same time. While on paper, Germany had 200 Divisions, they were mostly under strength leg mobile units. The real meat of German might was 20 Panzer and Panzergrenadier Divisions plus a number of independent battalions equipped with top line gear used as fire brigades. Hitler had strip three of those Divisions out of the Ost Front and nine of the independent battalions. Also several divisions planned to relieve the Ost Front were shipping to France as well. Hitler was also reinforcing the Balkans and Crete. 22nd Division for example had been sent off to Crete in the wake of the American raid on Ploesti with 13 B-24s that hit nothing. Also sent were 108 fighters and hundreds of Flak Guns that came out of the Ost Front's hide.\n\nThe hammer would fall soon. The German Generals felt it. It would crack the Ost Front like a sledgehammer. Retreat was not so simple. The wide open steppes unlike Western Europe provided no old stone villages to retreat to, once out of their trenches, the leg mobile infantry would get ridden down. Withdrawal had to be carefully planned and coordinated, but the Fuhrer would not hear of it.\n\nOn the Soviet Staging Grounds, trucks full of ammo supplemented by horse carts brought up loads of ammo. The Planets would soon align with the Allied landings in France. While Stalin talked of liberating all of the Rodina this winter, his Generals were more realistic hoping to lift the siege of Lenningrad, erase the Rzhev Salient, destroy Sixth Army, liberate the Caucasus and retake Kharkov and Rostov. They didn't have the depth of logistics vehicles such as trucks to do much more than that. Come spring when logistics allowed it, they would focus on primarily liberating Ukraine and get back their breadbasket and coal fields and regaining Belarus.\n\nThe Union of Sledgehammer and the Planets would soon crash into the Germans with apocalyptic force, racing to save millions scheduled for naught but extermination by the Nazi Regime."
