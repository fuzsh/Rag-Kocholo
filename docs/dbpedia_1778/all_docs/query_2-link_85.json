BR 1736 (48) 2. 1961. (with thanks to Don Kindell)\n\n\"At 0930 on the 23rd, the Canadian destroyer FRASER arrived at Archadon to take off the Ambassador and his staff. This was done, and the FRASER then returned to St Jean de Luz where her passengers were transferred to the GALATEA, which shifted the other evacuees to the m.v. ETTRICK. At 2100, the CALCUTTA joined Admiral Curteis's flag. Empty transports - more, in fact, than were actually needed - were then on the way to take off the large number of evacuees expected, so Admiral Curteis shifted his flag to the CALCUTTA and the GALATEA sailed for England shortly after midnight.\n\nEmbarkation continued throughout the 24th, although it was greatly hindered owing to the heavy swell in the bay; and just after midnight a message was received from the S.N.O. ashore (Captain Allen) to the effect that the terms of the armistice required all evacuation of troops to cease after 1200 on June 25th. A convoy of six empty ships was sailed for England at 1345 on the 25th, followed within the hour by the last three loaded ships, all being escorted. Captain Allen and the beach parties embarked in the FRASER and all the remaining ships sailed at 1530. But before the day was out a distressing disaster occurred.\n\nAt 2215, when the CALCUTTA, in company with the FRASER and RESTIGOUCHE, had shortly before shaped course to the south westward from the mouth of the Gironde, the FRASER, whose commanding officer was labouring under intense fatigue, was rammed by the CALCUTTA and cut in half. The RESTIGOUCHE, after sinking the after part of the FRASER, proceeded independently to Plymouth with most of the survivors (14 officers and 103 men); the CALCUTTA, which rescued 3 more officers and 30 men, was rejoined by HIGHLANDER, which had previously been detached, and both ships reached Plymouth at 0945 on 27th June.\n\nFRIDAY 26 JUNE 1940\n\nIMOGEN with STRATHAIRD arrived Liverpool (1014).\n\nRESTIGOUCHE reported (1645) that she had on board Captain Allen R.N., 13 Officers and 104 ratings from H.M.C.S.

Refugees:- 6 British, 1 French, 1 Spanish, 3 Polish from St. Jean de Luz.\n\nN.O.I/C Falmouth reported (1719) that ships were overcrowded there with French ratings and small parties were still arriving.\n\nETTRICK arrived Plymouth (1716)\n\nRESTIGOUCHE arrived Plymouth (1715)\n\nC.S.2. reported (2105) CALCUTTA E.T.A. 0845/27., with 3 Officers and 30 ratings (8 injured), survivors from H.M.C.S.
