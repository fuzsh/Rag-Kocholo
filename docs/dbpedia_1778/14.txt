John Benbow (born March 10, 1653â€”died Nov. 4, 1702, Port Royal, Jamaica) was an English admiral who became a popular hero through his exploits against the French and his death in active service.

The son of a tanner of Shrewsbury, Shropshire, Benbow served in the navy and merchant marine from 1678 and became captain of a naval vessel in 1689. As master of the fleet under Admiral Edward Russell, he helped destroy the French fleet in the Battle of La Hogue (May 1692), and in November 1693 he bombarded the French port of Saint-Malo.
