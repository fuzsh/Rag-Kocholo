        "text": "Pros: -Our 10 Day Iconic Tour was a great stress free way to see so much of Ireland -Our driver did a fantastic job of getting us to locations at the right times to miss crowds. We also felt like the amount of time at each stop was well planned. Long enough to enjoy, but not so long as to take away from other things. -We appreciated the down time in the evenings to use our time as we choose -The food was generally very good and there were great options to choose from. Dinner was always 3 courses. Breakfasts always had a great variety of hot and cold options -Hotels were clean, in great locations, and hotel staff was very kind. We felt we got a good value for our money. -Our driver found a great balance between sharing information and letting us enjoy the drive Cons: -Expect dinner to take a while. It wasn't uncommon to wait until 8:15pm or later for dessert after being seated at 6:30pm -Because it is rarely needed in Ireland, most of the hotels don't have AC. The ones that did were either on a timer or didn't seem to work well. Rooms did come with fans and windows can be opened slightly. However, especially because rooms didn't have top sheets (just comforters) it was often uncomfortable trying to sleep -We got home to find out we had Covid. Nothing My Ireland can do about it, but if you're traveling with a large group in a bus for 10 days, there's always a risk of disease spread.\n\nMy family (mom, dad, two sisters, and 12-year-old niece) and I just got back from the 10-Day Iconic Scenes of Ireland tour and highly recommend it! Prior to booking our trip, Shauni was friendly and quick to respond to emails, answering all the additional questions we had. Our driver-guide Don O Donoghue was great! He was informative, funny, and a skilled driver of the coach. The days were well-organized and provided the right amount of time at each attraction listed on the itinerary. When timing worked in our favor, Don was able to add a couple of extra photo ops for us. The hotel accommodations, overall, were pleasing. The included meal options were varied enough and delicious each day. We were also able to request a kid's menu! However, be prepared to have no minifridges in the room and be patient with the lengthiness of dinners, especially when other tour groups are present! What my family appreciated the most about My Ireland Tour was the flexibility: as long as we communicated with our driver-guide with enough notice, we were able to veer from the group for a portion of time to visit nearby family in the areas we traveled. If you're looking for a leisurely and comfortable way to travel around Ireland, this is the trip for you!\n\nWow - just coming back from a 10 day Iconic Scenes of Ireland tour and already wanting to go back & see more! From beginning to end, it was a memorable visit! So many positives: 1.). Tom Lavin - our driver - was amazing & made the tour what it was: safe (great driving Tom!), adventurous, and filled with so many beautiful sites of Ireland! Absolutely “brilliant”! Tom shared so much knowledge of every facet of Irish life and of places we drove by - not just the sites visited. We became so familiar with so much of Ireland because of Tom! We also appreciated his insight to change up the itinerary to include the crystal shop & view demonstrations of the etching of crystal! We especially want to thank Tom for the bus treats he shared with our group - a nice touch of extra hospitality! Tom was an utmost professional at all times. 2.) The hotels & food were excellent! Loved the variety of hotels - from a castle to inner city to an old school-turned hotel - and all served such delicious food! What a plus to have both breakfast & dinner provided each day! 3.). The 100,000 welcomes from the hospitable Irish people - everywhere we went, we were greeted with such kindness & willingness to make our visit the best it could be! And it was the best! What a great way to tour Ireland for our first time there - the 10 day Iconic Scenes of Ireland will be recommended highly by us to anyone who wants to see the best of Ireland! A five-star review!! We look forward to visiting the Emerald Isle again in the future!\n\nThe tour and our driver-guide George were phenomenal! We did the 10-Day Iconic Scenes of Ireland Tour in mid-May and honestly if I could do every tour, every vacation with George for the rest of my life that would be OK -- he was super knowledgeable about every place we visited, both the history and the current state of affairs, and was able to easily illustrate how these things not only shaped the current status of Ireland, but also how it made Ireland fit in in the broader world-wide scene. It was obvious that he (and My Ireland Tour) had tons of experience doing these tours, as the itinerary was fast-paced and absolutely stuffed full, but everything still went smoothly and even at the points where it went a little sideways George always had a backup/workaround already prepared. I also really loved that in addition to the big obvious tourist spots, we were also shown smaller, more local areas/businesses that someone from overseas would never find out about, and honestly I think I enjoyed that more than anything because it makes you feel so much closer to the people and the culture than the obligatory tourist areas. George was so great I'm actually worried that all my future vacation tours are going to feel lackluster because the guides won't be nearly as cool as him.\n\nWhat an amazing trip we had! We did the 10 day iconic scenes of Ireland tour and I have to say, as a first time traveler to Ireland, choosing this tour was the best way to see such a beautiful country. Our tour guide Tom was the best! His knowledge of the areas and the country as a whole along with his humor made the trip unforgettable. The coach was very comfortable so the days we spent a little more time on the bus weren’t bad at all. One of the things I loved most was how this tour supports each areas local economy. We stopped at some major tourist destinations of course, but also at many small businesses along the way. Being able to support local artists and businesses is important to me, and getting to do this on the tour was great. All of our hotels were beautiful and the food was delicious. Breakfast was a buffet with choices for every palate and dinners were well thought out, always with a vegetarian dish for those who wanted. Each dinner was a three course meal and we never left hungry! Tom was there if we had any issues and the minor one we had, he took care of right away with the hotel management. This tour also was great about making sure any food allergies and sensitivities are addressed before hand. One person in our group had a food sensitivity and never once did she feel that she didn’t have options for her meals. The level of care we received was above and beyond what you would expect. Our luggage was put on and off the coach by the staff and Tom, and then brought to our rooms when we got to each new hotel. The little details are not overlooked! I highly recommend traveling with My Ireland Tour!\n\nWhere to start? Our driver, John, was AMAZING! He Was funny ,accommodating ,informative, And most definitely one of the best parts of this trip. We toured with a group of 20 people, whom we now call friends. As you can see from the photos I was the self chosen photographer of the group. Every single day was a joy, Although I will say that the 10 day iconic door was a bit more physical than I was aware, I pushed myself, and I didn't regret it a single day. There was a waterful that I would drive a really thought that we should see but it seemed to stole the climb was a bit too steep for me..so. I opted to stay on the bus. Our tour guide/driver, Came to take me off the bus and personally hold my arm and escort me up every single step until I stood before the water fall With tears of my eyes. Such a beautiful sight to behold and he was right it was worth the journey. Im turning 60th this year, my Husband is 70 And we had the most amazing time together. We were able to see most of the things that were on my bucket list and we shall return to see the rest. This was all inclusive so the amount of money that it saved us was incredible. The days were well planned out,;the meals in the hotels were fabulous! Thank You For the most memorable vacation ever... And a special thank you to our driver and tour guide John\n\nJust returned from a 10 day Iconic Tour of Ireland. I have to say that from initial booking to final drop off, they were the best organized tour company I have used. Communication before the tour was excellent, and I felt that I had a personal relationship with the company before actually meeting our tour guide and driver, TOM LAVIN. If you are lucky enough to have TOM as your guide/driver, then you are lucky enough! Tom was not only a great driver but also an exceptional tour guide. Every day we had a history lesson, a cultural and political lesson and a comprehensive description of everything we were going to see. He is also wonderfully funny, which made the time on the bus fly by. I loved the small tour group, as it gave us plenty of room to spread out in the bus without having someone breathing down your neck. It also made it easy to learn about everyone else on the tour. I would highly recommend My Ireland Tours to my friends. It was an exceptional experience from the day I made the initial enquiry to the moment we off loaded at the airport. Many thanks to Eric, Tom and Sharron for providing such a great experience.\n\nOur 10-Day Iconic Scenes of Ireland vacation with My Ireland Tours was the trip of a lifetime. Our group of 9 had originally booked the trip for May 2020, but had to postpone due to the Pandemic. During the next three years several changes needed to be made and all were handled with total professionalism and good humor by our coordinator, Shannon O'Brien. She was so easy to work with and 'just made everything happen.' Every detail was executed perfectly, including providing us with a late transfer from Dublin Airport to the Dunboyne Castle Hotel due to the arrival time of our red-eye flight from San Francisco. Our driver/guide, Tony McGoey, proved to be expert in all things Irish with an encyclopedic knowledge of its history, geography, people, politics, and culture…not to mention being a fabulous storyteller and singer…as well as a virtuoso behind the wheel of a luxury bus! The tour schedule enabled us to see and experience so much of this wonderful country while not spending an inordinate time on the bus. Lots of time to explore castles, farms, pubs, and landmarks. Tony provided interesting and inciteful information throughout each segment of the days' trips, giving us tips on what to look for, where to go, places to eat and shop. Our trip took us from Dublin to Galway and through the Wild West and Ring of Kerry and back to Dublin. Along the way we visited such places as Kylemore Abbey, The Burren, Connemara, Cliffs of Moher, Blarney and the Woollen Mill, Christchurch Cathedral, the National Stud, and the Rock of Cashel with stops at Celtic Crystal to see how fine Irish lead crystal is cut, the Hazel Mountain Chocolate Factory where chocolate is made from roasted coffee beans, the Bog Village and the Red Fox Inn for the 'World's Best Irish Coffee,' an unforgettable sheep dog demonstration, lunch at the Blind Piper Pub for Ireland's Best Fish & Chips, the Jameson Distillery and Guinness Storehouse, and a local farm for a traditional farmhouse lunch. We even made a stop at Pat Cohan's Bar in Cong, made famous by the John Wayne/Maureen O'Hara movie, “The Quiet Man,” where some of us got to draw a pint of Guinness behind the bar. We also had several spontaneous adventures orchestrated by Tony and Shannon such as a horse drawn Jaunting Carriage ride with Susie (the horse) and Mark (the driver) to Ross Castle through the Killarney National Park and a delightful Sunday evening of music and fun at Canty's Pub in Cork with 86-year-old Joe Mac and his partner, Oliver. The final night of the tour was spent at the Merry Ploughboys where we were treated to authentic Irish music and dancing and a fantastic dinner! We stayed in lovely hotels, ate more great food than we ever thought possible and were treated like royalty. A couple of real side benefits were that the full-sized bus only had 26 passengers so we had lots of space to spread out, and we were able to stay 2 nights in 4 of the hotels, so we weren't having to pack up and move luggage every day! My Ireland Tours is a first-class company with outstanding personnel. They are organized, efficient, extremely fairly priced, have a great selection of excursions, and above all are committed to guest satisfaction. If (when) we go back to Ireland, this will be our tour company!\n\nMy two friends and I took the 10 Day Ireland Tour. Our driver/guide was Colm and he made the trip for us. It was a packed, well organized tour so that we could get in as much as we could. Colm made suggestions for eating, shopping, extra sights to see and would go out of his way to find something out for us, accommodate any requests, and gave us great information on the sights we were seeing and the history of Ireland. We saw so much and I know there is so much more to see. The hotels were amazing and the meals fantastic - the soups! There were 24 on our tour, just the right number, and Colm took the time to learn about each and every one of us. It's so hard to pick a favorite place but Connemara and the Ring of Kerry truly stand out. The weather cooperated and was nice, the bus was comfortable, clean and we were able to recharge our electronics, use wifi while we were traveling. I raved about this trip so much, my husband now wants to go. And I could go again because I am sure I missed things because there is so much to see. Martina, Colm, and the whole company made sure our 10 day tour was all that it could be. We didn't have to worry about logistics, Colm got us where we wanted to go, most of our meals were taken care of, and it was great not being in a different hotel every night. The 2 nights in a hotel was just right. Thanks My Ireland Tour for a wonderful experience.\n\nI have seen many movies filmed in the lush green, beautiful Ireland, and put it on my bucket list. Last year we booked for Sept 17th, 2023, a 10 day iconic tour in the south of Ireland. It was my first trip to Ireland and I was not disappointed! Tony McGoey was our tour guide for our small group of 26 people! It was a full sized bus, so we had plenty of room to spread out. We were so fortunate to have Tony! He was awesome! He was pleasant, funny, knowledgeable. He told many jokes and gave us history lessons on Ireland, as well as current events information. He made sure we were all taken care of, even the morning of our trip to the airport leaving Ireland, he made sure we had a breakfast, as the hotel restaurant was not open yet! It was the perfect mix of planned events and free time. Above and beyond! That was the consensus of the entire group! We had a chance to make new friends, go out with other people and explore the culture. If you are looking to book a tour, I highly recommend this one, and maybe you will be luck enough to meet Tony!\n\nAfter many months if research, we chose My Ireland Tour for our first visit to Ireland. We could not have picked a better company. From the booking process and our interaction with Shannon to our driver Tony, everything was amazing! We did the 10 Days Iconic Scenes Tour and it encompasses a ton of stops - some places we would not have thought of ourselves. The smaller Tour size on the bigger bus was an added bonus. Plenty of room to stretch out. Tony made sure we knew all the history of Ireland as far back as the 500s. A very sad tale, but certainly speaks volumes to the resilient, amazing people we met along the way. The scenery is so beautiful- from Conamara, to the Wild West and around the Ring Of Kerry. We enjoyed all the off the beaten path stops, as well as the more famous ones. We would have enjoyed more time in some of the smaller stops, like Kinsale, but it gave us the start of a list for a return trip. Hotels were high end, however only a couple had AC, which proved to be a challenge especially with only a duvet cover and no top sheet. Spent most nights quite warm due to a random heat wave while we were there. Meals were very good, albeit repetitive. If you have a free lunch or dinner, find some wood-fired pizza. The Irish do it surprisingly well! The tour included tours of many well known sites as well as a traditional Irish dinner at a local pub, which we all thoroughly enjoyed. Plus, we learned a song or two from our guide. We weren't sure we'd be able to do a tour as being on the go for that long and having to socialize that much is sometimes taxing, but there were plenty of periods of down time. By the end of the tour, we had made several new friends and we were sad to say goodbye. We wouldn't hesitate to do another tour with My Ireland Tour!\n\nOur My Ireland 10 day tour taken at the beginning of September was really enjoyable and the scenery and sites we visited were beautiful, We were a small group but on a large, very comfortable coach so we had space to move around and also had all the benefits that go with a group of that size. Tony, our driver/guide was amazing. It made such a difference having an Irish guide who was able to tell us so much about the history, culture and politics of Ireland and the Irish people. It was fascinating and we came away with a much greater understanding. All the discourse was very well paced and mostly also linked in with what we were seeing, such as the peat bogs and the Penny walls. There were always plenty of “comfort breaks”, usually linked to another visit of interest of which there were many, though thankfully none of these were long and none involved visits to places where there was any pressure to buy things, as so often happens on other coach tours. Being a 10 day tour we never felt as though we were rushing from place to place and also having 2 nights in most hotels was a bonus. The accommodation was excellent, as were most of the meals. The only negative was that some of the latter tended to be repetitive and predictable, particularly with mashed potato and carrot as the only vegetable and so often with apple pie for desert! There were always 3 choices of the starter and main course but rarely a vegetarian option. Another totally separate slight grievance was the advertised transport from and to Dublin airport. There was no transport at all available for arrivals after 11.30 am or for afternoon departures and there was no flexibility at all here which was disappointing. All in all though it was a great tour and, though expensive compared to many others we looked at, it was worth it and was a totally enjoyable and very memorable trip. Definitely a company to be recommended to others, as it had been to me!\n\nWe just completed the 10 Day Iconic Ireland tour with our wonderful driver/guide, Tony. I cannot say enough good things about this tour. The highlights: *Great itinerary *Perfect pacing - I was concerned about too much bus time but we were never on the bus for more than 1.5 hours before a break or stop for sightseeing. Most days started at 9 am and we were back to hotel by 5 pm which allowed time to rest before dinner. *Our guide, Tony, was the best. He shared history, facts, stories in such an interesting way. Also, he talked just the right amount. Usually there was more talking in the morning and less in the afternoon, which is great when you're tired. He is also kind and funny and connected well with our group. *I loved how Tony would tell us enough about the place before we got there. Then we would have free time or a guide. We didn't have to follow him around from place to place. I always felt like the stops had just the right amount of time - not too long and not too short. *The hotels were very nice. *All of the dinners were included which was great. After a long day of touring, it's nice to NOT have to think about what to do for dinner. Food and service was great at all hotels. *While you don't always have flexibility on a tour to go where you want, it was really nice not to have to worry about driving, getting tickets, etc. We walked right into every site. No lines, no waiting. After traveling on our own for a few days before the tour, it was kind of nice to not have to make many decisions. *The group size is limited to 24. Bus was very nice with comfortable seats (and 34 seats so room to spread out), WiFi and good sound from the driver/guide. My Ireland Tours was great from start to finish. I had to make a change in our reservation and the response time was quick. All communication was excellent and we were well prepared. If you're looking for a tour, the 10 Day Iconic Ireland is a great one!\n\nMy wife and I, along with 6 other family members, did the 10 day Iconic Scenes of Ireland Tour from July 10-19, 2023. It was fantastic and very well run. Our driver, Tony, did a great job of keeping us informed of the schedule each day so there was never any question as to when or where we needed to be at any time. He was very amusing and I especially appreciated all of the historical and cultural information he imparted along the way. This gave me a real appreciation for the country and its people and made the trip more than just an amazing sightseeing trip, although it was that too. Along with the major tourist attractions, we got to see some lesser-known, but equally interesting places like Hazel Mountain Chocolates, an incredible sheep dog demonstration, and the beautiful work of the artisans at the Celtic Crystal factory. We also had a delicious home-cooked lunch at a farmhouse Bed & Breakfast that brought back childhood memories of meals that my grandmother cooked. It's impossible to pick out a single highlight. The small group size (we had a total of 23 people) was perfect because we had plenty of room to spread out on the bus. We never felt like we were part of a large mob being herded from one place to the next, and the bus was immaculate and very comfortable. I highly recommend this tour and this company.\n\nI am so happy that I discovered My Ireland Tour! Our family of seven adults and 9 month old grandson just returned from a fantastic 10 day iconic tour of Ireland. Kristel O'Connor was very timely with her emails to me regarding our reservations and was very accommodating with our requests for a baby cart seat and cots in hotel room. The hotels were super, including the breakfasts. We stayed at the Hardiman Hotel in Galway, the Drumhall Hotel in Killarney, the Imperial Hotel in Cork and the Alex Hotel in Dublin. I was initially disappointed that we were not able to stay at the hotel in Kinsale but the Imperial Hotel in Cork was beautiful and the staff were excellent, in fact it was my favorite hotel. We had a private sprinter van that seated nine passengers plus two seats for the driver and guide. The van had large side windows so everyone had a wonderful view at all times. Our driver, David Darby was also excellent, with impressive driving skills! He was very timely with our pickups and accommodating with our requests for small changes in the agenda. He provided a lot of information about the places we visited and kept us entertained with his many jokes. Our Dublin guide, Denise, was also excellent as were our two relief drivers, Joe and Sam. My husband and I are from Ireland, and our family has had many trips to Ireland in the past. The tour included places we had never visited and some places that we visited a long time ago; we have never seen so many places in one visit. We also had some fantastic meals during our visit and only one day of rain!! I am not a fan of big tour groups but would definitely recommend a small group tour with My Ireland Tour and will consider going on another one myself.\n\nWhen my daughter, Shawna and I decided to visit Ireland, we researched for several days and finally decided to book the 10-Day Iconic Scenes of Ireland Tour with My Ireland Tour Company. This itinerary was the most complete with its natural sites such as the stunning Wild Atlantic Way, Cliffs of Moher, and Ring of Kerry, ancient castles, charming historic towns, and because it included Killarney and Cork. The tour itself exceeded our expectations as the hotels and meals were lovely, the people we met were friendly and welcoming, and the sights brought me to tears. What made this tour exceptional was one of Ireland's national treasures, Eamonn Broderick, our guide and driver. Not only did Eamonn bring Ireland to life for us with his knowledge of the cities and areas along our path, but he charmed us with stories about growing up in Ireland, serenaded us with lovely Irish songs, shared information about Ireland's history, people, politics, and economy, and kept us laughing with his delightful sense of humor. Eamonn's kindness, thoughtfulness, optimistic spirit, and attention to even the smallest detail coupled with his charming personality and obvious love of Ireland endeared him to us all. Not only were his driving and parking skills exceptional, but Eamonn took care of us as a loving father would his children with reminders to remove our carry-ons at the end of each day, frequent schedule updates for meeting and mealtimes, suggestions for good restaurants or shops in the areas we visited, and by somehow managing to park his tour bus in plain sight and making himself available for questions so we never got lost. Eamonn often joined us for a drink, laughter, and stories before dinner and sometimes provided food recommendations. Never have I felt so well cared for and confess to missing his steady presence for several days after we left the tour! I would highly recommend this tour, and suggest you request Eamonn Broderick for your tour guide to insure a memorable visit to Ireland.\n\nI was on the 10 day Iconic Scenes tour. I am a seasoned traveler and have been on many international tours with well known large and independent small companies. A large group of friends traveled together on this trip. The execution of itinerary, location of hotels, and overall tour experience fell short of my expectations and standards of other tour companies. Things done well include driver skill in maneuvering bus, cleanliness of bus, comfortable hotels, evening show quality, and selection of scenic routes. The stops were at memorable iconic sites that were well chosen. Several hotels (5 nights) were located outside of walking distance to tourist areas, restaurants, and entertainment. A taxi was necessary to reach anything outside of the hotel offering. Our group frequently skipped the included hotel dinner to travel independently into town as it was the only way to see the tourist center. The hotel on Day 1 is located in a small town with little to do. Pubs and restaurants not open until evening. There were no optional excursions, drop off to Dublin or optional evening entertainment. The tour director is also your bus driver. You may pass an interesting roadside site without mention as your guide is driving. The restroom on the bus is not available for use if the coach is moving. You must ask to stop the bus and have it unlocked. The bus stopped 2 times during the entire trip for photos at scenic points. The majority of photos must be taken through the bus window at full speed. We had no opportunity to step out of the bus and photograph something as iconic as a pasture with sheep. The professional guided tour at several sites was skipped in favor of our driver giving us a quick overview. The tour of the farm with home made lunch on the itinerary was skipped and generic lunch substituted. The days start at 9 am and are rushed with no time for a spontaneous stop at something like a farmers market you are passing, quick stop for a sample of local food, etc. The standard with other tour companies I've been with has allowed the guide to provide us with food tastings (fruit, veggies, cheese, treats), or other local lifestyle interactions. The only optional tour we had was to see a sheep herding demonstration, which was delightful. Our group was in constant communication with the tour director on concerns and giving feedback from the first day. If a traveler is satisfied with a basic surface overview tour, riding a coach to experience countryside, an overview of main tourist attractions, minimal pictures, and comfortable hotels this trip would meet basic expectations. Those wanting to fully experience the culture, charm, sights, history, lure, and have a true taste of Ireland may need to look elsewhere.\n\nMy wife and I had a trip of a lifetime with My Ireland Tour!! We took the 10 Day Iconic Scenes of Ireland tour and it was the best decision we've made all year. Our tour guide, Tom, was so great - super nice, funny, professional, helpful, full of great tips and suggestions, and we really enjoyed hearing everything he had to say (from stories about fairies to local news and general goings-on). I personally am very thankful that he is also an excellent driver - I unfortunately suffer from motion sickness, but for the most part I was completely fine on the bus due to Tom's careful driving on some of the rougher roads. I also appreciated the advance notice he gave us on which days would be trickier (I always knew when to take that Dramamine!). I loved the fact that we were in a small group setting for the trip as well! I couldn't imagine being on a larger tour with 40 or 50 people. With a smaller group, I felt like we were able to really engage with each other and make new friends! There was also plenty of opportunity to explore things on our own during times when my wife and I were looking for a more quieter atmosphere. I have no complaints - I really enjoyed the hotels we stayed in, the places we visited, the extra surprise stops along the way, and ALL THE IRISH COFFEE! The process of booking the trip and the pre-trip communication were both seamless and we felt very prepared before leaving. Definitely already looking at when we would want to return to this beautiful country and the other trips My Ireland Tour offers! I 100% recommend!!!\n\nFirst the Great: Wow! This was amazing! For my first time out of the country, I was worried about planning a comprehensive trip but My Ireland Tour made it so easy! We did the 10 day Iconic Scenes Tour and we learned so much history. Our tour guide/driver was Tony and he was so engaging, energetic, and really accommodating not only to our needs but also to help make this the best tour we could possibly have by helping us hit on our 'wants' as well. His advice on places to eat for lunch or things to do and see were always spot on and he was so knowledgeable about everything we might have questions on! I have to make hundreds of decisions every day with my job so I wanted a trip where I wasn't faced with too many decisions about what to go do/see each day and this fit the bill perfectly. There was one day where we didn't want to do everything the tour was doing, but Tony helped us plan how best to do what we wanted (Trinity College Library/the Book of Kells and the National Museum of Archaeology) and how to meet up with the tour in the easiest way possible. My husband and I are also not drinkers of alcohol at all, but we both enjoyed the tour of the Jameson Distillery and learning the process of making Whiskey through the years. On Tony's recommendation we did skip the Guinness Tour and I don't regret anything! Now the cons: There were several days where it felt like we were on the bus A LOT but because we were typically hitting 3-4 things a day, I felt like this was reasonable (and we covered a lot of kilometres during the course of our trip). Also, if you are prone to getting motion sick, make sure you take meds every day. I was fine for the first 3 days, but after that I got sick almost every day we were on the bus. Also, the bus WIFI was subpar. We could connect to it just fine, but it didn't actually grant any access. They had a number to call if you had issues with connecting, but (if you are like us) we needed wifi because we turned off our data! On the plus side, I felt like I used my phone a lot less and saw a lot more of the countryside because of this. On the whole, it was wonderful and I would highly recommend this tour to everyone!\n\n100% amazing trip from start to finish! I went on the 10-day 'Iconic Scenes of Ireland' tour traveling solo joining a small group of 25 total. The vibe was cheery and there were 5 other solo female travelers on this tour - ages varying from mid thirties to seventy-ish, and it was an unexpected and delightful surprise to be able to make such quick friends and bond over our trip. Tony, our driver/escort, took extremely good care of the group and gifted us with his extensive knowledge, history, sites and scenery of the country. There was so much I learned from his stories and even the occasional song. :) All of the hotels were beautiful and comfortable, and even felt a little upscale to me. The tour itinerary was varied and gave us the opportunity to visit so many lovely towns around the country. Tony was available for any request and I felt very taken care of the whole time. I can't begin to describe the beauty of Ireland and the warm friendliness of its residents. You can strike up a conversation with virtually anyone and people seemed genuinely interested in talking and showcasing their country. MyIrelandTours (and Keith in particular) was very responsive and helpful at each step of the way when I was booking this trip. I absolutely recommend this company and will book again when I can return!\n\nI recently returned from the 10 day iconic scenes tour from My Ireland Tour with Tom as our guide/driver. I'm not even sure where to start. I have wanted to visit Ireland for 30 years and I finally took the opportunity to book the trip for my recent birthday. I found this company when I googled 'solo female travel in Ireland'. The booking process was easy and the communication from the company was timely and thorough. It was exceptionally comprehensive what to expect and when and I had no issues whatsoever with the booking process. The tour itself was exceptional. Tom was amazing, he was very knowledgeable about the history of Ireland as well as local events and news that is currently happening. His enthusiasm was contagious. He was also so accommodating and when a group of us mentioned wanting to get a tattoo, he went above and beyond to make that happen. He was very patient and an excellent driver on those twisty roads. The itinerary was jam packed with fun activities but you still had time to be by yourself if you wanted. As a solo traveler, that was very important to me, as a natural introvert. And the side excursions were super fun as well. The group I was with was a mix of people, couples, friends and solo travelers like myself, and I enjoyed hanging with them all very much. I can't recommend My Ireland Tour enough and I would eagerly book with them again if I ever went back to Ireland! I'd give them 10 stars if I could. Absolutely superb.\n\nMy husband & I took MIT's 10 Day Iconic Sights Tour, August 22-31. We're still smiling as we recall great moments from the tour! (This was a make-up trip for our Covid journey cancelled in April 2020. IT was a self-drive tour we'd planned ourselves. When we researched reviving the tour this year, car rental prices were still sky-high, so we opted for a bus tour instead. The MIT trip's itinerary covered nearly ALL the main sites we'd planned to see in 2020, PLUS fit in several places we'd nixed because of the extra drive-time involved. Yay!!) The tour group officially capped at 26; however, our bus group was 17, made of 3 separate family groups. It was a blast, and people were very friendly and fun to be with. Here's the highlights we most appreciated: 1. Harry, our tour bus driver/guide. What a hoot!! He did a fab job every day, and arranged for 3 of us to visit an Irish music/dancing show at a nearby hotel the evening of one of our stops. Harry was very knowledgeable, humorous, down-to-earth, patient--and relaxed, it seemed, even with all of us being his ongoing responsibility. 2. Pace of the tour. We crammed so much into this trip, yet it was paced very well. There were a few times I wished we'd had a bit more time at a particular place, but who doesn't feel that way on ANY trip?? Nicely done. They really did a great job choosing the places to go & see. 3. Price. When you factor in the very nice hotels, breakfasts and dinners included, and entrance fees, the price was such a great value! 4. Two nites/hotel. We REALLY appreciated the fact that (apart from the original start-up night) we had two nights at each hotel stop. So we weren't always packing & unpacking. Harry took care of loading 1 bag/person, so we decided we'd pack up our shared main suitcase & set it out early for him to load; but we retained a small bag each to finish with toiletries & our final pack-ups after breakfast, then simply put it in the bus when we boarded for each departure. Total convenience! No stress! 5. Beautiful overview of Ireland. We know we didn't do the lovely country of Ireland justice, but what a great first time visit! We got a great taste of the variety of topography here, saw both cities & small villages, enjoyed assorted Irish music each day on the bus, and got a feel for its history, ancient and recent; and met some of Ireland's wonderful people. 6. Great company to work with!! Quick replies for our questions. We flew into Dublin a day early & they worked with us to hook up with the tour's airport meet-up on the starting day. Good detail on the itinerary, with more specific timeline provided nearer the tour date. Provided contact info for Harry, in case it was needed. We stayed three days after the tour ended, and Harry still answered a text question. Thanks, My Ireland Tour, for a truly great Irish experience! Julie & Earl (Arizona & Vermont, USA)\n\nI chose the 10 day iconic scenes of Ireland tour. My experience was 5 stars from start to finish. Beginning with the office staff answering all my questions and helping find accommodations after the tour was over, to the actual tour. Our tour guide Tony was hands down the best guide I've ever had. He taught us all about the history of Ireland, current events, and even traditional songs so we could sing along in the pubs! He answered every smart and absurd question thrown at him from our group. He had a wealth of knowledge about local towns to the whole of Ireland. This tour takes care of everything for you. You never have to check into a hotel, or get lost trying to find it or the local attractions. The hotels are all very nice with tasty selections for breakfast and dinner. They did get a little repetitive by the end but they were all quality, and included in the cost! You're back to hotel every night by dinnertime, and finished with plenty of time to go out and peruse the local vibe. The pubs in each town were so fun! I really can't say enough about this tour. The value you receive for what you pay is incredible. I wish I could have Tony on every vacation, he really is the absolute best.\n\nWhen looking for a company to use for our trip to Ireland, I looked at Blogs, TripAdvisor and read tons of reviews like this one, so I thought it appropriate to review our fantastic trip with My Ireland Tour! I chose My Ireland Tour for my family of six (my husband, myself and our four children ages 24, 23, 21 and 19) for many reasons and I am so HAPPY I did! It was important to me that we had a trip that included hotels, meals and entrance fees to any exhibits. I also wanted to see much of the country while we were there. We took the 10 Day Iconic Tour because this tour company offered all of that and more!! We saw a ton, did a ton and had as much free time and down time as we needed. It was priced fairly and we were pleased and impressed with all of the hotels and accommodations. I was worried about extra costs along the way with my large family and it was not the case at all. The bus was new and clean - as well as having wifi (huge!). Tom L was the BEST tour guide. He was professional, caring and informative. He taught us a tremendous amount about the country's politics, current European Union changes, Irish history and the future of Ireland. He was extremely knowledgeable. He knew this was a trip of a lifetime for my family and he treated us as such. He took very good care of us for 10 days. We always felt like we were his first priority. Tom made sure we saw all of the important tourist spots and added some very special touches that made our time there very memorable. We did not want to leave! I highly recommend this company. You leave Ireland feeling as if you just took the vacation of your life - it is a special company who cares about their customers. A+!! Slainte!! Please enjoy some of our pics.\n\nI just returned from the 10 day iconic scenes of Ireland tour led by Tom Lavin. It was absolutely amazing! Tom was magnificent. Due to long wait times at customs and poor wifi connection, I was worried I'd miss my shuttle to the first hotel, but Tom was great at communicating with me until we were able to meet up. Tom was also very attentive to the entire 24 person group, always asking how our hotels and dinners were, and providing very interesting and insightful information about Ireland and its history along our routes. It was extremely impressive how he was able to keep talking for 30+ minutes at a time as we went from site to site. I went on this trip as a solo traveler but everyone was so friendly I never felt alone or left out. It also allowed me to take my time at sites and do whatever I wanted when I wanted to (and take as many pictures as my heart desired). This is definitely a tour I would recommend for any other solo travelers looking for an awesome trip. As for the sites, it was a good mix of truly iconic places like the Cliffs of Moher and the Blarney stone, and less well-known places (to me, at least) such as the Irish National Stud Farm and Charles Fort. The tour also made sure to highlight family owned/local small businesses so our hotels never felt like we were just staying at a generic Hilton. To would always make sure to give recommendations for places to eat or try out along the way too. We finished the trip by eating dinner at the Merry Ploughboy which had Irish singers and dancers performing which was just the cherry on top of an awesome sundae. I would highly recommend this trip to anyone, whether they're a couple, a group of friends, a large family unit, or even a solo traveler like myself! It's a great way to see lots of Ireland.\n\nMy sister and I did the 10 day Iconic Scenes of Ireland tour June 6-15. It was fabulous in every regard! Our motor-coach driver, Raymond Wilson, greeted us at the airport upon arrival at 10:00am and whisked us, and 5 others, off to Dunboyne Castle Hotel. We were all jet-lagged and fortunately, our rooms were ready at 11:00 when we arrived, instead of the 3:00pm check-in. We took a 3 hour nap and then ventured out to explore until our 6:00pm group dinner…where we met all the members of our tour group. Raymond was so knowledgeable about Ireland's history and all the sights we would be seeing. His skillful driving of the motor-coach on the narrow, winding roads made us all feel safe and comfortable in his capable hands. He was very funny and we had such a great time with him! As for the sights, hotels and breakfast/dinners…you couldn't ask for more. Stunningly beautiful and historic places, great food and the hotels were 5 star. What can I say about the pubs and the Irish music, other than it was our favorite part to venture out after dinner and join in the revelry of rollicking music. We even skipped a few group dinners and hit the pubs instead with 3 other traveling companions on our tour. If you are planning a trip to Ireland in the future, you cannot go wrong with My Ireland Tours. Every single detail of the trip was memorable and perfect in every way!\n\nWe booked the 10 Day Iconic Tour and could not be more pleased with the service, ease of booking, scheduling and communication. If you are planning to use a tour guide while visiting Ireland, you are missing out if you do not use My Ireland Tour. From the day we first booked, Shauni, our booking agent, was in constant contact with us and kept us informed of changes to COVID, restrictions, tour expectations, where to meet our tour guide, etc. Once we arrived in Ireland, our tour guide, Harry Fisher was exceptional. Even though we had a scheduled agenda, Harry would go off script if you will, and add sights or experiences we would have not had a clue about. His knowledge of Ireland, its history, politics, best pubs, food and anything we could think to ask him completely made the difference between a great experience and and exceptional experience. When we go back, we will try to plan our tour of North of Ireland when we know Harry will be on that tour. My Ireland Tour will exceed all your expectations and will make your trip to Ireland wanting you to go back immediately. We are one week removed from our tour and wanting to go back already because of the excellent service we received. Thank you My Ireland Tour for such a great experience and making our time in Ireland the best vacation we have taken.\n\nWhere to begin in describing the once-in-a-lifetime experience I had with My Ireland Tour? I suppose, at the beginning. As I was planning my first trip to Ireland, I was starting to get a bit overwhelmed with where to stay, what to see, what car to rent, and how I would handle driving on the other side of the road while on the other side of the car! (Americans, am I right?) I began searching “Ireland solo traveler tips' when, as if sent from the fairies themselves, the My Ireland Tour website popped up. As I perused through the stunning photos and perfectly-detailed itineraries, I had the growing excitement that this should be the way I first experience the Emerald Isle. From the moment I booked my tour (10 day iconic scenes), through my final days, this company was thorough and communicative and helpful. Everything was coordinated for me to the T. On day 1 I met my tour guide Tom (and some other Tour travelers) at the airport and could immediately tell we were all truly in for an incredible adventure. The tour bus was clean and spacious, and the hotels were top-notch with delicious food and drink (though do NOT try to order a vodka martini). Every location we visited was a smooth check-in as our tour guide had obtained all tickets/passes needed, and he made sure to have us arrive at these locations in perfect timing for the smallest crowds. As a regular solo-traveler, I was a bit worried about not having autonomy on a tour like this, but at many locations we were given a time to return to the bus and some recommendations on places to eat/drink/explore, and so we could head off on our own or stick with the group (though I got lucky in having possibly the most fun group of strangers ever to be tossed together, and we typically stuck together). As we traveled, our tour guide Tom gave us just enough information to keep us interested and educated, but not so much as to be boring or obnoxious. He also added in a few impromptu stops to see sights and meet people that I never would have if I'd traveled on my own. He consistently kept us all updated on times for dinner, arrival, departure, etc. and was readily available to us should we have a concern or need. He even helped keep an eye out for a nice, Irish farmer for me to marry (but alas, we were unsuccessful). I truly can't stop shouting from the rooftops about the STELLAR experience I had with My Ireland Tour, and am beyond grateful for this experience with their group.\n\nPatti and I were on the 10 day My Ireland Tour returning home on Sept. 25, 2019. Both of us could not of had a better time. Ireland is truly beautiful and we thought our tour had to have included all the best areas to see. The accomodations were more than adequate. All four of the cities where we stayed had many interesting and wonderful areas to see and explore. The group of people we were with on this tour were tremendous as well. Everyone got along well which made the trip very enjoyable as we all were able to appreciate and discuss Ireland together. Both of us agree the one common factor making this trip so memberable and wonderful was our guide and driver Tony. His knowledge and commentary during the trip was so interesting and informative. His detailed historical, social, religious and political information gave us a more complete understanding and appreciation of Ireland and its people. Tony's singing of several traditional Irish songs on the bus was also a bonus. In our opinion, there was not one negative aspect of the tour. We would definitely recommend this tour to anyone and as a fact,we already have. Thanks My Ireland Tour and thank you Tony for providing a wonderful trip for us.\n\nMy two friends and I took the 10 Day Ireland Tour. Our driver/guide was Colm and he made the trip for us. It was a packed, well organized tour so that we could get in as much as we could. Colm made suggestions for eating, shopping, extra sights to see and would go out of his way to find something out for us, accommodate any requests, and gave us great information on the sights we were seeing and the history of Ireland. We saw so much and I know there is so much more to see. The hotels were amazing and the meals fantastic - the soups! There were 24 on our tour, just the right number, and Colm took the time to learn about each and every one of us. It's so hard to pick a favorite place but Connemara and the Ring of Kerry truly stand out. The weather cooperated and was nice, the bus was comfortable, clean and we were able to recharge our electronics, use wifi while we were traveling. I raved about this trip so much, my husband now wants to go. And I could go again because I am sure I missed things because there is so much to see. Martina, Colm, and the whole company made sure our 10 day tour was all that it could be. We didn't have to worry about logistics, Colm got us where we wanted to go, most of our meals were taken care of, and it was great not being in a different hotel every night. The 2 nights in a hotel was just right. Thanks My Ireland Tour for a wonderful experience.\n\nHas to be the best coach tour of Ireland. 10 day Iconic Ireland Tour. We were a party of 4 from UK with 26 very nice Americans. 26 people in a coach for 34 so plenty of room to move around. On board WC and bottled water. Very comfortable coach. The tour packed in a very full itinerary hitting all of the important tourist destinations and many more side trips. Hotels were all good 4-star quality. Food was generally good from a limited menu and very good at some hotels. Suitcases were taken from the coach directly to the rooms. Staff in hotels were attentive and pleasant in all but the Clayton Hotel, Ballsbridge. This was the last hotel on the tour and in the restaurant coach parties were treated as second class customers. Struggled to get a wine list or secure a drinks order. No coffee with meal and no bottled water in the room. Front desk and bar staff were better. They did book a taxi to the airport for us. What really made the tour exceptional was the Driver/Guide Tony McGoey. He has an encyclopaedic knowledge of all things Irish. He gave a comprehensive appraisal of every site visited and provided a detailed overview of the history of the island of Ireland North and South. He outlined the politics of the island both historical and contemporary. He also explained how tax, healthcare, education and driving differs from the US and UK. He kept the tour to time perfectly and even threw in a few additional side trips to pleasant seaside towns. His driving was impeccable instilling confidence in his passengers.\n\nAfter returning from our 10 day Iconic Tour of Ireland, my intention was to write the BEST review ever written for Tom Lavin, our driver/guide, Martina Hegarty, our behind the scenes coordinator, and My Ireland Tours. However, as I read the many reviews on the website, I realized I couldn't top the A++ reviews that have already been posted. I'll give it my best though. I firmly believe that a successful company is only as great as the people who work there. Tom Lavin and Martina Hegarty are great ambassadors for My Ireland Tours. The immediate, helpful, and kind correspondence with Martina was so valuable to us as we planned our tour. She even went above and beyond to help with a last minute request shortly before our tour started. Tom Lavin expertly drove and guided us on our 10 day adventure. We learned so much from Tom about Ireland's history, iconic landmarks, and information about current day Ireland. We loved the anecdotes that Tom added about his life growing up in Ireland and about his family. When Tom talked on the microphone, you could hear a pin drop because his commentary was so interesting, and we didn't want to miss anything that he said. Pretty amazing since there were 26 of us! Tom's leadership, humor, kindness, and patience were appreciated by all. Our itinerary, hotels, meals and included tours were all excellent. My Ireland Tours is a phenomenal company. I will continue to sing your praises to anyone thinking about visiting Ireland!\n\nHow many good things can I say about My Irish Tours. My answer is not enough. Let's start with the tour (Ours was the 10 day Iconic Scenes of Ireland option): The one phrase description that comes to mind is 'well paced'. My spouse and I are past the time when we choose to wake up at dawn and keep traveling til dusk in order to see as much as possible during a day. Our tour day was typically 9 to 6. Part of that is spent resting (and viewing the wonderful countryside) while being driven to another interesting area or place. We saw and experienced plenty of wonderful and interesting areas each day, had good guides for the historical areas, and sufficient time to explore on our own. Accommodations and travel: I can find no fault with the accommodations that were arranged for us. We usually stayed in a hotel for two days while exploring nearby areas. It's surprisingly feels much less hectic than tours where it's a different hotel most days. They were all comfortable, clean, and restful, with pleasant and accommodating staff members. And for others who travel while keeping tabs on work or home, we experienced reliable wi fi at each hotel. The bus used to transport us around Ireland was comfortable, clean, and roomy. A bonus was usb charging stations at each seat, and the bus provided wi fi. People: Two words...just wonderful. Our driver/guide Tony was and is fantastic. Personable, knowledgeable, capable, organized, helpful, entertaining. He seems to have personal contacts at each hotel and attraction. He shared history, background, and anecdotes during our travels. I really want to clone him for our next trip. Martina (at the office) was wonderful at helping us keep track of our trip planning, providing itinerary updates (no major changes) and insights, packing advice (bring a water resistant windbreaker with a hood), and all other administrivia.\n\nWe went on the 10 day iconic tour ofIreland, ,it was my second time with My Ireland., It is is every way a vividly interesting journey through Ireland's landscape and history. Our tour-guide Tom really should be a teacher. His amazing knowledge of Ireland, its people and personality, its history challenges today, gave me a grounding in this place that I would expect to get only from a minimum of a year of living there. Our creature comforts were met at every turn from a variety of interesting and comfortable hotels, to great food from well prepared hotel fare to pub fare to home-made farm fare. with always a choice of great wine, beer or finest Irish whisky! We were relieved of any worry over our bags as we journeyed, every nuance of responsibility taken care of. It would be true to say it was a wonderful group of fellow travelers, but I cant help thinking that if we hadn't been made as a comfortable and organized as we were, I am sure none of us would have been as pleasant or fun, as willing to be curious and friendly. It was all made so easy.\n\nMy daughter age 29 called me one day and said lets do a tour of Ireland. We had never done a bus tour and started researching our options. We came across My Ireland Tours and after much research we decided this tour was the one. Our 10 day trip toured southern Ireland and loved I loved the fact that we had several cities that we spent 2 nights in. Our tour guide Tom Lavin was absolutely the PERFECT tour guide. We could not have asked for anything more! He is kind, compassionate, funny and wanted the 26 passengers on this tour to have an enjoyable experience! And we did!!! We never touched our bags. Everything was done for us. Tom is a true gentleman! Our accommodations were exceptional, the tours were what we expected and the whole experience was better than we anticipated. We met wonderful people from all over the world. My concern was that there would be passengers who were constantly late, but this was not the case. Tom had every minute orchestrated and there was not 1 hitch on our entire trip! If you are planning a trip to Ireland I highly recommend using My Ireland Tours! They are a class act. My daughter and I have memories that will last a lifetime! Thank you Tom, Crystal and all those who helped to organize this wonderful trip!\n\nThis is a review for the Iconic Scenes of Ireland 10-day Tour in May 2017. At first, I wasn't sure if I wanted to do a tour or go solo, but as I was traveling alone in a country I wasn't familiar with ,and I wasn't ready to try driving on the other side of the road just yet), I opted for a tour. I am so glad I decided to go with My Ireland Tours. The whole process was smooth as can be. Kristel was great at answering all of my questions ,including what would be best to pack as I was journeying from the Sunshine State!). Our driver, Brian O'Rourke, was amazing. He was friendly and tried to accommodate what we wanted to see and how long we wanted to spend in certain areas. He gave us some backstory on places we passed, and he took us to a few that weren't on the itinerary! I was so pleased to have taken this trip. The people I met were great, the country was gorgeous, the accommodations were wonderful, and the whole experience was one I won't forget anytime soon. In fact, before we left, several of us were already talking about a RETURN trip. I have recommended My Ireland Tours to everyone - friends, colleagues, even the nurse when I went for my physical! Thank you so much to Kristel, Brian, and everyone who was involved in making such an unforgettable trip wonderful.\n\nWe had an absolutely fabulous trip on the 10 Day Iconic Tour. We were a little nervous due to an age gap within our group ,us being the youngest at 32 years old!, but that quickly went away once we met everyone. The entire group had such a zest for life and infinite curiosity for the country, and by the end of it we all felt like family. Our driver, Brian, truly made our trip special. He was SO knowledgeable and made all of our trips go by quickly with the amount of information he knew about the country and also his humor and kindness went above and beyond. We were grateful that each hotel stay was 2 days so we didn't feel overwhelmed and everything was completely seamless. It was SO nice to have everything planned except for some free time in the afternoon and our hotels were within walking distance of all the town centers so we felt completely safe enjoying the nights out after dinner. We left feeling like we have seen a lot, but knowing there is so much more to see. We would definitely like to return and when we do, we'll be booking a tour through this company ,and requesting Brian if possible)!!\n\nMy family (mom, dad, two sisters, and 12-year-old niece) and I just got back from the 10-Day Iconic Scenes of Ireland tour and highly recommend it! Prior to booking our trip, Shauni was friendly and quick to respond to emails, answering all the additional questions we had. Our driver-guide Don O Donoghue was great! He was informative, funny, and a skilled driver of the coach. The days were well-organized and provided the right amount of time at each attraction listed on the itinerary. When timing worked in our favor, Don was able to add a couple of extra photo ops for us. The hotel accommodations, overall, were pleasing. The included meal options were varied enough and delicious each day. We were also able to request a kid’s menu! However, be prepared to have no minifridges in the room and be patient with the lengthiness of dinners, especially when other tour groups are present! What my family appreciated the most about My Ireland Tour was the flexibility: as long as we communicated with our driver-guide with enough notice, we were able to veer from the group for a portion of time to visit nearby family in the areas we traveled. If you’re looking for a leisurely and comfortable way to travel around Ireland, this is the trip for you!\n\nWhat an amazing trip we had! We did the 10 day iconic scenes of Ireland tour and I have to say, as a first time traveler to Ireland, choosing this tour was the best way to see such a beautiful country. Our tour guide Tom was the best! His knowledge of the areas and his humor made the trip unforgettable. The coach was very comfortable so the days we spent a little more time on the bus weren’t bad at all. One of the things I loved most was how this tour supports each areas local economy. We stopped at the major tourist destinations of course, but also at many small businesses along the way. Being able to support local artists and businesses is important to me, and getting to do this on the tour was great. All of our hotels were beautiful and the food was delicious. Breakfast was a buffet with choices for every palate and dinners were well thought out, always with a vegetarian dish for those who wanted. Each dinner was a three course meal and we never left hungry! Tom was there if we had any issues and the minor one we had, he took care of right away with the hotel management. This tour also was great about making sure any food allergies and sensitivities are addressed before hand. One person in our group had a food sensitivity and never once did she feel that she didn’t have options for her meals. The level of care we received was above and beyond what you would expect. Our luggage was put on and off the coach by the staff and Tom, and then brought to our rooms when we got to each new hotel. The little details are not overlooked! I highly recommend traveling with My Ireland Tour!\n\nWe've just returned from our 10 Day IconicScenes of Ireland Tour and it was fabulous ! Really the trip of a lifetime! The tour bus was clean, modern and comfortable with plenty of room to relax. Our driver/guide Brian was amazing! He was everything you'd want your guide to be. He was funny and kind ( always had a joke to tell!) he was always checking to make sure that we were having fun. Brian was so knowledgeable about the history of Ireland and he was wonderful at explaining various wars and histories so that we could all understand. He seemed to know so much about his country's past and explained it in an interesting way. I can't say enough nice things about Brian! The hotels we stayed in were lovely. Clean and comfortable and very attractive. Most did not have air conditioning, no trouble, we just asked for a fan. Bring your own hair conditioner though, it's not provided. Meals were very good, especially breakfast! Breakfast was a large buffet with many choices. Something for everyone! Dinner was a special menu for the group. Generally 3 choices for appetizer and 3 choices for dinner. yummy desserts too! We were so lucky to have a wonderful group of people on our tour! Most meals you eat together at tables with your tourmates. Several evenings we all went out to various pubs to hear live traditional Irish Music! As for Ireland, words dont do it justice! Its incredibly beautiful and the people couldnt be more friendly! We loved every stop we made! Kylemore Abbey was stunning, Blarney Castle was amazing, The Cliffs of Moher were awesome. Lots of walking and climbing, good shoes are a must! If it sounds like its too good to be true… it was all that! Not one stop wasnt great. Even things that we weren't necessarily looking forward too were wonderful! The sheepdog herding demonstration was an unexpected highlight! I don't think you could do this tour and not enjoy it! After we sadlysaid goodbye to our new friends, we extended our trip into Northern Ireland through My Ireland Tour. We had another wonderful driver/ guide named Simon who took the three of us on a three day tour to the north. This was a more casual trip as it was just us and we could stop wherever we liked. Simon talked to us about our interests, castles and ruins for my sister and I, Game of Thrones locations for my daughter. He was amazing at knowing all the little out of the way stops and amazing photo opportunities! Every day he brought us water bottles and diet coke for my sister who's addicted! Lol His BMW suv was spotless and comfy. He made us feel safe and entertained ! I highly reccomend Simon as a personal driver! On our way to Belfast, we took a ferry through the Mountains of Mourne, drove through lovely little towns and beautiful countrysides making stops along the way. We saw the Titanic Museum in Belfast, then spent the evening walking around Belfast having dinner and found some more live Irish music! Next we went to Giants Causeway and Carrick-a-Reed rope bridge! Stunning sights and so much fun! We spent the night in Derry/ Londonderry. The next day we took an amazing walking tour with a lovely man named Ronan, again set up through My Ireland Tour. Ronan was in a unique position to teach us the history of the walled city. Being a Buddhist, he has an ability to see both sides of the conflict or Troubles as they're known. It was amazing to walk along these walls that are hundreds of years old and hear of the many battles fought throughout the history of Ireland! Definitely a highlight for us. I don't think that I could say enough wonderful things about our tour! We had an amazing trip and met many wonderful people! We all agree that we would highly recommend My Ireland Tour to help you plan your dream trip to the most beautiful and friendliest country I've ever seen! You won't be sorry!\n\nHow many good things can I say about My Irish Tours. My answer is not enough.

We booked this trip for our Honeymoon. We had an incredible time and can not speak highly enough of your tour company and your amazing driver that we had, Tony! He looked after everyone and tried to accommodate any requests, at all times. We never felt rushed or that we were stuck on a bus for too long - he gave us all plenty of time to go adventuring in each town/location. He taught our group so much about the history of Ireland and had everyone laughing quite often, during our drives. I'm sure all of your drivers are wonderful but we highly recommend Tony to anyone looking to book a trip :, The hotels were the nicest we've ever stayed at, the food was delicious and no one ever had to worry about going hungry! We enjoyed visiting all of the different places that we were able to, and felt that every single thing, was very well organized: by your company and Tony, all the hotel staff members, other tour guides, etc. We also really enjoyed getting to know and becoming friends with the 24 other people who made up our tour group. We really loved everything about this trip. Ireland is an incredible place and the people we met out there, are some of the most down-to-earth, witty people around. We will be comparing any future trips to the awesome experience we had on this one. Please continue offering a variety of different packages. Maybe we can visit someday again or better yet, we could just win a lottery and buy a second home in Ireland haha! Thank you so much once again, for everything."
