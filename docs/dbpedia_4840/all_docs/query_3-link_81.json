        "text": "Global law firm White & Case LLP has expanded its Global Real Estate Industry Group and Global Mergers & Acquisitions Practice with the addition of Jacek Jezierski as a partner in Warsaw.\n\n\"With rate cuts by central banks and the resulting decrease in the cost of borrowing expected later this year, we are preparing for an uptick in real estate transactions,\" said White & Case partner Victoria Landsbert, Co-Head of the Firm's Global Real Estate Industry Group. \"In Central and Eastern Europe, over 50 percent of real estate investment is in Poland, which has a significant amount of foreign capital and is home to many of the world's largest investment funds. The addition of an experienced real estate partner with an established network in Poland will enable us to respond to the rebounding real estate market there, equipping us with the capabilities needed to advise clients as they seize on the opportunities in the region.\"\n\nJacek advises domestic and international investors on real estate transactions in the office, retail, logistics and private rented sector, including the acquisition of assets and portfolios, the structuring of corporate real estate joint ventures for development and investment and the negotiation of commercial leases. Jacek joins White & Case from Dentons, where he was a partner.\n\n\"Jacek is a talented partner with a deep understanding of the real estate market in Poland and broad commercial knowledge,\" said Marcin Studniarek, White & Case Office Executive Partner in Warsaw. \"His extensive experience advising on real estate transactions coupled with our existing capabilities in Warsaw will enable us to guide clients through the entire life cycle of their corporate real estate investments, from structure and fundraising to acquisitions, asset management and exit.\"\n\nWhite & Case partner and Vice Chair Oliver Brettle said: \"We have a large and successful Global Real Estate Industry Group that we continue to invest in, as demonstrated by Jacek's arrival and the recent addition of partner John Cahill in New York and Hong Kong. Offering market-leading advice across many of our core practice areas, such as mergers and acquisitions, debt finance and capital markets, the group is perfectly placed to respond to the changing needs of our clients in the real estate sector.\""
