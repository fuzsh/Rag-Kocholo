        "text": "A Huddersfield dad-of-two who had a kidney transplant nearly 17 years ago is set to take on the Tough Mudder challenge on Saturday.\n\nOliver Cahill, a 27-year-old businessman and a colleague are hoping to complete the 15k Mud run/obstacle course at Broughton Hall, Skipton, with 30 obstacles along the way to fundraise for Kidney Research UK and are hoping to raise £3,500. Oliver said: \"My kidneys failed at the age of eight-years-old. At the time I was healthy, there were no signs of kidney disease or failure but I felt poorly for a couple of days, after a visit to my GP.\n\n\"My parents were advised I had a 24-hour bug, but they felt it was something more than this so they decided to take me to hospital. I was admitted to St James's Hospital, Leeds, after two weeks at Bradford Royal Infirmary, I then stayed there for over three months with four visits to the Intensive Care Unit, constant changes in care plans, medication and treatment.\n\nRead more: Shock as Doner Summer shuts its Huddersfield branch after less than a year\n\n\"The damage and affect kidney disease can have on a patient's life, and equally the patient's family is horrendous. There were stages where I had to have my lungs drained, unable to walk and talk at times but eventually I went on dialysis treatment for a couple of years, even in this period of time I was constantly poorly and drained, admitted to hospital several times, missed months of school as well as missing out on normal activities a child should be able to do.\n\n\"Dialysis is a treatment and not a cure, but can leave you feeling constantly drained, tired, and in pain. Eventually, I was lucky enough to receive a kidney transplant which I have now had for 16 years.\"\n\nKidney Research explains why it's so important to raise funds on its website: \"As the leading kidney research charity in the UK, nothing is going to stop us in our urgent mission to end kidney disease. We’re here to be heard, to make a difference, to change the future. This is a disease that ruins and destroys lives. It must be stopped.\n\n\"Over the past 60 years, our research has made an impact. But kidney failure is rising, as are the factors contributing to it, such as diabetes and obesity. Today, we are more essential than ever.\n\n\"Kidney disease affects three million people in the UK, treatments can be gruelling and currently there is no cure. Only research will end this and nobody can do it but us, by offering kidney patients and their families hope for the future. We’re taking it on. But we can't do it without you.\"\n\nOliver who is from Bradford originally has raised almost £2,000 and if you wish to help him achieve his target please click here.\n\nRead next:"
