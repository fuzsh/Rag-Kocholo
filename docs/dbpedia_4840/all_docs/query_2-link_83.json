        "text": "The second season of House of the Dragon has just wrapped up, and with it, we have the news that the prequel Game of Thrones series will get two more seasons in which to brutally murder those who still remain alive.\n\nIn a press conference today, showrunner Ryan Condal shared (per Variety) that the show will only have two more seasons, and that writing on Season Three has already begun, with production set to start in “earlyish 2025.”\n\nWhen he was asked how many episodes we might expect, Condal said, “I haven’t had discussions with HBO about it, I would just anticipate the cadence of the show, from dramatic storytelling perspective, will continue to be the same from Season Two on.”\n\nDuring the press conference, Condal was asked about why we didn’t see the Battle of the Gullet (IYKYK) in the Season Two finale, something that surprised many who have read George R.R. Martin’s Fire & Blood, on which the show is based.\n\n“We were trying to give the Gullet, which is arguably the most anticipated—well, I would say maybe the second-most-anticipated action event of Fire & Blood—trying to give it the time and the space that it deserves,” Condal said. “Obviously, as anybody that’s seen the finale, we’re building to that event. That event will happen very shortly in terms of the storytelling of ‘House of the Dragon.’ Based on what we know now, it should be the biggest thing to date that we’ve pulled off, and we just wanted to have the time, the space to do that at a level that is going to excite and satisfy the fans and in the way it’s deserved.”"
