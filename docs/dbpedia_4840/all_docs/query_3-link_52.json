        "text": "Concept Art is used in games development to gather a common idea of what they want the characters and environment to look like in various conditions and stages. A good game to use for an example would be Fable 3 due to the fact that lots of time and artists were put into making the game look as aesthetically pleasing as possible.\n\nThe image above shows the variation that has been put into different versions of the same model, this is because in order for the game to come across to the player as believable, all the characters in the game have to appear different but contain the same principles. In images like these, more often than not, digital software is involved to make the images look more photo-realistic and therefore, more accurately linked to what the final character would look like.\n\nConcept Art does not have to look realistic for the soul reason that it is ‘conceptual’, however it can be used to show contrast in lighting, mid movement and simply just parts of the characters uniform/clothing. Usually, the art will not just be a still image, but a moving or rotational view of the particular character(s). Shadows become a huge part of the design stage because it gives an idea to the 3D modellers, how to make the character look under various lighting and create the best visual conditions for the character to be represented in the desired way.\n\nConcept Art can also be used to show the visual elements of the game. Things like weapons and vehicles are important to concept so they look authentic in the game world.\n\nThe Gears of War games often come with a booklet containing art work for the game as many hours are spent perfecting the look of the weapons, armour and vehicles. It is important that concept artist come up with a familiar, yet original design so new and seasoned players can connect with the look of the game.\n\nCharacter Art:\n\nCharacter art is also very important as they will more often than not, be the main focus of the game. Artists will spend a lot of time moulding the face and creating a compilation of character expressions. An example of this is in Bioshock 1 & 2 as there a various similar looking enemies.\n\nThis is a Splicer in the game, due to over-using the fictional eve drug, the face of the once-human character has been bloated and distorted to make them characterise the savage animals that they become in the game. The artists will use the human anatomy in order to see how extrusions to the face on this scale will effect how the person would move the muscles in their face to perform expressions. Furthermore, the lack of the ability to move their face normally reflects the idea that the Splicers are no longer in control of themselves.\n\nMarketing:\n\nConcept art also has other productive uses. It can be used to show ‘sneak peaks’ or snippets of upcoming highly anticipated games and also to exhibit the characteristics of the game. For example, before gameplay was shown for Grand Theft Auto V, Rockstar published images of Franklin, Trevor and Michael as well as panoramic shots of the newly updated Los Santos. For example, Michaels artwork showed him with military grade weapons and bags of cash, pointing to the consumer that Michael was a self-made man, Franklin showed as the more up and coming character due to the fact that he looks as if to be involved in the gang side of LS, and finally Trevor is shown as being the ‘do-er’, meaning that he does not look like the friendly one in the trio and that he will go to any length to get the job done.This helped with both marketing and pre-orders as it gave an insight into what the game is going to look like and the stereotypes of the three main characters. Also in a more pragmatic way, concept art would have to be used for marketing as looking at just text for a game does not give you a realistic idea of what to expect."
