        "text": "With both Everton and Bolton agreeing a fee for Cahill last week, it had been anticipated that the former Aston Villa centre-half would complete his transfer to Stamford Bridge this week.\n\nBut a failure to agree personal terms has led to the deal being delayed and, with Bolton rooted to the foot of the table, Coyle insists he has no qualms over naming Cahill in his side for the game at Goodison Park.\n\nThe Bolton manager said: “Gary is available because he’s our player and the only way that will change is if there’s agreement between Gary’s people and Chelsea.\n\n\"Gary hasn’t missed any training sessions and he won’t be at any of the negotiations, that’s why the representatives are there. His focus has always been on the football and he’s preparing for a big game at Everton.”\n\nCoyle expects Chelsea to accelerate their attempt to sign Cahill this week following the busy festive fixture list.\n\nHe said: “I would imagine there will be further dialogue with where they’re at.\n\n\"We’ve agreed the fee and now it’s up to them and the player’s representative to get to a place where they’re both happy.\n\n“They either do that and Gary becomes a Chelsea player or they don’t and Gary continues to do his best for Bolton. We haven’t agreed a fee with any other club.”\n\nCoyle has other problems, with goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen a major doubt with a thigh strain."
