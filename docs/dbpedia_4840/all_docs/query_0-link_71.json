        "text": "By Louis Cahill\n\nI’m starting to wonder if I have joined a cult.\n\nI picked up a copy of “The Mission” magazine at IFTD. It’s a nice looking book. Good printing, nicely bound, free, everything I like in a magazine. I’ll be honest, I haven’t read it past the cover but that’s what got my attention. The subtitle of the book is “The Cult of Fly Fishing.”\n\nI was intrigued by that. I instinctively felt like that was a fair assessment. As I flipped through the pages I noticed the grandiose way the images portrayed anglers and their quarry. It did look suspicious. In a lot of ways fly fishers act kind of cultish, and the deeper you get into it the more cultish it becomes. I think I may have fallen into this, and even contributed to it.\n\nLet’s be honest, we are an odd lot. There is an awful lot of dogma surrounding fly fishing that has very little to do with catching fish. I tried a test. When I found myself in a group of avid fly anglers, I tried listening to the conversation as if I were an outsider, knowing nothing about the subject. I determined that we sound bat shit crazy to the uninitiated.\n\nI became concerned, so I did a google search for “Identifying a cult.” I found this check list.\n\n6 tips for spotting a cult.\n\nPressure\n\nThere is always some kind of pressure to join. This often involves the idea that your belief system in invalid and that you are missing out on some kind of enlightenment or deeper spiritual experience. “CHECK.”\n\nBrainwashing\n\nOnce recruited, members are subject to an organized program of thought reform, or what most people refer to as brainwashing. “CHECK.”\n\nDivine Leaders\n\nCults usually have charismatic leaders who proclaim themselves as having special powers or special insight. And, of course, divinity. “DOUBLE CHECK.”\n\nClosed Groups\n\nThere is usually an inner circle that follows the leader without question, and that maintains a tremendous amount of secrecy.” “CHECK.”\n\nExploitation\n\nTypically cults exploit their members, mostly financially, but often psychologically, emotionally and, all too often, sexually. “CHECK.”\n\nEnforced Loyalty\n\nA very important aspect of cult is the idea that if you leave the cult, horrible things will happen to you. “CHECK.”\n\nI think that pretty much seals it. I’m in a cult. And if you are reading this, chances are you are in it with me. Should we be concerned? Of course not! I mean, we’re right, aren’t we? I know the outsiders don’t understand but they’ll come around. We’ll make them. Then we’ll live in paradise. Maybe I’ll subscribe to that magazine. There was a profile in it of Oliver White. I never noticed how much he looks like Jesus.\n\nLouis Cahill\n\nGink & Gasoline\n\nwww.ginkandgasoline.com\n\nhookups@ginkandgasoline.com"
