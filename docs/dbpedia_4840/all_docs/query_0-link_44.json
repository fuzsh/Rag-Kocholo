        "text": "New D.V.M. Students\n\nWelcome to the Class of 2028! As an incoming student you may feel excited and overwhelmed; however, reviewing and completing the content on this website will help ease the transition and prepare you to start the program.\n\nBelow are two equally important sections: Orientation and Preparing for Classes. Be sure to thoroughly read each. If you have questions, email the contact identified next to the topic heading.\n\nThe D.V.M. orientation team is planning 2024 orientation activities. This website will be updated as more information becomes available.\n\nAttending orientation in its entirety is a required condition of your offer to join the CSU D.V.M. Program. Exceptions will be considered for medical conditions and emergencies. Those seeking an exception must submit a formal appeal via email outlining the reason and providing supporting documentation such as a doctor’s note. Send appeals to [email protected].\n\nSection I: Orientation\n\nIncoming D.V.M. students are required to participate in orientation. Activities planned throughout the week will help students become acquainted with each other and with important policies. Please email Adrienne Marcus with any concerns regarding participation.\n\nStudents based at the University of Alaska Fairbanks will receive an email about orientation and other information unique to this program.\n\nSchedule/Week Overview\n\nStudents are expected to be present for the week-long orientation occurring August 14-18.\n\n2024 Orientation Schedule Overview\n\nThe schedule will continue to be updated throughout the summer with more details.\n\nContact: Adrienne Marcus\n\nVirtual Friends and Family Information Session\n\nFriends and family of admitted students are invited to join us Monday at 5 p.m. MT to hear faculty and staff discuss ways to support students during their journey through school. A link to this virtual session will be emailed to students in early August. Registration is not required.\n\nRAM Outdoor Leadership Experience (ROLE) - CSU Mountain Campus\n\nStudents will spend the day at the CSU Mountain Campus either Wednesday (Aug. 14) or Thursday (Aug. 15) depending on group assignments, which will be communicated in early August. Buses are provided to transport students from Fort Collins to the CSU Mountain Campus, a two-hour ride into the mountains west of town. Please note that we are unable to accommodate requests for specific days. Plan to meet at the CSU Tennis Courts (2400 Research Blvd, Fort Collins, CO 80526) at 6 a.m for a 6:15 a.m. departure.\n\nMountain Campus Guidelines and Information\n\nFriday - Oath and Passages (Coating) Ceremony\n\nOrientation week concludes with a special ceremony to recognize students as they commence their formal veterinary education. There are no dress code requirements; however, business casual is most common. All students are encouraged to attend. Students are able to bring up to 5 guests, and a livestream will be available for viewing.\n\nWhen: Friday, Aug. 16, 2-4 p.m.\n\nHilton Fort Collins\n\n425 West Prospect Road\n\nFort Collins, Colo. 80526\n\nContact: Lauren Mader\n\nSection II: Preparing for Classes\n\nEmail and Setting Up and NetID\n\nTo access required university systems including RAMweb (to pay tuition, accept financial aid, register for classes, etc.), and the university email account, students must establish an NetID.\n\nBeginning in July, D.V.M. Program faculty and staff will send all communication-related materials to your university email account.\n\nFor help checking your university email account, please visit the Email Accounts page from the Division of IT.\n\nIf you elect to establish privacy settings on your email account, then you will not be included on the class listserv and therefore will not receive emails from our office. We do not recommend this for most people. However, if this is necessary for your unique situation, then you must physically come to the D.V.M. Student Services office with a picture ID for us to manually add you to the class listserv.\n\nRegister for Classes\n\nRegistration Tips\n\nCourses for First Year D.V.M.

Curriculum\n\nD.V.M Academic Calendar\n\nRAMweb​ (class registration portal)\n\nContact: Maile Bergknut\n\nRequest Student Disability Center Accommodations\n\nCSU’s Student Disability Center provides support for students with both permanent and temporary disabilities. This can encompass physical disabilities, chronic illness/health conditions, mental health conditions, learning disabilities, and temporary disabilities. The transition into a veterinary program can be difficult for many students. Do not hesitate to make an appointment with the Student Disability Center if you believe you could benefit from certain in-class or exam accommodations. It is better to have these accommodations ready to go before the semester starts than beginning the process mid-semester.\n\nLearn more about the accommodations process\n\nContact the Student Disability Center to schedule an appointment with an accommodations specialist\n\nObtain Rabies Vaccinations\n\nIncoming D.V.M. students are required to receive a rabies vaccination series within 45 days of beginning the D.V.M. Program (by October 2, 2024).\n\nIn accordance with current ACIP and CDC guidelines, our policy requires you to complete one of the following options:\n\nTwo doses of rabies vaccine, days 0 and 7, completed within 45 days of entering the program with a one-dose booster between three weeks and three years following vaccination (no titer taken); documentation of a third dose/booster is required prior to the start of the third year of the program.\n\nTiters documentation with values at or above the minimum acceptable titer of 0.5 IU/mL\n\nStudents who have completed three doses of rabies vaccine previously may submit those vaccination records to verify compliance of this requirement; titers documentation is unnecessary in these cases. However, if students are unable to submit vaccination records, titers documentation is used to verify compliance.\n\nYou may complete the current 7-day vaccination series over the summer through your primary care provider. If for logistical or insurance reasons you prefer to wait until you are on campus, you may schedule directly with the CSU Health Network by calling (970) 491-7121.\n\nNotes on insurance:\n\nCoverage for students with CSU health insurance (SHIP) begins August 1.\n\nStudents with Medicaid should make an appointment with the Larimer County Department of Public Health and Environment.\n\nThose with Kaiser insurance will be required to pay out of pocket if they are seen at the CSU Health Network.\n\nAll other insurances will be billed by CSU Health Network; however, it is the responsibility of the student to consult their insurance company regarding coverage and associated costs.\n\nIf you wish to seek an exemption or delay for any reason, please submit an exemption request as described in the Rabies Policy.\n\nAll vaccination records must be uploaded to your Student Health Portal (select rabies vaccinations from the drop-down menu) via RAMweb. Vaccinations completed at the CSU Health Network are uploaded automatically.\n\nContact: Maile Bergknut\n\nGet a CSU RAMCard\n\nIt is recommended that students obtain a RAMCard by the first day of class in order to access first-year facilities. Consider getting your RAMCard before orientation week to avoid long lines. Make sure to bring proper identification!\n\nGet VTH Badge\n\nAfter carefully reviewing the guidelines below, submit a photo to the director’s office by September 4 at midnight.\n\nPhoto guidelines:\n\nJPEG format, color photo (no black and white)\n\nNo larger than 1200×1600 pixels\n\nAt least 300×300 pixels\n\nPhoto should not be stretched, compressed, too bright, or too dark\n\nSolid white or off-white background (no door frames, wall texture, or other people’s shoulders/arms/hands if photo is cropped from a group photo)\n\nFull face and shoulders only wearing the blue lab smock provided at orientation or a navy blue shirt\n\nLooking straight ahead (no profile or 3/4 angle)\n\nNo hats, caps, or sunglasses\n\nNo animals or props\n\nA straight face or a smile – no funny faces\n\nEyes open/visible, and looking forward\n\nGlasses are allowed as long as there is no glare that hides eyes\n\nHead scarves are allowed, but must not cover the face\n\nReligious garments are allowed as long as they do not cover the face\n\nVetText\n\nVisit the VetText website for information about ordering books and supplies.\n\nVetText New Student Welcome Letter\n\nComplete Required New Student Forms\n\nPlease complete all forms listed below by July 18:\n\nCube Living\n\nD.V.M.
