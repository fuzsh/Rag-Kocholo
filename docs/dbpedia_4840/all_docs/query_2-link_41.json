Myself and James were talking yesterday over a few jars and we both agreed that the guy is the biggest money scrounging b*****d ever alive. James went to the extent of even calling him a bloodsucker. Fairly harsh i would have thought but hes probably right\n\njust like you agreed with me on the davie warren situation i`m gonna go and back you up but with a differant wordoverated\n\nanytime i went to the cross while he was there, didnt see much in him afew runs down the left ,falls gets a free kick, crowd go mad ollie looks good hes a big nothing\n\ni think that the standard of players in the leauge(TEAM) whatever at that time was poor and now our leauge is improving every minute(FCUK DONT I SOUND LIKE PAT DOLAN) he aint the player he was .... why because he was the best off a bad lot in a poor city side\n\nya would have to agree with you on this again. He was a good player in a very poor city side. One of the worst things about ollie though was his workrate. If it wasnt to his feet he didnt care and he would look around for someone to blame and also his constant drifting in to the centre and it was clear that his most potent position was hugging the touchline. To be honest losing him was one of the best things that happened tyo City. It made the board sit up and take notice that after losing him we had nobody capable of creating chances. Now look at us. Alright Ollie beats billy hands down but the players that have come into the team in other positions have transformed us from draw specialists to a winning side. And while this current team needs some fine tuning and possibly some strengthening in different areas the future is looking much more optimistic"
