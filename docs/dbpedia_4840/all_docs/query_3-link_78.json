        "text": "< Last Next >\n\nLINDSAY Cahill Lord\n\nCompany: Norwich University\n\nTitle: Projects & Production Manager\n\nAge: 30\n\nFavorite Part of Job? My favorite part of working for Norwich University is easily the community. The students and the alumni--and my colleagues--are truly amazing, and the passion they have for the institution is catching. Even when my to-do list is completely full, a group of talented students or excited alumni can get me all energetic about a new project. Norwich is based on values of service, leadership, and integrity and those principles guide what we do, which is important to me.\n\nTell us something fun about yourself that few people know: While I am from Vermont, I spent several years in London, United Kingdom and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. I moved to both cities not knowing anyone and having never visited before.\n\nFavorite Vermont Escape: It changes frequently, but lately has been Baker Pond in Northfield. It's beautiful and quiet and my husband Adam and I will pack dinner and take the canoe to fish, or picnic, or just paddle around. It's perfect for a mid-week recharge.\n\nFavorite Downtime Activity: I really love to volunteer. It's what I like to do when I'm not working. It's a great way to get connected to the community and new people. I have been very fortunate to have a great, supportive family, a good education, job that I enjoy, and opportunities. Volunteering is my way to pay that good fortune forward as much as I can.\n\nPerson you would like to share a Vermont beverage with: I'm going to cheat and say two: my grandfathers. I'd love to know their perspectives and insight from all that they saw in their lifetimes. They died before I was old enough to ask those questions. Also they both lived in Vermont for many years, and I think they might get a kick out of Vermont's recent booming craft beer industry!\n\nWhat is the best career advice you have received? Share credit. Always keep a blazer in your office or car, you never know what situation may arise where you will need to make a good impression. And from my father: Listen!\n\nWhat motivated you to live and work in Vermont? I've had some really amazing bosses and coworkers, and great jobs that have all been in this state. It really is my career that keeps me here. I make sure to tell people that a lot, because I think a common assumption is that we're all here because we're skiers or outdoorsy, and the anchor employers are left out of the conversation. Which is a shame--we've got some great ones in Vermont.\n\nCareer Highlights: I graduated in June 2017 with my Master of Business Administration from Norwich University. I was able to begin working in my MBA concentration field, project management, while still in the middle of my graduate program. By the time that I graduated, I already had months of experience in the field, which really underlined for me that I was on the right path.\n\nCommunity Involvement: I am the Director of Communications for Vermont Young Professionals, a statewide professional networking organization committed to attracting and retaining young people in the state. I also serve on the board of Northfield Community Development Network (NCDN), and economic and community development non-profit organization in central Vermont. I have had the opportunity to be one of the founding members of the group, which has been a truly grassroots experience and really demonstrates what committed citizens can accomplish.\n\nI am also a member of the Junior League of Champlain Valley, an educational and charitable women's organization that promotes the leadership of trained volunteers in order to fill a need in the community and develop the potential of women. Through the JLCV, I've been able to connect with and learn from a variety of groups seeking volunteers that have expanded how I've been able to get involved.\n\nUntil April 2017, I was fortunate to be the Family Readiness Group (FRG) leader supporting the families of the soldiers in my spouse's National Guard unit. I loved the Vermont Military Family Programs team and the family readiness volunteers, some of whom were invaluable mentors.\n\nI also participate in the 2017-18 Vermont Changemakers Table cohort, which is a great group from a variety of industries who meet to network and to discuss relevant topics and hear from key speakers. It is organized by VBSR and the High Meadows Fund."
