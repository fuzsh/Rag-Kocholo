Just as the field of ecology focuses on the relationships between organisms and their environments, social ecology is concerned with the relationships between humans and their environment. A key premise is that complex problems can only be understood by considering how people impact and are impacted by the multiple contexts they navigate. These contexts include families, schools, social networks, the workplace, culture, communities and the environment.\n\nFaculty and students in the School of Social Ecology apply scientific methods to the study of a wide array of pressing issues. These issues cluster into three primary research hubs: Healthy People and Places; Crime Prevention and Social Justice; and Technology and Human Potential. Specific problems addressed cover a broad range of topics including stress and coping, the effects of trauma on children and adults, healthy aging, flood risk management, poverty alleviation, sustainable cities, juvenile justice and correctional reform, eyewitness testimony, jury decision making, youth violence and delinquency prevention, policing, crime mapping, and the impact of social media on children’s lives.\n\nThe School is home to three academic departments: Criminology, Law and Society; Urban Planning and Public Policy; and Psychological Science; offers five undergraduate and nine graduate degrees; and has approximately 2950 undergraduate majors, 500 graduate students, 85 faculty, and more than 25,000 alumni. Although faculty are affiliated with an academic department, they are trained in a broad range of disciplines including anthropology, criminology, environmental studies, law, political science, psychology, public policy, sociology, and urban planning. Their research and teaching is distinguished by an emphasis on the integration of the concepts and perspectives from these multiple disciplines. This interdisciplinary focus is based on the School’s core belief that the analysis and amelioration of complex societal problems requires coordinated efforts from several disciplines.\n\nThe School of Social Ecology is a leader in community-engaged scholarship, not only in Southern California, but around the United States and internationally. Undergraduates are afforded opportunities to engage in laboratory-based learning as well as field-based learning through the School’s well-established and highly regarded Field Study Program that includes local, regional, national and international placement opportunities. Graduate training in the School of Social Ecology is organized around the study of contemporary problems and their solutions in the social and physical environment. Emphasis is placed upon theory and research that have implications for policy and intervention. Graduate students work closely with faculty in the classroom, in laboratories, and in the field on important projects that enhance their research skills while advancing knowledge and finding solutions to important societal problems.\n\nResearch Facilities\n\nSocial Ecology I and II and the nearby Social & Behavioral Sciences Gateway building are wireless environments that feature experimental research facilities for studying social phenomena such as parent-child interaction, prosocial behavior, memory functions, stress and health, social support processes, and mock jury discussions. The School also operates wet laboratory facilities to support innovative research in the field of salivary bioscience, as well as behavioral assessment laboratories. Students take advantage of up-to-date computing facilities and assistance to ensure that their skills prepare them for either advanced study or for the changing needs of today’s workplace.\n\nCenters for Research\n\nThe Institute for Interdisciplinary Salivary Bioscience Research (IISBR) pushes the cutting edge of knowledge related to the discovery and application of oral fluid (saliva) as a research and diagnostic specimen. Specific aims are to: (a) incorporate the measurement of indicators found in oral fluids into research - developmental, social, behavioral, health, clinical, prevention, and rehabilitative sciences - and determine whether understanding in those areas can be advanced using unique, minimally invasive measurements of biological systems through saliva; (b) open windows of opportunity for researchers in economics, psychology, sociology, anthropology, gerontology, nursing, social work, preventive medicine, medicine, occupational science, sports medicine, psychiatry, and neuroscience among others, and (c) serve as a world stage for investigators to meet, discuss, and refine their ideas about the role of saliva as a research and diagnostic specimen. Researchers from universities and institutions across the country and internationally collaborate with IISBR. More information is available at the Institute for Interdisciplinary Salivary Bioscience Research website.\n\nThe Center for Evidence-Based Corrections (CEBC) has administered millions of dollars in state-funded research on juvenile and adult correctional programs, including research on rehabilitation, parole and reentry programs, monitoring of sex offenders, and correctional options for female offenders. CEBC, which consists primarily of Criminology, Law and Society faculty, is a nexus for policy-oriented research and graduate training. CEBC also maintains close ties with UCI’s School of Law. More information is available at the Center for Evidence-Based Corrections website.\n\nThe Blum Center for Poverty Alleviation was founded as part of a system-wide consortium that began with the Blum Center for Developing Economies at UC Berkeley, and now includes all ten of the University of California campuses. This federation of Blum Centers is united by the idea that world-class universities must play a leadership role in tackling the world’s most daunting challenge – poverty. UCI’s Blum Center undertakes collaborative interdisciplinary research focused on understanding and alleviating the contemporary challenges of low-resource communities. Research areas include climate change and public health, community engaged flood risk modeling, environmental security and peacebuilding, human trafficking, and the science of compassion. It also has developed innovative courses and programs such as the funding mechanism Small Change Better World and a service learning opportunity called Global Services Scholars to introduce students to the many dimensions of poverty in the 21st century and to provide them with opportunities to make meaningful contributions to alleviating poverty at home and abroad. The Blum Center has an extensive network of local and international partners. The School of Social Ecology works collaboratively with the UCI Division of Teaching & Learning to support Blum Center activities. More information is available at the UCI Blum Center website.\n\nThe Newkirk Center for Science and Society develops and shares research knowledge with the public and policymakers so they can make informed decisions on vital policy issues of law, education, environment, health care, crime, and public infrastructure. The Center carries out its mission in several ways: through workshops, colloquia, town hall meetings, distinguished visitors, and communication programs. One area in which the interests of several faculty members overlap with the focus of the Newkirk Center relates to expert testimony and, more broadly, the use (and misuse) of science in legal proceedings. More information is available at the Newkirk Center for Science and Society website.\n\nThe Center for Psychology and Law (CPL) draws together faculty from the Department of Criminology, Law and Society and the Department of Psychological Science. UC Irvine is one of the world’s leading centers for research in the field of psychology and law. The Center’s primary goals are to foster collaboration and communication among academics, legal professionals, policy makers, and the general public, and to address areas of inquiry where social sciences and legal systems intersect. CPL’s mission is to bridge the gap between scientific evidence and public policy. More information is available at the Center for Psychology and Law website.\n\nThe Center in Law, Society and Culture (CLSC) brings together faculty in the Schools of Social Ecology, Social Sciences, and Humanities who share an interest in the role of social, cultural, and historical factors in the development of law and the importance of social and cultural assumptions in understanding and interpreting law. Law and culture has emerged as an exciting area of legal scholarship and UC Irvine has significant strength in this area. More information is available at the Center in Law, Society, and Culture website.\n\nThe UCI Livable Cities Lab leverages the academic expertise of UCI faculty and students in order to engage policy makers and stakeholders around three important issues: (1) providing dignified housing for all, (2) creating and maintaining safe communities; and (3) promoting social enterprise as a way for faculty and students to have their research and ideas contribute to the greater good. More information is available at the Livable Cities Lab website.\n\nWater UCI serves as a coordinating vehicle to facilitate seamless collaboration across schools, departments, and existing research centers around questions of fundamental and applied water science, technology, management, and policy. Water UCI builds on existing campus-wide strengths by affording a plan for responding to the many “grand challenges” facing water resources, and for which UCI is well-equipped. More information is available at the Water UCI website.\n\nIn the Community\n\nThe School of Social Ecology was the first school on campus to require community engagement as a key component of undergraduate education through the signature Field Study program. Through direct participation in a community organization, Field Study students develop their communication, critical thinking, analytical, methodological, professional, technological, and interpersonal skills. These tools prepare students to be the leaders of tomorrow as they tackle the pressing issues confronting business and community leaders locally, regionally, nationally, and globally. The Field Study requirement for students seeking a baccalaureate degree from the School of Social Ecology or in Environmental Science and Policy (ENSP) may be fulfilled in a number of ways a including: Traditional Field Study (SOCECOL 195), Field Study Writing Seminar (SOCECOL 195W), a year-long Advanced Field Study (SOCECOL 195A-SOCECOL 195B-SOCECOL 195CW), the UC Capital Intern Programs in Sacramento and Washington DC, and the Blum Center/Living Peace/Social Ecology Global Service Scholars (GSS) program (PSCI 192B, SOCECOL 189 along with an summer international service trip). Important note for ENSP students: The GSS program is not an option for satisfying the Field Study requirement for ENSP majors. If ENSP students are interested in the program, they are strongly encouraged to meet with an academic counselor to incorporate the program into their academic plan. More information is available at the Field Study Program website.\n\nThe Metropolitan Futures Initiative (MFI) aims to develop an improved understanding of communities and their potential for integrative and collaborative planning and action to ensure a bright future for the region. With initial focus on Orange County and its location within the larger Southern California area, the MFI is a commitment to build communities that are economically vibrant, environmentally sustainable, and socially just by partnering Social Ecology’s world-class, boundary-crossing scholarship with expertise throughout Southern California. More information is available at the Metropolitan Futures Initiative site.\n\nHonors, Awards, and Scholarships\n\nSocial Ecology Honors Program\n\nThe Social Ecology Honors Program provides the opportunity for selected School of Social Ecology students to pursue advanced independent study. Students may apply in the spring quarter of their junior year. In order to be considered, a student must have satisfied the following requirements: completion of all lower-division Social Ecology courses required for the major; completion of at least five upper-division Social Ecology courses with a grade point average of at least 3.5 in these courses; and achievement of an overall grade point average at UCI of at least 3.2. Acceptance into the program is based upon evidence of the student’s ability, interest in research, proposed thesis project and support from a faculty mentor. Successful completion of the program requires three quarters, including supervised independent work on a thesis research project (SOCECOL H190A-SOCECOL H190B) and written and oral presentation of an honors thesis (SOCECOL H190W).\n\nExcellence in Research in Social Ecology\n\nHigh-achieving students majoring in the School of Social Ecology can earn Excellence in Research in Social Ecology by participating in a two-part program consisting of faculty-supervised research in the junior and senior years and courses in methodology and statistics. To be eligible for the program, students must have earned an overall 3.2 UC GPA in their junior year, with grades of B or above in the required methodology and statistics courses (SOCECOL 10, SOCECOL 13, SOCECOL 111W or SOCECOL 194W, and SOCECOL 190). Students will work with a faculty mentor during at least one quarter by the end of their junior year in PSCI 196 or SOCECOL 198 or SOCECOL 199. Successful completion of the program also requires faculty-mentored Honors research (SOCECOL H190A-SOCECOL H190B) and completion of a senior research thesis or a report at a research conference (SOCECOL H190W). Students who have successfully completed all requirements may submit applications for the Excellence in Research in Social Ecology distinction in the spring quarter of their senior year.\n\nGraduation with Latin Honors. Latin Honors at graduation will be awarded to approximately 16 percent of the graduating seniors based on units completed and GPA. To be eligible, students must have completed at least 72 units at a UC campus by the end of the final quarter prior to graduation. Approximately 2 percent of all majors will graduate summa cum laude, 4 percent magna cum laude, and 10 percent cum laude. The student’s cumulative record at the end of the final quarter is the basis for consideration for awarding Latin Honors. For more information about Latin Honors criteria contact the Social Ecology Student Services Office at 949-824-6861 or visit the Social Ecology website. Other important factors are also considered and can be reviewed at Honors Recognition.\n\nDean’s Honor List. Quarterly recognition for students who earned a 3.5 grade point average while carrying a minimum of 12 graded units. Quarterly recognition is noted on the student’s transcript.\n\nDean’s Award for Community Engagement. This award recognizes highly-engaged students who demonstrate both scholarly achievement and community service participation.\n\nFudge Family Foundation Scholarship. Two scholarships are awarded to outstanding students who have a strong academic record and who have established financial need because they are self-supporting or have other personal hardships that would make it difficult for them to complete their studies without this assistance.\n\nSchool Awards. The School of Social Ecology recognizes the most outstanding undergraduate and graduate students for their academic achievements, contributions to the School, and service to the campus and community.\n\nExcellence in Undergraduate Research Award in Honor of Gilbert Geis.

This award is given annually to a graduate student in the Department of Criminology, Law and Society for excellence in both research and course work.\n\nExcellence in Field Study. This award recognizes students who have gone above and beyond in their field study placements or who have completed an exceptional academic project as part of their field study.\n\nDean's Award for Exceptional Achievement in Field Study. This award recognizes the top one or two students who made exceptional contributions to their field study community partner and excelled in the field study course.\n\nStrauss Scholarship. This scholarship is awarded to an outstanding junior who has been active in service and is planning for a career in public service.\n\nOn This Page:\n\nCareer Opportunities\n\nField Study\n\nAdvanced Field Study\n\nPlanning a Program of Study\n\nAdditional Curricular Options\n\nCampuswide Honors Collegium\n\nSchool of Education\n\nUC Education Abroad Program\n\nInterdisciplinary Minors\n\nUndergraduate Program\n\nThe School of Social Ecology offers either a general interdisciplinary degree in Social Ecology or a more focused course of study through degree programs in Criminology, Law and Society; Environmental Science and Policy; Psychological Science; and Urban Studies.\n\nChange of Major. Students who wish to change their major to one offered by the School should contact the Social Ecology Undergraduate Advising Office for information about change-of-major requirements, procedures and policies. Information is also available at the UCI Change of Major Criteria website.\n\nCareer Opportunities\n\nGraduates of the School of Social Ecology bring a distinctive interdisciplinary perspective to the job market. Students graduate with a wealth of knowledge as well as marketable skills in communication, leadership, critical-thinking, and problem-solving. The School provides an excellent foundation for those students who seek jobs in social services, planning departments, mental health settings, educational institutions, and a variety of community and governmental agencies. Many Social Ecology students find that their interdisciplinary training also is useful for careers in public management, law, consulting, and business.\n\nThrough its dynamic courses and signature Field Study program, the School of Social Ecology provides useful preparation for students who wish to apply to graduate and professional schools and programs of law, public policy/public administration, public health, social work, psychology, sociology, criminology, sociolegal studies, environmental studies, and urban planning.\n\nThe Division of Career Pathways provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques.\n\nField Study\n\nField Study is the signature program of the School of Social Ecology. All majors within the School, along with Environmental Science and Policy majors, participate in the program, which is designed to provide students with the opportunity to examine social problems first-hand and apply theories and empirical findings learned in courses, effectively serving our communities and enhancing the value of their education. The Field Study program is a unique experiential learning program and a key element of the School’s commitment to fostering civic engagement and training future leaders.\n\nField Study promotes community engagement to facilitate civic education through field research experience, social intervention and professionalization. This aim is based on evidence that learning is maximized when it is active, when students are engaged and when theories and research are informed by their application to “real world” problems and solutions. Students reflect on how to apply what they have learned in their courses to address societal and global challenges in a seminar led by ladder rank faculty. At the same time, through placements with one or more of the School’s 225-plus community partners, students gain pre-professional experience and develop their resume along with their academic and research skills. The settings provided for field study include a wide range of problem-oriented institutions and agencies in the non/not for-profit, public and private sectors.\n\nWithin Social Ecology, students may pursue one of three options to meet the Field Study requirement: Field Study (traditional/quarterly), Field Study Writing Seminar (quarterly/also fulfills upper division writing), Advanced Field Study (full academic year), or Global Service Scholars (two academic courses, followed by a global service trip). Environmental Science and Policy majors may choose from either Field Study (traditional/quarterly), Field Study Writing Seminar (quarterly/also fulfills upper division writing), or Advanced Field Study (full academic year)\n\nTraditional Field Study. In SOCECOL 195, students participate in day-to-day activities with a community partner selected from those listed and approved by the School of Social Ecology. Students have the opportunity to participate in the ongoing activities of an organization and develop personal, professional, and technical competencies. While completing their 80 hours at a community-based placement, students meet in a small group seminar with a faculty member to discuss the issues in the field and to develop a project to apply and hone their scholarship. Students may opt to fulfill upper-division writing through taking SOCECOL 195W, similar to SOCECOL 195, but with a strong emphasis on developing writing skills.\n\nAdvanced Field Study (SOCECOL 195A, SOCECOL 195B, SOCECOL 195CW) provides a select number of School of Social Ecology students and Environmental Science and Policy major juniors and seniors with a deeper engaged learning experience over the course of an academic year (three quarters, October - June). During this time they are placed with an agency for 8 hours/week. In addition to working with their agency on day-to-day services and operations, they also engage in a variety of activities in collaboration with their agency. These may include conducting research that enhances the work of the organization, developing new activities or programs, working intensively with clients, engaging in outreach and community organization, participating in organizational development and advancement efforts, and more. The third quarter of the AFS year is designated as satisfying the UCI upper division writing requirement for undergraduates. With that in mind, students will, in addition to the work they do with their community partner, produce an analytical and reflective paper that distills the lessons they have learned from their community placement and, in the process, hones and deepens their writing skills. Students whose work includes original research may be selected to share their work at the UCI Undergraduate Research Symposium held during the spring quarter.\n\nGlobal Service Scholars: Building upon the Field Study program, this multi-part program offers students a unique opportunity to make a difference in the world by learning to approach issues with empathy and compassion. Through classroom work (PSCI 189S and SOCECOL 189) and a service trip abroad, students tackle poverty problems and bring their ingenuity to those in need. When they return to campus, they share their experience through participating in the classroom portion of field study. Funding for this program is provided in large part by the Living Peace Foundation and the UCI Blum Center for Poverty Alleviation. To keep the costs neutral for students, additional funds may be available, based on financial need, to cover airfare, housing expenses and program fees. Not approved for Environmental Science and Policy (ENSP). ENSP students interested in Global Service Scholars are encouraged to meet with an advisor on the field study team to discuss further.\n\nIn addition to the school-sponsored programs, students may fulfill the field study requirement through participation in one of the following programs: Public Health Practicum, UCDC Summer and Academic Internship Programs, UC Sacramento Summer and Academic Internship Programs. Students pursuing these programs should seek advising prior to enrolling in the programs.\n\nField Study embodies the School’s commitment to engaged scholarship, developing interdisciplinary approaches to social problems, and improving and making positive and lasting contributions to communities. Unlisted or inappropriate placements, as well as those that could give the appearance of nepotism or preferential treatment, will not be approved. Departmental approval for field study will be determined by the Field Study Director. Further information, including field study sign-up procedures and prerequisites, program applications, and placement opportunities is available at the Field Study Program website.\n\nPlanning a Program of Study\n\nBecause there are many alternative ways to plan a program, some of which may require careful attention to specific major requirements, students should consult with the Social Ecology Undergraduate Advising Office, 143 Social Ecology I, to design an appropriate program of study.\n\nStudents who elect one of the majors in the School of Social Ecology in their freshman year might begin by taking the introductory courses required by their major. It is a good idea to take these courses early because they include fundamental concepts that are widely applicable in more advanced courses. In addition, the lower-division writing requirement of the general education requirement (category I) should be completed during the first year. In the sophomore year, the student might complete three courses toward the general education requirement, four courses in their major, and four electives. Students who are planning to go on to graduate school can use their freshman and sophomore years to advantage by taking courses in theory, research methods, statistics and other areas important to graduate study. In the junior and senior years, the student should take courses in the major area and should create an individualized program of study through a combination of courses and course modules that fall in an area of interest. Particular attention should be paid to planning a program of study that will ensure that major requirements are met prior to graduation. In the plan, students should include core courses for their major in their junior or early in their senior year. Students should fully familiarize themselves with the Field Study requirements and options by the middle of their junior year to position themselves to find an opportunity that is best suited to them. Students are encouraged to consider one of the many options for enriching their education through intensive involvement in research and/or community engagement through, for example, the Social Ecology Honors, Excellence in Research, and Field Study Programs.\n\nAdditional Curricular Options\n\nStudents in the School of Social Ecology may combine their course work with the following University programs and should consult an academic counselor for further information.\n\nCampuswide Honors Collegium\n\nThe Campuswide Honors Collegium is available to selected high-achieving students from all academic majors from their freshman through senior years. For more information contact the Campuswide Honors Collegium, 1200 Student Services II; 949-824-5461; honors@uci.edu; or visit the Campuswide Honors Collegium website.\n\nSchool of Education\n\nStudents who plan to obtain a teaching credential or a higher degree in the field of education should consult with counselors in the UCI School of Education early in their college career. Students completing a degree program in the School of Social Ecology may qualify for a waiver of the Single Subject Credential Examination. For additional information about teaching credentials, refer to the School of Education section.\n\nUC Education Abroad Program\n\nUpper-division students have the opportunity to experience a different culture while making progress toward degree objectives through the UC Education Abroad Program (EAP). UCEAP is an overseas study program which operates in cooperation with host universities and colleges in countries throughout the world. Visit the Study Abroad Program website for additional information.\n\nInterdisciplinary Minors\n\nThese minors are available to all UCI students. Information is available in other sections of the Catalogue, as noted.\n\nThe minor in Civic and Community Engagement seeks to provide students with the knowledge, skills, attitudes and values to engage as citizens and active community members in the 21st century. The minor is distinguished both by what students learn, and by how they learn it. See the minor for information.\n\nThe minor in Global Sustainability trains students to understand the changes that need to be made in order for the human population to live in a sustainable relationship with the resources available on this planet. See the minor for information.\n\nThe minor in Native American Studies is an interdisciplinary, interschool program which focuses on history, culture, religion and the environment. See the minor for information."
