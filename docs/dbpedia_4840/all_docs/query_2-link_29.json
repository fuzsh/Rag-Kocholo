        "text": "Hi there We all dread that moment when the heating in our properties suddenly stops. The dread and worry about what has happened can be overwhelming. Imagine how you would feel if you started feeling unwell and were eventually told your kidneys are failing and there is no cure.Let me tell you about Charlie. Charlie has nephronophthisis, a genetic kidney condition that causes the tiny filtration tubes in the kidney to malfunction leading to kidney scarring and cysts. It caused Charlie's kidneys to fail when he was 11 years old.Charlie needs a kidney transplant. Both his parents have been turned down as a donor, but they are hoping a kidney might become available for their son soon. Further into the future, Charlie is likely to need several more transplants in his lifetime. For now, lifesaving dialysis is keeping Charlie alive. Currently there is no cure for nephronophthisis. There's no stopping it.Waiting for a transplant and then finding out your new kidney is ready is daunting for children and their families. Through education and awareness, help is available in the form of a beautifully designed interactive book which will help patients and their loved ones understand the treatment that is about to happen. Patients who understand more about their condition and treatment journey feel more empowered and at ease.As many of you may know I am a kidney patient and was diagnosed with Renal Failure as a child. I remember I felt scared and worried about having dialysis and then finding out I was eligible for a kidney transplant. If there had been a book designed specifically for children to understand what was happening to me, I know this would have eased my fear and caused less worry. I need your help. I want supply Leeds Renal unit with 100 books that will be given to children and teenagers, so that they have a better understanding of what is happening to them and what treatments are available. In partnership with Kidney Research UK, I am aiming to raise Â£2,000 before the end of March that will be used to produce these amazing books. Any amount you can donate would be very much appreciated. Should you wish to support me please click on the link below.Thank you for taking the time to read this and for your amazing support"
