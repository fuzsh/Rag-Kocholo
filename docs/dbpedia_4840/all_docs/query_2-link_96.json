        "text": "July 31 1998\n\nTestimonial a show of respect by Shels for former player\n\nby Conor George\n\nSHELBOURNE'S battle-weary UEFA Cup hopefuls will be in Cobh tonight to take part in former Shelbourne player John O'Rourke's testimonial against the club he now manages, Cobh Ramblers. John started his League of Ireland (as the National League was then known) career with the Cobh club, before moving to Dublin. Sadly, however, his playing career was brought to a premature end last season, when he was forced to retire by injury.\n\nAt 27 years of age he became the youngest manager in the National League, when he took over the reins from Ian Butterworth during the summer months.\n\nShelbourne manager, Dermot Keely, has promised to bring his full squad to the match, despite the fact that they were involved in European competition on Wednesday of this week, when they played Glasgow Rangers in Ibrox.\n\n\"The lads may be just a little bit tired, but, we are delighted to be able to take part in John's testimonial match,\" said Keely.\n\n\"It was a shame that he had to cut his playing career short, but, I am sure he will make a fist of things as a manager,\" he added.\n\nO'Rourke and his assistant, Philip Long, have been busy over the summer months scouring the local Cork Munster Senior League teams for new players and have signed four new players in preparation for the coming season.\n\nWillie O'Keeffe, Pat Maher and Seamus Ring have all joined from College Corinthians' MSL league title winning side, while Pat Keane, a brother of Roy, has joined from Temple United, as the manager tries to find the right combination to bring Ramblers promotion to the Premier Division of the National League.\n\nLong has, obviously, also joined from Cork City, after being a member of the squad that won the FAI Cup last May and his experience will be of huge benefit to Ramblers. This is his second spell with the Cobh club, having been a player there under George Mellerick but this is his first taste of management.\n\nThis is also O'Keeffe's second spell with Cobh, having been on the books there before emigrating to America last year. He returned to Ireland last Christmas and immediately joined up with Corinthians. Maher and Ring are both defenders, while Keane is a midfield player.\n\nCobh have also resigned striker Tony Izzi on a two-year contract, after fears that they were going to lose the Naas-based forward to a Northern Ireland side.\n\nAs a mark of respect to O'Rourke, Pat Kelly one of the top referee's in the country during his career, will come out of retirement to marshall the proceedings. Tonight's game kicks-off at 7.30 pm.\n\nAug 04 1998\n\nTestimonial is beginning of test for Cobh Ramblers' manager\n\nby Noel Spillane\n\nSHELBOURNES' Dermot Keely and Cobh Ramblers' John O'Rourke are at opposite ends of the managerial spiral when it comes to League of Ireland football. Keely has been 26 years in the game as player or manager with a variety of clubs and last night he was on hand to offer the new Cobh boss some sound advice.\n\n\"One thing is for sure and that is that Johnno will not go grey overnight from the job,\" joked Keely who brought his Euro weary troops to St Colman's Park last night for young John O'Rourke's testimonial match. O'Rourke, who won two FAI Cup winners' medals under Damien Richardson at Shels', had his career prematurely ended because of knee trouble but now he has stepped into his first managerial role as team manager of First Division, Cobh Ramblers.\n\n\"You go with your gut instincts and it's all down to experience really. I think the longer you are at it the better you get because it's all a bit of a learning curve.\n\n\"You tend to make your own luck as well in this job but I am sure Johnno will make a decent fist of it if he's given the time and the space by the club,\" said the Dublin-based teacher.\n\n\"You need good judgement to begin with, you need to be strong-willed and you can't let yourself be bullied around. You need to be able to make decisions, some of which will not be the most popular in the world either,\" Keely told the fledgling Cobh boss.\n\n\"The other problem for John is that here in the First Division with Cobh he will be trying to work on a shoe-string budget and that's never easy. I have been at this level too and I know what I am talking about,\" added Keely who now has one of the biggest budgets in football at his disposal at Tolka Park.\n\n\"You have to spend carefully, you have to keep an eye on your costs all the time and you have people wanting you to win every match on top of that. Trying to match people's expectations and your own expectations with what is there is very difficult.\n\n\"So I think Johnno needs people to help him out here in his first job in management and if the club expects to win promotion this season then they need to make the funds available to him to try and do the job.\n\n\"I guess with his father as club chairman it might help him out.\n\n\"Starting off like this he's going to need a good committee and good people behind him and I think the correct way for him to go is to try and build up the local identity in the team and bring the supporters out,\" he added.\n\n\"You have to promote the younger players in the squad and stick with them. There's no point in bringing them into the team and then changing it around after three months or so. You can' go changing things like that and you have to stick with it. And there's where you're committee have to be very strong as well,\" he said.\n\nJohn O'Rourke's three brothers Â— Niall, Brian and Ian all made late appearances as substitutes as well in the testimonial match.\n\nAug 14 1998\n\nNewcomers Dobbs and Iorfa to lead attack on Ramblers\n\nby Noel Spillane\n\nCORK CITY newcomers Gerald Dobbs and Dominic Iorfa will get their first taste of local derby football when they lead the attack in tonight's League Cup clash against Cobh Ramblers at St Colman's Park (k.o. 7.30)\n\nDobbs is secure in the knowledge that he has signed a one-year contract with the FAI Cup holders but for Dominic Iorfa, he has yet to convince manager Dave Barry that his immediate future lies with the club.\n\n\"It's a big game for the two of them again but it gives me another chance to have a look at Dominic in action. He is something of an unknown quantity over here and, effectively, he is playing for a new contract now. He's over on trial and we have yet to make up our minds on him,\" said Barry last night.\n\nBarry is anxious to get four of the five players suspended for the Waterford United game over the weekend back in action, and that should signal a return to the first team for the likes of John Caulfield, Jason Kabia, Kelvin Flanagan and Ollie Cahill. Full-back Stephen Napier is still awaiting the all-clear from his doctor to resume full training after a bad virus.\n\nMeanwhile Fergus O'Donoghue, who had a blinder at right-back in the FAI Cup final replay instead of the unfortunate Napier, has been in Dublin to see a specialist for what seems to be a deep-rooted groin injury though the fear now is that it might be a hernia. O'Donoghue met with the specialist yesterday and the 28-year-old defender is hoping for the best. A hernia could keep him on the sidelines for anything up to three months.\n\n\"I will go with a strong team in Cobh tonight and we will go out to win the match. Another win down in Cobh this evening would almost certainly get us to the knock-out stages of the competition and we want to stay involved for as long as possible,\" he added.\n\nCork will probably \"rest\" young Greg O'Halloran tonight after he played in both the CSKA Kiev European match and the 2-1 win over Waterford United at the weekend.\n\nCobh Ramblers boss John O'Rourke feels that this is the right time for his young, emerging team to be playing the Premier Division big boys.\n\n\"Cork are on a high now after winning the FAI Cup and after their superb win in Europe last week and I think it's the ideal time for us to be playing them.\"\n\n\"I always enjoyed playing in the local derbies against them but, I suppose, it will be a bit different for me as a manager.\"\n\n\"It was disappointing to lose to Kilkenny City the other night but it's not the end of the world. I think our lads can raise their game now against Cork and let's see what happens. I know both teams will be up for it and I just hope we get a decent crowd to support us as well,\" he added.\n\n\"Kilkenny learned from their experiences in the top-flight last year and I think they will certainly be one of the teams challenging for promotion again at the end of the season,\" said O'Rourke.\n\nFormer Cork City star Philip Long, now assistant manager at Cobh, will be facing up to his old team-mates and looks set to line-out at centre-half alongside Pat Maher with team skipper John Murphy at left-back and Cobh's longest-serving player, Packie Kelly in the No. 2 shirt.\n\nIf Stephenson fails a late fitness test then young Alan O'Shea from Youghal will continue in goal.\n\nAug 17 1998\n\nJohn O'Rourke's new-look Cobh Ramblers are also in League Cup action tonight when they meet relegated Kilkenny City at St. Colman's Park (k.o. 7.00) Cobh will give a home debut to new goalkeeper, Ashley Stephenson who has recently joined the club on a two-year contract from Darlington. The ex-Waterford United and Kilkenny keeper is back living in Waterford.\n\nCobh will also have highly-rated striker Tony Izzi in action tonight along with new signings Pat Keane from Temple United, Pat Maher and Seamus Ring from College Corinthians and Willie O'Keeffe who has returned from Boston College.\n\nEx-Cork City player Philip Long who brings a wealth of experience to the club will play sweeper tonight with Damien O'Connell, Liam O'Connor, Keith Dalton, Tommy Cregoe and team skipper John Murphy all in the starting eleven.\n\nCobh's one injury is to winger Paul Coughlan. Coughlan has unfortunately been sidelined with a groin strain and he could be out for a month.\n\nAug 31, 1998\n\nCobh off to a flyer to sink Drogheda\n\nCobh Ramblers 2\n\nDrogheda United 0\n\nby Conor George\n\nWHILE it is far too early in the season to be talking about Cobh Ramblers in terms of being candidates to gain promotion they served notice on Saturday night that they are a side not to be taken for granted. They turned in a disciplined performance against last season's Premier Division bottom club Drogheda United at St Colman's Park over the weekend to put what was a nightmare League Cup run behind them and take the first three points available to them for the 1998/99 season.\n\nAfter losing all three of their League Cup group games earlier in the month things were not looking good for the Cobh club but they finally seem to have found a winning combination, as was evident as they led Drogheda on a merry dance.\n\nRamblers have entered uncharted waters this season with the installation of former player John O'Rourke as manager, who at 27 years of age makes him the youngest boss in the National League. O'Rourke and assistant Philip Long searched the local Munster Senior League during the summer months in an effort to strengthen their squad and the three new signings who were on show on Saturday more than repaid the faith shown in them.\n\nPat Keane, brother of Manchester United captain Roy, is enjoying his second spell at the club and very nearly opened Cobh's account after just 15 seconds. He raced into the Drogheda penalty area to get on the end of Liam O'Connor's cross but unfortunately his volley came back off the crossbar.\n\nOther signings, Pat Maher and Seamus Ring, turned in tremendous performances with defender Ring in particular proving his ability to step up a grade with a number of crucial tackles and clearances. Cobh dominated much of the exchanges as a very young and inexperienced Drogheda United side that included five 18-year-olds struggled to adjust to the frantic pace of division one football.\n\nCobh settled far more quickly and this was evident from the number of chances they created in front of the Drogheda goalmouth. Apart from Keane's opening minute effort chances fell to Tony Izzi and Willie Byrne but it took the home side until he 43rd minute to finally open the scoring. Liam O'Connor played a delightful through ball to Izzi who crossed to far post where Anthony Keneally had peeled off his marker and he headed home from close range.\n\nTo be fair to Drogheda they tried desperately to force their way back into the game and would have secured a share of the points but for the brilliance of Cobh goalkeeper Ian Bennis. With just four minutes remaining Drogheda centre-half James Impey ventured forward and when he sent a brilliantly placed shot toward the top corner of the net Bennis somehow managed to dive full-length to deny him.\n\nThat was Drogheda's most clear-cut chance of an equaliser and after seeing that spectacular effort saved their heads dropped allowing Cobh to finally kill off the game in the 88th minute when Izzi raced onto Liam O'Connor's through ball before literally rattling the back of the net with a well placed drive.\n\nCOBH RAMBLERS: Bennis, Ring, Byrne, Long, Maher, Keane, Kenneally, Murphy, Izzi, O'Connell, O'Connor. Substitute: Butler for O'Connell (83 mins).\n\nDROGHEDA UNITED: Byrne, Clarke, Boyle, Impey, Carroll, A. Murphy, Beggs, C. Murphy, Revans, Coleman, Gahan. Substitutes: Nugent for Carroll (63 mins), Ramage for C. Murphy (66 mins), Sheridan for Clarke (80 mins).\n\nReferee: J. O'Byrne (Dublin).\n\nSep 7 1998\n\nSt Francis prove bogey team for Ramblers again\n\nSt Francis 1\n\nCobh Ramblers 0\n\nST FRANCIS chalked up their first win of the season in the First Division Championship when they beat Cobh Ramblers by the only goal of an entertaining game in poor weather conditions at John Hyland Park, yesterday.\n\nSt Francis had the advantage of the strong wind and driving rain in the first half and had by far the better of the exchanges but it looked as if the well organised Cobh defence had weathered the storm when they held the game scoreless just five minutes short of the half time break.\n\nHowever, a little slackness in defence in those closing minutes of the first half saw Brian Rickard get in for a crucial goal. Cobh, with the advantage of the elements after the break, did the bulk of the attacking in the second half but their tactics of playing the long ball high into the penalty area only played into the hands of the St Francis defence. The home side dealt capably with Cobh's main strikers, Damien O'Connell and Tony Izzi.\n\nThe visitors had a break after just 25 minutes play when Kenneally conceded a needless free on the edge of the penalty area and even though Sheridan's clever free kick over the Cobh defensive wall had goalkeeper Bennis beaten, the ball rebounded off the cross bar to safety.\n\nCobh created two good openings in the space of five minutes, when after half an hour, Kenneally floated over an accurate cross from the right but the off-form O'Connell sent a flashing header well wide. Four minutes later, the striker repeated that miss, this time, from a cross by Liam O'Connor.\n\nFull-back Willie Byrne started the best move of the game after 38 minutes, on the edge of his own penalty area and carried on by Pat Keane. Keane cut his way through the home defence and fired in a cracking shot that had goalkeeper Connolly beaten, but it deflected off retreating full-back Treacy and went out for a fruitless corner.\n\nThe breakthrough for St Francis came after 41 minutes. Peter White floated over a long cross from the right and winger Brian Rickard, standing completely unmarked beyond the far upright, sent a looping header back across the goal and into the net with goalkeeper Bennis unable to do a thing about it.\n\nDespite a great deal of pressure in the second half, the nearest that Cobh came to saving at least a point came after 61 minutes. Izzi created a great chance for Ramblers when he floated over a cross from the left that was cleverly turned back by O'Connell. However, the inrushing Keane's snap shot on the run was narrowly wide of the near upright.\n\nCobh hardly deserved to lose this game but St Francis once again proved they are a bogey side for Ramblers. Cobh have yet to chalk up a victory against the Baldonnell side since they were elected to National League.\n\nST FRANCIS: Connolly, Dodrill, Treacy, Heffernan, Duffy, O'Sullivan, White, Sheridan, Talbot, Ledwidge, Rickard.\n\nCOBH RAMBLERS: Bennis, Kelly, Byrne, Long, Maher, Murphy, Kenneally, Keane, Izzi, O'Connell, O'Connor. Subs: Dalton for O'Connor, 39mins, O'Keeffe for O'Connell, 77mins.\n\nReferee: D. McKeon, (Dublin).\n\nSep 10 1998\n\nIzzi helps Ramblers maintain home form\n\nCobh Ramblers 2\n\nHome Farm-Everton 1\n\nTONY IZZI'S rich goal scoring vein continued at St Colman's Park last night as Cobh Ramblers beat Home Farm-Everton by 2-1 in their First Division clash.\n\nThe Naas-based striker, scored in each half last night to give John O'Rourke's young side their second win in three League starts. Home Farm remain rooted to the bottom of the division pointless, along with Limerick FC, after last night's fixtures.\n\nCobh have two away games before their next home game against Longford Town on September 23 and that's why last night's win was so important to them.\n\n\"I am delighted with the start we've made.\n\n\"This win maintains our one hundred per cent home record and we have bounced back after last Sunday's defeat at St Francis,\" said Manager O'Rourke.\n\n\"It was vital we picked up the three points tonight. We were the better team after half time, and could have scored more goals but I have to be pleased with Tony Izzi's return so far,\" added the League's youngest Manager.\n\nIzzi opened the scoring after 12 minutes with a low drive that went in off the upright, after holding off Justin Gleeson to shoot home from Damien O'Connell's header. The visitors were level inside two minutes when Gavin Moore latched on to Robbie Farrell's ball and shot home.\n\nCobh had the better of the second half as Anthony Kenneally's snap shot drifted just over the crossbar after 58 minutes and then team skipper, John Murphy's 60th minute free kick produced a fine one-handed safe from Paul Whelan.\n\nCobh raced into a 2-1 lead after 66 minutes when Izzi took advantage of Ryan Cawley's back pass to slip the ball home leaving Liam Brien's side still looking for their first point of the season.\n\nCOBH RAMBLERS: Bennis; Kelly, Maher, Long, Byrne; Keane, Murphy, Kenneally, O'Connor; Izzi, O'Connell.

Cawley for Darby (half time), McAuley for Benson (80 mins).\n\nReferee: Mr. Paul Mooney (Dublin).\n\nSep 12 1998\n\nCobh survive pressure and grab vital win\n\nKilkenny City 0\n\nCobh Ramblers 2\n\nCOBH RAMBLERS survived an opening barrage from Kilkenny City to snatch the points with goals in each half in this National League first division tie at Buckley Park on Saturday night.\n\nAlthough they opened promisingly and looked like troubling Ramblers, Kilkenny's challenge faded rapidly. During the opening 30 minutes, Kilkenny owned the ball and they peppered the Ramblers defence without success.\n\nThen, five minutes from half-time, Ramblers hit the front with a goal from Liam O'Connor.\n\nIn the second half, there was really only one team in it as Kilkenny completely lost their way. And when Anthony Kenneally blasted the goal of the game after 66 minutes, there was going to be only one result.\n\nKenneally gained possession just outside the 18 yard box and he rifled a magnificent shot to the roof of John Connolly's net for a great score. After that, Kilkenny kept trying but never looked like succeeding in taking anything from a game which their manager, Alfie Hale, will surely want to forget.\n\nBut for Cobh's new boss, John O'Rourke, the youngest manager in the league, the game was a real fillip as Buckley Park has not always been the happiest of hunting grounds for the Cobh Ramblers team.\n\nKILKENNY CITY: Connolly, Kelly, Devereaux, Breen, Walsh, Maher, Foley, Delahunty, Vaughan, Reddy, Reid. Res; Hale & O'Connor for Foley & Maher, 61mins.\n\nCOBH RAMBLERS: Bennis, Kelly, Byrne, Murray, Maher, Dalton, Kenneally, Keane, Izzi, O'Connell, O'Connor.\n\nReferee; Joe Casey, Waterford.\n\nSept 21 1998\n\nAthlone strike late to keep Ramblers off top of division\n\nAthlone Town 1\n\nCobh Ramblers 0\n\nCOBH RAMBLERS missed a chance to go top of the First Division, after they conceded a late goal at St Mel's Park on Saturday night. The Cork club were hit with a killer blow six minutes from time, when Alan Oliver headed home Mark Patton's corner in a crowded goal-mouth.\n\nAfterwards, manager John O'Rourke lamented the missed opportunity. \"To be fair to Athlone, they deserve their three points, we just didn't get going.\n\nO'Rourke expressed his disappointment at the loss of Anthony Kenneally due to suspension. Kenneally will also miss Cobh's home game against Longford Town on Wednesday night. Cobh were reduced to few chances over the 90 minutes. Their best effort in the first half came in the 34th minute, when Willie Byrne forced Anthony Keenan to tip over a free kick. Damien O'Connell went close with a header on the hour but, in truth, it was Athlone's night.\n\nATHLONE TOWN: Keenan; Oliver, Houlihan, Malone, Silke, Fortune, Kelly, Carberry, Frawley, McGee, Patton. Sub: Reynolds for Patton (86).\n\nCOBH RAMBLERS: Bennis; Kelly, Byrne, Murphy, Maher, Dalton, O'Keeffe, Keane, Izzy, O'Connell, O'Connor.

Skipper John Murphy, disappointed with his team's fall from grace in the midlands over the weekend reckons the fact that Cobh are playing again so soon after the Athlone Town defeat, is a good thing.\n\n\"At least, the 1-0 defeat up at Athlone will not fester in the players' minds now. We are back in action tomorrow night and we have to go after a home win against mid-table opposition like Longford Town.\"\n\n\"We have every incentive to go out and win the match now because we have a chance to go back on top again,\" added the Cobh centre-half who has skippered the team for the last two years.\n\n\"We have everyone bar Philip Long available for tomorrow night's game at St Colman's Park, and we all want to put what was a below-par performance up in Athlone behind us. We are just two points behind the leaders, Galway United, but we have the opportunity to go top again now if we win at home,\" added Murphy.\n\nCobh will again miss the creative midfield influence of Anthony Kenneally as the ex-Cork City star serves out a two-match ban. Keith Dalton looks set to stay in the team in his absence with Liam O'Connor, Pat Keane and Willie O'Keeffe filling the other midfield roles.\n\nThe club's assistant manager Philip Long is ruled out again by injury so Murphy will partner ex-College Corinthians' star Pat Maher at the back with Limerick-based goalkeeper, Ian Bennis who was recommended to the club by Cork City's Noel Mooney, continuing in goal.\n\n\"We have to grasp the nettle now and go out and prove ourselves all over again but, with home advantage, you have to fancy our chances,\" said Murphy, who said that he could make no excuses for Saturday's narrow defeat by Athlone.\n\n\"We did not deserve to get anything out of the Athlone match. It was a below-par performance from us and the lads know that. It's up to us all to bounce back now and get the win we want to keep us in touch with the top clubs and keep our promotion bid alive,\" he added.\n\nSept 24 1998\n\nCobh upset by Longford\n\nCobh Ramblers 0\n\nLongford Town 2\n\nby Noel Spillane\n\nLONGFORD TOWN denied Cobh Ramblers the chance to go back into joint leadership of the First Division, when they scored a shock 2-0 win over the home team at St Colman's Park last night.\n\nIt was a second successive setback for John O'Rourke's young side, as a Vinny Perth penalty and a headed goal by Alan Merriman eased Longford into a comfortable half-time lead.\n\nLongford, seeking only their third win of the season, surprised the home team when they grabbed a 22nd-minute lead. Cobh's Keith Dalton brought down Merriman inside the box, allowing Perth to drill home the subsequent penalty.\n\nThe foul was a little naive by the Cobh midfielder, as the Longford Town midfield man was running out of space and any decent angle as he chased the ball into the penalty area. It was a rash sliding tackle from young Dalton and one that centre-half Perth fully punished, when he beat goalkeeper Ian Bennis with a low drive into the bottom corner of the net.\n\nCobh conceded another soft goal just before half-time, when Wesley Byrne's 42nd minute corner kick was headed home by Merriman. It might have been a different tale, nevertheless, had Cobh's Willie O'Keeffe not squandered a glorious chance after just 17 minutes play. Cobh pieced together a sweeping attack, with Pat Keane and Tony Izzi involved in the build-up and, when Izzi squared the ball back for O'Keeffe, he looked certain to score, but, goalkeeper and my man-of-the-match Stephen O'Brien got down to hold the side-footed shot.\n\nO'Brien made two more fabulous saves in quick succession to deny Pat Keane and Willie Byrne in the second half, but, it was a best-forgotten night for the home team, who were experiencing their first home league defeat of the season.\n\nCOBH RAMBLERS: Bennis; Kelly, Maher, Murphy, Byrne; O'Keeffe, O'Connor, Dalton, Keane; O'Connell, Izzi.

After losing their first four league matches this season, Limerick have now won their last three. But it's very much the other way round for Cobh Ramblers who picked up full points from their opening three outings only to lose each of the next three.\n\nThe latest blow came yesterday at Rathbane, where it was very much a case of two penalties which settled the issue in favour of the home side. Both involved the luckless Ramblers goalkeeper Ian Bennis, ironically enough a Limerickman.\n\nLimerick's first two goals came from the spot after Bennis had been left so exposed by his defence that he had little option but to concede the penalties that handed Limerick the points. Not alone that, but Bennis was red-carded for his second offence which left his side to play out almost the entire second half with ten men.\n\nVery often, such a handicap inspires a side but such was not the case yesterday as Ramblers who found themselves under constant pressure until they finally conceded a third goal shortly before the full-time whistle.\n\nLimerick leapfrog Cobh in the table on scoring difference as a consequence of this result. But little else has changed at Hogan Park, where the attendance yesterday afternoon was little more than a hundred strong.\n\nIt was Limerick goalkeeper Eddie Hickey who was by far the busier in the opening stages when Cobh were at their most dangerous. However, Limerick settled quickly enough and Ramblers were subsequently rarely seen as a potent force.\n\nInstead, it was Limerick who took the lead on 21 minutes when Howie King raced away from the leaden footed Cobh defence as he chased a Ray O'Halloran through ball. Bennis approached and as the pair clashed, King went to ground. Dublin referee Meier pointed to the penalty spot and King made no mistake.\n\nCobh were in further trouble immediately after the interval when a fine pass by Paddy Doyle sent Derek O'Neill clean through. This time, Bennis' challenge was more calculated and as another Limerick player went down inside the box, it was clear that the keeper's direct involvement was at an end. Bennis was duly shown the red card as Cobh introduced reserve goalkeeper Alan O'Shea and withdrew Willie O'Keeffe.\n\nO'Shea was unable to stop King's penalty shot and after that it all fizzled out, Ramblers apparently lacking the will to do much about their situation and Limerick happy to hold on to their advantage until finally in the 84th minute Garret Ryan made sure with a cracking ground shot from the edge of the box.\n\nLIMERICK: Hickey; Hanrahan, O'Halloran, D.

To score two goals on my debut is really special,\" said Francis.\n\n\"I am overwhelmed myself but what about the overall performance of the team? Galway are league leaders and they came here and played some nice football but every time they looked like threatening us we snuffed them out.\n\n\"I have come to hopefully prove to people that I can still do the business and to re-build my career after what have not been the best years of my life football wise and this is a perfect start. To get two goals on my debut and three points off the league pace-setters is a dream start,\" added Francis.\n\nFrancis, on loan from Shamrock Rovers for the season, was particularly impressive on Saturday night as was Pat Keane, Pat Maher and Keith Dalton but for Galway manager Don O'Riordan there was only disappointment after watching his side's seven match unbeaten run come to an end.\n\n\"I suppose people will say that it has to happen some time but I am not happy with the way we have lost it. Taking nothing away from Cobh they totally deserved the victory.\n\n\"Maybe our lads have been reading the publicity that has followed them this season and thought that they were going to have it easy.\n\n\"The lesson we should take away from the game is that the league is very competitive and if you don't compete you won't win games and we cannot afford to play like that again,\" said O'Riordan.\n\nCobh set about the task of dismantling Galway from early on and began to apply pressure almost from the very start with Tony Izzi and Francis both going close before Pat Keane opened their account with a superb header from a Francis cross after 32 minutes.\n\nCobh held their lead into the interval and on the resumption went back on the offensive with Keane being denied on two occasions before Francis opened his account with his new club. He scored his first after 76 minutes when he came out on top in a one-on-one face-off with the Galway goalkeeper and added his second just two minutes before full-time when he finished off a superb run by Keane to make it 3-0 at the end.\n\nO'Rourke was delighted with his team's performance : \"I am very happy with the result, especially as it brings us to within three points of the top and ends the rot that had settled in over the last three games. We needed to get something out of tonight's game, especially after the last three results and to have the league leaders come here and have us beat them by three goals is extremely pleasing.\n\n\"All the lads performed brilliantly tonight and now with the addition of Sean (Francis) we are back playing the type of football I want the team to play here and hopefully we can now build on that and become a force in the division,\" said O'Rourke.\n\nCOBH RAMBLERS; Bennis, Kelly, Cregoe, Murphy, Maher, Dalton, Keneally, Keane, Izzi, Francis, O'Connor.\n\nGALWAY UNITED; Cobey, Rossiter, Gorman, Carter, Cleary, Neary, Forde, O'Connor, Lucas, Lavine, Watson.

In the end, a draw was possibly a fair result and Rambler's manager, John O'Rourke, was reasonably content to have escaped with a point.\n\n\"We should have wrapped it up by half time,\" said O'Rourke afterwards.

First choice goalkeeper Ian Bennis, who is based in Limerick and was recommended to the club by Cork City's Noel Mooney, is serving a one-match suspension and he will be replaced by young Alan O'Shea from Youghal, Co. Cork.\n\nBennis was one of the stars in Cobh's 1-1 draw with Drogheda United but a sending-off against Limerick FC means that he has to sit out tonight's clash against one of Cobh's bogey teams.\n\n\"Someone told me that we have yet to beat St. Francis in three years of rivalry between the teams. I know we lost up there 1-0 last year so we owe them one tonight,\" said manager John O'Rourke, who is the youngest manager in the League of Ireland.\n\nO'Shea, who played in goal for the Mouscron reserve team in Belgium when ex-Cobh man Terry Kearns was at the club, started the season in goal for Ramblers and played all their League Cup ties. Now he gets the chance to step into the spotlight again in what will be the only change in O'Rourke's team.\n\n\"I have no injuries to deal with tonight but the loss of Ian Bennis is a blow for us. I have full confidence in Alan O'Shea and it would be great if he could keep a clean sheet for us,\" said O'Rourke.\n\n\"I was disappointed that we did not win up in Drogheda because we were a goal up at half-time. If we had scored a second I think we would have won it okay. Ian Bennis did well in goal that night but overall we have played better in other games this season and lost,\" he added.\n\n\"I think the best win we have had so far was that 3-0 win over Galway United. That was Sean Francis' debut for us and he scored twice and Pat Keane got the third goal.\n\n\"It was a great performance and a great result for us but it was a game that we started well and that was half the battle. That's something that we need to work on but if we can reproduce that form tonight I think we can win again,\" he said.\n\n\"Sean Francis is on loan with us hopefully to the end of the season but he is still a retained player by Shamrock Rovers. He was in-and-out of the team at Rovers and he had a few injuries to cope as well but I know he is enjoying his football with us,\" added O'Rourke of his new on-loan signing.\n\nThe Cobh boss will look to striker Tony Izzi and Francis again tonight to come up with the goals but he is always hoping that midfielder Pat Keane can improve his ratio of goals as well.\n\n\"Pat gets into the box well and he sets up chances for the others but I'd like to see him get a few more goals and hopefully he will get in on the scoring act,\" he added.\n\nThe other big boost for the home team is winger Paul Coughlan is back in the squad. Coughlan has been a long-term injury casualty with groin and hamstring injuries.\n\nOct 25 1998\n\nRamblers race to easy victory despite treacherous conditions\n\nCobh Ramblers 4\n\nSt Francis 1\n\nby Conor George\n\nCOBH RAMBLERS recovered from an early shock to easily sink St Francis at St Colman's Park on Saturday night, thanks to goals from Liam O'Connor and Tony Izzi. After a disastrous start, when they conceded a goal after only three minutes, Ramblers settled down admirably. With a near gale-force wind making life very difficult for the players it was Cobh who adapted better to the conditions and immediately began to exert their dominance.\n\nCobh could not have wished for a worse start to the match when a half-hearted back-pass from Tommy Cregoe was easily intercepted by Paul Irwin and he made no mistake from close range despite the attentions of John Murphy.\n\nCobh, however, forced their way back on level terms after just 12 minutes when an Anthony Keneally pass released Pat Keane and when his shot came back off the upright Liam O'Connor was on hand to steer the rebound into the empty net.\n\nCobh were well worth the goal now as they had reacted positively to the early setback suffered and were playing some of the best football seen at St Colman's Park this season despite treacherous conditions and they fittingly surged into the lead after 27 minutes.\n\nThis time O'Connor chased a seemingly hopeless ball and proceeded to pass two defenders before drilling it low to the near post where Izzi was on hand to score his fourth goal of the season. Cobh continued to harass the St Francis and St Francis could find no respite from the siege.\n\n\"What is very encouraging for me is that we bounced back so well from the concession of that sloppy early goal,\" said Cobh manager John O'Rourke.\n\n\"On the last three occasions St Francis have come to Cobh they have left with the three points. Thankfully that record was broken. We were the better side and after last weekend's draw in Drogheda it is nice to continue the good work we started,\" said Cobh manager John O'Rourke.\n\nCobh extended their lead four minutes before the half-time interval when a Pat Keane cross expertly picked out Izzi who gave Cobh a commanding half-time lead. St Francis were briefly threatening 20 minutes after the resumption when John Murphy was adjudged to have brought down Derek Watters and St Francis were awarded a penalty but Alan O'Shea saved and St Francis' night went downhill.\n\nO'Connor brought the curtain down on a great night for the St Colman's Park faithful when he grabbed his second after 83 minutes.\n\nCOBH RAMBLERS: O'Shea, Kelly, Cregoe, Murphy, Maher, Dalton, Keneally, Keane, Izzi, Francis, O'Connor.

Ramblers forced three early corners before deservedly taking the lead on 22 minutes.\n\nA quick free-kick from Willie Byrne found the white boots of Sean Francis unmarked in the box and Francis calmly side-footed passed Paul Whelan in the Home Farm goal from about 10-yards-out. Cobh once more caught the Home Farm defence asleep to strengthen their grip on the match within a further minute.\n\nA good move up the right involving Pat Keane and Anthony Kenneally resulted in a mistake from Whelan, who failed to gather Kenneally's ball into the box, and Tony Izzi pounced for a poachers goal. Home Farm got back into the game on the half hour with the best goal of the match.\n\nGavin Moore and Robbie Farrell combined up the right with Farrell squaring the ball to Darryl Mooney who shot passed 'keeper Alan O'Shea, whose display against St Francis on Saturday meant he kept his place in goal.\n\nCobh responded positively and restored their two goal lead five minutes before the break when a quick throw-in caught out the Farm defence once more and central defender Justin Gleeson pulled down Izzi inside the area. Izzi picked himself up to shoot home the penalty in off the cross bar for his seventh league goal of the season.\n\nThe second half was less eventful with Home Farm coming more into it as they chased the game. But it was Cobh who should have increased their lead on 70 minutes when Izzi set up Francis who forced the save of the match from Whelan, turning the strikers low shot from the edge of the box round the post.\n\nHome Farm did get some late reward with a second goal for Darryl Mooney in the final minute when he scored with a rising shot into the top corner of O'Shea's net from 20 yards as Cobh easily held on for a deserving three points.\n\nHome Farm Everton: Whelan, Flanagan, Keenan, Gleeson, Fitzpatrick, Byrne, D.

If we continue to play this well there is no-one who can touch us.\n\n\"Once we continue to stay largely injury-free, avoid too many suspensions and continue to work hard I am sure that we will join the top flight at the end of the season. There is no reason why we shouldn't.\n\n\"We are playing very well at the moment although it is a bit worrying that there are periods in every game when we seem to fall asleep and take the foot off the gas.\n\n\"It happened again tonight for the early exchanges in the second half when we just stopped working and allowed Kilkenny to come at us and they very nearly stopped us in our tracks when they got a goal back with just 12 minutes remaining.\n\n\"Thankfully we got our act together and scored a third goal to kill them off and secure the three points but really we have to cut out lapses like that if we are to keep the pressure on at the top of the table,\" said Kenneally.\n\nCobh opened the scoring after 26 minutes when full-back Willie( Byrne unleashed an unstoppable free-kick that sailed over the defensive wall and into the top corner of the net to get Cobh's match started.\n\nThey continued to apply the pressure after the opener and with Kilkenny struggling to get to grips with the pace of the game and a second goal for the home side was almost assured. That eventually came on 37 minutes when Kenneally raced onto a Willie Byrne header, exchanged passes with Sean Francis and then superbly directed the ball over the advancing John Connolly to the back of the net.\n\n\"That was a nice feeling. I don't score too many goals and it is nice to get on the scoresheet. We are all scoring goals regularly which is what is driving us on.\n\n\"Tonight there were three different scorers and that has to be a good omen.\n\n\"We are not relying on any one source for the goals and that takes the pressure off everyone involved and that is where we are strong this season,\" Kenneally added.\n\nAfter turning over with their two goal advantage intact, Cobh(inexplicably began to rest on their laurels at the outset of the second period and this was all the motivation Kilkenny needed to try and force their way back into the game.They reduced the arrears to just a single goal on 78 minutes when the pace of half-time substitute Dave Walsh took the Cobh defence by surprise and his low show beat Alan O'Shea at his near post.The concession of that goal finally sounded a warning to Cobh and they once again stepped up their efforts and killed off the match right on full-time when Tony Izzi raced onto a clearance from Philip Long to grab his eighth goal of the season and secure the three points.\n\nCOBH RAMBLERS; O'Shea, Kelly, Byrne, Murphy, Maher, Dalton, Kenneally, Keane, Izzi, Francis, O'Connor.

The top two now meet head-on at Strokestown Road in Longford next Saturday night and something has to give !\n\nOn a miserably wet and windy night, Cobh rattled in three goals inside the opening 34 minutes at St Colman's Park. Liam O'Connor started the ball rolling when he cracked home a 25th minute opener from Tony Izzi's cross and then the ex-Shelbourne man and the league's top scorer brought his goals haul to ten for the season with two inside five minutes.\n\nCobh's second goal coming after 29 minutes was a delightful effort as Izzi chipped goalkeeper Gary Connaughton from the edge of the box after approach work by Philip Long and Sean Francis. This gave Cobh a comfortable 2-0 lead despite the fact that it was Athlone who looked the more lively team at the start.\n\nPaul Coughlan back in the team after a lengthy injury lay-off with groin and hamstring injuries set up the third when he found Pat Keane sprinting clear of the defensive cover along the left hand touchline. Keane's measured cross found the unmarked Izzi in the box and he side-footed home his tenth goal of the campaign giving Cobh a 3-0 cushion after 34 minutes play.\n\n\"I think the end justified the means to be honest and while Athlone were looking to have the game called off at half-time, once the referee decided to start it he had no option but to finish it. The weather did ease up a little in the second half but to be fair to the grounds staff the pitch held up well in one of the worst nights for football I have ever seen,\"\" said Cobh boss John O'Rourke.\n\n\"We are unbeaten in five since we drew 1-1 away to Drogheda United and now we face Longford Town next week and get the chance to draw level with them on points. It could not be much better for us at the minute,\" enthused the youngest manager in League of Ireland football.\n\nCobh absorbed the bulk of the pressure in the second half as the visitors came more into the game. Colin Fortune forced young Alan O'Shea to a flying save from a free kick after 52 minutes Izzi was close to a hat-trick shooting wide after the restart and Paul Coughlan headed just wide from Packie Kelly's driven cross mid-way through before on-loan striker Sean Francis scored the night's fourth goal from Izzi's pass five minutes from time.\n\nThe Shamrock Rovers man, on loan till the end of the season was off balance as the ball arrived at his feet but he volleyed it past Gary Connaughton who collided with the opposite post in trying to keep the ball out.\n\nThe young Athlone 'keeper was slightly concussed and had to be replaced by the veteran Anthony Keenan for the final minutes.\n\nCOBH RAMBLERS : O'Shea; Kelly, Maher, Long, Byrne; L.

It was disappointing to play so well and to come away with nothing to show for it. I can't blame the players, because they gave it everything. We didn't have the luck on the night, but then again, we didn't make our own luck either,\" added the Cobh boss.\n\nLongford, who won the corresponding match in Cobh by the same scoreline, had the psychological advantages of scoring just before half-time from a non-disputed penalty, but they hit Cobh with the killer blow eight minutes into the second half.\n\nO'Rourke said he had no complaints about the 45th minute penalty that presented Longford's Vinny Perth with the opportunity to give the home team the lead and he duly obliged from 12 yards. \"Keith Dalton was a bit late on Enda Kenny inside the box and the referee had no choice but to give it. If it happened at the other end, I would have gladly accepted it too.\"\n\nEight minutes into the second half and Longford's young, energetic team hit Cobh with another sucker punch, when local boy Enda Kenny hit a beauty into the top corner, after centre-forward James Farrell got a knock-down on sweeper Paul Flanagan's 53rd minute free kick from near the half-way line.\n\nStephen Kenny, the man behind the on-going Longford revolution, praised both teams for the quality of football they produced, but the basic difference between the teams was that the home team took their chances.\n\n\"It could have been 5-5 out there tonight and I just hope the big crowd all appreciated such open and attacking football from both sides. Our lads took their chances, (its as) simple as that in the end,\" Kenny said.\n\n\"We have a small team with big hearts here at Longford Town, but they are big in terms of ability too and I think we proved that again tonight. It's terrific for us to see so many people coming out to see us play because, not so long ago, we had only 50 or 60 people here for our first home league game against Limerick back in early September.\"\n\nLONGFORD TOWN: O'Brien; McGurn, Kavanagh, Flanagan (capt), Thompson; McNally, Merryman, V.

And Cobh Ramblers' assistant manager, Philip Long, the ex-Cork City star who won an FAI Cup winners medal last May is convinced that Ramblers will be involved in the final shake-up at the end of the season.\n\n\"They way I see it Longford Town, Drogheda United, Galway United and ourselves will be in the hunt for promotion come the end of the league season. I am surprised that Kilkenny City are not in the equation because on paper they looked like they might run away with it. Perhaps they will come good after Christmas and make it even more interesting,\" said Long.\n\n\"With all due respects to the other clubs, I think those four teams will be in for the long haul and we intend to be one of the two clubs to go up,\" said Long who works as assistant to John O'Rourke at Cobh.\n\n\"Drogheda United are in the driving seat in that they have a game in hand against Limerick and they are just five points behind Longford, we are six points off the pace.\n\n\"Drogheda are probably the more physical of the four teams I have mentioned but Galway and Longford are well-balanced sides and like to play nice, attacking football like us,\" he said.\n\nCobh have two slight injury doubts for tonight's home clash with Dave Connell's Limerick at Cobh (7.00) with striker Tony Izzi hoping to play after a dead leg at Longford and longest-serving defender Packie Kelly troubled with a sore back.\n\nManager O'Rourke hopes that both will come through late fitness tests and he can name an unchanged team for tonight's eagerly-awaited Munster derby. Both O'Rourke and Long have again appealed to the townspeople of Cobh to come out and support their home town club after both were highly impressed by the healthy turnout of 1,200 fans for Cobh's visit to Longford last week.\n\nLimerick beat Cobh by 3-0 in the corresponding match at Rathbane and after last week's setback at Strokestown Road, Cobh have a double incentive to do well tonight.\n\n\"Things just didn't go well for us against Longford because we could have been two or three up before they scored from a spotter just before half-time. But I think we can bounce right back though tonight,\" said Long.\n\nCobh will look to that blend of youth and experience to get them back to a winning formula as Alan O'Shea (21), Keith Dalton (21), Liam O'Connor (19), Willie Byrne (21) and Tommy Butler (22) join forces with the likes of Packie Kelly, Pat Keane, Tony Izzi, Sean Francis, Pat Maher and John Murphy.\n\nLimerick boss Dave Connell has Declan Considine back in the travelling party and the big plus for him is that first choice goalkeeper, Eddie Hickey is back after a two-match ban. Limerick had a total of ten goals put past them in their last two games but they also have a major problem scoring goals managing to hit just seven in the last six games.\n\nNov 23 1998\n\nIzzi leads from front as Ramblers maintain place in promotion race\n\nCobh Ramblers 1\n\nLimerick FC 0\n\nby Noel Spillane\n\nTHE First Division's top striker, Tony Izzi of Cobh Ramblers, is being driven by a double incentive this season. The ex-Limerick and Shels' star bagged the match-winning goal eight minutes from the end against Limerick at St. Colman's Park on Saturday night to claim his 11th league goal of the season and his eighth in six games.\n\nIt was a real poacher's goal, as the diminutive striker swept the ball high into the roof of the net after Keith Dalton's touchline cross arrived at his feet in the box courtesy of a defensive blunder.\n\nIzzi, as is the norm, was first to react to the half chance as he wheeled away from his marker to smack the ball first time high into the net, and out of nothing, Cobh had won all three league points and eased into second place in the promotion race, just four points behind Longford Town.\n\n\"I want to help Cobh into the Premier Division and I also want to be the First Division's top goal-scorer again,\" said Izzi.\n\n\"I feel confident of achieving both my targets now. I was top scorer here two years ago with 14 league goals and that was a record for me. I had 13 with Limerick the year before I moved here but I am very happy with the way things are going,\" said Izzi.\n\n\"When things are not going right for you in a match like tonight's you always have to be alert and tuned-in. You have to be on your toes all the time because you never know when the chance will come.\n\n\"I think this is going to be the best season yet for me. I am playing with a better Cobh team and we are creating lots of chances.\"\n\nOn a night of continuos drizzle and a swirling wind that made it difficult for both teams, Cobh certainly laboured against an opposition that should have been one or two goals up by half-time.\n\nBobby Ryan and Tommy Lynch combined to set up Paddy Doyle after just 13 minutes but he blazed the ball high over the crossbar from in front in goal in what was a warning shot to the home side. Goalkeeper Alan O'Shea was nearly embarrassed when he took his eye off a back pass and the ball rolled beyond him before he recovered the situation. He made amends for that lapse in concentration with two quite superb saves in the second half.\n\nLimerick had the bulk of possession after the break and it must be stressed that Izzi's 82nd minute match-winner came somewhat against the run of play. Early in the second half Paddy Doyle again had a shot cleared off the line by the impressive Willie Byrne at left-back before Sean Francis had a chip held by Eddie Hickey at the other end.\n\nOn the hour, O'Shea saved brilliantly with his feet after Howie King played in Doyle again and in Limerick's next attack the young 'keeper who dabbled in Belgian football with Mouscron produced the save of the night to deny classy centre-half Derek Whyte. Skipper Albert Finnan's free kick into the box was met in the air by Whyte and his powerful header looked to be heading for the opposite top corner only for O'Shea to launch himself full-length and flip the ball away at the last second.\n\nIn hindsight, they were two crucial saves and it was a point not lost on manager John O'Rourke.\n\n\"Alan O'Shea was brilliant for us in goal tonight. He has done ever so well since he came into the team when Ian Bennis was suspended but it's great for us to have two excellent young goalkeepers like that vying for the No.1 spot,\" said O'Rourke.\n\nCOBH RAMBLERS: O'Shea; Kelly, Murphy (capt), Maher, Byrne; O'Connor, Dalton, Kenneally, Keane; Izzi, Francis.

Cobh Ramblers have defenders Packie Kelly and Pat Maher struggling to recover from back strain injuries, and midfielder Anthony Kenneally has a groin strain since the 1-0 victory over Limerick.\n\n\"I have a few options at the back, but my assistant manager, Philip Long, who played in the 4-0 victory over Athlone Town is on standby, with Dave O'Connor another candidate for the job,\" commented O'Rourke.\n\n\"We will go with a 4-4-2 formation again, and I will be looking for us to score a few goals tonight,\" he said.\n\n\"Up to the Limerick game last week, goals were not a problem for us, but we left it late against Limerick and had to rely on Tony Izzi's strike eight minutes from the end to win the game,\" he added.\n\n\"I think we inflicted a first defeat of the season on Galway when we played them down in Cobh in what was one of our best performances of the season.\n\n\"They had been doing well in the League Cup as well at the time,\" he said.\n\n\"The first 15 to 20 minutes will be vital tonight until we get to the pitch of the game, but I am fairly confident that we can win it,\" he added.\n\nGalway suffered a 4-2 away defeat at Kilkenny City last week and manager O'Riordan read the riot act to his players afterwards. Galway have three players from Barbados on their books but one of them Â— Ryan Lucas Â— is ruled out of tonight's match as is recent signing from St Pat's, Ricky O'Flaherty, who has a groin strain.\n\nDavid Goldbey, who is just turned 18 and came on as a substitute for Lucas last week will stay in the team with another youth star, Ian Rossiter who was in Scotland with Brian Kerr's U-16 title-winning team in the spring.\n\nEric Levine, also from Barbados, will partner Goldbey up front with his fellow-countryman Luther Watson playing on the left-wing.\n\nDec 05 1998\n\nDraw throws up intriguing first-round ties\n\nby Noel Spillane\n\nTHE drama and excitement of the last night's Harp Lager FAI Cup draw certainly lived up to expectations when it threw up some intriguing first-round ties at the draw ceremony, which was televised live for the first time in the history of the competition from the Guinness Reception Centre.\n\nFAI Cup holders Cork City will open the defence of their title away to Monaghan United at Gortakeegan; last year's beaten finalists Shelbourne meet Shamrock Rovers in an all-Dublin derby, which is the tie of the round, while there is also a first-round repeat of that marvellous 1990 FAI Cup final between Bray Wanderers and then non-league St Francis.\n\nCobh Ramblers were favoured with a home draw against either Tallaght Town or Garda, while Cork's northside non-league sides St Mary's and Rockmount were both favoured with home ties, as well, against Bangor Celtic and University College, Dublin.\n\n...\n\nCobh Ramblers manager John O'Rourke said that he was happy with a home draw after the Ramblers were the first of the 33 clubs drawn from the draw drum.\n\n\"We were looking for a home draw and we got what we wanted. It's against a non-league team and they will be raising their game, but I would expect us to come through okay. We will take nothing for granted, but it's a game where we have nothing to gain and everything to lose so we have to be careful on the night,\" he added. \"It could be a tight game, but if we go about it in a professional way I would expect us to get into the next round okay,\" he added.\n\nDec 07 1998\n\nRambers go to top after classy show\n\nCobh Ramblers 3\n\nMonaghan United 0\n\nby Conor George\n\nCOBH RAMBLERS surged to the head of the First Division with as complete a performance as has been seen at St Colman's Park in recent years when they contemptuously brushed aside the challenge of Billy Bagster's Monaghan United.\n\nCobh knocked three goals past Monaghan without reply and the only complaint manager John O'Rourke can have is that they did not at least double that tally, such was their total dominance of the proceedings.\n\nCobh reduced Monaghan to mere spectators for the opening exchanges as their commitment to attack took Monaghan by storm and the border club simply had no answer to the ferocity of the Cobh side. Sean Francis, Paul Coughlan, Anthony Kenneally and Coughlan again all had chances that they should have converted and as the frustration of the bench grew so did the confidence of Monaghan who could only have been surprised that they were on level terms after 30 minutes.\n\n\"We could have turned over three or four goals up at the interval and it wouldn't have flattered us because we really were dominating and Monaghan were getting no break from our attacks but thankfully we did put away some chances in the end,\" said O'Rourke.\n\nCobh finally forced the breakthrough after 36 minutes, but even then they had to rely on a mistake from Monaghan's goalkeeper Eddie Van Boxtel.\n\nVan Boxtel tried to find his winger Colin Natoro with a quick kick-out but Paul Coughlan read the situation perfectly and raced onto the pass to head into the path of Francis whose initial cross was cleared but only as far as Keith Dalton and the midfielder made no mistake with his blistering drive.\n\nCobh continued to apply the pressure on the resumption but again their inconsistency in front of goal continued to frustrate them and then with match referee Damien Hancock making matters worse with some very dubious decisions Cobh were in danger of losing the run of themselves.\n\nThey soon got back on track however, and increased their lead with a second goal from Dalton. Francis once again supplied the ammunition when he lifted a delightful ball over the defence for Dalton to run onto and the hugely influential midfielder made no mistake with his volley that Van Boxtel could only palm into his own net.\n\nCobh finally killed off the contest in the 84th minute when a Willie Byrne cross was headed into the ground and ultimately the net by Anthony Kenneally but not before goalkeeper Alan O'Shea had the crowd gasping in disbelief with two spectacular saves from Carl Wilson.\n\nCOBH RAMBLERS: O'Shea, Kelly, Byrne, Murphy, Maher, Dalton, Kenneally, Keane, Izzi, Francis, Coughlan.

That didn't happen for us tonight and we have paid a heavy price by allowing Drogheda to close the gap on us.\n\n\"It really is heartbreaking because to pass up a chance to go five points clear at the top is unbelievable. The bottom line is that we should be winning our home games and we slipped up tonight. We have to hold our hands up and accept that,\" the Cobh manager said.\n\nBy virtue of the win Drogheda have leap-frogged Longford Town to take up second place in the division, just one point behind Ramblers, and for Martin Lawlor the season is going perfectly to plan even if there is still a way to go.\n\n\"I have always said the season is a marathon and given the tight nature of this league nothing can be taken for granted. To come away from St. Colman's Park with three points is a huge bonus for us and helps us to stay in contention.\n\n\"We have been showing excellent form away from home of late. We went to Longford when they were leading the league and beat them and we have done the same to Cobh here tonight. We have a very young side and this will be a great confidence booster.\n\n\"We have started to re-build at United Park with a young side by design. It took them a while at the start of the season to get used to playing professional football with the crowds and everything they have gelled together nicely at this stage,\" said Lawlor.\n\nCobh looked set to continue their good run when Keith Dalton netted his third goal in two games after just ten minutes but two second half goals from David Nugent cost them dearly as Drogheda took over the running. Dalton took a great ball from Paul Coughlan at the edge of the area before pivoting onto his right leg and planting the ball past Drogheda's goalkeeper Garreth Byrne. Cobh continued to put the pressure on for the remainder of the half and created a number of chances but failed to add to their tally.\n\nDrogheda took up the running on the resumption and were back on level terms after just 45 seconds when Greg O'Dowd turned the Cobh defence inside out. His shot was partially palmed away by Alan O'Shea, but Nugent was on hand with the easiest of tap-ins.\n\nAfter this shock Cobh upped the pace but for all their running they could not break down a marvellously disciplined Drogheda defence and were caught on the hop in the final minute when Willie Byrne was dispossessed and the visitors raced up the field where Nugent on hand to score the winner.\n\nCOBH RAMBLERS: O'Shea, Kelly, Byrne, Murphy, Maher, Dalton, Kenneally, Keane, Izzi, Francis, Coughlan.\n\nDROGHEDA UNITED: Byrne, Murphy, Boyle, Impey, Beggs, O'Keeffe, Coleman, Cox, Nugent, O'Dowd, Thornton.

Then seconds after referee Dave McKeon had blown the half-time whistle, the power went again and the second-half was delayed another 40 minutes. The game did not finish until a 10.45pm on Saturday night.\n\nDespite all that, the game was highly entertaining, even though it was played in freezing conditions. The fact that three players were sent off in the closing minutes might give the impression that this was a rough affair but nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nBoth sides played fast, open and attacking football but the frosty conditions resulted in some unfortunate clashes.\n\nCobh opened the scoring after 12 minutes when Keith Dalton's long cross from the right was missed by central defenders Ross McNally and Ciaran Delaney and when Paul Coughlan collected a dropping ball at the far upright the Cobh winger wasted no time in hammering it home past goalkeeper DeCourcey.\n\nSt. Francis were back on terms eight minutes later when Willie Byrne was adjudged to have tumbled Jason Ledwidge in the penalty area and Francis Sheridan converted the resultant spotkick.\n\nTracey had kicked a Coughlan header off the goal line and Izzi was unlucky to have a goal disallowed for the previous infringement by colleague Kenneally before the visitors regained the league in the 37th minute when Coughlan's tremendous inswinging corner from the left went off the legs of Sean Francis into the net.\n\nHowever, within a further three minutes St. Francis were back on terms again when Sheridan's close free was unfortunately headed into his own net by the Cobh midfield player Anthony Kenneally.\n\nWithin five minutes of the restart came an extraordinary miss when Coughlan broke clear down the left and drawing goalkeeper DeCourcey and defender Sheridan and McNally out of position. He slipped the ball through to the unmarked Izzi no more than five yards out from goal but amazingly the Cobh striker shot wide of the empty net.\n\nCobh dominated the second-half but Francis, Coughlan, Maher and Izzi all missed reasonably good chances of regaining the lead for the visitors. Then, with 12 minutes to go, Kenneally was sent off for a second bookable offence and the Cobh team were reduced to nine just two minutes later when central defender Pat Maher got his marching orders for his second booking.\n\nSt. Francis lost their central defender Ross McNally with only five minutes left to play when he was caught making a rash and dangerous attack on the Cobh goalkeeper Alan O'Shea.\n\nST.

We let it slip and it cost us dearly.\"\n\n\"It's got to stop and we will have to work hard to turn things around if we are to have any designs on winning promotion at the end of the season,\" said O'Rourke on a day when Cobh gifted a draw to the visitors.\n\n\"We looked to be home and dry at 2-0 up at half-time but I told the players that that is probably the hardest of all leads to try and hold onto in a football match.\"\n\n\"I think the lads felt the job was Oxo at the break and we relaxed far too much for the second half. We were too casual and I think that is reflected in the result,\" added the Cobh boss who had some strong words for his players afterwards.\n\n\"We had a few words okay back in the dressingroom and I told them a few home truths but I think they were all as disappointed as me and Philip Long, my assistant here, with the outcome,\" he added.\n\nOn a day of high winds and rain Cobh got on top early on and two goals in three minutes had them well in control or so they thought coming up to half-time.\n\nFull-back Willie Byrne's 27th minute cross on the overlap spun up off the surface inside the six-yard box and rebounded off No. 2 Eddie Walsh into his own net to give the home team the lead. Then three minutes later Paul Coughlan's good approach play fed Byrne on the overlap again and his pin-point cross had SeÃ¡n Francis stooping low to head home at the far post.\n\nCobh might have had a third but Francis drove a right-footed chance just wide before Cobh 'keeper Alan O'Shea denied full-back Tom McGauley with a diving save just before the interval.\n\nHome Farm/Everton were back in the game just ten minutes into the second half when Robert Farrell scored with a tap-in after O'Shea had parried Gavin Moore's initial drive. Farrell was close to an equaliser when he headed Ian Fitzpatrick's cross just over after 74 minutes, but Cobh were stunned when late substitute PÃ¡draig Drew scored a last minute equaliser.\n\n\"It's been some few weeks for young PÃ¡draig Drew. He was turned down by Everton cross-channel recently but then he was called into Brian Kerr's U-18 squad and now he's grabbed a last-ditch equaliser for us here in Cobh,\" said Liam Brien.\n\n\"We showed Cobh a little too much respect because we went with an extra defender and the man to lose out was PÃ¡draig. He's a very exciting player and even though he was rejected by Everton recently, I still think he will fulfil his ambition and get to play cross-channel football yet,\" added Brien.\n\nCOBH RAMBLERS: O'Shea; Kelly, Maher, Murphy (capt), Byrne; Dalton, Keane, Kenneally, Coughlan; Izzi, Francis.\n\nHOME FARM/EVERTON: Whelan; Walsh, Gleeson, England, McGauley; Fitzpatrick, Flanagan, Mooney, Byrne (capt); Farrell, Moore.

On a heavy pitch Cobh started well and were in front after seven minutes.\n\nBut by half-time they were behind and despite a whole hearted effort never looked like saving the match. The visitors were all action in the early stages and they deservedly took the lead in the 7th minute.\n\nPat Keane crossed from the left and Keith Dalton was given an ocean of space from which to pick his spot before shooting to the net. This infused new life into Kilkenny. After 20 minutes they drew level. A vicious 20 yards free kick by Trevor Vaughan was saved by Keeper Alan O'Shea and the ball was knocked away for a corner. However, this kick on the right by Paul Cashin ended with the ball going straight into the net.\n\nRight on half-time Kilkenny took the lead. This time, Trevor Vaughan sent in a stinging low shot and when the keeper failed to hold the ball Ray Carolan bundled it home. While Cobh Ramblers were full of enterprise afterwards they created very few chances. Anthony Kenneally missed with a fine effort on the hour.\n\nKilkenny finished strongly and after winning three corners kicked in succession they eventually punished an error in the Cobh defence. In attempting a back pass John Murphy left the ball short and reserve Jerry Goodwin pounced immediately and finished with aplomb from 16 yards on the right.\n\nKILKENNY CITY; Connelly; D Walsh, Carolan, Breen; R Walsh, Devereaux, Cashen, Kelly; Hale, Reddy, Rea.

That wasn't a reflection of the game, we were camped in their half for most of the game, but couldn't put it in the net.\"\n\nCobh are doing so well in the race for promotion that one suspects their real ambitions rest in the League competition but a run in the Cup would not necessarily harm them.\n\n\"It is a good break from the League for us,\" said manager O'Rourke.\n\n\"We have dropped our standard a little bit in the last three or four games and it is good we can turn to the Cup in the hope of getting back to our winning ways.\"\n\nThe pace of Tony Izzi and Sean Francis will trouble Garda but Cobh, above all others, will know of the dangers of under-estimating a non-league team.\n\nPHILIP LONG yesterday sounded a note of caution for FAI Cup favourites Cork City ahead of Sunday's visit to lowly Monaghan United at Gortakegan.\n\nLong, who won a Cup medal last season with Cork before switching to Cobh Ramblers as assistant manager, said; \"I expect Cork to win the Cup again but they will under-estimate Monaghan at their peril.\"\n\nLong won a League Championship medal also in the course of a long and successful career with Cork and his position with Cobh Ramblers leaves him ideally placed to compare both teams.\n\n\"There is no doubt Cork have players with the class to win the major trophies,\" he said.\"They have what I regard as the strongest panel of players in the country.\n\n\"But while I expect them to do the damage in Monaghan, there is never any point in messing about with the Cup Â— if you don't get it right on the day you're out; it's really as simple as that.\"\n\nJan 9 1999\n\nMellerick hoping for double celebration with Wanderers\n\nby Conor George\n\n[snip]\n\nMellerick himself is well used to the big match scenario after a playing career that saw him spend seven years with Cork Celtic, two with Waterford and the remainder of his career with his home club Cobh Ramblers as both player and manager.\n\nDuring his spell with Ramblers one of his most noteworthy achievements was captaining the then Munster Senior League side to the FAI Cup semi-finals in 1983, when they played Sligo Rovers in a four-game epic before eventually bowing out 1-0 in the third replay.\n\nAs a manager he guided the fortunes of Rockmount for a season before taking over at Ramblers for a four-year spell. During that period he guided them to premier division status before moving to Cobh Wanderers last season.\n\n[snip]\n\nJan 11 1999\n\nAdded-time blunder by O'Connor foils Cobh\n\nCobh Ramblers 2\n\nGarda 2\n\nby Noel Spillane\n\nYOUNG Liam O'Connor might well have some recurring nightmares about his added-time miss, but the fact of the matter is that a performance of some substance and steel from non-league Garda nearly producecd one of the shocks of this Harp Lager-sponsored FAI Cup weekend at St Colman's Park.\n\nThe little Cobh winger, just back in the side after injury, missed a sitter two minutes into added-time when the ball caught up under his feet inside the six-yard box after Tony Izzi had picked him out with a terrific diagonal ball.\n\nThat wasted opportunity forced a mid-week replay at Garda's Westmanstown's sports complex at Clonsilla in Dublin and happened just minutes after ex-Brighton trialist Dave O'Brien had equalised at 2-2 for the Leinster Senior League side with just three minutes of normal time to go.\n\n\"Okay, the match had all the excitement, drama and passion of a Cup tie, but it was a depressing result for us given that we were supposed to be the home team, up against non-league opposition and expected to win,\" blasted Cobh boss John O'Rourke afterwards.\n\nIt will be a backs-to-the-wall exercise for the Ramblers in Wednesday's replay, for cente-half Pat Maher and midfield ace Anthony Kenneally, who scored one of the goals on Saturday night, are both suspended.\n\nAnd to compound the situation for the travelling Ramblers, young midfielder Keith Dalton, who missed the first clash with a combination of 'flu and gastro-enteritis, is highly unlikely to recover in time for the return match which has a 1.45 p.m. kick-off.\n\nGarda, who are mid-table in the Leinster SL and in the quarter-finals of the FAI Intermediate Cup at home to Workmans-Dunleary next month, stunned the home team and their hardy supporters by taking the lead after just 11 minutes.\n\nCobh struggled to clear a short corner and when Dave O'Brien's cross landed on the edge of the box there was big central defender Darren Coogan to volley the ball across goalkeeper Alan O'Shea and into the far corner of the net. Cobh could have been 2-0 down minutes later when SeÃ¡n Mulhall's chipped effort grazed the crossbar.\n\nAnthony Kenneally saved Cobh's blushes when he equalised in the 44th minute as he rounded goalkeeper Vincent Daly before shooting low to the net after Tommy Bulter's incisive pass had opened up Garda's defensive ranks.\n\nCobh grabbed a rather fortunate 2-1 lead after 57 minutes when Tony Izzi scored his first goal since November with a tap-in after goalkeeper Daly spilled Willie Byrne's free kick at the striker's feet and virtually on the goal-line.\n\nRamblers were stunned once again when Garda made it 2-2 through returned exile Dave O'Brien with just three minutes to go. \"I suppose Cobh shaded it on chances created but overall a draw was a reasonable result. We probably got out of jail in added-time, but we have a replay to look forward to now and we will give it our best shot again,\" said Garda manager Gus Keating.\n\n\"I think we really shook Cobh and they will respect us even more for that come Wednesday. We will have a big crowd behind us and I think the soccer neutrals in and around Dublin will come out to support us too,\" added Keating.\n\nCOBH RAMBLERS: O'Shea, Kelly, Murphy (capt), Maher, Byrne, Keane, Butler, Kenneally, L.

Dublin yesterday. Three first-half goals in a magical five-minute spell crushed the Cup minnows.\n\nCobh now head for the Sligo Showgrounds early next month to rekindle memories of their 1983 FAI Cup semi-final epic with Sligo Rovers in the second round.\n\n\"I am delighted to be back among the goals again because I had hit something of a goals drought in the last few weeks,\" said Izzi.\n\n\"I think the third goal gave me the most satisfaction because that gave me the hat-trick and the match ball.\n\n\"It was good to score so many because I had not scored since November,\" added a mud-splattered Izzi, whose league and Cup tally now stands at 16 for the season.\n\nUnder the watchful eye of Garda Commissioner, Mr. Pat Byrne, the mid-table Leinster Senior League team looked out of their depth from the start.\n\nCobh were far more assured and direct in their approach. Their neat, crisp passing game stretched the Garda side's defensive resilience to the maximum.\n\nIt was one-way traffic from the start on an overcast afternoon and after Sean Francis had twice cracked the ball off the outside of the same upright and wide in the 15th and 18th minutes, the omens were not good for the 'boys in blue'.\n\nFull-back Willie Byrne forced goalkeeper Vinny Daly to a fine diving save from a free kick as early as the 10th minute. The only thing that baffled the few pockets of watching fans on the sidelines was how long it took the Ramblers to break the deadlock. Daly also saved well from a Sean Francis drive at the end of a mazy run and then mid-way through, Izzi only just failed to connect with a Francis cross right in front of goal.\n\nThe breakthrough came after 33 minutes when Paul Coughlan's exquisite ball split the home defence and after Izzi cut inside Darren Coogan's tackle on the edge of the box and switched the ball to his left foot, he scored with a low drive into the corner of the net.\n\nCobh went on a bit of a goal-scoring spree then, making it 2-0 two minutes later when Izzi tapped the ball home. Tommy Cregoe's shot was blocked by Daly but the ball spun away from him for Izzi to gleefully pounce on the loose ball.\n\nLiam O'Connor, the young man who might have won the first match in Cobh had he produced a better finish deep in added time, scored direct from a 38th minute corner to give Cobh the cushion of a three-goal half-time lead.\n\nThe Garda team put the pressure on at the start of the second half. They were rewarded with a consolation goal when Darren Coogan scored a controversial goal after 78 minutes. Liam O'Connor back on the goal-line cleared Coogan's drive off the line but the linesman on the near side signalled to the referee Hubert Byrne that the ball had crossed the goal-line and the 'goal' stood.\n\nHowever, O'Connor was adamant afterwards that the ball never crossed the goal-line. Cobh were spurred back to life by that disputed goal and they scored three more goals in the closing four minutes. Izzi completed his hat-trick making it 4-1 after 86 minutes. Sean Francis cracked home a fifth goal inside a minute.\n\nThen it was that man Izzi who bagged his fourth goal of the afternoon to give Cobh one of their biggest ever away victories in the FAI Cup.\n\nGARDA: Daly; O'Hanlon (capt), Coogan, McElroy; Cooney, Schutte, Dempsey, S.

The ex-College Corinthians star, in his first season with Cobh, was celebrating his first League of Ireland goal after he fired the home team into a 2-0 lead ten minutes from the end to seal the Ramblers' latest victory.\n\nCobh left it late with their two goals coming in the last 15 minutes but they now join Drogheda United and Galway United in a three-way tie at the top of the promotion race with all three clubs on 39 points though Drogheda do have games in hand.\n\n\"I felt we left it late okay but we deserved to win tonight,\"\" said Cobh boss John O'Rourke.\n\n\"At least, we prevented them from chalking up a hat-trick of wins over us and I was well pleased with that,\" added O'Rourke, whose side face Limerick at Rathbane on Friday night (7.30) before they go into their Harp Lager FAI Cup second round tie away to Sligo Rovers early next month.\n\n\"It was something of a novelty for us to score from set-pieces because we are not known for that and both goals were similar in their execution on the night,\"\" said O'Rourke from his sick bed yesterday. The action was watched by Irish U-21 boss Ian Evans and while Willie Byrne, Liam O'Connor and Keith Dalton were the only Cobh players to fall into that age category, he was adamant that he had no agenda in Cobh.\n\nTony Izzi, who hit four goals against the Garda in the Cup volleyed over early on and Paul Coughlan just failed to connect with a great Liam O'Connor cross as Cobh, inspired by a revitalised Pat Keane in midfield, carried the game to the visitors.\n\nSean Francis headed over the bar from in front of goal from Willie Byrne's 25th minute corner and the only real surprise over the half-time cuppa was the fact that Cobh were held scoreless.\n\nPat Maher and Pat Keane picked up bookings in quick succession on the restart and mid-way through it took a tremendous ball-winning challenge from Willie Byrne on Enda Kenny to prevent Longford taking a shock lead.\n\nCobh persisted with their Route One approach as they continually pumped high balls into the box but with two of the smallest strikers in the league in Izzi and Francis it made life very easy for Longford's fresh-faced defenders and they lapped it up.\n\nThe breakthough goal came after 76 minutes when Paul Coughlan spun over a free kick from the left. Anthony Kenneally, back in the side after missing the Cup tie because of suspension, met it well but goalkeeper Stephen O'Brien parried the ball on to the crossbar and out.\n\nBut there was the goal-poacher himself Izzi to gleefully smack the loose ball home. It was his 13th league goal of the season and his 17th overall.\n\nTen minutes from the end Pat Maher's moment of glory arrived when he fired the ball high into the roof of the net in a crowded goalmouth to seal Cobh's win and ease them back into a shared leadership of the First Division.\n\nCobh had to survive two other anxious moments when goalkeeper Alan O'Shea and Liam O'Connor combined to keep the visitors out in the dying minutes.\n\n\"I wasn't happy with the way we played at all tonight. We defended poorly for both goals and we have gone off the boil a bit in the last few weeks,\" said Longford's Stephen Kenny, whose side set the early pace in the promotion race.\n\nCOBH RAMBLERS: O'Shea; Kelly, Murphy (capt), Maher, Byrne; O'Connor, Keane, Kenneally, Coughlan; Izzi, Francis.

Jason Lynch, Declan Foley, Michael Deasy, Brian Walsh and Alan Falvey hit the target to give Rockmount their 5-3 victory. Cobh's successful penalty takers were Keith Dalton, Tommy Butler and team skipper John Murphy.\n\nThe sides were level at 3-3 in the shoot out before Cobh slipped up and missed their fourth kick.

Butler picked out Liam O'Connor on the right wing and when his inch-perfect cross was fired home by Coughlan, the visitors' felt they had won the match. But play was whistled up by the referee as Cobh's Tony Izzi lay injured on the pitch and the 'goal' was ruled out.\n\n\"It was a little controversial okay to have it ruled out. It was a quickly taken free kick and that's something that I try to encourage in the team. I know it was one of our own players that was down but we were penalised on our own free kick and, perhaps, the referee could have\n\nallowed the advantage,\" said Cobh boss John O'Rourke.\n\nThe Cobh boss worked as a ball-boy back in 1983 when Sligo took Cobh to four games before they finally won through to the decider where they beat Bohemians by 2-1 at Dalymount Park.\n\n\"The sad thing for us is that the ball ended up in the back of the net and was a perfectly legitimate goal but we suffered for taking a quick free kick. It's hard to say what the outcome might have been if we'd scored then and led 2-1 with less than 15 minutes to go,\" he added.\n\nThere was little to choose between the teams even though Cobh had to absorb the bulk of the second half pressure after they grabbed a sensational lead through Sean Francis just 19 minutes into the game.\n\n\"It's very upsetting for the lads because they know they were not outplayed, they were not played off the park tonight and we should have had a replay, at least, out of this one,\" he added. Goals from Dutchman John Hoeks and Glen Shannon clinched Sligo's place in the last eight.\n\nIt was Hoeks' first goal in four games since he arrived in Sligo on a free transfer from Belgium but one that earned him an extended loan spell at the Showgrounds.\n\nCobh missed the midfield influence of the suspended Pat Keane and experienced centre-half Pat Maher was ruled out by injury on a night when Sligo's Mark Hutchinson won the Harp Lager sponsored man-of-the-match award.\n\nSligo's Nicky Reid was convinced the game would go to a replay before he made the vital match-winning changes in the last quarter.\n\n\"The last thing we wanted was to have to go all the way back down to Cork and Cobh in the middle of the week and I think I will have to stand young Glen Shannon a drink or two tonight.\"\n\nReid continued: \"It was a sweet strike from Glen Shannon and one that was worthy of winning the game. He has been out injured for some time but what a comeback he's made now.\"\n\nSLIGO ROVERS: Brujos; McLynn, Sheridan, Charles, Lynch; Hutchinson, Ogden, Reid, Rowlands; Hoeks, Oates. Subs.
