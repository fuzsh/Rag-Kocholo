        "text": "Cahill said: “Although I feel I still have something to offer, I’ve reached a stage in my life where there are other priorities. My wife and I have recently had our first child and spending more time with them has to come first.\n\n“The wages in the league now are so low that it would be difficult to justify playing when I could be at home. Also, I have been lucky enough to have been working with the PFAI for the last three years and want to concentrate on my job there.” PFAI general secretary Stephen McGuinness said: “While we will miss Ollie patrolling the left wing on Friday nights, it’s fantastic for us to have a player of his stature concentrating full-time on the PFAI. He has first-hand knowledge of some the problems this league has endured over the years so this experience will stand him in good stead.”"
