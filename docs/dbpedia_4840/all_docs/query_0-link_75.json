        "text": "Valley Lodge\n\nNew York City power pop band Valley Lodge are back, rising like a phoenix or some other bird\n\nthat bursts into flames for no apparent reason, with their fifth album Shadows in Paradise.\n\nFans of hot rock and just people in general perhaps know the band best for their song “Go” aka\n\nthe theme song for Last Week Tonight with John Oliver on HBO but that’s, like, not even their\n\nbest song (even though it’s amazing) and the Valley Land’s new album is further evidence of\n\nthat.\n\n“That’s, like, not even our best song,” the band’s singer, guitar player, and semi-pro BMX rider\n\nDave Hill concurs. “You totally have to hear this new album, which is called Shadows in\n\nParadise, mentioned earlier.”\n\nValley Lodge recorded Shadows in Paradise with producer Tom Beaujour (Nada Surf, Aeon\n\nStation, Juliana Hatfield) at Beaujour’s Nuthouse Recording even though it’s all the way in\n\nUnion City, New Jersey and Dave and his fellow band mates drummer Rob Pfeiffer, who used to\n\nbe in Sense Field and also once appeared in a J. Crew catalog, and bassist Eddie Eyeball, who\n\nis also a member of the legendary 2 Skinnee J’s despite never having modeled professionally,\n\nall agreed they would never take the PATH train again.\n\nIt took some doing, but thanks to Beaujour’s guidance and some light snacks, the band\n\neventually emerged with an eleven-song album that sounds kind like a seventies AM radio\n\nmixtape pressed to vinyl and played in some kid’s basement in London 1969 that just so\n\nhappens to be across the street from a Ratt concert parking lot in 1985 that some new wave\n\nkids accidentally showed up to because of drugs. Or something like that.\n\n“I played it for my friend Greg and he said it’s our best album,” Rob said via a text message to\n\nDave. “For real.”\n\nAnd you can bet your ass Greg, whoever he is, is totally right. From the epic riffs of the album\n\nopener “Daylights” all the way to the album’s seductive (yes, seductive) closer, “That Love,”\n\nwhich the band totally stands by even though Beaujour suggested the band put it last before\n\nquickly changing the subject, Shadows in Paradise is jam-packed with earworms that will play\n\nagain and again in your head to the point where you’ll honestly probably get kind of pissed off\n\nabout it. But then you’ll calm down and just put the album on again whether you are driving\n\ndown the road on a warm summer’s day in search of the man, hanging out in a Burger King\n\nparking lot even though you were just asked by the manager not to do that, or facing an invasive\n\nmedical procedure with a positive mental attitude.\n\nWhile Shadows in Paradise was recorded primarily as a trio, some friends dropped by as well,\n\nincluding Guided By Voices guitarist Doug Gillard, who added killer guitar and backup vocals to\n\na few tracks, and the legendary Columbus, Ohio musician Happy Chichester (Royal Crescent\n\nMob, Howlin’ Maggie, Twilight Singers) who played keyboards and sang his ass off on a couple\n\nsongs. And Lily Mastrodimos (Long Neck), opera diva Jennifer Valle aka La Sinistra (Witch\n\nTaint), and Sean Cahill (Next Great American Novelist) sang backup vocals so great that Dave\n\nhad to call his therapist during lunch.\n\nShadows in Paradise will be unleashed on an unsuspecting public (date TBD) by Tee Pee\n\nRecords. Both the label and Valley Lodge themselves look forward to the album becoming\n\nalbum of the year as far as they are concerned. There will also be extremely live live dates\n\nduring which Valley Lodge will play songs from Shadows from Paradise but then also songs\n\nfrom their first four albums. The after party is at your mom’s house. Burn.\n\nSocial Links"
