        "text": "Kevin M. Cahill, who managed to pack several careers into a single life as a leading expert on tropical diseases, a doctor to celebrities and politicians, a close adviser to Gov. Hugh L. Carey of New York and a savior to the ailing American Irish Historical Society, but who later faced allegations of sexual assault by two women, died on Wednesday at his home in Point Lookout, N.Y., on Long Island. He was 86.\n\nHis son Brendan said that the cause of death had not been determined, but that his father had been in failing health.\n\nA short, stocky man with big, bushy eyebrows and an accent that tilted between Gaelic brogue and Noo Yawkese, Dr. Cahill managed to become a globe-trotting humanitarian while keeping thick roots planted in New York’s Irish American community.\n\nAfter an early stint as a doctor in Cairo and India, where he worked alongside Mother Teresa, Dr. Cahill returned to New York, where he established one of the country’s first centers for tropical disease, at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was among the first doctors to call attention to the city’s emerging AIDS crisis, organizing a groundbreaking conference on the disease in 1983.\n\nHe spent the late 1970s commuting to Albany, where, as Governor Carey’s health policy expert, he moved mountains to reshape the state’s flailing medical bureaucracy, making a host of enemies but impressing even his detractors as a quick study and an effective political infighter.\n\nA top expert in humanitarian medicine who worked in 65 countries, Dr. Cahill established an amputee clinic in Somalia and directed earthquake relief in Nicaragua, experiences he discussed in 1993 on the NPR program “Fresh Air With Terry Gross.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
