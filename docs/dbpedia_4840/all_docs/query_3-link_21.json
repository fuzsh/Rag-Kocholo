        "text": "Deveire is not your typical tech company. Only 10-years-old, the IT solutions company has grown from a one-man operation into a company that employs more than 50 people and boasts many clients in the Fortune 500.\n\nAmong its oldest and most valuable clients is Toyota Ireland.\n\n“Toyota is an absolutely brilliant client. They’ve been very good to partner with and have been very receptive to moving technology forward and trying to get the best technology and solutions in place,” founder and CEO Ollie Cahill said.\n\n“We endeavor to understand what they’re thinking and then apply a solution based on our experiences. We walk in the shoes of our clients, and their users, to build a solution that may not necessarily be what they were asking for but what they needed, which can be an interesting journey at times,” Cahill added.\n\nTo ensure future growth, Deveire believes in forming trusted and enduring relationships with its clients and partners.\n\nDeveire is also the Premier EMEA partner of BrightSpot, a growing content business platform that enables customers ― no matter their business logic, workflows or content types ― to solve unique business challenges at scale with astonishing speed and without having to compromise."
