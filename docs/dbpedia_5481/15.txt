Bill <strong>Bichsel</strong> and Thomas Heavey Denny Flannigan and <strong>Father</strong> Bix The night of the Spring Banquet, GTPP Founder Thomas Heavey gave a moving and wonderfully candid speech regarding the selection of this told my colleagues on the committee that Bill <strong>Bichsel</strong> makes me uncomfortable [and] that is alright. As a priest, you have spent a lifetime comforting the afflicted. You have also spent a lifetime afflicting the comfortable, myself included. You challenge me, you uncomfortable. Thank you, <strong>Father</strong> Bix, we need to be challenged, we just plain right to honor [Fr. Bix] while he still lives, acts, and defies conventions that Snyder (right) wrote the piece especially for the awarding of the <strong>2012</strong> Greater Tacoma Peace Prize to <strong>Father</strong> Bix.
