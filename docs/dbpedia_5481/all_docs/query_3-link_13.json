        "text": "After spending the first 2 1/2 weeks of his prison sentence for the Disarm Now Plowshares action at the SeaTac Federal Correction Facility, Jesuit priest Bill “Bix” Bichsel was taken out of his cell on April 18. He is being transported several thousand miles across the U.S. to Tennessee, where he is scheduled to join 12 others for a May 9 trial stemming from their July 5, 2010 civil resistance action at the Y-12 nuclear weapons complex in Oak Ridge. (More about the action here.)\n\nBix’s health is fragile, and being transported by the Bureau of Prisons can make for a long and difficult journey, during which it is difficult to receive needed medications. Please keep him in your thoughts and prayers.\n\nApril 14, 2011\n\nDay 16 at SeaTac Federal Detention\n\nBy Bill Bichsel, S.J.\n\nI will pursue my hope to do some writing while in lock-up. I feel the\n\nspirit present with me in lock-up and feel confirmed by the spirit\n\nthat here is where I should be.\n\nAs I slowly shuffle around the common area, I thank God for being here\n\nand for the peace I experience. I am not anxious or overly concerned\n\nby anything, though I do feel some tugs to answer my letters and to\n\nget my calling and visitor lists into the computer.\n\nI have had generous help from different inmates such as: Reno, Bo,\n\nHugo, Ronnie, etc. to help me with the computer. They have been most\n\nobliging. The kindness and welcoming by the inmates – especially the\n\nMexican brothers and some of the Black brothers has been great. They\n\nmake sure that we have what is necessary. They give easily. Most of\n\nthe guys on this 6b inmate unit have heard of our Bangor action and\n\nare supportive. A very touching incident, that highlights our\n\ntreatment by the inmates, happened on our second day here when there\n\nwas a shake down. All the inmates had to file into the big, very cold,\n\nexercise room while the guards went through our cells looking for\n\ncontraband. While I was standing there shivering one of the Mexican\n\ninmates came up and put his jacket around my shoulders. I was touched\n\nby his compassion.\n\nI’m very lucky to have Steve Kelly, S.J. as my cell mate. Ordinarily,\n\nhe would go into the Special Housing Unit (the hole) upon entering\n\ninto BOP custody because of his non-cooperation with BOP regulations\n\nand restrictions; however, out of consideration for me, he has elected\n\nto stay in the general population with its regulations in order to be\n\na companion to me – as long as he can. He shares his humor,\n\nconsideration, helping hand, and patience with an 82 yr. old that has\n\nthings wrong with him from head to toe, moves slowly, tires easily,\n\nand takes a œ ton of pills to prolong breath and life. Steve has been\n\ngreat. We are somewhat the odd couple. Guess which one is neat and\n\norderly.\n\nI’m blessed by the peace and quiet spirit inside. I’m not concerned\n\nabout trying to be more than I am with the other inmates. I’m trying\n\nto let them see – and not hide or disguise – my lack of knowledge of\n\nso many things. I want to be as I have been formed by time and the\n\ncommunity of people about me at different stages and positions in my\n\nlife. Like I said: I’m lucky to be here.\n\nI know I’m getting weaker – it takes all my strength and breath to\n\nmake my bunk. I have to sit down a few times in the process. It takes\n\nall I have now to do one or two slow shuffles around the common area.\n\nI don’t feel panicked or upset about my condition. I know I can keel\n\nover at any time; but I feel very much at peace with this condition\n\nand understand and accept it – thankfully – as part of my journey.\n\nI don’t have a regular prayer time now – but pray and try to be alert,\n\ni.e. at rest in the presence of God. I ask God to lead me as God sees\n\nfit. There is no anxiousness or compulsiveness or resolve to preach or\n\nhold prayer sessions or do any “religious actions” – just be and\n\nshuffle around. There are four TVs I avoid with their steady diet of\n\nsex and violence.\n\nI am so thankful to feel at peace with my life. It’s a gift from God\n\nand I do feel God working in – with me. I could be wrong – but this is\n\nwhat I experience."
