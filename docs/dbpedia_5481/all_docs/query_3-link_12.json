        "text": "<strong>2012</strong> <strong>Award</strong> <strong>Presentation</strong> <strong>Honors</strong> <strong>Father</strong> <strong>William</strong> \"Bix\" <strong>Bichsel</strong>, S.J. JULY/AUGUST <strong>2012</strong> The Greater Tacoma Peace Prize is presented at the annual Spring Banquet in the Scandinavian Cultural Center on the campus of Pacific Lutheran University. Over 160 members of the Tacoma community attended the banquet on his eighties, has dedicated his life to the causes of peace and justice, even his selection as the GTPP laureate for <strong>2012</strong>. The concept of a local peace prize came from Thomas Heavey, Founding Chair of the GTPP and veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom. In 2005, upon from Sweden, and inspired by the Nobel Peace Prize, Tom and others created the Greater Tacoma Peace Prize to honor local community members who work for peace. The GTPP Committee meets throughout the year to receive and review nominations, raise funds, plan the Oslo trip for the laureate, and promote the cause of peace. For more information, visit their website: http://www.tacomapeaceprize.org/ Fr. Bill <strong>Bichsel</strong> and Thomas Heavey Denny Flannigan and <strong>Father</strong> Bix The night of the Spring Banquet, GTPP Founder Thomas Heavey gave a moving and wonderfully candid speech regarding the selection of this told my colleagues on the committee that Bill <strong>Bichsel</strong> makes me uncomfortable [and] that is alright. As a priest, you have spent a lifetime comforting the afflicted. You have also spent a lifetime afflicting the comfortable, myself included. You challenge me, you uncomfortable. Thank you, <strong>Father</strong> Bix, we need to be challenged, we just plain right to honor [Fr. Bix] while he still lives, acts, and defies conventions that Snyder (right) wrote the piece especially for the awarding of the <strong>2012</strong> Greater Tacoma Peace Prize to <strong>Father</strong> Bix. Attendees' comments were deservedly laudatory. http://eriksnyder.bandcamp.com/ to listen to this incredible composition. (Photo credits: Blake Kremer and Andreas Udbye) Erik Snyder"
