[The Eugene Register-Guard (Eugene, OR) December 5, 2001]\n\nDavis, Janice\n\nJanice Ann Davis was born Janice Annalea Meyer on April 18, 1931, near Echo, Yellow Medicine County, Minnesota, to parents Elmer Meyer and Elvira Hahn Meyer. She was the third child of this marriage, which included a brother, Elwood Clive, and a sister, Patricia Millicent. Before Jan's first birthday, her mother passed away. Jan was legally adopted by her father's sister, Burma Meyer Winkler and her husband, Eugene A. Winkler. The family resided in Watertown, South Dakota. Jan's brother and sister were legally adopted by her mother's sister and family. Jan rarely saw them while growing up.\n\nJan attended schools in Watertown and graduated from Watertown High School in 1949. She was actively involved in music (playing the violin, piano, and organ; singing in choirs; and, hosting a local radio music program) and journalism (editing the yearbook; and, composing poetry and creative writings for the school newspaper). She loved sipping Cokes at the local soda shop with her friends and participating in all aspects of Job's Daughters.\n\nAfter high school, Jan worked at Midland National Life Insurance where she perfected her shorthand and typing skills. She married Kenneth E. Nagelhout on April 8, 1951. Five daughters and one son born in fairly rapid succession kept her extremely busy with homemaking and child rearing. She did find time to entertain friends for weekly card parties. Ken was in the lumberyard business, so the family moved to towns in North Dakota and Minnesota until returning to Jan's beloved Watertown in 1962. Most churches in these towns needed an organist, and she gladly accepted their offers.\n\nIn 1965, the family left the Midwest and settled in Springfield, Oregon. She loved getting to know people, and her Avon route was a perfect fit at the time.\n\nKen and Jan divorced in 1972, so Jan returned to her secretarial background and worked as an executive secretary for several years. She further perfected her grammatical, proofing, and writing skills to become a top-notch employee. Her independent nature and people orientation proved impossible to contain, so Jan quit her 9-to-5 job and embarked on a successful wholesale grocery business for the next twenty years. For added enjoyment, or torture, she sought out the most difficult crossword puzzles and completed them in ink.\n\nIn 1979, Jan married Raymond C. Davis, but was widowed in 1993. She continued living in their Harlow Road condo until moving to Terpening Terrace Retirement Center in Eugene in 2007. She loved the socializing opportunities and new-found friendships at Terpening.\n\nJan's failing health and the recent death of her only son proved too much to overcome. She passed away peacefully with her daughters by her side in the early morning hours of November 15, 2011, at Good Samaritan Society in Eugene.\n\nJan was preceded in death by her biological and adoptive parents; brother and sister; daughter, Pamela Kae Nagelhout, on April 18, 1982; and, son, Kirby Dallas Nagelhout, on July 2, 2011. She is survived by four daughters: Vicki Lynn Young of Corvallis; Sheila Rae Phillips of Eugene; Kimberley Ann Nagelhout of Canby; and, Heather Lee Burton of Napa, California.

Most of Dr. Davis' childhood playmates were Indian children and he was a staunch friend of the red man up to the last.\n\nDr. Davis' mother, Catherine Davis, who has been referred to often as \"the Angel of Mercy of the Upper Willamette valley\" was a nurse and mid-wife and for many years was the only \"doctor\" in this section. Often she rode 15 or 20 miles during stormy nights to help suffering pioneers and often \"M. M.\" her son, was strapped to her back or to the saddle, Indian style, as she made these calls.\n\nLater in life, Dr. Davis studied medicine and became a practicing physician. He continued in this work, following the footsteps of his mother, for some 30 years, after which he retired and devoted his time to other business.\n\nOn Jan. 22, 1874, Dr. Davis was married to Mary Bushnell, daughter of Lane county pioneers who came here in '52 to settle in Irving.

Davis, pioneer physician, died at the family home, 880 Jefferson street, Eugene, at 3:15 a.m. Saturday.\n\nMary Pelina Bushnell was born Nov. 4, 1851, at Kirksville, Mo., the daughter of George Edwin Bushnell and Sarah Jamison Bushnell. She came with her parents to the west crossing the plains with covered wagon and mule teams in 1864 to California, and on to Lane county in 1866 where her father bought a farm near Irving.\n\nIt was in the early schools in Eugene that Miss Bushnell first met Marshall M. Davis, who later became her husband. Both attended for a time a private school taught by Mrs. W. H. Odell. Following her \"schooling,\" Mary Bushnell at the age of about 16 years began her teaching career, her first school being at the Green Door school house near Lorane. She taught several schools in the Bethel district of that day, and at Pleasant Grove school (now the Santa Clara vicinity). She also succeeded Dr. Davis as teacher of the Lone Pine school. Dr. Davis was the first teacher after this district was divided and organized. She also taught in the Eugene public schools. Darwin Bristow being one of her pupils still residing in Eugene.\n\nPioneer Marriage\n\nThe marriage of Mary Bushnell to Dr. Marshall M. Davis was an event of Jan. 22, 1874 at the old Bushnell farm near Irving, the ceremony being performed by Rev. Mr. Wooley, pastor of the Cumberland Presbyterian church of Eugene in the presence of the immediate relatives. They \"went to housekeepin\" in a residence located on Eighth avenue east in the block east of where the Osborn hotel now stands. Dr. Davis was at that time working in the Odell and Evans drug store of this city.\n\nThe romance was the culmination of three years of courtship, during which time Dr. Davis was \"reading medicine\" with Dr. Abraham Sharples, Eugene physician and surgeon, and with Dr. H. H. Ellsworth, M. D., and pharmacist, who at that time had a drug store in Eugene. He also studied with Dr. Carpenter of Salem. Both the young people taught several schools in the interval.\n\nDr. Davis is the son of Benjamin Davis and Catherine Sipyter Davis, who came to Oregon in 1847 with one of the first overland wagon trains of which almost the entire personnel located in the vicinity of Eugene and Lane county. They made the trip by the southern route through the Modoc country and the Rogue river vicinity into Oregon, coming from Plymouth, Ind.\n\nMrs. Davis, mother of Dr. Davis, was a nurse and midwife, and early gave her son a vision of the need for physicians in the new country. She went side-saddle with her small son Marshall tied to the saddle as she visited those who were ill, and, until her husband's death, never took a penny for her services.\n\nDr. Davis was born near Eugene Sept. 30, 1851; took work in the primary department of the old Columbia college, in which so many famous men of this vicinity received their early education. Columbia college was approached by a high board walk over the Amazon slough.\n\nEarly Eugene Life\n\nBoth Dr. and Mrs. Davis were factors in the early social and professional life of Eugene. They were two of a group of young people of more than half a century ago paired off and married, about 15 couples settling down and founding homes in this county. They were the last of these couples to continue their life together to the year 1930. One or the other partner of each of the other couples had passed away before that time.\n\nAmong couples who made the early life of those days and who were married within about two or three years of each other, were Dr. and Mrs. Davis, Mr. and Mrs. J. H. Evans, Mr. and Mrs. S. B. Eakin, Mr. and Mrs. R. M. Robinson, Mr. and Mrs. T. G. Hendricks, Mr. and Mrs. F. M. Wilkins, Mr. and Mrs. I. K. Peters, Mr. and Mrs. John T. Bushnell, Mr. and Mrs. George H. Thurston. They made the \"sociables\" of those earlier days gala affairs.\n\nDr. and Mrs. Davis observed their 56th wedding anniversary on Wednesday, Jan. 22, of this week. Mrs. Davis, who was in failing health, had looked forward to this anniversary, as an occasion when she might be brought down from her room on the second floor, but this could not be attempted. The day was similar in weather conditions to the wedding day 56 years before, when Dr. Davis, the happy bridegroom, had required two hours to drive from Eugene to the Bushnell farm near Irving over icy roads.\n\nActive Church Worker\n\nMrs. Davis was a member of the Cumberland Presbyterian church of Eugene in an early day. This church later united with the Presbyterian church, and became the Central Presbyterian church. Her church and home interests extended through her entire life-time.\n\nDr. and Mrs. Davis moved to what was then Benton county in 1881, residing in the coast district. The county, however, was divided and Newport and Yaquina became part of Lincoln county. In 1803 they moved to Corvallis, where they lived for 15 years, returning to Eugene in 1907 where they built their residence at 880 Jefferson street.\n\nReturning to Eugene, Mrs. Davis resumed her church work here. She had done considerable Sunday school work at Corvallis, and was for many years treasurer for the Presbyterial, women's group affiliated with Willamette Presbytery, a valley organization. She was also a member of the Eastern Star of Corvallis, of the Daughters of the Nile of Portland, and of the Daughters of the Nile club of Eugene. She was also for many years a member of the Fortnightly club of Eugene, resigning about a year ago when her health made it impossible for her to continue her club activities.\n\nMany of Family Survive\n\nMrs. Davis is survived by her husband, Dr. Marshall M. Davis; by two daughters, Mrs. Mabel D. Walker of Portland and Mrs. Pauline D. Steelquist of Eugene, and by one son, Floyd Bushnell Davis of Long Beach, Cal. One sister, Mrs. Samuel L.
