        "text": "This paper examines what peaceworkers identify as influences on their decisions to move from ideas to action, from “saying no to acting no” in the words of Jim Wallis. In what ways do these influences meld or conflict with the consciousness of a particular group, specifically that of the Catholic Worker movement? How do changes in the strength and cohesiveness of this collective consciousness impact personal motivation for remaining as resisters? This paper will shine the lens of the truism, “actions speak louder than words” on Catholic Worker oral histories to posit tentative conclusions about the reasons one group of war resisters remains or does not remain motivated to participate in nonviolent civil disobedience.\n\nABSTRACT What compels people of faith to move from the “saying no” of vigils and letters-to-the editor to the “acting no” of nonviolent civil disobedience in the cause of peace? Oral historian Rosalie G. Riegle, a nonviolent activist herself, decided to find out. She interviewed 173 war resisters who have said the strongest “no” possible by confronting US militarism and paying the cost with arrests, trials, and imprisonment In 2013 she published two books with their stories, Doing Time for Peace: Resistance, Family, and Community (Vanderbilt University Press) and Crossing the Line: Nonviolent Resisters Speak Out for Peace (Wipf and Stock.) In an illustrated presentation (Powerpoint available on request, for classroom use only), Dr. Riegle shares the lives of these nonviolent resisters from World War II to the present day, showing how family support and a firm faith in the power of nonviolence sustained them for decades of peacemaking. Many are Catholic Workers who, like her, received their inspiration from co-founder Dorothy Day. Others come from different faith traditions, but all have learned that community support gives them the courage to cross lines both actual and symbolic. The presentation will conclude by inviting the audience to ponder together the characteristics, necessity, and efficacy of nonviolence in social and political life.\n\nThis dissertation traces the high-risk, direct action tactic of “jail solidarity” utilized by the Global Justice Movement. This movement becomes another layer in the genealogy of social forces that have utilized such tactics: the anti-nuclear, civil rights, and IWW movements. The use of ethnography is appropriate for the study of high-risk activism so as to access concealed behavior not often included in social movement literature. Interviews and participant observation were utilized to capture the experiences of these arrested activists. Mass arrests at protests often violate first amendment protections, resulting in delayed processing, objectionable jail conditions, lengthy court proceedings, and ultimately, a mass dismissal of most inflated charges. The issues of political prisoners and prison conditions are contrasted against the privilege of activists while incarcerated. Radical law collectives have proven essential for social movements. They educate activists about their rights, provide legal support, and act as a liaison between the movement and the liberal legal community. These collectives can be understood as an example of a real-world challenge to the authority of law. The work of three law collectives is included within the ethnographic data. The power of solidarity (working synchronistically)—with the assistance of radical law collectives—provides compelling resistance. While the northern movements are overwhelmingly white, middle class and college educated, this presents a social barriers that inhibits connection with people of color, working classes, and movements of the global south that demands a remedy. This dissertation, therefore, attempts to provide a sociological analysis of direct action aspects that can provide lessons for future social movement activities."
