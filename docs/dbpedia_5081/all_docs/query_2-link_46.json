        "text": "Dorothea Nutzhorn was born in Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1895. Two incidents in her childhood shaped the ambitious yet sensitive woman she would become: At age seven she came down with polio and at twelve her parent’s marriage dissolved. Left with an awkward limp and unresolved anger toward her family, she was determined to move forward. A sense of adventure took her from New York to San Francisco in 1919, where she renamed herself Dorothea Lange (her mother’s maiden name) and used her newly-acquired skills in photography to set up a studio. While the Depression was a time of lost opportunity for most Americans, it was a time of enormous growth for Lange, who divorced her first husband, married again, and became part of a team of government photographers now celebrated for creating a moving visual document of a difficult era.\n\n\"Dorothea Lange\" Photo by Rondal Partridge. 1936, Library of Congress\n\nIn the 1930s, Lange worked for a government program that documented relief sent to farmers who had been hit hard by the collapse of the U.S. economy. Her images of desperately poor families told the stories of those who had been unfortunate. They also drew the sympathy and support of the American public. Her camera gave a voice to people who might have been forgotten. Lange used the lens as a tool to lead a “visual life”—to communicate the difficult beauty and power of what she witnessed.\n\nAs a young woman, Lange’s ability to work well with people led to her success as a portrait photographer. With time, her artistry and skill with the camera improved and her interest in social issues deepened. After the stock market crash of 1929, the country plunged into a deep economic slump known as the Great Depression. Severe drought in the 1930s ravaged millions of acres of farmland and brought on the Dust Bowl, prompting hundreds of thousands to flee the damaged prairie states for California, where they hoped for a better life.\n\nLange and her soon-to-be husband, economist Paul Taylor, began to document the plight of migrant farm workers who lived in squalor in California labor camps. Her work earned her a job with one of Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal programs—the Resettlement Administration (later renamed the Farm Security Administration)—in 1935. While touring the country on behalf of the agency, Lange came across a hungry and desperate mother and took several pictures of her, one of which would become known as Migrant Mother.\n\nDorothea Lange believed the camera was an instrument of democracy. She tried to be open-minded and approached her subjects with respect. She died in 1965 at the age of 70, but her personal philosophy continues to influence documentary photographers, and her extraordinary pictures allow Americans to see other Americans in a new light."
