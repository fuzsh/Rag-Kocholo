        "text": "Subscribe to KidScreen Daily & Attend the KidScreen Summit\n\nKidScreen Daily is a fantastic FREE trade magazine for the children’s media industry. Subscribing to KidScreen Daily gives you daily industry updates, which then helps you slowly understand the industry and the players within it. It’s great to also track what shows are being bought (and over time you’ll start to see trends!) By reading KidScreen Daily, you’ll start to get a feel of the different companies and see if there are any that align with your vision for your career in kids media. It’s also a great resource to see what companies have shows/apps/podcasts/initiatives that have been funded (which is always a nice time to reach out to those companies!)\n\nThe KidScreen Summit is arguably the best conference to attend to get a holistic understanding of the kids media industry (as there is a market and educational sessions). Attending is pricey, but is something to save for, or see if there could be a volunteer exchange/scholarship etc. Members of some of the associations listed below will receive offers for discounted rates, and if you’re based in Canada the Andra Scheffer Scholarship from the Youth Media Alliance is a great way to be able to attend.\n\n2. Join the Children’s Media Association and/or the Youth Media Alliance\n\nThe Children’s Media Association (CMA) is a wonderful organization dedicated to the enhancement of children’s media. It was founded by Livia Beasley who is one of the most supportive folks on the children’s media scene. It is well-worth the cost of a membership, and (like most associations) you get out of CMA what you put into it (for me, this has yielded some really wonderful personal relationships and great employment opportunities). It’s reasonable to ask your workplace if they could pay for the cost of the membership as professional development. If you volunteer the membership fee is less (and you get the additional benefit of getting to know your peers even more!) Here’s a video of how how it all started, and how it can help you!\n\nThe Youth Media Alliance (YMA) is run out of Canada and is an equally awesome organization. In addition to events (which they also have en Français!), they also put on a conference and perhaps the industry’s most fun awards show.\n\nI’m a member of both organizations, and there’s no requirement that you have to live in either country to be a member of either CMA or YMA. Both organizations usually provide discounts to the KidScreen summit and membership in organizations in countries you don’t reside in also gives you a perspective advantage in an industry that is growing ever more global in scope.\n\nA quick note, countries other than the US and Canada have THRIVING children’s media scenes and local organizations as well. If you’re elsewhere in the world, see if there’s a local organization that you can join!\n\n3. Subscribe to the Cynopsis Newsletter\n\nCynopsis bills itself as “media’s first morning read” and depending on what time zone you’re in, that could be true! Cynopsis gives you a 360 of the media industry before you even get out of bed and covers the kids industry in a fair way (which is rare when you look at the percentage of kids coverage in other industry trades). This newsletter is great to get an understanding of any big trends happening and it also tracks premiere dates/finale dates of shows including kids shows on all networks and streamers.\n\n4. Attend a Prix Jeunesse Suitcase (and)/OR the Prix Jeunesse\n\nIt’s a French name, but it’s a festival that happens in Munich, Germany every two years. For a few days, the world of children’s media professionals and researchers comes together to watch the best children’s television shows and discuss them with colleagues. Unlike KidScreen, Prix Jeunesse is not a market (it’s an educational experience, you won’t find business folks trying to buy/sell shows). The festival is FREE, all you have to do is get yourself to Germany!\n\nThe Prix Jeunesse suitcase has been a life saver for those unable to travel (due to schedule or finances) who want the experience of watching shows with peers and discussing. The Prix Jeunesse suitcase has been all over the world, and the Children’s Media Association and Youth Media Alliance have hosted events with the Prix Jeunesse Suitcase.\n\n5. Join the Children and Media Professionals Facebook Group\n\nThis is the online group where all the children’s media professionals hang out and discuss everything. Job opportunities are posted here from time to time, and it’s another great place to learn names and get the lay of the land. It’s founded and run by the amazing David Kleeman. It’s also a place where researchers/academics and industry professionals will cross paths as well.\n\n6. Join Women in Animation and/or Women Drawn Together\n\nMuch of children’s media is animation based, so joining Women in Animation is a smart move (and no, you don’t need to be a woman to join). They have some great events and they also send out a very thorough email job listing which helps you see trends of jobs (who is hiring? what production is hiring? what jobs?) Seeing what jobs are in need is also helpful if you’re eyeing any courses/skills to brush up on to prime yourself as a surefire candidate.\n\nWomen Drawn Together is Toronto-based, and hosts local events along with an informative Facebook page with job postings and discussions.\n\n7. Read Books! Watch Docs! Creep The Internet!\n\nIt’s great to read books about kids media, and get an idea of the history of kids media- and there are lots. The book I recommend anyone looking to get into educational preschool media is Preschool Clues by Angela Santomero. Dade Hayes’ Anytime Playdate gives a great perspective into the research process that goes on in many preschool television series. Malcolm Gladwell’s The Tipping Point also has a chapter that goes into the research process in some preschool shows.\n\nStreet Gang by Michael Davis gives some lovely history into how Sesame Street was started (we bow down to the OG!). It’s also a documentary from HBO.\n\nOf course, it would be silly to write this section and not mention Won’t You Be My Neighbor — the Mr. Rogers documentary from Focus Features.\n\nNote that these are simply a starting place. There are more books, documentaries and podcasts on children’s media and education out there- take a look for yourself!\n\n8. Sign Up for the EdSurge Newsletter and follow EdTech!\n\nKids media isn’t JUST television — it’s a HUGE industry where anything can spark anything and the content willingly and easily jumps from medium to medium. Apps can become podcasts, which can become television shows. YouTube series can become toys. Books can become games — and so on!\n\nFollowing educational technology (EdTech!) is also super helpful when you’re interested in the world of children’s media- as this is children’s media! I really enjoy EdSurge, and hope their newsletter can help you scratch the surface of the world of EdTech — and understand who scored venture capital, what apps are gaining traction, what trends are happening, and so on.\n\n9. Consume Children’s Media!\n\nThis is SUCH an important step. You have to be constantly watching shows, playing games, reading books, and browsing toy stores to know what’s out there and how/why they’re doing it. You want to consume enough content so that when you develop an idea you can comp it to other shows/concepts out there, and/or utilize parts of those shows as proof/inspiration for your new idea.\n\nI also recommend that you watch enough to have a favorite show that is on the air/streaming, now. You don’t want to be on the receiving end of a, “so tell me your favorite kids show out there right now” simple question without that answer."
