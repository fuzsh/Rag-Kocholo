        "text": "Coraline Jones is bored in her new home until she finds a secret door that leads her into a world that’s just like her own...but better!\n\nBut when this fantastical adventure turns dangerous and her “Other” Mother tries to keep her forever, Coraline must count on her resourcefulness and bravery to get home.\n\nKubo mesmerizes the people in his village with his magical gift for spinning wild tales with origami.\n\nWhen he accidentally summons an evil spirit seeking vengeance, Kubo is forced to go on a quest to solve the mystery of his fallen samurai father and his mystical weaponry, as well as discover his own magical powers.\n\nNorman must use his ability to see and speak with the dead to save his town from a centuries-old curse.\n\nIn addition to spooky zombies, he’ll also have to take on mysterious ghosts, wily witches and, worst of all, clueless grown-ups. But this young ghoul whisperer will soon find his paranormal abilities pushed to their otherworldly limits.\n\nThe funny and gentle Mr. Link, the very last of his species, yearns for companionship and a place where he belongs.\n\nTo help find his rumored cousins in the fabled Valley of Shangri-La, he recruits Sir Lionel Frost, the “world’s greatest” sleuth of myths and monsters. Together with courageous adventurer Adelina Fortnight, they embark on a hilarious globe-trotting journey to find Mr. Link’s far-flung family.\n\nLAIKA’s next animated feature film is Wildwood, based on the bestselling novel written by Colin Meloy, lead singer and songwriter for The Decemberists, and illustrated by Carson Ellis.\n\nWildwood is a tale of love, loss, sacrifice and secrets, and of the magic you can find on your doorstep, if you’re willing to look for it."
