        "text": "Mother 3 is one of the most hotly-desired RPGs ever, having never received an official translation in North America despite the cult popularity of its predecessor, Earthbound. Rumors of an official localization persisted for years, with Nintendo even creating a parody video in which former Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime blows up a journalist asking about the release. But over all these years, series creator Shigesato Itoi has never weighed in on the discussion - at least until now.\n\nIn the brand-new documentary titled Earthbound, USA, Itoi finally opens up about the release of the long-desired sequel, saying he would \"love for people in the U.S. to play Mother 3.\"\n\n\"I've talked about it with Nintendo before. Apparently they were presented with the offer to use the translation, but they said it wasn't quite as simple as that. I think it'd be really interesting if they took up the offer. It'd be hard to make something like, say, an automobile with fans. But doing it with software, I believe there'd be a chance to make something that would be better than what the company could have made on their own.\"\n\n\"Usually, when I'm done with something, I'm done with it for good. You can't give up on projects you are in the middle of, but when you put an end to something, it's best to just leave it alone. The older you get, the more stories there are for you.\"\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nPut that way, it sounds like Itoi would genuinely like for there to be a Mother 3 localization, but is reluctant to return to work on the project himself, as he considers it a closed chapter in his life. Notably, his pinning the decision on Nintendo is consistent with other stories we've heard over the years. The game's producer, Shinichi Kameoka, told Nintendo Everything last year that he'd \"also love to see Mother 3 released in the U.S. and Europe\" and that he continues to wait for a worldwide English release. And former Nintendo president Reggie Fils-Aim√© said the decision not to localize it was \"based on the business needs and the business situation at the time\" when he was asked about it last year.\n\nKnowing that, it seems like the onus really is on Nintendo for this one. So feel free to keep holding up giant \"LOCALIZE MOTHER 3\" signs at every wrestling event. Maybe someday, they'll change their minds. But sad as it is for Mother fans that Itoi is seemingly done being involved, he seems so happy with himself as an artist that it's hard to argue with him.\n\n\"In some weird way, I feel like I've got kids,\" he says at the conclusion of the interview, referencing the game's passionate fan community. \"Like a godfather?\" Then, laughing as he leaves the room, Itoi adds, \"Please come to my funeral.\"\n\nRebekah Valentine is a Senior Reporter at IGN."
