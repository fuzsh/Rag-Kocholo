        "text": "Mother Nation was founded in 2013 by Norine Hill, with a mission to deliver social and cultural healing services for Native women that nurture, create stability, and inspire growth through sisterhood. A trauma survivor herself, Norine recognized that no Seattle-based organization at the time focused exclusively on the needs of Native women. Norine rallied the Elders in her community around a shared vision for Mother Nation, where the ultimate power of Native women is fully realized and underpins thriving tribal communities.\n\nToday Mother Nation is a Native American 501(c)(3) nonprofit that offers culturally informed healing services, advocacy, mentorship and homeless prevention in Washington State. We support Native and Indigenous women during times of transition from chronic homelessness and gender based violence to stable housing by providing counseling, connection to social services, sisterhood, community, and spiritual support.\n\nOur culturally informed healing services are designed and provided by credentialed Native American Elders who apply culture to clinical practice. We use traditional Native medicines including essential oils, prayer, stories, song, ceremony, art, kinship, humor, laughter, food, and earth-based teachings. By acknowledging the past and re-learning who we are as a Native people, Indigenous Sisters who participate in our programs transform their path to a journey of natural leadership and wisdom built on ancestral strength.\n\nOneida Nation of the Thames, Executive Director/Founder\n\nNorine Hill founded Native Women in Need in 2013 from a vision to support the success of Native Sisters by way of cultural prayer and Sisterhood during times of crisis.

The work Madeline has done academically, professionally, and in community is informed by the gendered impact of both Canada’s Indian Act and adoption policies, as well as the generosity of the urban Native communities in both Seattle and Portland, Oregon. Madeline is grateful to turn her passion of supporting culturally centered, Native health and wellbeing towards Mother Nation and to hopefully give back in a way that reciprocates all that has been given to her."
