        "text": "Gravitas Ventures has acquired North American rights to horror thriller “I’ll Play Mother,” with the Anthem Sports & Entertainment Company set to release the film in September.\n\nThe film, which was acquired from Concourse Media, stars Susanne Wuest (“Goodnight Mummy”), Jo Martin (“Doctor Who,” “Back to Life”) and Shubham Saraf (“A Suitable Boy”). Brad Watson (“The Siege”) directs from a screenplay by Libby Adam, based on an original story by Charles Edwards.\n\nA twisted psychological horror about the relentless and unending paranoia of parenthood, “I’ll Play Mother” follows two children who are placed into the care system after the death of their birth mother. At this point, they realize there is something sinister at play.\n\nThe film was produced by Ben Charles Edwards and Kirsty Bell for Dreamtown, commissioned by Goldfinch.\n\n“I’ll Play Mother” marks the first film from Dreamtown’s film slate, an auteur-driven genre production label focused on horror, thriller and sci-fi projects. The label was co-founded by award-winning producers and directors Edwards (“The Wheels of Heaven”), Phil McKenzie (“Quant”) and Kirsty Bell (“A Bird Flew In”).\n\n“We’re incredibly privileged to bring this film to audiences in North America,” said Mark Silba of Gravitas Ventures. “The filmmaker’s understanding of how to use visuals, audio, and narrative to conjure up both fear and drama makes Brad Watson one of the most exciting upcoming directors to watch, and ‘I’ll Play Mother’ one of the must-see horror films of the year.”\n\nThe deal was negotiated by Silba of Gravitas with Matthew Shreder of Concourse Media on behalf of the filmmakers."
