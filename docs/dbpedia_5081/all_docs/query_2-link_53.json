        "text": "And when the morning of the warning’s passed, the gassed\n\nAnd flaccid kids are flung across the stars\n\nThe psychodramas and the traumas gone\n\nThe songs are left unsung and hung upon the scars\n\nAnd does she want to see the stains, the dead remains of all the pains\n\nShe left the night before\n\nOr will their waking eyes reflect the lies, and make them\n\nRealize their urgent cry for sight no more\n\nWhen we met I was sure out to lunch\n\nNow my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch\n\n– Tandyn Almer, “Along Comes Mary”\n\nWhatever else Tandyn Almer did with the rest of his life[1], he’ll have forever authored one of the greatest bits of twisted sunshine pop and doobie entendre soft rock to harmonize and flute-solo its way onto Top 40 radio and prime time television.\n\nNow, it’s probably safe to say the inspiration for The Association’s 1966 toe-tapper was not the mother of Jesus Christ–and likely not even a woman at all. I think we can all assume that Mary’s middle name is Jane.\n\nBut the Mary–the O.G., blessed virgin, greatest-story-ever-told, gettin-it-done-in-a-manger Mary–indeed comes along all over the place, just about any ol’ time. Every front yard is Mary’s potential domain; any porch her possible perch. The city’s backyards are so full of clandestine, hidden Marys that we’ll never have a true accounting of them all. [You don’t know how that keeps a speculative journalist awake at night!] It’s enough to drive a Mary-curious atheist into confession.\n\nSo on this Mother’s Day, we return to an old favorite Orbit subject: Mary, the mother of all mothers, in some of her various occasions around town. Links to earlier coverage appear below.\n\nHappy Mother’s Day to all the mommas out there. While your kids won’t be able to take you out to lunch, may your empty cups taste as sweet as the punch.\n\nMary and friends\n\nPedestal Marys\n\nChristmas Marys\n\nEmpty Mary Grottos\n\nMore Orbit Mary coverage:\n\nThe Front Yard Marys of Bloomfield, Part I and Part II (June 26, 2016 and May 19, 2017)\n\nAlms Race: The Front Yard Marys of Beaver County (April 22, 2018)\n\nColor Me In Presston: The Front Yard Marys of McKees Rocks, Part 1 (Nov. 18, 2018)\n\nHail, Mary! Front Yard Mary Roundup (Nov. 27, 2016)"
