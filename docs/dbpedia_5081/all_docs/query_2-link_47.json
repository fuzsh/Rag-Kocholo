First payments were issued in March 2022. Control group participants were also notified in March and April 2022 and are participating in paid research surveys as part of the pilot.\n\nThis randomized control trial was launched earlier in February 2022 by the City of Birmingham in partnership with Mayors for a Guaranteed Income (MGI), a network of mayors advocating to give Americans an income floor. Through this program, 110 Birmingham residents are receiving $375 a month for a 12-month period via random drawing by a third party and with no strings attached.\n\nLearn More About the Pilot\n\nRead about the purpose behind the pilot here\n\nEarly data on the pilot’s impact can be found on this dashboard published by the Stanford Basic Income Lab, the Center for Guaranteed Income Research, and Mayors for a Guaranteed Income.\n\nLearn about the impact of the program on one are mother here.\n\nMom’s Night Out | Monday, January 30\n\nInfo for Applicants\n\nAll guaranteed income recipients have been selected, notified, and onboarded.

Mayor Randall L. Woodfin took the pledge to join MGI’s effort. The city received a $500,000 grant to execute the pilot. Additional funds from the City of Birmingham support the administration of the pilot.\n\nResearch on the pilot program will be conducted by MGI’s partner, Abt Associates.\n\nWhat is a guaranteed income?\n\nA guaranteed income is a monthly, no-strings-attached, cash payment given directly to individuals. It is unconditional, with no work requirements. The foundational idea behind a guaranteed income is that everyone should have enough money to meet their basic needs. A guaranteed income is intended to supplement, not replace, existing benefits.\n\nWho is eligible to participate in the Embrace Mothers pilot?\n\nThose eligible are be female-identifying heads of family caring for at least one child under the age of 18. Single-mother households represent about 60% of all City of Birmingham households with children.\n\nEmbrace Mothers is only be available to City of Birmingham residents.\n\nELIGIBLE\n\nSingle mother, cohabitating with a friend/family member who is also a single mother\n\nSingle mother living with their mother and siblings\n\nFoster mother with a child within their care during the application and onboarding period of the pilot\n\nSingle grandmother, aunt, cousins, or other female-identifying family member primarily caring for a relative’s child\n\nFriend who is primarily caring for a friend’s child (because the parent is in rehab, incarcerated, etc.)\n\nMothers or women who are in a mothering role whose partners are incarcerated\n\nWomen who are not yet legally separated from a marital spouse but who are living independently as sole provider for a child\n\nNOT ELIGIBLE\n\nMale identifying single parents\n\nMultiple family leads within one household environment\n\nSingle female caregivers with dependents 18 and older\n\nSingle female caregivers with dependents who live with another adult more than 50% of the time\n\nHow much money will be given?\n\nResidents selected to participate are receiving $375 a month for 12 months.\n\nHow many participants will be selected?\n\n110 people have been randomly selected by Abt Associates to receive a monthly guaranteed income payment.\n\nAn additional 132 control group participants were selected by Abt Associates. These individuals are not receiving a monthly guaranteed income payment, but are invited to complete surveys throughout the duration of the pilot to inform our understanding of the pilot’s impact. Control group participants are compensated by Abt Associates for survey completion.\n\nIs there an income requirement to participate?\n\nThere are no income or work requirements to participate.\n\nIs there a citizenship requirement to participate?\n\nNo. Proof of U.S. citizenship is not required. Participants must live within the Birmingham city limits.\n\nHow can I apply?\n\nThe application has now closed.\n\nHow are participants selected?\n\nAbt Associates maintains the pilot application and randomly selected participants. The city does not have authority over the selection process and will not be privy to individual applicant data and information.\n\nCan I participate in Embrace Mothers and still receive other public benefits?\n\nGuaranteed income payments are classified as a gift. Pilot participation may impact some, but not all, of participants’ public benefits. Prior to committing to participating, all recipients will be offered benefits counseling to decide if participation is best for their specific situation.\n\nWhen will I find out if I am selected, and when will I start receiving payments?\n\nAll guaranteed income recipients have been randomly selected by Abt Associates and notified and onboarded by East Lake Initiative. First payments have now been issued.\n\nIf you were not contacted and onboarded by East Lake Initiative, you were not selected as a guaranteed income recipient. You may still be selected as a control group participant. Abt Associates will reach out to individuals randomly selected for the control group over the next 30 days.\n\nGuaranteed income recipients will receive 12 monthly payments beginning in March 2022, through February 2023.\n\nIn what format will I receive my payments: cash, check, or debit card?\n\nThe Penny Foundation is administering the guaranteed income payments on behalf of the city, in partnership with MoCaFi. Guaranteed income recipients received a Mastercard-backed MoCaFi debit card that will be loaded with $375 per month for 12 months. The card can be used anywhere debit cards are accepted, including ATMs that accept Mastercard (fees may apply). No-fee ATM withdrawals will be available at all Wells Fargo ATMs and AllPoint Network ATMs (such as Dollar General, CVS, Rite Aid, 7 Eleven.)\n\nWill participants’ identities be publicly disclosed?\n\nThe program will not disclose the identities of the participants publicly.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions | Application\n\nI didn’t get a confirmation email or text. Did you receive my application?\n\nWhen you finished the application, you should have seen a submission confirmation screen. It included the following message: “Thank you for taking the survey! If you are randomized into the intervention group someone from East Lake Initiative will contact you with more information. If you are placed into the control group, please expect to hear from Kim Hannon at Embrace Mothers.”\n\nIf you provided an email address in the application, you should have received an email from MGIstudy@abtsurvey.com with the subject: Embrace Mothers pilot program – You have successfully submitted your application!\n\nIf you did not receive that email, please check your Spam folder. You will not receive a submission confirmation by text.\n\nI successfully submitted my application. What happens now?\n\nIndependent researchers at Abt Associates reviewed all the applications to make sure there were no duplicates and that entries meet Embrace Mothers eligibility criteria.\n\nThen Abt Associates randomly sorted the eligible applications into three different groups to make sure there is no bias in who is assigned to each group:\n\nGuaranteed income recipients: people who will receive the monthly guaranteed income and will be eligible to participate in surveys every 6 months so we can learn more about guaranteed income. They will be compensated with a $30 gift card for each survey that they complete. This group has been selected, notified, and onboarded.\n\nControl participants: people who are randomly assigned into the control group will not receive a guaranteed income through the program. They will be invited to complete a voluntary survey every 6 months for the duration of the program. They will be compensated with a $30 gift card for each survey that they complete. This group will be contacted over the next 30 days by Abt Associates.\n\nNon-participants: People who are randomly assigned into this group will not receive a guaranteed income through the program and will not be invited to participate in any further research activities.\n\nHow will I know if I’ve been chosen to participate?\n\nAll guaranteed income recipients have been selected, notified, and onboarded. First payments have been issued.\n\nIf you have been selected to participate in the control group, a member of the Abt Associates research team will contact you.\n\nI haven’t heard from anyone. Does this mean I haven’t been chosen?\n\nYou may still be notified to participate in the control group. We will update this website once all control group participants have been notified.\n\nIf you have not been contacted by the time the website says we have finished notifying participants, assume you have not been selected to participate.\n\nWhy won’t I get a notification if I am NOT selected?\n\nThe information you shared in the application can only be used for research purposes. This means Birmingham is not allowed to have access to the data for non-participants, so we can’t contact you if you haven’t been chosen to participate. Check the website to stay up to date on the notification process."
