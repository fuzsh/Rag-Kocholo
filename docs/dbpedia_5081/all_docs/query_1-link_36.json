        "text": "A post I made last year about the real life locations of the Hundred Acre Woods, Neverland and Agrabah has done exceptionally well, and I figured it only made sense to continue with other places in the world that you can visit that are based around Disney movies. This next one is undoubtedly the most accurate representation of a real life Disney location ever. If you’ve ever wanted to see that quaint house that traveled all the way to Paradise Falls with Carl and Russell, now you can: The Real Life Up House.\n\nThe Whitewood Cottage - Seattle\n\nThere are two ways of looking at this: the house Up was inspired by and the house that is an exact replica of Carl and Ellie’s home; they are not the same. Up was written by Pete Docter when he began to develop the idea for the story in 2004. 2 years later, Edith Macefield appeared in the news for her charming home, nestled between two commercial buildings owned by the Ballard Blocks in Seattle. She rejected a $1 million dollar offer from the developers to buy her land, and her home famously stayed put amongst the businesses from 1952 to the present day. The ownership of the home had been tossed around by a few people after she passed away at the age of 86, but for the most part it has remained a treasure to many.\n\nEdith called it the Whitewood Cottage, and it was originally built in 1900. It became associated with the movie Up after Disney/Pixar used it as a way to market their upcoming movie in 2009, and now people leave balloons in honor of Edith every year. Although Carl wasn’t directly based off of Edith and her story, they coincide greatly and are now forever linked.\n\nWhere you can visit the Whitewood Cottage: 1438 N.W. 46th St. in Seattle\n\nThe Colorful Up Home - Utah\n\nOur other option for visiting a home based around Up is on a corner of a street in Herriman, Utah. The Hamblin family live in their dream home as well as made the dreams of many Pixar fans come true. The house was originally built by Blair Bangerter for open house tours and for people to visit and it wasn’t listed for sale. But when Clint Hamblin went there to check it out one day while visiting his mother in Utah, he knew purchasing the home would be a great adventure. On his way home at the airport, straight ahead of him was Fenton’s creamery; there were too many signs to just ignore it.\n\nHis wife Lynette and their two kids Coral and Gunnar all felt personally connected to the film and eventually, Blair sold it to the family. Lynette and Clint had suffered miscarriages much like Carl and Ellie did, which made them feel connected even further. Their son Gunnar was diagnosed with autism at a young age, and he began opening up as soon as they moved into the home."
