        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: RLJE Films and Shudder have acquired worldwide rights to Little Bites, a new horror film from writer-director Spider One. The deal comes following their work with the filmmaker on his 2022 horror pic Allegoria.\n\nRLJE will release the film exclusively in theaters on October 4, with its streaming debut on Shudder to follow at a later date.\n\nLittle Bites follows Mindy (Krsy Fox), a young widow and mother, who desperately tries to protect her daughter Alice (Elizabeth Phoenix Caro) from the grips of a fiendish, flesh-eating monster named Agyar (Jon Sklaroff). Mindy has been secretly sacrificing her own life by allowing the creature to slowly feast on her body as she keeps Alice hidden away at her grandmother’s home.\n\nProduced by One and Fox’s OneFox Productions, the film also stars Chaz Bono (American Horror Story), Barbara Crampton (Jakob’s Wife), Heather Langenkamp (A Nightmare on Elm Street) and Bonnie Aarons (The Nun). Cher, Chaz Bono, Tyler Connolly, Ian Hoge, and Wendy Berry served as its executive producers.\n\nIn a statement to Deadline, One explained, “Little Bites began with an unflinching look at my own experience as a parent. An experience that has been and continues to be a complex mess of love, pain, success and failure. Where the best of intentions are constantly countered by the dark forces of self doubt and the external judgment of others.”\n\nOne shared that “in the film, Mindy’s relationship with her monster, Agyar, is clearly my allegory for parenthood. His bites are her pain. His words are her insecurities. His intentions are to prove Mindy’s failure as a parent. Krsy Fox and Jon Sklaroff delivered beyond my wildest expectations with their portrayals of Mindy and Agyar and I can’t wait to once again team up with Shudder/RLJE and let horror fans to sink their teeth into Little Bites.”\n\nAdded RLJE Films’ Chief Acquisitions Officer, Mark Ward, “We are thrilled to reteam with Spider One on this terrifying film. He continues to be a strong visionary talent and we can’t wait for audiences to see Little Bites in theaters this Fall.”\n\nThe deal was negotiated by Dan Rozenblum at 33rd and West on behalf of the filmmakers and Ward on behalf of RLJE and Shudder."
