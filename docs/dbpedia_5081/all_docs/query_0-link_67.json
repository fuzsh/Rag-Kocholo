        "text": "Fans are excited for the return of Only Murders in the Building later this month, following the favorite trio of amateur sleuths as they investigate, and podcast about, a new case. But when it comes to Hulu, the streaming service has a wide selection of titles that goes beyond its own originals. Disney Entertainment’s Onyx Collective series Reasonable Doubt, for example, returns for a second season this month, and it’s available to stream on Hulu. There are also compelling shows like BBC Two’s Line of Duty, which aired for six seasons, all of which are available to stream.\n\nWe have curated this list of the best shows on Hulu right now to help you cut through the noise and find the best options to suit your summer viewing needs. Light procedurals are perfect for the summer, but if you want something more intense, Hulu has plenty in that department, too.\n\nLooking for something else? We’ve also rounded up the best movies on Hulu, the best shows on Netflix, the best shows on Amazon Prime Video, and the best shows on Disney+.\n\nRecently added to Hulu\n\nSolar Opposites\n\ntv-ma 2020\n\nReasonable Doubt\n\ntv-ma 2022\n\nOnly Murders in the Building (2021)\n\n76%\n\n8.3/10\n\ntv-ma\n\n4 Seasons\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Crime, Mystery\n\nStars\n\nSteve Martin, Martin Short, Selena Gomez\n\nCreated by\n\nSteve Martin, John Robert Hoffman\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nWhat do you get when two you combine two comedic icons with a Disney Channel actor turned pop music star? Apparently, it’s a buddy-type comedy about three strangers. Steve Martin (who is also the co-creator of Only Murders in the Building), Martin Short, and Selena Gomez are all residents of an upscale New York building who come together because they share an obsessive passion for true crime. But when they find themselves actually involved in one, then two, and yet another, the situation gets increasingly hairy, and their sleuthing skills are put to the test.\n\nOut of the gate, the series was praised for the charming central characters, along with the “hilarious and insightful” story that takes a silly look at society’s obsession with this tragic genre. The show has had a long list of guest and supporting stars, including Tina Fey, Sting, Nathan Lane, Shirley MacLaine, and, for season 3, Meryl Streep and Paul Rudd. With season 4, the list gets even bigger as the investigation shifts to the mysterious death of Jane Lynch’s Sazz Pataki.\n\nSolar Opposites (2020)\n\n72%\n\n8.0/10\n\ntv-ma\n\n5 Seasons\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Animation, Sci-Fi & Fantasy\n\nCreated by\n\nJustin Roiland, Mike McMahan\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nFrom the creators of Rick and Morty, this Hulu original animated sitcom, which has a solid 92% aggregate critic rating on Rotten Tomatoes, sees four aliens crash-land into a suburban American town. While waiting for the right moment to take over Earth, they do their best to learn the ways of humans and live among them — but they each have their own perceptions about human behavior and what is awful versus awesome.\n\nWith an impressive voice cast, including both main and recurring characters, Solar Opposites has been a hit for Hulu. So it comes as a surprise that the series has already been renewed for a sixth season as well.\n\nSolar Opposites Season 3 | Official Trailer | Hulu\n\nReasonable Doubt (2022)\n\ntv-ma\n\n2 Seasons\n\nGenre\n\nDrama\n\nCreated by\n\nRaamla Mohamed\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nLooking for a good legal drama to sink your teeth into? Returning for a second season, Reasonable Doubt follows Jax Stewart (Emayatzy Corinealdi), a corporate defense lawyer who has a knack for handling high-profile cases. Her challenges go beyond her time in the courtroom, though, as she is dealing with a separation from her husband in her personal life while trying to juggle a demanding case load as well. Throwing another wrench into things, a former client named Damon Cooke (Michael Ealy) has been released from prison and is now working as a public defender on the other side of the law.\n\nCreated by Raamla Mohamed, who was a writer on Scandal, you can expect a similar tone and feel with Reasonable Doubt. The story is loosely based on the real life of celebrity attorney Shawn Holley, best known for being a member of O.J. Simpson’s legal defense team, who serves as a producer. Reasonable Doubt, which adds Morris Chestnut to the cast for season two, is one of those hidden gems on Hulu with rave reviews that you probably didn’t even know existed.\n\nLine of Duty (2012)\n\ntv-ma\n\n6 Seasons\n\nGenre\n\nCrime, Drama, Mystery\n\nStars\n\nMartin Compston, Vicky McClure, Adrian Dunbar\n\nCreated by\n\nJed Mercurio\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nPolice procedurals are a dime a dozen, but there’s a reason we love them so much. While they all have minor overarching stories, they’re the kind of shows you can throw on in the background, or watch after missing several episodes, and not feel lost. Line of Duty fits the bill, a BBC Two serial drama with six seasons under its belt. Each follows the Anti-Corruption Unit 12 (AC-12) within a fictional police force that is tasked with “policing the police.”\n\nEarning numerous award nominations through its run, Line of Duty has developed somewhat of a cult following. Fans love the fact that the series dives into an area of procedurals that isn’t already played out with one of the many other procedurals on the air today: sussing out corrupt cops working with organized crime. The interrogation segments, many of which can run for much of an episode, are considered one of the show’s strengths, building intensity at a level that isn’t usual in your garden variety procedural.\n\nMarvel's Hit-Monkey (2021)\n\ntv-ma\n\n2 Seasons\n\nGenre\n\nAnimation, Action & Adventure\n\nStars\n\nFred Tatasciore\n\nCreated by\n\nJosh Gordon, Will Speck\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nMarvel’s Hit-Monkey is an adult animated series based on the Marvel character of the same name. Hit-Monkey (Fred Tatasciore), an unjust and violent monkey, teams up with Bryce (Jason Sudeikis), the ghost of a former American assassin, to take down the criminal underworld in Tokyo. The pair later travel to New York City.\n\nAs unlikely pairing head out on various missions, their ultimate goal is to find and murder the employer of the assassins who killed Bryce. Inspired by Japanese animation, Hit-Monkey is both funny and extremely violent. There’s wonderful chemistry among the voice cast members, which also includes Olivia Munn, George Takei, Leslie Jones, and Cristin Milioti. A visual spectacle, Hit-Monkey is a must-watch for Marvel fans, both those who know the story and those who may not be familiar with it.\n\nFuturama (1999)\n\n74%\n\n8.4/10\n\ntv-14\n\n12 Seasons\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Animation, Drama, Action & Adventure\n\nStars\n\nBilly West, Katey Sagal, John DiMaggio, Tress MacNeille, Maurice LaMarche, Phil LaMarr, Lauren Tom, David Herman, Frank Welker\n\nCreated by\n\nMatt Groening\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nAlthough it didn’t attain immortality like its unending older brother The Simpsons (which now has the most scripted episodes of any prime-time series), Matt Groening’s other cartoon, Futurama, established an identity of its own as a funny, often poignant vision of the future. The show follows Philip J. Fry (Billy West), a delivery boy who stumbles into a cryogenic pod and wakes up a thousand years in the future. He ends up working for an interplanetary delivery company, working with a variety of colorful characters, including steely cyclops Leela (Katey Sagal) and hard-drinking, sociopathic robot Bender (John DiMaggio). Futurama is an inventive comedy, with every episode going in some wild directions, and it has an incredible cast of oddballs to bounce off each other.\n\nUnprisoned (2023)\n\ntv-ma\n\n2 Seasons\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nKerry Washington, Delroy Lindo, Marque Richardson\n\nCreated by\n\nTracy McMillan\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nKerry Washington is back on the small screen in Unprisoned, a comedy about Paige, a single mom and therapist who finds her already messy life thrown for a loop when her father is released from prison after serving a 17-year sentence. He moves in with her and her teenage son, and the new family of three must find a way to get along.\n\nWhile the show is a comedy, it also unpacks a lot of more dramatic topics like childhood trauma, forgiveness, grudges, and boundaries. Receiving high praise in early reviews, Unprisoned is dubbed a “snappy comedy” with heavy themes, with both lead actors, including Delroy Lindo as Paige’s father, Edwin, shining in their respective roles.\n\nThe Toys That Built America (2021)\n\ntv-g\n\n3 Seasons\n\nGenre\n\nDocumentary\n\nStars\n\nIan Karr\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nKids today still play with toys alongside their electronic devices. But back in the day, some of the most popular toys defined generations and kept kids entertained for hours, no screens needed. This History Channel docudrama walks you through the invention of some of the most iconic toys in the U.S. along with the challenges they faced coming to market and with competition. Timelines are re-enacted along with fascinating commentary by toy historians, business experts, and toy enthusiasts.\n\nThink everything from the simple Slinky to the early days of Mattel, Hasbro, and toys like Barbie and G.I. Joe. The show examines everything from board games made by massive companies like Milton Bradley and Parker Brothers to video games once screen time became a “thing,” action figures, the Rubik’s Cube, Jenga, and Lego. The third season, now streaming, features the history of Nintendo, ‘90s fad toys, and more. The Toys That Built America is an entertaining, not to mention educational, walk down memory lane.\n\nClipped (2024)\n\ntv-ma\n\n1 Season\n\nGenre\n\nDrama\n\nStars\n\nLaurence Fishburne, Ed O'Neill, Jacki Weaver\n\nCreated by\n\nGina Welch\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nThis sports drama based on the ESPN 30 for 30 podcast called The Sterling Affairs is a dramatization of the story of Donald Sterling, former owner of the L.A. Clippers, and his 2014 scandal. Sterling (Ed O’Neill) was caught on tape making racist remarks, and when the audio was leaked, it set off a series of events for the team. Laurence Fishburne plays Clippers coach Doc Rivers, Cleopatra Coleman plays V. Stiviano, Sterling’s assistant, and Jacki Weaver plays Shelly, Sterling’s wife and longtime business partner.\n\nAs a re-creation of the scandal, Clipped, which hails from FX on Hulu, is delivered in six episodes. FX describes the series as charting the “collision between a dysfunctional basketball organization and even less-functional marriage, and the precipitating tape’s impact on an ensemble of characters striving to win against the backdrop of the most cursed team in the league.” If you followed this scandal closely a decade ago and you’re a basketball fan (Clippers or otherwise), you’ll want to tune in.\n\nShardlake (2024)\n\ntv-14\n\n1 Season\n\nGenre\n\nDrama, Mystery\n\nStars\n\nArthur Hughes, Anthony Boyle, Sean Bean\n\nCreated by\n\nStephen Butchard, C. J. Sansom\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nFor lovers of period dramas, Shardlake will be right up your alley. The four-part series is based on the C.J. Sansom historical mystery novels. Set in the 16th Century during Henry VIII’s reign, Matthew Shardlake (Arthur Hughes) is hired by Thomas Cromwell (Sean Bean) to look into the death of a commissioner.\n\nDark, moody, and fitting for those who love shows like The Tudors, The Great, and Peaky Blinders, Shardlake has all the elements you’d expect from such a story, including deceit, politics, and murder. John Powers of NPR calls Shardlake “beautifully acted” and says the show surprisingly pulled him in.\n\nThe Bear (2022)\n\n85%\n\n8.5/10\n\ntv-ma\n\n3 Seasons\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nJeremy Allen White, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Ayo Edebiri\n\nCreated by\n\nChristopher Storer\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nWhen he left his job in the world of fine dining to take over his family’s small-town sandwich shop, Carmen (Jeremy Allen White) had no idea what he was in for. Not only is he dealing with the grief of family loss, he is also trying to navigate a professional world very different from the one he knows. That includes the challenges of running a small business, and doing so with a team of rough-around-the-edges employees who are initially none too pleased to have him bossing them around. Nonetheless, “Carmy” is determined to succeed professionally. But to do so means sacrifice, often at the expense of his personal growth and happiness.\n\nFrom FX, the comedy hails from Christopher Storer, the man behind successful shows like Ramy and Eighth Grade. The Bear has been a delightfully entertaining, deeply emotional watch with episodes that tug at the heartstrings. The series is mainly about Carmy’s journey to succeed, if he can get out of his own way, that is. But as the story progresses, it’s about the personal and professional development of all the people who work with him. As each one stops underestimating themselves, they find passion and drive they didn’t know they had, giving every character a moment to shine. The show is as inspiring and uplifting as it is frantic and emotionally draining at times, a delight for the senses in every way.\n\nShoresy (2022)\n\n8.5/10\n\ntv-ma\n\n3 Seasons\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nJared Keeso, Tasya Teles\n\nCreated by\n\nJared Keeso\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nIf you’re a fan of the Canadian comedy Letterkenny, you’ll love Shoresy. In Letterkenny, the character of Shoresy is never seen by face, and that’s for good reason: He is actually played by the show’s creator Jared Keeso, who also stars as the lead character, Wayne. In this spinoff, Shoresy is seen in all his glory. He has decided to move to Sudbury to help a flailing local hockey team, bringing his unique sense of small-town Canadian flare.\n\nApparently, Shoresy is one of the most popular characters from Letterkenny when it comes to merchandising, so fans were excited to learn more about his story in this comedy that is rife with Canadian slang and other familiar humor.\n\nUnder the Bridge (2024)\n\ntv-ma\n\n1 Season\n\nGenre\n\nDrama, Crime\n\nStars\n\nLily Gladstone, Vritika Gupta, Chloe Guidry\n\nCreated by\n\nQuinn Shephard\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nLooking for your next true-crime obsession? Under the Bridge tells the harrowing story of Reena Virk, a 14-year-old girl from Canada who was beaten and killed by a group of fellow teens in the late ’90s. The story made national headlines in the Great White North, shedding light on the extreme dangers of bullying, racism, and violence among young girls. Virk’s involvement in rebellious activities, minority status, strict religious upbringing, and surrounding of peers influenced by street gang culture, led to a childhood marred with challenges and incessant bullying that eventually grew to full-blown murder.\n\nUnder the Bridge dives into the tragic story in the form of a true-crime drama with Vritika Gupta playing Virk and counting Lily Gladstone (Killers of the Flower Moon), Archie Panjabi (The Good Wife), and Riley Keough (Daisy Jones & the Six) among its cast. Despite being a dramatization based on a horrifically true story, Under the Bridge has been praised for presenting the story in a sensitive way, focusing on the main theme of bringing attention to the seriousness of bullying and teenage violence and intolerance. The Chicago Sun Times’ Richard Roeper sums it up nicely in his review, noting that the show is a “sobering reminder this sort of thing still happens to this day, and far too often.”\n\nWe Were the Lucky Ones (2024)\n\n1 Season\n\nGenre\n\nDrama\n\nStars\n\nJoey King, Logan Lerman, Robin Weigert\n\nCreated by\n\nErica Lipez\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nA gripping historical drama miniseries, We Were the Lucky Ones is a dramatization of the Holocaust, with the central figures being the Kurcs, a family of Polish Jews. As Hitler’s reign of terror progresses, the family scatters, with some ending up in the U.S. and others in concentration camps. The series follows their journey after the war as the surviving family members try desperately to reunite with their loved ones.\n\nFrom a talented young cast led by Joey King and Logan Lerman to the emotional and heart-wrenching story inspired by real people, the series, which was released in late March 2024, is a poignant look at a dark time in history. Lacy Buagher Milas of Paste Magazine calls We Were the Lucky Ones a series “whose whole is so much greater than the sum of its parts.” She adds that the handling of themes like family, loyalty, love, trauma, and tragedy are “almost painfully prescient when compared to our current global moment.”\n\nExtraordinary (2023)\n\ntv-ma\n\n2 Seasons\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Action & Adventure\n\nStars\n\nMairéad Tyers, Sofia Oxenham, Bilal Hasna\n\nCreated by\n\nEmma Moran\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nWith two seasons under its belt, Extraordinary is one of those hidden gems on Hulu that won’t disappoint. Combining superhero comedy with a coming-of-age theme, it’s about Jen (Máiréad Tyers), a 25-year-old living in a world where everyone obtains some type of superpower once they turn 18. That is, everyone but Jen. She’s the only “regular” human, and it’s taking a toll on her. The series follows Jen’s journey as she tries somehow induce the powers she is supposed to possess while coming to terms with the fact that she needs to accept who she is before she can become who she can be.\n\nThe British series has been well reviewed, scoring a perfect 100% Rotten Tomatoes score for both of its seasons. The laughs are plenty, from Jen’s new cat, who she discovers is a shape-shifter (even her pet has powers!) to her ridiculous and desperate attempts to harness a power, any power. Extraordinary is a sharp, funny, and witty series about peer pressure to be like everyone else in a way you’ve never seen.\n\nAmerican Horror Story (2011)\n\ntv-ma\n\n12 Seasons\n\nGenre\n\nDrama, Mystery, Sci-Fi & Fantasy\n\nStars\n\nEmma Roberts, Matt Czuchry, Kim Kardashian\n\nCreated by\n\nRyan Murphy, Brad Falchuk\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nAmerican Horror Story is an anthology series, with each season centering on its own unique story, including a core cast with changing roles from season to season (along with some notable new additions from time to time). Each season provides scares and frightening psychological storylines, whether they take place within a troubled family home, amid a coven of witches, or inside a hotel of circus freaks.\n\nAmerican Horror Story is a unique drama that capitalizes on the work of series creator Ryan Murphy. While some seasons are better reviewed than others, the cast is always top-notch and the stories always thrilling, disturbing, and entertaining. The latest season, American Horror Story: Delicate, features Emma Roberts, Suicide Squad‘s Cara Delevingne, and Kim Kardashian.\n\nWelcome to Wrexham (2022)\n\n75%\n\n8.6/10\n\ntv-ma\n\n3 Seasons\n\nGenre\n\nDocumentary\n\nStars\n\nRyan Reynolds, Rob McElhenney\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nThis is about as close to a real-life Ted Lasso story as we might get. When actors Rob McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds decided to purchase a small-town Football Association of Wales club, the third-oldest in the world, they knew nothing about managing a sports team and arguably less about football. They also didn’t know one another very well at the time. But they saw an opportunity to revive a struggling club that was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic and a growing number of less-than-enthusiastic fans.\n\nYou can watch their process to turn the team around in this docuseries that highlights both the passion and camaraderie of these actors, who are determined to bring positive change and hope to a community. Welcome to Wrexham combines humor with heartwarming stories about a working-class town and two Hollywood comedic geniuses getting to know the game, the people, and the inner workings of a team in hopes of bringing home a victory.\n\nWelcome to Wrexham Official Trailer | Rob McElhenney, Ryan Reynolds | FX\n\nShōgun (2024)\n\ntv-ma\n\n1 Season\n\nGenre\n\nDrama, War & Politics\n\nStars\n\nHiroyuki Sanada, Cosmo Jarvis, Anna Sawai\n\nCreated by\n\nJustin Marks, Rachel Kondo\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nReceiving rave reviews right out of the gate, Shōgun is a spectacular reimagining of the 1980 TV miniseries and the James Clavell novel on which that was based. Three people end up in the same place by happenstance: John Blackthorne (Cosmo Jarvis), an English sailor, Lord Yoshii Toranaga (Hiroyuki Sanada), a powerful daimyo, and Lady Toda Mariko (Anna Sawai), a woman who has been dishonored by her family.\n\nWhile the story in Shōgun is largely fictional, it’s also loosely based on real historical events, with each character based on a real person. Blackthorne, for example, is based on English navigator Williams Adam, who became a samurai. He was taught by Tokugawa Ieyasu, on whom Toranaga is based, while Mariko is modeled after Hosokawa Garasha, an aristocrat from the Sengoku period. With a 100% Rotten Tomatoes critic score, Shōgun is poised to be one of the best new shows this year. CNN’s Brian Lowry calls it an “intoxicating combination of action, romance, and political intrigue.”\n\nFeud (2017)\n\n8.4/10\n\ntv-ma\n\n2 Seasons\n\nGenre\n\nDrama\n\nStars\n\nTom Hollander, Naomi Watts, Calista Flockhart\n\nCreated by\n\nRyan Murphy, Jaffe Cohen, Michael Zam\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nThe second season in the anthology series from Ryan Murphy, Feud: Capote vs. The Swans examines the true story of Truman Capote’s feud with New York City high society socialites.

The White Lotus’ Tom Hollander tackles the role of Capote.\n\nPercy Jackson and the Olympians (2023)\n\ntv-pg\n\n1 Season\n\nGenre\n\nAction & Adventure, Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Drama, Family\n\nStars\n\nWalker Scobell, Leah Sava Jeffries, Aryan Simhadri\n\nCreated by\n\nRick Riordan, Jonathan E. Steinberg\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nFans of Rick Riordan’s Percy Jackson book series especially have fallen in love with Percy Jackson and the Olympians, a fantasy series based on the stories that have been popular tween/teen (and even adult) reading since 2005. The title character, played by Walker Scobell, is a 12-year-old demigod, the son of Poseidon. The Greek god Zeus believes the young man has stolen his thunderbolt. Percy, with the help of his friends, goes on the hunt to find the missing thunderbolt. He hopes to restore order to Olympus, the palace where powers from all the gods and goddesses unite.\n\nWith Riordan himself heavily involved in the project as co-creator, the series has been praised for sticking with the source material. Some critics, in fact, say Percy Jackson and the Olympians is better than the film series, a testament to the acting, storytelling, and depiction of the fictional world. Though it’s technically a Disney+ series, Percy Jackson and the Olympians is also streaming on Hulu.\n\nMoving (2023)\n\ntv-ma\n\n1 Season\n\nGenre\n\nAction & Adventure, Mystery, Drama, Sci-Fi & Fantasy\n\nStars\n\nRyu Seung-ryong, Han Hyo-joo, Zo In-sung\n\nCreated by\n\nKang Full, Park In-je\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nA must-watch South Korean drama, Moving is finally coming to Hulu with a dubbed version for English-speaking audiences who can enjoy it without subtitles.

Critics call Moving a fascinating superhero series with character arcs for the parents that are just as compelling, if not more so, than that of the kids.\n\nCulprits (2023)\n\n1 Season\n\nGenre\n\nCrime, Drama\n\nStars\n\nNathan Stewart-Jarrett, Gemma Arterton, Eddie Izzard\n\nCreated by\n\nJ Blakeson\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nA high-stakes heist series, Culprits is about a crew that believes they have pulled off the perfect heist.

Trevor Wilson), as well as a pair of hockey players, Reilly (Dylan Playfair) and Jonesy (Andrew Herr). The show revolves around their lives and encounters with the other eccentrics in the town.\n\nIt’s a show deeply rooted in Canadian culture, with heavy use of slang. But even those unfamiliar with the vernacular will quickly come to appreciate the show’s deadpan wit. The show comes to an end after its 12th and final season.\n\nA Murder at the End of the World (2023)\n\n1 Season\n\nGenre\n\nMystery\n\nStars\n\nEmma Corrin, Brit Marling, Clive Owen\n\nCreated by\n\nBrit Marling, Zal Batmanglij\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nThanks to the success of movies like Glass Onion and shows like Poker Face and Based On a True Story, the murder-mystery genre is experiencing a revival of sorts. A Murder at the End of the World is in the same vein as Knives Out and the movies that inspired it, like Clue and Death on the Nile, in that it centers around an ensemble cast of characters invited to a location, only for one of them to wind up dead.\n\nThe Crown’s Emma Corrin stars as Darby, one of the guests invited to a reclusive billionaire’s estate. She also happens to be an amateur detective. When someone is found dead not long after joining the party, Darby takes it upon herself to use her skills and investigate and stop another murder from happening.

The TV adaptation features a rotating all-star cast that has included Billy Bob Thornton and Martin Freeman, not to mention Colin Hanks, Allison Tolman, and Chris Rock.\n\nEach season, which takes place in Minnesota North and South Dakota, and/or Missouri, stays true to the same black comedy and deadly mishaps that made the original film so popular. The fifth season adds Jon Hamm, Ted Lasso‘s Juno Temple, Stranger Things‘ Joe Keery, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Dave Foley to the cast list\n\nAsh vs Evil Dead (2015)\n\ntv-ma\n\n3 Seasons\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Action & Adventure, Sci-Fi & Fantasy\n\nStars\n\nBruce Campbell, Lucy Lawless, Ray Santiago\n\nCreated by\n\nSam Raimi\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nYou can watch the full series of Ash vs. Evil Dead, a sequel series to the popular Evil Dead movies created by Sam Raimi, including all three seasons before its untimely cancellation.

Jon Benjamin, Kristen Schaal, Eugene Mirman\n\nCreated by\n\nJim Dauterive, Loren Bouchard\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nAt first, Bob’s Burgers struggled to find traction in Fox’s animation block, failing to pull in the dedicated audiences of Family Guy and The Simpsons. Over the last more than a decade, however, the Belchers have emerged as an entity all their own, a family struggling to make ends meet, but never struggling to cheer each other up and have as good of a time as they can. The characters never age, but the sitcom only seems to get better with time, fixating on the fictional family and their burger joint.\n\nWith a feature film that celebrates the show’s success as well (note that the movie is no longer streaming), there’s no better time to start binging the Belcher family’s escapades.\n\nReservation Dogs (2021)\n\n83%\n\n8.1/10\n\ntv-ma\n\n3 Seasons\n\nGenre\n\nDrama, Comedy, Crime\n\nStars\n\nDevery Jacobs, D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Paulina Jewel Alexis\n\nCreated by\n\nTaika Waititi, Sterlin Harjo\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nWith a predominantly Native American cast and crew, Reservation Dogs provides a comedic glimpse into indigenous life. When four indigenous teenagers living on a reservation in rural Oklahoma set their sights on moving to a wonderful and exotic place they know as California, they are willing to do whatever it takes to get there. That means engaging in criminal activities to acquire the funds they need to leave. But when a rival gang shows up in town, the boys find themselves fighting crime as much as they are committing it.\n\nHaving premiered in early August 2021, the series, which ends after season 3, has received rave reviews. With an almost perfect 98% Certified Fresh RottenTomatoes rating, critics say it’s a “low-key comedy that deftly captures the malaise of youth and Rez life.”\n\nArcher (2009)\n\n79%\n\n8.6/10\n\ntv-ma\n\n14 Seasons\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Action & Adventure, Animation\n\nStars\n\nH. Jon Benjamin, Aisha Tyler, Jessica Walter\n\nCreated by\n\nAdam Reed\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nSterling Archer is an agent for a dysfunctional intelligence agency in this animated sitcom that takes inspiration from franchises like James Bond and mid-century comic art. Relying on reference-heavy humor and meta-comedy, Archer revolves around the narcissistic, womanizing secret agent Archer and his seven colleagues, each with their own quirks, like his snarky mother, delusional and psychotic personal assistant, and a morally bankrupt scientist.\n\nThe later seasons of Archer, which was originally created for basic cable network FX and then moved to sister network FXX, are designed like an anthology, with each season having its own self-contained story. Season 14 is the long-running show’s last.\n\nWhat We Do in the Shadows (2019)\n\n83%\n\n8.5/10\n\ntv-ma\n\n5 Seasons\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nKayvan Novak, Matt Berry, Natasia Demetriou\n\nCreated by\n\nJemaine Clement\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nThis isn’t your typical vampire drama — it’s actually a mockumentary comedy that presents the idea of vampires living among us, going about their mundane daily lives. At the heart of the story, which is based on the 2014 movie of the same name, are four vampires living as roommates.\n\nThe leader has a penchant for useless house meetings while another dabbles in pornography, and two others are having a “secret” affair. It’s full-on hilarity and perfect for anyone looking for an anti-vampire show that pokes fun at the typical tropes instead of playing into them. Critics call it “delightfully absurd” and “ridiculously fun.”\n\nWelcome to Chippendales (2022)\n\n70%\n\n7.1/10\n\ntv-ma\n\n1 Season\n\nGenre\n\nDrama, Crime, Comedy\n\nStars\n\nKumail Nanjiani, Murray Bartlett, Annaleigh Ashford\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nInspired by the K. Scot Macdonald and Patrick MontesDeOca book Deadly Dance: The Chippendales Murders, learn the backstory of Somen “Steve” Banerjee, the Indian businessman and entrepreneur who founded Chippendales. He was running a successful L.A. club, but once he added a male stripping dance troupe, it turned heads: This was something that hadn’t been seen before in America. Banerjee’s story from there, however, takes some dark and ominous turns, leading to murder. Kumail Nanjiani (Eternals, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Silicon Valley) tackles the lead role with vigor and commitment, bringing the mogul to life on screen.\n\nThe Handmaid's Tale (2017)\n\n81%\n\n8.4/10\n\ntv-ma\n\n5 Seasons\n\nGenre\n\nSci-Fi & Fantasy, Drama\n\nStars\n\nElisabeth Moss, Yvonne Strahovski, Joseph Fiennes\n\nCreated by\n\nBruce Miller\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nIn a not-too-distant future, after an environmental disaster causes widespread infertility, an extremist cult in the United States stages a coup, establishing the totalitarian state of Gilead. In this new society, women are relegated to subservient roles, and due to the low birth rate, a class of women called “handmaids” is conscripted to bear children for the leaders of Gilead. The protagonist of The Handmaid’s Tale, Offred (Elisabeth Moss), is one such woman, forced to have ritualized sex with Commander Fred Waterford (Joseph Fiennes) to provide him and his wife with a child. Living without any rights or power, Offred tries to survive each day, hoping to one day be free. The Handmaid’s Tale is a masterful adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s grim novel of the same name, with excellent performances and gorgeous, oft-disturbing scene composition.\n\nRamy (2019)\n\n85%\n\n8.0/10\n\ntv-ma\n\n3 Seasons\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Drama\n\nStars\n\nRamy Youssef, Mohammed Amer, Hiam Abbass, Dave Merheje, Amr Waked, May Calamawy, Laith Nakli\n\nCreated by\n\nRamy Youssef, Ari Katcher, Ryan Welch\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nThe streaming world is awash in introspective, character-driven comedies, and while Ramy’s format will feel familiar, it adds a new wrinkle. The eponymous character (played by comedian Ramy Youssef) isn’t just a millennial dealing with the awkward ups and downs of work and dating in the 21st century. He’s also a Muslim and trying to lead a moral life in amoral times. Ramy wades in ambiguities and its protagonist’s hypocrisies and hang-ups; for instance, he’s uncomfortable kissing a Muslim woman on their first date, but fine hooking up with non-Muslims, for which the former chews him out. It’s a show with a unique perspective and a willingness to present its characters in an unflattering light.\n\nAbbott Elementary (2021)\n\n80%\n\n4.6/10\n\ntv-pg\n\n2 Seasons\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nQuinta Brunson, Tyler James Williams, Janelle James\n\nCreated by\n\nQuinta Brunson\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nLauded for its relatability and honest look at the trials and tribulations of the public school system, Abbott Elementary is delivered in mockumentary style. The story begins with a documentary crew recording teachers working in underfunded schools. The sitcom’s creator, Quinta Brunson, also stars as Janine, a second-grade teacher navigating life with her colleagues, students, and the school’s tone-deaf principal. While every day is a challenge, the teachers simply want to do the best for their kids. But that’s easier said than done. Having picked up multiple Emmy wins for its sophomore season, Abbott Elementary is a must-watch for anyone with kids and especially for teachers who will be nodding their heads the whole way through.\n\nAtlanta (2016)\n\n93%\n\n8.6/10\n\ntv-ma\n\n4 Seasons\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Drama\n\nStars\n\nDonald Glover, Brian Tyree Henry, Lakeith Stanfield\n\nCreated by\n\nDonald Glover\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nDonald Glover is a modern Renaissance man: Since launching a comedy career via skits circulated on YouTube, he has branched into rapping, acting, and even showrunning, with the remarkable, surreal comedy-drama Atlanta. The show follows a dogged college dropout named Earn (Glover), who sleeps at his on/off-again girlfriend’s place and struggles to provide for their child. When he learns that his cousin Alfred is starting to achieve success as a rapper — stage name: Paper Boi — Earn becomes his manager. There is not much of an overarching plot to Atlanta. Most episodes play out like short films, and the show experiments with a variety of stories and formats — one standout episode is presented entirely as an episode of a local interview show, complete with fake commercials. Daring and frequently poignant, Atlanta is one of the most exciting shows on TV today.\n\nThe Americans (2013)\n\n89%\n\n8.4/10\n\ntv-ma\n\n6 Seasons\n\nGenre\n\nCrime, Drama\n\nStars\n\nKeri Russell, Matthew Rhys, Holly Taylor\n\nCreated by\n\nJoseph Weisberg\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nHailing from FX, The Americans originally aired for six seasons from 2013 to 2018. Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys star as Soviet KGB intelligence officers posing as American suburbanites, living with their two kids just outside of Washington. The spy drama was universally praised for its writing, characters, and acting. Set in the ‘80s, it covers stories surrounding the Ronald Reagan administration, examining issues from the perspectives of both the KGB and the FBI. Contributing to its sense of realism is the fact that the show was created by Joe Weisberg, a former CIA officer. Named by many critics as being among their favorite TV dramas of all time, it’s worth a watch, even years after the show concluded its run.\n\nLove, Victor (2020)\n\n69%\n\n8.1/10\n\ntv-14\n\n3 Seasons\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Drama\n\nStars\n\nMichael Cimino, Rachel Hilson, Anthony Turpel\n\nCreated by\n\nIsaac Aptaker, Elizabeth Berger\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nA refreshingly modern take on your typical coming-of-age teen drama, this series follows a young man named Victor as he navigates life in a new high school and embarks on a journey to self-discovery, including figuring out his sexuality. The series is set in the same world as the 2018 teen drama Love, Simon, which starred Nick Robinson as the title character. Robinson is now a producer and narrator, helping Victor through his struggles and providing guidance. The spinoff series, which ended after season 3, received an overwhelmingly positive reception, with the consensus being that it’s an easily digestible and entertaining watch.\n\nThe Orville (2017)\n\n36%\n\ntv-14\n\n3 Seasons\n\nGenre\n\nDrama, Comedy, Sci-Fi & Fantasy\n\nStars\n\nSeth MacFarlane, Adrianne Palicki, Penny Johnson\n\nCreated by\n\nSeth MacFarlane\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nWhile critics might not be as kind to Seth MacFarlane’s newest show, fans absolutely love it. With three seasons of the comedy-drama under its belt, the show takes a sci-fi-inspired look at life 400 years into the future. The crew aboard the U.S.S. Orville, an exploratory ship, sets out to see what’s going on in the universe and discover new things (and dangers) in outer space. But as they discover new life, they also have their own complicated lives and personal relationships to deal with. Expect typical Macfarlane humor, social commentary, and parodies that any fan of his other works will enjoy.\n\nThe Dropout (2022)\n\n74%\n\n8.4/10\n\ntv-ma\n\n1 Season\n\nGenre\n\nDrama\n\nStars\n\nAmanda Seyfried, Naveen Andrews, Utkarsh Ambudkar\n\nCreated by\n\nElizabeth Meriweather\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nIn 2003, entrepreneur Elizabeth Holmes founded the biotechnology company Theranos that promised to offer a revolutionary new method for blood testing. By 2015, she was was the richest self-made billionaire in America, but after the validity of her tech came under fire, it all fell apart, leading to her indictment and eventual conviction in January of this year for wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Based on the Rebecca Jarvis ABC Audio podcast of the same name, The Dropout stars Amanda Seyfried as Holmes and follows the story of how she and Theranos COO Ramesh Balwani (Naveen Andrews) misled and defrauded investors. If you’re curious about the story, The Dropout beautifully dramatizes events that Rolling Stone’s Alan Sepinwall says “would feel too absurd to be true if we didn’t already know otherwise.”\n\nPEN15 (2019)\n\n86%\n\n8.0/10\n\ntv-ma\n\n2 Seasons\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nMaya Erskine, Anna Konkle, Mutsuko Erskine\n\nCreated by\n\nMaya Erskine, Anna Konkle, Sam Zvibleman\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nThese days, coming-of-age stories are a dime a dozen, but few of them are as novel — or cringeworthy — as PEN15. Co-creators Maya Erskine and Anna Konkle star as 13-year-old versions of themselves, allowing the series to address topics and situations many would consider taboo if performed by younger lead actors. The two find their footing in hormone-fueled incidents involving masturbation and AOL Instant Messenger, not to mention everyday encounters with parents, principals, and the kind of insult-spewing preteens you can expect to find at any middle school. It’s all served with a heavy dose of ’90s-inspired nostalgia, meaning if the show’s no-holds-barred look at adolescence isn’t enough, perhaps the constant references to the Spice Girls will be. The final episodes of season 2, which will be the show’s last, are now streaming.\n\nIt's Always Sunny in Philadelphia (2005)\n\n71%\n\n8.8/10\n\ntv-ma\n\n15 Seasons\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Drama\n\nStars\n\nCharlie Day, Glenn Howerton, Rob McElhenney\n\nCreated by\n\nRob McElhenney\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nWhat South Park is to late-night animation, It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia is to sitcoms. Rob McElhenney, Glenn Howerton, and Charlie Day — who also created and write the show — star as three best friends who kind of hate each other, while Kaitlin Olson and Danny DeVito round out the cast as the infamous Dee and Frank. The group often finds itself in some of the most absurd situations as the members push into the uncharted and irreverent comedic territory for which the show is well known, usually as a result of their own botched schemes. The show is on its 15th season, though it has already been renewed through to season 18.\n\nIt’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia | Season 15: Official Trailer | FXX\n\nDopesick (2021)\n\n66%\n\n8.5/10\n\ntv-ma\n\n1 Season\n\nGenre\n\nDrama\n\nStars\n\nMichael Keaton, Peter Sarsgaard, Michael Stuhlbarg\n\nCreated by\n\nDanny Strong\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nWith a star-studded cast and a topical and controversial theme, it’s no surprise that this miniseries has turned heads. Based on the Beth Macy nonfiction book Dopesick: Dealers, Doctors and the Drug Company that Addicted America, the drama takes Big Pharma head on through its riveting and emotional eight episodes. The series explores the opioid crisis in America, looking at the situation from various angles, focusing its lens on the marketing of the drug OxyContin and Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family. From pain relief to addiction, regulators, drugs salespersons, and legal issues, it delves deep into the devastating effects of drug addiction in the country and the people and companies being held responsible in the court of public opinion.\n\nLegion (2017)\n\n82%\n\n8.2/10\n\ntv-ma\n\n3 Seasons\n\nGenre\n\nAction & Adventure, Sci-Fi & Fantasy\n\nStars\n\nDan Stevens, Rachel Keller, Aubrey Plaza\n\nCreated by\n\nNoah Hawley\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nNoah Hawley, the creator of FX’s Fargo, tries his hand at telling a superhero story with Legion, a visually dynamic series that isn’t your typical man-in-a-cape origin story. The show follows David Haller (Dan Stevens), a man who, having heard voices in his head since a young age, starts the series in a psychiatric hospital. His official diagnosis is schizophrenia, but after meeting another patient, Syd Barrett (Rachel Keller), who can switch bodies with anyone she touches, he discovers that the voices in his head are a sign of his own latent powers. Fitting for a show about a man who may or may not be insane, Legion is a hallucinogenic ride, with psychedelic visuals and format-breaking sequences that keep David — and the viewer — confused as to what is real.\n\nThe X-Files (1993)\n\n65%\n\n8.6/10\n\ntv-ma\n\n11 Seasons\n\nGenre\n\nSci-Fi & Fantasy, Mystery, Crime\n\nStars\n\nDavid Duchovny, Gillian Anderson, Mitch Pileggi\n\nCreated by\n\nChris Carter\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nChris Carter’s science fiction drama, The X-Files, operated under one simple premise: The truth is out there. FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) investigate unsolved mysteries called X-Files. These X-Files deal with paranormal activity, aliens, UFO sightings, and various phenomena. Mulder believes in the existence of alien life while Scully offers scientific explanations for the mysterious happenings, with their relationship serving as the show’s bedrock.\n\nSons of Anarchy (2008)\n\n68%\n\n8.5/10\n\ntv-ma\n\n7 Seasons\n\nGenre\n\nCrime, Drama, Thriller\n\nStars\n\nCharlie Hunnam, Katey Sagal, Tommy Flanagan\n\nCreated by\n\nKurt Sutter\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nA biker gang, the Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club Redwood Original (aka SAMCRO), makes ends meet by trafficking guns and subverting the law at every turn. However, when the gang’s young vice president Jax Teller (Charlie Hunnam) discovers the diary of his deceased father, he begins to question SAMCRO’s business decisions. This puts Jax at odds with his stepfather Clay Morrow (Ron Perlman), who presides as the club’s president. The series tells the story of Jax’s efforts to keep the club together while balancing his complicated family life.\n\nBroad City (2014)\n\n82%\n\n8.4/10\n\ntv-14\n\n5 Seasons\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Drama\n\nStars\n\nAbbi Jacobson, Ilana Glazer, Hannibal Buress\n\nCreated by\n\nIlana Glazer, Abbi Jacobson\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nIlana and her best friend Abbi are two 20-something women, living in New York. Abbi is a struggling artist, working at a fitness center while she attempts to get her career off the ground. Ilana, on the other hand, does everything in her power to avoid working, and instead pursues all manner of pleasurable distractions, including sexual escapades and consuming large amounts of marijuana. The two are often pulled into crazy situations, frequently as a consequence of one of Ilana’s ill-conceived plots. Broad City has received high praise from critics due to its clever writing and subtle-yet-effective message of female empowerment.\n\nCowboy Bebop (1998)\n\n8.9/10\n\ntv-14\n\n1 Season\n\nGenre\n\nAction, Adventure, Animation\n\nStars\n\nKoichi Yamadera, Unsho Ishizuka, Megumi Hayashibara\n\nCreated by\n\nHajime Yatate\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nAnime is often labeled as a niche genre, but like with all forms of media, there are breakout examples that transcend the genre, crossing over in appeal. Cowboy Bebop is a prime example. Set in the early era of humanity’s colonization of the solar system, a ragtag group of bounty hunters led by Spike Spiegel (Steven Blum) makes ends meet by taking in wanted criminals, while simultaneously trying to avoid the law and powerful criminal organizations. This space-western has been lauded as one of the best anime series ever made, with a memorable cast and compelling story, featuring one of the most iconic final scenes ever.\n\nCowboy Bebop (Original Series) - Official Funimation Trailer\n\nMovie images and data from:\n\nChristine has decades of experience in trade and consumer journalism.
