Between hula-hoop classes, lengths in the outdoor heated pool, sword-fighting tutorials and seminars on drawing the perfect goose, the workforce of about 1,000 employees who created Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo and Up is scrambling to restore Pixar’s status as the vanguard of computer animation technology and storytelling."
