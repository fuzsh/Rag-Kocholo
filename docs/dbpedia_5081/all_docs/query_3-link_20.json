        "text": "Mother’s Day is just around the corner, which means you’re probably scrambling to buy your mom a gift as a small token of your appreciation for all she’s done for you.\n\nHeld annually on the second Sunday in May, this holiday is often associated with bouquets and breakfast in bed, even expensive jewelry. But the modern motifs of a wholesome holiday are a relatively new concept. In fact, the creator of the holiday, Anna Jarvis, sought to abolish the holiday she created, initially established to be devoted to love and appreciation, since it turned into a capitalist frenzy. Arguably, today’s iteration of Mother’s Day is a shell of its original self, with specific promotions being offered as a way to make money for corporations.\n\nJarvis’s mission to found Mother’s Day stemmed from a desire to pay tribute to her late mother, Ann Reeves Jarvis.\n\n“Anna remembered, as a young girl, hearing her mother often repeat a simple prayer: ‘I hope and pray that someone, some time, will found a memorial mother’s day commemorating her for the matchless service she renders to humanity in every field of life. She is entitled to it.’ The holiday’s design was thus a tribute to Mrs. Jarvis,” says Katharine Antolini, Wesleyan assistant professor and author of the book Memorializing Motherhood: Anna Jarvis and the Struggle for Control of Mother’s Day.\n\nAnna decided the holiday should be celebrated on the second Sunday in May because it was the date closest to the anniversary of her mother’s death in 1905, Antolini explains. The first official observance of Mother’s Day took place on the morning of May 10, 1908, at the Andrews Methodist Episcopal Church in Graton, West Virginia, where 400 people showed up to honor the mothers in their lives. On the same day, another 15,000 people would participate in the first Mother’s Day in Philadelphia. For 70 minutes, Anna spoke at the Wanamaker Auditorium as part of the celebration.\n\nThe next year, the number of celebrants climbed as communities across the nation hosted Mother’s Day services.\n\n“It was obvious to [Anna] that the country’s sons and daughters possessed a ‘mother-hunger in their hearts’ and craved such a day of maternal tribute,” Antolili says. “She, therefore, resolved to devote her life to the holiday’s perpetuation.”\n\nIt would take several years, but in 1914, Anna’s life’s work was realized when President Woodrow Wilson declared Mother’s Day an official holiday after the passing of a congressional resolution.\n\nIn addition to the day of observance, Anna encouraged people who could not visit their mothers to write letters expressing their gratitude and even designated the white carnation, her mother’s favorite flower, as the official emblem of the holiday, according to Antolini.\n\n“The carnation does not drop its petals when it dies,” Antolini says. “Instead it ‘hugs them to its heart,’ described Jarvis, just as ‘mothers hug their children to their hearts, their mother love never dying.”\n\nDespite these well-considered details, Antolini explains that the mother-centric holiday Anna created was not the one her mother had envisioned in her prayer. While both wanted to honor women for their service as mothers, they differed on how to commemorate them and on what it means to be a mother.\n\nThe elder Jarvis was inspired by her work with the Mothers’ Day Work Clubs and, to her, maternal influence reached far outside the traditional domestic areas to “serve humanity.” Antolini explains that Mrs. Jarvis imagined a maternal celebration that included “civic leadership and service; mothers united in public works to empower themselves and help to empower others.”\n\nHer daughter, however, approached appreciating motherhood differently — from a daughter’s perspective. According to Antolini, Anna had no children and lived with her siblings.\n\n“Instead of a day reserved exclusively for mothers in celebration of their maternal influence, as envisioned by Mrs. Jarvis, Anna designed a day reserved for ‘sons and daughters to honor themselves by showing gratitude to the [mother] who watched over them with tender care in childhood days,” Antolini says.\n\nThe difference, according to Antolini, is in the celebration of mothers’ collective power (Mothers’ Day) and “the impressive breadth of their maternal role,” and a singular event (Mother’s Day) celebrating a sentimental image of motherhood defined by children. While Mrs. Jarvis wanted mothers to have “an active role in their own tribute,” her daughter’s national holiday ultimately reduces a mother to a “passive figure of praise.”\n\nWhile Anna Jarvis had a different vision for the holiday than her mother, as the years passed, her own hopes for Mother’s Day were distorted by commercialism. As industries capitalized on the day’s marketability, Anna became increasingly distressed about the use of her holiday as a money-making venture. She wanted the holiday to be a “holy day.”\n\n“Despite her calls to the nation to adopt her holiday, Anna considered it her intellectual and legal property, and not part of the public domain,” Antolini explains. “Never did she intend for the observance to become the ‘burdensome, wasteful, expensive gift-day,’ as other holidays had become by the early 20th century.”\n\nProtective of what she viewed as her intellectual property, Antolini says a 1944 Newsweek article alleged that Anna once had 33 lawsuits pending at one time and included disclaimers on a Mother’s Day International Association press release threatening legal action against people who used the holiday names and emblems without permission. To further her dominion over the now-commercialized holiday, Anna copyrighted her own photo, incorporated herself as “Mother’s Day International Association” and even verbally attacked first lady Eleanor Roosevelt for using “her” holiday to raise money for charity.\n\nMeanwhile, Anna Jarvis’s Mother’s Day wasn’t the only celebration dedicated to mothers during this time. Writer, abolitionist, and suffragist Julia Ward Howe established “Mothers’ Peace Day” in 1872, according to Antolini. She says the non-official holiday was celebrated on June 2 yearly until 1913, and was originally established after the Civil War for mothers who had lost their sons. Anna’s Mother’s Day would eventually replace this celebration, which was primarily acknowledged by peace organizations.\n\nIn Indiana, a man named Frank Hering was gaining credit as the “Father of Mother’s Day”, according to Antolini, for his “public plea for a nationwide observance of a Mother’s Day” in 1904. Hering, a former University of Notre Dame football coach, promoted his idea through his association with the Fraternal Order of the Eagles, though he did not provide information about when to observe this holiday, despite wanting it to be on a Sunday,” Antolini says.\n\n“It was not Hering who pushed for states to make it a state holiday or responsible for the day becoming a national and international celebration...so Anna hated it when he got credit,” Antolini explains. “She also believed that he was financially profiting from the day just to line his own pockets and advance his own political career.”\n\nUltimately, as the 111th anniversary of Jarvis’s holiday comes to pass, the holiday has transformed into a celebration of mothers outside the typical sphere of domestication. In the 21st century, women are recognized to be more than caregivers — they’re individuals with careers, passions, and interests outside of family.\n\nThe emphasis on commercialization has increased tremendously since the holiday’s inception, with an expected $25 billion to be spent this year alone, a nearly $2 billion increase from 2018. While increased spending was not the intent of either Anna or her mother, people around the world continue to shower their mothers with love and affection, and honor their memory in ways that feel right for them, and that is what’s most important."
