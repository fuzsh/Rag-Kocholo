        "text": "The riotous mass of bouncy curls that crowns Merida, the free-to-be-me heroine of the new Pixar movie, “Brave,” is a marvel of computer imagineering. A rich orange-red the color of ripe persimmon, Merida’s hair doesn’t so much frame her pale, creamy face as incessantly threaten to engulf it, the thick tendrils and fuzzy whorls radiating outward like a sunburst. There’s so much beauty, so much untamed animation in this hair that it makes Merida look like a hothead, a rebel, the little princess who wouldn’t and didn’t. Then again, Rapunzel has a supernice head of hair too.\n\nFrom her wild and woolly locks to her Clydesdale, the gorgeous high-stepper Angus on whom she races across the softly rendered Scottish hills and glens, Merida has been created as somewhat of an anti-Rapunzel (at least before Rapunzel received a girl-power makeover for Disney’s 2010 movie “Tangled”). Merida is active instead of passive, a doer rather than a gal who hangs around the castle waiting for Prince Charming to rescue her. More to the point and to the movie’s marketing, she is Pixar’s first female protagonist, which means that there’s a lot more riding on her head than that ginger mop. After 17 years of feature filmmaking and 12 box-office hits, Pixar has — ta-da! — entered the big business of little girls.\n\nIt hasn’t been easy, to judge by the deep divide between the movie’s seductive pictorial splendor and its discouragingly uninspired script by Mark Andrews, Steve Purcell, Brenda Chapman and Irene Mecchi. (Ms. Chapman, the first woman hired to direct a Pixar feature, either left or was removed from “Brave” and now shares directing credit with Mr. Andrews.) Based on a story by Ms. Chapman, the 3-D movie takes off with Merida, liltingly voiced by Kelly Macdonald, in teenage rebel mode. Merida adores riding her horse and, like Katniss Everdeen, she’s a crack shot with a bow. (She aims for fun, not for dinner.) The only burr in her happy-go-lucky life is her mother, Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson), who wants her to be a lady and polices her behavior accordingly.\n\nThe queen is a drag, but she becomes a menace when she announces that the local clan leaders will be popping by so that their sons can compete for Merida’s hand. Furious that she has no say in the matter, Merida pushes back at her mother, or rather at the matrimonial law the queen seemingly upholds by herself while her husband, King Fergus (Billy Connolly), goofs from his throne. But when defiance doesn’t do, Merida asks for help from a witch (Julie Walters), who, in a charmingly conceived and choreographed episode with a burbling caldron, a quorking crow and ye olde toil and trouble, offers a quirky spell that sidelines the queen. When Merida realizes that she may lose her mother permanently, though, she sets out to rescue her and, by extension, her family.\n\nIt’s easy to see why Merida prefers galloping into the world to sitting pretty at home. Early on there’s a scene in which she jumps in the saddle and races into a wonderland painted green and splashed with purple. She’s a wee thing, about the size of one of Angus’s feathered legs, but her flaming hair and fiery daring — she shoots from the saddle, bull’s-eyeing targets — make her seem bigger. When she takes a breather, surveying the land (this is her land, you sense) while Angus rolls on the grass like a puppy, you see her at peace with herself. It’s a welcome, unusually introspective interlude that slips into the ecstatic when she scrambles up a rock wall and twirls on its summit, laughing, happy, free and alone.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
