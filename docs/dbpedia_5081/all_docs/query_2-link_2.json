        "text": "Plot Synopsis\n\nIn this animated comedy, Rudi Wilson, a former music executive, uses her street smarts and improvised solutions to confront the endless challenges of raising her two kids in the suburbs. After the press exposes a scandal involving her and one of her clients, Rita leaves her job at Mass Exploitation Records in disgrace. Then, when she decides to move her long-neglected family from Manhattan to the suburbs, her husband, Jeffrey, leaves her for his mistress. Now, Rudi is dedicating her life to being a super single mom to her two kids, Apple and Dick, but she realizes that being a mother is more difficult than she thought, especially because maid Conchita and nanny Bernice are no longer there to do all the work for her. When faced with true motherhood for the first time, Rudi embraces the opportunity as best she can, even though she doesn't know she's not a very good parent. In addition to providing the voice of Rudi, Eva Longoria is also an executive producer of MOTHER UP!"
