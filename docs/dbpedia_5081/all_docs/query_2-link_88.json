        "text": "TWO RIVERS, Wis. (WBAY) - The mother of a missing child is asking for a change in her bond. According to a court document filed Thursday, Katrina Baur, through her attorney, asked the court to modify the bond from $15,000 cash bail to a personal recognizance bond.\n\nThe document said Baur is unable to post the cash bail as set and has been confined in the Manitowoc County Jail since Feb. 21.\n\nReported missing in Two Rivers, police activated an Amber Alert for Elijah Vue on the afternoon of Tuesday, February 20.\n\nElijah is 3 feet tall, weighs 45 pounds, and has brown hair, brown eyes, and a birthmark on his left knee. He was reported missing from an apartment on the 3900 block of Mishicot Road.\n\nElijah’s mother and a man her son was staying with were formally charged with child neglect Monday in connection with the boy’s disappearance.\n\nHis mother, Katrina Baur, 31, of Wisconsin Dells was charged in Manitowoc County with one felony count of party-to-a-crime child neglect and two misdemeanor counts of resisting or obstructing an officer. She was being held on a $15,000 cash bond.\n\nThe man Elijah had been staying with, Jesse Vang, 39, of Two Rivers, was formally charged with one felony count of party-to-a-crime child neglect. He was being held on a $20,000 cash bond.\n\nBaur and Vang both appeared for their initial court appearances Monday afternoon, at which time preliminary hearings were set for March 7, according to court records.\n\nManitowoc County District Attorney Jacalyn LaBre said Friday that Baur had sent Elijah to stay with Vang for disciplinary purposes and that Baur wasn’t in Two Rivers when Elijah disappeared.\n\nBaur told police she had left Elijah with Vang on Feb. 12 because she wanted him to teach her son “to be a man,” and she had intended to pick him up on Feb. 23, a criminal complaint said.\n\nVang called police on Feb. 20 and reported Elijah missing, telling police he had taken a nap that morning and brought Elijah in the bedroom with him, but when he awoke about three hours later he was gone, the complaint states.\n\nThe reward for anyone who has any information that could lead to finding Elijah is up to $15,000.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."
