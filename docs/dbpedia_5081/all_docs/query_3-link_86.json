        "text": "Layna Brown was heading to the Okanagan with her eight-year-old twin boys on Tuesday to celebrate her birthday.\n\nBrown’s father, Kevin Brown, told Glacier Media the family was expecting them in Kelowna at 5:30 p.m. for dinner.\n\n“Her husband called and said that he was concerned because he couldn’t get a hold of them, and heard there was an accident near Chilliwack,” Brown said.\n\n“We gave it a little more time and continued to not be able to get a hold of her, at which point [we] started to think she was involved [in the crash].”\n\nLayna, 40, and son Dominic died in the six-vehicle pileup on Highway 1 near Yale Road West on Tuesday afternoon. The crash involved 10 drivers and passengers.\n\nTwin Tristan was taken to B.C. Children’s Hospital in Vancouver with serious injuries.\n\nInvestigators believe the crash happened when one or more vehicles stopped abruptly due to an obstruction — believed to be a ladder — in the roadway\n\n“At least one vehicle failed to stop in time and caused a chain reaction of collisions. Impairment is not believed to be a factor,” said Cpl. Melissa Jongema with the B.C. Highway Patrol.\n\nNo other serious injuries were reported.\n\nBrown, a retired paramedic, said Tristan suffered multiple internal and external injuries, including a broken jaw and arm, displaced pelvis and skull fracture. “But he’s a fighter,” he said.\n\nThe grandfather said his daughter, who lived in Maple Ridge but grew up in Nanaimo, was “just an extraordinary, giving, caring person.” The boys, meanwhile, are “great all-star hockey players,” he added.\n\nThe family has started a GoFundMe to help raise funds for funeral costs and to support Brown’s husband as he takes time off work to be by Tristan’s side.\n\n“This tragedy was obviously unexpected, and I’m hoping anyone who sees this has it in their heart to donate to Layna’s family to help with funeral costs and aid in Tristan’s recovery,” says the online fundraising page, organized by Layna’s cousin Dirrae Young.\n\nYoung said Layna was a talented artist and had her own website for her resin artwork.\n\nBrown and family members will travel to Vancouver from Maple Ridge and Kelowna to be by Tristan’s side."
