Mom\n\nmuses about the point of writing this email. If I am\n\nalready dead, which is what she suspects, I wouldn’t\n\nbe able to read it. And if I’m alive, what kind of daughter\n\nam I not to write her own mother to let her know\n\nthat I’ve arrived at my fancy residency, safe and sound,\n\nand then to immediately send pictures of everything,\n\nlike I promised her! If this was a crime show, she posits,\n\nthe detective might accuse her of sending this email\n\nas a cover up for murder. How could she be the murderer,\n\nif she wrote an email to her daughter asking if she was murdered?\n\nher defense lawyers would argue at the trial. In fact,\n\nnow that she thinks of it, this email is the perfect alibi\n\nfor murdering me. And that is something I should\n\ndefinitely keep in mind, if I don’t write her back\n\nas soon as I have a free goddamn second to spare."
