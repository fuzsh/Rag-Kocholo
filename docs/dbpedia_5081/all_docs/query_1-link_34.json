        "text": "Animated feature films have come a long way from majorly being about princesses who need to be rescued by a Prince Charming. Children, nowadays, get introduced to progressive themes and ideas wrapped in a bright and visually stunning animated exterior. From Zootopia, exploring racism and racial stereotyping, to Brave, which gave us a princess who had no time for sexist traditions, there are many animated movies that explore complex and mature themes through vibrant visuals and musical numbers in a way that refuse to leave your head even after months and months of watching the movie. Here are a few animated movies with surprisingly progressive messaging that you can stream this Children’s Day with your child, or just cue it up on your next solo movie night. No judgements.\n\nMoana (2016)\n\nMoana, Disney’s Polynesian princess, quickly joined the ranks of the recent heroines who had ambitions other than finding their happily ever after with the perfect man. But what sets this one apart is that Moana’s story had no male love interest. Like any other Disney princess tale, Moana had stunning visuals and a highly hummable soundtrack, by Lin Manuel Miranda no less. It follows the titular character, the daughter of the village chief, who sets off on an adventure to reunite a mystical relic with their goddess Te Fiti, in order to save her village. She is joined in her adventures by Maui (Dwayne Johnson), a demigod, who helps her in her quest.\n\nStreaming on Disney+ Hotstar\n\nZootopia (2016)\n\nThe overarching theme of this Disney hit is that of celebrating diversity and destroying racial prejudices. These heavy and increasingly relevant themes have been presented through a fictional utopia, Zootopia if you will, where animals of all species and kinds co-exist. The story follows an anthropomorphic rabbit Judy Hopps, who gets offered a job in the Zootopia Police department. She slowly discovers a sinister, criminal conspiracy involving the disappearance of predators from the city. She enlists the help of a Nick, a red fox who is also a con artist, to help solve the case. The Academy award-nominated movie featured a star-studded voice cast, including Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, Jenny Slate, Octavia Spencer, Alan Tudyk, and Shakira.\n\nStreaming on Disney+ Hotstar\n\nBrave (2012)\n\nAside from giving everyone an unexplainable urge to trade their regular hair for wild and curly red locks and speak in a Scottish burr, the Disney-Pixar movie gave us a princess to root for who was, well brave, flawed, and wanted nothing to do with men and outdated customs. Set in the Scottish Highlands, the story revolves around Merida, who defies an age-old custom and sets in motion events that would destroy her family. Now she must introspect and figure out a way to save her family and kingdom. Instead of a romantic arc, the movie focussed on the tumultuous relationships often shared by mothers and daughters.\n\nStreaming on Disney+ Hotstar\n\nMulan (1998)\n\nThis is not a perfect movie. There are a lot of issues with it, but there’s no denying that Mulan is one of the most progressive Disney princess movies of the Classic era. The film was unafraid to show the brutal realities of war and the inspirational message of breaking gender constraints to stand up for what you believe in. Based on the Chinese legend of Hua Mulan, it follows the titular character as she takes the place of her weak father, when he is called to join the army, by pretending to be a man.\n\nStreaming on Disney+ Hotstar\n\nThe Lorax (2012)\n\nThis movie features a very strong criticism of capitalism and its direct relation to climate change. Set in a future where human greed has destroyed natural life and civilisation has receded to artificially created societies, the movie follows the adventures of Ted, a 12-year-old, who’s sets out to find a real tree to impress the love of his life. The movie stars Zac Efron, Danny DeVito, Taylor Swift, Betty White, and Ed Helms.\n\nStreaming on Netflix\n\nWALL-E (2008)\n\nWidely considered to be one of the best animated movies of all times, this movie covered a variety of grown-up themes, including environmental waste, dangers of technology, consumerism, obesity, and religion. This award-winning movie follows a lonely trash compactor robot who is sent to the now-deserted Earth to clean up the garbage. He is visited by a probe that contains another robot, called EVE, with whom he falls in love with and travels across the galaxy to alter the fate of humankind.\n\nStreaming on Disney+ Hotstar\n\nFrozen (2013)\n\nThe movie’s most enduring legacy is, perhaps, the soaring ballad sung performed by Idina Menzel that somehow still refuses to leave your mind. ‘Let It Go’ could be the only mantra we need going forward with any semblance of sanity during this disaster of a year. But this admittedly delightful song is not the only reason why Frozen has made this list. The movie is one of the few Disney films that is self-aware enough to poke fun at some of the more ridiculous tropes found in older Disney movies, like love at first sight, and marriage being the only ‘happy ever after’ worth getting. The story is predominantly about the relationship between two estranged sisters. Princess Anna sets off on a dangerous journey alongside a rugged iceman, his reindeer, and a snowman, to find her sister and save their kingdom from an eternal winter.\n\nStreaming on Disney+ Hotstar\n\nCoco (2017)\n\nThis delightful animated feature celebrates death. Inspired by the Mexican holiday Day of the Dead, the story follows Miguel, a precocious 12-year-old, who accidentally gets transported to the Land of the Dead. He has to seek the help of his dead ancestors to return to the land of living and to reverse his family’s ban on music. The movie was critically acclaimed for its representation of Mexican culture, exploration of death, and even won two Academy Awards for Best Animated Feature, and Best Original Song.\n\nStreaming on Disney+ Hotstar\n\nInside Out (2015)\n\nYou can make anything appealing by animating it and giving it adorable personality quirks. Case in point, Disney-Pixar’s Inside Out. The movie is set in the mind of young Riley, where we are introduced to her fiver major emotions in a personified form who try and lead her through her life in a new city. We have Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Anger (Lewis Black), Fear (Bill HAder), and Disgust (Mindy Kaling). The movie explores the not-much-talked-about reality of well-intentioned society expecting young people, mostly children, to be happy all the time and not go through emotions that might not be pleasant to experience.\n\nStreaming on Disney+ Hotstar\n\nOver the Moon (2020)\n\nThis Netflix original animated feature film delves into a topic that is rarely explored in movies for children. The movie is about overcoming the loss of a loved one and the different ways people deal with that grief. The American-Chinese film revolves around Fei Fei who struggles to cope with losing her mother to a terminal illness. To deal with the overwhelming grief, she decides to build a rocket and go to the Moon just so she can prove that the mythical goddess Chang’e, whose stories her mother raised her on, exists and she can sow the world that she doesn’t need to move on from these seemingly unrealistic beliefs and practices, including grieving for her mother. The movie stars John Cho, Sandra Oh, Ken Jeong, and Cathy Ans.\n\nStreaming on Netflix\n\nAlso read:\n\n10 childhood classics on Disney+ Hotstar that are perfect if you need a little pick-me-up\n\nWho are the voices behind your favourite animated movie characters?"
