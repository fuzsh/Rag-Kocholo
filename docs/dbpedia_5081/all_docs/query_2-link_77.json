        "text": "My mother was visiting me a few years ago in Chicago for Mother’s Day and we decided to go to church before brunch. The church was big and grandiose, filled with people. At one point in the service, the pastor asked all the mothers in the congregation to stand. My mother stood up. One woman after another rose to her feet. It was a nice tribute, an acknowledgment of all the things mothers are and do.\n\nI didn’t stand. I was in my mid-30s at the time and was not a mother (I still am not). After the service, an older man sitting nearby came up to me and said he’d noticed that I didn’t stand. “Is everything O.K.?” he asked.\n\nI felt awkward, unsure of what to say. He said he’d pray for me.\n\nHe’d assumed something was wrong because I didn’t have children. Why? And why did he feel he could approach me, a total stranger, and ask about this very personal matter? A woman’s fertility, it seems, is still a subject of public concern. But the strangest thing about that short conversation was that I didn’t know how to tell him the truth — that I had been a kind of mother. I didn’t have the words.\n\nI had been in a long-term relationship with a man who had two sons. We lived together, and since he shared custody of the boys with his ex-wife, we had them with us part of the time. It wasn’t simple. At first, I was unsure of how to adjust to having these young children — 4 and 6 years old — in my life. But over the nearly five years we spent together, our relationship changed.\n\nThe boys taught me how to play touch football and I introduced them to “The Goonies.” I spent hours in the grocery store trying to find food I thought they would actually eat, and together we spent more hours playing Sorry and Clue, driving to and from their mother’s house, reading books before bed.\n\nI remember one evening, the oldest was upset about something and went to his room to hide out. His dad went to see what was the matter then came back and said, “He’s asking for you.” Me? He’s asking for me? I was not the boys’ mother — they had one of those; I was not even their stepmother. But, I was something.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
