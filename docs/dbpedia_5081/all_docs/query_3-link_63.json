        "text": "We don't always like to admit it, but being a successful woman in the workplace is different from being a man and it comes with its own unique challenges (and rewards). I don’t pretend to know everything, but if you’ve got a question about trying to navigate the career obstacles all of us have faced at some point (but don't always want to talk about), I may be able to shine a little light on the answer or know someone who can. This week's question comes from a potential founder who is also about to be a first-time mom.\n\nQ. Last fall I was getting ready to launch the first round of funding for my start-up. Then I found out I was pregnant. Should I table launching my company until my child is a little bit older?\n\nA: The idea of juggling baby with start-up is absolutely daunting. But it shouldn't deter you right away.\n\nSince I live in the Bay Area I meet women almost every day who are launching new projects, platforms and companies, who are running businesses and families (successfully) at the same time. In fact, this boom in the population of mom entrepreneurs (use the word mom-trepeneur at your own risk) has grown to such an extent that markets and services are being created to cater to them. Katie Hintz-Zambrano co-founded Mother magazine in 2014, shortly after giving birth to her son Diego. This fall she will launch a new business initiative, the In Good Company conference, a day designed to cater to the demographic of women running businesses and juggling children.\n\n\"I can see a big mom entrepreneur surge happening right now, both online and in my local community in San Francisco. I have a 450+ member moms' club, many of whom own their own businesses. We all thrive off of meeting up with like-minded women (especially face-to-face), and the way we actively support each other's businesses is so inspiring and vital,\" Hintz-Zambrano explained about the need for her new initiative. \"I wanted to create a day that creative, entrepreneurial mothers from around the country could all come together and discuss the issues relevant to this growing demographic.\"\n\nThe conference will feature panelists like Amanda Chantal Bacon of Moon Juice and Elle Rowley of Solly Baby Wrap. Topics discussed will range from ace business tips to motherhood and activism and trying to keep your relationships intact while juggling it all.\n\nI point this out to show you that you wouldn't be the first mom out there to launch a business and you definitely won't be the last.\n\nTime and time again new moms and entrepreneurs tell me that becoming a mother has actually made them a better boss, a better business owner and a more creative and innovative entrepreneur. No two women have the same explanation for why this is, but don't take my word for it. Listen to these fourteen founders and CEOs about why being a mom just makes them better at work.\n\nTime Seems Too Precious to Waste\n\n\"I am in a constant time crunch, so when I'm not on-duty with my son, I'm working at turbo-speed. Time seems too precious to waste. Also, multi-tasking gets a bad wrap, but I do think mothers do it naturally and that extends to being able to take on more with work. Parenthood is also about resourceful problem solving, which is a great business skill, too.\" Katie Hintz Zambrano - C0-Founder Mother & Founder In Good Company.\n\nYou're Forced to Get Comfortable Trusting Your Own Opinions\n\n\"Starting a business is daunting because most people are accustomed to working in a structured environment, yet moms live in the wild west. There are no blanket \"right\" answers. The day you get pregnant, you start getting five different opinions on everything, mostly unsolicited. You're forced to get comfortable trusting your own opinions because you have to. The learning experience makes mom entrepreneurs, no matter how seasoned in business, efficient and confident decision makers. I have two boys, 3 and 1. When I was pregnant with my second son, I was in J-school at Stanford and my business partner was commuting from San Francisco down to Silicon Valley. On nights when I had late class, she would pick me up on her way back into the city. During those 2+ hour commutes in stopped traffic, Tilden was born. We launched last Mother's Day—my oldest had just turned 2 and my youngest was 4 months.\" - Laura Forman - Co-Founder, Tilden\n\nMoms Are the Toughest People on the Planet\n\n\"Moms are the best negotiators. They are empathetic, they value other people’s talents and time, and they are the toughest people on the planet. Show me one mom who hasn’t had her life changed after spending a first night awake with her feverish baby, or navigated the hurt feelings that her child comes home with from the playground. Moms are, in short, bad ass bitches - but also they are the most comforting allies around. They are the perfect people to have in a business organization to get shit done and keep other people happy.\" Rachelle Hruska MacPherson - Co-Founder, Guest of a Guest & Founder of Lingua Franca\n\nThe Tenacity Muscle Develops\n\n\"Being a mom has given me the ability to cut through crap. Because time is more precious than ever, we've developed the skill to recognize instantly if something is a priority and if it's not, we let it go. Also, there is a selflessness that takes over you when you become a mother. I think this makes us better leaders. We listen to our team and work together towards a common goal. We like to think this keeps our team engaged and motivated. Finally, the tenacity muscle develops. You realize every minute at work is a minute away from your family, so you are going to make it worth while. You fight for your company. You fight for your family. You fight like mad for everything.\" Megan Papay - Co-Founder, Freda Salvador\n\nBeing a Mother Instills a Powerful Sense of Discipline\n\n\"Let me preface this by saying that I fully tense up when someone refers to me as a mom entrepreneur as if motherhood somehow defines or, worse, handicaps the business I am running. Granted, my business is maternity clothes so mom identity is clearly very tied up with what I do, but I think everyone brings personal experience to their position that makes them uniquely qualified to succeed. I also think a lot of people out there believe that being a mother is fundamentally incompatible with being an entrepreneur. They can’t imagine how you could possibly be dedicated to your job and your children, while no one even bothers to question whether men with kids can be fully committed to their work. Being a mother motivates me every day, forces me to manage my time rigorously and instills in me a powerful sense of discipline with real consequences. You work efficiently because when you get a call to pick your kid up from preschool in the middle of the day, someone has to do it. That's family life. You manage your time so no one thing becomes a total catastrophe, and you keep going.\" Courtney Klein - Founder, Storq\n\nI Plan For Tomorrow Today\n\n\"Through organizing networking events in SF for moms who are entrepreneurs and noticing that this was a rapidly growing sector, we were inspired to start Radiant Workspace, our co-working space for women.\n\nBeing a mother, there's less time for everything at the end of the day so prioritizing and forward planning are essential as is the ability to get sh*t done. As a mom I've learned to plan for tomorrow today. I've always been an organized person but since I became a mother, my family nickname of chief commander seems more deserved than ever before.\" Temi Adamolekun - Co-Founder, Radiant Workspace\n\nI've Developed More Empathy\n\n\"Being a mom has taught me to stay flexible, have a plan B (or C!), and make the best out of each situation. It has trained me to become a more optimistic person and has naturally carried over to how I run my business. I think I’ve developed a lot more empathy for people, not just mothers.\" Jeanne Chan - Founder Shop Sweet Things & Co-Founder Harlow & Grey\n\nI Am Painfully Aware of My Strengths and Weaknesses\n\n\"I am much more focused on my goals now. I do not have the luxury of time, so organization and proper prioritization of each day is absolutely crucial to my survival! I am also painfully aware of my strengths and weaknesses now that I’ve become a mother. Grace. Grace. Grace. My girls have taught me to give myself grace, and reach out when I need to. I know my limits and I accept them. I direct my time and energy to the areas of my life and businesses in which I excel, and I ask for help with the rest. While my multi-tasking skills have risen to unprecedented heights since the girls came along, I have come to terms with the fact that I do not have to do it all.\" Karla Quiz - Co-Founder, James Fox Co\n\nI See More Joy in the World\n\n\"My experience in early motherhood was incredibly hard and humbling, but it was also empowering. As a parent, you learn to roll with the punches, build community that you can lean on, and trust yourself. I see way more joy and fun in the world than I used to. Watching a toddler approach even the most mundane things with wide-eyed wonder makes you realize that there's a lot of fun to be had in slowing down and paying attention to the world around you.\" Gia McFerran - Co-Founder, Mina Baie\n\nI'm More Fair and Generous\n\n\"Being a mom makes me a fair and generous manager and owner. It helps me to support my employees in finding the work/family balance. I love my job and my company, but instead of it consuming me the way it did in my 20s it is a wonderful part of my life. My boys come first.\" Rachel Pally - Founder, Rachel Pally\n\nI Have Been Trained to Have Patience\n\n\"Prior to having my children my level of patience was slim to none. I was all about instant gratification and wanting to handle things as soon as possible. Having children will undoubtably increase your patience and force you to take things at a slower pace. Your children have this great capability to throw curveballs that break us at our knees, taking our breath away. As mothers we are trained to have patience as our children grow and learn. It's the same way in business.\" Jacqui Saldana - Founder, Baby Boy Bakery Kids\n\nI've Learned Not to Sweat the Small Stuff\n\n\"As a mom you’re constantly putting out fires—a temper tantrum in the grocery store and three kids kicking and screaming. It’s the same as the work place. You realize when you go to work you will put out fires, big and small and being a mom is helpful in those situations because moms are good at letting things fly and we react so well in high pressure situations. Our work at Rags to Raches is fast-paced. Being a mom, I've learned to not sweat the small stuff. As a mom and a boss you have to put things into perspective and realize this is a small moment and I can really overeact or calm down and not sweat it and realize by tomorrow it will be over.\" Rachel Nilsson - Founder, Rags to Raches\n\nI'm So Much Stronger Than I Ever Thought I Was\n\n\"In becoming a mom, I learned so much more about who I am capable of being – I’m so much stronger than I ever thought I was, and that confidence helped me to see the potential for myself as an entrepreneur. Growing and nurturing another life is a powerful and transformative place for anyone to be in, and it gives you the space and perspective to realize that you are capable of creating things that are of value to others. Successful entrepreneurs have to have confidence in themselves – their vision, and their purpose, and the ability to remain flexible to adapt and problem solve constantly. Motherhood is a great incubator to cultivate these traits.\" - Deeanne Akerson - Founder, Kindred Bravely\n\nI'm More Creative\n\n\"As a new mom, having my own business has allowed me to tailor my life to my family’s needs and we’re all happier for it. Sure, there are stresses – I have to hustle more, but I like the challenge of that. Now, I’m way more creative and have fewer restrictions placed on me.\" Natalie DiScala - Founder - Oh Travelissima\n\nI Know How to Guide People to Make the Right Choices"
