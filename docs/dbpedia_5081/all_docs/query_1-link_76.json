        "text": "Monster House is a VERY good film in my opinion. It is a mix of horror and comedy, and i love it because all the characters have a good side to them. The film is about two boys that are best friends living opposite a rude, ignorant man called Nebbercracker. The old man lives in a scary house which has a life of it's own.My favourite part of the movie is in the beginning when Chowder accidentally kicks his basketball across the road to Nebbercrackers front yard. DJ goes to pick it up but then Nebbercracker charges out of the house onto his yard. He hates it SO MUCH when he sees people step on his yard so he grabbed DJ by the neck strap and started shouting on about how he has no right to be on his yard and he should just stay at home. A few minutes later Nebbercracker has a heart attack and ended up in the hospital.\n\nMr. Nebbercracker is seen as a mean man when it comes to his lawn, but that is because he is scared that the house will attack anyone that steps on his lawn.\n\nThe film was very good, it was very interesting and made me want to carry on watching it. There are many different important scenes you have to watch to understand the film, and that is what i love about it. It is like a puzzle where you have to put all the pieces together to know what is going on and to find out what is going to happen. There is a lot of foreshadowing throughout the movie about what \"monster\" is actually inside the house and how DJ and his friends are going to stop it from harming anyone else.\n\nPrint this review"
