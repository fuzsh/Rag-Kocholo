        "text": "CHESAPEAKE, Ohio (WSAZ) - It’s that time when everyone’s shopping for those new clothes and shoes to find the perfect fit. Turns out, your backpack needs to be a good fit too.\n\nAs students get older, the class load gets heavier, and so do their backpacks. Carrying a bag full of books all day can cause a host of back problems.\n\n“It’s pretty common with most kids,” said Dr. Jared Blankenship, physical therapist and the owner of Bridge PT in Chesapeake. He says carrying a backpack that’s too heavy can bring painful symptoms.\n\n“It’s usually a vague low back pain, neck pain, mid-back pain, usually worse as time goes throughout the day,” he said.\n\nBlankenship says it’s especially common in middle, high school and college students as they tend to walk more on a bigger campus. He says when shopping for a backpack, there are some specs to look out for.\n\n“You want double straps. You want something that’s well-padded, and you want one that kind of stands up on its own,” he said. “Several compartments also help to distribute the weight of different books.”\n\nYou may think some of the strappy features are just for looks, but they can actually serve an important purpose.\n\n“Backpacks make a strap that goes across (the chest) and it buckles,” said Blankenship. “That’s very helpful for load distribution.”\n\nBlankenship says most research shows that a backpack shouldn’t be more than 15 percent of one’s body weight. Easy calculation. Take your child’s body weight and times it by .15.\n\nAdd that number to their total weight.\n\n“If they weigh more than that with the backpack on, they need to take some books out,” Blankenship said.\n\nFor example, if your child weighs 100lbs, 15 percent of that is 15. If that child weighs more than 115lbs with their backpack on, it’s too heavy.\n\nYou also want to make sure that the backpack doesn’t sit too low or too high, just right between the shoulders and slightly above the lower back.\n\nYou may end up having to choose function over fashion when picking the backpack, but the good news is a healthy pain-free back is always in style.\n\nKeep checking the WSAZ app for the latest information."
