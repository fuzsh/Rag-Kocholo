        "text": "When both parents are fit and capable parents, there doesn’t need to be a battle between mothers and fathers. A court evaluates the needs of children involved and what may be in their best interests and looks to both parents for what they believe that to be.\n\nKnowing that a judge will listen to their opinions about the best interests of the children can help mothers successfully focus their cases and obtain positive results for themselves and their families.\n\nThe rights of mothers are determined in the same manner as most decisions regarding family law issues: in the best interests of the child.\n\nMothers can receive child support for the child based on needs such as food, clothing, shelter, activities, education, and more.\n\nMothers have the same rights as fathers in terms of parenting time in divorce cases. This means the mother – if she is fit to care for the child – should have ample time to take care of her child, provide advice, help with school work, and of course, have fun.\n\nThe time a mom gets to spend with her kids is precious. During a divorce, it can feel as if that precious time is being threatened. Throwing terms around like “sole custody” and “visitation” often serve to make a mom’s fear feel even more real.\n\nIn the vast majority of divorce cases, a mother’s fears are overstated. Divorce courts try hard to impact and change the lives of the children as little as possible. Judges structure their orders to provide consistency for the family whenever possible.\n\nParents all too often try to use the threat of “taking the kids away” as a means of getting what they want from the other spouse. Motives may include more child support or a greater distribution of the marital estate, among other things. While in the vast majority of divorce cases, threats to “take the kids away” are hollow, they can still stir up fear and anger.\n\nThe trick is for the mom to know the difference between the hollow and empty threats and a courtroom reality. You can only do this by being well informed. A divorce attorney from our team at Modern Family Law can help protect you and provide you with the peace of mind you need and deserve.\n\nLawyers can help by explaining to moms how a court reaches a parenting time decision, what factors it will look at, and what the real risks are. The phrase “parenting time” means the time allotment for each parent. A parenting time order consists of dates, times, locations, and sometimes directions as to parental conduct. Courts customize these schedules so as to fit the best interests of the children.\n\nDecision-making responsibility for children is also allocated between the parents in divorce cases. The phrase “decision-making” in family law refers to the parent responsible for making major life decisions for children, such as education, religion, and health care. Decision-making may be awarded to the parents jointly, solely to one parent, or it can be allocated out based on the subject matter.\n\nChild support obligations are common in divorce cases involving children. Very rarely is there a family law case where there is no support ordered. In most states, child support is calculated based on a strict formula that accounts for several factors including incomes of the parties, the number of nights each parent has custody of the children, and any work-related childcare expenses."
