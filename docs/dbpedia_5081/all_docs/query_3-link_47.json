Our deep love of plants, and the belief that eating more of them makes good sense, led us to create a line of Dressings &amp; Marinades that use only the highest quality organic &amp; non-GMO ingredients we can find. We do this because itâ€™s the right thing to do. Always just the raw goods.",

        "text": "Mother Raw's roots grew from a single seed planted by Michelle Kopman in 2010 out of frustration with salad dressings on the market. Her burning question was, 'Why can't salad dressing be as healthy as my salad?'. Michelle created her line of dressings from unprocessed whole foods, respecting the best of Mother Earth. She was a trailblazer of organic, plant-based and unadulterated natural foods, and was uncompromising on ingredients. She recognized the beauty and power of plants and believed that what we put on our plants, could be as healthy as the plants themselves. Mother Raw stays true to these roots."
