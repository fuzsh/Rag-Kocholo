        "text": "This is an example of what we call an ambiguous antecedent. It means a case where it's impossible to tell what or who a pronoun refers to.\n\nIt's very easy to accidentally produce this kind of construction in English, and it's something that even native speakers need to be taught to avoid when learning composition in school.\n\nOften the antecedent (what the pronoun refers to) can be determined from context, but grammar itself doesn't give any clues.\n\nFor example:\n\nQ: Why is Bob in the hospital?\n\nA: Bob and Dave got into a fight, and he beat him up pretty badly.\n\nThe answer (which would be perfectly common from native speakers) has two ambiguous atecedents, and only the context (knowning Bob is the one who's in the hospital) tells us who beat up whom.\n\nIt sounds as if the daughter is drunk and that’s why the beating occurs. Otherwise if someone says: “A (or The) drunk mother beats up her daughter.” makes it more clear. Also, “A (The) mother beats up her drunk daughter”. You see? No “because” explanations, or second clauses are needed. The word drunk accompanying the subject makes an implication as to why the action occur. “A drunk mother beats...” vs the “ drunk dughter” gets beaten."
