        "text": "The streaming giant’s anime library didn’t add new titles in March. However, given the late February debut of the live-action adaptation of Avatar the Last Airbender, it was a smart play. Instead, Netflix focused on the return of the weekly anime series release. This time it's one of the streamer’s flagship series, The Seven Deadly Sins. The series returned with Four Knights of the Apocalypse on March 24 with weekly Sunday episodes picking up several years after The Seven Deadly Sins. Pokémon Horizons: The Series, following Liko and Roy through the nine regions from Kanto to Paldea, also began streaming in early March (for the US).\n\nThe release slow down is always a good time for playing catch-up on recent releases. But if you’ve paid any attention to the news coming out of Anime Japan, then you already know the slow down is over. April ushers in the release of several newly acquired licensed titles. Notably the first season of the Black Clover anime series debuts on Netflix April 1, 2024. It joins the feature length Black Clover: Sword of the Wizard King, that’s been streaming since June 2023. April also marks the return of feature length anime movies. One Piece Film: Red, Haikyu!! Movie 3: Genius and Sense, and Haikyu!! Movie 4: Battle of Concepts all arrive April 1, 2024.\n\nYou might have also noticed the list hasn’t been reset this year. There's good reason for that; Netflix is dedicated to broadening the types of anime available. The list, as it stands, offers a mix of good entry series for newbies, stand out new and original series, as well as longtime favorites worth a revisit. Keeping that in mind, if you’ve been anticipating the return of Kengan Ashura: Season 2, Part 2 (happening in August this year), now’s a perfect time to revisit Season 1 through Season 2, Part 1. It’s also time to get ready for the Baki Hanma and Kengan Ashura crossover that is coming June 6, 2024!\n\nUntil the list reaches critical mass or Netflix stops supporting a title via licensing, I’ll continue to roll with it. And with that in mind, if anime adaptations of video games are your jam, consider checking out late 2023 release Onimusha.\n\nNote: As this is a list of anime series to watch, no anime movies were considered for this feature. This list applies to U.S. Netflix subscribers. Some titles may not currently be available on international platforms (yet). This list will also be periodically amended to remove series no longer available on Netflix, as well as add anime shows now available for streaming on the service.\n\nOnimusha\n\nOnimusha pulls characters from the popular Capcom game into a supernatural samurai action anime series. Set in the Edo period in Japan, Onimusha follows Miyamoto Musashi, as he sets out to battle zombies and thwart a rebellion. Modeled on the icon Toshihiro Mifune, an aging Musashi secures the use of the soul-eating mythic weapon known as the Oni Gauntlet to aid him in battle. But the weapon comes with a deadline and dangerous risks. Accompanied by a ragtag band of fighters and a monk, this ronin must complete his covert mission before the weapon consumes him entirely. Brought to brilliant life with a blend of 2D and CGI animation, fierce battle sequences, and a surprisingly emotional and complex narrative, Onimusha is an unhurried journey full of blood, gore, off-beat humor, camaraderie, betrayal, and sacrifice. It’s not perfect but it resets the bar for what to expect from video game adaptations.\n\nAkuma Kun\n\nThis twelve episode adaptation follows boy genius, Ichiro aka Akuma Kun, taken in and raised by demons. Ichiro and his demon-human hybrid compatriot Mephisto solve paranormal crimes. The series’ animation series blends in hand-drawn elements that give the show a vibrant and unique visuals. Each case offers new opportunities to build out the world and explore themes of good and evil, destiny as Ichiro struggles to keep his head above water all while knowing his demon father expects great things from him. There’s an excellent balance of wit, whimsy and pragmatism between Ichiro and Mephisto’s different personalities as they solve mysteries and contemplate life’s big issues. The show is thematically rich without being heavy-handed. The narrative’s constantly engaging and brought to life by a dynamic voice cast. Akuma Kun is the kind of fantasy series that isn’t afraid to be philosophical as this duo learn more about their world, its magic system and the part Ichiro’s expected to play in bringing about the Millennium Kingdom.\n\nDelicious in Dungeon\n\nBased on Ryoko Kui’s manga Delicious in Dungeon follows Laios and his trio of adventurers. It’s a race against time to come up with enough money, and a solution, to save his sister after she’s swallowed by a dragon. This fantasy series is built on aesthetically pleasing visuals, endearing character design and free-wheeling worldbuilding. If you’re in need of a slightly more light-hearted fare, this sword and sorcery story will certainly balance out the seemingly endless real-world chaos.\n\nOnmyoji\n\nThis first ever adaptation of Baku Yumemakura’s novel by the same name offers a near-perfect balance of outstanding animation, slow burn, and engaging storytelling. Set in ancient Japan, Onmyoji follows Abe no Seimei, a celebrated spell caster, as he meets and befriends noble Minamoto no Hiromasa. As he travels across Japan solving cases and connecting the dots of a larger mystery brewing. The series weaves history and legend together into a harrowing tale of friendship, honor, and sacrifice as the pair embark on a mission to defend the capital against a villainous mage plotting against the emperor. This tale is a journey into the supernatural wrapped in a character-driven bromance. There’s demon-slaying, magic twists and turns, and poignant revelations woven together into a storyline that’ll keep you invested. Onmyoji takes its time to put its players and pieces into place. But once the narrative gets moving, it all works to make this retelling into a riveting mystery brought to life with captivating color and motion. The story delivery may be quieter than some of the usual fare, but watching the interaction between the characters as the work to best each challenge and avert disaster is more than worth the time it takes to kick into gear. So, if you prefer your anime drawn from folklore and iconic figures then this thirteen episode series steeped in the dark and supernatural is exactly what you've been looking for.\n\nPluto\n\nPluto follows AI Detective Gesicht’s investigation into serial murders of the world’s most advanced robots and their human allies. As Gesicht hunts for the identity of the perpetrator, Pluto, he realizes the murders are challenges and Pluto has both him and Atom, also known as Astro Boy, in his crosshairs. Created by Naoki Urasawa (Monster), and reinventing an arc from Osamu Tezuka's Astro Boy, Pluto’s comes to extraordinary life with brilliant character design and animation by Studio M2 and an evocative soundscape. Over eight hour-long episodes Pluto explores humanity's drive to innovate and a world where its creations are increasingly indistinguishable physically and self-aware. This well-paced but winding story balances its philosophical musings with action, violence and thrilling cat-and-mouse race to stop a killer. This is more than a battle anime. Pluto never wastes an opportunity to develop its characters, invoke its allegory, or mess with your emotions amidst the mayhem. Simply put, Pluto is a vibrant, emotionally rich sci-fi masterpiece.\n\nRead our review of Pluto.\n\nMy Happy Marriage\n\nMy Happy Marriage is the story about Miyo Saimori, an unhappy young woman from an abusive family who gets married off to a fearsome and chilly army commander. Set in 19th century Meiji Restoration era-Japan this twelve-episode adaption of Akumi Agitogi’s light novel is a splendid and eye-catching example of the caliber of Kinema Citrus animation work. The character design, landscape shots and close ups are all gorgeous. When paired with a pitch perfect score from the opening to ending My Happy Marriage is a slow burning romance riddled with trials, tribulations pushing its breathtaking narrative. Cinderella wishes her backstory got such a lush and nuanced treatment.\n\nGood Night World\n\nBased on the manga by the same name, Good Night World follows the Akabanea family who’ve, although estranged in the real world, found a sense of peace and unknowingly find their way to one another in a VR game called Planet. Directed by Katsuya Kikuchi with stylized character designs by Suzuna Okuyama and dynamic visuals animated by studio NAZ, leverages its understanding of gaming as a hefty connective thread between the real and digital world to anchor its story and use in-game elements and relationship building to best use. This story of a family battling debilitating grief and how it’s ravaged their lives and relationships in the real world is surprisingly well-suited to video game anime. The MMO style world introduces plenty of opportunity for monsters, battles and quests with choices the consequences of ripple into the far more somber real world. This family of four must confront their trauma and grief in ways that force them to acknowledge death, their dependence on the game, and what that means for them in the real world.\n\nGood Night World’s strength lies in the human element and intimate care taken with the vital, if winding, path of emotional growth playing this game sets this broken family on. Despite a few wobbly story elements and some pacing inconsistencies episode to episode (due to being occasionally thematically overly ambitious), Good Night World makes for an constantly entertaining and deeply affecting story about relationship building, escapism and unavoidable if often grim nature of reality certain to resonate with those who like a bit of philosophical and existential angst with their escapism.\n\nDen-noh Coil\n\nIf you prefer your coming-of-age stories in the form of a techno-thriller, Mitsuo Iso’s (Orbital Children) directorial debut Den-noh Coil and its near-future world where augmented reality glasses are a necessary accessory to everyday life.

Yasako stumbles upon a mystery afoot in this scenic town where the traditional and futuristic collide: cyberpets and kids are going missing. Yasako joins her grandmother's unofficial detective agency. Soon she and the other school-age sleuths are hot on the trail of a virus, and its creator, corrupting the virtual space. Den-noh Coil, or Coil, and its storyline diving into the pros and cons of permitting tech integration into daily life may feel a bit prophetic in 2023. But that just means its stellar worldbuilding, careful character development, and narrative twists and turns holds up. It’s the kind of compelling slow-burn mystery that meets at the intersection of youthful shenanigans, urban legends, and the digital hubris. Animated by Madhouse and relying on beautiful watercolor-style visuals and music, Iso's first outing is a twenty-six episode gem that’s still far too underrated.\n\nMononoke\n\nMononoke follows Kusuriuri, also known as The Medicine Seller, (first introduced in Ayakashi: Japanese Classic Horror) in a supernatural murder mystery set in feudal Japan. Kusuriuri, a master of the occult, travels across Japan in search of malevolent spirits, mononoke, to destroy. These spirits prey on the negative emotions of humans.

Between its animation styled after ukiyo-e paintings and a storyline firmly rooted in the supernatural, Mononoke offers varied story arcs rooted in folklore to take you on a thematically rich journey into a psychologically kaleidoscope. It’s intensely weird, and yet, strangely humanistic. This engaging nightmare-fuel is a cult classic for good reason.\n\nZom 100: Bucket List of the Dead\n\nAdapted from the manga by Haro Aso and Kotaro Takata, Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead is a colorful satire where finding yourself in the midst of the zombie apocalypse is better than being a wage slave in a dead end job. 24-year old Akira Tendou is worn out after three years of mind-numbing work at a company deadset on wringing every bit of life out of him to meet their corporate demands.
