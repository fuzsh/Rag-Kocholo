        "text": "Within 20 minutes, Lucy Dacus got me to take another look at my obstinate stance against the concept of unconditional love.\n\nIf you know she’s a Taurus, you might think she’s all about conditions and caveats, yet during our conversation, she firmly tells me, “Unconditional love is a concept I’m still interested in. I feel like it can coexist with cutting somebody out — that act can be a loving thing to yourself and to the other person, as well. Unconditional love is not just about prolonging a relationship that carries a lot of pain.” I’ve always thought of it as a manipulative way to trap someone into putting up with your bad behavior, no matter what. But the way she puts it, the idea of unconditional love still has some elasticity.\n\nAt this point in our conversation, we are already semi off-topic. The original reason for our call is to chat about a song Dacus just released in honor of Mother's Day and Taurus season (the season in which we both happen to have been born), titled “My Mother and I,” which addresses how a person’s relationship with their mother can affect their body image. But since love is at the core of that subject, we let our minds wander.\n\nMy mother\n\nhates her body.\n\nWe share the same outline.\n\nShe swears that she loves mine.\n\nMany of Dacus’s songs are fairly ambiguous, at least when it comes to the person she’s singing about, but not this one — from the very title, the relationship at the core of the song is clear. She addresses this on the phone, saying, “This is the first song that I've put out where clearly there's a specific person that it's about.” However, the subject is still slightly more complicated than the average listener might be aware of. “I'm adopted,\" she continues, \"so I have two mothers — a biological mother and the mother who raised me.” (Note that her adopted mother is the Taurus, but the mother concept she sings about in the song is an amalgamation of both.)\n\nRegardless of the specific dynamics in her personal life, the song, which weaves in her experiences as an adoptee and growing up knowing her birth mother, is relatable to nearly anyone with a relationship to a primary caregiver and a body.\n\nI blur\n\nat the edges.\n\nI'm all soft shapes and lines,\n\nshapeshifting all the time.\n\n“My Mother and I” made me cry upon my first listen (OK, and on my second listen). My mother’s relationship with her body affected me deeply as I grew up and formed an opinion about my own. I tell Dacus about how my mom is an outspoken feminist and rarely says anything negative about her body or the bodies of others, yet I still picked up on certain things: the way she’d look at herself in the mirror, the way she’d talk about food, how little she'd eat some days. Dacus sighs, but it’s not out of resignation; it’s a breath of recognition.\n\n“Of course it's going to affect you,\" Dacus tells me, \"because, one, your body never goes away, and two, it never stops changing. So it's not like you can one day achieve ‘good body image’ and then keep it.”\n\nThe stars have a lot to say\n\nabout babies born\n\nin the month of May.\n\nBody positivity is a buzzy topic in our culture right now. Sometimes body neutrality gets a mention, but God forbid someone publicly address the fact that many of us have downright negative feelings about our own bodies without trying to sell you something to fix it. At this point in my chat with Dacus, the complex topic of how we view ourselves — and how that changes over time — is at the top of both of our minds.\n\n“Body image changes over time, and I think aging is a huge part of it,” Dacus says. “I want to do all I can to look forward to aging. I am going gray, and I'm so excited about it. I've always wanted gray hair and I’m just so happy each time I find a new one.” As for me, at age 30, I've noticed more gray hairs showing up smack-dab in the middle of my bangs. I feel pretty neutral about them, which I suppose is a positive thing. Dacus continues, “I look to my birth mother and see places where her face or her body have gone slack, and I picture it on myself. I love her, and I hope that can translate to me loving those things on myself further down the line.”\n\nI have mixed feelings about what the future holds for my body. Though I’ve felt more comfortable in my skin only as I’ve gotten older, my body feels like something of a ticking time bomb; I have the BRCA2 gene mutation, a genetic condition which means I have an increased risk of developing both breast and ovarian cancer as I age. However, I am also proactive about monitoring this and less self-conscious about other things as each day goes by.\n\nConflicted feelings about the aging process are not unique to me. With years come wisdom and experience, but in the eyes of society, over time we also lose some of our perceived worth. “In youth, so much hinges on your beauty,\" Dacus says. \"Our culture tells us being young and being fit are what will help you to succeed.” I catch myself nodding fervently. “That's a major factor of your love life, as well, and love shouldn't have anything to do with appearance.”\n\nWe are down to earth.\n\nWe see eye to eye.\n\nWe dig our feet in,\n\nmy mother and I.\n\nMy mother and I\n\nThough sun signs aren’t everything and astrologers encourage us to take the entire birth chart into consideration, Tauruses often have a fraught relationship with our bodies. We are often drawn to material comforts and luxuries (including food), we like to stay home a lot, and we tend to be consistent when it comes to the routines and relationships we establish. Though we’re independent, we’re also steadfast, loyal, and are frequently described as possessive and strong-willed. The life of a Taurus can include plenty of push and pull, and as Dacus describes in \"My Mother and I\" and to me over the phone, a relationship between two Tauruses only amplifies some of those qualities.\n\n“I think that our relationship at its best is a friendship,\" she says of her relationship with her Taurean adopted mother. \"I've never really been good at understanding the obligation that family carries. I'm adopted and she's adopted, and I believe that you choose your family — family is intentional. If someone is not treating you well, they don't deserve your time.” The idea of a chosen family resonates with me, as a queer woman who is constantly reassessing relationships with those who may not understand my identity or respect my decisions. This is how we got on the topic of unconditional love — when I tell Dacus I don’t believe in it, and she says that, actually, she thinks it may be a positive way to look at relationships.\n\n“I think [unconditional love] is actually an optimistic outlook,\" she explains, \"knowing that at a point someone was fulfilling you and then to have the space to say that's not the case anymore. I respect people that are able to do that, because otherwise it's like saying that a person's only valuable if you spend your whole life together. I think that the longevity question is kind of irrelevant to the quality of how people treat each other.”\n\nWe want love,\n\nwarm and forever.\n\nWe want to die\n\nin the presence of our loved ones.\n\nMy mother and I.\n\nMy mother and I.\n\nDacus and I are not mothers ourselves, but we both have empathy for our own (and for all parents) and cannot imagine the sacrifices it takes to raise a human, especially as Tauruses. As the conversation turns back to the lyrics of the song, Dacus explains, “The first line is about this confusing element of body image and negative associations to the body, and then at the end, the last line is me realizing I have no idea what each of them went through to raise me and give me a good life. I probably won't know what that’s like unless I become a mother, and it’s me trying to acknowledge that I appreciate their sacrifices.”\n\nI ask if either of her moms has heard the song yet, and she says that the mother who raised her has, though they haven’t talked much about it yet. “I hope that they can both come to love the song even though it's not easy material,” Dacus says. Like many of us who write or create art that’s inspired by people in our lives, Dacus says she tried to be as respectful as she could through the song while remaining honest. She’s saying some tough things, but she also makes a point of locating parts of her mother she loves the most. For example, she mentions how down-to-earth she is, as well as her ability to meet people where they are. Both of those things are embedded in the very nature of a Taurus, and Dacus feels she also has those traits.\n\nAll, she has given.\n\nAll, I have taken.\n\nAll is forgiven.\n\nAll is forsaken.\n\nIn the end, we agree that seeing someone you love express distaste for their own form while saying they love yours is a difficult thing to grapple with, especially if you feel a bit like their doppelg¨anger on a generational time delay. However, the feeling is also a common one. It’s something that’s come up time and again between me and my friends, and Dacus says she and hers have discussed it, too.\n\n“I have so many friends that I talk about this with,\" she says, \"how we have to cope with it internally and we take it on ourselves. I think that it's worth exploring for anybody that has the same issue.” Whether it’s something that’s been on your mind for your whole life or you’re just starting to think about this topic, listen to Dacus’s song “My Mother and I” for a nice, cathartic cry.\n\nRead more related stories on Allure:\n\nHow My Mother’s Death Set Me on the Path to Eating Disorder Recovery\n\nThe Personality of a Taurus, Explained\n\n31 People Reveal Their Definitions of Love\n\nWhat this genderqueer person loves most about the way they look:"
