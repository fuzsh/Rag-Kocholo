        "text": "Inside Out 2 is here with a new set of emotions and memories to make. Does the movie have an end credits scene, too? Keep reading to find out.\n\nA sequel to the 2015 Best Animated Feature Oscar winner Inside Out, Inside Out 2 is the latest animated feature from Disney and Pixar Animation Studios. The first Inside Out introduces viewers to Riley (voice of Kaitlyn Dias), a young girl who undergoes a huge adjustment in her life when her family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco.\n\nInside Out largely takes place in Riley’s brain—known as her Headquarters—where her emotions Joy (voice of Amy Poehler), Anger (Lewis Black), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Fear (Bill Hader) are projected through a console.\n\nForbes'Inside Out 2': Which Stars Voice The Emotions In New Animated Movie?\n\nIn Inside Out 2, Riley (Kensington Tallman) is now 13, and her mind is changing as she establishes a solid sense of self that makes her want to be a good person.\n\nHowever, when puberty arrives, Riley’s way of thinking changes overnight with the destruction and reconstruction of her Headquarters. The renovation makes way for new emotions including Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Embarrassment (Paul Walter Hauser) and a name for boredom—Ennui (Adèle Exarchopoulos)—to take up residency in her brain, which confuses Joy and Riley’s other core emotions.\n\nBaffled with the sudden change, Riley needs to find a way to deal with her new set of emotions as she arrives at a prestigious weekend hockey camp with her best friends Bree (Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green) and Grace (Grace Lu).\n\nForbesThe Top Summer Action Movie For Each State, According To Study\n\nRiley’s attitude changes when gets started at camp, as Anxiety takes control of her Headquarters. As such, Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness become suppressed emotions when Riley abandons her sense of self and begins to make questionable decisions to fit in with a new group of “cooler” friends while leaving Bree and Grace behind.\n\nJoy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness know it’s unhealthy for Riley to be controlled by Anxiety, Envy, Embarrassment and Ennui, so they try to work their way back into the teen’s Headquarters to restore the girl’s sense of self. If they succeed, Joy believes Riley will snap back into the state of mind she was in before her new emotions arrived and avoid making bad decisions.\n\nPoehler, Black and Smith all reprise their original voice roles in Inside Out 2, while Tony Hale takes over the voice of Fear while Liza Lapira voices Disgust.\n\nNote: Spoilers for the movie are discussed in the next section.\n\nWhat Happens During The End Credits Of ‘Inside Out 2’?\n\nEnd credits scenes can serve as a bridge between a film and a possible sequel or in the case of the animated world of Disney, a TV series. That, however, is not the case of Inside Out 2.\n\nLucky for fans of Inside Out 2, the movie still has two scenes during the end credits. The first one comes shortly after the credits start rolling, where Riley is sitting with Mom (Diane Lane) and Dad (Kyle McLachlan) at home at the dinner table and Mom asks her how hockey camp was.\n\nIn teenagerly fashion, Riley simply responds, “It was good,” and the scene suddenly flashes into the emotions of her parents as they respond to their daughter’s non-answer answer.\n\nForbesJude Law Says Role In New 'Star Wars' Series Fulfills A Boyhood Dream\n\nThe second end credits scene comes after the credits are done rolling. The purpose for it, as viewers will find out, is to wrap up some loose ends from a scene earlier in Inside Out 2.\n\nThe after credits scene is a callback to the middle of the film when the emotions Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness are suppressed and ushered away from Riley’s Headquarters and brought to a vault—where the girl’s secrets are locked away. In the vault, Joy and her fellow emotions meet the Riley’s Deep Dark Secret (Steve Purcell), but they can’t get him to reveal what the secret is.\n\nAfter the end credits are done rolling, Joy returns to the vault and asks Deep Dark Secret what the secret is, which he sheepishly answers. Joy thought the answer was something else and counters with a humorous response.\n\nDirected by Kelsey Mann and also starring the voices of Lilimar and Yvette Nicole Brown, Inside Out 2 opens in theaters nationwide on Friday."
