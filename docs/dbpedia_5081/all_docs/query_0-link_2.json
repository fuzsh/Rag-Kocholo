        "text": "Babar is a Canadian/French animated television series produced in Toronto, Canada by Nelvana Limited and The Clifford Ross Company. It premiered in 1989 on CBC and HBO, and subsequently was rerun on HBO and Qubo. The series is based on Jean de Brunhoff's original Babar books, and was Nelvana's first international co-production. The series' 78 episodes have been broadcast in 30 languages in over 150 countries.\n\nThis was the first regular series based on the Babar books; prior to this, two previous Babar specials narrated by Peter Ustinov were produced by Lee Mendelson and Bill Melendez for NBC: The Story of Babar, the Little Elephant on October 21, 1968, and Babar Comes to America on September 7, 1971.\n\nWhile the French author Laurent de Brunhoff pronounces the name Babar as \"BUH-bar\", the series in its first five seasons pronounces the name as \"BAB-bar\".\n\nIn 2010, a computer-animated sequel series spin-off of Babar titled Babar and the Adventures of Badou was launched on Disney Junior. The new series focuses on a majority of new characters.\n\nPlot[]\n\nBased on the books by Jean de Brunhoff and Laurent de Brunhoff, the plot of the first two seasons focuses on the story of Babar as it is told by him to his children. The past Babar is a young elephant who, traumatized by a hunter slaughtering his mother, flees from his home forest to the city, where a kind Old Lady adopts him and teaches him the ways of human life. He returns to his home forest full of ideas for progress and, following the previous elephant king's death from eating poisonous mushrooms, hatches a plan to drive out the unnamed hunter and his men. For his heroism, Babar is crowned king of the elephants, plans and builds Celesteville, and becomes a father himself.\n\nWhile the first two seasons focus on Babar's recollections of his childhood and early years as king, the series shifts its focus in the third season to Babar's family life in the present day.\n\nCast[]\n\nGordon Pinsent as King Babar\n\nDawn Greenhalgh as Queen Celeste\n\nLea-Helen Weir as Flora #2 (1990–1991)\n\nStuart Stone as Young Arthur (1989) / Alexander #2 (1990–1991)\n\nLisa Yamanaka as Flora #1 (1989) / Isabelle (1990–1991)\n\nJeff Pustil as Zephir\n\nPaul Haddad as Uncle Arthur\n\nStephen Ouimette as Pompadour\n\nElizabeth Hanna as Madame\n\nAllen Stewart-Coates as Lord Rataxes\n\nCorrine Koslo as Lady Rataxes\n\nJohn Stocker as Basil\n\nChris Wiggins as Cornelius\n\nNoah Godfrey as Victor (1990–1991)\n\nBenjamin Barrett as Pom (1990–1991)\n\nGavin Magrath as Young Babar (1989)\n\nTara Charendoff as Young Celeste (1989)\n\nBobby Becken as Pom (1989)\n\nAmos Crawley as Alexander #1 (1989)\n\nDan Hennessey as Truffles\n\nEpisodes[]\n\nMain article: Babar episode list\n\nTemplate:Babar Episodes\n\nCharacters[]\n\nMain article: List of Babar characters\n\nMovies[]\n\nBabar: The Movie[]\n\nIn 1989, New Line Cinema, Nelvana, and Astral Films announced that a film adaption of Babar would be released. This would be followed by a sequel released in 1999, titled Babar: King of the Elephants, and was released by Alliance Films theatrically and New Line Cinema as a direct-to-video film.\n\nBabar and Father Christmas[]\n\nThe 1986 television film Babar and Father Christmas won the 1987 Gemini award for Best Animated Program or Series (Merilyn Read, and Alison Clayton March 2014). It first aired on HBO in the U.S. on December 5, 1986, on the CBC in Canada on December 15, 1986 and on the BBC in the United Kingdom on Christmas Eve 1986. The film's DVD title is also known as Babar et le Père Noël in France. The film was made in Canada. The song \"Christmas in Celesteville\" was featured in the TV film. Gary Morton wrote the music and Merilyn Read wrote the lyrics. John Brough, Geri Childs, Teresa Dunn, and Craig Kennedy are credited as singers.\n\nCritical reception[]\n\nDavid Knox at TV Tonight commented on the subject of death and the way it is depicted in Children's Television, citing the pilot of Babar as an example, \"This week ABC replayed the pilot episode of the animated series in which the baby elephant loses his mother to a hunter after being shot by a rifle. Produced by a Canadian company in 1989 it doesn't shy away from the separation of mother and child, as written in the original Babar the Elephant stories.\" An ABC spokesperson told TV Tonight that ABC had carefully considered the content which aired at 3:30p.m. EST on ABC2 for a G-rated audience, ABC in Australia (2 July 1990 - 3 June 2012) \"At no point in the sequence was there any depiction of blood or wounds, and the depiction of the rifle being used was very careful and discreet. The simple animation style reduced the level of detail of the rifle and the action. While there was a sense of threat and menace associated with the hunter and his use of violence, having regard to the animation style, the level of visual detail, and the stylized manner in which the action was depicted, Audience and Consumer Affairs considers that this sense of threat and menace was very low. The violence in the sequence was very discreetly implied, and was not gratuitous as it was a pivotal, dramatic moment of great significance to the story.\"\n\nCharles Solomon of The Los Angeles Times gave a review of Babar's first few episodes, \"The designs for the characters and the simple animation capture the essence of Jean de Brunhoff's understated watercolor illustrations. The artists occasionally seem to lose their sense of the characters' size and weight: The young Babar jumps and climbs in ways that seem very unelephantlike (but very few elephants wear uniforms and crowns, as the adult Babar does). As the voice of Babar, Gordon Pinsent gives the elephant king a reassuring presence and keeps the mildly didactic stories from bogging down in moralizing. Child actors provide the voices for the young Babar and his friends, which makes the show sound a lot like a \"Peanuts\" special at times. Created by the Canadian Nelvana studio—the producers of the entertaining \"My Pet Monster\"--\"Babar\" manages to be endearing without sliding into the saccharine cutesiness of Hello Kitty. Parents with children in the 4-to-10-year-old range should plan on setting their VCRs: The kids will probably want to watch Babar more than once.\"\n\nCommon Sense Media finds the series suitable for viewers aged 4 and up, and has given the series 4 stars of 5 adding, \"Babar is a good role model who promotes sharing and getting along with others.\" They continued to say that Parents Need to Know that \"Although the show is an ideal pick for preschoolers, most kids will probably outgrow it by the time they're 7\". The review ended by saying, \"Many shows adapted from books tend to move at a slow pace. But Babar provides enough adventure and silliness to keep even the most active preschooler engaged. As an extra plus, the music is beautifully orchestrated. Babar exemplifies the lesson that all of us are the same on the inside. These elephants hold their trunks high, but they also know that money doesn't conquer all. Many kids' shows depict well-off characters as villainous and/or gluttonous; Babar shows kids that wealth doesn't necessarily equate to greed.\"\n\nAwards[]\n\nIn 1990, the TV series won a 7 d'Or award for Best Youth Program (Meilleure émission pour la jeunesse). In 1989, the TV series won a Gemini award for Best Animated Program or Series (Patrick Loubert, Lenora Hume, Clive A. Smith, and Michael Hirsh). In 1990, the show won a Gemini for Best Animated Program or Series (Patrick Loubert, Michael Hirsh, and Clive A. Smith). It was also nominated for a Gemini award for Best Original Music Score for a Series (Milan Kymlicka). In 1992, the TV series won a Gemini award for Best Animated Program or Series (Clive A. Smith, Patrick Loubert, and Michael Hirsh).\n\nDVD releases[]\n\nMain article: Babar videography\n\nIn Region 2, Fremantle Home Entertainment released 3 single disc collections on DVD in the UK on May 4, 2009.\n\nOn June 5, 2012, Entertainment One released the complete first season on DVD in Region 1 for the very first time.\n\n2000 series[]\n\nThere was a revival of the animated series in 2000 for the company Nelvana Limited, and the Kodansha company in Japan. Most of the episodes for the revival series have Babar and his family traveling in a hot-air balloon to different Lands of Adventure, such as the Land of Toys.\n\nVoices of the characters[]\n\nDan Lett as King Babar\n\nJanet-Laine Green as Queen Celeste\n\nKyle Fairlie as Alexander\n\nKristen Bone as Flora\n\nNoah Reid as Pom\n\nPhilip Williams as Zephir\n\nChris Wiggins as Cornelius\n\nJesse Vinet as Isabelle"
