Explore five top Mother’s email examples and why they work:\n\n1. Apple Mother’s Day gift idea email campaign\n\nSubject line: Celebrate Mom with Apple gifts.\n\nApple decided to share helpful gift ideas with their audience for this special day. This is an excellent Mother’s Day campaign example for eCommerce and retail businesses aiming to increase their seasonal sales.\n\nThe creators chose a simple layout with smooth colors and added beautiful product images. Plus, the copywriting is clever, explaining the benefits mothers will reap from the products. The calls-to-action are easy to spot and written in motivational language. Finally, the subject line is straightforward and forms the right expectations.\n\n2. MeUndies Last-chance Mother’s Day campaign\n\nSubject line: Last Chance 🎁 BOGO Sale for Mom\n\nWhen sending a last-minute email campaign, you need to create a sense of urgency early on. MeUndies indicated the time-sensitivity in the subject line, with the words “sale” and “mom” making the purpose of this email clearer. Plus, the emoji makes it more vibrant and fun.\n\nThe brand offered a “Buy one, Get One Free” promo code to create matchy mom-child styles. Through cute copy and appealing images, MeUndies invites subscribers to shop the sale and please moms ASAP.\n\nYou can also create similar last-minute emails as part of a drip campaign series. Moosend has all the features you’ll need to streamline them, so sign up for an account and experiment with our automation features.\n\nTry Moosend\n\n3. Headspace Mother’s Day special offer email\n\nSubject line: Get 20% off for the perfect gift\n\nHealth and wellness products or services are popular Mother’s Day gifts, so if you’re in this industry you should create a seasonal email marketing strategy to promote your products. Here, Headspace offered a limited-time discount for Mother’s Day, as mentioned in the subject line and email body.\n\nThis email is brand-specific and has a clear F-shaped layout to help readers spot all essential information quickly. The copywriter chose to include all the benefits of the promoted service to make it more appealing. Plus, the CTA buttons create a sense of urgency to move customers to the checkout faster.\n\n4. Nanit Mother’s Day sale email\n\nSubject line: Happy Mother’s Day from Nanit!\n\nNanit chose a simple email design style to promote their Mother’s Day sale, which is an excellent choice if you want to limit distractions and get readers straight to the gist. The image at the beginning speaks for itself, showing how pure and joyful the mother-child relationship is.\n\nThe offer is written in bold so that it stands out from the rest of the text and the “Shop Now” CTA button is easy to find. Regarding the subject line, a small reference about the sale could yield more open rates, but it still works well.\n\n5. Burt’s Bees Mother’s Day appreciation email\n\nSubject line: Happy Mother’s Day to ALL kinds.\n\nBurt’s Bees created an inclusive Mother’s Day email campaign to celebrate all kinds of moms, as stated in the subject line. Instead of sharing exclusive offers and discounts, they chose to raise awareness on important motherhood issues. They also started a constructive dialogue on social media, inviting readers to share stories about their moms.\n\nEven though the brand put emphasis on the message, they also displayed some of their products, without creating a related call-to-action. Overall, this is an excellent example for bloggers and nonprofits who wish to create more impactful campaigns on this special day.\n\nTips For Mother’s Day Subject Lines That Convert\n\nIf you have an awesome Mother’s Day subject line idea but you’re wondering how to optimize it for your target audience, here are some best practices to follow:\n\nCreate a short subject line: It should be within 30-50 characters to be readable on mobile devices, too.\n\nEngage your readers: Write descriptive copy that reflects the email content and add funny elements and emojis if your brand allows it.\n\nLeverage personalization: Add tags to create more targeted subject lines with each recipient’s name or based on location.\n\nA/B test them: Find the most impactful subject line version based on multivariate tests and send it to the majority of your subscribers.\n\nUse a subject line tester: These tools help users improve their subject line based on several factors, such as email list size. Use Moosend’s free tester Refine to get a better grasp.\n\nTime To Show Mothers The Gratitude They Deserve\n\nWhat sort of messaging would you like to instill into your next Mother’s Day email? Define your campaign goal and all the resources needed to create an emotive campaign with initiatives all moms will love. Then write an outstanding subject line to get the open rates your email deserves.\n\nAnd yes, email automation software can make this process simpler and smoother.
