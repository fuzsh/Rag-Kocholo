        "text": "I posted the Mother Culture Reading List last week. That list is meant for a more casual sort of reading. Yes, it’s organized and, yes, it’s structured by habit — but at the end of the day there is something more ordinary about it. The Mother’s Education Course list (the list below) is meant for you more serious readers. To try and undertake anything like the MEC, even for a summer, requires more discipline than habit because it’s meant for student-type study.\n\nMy personal opinion is that mothers of babies ought not put that sort of pressure on themselves. Mother Culture reading was designed to be sufficient and is sufficient. But at some point in your motherhood, you might feel up for something more challenging and it turns out Charlotte Mason had ideas about that, too.\n\nShe called it the Mother’s Education course. The MEC was a three-year (and later a two-year) program Charlotte Mason put together to educate moms. (If you want a more detailed history of the program, read this.)\n\nThe program assigned books in four subject areas:\n\nDivinity\n\nPhysiology and health (with an emphasis on caring for children)\n\nMental and moral science and education\n\nNature lore and the elements of science\n\nI’m offering my own list of books in these four subject areas. If you want to simply be inspired by the MEC, you can just add some books from this list (or books you choose yourself that fit into these categories) to your reading stack. Please note: this is what I do. I sort of fuse the Mother Culture habits I have already built with the categories of the MEC from time to time and call it Good Enough for Me.\n\nIf, however, you want to read books from this list in a truly MEC way, you need to buckle up, buy a giant stack of books, and read about 25 pages in each subject area per week. I also highly recommend keeping a commonplace and/or reading notebook, as well as narrating to yourself.\n\nCharlotte Mason gave examinations, but I promise not to quiz you on these books.\n\nAs usual, these titles are pulled from my personal reading lists. I have either already read these books, or plan to read them in the near future. (I never recommend books I wouldn’t spend money on myself.)\n\nSo let’s get to the fun part: the lists!\n\nDivinity\n\nToday, we use the word theology. Theology and divinity mean basically the same thing. Charlotte Mason’s divinity assignments attempted to answer basic questions about biblical history and theology, as well as questions about passing on the faith to our children. I try to choose books that do the same — understand, though, that the “basic” questions I’m thinking of aren’t the basic questions from Charlotte Mason’s day. Rather, the basic questions of our time are what I’m interested in exploring.\n\nPhysiology and Health\n\nIf you want the basic books for this category — the ones I would actually recommend you to start with if you don’t read much in this subject area — make sure you check out my past MEC posts. These books are, yes, intended to help you take better care of the health of your family, but I feel like they build on prior knowledge that is covered in previous lists.\n\nMental and Moral Science and Education\n\nCharlotte Mason’s goal for this category was to show the principles of education, as well as methods based on these principles. Charlotte Mason, of course, assigned parts of her own books here. But I know you already know about these. The question is what else she would assign. Often, her focus was on the best of educational thought throughout history. The number of pages she devoted to the history of classical education was astounding!\n\nNature Lore and the Elements of Science\n\nMothers who know about nature and science can talk more naturally with their children as they walk along the way — no stopping for Google required. While I don’t think there is anything wrong with saying “I don’t know” and looking things up together, this part of the MEC curriculum was trying to offer moms an understanding of the world around them. In this category, you can read about flowers and rocks, or Einstein’s Theory of Relativity. It depends on what your children are like and what they harass you about, I suppose.\n\nWant more book ideas? Try my past MEC lists:"
