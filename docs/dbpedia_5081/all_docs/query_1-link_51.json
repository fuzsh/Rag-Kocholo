If you tune in, you'll notice the movie, while true to the animated film, has some key differences from the original.\n\nFrom a brand new character who acts as a foil to Mulan and some nods to cut scenes from the 1998 picture, keep reading to see the biggest changes the live-action movie makes from Disney's animated classic.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. The new film is narrated, in part, from the perspective of Mulan's father.\n\nUnlike the animated film, the live-action story opens with Mulan's father, Hua Zhou, narrating the story of his legendary daughter. The animated film opens from the villain's perspective as he invades China through the Great Wall. The landmark isn't featured in the new Disney film.\n\nInterestingly enough, an alternate opening for the animated movie featured Mulan introducing herself as an eventual legend who saved China from Shan Yu.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. This version of Mulan wields the power of Chi and feels more like a superhero than a Disney princess.\n\nUnlike her animated counterpart, this version of Mulan is not clumsy. From a young age, she is sure-footed with great reflexes.\n\nWhen channeled, Mulan's Chi heightens her warrior abilities. She glides across rooftops, scales walls, and fires spears into enemies. She feels more like a Marvel superhero than a Disney princess.\n\nHer father reluctantly tells her she must hide her gift, which is meant for warriors, not daughters. Similarly, Carol Danvers is initially told to repress her superpowers in Disney and Marvel's \"Captain Marvel.\"\n\nCinematographer Mandy Walker told Insider she and director Niki Caro discussed the parallels between Mulan and other superheroes.\n\n\"The difference between Mulan and a superhero such as Captain Marvel or Wonder Woman or anybody like that is that what she's doing is a version that's a little bit more grounded in reality,\" Walker said of the comparisons. \"You see people parkouring and climbing buildings.\"\n\n\"Lightning bolts [aren't] coming out of her hands,\" said Walker. \"There's nothing kind of metaphysical about what she does. She can do things to an elite level.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. The 2020 movie shows us a young Mulan.\n\nShe's seen getting into mischief and using her Chi, something that upsets the rest of Mulan's neighbors. We never see the character as a child in the animated film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. The live-action film emphasizes Mulan's relationship with her father more.\n\nMulan's father initially encourages his daughter's Chi. Once he realizes she could be ostracized for embracing her power, he reluctantly asks her to hide her gift from the world.\n\nOriginal co-director Tony Bancroft told Insider he was happy to see more scenes between the two in the live-action film.\n\n\"In the animated version, we had some more scenes with Mulan, and her family and her father, particularly, and ended up cutting some or moving where they were in the film, but definitely cutting some,\" Bancroft said.\n\n\"You could have dug deeper in a lot of relationships in the original 'Mulan' and thankfully in this one I feel like they do.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Mulan doesn't have a pet dog named Little Brother. Instead, she has a younger sister, Xiu, in the new movie.\n\nMulan is an only child in the animated movie. \"The Ballad of Mulan,\" which inspired the live-action screenplay, references Mulan's older sister and younger brother. Xiu appears to encapsulate both siblings.\n\n6. Mulan's grandmother doesn't make an appearance in the new movie.\n\nThough she gave Mulan her good luck charm, Cri-Kee, early in the film, she served as comic-relief in the animated picture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. The live-action movie gives us a completely new villain.\n\nBori Khan is a pretty one-dimensional villain who seeks revenge on the Emperor for killing his father. Shan Yu and his Hun army try to take the country of China in the animated movie. In the new film, Bori Khan leads the Rouran army.\n\nBancroft told Insider they originally considered a different villain in the animated film by the name of Bao Gung. The character would have been a sergeant in Mulan's army before revealing himself as a spy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. The live-action movie introduces a second villain, Xianniang, who is a perfect foil to Mulan.\n\nXianniang is a woman who wasn't afraid to hide her Chi. As a result, she was exiled from her people and decided to join Bori Khan as a way to gain respect. Her powers grew and she became known as a witch despite wanting to follow a more honorable path as a warrior.\n\nMulan stands at a crossroads in the live-action adaptation. Her actions can send her down a noble path toward one of light or toward a more destructive dark side. Xianniang shows Mulan everything she can become if things don't turn out well for her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. The live-action movie isn't a musical, but it does reference several of the songs from the animated picture in clever ways.\n\nYou can hear \"Honor to Us All\" play in the background as Mulan prepares to visit the matchmaker at the film's start. Sergeant Qiang references \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" before an army training montage and some of Mulan's comrades speak lyrics to \"A Girl Worth Fighting For.\"\n\n\"Reflection\" is referenced a few times throughout the movie, too. We'll get back to that in a moment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. The matchmaker finds Mulan a husband in the new movie.\n\nMulan is never matched in the animated movie, although a deleted scene originally paired her with a young man. Instead, the matchmaker tells her she's a disgrace and that she'll never bring her family honor after her session turns disastrous.\n\nSimilarly, the match doesn't come to fruition in the live-action film when the meeting goes sideways.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n11. A spider, instead of Cri-Kee, spoils Mulan's matchmaker session.\n\nA spider ruins Mulan's important meeting leading to shattered teacups.\n\n12. Mulan's father doesn't leave his walking cane with his wife when he retrieves the Chinese army's order to go to war.\n\nIn the new film, he lays the cane down on stone before marching to accept it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n13. Mulan doesn't speak back to the army recruit in defense of her father.\n\nIn the animated movie, Mulan pleads with the commanding officers to reconsider forcing her frail father to go to war. In response, Mulan's father tells her she dishonored him for speaking out of turn.\n\nIn the new movie, Mulan never gets the chance to speak out. After the matchmaking incident, her mother holds her back, saying she'll humiliate her father further.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n14. Mulan doesn't sing \"Reflection,\" but the song is at the heart of the film.\n\nMulan breaks out in song after her trip to the matchmaker goes south in the 1998 film. The new film skips this moment and goes directly into the scene where Mulan's father is requested to go to war.\n\n\"Reflection\" becomes a big part of the live-action film. An orchestral version of the song plays as Mulan successfully carries buckets of water up the stone steps and later when she finally lets down her hair and embraces her Chi.\n\nMatthew Wood, the composer of the animated film, returned to work on music, including \"Reflection\" in the new film. Christina Aguilera returned to record a new version of the song and Liu Yifei performed the song in Mandarin for the live-action film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n15. A phoenix replaces Mushu as Mulan's family guardian.\n\nThe ancestors send the great stone dragon to go after and protect Mulan in the animated picture. When Mushu accidentally breaks his statue, he goes after Mulan.\n\nIn the 2020 film, Mulan's father tells Mulan the phoenix will always protect and watch over their family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n16. Mulan doesn't chop off her hair.\n\nThe moment has one of the best musical interludes in the original film. Mandy Walker told Insider, as far as she knew, there was never anything in the script that suggested they would have cut Mulan's hair in the 2020 adaptation.\n\n\"It was never written in the script that she cuts her hair,\" Walker said. \"For me, it was all about her being a woman and maintaining that. She hid her hair, but when it comes out, it's a big part of her being a woman... It's part of her femininity.\"\n\nThe decision to not cut Mulan's hair also led to a big payoff moment later in the new film when she decides to embrace her Chi and no longer stand behind the fake identity she made up for herself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n17. Mulan's lucky cricket, Cri-Kee, isn't in the movie. Instead, he's introduced as one of Mulan's comrades in war.\n\nThe character goes by Cricket in the new film as one of five soldiers close to Mulan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n18. The live-action movie splits Li Shang into two characters.\n\nLi Shang doesn't exist in the new movie. Instead, the live-action film introduces fans to Honghui, a young man who serves as Mulan's equal in the fifth battalion. Donnie Yen plays her commanding officer and mentor who encourages her to embrace her Chi.\n\nIn February, producer Jason Reed told Collider they made the change to Li Shang because they didn't think it would be appropriate for Mulan to engage in a relationship with her direct superior.\n\n\"I think particularly in the time of the #MeToo movement, having a commanding officer that is also the sexual love interest was very uncomfortable and we didn't think it was appropriate,\" Reed said.\n\nWhile fans may have been upset by the split, Bancroft told Insider Shang was originally designed as one of the troops in Mulan's army just like Ling, Chien-Po, and Yao.\n\n\"We had another character named Bao Gung who was the sergeant and then Shang was in the army,\" said Bancroft of the cut \"Mulan\" character. \"It was very similar.\"\n\nWhen Bao Gung was cut from the film, Li Shang was promoted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n19. Mulan goes by a different name when she goes undercover in the army.\n\nMulan tells Li Shang her name is Ping at the suggestion of Mushu in the 1998 movie. In the new film, Mulan goes by the name Hua Jun.\n\n20. Mulan sleeps in a tent full of men in the new film.\n\nMulan sleeps in her own tent away from the rest of the men in the original film. On the animated film's commentary, the directors said it was a subtle way of showing Mulan was an outcast from the camp.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n21. The battalion isn't tasked with retrieving an arrow from the top of a pillar in the new film.\n\nMulan proves her worth to the army by successfully climbing a wooden pole with weights in the animated movie. In the new film, Mulan and her comrades must carry two buckets of water up a staircase. Mulan becomes the first to complete the task.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n22. Po drops his towel in front of Mulan instead of Yao.\n\nOne of the most memorable moments in the original film is when Yao stands above Mulan, Ling, and Chien-Po at the lake to reintroduce himself now that they're friends. Mulan averts her eyes to try and avoid looking at Yao.\n\nIn the new film, Po drops his towel earlier in the film when he's trying to catch something thrown his way inside the men's sleeping quarters. Mulan, embarrassed, winces and closes her eyes quickly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n23. Mulan purposefully avoids showering in the new film by standing watch for guard duty.\n\nWe never see Mulan try so hard to keep her secret from the others in the animated film. In the live-action film, the danger of being caught is front and center.\n\n24. Honghui interrupts Mulan when she bathes instead of the gang of three.\n\nIn the animated movie, Mushu distracts Ling, Po, and Yao so Mulan can make a quick escape. In the new film, Mulan keeps her back turned to Honghui and pushes him away in order to get him to leave.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n25. Commander Tung wants Hua Jun to marry his daughter.\n\nCommander Tung says he knows Hua Jun's father and would be honored to introduce Jun to his daughter at some point.\n\nMulan, taken aback, says it would be an honor.\n\n\"I look forward to seeing your father's face when you give him this news,\" Tung told Mulan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n26. Honghui doesn't have a father in the war in the new film.\n\nIn the animated film, Li Shang's father was the general of a different unit. He and his battalion were slaughtered by Shan Yu's army.\n\nWe still see a regiment slain in the live-action film, but it's not one that was led by Honghui's father. Honghui's father isn't the son of a general in the live-action film. We know that Honghui has a military background, but we never learn if his father was someone important in the war.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n27. The big avalanche sequence happens differently.\n\nIn the animated movie, Mulan uses quick thinking to aim a cannon at a position on the mountain to start an avalanche.\n\nIn the new film, Mulan instigates Bori Khan's army so they fire at her in the mountains to cause the snowslide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n28. Mulan is never injured by the film's villain.\n\nIn the animated movie, Mulan gets so close to Shan Yu on the battlefield that he's able to slash her. The injury winds up revealing that Mulan is a woman.\n\nMulan never gets injured on the battlefield and reveals her true identity on her own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n29. Mulan has complete control when she reveals her true identity in the live-action movie.\n\nIn the live-action film, Mulan marches over to Commander Tung with her hair down and reveals herself as a woman after saving the entire battalion. She asks for forgiveness and is expelled.\n\nThis agency is stripped from Mulan in the animated movie. After suffering an injury from Shan Yu, she's dragged out of a medic tent by Chancellor Chi-Fu. He proceeds to undo her hair from its bun and proclaim she's an imposter before mercilessly tossing her to the ground.\n\nIt's dehumanizing to watch the two scenes side by side as she's abandoned in the snow.\n\n30. Mulan leads her comrades into battle against Bori Khan at the film's end.\n\nNo one believes Mulan in the animated film when she initially warns them that Shun Yu is still alive and a very real threat to the dynasty. In the live-action film, they follow her into battle before letting her chase after the Emperor on her own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n32. The Emperor doesn't sit idly by as he's threatened by the film's villain.\n\nJet Li plays the Emperor in the new film and he shows off some of his martial arts skills late in the film when he's taken hostage by Bori Khan.\n\nIn the animated film, he refuses to engage with Shan Yu. It wouldn't make sense for Jet Li's character to do the same when he announces at the film's start he was responsible for killing Bori Khan's father. This is a man of action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n33. The entire showdown with the film's villain doesn't happen at the Emperor's palace.\n\nMulan defends the Imperial City against Shan Yu during a massive public celebration. In the new film, the action is taken away from the palace and is relocated to a construction zone.\n\n34. The whole kingdom doesn't bow down to Mulan when the Emperor tells her she has saved everyone.\n\nMulan gets a meet and greet with the Emperor in his throne room at the end of the live-action movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n35. In the new film, the Emperor invites Mulan to join his guard.\n\n\"In gratitude to your service and dedication, I invite you to take your place with our greatest decorated warriors as an officer in the Emperor's guard,\" says the Emperor.\n\nIn the animated film, the Emperor suggests making Mulan a member of his council or giving her the Chancellor's position. Mulan turns down the offer in both films though she appears to reconsider the Emperor's offer at the end of the live-action film when he extends the invitation a second time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n36. The Emperor bestows Mulan with different gifts when she turns down a chance to join his elite guard.\n\nIn the live-action film, the Emperor replaces the Hua family sword after it was destroyed during Mulan's battle with Bori Khan. The new sword features four pillars of virtue: Loyal, brave, true, and devotion to family.\n\nIn the animated film, the Emperor gifts Mulan with Shun Yu's sword and the Emperor's crest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n37. Honghui never meets Mulan's family.\n\nHonghui sees Mulan off as she rides home in the new film.\n\nIn the animated movie, Li Shang travels to Mulan's village to return her father's helmet and is invited to stay for dinner.\n\nRead next\n\nDisney Movie News\n\nAdvertisement"
