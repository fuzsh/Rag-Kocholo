        "text": "For all they do for us, mothers should be celebrated every day. But, it’s nice to give mom a little extra love on Mother’s Day — she deserves it!\n\nWhether you’re taking her out to dinner, making her a handmade card, buying her flowers or just calling to tell her how much you love her, Mother’s Day is the moment to make our mamas feel special. Mothers can also come in many different forms, and it’s time to celebrate everyone from hardworking single moms and motherly figures to selfless mothers who have adopted children and stepmoms who love their spouse’s kids as their own and beyond.\n\nWhat better way to show appreciation for someone you love than with a specially curated playlist? Musicians of all genres and ages have shared how much they love their moms through their music, and trying to narrow down all the mother-themed songs can be overwhelming. Thankfully, Billboard has you covered.\n\nFrom Tupac, Drake and Kanye West delivering flawless bars about the roles their mothers have played in their lives to Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC and Spice Girls giving us Hallmark-ready lyrics about motherly love, our playlist has songs that every mom will love. Plus, we’ve picked out some of the greatest, most meaningful pop, rock and country tributes to moms, penned by Taylor Swift, Carrie Underwood, Paul McCartney and more. No matter what genre or generation these tracks came from, all of them have one thing in common — they were made with a whole lot of love.\n\nRaise a glass to mom this Mother’s Day, and let these songs be your soundtrack."
