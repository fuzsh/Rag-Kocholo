        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nWarning: There are spoilers ahead for Disney's \"The Little Mermaid\" remake.\n\nInsider gathered the biggest differences between \"The Little Mermaid.\"\n\nThe remake includes three new songs. Ariel doesn't sign a contract with Ursula.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe remake opens on a quote from Hans Christian Andersen.\n\nThe remake opens with a quote from the author of the original fairy tale upon which Disney's adaptations are based.\n\n\"But a mermaid has no tears, and therefore she suffers so much more.\"\n\nDuring the movie's virtual press conference, attended by Insider, director Rob Marshall explained why he chose to use the quote in the remake.\n\n\"We were immediately aware of how this was a very contemporary story already in the 1830s about a girl who feels displaced,\" Marshall said in response to a question from The Direct. \"To be able to find something from Hans Christian Anderson specifically so we sort of ground this in where it came from was important to find something from him.\"\n\nMarshall added: \"It's the most sort of famous quote from the tale. And I have to say because I think we were bringing more depth and emotion, which you can in a live-action piece, that's what this genre helps you do. The idea that because a mermaid has no tears, and she feels more, she suffers more, it felt to us like it set the table for this more emotional telling of the story.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAriel is aged up to 18 in the remake.\n\nIn the animated film, Ariel's 16, something which made her quick marriage to Eric within a few days of meeting him cringeworthy.\n\nDisney's production notes for the live-action film note that Ariel's a \"spirited 18-year-old.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new film doesn't contain a big concert number led by Sebastian.\n\nThe animated feature kicked off with King Triton's daughters performing to a crowd of merpeople to show off Ariel's vocal talents only for the event to come to a halt when it's discovered the young mermaid skipped out on her royal duty.\n\nThat's scrapped in the new movie.\n\nThe remake doesn't contain a large event hosted at the palace.\n\nThis time, Ariel ditches a rather boring gathering between her father and her sisters.\n\nIn the 2023 film, Ariel's sisters have different names and are vaguely introduced as representatives of the ocean instead of a gaggle of giggling and gossiping sisters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKing Triton doesn't live in an opulent, gold castle.\n\nThe iconic castle from the animated movie doesn't exist in the 2023 movie.\n\nTriton's throne room appears to be in the middle of the ocean, unprotected, in the remake.\n\nAccording to the production notes, the underwater kingdom was designed \"with a deep, strong, jewel-tone-like color palette inspired by real corals and anemones,\" including oversized corals.\n\nThe design is supposed to feel real instead of manmade or futuristic, but it's barely glimpsed on-screen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAriel's mother was killed by humans.\n\nThe remake glosses over this new revelation.\n\nThe death of King Triton's wife was a main plot point further explored in Disney's straight-to-video 2008 prequel, \"The Little Mermaid III: Ariel's Beginning.\"\n\nShe died saving a young mermaid and trying to grab a trinket given to her by Triton.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUrsula is King Triton's sister and Ariel's aunt.\n\nA plot line teased in a deleted scene from the original, the remake introduces Ursula as King Triton's exiled sister but never dives deeper into what soiled their relationship.\n\nThough we know Ursula was banished from the kingdom years ago, it's unclear what forced her into exile.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe remake includes three new songs.\n\nOriginal \"The Little Mermaid\" composer and lyricist Alan Menken returned for the remake and was joined by Lin-Manuel Miranda (\"Hamilton\").\n\nTogether, the two wrote three new songs along with a reprisal to \"Part of Your World.\"\n\nHere, Prince Eric gets his own song, \"Wild Uncharted Waters,\" and Sebastian and Scuttle get their own rap, \"Scuttlebutt.\"\n\nThe best addition is a new number for Ariel, \"For the First Time,\" sang cleverly in her head after losing her voice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScuttle is a northern gannet instead of a seagull.\n\nInstead of the mermaid breaking the surface to show off her treasure trove of human findings to her squawking friend, Scuttle's now a diving bird who meets Ariel underwater to maintain their friendship.\n\nIn the remake, Ariel abides by her father by never going above water until curiosity gets the best of her when she notices fireworks coming from Eric's ship.\n\nOnly then does she break her father's rule to get a glimpse of humans and, subsequently, save the prince's life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAriel doesn't sign a contract with Ursula. Instead, she forges a blood-binding one.\n\nWhen Ariel agreed to give her voice to Ursula in exchange for legs, she sealed the deal with a signed contract.\n\nThis led to many Disney fans wondering why Ariel simply didn't write messages to Eric to let her know of her ordeal.\n\nThe 2023 remake rids of this potential plot hole.\n\nInstead of signing any paperwork, Ariel rips off one of her scales and gives it to her aunt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUrsula's memorable \"body language\" line is removed from \"Poor Unfortunate Souls.\"\n\nThere are a few minor lyrical tweaks to \"Under the Sea\" and \"Kiss the Girl,\" but the most obvious omission is the removal of Ursula singing and gyrating to the memorable \"body language\" line from \"Poor Unfortunate Souls.\"\n\nIn the animated feature, Ursula sings the lyric when Ariel asks how she's supposed to charm Eric into falling in love with her without her voice.\n\nThe full lyrics from the omitted line are: \"You'll have your looks, your pretty face. / And don't underestimate the importance of body language, ha!\"\n\nLongtime Disney and \"The Little Mermaid\" composer Alan Menken told Vanity Fair in March revisions were made in the song \"regarding lines that might make young girls somehow feel that they shouldn't speak out of turn, even though Ursula is clearly manipulating Ariel to give up her voice.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUrsula makes a slight change to her deal with Ariel, without the princess' knowledge.\n\nIn the new movie, Ursula refines her spell so Ariel can't remember she needs to kiss Eric in order to remain human and regain her voice.\n\nAt a surface level, this seems like a silly addition, but it's a pretty clever update.\n\nInstead of Ariel obsessing over getting a kiss from the object of her affection, she's now encouraged to get to know the man she saved and potentially fall in love with him naturally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEric isn't a natural-born prince. He was adopted by a queen in the remake.\n\nThe assumption in the animated movie is that Eric was born into royalty.\n\nIn the 1989 movie, Eric's pressured to find a wife. On his birthday, he briefly apologizes he didn't fall for the Princess of Glowerhaven.\n\nA deadly shipwreck brought Eric ashore in the 2023 movie where he was adopted by Queen Seline (Noma Dumezweni).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSebastian isn't chased around the castle by a chef.\n\nOnce on land, Sebastian has an entire subplot where the castle chef is trying to cook him.\n\nThis storyline's ditched in the new film.\n\nNow, Sebastian focuses his full attention on trying to get Ariel to break the spell since she can't recall she needs to kiss Eric.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAriel tells Eric her name, not Sebastian.\n\nIn the animated movie, Sebastian whispers Ariel's name to Eric during the song \"Kiss the Girl.\"\n\nThis time around, Ariel tells Eric her name by pointing to the constellation Aries and then guiding him from there.\n\nIn the remake, Eric says that's a beautiful name, steps up from the animated film in which he says, \"That's kind of pretty.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAriel and Eric don't receive a lavish wedding.\n\nThe animated film culminates with Ariel and Eric's wedding aboard a ship as it sails off.\n\nKing Triton, Ariel's sisters, and other merpeople break the ocean's surface in a send-off.\n\nThe remake oddly skips over Ariel and Eric's wedding and vaguely mentions the two wed off-screen.\n\nThe two get in a paddleboat and receive a similar goodbye from Triton.\n\nWhen you buy through our links, Insider may earn an affiliate commission.
