        "text": "Ancient heritage\n\nAlthough there are at least two possible sources for the origin of the MacManus, or McManus, name and although both these sources lie far beyond the Emerald Isle itself, bearers of the name today are nevertheless descendants of a truly native Irish clan.\n\nThe Gaelic-Irish forms of the name are Mac Maghnuis and Mac Manus, indicating descent from ‘Manus’.\n\n‘Manus’, or ‘Magnus’, signifies ‘great’ and may possibly refer to either Charles the Great, better known as the ninth century Holy Roman Emperor Charlemagne or the tenth century King Magnus of Norway.\n\nIt was through their fame that the name of ‘Manus’ or ‘Magnus’ became popular far beyond the boundaries of their own respective territories, and it is therefore no surprise that powerful Irish chieftains may have adopted the name in a bid for reflected glory.\n\nThis appears to have been the case with what became the McManuses/MacManuses – two separate septs of whom were to be found in the ancient western province of Connacht and the northern province of Ulster.\n\nBut intermarriage between the septs means that bearers of the name today, whether their origins are Connacht or Ulster, share the same rich heritage and traditions.\n\nThis is a heritage closely bound to the vibrant drama that is Ireland’s history.\n\nThe two septs were those of McManus-Maguire and McManus-O’Connor, with the McManus-Maguire flourishing for centuries in Ulster and the McManus-O’Connor flourishing in Connacht.\n\nWith strong bonds to the powerful Maguires and the Royal House of O’Connor, the McManuses were destined to share in both their glorious fortunes and tragic misfortunes.\n\nThe McManus-Maguires take their name from Manus Maguire, a late thirteenth and early fourteenth century Ulster king.\n\nA son of the Maguire chieftain Don Mór Maguire, he was born in Lisnaskea, in what is now the Northern Irish county of Fermanagh.\n\nThe first mention of the Maguires in the historical annals of Ireland goes back to about the middle of the tenth century, and the clan is thought to have first arrived in Ulster from the present day county of Westmeath, in the province of Leinster.\n\nThis means that in all probability they had formed part of the mighty invasion force from the south that wrested control of Ulster from the rival tribal grouping known as the Ulaid.\n\nThis laid the foundations of the Ulster kingdom known as Airghialla, or Oirghialla, anglicised as Oriel.\n\nSo great was the Maguire hold on Fermanagh from the thirteenth to the seventeenth centuries that the county was actually known as Maguire’s Country.\n\nSeparate septs, or branches, of the Maguires were scattered throughout Fermanagh, but it was the imposing summit of Cuilcagh, on the borders of Fermanagh and Co. Cavan, that was the site of the solemn inauguration ceremonies of the Maguire chieftains, in addition to a site known as Sciath Gabhra, near Lisknaskea.\n\nManus Maguire and what became the sept of McManus in Ulster came to be established at Knockninny, on the southern shore of the beautiful Upper Lough Erne, and it was from here that they held sway as a proud clan in their own right.\n\nIn Connacht, the McManuses traced a descent from Connor, a late tenth century king of the province.\n\nOne of his descendants was the famed Turlough Mór O’Connor, the 48th king of Connacht and also Ard Rí of the island in the mid twelfth century.\n\nOne of his sons was Manus O’Connor, lord of what was known as Tír Tuathail and which now forms the parish of Kilronan in the northern reaches of modern day Co. Roscommon.\n\nIt was his sons who adopted the surname McManus, signifying ‘son of Manus’.\n\nAlong with other clans that include the O’Connors, O’Flanagans and McDermotts, the McManuses are also an offshoot of what was the powerful confederation of clans known as the Uí Neill – who trace a descent from the great late fourth century warrior king Niall of the Nine Hostages.\n\nThe sub-branch of the Uí Neill to which the McManuses belonged was known as the Síol Muireadhaigh, with the O’Connors being the most dominant clan.\n\nIn addition to their dominance as sub-kings of Connacht, they not only acted for a time as the Ard Rí of Ireland as a whole, but also in effect represented the last of the ancient institution.\n\nOne of the most celebrated of these Ard Rí was the McManus ancestor Turlough Mór O’Connor, who boasted no less than twenty children through three marriages, in addition to the building of a number of bridges and castles throughout his vast domains.\n\nIt was one of his many sons, Rory O’Connor, who was destined to play a formative and ultimately tragic role in one of the most important episodes in his nation’s history after taking over the mantle of the High Kingship following his father’s death in 1156.\n\nThis was an episode in which the McManuses, because of their bond with the O’Connors, would become fatally embroiled.\n\nTwelfth century Ireland was far from being a unified nation, split up as it was into territories ruled over by squabbling chieftains who ruled as kings in their own right – and this inter-clan rivalry worked to the advantage of the invaders.\n\nIn a series of bloody conflicts one chieftain, or king, would occasionally gain the upper hand over his rivals, and by 1156 the most powerful was Muirchertach MacLochlainn, king of the O’Neills.\n\nHe was opposed by the equally powerful Rory O’Connor, but increased his power and influence by allying himself with Dermot MacMurrough, King of Leinster.\n\nMacLochlainn and MacMurrough were aware that the main key to the kingdom of Ireland was the thriving trading port of Dublin that had been established by invading Vikings, or Ostmen, in 852 A.D.\n\nTheir combined forces took Dublin, but when MacLochlainn died the Dubliners rose up in revolt and overthrew the unpopular MacMurrough.\n\nA triumphant Rory O’Connor, and his allies that included the McManuses, now entered Dublin and he was later inaugurated as Ard Rí – but MacMurrough refused to accept defeat.\n\nHe appealed for help from England’s Henry II in unseating O’Connor, an act that was to radically affect the future course of not only the fortunes of the McManuses but their fellow Gaelic-Irish as a whole.\n\nInvasion and rebellion\n\nHenry II agreed to help MacMurrough, but distanced himself from direct action by delegating his Norman subjects in Wales with the task.\n\nThese ambitious and battle-hardened barons and knights had first settled in Wales following the Norman Conquest of England in 1066 and, with an eye on rich booty, plunder and lands, were only too eager to obey their sovereign’s wishes and furnish MacMurrough with aid.\n\nMacMurrough crossed the Irish Sea to Bristol, where he rallied barons such as Robert Fitzstephen and Maurice Fitzgerald to his cause, along with Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Pembroke.\n\nAs an inducement to de Clare, MacMurrough offered him the hand of his beautiful young daughter, Aife, in marriage, with the further sweetener to the deal that he would take over the province of Leinster on MacMurrough’s death.\n\nThe mighty Norman war machine soon moved into action, and so fierce and disciplined was their onslaught on the forces of Rory O’Connor and his allies that by 1171 they had re-captured Dublin, in the name of MacMurrough, and other strategically important territories.\n\nHenry II now began to take cold feet over the venture, realising that he may have created a rival in the form of a separate Norman kingdom in Ireland.\n\nAccordingly, he landed on the island, near Waterford, at the head of a large army with the aim of curbing the power of his Cambro-Norman barons.\n\nBut protracted war was averted when they submitted to the royal will, promising homage and allegiance in return for holding the territories they had conquered in the king’s name.\n\nHenry also received the submission and homage of many of the Irish chieftains, tired as they were with internecine warfare and also perhaps realising that as long as they were rivals and not united they were no match for the powerful forces the English Crown could muster.\n\nEnglish dominion over Ireland was ratified through the Treaty of Windsor of 1175, under the terms of which Rory O’Connor, for example, was only allowed to rule territory unoccupied by the Normans in the role of a vassal of the king.\n\nThis humiliation appears to have been too much for the proud O’Connor to bear, for he abdicated his kingship and took himself off to monastic seclusion.\n\nHe died in 1198, the last in a line of no less than eleven O’Connor High Kings of Ireland.\n\nThe island in effect became a fiefdom of the English Crown, as further waves of ambitious Anglo-Normans descended on it, wresting land from the native Irish.\n\nIt was a blueprint for frequent bloody rebellion, and The Annals of the Four Masters contain several entries indicating how the McManuses, for example, were to be found among the ranks of the rebels.\n\nOne entry for 1249 states how a Brian An Doire MacManus, son of Manus O’Connor, was ‘killed fighting against the English.’\n\nRebellion became endemic throughout the island and, in a bid to quash it, the authorities attempted to eradicate the ancient Gaelic-Irish institution known as Brehon Law – most notably and brutally in the McManus homeland of Connacht.\n\n‘Brehon’ was the name for Ireland’s earliest hereditary lawmakers and judges, stemming from the Gaelic-Irish breitheamh, meaning a judge, and the brehons were responsible for interpreting and dispensing justice based on a series of statutes that governed every aspect of daily life.\n\nAlso known as the Fenachas, or Law of the Feni, or Freemen of Ireland, these laws were first written down during what is known as the Old Irish period of 600 to 900 A.D.\n\nThe laws show that Ireland was very far from being the backward and uncivilised nation so often depicted by its detractors.\n\nUnder the law known as Cáin Adomnáin, for example, first drawn up in 697 A.D., Irish women enjoyed a better status than that accorded any other women in Europe, with the right to seek divorce from abusive husbands and the right to hold their own property.\n\nThe attempt to bring the native Irish into line with English custom and practice by eradicating institutions such as Brehon Law had terrible consequences.\n\nUnder Sir Richard Bingham, for example, who was appointed Governor of Connacht in 1584, innocent men, women and children were hanged at will in a campaign of terror.\n\nOne of its many victims was Turlough Oge MacManus who, sentenced to be hanged, was granted a pardon at the last moment by the Crown authorities in Dublin. But this was simply ignored and MacManus duly hanged.\n\nDiscontent had grown on the island over the policy known as ‘plantation’, or settlement of loyal Protestants on lands previously held by the native Irish.\n\nThis policy had started during the reign from 1491 to 1547 of Henry VIII, whose Reformation effectively outlawed the established Roman Catholic faith throughout his dominions.\n\nThe policy continued throughout the subsequent reigns of Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, and in the aftermath of the murderous Cromwellian invasion of the island in 1649 – one that led to even further harsh conditions being imposed on the Gaelic-Irish such as the McManuses.\n\nAn edict was issued stating that any native Irish found east of the River Shannon after May 1, 1654, faced either summary execution or transportation to the West Indies.\n\nThe final death knell of the ancient Gaelic order of clans such as the McManuses was sounded in 1688 in what is known as Cogadh an Dá Rí, or the War of the Two Kings.\n\nAlso known as the Williamite War in Ireland, it was sparked off when the Stuart monarch James II, under threat from powerful factions who feared a return to the dominance of Roman Catholicism under his rule, fled into French exile.\n\nThe Protestant William of Orange and his wife Mary were invited to take up the thrones of Scotland, Ireland and England – but James had significant Catholic support in Ireland.\n\nHis supporters were known as Jacobites, and among them were the McManuses of both Connacht and Ulster.\n\nFollowing the arrival in England of William and Mary from Holland, Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell and James’s Lord Deputy in Ireland, assembled an army loyal to the Stuart cause, and McManus names can be found on the muster roll for this army.\n\nThe aim was to garrison and fortify the island in the name of James and quell any resistance.\n\nLondonderry, or Derry, proved loyal to the cause of William of Orange, or William III as he had become, and managed to hold out against a siege that was not lifted until July 28, 1689, the starving citizens having been reduced to eating rats.\n\nJames, with the support of 10,000 troops, supplies and money supplied by Louis XIV of France, had sailed from Brest and landed at Kinsale in March of 1689 and joined forces with his Irish supporters.\n\nMarching to Dublin and gathering more Jacobite support along the way, he set up a Parliament in the city.\n\nWilliam, meanwhile, despatched the veteran Dutch soldier Marshall Schomburg to Ireland with a 10,000-strong force that landed in Belfast Lough and occupied Carrickfergus.\n\nThe next few months continued in a state of stalemate, with William’s forces in the north and the bulk of the Jacobites in the south. Seeking to break the deadlock, William himself descended on the island in June of 1690 with an additional 35,000 troops and set off for Dublin.\n\nThe Jacobites marched north to meet him and the two forces finally clashed on the morning of July 12, 1690, in the battle of the Boyne – William narrowly escaping death before the battle proper began when a sniper’s bullet grazed his shoulder while he was breakfasting on the north bank of the Boyne river.\n\nThe Jacobites were routed, and McManuses were among their many dead.\n\nJames fled again into French exile, never to return, while another significant Jacobite defeat occurred in July of 1691 at the battle of Aughrim – with about half their army killed on the field, wounded, or taken prisoner.\n\nThe Williamite forces besieged Limerick and the Jacobites were forced to surrender in September of 1691.\n\nA peace treaty known as the Treaty of Limerick followed, under which those willing to swear an oath of loyalty to William were allowed to remain in their native land.\n\nThose reluctant to do so, including many native Irish such as the McManuses, chose foreign exile – their ancient homelands lost to them forever."
