As an Irish name this is found mainly in Roscommon and Fermanagh and is connected with the O'Connors or the Maguires; in Scotland it is connected with the Colquhouns.\n\nMackessy : from Ó Macasa ‘descendant of Macas’ a personal name of uncertain origin. Woulfe thinks it is a variant of Maghnus; see McManus.\n\nManis : 1: Scottish and Irish: variant of McManus. See also Magnus. This form of the surname is rare in Britain and Ireland and is found mainly in Northumberland England.2: Greek: from the personal name Manis a pet form of Manolis.3: Czech (Mániš): from a pet form of the personal name Emanuel.4: Czech (Maniš): derivative of German Mann ‘man’ (see Mann) or of a short form of a German personal name such as Manfred.5: French or Breton: unexplained. In France it is found mainly in Brittany (Finistère).6: Jewish (eastern Ashkenazic): from the Yiddish personal name Mane + the possessive suffix -s. As a male name this is a variant of Man 9. As a female name it is derived from a form of Mary (see Maria) borrowed from Slavic Christians.\n\nMannis : 1: Irish: shortened and altered form of McManus. There may have been confusion with Minnis.2: Jewish: variant of Manis.\n\nManous : Probably a shortened and altered form of Irish McManus.\n\nManus : Irish and Scottish: shortened form of McManus. This form of the surname is rare in Britain and Ireland.\n\nMayne : 1: English: variant of Main.2: English: habitational name from Broadmayne (Dorset).

The name has been mis-spelled as though it were a patronymic in Mac-.\n\nMcMains : Irish (northern): variant of McManus.\n\nMcManis : Irish: variant of McManus.\n\nMcManners : very likely a spelling in England of Irish McManus.\n\nMcMannis : Irish: variant of McManus.\n\nMcManns : from Mac Maghnuis see McManus.\n\nMcMannus : from Mac Maghnuis see McManus.\n\nMcMonies : from Mac Maghnuis or Mac Maghnusa see McManus.\n\nMcMonnies : from Mac Maghnuis or Mac Maghnusa see McManus.\n\nMenzies : Scottish: variant of Manners in which the z was originally the Middle English letter ʒ (yogh) representing a sound similar to modern English y. The surname is pronounced Meenyus or Minyas in Scotland. The name was brought to Scotland in the 12th or 13th century by a family of Norman knights. It appears that the name was re-interpreted in Gaelic as containing a personal name and for variants ending -s there is a possibility of confusion with McManus. See also McMinn.\n\nMore\n\nSource : DAFN2 : Dictionary of American Family Names 2nd edition, ©2022 by Patrick Hanks and Oxford University Press\n\nFANBI : The Oxford Dictionary if Family Names in Britain and Ireland, ©2016, University of the West of England\n\nFANBI : The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Family Names in Britain, ©2021, University of the West of England"
