        "text": "McManus History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nIreland\n\nThere are many Irish surnames being used today in forms that are quite different than their original, ancient forms. McManus originally appeared in Gaelic as Mac Maghnuis, which means son of Manus. The personal name Manus, imported into Ireland by the Norse, is ultimately derived from the Latin forename Magnus.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the McManus family\n\nThe surname McManus was first found in County Roscommon (Irish: Ros Comáin) located in central Ireland in the province of Connacht, where they held a family seat from ancient times.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the McManus family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our McManus research. Another 87 words (6 lines of text) covering the years 1172 and 1181 are included under the topic Early McManus History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nMcManus Spelling Variations\n\nNames from the Middle Ages demonstrate many spelling variations. This is because the recording scribe or church official often decided as to how a person's name was spelt and in what language. Research into the name McManus revealed many variations, including MacManus, MacManners, McManus, Manus and others.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the McManus family\n\nProminent amongst the family at this time was\n\nTerrence McManus, who was firstly sentenced to death and escaped and settled in the New World\n\nMcManus Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name McManus is the 1,478th most popular surname with an estimated 19,896 people with that name. 1 However, in the United Kingdom, the name McManus is ranked the 889th most popular surname with an estimated 7,711 people with that name. 2\n\nLoading...\n\nMcManus migration to the United States +\n\nThousands of Irish families left for North American shores in the 19th century. These people were searching for a life unencumbered with poverty, hunger, and racial discrimination. Many arrived to eventually find such conditions, but many others simply did not arrive: victims of the diseased, overcrowded ships in which they traveled to the New World. Those who lived to see North American shores were instrumental in the development of the growing nations of Canada and the United States.
