However, since my return from Dublin in 2007 looking up more genealogical connections for the Mulvany family I have been unable to contact him. His email address I have is <annegreto@debitel.net>. I have a letter from him dated Jan 2003 but am unable to read his hand written address which has changed from the previous one. It appears to be Bert??????. 18, 50999 Koln. Would anyone be able to supply me with his email address or home address or would you be able to contact him and ask him to get in contact with me? I am related to William Mulvany through my great grandfather Thomas John Mulvany and for the past 10 years have been following up leads on various family members who were resident in Dublin. John was a great help to me taking me around the various sites in Germany where the Mulvany brothers lived and worked.
