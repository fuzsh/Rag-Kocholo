        "text": "Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt hereditary surnames. Many of these names were devised during the reign of Brian Boru, the High King of Ireland who fell defending Ireland from the Vikings at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014 BCE.\n\n50 Most Common Irish Surnames\n\nMany of these early Irish surnames began as patronyms to identify a son separately from his father or a grandson from his grandfather. This is why it is very common to see prefixes attached to Irish surnames. Mac, sometimes written Mc, is the Gaelic word for \"son\" and was attached to the father's name or trade. Ó is an ancient Gaelic word, signifying \"grandson\" when attached to a grandfather's name or trade.\n\nThe apostrophe that usually follows the O actually comes from a misunderstanding by English-speaking clerks in Elizabethan time, who interpreted it as a form of the word \"of.\" Another common Irish prefix, Fitz, derives from the French word fils, also meaning \"son.\"\n\nBrennan\n\nThis Irish family was very widespread, settling in Fermanagh, Galway, Kerry, Kilkenny, and Westmeath. The Brennan surname in Ireland is now mostly found in County Sligo and the province of Leinster.\n\nBrown or Browne\n\nCommon in both England and Ireland, the Irish Brown families are most commonly found in the province of Connacht (specifically Galway and Mayo), as well as Kerry.\n\nBoyle\n\nThe O Boyles were chieftains in Donegal, ruling west Ulster with the O Donnells and the O Doughertys. Boyle descendants can also be found in Kildare and Offaly.\n\nBurke\n\nThe Norman last name Burke originated from the borough of Caen in Normandy (de burg means \"of the borough\"). The Burkes have been in Ireland since the 12th century, settling mainly in the province of Connacht.\n\nByrne\n\nThe O Byrne (Ó Broin) family originally came from Kildare, until the Anglo-Normans arrived and they were driven south to the Wicklow mountains. The Byrne surname is still very common in Wicklow, as well as Dublin and Louth.\n\nCallaghan\n\nThe Callaghans were a powerful family in the province of Munster. Individuals with the Irish surname Callaghan (also spelled Callahan) are most numerous in Clare and Cork.\n\nCampbell\n\nCampbell families are very prevalent in Donegal (most are descended from Scottish mercenary soldiers), as well as in Cavan. Campbell is a descriptive surname meaning \"crooked mouth.\"\n\nCarroll\n\nThe Carroll surname (and variants such as O'Carroll) can be found throughout Ireland, including Armagh, Down, Fermanagh, Kerry, Kilkenny, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan, and Offaly.

The greatest concentrations of Doyles are in Leinster, Roscommon, Wexford, and Wicklow.\n\nDuffy\n\nÓ Dubhthaigh, anglicized to Duffy, comes from an Irish name meaning black or swarthy. Their original homeland was Monaghan, where their surname is still the most common.
