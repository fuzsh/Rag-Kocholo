        "text": "Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt hereditary surnames. Many of these names were devised during the reign of Brian Boru, the High King of Ireland who fell defending Ireland from the Vikings at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014 BCE.\n\n50 Most Common Irish Surnames\n\nMany of these early Irish surnames began as patronyms to identify a son separately from his father or a grandson from his grandfather. This is why it is very common to see prefixes attached to Irish surnames. Mac, sometimes written Mc, is the Gaelic word for \"son\" and was attached to the father's name or trade. Ã“ is an ancient Gaelic word, signifying \"grandson\" when attached to a grandfather's name or trade.\n\nThe apostrophe that usually follows the O actually comes from a misunderstanding by English-speaking clerks in Elizabethan time, who interpreted it as a form of the word \"of.\" Another common Irish prefix, Fitz, derives from the French word fils, also meaning \"son.\"\n\nBrennan\n\nThis Irish family was very widespread, settling in Fermanagh, Galway, Kerry, Kilkenny, and Westmeath. The Brennan surname in Ireland is now mostly found in County Sligo and the province of Leinster.\n\nBrown or Browne\n\nCommon in both England and Ireland, the Irish Brown families are most commonly found in the province of Connacht (specifically Galway and Mayo), as well as Kerry.\n\nBoyle\n\nThe O Boyles were chieftains in Donegal, ruling west Ulster with the O Donnells and the O Doughertys.
