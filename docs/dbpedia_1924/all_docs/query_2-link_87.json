        "text": "McManis History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nIreland\n\nThere are many Irish surnames being used today in forms that are quite different than their original, ancient forms. McManis originally appeared in Gaelic as Mac Maghnuis, which means son of Manus. The personal name Manus, imported into Ireland by the Norse, is ultimately derived from the Latin forename Magnus.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the McManis family\n\nThe surname McManis was first found in County Roscommon (Irish: Ros Com√°in) located in central Ireland in the province of Connacht, where they held a family seat from ancient times.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the McManis family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our McManis research. Another 87 words (6 lines of text) covering the years 1172 and 1181 are included under the topic Early McManis History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nMcManis Spelling Variations\n\nIrish names were rarely spelled consistently in the Middle Ages. Spelling variations of the name McManis dating from that time include MacManus, MacManners, McManus, Manus and others.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the McManis family\n\nMore information is included under the topic Early McManis Notables in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nMcManis Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name McManis is the 11,665th most popular surname with an estimated 2,487 people with that name. 1\n\nLoading...\n\nMcManis migration to the United States +\n\nTo escape the religious and political discrimination they experienced primarily at the hands of the English, thousands of Irish left their homeland in the 19th century. These migrants typically settled in communities throughout the East Coast of North America, but also joined the wagon trains moving out to the Midwest. Ironically, when the American War of Independence began, many Irish settlers took the side of England, and at the war's conclusion moved north to Canada. These United Empire Loyalists, were granted land along the St. Lawrence River and the Niagara Peninsula. Other Irish immigrants settled in Newfoundland, the Ottawa Valley, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. The greatest influx of Irish immigrants, however, came to North America during the Great Potato Famine of the late 1840s. Thousands left Ireland at this time for North America and Australia. Many of those numbers, however, did not live through the long sea passage. These Irish settlers to North America were immediately put to work building railroads, coal mines, bridges, and canals. Irish settlers made an inestimable contribution to the building of the New World. Early North American immigration records have revealed a number of people bearing the Irish name McManis or a variant listed above, including:\n\nMcManis Settlers in United States in the 20th Century\n\nEliza McManis, aged 36, who landed in America, in 1902\n\nMary McManis, aged 17, who immigrated to the United States from Antrim, in 1906\n\nAnnie McManis, aged 45, who settled in America from Derrylester, Ireland, in 1910\n\nRichard McManis, aged 42, who immigrated to America from London, England, in 1919\n\nThomas J. McManis, aged 33, who landed in America, in 1919\n\n... (More are available in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.)\n\nMcManis migration to New Zealand +\n\nEmigration to New Zealand followed in the footsteps of the European explorers, such as Captain Cook (1769-70): first came sealers, whalers, missionaries, and traders. By 1838, the British New Zealand Company had begun buying land from the Maori tribes, and selling it to settlers, and, after the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, many British families set out on the arduous six month journey from Britain to Aotearoa to start a new life. Early immigrants include:\n\nMcManis Settlers in New Zealand in the 19th Century\n\nJohn McManis, aged 19, a farm labourer, who arrived in Auckland, New Zealand aboard the ship \"Maraval\" in 1879\n\nContemporary Notables of the name McManis (post 1700) +\n\nWynton McManis (b. 1994), American football linebacker for the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League (CFL)\n\nSherrick Terravis McManis (b. 1987), American NFL football cornerback\n\nCharles W. McManis (1913-2004), American organbuilder, charter member of the Organ Historical Society\n\nRelated Stories +\n\nCitations +\n\n\"What are the 5,000 Most Common Last Names in the U.S.?\".
