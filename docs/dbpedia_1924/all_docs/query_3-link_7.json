It is considered an anglicized form of the Irish Gaelic name Mac Maghnuis, meaning \"son of Magnus.\" Magnus was a popular personal name in medieval Ireland, derived from the Latin name Magnus, meaning \"great\" or \"mighty.\" The McManus clan originated in County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland. They were known as an influential sept, or extended family group, within the larger O'Rourke clan. The O'Rourkes were rulers of the kingdom of Breifne, which encompassed parts of present-day County Cavan and County Leitrim. Throughout history, the McManus clan played an important role in Irish politics and warfare. They were known for their bravery and skill in battle, often serving as fierce warriors and military commanders. The sept was involved in various conflicts, including the Norman invasion of Ireland and the later struggles against English rule. Over time, many members of the McManus clan migrated to different parts of Ireland and the world, particularly during times of economic hardship such as the Great Famine in the mid-19th century. As a result, the surname McManus can now be found in many countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, among others. Today, individuals with the surname McManus proudly carry on the legacy of their Irish ancestors, celebrating their rich history and cultural heritage.\n\n+ Includes FREE McManus Family Origins Scroll\n\nQuantity\n\nI'm Bóru McManus, the Family Crest Bear and a custodian of Irish heritage who oversees a grand and expansive library of Irish names.
