        "text": "Do you have a Viking surname? Read below to find out if your name originates from this period of Irish history.\n\nThe Vikings famously first arrived in Ireland in 795 AD, going on to establish strongholds in Dublin, Limerick, Cork, and Waterford. They played a prominent role in Irish history, and so there are many Irish surnames that are actually Viking.\n\nThe Vikings and the Irish already living in Ireland didn’t always see eye to eye. As a result, there were many battles, like the Battle of Clontarf in 1014.\n\nThe Irish high king, Brian Boru, fought and successfully defeated a Viking army, which was the catalyst for peace between the Celtic people and the Vikings.\n\nMany Vikings married Irish people, and the two groups soon started to adopt each other’s customs and ideas. This also meant Irish families were adopting Viking names.\n\nSo, where do Viking surnames come from? The naming system used was called patronymics.\n\nThe idea behind this system was that the child of a Viking man and woman would take the first name of the father or sometimes the mother and add ‘son’ to the end of it.\n\nDr. Alexandra Sanmark of the University of the Highlands and Islands goes on to explain further stating, “A famous example from a 13th-century Icelandic saga, describing the Viking Age, is Egil Skallagrimsson, who was the son of a man named Skalla-Grim.”\n\nHowever, today this system is no longer in use in Scandinavian countries except for Iceland.\n\nNow that we have the history part of it out of the way, let’s find out what Irish surnames are actually Viking.\n\nIreland Before You Die’s overview of facts about Irish surnames that are Vikings\n\nThe surname of Broderick originates from the Viking name of ‘Brodir’. It was first recorded in County Carlow and descended from the Irish surname of ‘O’Bruadier’, which meant ‘brother’.\n\nThe Irish surname of ‘O’Loughlin’ literally means Viking. It finds its roots in County Clare and the O’Loughlin family was said to be one of the most powerful Viking families on the Atlantic shore.\n\nThe name O’Rourke comes from the Viking name of ‘Roderick’. In the 11th and 12th centuries, the O’Rourke’s were the Kings of Connacht.\n\nAnother Connacht name is McManus. This derives from the Viking word of ‘Magnus’, which means ‘great’.\n\nThe name of Doyle descends from Danish Vikings. The name means ‘dark foreigner’, referring to the darker hair Danish Vikings had compared to their Norwegian counterparts.\n\n10. Cotter − rebel name from the Rebel County\n\nThis name originates in Cork and translates to “son of Oitir”, derived from the Viking name ‘Ottar’. The name is composed of elements meaning ‘fear’, ‘dread’, and ‘army’ (not intimidating at all).\n\nSome notable people with this name include Andrew Cotter, Edmund Cotter, and Eliza Taylor Cotter.\n\n9. Doyle − 12th most common surname in Ireland\n\nThe name meaning “dark foreigner” came from Danish Vikings. It comes from the old Irish name ‘O Dubhghaill’, meaning “descendants of Dubhghaill”.\n\nThe ‘dark’ reference refers to the hair rather than the skin colour, as the Danish Vikings had dark hair compared to the Norwegian Vikings.\n\nSome famous Doyles you might recognise include Anne Doyle, Roddy Doyle, and Kevin Doyle.\n\nREAD MORE: Have a look at Ireland Before You Die’s article on the top 5 places that were raided by Vikings in Ireland\n\n8. Higgins − our president’s surname\n\nThe surname comes from the Irish word ‘uiginn’, meaning “Viking”. The original name holder was a grandson of Niall, the High King of Tara.\n\nSome famous people with the name include our Irish president Michael D Higgins, Alex Higgins, and Bernado O’Higgins, who founded the Chilean Navy. Also, the main street in Santiago is named Avenida O’Higgins after him.\n\nLEARN MORE about out President with IB4UD’s article on 20 fascinating facts about Michael D. Higgins\n\n7. McManus − another Irish surname that is Viking\n\nThe name McManus comes from the Viking word ‘Magnus’ meaning “great”. The Irish then put their own spin on it by adding ‘Mac’, meaning “son of”.\n\nThe name originated from Connacht in County Roscommon. J.P. McManus, Alan McManus, and Liz McManus are some well-known people with this surname.\n\n6. Hewson − Bono’s real name\n\nThe name Hewson visibly follows the patronymics system with the word “son” at the end of the name.\n\nThe name means “son of little Hugh” and was first recorded in Britain with the Hewson clans, then migrating to Ireland.\n\nThe irony of the most famous person with his name is that many people don’t know it is his name.\n\nThe frontman of U2, Bono. His real name is Paul Hewson. It doesn’t sound as rockstar as Bono, we will admit.\n\n5. O’Rourke − a famous king\n\nNext on our list of Irish surnames that are actually Viking is O’Rourke. This name, which means “son of Ruarc”, is derived from the Viking personal name ‘Roderick’.\n\nThe name ‘Roderick’ means “famous” and is said to come from counties Leitrim and Cavan.\n\nAround the time of the 11th and 12th centuries, the O’Rourke clan were the Kings of Connacht, making them the most powerful family in Ireland.\n\nFamous O’Rourkes you might know include Sean O’Rourke, Derval O’Rourke, and Mary O’Rourke.\n\nLEARN MORE: Keeping with Viking history, check out IB4UD’s article on the 10 facts about the Vikings in Ireland that you probably didn’t know\n\n4. Howard − did you know this Irish surname was actually Viking?\n\nHoward comes from the Viking personal name Haward which includes elements meaning “high” and “guardian”.\n\nAlthough it is more commonly an English surname, it was seen in Gaelic names such as ‘Ó hOghartaigh’ and ‘Ó hIomhair’. Some well-known Howards are Ron Howard, Terence Howard, and Dwight Howard.\n\n3. O’Loughlin − the descendants of the Vikings\n\nThis surname literally means Viking, just like the surname Higgins. The name is derived from the Irish word ‘Lochlann’. The name comes from County Clare on the west coast of Ireland.\n\nThe O’Loughlin family was thought to be the most powerful family on the shores of the Atlantic and Galway Bay in and around the time of the Vikings.\n\nIt is said that the Chief of the O’Loughlins was seated at Craggans in Clare and known as “The King of the Burren”.\n\nAlex O’Loughlin, Jack O’Loughlin, and David O’Loughlin are some of the well-known people who share the surname.\n\n2. McAuliffe − know anyone with this Viking name?\n\nThis surname comes from the old Gaelic name ‘Mac Amhlaoibh’ meaning “relic of gods”, and this name was derived from the Viking personal name ‘Olaf’.\n\nInterestingly, the name is rarely found outside of Munster. The Chief of the McAuliffe clan resided in Castle McAuliffe, near Newmarket in Cork.\n\nFamous McAuliffe’s include Christa McAuliffe, Callan McAuliffe, and Rosemary McAuliffe.\n\n1. Broderick − our last Irish surname that is actually Viking\n\nBroderick was first recorded in County Carlow and is a descendant of the Irish name ‘O’ Bruadeir’, meaning “brother”.\n\nThis name came from the Viking first name ‘Brodir’ and was even the name of a past King of Dublin in the 12th century. Our famous Brodericks are Matthew Broderick, Chris Broderick, and Helen Broderick.\n\nThat concludes our list of Irish surnames that are actually Viking or are Viking-inspired surnames.
