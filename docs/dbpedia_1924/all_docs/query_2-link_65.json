        "text": "This database of Surnames from County Kerry, Ireland in cooperation with Rootsweb.com was updated January 3, 2000.\n\nMy goal for this site is to provide for researchers a list that accumulates in one-location surnames of Irish ancestors found in County Kerry. This list will hopefully provide family historians a starting place for further research and to help you determine if the name you are seeking existed in the southwestern corner of Ireland.\n\nThe database includes certain non-Irish Surnames, such as those of German Palatines* who immigrated to Ireland beginning in the 18th century. Surnames recorded are those of Ireland's Old Gaelic founders (O'CONNOR) and Anglo-Norman names (BLENNERHASSETT) as well as common Irish names (KELLY).\n\nTo those who are particular about documentation, my sources for this broad-based list embrace writings such as \"Irish Palatine Families\" taking information from Henry Z. Jones', \"Irish Palatine Journal\" and \"Palatine Families of Ireland\" citing arrivals to Limerick & Kerry 1709-1720. And Edward MacLysaght's \"More Irish Families\", 1982, [ISBN 0 7165 0126 0] a supplement to his \"Irish Families\". More current information, 1880 AD on, is taken from on-line sites, e-mail and personal correspondence of my family. Given names are not associated with certain surnames. Dates shown for a particular surname are the earliest available per reviewed records.\n\nAs a caveat to all, I have assumed that certain County Kerry Surname information given by individuals is truthful and correct.\n\nThis page will be updated as frequently as possible. Your comments, suggestions and additions are welcomed. Only I am responsible for the content (and errors) herein.\n\nGood Name Hunting to All,\n\nWalter of McELLIGOTT family of\n\nCounty Kerry & Illinois, USA\n\nBox 161\n\nPeotone, IL, USA 60468\n\nAdmin of [email protected]\n\n*Palatine Names\n\nLike the ship of the same name in Whittier's poem, a \"Palatine\" is a person of strength and courage. A Palatine is of German birthright, whom Mother Nature and Man sent reeling among the rocks and reefs of a cruel everyday existence in the Pfalz of the former Holy Roman Empire from 1690 to 1709 A.D. He finally grounded himself on the rocky earth that was Ireland, especially in the Munster Counties of Limerick and Kerry.\n\nNotes for Readers:\n\n\"Norman\" refers here to descendants of individuals who came to England with William the Conqueror or soon after. The term is a corruption of \"North-men\", evoking those Norse (roughly, the Duchy of Normandy (c.900).\n\nMajor Administrative Divisions of Ireland:\n\nThe County system imposed upon Ireland is patterned after the English system of local government. Ireland's 32 counties originated in the 12th Century AD. County boundaries most often corresponded with those of the properties of influential Gaelic Lords. The creation of Wicklow County in 1606 completed the county system in Ireland.\n\nThe four Provinces (major partitions) of Ireland relate to certain historically prominent families: O'Connor (Connaught), Mac Murrough (Leinster), O'Brien (Munster) O'Neill (Ulster). Ages before the 12th Century Norman Invasion, these four royal families struggled to achieve the High Kingship of Ireland. Therefore, the Irish families within the county divisions were submissive to and allied with these provincial kings.\n\nThe Barony was well established in the government land surveys of the 17th Century AD. In the 19th Century, Baronies were broadly used divisions, which are now obsolete. At one time, the 331 baronies were also indicative of the property held by Irish clansmen.\n\nCivil Parishes were extensively used in numerous surveys of Ireland. They are based on the placement of 17th Century Christian and Medieval monastic or church communities. The archetype of the Civil Parish was well entrenched by the mid-19th Century. An 1841 Ireland population of 8,175,124 was in the process of complying with new parish boundaries.\n\nNew parishes were often created by subdividing larger parishes or by withdrawing certain townlands from adjoining parishes. Essentially, the Civil Parish covered the same area as the official Church of Ireland. Whereas the Roman Catholic (RC) Church, still struggling to survive the trauma of The 16th Century Reformation, was adapting to a new structure based on local towns and villages. Civil Parishes often overlay borders of both baronies and counties.\n\nDiocese or ecclesiastical synods were established in 12th Century Ireland. Specifically formed were Cashel (1101 AD), Rathbreasail (1111) and Kells (1152). Armagh, Cashel, Dublin and Tuam were forged as ecclesiastical provinces; each headed by an archbishop and 22 bishops at the head of the same number of diocese.\n\nIn 1834 the dioceses of the Church of Ireland were grouped into 2 provinces, Armagh and Dublin. These diocesan boundaries remain constant to this time, used by both the RC and Anglican Churches. However, they have little, if any relation to barony or county boundaries.\n\nPoor Law Unions were established irrespective of county perimeters. Under the Poor Relief Act of 1838, Ireland was divided into districts, \"unions\", in which local \"rateable\" property owners were made financially responsible for all paupers in their unions. By 1850 Ireland had developed 163 union districts, usually around large market towns. The (Irish) Local Government Act of 1898 adopted the poor law union as the primary administrative division in place of the barony and civil parish. The poor law unions were further divided into 829 registration districts and 3,751 district electoral divisions. Townlands were classified according to these divisions. The aftermath was that baronies and parishes were preserved merely as a mechanism of comparison to pre-1898 records.\n\nProbate Districts, specifically a principal registry and 11 district registries were established in 1858 for the purpose of proving wills and granting administrative authority.\n\nANGLO-IRISH surnames arose in Gaelic Ireland during the 400 years of immigration between the 12th and 13th centuries through 16th century. Marriage to heirs of Irish landowners was the most often followed path to recognition chosen by holders of Anglo-Irish surnames. A brief list of a few of those Anglo-Irish surnames found at some time of their existence in Co. Kerry includes:\n\nASHE (NASH), Latter especially found in Co. Kerry, but former was settled in Cos. Kildare and Meath in the 14th to 17th century.\n\nFERRITER located in Kerry since 16th century, Ballyferriter on Dingle Peninsula named for this family, also owners of Blanket Islands, subsequently abandoned by Irish in 20th century. Pierce Ferriter, gentleman poet lived c.1600 to 1653, when he was killed fighting Cromwell's forces.\n\nGREGORY resided in Kerry briefly before moving on to Co. Galway in 1774. Per Edward MacLysaght, the town of Ballygregory was NOT named after this family.\n\nHAROLD, Gentry located in Dublin, but also spread to Cos. Cork and Kerry.\n\nSTACK, English who were thoroughly gaelicized by 16th century, resided in Ardfert, Tralee.\n\nBooks of Genealogy Interest: Bell, \"Surnames of Ireland\", Good preliminary IRL study, origin of a surname, esp. 16th through 18th Cs.\n\nBlack, \"Surnames of Scotland\", Good start, providing Scot. surname origins beginning with 16th C.\n\nBolton, Charles Knowles, \"Scotch/Irish Pioneers in Ulster and America\" (1911), Classic Scots-Irish history repubbed and available from Barnes and Noble for about $23.\n\nBurke, Eamon, Biographer on the DeBurgh families (any IRL bookstore).\n\nDAUZAT, Albert \"professeur a l'Ecole pratique des Hautes Etudes\" compiled \"Dictionnaire Etymologique Des Noms De Famille et Prenoms De France\" - pub. 1951, Larousse.

While during the Irish civil war of 1922, anti-treaty parties held various buildings in Dublin against the pro-treaty parties (the legal authority) the Fours Courts complex housed the Public Record Office of Ireland (PROI) established in mid-19th century.\n\nThe anti-treaty troops seized the PROI, resulting in its destruction by Irish troops and the burning of a vast collection of public records held there.\n\n(Fours Courts complex was the site of the four Royal Courts of Justice: Chancery, Exchequer, Kings Bench and Common Pleas.) However, contrary to popular belief the records of the General Register Office (GRO) were never housed in the Four Courts. The records survive intact.\n\nNo civil records existed before April 1845 as Civil Registration did not begin until that time. The main genealogical records destroyed in 1922 were the census returns 1821-1851, wills & administrations c1530s to c1900 and Church of Ireland parish registers.\n\nIronically, the Four Courts, did hold, among other things, the Church of Ireland parish registers, sent to Dublin for safety after the Disestablishment of the CofI in the late 19th century. Dublin CofI parish records were apparently exempt from this edict, and those CofI parishes in the hinterland that could prove they had a vault or some other safekeeping method. most of these parish registers would go up in smoke in 1922.\n\nWith thanx to Steven <[email protected]> And Dennis <[email protected]>\n\n(AV: MacL discusses Surname CULLEN in his Forward): \"Another change which has been going on almost to the present day is the absorption of some rare names by better known ones of similar sound....
