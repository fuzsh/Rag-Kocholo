It is from this area that the family descend from Mághnais who was the son of the twelfth-century high King of Ireland,Turlough O’Connor.\n\nThe Name also has early ties to Fermanagh where the MacManus were successful as fishermen and was second in power to the Maguire clan. Today the name is still strong in the Roscommon, Fermanagh and Cavan areas.\n\nOther spelling variations of the name include MacManus, MacManners and Manus among many others."
