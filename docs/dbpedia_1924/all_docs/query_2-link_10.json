        "text": "McManus: What does the surname McManus mean?\n\nThe surname McManus has Irish origins, derived from the Gaelic \"Mac Maghnuis\" which means \"son of Manus\". The name Manus itself is a Gaelic form of the Latin name Magnus, meaning \"great\". Therefore, the surname McManus can be interpreted as \"son of the great one\". The name was likely originally used to identify the son of a chieftain or person of power and importance.\n\nMany McManus families descended from Manus, who was the son of King Domhnall of Tirconnell, a region in the northwest of Ireland. Over time, the family spread throughout the country and the name became common, particularly in the counties of Fermanagh, Monaghan, and Roscommon.\n\nToday, individuals with the surname McManus may be related to this original lineage, or their ancestors could have simply adopted the name. Many Irish people worldwide carry this surname, especially in the United States, Canada, and Australia, due to the Irish diaspora over the past centuries. It remains a recognisable and significant surname in Irish history and culture.\n\nOrder DNA origin analysis\n\nMcManus: Where does the name McManus come from?\n\nThe last name McManus is of Irish origin. It is an Anglicized version of the Gaelic name \"Mac Maghnuis\", which means \"son of Magnus\". The name Magnus has roots in both Old Norse and Latin, in Latin it means \"great\", and in Old Norse, it was a name borne by several Viking kings.\n\nThe McManus surname was first commonly found in County Roscommon, a region in the western part of central Ireland. From there, the name gradually spread out, and now it is common throughout Ireland. However, due to the Irish diaspora, it has spread to many parts of the English-speaking world, including the United States, Canada, and Australia. The surname is particularly common in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nTherefore, individuals bearing the surname McManus can often trace their ancestry back to Ireland, particularly the region of County Roscommon. But the wide dispersion of the surname means there are concentrations of individuals named McManus in many parts of the globe, particularly in countries with a strong history of Irish immigration.\n\nVariations of the surname McManus\n\nThe surname McManus originated from the Irish name \"Mac Maghnuis\" which refers to \"son of Magnus\". Some of the variations of the surname McManus include MacManus, M'Manus, Manus, Maghnuis, and Maughan. These variations are mostly due to the regional dialects and how the name was historically recorded.\n\nThe ways it is spelled are influenced by phonics, transcription, and anglicization throughout history. For instance, the Scottish version of the name sometimes appears as MacManners. There's also MacManamon which is commonly found in some parts of Ireland and considered a variant of McManus. Additionally, the surname O'Manus is considered a variation and derived from the same Gaelic clan in Ireland.\n\nMcManus can be possibly linked with other surnames like Manners or Mannering in England or McInnes in Scotland. However, it is crucial to conduct a thorough genealogical research to validate the links because names can appear similar due to coincidences.\n\nOverall, McManus is a patronymic surname and its variations reflect the rich linguistic and regional diversity of the areas where people with this name have lived.\n\nFamous people with the name McManus\n\nEddie McManus, American Football Player\n\nFrank McManus, Actor\n\nGiuliana Rancic, co-host of E!
