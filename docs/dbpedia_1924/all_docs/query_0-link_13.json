It was not until c1793 that the boundary began its journey to a final NC/SC border.\n\nHe married twice. His first unnamed wife died before 1810 and bore him at least two sons and seven daughters, perhaps more.[1] He married (2) Elizabeth “Betsey” Unknown (c1795-99 SC – aft. 1860) and had two sons and three daus by her. An 1844 legal document pertaining to Lt. Hugh helps in constructing the two families.[2]\n\nDefining Hugh's Father\n\nHe died in 1831 Chesterfield District at a ripe old age, having had children until nearly the end according to historical documents. Capt. James was the first of the surname in the area; thus, even today, any McManus there is likely a descendant. With the first 3 generations, however, it is only certain that James had one son, Thomas (d1793) and likely a second, James, II, Patriot. The rest sons or grandsons. Clues are found in document language such as deeds, wills or other local records.\n\nFor example, a deed for Charles McManus of Lancaster county selling to Joseph Hough of same, a clue is found in a clause that reads: “to have and to hold, sd Joseph Hough, his heirs . . forever . . all the above land and premises and clear from the possession of James McManus son.” Using the term ‘son’ indicates Charles is the son of the Captain. Additionally, mother, Mary McMANUS and Patriots Thomas and James as well as Charles, all received land grants between 1771 and 1774; but not Hugh. Hugh did not obtain property until 1785 on his own suggesting he was younger.\n\nTwo deeds for Hugh have enigmatic clauses referencing relationships to Capt. James McManus. One is for Hugh McManus of Chesterfield county to Joseph Hough of the State of Georgia, but now Lancaster county; the other for James McDonald of Lancaster county to Joseph Hough now of Lancaster county, witnessed by Hugh McManus The clauses respectively read:\n\n“forever defend the aforesaid bargained premises against the lawful claim of all the descendants of Capt. James McManus Dec’d” and “defend and covenant as above only except the family of the McManuses descending from the body of Capt. James McManus, Dec’d.” Whoever the McManus participants were, they were family!\n\nUnlike the clause in the Charles deed, Hugh's connection to Capt. James McManus is left to the imagination. Deeds, maps and plats, together provide sources of ‘relative’ relationship. Capt. James 5000 acres, spread from Brown Creek, Anson Co., NC to McManus Ford crossing Lynches, the southernmost point of his acquisitions in SC.\n\nHugh was a farmer who served in the American Revolution from SC. [3] He always lived in Chesterfield district (originally Cheraws) helping to separate him from others of the same name in Lancaster county. However, he did own contiguous property on both sides of the river. Before the war ended they had four children. By 1796 they had 2 sons and 7 daughters (two twins).[4] It should be noted that not all of the daughters have been identified.\n\nAmerican Revolution\n\nAccording to Alexander Gregg,[5] companies approved for Revolutionary service from St. David’s Parish by Provisional Congress in Sept, Oct and Nov of 1775 were thoroughly and extensively organized. “Along the river from the extreme upper parts of Lynches Creek to the neighborhood of its mouth did the spirit of volunteering extend, the people aroused to the highest pitch of Patriotic ardor.” A contraindication of the enthusiasm for war in the backcountry is; however, reported in World of Toil and Strife, Community Transformation in Backcountry South Carolina 1750-1805 by Peter N. Moore, PhD; from Georgia University; [6]\n\nRecords of Hugh’s service include:\n\nApplication for Use of Mare\n\nNo 220 Book R.\n\nMr. Hugh McManus, his account of a mare for contl use in 1780, & 193 days Militia Duty in 1780-81 as Lieut.

I am Gentleman Yr Moft Humblest (signed) Hugh McMANUS Cheraw District To the Public Treasurer In Charleston - - Signed in the presence of CHAS EVANS I.T. In Cheraw Dist. Camden, Apr. 28, 1785\n\nVoucher for Service from Capt. Charles Evans to Hugh McManus\n\nPost War\n\nCapt. James had acquired over 5000 acres of grants in NC and SC before his 1762 death. A survey shows McMANUS ROAD stretching across the property to “Thomas McManus’ Land surrounded by vacant land. This was part of a 460a tract Thomas inherited from his father.\n\nBetween 1771-1774 Thomas, Mary, Charles and James received grants, but Hugh was probably underage. Hugh McMANNERS' first property consisted of 150a in Cheraw District along the NE side of Lynches Ck., surveyed 29 April 1785, the year he filed for service compensation. On 22 May 1786 he sold the land to James NICHOLSON, perhaps due to lack of a water source. Most all McManus acquisitions were situated for good irrigation. It seems reasonable that a father would assist a son and his family in acquiring good farm land, such as that along a river. No land records exist between Hugh and Capt. James or Lt. Thomas at any time. After 1786, our subject remained silent for the next eight years when Thomas died in 1793.[7] Note his adj. neighbor.\n\nEstate of Thomas McManus 1793\n\nHugh is always recorded in Chesterfield (aka Cheraws District) but, as commonly occurs, known children and census numbers do not always fit. The 1790 census shows Hugh's family as 2-2-8 with one slave, indicating three males in addition to him as head of household. Most important is the second male over 16 very likely a widowed father, Thomas, living with his son. Thomas McMANUS was never documented in a census, yet he was alive in 1790.\n\nBreaking from the census, in the year 1803 we find two separate accounts of criminal indictment for Hugh MAINER/MANER of Lancaster District in the minutes of the General Sessions of Lancaster County. One indictment was for the killing of a bull belonging to another person and the other was for threatening a woman named SHOFNER. Both spelled the name without “Mc” and both suspects lived in Lancaster District. Since the census enumerated Hugh MANER and Hugh MANOR in Lancaster Dist., Lt. Hugh is not a likely suspect. One Hugh McMANUS of Lancaster Dist., SC in 1825 was accused of stealing a silver dollar. There is a man of that name and district born in 1805 also a likely the suspect.\n\n1820 finds Hugh in the 26-45 years category and has a female 16-26 years. This is the year the additional age category 16-18 years was included as group 3. The census taker was confused, as were many of them, and placed males in wrong categories. He put Hugh in group 5 (26-45) when he should have had him in group 6 (>45). The female is likely Elizabeth, his second wife, as there were no older daughters in the 1810 hh. This would also account for the older daus named in the 1844 estate litigation. Also in the hh is a young male and female, both under 10.\n\nThe gradual increase in slaves indicates all censuses are the same family even though the age brackets are not exact.\n\n1830 Chesterfield shows Hugh McMANUS in a hh with 15 total that still includes 8 slaves. The oldest male is 70-80 years and the eldest female is 30-40 which both fit with known information. The children fit well with Pleasant (1 male 5-10), Rebecca and Sarah (2 females <5 years) as known children of Hugh and Elizabeth. One female 5-10 was probably not a minor in 1844 thus not mentioned in the litigation. In addition, a 15-20 year old female may be a dau of the first wife.\n\nThe 1830 alphabetized census occasionally shows a landmark entered next to a name. The name McCASKILL has “Fork Creek” written near it and the McCaskills were known to live in the area of Jefferson and Taxahaw on either side of Lynches Creek where McMANUS FORD was located.\n\n1840 Elizabeth is head of hh living next to her step grandson Richmond. With her are one female 15-20; two females 10-15; one male 5-10 and another young male under 5; certainly not a child of Hugh.\n\n1850 Elizabeth is shown in a hh with 3 young persons: Sarah 22, Samuel 20 and Charlotte WILLIAMS, 21. Son Pleasant is nearby. The relationship of Charlotte Williams is unknown but she is not her daughter who married Starling/Sterling EVANS.\n\n1844 Estate Partition of Hugh McManus\n\nThe 1844 litigation between Pleasant McMANUS and John McMANUS records the name of the second wife, \"Betsy\" and four children. It mentions a previous marriage but doesn't name the wife and the only named child of the first wife was John who is the defendant in the case. However, by referencing a previous 1832 estate record [which has not been located] it alludes to other ch possibly by either or both wives. Excerpts from the document:\n\nThe circumstances of the case are these, The said Hugh McMANUS died in the year 1831, intestate, pofsefsed in fee of a tract of land containing about one thousand and fifty acres more particularly described in the pleadings, whereof from fifteen to twenty acres lay in Lancaster and the residue in Chesterfield District which land was distributable between his widow \"Betsey\", and the following children whom he had by her, to wit, the plaintiff Pleasant McManus, Samuel McManus, Rebecca, wife of Albert STACK and Charlotte wife of Sterling EVANS, and the Defendant John McManus and several other children and ifsue of said intestate by a former marriage.\n\nThe plaintiffs in this case, the children of the second marriage were all infants, the oldest of them, Pleasant McManus, is now only between 22 and 23 years of age, the rest are still minors, ---\n\nThe said John McManus administered on the personal estate of his father ---- From the records of the Court of Common pleas for Chesterfield District it appears that a summons in partition was ifsued by that court, returnable to the fall term of 1832, purporting to be at the instance of the widow and her children, and all the children and ifsue of the intestate's first marriage, except John McManus, (who was made the defendant in the proceedings) requiring the said John to show cause as (to?) the return of said summons, why the said land should not be partitioned.\n\nThere are some peculiarities in this writ, (the 1832 record) which have been remarked upon by ?consent and which it may, therefore, be proper to notice, In stating the names of the distributees, the Christian names of several of them are left blank, but this is not the case, as respects the names of any of the plaintiffs in the present bill.\n\nComments\n\nThis record indirectly lends support to Hugh being a son of Thomas rather than Capt. James McManus. Were Hugh a son of James, he probably would be too old to father children as late as 1822-1830 apparent birth years of Pleasant and Samuel. As a son of Thomas, his birth year could have been 1755/65 which would allow a maturity to serve in the Revolution as well as fit with parenting children until 1830.\n\nIn 1873, Elizabeth sold, for $200, seventy acres of land in Chesterfield County, SC to W. A. EVANS of same: “Beginning at a rock corner on Alford KNIGHT’s line running S.E. to a Stake thence N to a white oak thence N.E. to a pine thence a Strait line back S to the beginning corner.” She signed by her mark and witnesses were B. F. THREATT and Alex ARANT (who, incidentally, is buried at Buck Cemetery where it is believed son Pleasant is buried.)\n\nRobin Vail HOUGH is a McMANUS by lineage and in her family are well-recognized educators in the NC college system. Ms. Hough submitted family group sheets showing the names of Hugh's children sans references. A lineage chart of her research is in the public library at Charlotte. Some of the data on the chart is questionable, possibly added to later by others. There are unconnected males in the area born in the 20 years before and after the turn of the century who could be sons of Hugh.\n\n\"Descendants of William Alford McManus and Sarah Amanda Cook\" was written about 1972 and contains excellent material with which to construct the lineage from Lt. Hugh McMANUS. The chart shows Charles, Hugh and Jonathon as the \"three brothers\" but gives that they came from Ireland, with Hugh being the first in America. After publication further research uncovered the existence of Capt. James McMANUS in Anson Co., NC. Most of the individuals in the manuscript pertain to the descendants of William \"Billie\" McMANUS, son of John H. McMANUS, Sr. They also give that John, son of Hugh, served in the Revolution and does not discuss the man they call Jonathan. John could not have served, he was only 6-12 years old during the war. Altogether, the McManus manuscript provided excellent guidance for additional in depth research of the early SC McManuses and includes McManus data in Revolutionary War, War of 1812, War Between the States, WWI and WWII.\n\nThe author, J. Ferris McMANUS writes that John Sr. is buried \"in an old oak grove about one quarter mile north of the late R. M. Armstrong old home place” and is, in fact, located across Lynches in Chesterfield Co. There are also numerous unmarked graves. Since records available for Capt James indicate he died on the land on which he lived and we knew him to live in this area along the Big Lynches, it is likely that he, Lt. Hugh and other early McManuses are also buried there. John’s and one other initialed marker for “C.M.” are the only extant markers.\n\nChildren Lt. Hugh and his First Wife\n\nJohn H.

Some of the markers at Buck Cem., near Dudley, SC are for Arant and McManus, including one possible for Pleasant.\n\nRebecca McManus by him before he was killed in the civil war. Some of her grandchildren made headlines several times. See G. Raymond McMANUS. Rebecca is buried at Spring Hill Bapt Ch at Tradesville along with Albert.\n\nCharlotte McManus (c1826 Chesterfield Dist., SC - bef 1864 Winn Par., LA) md (1) Sterling Evans (c1824 SC – either Winn Par., LA or 1893 Dennison, TX). He was son of William and Mourning EVANS of Chesterfield Dist., SC. By 1860, Charlotte and Sterling moved to Wheeling PO, Winn Par., LA where they were neighbors with Charlotte’s brother Samuel. The female Charlotte WILLIAMS in the 1850 SC hh of Elizabeth McManus is an unidentified female and remained in SC through 1870 and should not be confused with this wife of Sterling. The name given the wife of ‘Starlin’ EVANS in 1860 LA is \"Charity\" and could be a second wife or a diminutive name for Charlotte. In 1880, Sterling Evans was md to Susan and had 3 ch, the eldest being 17 years suggesting Charlotte died between 1860 and 1863 unless Sterling had a second wife in 1860.\n\nSarah McManuus poss. (c1828 Chesterfield Dist., SC - ). She was not named in the 1844 estate litigation but shows with Elizabeth in 1850 and is a year or so younger than Samuel.

She md (2) John LANG after Samuel's death.\n\nCensus\n\nHe is a neighbor to the above persons of the Phillips plat in 1790 as Hugh McManus with 2m>16; 2m< 16; 8fe and one slave, total 12 plus one slave.[8]The next census [9] is alphabetized and neighbors are not discernible. The family of Hugh McManus shows 02201-00401-04 slaves. In 1810 neighbors [10] are very interesting being Blakeney, Arant, Massey, Hough, Evans, Robeson/Robertson and Funderburk, all persons interacting with McManus for multiple generations. Hugh McManus hh included: 02001-00001-07 slaves. Before 1820 [11] he md Betsy but the two children in the hh are difficult to differentiate between the two wives with Betsy being the eldest but very young female. Hugh shows in his final census [12] with a family showing Hugh McManus 0100000001 (70-80 yrs) - 210101 and 15 slaves.\n\nLancaster County, SC Deeds\n\nDeeds most describe the relationships between Hugh McMANUS and James and Mary (PARKER) McMANUS; his wife, Elizabeth; and his son, John McMANUS. They specifically identify the lands once granted or purchased by Capt. James McMANUS that were inherited by his descendants. Hugh and Elizabeth both signed by their marks, although his Revolutionary War papers show a signature. The deeds also provide some understanding of the complaints and judgments found in the 1844 estate litigation of Pleasant McMANUS vs. John McMANUS.[13]; [14]; [15]; [16]; [17]; [18]\n\nDeath & Legacy\n\nIn 1844 the widow Betsy and their son brought suit [19] against the eldest child of Hugh to obtain what she believed was an equitable partition of her deceased husband's property.
