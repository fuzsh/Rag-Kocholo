Most of the allegations pertain to abuse alleged to have taken place many decades ago; approximately half of those on this list are deceased. It is for the survivors of clergy sexual abuse that we publish this list. We know there has been grave damage done and that this is long overdue. It is the Diocese’s hope that publishing this list will help bring healing to the survivors and their families who have been so grievously harmed. The publication of this list is also an expression of our sincere commitment to transparency and accountability.\n\nCompiling the List\n\nThe Diocese underwent a lengthy process to compile and maintain this list. The first steps involved the collection of 70 plus years of data. This was not clear cut given that files were kept in various locations, were neither digitized nor organized, and included everything from academic records, to vacation requests, to other forms of correspondence. Early on, it was quite clear that, historically, the record-keeping was inadequate and incomplete and that we would not be able to complete our review as quickly as we had hoped. While this review, conducted with the assistance of experts in the field, took longer than first thought, it was essential that we took the time needed to do it right.\n\nExpert Assistance\n\nAn initial evaluation of the files was performed by former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Assistant Director William Gavin of The Gavin Group. After an initial review of the files, the Diocese engaged Kinsale Management Consulting, under the leadership of Kathleen McChesney, Ph.D., former Executive Assistant Director for the FBI and former head of the Office of Child Protection of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. Among other things, Kinsale provides expertise on prevention and response to allegations of abuse of minors and vulnerable adults, and in this case conducted a detailed file review to identify allegations against individual priests.\n\nThe Diocese then engaged the law firm Ropes & Gray LLP to assist it in creating and publishing this list. Ropes & Gray conducted a further investigation and review of Diocesan records and legal files and, at the conclusion of its review, provided a summary of its findings to a core advisory group from the Diocese.\n\nThe Core Advisory Group consisted of:\n\nFr. Richard Wilson, Vicar General\n\nFr. John Murray, Moderator of the Curia\n\nMr. Kevin Kiley, Chancellor\n\nMrs. Lorraine Levy, Director of Professional Standards and Oversight\n\nMr. Michael Carroll, General Counsel and Chief Legal Officer\n\nAfter careful review, the Core Advisory Group presented its findings to The Edward Davis Company to conduct a third-party review (see The Edward Davis Company Review). Led by former Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis, The Edward Davis Company is comprised of a team of former law enforcement officials with deep knowledge of investigations and experience in protecting victims of crime. The Edward Davis Company was given access to clergy files and other relevant information, in order to advise Bishop da Cunha on whether the process (described above) was thorough, fair, and reasonable, to review the placement and category for each name considered for publication, and to present recommendations to Bishop da Cunha. After review and consideration by Bishop da Cunha, the published list reflects those recommendations.\n\nThough the Diocese has taken great care to prepare this list, we understand that this information may still be imperfect. We appreciated the gravity of this effort and did all we could to make the best judgments based on the information available. We are committed to maintaining this list and updating it if and when new information becomes available.\n\nCriteria and Standard of Proof\n\nThe Diocese prepared a standard of review to guide its decisions in preparing this list. It adopted the definitions of “minor” and “sexual abuse of a child” from the Diocesan Policy for Protecting the Faithful.\n\nWhile the Diocese already had a review board in place, in 2020, it updated its policies and reconstituted the review board as the Ministerial Review Board. The purpose of the Ministerial Review Board is to review allegations made against clergy and make recommendations to the Bishop. The Ministerial Review Board includes a retired Senior Executive of the FBI; a Lieutenant Colonel Judge Advocate (Retired) with the United States Marine Corps with experience in sexual abuse matters; a psychologist specializing in child, adolescent and adult trauma and treatment of youth with sexual behavior problems; a licensed social worker; a registered nurse; and others. A complete list of Ministerial Review Board members and their titles can be found here.\n\nWhen making determinations about the evidence presented to the MRB, the Ministerial Review Board Policy provides:\n\n6.5 The Ministerial Review Board will be required to assess the credibility of the allegations, specifically whether the allegation has a “semblance of truth” under canon law, using a standard of proof approximating probable cause, and whether the allegations conform to the definition of sexual abuse of a minor as outlined in the policy developed and adopted by the Diocese of Fall River.\n\nThe Core Advisory Group adopted this same standard of proof in evaluating the credibility of the allegations made against a priest. It found allegations credible when they had “a ‘semblance of truth’ under canon law, using a standard of proof approximating probable cause[.]”\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nThe Diocese has published a “Frequently Asked Questions” document that addresses many of the topics raised, including:\n\nThe commitments of the Diocese pertaining to eradicating and addressing clergy sexual abuse;\n\nSteps the Diocese takes when it receives an allegation of sexual abuse of a minor or vulnerable adult;\n\nReview of Diocesan policies and procedures;\n\nPrevention of child sexual abuse in Diocesan parishes, schools, and ministries;\n\nUnderstanding the Ministerial Review Board and how it functions; and\n\nRemoval of credibly accused priests.\n\nCategories\n\nThe list includes the following three main categories. To access each category, please click the category name or links below.\n\nCredibly Accused:\n\nIncludes priests, seminarians, and other religious against whom an allegation of sexual abuse of a minor was made that meets the semblance of truth standard defined above and who were incardinated in the Diocese of Fall River and/or assigned to public ministry in the Diocese of Fall River. This category is divided into three subcategories: (A) Incardinated in the Diocese of Fall River; (B) Other Diocese; and (C) Religious Order. For those in sub-categories B and C, respectively, the priest was incardinated in another diocese or was a member of a religious order but exercised public ministry in the Diocese of Fall River.\n\nCLICK TO VIEW LIST OF CREDIBLY ACCUSED\n\nPublicly Accused:\n\nIncludes priests, seminarians, or other religious who were either incardinated in the Diocese of Fall River or who were assigned to public ministry in the Diocese of Fall River, and have been publicly named in media reports, third party lists prepared by advocacy groups and/or other dioceses and religious orders, as having allegations against them involving sexual abuse of a minor. The individuals included are clergy or other religious against whom a publicized accusation was made, but for whom the Diocese lacks sufficient information at this time to make its own determination whether the accusation was credible. In some cases, a religious order or other diocese may have determined that the priest was credibly accused after investigation or upon admission of the priest.\n\nIt is important to note that just because a name appears on the publicly accused list, that does not necessarily mean that the individual was accused of abusing a child in the Diocese of Fall River. For example, a priest may have been publicly accused of abuse in another diocese or may appear on a credibly accused list for a religious order for allegations unrelated to the Diocese of Fall River. If we were able to confirm that the priest also worked in the Diocese of Fall River at some point in his career, we have included the priest on the publicly accused list even if the Diocese did not itself receive an allegation regarding that priest.\n\nCLICK TO VIEW LIST OF PUBLICLY ACCUSED\n\nCases in Progress:\n\nIncludes living priests of the Diocese of Fall River who have been publicly accused of sexually abusing a minor, but the canonical and/or civil proceedings involving these priests have not yet been resolved. There has not been a determination either under canon (Church) or civil law regarding whether the allegations against clergy listed in this category are credible. Consistent with the principles of the American justice system and Church law, these individuals are afforded a presumption of innocence. The priests in this section are prohibited from engaging in public ministry while their cases are in process.\n\nCLICK TO VIEW LIST OF CASES IN PROGRESS\n\nNote: This list is provided based on information available at the time it is published. If the need arises to add names to this list based on the criteria explained above, the Diocese will do so.\n\nQuick Links\n\nCredibly Accused\n\nThis category includes priests, seminarians, and other religious against whom an allegation of sexual abuse of a minor was made that meets the semblance of truth standard previously defined and who were incardinated in the Diocese of Fall River and/or assigned to public ministry in the Diocese of Fall River.\n\nThis category is divided into three subcategories:\n\nIncardinated in the Diocese of Fall River\n\nOther Diocese\n\nReligious Order\n\nFor those in sub-categories B and C, respectively, the priest was incardinated in another diocese or was a member of a religious order but exercised public ministry in the Diocese of Fall River.\n\nA. Incardinated in the Diocese of Fall River\n\n1 The name George Avellar appeared on a list of clergy accused of sexual misconduct published by the Bristol County District Attorney in 2002. The Diocese has no record of an individual named George Avellar and believes that the name may be a mistranscription of Jose Avila.\n\n2 While Father Kuhn is a priest incardinated in the Diocese of Fall River, he is a member of the Virginia-based Youth Apostles Institute. As such, after 2004 he ministered outside the Diocese of Fall River, largely in the Virginia area.\n\nB. Other Diocese\n\n1 Seminarian.\n\nC. Religious Order\n\n1 Religious brother.\n\nCases in Progress\n\nThis category includes living priests of the Diocese of Fall River who have been publicly accused of sexually abusing a minor, but the canonical and/or civil proceedings involving these priests have not yet been resolved. There has not yet been a determination either under canon (Church) or civil law regarding whether the allegations against clergy listed here are credible. Consistent with the principles of the American justice system and Church law, these individuals are afforded a presumption of innocence. The priests in this section are prohibited from engaging in public ministry while their cases are in process.\n\nPublicly Accused\n\nThis category includes priests, seminarians, or other religious who were either incardinated in the Diocese of Fall River or who were assigned to public ministry in the Diocese of Fall River, and have been publicly named in media reports, third party lists prepared by advocacy groups and/or other dioceses and religious orders, as having allegations against them involving sexual abuse of a minor. The individuals included are clergy or other religious against whom a publicized accusation was made, but for whom the Diocese lacks sufficient information at this time to make its own determination whether the accusation was credible. In some cases, a religious order or other diocese may have determined that the priest was credibly accused after investigation or upon admission of the priest.\n\nIt is important to note that just because a name appears on the publicly accused list, that does not necessarily mean that the individual was accused of abusing a child in the Diocese of Fall River. For example, a priest may have been publicly accused of abuse in another diocese or may appear on a credibly accused list for a religious order for allegations unrelated to the Diocese of Fall River. If we were able to confirm that the priest also worked in the Diocese of Fall River at some point in his career, we have included the priest on the publicly accused list even if the Diocese did not itself receive an allegation regarding that priest.\n\nNote also that, for priests who were incardinated in another diocese or were members of a religious order, the Diocese often lacked complete information about the priest, including assignment history. However, the Diocese has included assignments within the Diocese of Fall River and other information about the priest, based on the records and information from official sources available to the Diocese.\n\nA Monsignor Albert Berube was publicly accused in 2002, after his death, but the allegations were not substantiated after an investigation. For this reason, he is not included on the publicly accused list; he is mentioned here only to explain this outcome, because the determination that the allegations were unsubstantiated was not previously made public.\n\n** Because certain individuals were not incardinated in the Diocese of Fall River, the Diocese lacked complete information for many of these individuals, including assignment history. That information has been included where it was available from official sources.\n\n1 Fr.

Canon law covers such things as the process of religious service, criteria for baptism, funerals, prohibited conduct, church property, and internal boards which have jurisdiction over Church matters.\n\nCore Advisory Group: A group made up of the Vicar General, Moderator of the Curia, Chancellor, Director of Professional Standards and Oversight, and General Counsel, which advises the Bishop about claims against clergy and seminarians.\n\nCredibly accused: The allegation of sexual abuse of a minor has a “semblance of truth” under canon law, using a standard of proof approximating probable cause, as described in the Ministerial Review Board Policy, Section 6.5.\n\nFaculties: Permission granted to clergy that enables them to practice public ministry within a certain diocese.\n\nIncardination: Term used by the Catholic Church to describe the relationship between a cleric and the diocese or religious order to which he is attached and the superior (e.g., bishop, prelate, religious superior) to which he is accountable and who, in turn, is responsible for him. Clerics must be attached to a particular Church or religious institute.\n\nLaicized: A cleric is dismissed from the clerical state by the Pope, either at the petition of the cleric or at the petition of the diocese, and no longer has the rights and responsibilities of ordination, and is now considered part of the laity.\n\nMinisterial Review Board: As described in the Ministerial Review Board Policy, a local board that functions as a confidential consultative body to the Bishop. The Ministerial Review Board advises the Bishop regarding alleged misconduct by clergy, including misconduct relating to the sexual abuse of a minor or vulnerable adult, and the Bishop’s determination of the suitability for ministry of a member of the clergy. See Ministerial Review Board Policy.\n\nMinor/Child: Anyone under the age of 18 or a person who is at least 18 years old and a student who is in high school and has not reached their 19th birthday. For more information, see Diocesan Policy for Protecting the Faithful, Section 2.11.\n\nOrdination: Process of elevating a lay person to clerical status.\n\nPublicly accused: Priests, seminarians, or other religious who were either incardinated in the Diocese of Fall River or who were assigned to public ministry in the Diocese of Fall River, and have been publicly named in media reports, third party lists prepared by advocacy groups and/or other dioceses and religious orders, as having allegations against them involving sexual abuse of a minor. The individuals included are clergy or other religious against whom a publicized accusation was made, but for whom the Diocese lacks sufficient information at this time to make its own determination whether the accusation was credible. In some cases, a religious order or other diocese may have determined that the priest was credibly accused after investigation or upon admission of the priest. For more information, see FAQs below.\n\nRestricted, Suspended, or Removed from Ministry: Not permitted to practice public ministry\n\nSexual Abuse of a Child: Sexual molestation or sexual exploitation of a child and other behavior by which an adult uses a child as an object of sexual gratification, this includes any act or interaction whether it involves genital or physical contact, with or without consent, even if initiated by the child, which involves sexual contact, molestation or sexual exploitation of a child by an adult, whether physical injuries are sustained or not. For more information, see the Diocesan Policy for Protecting the Faithful, Section 2.4.\n\nUnsubstantiated: The allegation of sexual abuse of a minor does not have a “semblance of truth.” This may mean the allegation was withdrawn or recanted; after an investigation, it was determined the allegation lacked merit; and/or the information was insufficient to assess credibility.\n\nFAQs:\n\nAssembling the List\n\nHow did the Diocese review its files in creating the accused list?\n\nThe Diocese embarked on a comprehensive review of its records beginning in 2019. This review process involved internal examination by Diocesan officials, and experts engaged by the Diocese, including former law enforcement and outside legal counsel. Recommendations were made to the Bishop, who made the final determination regarding the list. For additional information about the process, see here.\n\nDid outside experts review the Diocese’s files?\n\nYes. The Gavin Group, Kinsale Management Consulting, Ropes & Gray, LLP, and Ed Davis, former Boston Police Commissioner, and his team at The Edward Davis Company, were involved in the file review process. For additional information, see here.\n\nHow did the Diocese determine that an allegation of sexual abuse against a minor was “credible”?\n\nThe Diocese applied the definition used in its Ministerial Review Board Policy, section 6.5. Credibility means that the allegation of sexual abuse of a minor has a “semblance of truth” under canon (Church) law, using a standard of proof that approximates probable cause.\n\nWhat is the difference between the credibly accused and publicly accused lists?\n\nBoth the credibly accused and publicly accused lists include priests, seminarians, and other religious who were either incardinated in the Diocese of Fall River or publicly ministered within the Diocese of Fall River. Those on the credibly accused list had allegations made against them which the Diocese was able to determine were credible after its own investigation, because they met the semblance of truth standard previously defined.\n\nAll individuals listed in the publicly accused category have been publicly named in media reports, third party lists prepared by advocacy groups and/or other dioceses and religious orders, as having allegations against them involving sexual abuse of a minor. For those in this category, a publicized accusation was made, but – unlike those in the credibly accused category – the Diocese lacks sufficient information at this time to make its own determination whether the accusation was credible. Note that in some cases, a religious order or other diocese may have determined that the priest was credibly accused after investigation or upon admission of the priest. See also the question and answer immediately below.\n\nIf a priest’s name is on the publicly accused list, does that mean that he is accused of abusing a child in the Diocese of Fall River?\n\nNot necessarily. For example, a priest may have been publicly accused of abuse in another diocese or may appear on a credibly accused list for a religious order for allegations unrelated to the Diocese of Fall River. If we were able to confirm that the priest also worked in the Diocese of Fall River at some point in his career, we have included the priest on the publicly accused list even if the Diocese did not itself receive an allegation regarding that priest.\n\nWhat’s the difference between restricted, suspended, and removed, in the status field?\n\nOver the years, the Diocese has used various terminology when preventing a priest from practicing public ministry. For purposes of the priest’s status, there is no discernible difference between “restricted,” “suspended,” or “removed” from public ministry. In all cases, this means that the priest may not practice public ministry.\n\nWhy are some priests laicized whereas others are restricted, suspended, and/or removed?\n\nThere are many factors the Diocese considers when disciplining a priest for misconduct. The Bishop has the authority to restrict a priest from public ministry. The laicization process can take many years and ultimately goes through the Vatican. The appropriate measure for each individual priest is a fact-intensive inquiry and varies depending on the specific circumstances. In every case, the Diocese is guided by its commitment to protecting children and vulnerable adults from abuse, and to disciplining any Diocesan personnel who commit abuse.\n\nWhy is some assignment history or other information not provided for priests who were incardinated in a diocese other than Fall River or are members of a religious order?\n\nFor priests who were incardinated in another diocese or were members of a religious order, the Diocese often lacked complete information about the priest, including assignment history. However, the Diocese has included assignments within the Diocese of Fall River and other information about the priest, based on the records and information from official sources available to the Diocese.\n\nHandling Abuse Allegations Today\n\nWhat is the Diocese’s process for handling allegations of sexual abuse of minors?\n\nWhen an allegation is received, the Core Advisory Group will conduct a preliminary investigation. Unless such allegation is manifestly false, the Diocese will conduct further investigation and take appropriate steps, such as placing the cleric on administrative leave; preventing the cleric from having any contact with minors, the alleged victim, and the victim’s family; prohibiting the cleric from ministering publicly; and other actions as the Bishop sees fit. The Diocese also reports allegations it receives regarding sexual abuse of minors to law enforcement, and is committed to cooperating with any investigations by law enforcement and civil authorities, in accordance with Massachusetts law. For additional information, see the Diocesan Policy for Protecting the Faithful.\n\nHow do I report an allegation of sexual abuse of a minor by a person affiliated with the Diocese, including clergy, staff, and volunteers?\n\nAnyone may report an incident of abuse to any Diocesan clergy, staff, or volunteer or by contacting the Diocesan Victim Assistance Coordinator, Carolyn Shipp. Note that the Diocese follows mandatory reporting requirements and cooperates with law enforcement and civil authorities, in accordance with Massachusetts law. Further information is also available at the Office of Safe Environment.\n\nKeeping Our Community Safe\n\nWhen were the Diocesan policies about child protection and safety last updated?\n\nIn July 2020. Please see the Diocesan Policy for Protecting the Faithful.\n\nDoes this policy apply to volunteers and staff, as well as clergy?\n\nYes. Please see Section 2.7 of the Diocesan Policy Protecting the Faithful.\n\nWhat is the Ministerial Review Board?\n\nPlease see the glossary definition of Ministerial Review Board (MRB), provided here, as well as the Ministerial Review Board Policy for more information.\n\nIn addition to policies, how does the Diocese prevent sexual abuse of minors?\n\nAs part of its safe environment program, the Diocese requires all personnel to submit to a background check, agree to a code of conduct, and complete Safe Environment Training. The training, which is required of clergy, lay employees, and volunteers, provides awareness and knowledge to ensure a safe environment within the Diocese. The Diocesan Policy for Protecting the Faithful has detailed instructions for Diocesan personnel that receive allegations of abuse. In addition, many Diocesan personnel are mandatory reporters. The Diocese has a dedicated Victim Assistance Coordinator, who must be a licensed social worker or a licensed mental health professional. The Victim Assistance Coordinator is the first point of contact when an allegation is received and works closely with the Bishop to ensure that the Diocese is adequately addressing the rights and needs of any victims. Carolyn Shipp, the Diocesan Victim Assistance Coordinator, can be reached at (508) 985-6508 or at cshipp@dioc-fr.org. The Diocese is also committed to cooperating with law enforcement and civil investigations into abuse, including reporting allegations received to law enforcement.\n\nProcedures After an Allegation\n\nWhat happens to a priest who is accused of sexually abusing a minor?\n\nThe Diocese reports allegations it receives regarding sexual abuse of minors to law enforcement and is committed to cooperating with any investigations by law enforcement and civil authorities in accordance with Massachusetts law. From a Diocesan perspective, the Core Advisory Group first conducts a preliminary investigation into the allegation. If the Core Advisory Group determines that the allegation is not manifestly false, they will advise the Bishop. A more fulsome investigation may then be conducted. While an investigation is pending, the priest will not be allowed to practice public ministry; is prevented from having any contact with minors, the alleged victim and the victim’s family; and is subject to other restrictions as the Bishop sees fit. The results of the investigation will be presented to the Ministerial Review Board for further deliberation on the appropriate course of action. The Ministerial Review Board reviews the allegations, considers evidence, evaluates the validity of allegations, and offers advice and recommendations to the Bishop. The Bishop will then determine the status of the priest.\n\nWhat happens to a seminarian who is accused of sexually abusing a minor?\n\nThe Diocese reports allegations it receives regarding sexual abuse of minors to law enforcement, and is committed to cooperating with any investigations by law enforcement and civil authorities, in accordance with Massachusetts law. From a Diocesan perspective, the Core Advisory Group first conducts a preliminary investigation into the allegation. If the Core Advisory Group determines that the allegation is not manifestly false, they will advise the Bishop. A more fulsome investigation may then be conducted. While an investigation is pending, the Diocesan’s sponsorship of the seminarian as a candidate for the priesthood is suspended. The Bishop will then determine the status of the seminarian.\n\nWhat happens to a layperson (including employees and volunteers) who is accused of sexually abusing a minor?\n\nWhen an allegation is made against a lay employee or volunteer, the Director of Professional Standards and Oversight (the “Director”) will be notified. Law enforcement and civil authorities are also notified. When appropriate, the Director will notify the Director of Human Resources, Pastor or other appropriate supervisor of the employee/volunteer (the “Manager”) who will take appropriate steps. Unless the allegation is manifestly false, the layperson will be placed on administrative leave or terminated, according to the judgment of the Manager. The Manager must take other appropriate steps, in accordance with relevant policies and Massachusetts law. See 5.12 and 5.13 in the Diocesan Policy for Protecting the Faithful.\n\nWhat happens if sexual abuse by a cleric is admitted or established?\n\nIn all circumstances, if sexual abuse is admitted or established, the cleric will be permanently dismissed, and applicable diocesan policy and canonical steps would be taken. See, for example, the Diocesan Policy for Protecting the Faithful.\n\nChild Abuse Prevention Month\n\nEvery April, child and youth serving organizations, including Catholic Dioceses, parishes, and schools, join the national movement to recognize and highlight Child Abuse Prevention. The Diocese of Fall River takes this opportunity to call attention to the importance of protecting children from abuse and to raise awareness that child abuse is preventable. It is our mission, our sacred mission, to remain vigilant in our efforts to protect children in our care in our parishes, schools, programs, and ministries.\n\nDID YOU KNOW…\n\nApril is Child Abuse Prevention Month. Child abuse can occur in every culture, religion, and socio-economic demographic. The vast majority of child abuse occurs at the hands of someone known to the child victim. Those who seek to do harm to children will pursue opportunities that provide access to children and may appear to be helpful and friendly. Our Diocesan policy of the Essential Three requires that all who minister work, or volunteer in the Diocese complete background screening, training and agree to a code of conduct. This is one of the ways we endeavor to educate our parish and school communities and create a culture of child protection.\n\nDID YOU KNOW…\n\nResearch estimates that 1 in 4 girls and 1 in 6 boys will be sexually abused before they reach 18. One of the ways our parish creates a safe environment is by teaching the Circle of Grace curriculum to all enrolled in Faith Formation and Youth Ministry programs and to the students in our Catholic Schools. In an age-appropriate manner, Circle of Grace teaches children and youth personal safety skills including recognizing physical, emotional and spiritual boundaries, identifying trusted adults and taking action if boundary violations occur.\n\nDID YOU KNOW…\n\nAll members of the clergy, Directors of Religious Education and teachers in our schools are Mandated Reporters in Massachusetts and required by law to report any suspected child abuse. Many children will not tell anyone they are being abused. Because the Diocese believes in our moral obligation to protect children, we extend the safe environment training to all who minister, work or volunteer. Watch for signs of abuse and, if you are concerned about a child, share those concerns with a mandated reporter at your parish or school. Let us all be a voice for children who may not be able to speak for themselves.\n\nDID YOU KNOW…\n\nThe Diocese of Fall River stands firm in its commitment to report abuse to law enforcement and cooperate with investigations. If you have been abused by someone representing the Church (priest, deacon, religious, employee or volunteer), we are sorry. We are here to listen and support you. You can report an incident of abuse by contacting local law enforcement directly and by contacting Diocesan Director of Safe Environment and Victim Assistance, Carolyn Shipp at 508-985-6508 (confidential voice mail) or cshipp@dioc-fr.org. She can assist you in making a report and support you through the process.\n\nDID YOU KNOW…\n\nThis June marks the 20th anniversary of the Charter for the Protection of Children and People, commonly referred to as the Dallas Charter. The U.S. Bishops created this Charter in response to the clergy sexual abuse crisis and revised it in 2005, 2011 and 2018. The Charter created a set of procedures for handling allegations of sexual abuse of a minor, whether historical or current. It calls for all allegations to be reported to local law enforcement, zero tolerance for clergy with credible allegations returning to ministry, establishment of outreach and healing services for survivors. Some of the ways the Diocese of Fall River implements the Charter include:"
