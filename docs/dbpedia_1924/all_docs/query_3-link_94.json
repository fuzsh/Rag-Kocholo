Cornelius McManus married (2) Rebecca Norton c1746. Rebecca may have been the daughter of William & Rachel Norton who had children baptized in the Albany Dutch Reform Church in the correct time frame for them to be Rebecca's parents. Cornelius McManus appears on the militia rolls of Albany Co., Capt. Van Veghten's Co. May 1, 1760 as age 39, b. Ireland and in Van Vrankens company. 1 Children: 3*Hugh McManus b. 1747 4*Elizabeth McManus b. 1749 5*Rachel McManus b. 1751 6*Hugh McManus b.c 1753 7*Jemima McManus b. 1756 8*William McManus b. 1758 (3) Hugh McManus,(Cornelius), son of Cornelius and Rebecca (Norton) McManus, was bapt. 14 June 1747 in Albany Dutch Reformed Church; witnesses: John & Nel. Darby. 2 It is possible that the Hugh McManus of Brunswick may have been baptized twice, first in the Dutch Reform Church in 1747 and later on in 1751 at St. Peter's Episcopal Church of Albany so Hugh No. 3 & 6 may be the same person, or a first born Hugh who died young plus another later born Hugh. (4) Elizabeth McManus (Cornelius), dau. of Cornelius and Rebecca (Norton) McManus was bapt. 9 Apr. 1749, Wit: Lochlan Dyl/Elizabeth Norton.3 She may be the Elizabeth McMansion who served as a sponsor along with Johannes Hydorn for Johannes, son of Johannes & Catharina Smit, b. 29 Aug. 1791, bapt. 31 Aug. 4 (5) Rachel McManus (Cornelius), daughter of Cornelius and Rebecca (Norton) McManus, was bapt. 23 June 1753 in St. Peter's Episcopal Church Albany, Albany Co.5 NY. (6) Hugh McManus (Cornelius), son of Cornelius and Rebecca (Norton) McManus, was bapt. 14 Oct. 1753 in Albany, Albany Co., NY 6 Hugh died sometime after 31 Oct. 1825 when he witnessed the will of Nathan Betts of Brunswick.7and before 2 Sept. 1832 the date of his wife's will in which he was not mentioned.8 Hugh married about 1775, (9) Mary, surname unknown, who was born about 1751. Mary died 9 Jul 1834 in Troy, Rensselaer Co., NY and was buried in the family cemetery in Brunswick 10 Jul 1834. Her remains were later removed to Oakwood Cem., Troy, Rensselaer Co., NY. along with other members of the family.9 Mary's funeral was recorded in Register #1, Records of St. John's Episcopal Church, South Troy, NY. This notice states that Mrs. McManus was 83 years old and the funeral was held 10 July 1834 by Rev. H.B. Judah. Corporal Hugh McManus served in Stephen L. Schuyler's Regiment of Albany Militia during the Revolution. His name is shown on a payroll list dated 11 Aug 1777.10 On 5 June 1788 Hugh McManus leased a 180 acre farm in the East Manor of Rensselaerwyck.11 On 24 June 1796 Hugh leased 278 acres of land in the East Manor (now in Town of Brunswick, Rensselaer Co. NY for a yearly rental of 22 bushels buckwheat, 4 fat hens & one day's service.12 Mary McManus sold her 1/2 share of this land to her son William McManus on 16 Jan. 1820.13 and Hugh McManus quit claimed the other half of the property to William McManus on 2 Jan. 1823.14 Mary McManus wrote her Last Will & Testament on 2 Sept. 1832. The document was probated 1 July 1834. Mary left land in Lansingburgh on the south side of Hoosick St. to her three grandchildren- Catherine Watts, William Coonradt & Mary Ann Coonradt. Mary left other assets to her sons Robert P. McManus, William McManus & John McManus. Her granddaughter- Maria Dibble was left some furniture if she ever returned to Troy but if not, this would go to- daughter-in-law Catherine McManus. William Watts, husband of granddaughter Catherine Watts, & grandson John McManus Jr. were also named. The will mentions a mortgage executed by Philip C. McManus. Mary's friend Thomas Read was named executor and the will was witnessed by Caleb Putnam , Solomon Maye & Nathaniel M. Coffin, all of Troy, NY 15 The heirs of Mary McManus are mentioned in a citation dated 31 July 1834. This document is difficult to read but they were John, William & Robert McManus, Catherine Watts of ? in the western part of the state; Mary & William Coonradt of_____Ct.; Maria Dibble of one of the Sandwich Islands .16 On 11 July 1836 William & Catherine Watts of Schroeppel, Oswego Co.

The executors were friends John File & Martin Springer and the witnesses were: A.G. Deavitt & Philip Martin Springer.25 Catherine Watts named in Philip CoonradtÂ’s will. was his daughter by his first wife Mary (McManus) Coonradt. children: 21* Catharina Coonradt b. 26 Sept. 1795 (11) William McManus (Hugh;Cornelius). son of Hugh and Mary () McManus, was born 28 Nov 1780 in Brunswick, Rensselaer Co., NY, and was baptized 8 July 1785.26 William died 18 Jan 1835 in Troy, Rensselaer Co., New York and was buried 20 Jan 1835 in a cemetery on the McManus farm. This cemetery was later excavated and all the bodies were removed to a plot in the Oakwood Cemetery in Troy, Rensselaer Co., NY.27 His funeral was conducted by Rev. H.B. Judah of St John's Episcopal Church in South Troy, NY.28 William married 24 Feb. 1805 in Greenbush, Rensselaer Co., New York, (22) Catherine Coons.29 She was the daughter of Philip and Elizabeth (Wheeler) Coons, who was born 25 Sept. 1784 and bapt. 31 Oct. 30 Catherine died 27 Nov 1839 in Galveston, Texas. 31 William McManus was a prominent lawyer in the Town of Brunswick & City of Troy, New York for many years. He served as justice of the peace, surrogate judge, district attorney and as a member of the House of Representatives in the Congress of the U.S. 1825 to 1827. In addition to his political activities William ran a brick yard, worked as a surveyor and farmed the \"drowned lands\"(wet lands) between the Villages of Eagle Mills & Clum's Corners in the Town of Brunswick.32 William was educated at Lansingburgh Academy and started his legal career in the office of John Bird of Troy, N,Y.33 As a representative to Congress, William McManus put forth a preamble and resolution proposing to amend the United States Constitution by providing on a certain day, the people of the U.S. shall vote directly for president and vice president and that a plurality of votes should constitute a choice.34 William had visited Texas traveling with his daughter Jane & son Robert O. in the years 1833-35. With other partners, they had invested money in land to be used for German colonization. This unfortunate investment was probably a financial disaster for William McManus. Robert O. McManus remained in Texas but William returned to his home in Rensselaer County where he died not long after. 35 On 16 Jan 1820 Mary McManus, wife of Hugh McManus of Brunswick sold her equal half share of their land in Brunswick to William McManus. The land was originally leased from the Patroon Stephen Van Rensselaer on 24 June 1796, This deed also included Mary's land in the City of Troy, Lot 228. William was to pay the yearly rent & pay all taxes on this property.36 On 24 Nov. 1834 Jane E. McManus & Robert O. McManus all of Brunswick, children of William McManus of Brunswick, for the sum of $1.00 sold & quit claimed their rights in 272 acres of land in Brunswick to Philip C. McManus son of William McManus of Brunswick, recorded same day. 37 On 14 May 1814 William McManus was subpoenaed to appear before the Supreme Court on the first Tuesday in July at a circuit court to be held in Troy. William was to testify as to what he knew about a 'cause undetermined' between plaintiff James Jackson & defendant William Swartwout. McManus, on 12 July 1814, received of John Dickinson $3.75 for attending three days as a surveying witness under this subpoena.38 William McManus was a surveyor for the City of Troy during the years 1816- 1819 39 His account book reflects many of his surveying activities in the early 1800s. There were no slaves enumerated in the 1810 Census for William's household40but there are several mentions of an Elijah in William's account book i.e. purchasing pantaloons, trimmings etc. It is very possible that Elijah was a slave. William's daughter Jane was an advocate of slavery in her early years but became anti-slavery later on in her life according to her obit in the New York Tribune (reprinted Troy Times). William McManus died intestate. Estate papers for William at Rensselaer County Surrogate Court consist of documents referring to the dower of his wife Catherine. These papers mention that William & Catherine were married in the winter of 1805. Catherine petitioned for her dower rights on 24 Apr 1839. William had died in 1835 and several witnesses swore to the fact that William had lived with Catherine as his wife for 20 or 30 years. One of the witnesses was their son Philip McManus who was age 30 in May 1835.41 On 10 Sept 1855 Philip McManus of Brunswick petitioned the court for administration of the estate of Catherine McManus who had died about 1 Nov. 1839. Her survivors were the petitioner her eldest son. and two other children not named. This file contains a document signed by Solomon Taylor in which he swore that on 24 Feb. 1805 William McManus esq. of Troy and Miss Catherine Coons of Greenbush in the County of Rensselaer who having agreed on being married, at their request, he had performed the nuptial ceremony.42 Catherine Coons is mentioned as Catherine, wife of William McManus in the will of her father Philip Coons which was dated 11 Aug. 1832 and probated 20 Feb. 1843 The petition for administration of Philip's estate dated 4 Jan. 1843 names, among others, the children of Catherine, deceased daughter, namely Philip McManus of Brunswick, Renss Co.

Jane Clowes is often mentioned in the William McManus account book. She borrowed and repaid money several times from her brother and he from her. William paid a black woman $1.50 to work at her funeral on 12 Apr 1815. He paid his mother Mary McManus $2.00 for Jane's funeral expenses on 17 Apr 1815. Jane McManus Clowes died intestate. On 15 Jan. 1816 Robert P. McManus petitioned the court for administration of her estate. This petition states Jane died without issue on 9 Apr. 1815. The document lists her surviving kin as- Hugh McManus, her father & his wife Mary; John McManus; William McManus; Robert P.McManus, the petitioner, her brothers; Anne Coonradt, wife of Adam H.

McManus sold land on 22 Sept. 1830 to Philip McManus. The land was located in Troy on Hill Street and was sold for $500.54 He apparently removed to Brook- field soon after. There is no probate record for him at Fairfield County Probate Court.

He received a patent on 7 Dec. 1869 for his invention of a potato digger.71 Obituary Troy Times 13 Sept. 1883 - Philip C.W. T. McManus died at his residence on North Second St. yesterday, aged eighty years. Mr. McManus was a graduate of the Rensselaer polytechnic institute, class 1826, the first class graduated from that famous institution. The class numbered ten, and Mr. McManus was supposed to be the oldest living graduate, although Dr. Bennet F. Root of Manchester, Mich. is not yet reported on the register of the institute as dead. It is supposed however, that he is not alive, as nothing has been heard of him for a number of years. Addison Hulburt, another member of the class of 1926, is not yet reported as dead but his place of residence has been unknown for many years and it is supposed that he too, has long since died. Mr. McManus formerly resided in Brunswick on the farm now owned by the Hon. Moses Warren. He was a son of Judge William McManus, who for many years, was a surveyor in the upper portion of the city. Mr. McManus had traveled extensively in this country and Europe, and devoted considerable time to inventions. He leaves a widow and one daughter Mrs. Edwin W. Marvin. He sometime ago offered to bequeath to the young menÂ’s association his scientific works and models, if the association would open its doors Sunday. Otherwise he said he would leave them to the institute. Children: 5 40*Iona McManus b. Apr.1855 (24) Jane Maria Elizabeth McManus, daughter of William and Catherine (Coons) McManus, was born 6 Apr 1807 in Brunswick, Rensselaer Co., NY.72 She died 10 Dec. 1878 at sea.73 She married (1) 22 Aug 1825 in Troy, Rensselaer Co., NY, (41) Allen B. Storm who was born about 1802.74 Allen B. Storm died 27 Nov 1838 in the 36th year of his age, in New York City.75 William McManus & Allen B. Storm, attorneys at law were listed in the 1829-1832 Troy City Directories as lawyers, office located 49 Congress St. Storm was not listed in the 1833 City Directory but William McManus was still at 49 Congress St. Jane had divorced Storm about 1831 according to various unproved sources. The Chancery & Circuit Court records index 1800-1850 was searched for this divorce at the N.Y. State Archives but it was not found In 1825 Jane McManus was a pupil at the Troy Female Seminary along with her cousin Maria Tomlinson. This school eventually became Emma Willard which is in existence today 76 She also married (2) (42) William Leslie Cazneau c1848-1850. He was born in Boston, MA 5 Oct. 1807 and died on the Island of Jamaica 7 Jan. 1876 77 Her father's account book gives several references to Jane during the years 1812- 1816 when she was age 3 to 9.

Wallace, {Coward-McCann Inc., New York, 1957}, Chapter XII entitled The Female of the Species, Page 244-275) and Jane's obituary (Troy Daily Times 2 Jan. 1879, Page 1:4 & 3:3). In 1833, along with the infamous Aaron Burr, his wife Madame Eliza Jumel, Jane's father William & brother Robert O. as her partners. she invested money in a scheme to settle German colonists in Texas. There is a historical marker at Matagorda, Texas at the Site of Dream Colony, City Park, commemorating this German Colony.78 At this time Jane met William Leslie Cazneau from Boston. whom she married c1848-1850, and supposedly converted to Catholicism. The colonization venture failed and Jane & her father returned east but Robert O. McManus remained in Texas where he married and raised a family. . Jane Storm worked as a newspaper reporter on the New York Sun. She carried on a strong campaign on behalf of the annexation of Texas which had won its independence from Mexico in 1836. Jane authored several books under the pseudonym Cora Montgomery. Jane was supposed to be very beautiful as well as multi-talented. Jane Maria traveled to Mexico via Havana, probably as a secret agent in 1846/47 to deliver a message to General Winifred Scott , concerning the preliminaries of what was afterwards known as the Trist Treaty and to inform Gen. Scott of the position of the negotiations. 79 Jane had many letters published in the New York Sun 1846 - 1848 regarding the Mexican War .80 William McManus and his family were close friends of William L. Marcy, Secretary of War, during the Mexican Conflict. The following is a letter written to Marcy by Jane and his reply to her requesting the discharge of an enlisted man named Corker from the army. Mrs. J.M. Storms Letter dated New York June 4, 1847 - File #344 National Archives, Washington, DC It is said here Gov. Marcy that not only did applicant __ never receive them from your department but that even an answer is seldom vouchsafed nevertheless I shall venture to press one case in which I feel a strong interest on your attention - __ __ however, on that account than from its own right to a hearing William. William Corker, an educated effeminate young Englishman enlisted in Capt. PostleyÂ‘s Company, 10th Regiment of infantry commissioned by the redoubtable Col. Temple - in a fit of near desperation. His friends, when they heard of this impudent step, came forward to re-establish his position but could not succeed in getting his discharge, Two men were offered to supply his single place, but Capt. Postley (having occasion probably for one man in his company who could write English, refused them and promoted Wm. Corker to the magnificent post of 2d Sargeant. A formal petition for his discharge is somewhere about the War Department and I write to interest you to glance at it, and if so much mercy is to be found at Washington, decide to spare from the service a useless man. Corker is no more fit for military hardship than an 80 year old woman and will be on the sick list three fourths of the time he is in the service. He would probably have answered to carry epaulets for he is brave? and intelligent but is perfectly unfit for real soldier service. May I expect the favor of a reply? Very respectfully, J.M.Storms J.M. Storms New York City Washington June 11, 1847 - Letter to Jane M. Storm from William L. Marcy-(Secretary of War - Mexican War) NY State Lib. Manuscript Section File #7543 Madam, I have your letter of the 4th inst. the ? with which it commenced is a very great slander on me. I give a great many favors - all I presume that I ought to grant, and as to answering letters, nobody answers half as many as I do. I really take credit to myself for my punctuality in replying to all letters requiring it. There are a class to which the following response is all which can be said. \"Your letter for application is received and will be duly answered\". This is superfluous work -The mails are tolerably regular - The presumption is, as a letter duly mailed, is received - and still stranger, at the presumption that I duly consider -it. As you are -an old friend and not unpardonably disposed, and are therefore willing to believe that I spend all my leisure time in answering letters that require no other answer than the stereotyped answer before stated - I need scarcely tell you that if the Secretary of War was to give his personal attention to each application made for discharge in an Army of forty thousand men he would certainly do nothing else. If the petition you mention was addressed to me it was referred to the proper bureau and doubtless received the proper action. Arbritary discharges are never granted - Sufficient reasons must be- shown -- alleging is not showing You arraign Capt. Postley most unreasonably. If Corker was the only man in his Company 'who could write English' I think he was justified to be tenacious of him. You admit he is fit to carry epaulettes - would it not be right to retain him for that purpose. Still as your solicitude on the subject interests me, I will refer your letter to the Adjutant General with a special request that it shall receive special attention. Indeed it is to be presumed the application had been well considered and duly replied to and those who complain do so for want of knowledge. The Adjutant General has given public notice that in cases of applications for discharge of enlisted soldiers, if no letter in reply is received, it is to be understood the application is not granted. Silence in such a case, is a good - but not perhaps a satisfactory reply. Yours truly, Wm. L. MARCY Mrs. Jane M. STORMS Letter to Jane M. Storms from War Department dated 14 June 1847. - National Archives File #344 Madam, Your letter to the Sec. of War of the 4th inst. applying for the discharge of Sergeant William Corker of Company F,10th Infantry has referred to this office and in reply I have respectfully to inform you, that after due consideration, it is regretted that due regard to the public interest and the economy of the service will not justify will not justify a compliance with your wishes. The very numerous applications for discharge upon grounds equally strong as the case now presented compelled the Dept. long since to establish fixed rules touching the subject which cannot be departed from without detriment to the Army especially in the present state of the service________I am Madam, respectfully, ROGER JONES There was a William Corker, Pvt.

War Service who received pensions as a result of their Mexican War Service.81 Jane's second husband William Leslie Cazneau was appointed as Commissary General of the Texas Army and served in the Mexican War with this rank. Cazneau had moved to Texas in the year 1830 establishing a general merchandising business. He represented Travis County in the 7th, 8h & 9th Congress in the Convention of 1845.82 In 1850 the Jane & William became two of the first settlers of Eagle Pass, Texas located on the Rio Grande River. In 1853 Cazneau was appointed as special agent of the United States to the Dominican Republic .83 The listing for Jane in the 1850 TX cn Eagle Pass at the Rio Grande, Bexar Texas, 289: Cazneau, William L. ae 37, merchant, $16,000, b.

Jane Cazneau wrote her last Will & Testament in New York City on 27 Jan 1877 possibly while a guest at the Kensington Hotel as the three witnesses to the document were residents of that hostelry. She left all of her real and personal estate for the use of- Mrs. Ann S. Stephens author, of New York City, who was a friend of Jane & her late husband -General William Leslie Cazneau. If Ann S. Stephens predeceased Jane, all property was to go to Mrs. Stephens daughter Ann Sophia Stephens. The will stipulates that Ann Stephens was to see to the comfort and support of Jane's son William Mount Storms during his lifetime and after his decease the proceeds of the estate were bequeathed to Ann Stephens for her life time use. After the elder Ann Stephens decease everything was to go to her daughter Ann Sophia Stephens. If William Mount Storms predeceased the elder Stephens, she received all of Jane's estate which would eventually go to the younger Ann S. Stephens. The will contains a schedule of Jane's most valued property namely: (1) an estate known as Keith Hall in the Island of Jamaica, in the Parish of St. Catherine, seven miles from Spanish Town containing about 800 acres of land, a large mansion, all the furniture, livestock etc. (2) The Esmerelda, an estate near San Domingo City, in the Island of San Domingo containing about 20 acres.

(5) A $10,000 claim against the Spanish Government for the spoliation of the Esmerelda Estate by the Spaniards while cccupying San Domingo. (6) A tract of more than 40 acres of land at Samana Bay. (7) Jane's interest in a land grant of 11 square leagues of land in Waco, Texas, on the Brazos River of which Jane's brother -Robert O.W. McManus owns one-half. Jane had agreed with her brother Robert to give him one-half of the interest on this property as compensation for his services. (8) About 1000 acres of land at Eagle Pass, Texas, composing an estate called Eagle Pass. -Robert O.W. McManus acted as Jane's agent in regard to the Texas lands and had been paid for this service by transfer of land on Cane Island in the Brazons River. (9) A tract of land adjoining Eagle Pass, called the Revas Grant which had been transferred to Gen. Cazneau in payment of a debt. Jane named as executors of her estate,- Edward H. Dickerson, Mrs. Ann S. Stephens and Ann Sophia Stephens. Witnesses to the document were:- S.Z.N. Stark, F.W. Stark, & Gertrude F. Stark, all residents of the Kensington Hotel in New York City.84 This will was replaced by another will dated 21 Nov. 1878 and the probate process began in New York City in Feb. of 1879. In this document Jane gives her land in Jamaica for the benefit of the Cazneau garden school; her property in the Dominican Republic to her son William Mount Storms & his wife Annie Hasbrouck Storm. JaneÂ’s land in Texas was left to her granddaughter Cora Hutchins. Any proceeds from a claim against the Spanish was to go to William Mount Storm whom the will refers to as Â“peculiar mental condition of my said son having obliged me to make these special and independent arrangements in his behalfÂ” Lemuel H. Baldwin of New York City was the executor of the will.85 Jane Cazneau died from drowning when the Steamer ship Emily B. Sounder, bound for Jamaica, floundered and sunk on 10 Dec. 1878. All the passengers and the crew, save two, died in this disaster. Jane's daughter-in-law A.M. Storm, of the South died with her 86. Children: by 1st marriage 43*William M.

McManus married (1) 18 July 1838 in Liberty County Texas (44) SARAH SPINKS, daughter of BAKER M. SPINKS & JOANA JOHNS. Sarah was born 24 June 1822 in Louisiana according to various census and died 1879.89 Robert married (2) 3 May 1880 (45) MARY E. TURNER who was living in 1880.90 Robert is mentioned once in his father's account book - on 14 Oct. 1814 Dr. Allen was paid $2.00 for \"enockelating Robert\" 91 Robert was in the Class of 1828 listed as lawyer of Brunswick at the Rensselaer Institute (founded by Amos Eaton, now Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute).92 In the Amos Eaton Account Book recently transcribed by compiler, there is a non-dated note reading Â“McManus Old Book, page 5 have his fatherÂ’s note written by him also his engagement to pay his sisterÂ’s debtÂ”. This probably refers to a note of William McManus for tuition etc. of Robert O.W. McManus and the debt of Roberts sister Jane Storm for tuition of her son William Mount Storm who attended the Institute Robert traveled to the State of Texas with his father & sister in 1833 and remained there where he was a surveyor and land owner. On 6 March 1836 he volunteered under William M.

Dibble, wife of the Rev. Sheldon Dibble, missionary at that place, aged 28 years and 10 months. She was born in Connecticut and became a disciple of Christ when about 20 years of age and entered with the church under Rev. Mr. Beaman of Troy, N.Y. She was married in the fall of 1830, sailed from New Bedford, the following winter and arrived at the Sandwich Islands the next June. She spent the first part of her missionary life at Hilo, Hawaii and the last two years at Lahainaluna. She was the mother of three children, one of whom, a daughter died before her. The other two, a daughter and a son survive. The Kingdom of Christ was engraved in her heart and she rejoiced in making any sacrifice which might promote it. She prayed much and was docile as a child resembling Mary at the feet of her Lord hearing his words. Her life was useful, her death triumph and her memory blessed. - Ke Kumu Hawaii.

She was born 22 June 1813 129 She died on the ship Emily Sounder with her mother-in-law on 10 Dec. 1878.130 William M. Storm was a very unusual and apparently eccentric person as one can tell by the two wills of his mother Jane previously mentioned. The following newspaper interview is a firsr person of his life - Troy Daily Press, Monday January 26, 1891 The ups and downs of an eccentric Trojan Inventor - Born in Troy and educated in Spain - Roughing it in Texas- some of his curious inventions Here and Elsewhere - Now living life of a recluse in the heart of the city - Notable career of his mother - In a little room on the top floor of KreigerÂ’s Hotel, No. 180 Congress St. his only companion a lonesome looking cat, lives one of the strangest men Troy has ever produced. One might travel the world over and still not find another with a history so strange. There is no carpet on the floor of the little apartment he calls his home for the time being, and the furniture consists of a single bed, A wooden wash stand, a table, three hardwood chairs and a small old fashion cylinder stove. The stove pipe runs out through one of the upper panes in the window sash and carries forth its load of smoke and heat into the chill air without the aid of a chimney. Like its owner it is a very curious independent sort of an affair, and cares not a fig of what the great world may think of it. Here in this strange sort of a home lives this most peculiar man. It is seldom that he goes out to mingle with his fellow men, but once he was a great traveler. He is his own cook and chambermaid and the foot of either woman or man, seldom crosses his threshold . When he looks out of his window he sees only the red tin roof an adjoining building or the blue skies. Tall, sinewy, with face and hands bronzed from exposure to the suns of other climes, his short hair well sprinkled with silver and a stubby gray mustache covering his firm straight upper lip, in solitude and happy in his quietness and his cat lives , lives William Mt. Storm, the father of 300 inventions. He was born on Second Street in this City, Aug. 2, 1836 (Note should be 1826). He is the son of Allen B. & Jane Storm. His father was a New York City man and died when his boy was only six years old. His mother was Jane McManus, a daughter of William McManus who was twice mayor of Troy (note this statement is untrue); served a term in Congress from this district and at one time held the office of State Astromener. William L. Marcy studied law in his office. The mother of William Mt. Storm was noted in literacy circles in her time, and she too, had an eventful and romantic life. After the death of her husband she went to New York and was for a time engaged upon the various newspapers of the day. She was for a time on the Sun, with Moses Y. Beach and wrote articles on the Mexican War for Horace Greeley, who was then on the New Yorker. One of her exploits was landing at Vera Cruz in a surf boat with a picked crew from an American man-of-war, securing the information she wanted, and returning safely to the vessel. Horace Greeley sent her to Africa to write stories of articles on that country. These things were proudly related by her son to a reporter from this paper last evening. Mr. Storm also said that his mother entered the city of Mexico with Gen. Winfield Scott and helped prepare the treaty with this country. The rest of the strange story the recluse tells in this way: Â“I went with my mother to Africa. I was very young at the time. At Gibraltar we were entertained by Counsel General Sprague. On the way home again spent some time in Gibraltar and Mrs. Sprague who was a famous Spanish beauty, treated us very kindly. My mother was then thinking of sending me to Paris to be educated but Mrs. Sprague got her to change her mind and send me instead to the college of St. Augustine in Cadiz, Spain. There at the age of 16 I was graduated at the head of my class, and the Board of Directors voted me a premium extraordinary for proficiency in the Castilian language. I then returned to this country. When I was 20 my mother married Gen. W.L. Cazneau who was born in Boston. He was afterward appointed minister plenipotentiary to San Domingo. Retiring from office he bought a castle on the Island of Jamaica where he died in the early part of 1879. My mother came back to this country after his death for a visit and in December of 1879 sailed for Jamaica to sell her property and come back to her native country to end her days. But the vessel went down in a storm on the voyage out and only two men of all the crew and passengers were saved. My life has been spent in Texas and New York principally. My grandfather with President Austin of Texas once owned ninety-nine square miles of fine land in that country. While in Texas I passed much of my time in surveying. The United States government once sent me there to survey and make maps of the mouths of the rivers emptying into Galveston Bay. These place were full of stumps at that time, and they checked the full flow of the waters. I used in this work a clipper built after my own design in New York. Of course I had many strange experiences there but it would fill a paper to begin to tell them for I never knew when to stop when I get started on that subject. I also had a government contract in Texas to carry the mail from Galveston to the head waters of the Trinity River. Once I heard of a number of old soldiers who wanted to locate bounty claims. I fitted out an expedition of sixteen men and went out at their head to locate the claims. We had a great experience one way and another on that journey. The red skins were pretty thick there in those days, and while we were not so much afraid of losing our lives, we had to keep our eyes open or they would steal a blanket from under you while you slept. When I was 24 years old I married Cora, the daughter of Henry Hayner of Brunswick. He then lived on a farm that had belonged to my people for generations. Old Judge Wool, who had an office on Congress St. in those days came out to Brunswick at my request an married us. We remained here for a year and then went to New York, where I obtained a place as examiner in the custom house. Ten years later my wife died, leaving me with one child, a daughter. Oh yes, I have invented a great many different things -- 300 or more. Many of them I cannot myself remember. Of course many of them did not amount to a great deal, and only few were ever patented; still I have, at different times, taken out patents in the United States, England, France and Belgium. One of my best inventions was what I called a cloud engine. On the theory usually accepted by engineers, James Watts and Dr. Black simultaneously discovered latent heat. I delivered an address at the American Institute in New York and published a pamphlet showing that there is no such thing as latent heat, but what was so called was only combined electricity. Thus I claimed that steam and air formed a cloud which had force to drive an engine. I patented this idea to prove my theory correct . This was in 1858 and the matter attracted attention all over the country at the time. I also had an electric motor. I can take from the sky, air and earth positive and negative currents of electricity and drive an engine. This, also, have I demonstrated, but I never brought the facts before the public. About 1850 Congress passed a bill offering $3500 in gold to anyone who would present the best plan to convert the old HarperÂ’s Ferry Rifles into breach loaders for rapid firing. I went to work on the problem. The test was made at West Point and I was successful. I went to HarperÂ’s ferry afterward at the request of the secretary of war and showed the master armorer how to make the special tools to do the work. I then went to Washington and got my reward. I carried the $2500 in gold away in a valise and it was a pretty good load to. I got out a patent on breech loading rifles afterward. I have also patented at different times in years back several revolvers. The revolving hammer on the old fashion Â“pepper boxÂ” revolver was mine. A method of blowing up ships was another one of my inventions that was successful. Later I had an invention , a tub set in the center of a ship which would save them from sinking, raise automatically a flag of distress in case of danger and save people and valuables put into it by means of air-tight compartments, Yes, IÂ’ve been a wanderer, a rolling stone all my life. IÂ’ve been rich and poor again half a dozen times. Perhaps some other time I will give you more in detail of something of my wanderings and inventions. I donÂ’t always like to talk of them but occasionally I take a notion to chat. Its hard for me to tell a connected story , for when I get thinking of all that is past, events crowd upon my mind so fast that I lose track of myself. I have been back in Troy this last time for about two years.Â” 1850 NY cn Rensselaer Co.
