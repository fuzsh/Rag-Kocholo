        "text": "Found from earliest times in two of Ireland’s ancient provinces, bearers of the McManus name found themselves at the very heart of the island’s frequently violent episodes.\n\nResisting attempts to stamp out their very identity as a Gaelic-Irish clan, they paid a bitter price, and many were forced to seek a new life in foreign lands where their descendants thrive to this day.\n\nIn contemporary times and on the screen Mark McManus, born in South Lanarkshire in 1935, was the Scottish actor who became famous through his role of Chief Inspector Jim Taggart in the highly popular Scottish television series Taggart, having previously worked for a time as an actor in Australia and appearing in the television series Skippy the Bush Kangaroo.\n\nIn the world of sport, John Patrick McManus is the Irish businessman and renowned racehorse owner better known as J.P. McManus.\n\nThe colourful lives and times of the McManuses are presented here.\n\nName variations include:, Mac Maghnuis (Gaelic), Mac Manus (Gaelic), MacManners, Manus, McManus"
