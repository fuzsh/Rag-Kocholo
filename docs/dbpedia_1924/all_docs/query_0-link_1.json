        "text": "McManus is an Irish surname. It is derived from the Irish Gaelic \"Mac Mághnais\",[1] in modern Irish \"McMaghnuis\" which means \"Son of Magnus\".[2] Its earlier origin is from the Latin \"magnus\", meaning \"great\". The Normans used it to honour Charlemagne (742–814), as Carolus Magnus (Charles the Great).[3] Variant spellings of the name include MacManus, Manus and MacManners.[1] The English form, Moyne, is also found in Ulster.[2] In Scotland it is a sept of Clan Colquhoun.[4]\n\nThere are two principal septs of the name in Ireland:[3]\n\nOne descends from Maghnus (died 1181), son of Turlough Mór O'Conor, High King of Ireland (1119–1156); this branch belonged to Kilronan in the county of Roscommon in the province of Connacht.\n\nThe second sept was a branch of the Maguires, who descend from Magnus, son of Donn Maguire (Donn Mag Uidhir), Chief of the Kingdom of Fermanagh (died 1302).
