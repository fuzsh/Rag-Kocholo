        "text": "A counter-investigation into the racist massacre of 24 June 2022\n\nBorder Forensics, in collaboration with Irídia-Centre for the Defense of Human Rights and AMDH-Moroccan Association for Human Rights\n\nSummary\n\nOn 24 June 2022, some two thousand migrants attempted to cross the border fence separating the city of Nador, in the northeast of Morocco, from the Spanish-controlled enclave of Melilla. The violent repression inflicted on them by Moroccan and Spanish law enforcement agents turned the Barrio Chino border crossing into a death trap and resulted in a mass grave. The Moroccan authorities have acknowledged 23 deaths, but according to the Moroccan Human Rights Association in Nador at least 27 people were killed, and more than 70 remain disappeared to this day. What happened on 24 June 2022? How and by whom was the Barrio Chino border post turned into a death trap?\n\nTo answer these questions, for more than a year Border Forensics investigated with Irídia-Center for the Defense of Human Rights and the Moroccan Association for Human Rights (AMDH), as well as other civil society actors on both sides of the border. Furthermore, we benefited from the additional advice of the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR). By articulating our analysis of the massacre across different spatial and temporal scales, we attempted to understand not only the sequence of events and the practices of the actors present on 24 June 2022, but also the structural conditions that made the massacre possible, and the political conjuncture that shaped this extreme intensity of violence. We also analysed the violence that continued after 24 June, through the failure to identify the deceased and the disappeared, the impunity for the massacre, and the judicial harassment against the migrants themselves.\n\nAlthough many grey areas remain, the facts that we reconstructed by cross-referencing numerous pieces of evidence are damning, for both the Moroccan and Spanish authorities, as well as for the European Union which supports them politically and financially. The authorities on both sides of the border must shed full light on this massacre and finally respond to the victims’ and their families’ demands for truth and justice.\n\nIntroduction\n\nOn 24 June 2022, almost two thousand people tried to cross the border fence separating the Moroccan town of Nador from the Spanish-controlled town of Melilla. The migrants’ attempted crossing, which occurred at the Barrio Chino border post, was violently repressed by Moroccan and Spanish law enforcement agents. Only 134 people managed to enter Melilla and seek asylum. 470 people were deported back to Morocco by Spanish and Moroccan officials after they had crossed over to the Spanish-controlled side of the border fence. The violence inflicted on migrants by Moroccan and Spanish law enforcement agents that day turned the Barrio Chino border crossing into a death trap, and resulted in the formation of a mass grave. The Moroccan authorities have acknowledged 23 deaths, but the Moroccan Human Rights Association in Nador has counted at least 27 people killed on that day, and more than 70 remain missing to this day.\n\nDespite the many images filmed by various actors and several reports published by official bodies, associations and journalists, there are still many grey areas concerning the course of events on that day. The Moroccan and Spanish authorities are far from having shed full light on the facts, and have instead prevented independent investigations from gaining access to a many essential elements of evidence.\n\nHow was this outburst of violence possible? Through what specific acts did it take place? Who was responsible? How and by whom was the Barrio Chino border post turned into a death trap?\n\nTwo years after the events, these questions have yet to be answered, and the demands for truth and justice from the survivors of the massacre and the families of the dead and disappeared have gone unheard. On the contrary, instead of using the judicial institutions to determine those responsible for the massacre, Morocco has used its judicial system to continue repressing the survivors of the massacre, several dozen of whom have been sentenced to prison for alleged acts of violence and other offences. The Spanish prosecutor has not found any evidence of violations and has closed his investigation. Moreover, far from being dismantled, the border fence has been reinforced and, although border crossings have decreased since 24 June 2022, the system of racist repression at the border remains unchanged.\n\nIt is to support the demand for truth and justice of the victims of the 24 June 2022 massacre and their families, and to combat this regime of impunity that allows the border violence to be perpetuated, that Border Forensics, in collaboration with Irídia and the Moroccan Association for Human Rights (AMDH), as well as other civil society actors on both sides of the border, has conducted a counter-investigation for over a year, while benefiting from additional advice from the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR). Together, we assembled a transdisciplinary team made up of members of human rights associations, journalists, researchers specialising in critical analysis of the borders of migration policies and anti-Black racism, as well as experts in spatial and visual reconstruction, statisticians, architects and documentary film-makers.\n\nBy articulating our analysis of the massacre across different spatial and temporal scales, we have attempted to understand not only the sequence of events and the practices of the actors present at the scene on 24 June 2022, but also the structural conditions that made the massacre possible, as well as the political conjuncture that shaped this unprecedented intensity of violence. We also analysed the violence that continued after 24 June, through the failure to identify the dead and missing, and the impunity and judicial targeting against the migrants themselves.\n\nOur analysis shows that the many dead and missing during the massacre of 24 June 2022 were no accident. On the contrary, the migrants were repeatedly directed towards the Barrio Chino border crossing, and violently repressed by Moroccan and Spanish law enforcement agents once they were trapped there. But the death trap into which the migrants fell goes beyond the architecture of the border crossing or the chain of events that took place on 24 June. It has woven by policies and practices operating in an extended space-time, including European and Spanish policies of externalising migration control established over more than two decades, Moroccan migration diplomacy, impunity for violence perpetrated over many years, and the daily racist repression deployed against Black people in the area. All these elements combined to form a death trap, which the Spanish and Moroccan law enforcement agents executed on 24 June 2022.\n\nAlthough there are still grey areas, the facts that we have reconstructed by cross-referencing numerous pieces of evidence are damning, both for the Moroccan and Spanish authorities and for the European Union, which supports them politically and financially. The authorities on both sides of the border must be brought to account for this massacre and finally respond to the victims’ and their families’ demands for truth and justice.\n\nThe Nador-Melilla massacre is, by virtue of the outburst of direct violence, the acts of racism and extreme dehumanisation and the large number of dead and disappeared, one of the most serious crimes perpetrated as part of the discriminatory and militarised management of Europe’s borders over the last 30 years. However, beyond its exceptional nature, this massacre exemplifies in an exacerbated way a wider trend towards the brutalisation of the management of borders and the normalisation of the violations perpetrated in the name of their “protection”. By precisely documenting the events of 24 June 2022 and analysing the conditions that made them possible, it is also these wider trends that we seek to challenge.\n\nReport outline\n\nIn order to answer our main question “How and by whom was the Barrio Chino border post transformed into a death trap?” we divided our analysis of the politics and practices of anti-Black violence into several chapters, each of which reflects a distinct temporality and spatiality: (1) the long duration of coloniality and anti-Black racism at the border, which created the conditions of possibility for the massacre; (2) the particular conjuncture of changing diplomatic relation between Morocco, Spain and the EU in the months leading up to 24 June, and the resulting oscillations in the intensity of repression; (3) the day of the massacre; and (4) the violence to which the victims of 24 June continue to be subjected two years after the event.\n\nIn Chapter 1, which is primarily based on Elsa Tyszler’s doctoral research, the historical, political, and repressive context of the Nador-Melilla border is outlined. Delving back into its history reveals the long-standing racial and colonial dimension of this border. The analysis of the evolution of legislations, policies and practices enables us to grasp the racist nature of the anti-migratory repression that was put in place by Spain around the enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla from the 1990s, and then from the 2000s onwards on the Moroccan side. What emerges and consolidates over this time on both sides of the border is a consensus around a Black figure of migratory danger. The specific repression targeting so-called “Sub-Saharan” people can be seen both in the daily security harassment of Black people in the Nador area, and in the spikes in violence represented by the massacres recorded since 2005, particularly around the border barriers. Our geostatistical analysis corroborates the analysis of migrants themselves, researchers and associations concerning the overexposure of Black migrants to violence. Our analysis of the data collected by the IOM since 2014 shows that of the 892 documented cases of people who died at the border, at least 406 came from Central, East and West Africa, representing 46%. What thus emerges is a regime of racial domination instituted on both sides of the border against Black people, which, as discussed in Chapter 3, we describe in terms of “border apartheid”.\n\nDespite numerous complaints by migrants about violations of their rights at the border, the rights of migrants and the national and international standards that should protect them are regularly flouted, and a regime of impunity has been consolidated, as our analysis together with ECCHR of over 10 years of litigation reveals.\n\nInteractive timeline displaying key stages and outcomes for attempts to seek accountability for cases of violence and violations at the Ceuta and Melilla borders for the period 2014-2022. Border Forensics, 2024.View full screen.\n\nThe denial of Black migrants’ shared humanity through every-day racism and violence on the one hand, and the denial of their rights through the regime of impunity that has been consolidated around this violence on the other, have combined to define a population – Black migrants – as massacrable.\n\nChapter 2 shows that while anti-Black violence is continuous at the border, its intensity varies considerably depending on the conjuncture of diplomatic relations between Morocco and Spain, and between Morocco and the European Union. The analyses produced by Sani Ladan and Maite Daniela Lo Coco of Irídia and the members of the AMDH-Nador on which this chapter is based show that the particular conjuncture of diplomatic relations during the period 2021-2022, oscillating between tensions, ruptures and reconciliations between Rabat and Madrid, had a fundamental influence on the unprecedented level of repression observed on 24 June 2022. While in a context of diplomatic rupture since May 2021 Moroccan authorities had been allowing more migrants to cross the border, following the diplomatic reconciliation between Rabat and Madrid in April 2022, Moroccan law enforcement agents once again intensified their repression, prompting Black migrants to attempt the crossing.\n\nIn addition, the testimonies we gathered and the analysis of satellite images reveal a high degree of preparation, or even premeditation, on the part of the Moroccan authorities. On the one hand, they appear to have sought to influence the migrants to attempt to cross the border fence without the usual equipment, making them more vulnerable, and on the other hand to have stepped up the militarisation of the border in the days leading up to 24 June, thereby widening the gap in the already deeply unequal balance of power between migrants and law enforcement agents.\n\nChapter 3, which is based on the analysis of all partners in the investigation, provides a detailed account of the sequence of events of 24 June 2022. By cross-referencing numerous pieces of evidence, in particular the testimonies of survivors gathered in Morocco and Spain, the analysis of official documents, the analysis of numerous photographic and video-graphic images taken by different actors, and by locating these sources in time and space, we map each stage of the events, making it possible to analyse the practices of violence at work.\n\nOur systematic reconstruction provides new evidence as to the responsibilities of Moroccan and Spanish authorities and makes it possible to refute their versions of the facts, which absolve them of any responsibility. Here too, our analysis reveals a veritable strategy, insofar as the Moroccan law enforcement agents deliberately allowed the migrants to approach the border that day and then directed them, using the threat of repression, towards the Barrio-Chino border post. Channeled inside the border post from which they were trying to cross the border into Melilla, the migrants were first targeted by the use of riot gear deployed from all sides by Moroccan and Spanish forces. The intense gassing in a confined space, and the panic during the crossing attempt, certainly produced the first deaths in this massacre. Then came the beatings, perpetrated mainly by the Moroccan forces, of those who remained inside the post and of those who were violently turned back jointly by the Spanish and Moroccan forces, which constituted the main moment, lasting several hours, of deadly violence. No images of this phase of the events have yet been made public. While this outburst of violence can thus not be made visible, we make it audible through the testimonies of the survivors. We further reveal that Spanish law enforcement agents themselves perpetrated numerous acts of violence and violations, in particular by inflicting inhuman and degrading treatment onto the intercepted migrants. By sending the migrants back to Morocco despite knowing that they would be subjected to extreme violence, the Spanish agents contributed to this violence. Finally, we show that while the majority of the deaths took place while the migrants were under the control of Moroccan agents, these deaths were all on Spanish territory. Although some grey areas remain, the facts we have reconstructed are damning, both for the Moroccan and Spanish authorities, and for the European Union, which supports them.\n\nChapter 4 analyses the violence that continued to affect the survivors after the 24 June massacre. In particular, on the basis of the work of the AMDH – Nador and other civil society actors, it looks at the forced displacements organised by the Moroccan authorities immediately after the massacre and the obstacles to access to hospitals and health services for some of the injured survivors. It addresses the question of the opaque management of the corpses resulting from the massacre and the obstruction of the possibilities for the families of the victims to identify and trace the dead and missing, making it impossible for them to mourn. It also highlights the judicial harassment experienced by dozens of survivors who are now in Moroccan jails. Through these various practices, the violence of 24 June continues to cause suffering for the victims and their families.\n\nThe conclusion links together these chapters and their different spatial and temporal aspects. Our research shows that the colonial situation of this border, the European and Spanish policies of outsourcing migration control, Moroccan migration diplomacy, the impunity for the violence perpetrated over the last two decades, the daily racist repression deployed against Black people in the border zone and the border architecture, together formed a death trap that the Spanish and Moroccan law enforcement agents executed on 24 June 2022. Our reconstruction of the events provides terrifying confirmation of the analysis of Black Studies according to which “Black Death is not an event, but a continuum” . The massacre of 24 June began long before that fateful day and continues to this day. In light of our analysis, we formulate a series of demands and recommendations to address the 24 June 2022 massacre and finally bring violence at the Nador-Melilla border to an end.\n\nThroughout our counter-investigation, we give a central place to the words, experiences, analyses and demands of the survivors of the massacre. This counter-investigation is dedicated to all the survivors, who are fighting against racism, for their dignity, and for the recognition of their humanity and rights.\n\nInvestigation methodology\n\nWhile we describe the specific methods we have used in each chapter, here we present more broadly the methodological issues we encountered, and the methodological orientations we adopted as a result. Our investigation had to respond to a fundamental methodological and political challenge: despite the international dissemination of images documenting the 24 June 2022 events, this massacre has remained unpunished, is there a way of documenting and analysing the events that could effectively contribute to challenging the racist violence to which the events of 24 June 2022 bear witness? This challenge can be broken down into several key questions that have influenced the direction of our research. Our response can be summed up by combining methods of investigation and forensic reconstruction of border violence and violations with a critical analysis of colonialism and anti-Black racism.\n\nFaced by the profusion of images from 24 June, what remains to be revealed?\n\nGiven the investigations of the events of 24 June published before ours, and in particular the video footage produced by several actors filming from different points of view, initial questions arose: what more could our investigation reveal when the violence seems to have been almost completely documented? Can our investigation still contribute to the quest for truth and justice? Today we can answer affirmatively. On the one hand, our method of systematic spatial and visual analysis, which we have deployed to cross-reference all the available evidence, offers the most complete reconstruction of the events in space and time to this day. Our reconstruction sheds new light on state responsibility. On the other hand, our systematic approach has brought to light images that have been rendered inaccessible concerning the moments of greatest intensity in the unleashing of violence against migrants. We emphasise these concealments, which were made more difficult to perceive by the profusion of images and the resulting impression of total documentation of the facts.\n\nWhy continue to expose violence and violations when faced with a regime of impunity?\n\nThe dissemination of images documenting the violence and extreme dehumanisation of migrants during the events of 24 June, and the lack of justice and interruption of violence at the border despite this, raises another problem. Can more detailed documentation of the events, such as we have tried to produce, put an end to the regime of impunity for the deaths and violations at this border? Can it contribute to bringing this violence to an end? While we are committed to mobilising different legal strategies and advocacy, we publish this investigation with pessimism with regards to the future responses of governments, at least for the time being. As we show below, the regime of impunity at national and European level for violations at this border is long-established. The anti-Black racism that underpins the violence at the Nador-Melilla border is also present in legal institutions. Moreover, border violence is structural and widely accepted by European citizens and states alike as a necessary evil to “protect” Europe from the “threat” that the arrival of migrants from the global South is supposed to pose.\n\nWhile the possibility of profound change bringing violence at the border to an end thus seems remote, we nevertheless see political and legal institutions at national and European level as important arenas for struggle, and are determined to use the various tools of legal litigation and advocacy to defend the rights of migrants. Moreover, despite these limitations, we none the less believe that our counter-investigation is essential to respond to the demand for truth and recognition expressed by many of the survivors of the massacre as well as the families of the dead and disappeared, and to support their quest for justice in the face of the crime that was committed.\n\nWhat are the possible ambivalences associated with the revelation of violence?\n\nThe critical analysis formulated by Black Studies, from which this investigation draws inspiration, poses yet another challenge: is it possible that the documentation and dissemination of representations of anti-Black violence may not only be powerless to put an end to it, but may actually aggravate it? In the United States, Black studies have shown that the hoped-for and assumed effects of disseminating images of violence – that it would lead to at least public, if not legal, condemnation, and ultimately to the cessation of the violence – are not realised when the targets of the violence are Black people. On the contrary, it is possible that the dissemination of these images of violence against Black people contributes to its normalisation and thus to its perpetuation.\n\nThis critique is fundamental to us, and as we will discuss below, has led us to develop alternative strategies of mobilisation of the images from 24 June. We analysed them, notably in dialogue with the survivors of the massacre, as essential sources of evidence for understanding the facts. However, our analysis also attempts to put them at a distance in order to question their production and dissemination as participating in the violence they document. Refusing to reproduce a surveillance, sensationalist, or voyeuristic gaze, and exercising the “disobedient gaze” that Border Forensics has developed in the course of its investigations, we attempt to make visible the violence and the responsibility of States, while protecting the identity of the people and respecting their dignity by hiding certain parts of the images.\n\nBeyond the event of the massacre, what are its conditions of possibility?\n\nFinally, the critical approach developed by Black studies poses yet another challenge to our analysis and reconstruction of the events of 24 June, and to our objective of analysing the violence and responsibility of States. Indeed, Black studies emphasise that “Black death is not an event, but a continuum that intimately informs Black existence” . Although cases of violence targeting Black people can be spectacularly revealed during specific events – such as the massacre of 24 June 2022, but also during the many cases of racist police violence – the violence that permeates the daily lives of Black people is often far less spectacular and documented. Yet this everyday violence – often invisible and unrecognised – is essential to take into account. If, as the philosopher Norman Ajari notes, “the way in which a Black person dies in a racist world is in continuity with the way in which he is bound to live in it”, we must extend our analysis beyond the space-time of the massacre of 24 June 2022. Our counter-investigation thus also aims to reconstitute, through different temporalities and spatialities the conditions of possibility of the massacre, or what we propose to refer to as the massacrability of Black subjects at the border. In particular we analyse the daily racism and dehumanisation experienced by Black people on the Nador-Melilla border, as well as the regime of impunity for the violence and violations targeting them. To this end, we combine throughout this counter-investigation qualitative research methods such as interviews, which are essential in order to reconstruct the experiences Black people as well as their analyses, with the visual and spatial reconstruction tools and geostatistical analysis of events developed by Border Forensics, making it possible to assess the evolution of structural practices and the over-exposure of Black people to different forms of violence at the border over time. In this sense, our approach attempts to articulate the analysis, on the one hand, of the “minimal causality” of the blows inflicted by the law enforcement agents onto migrants during the event of the massacre and, on the other hand, of the “maximal causality” of structural violence operating in an extended space-time. The latter also includes the post-massacre phase, to the extent that the absence of truth, recognition and justice following the massacre, the failure to identify the dead and disappeared, and the judicial harassment suffered by the victims perpetuates the violence in other forms.\n\nWhat could a critical, anti-racist and decolonial forensic investigation be?\n\nWhile critical studies of racism and decolonial approaches have influenced the definition of the subject of our counter-investigation as well as our methodologies, we have also tried to let these perspectives influence the constitution of our team and our research process. On the one hand, within the limits of fundamentally different legal, social, and material conditions, we have sought to collaborate as closely as possible with the survivors, and to account for their experiences, analyses, and resistance. On the other hand, we attempted to assemble a research team across the boundaries of citizenship, race, and class, while acknowledging and attempting to minimise the inequalities arising from our different and asymmetrical social positions. Together we have constituted a large team made up of human rights associations, journalists, and researchers specialising in the critical analysis of borders, migration policies and racism, experts in spatial and visual reconstruction, statisticians, architects, and documentary filmmakers. Our work was spread over several phases: data collection, particularly on the ground (February – June 2023); data analysis (September – December 2023); drafting of the report and production of the visual and spatial reconstructions (January – April 2024).\n\nOur research process within this large and diverse team has been long, difficult, and sometimes fraught with tension. But it has constituted a stage in the experimentation with a critical, anti-racist and decolonial approach to forensic investigation.\n\nOur approach also finds expression in the writing style adopted throughout this report. A neutral and descriptive tone usually prevails in human rights reports, which tends to erase the social position of the authors and their political leanings. On the contrary, we assert our position, our commitment, and our perception not only of the violations of the law but also of the injustice that was committed. We further adopt a reflexive stance with regard to the ambivalences that our research process brings to light. Acknowledging our position is part of our methodological rigour and provides a transparent account of our perspective on the facts.\n\nCHAPTER 1. STRUCTURAL CONDITIONS: A COLONIAL AND RACIAL BORDER\n\nThe racial dimension of the repression at the border, dramatically revealed on 24 June 2022, is deeply influenced by the colonial history of the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla. Our analysis therefore begins with this colonial context and its long-term evolution.\n\nThe colonial matrix of the border\n\nSpanish presence on this coast of North Africa began at the end of the Middle Ages. In 1415, Portuguese troops conquered Ceuta. This was followed by other conquests along the Atlantic coast of North Africa by the Portuguese monarchs in the following decades. In the meantime, the kingdom of Castille was intermittently advancing on the territory of the Nasarite kingdom of Granada. Granada was conquered in 1492, thus ending the last Muslim-ruled kingdom of Al Andalus. The kingdoms of Castille and Aragon joined in that year forming what would become the kingdom of Spain. The military advance of the kingdom of Spain then extended to the northern coast of Africa. The aim was to set up military posts to protect the Andalusian coast from pirates threatening the trade routes (and in particular the Spanish galleons laden with gold from the “Indies”, i.e. the Americas), but also to counter the growing influence of the Ottomans seeking to secure control of trade in this part of the Mediterranean.\n\nMelilla was conquered by the Spanish in 1497 and became the first Spanish frontera. At the time, the term frontera, a term used to designate an advanced military position in enemy territory . From the enclave of Melilla, the Spanish sovereigns attempted to establish themselves all along the Mediterranean coast towards Tunisia. Conquered in 1415 by the Portuguese, Ceuta passed into Spanish hands in 1668.\n\nThe offensive aspect of the fronteras was soon transformed into a defensive situation, as the Spanish and Portuguese were unable to occupy the hinterland and were faced with resistance from the indigenous population: the Rifans. The name presidios, for both enclaves, refers to a prison, as the two functions were soon combined in both enclaves. In 1889, Ceuta officially became a colonial prison where Spanish dissidents from the colonial order were imprisoned, as well as those from American territories, such as those banished from Cuba, and in particular freed Black slaves.\n\nThroughout the centuries of Spanish occupation, the military played an important role in Ceuta and Melilla. With the emergence of the Africanistas officers, the most famous of whom was Francisco Franco – the future dictator – a new generation of soldiers found their raison d’être in colonial action and put pressure on the political authorities to continue the military penetration of Morocco from the mid-19th century onwards. Ceuta and Melilla became the real bridgeheads of Spanish colonial penetration, which began with a murderous war against the resistance of Abdelkrim El Khattabi, known as the leading figure of the Rif movement. In 1921, there was a Spanish defeat at Annoual (near Melilla), known as the “Annoual disaster”, which left between 9’000 and 13’000 dead in the Spanish ranks – the figure remain unknown on the Rif side. The “Annoual disaster” gave rise to a “compulsive revenge syndrome” within the Spanish army in Africa, reflected in its obsession with the castigo (punishment) of the moro rebelde (rebel Moor) during Spanish counter-offensive in the Rif. After several bloody wars and a Franco-Spanish alliance against the Rif resistance – notably in the Rif war (between 1921 and 1927), during which chemical weapons were used – a dual Spanish-French protectorate was established in Morocco.\n\nThe racialization of the Muslim enemy is historically part of the Spanish colonial project in Morocco. In the case of the enclaves, if the methods used to dominate the conquered populations were diverse and heterogeneous – depending both on the sub-groups targeted and on how the stakes and interests changed over time – the processes were marked by military violence and repression, including bloodshed, applied to a group constituted as the Muslim Enemy, and then, more specifically, the Rifain.\n\nWith the exception of a few categories of indigenous people who were useful to the army or the Spanish trade, the Muslim population was banished from the enclaves until the end of the 19th century.\n\nAfter Moroccan independence, racial segregation in Ceuta and Melilla\n\nDespite Moroccan independence in 1956, the two towns remained under Spanish control. During the 20th century, Ceuta and Melilla were gradually populated by civilians from the Spanish Peninsula and Morocco. The so-called Muslim population grew rapidly to meet the labour needs of the capitalist expansion of the two cities. But the Muslim populations were to experience continuous racial segregation in the enclaves, tracing a continuity with their colonial history. However, the violence targeting people of Moroccan origin was no longer so much physical as symbolic, rooted in their non-inclusion in the community of citizens of the enclaves and of Spain.\n\nIn 1958, for example, the Spanish authorities introduced a “statistics card” – in fact a simple census card – for Muslims in Melilla, which gave them no rights whatsoever: no legal residence, no access to property and no right to travel in Spain. The aim was to control a part of the demography, that of the population of Moroccan origin.\n\nIn 1986, the first statistical study of the Muslim population in Ceuta and Melilla showed that over 75% of the Muslim population of the two cities were born there. However, the percentage of Spanish nationals among them was very low: less than 16% in Ceuta and 34% in Melilla. This discrepancy illustrates the reluctance of the administration at the time to grant Spanish nationality, a desire to prevent Muslims from entering municipal institutions and the reactions of the Spanish-speaking sector of public opinion, which feared a “silent invasion”. As a result of these actions by the governments of Ceuta and Melilla, many of the Muslim population are stateless, even though they live and were often born in these reclaimed Spanish territories. Spatially, this population is also located on the geographical, economic, and political margins of the two cities. From 1985 onwards, a social movement began to take shape, seeking recognition of the legal, political, and social rights of Muslim residents of the enclaves. However, this movement was met with great hostility from a section of the population, particularly from the right-wing and far-right political groups in both towns. It was not until the 1990s that several thousand naturalisations were granted, but this in no way resolved the social and political injustice experienced by the Muslim population of Ceuta and Melilla.\n\nThe constantly growing population of Moroccan origin still gives rise to fears in some quarters that the enclaves will lose their “Spanishness”. Social and spatial segregation and discrimination at all levels persist and are regularly denounced by Muslim residents.\n\nAlthough some Muslim have now become political representatives and have obtained seats in the Assembly or the administrations of the enclaves, the overall condition of Muslim residents demonstrates the enduring coloniality of the power that still governs Ceuta and Melilla, which also organises the heightened control of movement across the borders of these enclaves, including for residents of the Rif from the neighbouring regions.\n\nFor almost 40 years, with the status quo respected between Morocco and Spain, and the status of the two cities remaining unchanged, a certain “coexistence” seems to have been established between the two countries around the enclaves. In 1991, the two kingdoms signed a treaty of friendship, good neighbourliness, and cooperation. But in 1995, as part of the completion of the administrative and political organisation of the Spanish State, Ceuta and Melilla were granted autonomous status and became “autonomous municipalities” (Ciudades Autónomas). With this new status, Spain sought, according to Moroccan opinion, to integrate them fully into its national territory in order to prevent any claims by Morocco. Even today, on the Moroccan side, Ceuta and Melilla are still officially considered to be occupied territories.\n\nAs far as the enclaves are concerned, while the “Muslim” or “Moroccan” threat continues to be brandished by certain political groups, at the same time a new type of “invader” began to emerge in the mid-1990s: the migrant from so-called “sub-Saharan” Africa attempting to cross the borders of Ceuta and Melilla to reach Europe.\n\nPolitical developments, externalisation of European control and border repression since 1990\n\nAt the end of the 1980s, the consolidation of an area of free movement for European citizens led to a tightening of entry conditions throughout Europe for the populations of the global South, particularly those from former colonies. In response to the growing difficulties encountered by these populations in gaining legal access to Europe, new strategies and geographies of migration emerged. Various land and sea areas separating Europe from the global South became places where illegalised migrants attempted to cross borders . This is the case of the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, the only land borders between Europe and Africa. After the adoption of the Aliens Act in 1985 and its accession to the Schengen Treaty in 1991 , Spain increasingly implemented a policy of border closure.\n\nThe migratory trajectories of various populations from the global South whose mobility is illegalised converge towards the border areas of Ceuta and Melilla, which they try to access in order to reach the Spanish peninsula. Initially used by Moroccan nationals, this border has since become a transit zone for other people from the rest of the Maghreb (mainly Algeria), Asia (particularly India and Bangladesh) and the Middle East (Syria, Palestine and Yemen, among others).\n\nRelatively unnoticed on the Moroccan side because of their phenotypical resemblance to Moroccans, people from Algeria and the Middle East who have been illegalised by European migration policies usually attempt to cross the border on foot. They blend in with the crowds crossing the border posts at Ceuta and Melilla – counting on the random nature of the checks, carrying false documents to gain entry, or paying bribes to police officers to let them through. Others use vehicles instead, or sometimes try the sea route. Despite the opportunities for these categories of migrants to cross, there have been many cases of difficulties, violence or death, particularly involving Moroccan minors trying to enter Ceuta and Melilla to get on the ferries leaving for the Spanish mainland. However, the risks of exposure to violence and death for Black migrants are far greater.\n\nThe first Central and West Africans arrived in Ceuta and Melilla in the mid-1990s. They were treated differently from other migrants in that they were immediately targeted by state violence.\n\nIn October 1995, in Ceuta, as migrant men protested against the inhumane conditions of detention after entering the enclave in a ruined colonial building, they were brutally repressed, not only by Spanish law enforcement agents but also part of Ceuta’s civilian population.\n\nThe repression of Black migrants in Ceuta during these events, which was exceptional at the time, would become commonplace and standard practice with the implementation of violent expulsions around the Ceuta and Melilla border fences over the coming years.\n\nSpanish repression from the enclaves and the construction of the barriers\n\nFollowing Moroccan independence in 1956, the Melilla border was only materialised by markers on the ground and a small informal fence, but the arrival of so-called “sub-Saharans” migrants, which Spain and its European counterparts consider to be a cause for concern, changed all that. The Spanish authorities – regardless of the political party in power – sought to improve the impermeability of border areas, with the political and financial support of the European Union, by increasing both material and human systems of control and surveillance. From 1996 onwards, the Spanish authorities erected a border fence, the height and complexity of which continued to increase over the following years.\n\nIn 2020, the border barrier reached 10 metres, becoming the highest border separation barrier in the world. In addition, the equipping of the top of the barrier with the so-called “inverted comb” system designed to prevent the climbing of the fence, which has been progressively extended all around the border since summer 2020, has made crossings almost impossible. In collaboration with architect Antonio Giraldez López, we have analysed the historical evolution of the Nador-Melilla border fence infrastructure. Our analysis reveals the way the technologies and components of the fence have constantly evolved in relation to changing political conjunctures, as well as in response to migrants’ continued capacity of crossing.\n\nDespite the plurality of migrants at this border, Central and West African nationals are over-visibilised. A whole body of racist rhetoric and imagery surrounding the “assaults” of “sub-Saharans” on the barriers, and specific policies aimed at preventing them are deployed, producing over the years the category of “sub-Saharan migrants” associated with a threat of the highest order.\n\nFrom the 2000s, implementation of externalisation policies in Morocco\n\nAt the end of the 1990s, in addition to the repressive measures put in place by the Spanish authorities, the European Union called on Morocco to contribute to the “fight against clandestine immigration”.\n\nIt is through a series of agreements and funding that Morocco is incited by EU Member States, and Spain in particular, to cooperate on “migration management”. Since the 1990s, this cooperation has for example taken the form of participation in the SIVE maritime surveillance system. Morocco was thus one of the first African countries to be targeted by the European Union’s externalisation policies, through which the EU seeks to delegate control of its borders to non-European actors.\n\nThis policy has made it possible to strengthen collaboration with the Spanish authorities at the border in the fight against so-called “clandestine” migration to Europe, but also to attenuate Morocco’s claims to “Sebta” and “Mliliya”, which it considers to be occupied territories.\n\nIn 2003, law n°02-03 was promulgated in Morocco and was identified as a concession to European demands for a stricter law on migration issues. Since then, and despite a new Moroccan migration policy initiated in 2013 , an increased repression at the borders targeting Black people has been observed. The practices of “hot return” at the barriers, carried out in conjunction with Spanish law enforcement agents and which we discuss further on in this chapter, have become recurrent.\n\nThrough its cooperation with Spain and the EU, Morocco is often described as “Europe’s gendarme”, a simplistic and Eurocentric view in which EU policies are unilaterally imposed on Morocco. This characterisation must be nuanced. It is important to recognise the way in which Morocco exercises its agency within this asymmetric relation, and has developed a genuine migration diplomacy that navigates between constraints and opportunities. As we shall see for the year 2022, Moroccan involvement in the repression of the borders of Ceuta and Melilla fluctuates considerably, depending on the state of Moroccan-Spanish and Moroccan-European diplomatic relations and the advantages negotiated. Indeed, a precarious and shifting balance between “migratory pressure” and border repression is necessary for the Moroccan and Spanish States to be able to negotiate and influence bilateral diplomatic relations with the EU and its Member States.\n\nThe analysis of diplomatic relations between Morocco and Spain and between Morocco and the European Union over a long period of time, reveals the lives of migrants at the border, and Black Africans in particular, as “pawns” on a political chessboard, as often analysed by migrants themselves.\n\nConsensus around a Black figure of migratory danger\n\nSince the 1990s, Spanish and Moroccan racist and repressive logics have converged towards the repression of Black migrants at the Ceuta and Melilla borders. This convergence, which is taking place despite long-standing and ongoing conflicts between Morocco and Spain over the status of the Spanish-controlled enclaves, is made possible by the fact that Black people are a consensual figure in their respective racist logics.\n\nThe Moroccan racial order has pre-colonial roots – linked to several centuries of slavery of Black people in the Arab-Muslim world . The Spanish racial order, for its part, has a pre-colonial and colonial genealogy – the one we mentioned above for the enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, but which also extends across its vast empire . At the border, these two racist orders overlap and converge around the figure of Black migrants.\n\nThis convergence makes it possible to target Black migrants on both sides of the border, since neither Morocco nor Spain is accused of abusing “sub-Saharan illegal immigrants”. By cracking down on Black migrants, Spain and Morocco can perform their respective sovereignties and their involvement in the fight against so-called illegal immigration, while maintaining their common interests at the border.\n\nVisible because of the racialization to which they are subjected and hounded by law enforcement agents, Black migrants are treated differently from other migrants at the border, and overexposed to violence. Unlike other populations – particularly Moroccans, Algerians, and Syrians, who manage to attempt to cross the border with varying degrees of difficulty – access to the “normal” gates of the Ceuta and Melilla enclaves is in practice impossible for Black people . The closer they get to the borders, the more they encounter forms of repression and coercion that specifically target them. As a result, Black people have many more opportunities to be subjected to violence and to die than other people in exile who try to cross these borders. In the face of the repression that targets them, Black migrants organise themselves at the border and beyond, in particular by forming migrant-led organisations.\n\nAnti-Blackness at the border, from daily harassment to massacres. The case of the Nador-Melilla area.\n\nWhile Black people may be subject to migration controls over a large part of Morocco , the closer they are to the borders of Ceuta and Melilla, the greater the controls.\n\nViolence specifically targeting Black people is particularly noticeable in the region around the Moroccan town of Nador, close to Melilla. Here, the fight against so-called illegal immigration is described as a “hunt for Black men” by migrants who suffer from it and for whom the border constitutes “a racist system” . As the AMDH-Nador denounced on social networks in 2017: “Whether or not they are regularised, whether or not they are students, whether or not they have a tourist visa, people are arrested, even inside their homes, on the basis of a single criterion: the black colour of their skin”.\n\nState and racist repression operates at every stage of the trajectory of Black people in this border zone, from their arrival in the region to their attempt to cross. We analyse each of these stages in turn.\n\nArriving in Nador, being hunted\n\nArriving in the region usually by bus, migrants generally get off before Nador, because of the high risk of being checked or arrested as soon as they set foot in the town. The Moroccan auxiliary forces, military support forces usually responsible for maintaining law and order in the Kingdom, have a specific mission in border areas. In Nador, the work of these soldiers is mainly focused on migration control. Since 2015, special units have been dedicated to tracking down “sub-Saharans”, as reported by migrants and AMDH members observing the situation on site. As a result, people can be arrested on the basis of their appearance at any time. This is why people immediately head for the migrant camps located far from urban centres and in the forest.\n\nHiding, surviving, and organising in forest camps\n\nTo try to escape the hunt which targets them and cross the border, people from Central and West Africa have built camps in the forests close to the border. For a long time, the Gourougou camp – located on the mountain of the same name and close to the Melilla barriers – concentrated the majority of Central and West African nationals present in Nador. However, over the years and as a result of the repression, the camps have been dispersed and moved further away from the border, making survival and organisational conditions increasingly difficult. Two types of camp can be distinguished in the border forests: those where people plan to cross by sea or by car, with a mixed gender population, and those from which (almost exclusively) men attempt to cross the barriers by land. The social organisation of these different types of camps is similar, with camp leaders and both relations of power and solidarity between them and the rest of the people wishing to cross the border. In and through these various encampments, which are more or less ephemeral, Black people contest, negotiate and occupy space where no legitimate space is provided for them.\n\nMilitary harassment and raids in the forest\n\nHowever, migrants are not safe in the camps where they hide and from where they organise their passage. The repeated and unannounced interventions by the auxiliary forces in the forest, particularly in the early hours of the morning, make daily life unbearable and exhausting for those affected. In the forest camps, there is no access to drinking water, hygiene facilities or refreshment points. The “forest is for animals, not people”, as those encamped on the Moroccan side have been lamenting for years . The security harassment carried out in particular by the Moroccan auxiliary forces also takes the form of the regular destruction of camps by arson.\n\nTheft of migrants’ belongings, in particular phones and money, and the destruction of identity documents, residence permits or papers relating to an asylum application, are frequent practices carried out by the auxiliary forces. Sexual assaults by soldiers on women in the camps are also regularly reported.\n\nRepression of attempts to cross the barriers at Melilla\n\nThe time-space of the most intense repression to which Black people are exposed is that of the border crossing, through which they try to exercise the freedom of movement that they are legally denied.\n\nWhile other, non-Black, populations manage to access the “normal” entry gates to the enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, as a result of the repression targeting them it is impossible in practice for Black people to do so and therefore to submit an asylum application at the dedicated office – which has been located at the Beni-Ansar border crossing since 2015 .\n\nThe Spanish authorities know perfectly well that Black people cannot arrive at border crossings posts, given the hunt for Black people organised by the Moroccan authorities as part of their collaboration in the fight against immigration to Spain/Europe. This segregation of border crossing methods is recognised and described by law enforcement officers. In 2015, the colonel of the Guardia Civil in Melilla explained to an association delegation:\n\n“There are a number of entry routes used by sub-Saharan Africans: jumping the fence, using boats at sea, hiding in vehicles. Unlike the Syrians, who go through the border checkpoint, usually with forged or stolen passports. Here, yes, there are whites and blacks, sub-Saharan can’t come by walking”.\n\nMembers of the Association of Civil Guards (AUGC) working at the Melilla gates confirmed this observation:\n\n“There really is a question of whites and blacks. That’s politics, giving priority to some people and not others. Why does the issue focus on certain people of colour and not others? In fact, no Black person is going to apply for asylum because they’re not going to be allowed to approach just because they’re Black, whereas if they’re Syrian… The asylum office at the border: it’s just to shut people up. Why open an asylum office at the border if people can’t go near it? Come back in four years’ time and ask whether a black person was able to claim asylum. It’s all a big lie(…).”\n\nThis discrimination has also been recognised by several institutions at national and European level: in 2015 Spain was denounced before the United Nations for violating the right to non-discrimination. The complaint by the René Cassin Committee, an NGO of independent lawyers, contrasted the appropriate reception of Syrian asylum seekers with the impossibility of access to the Ceuta and Melilla asylum offices for “sub-Saharan Africans”, highlighting the racial discrimination against the latter. In 2016, Spain’s Ombudsman stated that “sub-Saharan Africans” do not have access to the border posts of the two enclaves and therefore do not have access to asylum procedures. The representatives of the Secretary General of the Council of Europe for Migration and Refugees came to the same conclusion after his visit to Melilla in September 2018. This is also what the Council of Europe’s Commissioner for Human Rights said in 2022 after her visit to Spain: “In practice, it seems that there is no other way of entering Melilla and requesting protection from the competent authorities than by swimming or jumping the fence, at the risk of one’s life”.\n\nThe impossibility for Black migrants to cross at the border crossing formally established for this purpose is used by the authorities to criminalise their mobility and delegitimise their asylum applications.\n\nIn the face of repression, three main tactics have been developed by nationals of Central and West Africa to attempt to cross the border in spite of everything. The most fortunate attempt entry – with less risk to their lives – via a border post, caged in the double bottom of a vehicle. Otherwise, they have to attempt for a fee the sea crossing – usually on an inflatable zodiac – either to one of the enclaves or directly to the Spanish mainland. Crossing the barrier is the means of entry used by the least well-off, as it is “free”. Attempting to cross the Melilla border fence is one of the main tactics used by Black men – women, considered less physically fit, are more likely to use the sea route.\n\nWhen attempting to cross the barriers, which have become increasingly dangerous as the architecture of the border has been strengthened, the men are not supposed to show any signs of aggression towards the soldiers who assault them. Numerous past examples show that those who dared to defend themselves, using stones or other objects, were immediately put in prison for “criminal organisation”. Against them, the law enforcement agents carry and use weapons, and sometimes even kill migrants, to defend the border. The accounts of the men who tried to cross the barriers at Melilla all converge on the same analysis of the violence used against them: it is often described as intentionally excessive – whether it comes from Moroccan or Spanish forces – and injuries and deaths are frequently the result .\n\nHot returns after crossing the border fence\n\nThose who manage to cross the border fence surrounding Melilla are not immune from immediate and summary expulsions to Morocco, and this despite the provisions of international and European Union law.\n\nUnder international and EU law, once migrants have crossed the Spanish border, the duty of the Spanish officers is to facilitate the registration of potential asylum claims, while they are forbidden from handing back the migrants to Moroccan forces, in view of the principle of non-refoulement and the prohibition of torture.\n\nHowever, in Ceuta and Melilla, the official role of the Guardia Civil has long been to prevent entry at all costs. To implement this role and evade their legal obligations, Spanish authorities have developed the concept of an “operational border” or “frontera chicle” (chewing gum border), which, as Ayten Gündoğdu argues, constitutes “a legal fiction that turns the border from a fixed line into a continuously fluctuating one”.\n\nThus, the borderline is defined in each instance on an ad hoc basis, depending on the situation the Guardia Civil faces at the border fence structure. Internal Guardia Civil documents obtained in the context of criminal proceedings for the death of migrants revealed that there, the “operational border” was defined by the most inner fence of the border fence structure for land entries, and the first line of defence of standing officers for maritime entries. However, in practice, only people who manage to reach the Temporary Stay Centre for Immigrants (CETI) are sheltered from immediate, summary expulsions.\n\nUnder this concept of border control, which severs “the close connection between territory and jurisdiction that is central to modern conceptions of law and politics” to undermine migrants’ “rights to have rights”, the Guardia Civil is able to intercept and systematically and immediately deport them to Morocco by handing them over to the Moroccan authorities through the border fence structure. This practice has been denounced for years by civil society organisations and legal academics for its illegality and the violence used by the forces that carry it out.\n\nOn 1 April 2015, the Spanish government grounded this informal practice which was known as devoluciones en caliente (“hot returns”) in Spanish legislation, renaming it rechazos en frontera (“border returns”), a strategy designed to give legal backing to illegal practices. Though the law clearly states that these “returns” must comply with international law, it provides no safeguards for the same, leading to an absurd situation of legal provisions theoretically reaffirming basic fundamental rights but practically there to circumvent them.\n\nThe practice was further cemented by the European Court of Human Rights’s stand in ND and NT v Spain (which we discuss further on in this chapter), where the Court refused to apply the safeguards of the European Convention on Human Rights on the grounds that the migrants were “culpable” for crossing the border irregularly.\n\nThus, the practice of immediate and summary expulsions to Morocco remains unchanged and continues on a regular basis at the borders of the two enclaves, both on land and at sea. The principle of non-refoulement (established by the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees) and the prohibition of torture, as enshrined in Spanish law, are not respected, since even refugees are not given the possibility to seek protection. This practice is also in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nIn addition to being against international law, these “returns at the border” are also carried out in the least dignifying way, in complete disregard of the bodies of those returned, with unsafe and non-homologated use of anti-riot material (such as pepper spray directly in the faces of persons barely stable on fences 6 metres high), or by carrying people out of Spain in extremely dangerous and painful positions, even when these persons are unconscious, sometimes even dragging their faces on the ground. The dehumanisation of Black persons at the Spanish-Moroccan border was noted by one of the ECtHR judges in a concurring opinion: “To allow people to be rejected at land borders and returned without assessing their individual claims amounts to treating them like animals. Migrants are not cattle that can be driven away like this.”\n\nAfter deportations to Morocco: arrests, detention and forced eviction far from the border\n\nThose who are intercepted or deported are locked up in the Nador region before being forcibly moved by bus to different regions of Morocco, far from the border. They can be held for up to a week in police and gendarmerie cells or in unofficial locations such as the Arekmane summer camp . Without judicial review or legal procedure, those arrested are photographed and fingerprinted before the authorities remove them by bus to southern Morocco.\n\nMapping the continuum of anti-Black violence\n\nThe long-standing documentation and analysis by civil society actors and researchers reveals a continuum of violence targeting Black people, before, across and after the Nador-Melilla border.\n\nWe have collected, analysed spatially and visualised a number of data sources which, using geostatistical analysis methods, make it possible to account for the everyday nature and spatial distribution of the various forms taken by repression at the border, as well as its racist nature.\n\nSince 2014, the AMDH-Nador has been the human rights organisation that most regularly and closely documents and analyses the repression of Black migrants at this border. In addition to its annual reports, the AMDH-Nador has a strong presence on social networks, particularly Facebook. We have listed all the association’s Facebook posts referring to the various forms of repression at the border, then after categorising, quantifying and geolocating them, we mapped them. Although the AMDH-Nador’s data is not exhaustive, it demonstrates the pervasiveness of repression at the border zone, as well as its spatial distribution, thus giving a visual and analytical form to the reality experienced and described by Black migrants for many years.\n\nInteractive mapping platform showing the pervasiveness of different forms of repression since 2014 based on Facebook posts by AMDH-Nador. Border Forensics, 2024.View full screen\n\nFurthermore, we were able to statistically demonstrate the differential trajectories of migrants at the border according to their origin described above, and in particular to statistically demonstrate the systematic exclusion of Black people from safe migration areas via the Beni-Ensar border crossing, where it should be possible to submit an asylum application. Between 2015 and 2018, only 35 Black people out of more than 524 asylum seekers (7%) were able to file an asylum application at the Beni-Ensar border crossing, whereas more than 80% of people from South-West Asia were able to lodge their asylum application at this crossing, without being subjected to lethal migratory trajectories.\n\nOur statistical analysis also reveals that Black migrants are overexposed to violence and death in their journeys, which are made dangerous by this exclusion. Indeed, the analysis of data concerning arrivals in Melilla (Spanish ministry of Interior, APDHA, CEAR) and deaths at the border (IOM) clearly reveals the over-representation of Black people among the deaths at the border. Although these data are not exhaustive, since 2014, the IOM has counted at least 892 people who have died at the border, 406 of whom are Black, representing 46 percent of documented deaths, while this population represents less than 20% of documented arrivals in Melilla. This mortality rate among people attempting to cross the border appears to be unevenly distributed between migrants of different nationalities: this rate is close to 0 for individuals from South-West Asia, and is four times higher for black individuals than for those from Maghreb. It should be noted that these estimates are conservative: the number of people deceased is a minimum observed. The “Unknown” category in the death data likely covers additional Black individuals. Moreover, the arrivals documented by Spain may be overestimated: a person turned away may be counted multiple times in the arrivals. These three factors indicate that the statistics produced are underestimated: it is likely that the over-representation of Black individuals who have died at the border is even greater in reality. These disparities in the death toll according to the origin of the individuals are not a matter of chance: they reflect the racialization of the border.\n\nElsa Tyszler concludes from her qualitative analysis that “the over-exposure of Black people to violence and death demonstrates the extent to which anti-Black racism structures Moroccan-Spanish policies and practices of control and repression at work on the borders”. Our geostatistical analysis corroborates the results of the qualitative analyses carried out to date, and highlights the link between different forms of repression and violence specifically targeting Black people.\n\nThe analysis of the day-to-day violence that takes place on the borders of Ceuta and Melilla is particularly important, as it receives far less attention than the spikes in violence that have punctuated the last 20 years. Among the most high-profile cases were the massacres in 2005, which left at least eleven people dead, and hundreds injured on the borders of Ceuta and Melilla. Another prominent case is that of February 2014, at the border beach of Tarajal (Ceuta), where at least 14 people lost their lives and dozens were injured when the Guardia Civil attacked a group of migrants who were already struggling to stay afloat by shooting over 100 rubber bullets as well as several gas canisters at them within 21 minutes, thus creating lethal conditions for them. The massacre of 24 June 2022 at the Nador-Melilla border, which saw a spectacular outburst of violence, is part of this continuity. However, the everyday racist violence that normalises anti-Black racism and creates the structural conditions that make these massacres possible is often occluded. Our analysis attempts to analyse both the massacre of 24 June and the production of the massacrability of Black people at the border, of which daily racist violence is an essential element.\n\nDespite demands for accountability, impunity persists and grows stronger\n\nDespite repeated and documented cases of lethal violence and violations of human rights by both Moroccan and Spanish law enforcement agents, and despite several complaints lodged by the victims and their families with the support of civil society associations, these practices have not been sanctioned by the law and continue to be perpetrated with complete impunity. This is another key factor in the perpetuation and normalisation of violence against Black migrants, which makes the massacres that punctuate the history of the Nador-Melilla border possible.\n\nThe fight for accountability at the borders of Ceuta and Melilla has been marked by the tireless efforts of civil society to obtain justice in front of both national courts and international instances. We have collected available information on attempts to seek accountability for human rights violations at the Ceuta and Melilla borders and analysed them together with the ECCHR, reconstructing the key stages and outcomes for each case. Although we have analysed several cases, our list of cases is extensive but not exhaustive, as a results of the limits of access to information concerning national criminal proceedings. In relation to those, information is not public and only accessible if made available by civil society actors or if details of said proceedings are published in judgements of international instances, such as the United Nations Committees or the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nThe Archive of Impunity | Interactive timeline displaying key stages and outcomes for attempts to seek accountability at the Ceuta and Melilla borders for the period 2014-2022. Border Forensics, 2024. View full screen\n\nThe first case we have identified is Sonko v. Spain, concerning the drowning of a Senegalese man during a border control operation led by the Guardia Civil in 2007. While it predates the 2014-2022 period of focus of our study, it is important to mention because it illustrates a pattern that will be repeated time and again. Although an investigation had to be open since the incident involved the finding of a deceased body, it would have been swiftly closed by the investigative judge, had it not been for the intervention of the family through the Spanish Ombudsperson (Defensora del Pueblo) and the Spanish Attorney General. Despite the re-opening of a national process, the investigation was characterised by stalling, denial of jurisdiction and a refusal to include survivors and the family of the deceased, who thus took the case in front of the UN Committee Against Torture (CAT) with the help of civil society in October 2008. Although the national proceeding was archived, the case led to Spain being condemned by CAT in November 2011. Despite this victory, the CAT’s recommendations on the reopening of the investigation and the payment of damages to the family of the deceased will be ignored by Spain. The stages and outcomes in this case reveal in a striking way the lack of legal remedy at the Spanish level, but also the lack of implementation of judgements by the Spanish authorities even when accountability is found at a higher level.\n\nSubsequent national investigations will follow similar patterns as the Sonko v. Spain case. Thus, the emblematic case of the Playa del Tarajal presents with the longest proceedings as to violence and death at the Ceuta and Melilla border, namely from 2014 until 2022. The judicial investigation is also characterised by an initial denial of jurisdiction, followed by the exclusion of the survivors and of the families of the deceased, and the unwillingness to investigate and clarify the most basic of facts. After a series of dramatic closings – including right after the indictment of officers and a decision to open the trial phase – the case will be definitely archived by May 2022. In that process, due to the tirelessness of civil society, some information will be obtained and 2 out of 3 survivors will be heard as witnesses, though their testimonies will be dismissed as worthless on classically anti-Black stereotypes, such as “presenting an attitude”. The archival of the case has been challenged both nationally in front of the Constitutional Court and internationally in front of the UN CAT. Both proceedings are pending.\n\n2014 was also the year which saw a series of expulsions giving rise to several related cases, running in parallel in front of both national criminal courts and the European Court of Human Rights, including the defining case of ND and NT v. Spain, which will entrench Spanish impunity at the highest European level (see below). Thus, following three events of expulsions in June, August and October 2014, NGOs filed criminal complaints in front of the judiciary in Melilla, leading to the opening of investigations against both regular officers and the head of the Melilla Guardia Civil. Here too, following the grounding of the practice of hot returns in national law through legislative reform in April 2015, both streams of cases will be archived after having obtained charges against the head of the Guardia Civil in Melilla. In the meantime, three of the persons expelled during these instances of expulsions mentioned above filed cases against Spain in front of the European Court of Human Rights, leading to the respective cases of ND and NT v. Spain and Doumbe Nnabuchi (Danny) v. Spain. ND and NT will first result in anunanimous condemnation of Spain in 2017, to then dramatically take a U-turn and lead to a unanimous legitimisation of the policy by the ECtHR’s Grand Chamber in 2020. A year later, 3 judges decide that Doumbe Nnabuchi – together with a further case concerning hot returns in Ceuta, MB and RA v. Spain – are simply inadmissible and will not be further examined by the ECtHR, on the basis of the 2020 ND and NT judgment. Subsequent attempts of accountability in front of the EctHR will be dismissed even quicker. Nationally, the ND and NT Grand Chamber judgement also led to the Spanish Constitutional Court refusing to find the legislative reform entrenching the practice in national law unconstitutional.\n\nDespite these setbacks, the condemnation of Spain in Sonko v. Spain by the UN Committee Against Torture (CAT) stands, as much as that by the UN Committee for the Rights of the Child in DD v. Spain for the hot return of an unaccompanied minor. In that case, Spain explicitly refused to comply with the UN Committee’s recommendations to compensate the child for his unlawful treatment and take measures to ensure that unaccompanied minors be identified and protected at the Ceuta and Melilla border, referring to the ND and NT ECtHR judgment as entrenching the legality of these practices in the framework of international human rights law. This conclusion is erroneous, and the condemnations of Spain stand to confirm that these practices are in violation of Spain’s obligations under international human rights law.\n\nOverall, our analysis of the attempts to seek truth and justice by victims of border violence reveals that instead of these practices being curbed, the impunity for violations has allowed practices that are contrary to the standards governing the rights of migrants to be consolidated and institutionalised. In particular, the hot returns carried out at border barriers, without any consideration being given to migrants’ requests for protection, have gradually been formalised in Spanish policies and laws, and partly legitimised by European jurisprudence. The ECtHR’s backing of these practices has further aggravated the situation and contributed to the conditions leading to the 24 June Melilla Massacre. This regime of impunity grounded in the denial of migrants’ s fundamental “right to have rights” plays a central role in consolidating the conditions of possibility of violence at the border, including in its most extreme form as witnessed during the 24 June 2022 massacre.\n\nThis chapter has demonstrated the colonial dimension of this border over the long term. Looking back at the long history of the occupation of Melilla has enabled us to reveal the long-standing racial and colonial dimension of this border. By analysing the evolution of legislations, policies, and practices, we have been able to grasp the racist nature of the anti-migratory repression that was put in place around the enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla from the 1990s, and then from the 2000s onwards on the Moroccan side. Although Black migrants are not the only ones to suffer from this repression, they are the most visible targets and are exposed to exacerbated forms of violence.\n\nThe processes of perpetual racialisation that have been taking place for several decades, through the manhunts specifically targeting Black people in the Nador region, the inhuman and degrading treatment in the forest camps, the paroxysmic violence of law enforcement agents at the barriers, the persistence of hot returns, and the perpetuation of a regime of impunity for the many deaths and violations, demonstrate the coloniality of the condition of Black migrants that is maintained at the border. As we shall discuss in Chapter 3, the regime of racial domination instituted on both sides of the border against Black people can be described in terms of “border apartheid”.\n\nThe denial of Black migrants’ shared humanity through every-day racism and violence on the one hand, and the denial of their rights through the regime of impunity on the other, have combined to define a population – Black migrants – as massacrable. The massacrability of Black people at the border has created the conditions for several massacres that have marked the history of the border, culminating in the massacre of 24 June 2022.\n\nWhile this massacre was made possible by a structural condition built up over the long term, it materialised in a specific conjuncture in the diplomatic relations between Morocco, Spain, and the European Union. As we show in the next chapter, these changing diplomatic relations played an essential role in modulating the intensity of anti-Black violence at the border.\n\nCHAPTER 2. CONJUNCTURE: 2021-2022, THE EBB AND FLOW OF MOROCCAN-SPANISH BORDER COLLABORATION\n\nThe repression of Black migrants on both sides of the border has been a constant feature for several decades. Its intensity however varies over time depending on the state of diplomatic relations between Morocco and Spain and between Morocco and the EU. The massacre of 24 June 2022 illustrates precisely these diplomatic oscillations influencing repressive practices. To understand the unprecedented intensity of the violence unleashed onto Black migrants on the 24 June 2022, we must reconstruct the shifts in diplomatic relations and repression that preceded the massacre.\n\nSince the 2000s, two scenarios have emerged at the borders of Ceuta and Melilla. The first is that of good diplomatic relations between Morocco and Spain, as well as with the EU. Morocco then puts on a show of cooperation, which materialises in increased repression of migrants at the border. This was the case in autumn 2005, when deadly peaks of repression took place just before a meeting of the Spanish and Moroccan prime ministers in Seville. Also in 2018, when Morocco signed the fisheries agreement with the EU, a record number of arrests and security operations were recorded in border areas. However, for Morocco to demonstrate its willingness to cooperate through repression, there must be a sufficient degree of migratory “pressure” at the borders, even if it means encouraging attempts to cross the Ceuta and Melilla barriers.\n\nThe second scenario is that of diplomatic crises. The “tap” – as facilitating or preventing migrant crossings is metaphorically called – at the gates of Ceuta and Melilla is a strategy regularly used by Morocco when there are disputes with Spain. Morocco reacts vigorously whenever the Spanish government or crown attempts to trivialise its presence in Ceuta and Melilla, which for Morocco remain colonial enclaves. Because of the conflict over the Western Sahara, the reaction is just as strong to any announcement of a gesture or contact between Spain and the Polisario Front or a Sahrawi representative. Morocco then lets migrants through more easily, as illustrated by the examples of what were described as “massive” entries into Ceuta and Melilla in 2014, 2018, and again in 2021.\n\nIn these changing political conjunctures, and the resulting variable balance between encouragement and repression, migrants are instrumentalised. Despite this, migrants maintain their capacity for action and implement their own strategies for crossing the border, which are irreducible to the political calculation on either side of the border.\n\nMelilla Timeline | Interactive timeline displaying key trends in border crossings and border violence in relation to changing diplomatic relations between Morocco, Spain, and the EU. Border Forensics, 2024. View full screen\n\nWe have analysed the evolution of diplomatic relations between Morocco, Spain, and the EU, as well as various indicators concerning migration dynamics and border repression, in order to better understand the interactions at play. We collected data on arrivals (Ministerio del Interior) in Melilla and deaths (IOM) in the Melilla border area between 2014 and 2023 and disaggregated them by location in order to distinguish between arrivals and deaths that took place on land or at sea. This provides a more accurate picture of the changing spatial nature of migration dynamics and types of repression. It should be noted that from 2014 to end of 2016, only an average monthly value for arrivals could be consulted. In addition, the database of deaths shows us a minimum observed in this area: many people who have died have left no trace.\n\nWe also carried out an exhaustive and systematic census of a variety of events linked to the migration context, grouped according to a specific typology: conflicts and politico-diplomatic events as well as economic-political agreements between the EU and Morocco, or Spain and Morocco; inter-governmental funding and legislative developments; legal events linked to complaints lodged by victims of violence at the border. From this inventory, we built a database and assigned a qualitative score expressing the diplomatic (distance-)proximity generated by the events.\n\nAll this data was then represented graphically, allowing us to explore the relationship between the diplomatic relations between the different states and the data on deaths and arrivals at Melilla. By linking this information, we were able to identify several key phases of change in the diplomatic relations between Morocco, Spain and the EU, which have had a significant influence on the dynamics of migration and repression at the border. These distinct phases can be broadly summarised as follows.\n\nBetween 2014 and the end of 2015, diplomatic relations between Morocco and the European Union were strengthened, particularly around the issue of Schengen visas and free trade agreements. The improvement in these relations coincided with an increase in violence against Black migrants, with shipwrecks and raids in the forests of Nador, while a large number of arrivals were recorded in Spain, mainly Syrians in need of international protection.\n\nIn February 2016, a suspension of relations between Morocco and the EU – following a challenge to the Morocco-EU agricultural agreement and Morocco’s national sovereignty over the southern provinces – triggered a period of diplomatic tension and led to Morocco using migration issues as a pressure strategy to influence the EU and Spain in negotiations on the fisheries agreement and on the issue of sovereignty. In terms of migration, this period was marked by an increase in migrant arrivals and asylum applications in Melilla. Migrant deaths remained rare compared with other periods, occurring mainly at sea.\n\nIn 2018, negotiations resumed and led to the signing of new agreements, reflecting a shift from tension to collaboration. At a time when Spain had become the main entry point for migrants to Europe, Morocco positioned itself as a key partner for the EU on migration issues. At the European Council of 28 June 2018, the EU stated that it would support Morocco in particular, to prevent “illegal migration”. During this period, an increasing number of migrant deaths were observed, both at sea and on land, reflecting the intensification of repression on land.\n\nFrom June 2019 to March 2020, in a context of calmer relations between Morocco and the European Union following the signing of the 2018 fisheries agreement, migration trends underwent significant changes. The good relations allowed Morocco to implement a major crackdown at the land border, documented by the AMDH. During this period, crossings to the Canary Islands intensified again, and there was also an increase in arrivals by sea at Melilla, as well as deaths during these attempts.\n\nAt the beginning of 2020, while all government action was suspended to focus on the fight against the coronavirus, there was no relenting in migration and border controls. The very tight controls in the north of Morocco pushed people wishing to reach Europe to take the Canary route. While diplomatic tensions were not explicit, the tightening of border controls lead to a large number of migrant deaths by the end of 2020.\n\nIn May 2021, the hospitalisation in Spain of Brahim Ghali, a Saharawi military leader, was seen as an act of aggression by Morocco. This period of growing tension was marked by an increase in the number of arrivals at Melilla, but fewer deaths, as Morocco let migrants pass more easily.\n\nIn April 2022, Spain’s recognition of Morocco’s autonomy plan for the Sahara put an end to the diplomatic crisis between Morocco and Spain. Against this backdrop of Spanish concessions, cooperation on migration issues was re-established between Morocco and Spain. This led to a period of sporadic arrivals and a large number of deaths due to unprecedented violence at the Melilla border – the emblematic case being the massacre of 24 June 2022.\n\nThe analysis of the 2014-2022 period thus shows that while migration dynamics and repression at the Nador-Melilla border are influenced by multiple factors and complex interactions, the changing diplomatic relations between Morocco, Spain and the EU play a key role in fluctuations in the intensity of violence at the border. We now must analyse in more detail the changing political conjuncture during the 2021-2022 phase, and how this translated at the border into a rapid oscillation between a period of laissez-faire (May 2021-March 2022) and intensified repression (April 2022), culminating in the massacre of 24 June 2022.\n\nMay 2021 – March 2022: diplomatic breakdown and facilitated border crossings\n\nIn May 2021, Brahim Ghali, the Sahrawi military leader, was admitted to a Spanish hospital. The “humanitarian” argument put forward by Madrid at the time was deemed inadmissible by Rabat, which promised that this decision would have “consequences”. This led to the lifting of border controls by Morocco at Ceuta on 18 and 19 May 2021, allowing the entry of more than 8,000 people, most of them young Moroccans.\n\nIn response to these large-scale arrivals by land and sea, the Spanish government deployed its army, and Morocco was accused by the Spanish authorities of having loosened its control of the border . But for the Moroccan authorities, this crisis was primarily Spain’s responsibility , illustrating the diplomatic tug-of-war between the two neighbours. This is a moment of diplomatic rupture between Morocco and Spain, as illustrated by the departure of the Moroccan ambassador from Madrid.\n\nThis diplomatic rupture also influenced the degree of repression to which Black migrants were subjected. The years 2020-2021 marked by the Covid-19 pandemic saw a drastic drop in attempts to cross the borders of Ceuta and Melilla. Despite this, Black migrants continued to live in camps in the border area, as demonstrated by the tragedy of a Nigerian woman called Happiness and her three children who were found burnt to death in their shelter in January 2022 in Nador . From March 2022 onwards, African migrants once again attempted to cross the border at Melilla.\n\nIn March 2022, four attempts to cross the border barriers of Nador-Melilla took place in one week: on 2, 3, 4 and 8 March. When these attempts were made, diplomatic relations between Morocco and Spain were still clouded. The AMDH Nador observed on the ground that the Black migrants had easily settled in the Gourougou forests before these attempts. Here are a few details – based on information provided by the Spanish authorities – concerning these four days:\n\nOn 2 March, around 2,500 people tried to pass through the barrier –according to information from the government delegation in Melilla . According to the Spanish authorities, this was the largest attempt ever recorded. 491 people managed to enter on the Spanish side that day.\n\nThe following day, 3 March, another attempt was made by around 1,200 people, 380 of whom managed to get through .\n\nOn 4 March, another attempt was made by around 1,000 people, but this time none managed to enter.\n\nOn 8 March, another 1,000 people tried to cross, but 400 managed to enter Melilla.\n\nIn total, more than 1,240 people managed to enter Melilla following these four attempts, and the violent repression carried out by the Guardia Civil was denounced on the Spanish side. Although 31 injured people were received by the emergency unit at Nador hospital, no deaths or disappearances were recorded.\n\nSeveral elements draw our attention to the specific circumstances surrounding these attempted crossings. As noted by the AMDH-Nador and various Spanish media, the four attempts took place in broad daylight – a rare occurrence, as they usually take place at night or in the early hours of the morning. Each time, they took place on the same part of the border fence between the Barrio Chino and Beni Ansar border posts, which at the same is the only area where the border fence is not yet equipped with so-called “inverted combs” structures installed to prevent the climbing of the fence.\n\nFurthermore, the number of people making the attempts is very large. Finally, facing the migrants, the Moroccan military force deployed around these attempts in March 2022 was small compared with other attempts. Taken together, these factors suggest that the controls on the Moroccan side were relatively permissive. In fact, M., a Chadian national we met who attempted to cross at the time, explains: “When relations between Morocco and Spain are tense, it’s the officers who suggest we cross.”\n\nOn the Spanish side, the measures deployed during these 4 attempts in March are, on the contrary, very significant . The Spanish authorities are alarmed by these attempts at illegal entry through the barriers, which are the largest ever recorded in Melilla. The Guardia Civil itself calls on the Minister of the Interior to increase the number of its staff and their equipment, and to step up the militarisation of the border . In the wake of the early March 2022 crossings, the Spanish Ministry of Interior reintroduced the possibility of using anti-riot materials at borders.\n\nWhile the Spanish authorities are on high alert, the AMDH-Nador notes that even after four attempts to cross the border, the situation remains fairly calm on the Moroccan side of the border. This allowed hundreds of migrants to settle in the two main camps in the forest in the days and weeks that followed. But the situation changed abruptly in mid-April, following the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between Morocco and Spain.\n\nFrom April 2022, Moroccan-Spanish reconciliation, and the resumption of fierce repression at the border.\n\nIn April 2022, after more than ten months of diplomatic crisis, Morocco and Spain stage their reconciliation and jointly declare the start of a “new stage” in relations between the two countries . Madrid has just revised its historic “neutrality” position on the former Spanish colony of Western Sahara to align itself with the Moroccan position. For Spain, one of the main aims of re-establishing relations with Morocco is to secure its “cooperation” in controlling “illegal immigration” , particularly around Ceuta and Melilla. It is certainly with the aim of demonstrating this renewed “cooperation” that, from April 2022, Moroccan authorities will once again intensify the repression of Black migrants in the area of Nador.\n\nAs repression intensifies once again, the composition in terms of nationality of the migrants present in the forests of the Nador region has changed, with a greater presence of people from Sudan and South Sudan. This higher prevalence is borne out by UNHCR data on asylum applications in Melilla. While people from Sudan and southern Sudan represented only 0.49% of applications in 2020, this proportion has risen to 7% in 2021, and 13% in 2022, with 411 applications submitted.\n\nMany of the survivors of the massacre we met during our investigation come from different regions of Sudan and Southern Sudan. While some left Sudan during different phases of the conflicts that have affected the country for more than 20 years, others left the country following the repression of the 2018 revolution, as they were threatened by the regime because of their political commitment, particularly within the student movement. All transited through Libya, where they experienced extreme forms of racist violence in detention and failed attempts to cross the Mediterranean. A number of them told us that they had gone to Morocco with the aim of seeking asylum or crossing to Europe. However, in Morocco, the Sudanese quickly acquired the reputation of being a more rebellious group than other nationals, and therefore more difficult to control, for which they were blamed in order to justify the repression to which they were subjected (see box). One of the survivors we met described the arrival of Sudanese in the Nador region in the spring of 2022 as follows: “Recently, many Sudanese have come to settle in various Moroccan cities such as Rabat, Casablanca etc. Instead of staying here in Morocco without work, we decided to all get together to cross the borders.” – M.\n\nAs the AMDH-Nador notes , from mid-April 2022, in the wake of the reconciliation between Morocco and Spain, law enforcement agents were heavily mobilised in the Nador region. “For 18 days, attacks were almost a daily occurrence, in an attempt to dislodge the migrants, who did not understand this sudden turnaround in the behavior of the Moroccan authorities, who now wanted to chase them out of the camps.” The association points out that, unlike previous periods when only auxiliary forces were mobilised for this type of operation, this time all law enforcement bodies are on the ground, under the supervision and with the personal participation of the Governor of Nador and the commanders of the gendarmerie and auxiliary forces .\n\nAccording to AMDH Nador , from May 23 onwards, repression increased in the forests and violent confrontations between the law enforcement agents and migrants took place at the camps. The Moroccan forces used tear gas, while the migrants tried to defend themselves by throwing stones. From late May to mid-June, Black migrants were hunted down and arrested throughout the area. The use of drones is observed by the migrants. Camps were destroyed, and goods and food were confiscated or burnt by law enforcement agents. Over the next few days, some 1,500 migrants re-grouped on the heights of the Lakhmis Akdim and Bekoya camps .\n\nWith the Lakhmis Akdim and Bekoya camps almost 20 kilometers from the Melilla barrier, repression intensifies. The authorities warn shopkeepers in the vicinity of the camps not to sell anything to the Black migrants – including food – and are organizing the cutting off of the water supply to the fountain in Bekoya, where a large number of the migrants were obtaining their supplies . This demonstrates the Moroccan authorities’ strategy, already used in the past in phases of repression, of starving and thirsting migrants so that they leave the camps .\n\nOn June 18, another particularly virulent operation by the law enforcement agents took place. The migrants fought back, injuring members of the Moroccan law enforcement agents . According to the Moroccan authorities, several members of the auxiliary forces were kidnapped, then released the same day after negotiations with the migrants .\n\nThese violent clashes force the migrants to leave the camps. On the night of June 18-19, hundreds of migrants moved to the southern part of Mount Gourougou – close to the douar of Izenouden, around 6km from the Melilla barrier. When they arrived in this area, they were again attacked by the law enforcement agents. A., a Sudanese national we met, recounts:\n\n“On June 18, we were attacked in the morning in the forest. There were 15 or 16 law enforcement vehicles. They were throwing stones and sticks at us. So we left this area and went to the Gourougou mountain. We walked for 24 hours until our legs swelled up from the march. We were very tired. But then again, at Gourougou, a lot of Moroccan law enforcement agents came. There were a lot of them, and there were planes up there too. They threw tear gas, sound bombs, rubber bullets and stones at us. Journalists were shooting videos and taking photos. Many of us were injured.”\n\nA.\n\nThe operations of repression continued for five days in Gourougou, until June 23, when the repression of migrants in their informal camps reached a climax.\n\n23 June 2022, climax of the repression and ultimatum\n\nOn 23 June, the people gathered at Gourougou woke up surrounded by soldiers.\n\nThe impressive deployment of law enforcement agents and the clashes with migrants that ensued as these tried to defend themselves were documented in footage published anonymously but probably filmed by Moroccan law enforcement agents.\n\nThe scale of the operation is also conveyed by the analysis of satellite image taken at 11:09 UTC that day, i.e. 12:09 local time.\n\nWhen the law enforcement agents approached, stones were thrown between the migrants and the agents, who fired rubber bullets and tear gas. Several people also reported seeing a plane spraying gas. According to testimonies we have collected, many people were seriously injured. A group in the mountains set up its own care centre for the injured. Meanwhile, a fire started spreading, which was confirmed by several sources, including the satellite images we have analysed.\n\nThe survivors of the massacre we met believe that the fire in this part of the forest was either started directly by the authorities or was triggered by tear gas and rubber bullets. The dry grass in these forests may have made it easier for the fire to start and spread. The migrants tried to stop the fire, but were unable to do so, as Z. explains:\n\nThe clashes around the Gourougou camp lasted several hours, from morning until late afternoon, according to eyewitness accounts. During these operations, six people were arrested by the Moroccan authorities, while a group of migrants decided to catch apprehend 3 members of the law enforcement agents, including a woman who was quickly released. The migrants kept the other two officers with them, with the aim of imposing negotiations to stop the repression by the law enforcement agents.Z., a witness to these events, recounts:\n\n“There was an old man who was with us. He was reckless. When everyone backed off and started shouting, he stayed there. He ran towards the soldiers, leaned on a stone, and threw himself onto them. Everyone backed away except him. When the young people saw this, they started to encourage each other. They decided to go back to the soldiers and confront them. They said, “Aren’t we men like him?” So they returned for the confrontation. Some of the soldiers had fallen after this person had jumped on them. They started exchanging blows with the soldiers, until most of them withdrew. Some of the soldiers stayed on the mountain. The guys took off their shields and sticks. Then someone said to them: “Consider them war hostages and don’t beat them up”. After the confrontation, the tear gas, the plane filming, and the withdrawal of the soldiers, we saw several ambulances arrive at the bottom of the mountain. Then one of the officers came forward and said he wanted to talk to us. I think he had a loudspeaker.”\n\nNegotiations were then conducted orally. According to the accounts of migrants present at the time, the Moroccan spokesman issued a series of conditions, namely that the migrants had to hand over the wounded officers and the seized equipment of the Moroccan forces. Then they must leave the mountains, or the authorities will come back to deal with them, this time with live ammunition. The spokesman for the law enforcement agents issued an ultimatum, as the people we met told us: “You have 24 hours to leave or we will start using real bullets”.\n\nThe exchange of people “taken hostage” on both sides was organised between the Moroccan authorities and the group of migrants in the Gourougou forest. The group of migrants also returned the equipment that had been seized, and the Moroccan law enforcement agencies withdrew. Witnesses recount what happened next:\n\n“The authorities have told us: you have 24 hours to leave the premises. After 24 hours, the treatment will be different”. At the same time, there was no more food. Hunger and threats. We all ended up in the same place, on the mountain. I sensed that there was fear. The threat of the authorities opening fire contributed to this. With no food or water, there was no reason to stay. At night, we ha"
