        "text": "le français\n\nWhat’s special about French at UMBC?\n\nIn the interdisciplinary MLLI program, French students participate with students of other languages in a common core of three courses that stress linguistic and cultural analysis. Therefore, aside from acquiring proficiency in French language and knowledge of the cultures of France and the French-speaking world ( the Cajuns of Louisiana, the Caribbean, Canada, West Africa…), they also learn about the fascinating dynamics of languages and cultures in general.At UMBC the study of French is part of the major and minor programs of the department of Modern Languages, Linguistics & Intercultural Communication (MLLI). The MLLI faculty, which includes a unique combination of specialists in linguistics, sociology, cultural and literary studies, and pedagogy have been pioneers in developing an interdisciplinary curriculum. Most university language programs focus almost exclusively on language and literature. Not UMBC:\n\nFrench courses address an exciting variety of cultural, sociological, and literary themes. UMBC French students learn about the histories, the cultures, and the social problems of the societies in which French is spoken. Classes in advanced French courses are small and offer the opportunity for individual interaction with professors.\n\nFrench, an International Language\n\nFrench is, after English, the most widely used lingua franca in the world. It has official status in 38 nations stretching from the Pacific (Vanuatu, Polynesia) to Africa (Senegal, Chad), North America (Haiti, Canada,) the Indian Ocean (Mauritius, Reunion), and, of course Europe (France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland). In addition, it is a widely used second language in places as far apart as Argentina, Morocco, Romania, and Vietnam. In other words, French is an extremely useful tool for anyone considering international contacts of any kind, and it is essential for Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean. Finally, France certainly had the most longstanding and profound influence of any culture on the Anglo-American tradition. For this reason, the study of French language and culture is also a search for the roots of our own experience.\n\nFrench programs offered:\n\nOne-Language option with French concentration (“major in French”) (42 credits)\n\nTwo-Language concentration with French as the primary language (42 credits)\n\nLanguage and Cultural Studies concentration with French as the selected language (39 credits)\n\nCertificate in French Studies (17 credits)\n\nMinor in French (22 credits)\n\nEspaces Series\n\nAbout every two years, the French area sponsors a series of cultural events focusing on one area of the world in which French plays a significant role. The Espaces series usually includes two courses taught in French, a film course taught in English, lectures by distinguished visiting speakers, concerts, debates, and other events. Open to the entire community, Espaces offers UMBC French students a chance to deepen their understanding of the French language, cultural dynamics, and world affairs.\n\nEspaces archive:\n\nAfrique Centrale/Central Africa (2017-2018)\n\nBelgium (2011-2012)\n\nThe Maghreb (2009-2010)\n\nFrench in the United States of America (2008-2009)\n\nOccitania (2004-2005)\n\nThe Levant: Lebanon, Syria, Egypt (2002-2003) (pdf file)\n\nThe French Caribbean (2000-2001) (pdf file)\n\nCanada and Quebec (1998–1999) (pdf file)\n\nWest Africa (1995-96) (pdf file)"
