        "text": "The official languages in Morocco\n\nModern Standard Arabic is the official language in Morocco. This is the language used by the media, in the political and economic fields, as well as in official documents. However, as we said before, the most used variant of Arabic in daily life is Moroccan Arabic, which has some differences in pronunciation and grammar. In Moroccan Arabic there are influences from the Romance languages and the Berber language, some consonants are pronounced differently than in standard Arabic, tenses differ as well as some terms and expressions.\n\nIn Morocco the most important language after Arabic is Berber, which was recognized as an official language in 2011 together with Modern Standard Arabic. The Berber language has a long history behind it and is still used mainly by many indigenous communities in the country. According to some studies, there are around five million Berber speakers in Morocco\n\nMorocco: brief historical summary\n\nTo understand which language is spoken in Morocco today and above all for what reason, it is important to talk about the history of this country and the various civilizations that have occurred within it over the years.\n\nThe area that is now Morocco, which is located in the northwest of the African continent, has been inhabited by different populations over the centuries. Among these we remember the Phoenicians from the XII century B.C. and the Romans from the 1st century, under whom there was a remarkable development in various fields such as agriculture, trade by land and sea, and architecture. After the Vandals and the Byzantines, it was the turn of the Arabs. In this period, the religion of Islam arrives in Morocco and various Islamic dynasties follow one another, such as the Almoravids and the Almohads, the Merinids and the Wattasids.\n\nSubsequently, Morocco became an important commercial and cultural center thanks to its strategic position along the trade routes between Africa, Europe and the Middle East. The European peoples divided the Moroccan territories and the riches, until the birth of a French protectorate in the south and a Spanish one in the north. In 1956, however, Morocco gained independence becoming one of the first countries to free itself from the domination of European powers.\n\nAfter independence, Morocco goes through various stages of political and economic development but also of repression and wars against neighboring countries, with King Hassan II on the throne until 1999. In recent decades, Morocco has made great progress in the field of economy, education and modernisation, however it continues to face challenges such as unemployment, poverty and economic inequality.\n\nStudy new languages with Sprachcaffe\n\nWith Sprachcaffe you can study a foreign language both from the comfort of your home, and by leaving and mixing with the locals.
