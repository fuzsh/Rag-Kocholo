        "text": "Senegal is located on the westernmost part of Africa in the Maghreb region. Senegal’s capital Dakar serves as one of Western Africa’s main seaports and acts as a cultural hub with numerous theaters and museums displaying African art and cultural artifacts. Senegal was historically home to Ghana and Djolof kingdoms before being colonized by France in the early 19th century. The country gained independence in 1960 and Léopold Sédar Senghor became the nation’s first president. French is the official language of Senegal, but 39 different languages are spoken, including Wolof, Serer, Fula, and Diola. Senegal is known for its welcoming culture, delicious seafood cuisine, and beautiful coastal landscape.\n\nFollow along to learn more about Senegal’s rich culture and traditions in the following weeks!"
