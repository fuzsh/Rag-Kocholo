        "text": "French is the official language of Morocco, spoken by around 4 million people. However, Moroccan French is quite different from the French spoken in France due to the influence of Arabic and Berber. The OIF indicates that 33% and 13% of Moroccans are French speakers, respectively.\n\nMorocco has a long history with the French language. The country was a French colony for many years, and the native language was introduced. The French language was introduced to Morocco during the colonial period when Morocco was a French protectorate from 1912 to 1956.\n\nDuring this time, French was mandatory in government and education, which helped spread the language among the Moroccan population. Even after Morocco gained independence, the French continued to be used in government and education. French is also considered the language of business, although Arabic is now the official language.\n\nEven after Morocco gained independence, the French language remained popular. Many Moroccans learn French in school, commonly used in business and government. Despite French in Morocco, Arabic is the most widely spoken language in the country. French is typically only spoken by a minority of the population. However, it is still an essential language in Morocco and contributes to its rich linguistic diversity.\n\nMoroccan French has many features that distinguish it from other varieties of French. It has been heavily influenced by the Arabic language, with around 30% of its vocabulary coming from Arabic. This can be seen in words like “salam” (hello), which is derived from the Arabic word “salam.” Moroccan French also has several loanwords from Berber, the indigenous language of Morocco. Another distinctive feature of Moroccan French is its use of Arabic grammar, such as using the definite article “al” before nouns."
