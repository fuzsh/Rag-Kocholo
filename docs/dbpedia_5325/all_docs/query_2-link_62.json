        "text": "Morocco is a country with rich, linguistic diversity. Before traveling to any foreign country, it’s a good idea to know a few basic words and phrases prior to your visit. This will make it easier for you to navigate comfortably and it will show your respect for the local people.\n\nAmong the languages of Morocco, the official language is Darija, Moroccan Arabic. The native language of Morocco is Tamazight spoken by the Amazigh/Berber population and is usually spoken in the home.\n\nHowever, many Moroccans are multi-lingual speakers, especially in touristic areas and large cities like Casablanca and Marrakech. Regions in the desert of Morocco and rural villages tend to speak more Tamazight.\n\nLearning facts about Morocco culture will also be beneficial in better understanding the culture of Morocco.\n\nAside from Darija and Tamazight, French is the unofficial second language. Due to the strong French influence of Morocco’s past, nearly half of all Moroccans can speak French. French is often used in government and university jobs and taught in schools.\n\nSpanish is a close second and more common in northern regions around Tangier or Tetouan. Having some knowledge or ability to speak either of these secondary languages will also help you along your journey especially in the northern regions closer to Europe.\n\nDarija\n\nA language all its own. While it may share some aspects of Modern Standard Arabic, Darija has a unique dialect. Differences from Moroccan Standard Arabic (MSA) are in pronunciation, grammar and expressions.

The name Tamazight also refers to other Amazigh languages of Morocco: Riff, Tuareg, Kabyle, Shawiya and Shila.\n\nThere are over 300 Tamazight dialects spoken in different regions around Morocco. Here are a few of the most common dialects according to the region:\n\nTamazight is found primarily in the Middle and High Atlas Mountains.\n\nTarifit – Rif Mountains.\n\nTashelhit – Anti-Atlas\n\nTuareg – Saharan.\n\nThe official script for Tamazight uses the Tifinagh alphabet, possibly derived from the ancient Amazigh/Berber script.
