        "text": "Linguistic landscape, henceforth LL, is made up of public and private signs i.e.; the language(s) displayed in public space. It has recently been researched by scholars from different disciplines concerned with issues of languages in contact phenomenon which is rather a case of written languages in contact. Two factors intervene in its development. The first factor falls within the official language agencies responsible of language use and regulations while the second includes individuals, and private institutions using language(s) purposefully for their own objectives escaping the control of the authorities and thus taking the freedom of rule violation as a creative way of communication. As a field of language research it mostly deals with the sociology of language, and more particularly, language policy and planning, but it is also considered as a resource for language learning and as a place of contested identities and language conflicts and hidden language agendas. Thus, necessity rises to consider LL not only as a strategy for language management but also as the key place where it must take place. It is for these very reasons that the main objective of the present article focusses on exploring LL as a strategy of language planning and management because the bottom-up individual and private agencies constitute the active agents in issues of language use, maintenance, and promotion.\n\nLinguistic landscape (L.L) is the study of written languages in the public space. This paper is an endeavor to explore and describe the linguistic make-up of Casablanca as it is conveyed in its Linguistic Landscape in order to explore the languages used in its public signs, the characteristics of these signs, and language attitudes at play that shape the public space of this city. Two different places, Prince Moulay Abdellah Avenue and Idris Alharti Boulevard, were chosen as sites of investigation. The data include over 177 pictures of language signs that were analyzed so as to determine the number of languages used, the languages on the signs and the characteristics of monolingual, bilingual and multilingual signs, with a special attention given to bottom-up signs (non-governmental signs). Although Arabic and Tamazight are official languages in Morocco, their presence in the LL is not equal. The signs in Casablanca’s linguistic landscape reveal language attitudes that are present and sometimes promote one language over another. On the same line, close-ended questionnaires (60) and interviews (7) with shop owners give a good insight into their language choice. The findings indicate that the linguistic landscape is, to a large extent, shaped by language attitudes that construct the public space with certain languages and that there are important differences between the two settings- Prince Moulay Abdellah Avenue and Idris Alharti Boulevard.\n\nThe study investigates whether the Linguistic Landscape (LL) in the main street of Ramallah, Palestine should be considered a situational variable of the English language in the country or a treat-like variable and exclusive to this city. The analysed data include over 519 pictures of signage so as to determine the number of languages used on the signs, the signs genre, their taxonomies, and the number of languages. Findings evince that there are significant differences between language policies and the street reality. The linguistic landscape in the street is not abided by the official language policy regarding the state language (Arabic) nor does it employ any minority language. The results of the study may contribute to ameliorating the situation through the policymakers to rectify the state language status. Further studies are expected to arrive upon other factors that influenced the status quo.\n\nThis article examines the use of Moroccan Arabic (MA) in the new Linguistic Landscape (LL) in Morocco, and in particular in the city of Meknés, in a new neighbourhood known as (‫)حمرية‬ Hamriya or La Ville Nouvelle. In particular , the ways in which current socioeconomic transformations produce new spaces of communications are explored, highlighting the extent to which MA is used in urban public spaces as new linguistic practices. In turn, the increasing visibility of MA in the LL and its subsequent nourishing of hybrid practices are discussed. The data points to a re-semiotisation of space in a Moroccan linguistic regime historically characterized by a well-established linguistic hierarchy. Ultimately, the use of MA creates new language practices and policies that resist and transform the sociolinguistic regime which is analysed here by a close examination of linguistic variation in Arabic in the public space."
