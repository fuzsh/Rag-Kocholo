He was the first writer from one of France's former North African colonies to receive the prestigious Prix Goncourt. \"Mr. Jelloun combined the gifts of the traditional Arab storyteller—that ability to play fantastic variations upon the simplest of themes—with remarkable philosophical insight, often reminiscent of the monologues of Samuel Beckett,\" declared a reviewer for the Economist. \"Like Beckett, too, Mr. Jelloun's favored ground is not the broad historical sweep but the intense probing of an individual mind.\"\n\nNoting in the New York Times that \"most of the Moroccan intellectual class speaks French,\" Ben Jelloun found it natural to write in French himself. Critics in that country have received Ben Jelloun's work warmly, making the author something of a celebrity. Le Monde contributor Francois Bott was quoted by James M. Markham in the New York Times writing about Ben Jelloun: \"With him, under the sign of Borges, the language of Racine and Balzac is put at the service of the Oriental story. It describes other customs. It expresses other thoughts. It is a cure that reinvigorates.\"\n\nJelloun's novel The Sand Child outlines some of the problems faced by men and women living in a traditional Arab society. The novel relates the story of a man who, when presented with an eighth daughter in a society that values sons, names the girl Ahmed and declares her to be a boy. \"The tale that follows is a cynical, dreamlike exploration,\" observed Sybil Steinberg in Publishers Weekly, \"of the roles into which Arab men and women are shaped.\" At first Ahmed revels in the power that her position as a son gives her; later, however, her confusion over her identity and her role in society begins to prey on her mind. Although asserting that the author's narrative is \"not entirely successful\" in terms of its construction, the reviewer labeled Jelloun's prose \"rich\" and \"incantatory.\" New York Times Book Review correspondent Barbara Harlow wrote of The Sand Child: \"The legacy of Hajji Ahmed's son/daughter, who is threatened by religious traditions with deprivation, is here made a rich one, bequeathing a storytelling lineage and a radical critique of contemporary Arab social customs…. The Sand Child, which draws for its narrative on an Arab oral tradition and literary legacy, continues that critical heritage.\"\n\nThe Sacred Night, winner of the Prix Goncourt, continues Ahmed's story. By the age of twenty, the girl-in-disguise has resumed a feminine identity under the name Zahra. However, she is still entrapped by her upbringing. \"This confusion of sexual roles—a special paradox in an Arab Muslim culture\"—determines Zahra's life choices, explained L.M. Lewis in Library Journal. Zahra's shame and confusion leads her into a number of dangerous situations. At one point she is raped, while at another an accusation by a relative leads her to murder and prison. Michael Rogers, in his Library Journal review of the book, called it \"definitely not your average coming-of-age story.\"\n\nJelloun's third novel to be translated into English, Silent Day in Tangier, continues some of the general themes established in his earlier work, but takes a very different direction than did either The Sand Child or The Sacred Night. Silent Day in Tangier is the story of an old, retired, and nameless Moroccan living in the port city of Tangier. \"Embittered by loneliness,\" declared Paul E. Hutchison in Library Journal, the main character \"resents the earlier deaths of his friends.\" The man is left with his petty jealousies and his memories. \"Moving in and out of hallucinatory encounters with friends and foes,\" explained New York Times Book Review contributor Katharine Weber, \"the old man restlessly acknowledges that his ‘life is a failure because it is undermined by hatred.’\" \"If the dying man does not fully captivate the reader,\" stated Steinberg in a Publishers Weekly review of the novel, \"perhaps it is because he is too clear-sighted and honest in his self-analysis, or too traditional for our tastes.\"\n\nWith Downcast Eyes revisits the theme of the outsider. It \"is the story of a Moroccan girl and her struggle to belong,\" asserted Peggie Partello in Library Journal. The girl is divided by her love for her country of residence, France, and her country of birth, Morocco, and is caught between her duty to her native village and her own life in the colonial homeland. \"Jelloun's … writing here is occasionally verbose, but his excesses are largely subsumed in this incantatory tale of culture and self,\" asserted a Publishers Weekly contributor.\n\nJelloun's novel Corruption, according to a critic writing in Publishers Weekly, \"weaves an intricate tale about a Moroccan man's slow capitulation to the lure of infidelity and bribery.\" The man, a Moroccan engineer named Mourad, has to face \"licensed\" corruption and the hostility of his wife in order to maintain his moral standards. He \"wrestles with poverty and his sense of honor while everyone around him gets rich from bribery,\" explained Virginia Nolan in Boston Review. According to Donna Seaman in Booklist, \"as Mourad takes action, the great irony of it all becomes clear to him, and he finds balance even in the midst of absurdity.\"\n\nBen Jelloun is a frequent contributor to Le Monde and other Parisian periodicals, and is well known in France for his championship of racial tolerance. Two of his nonfiction books, translated as French Hospitality: Racism and North African Immigrants and Racism Explained to My Daughter, offer pleas for an end to exclusionary politics in France. According to Michael Brett in the Times Literary Supplement, Ben Jelloun \"speaks out in the great tradition of the French intellectual, as keeper of the conscience of the nation.\" Indeed, the author's Racism Explained to My Daughter, a work aimed at young readers, has become a bestseller in France and has been translated into more than fifteen languages; it is used as a textbook in French schools. In Library Journal, John Moryl called the title \"easy to read and provocative,\" adding: \"Rare should be the library that does not have it.\"\n\nBen Jelloun continued with this format in Islam Explained, published in 2002. The history of Islam is presented, its basic tenants explained, and the militant sects of Muslim, as well as the challenges of being a peaceful Muslim in the world today, are examined. Reviewing Islam Explained in Booklist, John Green praised its \"openness and emotional honesty.\"\n\nBen Jelloun drew on his own experiences as a prisoner and on the horrific real-life case of another prisoner of Morocco's King Hassan, II, for his book This Blinding Absence of Light. When Ben Jelloun was a student in 1966, he was arrested for taking part in student demonstrations. King Hassan sent the dissenters to an army camp for eighteen months. It was there that Ben Jelloun wrote his first poems, and first understood writing as a potentially deadly undertaking. His punishment was harsh, but Ben Jelloun was lucky compared to some of the king's other victims. Some were imprisoned for twenty years in underground cells in the desert, which were not even big enough to enable them to stand up straight. Finally released in 1991, the few survivors had become deformed and shortened after spending years in the tiny cells. Jelloun interviewed one of the detainees, a man called Aziz Binebine, and the end result was This Blinding Absence of Light, a novel that \"transforms unspeakable inhumanity into an existential tale of willed survival,\" stated Maya Jaggi in the Guardian Online. Jaggi quoted Ben Jelloun as saying about his own work: \"It's a book without concessions…. I wrote it feverishly, bewitched by it, surprising myself with an inner strength.\"\n\nThe story's protagonist is Salim, a studious young man who is caught up in the coup attempt against King Hassan and then virtually entombed for the next twenty years. Reviewing the English translation by Linda Coverdale for Booklist, Donna Seaman called it a \"wrenching yet exquisite\" tribute to the human spirit. This Blinding Absence of Light won the prestigious IMPAC Dublin Literary Award—an award that also carries a prize of 100,000 Euros. Binebine later accused Ben Jelloun of stealing his story. According to the author, who dedicated the book to Binebine, he had already agreed to share any profits from the book with him, and Binebine had approved a draft.\n\nBen Jelloun then departed from his previous style and subject matter, telling a very different tale in The Last Friend, a story of the friendship between Mamed and Ali that goes unexpectedly sour. The author attempts to show the different ways that people perceive their world, telling the story from three different perspectives: Mamed's, Ali's, and that of a mutual friend of both of them. It works as \"a gentle, intelligent exercise in nihilism,\" wrote a Kirkus Reviews contributor.\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nAmerica's Intelligence Wire, June 17, 2004, \"Moroccan Novelist Ben Jelloun Wins 100,000 Euro Prize.\"\n\nBooklist, May 1, 1993, Angus Trimnell, p. 1568; October 15, 1995, Donna Seaman, review of Corruption, p. 383; May 15, 2002, Donna Seaman, review of This Blinding Absence of Light, p. 1573; October 1, 2002, John Green, review of IslamExplained, p. 284; January 1, 2003, review of Islam Explained, p. 794; February 1, 2006, Ray Olson, review of The Last Friend, p. 26.\n\nBoston Review, February-March, 1997, Virginia Nolan, review of Corruption, p. 47.\n\nEconomist, July 13, 1991, review of Silent Day in Tangier, p. 92; March 3, 2001, review of This Blinding Absence of Light, p. 4.\n\nEFE World News Service, September 22, 2001, interview with Tahar Ben Jelloun.\n\nFinancial Times, August 7, 2004, Tobias Grey, profile of Tahar Ben Jelloun, p. 25; March 11, 2006, Zoe Stimpel, review of The Last Friend, p. 33.\n\nKirkus Reviews, May 15, 2002, review of This Blinding Absence of Light, p. 704; August 15, 2002, review of Islam Explained, p. 1187; January 1, 2006, review of The Last Friend, p. 3.\n\nLibrary Journal, July, 1989, L.M.
