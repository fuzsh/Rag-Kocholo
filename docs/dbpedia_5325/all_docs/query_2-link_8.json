        "text": "Maghreb, region of North Africa bordering the Mediterranean Sea. The Africa Minor of the ancients, it at one time included Moorish Spain and now comprises essentially the Atlas Mountains and the coastal plain of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya. The weather of the Maghreb is characterized by prevailing westerly winds, which drop most of their moisture on the northern slopes and coastal plain, leaving little for the southern slopes, which maintain desert scrub fading into true desert in the Sahara to the south.\n\nFrom the vastness of their mountain ranges, the native peoples of the Maghreb have resisted successive Punic, Roman, and Christian invasions. Not until the 7th and 8th centuries was the Maghreb conquered; the Arabs, who imposed on the native peoples the religion of Islam and Arabic, the language of the Qurʾān, thus absorbed the Maghreb into the Muslim civilization. Despite this absorption, most of the North African societies have preserved their cultural identity throughout the centuries."
