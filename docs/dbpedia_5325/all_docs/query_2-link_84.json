        "text": "The Kingdom of Morocco is the most westerly of the North African countries known as the Maghreb - \"the West\". It has Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlines, a rugged mountain interior and a history of independence not shared by its neighbours.\n\nIts culture is a blend of Arab, Berber, European and African influences.\n\nMorocco was a French protectorate between 1912 and 1956. Since independence, Morocco has remained relatively stable and wields significant influence in both Africa and the Arab world.\n\nIn 1975, Morocco annexed the former Spanish colony of Western Sahara. Since then it has been the subject of a long-running territorial dispute between Morocco and its indigenous Sahrawi people, led by the Polisario Front.\n\nMohammed VI became king in 1999. He initiated political and economic changes and an investigation into human rights abuses during his father's rule.\n\nA key reform was the Mudawana, a law which grants more rights to women. The king has said it is in line with Koranic principles, but religious conservatives have opposed it.\n\nFollowing pressure for reform inspired by the \"Arab Spring\" of 2010 onwards, a new constitution was introduced, expanding the powers of parliament and the prime minister, but leaving the king with broad authority over all branches of government.\n\nPrime minister: Aziz Akhannouch\n\nThe broadcast media are either dominated by the state or reflect the official line.\n\nParis-based Reporters Without Borders notes that \"religion, the king and the monarchy in general, the country and territorial integrity cannot be questioned.\"\n\nThe government owns, or has a stake in, RTM and 2M, Morocco's main TV networks. Satellite dishes are widely used, giving access to French and pan-Arab stations."
