        "text": "l-qerd eš-šaref ma-itﻉallem eš-šṭiﺡ\n\n“An old monkey can’t learn to dance.” Moroccan proverb.\n\nBefore my readers are outraged by the title of this post, I want to make it clear that what I am talking about is not something such as pig-sticking, a popular diversion of rich foreigners in Tangier about a hundred years ago. In those days, horsemen chased wild boar and ran them through with pikes. No, I am only talking about seeking out monkeys to watch them.\n\nWatching monkeys in Africa may not sound like such a big deal. Many species of Old World monkeys inhabit the tropical forests and savannas of sub-Saharan Africa. In North Africa, however, there is only one species, of the genus, Macaca. Macaques are common in many parts of Asia, but only a single species, Macaca sylvanus, is found in Africa. These large monkeys are limited to the mountains of Algeria and Morocco.\n\nAlways interested in natural history, I hoped to see macaques in their native habitat, and my expectations seemed reasonable since I lived in Sefrou, on the edge of the Middle Atlas Mountains.\n\nThere are pockets of these monkeys in the Rif, the Middle Atlas, and the Central High Atlas Mountains as well as in the mountains of Algeria. A small population also lives on the Rock of Gibraltar, where they are known as Barbary Apes, and are a major tourist attraction. The name Barbary Apes is a misnomer, of course, for macaques are not apes at all, but monkeys.\n\nWith no fossil evidence of them in post-Pleistocene Europe, the most reasonable explanation for their presence in Gibraltar is that the macaques were introduced by Europeans or else Moorish invaders in the Middle Ages. The British Army used to feed and care for the monkeys, and there was a tradition that as long as there were apes on the Rock, Gibraltar would remain British. Indeed, Winston Churchill sought to have their numbers augmented when the population seemed in decline.\n\nToday, the greatest numbers of Macaca sylvanus, estimated to be about 75% of the total population, live in the Middle Atlas mountains of Morocco. Some of my earlier blog articles show views of their habitat, cedar forests with an understory of holm oaks. The cedars and oaks are associated, with the oaks providing a moist environment for the growth of young cedars.\n\nThe Atlas cedar (Cedrus atlantica) is one of three true cedar species, the other two being native to the Middle East and the Himalayas. The holm oak (Quercus ilex) and the Atlas cedar are both found in Great Britain. Majestic Atlas cedars grace many country estates there, but holm oaks, alas, are simply an invasive species. In France, cedars are grown for lumber and as part of reforestation efforts. A French friend had thousands planted on his hilltop property outside Albi, and royal parks, such as the one surrounding the Château of Chaumont-sur-Loire, often have groves of ancient trees.\n\nThe macaques eat a diet of seasonal foods: cedar bark and cones, acorns, mushrooms, and many other wild plants as well as insects.\n\nToday the numbers of Macaca sylvanus are in steep decline, probably due to disappearing habitat, and the species has been officially listed as endangered.\n\nMy work in Fes Province occasionally took me over the mountains. In those days, Fes Province extended south as far as Boulemane and Missour. More often than not, I took excursions into the forests with friends and visitors, made possible by the Jeep I used for work.\n\nWhile a troop of monkeys might occasionally be spotted near a road, I never saw one while driving, and I suspect that they shied away from human contact. Shepherds found them a nuisance, probably because the troops annoyed their flocks. On one occasion, I stopped and asked a shepherd if he ever saw monkeys. His incredulous response was something along the lines of “Are you kidding? The little sons of bitches are everywhere!” I suppose if you are deep in the forest, and not making much noise, you will see them often. Until near the end of my Peace Corps service, the only wild macaque I ever saw was a dead one, hanging high in a cedar tree. Did it die in a fall, impaled by a branch, was it shot by a hunter for his amusement, or did it simply die of sickness or old age?\n\nIn December of 1971, Gaylord Barr and I took two of his lycée students to the Michlifen ski center just for the ride. There had been a heavy snowfall, but the day was bright with deep blue skies and a strong sun.\n\nSnow still lay heavy on the cedar boughs, and glistened while it melted.\n\nSkiers filled the old volcanic crater, and the resort’s concession stand was full of visitors. Despite the snow, the strong sun kept the temperatures mild.\n\nFor the students, it was their first opportunity to see people ski, though it was only a short drive from their homes in Sefrou. While the three others enjoyed the sun and drank Cokes, I trudged off through the heavy snow, camera in hand, hoping to find an interesting vantage point for a photo.\n\nAs I struggled through the knee-deep snow on the heights above the resort, a small group of monkeys crossed my path. I must have startled them, for they were gone in a flash. I had no chance for a photo, but I was gratified to have finally seen some living individuals in the wild.\n\nIn America we usually associate monkeys with warmer climates, but macaques are sometimes found far north of the tropics, notably in Japan, where they take advantage of hot springs.\n\nThe monkeys were not the only unwanted animals in the cedar forests. Wild boar were common, and ate many of the same foods as the macaques. The holm oaks that grew in association with the cedars produced an abundance of acorns. The large edible acorns were sometimes harvested and appeared in the Sefrou market, but they were bland and considered a food of last resort. I have never seen a recipe for a Moroccan dish with acorns. The boar relished them, however, as well as the mushrooms and truffles. So did the macaques.\n\nI never wanted to surprise a herd of boar. Unpredictable, large, and armed with wicked tusks, they could be dangerous. And I never saw any, though a friend, Jean-Michel Vrinat, a coopérant doctor in Ouazzane, shot one, and I had a chance to eat the meat, which I thought lean and tasty. I might have been happy living with Astérix and his friends. Moroccans have little use for the boar, since pigs are haram and their meat forbidden. They constitute a much more dangerous nuisance than the macaques, and will attack humans if they are threatened.\n\nJean-Michel was a real sportsman, and arrived in Morocco to do his service with not only a shotgun, but climbing gear, épées, and God knows what else. He climbed with me in the Toubkal Massif, and was a better climber than I. Regrettably, I lost contact with him, though a mutual friend told me that Jean-Michel married a “Venetian princess” and still practices medicine in his home in the Loire Valley.\n\nMy encounters with monkeys were not over. Not very long after the encounter mentioned above, as I was traveling south toward the Ghanaian border from Ouagadougou after my trip across the Sahara, we spotted a troop of baboons fleeing across the Sahel scrublands. There was no opportunity for a photo. Along with flying foxes and gazelles, those baboons were the only exotic animals I saw in that long and meandering trip.\n\nMy encounters with macaques were not quite over. In the late 1970s, I lived in Chauen. The high mountains behind the town always beckoned, and I sometimes sought the pleasure of the mountain heights.\n\nIn reality, that end of the Rif is not especially high, but there were few trails and the going can be rugged. Most tourists contented themselves by staying within the quaint town to which Raisuni and Franco had given a certain prominence.\n\nWith its tiled roofs and blue-colored houses, Chauen has long been a tourist haunt. Its location on the edge of the Rif mountains and its proximity to Tangier, Tetuan, and Ceuta has made it popular with travelers. Just a few years back, the New York Times featured Chauen in a tourism article. Few tourists are aware of the bloody events of the Rif War, and the disastrous retreat by the Spanish army from Chauen in 1924.\n\nThe mountains rise steeply and are striking. The lower slopes of the mountains were covered with cork oak forests, the only major ones in Morocco outside of the Mamora, I believe, while the summits held beautiful forests of mature pine and fir, though they were being logged heavily 50 years ago\n\nLike the holm oaks, the cork oaks produced an edible acorn, though few Moroccans seemed to eat them. Nor did Moroccans eat the abundant mushrooms that grew under them.\n\nKnowing that there were monkeys close by, my French friends and I set out one day to try to find a few.\n\nWe drove up the road that leads to a high pass behind the city, then scrambled around the accessible crags, and our efforts were rewarded.\n\nAlas, the monkeys had no desire to see us. I took several pictures of them, hopping below us on the rock ledges, and only obtained minuscule dots, indistinguishable and unrecognizable as monkeys. Still, it was a fun day, and we did see some macaques.\n\nWikipedia has a long article on a Macaca sylvanus if you desire to learn more about this monkey. I wish anyone seeking out those monkeys better luck than I, and, for the monkeys, a fair chance to survive unmolested in an environment that is becoming smaller and more fragmented. I recommend the Wikipedia articles on North African macaques for further reading: English and French.\n\n“…I suddenly saw the breaking news on CNN about the El Paso and Dayton shootings, which raises in my mind this question: What’s happening to the America that I learnt so many good things about from Gaylord, you and other PCVs? What happened to the great American values upheld by the ideals of John F. Kennedy, Jimmy Carter, Reagan? Surely, something is wrong in the state of Denmark. What is the difference between white supremacists and ISIS terrorists? In my younger days, my wish was to migrate to America. Now I say to myself “I’m glad my wish did not come true.”\n\nNot long ago, an old Moroccan friend, well educated, who had lived abroad in England as well as in the States, and who speaks English fluently, wrote me the message part of which I have quoted above. I tried to answer it as best I could, but the state of the world baffles me, too.\n\nAfter further reflection, however, I began to ponder the question itself. When I went to Morocco in January 1968, the entire world lived under the threat of a nuclear holocaust. The States was involved in disastrous and deadly wars in Southeast Asia. The president and the military were lying to the public. The soon-to-be president campaigned on a “secret plan” to end the war, a plan that didn’t exist. Soviet and Warsaw Pact forces crushed Czechoslovakia’s “democracy with a human face.” Political assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy shocked America. Street protests and race riots were common occurences.\n\nI had written to a friend in early 1968, from an agricultural station outside Meknes, that the weather was getting hot. He wrote back from the University of Chicago, where he was a grad student studying south Slavic languages. “You think it’s getting hot there? They are setting up a machine gun emplacement outside my window.” It was a time of race riots and rage.\n\nWhen I picked up a Newsweek magazine in Fes in 1970, the cover photo portrayed a young college girl at Kent State, reacting with grief to the shooting of a fellow student by Ohio National Guards. I was horrified.\n\nIn France, student protests forced the French president Charles De Gaulle to step down. Across the straits in Spain, Franco continued to rule a country still suffering deeply from civil war that had taken place decades earlier. Northern Ireland was torn by civil strife, and Great Britain lived with car bombings. The white Rhodesian government had broken with Britain, and South Africa lived under apartheid. China was in the throes of its “Cultural Revolution.” Nigeria was in civil war. Within the next few years millions would die in the Cambodian genocide. Even unrest beset Morocco, where the king, Hassan II, would survive two coup attempts in the span of two short years, both while I lived there.\n\nI have read Hans Rowling’s book, Factfulness, and I acknowledge its earnestness and veracity. Negativity comes easily. Just the same, I am far too much of a skeptic to be very optimistic about the world’s future in the face of pollution, resource exhaustion, overpopulation, growing economic inequality, and climate change. Only God knows the fate of humanity and the earth. Or, put in a more humanistic framework, whether men shape history or it shapes them, there is assuredly a destiny awaiting humanity.\n\nMy correspondent knew America primarily through Peace Corps volunteers and popular culture. Did we misrepresent it, or did his young mind perceive the States as something that it wasn’t? We certainly knew that America was not perfect. The civil rights movement of the 1960s had brought a new consciousness to America, and forced many, my young naive self among them, to begin to confront the many ugly facts in American history glossed over by traditional texts. And environmental issues began to take on a new importance following the publication of Rachel Carlson’s book, Silent Spring.\n\nWe were all deeply concerned with the state of our own country. I remember listening eagerly every week to Alistair Cooke’s Letter from America on the BBC World Service, always hoping to be entertained and enlightened, but also always fearing what next great tragedy might be his subject matter.\n\nThe world today seems to be on a reactionary bent. I could speak about current events in the States in terms of racism and fear of loss of white privilege, the problems of American government and its electoral system, the proliferation of guns and mass shootings, the hyper partisanship that puts political gain above the national interest, the ability of the very rich to inordinately influence government, widespread climate change denial, the lack of internationalism, foreign influence on American elections, willingness to violate norms that have developed over thousands of years, and so on and so forth. However, I am not sure whether there is not a certain amount of hypocrisy in looking back at a “golden age” when much nasty stuff was done behind the scenes, out of the eyes of the public. And Georges Brassens is always in my mind:\n\nSi j’connus un temps de chien, certes\n\nC’est bien le temps de mes vingt ans\n\nCependant, je pleure sa perte\n\nIl est mort, c’était le bon temps\n\nIl est toujours joli, le temps passé.\n\nRoughly translated, the extract from the song goes “If there ever was a bad time in my life, it was certainly when I was in my twenties. Now that it’s gone, I mourn its loss. The past is always golden.”\n\nToday, I am unhappy to live in a divided country, I do not like racism, which those of the white majority find difficult to acknowledge. I find extremism abhorrent in any form. There is no difference between Islamic terrorism and domestic terrorism: nothing justifies the taking of innocent lives.\n\nIn France in 1995, waiting to leave France, my wife and I watched TV reports of the Oklahoma City bombing where 168 people died including 19 children, most of whom were in a daycare center while their parents worked. The bombing was carried out by someone who was born and raised in Niagara County, where I was born and now live. He was able to do this because he lived in a free society where it is relatively easy to acquire guns and buy substances to make bombs. He did it because he hated the government and the building was a Federal government office building. Some mistrust of government is healthy, but hatred of it can be pathological.\n\nWhat gives me hope at home is our American legal system. English common law and its embodiment in democracies across the world have provided those who are fortunate to live in them with the rule of law, and the American and French revolutions provided universal ideals about human dignity, rights, and freedom that could be enshrined in constitutions. Yes, implementation is often imperfect, and law enforcement needs improvement, but, though perfection may be a goal, we should usually just content ourselves with what we have, and resolve to continue working to improve it.\n\nWinston Churchill was astute when he said:\n\nMany forms of Government have been tried, and will be tried in this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of Government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.\n\nWe all now live in a dangerous world, and I think that we must confront it together. To reprise, here is another famous quote, attributed to Benjamin Franklin, though possibly apocryphal. He made it during the American Revolution, but the observation is applicable to almost any crisis: “We must all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately.”\n\nThe world is in a crisis of unprecedented scale. We ought to recognize that and hang together. I feel fortunate that I was born in the States and I certainly recognize how much I have benefitted from living here, but the scale of problems that now threaten the individual is no longer national, but global. Yes, I worry about where my country is headed, but I worry as well about the world we live in. The question my Moroccan friend might have also asked is: What has happened to the world? His answer would be as good as mine.\n\nIn the 1940s, the democracies of the world fought for their very existence, but after the war, many people turned their thoughts to problems of a different scale. To enjoy democracy, the world needs a stable world order, where participation in society benefits everyone, and, above all, where the rule of law governs society.\n\nWhen I left Morocco, I wondered how that country would evolve. The coup attempts had been a shock. I was concerned, too, about Morocco’s growing population in a part of the world short of water and land. Morocco today continues to be plagued by serious problems, yet it seems to have made remarkable progress in many areas, and I am happy for that. If I were Moroccan, I would be proud of the great strides my country has made. Still, no one in the world today should be complacent. As for the States, we are certainly going through a bad patch, but I remain confident that the foundations of American democracy are deep and solidly built, and American society resilient.\n\nAs for me, I am growing older every day, and I try to console myself in part with the ironic lyrics of the old Woody Guthrie song Worried Man Blues:\n\nIt takes a worried man\n\nTo sing a worried song\n\nI’m worried now,\n\nBut I won’t be worried long.\n\nIn the past year, my brother-in-law went to Morocco for his work. He only visited Rabat, and he is the first to admit that he saw very little of the country in the few days he was there. A few weeks or so ago we were chatting over a drink in his backyard, and he told me that some of his Moroccan colleagues had explained to him that Morocco’s unique character lay in the fact that the place had been a nation-state since the Middle Ages, and he seemed ready to accept that as reasonable and repeat it to me as having some kind of explanatory value.\n\nOf course, that characterization is quite inaccurate, and anyone familiar with modern European history knows that the very idea of the nation-state dates from about the time of the French Revolution, as does its correlate nationalism. The idea of a people, united by history and culture, constituting a nation on specific territory was a radical one in the nineteenth century. It spawned the creation of new countries as well as the breakup of old empires, and, of course, it culminated during the twentieth century in two of the worst wars mankind has experienced, though there is still time, as George’s Brassens has written, for another: Du fond de son sac à malices/Mars va sans doute, à l’occasion/En sortir une, un vrai délice…\n\nThat said, Morocco’s status as an outlier is beyond question, and it has been one for a very long time, indeed.\n\nIn antiquity, after being a site for Punic trading posts, it was eventually incorporated into the Roman Empire. The area around the ancient city of Volubilis prospered to the extent that a sizeable city grew up there. With the end of the Pax Romana, however, the Empire lost control of the territory that was then known as Mauritania Tingitana. On the Empire’s edge, Volubilis simply could not be defended from the tribal groups around it. When the western empire fell, Byzantine power only extended to coastal areas of Morocco and Volubilis was quickly lost to the Vandals and Arab invaders. It would be 1500 years before Moroccans could become citizens again.\n\nIn a story, probably apocryphal, the early Muslim general Oqba bin Nafi rode his horse into the swells of the Atlantic, calling on God to witness that he had brought Islam to the farthest ends of the earth. The Arab armies then turned northward, perhaps welcomed into Spain by a population oppressed by the Visigoths. On the far western limits of the Arab empire, Morocco became a backwater to the Iberian kingdoms of Al-Andalus, where the last of the Umayyads survived the Abbasid massacres of their kinsmen to continue as a rival Caliphate, and a rich and culturally diverse civilization arose. Morocco remained a dead end, a cul-de-sac, limited by the vastness of the Atlantic and the fastness of the Sahara. In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, Berber dynasties arose to intervene in Al-Andalus, but after 1492, Morocco found itself at the end of the Arab world, a very long way from the Middle East.\n\nThe rise of the Ottomans had a profound influence on the other parts of the Maghreb, but Morocco never succumbed to Ottoman power. In the territory of Morocco, the Maghreb al-Aqsa, dynasties continued to rise and fall according to the rhythm of Ibn Khaldun. The last of these, the Alaouites, appeared in the 17th century. Facing the expansionist ambitions of Spain and Portugal as well as the Ottomans, the Alaouite sultans also had to contend with a mountainous hinterland controlled by powerful Berber tribes that constituted a perpetual threat. When the sultan was powerful, his kingdom expanded, and when his power declined, the tribes became an existential threat.\n\nThe sultan’s power was urban centered, and his legitimacy came from his dynasty’s claimed descent from Ali, the Prophet’s son-in-law, and to the strong folk belief in the holy force of baraka, passed through descent from the prophet Mohammed himself. There was no nation in a modern sense. There was a kingdom, with an itinerant ruler, much as the kingdoms of medieval Europe. People were not citizens but subjects, and primary identification was to one’s family or tribe or village or city. No one claimed to be Moroccan in pre-modern Morocco. Indeed, the very word Morocco, is derived from the name of a city, Marrakesh, and is European in origin. Moroccans literally call themselves westerners, and have to differentiate themselves from the rest of the Maghreb, the Arab West.\n\nBy the 19th century, the sultans had grown weak, and Morocco’s territory had become a prize for European imperialists. Deeply indebted, the kingdom fell to the French which had already ruled Algeria for half a century. France secured its colonial claims on Tunisia as well. Theoretically a protectorate, French Morocco was a colony in everything but name. The French did not seize it from the Ottomans or their heirs as Algeria and Tunisia had been taken. French intervention in Morocco aimed to secure the sultan’s empire—for the benefit of the French, but eventually for the Alaouite dynasty and the Moroccan elites.\n\nThe creation of the protectorate created the basis of a nation-state, and endowed the Moroccan elites with an administrative apparatus that in fact made it a nation upon its independence in 1956. The French destroyed the old duality of the land of insolence (es-siba) and the land of the government (al-makhzen), and brought the sultan’s territory firmly under their control, and, coincidentally, under the sultan’s control, at last. Brazen efforts by the French to exploit Berber and Arab cultural differences foundered on religion and the sultan’s legitimacy.\n\nModern Moroccan nationalism arose in opposition to French and Spanish imperialism, and the sultan gave it a unifying theme. The king, Mohammad V, led Morocco to independence, despite being deposed and exiled, and he secured for the state, as well as for himself, an important legitimacy. In conversations with me, Moroccans usually spoke with reverence of him, and sometimes made a strong contrast with their opinion of his son and successor, Hassan II.\n\nConsiderable violence, subsumed by the benign term, pacification, took place early in the protectorate, but largely in tribal areas, where the French were successful in a way that the sultans never were. The independence movement itself was relatively peaceful, unlike that of neighboring Algeria.\n\nWhile Moroccans were never cut off from Arab brethren in the East, the modern ruling elites arose under French tutelage, and looked to Paris as much, if not more, than to Cairo, Beirut, or Damascus for guidance. In that respect, they were not so difference from the rest of the Maghreb, and they did not have any of the ancient ties, real or imagined, of Syria or Lebanon. Algeria, a part of France, stood between them and the east.\n\nIndependent Morocco has also escaped, so far at least, the violence and chaos of the modern Middle East. The current dynasty survived two serious coup attempts in 1970 and 1971, and still rules. Only the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan can boast of that kind of good fortune, and Morocco lays claim to a valuable and almost unique stability in a region torn by conflicts. Although Morocco proclaims solidarity with the Palestinians, the Arab-Israeli conflict has always been far away. Its major impact has been to make life more difficult for the Moroccan Jewish population, now just a shadow of its former self.\n\nTying Morocco closer to Europe are the thousands of migrants and emigrants to Europe. Early Moroccan wage labor migration began during World War I, when France experienced critical labor shortages, and continued throughout the century. Early on, the migration consisted of single men. They lived thrifty lives, sent money home to their families, and visited during the summer vacations. In the 1960s, one could easily be stuck in traffic jams on the Ceuta border caused by migrants coming home from or returning to Europe. The magnitude of these migration streams was unrivaled by any Middle Eastern country, aside from Turkey, and its roots were older and more deeply implanted. Morocco sits on the doorstep of Europe, just a short car ferry from Spain. Later in the 20th century, emigration came to play a bigger role in Morocco. In a recent poll, reported on in The Guardian, 70% of Moroccan under 30 years of age think of migrating!\n\nMorocco bears an analogous position to Sicily, perhaps, sitting at the end of a long and diverse dialectical and cultural chain, owing much of its uniqueness to its geographical position. Morocco’s fertile plains border the Atlantic, and the Rif Mountains present a relatively inhospitable barrier along the Mediterranean. On the south, the Sahara presents a barrier. Morocco is a country connected to the East by religion and culture, but it faces north and west.\n\nFinally, Moroccan Muslims are all Sunni, following the same school of law. Not even Algeria and Tunisia show this complete religious homogeneity. Indeed, few Middle Eastern countries are so homogeneous. Moroccans think in terms of Muslims, Jews, and Christians, and a country such as Lebanon is beyond their experience. Saudi Arabia, with its large Shi’a population, cannot manifest such religious uniformity.\n\nFor the better and for the worse, geography and history made Morocco what it is, and what has distinguished it from its neighbors since Roman times. Two millennia of history crystallized in the form of a nation-state in the mid-twentieth century, a state molded by the French and inherited by Moroccan elites.\n\nA few weeks ago, the New York Times published an article about preservation, or more accurately, the lack of preservation for the Casbah of Algiers. I did a quick lookup and found that the Times had printed a very similar article in 2006. Sadly, efforts to preserve the oldest part of Algiers do not seem to have progressed much in the interval. Both the French and the post-colonial Algerian government seem to have neglected the casbah, and today it has become a decaying slum, a breeding ground for fundamentalists, and a major headache. However, there is nothing unique about this.\n\nHistoric preservation in the Middle East and North Africa is everywhere a problem, and has been for a long while. In Morocco, major monuments and archeological sites began to receive serious concern when the French turned Morocco into a colony under the guise of a protectorate. Eager to promote an image of Morocco that was more Pan-Mediterranean and more closely connected to France, archeological sites such as Volubilis were excavated and restored.\n\nThe last independent sultans of Morocco had far more important things to worry about than old ruins. When Morocco achieved independence in 1956, its new government realized the value of its national patrimony for its citizens and for a tourism industry that constituted a major source of income for the economy.\n\nMarshall Lyautey, the French Resident-General of the new Protectorate, is credited with the establishment of French rule and its early administration. One of his first and most far reaching decisions was to plan new towns, les villes nouvelles, alongside the existing cities, which became known as medinas, the Arabic word for city.\n\nThis policy afforded many advantages for the new European population and the French administration, but it resulted in the preservation of the old cities of Morocco intact at the cost of their slowly being left behind and crumbling. Although the French added water, sanitation and electricity to the medinas, the new cities became the choice of the Moroccan elites and Europeans, while the old towns, under the additional burden of a burgeoning population and migration from the countryside, slowly became slums.\n\nMy boss, Si Abdullah Jaï, who ran the provincial offices of the Ministry of Agriculture in the nineteen sixties, asked me to take some photographs of his old house deep in the medina of Fes. No one lived there any longer and he wanted to sell it. He thought that his large traditional family house might have value in the tourism industry. He was right.\n\nThe medinas of Morocco have always been a prime tourist attraction, affording a view of traditional life and its urban forms. None more than Fes, taken as one of the models of the archetypal preindustrial urban form by the urban geographer Gideon Sjoberg. Still walled today, Fes and other medinas are labyrinths.\n\nAfter passing through gates, its narrow streets wind down into the valley that it occupies before climbing out again. Along the way, many streets branch into dead ends, and encroachment on the public way, a common practice in old Muslim cities, has occasionally resulted in streets so narrow in places that a loaded donkey can barely pass.\n\nThe medina of Fès, closed to most motorized vehicles during my time in Morocco, was finally opened by a road that pierces the southern wall and takes cars and buses, notably tourism buses, to the bottom of the valley at the newly constructed Place R’cif, saving tourists the arduous and confusing hike once required to sightsee in the medina.\n\nTo service tourism a hotel industry has grown up in Fès and other Moroccan medinas, based on the concept of the riad. The riad, usually an old medina building renovated for foreign tourists, offers an accommodation that purports to be traditional, with decorative features to charm tourists. Located in the medinas, riads are close to the major attractions, are accessed by streets that provide local color, and are modestly priced, especially in comparison to large luxury hotels.\n\nRiads, which take their name from the Arabic word for garden, did exist as the homes of a few very wealthy Moroccans in precolonial Morocco, and sometimes, where space was available, did feature sizable gardens. Today, they often reflect the traditional urban courtyard house adapted to tourism. I would not be surprised if Si Jaï’s house, which had huge rooms and a large courtyard, though no garden, is today a tourist establishment.\n\nYou would be unlikely to find Moroccans staying in a riad. The Moroccan equivalent of a riad is a slum tenement. The same building holding a riad could easily be subdivided and rented by room to poor Moroccans, without the expense of any renovation. Many medina buildings have, in fact, become tenements in this fashion.\n\nMedinas were also the closest thing to traditional urban life that existed during my days in Morocco, and, I, like many volunteers, was pleased to be able to live in one. We saw the medina as both authentic and romantic, conveniently ignoring the inherent contradictions. My house, described elsewhere in the blog, was on a major street, not in a cul-de-sac, and shopkeepers occupied the ground floor frontage of the house, and that of many of the houses that faced the main streets.\n\nIn the early colonial era, Sefrou still reflected its most traditional form. Today all the land inside the walls, which formerly would have been gardens, is built up. My house was built abutting the city wall, something that would have been a defensive liability when the walls really served to keep people out.\n\nIn the mid-twentieth century, a disastrous flood on the Oued Aggaï, which flows through and divides the city, caused significant damages, and forced a deeping of the river bed to avoid reoccurrences. The picturesque sight of Jewish and Muslim women washing their clothes vanished overnight. And the large Jewish quarter, the Mellah, no longer provides a home to Jews, who were numerous in precolonial times.\n\nI seldom entered or left my house without exchanging greetings with neighbors, and bought as much produce as possible from neighboring shopkeepers. From the front room of the house, one could hear and see the bustle in the street below, but the house offered privacy and quiet in its courtyard and other rooms.\n\nThe terrace was a place to do chores, admire the view, especially Bouiblane to the southeast, or simply relax in privacy and get some sun. In the summer the terrace was hot in the middle of the day, but always cool at night. In the winter, one could escape the indoor clamminess, and warm oneself in the sun, when it came out. Ironically, neither Clifford Geertz and his wife nor any of his students, lived in the Sefrou medina, despite writing an important urban anthropology book about Morocco. With young children, a more convenient home worked better for the Geertz family, just as it would have for an upper class Moroccan one.\n\nIn the medina, there was overcrowding and poverty, and many Sefrouis, and not necessarily the richest, were fleeing the medinas to the new quarters outside the walls such as Habouna and Derb el Miter and Seti Messaouda, where homes were newer, more easily accessible by car, and less quirky. The newer quarters also had lots for sale.\n\nToday Sefrou has more than doubled in size. Urban growth has swallowed much of the surrounding agricultural land and new quarters have grown up the hillsides around the town. The rapid expansion reminds me of Orange County, California, where roads and housing have replaced the fruit groves that once gave the county its name.\n\nAs quickly as locals are leaving, country folk and the poor continue to move into the medina. Overcrowding, poverty, and lack of services and investment, public or private, are quickly turning the Sefrou medina into a slum. This is no new phenomenon. In the sixties it was clearly visible in Fes and other large cities as well as Sefrou, but the population explosion and rising urbanization has accelerated the trend.\n\nIn large, modern Moroccan cities such as Casablanca, there was no real medina. Before the Protectorate, Casablanca, without a real port, was not much of a city. The French changed that, building an artificial harbor, and Casablanca grew to be the commercial colossus of the country.\n\nWith no medina to provide inexpensive housing, urban migrants squatted in makeshift, unregulated settlements called bidonvilles, after the tin cans used in their construction. Elsewhere in the world, this type of settlement is known by various other terms such as favela or shanty town.\n\nThe medinas of the traditional centers, being abandoned, provided an economic opportunity for owners to divide old structures into multiple units, often sharing common toilets and courtyard, just as the riad idea offers tourism operators a cheap and attractive method to house wealthy foreigners, desirous of a more “authentic” experience. Housing has co-evolved into trendy riads and seedy tenements, gentrification and decay side by side.\n\nThe problem for the government of Morocco, and a formidable one, is to address the urban decay, and to preserve the character of the medina, in a time when much of the urban life has moved outside into the growing villes nouvelles or the newer quarters. When the French arrived, Sefrou consisted of nothing but the medina and a small agglomeration called el Qelaa. Now both are almost lost on the city map, surrounded by newer construction.\n\nIt is relatively easy to preserve a monument such as the Tour Hassan in Rabat. Dealing with a centuries old city that is turning into a slum is of quite greater magnitude, and, not the least, because there are four major medinas in the royal capital cities of Marrakech, Rabat, Meknes, and Fes, not to mention those in middle-sized cities such as Salé or Tetouan-Oujda, nor in many smaller towns such as Sefrou or Chauen.\n\nThe Government of Morocco has done studies of the various medinas. The World Bank has even done a study on how to preserve and develop the medina of Fes, long a favorite haunt of the banker, David Rockefeller.\n\nOne thing seems sure in Morocco. Fancy foreign-owned homes and riads cannot coexist forever with tenements, and that the medinas, that today still fascinate foreigners, will become ghettos of an underclass of poor Moroccans, and eventually crumble.\n\nMany countries face the same issues. In Jeddah, in Saudi Arabia, the Saudis seemed to be proud of the efforts they were making in the old city, but I wondered why, with all the Saudi money, the rehabilitation was not already finished. I suspect that there are fewer and fewer Saudis in old Jeddah than foreigners.\n\nIn modern Iran, Reza Shah just punched through the old cities with straight roads, much the way Haussmann had done in Paris. When the power of the state is concentrated, many things are possible, and in authoritarian governments, where the army secures state power, putting down urban revolts is a priority.\n\nIn Europe, after the sixteenth century, governments began to tear down walls that no longer served defensive purposes, and constructed roads in their place, leaving only toponyms that reflect the old placement of gates. The subway stations in Paris bearing Porte in their name testify to old city gates.\n\nWhat will be the future of these ancient cities? Perhaps present trends will simply continue unabated. Then, someday, and God forbid it, an earthquake, like that of Agadir, will level one or two of them in a matter of seconds, diverting all investment into the new towns beside them, and leaving vast graveyards. As the recent fire at Notre Dame demonstrates, a monument that has endured for centuries can perish in minutes.\n\nWhen you visit the medinas of Morocco, keep in mind that what charms you, the Westerner, is not just a survival from the past, but an artifact of modern policy, and, behind the wall of your riad may well be a family of eight, living in a single room, sharing a kitchen and toilet with eight or nine other families.\n\nMOROCCO X: PEACE CORPS TRAINING IN HEMET CALIFORNIA\n\nReed Erskine, author and photographer.\n\nPROLOGUE\n\nIn the summer of 1967, gas was 33 cents a gallon. The average annual income was $7,300. A war was raging in Vietnam, its American death toll having mushroomed, for the first time that year, to nearly 1,000 American lives a month. Race riots had broken out in Detroit, Newark, Tampa, Buffalo, and Memphis. I was negotiating, in my 20th year of life, the uncertain territory between being a boy and becoming a man.\n\nFellow baby boomers, including one of my college roommates, had flocked to San Francisco for the first and last “Summer of Love”; meanwhile I was working a summer job at Montreal’s Expo ’67, bussing tables at the India Pavilion restaurant.\n\nAt the end of my sophomore year in college, I had applied to the Peace Corps, stirred by the adventurous idealism of a national service founded only six years before by a president who had captured our imaginations with the possibility of being, in some small way, an agent of peace and understanding.\n\nI had nearly forgotten my Peace Corps application until I got back from Montreal, and heard that the government had been asking friends and neighbors for character references on my behalf. It took a moment to realize that my Peace Corps application was being digested in the bowels of officialdom.\n\nA letter arrived, proposing Peace Corps service in Micronesia. Head filled with images of palm-fringed islands in the sun, I called in to accept, only to be told that the program had been filled. The next program offered a post in Andhra Pradesh, India, but that fell through as well. As I was beginning to reconsider the entire project, I was assigned to Morocco X, an agricultural program.\n\nLooking back over the five decades gone by since that mid-October day in 1967 when our cohort of 43 men and boys came together in Hemet, California for three months of training, I had come to think that memories of that brief time had been all but lost beneath the accretion of intervening years.\n\nWhen I discovered David Brooks’, “The Morocco That Was” blog, I was moved to revisit my own Morocco X experience, and, in rummaging through my meager memorabilia , discovered a cache of correspondence and journal entries that offered a few vignettes of our time in Hemet. I am setting down this account in the hope that those who were part of our shared experience might add their own memories to this blog, and help fill the remaining gaps in my recollections.\n\nTHE PLAN:\n\nMorocco X was conceived as an ambitious agricultural project intended to aid and expedite a USAID Program to introduce a new and improved strain of wheat, known generally as “Mexican Wheat” to Moroccan farmers.\n\nWe volunteers were to be stationed at the numerous centres de travaux, small agricultural extension offices scattered across rural Morocco. Often sited in remote locations, the “C.T” were staffed by extension agents who dispensed aid and information to small family farms. The agents distributed seed stock, introduced modern techniques, pesticides, fertilizers, and provided access to modern, labor-saving machinery, such as tractors, plows and combines to farm communities, who were still relying on methods little changed since the Middle Ages.\n\nOur mission, as volunteers, would be to coordinate with our USAID and Moroccan counterparts to get the new Mexican Wheat to our centres, set up demonstration plots, and introduce an agricultural revolution that could dramatically increase yields by eliminating two devastating problems facing wheat growers.\n\nWheat “rust”, a parasitic fungal infection on the stem and leaves of the plant, weakens its host, reducing quality and yield. As if the threat of “rust” was not enough, “lodging”, the tendency of the ripe wheat to fall over before harvest, leaving large swaths of wheat fields flattened to the ground, could also jeopardize the success of an otherwise abundant crop.\n\nIn 1944, an Iowa farmer and plant pathologist, Norman Borlaug, had begun to find a solution to wheat rust infestation. For the next decade, he and his colleagues crossbred thousands of wheat strains from around the world to create a rust-resistant wheat. The resulting hybrid was still vulnerable to toppling under the weight of its ripe heads, until Borlaug crossed it again with a Japanese dwarf strain to create a short-stemmed, semi-dwarf wheat, resistant to both lodging and rust.\n\nBorlaug’s genius and dedication won him a Nobel prize in 1970, and should have provided Morocco X with a seminal role in the great endeavor of thwarting the dire Malthusian prediction of mass starvation as population growth outstripped agricultural output. This heady prospect, that might have cast us as servants to the survival of the human race, was, like so many hopes and dreams, on a collision course with the ultimate reality of our mission in Morocco.\n\nPEOPLE & PLACE:\n\nOn a warm mid-October afternoon in 1967, 43 prospective volunteers for the tenth Morocco Peace Corps program, having passed initial application and vetting processes, arrived in Hemet, California. Most of us came from the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the Lower 48, with a few from the Midwest, and at least one, that I can think of, from the South. We ranged in age from 19 to 38. An overwhelming majority came armed with undergraduate degrees, a few having pursued or obtained post-graduate degrees. One or two of us had less than four years of college. No one had, as far as I could tell, any agricultural background. Without exception we were white Caucasians which, in 1967, was not surprising.\n\nIn those days, Hemet was a nondescript sprawl of a town, set in a semi-desert valley just beginning its evolution from a patchwork of irrigated alfalfa fields and orchards, into America’s first planned retirement community, which offered mobile home sites in a subdivision zoned for residents over the age of 55.\n\nSierra Dawn Estates, promoted by Art Linkletter, had preceded our arrival in Hemet by only a few years. Its wide, straight streets, bordered by tidy, double wide mobile homes, fronted by startlingly green Sta-Rock “lawns”, had just begun to transform the “Grapes of Wrath” desolation of Hemet into a working-class, suburban Valhalla.\n\nHemet’s role in the American dream went unnoticed by us new arrivals. We were billeted at a desolate migrant labor camp in an abandoned pecan grove on the ragged edge of town. We remained largely unaware of the Hemet or its inhabitants, whose population would not exceed 10,000 souls until the 1970 census.\n\nOur initial concern was adjusting to our spartan accommodations, a one-story line of dormitory rooms on a concrete slab, separated by a dirt courtyard from an identical set of rooms, which served as classrooms. Meals were taken in a large wooden building on the other side of the road. Both residential and classroom wings were bridged at one end by a shared bath facility. We were four to a room, in each corner of which we found a steel frame cot and thin mattress. A door and two windows completed the decor.\n\nOur other concern was the punishing curriculum, 28 hours a week of immersion language classes, 15 hours a week of basic agronomy, and 12 ½ hours a week of something called “Area Studies”, which consisted of instruction in the essential aspects of Moroccan customs and etiquette. Beyond the classroom, there were field trips to olive groves, date plantations, and the irrigated, industrial-scale agriculture sites of the Imperial Valley.\n\nBehind our barracks were a few acres of open field, where we were assigned individual irrigated plots to plant and cultivate. Our education included instruction in the production of adobe bricks, and rammed earth wall construction. Our six-day weeks, with morning, afternoon and evening classes, made for a grueling schedule, but we were left to our own devices on Sundays and holidays, which included, in our case, Thanksgiving, Christmas and the arrival of the New Year.\n\nThe days got shorter. Our struggles with an incomprehensible language, trying to find warmth enough for slumber under thin blankets through bone-chilling nights, as roommates snored and mumbled in their dreams, plus the seemingly random attrition of our numbers, all conspired to sap morale. We were becoming a brotherhood of shared hardship, but our camaraderie was, by necessity, tentative, as we were soon to be dispersed either by dreaded “de-selection” from the program, or when we were to be dispatched to solitary assignments across rural Morocco.\n\nA palpable sense of shock went through our ranks when one of us was drafted out of training. While education was an acceptable grounds for draft deferment, Peace Corps deferments were up to individual draft boards who didn’t always view trainee status as entitled to deferment. A few trainees left the program early for personal reasons, and a case of pneumonia sent at least one trainee home for medical reasons. By the end of training, our original 43 trainees had become a contingent of 30 volunteers, who, having endured the rigors of training, might succeed the ultimate test of surviving, and hopefully thriving, on their own in Morocco.\n\nPAINS & PLEASURES:\n\nOur 12 weeks of training in Hemet have left a few memorable impressions intact to this day, basic sustenance being one of them. The food provided by the training organization, the anonymously titled “Development & Resources Corp.”, was so bad that two months into training, it nearly provoked a mutiny. In one of my letters home, I described it as 40% fat and 50% carbohydrates. The cost of our upkeep, per head, was rumored to be $3.50 per day. After all, the more D&R spent on us, the less would be left for the company. On the bright side was the mid-morning visit by the Taco Truck, whose coffee and crunchy fare were often the high points of our day.\n\nLanguage training, all 336 hours of it, was brutal, but our Moroccan teachers were tireless, effective, and patient. In retrospect, it must have been much harder for them than it was for us. We spent hours on the pronunciation of sounds that don’t exist in English: glottal stops, unfamiliar consonants, tricky vowel sounds, and extravagantly rolled R’s.\n\nOur lazy, middle-of-the mouth, American English was no match for a language that demanded agility from the tip to the root of the tongue, lips and deepest recesses of the throat. We learned just enough darija, as Moroccan dialect is called, to learn some more. Our crash course in the language endowed us with the gift of comprehending, if only a little, the complexities of life in a culture very different and distant from our own.\n\nIn spite of our six-day work weeks, Sundays and holidays provided free time for all kinds of recreation, as long as it didn’t involve spending money. I’m not sure when our $75 a month salary kicked in, but our circumstances were, at the time, necessarily miserly and monastic. After weeks of admiring Mt. San Jacinto, rising to nearly 11,000 feet above the Hemet Valley, a small group of us decided to make the ascent. We were mostly naive easterners, and set out traveling light, without much food or water. It didn’t take long to figure out the error of our ways.\n\nWe ran out of water well before arriving at the summit, where the lone occupant of the Forestry Service fire lookout station studiously ignored our parched entreaties for water. Not all of our number succeeded in making the descent unaided, and our group had to separate, hoping to summon aid when one of us got to the town of Idyllwild at the foot of the mountain. Fortunately, another group of visitors, descending single file on a bunch of sturdy saddle mules, happened on our exhausted comrade and delivered him to the trail head. It was a sobering reminder, that despite our youthful energy, there were limits.\n\nThe program included, inexplicably, two horses, corralled in a small enclosure behind our barracks. They seemed to share the boredom of our long days off, and I found that the old gelding, Bub, enjoyed excursions in the sandy dry river bed that ran along the San Jacinto foot hills. It became a solitary source of joy to bridle up Bub, straddle his wide warm back, and set out for nowhere in particular. He was capable of a sweet rolling canter, but had an alarming tendency to stumble. Riding bareback, thin winter sunshine casting our long shadows on the valley floor in the cool waning days of 1967, was a singular pleasure.\n\nOn a less pleasant note, were the visits to the local doctor’s office, where we lined up to be injected with an endless variety of immunizations and vaccinations, each with its own level of discomfort. The last of these puncture parties featured the dreaded Gamma globulin shot, 5 cubic centimeters of thick amber liquid with the consistency of motor oil, delivered to the gluteus maximus. This slug of extra antibodies rendered us temporarily impervious to all manner of pathogens.\n\n“Deselection” was the official euphemism for being rejected from training, which could happen at any point if the staff determined that a trainee was lacking in either the aptitude or attitude for two years of service in Morocco. The most dreaded kind of deselection could occur at the very end of training, leaving the rejected volunteer to pack up his hard-won education and move on.\n\nFor some reason we trainees were asked to assess our peers, as if we could judge each others’ chances of success going forward, but ours was not to reason why. On the last day, one of our more flamboyant and likable trainees, a California dude, was sent home, which left us in a state of sadness mixed with relief at having gotten through the ordeal, anticipating a return to the comforts of home and family for three days before convening at JFK, at last, Morocco bound.\n\nPOST SCRIPT:\n\nArriving in Morocco, we had two more weeks of training and orientation before heading out to our assigned posts. One of our assignments involved trying out the most basic of Moroccan agricultural practices, guiding a traditional wooden plow behind a mule. It was a humbling experience. The only metal part of this ungainly tool was a flat iron blade that scratched a shallow furrow into the earth. We had brought with us a brand new iron moldboard plow. Its curved blade, first designed by Thomas Jefferson, and later patented at the turn of the 19th century, not only cut a furrow, but turned the soil over like a breaking wave.\n\nThe traditional Moroccan plow was about two centuries behind the times, and the improvement, in our eyes, was striking. We proudly presented the new plow to the farmer who had participated in the demonstration. He seemed mildly appreciative, but somewhat nonplussed by this newfangled gadget, just as his American counterparts had greeted the introduction of the same newfangled moldboard plow with equal skepticism 167 years earlier.\n\nMorocco X, was never to realize its potential. The Mexican Wheat, and the USAID Program to introduce it was delayed. Our volunteers in the field became redundant onlookers in a bureaucratic system that was barely functional to begin with. Our language skills, while appreciated, were inadequate in an administrative environment that relied heavily on the French language, as Morocco had only gained independence from the French protectorate in 1956, eleven years before our arrival.\n\nA kindly Belgian agronomist in the Taza Provincial office offered me a place as his assistant in a UN Funded program to introduce modern techniques of bee-keeping to farmers in the Rif mountains. Honey was a popular commodity and a valuable cash crop. Apiculture was a good option for farmers who lacked enough arable land to provide for their families. After a month of training with an old Belgian pied noir, who bellowed “praise God” every time I was stung by the ferociously aggressive African bees, I finally had a mission whose only drawback was its seasonality. To fill in the winter off-season, I became an English language teacher at the local Taza Lycée.\n\nMorocco X was officially disbanded at the mid-service conference. Some volunteers who had found work at the more active provincial agricultural centers, or other more specialized areas of endeavor, would stay on to finish their two-year term of service, or even extend for a third year. The rest were offered a plane ticket back to the States or transfer to other programs.\n\nAn “Evaluator”, sent from Washington to ascertain the nature of Morocco X’s thwarted ambitions, observed, in a moment of candor, that he had never seen such a promising group of volunteers so poorly tasked or deployed.\n\nAs the philosopher Kierkegaard observed, “Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.” The Morocco X experience may have been an exercise in blind optimism, and the futility of good intentions, but for many of us the struggle to start life from scratch in a foreign culture demanded an intensity of self-examination and self-realization that gave us the will and the way to a larger sphere of life, “lived forwards”.\n\nFor some of us the experience was a gateway to careers in education and international development, for others the experience opened the door to experiencing a world we could not otherwise have imagined. Morocco X, whatever its faults, changed each of us in profound and simple ways that have resonated throughout life that “can only be understood backwards”.\n\nAuthored by Reed Erskine, Morocco X Volunteer\n\nIn the middle of the first snow storm of the winter, with the temperature near or below 0° F and wind chills 20 or 30 degrees lower, every reason to stay indoors is a good one, though I did walk to the road to get the Sunday morning newspaper. Niagara County has issued a traffic advisory, counseling drivers to stay off the roads unless it is absolutely essential. Even Lucky, our male cat, who normally demands to be let out early so he can pad around, sniffing out the intruders of the night before and marking his territory, only went out once. The snow was deep and very cold, and when Lucky ran back in after five minutes, he never asked to go out again. As storms go, this was a good one, but we have certainly seen much worse. Our driveway has been plowed for us, so we are not housebound except by choice. These few days of winter are ones that one enjoys best inside. Winter has settled in for awhile, so why shouldn’t we?\n\nWe subscribe to a number of magazines, and often they go unread, piling up in unvisited corners of the house. I try to keep them as long as I can, imaging that I will find some time to read them, but I often end up only skimming them or tossing them unread.\n\nSettling in with the storm, I picked up the latest issue of the New York Review of Books,which had just arrived. The first article was a review, by a Mexican writer, of Alfonso Cuarón’s new movie, Roma. If you are a fan of the movies, you will probably have noted that this autobiographical film about the life of a nanny in a middle class Mexican household has garnered critical acclaim, and is an Oscar contender. The reviewer related her own life directly to the movie: she had grown up in a similar situation. Indeed, it was common for those who could afford it to take on nannies and cooks from impoverished rural areas. These women ended up as primary caregivers to children of others, while sometimes their own children lived far away in their native villages. This was the best they could do. They traded abject poverty for meager positions where loneliness and mistreatment and neglect were common. Any love they gave and received was often only from the children for whom they cared. This is one of the themes of Roma.\n\nFor Americans, the live-in nanny is an unusual profession, and only wealthy Americans can afford one. I grew up in a generation of stay-at-home moms, but today two-wage earner families are the norm, and childcare is a common problem. With mobility often a requirement for employment, Americans change residences frequently, and often live far from their own parents and other relatives. Day care and more makeshift arrangements are expensive, and many parents look forward to the time when their children finally begin school, when the need for day care is reduced to a few after-school hours. In Europe au pair girls often fulfill the role of the nanny, trading pay for a chance to learn a foreign language and culture, but, like nannies, au pairs in America are expensive and rather exotic.\n\nIn poor societies, lack of employment means that women will often take jobs as domestic servants. This was the case in Morocco, even though there was a strong bias against work outside the home, and women who did it were looked down upon. Rules of modesty were necessarily abandoned by a woman working outside in another’s home Sometimes a poor country relative was taken in, and often treated much as a Cinderella. Many of the French coopérants hired bonnes, maids, to help them. Working for foreign non-Muslims didn’t help a woman’s status, but it was better than nothing. In France, having a bonne was perhaps more common than for an American woman to have hired help, and the word maid, in American English, certainly has strong associations with upper-class living.\n\nWhen I began my work at a primary school chicken cooperative in the Habouna neighborhood of Sefrou, I replaced two volunteers who had employed a young woman to clean for them. Her name was Khadija, and she came daily. At the end of the summer of that same year, another Morocco X volunteer, Gaylord Barr, proposed that we rent a house in the medina, the old walled part of town. He moved out of a small European style house high above the ville nouvelle, the French-built new town. It was a long, steep walk to his house, and the house was far from everything. I moved out of the little block building in the yard of the school garden, a dwelling that I can easily say had the least privacy imaginable outside of a bidonville or a medina tenement. It was coveted by the chaoush (a kind of page or messenger), and, in the end, he got it. In addition to better housing, both of us looked forward to living within the medina walls. At the time, we naively thought of that as being in the authentic Morocco. In fact, it was the Morocco of the poor. Today, the medina of Sefrou is degenerating into a slum, and there have been calls to preserve it.\n\nWith the two of us in a substantial house, we needed help, and, with two Peace Corps allowances, modest as they were, paying for it was not difficult. So Khadija came to work for the two of us. Hiring help was not an uncommon practice among volunteers, but not every volunteer had a maid to clean and cook, nor did everyone want one.\n\nI never asked Khadija how old she was, and though she had an identity card with a birthdate, it might have been wrong. I think she was about my age, or possibly slightly older.\n\nPoor Moroccan women tended to age quickly. She was not an old woman in any case. Her surname was Demnati, which suggests that her family was from the place of that name. I remember her husband, Ali, talking about the famine in Marrakesh, and Demnat is not far from Marrakesh.\n\nShe did not speak Berber, as far as I know, though she would not have had any occasion to do so in our house. Ali had served in the French army in Vietnam, and sympathized with American soldiers at the time. Indochina was not a fond memory. He lived on his military pension, and it was not much, so Khadija’s wages contributed substantially to the family income. He had been married before, because he had a son, Mohammed, who lived with them. The three of them shared a house in the medina, with two or three other families. Khadija had no children of her own.\n\nKhadija had no formal education, and could not read or write, which was not unusual considering her generation and social class. She had no trouble with arithmetic or handling money, however. Since Khadija spoke no French, her employment was limited further, but the volunteers of Morocco X were trained in dialectical Arabic, so Khadija’s daily language was fine for us, and speaking with her gave us constant practice as well as information about what was going on in the world. We never attempted to teach her English.\n\nKhadija’s duties were limited, though it might not seem so as I list them. She would shop, bake bread, cook, do laundry and clean house.\n\nShe made lunch, and there was usually enough for dinner in the evening. She usually arrived about 8:00 in the morning. Once I began working in Fes, I would only see her on weekends or on holidays, but I knew there would be food waiting when I arrived home, often at seven or eight in the evening.\n\nIf we had guests, she would work extra time. When Khadija needed time for something personal, she was always able to take it.\n\nFrom the point of view of a Moroccan domestic, she had a good job. I think we paid more than the going rate, about $20.00 per month, and we were not demanding. When she made bread for us in the morning, she made her own bread, often I suspect, with our flour, but that was okay with us. When there was extra food, she could take it home for her family, and we gave her things we did not need and took her to Fes to the dentist and doctor when needed.\n\nShe in return did us favors. When we had women visit, she would take them to the hammam (the public baths) or to fortune tellers or whatever women’s activity they were interested in.\n\nShe also took care of the numerous pets: cats, doves, canaries, tortoises, hamsters. Changing the cat litter, which was straw, was a nasty job, although the cats eventually helped out by using the roof of the room on the terrace, to which there was no easy access, as a giant cat box!\n\nKhadija did laundry (and rugs) in a large galvanized tub on the roof where the laundry was also hung to dry. Gaylord and I sometimes used this tub to take baths, when we couldn’t get to the neighborhood hammam.\n\nIt was just large enough to sit in, if you crossed your legs. I’d put a couple of kettles on the stove, drag the tub to the bathroom, which was the only room on the ground floor, and mix the hot and cold waters. The house had no hot water, and I don’t recall anything in the bathroom except a Turkish toilet, though there was probably a tiny wash basin. After a bath, you just dumped the bath water into the toilet hole. You were warm as long as the water in your tub stayed warm, and until the kettles ran out of fresh rinse water.\n\nKhadija cooked from the room we called a kitchen, though it had no running water. The water was on the landing, at the main level of the house, that marked the division between the stairs that led to the roof and those that went down to the bathroom and front door. This was where dishes were washed though I think there were sunny days when pots and pans were done on the roof.\n\nSince the stove sat on a cupboard, the food was cooked standing, but much of the preparation was done as Khadija sat on the floor. As a poor woman, her cooking repertoire was probably limited, but I have never eaten as well since, and she could make all the standard Moroccan fare.\n\nOn Aid es-Seghir we would visit her house to break the fast. One year we joined in buying a sheep with her for Aid el-Kbir, and it was kept on the roof. We called it Messaoud, an ironic name, and for the several months it lived above us, I could hear the the patter of its hooves.\n\nIt was playful too, and would chase you if you encouraged it. After keeping it a couple of months, it was almost like a pet. If it were possible to later describe your pet as delicious.\n\nKhadija was really a kind of nanny. She took care of us in good health and in sickness, and did her best giving advice about dealing with the life about us as well as the supernatural. Moroccans, often superstitious, worried about the evil eye and malicious spirits. Khadija warned us about pouring hot water down the drain (it would anger the jinn that lived there) and leaving our clothes in disarray when we went to sleep (jinn would wear them and bring illness to the owners.)\n\nShe was an intermediary with our neighbors and shopkeepers too, and I am sure she helped us develop relationships with some of them. I don’t know if Khadija loved us with the love the nanny in Roma had for her employer’s children, but the affection she showed was real, and we often treated her more as a friend or a parent than as a servant. I sure she was often exasperated too, by the stupid things we did.\n\nI left Morocco in the late summer of 1971. Gaylord had reenlisted for another year of teaching at the Lycée Sidi Lahcen Lyoussi. Returning from Tunisia, he contracted typhoid, and had to be evacuated to a U.S. military hospital in Spain where he spent a couple of months. During that time, Khadija watched the house and took care of the pets. Before Gaylord left in July 1972, he used some of the money he had saved to invest in a business in which Khadija would be co-owner, but, according to Khadija, her partner absconded with the stock and she ended up with nothing. It was tough for a woman to enforce her rights.\n\nIn 1973 I returned to Sefrou for a few months, and rented a place to live. I hired Khadija again. Gaylord visited Sefrou in the late 1990s, and saw her again too. She was working for a French national in the ville nouvelle, and hoping Gaylord, on his way home from Saudi Arabia, would give her money. He was put off by her behavior and complained bitterly about it to me in his description of his visit. I was frankly surprised.\n\nLooking back, I wish I had got to know Khadija better. She might have had it easy working for us, but she had a hard life, as most of the people of her social status did. I felt for her then as I do for her now. If I had planned to be an anthropologist, I would have had four years to document her life. In retrospect, I marvel at how little I knew about her. I never learned how she married, who her friends and relatives were, and how she practiced her religion. Gaylord knew her far better than I, but he has sadly gone. I also would have liked to help her more than I did, but when I left Sefrou that chapter of my life ended. There was no easy way to stay in touch with someone who could not read or write, and the computer era had yet to dawn."
