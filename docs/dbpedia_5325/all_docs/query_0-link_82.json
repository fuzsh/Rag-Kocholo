Reed\" <j.v.reed@mail.utexas.edu> Subject: 1284 and OFF Date: Tue, 28 Dec 1999 03:55:39 +0000 Sender: soc-casi-discuss-request@lists.cam.ac.uk >what is Iraq's position regarding the return of inspectors? US >newspapers (as you know) are not the best at providing context >for the quotations they select. >Some of them indicate that >Iraq will never accept the return of inspections, period. >Other >articles indicate that Iraq would accept inspectors, but >only if sanctions were lifted (not >suspended) entirely, and >only if they were lifted prior to the inspectors return. This >>distinction is important and I do not know the answer. What >are your feelings on this matter? There is an Australian site that connects you to over 5000 thousand newspapers that are available on the Internet. Below is the sites address, instructions on how to get to the newspaper page, and their list of the countries for which they have at least 1 newspaper listing. Its perfect (no, not as a birthday or wedding gift) for accessing news without the American filter, as well as for finding out publicly announced government positions through state news agencies I have also included two other sites that restrict their connections to newspapers germane to the Middle East, sorted by country of origin, and in that in one instance lists the language in which the newspaper is written. >The UNSC voted to renew Oil For Food for 6 months. Later, the >UNSC also passed Res. 1284 which >lifted the ceiling on oil >exports altogether. Does Iraq's rejection of the inspection >>provisions of the resolution nullify the elimination of the >export ceiling as well? In light of >these changes, what is the >situation for Iraqi oil industries? I am confused about what >the UN >policy is after the recent fiasco and what the impact of >these decisions will be. My understanding is that the UN Security Council does not need Iraqi approval to validate any resolution relevant to that country. Now it is true that some of the resolutions stipulations require Iraqi cooperation [E.g., the reinsertion of weapons inspectors], but that is an issue of implementation that is dependent on decisions made and actions carried out by the Iraqi government. The oil cap is twisted on and controlled by the Security Council, and can be removed with or without Iraqi consent. 1284s paragraph 15 [section C] does not state that the import of any volume of petroleum and petroleum products originating in Iraq is contingent upon Iraqi compliance with Resolution 1284. Therefore, it seems that this is an example of a 1284 mandate that is outside the control of the Iraqi government, the cap has been unturned and will, for the time being, continue to remain off independently of any Iraqi government responses to Resolution 1284.
