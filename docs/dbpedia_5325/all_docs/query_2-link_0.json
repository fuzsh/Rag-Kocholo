        "text": "Afrotopia by Felwine Sarr\n\nCall Number: DT14 .S27 2016\n\nISBN: 9781452962511\n\nA vibrant meditation and poetic call for an African utopian philosophy of self-reinvention for the twenty-first century In the recent aftermath of colonialism, civil wars, and the AIDS crisis, a new day finally seems to be shining on the African continent. Africa has once again become a site of creative potential and a vibrant center of economic growth and production. No longer stigmatized by stereotypes or encumbered by the traumas of the past--yet unsure of the future--Africa has other options than simply to follow paths already carved out by the global economy. Instead, the philosopher Felwine Sarr urges the continent to set out on its own renewal and self-discovery--an active utopia that requires a deep historical reflection on the continent's vast mythological universe and ancient traditions, nourishes a cultural reinvention, and embraces green technologies for tackling climate change and demographic challenges. Through a reflection on contemporary African writers, artists, intellectuals, and musicians, Sarr elaborates Africa's unique philosophies and notions of communal value and economy deeply rooted in its ancient traditions and landscape--concepts such as ubuntu, the life force in Dogon culture; the Rwandan imihigo; and the Senegalese teranga. Sarr takes the reader on a philosophical journey that is as much inward as outward, demanding an elevation of the collective consciousness. Along the way, one sees the contours of an africanity, a contemporary Africa united as a continent through the creolization of its cultural traditions. This is Felwine Sarr's Afrotopia. English translation by Drew S. Burk and Sarah Jones-Boardman.\n\nBroken Glass by Alain Mabanckou; Helen Stevenson (Translator); Uzodinma Iweala (Introduction by)\n\nCall Number: PQ3989.2.M217 V4713 2018\n\nISBN: 9781593763077\n\n\"A man sits in a bar, ruminating on his own failures and conversing with an ensemble of memorable characters that pass in and out of the same space. It's archetypal stuff, but Mabanckou transforms it into a work that intimately inhabits its narrator's mind even as it makes a host of bold literary allusions, from Paul Laurence Dunbar to Eugène Ionesco. A new introduction to this edition by Uzodinma Iweala offers varied and nuanced insights into the novel's themes as well as the initial reception it received when it first appeared in translation.\" --Words Without Borders In Republic of the Congo, in the town of Trois-Cents, in a bar called Credit Gone West, a former schoolteacher known as Broken Glass drinks red wine and records the stories of the bar and its regulars, including Stubborn Snail, the owner, who must battle church people, ex-alcoholics, tribal leaders, and thugs set on destroying him and his business; the Printer, who had his respectable life in France ruined by a white woman, his wife; Robinette, who could outdrink and outpiss any man until a skinny-legged stranger challenged her reign; and Broken Glass himself, whose own tale involves as much heartbreak, squalor, disappointment, and delusion. A brand-new edition of an irreverent, allusive, scatalogical, tragicomic masterpiece from one of our greatest living Francophone writers. [Le verre cassé]\n\nEt les yeux pour me dire by Birago Diop\n\nCall Number: PQ3989.2.D55 Z47 1978 vol. 5\n\nISBN: 2738403336\n\nBirago Diop (1906-1989) was born in Sénégal, but he did his studies in France in veterinary medicine. He began writing poems and was inspired by African folklore and is responsible for bringing a rebirth of interest in this subject area. He is also one of the leaders of the Négritude literary movement. A true Renaissance Man, Diop excelled in a variety of endeavors including not only his medical practice and his writing, but also his ability to serve in a diplomatic function. He was nominated as the first Senegalese ambassador to Tunisia after Senegal gained its independence-leading to his famous \"broken pen\" proclamation implying that he was done with writing. Still, he published La plume raboutée in 1978, followed by À rebrousse-temps (1982), À rebrousse-gens (1982), and Senegal du temps de...(1986). His stories and poems still entertain and promote African values and culture.\n\nEve Out of Her Ruins by Ananda Devi\n\nCall Number: PQ3989.2.N547 E9513 2016\n\nISBN: 9781941920404\n\n\"Devi writes about terrible and bitter events with a soft, delicate voice.\" -- Le Figaro Included in World Literature Today's \"75 Notable Translations of 2016\" With brutal honesty and poetic urgency, Ananda Devi relates the tale of four young Mauritians trapped in their country's endless cycle of fear and violence: Eve, whose body is her only weapon and source of power; Savita, Eve's best friend, the only one who loves Eve without self-interest, who has plans to leave but will not go alone; Saadiq, gifted would-be poet, inspired by Rimbaud, in love with Eve; Clélio, belligerent rebel, waiting without hope for his brother to send for him from France. Eve out of Her Ruins is a heartbreaking look at the dark corners of the island nation of Mauritius that tourists never see, and a poignant exploration of the construction of personhood at the margins of society. Awarded the prestigious Prix des cinq continents upon publication as the best book written in French outside of France, Eve Out of her Ruins is a harrowing account of the violent reality of life in her native country by the figurehead of Mauritian literature. The book featurues an original introduction by Nobel Prize winner J.M.G. Le Clézio, who declares Devi \"a truly great writer.\" Ananda Devi (b. 1957, Trois-Boutiques, Mauritius) is a novelist and scholar. She has published eleven novels as well as short stories and poetry, and was featured at the PEN World Voices Festival in New York in 2015.

[Ève de ses décombres]\n\nIn the Company of Men by Véronique Tadjo\n\nCall Number: PQ3989.2.T25\n\nISBN: 9781635420968\n\nDrawing on real accounts of the Ebola outbreak that devastated West Africa, this poignant, timely fable reflects on both the strength and the fragility of life and humanity's place in the world. Two boys venture from their village to hunt in a nearby forest, where they shoot down bats with glee, and cook their prey over an open fire. Within a month, they are dead, bodies ravaged by an insidious disease that neither the local healer's potions nor the medical team's treatments could cure. Compounding the family's grief, experts warn against touching the sick. But this caution comes too late: the virus spreads rapidly, and the boys' father is barely able to send his eldest daughter away for a chance at survival. In a series of moving snapshots, Véronique Tadjo illustrates the terrible extent of the Ebola epidemic, through the eyes of those affected in myriad ways: the doctor who tirelessly treats patients day after day in a sweltering tent, protected from the virus only by a plastic suit; the student who volunteers to work as a gravedigger while universities are closed, helping the teams overwhelmed by the sheer number of bodies; the grandmother who agrees to take in an orphaned boy cast out of his village for fear of infection. And watching over them all is the ancient and wise Baobab tree, mourning the dire state of the earth yet providing a sense of hope for the future. Acutely relevant to our times in light of the coronavirus pandemic, In the Company of Men explores critical questions about how we cope with a global crisis and how we can combat fear and prejudice.\n\nLeft to Tell by Steve Erwin (Contribution by); Immaculee Ilibagiza\n\nCall Number: BX4705.I46 A3 2014\n\nISBN: 9781401944322\n\nImmaculee Ilibagiza grew up in a country she loved, surrounded by a family she cherished. But in 1994 her idyllic world was ripped apart as Rwanda descended into a bloody genocide. Immaculee's family was brutally murdered during a killing spree that lasted three months and claimed the lives of nearly a million Rwandans. Incredibly, Immaculee survived the slaughter. For 91 days, she and seven other women huddled silently together in the cramped bathroom of a local pastor while hundreds of machete-wielding killers hunted for them. It was during those endless hours of unspeakable terror that Immaculee discovered the power of prayer, eventually shedding her fear of death and forging a profound and lasting relationship with God. She emerged from her bathroom hideout having discovered the meaning of truly unconditional love--a love so strong she was able seek out and forgive her family's killers. The triumphant story of this remarkable young woman's journey through the darkness of genocide will inspire anyone whose life has been touched by fear, suffering, and loss.\n\nMurambi, the Book of Bones by Boubacar Boris Diop\n\nCall Number: PQ3989.2.D553 M8713 2016\n\nISBN: 9780253023421\n\nIn April of 1994, nearly a million Rwandans were killed in what would prove to be one of the swiftest, most terrifying killing sprees of the 20th century. In Murambi, The Book of Bones, Boubacar Boris Diop comes face to face with the chilling horror and overwhelming sadness of the tragedy. Here, the power of Diop's acclaimed novel is available to English-speaking readers through Fiona Mc Laughlin's crisp translation and a compelling afterword by Diop. The novel recounts the story of a Rwandan history teacher, Cornelius Uvimana, who was living and working in Djibouti at the time of the massacre. He returns to Rwanda to try to comprehend the death of his family and to write a play about the events that took place there. As the novel unfolds, Cornelius begins to understand that it is only our humanity that will save us, and that as a writer, he must bear witness to the atrocities of the genocide. Translated by Fiona Mc Laughlin.\n\nOn Black Sisters Street by Chika Unigwe\n\nCall Number: PT6467.31.N54 F3813 2009\n\nISBN: 9781400068333\n\nChika Unigwe is a Nigerian-born Igbo author who was based in Belgium until moving to the United States. She writes in both English and Dutch. On Black Sisters Street marks the U.S. publication debut of Nigerian-born, Igbo, Chika Unigwe, a brilliant new writer and a standout voice among contemporary African authors. Raw, vivid, unforgettable, and inspired by a powerful oral storytelling tradition, this novel illuminates the dream of the West--and that dream's illusion and annihilation--as seen through African eyes. It is a story of courage, unity, and hope, of women's friendships and of bonds that, once forged, cannot be broken. On Black Sisters Street tells the haunting story of four very different women who have left their African homeland for the riches of Europe--and who are thrown together by bad luck and big dreams into a sisterhood that will change their lives. Each night, Sisi, Ama, Efe, and Joyce stand in the windows of Antwerp's red-light district, promising to make men's desires come true--if only for half an hour. Pledged to the fierce Madam and a mysterious pimp named Dele, the girls share an apartment but little else--they keep their heads down, knowing that one step out of line could cost them a week's wages. They open their bodies to strangers but their hearts to no one, each focused on earning enough to get herself free, to send money home or save up for her own future. Then, suddenly, a murder shatters the still surface of their lives. Drawn together by tragedy and the loss of one of their own, the women realize that they must choose between their secrets and their safety. As they begin to tell their stories, their confessions reveal the face in Efe's hidden photograph, Ama's lifelong search for a father, Joyce's true name, and Sisi's deepest secrets---and all their tales of fear, displacement, and love, concluding in a chance meeting with a handsome, sinister stranger.\n\nPerspectives on French Colonial Madagascar by Eric T. Jennings\n\nCall Number: Digital Publication\n\nISBN: 9781137559678\n\nThis book is a vivid history of Madagascar from the pre-colonial era to decolonization, examining a set of French colonial projects and perceptions that revolve around issues of power, vulnerability, health, conflict, control and identity. It focuses on three lines of inquiry: the relationship between domination and health fears, the island's role during the two world wars, and the mystery of Malagasy origins. The Madagascar that emerges is plural and fractured. It is the site of colonial dystopias, grand schemes gone awry, and diverse indigenous reactions. Bringing together deep archival research and recent scholarship, Jennings sheds light on the colonial project in Madagascar, and more broadly, on the ideas which underpin colonialism. Contents 1. Introduction -- I. Health, Power and Vulnerability -- 2. Disease and Conquest -- 3. Rabies and Resistance -- II. The Great Island in Global Conflict, 1914-1945 -- 4. The Black Angel of Antananarivo -- 5. Tyranny in the Wartime Central Highlands -- III. The Mystery of Malagasy Origins -- 6. Writing Madagascar Back into the Madagascar Plan -- 7. Recasting Madagascar: Village Structures, Racial Anthropology, and the Meanings of Cliff Markings.\n\nThe Season of Shadow by Léonora Miano; Gila Walker (Translator)\n\nCall Number: MLCS 2019/50183 (P)\n\nISBN: 9780857424808\n\nThis powerful novel presents the early days of the transatlantic slave trade from a new perspective: that of the sub-Saharan population that became its first victims. Cameroonian novelist Léonora Miano presents a world on the brink of disappearing--a pre-colonial civilization with roots that stretch back for centuries. One day, a group of villagers find twelve of their people missing. Where have they gone? Who is responsible? A collective dream, troubling a group of mothers in a communal dwelling, may have some of the answers, as the women's missing sons call to them in terr∨ at the same time, a thick shadow settles over the huts, blocking out the light of day. It is the shadow of slavery, which will soon grow to blight the whole world. Miano renders this brutal story in deliberately strange, dreamlike prose, befitting a situation that is, on its face, all but impossible for the villagers to believe."
