        "text": "Sciences Po has particularly strong ties to the vast region stretching from North Africa to Iran. This is reflected in a large number of university exchange partnerships, and in a rich research output: with around 20 researchers specialising in the region, Sciences Po is one of the leading European universities for Middle Eastern and North African Studies.\n\nThe Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is also home to the largest network of French and French-speaking lycÃ©es in the world. Sciences Po has a very active outreach policy aimed at these schools specifically, as well as at English-speaking schools and major universities.\n\n16 nationalities in the MENA region are represented within our student body (excluding executive programmes), while Sciences Po very frequently rates as the most popular exchange destination in France and Europe for students at our partner universities.\n\nSciences Po's partners in the Middle East and North Africa\n\nThe MENA region boastsÂ a particularly diverse range of universities and programmes, with a number of multidisciplinary universities and business schools offering courses in English, French, Turkish, Arabic and Hebrew. Intensive language courses in Arabic and Hebrew are also available for students interested in working or conducting research in the region, or who are preparing for civil service recruitment examinations.\n\nSciences Po has established partnerships withÂ 31 universities, inÂ 11 countries throughout the region:Â Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Israel, Palestine, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. These partnerships are principally focused on facilitating exchange programmes for students, researchers and professors.\n\nAmong its partners, Sciences Po has developed especially dynamic relationships with certain universities, including UniversitÃ© Mohammed 6 Polytechnique (UM6P) in Morocco, the American University of Cairo in Egypt, the American University of Beirut and UniversitÃ© Saint-Joseph in Lebanon, Al Quds University in Palestine, Tel Aviv University in Israel, Bogazici University in Turkey, the Doha Institute in Qatar, and the Anwar Gargash Diplomatic Academy in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe popularity of the MENA region as an exchange destination for our students increases steadily year on year. Almost 140 Sciences Po undergraduate and Masterâs students opt to study in the region annually, the majority in Egypt, Israel and Turkey. Â Â"
