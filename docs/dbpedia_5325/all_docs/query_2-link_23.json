        "text": "Arabic has been described as a language with too many armies and navies (R.L.G. 2013), meaning it has traveled far and wide over the past 1400 years and has evolved into many different dialects that are mutually unintelligible to one another. In fact, the only standardized version of Arabic is in the Qur’an. Based on this, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) has been developed to meet the needs of the modern world, but rarely is it efficient since hardly any Arabic speakers actually use this dialect.\n\nDespite the diversity of Arabic, it still bounds many cultures of North Africa to the Islamic identity. To many, the Arabic language represents the essence of their being, making it a vehicle of communication, Islam and expressing cultural identity. In a sense, Arabic is a language that is deeply attached to ideology and spirituality of those who speak it. However, the Arabic language is in many ways in competition with French in the Maghrebi states.\n\nFrench is an official language of 21 African countries. Many of those countries are in North or West Africa, often referred to as the Maghreb. French is a functional language for business and politics because it is more standardized than Arabic. France also has close economic relations with the Maghreb. Therefore, French is used for the majority of trade transactions. However, the French language also represents the time of colonization for the many North African states and though it may be an efficient language for modern demands, it conflicts with the traditional values of the Islamic states.\n\nI chose different articles to display how French and Arabic function in the Maghreb states on a social, political and economic level. The First article describes how France came to rule the Maghreb, what French colonial policy was like and how the people living in that region assimilated to France’s rule. The articles titled “The Discourse of Identity in the Maghreb between Difference and Universality” and “The Linguistic Rivalry between the Symbolic and the Utilitarian: The Case of Arabic and French,” aptly displays how Arabic and French are linked to present day politics. The articles discuss how Arabic was used as a means of resistance to French colonial policies. However, upon decolonization, the new governments were forced to carry on French policies and language as a way of transition. Following decolonization, many Arabization policies were put into play, but the utility of the French language in the modern world has kept French alive in Africa. This creates a conflict of maintaining the identity of Arabs without provoking fear or dislike for western policy (Abdeljelil 2007).\n\nThe pictures below include a map of colonial Africa in 1914 and a couple of signs from Algeria and Morocco that display both French and Arabic. The first sign is a street sign while the second sign is a storefront sign. Businesses are especially prone to advertising in French since it is the language of modernization and development. Furthermore, most high tech items are either imported from France or have French names to signify their quality. Therefore, French has a prestigious association with business and commerce.\n\nThe video titled “Kateb Yacine and the Arabic language,” is an interview with the French-Algerian writer, Kateb Yacine in 1956. At the time of the interview, Algeria was still under French rule but Kateb comments on the dichotomy between French and Arabic and how the movement to Arabization would later manifest. The second video, “English speaking in Morocco on the increase,” is a report on how English is on the rise in Morocco and French is on its way out. Many Moroccans are draw to English because it offers many opportunities with international businesses from the US to China. Furthermore, English is considered a language of all ethnicities and nationalities and not associated with Morocco’s colonial past. Therefore English proposes an alternative to the French language as a medium of communication in the modern world. The last video is various interviews with Arabic speakers about what Arabic means to them.\n\nArticles:\n\nThe Linguistic Rivalry Between the Symbolic and the Utilitarian: The Case of Arabic and French\n\nThe Discourse of Identity in the Maghreb between Difference and Universality\n\nFrench Colonization in the Maghreb\n\nPictures:\n\nVideos:\n\nKateb Yacine and the Arabic language"
