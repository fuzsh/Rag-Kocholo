        "text": "Relating genes to function: identifying enriched transcription factors using the ENCODE ChIP-Seq significance tool.\n\nPubMed\n\nAuerbach, Raymond K; Chen, Bin; Butte, Atul J\n\n2013-08-01\n\nBiological analysis has shifted from identifying genes and transcripts to mapping these genes and transcripts to biological functions. The ENCODE Project has generated hundreds of ChIP-Seq experiments spanning multiple transcription factors and cell lines for public use, but tools for a biomedical scientist to analyze these data are either non-existent or tailored to narrow biological questions. We present the ENCODE ChIP-Seq Significance Tool, a flexible web application leveraging public ENCODE data to identify enriched transcription factors in a gene or transcript list for comparative analyses. The ENCODE ChIP-Seq Significance Tool is written in JavaScript on the client side and has been tested on Google Chrome, Apple Safari and Mozilla Firefox browsers. Server-side scripts are written in PHP and leverage R and a MySQL database. The tool is available at http://encodeqt.stanford.edu. abutte@stanford.edu Supplementary material is available at Bioinformatics online.\n\nEfficiently Identifying Significant Associations in Genome-wide Association Studies\n\nPubMed Central\n\nEskin, Eleazar\n\n2013-01-01\n\nAbstract Over the past several years, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated hundreds of genes in common disease. More recently, the GWAS approach has been utilized to identify regions of the genome that harbor variation affecting gene expression or expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Unlike GWAS applied to clinical traits, where only a handful of phenotypes are analyzed per study, in eQTL studies, tens of thousands of gene expression levels are measured, and the GWAS approach is applied to each gene expression level. This leads to computing billions of statistical tests and requires substantial computational resources, particularly when applying novel statistical methods such as mixed models. We introduce a novel two-stage testing procedure that identifies all of the significant associations more efficiently than testing all the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In the first stage, a small number of informative SNPs, or proxies, across the genome are tested. Based on their observed associations, our approach locates the regions that may contain significant SNPs and only tests additional SNPs from those regions. We show through simulations and analysis of real GWAS datasets that the proposed two-stage procedure increases the computational speed by a factor of 10. Additionally, efficient implementation of our software increases the computational speed relative to the state-of-the-art testing approaches by a factor of 75.

In this regard, we considered identifying molecular subtypes associated with clinicopathological factor as prognosis factors to stratify PDAC for appropriate treatment of patients. Results In this study, we identified three molecular subtypes which were significant on survival time and metastasis. We also identified significant genes and enriched pathways represented for each molecular subtype. Considering R0 resection patients included in each subtype, metastasis and survival times are significantly associated with subtype 1 and subtype 2. Conclusions We observed three PDAC molecular subtypes and demonstrated that those subtypes were significantly related with metastasis and survival time. The study may have utility in stratifying patients for cancer treatment.

In biological terms, living and reproducing are essentially one and the same. There is, therefore, no sharp division between identifying factors harmful to reproduction and identifying factors harmful to life or vice versa. Detection of harmful factors requires balanced use of a variety of methodologies from databases on structure-activity relationships through in vitro and in vivo test systems of varying complexity to surveys of wildlife and human populations. Human surveys provide the only assured means of discriminating between real and imagined harmful factors, but they are time consuming and provide information after the harm has been done. Test systems with whole animals provide the best prospects for identifying harmful factors quickly, but currently available methods used for testing agrochemicals and drugs need a thorough overhaul before they can provide a role model. Whether there is a need for new methodology is doubtful. More certain is the need to use existing methodology more wisely. We need a better understanding of the environment--whatever it is--and a more thoughtful approach to investigation of multifactorial situations.

According to the clinical heterogeneity, prostate cancer displays different stages and grades related to the aggressive metastasis disease. Although numerous studies used microarray analysis and traditional clustering method to identify the individual genes during the disease processes, the important gene regulations remain unclear. We present a computational method for inferring genetic regulatory networks from micorarray data automatically with transcription factor analysis and conditional independence testing to explore the potential significant gene regulatory networks that are correlated with cancer, tumor grade and stage in the prostate cancer. To deal with missing values in microarray data, we used a K-nearest-neighbors (KNN) algorithm to determine the precise expression values. We applied web services technology to wrap the bioinformatics toolkits and databases to automatically extract the promoter regions of DNA sequences and predicted the transcription factors that regulate the gene expressions. We adopt the microarray datasets consists of 62 primary tumors, 41 normal prostate tissues from Stanford Microarray Database (SMD) as a target dataset to evaluate our method. The predicted results showed that the possible biomarker genes related to cancer and denoted the androgen functions and processes may be in the development of the prostate cancer and promote the cell death in cell cycle. Our predicted results showed that sub-networks of genes SREBF1, STAT6 and PBX1 are strongly related to a high extent while ETS transcription factors ELK1, JUN and EGR2 are related to a low extent.

(Author/JKS)\n\nGenome-wide association study for rotator cuffÂ tears identifies two significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms.\n\nPubMed\n\nTashjian, Robert Z; Granger, Erin K; Farnham, James M; Cannon-Albright, Lisa A; Teerlink, Craig C\n\n2016-02-01\n\nThe precise etiology of rotator cuff disease is unknown, but prior evidence suggests a role for genetic factors. Limited data exist identifying specific genes associated with rotator cuff tearing. The purpose of this study was to identify specific genes or genetic variants associated with rotator cuff tearing by a genome-wide association study with an independent set of rotator cuff tear cases. A set of 311 full-thickness rotator cuff tear cases genotyped on the Illumina 5M single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) platform were used in a genome-wide association study with 2641 genetically matched white population controls available from the Illumina iControls database. Tests of association were performed with GEMMA software at 257,558 SNPs that compose the intersection of Illumina SNP platforms and that passed general quality control metrics. SNPs were considered significant if PÂ <Â 1.94Â ÃÂ 10(-7) (Bonferroni correction: 0.05/257,558). Tests of association revealed 2 significantly associated SNPs, one occurring in SAP30BP (rs820218; PÂ =Â 3.8E-9) on chromosome 17q25 and another occurring in SASH1 (rs12527089; PÂ =Â 1.9E-7) on chromosome 6q24. This study represents the first attempt to identify genetic factors influencing rotator cuff tearing by a genome-wide association study using a dense/complete set of SNPs. Two SNPs were significantly associated with rotator cuff tearing, residing in SAP30BP on chromosome 17 and SASH1 on chromosome 6. Both genes are associated with the cellular process of apoptosis. Identification of potential genes or genetic variants associated with rotator cuff tearing may help in identifying individuals at risk for the development of rotator cuff tearing.

Methods A previously developed -and validated- instrument addressing four work-related motivators (job attributes, remuneration, co-workers and achievements) was used. Three categories of health care professionals, doctors (N = 354), nurses (N = 581) and office workers (N = 418), working in public and private hospitals, participated and motivation was compared across socio-demographic and occupational variables. Results The range of reported motivational factors was mixed and Maslow's conclusions that lower level motivational factors must be met before ascending to the next level were not confirmed. The highest ranked motivator for the entire sample, and by professional subgroup, was achievements (P < 0.001). Within subgroups, motivators were similar, and only one significant difference was observed, namely between doctors and nurses in respect to co-workers (P < 0.05). Remuneration (and salary in particular) was reported as a significant incentive only for professionals in managerial positions. Health professionals in private hospitals were motivated by all factors significantly more than their public-hospital counterparts. Conclusion The results are in agreement with the literature which focuses attention to management approaches employing both monetary and non-monetary incentives to motivate health care workers. This study showed that intrinsic factors are particularly important and should become a target for effective employee motivation.

SELDI-TOF-MS was performed to screen protein peaks that were significantly highly expressed in tumor tissue compared with adjacent liver tissue. After removing proteins larger than 30kDa, the targeted peaks were separated by solid phase extraction and tricine-SDS-PAGE. Protein fragments produced by in-gel digestion were identified by LC-MS/MS. Immunohistochemical assays further confirmed these results. Overall survival curves were graphed by Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate analysis was performed by Cox proportional hazards regression model. Three protein peaks (m/z 12,138, m/z 13,462, and m/z 15,120) that were significantly upregulated in the tumor tissue were identified as macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 7 (CXCL7), and interleukin 25 (IL-25). These factors were closely related to clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, vascular invasion and serum AFP level. High expression of each inflammatory marker indicated poor prognosis. Multivariate analysis suggested that MIF, CXCL7, and IL-25 were prognostic factors independent of patient sex, age and tumor histological type. MIF, CXCL7, and IL-25 might be considered as effective inflammation factors for diagnosis and prognosis of hepatoblastoma and as potential novel treatment targets through inhibition of inflammatory function.

Both fixed-parameter and random-parameter ordered regression models were used to analyze records of all vehicle-train collisions that occurred in the United States from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2015. For fixed-parameter ordered models, both probit and negative log-log link functions were used. The latter function accounts for the fact that lower injury severity levels are more probable than higher ones. Separate models were developed for heavy and light-duty vehicles. Higher train and vehicle speeds, female, and young drivers (below the age of 21 years) were found to be consistently associated with higher severity of drivers' injuries for both heavy and light-duty vehicles. Furthermore, favorable weather, light-duty trucks (including pickup trucks, panel trucks, mini-vans, vans, and sports-utility vehicles), and senior drivers (above the age of 65 years) were found be consistently associated with higher severity of drivers' injuries for light-duty vehicles only. All other factors (e.g. air temperature, the type of warning devices, darkness conditions, and highway pavement type) were found to be temporally unstable, which may explain the conflicting findings of previous studies related to those factors.

A prospective, multicenter, cohort study was conducted in four Canadian EDs from November 2006 to November 2010. All consecutive patients aged 16 years or older with MTI were eligible at discharge from EDs. They underwent standardized clinical and radiologic evaluations at 1 and 2 weeks, followed by standardized telephone interviews at 30 and 90 days. A pain trajectory model characterized groups of patients with different pain evolutions and ascertained specific risk factors in each group through multivariate analysis. In this cohort of 1,132 patients, 734 were eligible for study inclusion. The authors identified a pain trajectory that characterized 18.2% of the study population experiencing clinically significant pain (>3 of 10) at 90 days after a MTI. Multivariate modeling found two or more rib fractures, smoking, and initial oxygen saturation below 95% to be predictors of this group of patients. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first prospective study of trajectory modeling to detect risk factors associated with significant pain at 90 days after MTI. These factors may help in planning specific treatment strategies and should be validated in another prospective cohort.

Identifying Factors Affecting Chat Interactions in Online Sports Viewing\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYeo, Jaeryong; Lee, Juyeong\n\n2016-01-01\n\nSports fans are able to watch games from many locations using TV services while interacting with other fans online. In this paper, we identify the factors that affect sports viewersâ online interactions. Using a large-scale dataset of more than 25 million chat messages from a popular social TV site for baseball, we extract various game-related factors, and investigate the relationships between these factors and fansâ interactions using a series of multiple regression analyses. As a result, we identify several factors that are significantly related to viewer interactions. In addition, we determine that the influence of these factors varies according to the user group; i.e., active vs. less active users, and loyal vs. non-loyal users.

This study aims to identify motivating factors for retaining rural health workers. Sixty rural health workers completed surveys and 46 were interviewed. They rated the importance of six motivating factors and discussed these and other factors in interviews. An interview was conducted with a Government Human Resources Manager (HR Manager) to elicit contextual information. All six factors were identified as being very important motivators, as were two additional factors. Additional career training was identified by many as the most important factor. Comparison of results and the HR Manager interview revealed that workers lacked knowledge about opportunities and that the HR manager was aware of barriers to career development. The Zambian government might better motivate and retain rural health workers by offering them any combination of identified factors, and by addressing the barriers to career development.\n\nIdentifying the necessary and sufficient number of risk factors for predicting academic failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nLucio, Robert; Hunt, Elizabeth; Bornovalova, Marina\n\n2012-03-01\n\nIdentifying the point at which individuals become at risk for academic failure (grade point average [GPA] < 2.0) involves an understanding of which and how many factors contribute to poor outcomes. School-related factors appear to be among the many factors that significantly impact academic success or failure. This study focused on 12 school-related factors. Using a thorough 5-step process, we identified which unique risk factors place one at risk for academic failure. Academic engagement, academic expectations, academic self-efficacy, homework completion, school relevance, school safety, teacher relationships (positive relationship), grade retention, school mobility, and school misbehaviors (negative relationship) were uniquely related to GPA even after controlling for all relevant covariates. Next, a receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine a cutoff point for determining how many risk factors predict academic failure (GPA < 2.0). Results yielded a cutoff point of 2 risk factors for predicting academic failure, which provides a way for early identification of individuals who are at risk. Further implications of these findings are discussed.

The WHO has predicted a \"globesity epidemic\" with more than 1 billion adults being overweight and at least 300 million of these being clinically obese. Obesity among children and adolescents is of great significance. From a global population perspective, this epidemic in weight gain and its sequelae are the largest public health problems identified to date and have very significant adverse implications for population health, and have by now almost reached the proportion of a pandemic. While genetic changes have been discussed as a cause of the epidemic, there has been too little time since its start to enable enough genetic adaptation to take place for this to provide a valid explanation. Traditionally positive energy balance and sedentary life style have been regarded as the primary causal factors; however, these factors have so far failed to provide explanations for the entire problem. For these reasons it seems warranted to investigate other possible co-factors contributing to the \"globesity epidemic\" and to find efficient strategies to counteract further increases in the size and nature of the epidemic. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a potential preventive co-factor, thermogenesis. Special attention has been paid to the influence of ambient temperature as a grossly neglected factor in the debate. As most people today live and work at ambient temperatures close to their body temperature (the thermal neutral point), we hypothesise that this is an important causal co-factor in the \"globesity\" epidemic. The hypothesis: The null hypothesis that adaptive thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue in adult humans is not significant for weight loss is rejected. We propose the hypothesis that homoeothermic living conditions close to the thermogenic neutral level is an important causal co-factor in the \"Globesity\" Epidemic\n\nMONKEY: Identifying conserved transcription-factor binding sitesin multiple alignments using a binding site-specific evolutionarymodel\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMoses, Alan M.; Chiang, Derek Y.; Pollard, Daniel A.\n\n2004-10-28\n\nWe introduce a method (MONKEY) to identify conserved transcription-factor binding sites in multispecies alignments. MONKEY employs probabilistic models of factor specificity and binding site evolution, on which basis we compute the likelihood that putative sites are conserved and assign statistical significance to each hit. Using genomes from the genus Saccharomyces, we illustrate how the significance of real sites increases with evolutionary distance and explore the relationship between conservation and function.\n\nAssessing vulnerability to drought: identifying underlying factors across Europe\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nUrquijo, Julia; Gonzalez TÃ¡nago, Itziar; Ballesteros, Mario; De Stefano, Lucia\n\n2015-04-01\n\nDrought is considered one of the most severe and damaging natural hazards in terms of people and sectors affected and associated losses. Drought is a normal and recurrent climatic phenomenon that occurs worldwide, although its spatial and temporal characteristics vary significantly among climates. In the case of Europe, in the last thirty years, the region has suffered several drought events that have caused estimated economic damages over a â¬100 billion and have affected almost 20% of its territory and population. In recent years, there has been a growing awareness among experts and authorities of the need to shift from a reactive crisis approach to a drought risk management approach, as well as of the importance of designing and implementing policies, strategies and plans at country and river basin levels to deal with drought. The identification of whom and what is vulnerable to drought is a central aspect of drought risk mitigation and planning and several authors agree that societal vulnerability often determines drought risk more than the actual precipitation shortfalls. The final aim of a drought vulnerability assessment is to identify the underlying sources of drought impact, in order to develop policy options that help to enhance coping capacity and therefore to prevent drought impact. This study identifies and maps factors underlying vulnerability to drought across Europe. The identification of factors influencing vulnerability starts from the analysis of past drought impacts in four European socioeconomic sectors. This analysis, along with an extensive literature review, led to the selection of vulnerability factors that are both relevant and adequate for the European context. Adopting the IPCC model, vulnerability factors were grouped to describe exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. The aggregation of these components has resulted in the mapping of vulnerability to drought across Europe at NUTS02 level. Final results have been compared with\n\nGenomic Characterization of Vulvar (Pre)cancers Identifies Distinct Molecular Subtypes with Prognostic Significance.\n\nPubMed\n\nNooij, Linda S; Ter Haar, Natalja T; Ruano, Dina; Rakislova, Natalia; van Wezel, Tom; Smit, Vincent T H B M; Trimbos, Baptist J B M Z; Ordi, Jaume; van Poelgeest, Mariette I E; Bosse, Tjalling\n\n2017-11-15\n\nPurpose: Vulvar cancer (VC) can be subclassified by human papillomavirus (HPV) status. HPV-negative VCs frequently harbor TP53 mutations; however, in-depth analysis of other potential molecular genetic alterations is lacking. We comprehensively assessed somatic mutations in a large series of vulvar (pre)cancers. Experimental Design: We performed targeted next-generation sequencing (17 genes), p53 immunohistochemistry and HPV testing on 36 VC and 82 precursors (sequencing cohort). Subsequently, the prognostic significance of the three subtypes identified in the sequencing cohort was assessed in a series of 236 VC patients (follow-up cohort). Results: Frequent recurrent mutations were identified in HPV-negative vulvar (pre)cancers in TP53 (42% and 68%), NOTCH1 (28% and 41%), and HRAS (20% and 31%). Mutation frequency in HPV-positive vulvar (pre)cancers was significantly lower ( P = 0.001). Furthermore, a substantial subset of the HPV-negative precursors (35/60, 58.3%) and VC (10/29, 34.5%) were TP53 wild-type (wt), suggesting a third, not-previously described, molecular subtype. Clinical outcomes in the three different subtypes (HPV + , HPV - /p53wt, HPV - /p53abn) were evaluated in a follow-up cohort consisting of 236 VC patients. Local recurrence rate was 5.3% for HPV + , 16.3% for HPV - /p53wt and 22.6% for HPV - /p53abn tumors ( P = 0.044). HPV positivity remained an independent prognostic factor for favorable outcome in the multivariable analysis ( P = 0.020). Conclusions: HPV - and HPV + vulvar (pre)cancers display striking differences in somatic mutation patterns. HPV - /p53wt VC appear to be a distinct clinicopathologic subgroup with frequent NOTCH1 mutations. HPV + VC have a significantly lower local recurrence rate, independent of clinicopathological variables, opening opportunities for reducing overtreatment in VC. Clin Cancer Res; 23(22); 6781-9.

This analysis was performed by reviewing significant incidents and close calls in human spaceflight identified by the NASA Johnson Space Center Safety and Mission Assurance Flight Safety Office. The review of incidents shows whether the identified human errors were due to the operational phase (flight crew and ground control) or if they initiated at the design phase (includes manufacturing and test). This classification was performed with the aid of the NASA Human Systems Integration domains. This in-depth analysis resulted in a tool that helps with the human factors classification of significant incidents and close calls in human spaceflight, which can be used to identify human errors at the operational level, and how they were or should be minimized. Current governing documents on human systems integration for both government and commercial crew were reviewed to see if current requirements, processes, training, and standard operating procedures protect the crew and ground control against these issues occurring in the future. Based on the findings, recommendations to target those areas are provided.\n\nIdentifying cases of undiagnosed, clinically significant COPD in primary care: qualitative insight from patients in the target population\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLeidy, Nancy K; Kim, Katherine; Bacci, Elizabeth D; Yawn, Barbara P; Mannino, David M; Thomashow, Byron M; Barr, R Graham; Rennard, Stephen I; Houfek, Julia F; Han, Meilan K; Meldrum, Catherine A; Make, Barry J; Bowler, Russ P; Steenrod, Anna W; Murray, Lindsey T; Walsh, John W; Martinez, Fernando\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground: Many cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are diagnosed only after significant loss of lung function or during exacerbations. Aims: This study is part of a multi-method approach to develop a new screening instrument for identifying undiagnosed, clinically significant COPD in primary care. Methods: Subjects with varied histories of COPD diagnosis, risk factors and history of exacerbations were recruited through five US clinics (four pulmonary, one primary care). Phase I: Eight focus groups and six telephone interviews were conducted to elicit descriptions of risk factors for COPD, recent or historical acute respiratory events, and symptoms to inform the development of candidate items for the new questionnaire. Phase II: A new cohort of subjects participated in cognitive interviews to assess and modify candidate items. Two peak expiratory flow (PEF) devices (electronic, manual) were assessed for use in screening. Results: Of 77 subjects, 50 participated in Phase I and 27 in Phase II. Six themes informed item development: exposure (smoking, second-hand smoke); health history (family history of lung problems, recurrent chest infections); recent history of respiratory events (clinic visits, hospitalisations); symptoms (respiratory, non-respiratory); impact (activity limitations); and attribution (age, obesity). PEF devices were rated easy to use; electronic values were significantly higher than manual (P<0.0001). Revisions were made to the draft items on the basis of cognitive interviews. Conclusions: Forty-eight candidate items are ready for quantitative testing to select the best, smallest set of questions that, together with PEF, can efficiently identify patients in need of diagnostic evaluation for clinically significant COPD.

Existing approaches for risk factor identification are either knowledge driven (from guidelines or literatures) or data driven (from observational data). No existing method provides a model to effectively combine expert knowledge with data driven insight for risk factor identification. Methods: We present a systematic approach to enhance known knowledge-based risk factors with additional potential risk factors derived from data. The core of our approach is a sparse regression model with regularization terms that correspond to both knowledge and data driven risk factors. Results: The approach is validated using a large dataset containing 4,644 heart failure cases and 45,981 controls. The outpatient electronic health records (EHRs) for these patients include diagnosis, medication, lab results from 2003â2010. We demonstrate that the proposed method can identify complementary risk factors that are not in the existing known factors and can better predict the onset of HF. We quantitatively compare different sets of risk factors in the context of predicting onset of HF using the performance metric, the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). The combined risk factors between knowledge and data significantly outperform knowledge-based risk factors alone. Furthermore, those additional risk factors are confirmed to be clinically meaningful by a cardiologist. Conclusion: We present a systematic framework for combining knowledge and data driven insights for risk factor identification. We demonstrate the power of this framework in the context of predicting onset of HF, where our approach can successfully identify intuitive and predictive risk factors beyond a set of known HF risk factors.

Efforts to reduce hazardous drinking among military personnel have been limited in effectiveness. There is a need for a deeper understanding of how community-based prevention models apply to hazardous drinking in the military. Community-wide prevention efforts may be most effective in targeting community functioning (e.g., support from formal agencies, community cohesion) that impacts hazardous drinking via other proximal risk factors. The goal of the current study is to inform community-wide prevention efforts by testing a model of community functioning and mediating risk factors of hazardous drinking among active duty U.S. Air Force personnel. A large, representative survey sample of U.S. Air Force active duty members (N = 52,780) was collected at 82 bases worldwide. Hazardous drinking was assessed with the widely used Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (Saunders, Aasland, Babor, de la Fuente, & Grant, 1993). A variety of individual, family, and community measures were also assessed. Structural equation modeling was used to test a hypothesized model of community functioning, mediating risk factors and hazardous drinking. Depressive symptoms, perceived financial stress, and satisfaction with the U.S. Air Force were identified as significant mediators of the link between community functioning and hazardous drinking for men and women. Relationship satisfaction was also identified as a mediator for men. These results provide a framework for further community prevention research and suggest that prevention efforts geared at increasing aspects of community functioning (e.g., the U.S. Air Force Community Capacity model) may indirectly lead to reductions in hazardous drinking through other proximal risk factors.\n\nRandom T-DNA mutagenesis identifies a Cu-Zn-superoxide dismutase gene as a virulence factor of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nAgrobacterium-mediated transformation (AMT) was used to identify potential virulence factors in Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.

Our results showed that HDGF expression is up-regulated in Ewing's sarcoma. Nuclear HDGF expression is significantly associated with tumour volume (p < 0.001), metastases at diagnosis (p < 0.001), low overall survival rate (p < 0.001) and low disease-free survival rate (p < 0.001). HDGF knock-down results in significant reduction of Ewing's sarcoma cell growth, proliferation and enhances tumourigenesis, both in vitro and in vivo. Meanwhile, HDGF knock-down causes cell cycle arrest and enhanced sensitization to serum starvation-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, recombinant HDGF promotes proliferation and colony formation of Ewing's sarcoma cells. Ninety-eight candidate HDGF downstream genes were identified in Ewing's sarcoma cells using cDNA microarray analysis. In addition, we found that HDGF knock-down inhibited FLI1 expression in Ewing's sarcoma cells at the mRNA and protein levels. Our findings suggest that HDGF exhibits oncogenic properties and may be a novel prognostic factor in Ewing's sarcoma. Targeting HDGF might be a potential therapeutic strategy for Ewing's sarcoma.

Accounting for smoking behavior may help identify BP loci and extend our knowledge of its genetic architecture. We performed genome-wide association meta-analyses of systolic and diastolic BP incorporating gene-smoking interactions in 610,091 individuals. Stage 1 analysis examined â¼18.8 million SNPs and small insertion/deletion variants in 129,913 individuals from four ancestries (European, African, Asian, and Hispanic) with follow-up analysis of promising variants in 480,178 additional individuals from five ancestries. We identified 15 loci that were genome-wide significant (p < 5Â Ã 10 -8 ) in stage 1 and formally replicated in stage 2. A combined stage 1 and 2 meta-analysis identified 66 additional genome-wide significant loci (13, 35, and 18 loci in European, African, and trans-ancestry, respectively). A total of 56 known BP loci were also identified by our results (p < 5Â Ã 10 -8 ). Of the newly identified loci, ten showed significant interaction with smoking status, but none of them were replicated in stage 2. Several loci were identified in African ancestry, highlighting the importance of genetic studies in diverse populations. The identified loci show strong evidence for regulatory features and support shared pathophysiology with cardiometabolic and addiction traits. They also highlight a role in BP regulation for biological candidates such as modulators of vascular structure and function (CDKN1B, BCAR1-CFDP1, PXDN, EEA1), ciliopathies (SDCCAG8, RPGRIP1L), telomere maintenance (TNKS, PINX1, AKTIP), and central dopaminergic signaling (MSRA, EBF2).

The complex adaptation mechanisms to stress remain to be elucidated. In this study, we developed Stress Transcription Factor Identification Algorithm (STFIA), which integrates gene expression and TF-gene association data to identify the stress transcription factors (TFs) of six kinds of stresses. We identified some general stress TFs that are in response to various stresses, and some specific stress TFs that are in response to one specific stress. The biological significance of our findings is validated by the literature. We found that a small number of TFs may be sufficient to control a wide variety of expression patterns in yeast under different stresses. Two implications can be inferred from this observation. First, the adaptation mechanisms to different stresses may have a bow-tie structure. Second, there may exist extensive regulatory cross-talk among different stress responses. In conclusion, this study proposes a network of the regulators of stress responses and their mechanism of action.

Focusing on endophenotypes, rather than illness risk, is one solution to this problem. Impaired cognition is a well-established endophenotype of psychosis. Here we aimed to characterize the genetic architecture of cognition using phenotypically detailed models as opposed to relying on general IQ or individual neuropsychological measures. In so doing we hoped to identify genes that mediate cognitive ability, which might also contribute to psychosis risk. Hierarchical factor models of genetically clustered cognitive traits were subjected to linkage analysis followed by QTL region-specific association analyses in a sample of 1,269 Mexican American individuals from extended pedigrees. We identified four genome wide significant QTLs, two for working and two for spatial memory, and a number of plausible and interesting candidate genes. The creation of detailed models of cognition seemingly enhanced the power to detect genetic effects on cognition and provided a number of possible candidate genes for psychosis.

Clinical, biochemical and genetic data were obtained from 146 patients with AA amyloidosis. Control groups comprised 40 patients with long-standing inflammatory diseases without AA amyloidosis and 56 controls without any inflammatory disease. Patients with AA amyloidosis had either familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) or long-standing rheumatic diseases as underlying inflammatory disease (nâ=â111, median age 46Â years). However, in a significant proportion of patients with AA amyloidosis no primary disease was identified (idiopathic AA; nâ=â37, median age 60Â years). Patients with idiopathic AA amyloidosis were more obese and older than patients with AA amyloidosis secondary to FMF or rheumatic diseases. Serum leptin levels correlated with the body mass index (BMI) in all types of AA amyloidosis. Elevated leptin levels of more than 30âÂµg/l were detected in 18% of FMF/rheumaticâ+âAA amyloidosis and in 40% of patients with idiopathic AA amyloidosis (pâ=â.018). Finally, the SAA1 polymorphism was confirmed as a susceptibility factor for AA amyloidosis irrespective of the type of the disease. Obesity, age and the SAA1 polymorphism are susceptibility factors for idiopathic AA amyloidosis. Recent advances in treatment of FMF and rheumatic disorders will decrease the incidence of AA amyloidosis due to these diseases. Idiopathic AA, however, might be an emerging problem in the ageing and increasingly obese population.\n\nActive Learning with Rationales for Identifying Operationally Significant Anomalies in Aviation\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSharma, Manali; Das, Kamalika; Bilgic, Mustafa; Matthews, Bryan; Nielsen, David Lynn; Oza, Nikunj C.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nA major focus of the commercial aviation community is discovery of unknown safety events in flight operations data. Data-driven unsupervised anomaly detection methods are better at capturing unknown safety events compared to rule-based methods which only look for known violations. However, not all statistical anomalies that are discovered by these unsupervised anomaly detection methods are operationally significant (e.g., represent a safety concern). Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) have to spend significant time reviewing these statistical anomalies individually to identify a few operationally significant ones. In this paper we propose an active learning algorithm that incorporates SME feedback in the form of rationales to build a classifier that can distinguish between uninteresting and operationally significant anomalies. Experimental evaluation on real aviation data shows that our approach improves detection of operationally significant events by as much as 75% compared to the state-of-the-art. The learnt classifier also generalizes well to additional validation data sets.\n\nUse of clinical risk factors to identify postmenopausal women with vertebral fractures.\n\nPubMed\n\nTobias, J H; Hutchinson, A P; Hunt, L P; McCloskey, E V; Stone, M D; Martin, J C; Thompson, P W; Palferman, T G; Bhalla, A K\n\n2007-01-01\n\nPrevious studies have been unable to identify risk factors for prevalent vertebral fractures (VF), which are suitable for use in selection strategies intended to target high-risk sub-groups for diagnostic assessment. However, these studies generally consisted of large epidemiology surveys based on questionnaires and were only able to evaluate a limited number of risk factors. Here, we investigated whether a stronger relationship exists with prevalent VF when conventional risk factors are combined with additional information obtained from detailed one-to-one assessment. Women aged 65-75 registered at four geographically distinct GP practices were invited to participate (n=1,518), of whom 540 attended for assessment as follows: a questionnaire asking about risk factors for osteoporosis such as height loss compared to age 25 and history of non-vertebral fracture (NVF), the get-up-and-go test, Margolis back pain score, measurement of wall-tragus and rib-pelvis distances, and BMD as measured by the distal forearm BMD. A lateral thoraco-lumbar spine X-ray was obtained, which was subsequently scored for the presence of significant vertebral deformities. Of the 509 subjects who underwent spinal radiographs, 37 (7.3%) were found to have one or more VF. Following logistic regression analysis, the four most predictive clinical risk factors for prevalent VF were: height loss (P=0.006), past NVF (P=0.004), history of back pain (P=0.075) and age (P=0.05). BMD was also significantly associated with prevalent VF (P=0.002), but its inclusion did not affect associations with other variables. Factors elicited from detailed one-to-one assessment were not related to the risk of one or more prevalent VFs. The area under ROC curves derived from these regressions, which suggested that models for prevalent VF had modest predictive accuracy, were as follows: 0.68 (BMD), 0.74 (four clinical risk factors above) and 0.78 (clinical risk factors + BMD). Analyses were repeated in relation to the\n\nUse of electronic data and existing screening tools to identify clinically significant obstructive sleep apnea.\n\nPubMed\n\nSeverson, Carl A; Pendharkar, Sachin R; Ronksley, Paul E; Tsai, Willis H\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTo assess the ability of electronic health data and existing screening tools to identify clinically significant obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), as defined by symptomatic or severe OSA. The present retrospective cohort study of 1041 patients referred for sleep diagnostic testing was undertaken at a tertiary sleep centre in Calgary, Alberta. A diagnosis of clinically significant OSA or an alternative sleep diagnosis was assigned to each patient through blinded independent chart review by two sleep physicians. Predictive variables were identified from online questionnaire data, and diagnostic algorithms were developed. The performance of electronically derived algorithms for identifying patients with clinically significant OSA was determined. Diagnostic performance of these algorithms was compared with versions of the STOP-Bang questionnaire and adjusted neck circumference score (ANC) derived from electronic data. Electronic questionnaire data were highly sensitive (>95%) at identifying clinically significant OSA, but not specific. Sleep diagnostic testing-determined respiratory disturbance index was very specific (specificity â¥95%) for clinically relevant disease, but not sensitive (<35%). Derived algorithms had similar accuracy to the STOP-Bang or ANC, but required fewer questions and calculations. These data suggest that a two-step process using a small number of clinical variables (maximizing sensitivity) and objective diagnostic testing (maximizing specificity) is required to identify clinically significant OSA. When used in an online setting, simple algorithms can identify clinically relevant OSA with similar performance to existing decision rules such as the STOP-Bang or ANC.\n\nIdentifying influential factors of business process performance using dependency analysis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWetzstein, Branimir; Leitner, Philipp; Rosenberg, Florian; Dustdar, Schahram; Leymann, Frank\n\n2011-02-01\n\nWe present a comprehensive framework for identifying influential factors of business process performance. In particular, our approach combines monitoring of process events and Quality of Service (QoS) measurements with dependency analysis to effectively identify influential factors. The framework uses data mining techniques to construct tree structures to represent dependencies of a key performance indicator (KPI) on process and QoS metrics. These dependency trees allow business analysts to determine how process KPIs depend on lower-level process metrics and QoS characteristics of the IT infrastructure. The structure of the dependencies enables a drill-down analysis of single factors of influence to gain a deeper knowledge why certain KPI targets are not met.\n\nGenome-wide RNAi screening identifies host restriction factors critical for in vivo AAV transduction\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMano, Miguel; Ippodrino, Rudy; Zentilin, Lorena; Zacchigna, Serena; Giacca, Mauro\n\n2015-01-01\n\nViral vectors based on the adeno-associated virus (AAV) hold great promise for in vivo gene transfer; several unknowns, however, still limit the vectorsâ broader and more efficient application. Here, we report the results of a high-throughput, whole-genome siRNA screening aimed at identifying cellular factors regulating AAV transduction. We identified 1,483 genes affecting vector efficiency more than 4-fold and up to 50-fold, either negatively or positively. Most of these factors have not previously been associated to AAV infection. The most effective siRNAs were independent from the virus serotype or analyzed cell type and were equally evident for single-stranded and self-complementary AAV vectors. A common characteristic of the most effective siRNAs was the induction of cellular DNA damage and activation of a cell cycle checkpoint. This information can be exploited for the development of more efficient AAV-based gene delivery procedures. Administration of the most effective siRNAs identified by the screening to the liver significantly improved in vivo AAV transduction efficiency.

The sample was drawn from four male prisons located in Northern, Central, Southern, and Eastern Taiwan; a total of 1,181 valid surveys were collected. The results generally support the major findings of the extant Western studies. Crowding, however, was not significantly associated with the risk of victimization in any of the statistical models, which might be related to the different experiences and living conditions in the free community between Taiwanese and American inmates. This study generated clear policy implications, which may reduce prison victimization and engender a greater sense of well-being in the prison environment.\n\nIdentifying Causal Risk Factors for Violence among Discharged Patients\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCoid, Jeremy W.; Kallis, Constantinos; Doyle, Mike; Shaw, Jenny; Ullrich, Simone\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground Structured Professional Judgement (SPJ) is routinely administered in mental health and criminal justice settings but cannot identify violence risk above moderate accuracy. There is no current evidence that violence can be prevented using SPJ. This may be explained by routine application of predictive instead of causal statistical models when standardising SPJ instruments. Methods We carried out a prospective cohort study of 409 male and female patients discharged from medium secure services in England and Wales to the community. Measures were taken at baseline (pre-discharge), 6 and 12 months post-discharge using the Historical, Clinical and Risk-20 items version 3 (HCR-20v3) and Structural Assessment of Protective Factors (SAPROF). Information on violence was obtained via the McArthur community violence instrument and the Police National Computer. Results In a lagged model, HCR-20v3 and SAPROF items were poor predictors of violence. Eight items of the HCR-20v3 and 4 SAPROF items did not predict violent behaviour better than chance. In re-analyses considering temporal proximity of risk/ protective factors (exposure) on violence (outcome), risk was elevated due to violent ideation (OR 6.98, 95% CI 13.85â12.65, P<0.001), instability (OR 5.41, 95% CI 3.44â8.50, P<0.001), and poor coping/ stress (OR 8.35, 95% CI 4.21â16.57, P<0.001). All 3 risk factors were explanatory variables which drove the association with violent outcome. Self-control (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.08â0.24, P<0.001) conveyed protective effects and explained the association of other protective factors with violence. Conclusions Using two standardised SPJ instruments, predictive (lagged) methods could not identify risk and protective factors which must be targeted in interventions for discharged patients with severe mental illness. Predictive methods should be abandoned if the aim is to progress from risk assessment to effective risk management and replaced by methods which identify factors\n\nPerceptions of Preparedness of NIU Students for On-Campus Interviewing and the Factors Identified as Significant in Their Preparation.

A.; Layne, C. S.; Bloomberg, J. J.; Zhang, J. J.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nNeuroscientists are often interested in grouping variables to facilitate understanding of a particular phenomenon. Factor analysis is a powerful statistical technique that groups variables into conceptually meaningful clusters, but remains underutilized by neuroscience researchers presumably due to its complicated concepts and procedures. This paper illustrates an application of factor analysis to identify coordinated patterns of whole-body muscle activation during treadmill walking. Ten male subjects walked on a treadmill (6.4 km/h) for 20 s during which surface electromyographic (EMG) activity was obtained from the left side sternocleidomastoid, neck extensors, erector spinae, and right side biceps femoris, rectus femoris, tibialis anterior, and medial gastrocnemius. Factor analysis revealed 65% of the variance of seven muscles sampled aligned with two orthogonal factors, labeled 'transition control' and 'loading'. These two factors describe coordinated patterns of muscular activity across body segments that would not be evident by evaluating individual muscle patterns. The results show that factor analysis can be effectively used to explore relationships among muscle patterns across all body segments to increase understanding of the complex coordination necessary for smooth and efficient locomotion. We encourage neuroscientists to consider using factor analysis to identify coordinated patterns of neuromuscular activation that would be obscured using more traditional EMG analyses.\n\nPrognostic significance of ligands belonging to tumour necrosis factor superfamily in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.\n\nPubMed\n\nBolkun, L; Lemancewicz, D; Jablonska, E; Szumowska, A; Bolkun-Skornicka, U; Moniuszko, M; Dzieciol, J; Kloczko, J\n\n2015-03-01\n\nAltered activities of ligands belonging to tumour necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily, namely B-cell activating factor (BAFF), a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) and apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) were demonstrated in several haematological diseases including acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). BAFF, APRIL and TRAIL provide crucial survival signals to immature, naive and activated B cells. These ligands are capable of activating a broad spectrum of intracellular signalling cascades that can either induce apoptosis or protect from programmed cell death. BAFF and APRIL, which can directly activate the NF-ÎºB pathway, have been identified as crucial survival factors for ALL cells. Here, we have analyzed serum BAFF, APRIL and TRAIL concentrations in 48 patients with newly diagnosed ALL and 44 healthy volunteers. The levels of APRIL and BAFF were significantly higher in ALL patients as compared to healthy volunteers. In contrast, concentrations of TRAIL were significantly lower in ALL patients. Moreover, following induction, the levels of APRIL, but not BAFF or TRAIL, were significantly lower in a group of patients with complete remission (CR) as compared to non-respondent (NR) ALL patients. Furthermore, we demonstrated statistically significant differences in concentrations of APRIL between CR MRD-negative and CR, MRD-positive ALL patients. Notably detection of higher concentrations of APRIL was associated with shorter leukaemia-free survival and overall survival. Altogether, our data indicate that APRIL can play an important role in the pathogenesis of ALL and the measurement of APRIL levels can improve prognostication in ALL patients.

A traffic conflict technique was applied to 12 two-lane rural roads in order to investigate the potential situations for accidents to occur and thus to identify the geometric and traffic factors affecting traffic conflicts. Traffic data were collected via the inductive loop detectors installed on these roads, and geometric characteristics were obtained through field observations. Two groups of data were then analyzed independently by Pearson's chi-square test to evaluate their relationship to traffic conflicts. The independent variables were percentage of time spent following (PTSF), percentage of heavy vehicles, directional distribution of traffic (DDT), mean speed, speed standard deviation, section type, road width, longitudinal slope, holiday or workday, and lighting condition. It was indicated that increasing the PTSF, decreasing the percentage of heavy vehicles, increasing the mean speed (up to 75 km/h), increasing DDT in the range of 0 to 60 percent, and decreasing the standard deviation of speed significantly increased the occurrence of traffic conflicts. It was also revealed that traffic conflicts occur more frequently on curve sections and on workdays. The variables road width, slope, and lighting condition were found to have a minor effect on conflict occurrence. To reduce the number of head-on conflicts on the aforementioned roads, some remedial measures are suggested, such as not constructing long \"No Passing\" zones and constructing passing lanes where necessary; keeping road width at the standard value; constructing roads with horizontal curves and a high radius and using appropriate road markings and overtaking-forbidden signs where it is impossible to modify the radius; providing enough light and installing caution signs/devices on the roads; and intensifying police control and supervision on workdays\n\nPsychosocial factors and tooth wear with a significant component of attrition.\n\nPubMed\n\nda Silva, A M; Oakley, D A; Hemmings, K W; Newman, H N; Watkins, S\n\n1997-06-01\n\nPathological tooth wear is often associated with bruxism, which appears in turn to be influenced by psychosocial factors. This study investigated putative relationships between psychosocial factors (total and average perceived stress, state and trait anxiety) and tooth wear, comparing 45 patients exhibiting tooth wear with a significant component of attrition to 45 controls. Groups were matched for gender and age. Subjects completed the Modified and Perceived Stress Scale and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. A between-groups multivariate analysis of variance indicated that the two groups did not differ significantly on the combined psychosocial factors, F(4,85) = 1.16, P > 0.05. However, a univariate F-test showed that tooth-wear patients presented significantly more trait anxiety than controls, F(1,88) = 4.15, P < 0.05. Further research is indicated to clarify the importance of trait anxiety and other psychosocial factors in the progression of tooth wear with a significant component of attrition.\n\nThe accuracy of physical examination in identifying significant pathologies in penetrating thoracic trauma.\n\nPubMed\n\nKong, V Y; Sartorius, B; Clarke, D L\n\n2015-12-01\n\nAccurate physical examination (PE) remains a key component in the assessment of penetrating thoracic trauma (PTT), despite the increasing availability of advanced radiological imaging. Evidence regarding the accuracy of PE in identifying significant pathology following PTT is limited. A retrospective review of 405 patients was undertaken over a twelve-month period to determine the accuracy of PE in identifying significant pathology (SP) subsequently confirmed on chest radiographs (CXRs) in patients who sustained stab injuries to the thorax. Ninety-seven per cent (372/405) of patients were males, and the mean age was 24 years. The weapons involved were knives in 98 % (398/405), screwdrivers in 1 % (3/405) and unknown in the remaining 1 %. Fifty-nine per cent (238/405) of all injuries were on the left side. There were 306 (76 %) SPs identified on CXR. Ninety-nine (24 %) CXRs were entirely normal. Based on PE alone, 223 (55 %) patients were thought to have SPs present, 182 (45 %) patients were thought to have no SPs. The overall sensitivity of PE in identifying SPs was 68 % (63-73, 95 % CI), with a specificity of 86 % (77-92, 95 % CI). The PPV of PE was 94 % (90-97, 95 % CI) and the NPV was 47 % (39-54, 95 % CI). The sensitivity of PE for identifying a pneumothorax was 59 % (51-66, 95 % CI), with a specificity of 96 % (89-99, 95 % CI) and the sensitivity of PE for identifying a haemothorax was 79 % (72-86, 95 % CI), with a specificity of 96 % (89-99, 95 % CI). PE is inaccurate in identifying SPs in PTT. The increased reliance on advanced radiological imaging and the subsequent reduced emphasis on PE may have contributed to rapid deskilling amongst surgical residents. The importance of PE must be repeatedly re-emphasised.\n\nIdentifying significant environmental features using feature recognition.\n\nDOT National Transportation Integrated Search\n\n2015-10-01\n\nThe Department of Environmental Analysis at the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet has expressed an interest in feature-recognition capability because it may help analysts identify environmentally sensitive features in the landscape, : including those r...\n\nRisk factors for persistent fatigue with significant school absence in children and adolescents.\n\nPubMed\n\nBakker, Robert J; van de Putte, Elise M; Kuis, Wietse; Sinnema, Gerben\n\n2009-07-01\n\nTo assess children and adolescents with severe fatigue who are referred to pediatricians and to examine whether factors can be identified at their first visit that predict worse outcomes at 1 year. Ninety-one patients, aged 8 to 18 years completed questionnaires about sleep, somatic symptoms, physical activity, and fatigue. They were reassessed 12 months later. Measurements at baseline and outcome were analyzed by using univariable logistic regression with persistent, severe fatigue (yes/no) and persistent school absence (yes/no) as dependent variables and baseline scores as independent variables. After 12 months, 50.6% of the children and adolescents showed improvement; 29.1% had persistent fatigue, and 20.3% had persistent fatigue with significant school absence. Factors associated with the poorest outcome were sleep problems (odds ratio [OR]: 1.4 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-1.8]), initial fatigue score (OR: 1.1 [95% CI: 1.0-1.2]), somatic complaints such as hot and cold spells (OR: 1.9 [95% CI: 1.2-3.0]), blurred vision (OR: 2.1 [95% CI: 1.1-4.0]), pain in arms and legs (OR: 2.0 [95% CI: 1.0-3.2]), back pain (OR: 1.8 [95% CI: 1.0-3.2]), constipation (OR: 1.7 [95% CI: 1.0-2.7]), and memory deficits (OR: 1.8 [95% CI: 1.0-3.2]). Resolved fatigue was associated with male gender (OR: 5.0 [95% CI: 1.6-15.5]) and a physically active lifestyle (OR: 1.3 [95% CI: 1.1-1.5]). Assessment of predictive factors at the first visit enables the pediatrician to identify those patients with severe fatigue who are at risk of a poor outcome. Female gender, poor sleep quality, physically inactive lifestyle, and specific somatic complaints were important predictive factors.\n\nMetabolic syndrome is a significant and independent risk factor for increased arterial stiffness in Japanese subjects.\n\nPubMed\n\nSatoh, Hiroki; Kishi, Reiko; Tsutsui, Hiroyuki\n\n2009-12-01\n\nMetabolic syndrome (MetS) has been recognized as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease; however, the impact of MetS on arterial stiffness has not been fully established in the general Japanese population. We analyzed the relationship between MetS and the severity of arterial stiffness using brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) in 2744 male and 358 female subjects aged 38-62 years, adjusted for conventional risk factors and C-reactive protein. The prevalence rates of MetS identified by Japanese criteria were 22.7% (n=624) and 7.8% (n=28) in male and female subjects, respectively. The subjects with MetS had significantly greater mean values of baPWV than those without MetS among both male and female subjects (1444+/-209 vs. 1294+/-165 cm/s in male subjects, P<0.001; 1379+/-151 vs. 1220+/-171 cm/s in female subjects, P<0.001). After adjustment for atherosclerotic variables such as age, smoking habits, total cholesterol and C-reactive protein, the odds ratio (OR) of MetS for increased baPWV was 3.65 in male subjects (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.99-4.47, P<0.001) and 8.02 in female subjects (95% CI: 3.18-20.25 P<0.001). In conclusion, MetS was identified as a significant and independent risk factor for increased arterial stiffness in both the male and female general population in Japan.\n\n42 CFR 137.22 - May the Secretary consider uncorrected significant and material audit exceptions identified...\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-10-01\n\n... and material audit exceptions identified regarding centralized financial and administrative functions...

From January 2012-November 2015, 3,251 patients underwent 3,354 cone-beam CT-guided PLBs for lung lesions. Cox, logistic and linear regression analyses were performed to identify time-dependent risk factors of PLB-related pneumothorax, risk factors of drainage catheter insertion and those of prolonged catheter placement, respectively. Pneumothorax occurred in 915/3,354 PLBs (27.3 %), with 230/915 (25.1 %) occurring during follow-ups. Risk factors for earlier occurrence of PLB-related pneumothorax include emphysema (HR=1.624), smaller target (HR=0.922), deeper location (HR=1.175) and longer puncture time (HR=1.036), while haemoptysis (HR=0.503) showed a protective effect against earlier development of pneumothorax. Seventy-five cases (8.2 %) underwent chest catheter placement. Mean duration of catheter placement was 3.2Â±2.0 days. Emphysema (odds ratio [OR]=2.400) and longer puncture time (OR=1.053) were assessed as significant risk factors for catheter insertion, and older age (parameter estimate=1.014) was a predictive factor for prolonged catheter placement. PLB-related pneumothorax occurred in 27.3 %, of which 25.1 % developed during follow-ups. Smaller target size, emphysema, deeply-located lesions were significant risk factors of PLB-related pneumothorax. Emphysema and older age were related to drainage catheter insertion and prolonged catheter placement, respectively. â¢ One-fourth of percutaneous lung biopsy (PLB)-related pneumothorax occurs during follow-up. â¢ Smaller, deeply-located target and emphysema lead to early occurrence of pneumothorax. â¢ Emphysema is related to drainage catheter insertion for PLB-related pneumothorax. â¢ Older age may lead to prolonged catheter placement for PLB-related pneumothorax. â¢ Tailored management can be possible with time-dependent information of PLB-related pneumothorax.\n\nIdentifying medical students at risk of underperformance from significant stressors.\n\nPubMed\n\nWilkinson, Tim J; McKenzie, Jan M; Ali, Anthony N; Rudland, Joy; Carter, Frances A; Bell, Caroline J\n\n2016-02-02\n\nStress is associated with poorer academic performance but identifying vulnerable students is less clear. A series of earthquakes and disrupted learning environments created an opportunity to explore the relationships among stress, student factors, support and academic performance within a medical course. The outcomes were deviations from expected performances on end of year written and clinical examinations. The predictors were questionnaire-based measures of connectedness/support, impact of the earthquakes, safety, depression, anxiety, stress, resilience and personality. The response rate was 77%. Poorer than expected performance on all examinations was associated with greater disruptions to living arrangements and fewer years in the country; on the written examination with not having a place to study; and on the clinical examination with relationship status, not having the support of others, less extroversion, and feeling less safe. There was a suggestion of a beneficial association with some markers of stress. We show that academic performance is assisted by students having a secure physical and emotional base. The students who are most vulnerable are those with fewer social networks, and those who are recent immigrants.\n\nIdentifying at-risk profiles and protective factors for problem gambling: A longitudinal study across adolescence and early adulthood.\n\nPubMed\n\nAllami, Youssef; Vitaro, Frank; Brendgen, Mara; Carbonneau, RenÃ©; Tremblay, Richard E\n\n2018-05-01\n\nPast studies have identified various risk and protective factors for problem gambling (PG). However, no study has examined the interplay between these factors using a combination of person-centered and variable-centered approaches embedded within a longitudinal design. The present study aimed to (a) identify distinct profiles in early adolescence based on a set of risk factors commonly associated with PG (impulsivity, depression, anxiety, drug-alcohol use, aggressiveness, and antisociality), (b) explore the difference in reported gambling problems between these profiles during midadolescence and early adulthood, and (c) identify family- and peer-related variables that could operate as protective or compensatory factors in this context. Two samples were used: (a) a population sample (N = 1,033) living in low socioeconomic-status neighborhoods and (b) a population sample (N = 3,017) representative of students attending Quebec schools. Latent profile analyses were conducted to identify at-risk profiles based on individual risk factors measured at age 12 years. Negative binomial regression models were estimated to compare profiles in terms of their reported gambling problems at ages 16 and 23. Finally, family- and peer-related variables measured at age 14 were included to test their protective or compensatory role with respect to the link between at-risk profiles and gambling problems. Four profiles were identified: well-adjusted, internalizing, externalizing, and comorbid. Compared to the well-adjusted profile, the externalizing and comorbid profiles reported more gambling problems at ages 16 and 23, but the internalizing profile did not differ significantly. Various protective and compensatory factors emerged for each profile at both time points.

However, little is currently known regarding what genetic factors influence HGF levels, despite evidence of substantial genetic contributions to HGF variation. Based upon ethnicity-stratified single-variant association analysis and trans-ethnic meta-analysis of 6201 participants of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), we discovered five statistically significant common and low-frequency variants: HGF missense polymorphism rs5745687 (p.E299K) as well as four variants (rs16844364, rs4690098, rs114303452, rs3748034) within or in proximity to HGFAC. We also identified two significant ethnicity-specific gene-level associations (A1BG in African Americans; FASN in Chinese Americans) based upon low-frequency/rare variants, while meta-analysis of gene-level results identified a significant association for HGFAC. However, identified single-variant associations explained modest proportions of the total trait variation and were not significantly associated with coronary artery calcium or coronary heart disease. Our findings indicate genetic factors influencing circulating HGF levels may be complex and ethnically diverse.

Using a targeted resequencing approach we identified low-frequency and rare missense mutations within the LRRC32 gene encoding the protein GARP, a receptor on activated regulatory T cells that binds latent transforming growth factor-Î². Subsequent association testing in more than 2,000 atopic dermatitis patients and 2,000 control subjects showed a significant excess of these LRRC32 variants in individuals with atopic dermatitis. Structural protein modeling and bioinformatic analysis predicted a disruption of protein transport upon these variants, and overexpression assays in CD4 + CD25 - T cells showed a significant reduction in surface expression of the mutated protein. Consistently, flow cytometric (FACS) analyses of different T-cell subtypes obtained from atopic dermatitis patients showed a significantly reduced surface expression of GARP and a reduced conversion of CD4 + CD25 - T cells into regulatory T cells, alongÂ with lower expression of latency-associated protein upon stimulation in carriers of the LRRC32 A407T variant. These results link inherited disturbances of transforming growth factor-Î² signaling with atopic dermatitis risk. Copyright Â© 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Since then the disease has spread and is now endemic in large parts of the country. This study investigated the statistical relationship between a set of risk factors and the presence or absence of HPAI in Indonesia during 2006 and 2007. HPAI was evaluated through participatory disease surveillance (PDS) in backyard village chickens (the study population), and risk factors included descriptors of people and poultry distribution (separating chickens, ducks and production sectors), poultry movement patterns and agro-ecological conditions. The study showed that the risk factors \"elevation\", \"human population density\" and \"rice cropping\" were significant in accounting for the spatial variation of the PDS-defined HPAI cases. These findings were consistent with earlier studies in Thailand and Vietnam. In addition \"commercial poultry population\", and two indicators of market locations and transport; \"human settlements\" and \"road length\", were identified as significant risk factors in the models. In contrast to several previous studies carried out in Southeast Asia, domestic backyard ducks were not found to be a significant risk factor in Indonesia. The study used surrogate estimates of market locations and marketing chains and further work should focus on the actual location of the live bird markets, and on the flow of live poultry and poultry products between them, so that patterns of possible transmission, and regions of particular risk could be better inferred.

Few prior investigations have evaluated bone health in young runners, particularly males. To characterize sex-specific risk factors for low BMD in adolescent runners. Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Training characteristics, fracture history, eating behaviors and attitudes, and menstrual history were measured using online questionnaires. A food frequency questionnaire was used to identify dietary patterns and measure calcium intake. Runners (female: n = 94, male: n = 42) completed dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to measure lumbar spine (LS) and total body less head (TBLH) BMD and body composition values, including android-to-gynoid (A:G) fat mass ratio. The BMD was standardized to Z-scores using age, sex, and race/ethnicity reference values. Questionnaire values were combined with DXA values to determine risk factors associated with differences in BMD Z-scores in LS and TBLH and low bone mass (defined as BMD Z-score â¤-1). In multivariable analyses, risk factors for lower LS BMD Z-scores in girls included lower A:G ratio, being shorter, and the combination of (interaction between) current menstrual irregularity and a history of fracture (all P < .01). Later age of menarche, lower A:G ratio, lower lean mass, and drinking less milk were associated with lower TBLH BMD Z-scores (P < .01). In boys, lower body mass index (BMI) Z-scores and the belief that being thinner improves performance were associated with lower LS and TBLH BMD Z-scores (all P < .05); lower A:G ratio was additionally associated with lower TBLH Z-scores (P < .01). Thirteen girls (14%) and 9 boys (21%) had low bone mass. Girls with a BMI â¤17.5 kg/m(2) or both menstrual irregularity and a history of fracture were significantly more likely to have low bone mass.

Despite the high prevalence of H. pylori infection in Africa and South Asia, the incidence of gastric cancer in these areas is much lower than those in other countries. The incidence of gastric cancer tends to decrease from north to south in East Asia. Such geographic differences in the pathology can be explained, at least in part, by the presence of different types of H. pylori virulence factors in addition to the host and environmental factors. Virulence factors of H. pylori, such as cagA, vacA, dupA, iceA, oipA and babA, have been demonstrated to be predictors of severe clinical outcomes. Interestingly, meta-analysis showed that CagA seropositivity was associated with gastric cancer compared with gastritis even in East Asian countries where almost of the strains possessing cagA. Meta-analysis also confirmed the significance of vacA, dupA and iceA. However, there remains the possibility that additional important pathogenic genes can be existed because H. pylori consists of approximately 1 600 genes. Despite advances in our understanding of the development of H. pylori-related diseases, further work is required to clarify the roles of H. pylori virulence factors.

However, such a variable-centered approach does not account for the clustering of job attributes among groups of employees. We addressed this issue by using a person-centered approach to (a) investigate the occurrence of different empirical constellations of perceived job stressors and resources and (b) validate the meaningfulness of profiles by analyzing their association with employee well-being and performance. We applied factor mixture modeling to identify profiles in 4 large samples consisting of employees in Switzerland (Studies 1 and 2) and the United States (Studies 3 and 4). We identified 2 profiles that spanned the 4 samples, with 1 reflecting a combination of relatively low stressors and high resources (P1) and the other relatively high stressors and low resources (P3). The profiles differed mainly in terms of their organizational and social aspects. Employees in P1 reported significantly higher mean levels of job satisfaction, performance, and general health, and lower means in exhaustion compared with P3. Additional analyses showed differential relationships between job attributes and outcomes depending on profile membership. These findings may benefit organizational interventions as they show that perceived work stressors and resources more strongly influence satisfaction and well-being in particular profiles.

In this paper, we develop a new method to identify key drivers of return reversal by incorporating a comprehensive set of factors derived from different economic theories into one unified dynamical Bayesian factor graph. We then use the model to depict factor relationships and their dynamics, from which we make some interesting discoveries about the mechanism behind return reversals. Through extensive experiments on the US stock market, we conclude that among the various factors, the liquidity factors consistently emerge as key drivers of return reversal, which is in support of the theory of liquidity effect. Specifically, we find that stocks with high turnove"
