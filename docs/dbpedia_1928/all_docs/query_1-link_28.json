Reserved seating tickets are on sale now in the HS Office.\n\n​In 1926, radium was a miracle cure, Madame Curie an international celebrity, and luminous watches the latest rage—until the girls who painted them began to fall ill with a mysterious disease. Inspired by a true story, Radium Girlstraces the efforts of Grace Fryer, a dial painter, as she fights for her day in court. Her chief adversary is her former employer, Arthur Roeder, an idealistic man who cannot bring himself to believe that the same element that shrinks tumors could have anything to do with the terrifying rash of illnesses among his employees. As the case goes on, however, Grace finds herself battling not just with the U.S. Radium Corporation, but with her own family and friends, who fear that her campaign for justice will backfire. Written with warmth and humor, Radium Girls is a fast-moving, highly theatrical ensemble piece for 9 to 10 actors, who play more than 30 parts—friends, co-workers, lovers, relatives, attorneys, scientists, consumer advocates, and myriad interested bystanders. Called a \"powerful\" and \"engrossing\" drama by critics, Radium Girls offers a wry, unflinching look at the peculiarly American obsessions with health, wealth, and the commercialization of science.\n\n​\n\nTickets Prices:\n\n​Students - $5.00\n\n​Adults - $5.00\n\n​Tickets are on sale now, and are available in the high school office or by calling (515) 465-3503.\n\n​The Performing Arts Center is handicapped accessible.\n\nMamma Mia!\n\nP.H.S.

Larry has been featured in jazz groups with Bobby Lewis, Mary Louise Knutson, and with brother Bert Dalton in the Dalton Brothers Trio. He has appeared at the Winnipeg Folk Festival, the Woody Guthrie Festival, and other venues backing Larry Long, sharing the stage with Pete Seeger, Arlo Guthrie, Peter Ostrushko, Debbie Duncan and Prudence Johnson.Larry has also recorded with Ariane Lydon, Lynn Biddick, Brian Sirchio, Hans Mayer, and Clay Riness.\n\nTommy Pfaff-5 String Banjo\n\nTommy Pfaff has been stuck on the banjo since he began chording Tin Pan Alley tunes on his Grandma's little old banjo uke.From those early Dixieland roots, sprang the Bluegrass style of banjo that Tommy has played and taught for over 30 years.Along the way, he has shared the stage with musicians of every stripe:country, rock, folk, blues, dixie, jazz, and polka.Despite these many years of experience and experiences, Tommy nonetheless has failed to learn how to play the banjo in even a remotely musical way.He has concluded, therefore that people take such an instant dislike to his banjo “music” because, well, “it just saves time”.\n\nWayne Beezley-Mandolin\n\nWayne Beezley grew up in Paonia, Colorado, where he started listening to bluegrass and old time music when he was about 11 years old. The family had an old “tater bug” style mandolin hanging on the wall, so Wayne got it down and started plunking around on it. He played with the Colorado based bluegrass band Monroe Doctrine, through which passed such notables as Charles Sawtelle, Danny Weiss, Tony Trischka, and Mark Hembree. Wayne moved to the Winona, MN area and expanded his musical horizons with the country-rock band North Country Band, and stretched out even further with a jam band called WEDG. He is comfortable in bluegrass, folk, swing, jazz, rock, jam, and whatever you want to throw at him. (Except hip-hop). Wayne currently plays with String Ties and the Bus Boys.\n\nDan Sebranek- Guitar\n\nDan Sebranek started playing four string banjo at the age of ten. His brother Larry was taking banjo lessons and encouraged Dan to pick up the instrument. Dan did pick up the banjo and other instruments thereafter. After a couple of years he switched to the electric guitar. There was always music around the Sebranek household. Dan’s father (Virgil Sebranek) played guitar. Dan picked up his dad’s guitar and started to learn Rock and Roll. At the age of fifteen, Dan started playing in a high school rock and roll band called Phoenix. They played live music at various local venues until 1980. His high school band mates all went their own ways after graduation. It was then Dan became more serious about playing music as a lifetime profession. He eventually added the acoustic guitar to his repertoire and began traveling across the nation. Dan spent three years traveling the road with Bill Miller. Later he became an integral part of several bluegrass/newgrass bands. Many of Dan’s friends have enjoyed experiencing the music of the Runaway acoustic duo that includes Johnsmith. Dan and John have several compact disc recordings after over ten years of concert venues together. John invited Dan on a musical tour of Ireland that remains unforgettable. Dan has also shared the stage with Hans Mayer and more recently recorded with Hans on his newest children’s album that encourages the use of green clean energy. These days you might find Dan playing a little rock and roll with his high school friends for a reunion. You might see him in concert with Johnsmith or Hans Mayer. He spends time with his musical friends (Mark Waelti and Randy Marsh) in Florida where you might hear a bit of Fogelberg or the faint sounds of Jimmy Buffet. Most of all Dan keeps the music of his Wisconsin family roots close to his heart in the bluegrass band STRING TIES.\n\nPerry Fine Arts concerts are free, donations accepted, and open to all.\n\n​The Perry Performing Arts Center is handicapped accessible.\n\nProgram - Veterans Day 2019\n\nYour browser does not support viewing this document.

The trio's repertoire includes everything from well-known mariachi music to lesser known Native American tunes and contemporary Mexican folk music and popular compositions. Trio de Colores, or \"Colorful Trio,\" has as its mission to expand awareness about the true diversity of Mexican music. The January 21 concert program will be a colorful sampler of short pieces that reflect primarily the Iberian influence on the popular music of Mexico, as illustrated by Mexican folk tunes such as “La Petenera” from the state of Veracruz, and “El Sinaloense” and “La Charreada” from the state of Jalisco, which all carry a European brand of harmonies in thirds and the rich string accompaniments first introduced from Spain: the harp, the guitarrón, and the vihuela all trace their roots to Europe. And yet, this is not European music, nor are the string instruments of Trio de Colores from Spain. Each piece carries a sound unique to Mexico, and all of the string instruments used by Trio de Colores were invented in the Americas. Musical ideas brought from Spain were only the starting point. The syncretism of European and Native traditions that led to cultures all their own in Mexico is palpable throughout the program. Of particular note is the waltz “María Chuchita,” sung in the Native Pur’épecha language, and the cumbia “El Mariachi Loco,” played to an Afro-Latin dance beat: they remind us very explicitly that Latin America is a land of mixed cultures with a unique voice in every region, depending on the particular blend that has taken place there.\n\n​\n\nPerry Fine Arts concerts are free, donations accepted, and open to all.\n\nThe Perry Performing Arts Center is handicapped accessible.\n\nPerry Fine Arts Series - Doc McCaulley\n\nDecember 10, 2017 - 2:00 p.m.\n\nThe Perry Fine Arts Series will be presenting Doc McCaulley in concert on December 10, 2017 at 2:00 p.m. in the Perry Performing Arts Center,\n\n​\n\nMcCaulley, a retired school superintendent for the Perry Community Schools, is now involved in a Christian Music Ministry for churches throughout Iowa.

In the adventure of a lifetime, the travelers come face to face with a ticking crocodile, a fierce Indian tribe, a band of bungling pirates and, of course, the villainous Captain Hook.\n\nFeaturing the iconic songs, \"I'm Flying,\" \"I've Gotta Crow,\" \"I Won't Grow Up\" and \"Never Never Land,\" and a rousing book full of magic, warmth and adventure, Peter Pan is the perfect show for the child in all of us... who dreamed of soaring high and never growing up.\n\nMake plans now to join Peter and his sidekick Tinkerbell on their magical journey as the Perry High School Drama and Music Departments present Peter Pan in the Perry Performing Arts Center.\n\nThe Perry Performing Arts Center is handicapped accessible.\n\nPerry Fine Arts Series - Iowa Statesman\n\nFebruary 25, 2017 - 7:00 p.m.\n\n(Please note day and time change from our usual schedule)\n\nThe Perry Fine Arts Series will be presenting the Iowa Statesmen in concert on Saturday, February 25, 2017 at 7:00 p.m. in Perry Performing Arts Center.\n\nThe Iowa Statesmen, Iowa State’s popular men’s choir, was formed by its conductor, Dr. James Rodde, in 2000.
