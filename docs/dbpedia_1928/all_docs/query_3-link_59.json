        "text": "Sweden secured third place at the 2023 Women's World Cup with a 2-0 win over co-hosts Australia at Brisbane Stadium.\n\nGoals in either half from Fridolina Rolfo and Kosovare Asllani sealed a deserved win for the Blagult, who nullified Australia and were in almost complete control against a Matildas side whose physical and mental fatigue caught up with them.\n\nBoth sides surprisingly named unchanged lineups for a match that usually sees heavy rotation, but that seemed a poor decision from Australia coach Tony Gustavsson, whose team looked sluggish and off the pace from the get go, Sweden having their first chance through Stina Blackstenius after two minutes.\n\nSweden vs Australia result\n\nScore Goalscorers Sweden 2 Rolfo (29), Asllani (62) Australia 0 —\n\nHayley Raso had Australia's best chance when she forced Zecira Musovic into a smart stop at her near post, but a controversial VAR review then gave Sweden a penalty after Clare Hunt — who had an otherwise excellent game — was adjudged to have fouled Blackstenius.\n\nRolfo stepped up from the spot and buried the penalty, giving Sweden a deserved lead during a half in which Australia struggled to impose themselves.\n\nDespite the team clearly needing changes, Gustavsson waited until the hour mark to do so. Two minutes later, Sweden doubled their lead through a clinical counter attack that led to Asllani firing a brilliant strike past Mackenzie Arnold.\n\nSweden were able to see out the game comfortably and claim third at a World Cup for a fourth time as Australia unsuccessfully resorted to long balls and crosses in their attempts to find a route into the game.\n\nMORE: What time does the World Cup final start?\n\nStarting lineups:\n\nSweden starting lineup (4-2-3-1): 1. Musovic (GK) — 2. Andersson, 13. Ilestedt, 6. Eriksson, 14. Bjorn — 16. Angeldal, 23. Rubensson — 19. Kaneryd (Sembrant 89'), 9. Asllani (Hurtig 67'), 18. Rolfo — 11. Blackstenius (Blomqvist 67')\n\nAustralia starting lineup (4-4-2): 18. Arnold (GK) — 21. Carpenter (Nevin 74'), 15. Hunt, 4. Polkinghorne (Chidiac 74'), 7. Catley — 16. Raso (Vine 60'), 19. Gorry (van Egmond 60'), 23. Cooney-Cross, 9. Foord — 11. Fowler — 20. Kerr\n\nFatigue catches up with Australia at the World Cup\n\nIt has been an at-times exhilarating home World Cup for Australia, taking the country on a wild ride that included a record of up to 17 million people around the country watching their 3-1 semifinal defeat to England.\n\nTheir players produced a herculean effort to get there, and with Gustavsson choosing to use a small group of players for extended minutes, tiredness got the best of them in Brisbane.\n\nWatch in UK:\n\nThe signs had been there against the Lionesses but Gustavsson kept the same team once again – a plan that backfired as passes went astray, touches were heavier than normal and Australia were overrun by a Sweden side who appeared to carry an extra step in their stride.\n\nThe likes of Katrina Gorry and Ellie Carpenter probably shouldn't have started and really should have been removed at halftime, instead of on 60 minutes and 74 minutes respectively.\n\nSweden captain Asllani rolls back the years\n\nShe hasn't always been the standout player for Sweden at the World Cup but skipper Kosovare Asllani turned back the clock with a vintage performance at both ends of the pitch.\n\nDefensively she proved a constant source of problems for a tired Katrina Gorry, marking and hassling the midfielder to limit her effectiveness and, in turn, hinder Australia's game.\n\nFrom an attacking angle, Asllani was involved in everything: controlling the tempo, moving the Australians around and scoring brilliantly from long range after fine buildup play.\n\nHer time has been managed more than others at this tournament and she was used to full strength against a flagging Matildas team.\n\nAustralia can take pride in Women's World Cup results\n\nThis was a tough way to end what has been a successful tournament for Australia, who united a nation and created some of the greatest moments in football history in the country.\n\nTheir wins over Canada, Denmark and France saw scenes of wild jubilation Down Under in a country where football is not the dominant code, and will hopefully prompt politicians to support the game more at all levels.\n\nThere is some sense of what could have been: what if Sam Kerr was fully fit? What if Alanna Kennedy wasn't injured in the final two games? What if Gustavsson didn't have a crippling fear of early substitutions?\n\nThese are intriguing if panful questions, but the overwhelming feeling for Australia as a nation should be a great sense of pride as the Matildas have now become a household name.\n\nCould this be a springboard for football in Australia? Potentially, but action has to be taken.\n\nSweden vs Australia live updates, highlights from 2023 World Cup\n\nFULLTIME\n\nIt's all over in Brisbane and Sweden have won the third placed playoff with a professional 2-0 win over co-hosts Australia.\n\nApart from a brief spell in the first half, Sweden were in control for much of the match against a Matildas side who were clearly affected by fatigue from a physically and mentally draining tournament. They can still be incredibly proud of their efforts but it's something of an anticlimactic for Australia.\n\n90+5 minutes: Hurtig is booked for a foul and then for kicking the ball away.\n\n90th minute: Six minutes of added time to end this game.\n\n89th minute: Another change for Sweden, as Sembrant replaces Kaneryd.\n\n89th minute: Rubensson picks up a yellow card for a hard foul on Chidiac.\n\n85th minute: The game has entered a bit of a lull in the last few minutes, as Sweden control the ball against an exhausted Australian side. It's been a rough end to a fantastic tournament for the Matildas.\n\n77th minute: Sam Kerr is back on her feet, meaning the injury doesn't look serious and she may still rejoin this game.\n\n76th minute: Bad news for Australia, as Sam Kerr is down and looks in incredible pain, it could be a reocurrence of the calf injury she picked up earlier in the tournament.\n\n74th minute: Another double change, as Chdiac and Courtney Nevin come on for Polkinghorne and Ellie Carpenter; Nevin makes her World Cup debut!\n\n72nd minute: Alex Chidiac is preparing to enter the field for Australia, she is the exact player they need right now if they are to get back in this match.\n\n70th minute: Hunt heads Cooney-Cross' free kick across goal and it's met by her centre back partner Polkinghorne, but the shot is straight at Musovic.\n\n67th minute: Sweden make their first changes, with goalscorer Asllani and Blackstenius replaced by Hurtig and Blomqvist.\n\n64th minute: The air has really come out of Brisbane Stadium with that goal, Australia had just made the changes to get them back in the match, yet they now find themselves two goals down.\n\n62nd minute: GOOOOAAAALLLL!!!!! ASLLANI DOUBLES SWEDEN'S LEAD!\n\nA devastating counter attack gives Asllani a chance from the edge of the area, and she lashes it into the far corner of the net. Long way back for Australia now...\n\nWatch in Australia:\n\nWatch in Canada:\n\nWatch in USA:\n\nWatch in UK:\n\n60th minute: The changes can be made, as Raso and Gorry make way for Vine and van Egmond.\n\n59th minute: Changes finally in the offing for Australia, as van Egmond and Vine prepare to enter the pitch, Gorry will be one of the departures, as she can barely move around the pitch right now.\n\n52nd minute: Australia giveaway the ball in the midfield, and it eventually finds Asllani, but Hunt is able to block the shot at the crucial moment. Australia really need to make changes here.\n\n46th minute: The second half begins, can Australia turn the tide after a tough first half? No changes for either side.\n\nHALF TIME: It will be interesting to see when Gustavsson makes changes. Apart from a couple of occasions, he likes to wait until after 70 minutes to make substitutions; the game will probably be long gone if he does the same tonight.\n\nHALFTIME\n\nIt's half time in Brisbane, where Sweden are 1-0 ahead in the third place playoff thanks to a Fridolina Rolfo penalty.\n\nClare Hunt's foul gave Sweden the chance from the spot, and they made no mistake. Australia have had some chances but have put in a tired and sluggish performance, and will need big improvement if they are to claim third place.\n\n45+8 minutes: Asllani received treatment for much longer, but is back to her feet like Foord.\n\n45+6 minutes: A lot of bite in this one, Gorry and Asllani get involved in a bit of push and shove, and after a strong shot from Kerr, Asllani and Foord collide and are receiving treatment.\n\n45+2 minutes: Arnold keeps Australia in it as she dives down low to save a shot from close range. Australia on the ropes at the end of the first half.\n\n45th minute: There will be five minutes of added time, as Gorry receives a yellow card for a cynical foul on Asllani.\n\n45th minute: Cooney-Cross' speculative effort almost deceives Musovic as it bounces before her and she struggles to collect, but eventually she deals with the danger.\n\n43rd minute: Rolfo cuts inside and has a shot at goal, but it goes wide of the goal. The Matildas on their heels at the moment, they can't concede another before half time.\n\n40th minute: Asllani pokes a shot at goal, but Arnold is able to save it comfortably. Sweden have been the better team in the first half.\n\n33rd minute: Kerr almost is able to control a Carpenter long ball, but it just evades her and runs to Musovic.\n\n29th minute: ROLFO CONVERTS AND SWEDEN LEAD!\n\nArnold guesses the right way, but the penalty is brilliantly placed by Rolfo, who scores her third goal of the tournament!\n\nWatch in Australia:\n\nWatch in Canada:\n\nWatch in USA:\n\nWatch in UK:\n\n27th minute: Referee Cheryl Foster is consulting with VAR for a potential penalty after contact from Clare Hunt on Blackstenius... AND SHE AWARDS A PENALTY! The contact was minimal, but Foster has deemed it enough to point to the spot.\n\nWatch in UK:\n\n26th minute: Rolfo hits the bar! Asllani's cross finds the winger, but her header glances off the crossbar and out.\n\n23rd minute: Raso's creates a great chance as she smashes a shot at the near post, requiring Musovic to be alert and make a save.\n\n19th minute: From Catley's corner, Polkinghorne get's a header away, but it skims off her head and bounces well wide of the goal.\n\n18th minute: Raso wins the ball of Ilestadt, giving Australia a sustained moment of possession, which leads to Foord's cross being turned behind for a corner. Better from the co-hosts!\n\n11th minute: Sweden continuing to dominate possession without having much cutting edge in attack, the Matildas know this could change in an instant though, and need to lift after a sluggish start.\n\n6th minute: Australia have been put under a lot of pressure early, but they break quickly and Foord wins a free kick after her cross smashes off Bjorn's arm.\n\n2nd minute: A very early chance for Sweden as Blackstenius gets a good shot on goal, and Mackenzie Arnold needs to have a strong right hand to parry it away before Carpenter clears.\n\nWatch in UK:\n\nKICK OFF\n\nWe're underway in the third place playoff in Brisbane, will the co-hosts be able to thank the fans for their support with a win?\n\n3 minutes from kickoff: The anthems are done, kick off not far away!\n\n7 minutes from kickoff: After a rousing Welcome to Country, the teams are moments from entering Brisbane Stadium!\n\n15 mins from kickoff: Gustavsson's decision to play a full strength team with so many players having played few or zero minutes at the tournament has received a mixed reception...\n\n30 mins from kickoff: These sides last met at the end of last year in Melbourne, where a second half clinic from Australia saw them claim a 4-0 win, which was the start of a strong run of form that has largely sustained itself until now. Sweden will hope for a much better performance today.\n\n45 mins from kickoff: This is just Sweden's second game in Australia all tournament, having played the bulk of their games in New Zealand. Their last match in the country was a special one, though, as they eliminated the USA in a thrilling Round of 16 penalty shootout!\n\n1hr from kickoff: Brisbane Stadium has the unique distinction of hosting Australia's lowest moment at the tournament — their 3-2 loss to Nigeria in the group stage — as well as their highlight in the dramatic penalty shootout victory over France in the quarterfinals. Will they be able to have a similar high this evening?\n\n1hr 15 mins from kickoff: The Matildas are wearing their away kit for just the second time this tournament; it served them well in their must win group game against Canada, can they have another strong performance in turquoise tonight?\n\n1hr 30 mins from kickoff: Well, well, well, the team news is in, and in a change to what is traditionally seen in this match, both sides have opted to make no changes from their semifinal defeats, and are opting to go into this match full strength. This means the likes of Zecira Musovic, Fridlolina Rolfo and Stina Blackstenius start for Sweden, and the Matildas will once again opt for Sam Kerr and Mary Fowler up top. It is surprising to see Australia make no changes, especially as they seemed to be heavily affected by fatigue in their loss to the Lionesses on Wednesday.\n\nSweden starting lineup (4-2-3-1): 1. Musovic (GK) — 2. Andersson, 13. Ilestedt, 6. Eriksson, 14. Bjorn — 16. Angeldal, 23. Rubensson — 19. Kaneryd, 9. Asllani, 18. Rolfo — 11. Blackstenius\n\nAustralia starting lineup (4-4-2): 18. Arnold (GK) — 21. Carpenter, 15. Hunt, 4. Polkinghorne, 7. Catley — 16. Raso, 19. Gorry, 23. Cooney-Cross, 9. Foord — 11. Fowler — 20. Kerr\n\n2 hrs from kickoff: Hello and welcome to The Sporting News' live coverage of the 2023 Women's World Cup third place playoff match between Sweden and Australia!\n\nAfter their World Cup dreams came to an end in the semifinals, both teams will want to bounce back and end their campaigns on a positive note by clinching bronze medals, while 50,000 Australia fans will relish the chance to celebrate their World Cup heroes for a final time after their magical journey.\n\nExpect to see some changes from both sides, who will still field strong teams and likely produce an entertaining game of football!\n\nSweden vs Australia lineups, team news\n\nIt is always difficult to predict lineups for third place playoff matches, as coaches often use the game as an opportunity to rotate and give more minutes to players who haven't featured prominently at the tournament.\n\nThis did not actualise for either side, as both coaches have opted to make no changes to their starting lineups from the semifinals\n\nCentre-back Amanda Ilestedt continued to chase the top goalscorer record – remarkable for a defender.\n\nSweden starting lineup (4-2-3-1): 1. Musovic (GK) — 2. Andersson, 13. Ilestedt, 6. Eriksson, 14. Bjorn — 16. Angeldal, 23. Rubensson — 19. Kaneryd, 9. Asllani, 18. Rolfo — 11. Blackstenius\n\nAustralia have used the fewest players of any side off the bench and generally rotated the least in the tournament, to the frustration of fans; and that continued as Tony Gustavsson kept the same side that started against England.\n\nThe likes of Courtney Nevin and Charli Grant did not come in for Ellie Carpenter or Steph Catley at full back, despite the pair struggling and showing signs of fatigue, while Clare Wheeler, Tameka Yallop and Alex Chidiac only getting the chance to impress in the midfield off the bench.\n\nAlanna Kennedy was once again ruled out of the game, as she was for the semifinal – this time because of delayed concussion symptoms.\n\nAustralia starting lineup (4-4-2): 18. Arnold (GK) — 21. Carpenter, 15. Hunt, 4. Polkinghorne, 7. Catley — 16. Raso, 19. Gorry, 23. Cooney-Cross, 9. Foord — 11. Fowler — 20.
