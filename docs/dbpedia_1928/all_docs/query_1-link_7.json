        "text": "New publication lead by our partners at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH), in the framework of our #H2020 project GRACED. It's a thorough analysis of our new biosensor, which proves and justifies the remarkable property that its sensitivity is independent of the length of the plasmonic stripe, where the interaction with the analyte takes place. Shorter stripes have lower propagation losses, but require more spectral bandwidth to interrogate. It's good to know we can engineer this solely based on the measurement system!

This post introduces a novel framework, correlational Lagrangian Schrödinger bridge (CLSB), which seeks the evolution \"bridging\" among cross-sectional observations, while regularized for the minimal population \"cost\", addressing challenges in accurate modeling of system dynamics. The blog post presents a new class of population regularizers capturing temporal variations in multivariate relations, and three domain-informed instantiations based on genetic co-expression stability. The empirical demonstration showcases the superiority of CLSB in single-cell sequencing data analyses, such as simulating cell development over time and predicting cellular responses to drugs of varied doses. I invite you to explore the full article for a deeper understanding of this innovative framework and its implications in modeling heterogeneous behaviors in scientific fields.

The point being that we're ---> complicated <--- and that the general strategy of taking a part of us whether DNA, RNA, Protein or cell out of context - will certainly provide data - data though that's of no relevance to identifying how to arrive at a model by which we may ensure increasingly happy and healthy increasing longevity of the species. The entire school of medicine is Materialist - and refuses to accept the existence of MIND where the defining characteristic of Man is MIND. Materialist Science is impotent in the face of the Informational construct of MIND.\n\nDo you need to annotate a genome, metagenome, or metatranscriptome fast at scale? Take a look at MetaCerberus for functional annotation (KOs, COGs, CAZy, PHROGs, VOGs etc). All HMM based. #rawlab #teamraw Paper: https://lnkd.in/g2sjssZy Code: https://lnkd.in/g95KnbxN Well done to PhD students @ElizaDh1 and Jose @UNCC_BIGScience for an excellent tool for meta-omics analysis. Annotate your microbial and viral genome on a laptop fast! Two years in the making! Excellent code across the board.\n\n“This theme is very well named ‘Omics, Wellness, and Longevity’… this sense would help everybody to live well, live happily, live healthily, and then live longer, live in healthy longevity,” explained Huanming Yang, Academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chairman of the International Conference on Genomics (#ICG), and Co-founder of #BGl Group. ICG is one of the most significant outcomes of the Human Genome Project and has become a monumental achievement in bringing together the top minds in global life sciences over the past two decades. Through this, global scientists are paving the way for a healthier and longer life for humankind. Listen to Yang discuss the exciting journey of uniting life sciences worldwide.\n\nLate post: I am thrilled to announce that my paper, which I am co-authored, has been accepted for publication in Scientific Reports in Nature Research Journal. 🎉 🎉 🎉 In this paper for the first time, we showed that: ⏺ An Internode Segment (INS) of a myelinated axon acts as a lowpass filter, and its filter characteristics depend on the number of myelin turns. ⏺ The representability of a neural signal could be altered with myelin loss in pathological conditions involving demyelinating diseases. ⏺ An alternative viewpoint that myelin geometry of an INS is optimised for maximising representability of the stimuli a fibre is meant to carry. ⏺ This new viewpoint could explain hitherto unexplained experimentally observed phenomena such as, shortening of INS length during demyelination and remyelination, and non-uniform distribution of INS in the central nervous system fibres and associated changes in diameter of nodes of Ranvier along an axon. ⏺ A compensatory action could take place during demyelination up to a certain number of loss of myelin turns to preserve the neural signal representability by simultaneous linear scaling of the length of an INS and the inner radius of the fibre. https://lnkd.in/e9NVAdzJ\n\n📖 Just finished reading the latest pre-print authored by the collaborative team from Dianox, Københavns Universitet - University of Copenhagen, DTU - Technical University of Denmark, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Google. The paper introduces an innovative approach to enhance the binding interaction between aptamers and proteins, as well as aptamers and small molecules. The method uses BERT and undergoes pre-training with an extensive sequence database from Dianox. I might be biased due to my previous work, which includes papers on utilizing Multi-Head attentions for signal peptide detection from sequences (2019), transfer learning for understanding open chromatin grammar at the sequence level (2022), and #LLM + #xAI for better disease understanding (presented just a few weeks ago), but I appreciated the fine-tuning strategy for smaller biological tasks and the subsequent inspection of attention mechanisms. This definitely can open up to many more downstream tasks. So, I'm curious about the next steps in this research. Perhaps making the pre-trained model accessible to the community? It would be fascinating to explore its capabilities. In the meantime, congratulations to Christian Code Flemming Morsch Danny Lange, and all the co-authors.

Hence, a deep synthesis and amalgamation of all available data is needed to achieve next-generation, deep evidence-based medicine. The main challenge ahead in the next two decades will be extracting, collating and mining large sets of natural history data, genomics and all omics analyses, all published clinical studies, RWD and amassed data from the IoMT to provide next-generation evidence for deep medicine.\" (RWD =real-world data; IoMT= internet of medical things) Subbiah, V.
