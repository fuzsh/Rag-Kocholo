        "text": "Performance index for virtual reality phacoemulsification surgery\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSÃ¶derberg, Per; Laurell, Carl-Gustaf; Simawi, Wamidh; Skarman, Eva; Nordqvist, Per; Nordh, Leif\n\n2007-02-01\n\nWe have developed a virtual reality (VR) simulator for phacoemulsification (phaco) surgery. The current work aimed at developing a performance index that characterizes the performance of an individual trainee. We recorded measurements of 28 response variables during three iterated surgical sessions in 9 subjects naive to cataract surgery and 6 experienced cataract surgeons, separately for the sculpting phase and the evacuation phase of phacoemulsification surgery. We further defined a specific performance index for a specific measurement variable and a total performance index for a specific trainee. The distribution function for the total performance index was relatively evenly distributed both for the sculpting and the evacuation phase indicating that parametric statistics can be used for comparison of total average performance indices for different groups in the future. The current total performance index for an individual considers all measurement variables included with the same weight. It is possible that a future development of the system will indicate that a better characterization of a trainee can be obtained if the various measurements variables are given specific weights. The currently developed total performance index for a trainee is statistically an independent observation of that particular trainee.\n\n48 CFR 1252.211-70 - Index for specifications.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-10-01\n\n... 48 Federal Acquisition Regulations System 5 2010-10-01 2010-10-01 false Index for specifications...

Most of the biometeorological indexes were developed decades ago and only applicable to certain locations because of different climate types. Merely using standard biometeorological indexes to replace typical weather factors in biometeorological studies of different locations may not be an ideal research direction. This research is aimed at assessing the difference of statistical power between using standard biometeorological indexes and typical weather factors on describing the effects of extreme weather conditions on daily ambulance demands in Hong Kong. Results showed that net effective temperature and apparent temperature did not perform better than typical weather factors in describing daily ambulance demands in this study. The maximum adj- R 2 improvement was only 0.08, whereas the maximum adj- R 2 deterioration was 0.07. In this study, biometeorological indexes did not perform better than typical weather factors, possibly due to the differences of built environments and lifestyles in different locations and eras. Regarding built environments, the original parameters for calculating the index values may not be applicable to Hong Kong as buildings in Hong Kong are extremely dense and most are equipped with air conditioners. Regarding lifestyles, the parameters, which were set decades ago, may be outdated and not suitable to modern lifestyles as using hand-held electrical fans on the street to help reduce heat stress are popular. Hence, it is ideal to have tailor-made updated location-specific biometeorological indexes to study the effects of weather on human health.\n\nNew model performance index for engineering design of control systems\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1970-01-01\n\nPerformance index includes a model representing linear control-system design specifications. Based on a geometric criterion for approximation of the model by the actual system, the index can be interpreted directly in terms of the desired system response model without actually having the model's time response.\n\nDevelopment of an operational specific CAT risk (SCATR) index\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKeller, J. L.; Haines, P. A.; Luers, J. K.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nThe original formulations of Roach (1970) and Oard (1974) for the calculation of clear air turbulence (CAT) potential from synoptic scale data were extended. An index which gives a measure of the specific risk of encountering CAT - the specific clear air turbulence risk (SCATR) index - was defined. This index takes into account both the locally and advected contributions to the energy necessary for CAT. The advected contribution is associated with the role of atmospheric gravity waves. The SCATR index was calculated for a number of cases where documented encounters with CAT occurred. Of particular interest were those made for cases involving severe CAT. The results for the two severe CAT cases run were quite impressive and elicited considerable interest from operational aviation meteorologists.\n\nRock Drilling Performance Evaluation by an Energy Dissipation Based Rock Brittleness Index\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMunoz, H.; Taheri, A.; Chanda, E. K.\n\n2016-08-01\n\nTo reliably estimate drilling performance both tool-rock interaction laws along with a proper rock brittleness index are required to be implemented. In this study, the performance of a single polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) cutter cutting and different drilling methods including PDC rotary drilling, roller-cone rotary drilling and percussive drilling were investigated. To investigate drilling performance by rock strength properties, laboratory PDC cutting tests were performed on different rocks to obtain cutting parameters. In addition, results of laboratory and field drilling on different rocks found elsewhere in literature were used. Laboratory and field cutting and drilling test results were coupled with values of a new rock brittleness index proposed herein and developed based on energy dissipation withdrawn from the complete stress-strain curve in uniaxial compression. To quantify cutting and drilling performance, the intrinsic specific energy in rotary-cutting action, i.e. the energy consumed in pure cutting action, and drilling penetration rate values in percussive action were used. The results show that the new energy-based brittleness index successfully describes the performance of different cutting and drilling methods and therefore is relevant to assess drilling performance for engineering applications.\n\nMethod for indexing and retrieving manufacturing-specific digital imagery based on image content\n\nDOEpatents\n\nFerrell, Regina K.; Karnowski, Thomas P.; Tobin, Jr., Kenneth W.\n\n2004-06-15\n\nA method for indexing and retrieving manufacturing-specific digital images based on image content comprises three steps. First, at least one feature vector can be extracted from a manufacturing-specific digital image stored in an image database. In particular, each extracted feature vector corresponds to a particular characteristic of the manufacturing-specific digital image, for instance, a digital image modality and overall characteristic, a substrate/background characteristic, and an anomaly/defect characteristic. Notably, the extracting step includes generating a defect mask using a detection process. Second, using an unsupervised clustering method, each extracted feature vector can be indexed in a hierarchical search tree. Third, a manufacturing-specific digital image associated with a feature vector stored in the hierarchicial search tree can be retrieved, wherein the manufacturing-specific digital image has image content comparably related to the image content of the query image. More particularly, can include two data reductions, the first performed based upon a query vector extracted from a query image. Subsequently, a user can select relevant images resulting from the first data reduction. From the selection, a prototype vector can be calculated, from which a second-level data reduction can be performed. The second-level data reduction can result in a subset of feature vectors comparable to the prototype vector, and further comparable to the query vector. An additional fourth step can include managing the hierarchical search tree by substituting a vector average for several redundant feature vectors encapsulated by nodes in the hierarchical search tree.\n\n[Simultaneous determination of five main index components and specific chromatograms analysis in Xiaochaihu granules].\n\nPubMed\n\nZhuang, Yan-Shuang; Cai, Hao; Liu, Xiao; Cai, Bao-Chang\n\n2012-01-01\n\nReversed phase high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector was employed for simultaneous determination of five main index components and specific chromatograms analysis in Xiaochaihu granules with a linear gradient elution of acetonitrile-water (containing 0.1% phosphoric acid) as mobile phase. The results showed that five main index components (baicalin, baicalein, wogonoside, wogonin, enoxolone) were separated well under the analytical condition. The linear ranges of five components were 0.518 - 16.576, 0.069 - 2.197, 0.167 - 5.333, 0.009 - 0.297 and 0.006 - 0.270 mg x g(-1), respectively. The correlation coefficients were 0.999 9, and the average recoveries ranged from 95% to 105%. Twelve common peaks were selected as the specific chromatograms of Xiaochaihu granules with baicalin as the reference peak. There were good similarities between the reference and the ten batches of samples. The similarity coefficients were no less than 0.9. The analytical method established is highly sensitive with strong specificity and it can be used efficiently in the quality control of Xiaochaihu granules.\n\nEstablishment of key grid-connected performance index system for integrated PV-ES system\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, Q.; Yuan, X. D.; Qi, Q.; Liu, H. M.\n\n2016-08-01\n\nIn order to further promote integrated optimization operation of distributed new energy/ energy storage/ active load, this paper studies the integrated photovoltaic-energy storage (PV-ES) system which is connected with the distribution network, and analyzes typical structure and configuration selection for integrated PV-ES generation system. By combining practical grid- connected characteristics requirements and technology standard specification of photovoltaic generation system, this paper takes full account of energy storage system, and then proposes several new grid-connected performance indexes such as paralleled current sharing characteristic, parallel response consistency, adjusting characteristic, virtual moment of inertia characteristic, on- grid/off-grid switch characteristic, and so on. A comprehensive and feasible grid-connected performance index system is then established to support grid-connected performance testing on integrated PV-ES system.\n\n[Relationship between the refractive index and specific gravity of the rat urine (author's transl)].\n\nPubMed\n\nKitagawa, Y F; Takahashi, T; Hayashi, H\n\n1981-07-01\n\nThe relationship between the refractive index and specific gravity of urine was studied with specimens from 165 Sprague-Dawley rats, by graphic analysis of the plot of the refractometrically determined index against the specific gravity which was measured with a pycnometer. 1. A linear regression was demonstrated between the refractive index and specific gravity. 2. The nomogram fitted the data of even those samples with high refractive index and specific gravity, irrespective of changes in food or water intake and protein or glucose contents in the urine. 3. The nomogram was in good agreement, in respect of linearity, with the regression line derived from the conversion table of TS meter by the American Optical Corporation and also with the nomogram of the Japanese Society of Clinical Pathology. It approximated more closely to the former than to the latter.\n\nComparing the performance of two CBIRS indexing schemes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMueller, Wolfgang; Robbert, Guenter; Henrich, Andreas\n\n2003-01-01\n\nContent based image retrieval (CBIR) as it is known today has to deal with a number of challenges. Quickly summarized, the main challenges are firstly, to bridge the semantic gap between high-level concepts and low-level features using feedback, secondly to provide performance under adverse conditions. High-dimensional spaces, as well as a demanding machine learning task make the right way of indexing an important issue. When indexing multimedia data, most groups opt for extraction of high-dimensional feature vectors from the data, followed by dimensionality reduction like PCA (Principal Components Analysis) or LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). The resulting vectors are indexed using spatial indexing structures such as kd-trees or R-trees, for example. Other projects, such as MARS and Viper propose the adaptation of text indexing techniques, notably the inverted file. Here, the Viper system is the most direct adaptation of text retrieval techniques to quantized vectors. However, while the Viper query engine provides decent performance together with impressive user-feedback behavior, as well as the possibility for easy integration of long-term learning algorithms, and support for potentially infinite feature vectors, there has been no comparison of vector-based methods and inverted-file-based methods under similar conditions. In this publication, we compare a CBIR query engine that uses inverted files (Bothrops, a rewrite of the Viper query engine based on a relational database), and a CBIR query engine based on LSD (Local Split Decision) trees for spatial indexing using the same feature sets. The Benchathlon initiative works on providing a set of images and ground truth for simulating image queries by example and corresponding user feedback. When performing the Benchathlon benchmark on a CBIR system (the System Under Test, SUT), a benchmarking harness connects over internet to the SUT, performing a number of queries using an agreed-upon protocol, the multimedia\n\n41 CFR 101-29.216 - Department of Defense Index of Specifications and Standards (DODISS).\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-07-01\n\n... 41 Public Contracts and Property Management 2 2010-07-01 2010-07-01 true Department of Defense...

The test collection of documents in the National Library of Medicine's Medline file indexed under cystic fibrosis is described, and use of the SMART information retrieval system is discussed.â¦\n\nQuality of pharmacy-specific Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) assignment in pharmacy journals indexed in MEDLINE.\n\nPubMed\n\nMinguet, Fernando; Salgado, Teresa M; van den Boogerd, Lucienne; Fernandez-Llimos, Fernando\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) is the National Library of Medicine (NLM) controlled vocabulary for indexing articles. Inaccuracies in the MeSH thesaurus have been reported for several areas including pharmacy. To assess the quality of pharmacy-specific MeSH assignment to articles indexed in pharmacy journals. The 10 journals containing the highest number of articles published in 2012 indexed under the MeSH 'Pharmacists' were identified. All articles published over a 5-year period (2008-2012) in the 10 previously selected journals were retrieved from PubMed. MeSH terms used to index these articles were extracted and pharmacy-specific MeSH terms were identified. The frequency of use of pharmacy-specific MeSH terms was calculated across journals. A total of 6989 articles were retrieved from the 10 pharmacy journals, of which 328 (4.7%) were articles not fully indexed and therefore did not contain any MeSH terms assigned. Among the 6661 articles fully indexed, the mean number of MeSH terms was 10.1 (SDÂ =Â 4.0), being 1.0 (SDÂ =Â 1.3) considered as Major MeSH. Both values significantly varied across journals. The mean number of pharmacy-specific MeSH terms per article was 0.9 (SDÂ =Â 1.2). A total of 3490 (52.4%) of the 6661 articles were indexed in pharmacy journals without a single pharmacy-specific MeSH. Of the total 67193 MeSH terms assigned to articles, on average 10.5% (SDÂ =Â 13.9) were pharmacy-specific MeSH. A statistically significant different pattern of pharmacy-specific MeSH assignment was identified across journals (Kruskal-Wallis PÂ <Â 0.001). The quality of assignment of the existing pharmacy-specific MeSH terms to articles indexed in pharmacy journals can be improved to further enhance evidence gathering in pharmacy. Over half of the articles published in the top-10 journals publishing pharmacy literature were indexed without a single pharmacy-specific MeSH. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, retrieving evidence from such repositories at local sites presents many challenges. This paper describes a methodological framework for automatically indexing and retrieving empirical research evidence in the form of the systematic reviews and associated studies from The Cochrane Library, where retrieved documents are specific to a patient-physician encounter and thus can be used to support evidence-based decision making at the point of care. Such an encounter is defined by three pertinent groups of concepts - diagnosis, treatment, and patient, and the framework relies on these three groups to steer indexing and retrieval of reviews and associated studies. An evaluation of the indexing and retrieval components of the proposed framework was performed using documents relevant for the pediatric asthma domain. Precision and recall values for automatic indexing of systematic reviews and associated studies were 0.93 and 0.87, and 0.81 and 0.56, respectively. Moreover, precision and recall for the retrieval of relevant systematic reviews and associated studies were 0.89 and 0.81, and 0.92 and 0.89, respectively. With minor modifications, the proposed methodological framework can be customized for other evidence repositories. Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In recent years, physician performance scorecards have been used to provide feedback on individual measures; however, one key challenge is how to develop a composite quality index that combines multiple measures for overall physician performance evaluation. A controversy arises over establishing appropriate weights to combine indicators in multiple dimensions, and cannot be easily resolved. In this study, we proposed a generic unsupervised learning approach to develop a single composite index for physician performance assessment by using non-negative principal component analysis. We developed a new algorithm named iterative quadratic programming to solve the numerical issue in the non-negative principal component analysis approach. We conducted real case studies to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. We provided interpretations from both statistical and clinical perspectives to evaluate the developed composite ranking score in practice. In addition, we implemented the root cause assessment techniques to explain physician performance for improvement purposes.

The antenna consists of a semi-circular patch, a 50Î© microstrip feed line and metamaterial ground plane. The antenna occupies a very small space of 37 Ã 47 Ã 0.508 mm3, making it suitable for mobile wireless application. The perceptible novelty shown in this proposed antenna is that reduction of specific absorption rate using the negative index metamaterial ground plane. The proposed antenna reduced 72.11 and 75.53 % of specific absorption rate at 1.8 and 2.4 GHz, respectively.\n\nEvaluation of left ventricular Tei index (index of myocardial performance) in healthy dogs and dogs with mitral regurgitation.\n\nPubMed\n\nTeshima, Kenji; Asano, Kazushi; Iwanaga, Koji; Koie, Hiroshi; Uechi, Masami; Kato, Yuka; Kutara, Kenji; Kanno, Nobuyuki; Seki, Mamiko; Edamura, Kazuya; Hasegawa, Atsuhiko; Tanaka, Shigeo\n\n2007-02-01\n\nThe left ventricular (LV) Tei index (index of myocardial performance) has been demonstrated to be clinically useful in estimating comprehensive LV function, including the systolic and diastolic performances, in various human cardiac diseases. The purposes of this study were to validate the correlation between the LV Tei index and LV function obtained by cardiac catheterization in healthy dogs, and to evaluate the LV Tei index in dogs with naturally occurring mitral regurgitation (MR). In healthy dogs, the LV Tei index was significantly correlated with the LV peak +dP/dt (r = -0.89) and LV peak -dP/dt (r=0.87). The LV Tei index significantly increased in dogs with MR compared with normal dogs and significantly increased with progressively more severe clinical signs due to heart failure. The elevation of the LV Tei index in dogs with symptomatic MR appears to be associated with shortening of ejection time. The LV Tei index significantly increased with age and was not correlated with heart rate and body weight in normal dogs. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the LV Tei index was measurable in dogs and not influenced by heart rate and body weight. The LV Tei index significantly increased with the progression of clinical signs in MR dogs. In particular, the elevation of the LV Tei index in dogs with symptomatic MR due to shortening of ejection time may suggest LV systolic dysfunction and the decrement of forward stroke volume.\n\nEffect of ecological group classification schemes on performance of the AMBI benthic index in US coastal waters\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nThe AZTI Marine Biotic Index (AMBI) requires less geographically-specific calibration than other benthic indices, but has not performed as well in US coastal waters as it has in the European waters for which it was originally developed.

In Indonesia, this performance is quantified through Environmental Quality Index (EQI) which consists of three indicators, i.e. river quality index, air quality index, and coverage of land cover. The current of this instrument data processing was done by averaging and weighting each index to represent the EQI at the provincial level. However, we found EQI interpretations that may contain some uncertainties and have a range of circumstances possibly less appropriate if processed under a common statistical approach. In this research, we aim to manage the indicators of EQI with a more intuitive computation technique and make some inferences related to the environmental performance in 33 provinces in Indonesia. Research was conducted in three stages of Mamdani Fuzzy Inference System (MAFIS), i.e. fuzzification, data inference, and defuzzification. Data input consists of 10 environmental parameters and the output is an index of Environmental Quality Performance (EQP). Research was applied to the environmental condition data set in 2015 and quantified the results into the scale of 0 to 100, i.e. 10 provinces at good performance with the EQP above 80 dominated by provinces in eastern part of Indonesia, 22 provinces with the EQP between 80 to 50, and one province in Java Island with the EQP below 20. This research shows that environmental quality performance can be quantified without eliminating the natures of the data set and simultaneously is able to show the environment behavior along with its spatial pattern distribution.\n\nAssessment of indexing trends with specific and general terms for herbal medicine.\n\nPubMed\n\nBartol, Tomaz\n\n2012-12-01\n\nConcepts for medicinal plants are represented by a variety of associated general terms with specific indexing patterns in databases, which may not consistently reflect growth of records. The objectives of this study are to assess the development in databases by identifying general terms that describe herbal medicine with optimal retrieval recall and to identify possible special trends in co-occurrence of specific and general concepts. Different search strategies are tested in cab abstracts, medline and web of science. Specific terms (Origanum and Salvia) are employed. Relevant general terms (e.g. 'Plants, Medicinal', Phytotherapy, Herbal drugs) are identified, along with indexing trends and co-occurrences. Growth trends, in specific (narrower) terms, are similar among databases. General terms, however, exhibit dissimilar trends, sometimes almost opposing one another. Co-occurrence of specific and general terms is changing over time. General terms may not denote definite development of trends as the use of terms differs amongst databases, making it difficult to correctly assess possible numbers of relevant records. Perceived increase can, sometimes, be attributed to an increased occurrence of a more general term alongside the specific one. Thesaurus-controlled databases may yield more hits, because of 'up-posted' (broader) terms. Use of broader terms is helpful as it enhances retrieval of relevant documents. Â© 2012 The authors.

L.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nThe fundamental emphasis of this research was to develop a technique which would be a significant improvement over those currently used for flight planning to avoid clear air turbulence (CAT). The technique should, ideally, be both quantitative in determining potential intensity and specific in locating regions of relatively high risk. Furthermore, it should not rely on specialized data but be functional using the currently available rawinsonde observation (raob) system. Encouraging results documented in an earlier investigation were considered compelling enough to warrant a closer look into the possibilities of a Specific Clear Air Turbulence Risk (SCATR) index approach to the clear air turbulence problem. Unlike that research, which considered sustained periods of flight in light to moderate clear air turbulence, this study focuses on several cases of documented severe CAT. Results of these case studies suggest that a SCATR index is not an unrealizable goal and that uses of such an index, event in its current prototype level of development, are also apparent.\n\nThe physical and empirical basis for a specific clear-air turbulence risk index\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKeller, J. L.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nAn improved operational CAT detection and forecasting technique is developed and detailed. This technique is the specific clear air turbulence risk (SCATR) index. This index shows some promising results. The improvements seen using hand analyzed data, as a result of the more realistic representation of the vertical shear of the horizontal wind, are also realized in the data analysis used in the PROFS/CWP application. The SCATR index should improve as database enhancements such as profiler and VAS satellite data, which increase the resolution in space and time, are brought into even more sophisticated objective analysis schemes.\n\nReactive Agility Performance in Handball; Development and Evaluation of a Sport-Specific Measurement Protocol\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSpasic, Miodrag; Krolo, Ante; Zenic, Natasa; Delextrat, Anne; Sekulic, Damir\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThere is no current study that examined sport-specific tests of reactive-agility and change-of-direction-speed (CODS) to replicate real-sport environment in handball (team-handball). This investigation evaluated the reliability and validity of two novel tests designed to assess reactive-agility and CODS of handball players. Participants were female (25.14 Â± 3.71 years of age; 1.77 Â± 0.09 m and 74.1 Â± 6.1 kg) and male handball players (26.9 Â± 4.1 years of age; 1.90 Â± 0.09 m and 93.90Â±4.6 kg). Variables included body height, body mass, body mass index, broad jump, 5-m sprint, CODS and reactive-agility tests. Results showed satisfactory reliability for reactive-agility-test and CODS-test (ICC of 0.85-0.93, and CV of 2.4-4.8%). The reactive-agility and CODS shared less than 20% of the common variance. The calculated index of perceptual and reactive capacity (P&RC; ratio between reactive-agility- and CODS-performance) is found to be valid measure in defining true-game reactive-agility performance in handball in both genders. Therefore, the handball athletesâ P&RC should be used in the evaluation of real-game reactive-agility performance. Future studies should explore other sport-specific reactive-agility tests and factors associated to such performance in sports involving agile maneuvers. Key points Reactive agility and change-of-direction-speed should be observed as independent qualities, even when tested over the same course and similar movement template The reactive-agility-performance of the handball athletes involved in defensive duties is closer to their non-reactive-agility-score than in their peers who are not involved in defensive duties The handball specific âtrue-gameâ reactive-agility-performance should be evaluated as the ratio between reactive-agility and corresponding CODS performance.

Four types of ergonomics indexes were studied, i.e., dexterity, tactile sensibility (TS), strength and fatigue. Two test items of insert sticks into a holes-board (ISIHB) and nuts-bolts assembly task (NBAT) were used to measure dexterity, while shape discrimination (SD) was employed for TS, and grip force (GF) for strength and fatigue. The variables measured in this investigation included accomplishing time (AT) of ISIHB and NBAT, correct rate (CR) of SD, maximal grip force (MGF), instant grip force (IGF) and endurance time of grip force (ETGF). Experiments were conducted on 31 undergraduates (eight female and 23 male) with two experiment conditions of bare-hand group and gloved hand group. Results demonstrated that dexterity and TS performance of gloved hand group declined significantly compared with those of bare-hand group (p<0.001). There were not significant differences in strength and fatigue between two conditions (p>0.05). Four effective functional relationships were developed between four pairs of ergonomics indexes in bare-hand group. In gloved hand group, in addition to above-mentioned four pairs of relationships, another formula was found, which was y^=0.02061+0.01233x ( p<0.01, dexterity and TS).\n\nSpecific surface area as a maturity index of lunar fines\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGammage, R. B.; Holmes, H. F.\n\n1975-01-01\n\nMature surface fines have an equilibrium specific surface area of about 0.6 sq m/g the equivalent mean particle size being about 3 microns. The adsorption behavior of inert gases (reversible isotherms) indicates that the particles are also nonporous in the size range of pores from 10 to 3000 A. Apparently, in mature soils there is a balance in the forces which cause fining, attrition, pore filling, and growth of lunar dust grains. Immature, lightly irradiated soils usually have coarser grains which reduce in size as aging proceeds. The specific surface area, determined by nitrogen or krypton sorption at 77 K, is a valuable index of soil maturity.\n\nDeveloping an Index to Measure Health System Performance: Measurement for Districts of Nepal.\n\nPubMed\n\nKandel, N; Fric, A; Lamichhane, J\n\n2014-01-01\n\nVarious frameworks for measuring health system performance have been proposed and discussed. The scope of using performance indicators are broad, ranging from examining national health system to individual patients at various levels of health system. Development of innovative and easy index is essential to measure multidimensionality of health systems. We used indicators, which also serve as proxy to the set of activities, whose primary goal is to maintain and improve health. We used eleven indicators of MDGs, which represent all dimensions of health to develop index. These indicators are computed with similar methodology that of human development index. We used published data of Nepal for computation of the index for districts of Nepal as an illustration. To validate our finding, we compared the indices of these districts with other development indices of Nepal. An index for each district has been computed from eleven indicators. Then indices are compared with that of human development index, socio-economic and infrastructure development indices and findings has shown the similarity on distribution of districts. Categories of low and high performing districts on health system performance are also having low and high human development, socio-economic, and infrastructure indices respectively. This methodology of computing index from various indicators could assist policy makers and program managers to prioritize activities based on their performance. Validation of the findings with that of other development indicators show that this can be one of the tools, which can assist on assessing health system performance for policy makers, program managers and others.\n\nDevelopment of multi-functional streetscape green infrastructure using a performance index approach.\n\nPubMed\n\nTiwary, A; Williams, I D; Heidrich, O; Namdeo, A; Bandaru, V; Calfapietra, C\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis paper presents a performance evaluation framework for streetscape vegetation. A performance index (PI) is conceived using the following seven traits, specific to the street environments - Pollution Flux Potential (PFP), Carbon Sequestration Potential (CSP), Thermal Comfort Potential (TCP), Noise Attenuation Potential (NAP), Biomass Energy Potential (BEP), Environmental Stress Tolerance (EST) and Crown Projection Factor (CPF). Its application is demonstrated through a case study using fifteen street vegetation species from the UK, utilising a combination of direct field measurements and inventoried literature data. Our results indicate greater preference to small-to-medium size trees and evergreen shrubs over larger trees for streetscaping. The proposed PI approach can be potentially applied two-fold: one, for evaluation of the performance of the existing street vegetation, facilitating the prospects for further improving them through management strategies and better species selection; two, for planning new streetscapes and multi-functional biomass as part of extending the green urban infrastructure.

With its less than one nanometer hyperspectral resolution and hourly revisit capabilities, NASA's Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) sensor provides new opportunities for monitoring regional food security. Chlorophyll fluorescence can be retrieved by TEMPO using Oxygen B (O2-B) absorption region at 687 nm. The Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) is calculated from spectral reflectance at 531 and 570. However, TEMPO spectral range covers from 290 mm - 490 nm and 540 nm -740 nm, does not provide the 531 nm measurement band for PRI. It is imperative to develop alternate wavelengths within the TEMPO spectral range for these early stress indicators so that regional crop health can be observed by TEMPO with unparalleled spectral and temporal resolutions to address food security. Combining field and airborne remote sensing experiments and radiative transfer simulations, this work proposes a TEMPO specific PRI and demonstrates that TEMPO offers a new set of high-resolution spectral data for crop monitoring.\n\nDiagnostic performance of body mass index to identify excess body fat in children with cerebral palsy.\n\nPubMed\n\nDuran, Ibrahim; Schulze, Josefa; Martakis, KyriakoS; Stark, Christina; Schoenau, Eckhard\n\n2018-03-07\n\nTo assess the diagnostic performance of body mass index (BMI) cut-off values according to recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Obesity Federation (WOF), and the German Society for Adiposity (DAG) to identify excess body fat in children with cerebral palsy (CP). The present study was a monocentric retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data among children and adolescents with CP participating in a rehabilitation programme. Excess body fat was defined as a body fat percentage above the 85th centile assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. In total, 329 children (181 males, 148 females) with CP were eligible for analysis. The mean age was 12Â years 4Â months (standard deviation 2y 9mo). The BMI cut-off values for 'overweight' according to the WHO, WOF, and DAG showed the following sensitivities and specificities for the prediction of excess body fat in our population: WHO: sensitivity 0.768 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.636-0.870), specificity 0.894 (95% CI 0.851-0.928); WOF: sensitivity 0.696 (95% CI 0.559-0.812), specificity 0.934 (95% CI 0.898-0.960); DAG: sensitivity 0.411 (95% CI 0.281-0.550), specificity 0.993 (95% CI 0.974-0.999). Body mass index showed high specificity, but low sensitivity in children with CP. Thus, 'normal-weight obese' children with CP were overlooked, when assessing excess body fat only using BMI. Excess body fat in children with cerebral palsy (CP) is less common than previously reported. Body mass index (BMI) had high specificity but low sensitivity in detecting excess body fat in children with CP. BMI evaluation criteria of the German Society for Adiposity could be improved in children with CP.

Subjects and Methods One hundred and ninety-five Nobel laureates in Physiology and Medicine from 1901 to 2009 were considered. Year of first and last publications, total publications and citation counts, and the H index for each laureate were calculated from each database. Cronbach's alpha statistics was used to measure the reliability of H index scores between the databases. Laureate characteristic influence on the H index was analysed using linear regression. Results There was no concordance between the databases when considering the number of publications and citations count per laureate. The H index was the most reliably calculated bibliometric across the three databases (Cronbach's alpha = 0.900). All databases returned significantly higher H index scores for younger laureates (p < 0.0001). Google Scholar and Web of Science returned significantly higher H index for physician laureates (p = 0.025 and p = 0.029, respectively). Country of institutional affiliation did not influence the H index in any database. Conclusion The H index appeared to be the most consistently calculated bibliometric between the databases for Nobel laureates in Physiology and Medicine. Researcher-specific characteristics constituted an important component of objective research assessment. The findings of this study call to question the choice of current and future academic performance databases.

M.; Miller, P. L.; Cullen, M. R.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nThis paper describes a prototype information sources map (ISM), an on-line information source finder, for Occupational and Environmental Medicine (OEM). The OEM ISM was built as part of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) project of the National Library of Medicine. It allows a user to identify sources of on-line information appropriate to a specific OEM question, and connect to the sources. In the OEM ISM we explore a domain-specific method of indexing information source contents, and also a domain-specific user interface. The indexing represents a domain expert's opinion of the specificity of an information source in helping to answer specific types of domain questions. For each information source, an index field represents whether a source might provide useful information in an occupational, industrial, or environmental category. Additional fields represent the degree of specificity of a source in individual question types in each category. The paper discusses the development, design, and implementation of the prototype OEM ISM.

Our matching and packing algorithm is a general approach for packing data according to a similarity metric. First an approximate k-nearest neighbor graph is constructed using vantage-point initialization, an improvement to previous work that decreases construction time while improving the quality of approximation. Then graph matching is iteratively performed to pack related items closely together. The end result is a dense index with good performance. We define a new query specification for shape matching that uses minimum and maximum shape constraints to explicitly specify the spatial requirements of the desired shape. This specification provides a natural language for performing volumetric shape matching and is readily supported by the geometry-based similarity search (GSS) tree, an indexing structure that maintains explicit representations of volumetric shape. We describe our implementation of a GSS tree for volumetric shape matching and provide a comprehensive evaluation of parameter sensitivity, performance, and scalability. Compared to previous bulk-loading algorithms, we find that matching and packing can construct a GSS-tree index in the same amount of time that is denser, flatter, and better performing, with an observed average performance improvement of 2X.

To tackle this issue, refractive index engineering method is investigated, which can be realized by subwavelength grating. Subwavelength gratings are periodical structures with pitches small enough to locally synthesize the refractive index of photonic waveguides, which allows direct control of optical profile as well as easier fabrication process. This review provides an introduction to the basics of subwavelength structures and pay special attention to the design strategies of some representative examples of subwavelength grating devices, including: edge couplers, fiber-chip grating couplers, directional couplers and multimode interference couplers. Benefited from the subwavelength grating which can engineer the refractive index as well as birefringence and dispersion, these devices show better performance when compared to their conventional counterparts.\n\nEvaluation of right ventricular Tei index (index of myocardial performance) in healthy dogs and dogs with tricuspid regurgitation.\n\nPubMed\n\nTeshima, Kenji; Asano, Kazushi; Iwanaga, Koji; Koie, Hiroshi; Uechi, Masami; Kato, Yuka; Kutara, Kenji; Edamura, Kazuya; Hasegawa, Atsuhiko; Tanaka, Shigeo\n\n2006-12-01\n\nRight ventricular (RV) Tei index (index of myocardial performance) has been demonstrated to be clinically useful in estimating RV function in various human cardiac diseases. The purposes of this study were to validate the correlation between RV Tei index and RV function obtained by cardiac catheterization in healthy dogs, and to evaluate the RV Tei index in dogs with tricuspid regurgitation (TR). In healthy dogs, the RV Tei index significantly correlated with the RV peak +dP/dt (r=-0.80, p<0.0001) and -dP/dt (r=0.69, p=0.0001). In normal dogs, the RV Tei index was not significantly correlated with heart rate, body weight, and age. The RV Tei index significantly increased in dogs with moderate to severe TR (0.39 +/- 0.35, p=0.0015), filariasis (0.46 +/- 0.16, p=0.0131), and trivial to mild TR and severe mitral regurgitation (MR; 0.61 +/- 0.14, p=0.0017) when compared with the normal dogs (0.17 +/- 0.10). In addition, the RV Tei index in dogs with TR significantly increased in association with pulmonary hypertension [PH(-), 0.19 +/- 0.09; PH(+), 0.65 +/- 0.14; respectively p<0.0001]. Our study has demonstrated that RV Tei index is a feasible approach to estimate RV function in dogs and is not influenced by heart rate, body weight, and aging. Further investigations are required to clarify the clinical significance of RV Tei index in dogs with right-sided cardiac diseases.\n\nAccuracy of indexing coverage information as reported by serials sources.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nEldredge, J D\n\n1993-01-01\n\nThis article reports on the accuracy of indexing service coverage information listed in three serials sources: Ulrich's International Periodicals Directory, SERLINE, and The Serials Directory. The titles studied were randomly selected journals that began publication in either 1981 or 1986. Aggregate results reveal that these serials sources perform at 92%, 97%, and 95% levels of accuracy respectively. When the results are analyzed by specific indexing services by year, the performance scores ranged from 80% to 100%. All three serials sources tend to underreport index coverage. The author advances five recommendations for improving index coverage accuracy and four specific proposals for future research. The results suggest that, for the immediate future, librarians should treat index coverage information reported in these three serials sources with some skepticism.

The current work aimed at developing a relative performance index that characterizes the performance of an individual trainee. We recorded measurements of 28 response variables during three iterated surgical sessions in 9 experienced cataract surgeons, separately for the sculpting phase and the evacuation phase of phacoemulsification surgery and compared their outcome to that of a reference group of naive trainees. We defined an individual overall performance index, an individual class specific performance index and an individual variable specific performance index. We found that on an average the experienced surgeons performed at a lower level than a reference group of naive trainees but that this was particularly attributed to a few surgeons. When their overall performance index was further analyzed as class specific performance index and variable specific performance index it was found that the low level performance was attributed to a behavior that is acceptable for an experienced surgeon but not for a naive trainee. It was concluded that relative performance indices should use a reference group that corresponds to the measured individual since the definition of optimal surgery may vary among trainee groups depending on their level of experience.\n\nDiagnosis-Specific Prognostic Factors, Indexes, and Treatment Outcomes for Patients With Newly Diagnosed Brain Metastases: A Multi-Institutional Analysis of 4,259 Patients\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSperduto, Paul W., E-mail: psperduto@mropa.co; Chao, Samuel T.; Sneed, Penny K.\n\n2010-07-01\n\nPurpose: Controversy endures regarding the optimal treatment of patients with brain metastases (BMs). Debate persists, despite many randomized trials, perhaps because BM patients are a heterogeneous population. The purpose of the present study was to identify significant diagnosis-specific prognostic factors and indexes (Diagnosis-Specific Graded Prognostic Assessment [DS-GPA]). Methods and Materials: A retrospective database of 5,067 patients treated for BMs between 1985 and 2007 was generated from 11 institutions. After exclusion of the patients with recurrent BMs or incomplete data, 4,259 patients with newly diagnosed BMs remained eligible for analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses of the prognostic factors and outcomes bymoreÂ Â» primary site and treatment were performed. The significant prognostic factors were determined and used to define the DS-GPA prognostic indexes. The DS-GPA scores were calculated and correlated with the outcomes, stratified by diagnosis and treatment. Results: The significant prognostic factors varied by diagnosis. For non-small-cell lung cancer and small-cell lung cancer, the significant prognostic factors were Karnofsky performance status, age, presence of extracranial metastases, and number of BMs, confirming the original GPA for these diagnoses. For melanoma and renal cell cancer, the significant prognostic factors were Karnofsky performance status and the number of BMs. For breast and gastrointestinal cancer, the only significant prognostic factor was the Karnofsky performance status. Two new DS-GPA indexes were thus designed for breast/gastrointestinal cancer and melanoma/renal cell carcinoma. The median survival by GPA score, diagnosis, and treatment were determined. Conclusion: The prognostic factors for BM patients varied by diagnosis. The original GPA was confirmed for non-small-cell lung cancer and small-cell lung cancer. New DS-GPA indexes were determined for other histologic types and correlated with the outcome\n\nFixing the Academic Performance Index.

A total of 184 of youth soccer players from Malaysia sport school and six soccer academy encompasses as respondence of the study. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were computed to identify the most dominant factors whereas reducing the initial 26 parameters with recommended >0.5 of factor loading. Meanwhile, prediction of the soccer performance was predicted by regression model. CFA revealed that sit and reach, vertical jump, VO2max, age, weight, height, sitting height, calf circumference (cc), medial upper arm circumference (muac), maturation, bicep, triceps, subscapular, suprailiac, 5M, 10M, and 20M speed were the most dominant factors. Further index analysis forming Youth Soccer Performance Index (YSPI) resulting by categorizing three groups namely, high, moderate, and low. The regression model for this study was significant set as p < 0.001 and R2 is 0.8222 which explained that the model contributed a total of 82% prediction ability to predict the whole set of the variables. The significant parameters in contributing prediction of YSPI are discussed. As a conclusion, the precision of the prediction models by integrating a multilateral factor reflecting for predicting potential soccer player and hopefully can create a competitive soccer games.\n\nPerformance Evaluation of Single Sideband Radio over Fiber System through Modulation Index Enhancement\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChen, Xiaogang; Hu, Xizhen; Huang, Dexiu\n\n2014-09-01\n\nThe transmission performance of single sideband (SSB) radio over fiber (RoF) system is evaluated through tuning the modulation index of Mach-Zehnder modulator, two different data modulation schemes and the influence of fiber dispersion are considered. The quantitative simulation results validate that there exist an optimum modulation index, and the system performance could be improved if the data signal is modulated on only optical carrier or sidebands.\n\nIndex-of-refraction-dependent subcellular light scattering observed with organelle-specific dyes.\n\nPubMed\n\nWilson, Jeremy D; Cottrell, William J; Foster, Thomas H\n\n2007-01-01\n\nAngularly resolved light scattering and wavelength-resolved darkfield scattering spectroscopy measurements were performed on intact, control EMT6 cells and cells stained with high-extinction lysosomal- or mitochondrial-localizing dyes. In the presence of the lysosomal-localizing dye NPe6, we observe changes in the details of light scattering from stained and unstained cells, which have both wavelength- and angular-dependent features. Analysis of measurements performed at several wavelengths reveals a reduced scattering cross section near the absorption maximum of the lysosomal-localizing dye. When identical measurements are made with cells loaded with a similar mitochondrial-localizing dye, HPPH, we find no evidence that staining mitochondria had any effect on the light scattering. Changes in the scattering properties of candidate populations of organelles induced by the addition of an absorber are modeled with Mie theory, and we find that any absorber-induced scattering response is very sensitive to the inherent refractive index of the organelle population. Our measurements and modeling are consistent with EMT6-cell-mitochondria having refractive indices close to those reported in the literature for organelles, approximately 1.4. The reduction in scattering cross section induced by NPe6 constrains the refractive index of lysosomes to be significantly higher. We estimate the refractive index of lysosomes in EMT6 cells to be approximately 1.6.\n\nPerformance related specifications for bituminous concrete.\n\nDOT National Transportation Integrated Search\n\n1984-01-01\n\nThis report discusses the philosophy and evolution of performance related specifications.

Weight, height, and tricipital and subscapular skinfolds in 934 adolescents (462 males and 472 females) aged 14-18 years (mean age 16.2; SD=1.0) of the city of FlorianÃ³polis, Southern Brazil, in 2001. Percent fat estimated based on skinfold measurements (> or =25% in males and > or =30% in females) was used as a gold-standard for determining specificity and sensitivity of BMI classification criteria among adolescents. The different cutoff points used for classifying BMI in general resulted in similar prevalence of overweight (p>0.05). Sensitivity of the evaluated criteria was high for males (85.4% to 91.7%) and low for females (33.8 to 52.8%). Specificity of all criteria was high for both sexes (83.6% to 98.8%). Estimates of prevalence of obesity among adolescents using different BMI classification criteria were similar and highly specific for both sexes, but sensitivity for females was low.\n\nThe heat rate index indicator\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLasasso, M.; Runyan, B.; Napoli, J.\n\n1995-06-01\n\nThis paper describes a method of tracking unit performance through the use of a reference number called the Heat Rate Index Indicator. The ABB Power Plant Controls OTIS performance monitor is used to determine when steady load conditions exist and then to collect controllable and equipment loss data which significantly impact thermal efficiency. By comparing these loss parameters to those found during the previous heat balance, it is possible to develop a new adjusted heat rate curve. These impacts on heat rate are used to changes the shape of the tested heat rate curve by the appropriate percentages over amoreÂ Â» specified load range. Mathcad is used to determine the Heat Rate Index by integrating for the areas beneath the adjusted heat rate curve and a heat rate curve that represents the unit`s ideal heat rate curve is the Heat Rate Index. An index of 1.0 indicates that the unit is operating at an ideal efficiency, while an index of less than 1.0 indicates that the unit is operating at less than ideal conditions. A one per cent change in the Heat Rate Index is equivalent to a one percent change in heat rate. The new shape of the adjusted heat rate curve and the individual curves generated from the controllable and equipment loss parameters are useful for determining performance problems in specific load ranges.Â«Â less\n\nAn Introduction to a Head and Neck Cancer-Specific Frailty Index and Its Clinical Implications in Elderly Patients: A Prospective Observational Study Focusing on Respiratory and Swallowing Functions\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKwon, Minsu; Kim, Shin-Ae; Lee, Sang-Wook; Kim, Sung-Bae; Choi, Seung-Ho; Nam, Soon Yuhl; Kim, Sang Yoon\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIntroduction. Frailty refers to a decreased physiologic reserve in geriatric patients and its importance in terms of treatment planning and outcome prediction has been emphasized in oncologic practices for older patients with cancer. We investigated the clinical implications of a head and neck cancer (HNC)-specific frailty index suggested by prospective clinical and functional evaluations of HNC patients. Materials and Methods. We analyzed data on 165 elderly patients with HNC who were prospectively enrolled in our hospital from 2010 to 2013. Pretreatment functional evaluations were performed according to all comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) domains. We additionally evaluated the patientsâ respiratory and swallowing functions using pulmonary function tests, voice handicap index (VHI), MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI), and other associated tests. Factors affecting the 2-year morbidity and mortality were also analyzed. Results. Respiratory and swallowing problems were major causes of 2-year morbidity. Pretreatment performance status, VHI â¥8, MDADI <70, dental problems, and chemotherapy were significantly associated with early morbidity and mortality (all p < .05). CGA-assessed frailty was found in 72 patients (43.6%) and was significantly associated with 2-year mortality (p = .027) but not with morbidity (p = .716). The high-risk group according to our new HNC-specific frailty index that included functional evaluations of respiration and swallowing showed significantly higher 2-year morbidity (p = .043) and mortality (p < .001). Conclusion. Pretreatment functional disabilities related to respiration and swallowing were significantly associated with early morbidity and mortality. The suggested index would be more useful for assessing frailty in elderly HNC patients. Implications for Practice: This study is the first report in terms of suggesting a new frailty index focusing on respiratory and swallowing functions in elderly patients with head and\n\nIs There a Relationship between Body Mass Index, Fitness, and Academic Performance?

The nature of this variability provides important information on the flexibility of control strategies. This feature of control may be affected by low back pain (LPB) and trunk flexion/extension conditions. Goal equivalent manifold (GEM) analysis was used to quantify the ability to exploit motor abundance during repeated trunk flexion/extension in healthy individuals and people with chronic non-specific LBP (CNSLBP). Kinematic data were collected from 22 healthy volunteers and 22 CNSLBP patients during metronomically timed, repeated trunk flexion/extension in three conditions of symmetry, velocity, and loading; each at two levels. A goal function for the task was defined as maintaining a constant movement time at each cycle. Given the GEM, flexibility index and performance index were calculated respectively as amounts of goal-equivalent variability and the ratio of goal-equivalent to non-goal-equivalent variability. CNSLBP group was as similar as healthy individuals in both flexibility index (p=0.41) and performance index (p=0.24). Performance index was higher in asymmetric (p<0.001), high velocity (p<0.001), and loaded (p=0.006) conditions. Performance and flexibility in using motor abundance were influenced by repeated trunk flexion/extension conditions. However, these measures were not significantly affected by CNSLBP.

No single indicator alone, however, is able to provide a stable and complete assessment of performance. The Stata command bibrep.ado is introduced which automatically produces bibliometric reports for single researchers (senior researchers working in the natural or life sciences). The user of the command receives a comprehensive bibliometric report which can be used in research evaluation instead of the h-index.

M.; Manjunath, M.\n\n2012-08-01\n\nH-index, a single number proposed by J. E. Hirsch in 2005 has gained popularity as an index number to measure the research performance of individuals, institutions, universities, etc. There are many calculators to derive the h-in dex number, such as Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, etc. However, h-index can be calculated manually, provided we have access to a complete list of publications of a scientist and the number of citations received by them. It is observed that h-index for a given scientist at a ny given point of time differs from one calculator to the other. Here is an attempt to calculate the H-index of scientists of the Astronomy and Astrophysics Group at Raman Research Institute using Google Scholar Free calculator, Web of Science Paid calculator and The SAO/NASA As trophysics Data System manual calculation and comparison of the results. Application of this h- index phenomenon to the research output of RRI scientists in a group is done while keeping in mi nd Hirsch's systematic in vestigation to predict the position of a scientist using h-index in physics. It is believed that the higher the academic age of a scientist, the higher will be the h-index. An attempt is made to find whether this assumption is true with respect to the sample studied by including the superannuated scientists from Astronomy and Astrophysics Group at Raman Research Institute under the purview of this study.\n\nInvolvement of RNA2-encoded proteins in the specific transmission of Grapevine fanleaf virus by its nematode vector Xiphinema index.\n\nPubMed\n\nBelin, C; Schmitt, C; Demangeat, G; Komar, V; Pinck, L; Fuchs, M\n\n2001-12-05\n\nThe nepovirus Grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV) is specifically transmitted by the nematode Xiphinema index. To identify the RNA2-encoded proteins involved in X. index-mediated spread of GFLV, chimeric RNA2 constructs were engineered by replacing the 2A, 2B(MP), and/or 2C(CP) sequences of GFLV with their counterparts in Arabis mosaic virus (ArMV), a closely related nepovirus which is transmitted by Xiphinema diversicaudatum but not by X. index. Among the recombinant viruses obtained from transcripts of GFLV RNA1 and chimeric RNA2, only those which contained the 2C(CP) gene (504 aa) and 2B(MP) contiguous 9 C-terminal residues of GFLV were transmitted by X. index as efficiently as natural and synthetic wild-type GFLV, regardless of the origin of the 2A and 2B(MP) genes. As expected, ArMV was not transmitted probably because it is not retained by X. index. These results indicate that the determinants responsible for the specific spread of GFLV by X. index are located within the 513 C-terminal residues of the polyprotein encoded by RNA2.

Effects of cold pressor-induced pain on Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition Processing Speed Index (PSI) and Working Memory Index (WMI) performance was examined in nonclinical volunteers (n = 40). All took one PSI subtest and one WMI subtest normally, and then took different PSI and WMI subtests during cold pressor-induced pain or painless warm-water immersion. Scaled scores for normal administration versus pain or painless water immersion did not differ and there was no interaction between group (control vs. pain) and manner of administration, despite moderately severe mean pain ratings (M = 6.8 on a 0-10 pain-rating scale). Results indicate that induced pain in nonclinical volunteers does not impair PSI or WMI performance, and they suggest that chronic pain per se should not be expected to substantially affect these cognitive functions. However, patients with chronic pain may differ from nonclinical volunteers in their experience of pain, potentially limiting generalizability.\n\nDoppler-derived myocardial performance index in patients with impaired left ventricular relaxation and preserved systolic function.\n\nPubMed\n\nFernandes, JosÃ© Maria G; Rivera, Ivan Romero; de Oliveira RomÃ£o, BenÃ­cio; MendonÃ§a, Maria Alayde; Vasconcelos, Miriam Lira Castro; Carvalho, AntÃ´nio Carlos; Campos, Orlando; De Paola, Angelo Amato V; MoisÃ©s, Valdir A\n\n2009-09-01\n\nThe Doppler-derived myocardial performance index (MPI) has been used in the evaluation of left ventricular (LV) function in several diseases. In patients with isolated diastolic dysfunction, the diagnostic utility of this index remains unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic utility of MPI in patients with systemic hypertension, impaired LV relaxation, and normal ejection fraction. Thirty hypertensive patients with impaired LV relaxation were compared to 30 control subjects. MPI and its components, isovolumetric relaxation time (IRT), isovolumetric contraction time (ICT), and the ejection time (ET), were measured from LV outflow and mitral inflow Doppler velocity profiles. MPI was higher in patients than in control subjects (0.45 +/- 0.13 vs 0.37 +/- 0.07 P < 0.0029). The increase in MPI was due to the prolongation of IRT without significant change of ICT and ET. MPI cutoff value of > or =0.40 identified impaired LV relaxation with a sensitivity of 63% and specificity of 70% while an IRT >94 ms had a sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 80%. Multivariate analysis identified relative wall thickness, mitral early filling wave velocity (E), and systolic myocardial velocity (Sm) as independent predictors of MPI in patients with hypertension. MPI was increase in patients with hypertension, diastolic dysfunction, and normal ejection fraction but was not superior to IRT to detect impaired LV relaxation.\n\nEffect of dobutamine on a Doppler echocardiographic index of combined systolic and diastolic performance.\n\nPubMed\n\nHarada, K; Tamura, M; Toyono, M; Yasuoka, K\n\n2002-01-01\n\nDobutamine stress echocardiography has become accepted in the evaluation of cardiac functional reserve. Although the Doppler-derived index of combined systolic/diastolic myocardial performance (Tei index) has been reported to be easily obtainable and useful for predicting left ventricular performance, the effect of dobutamine on the Tei index has not been determined in children. To assess the effect of dobutamine on the Tei index, 8 patients who had undergone surgery for ventricular septal defect and 7 patients who had a history of Kawasaki disease were examined. Echocardiographic recordings were obtained before and after dobutamine infusion (5 microg/kg per minute). Variables measured were transmitral flow velocities (E, A, E/A), rate-corrected mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (rate-corrected Vcf), and IMP. We measured isovolumic contraction time (ICT), isovolumic relaxation time (IRT), and ejection time (ET) and then calculated the Tei index using the following formula: Tei index = (ICT + IRT)/ET. Dobutamine infusion increased rate-corrected Vcf (29%, p < 0.01), peak E (7%, p < 0.05), and peak A (13%, p < 0.05). E/A ratio did not change during dobutamine infusion. ET, ICT, and IRT were found to decrease during dobutamine infusion. The magnitude of the change in the ICT (-21%, p < 0.01) was greater than those in IRT (-12%, p < 0.01) and ET (-8%, p < 0.05). The decrease in Tei index (-16%, p < 0.01) resulted in a decrease in ICT/ET (-21%, p < 0.01) and a slight decrease in IRT/ET (-12%, p < 0.05). The Tei index has potential as a sensitive indicator of the effects of inotropic stimilation on global left ventricular function.\n\nAssessment of transport performance index for urban transport development strategies â Incorporating residents' preferences\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAmbarwati, Lasmini, E-mail: L.Ambarwati@tudelft.nl; Department of Civil Engineering, Brawijaya University; Verhaeghe, Robert, E-mail: R.Verhaeghe@tudelft.nl\n\nThe performance of urban transport depends on a variety of factors related to metropolitan structure; in particular, the patterns of commuting, roads and public transport (PT) systems. To evaluate urban transport planning efforts, there is a need for a metric expressing the aggregate performance of the city's transport systems which should relate to residents' preferences. The existing metrics have typically focused on a measure to express the proximity of job locations to residences. A Transport Performance Index (TPI) is proposed in which the total cost of transportation system (operational and environmental costs) is divided by willingness to pay (WTP) formoreÂ Â» transport plus the willingness to accept (WTA) the environmental effects on residents. Transport operational as well as the environmental costs are derived from a simulation of all transport systems, to particular designs of spatial development. Willingness to pay for transport and willingness to accept the environmental effects are derived from surveys among residents. Simulations were modelled of Surabaya's spatial structure and public transport expansion. The results indicate that the current TPI is high, which will double by 2030. With a hypothetical polycentric city structure and adjusted job housing balance, a lower index occurs because of the improvements in urban transport performance. A low index means that the residents obtain much benefit from the alternative proposed. This illustrates the importance of residents' preferences in urban spatial planning in order to achieve efficient urban transport. Applying the index suggests that city authorities should provide fair and equitable public transport systems for suburban residents in the effort to control the phenomenon of urban sprawl. This index is certainly a good tool and prospective benchmark for measuring sustainability in relation to urban development.Â«Â less\n\nThe NLM Indexing Initiative's Medical Text Indexer.\n\nPubMed\n\nAronson, Alan R; Mork, James G; Gay, Clifford W; Humphrey, Susanne M; Rogers, Willie J\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThe Medical Text Indexer (MTI) is a program for producing MeSH indexing recommendations.

A single-group repeated-measures design. Patients (n = 165) presenting to physical therapy with cervical radiculopathy completed the Neck Disability Index, Patient-Specific Functional Scale, and Numeric Pain Rating Scale at the baseline examination and at a follow-up. At the time of follow-up, all patients also completed the Global Rating of Change, which was used to dichotomize patients as improved or stable. Baseline and follow-up scores were used to determine the test-retest reliability, construct validity, and minimal levels of detectable and clinically important change for the Neck Disability Index, Patient-Specific Functional Scale, and Numeric Pain Rating Scale. Both the Neck Disability Index and Numeric Pain Rating Scale exhibited fair test-retest reliability, whereas the Patient-Specific Functional Scale exhibited poor reliability in patients with cervical radiculopathy. All three outcome measures showed adequate responsiveness in this patient population. The minimal detectable change was 13.4 for the Neck Disability Index, 3.3 for the Patient-Specific Functional Scale, and 4.1 for the Numeric Pain Rating Scale. The threshold for the minimal clinically important difference was 8.5 for the Neck Disability Index and 2.2 for both the Patient-Specific Functional Scale and Numeric Pain Rating Scale. In light of the varied distribution of symptoms in patients with cervical radiculopathy, future studies should investigate the psychometric properties of other neck-related disability measures in this patient population.\n\nLiability of concrete performance-based specification for Georgia DOT projects.\n\nDOT National Transportation Integrated Search\n\n2013-12-01\n\nPerformance-based specifications provide an alternative means of designing concrete to meet : specific performance-related goals.

A refined index of model performance.Â International Journal of Climatology, forthcoming. DOI:10.1002/joc.2419.] recently suggest a refined index of model performance (dr) that they purport to be superior to other methods. Their refined index ranges from â 1.0 to 1.0 to resemble a correlation coefficient, but it is merely a linear rescaling of our modified coefficient of efficiency (E1) over the positive portion of the domain ofÂ dr. We disagree with WillmottÂ et al.Â (2012) thatÂ drÂ provides a better interpretation; rather,Â E1Â is more easily interpreted such that a value ofÂ E1Â = 1.0 indicates a perfect model (no errors) whileÂ E1Â = 0.0 indicates a model that is no better than the baseline comparison (usually the observed mean). Negative values ofÂ E1Â (and, for that matter,Â drÂ < 0.5) indicate a substantially flawed model as they simply describe a âlevel of inefficacyâ for a model that is worse than the comparison baseline. Moreover, whileÂ drÂ is piecewise continuous, it is not continuous through the second and higher derivatives. We explain why the coefficient of efficiency (EÂ orÂ E2) and its modified form (E1) are superior and preferable to many other statistics, includingÂ dr, because of intuitive interpretability and because these indices have a fundamental meaning at zero.We also expand on the discussion begun by GarrickÂ et al.Â [Garrick M, Cunnane C, Nash JE. 1978.

Global myocardial performance index (MPI) is used in assessment of both left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function. We compared MPI in hypothyroidism patients vs. normal control subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS Eighty-two hypothyroid patients were divided into 2 groups: a subclinical hypothyroid (SH) group (n=50), and an overt hypothyroid (OH) group (n=32). The healthy control group (CG) constituted of 37 patients. TSH, FT3, and FT4, anti-TPO, anti-TG, insulin, lipid values, and fasting glucose levels were studied. All patients underwent an echocardiographic examination. Myocardial performance indexes were assessed and standard echocardiographic examinations were investigated. RESULTS MPI averages in OH, SH, and control groups were 0.53Â±0.06, 0.51Â±0.05, and 0.44Â±0.75 mm, respectively. MPI was increased in the OH and SH groups in comparison to CG (p<0.001, p<0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS MPI value was significantly higher in hypothyroid patients in comparison to the control group, showing that regression in global left ventricular functions is an important echocardiographic finding. Future studies are required to determine the effects of this finding on long-term cardiovascular outcomes.\n\nUsing the Detectability Index to Predict P300 Speller Performance\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMainsah, B.O.; Collins, L.M.; Throckmorton, C.S.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nObjective The P300 speller is a popular brain-computer interface (BCI) system that has been investigated as a potential communication alternative for individuals with severe neuromuscular limitations. To achieve acceptable accuracy levels for communication, the system requires repeated data measurements in a given signal condition to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of elicited brain responses. These elicited brain responses, which are used as control signals, are embedded in noisy electroencephalography (EEG) data. The discriminability between target and non-target EEG responses defines a userâs performance with the system. A previous P300 speller model has been proposed to estimate system accuracy given a certain amount of data collection. However, the approach was limited to a static stopping algorithm, i.e. averaging over a fixed number of measurements, and the row-column paradigm. A generalized method that is also applicable to dynamic stopping algorithms and other stimulus paradigms is desirable. Approach We developed a new probabilistic model-based approach to predicting BCI performance, where performance functions can be derived analytically or via Monte Carlo methods.

However, little is known about their performance in Chinese men. Our objective is to test the performance of p2PSA and PHI and their added value to tPSA in discriminating biopsy outcomes in Chinese men. Consecutive patients who underwent prostate biopsy in three tertiary hospitals in Shanghai, China during 2012-2013 were recruited. Serum tPSA, free PSA (fPSA), and p2PSA were measured centrally using Beckman Coulter's DxI 800 Immunoassay System. The primary outcome is PCa and the secondary outcome is high-grade PCa (Gleason Score of 4â+â3 or worse). Discriminative performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), detection rate and Decision Curve Analysis (DCA). Among 636 patients who underwent prostate biopsy, PHI was a significant predictor of biopsy outcomes, independent of other clinical variables. The AUC in discriminating PCa from non-PCa was consistently higher for PHI than tPSA in the entire cohort (0.88 vs. 0.81) as well as in patients with tPSA at 2-10âng/ml (0.73 vs. 0.53), at 10.1-20âng/ml (0.81 vs. 0.58), and at tPSA >20âng/ml (0.90 vs. 0.80). The differences were statistically significant in all comparisons, Pâ<â0.01. To detect 90% of all PCa in the cohort, 362 and 457 patients would need to be biopsied based on PHI and tPSA cutoff, respectively, a 21% reduction for PHI. Similar results were found for discriminating high-grade PCa. PHI provides added value over tPSA in discriminating PCa and high-grade PCa in patients who underwent prostate biopsy in China.

A zone-specific fish-based multimetric estuarine index of biotic integrity (Z-EBI) was developed based on a 13 year time series of fish surveys from the Zeeschelde estuary (Belgium). Sites were pre-classified using indicators of anthropogenic impact. Metrics showing a monotone response with pressure classes were selected for further analysis. Thresholds for the good ecological potential (GEP) were defined from references. A modified trisection was applied for the other thresholds. The Z-EBI is defined by the average of the metric scores calculated over a one year period and translated into an ecological quality ratio (EQR). The indices integrate structural and functional qualities of the estuarine fish communities. The Z-EBI performances were successfully validated for habitat degradation in the various habitat zones.
