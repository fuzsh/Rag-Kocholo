Its historical importance cannot be overstated. Along with the Statue of Liberty, with which it now shares national monument status, Ellis Island is the most significant symbol of the opportunities that awaited immigrants arriving on U.S. shores. That Ellis Island has merited this encyclopedic treatment further demonstrates its enduring significance to U.S. history. Approximately 12 million immigrants, mostly Europeans, were processed on the island from 1892 through 1954. Their cultural contributions are celebrated as part of the American Dream. Their children and grandchildren became part of the American middle class. Today, perhaps 25 percent of Americans have an ancestor who was processed at Ellis Island. After extensive restoration, Ellis Island has a new purpose: it is the premier historical museum for immigration and genealogical research in this country and is a major tourist attraction and student group destination in New York. Many reference books have been written about immigration in general, but this encyclopedia is the first reference book devoted to the subject of Ellis Island. General topics in this volume include children, languages and dialects, literature, wars, and women, along with specific laws, policies and procedures, notables and staff, organizations, buildings and rooms, and the various incarnations of its use until the founding of the current museum. The need for this volume was dictated by the lack of well-organized and easily accessible publications that simplify the search for general knowledge of the island’s history. The purpose of this encyclopedia is to remedy that situation. Nonetheless, this volume is limited in its coverage simply because of the vastness of the story. The basic history is covered here with the emphasis on Ellis Island as an immigrant station from 1892 through 1954. The criterion for entry selection was overall significance to the history of the island. Thus, for example, federal agencies, commissioners, various people, divisions, and diseases were all determined as vital to readers and researchers. Whenever possible, the entries have been named as they were known at Ellis Island. Hence, the entry on immigration inspectors is called “immigrant inspectors” because that was the term used on Ellis Island. The following brief, historical overview of the island will help put the contents of this encyclopedia in perspective.\n\nTHE EARLY HISTORY OF ELLIS ISLAND (1620–1890) When the Dutch arrived, Ellis Island formed part of the domain of the Lenni Lenape Indians, who fished and gathered oysters from its shores. They called the sandbar Kioshk—Gull Island— for it was inhabited by many of these seafaring birds. In the 1630s, Michael Paauw purchased the dreary isle from the tribe for “certain cargoes or parcels of goods.” During these early years, the Dutch found the oyster beds rich and profitable,\n\nxii\n\nIntroduction\n\nand the island came to be known as Little Oyster Island. The three-and-a-half-acre sandbar, however, attracted no settlers. In 1674, shortly after English colonial rule was made permanent by the Treaty of Westminster (ending the Third Anglo-Dutch War), the English governor, Sir Edmund Andros, granted Little Oyster Island to Captain William Dyre. In 1686, Dyre and his wife Mary sold the island to Thomas and Patience Lloyd. After Lloyd’s death about a decade later, the isle passed into other hands. A clue to one of the owners, perhaps, lies in the name the island bore around 1730—Bucking Island. In 1765, the execution of a pirate called Anderson gave the island two additional names—Anderson’s Island and Gibbet Island. It is believed that merchant and farmer Samuel Ellis acquired the island in 1774. One can safely assume that he was the proprietor by November 1778 when this notice was published: Boat found adrift. The owner to apply to Garret Wouters at Mr. Ellis’s Island.1 Ellis also attempted to sell the island around that time through an advertisement in Loudon’s New-York Packet: TO BE SOLD By Samuel Ellis, no. 1, Greenwich Street, at the north river near the Bear Market, That pleasant situated Island called Oyster Island, lying in New York Bay, near Powle’s Hook, together with all its improvements which are considerable; also, two lots of ground, one at the lower end of Queen street, joining Luke’s wharf, the other in Greenwich street, between Petition and Dey streets, and a parcel of spars for masts, yards, brooms, bowsprits, & c. and a parcel of timber fit for pumps and buildings of docks; and a few barrels of excellent shad and herrings, and others of an inferior quality fit for shipping; and a few thousand of red herring of his own curing, that he will warrant to keep good in carrying to any part of the world, and a quantity of twine which he sell very low, which is the best sort of twine, for tyke nets. Also a large Pleasure Sleigh, almost new.2 After Ellis’s death in 1794, the island was left to his heirs to fight over until an agreement to sell it to the state of New York for $10,000 was finally reached in 1808. The state, in turn, sold it to the federal government for the same sum. The Army Corps of Engineers erected a land battery on the island that was completed before the outbreak of the War of 1812. The federal government had been interested in using Ellis Island for military purposes as early as 1794. By 1798, the military earthworks had been carried out on Ellis Island and it was used as a “rendezvous for the recruits of Artillerists & Engineers of the United States Army.”3 After 1800, attention to military security in the harbor waned—this remained the case until 1807. Later that year, Colonel Jonathan Williams completed a survey of the harbor and reported the strategic value of Governor’s Island, Ellis Island, and the tip of lower Manhattan. It was thanks to his report that the purchase of Ellis Island was effected in the next year. During the War of 1812, Ellis Island and neighboring Bedloe’s Island served as quarters for British soldiers captured as prisoners of war. In 1814, the fort on the island was named Fort Gibson in honor of Colonel James Gibson, who was killed by the British while fighting in Ohio. In 1831, the abandoned island was the scene of the hanging of two pirates, George Gibbs and Thomas Wansley; the latter was an African American. Their bodies were sent to the College of Surgeons and Physicians for dissection. In 1839, another pirate, Cornelius Wilhelms of the ship Braganza, was hanged at Ellis Island.\n\nIntroduction\n\nxiii\n\nThroughout the period the army and navy shared the island. In 1861, the army dismantled Fort Gibson, known as Battery Gibson. The navy continued using Ellis Island to store munitions. In April 1890, complaints about the danger the naval magazines posed to the metropolitan area forced Congress to end Ellis Island’s long association with the military. Congress now designated the island to be the site of the nation’s first federal immigrant inspection station. A process of enlarging the island from its original three and a half acres through landfilling was carried out whenever new buildings were required. The first immigrant station existed from 1892 through 1897; its wooden buildings were destroyed in a fire in the summer of 1897. Built primarily of steel, bricks, and limestone, the second immigrant station was fireproof. It opened in 1900 and remained in operation until the station was closed in 1954.\n\nELLIS ISLAND AS AN IMMIGRANT STATION (1892–1954) When Ellis Island opened, it quickly became the center of mass migration to the New World from 1892 to 1924. At least 12 million foreigners were processed at the facility. The unpleasantness many persons encountered there was summed up in the immigrants’ nickname for it: isola della lacrime, Tränen Insel (island of tears). After passing New York quarantine inspection, the steamships from Europe and other parts of the world slowly entered New York harbor. Here they were met by a cutter from Ellis Island bearing officials from the Immigration Bureau’s Boarding Division. These officials included one or two immigrant inspectors, assisted by clerks and interpreters; there was always a doctor or two, and sometimes a matron as well. When meeting a ship’s officers, the inspectors ascertained all possible vital information about the passengers, including details about sick passengers and tips about suspicious ones. The boarding inspectors were given a handwritten copy of the ship’s passenger list that had been prepared in advance by the steamship’s purser and his assistants. Meanwhile, inspectors and clerks with the aid of the doctors checked first-class passengers with all decorum and courtesy; second-class passengers underwent the same processing with a little more suspicion and a little less decorum. Most of these travelers, especially those in first class, were businessmen, world travelers, distinguished persons, or entertainers. Only in second class were potential “immigrants” spotted. Immigration officials often encountered “suspicious persons” traveling in second class whom they detained and brought to Ellis Island for questioning and investigation. These often included women traveling alone or any person who was reported to them as behaving strangely or giving trouble during the voyage. Steamships sailed slowly to their docks in Manhattan, Brooklyn, or Hoboken, where first- and second-class passengers who had passed immigration inspection aboard ship were now free to undergo customs and disembark. Third-class or steerage passengers, along with any first- or second-class detainees and possible stowaways, were prepared for transfer to Ellis Island for full inspection. Each received a large slip of paper—a tag—that was affixed to their coats or shirts and had to be worn in view at all times. The tag, often color-coded to indicate the steamship line, was inscribed with a manifest number of the passenger, the name of the steamship, and the immigrant’s name. It was an easy, serviceable way of identifying and controlling a large crowd of people. When everything was ready, the large crowds of aliens, often exceeding 2,000 persons, were borne over to Ellis Island on small barges and ferries. The boarding division officials were able to achieve this with the aid of steamship employees.\n\nxiv\n\nIntroduction\n\nThough many immigrants kept their personal belongings with them, others entrusted unwieldy trunks, cases, baskets, and boxes to the baggage master’s men. In good weather, baggage workers could deposit large quantities of the immigrants’ personal belongings near the entrance of the main building, and in bad weather they could be taken to the baggage master’s office. As the weary yet excited immigrants disembarked at Ellis Island, officials known as groupers shouted to them to form two lines, women and children in one and men in the other. This kind of discipline and order, often confusing or unnerving to immigrants, underscored the advanced crowd control technique that had been developed as a matter of necessity at the world’s busiest immigration station. An Italian immigrant named Francesco Martoccia came to the United States in the early 1890s and in due time became a U.S. citizen. Around the year 1900, he began what was to be a lifelong career in the Immigration Bureau at Ellis Island, where he worked as an interpreter and then as an immigrant inspector. Many years later, he reminisced about the peak years of mass immigration at Ellis Island: I can well remember, for at that time I was in the registry department, assigned to decide the eligibility of aliens to land. To make things run fairly smoothly in that mixed crowd of poor, bewildered immigrants. . . . Here in the main building, they were lined up: a motley crowd in colorful costumes, all ill at ease and wondering what was to happen to them.4\n\nLine Inspection With the question of luggage at least temporarily settled, the doctors who worked for the U.S. Public Health Service could now begin the medical examination procedure famously known as line inspection. In good weather, some of the line inspection took place outside under the canopy. This procedure was an important step toward discovering an immigrant’s state of health. Posted near the entrance of the line, the first two doctors had a special technique to quickly identify signs of poor health. This was rather amusingly called the “six-second physical.” Standing at a vantage point where the line of immigrants made a sharp turn, the doctor could observe an immigrant from three angles: front, profile, and rear. This gave the doctor the advantage of scrutinizing the immigrant’s gait, posture, and mannerisms. In an instant, the doctor took in each immigrant’s face, skin, hair, neck, hands, and fingers for any signs of disease or deformity. Blemishes, discoloration, and rashes of the skin, nervous twitches, an unusually pale or a flushed complexion, or sweating: any of these might give away the presence of disease or failing health. He watched for difficulty in breathing, coughing, or signs of feebleness. Next came an examination of the scalp and neck for signs of diseases such as favus or goiter or for common conditions such as hair lice. The doctor also tried to detect signs of mental instability, lunacy, or retardation. Sometimes a doctor would startle an immigrant by asking a few questions. The immigrant’s reaction gave the doctor an inkling of the person’s mental state. The second set of doctors was posted halfway along the line. Known as an “eyeman,” the physician’s sole duty was to examine the immigrants’ eyes carefully and watch for any visual impairment or sign of disease. Immigrants dreaded this man particularly because he always examined underneath the eyelid, a quick but slightly painful operation. This was done with the aid of a constantly cleaned and disinfected buttonhook. He looked under a person’s eyelid for the telltale scabs of trachoma, a highly contagious disease that often leads to blindness. He also looked for signs of other eye diseases such as conjunctivitis or cataract.\n\nIntroduction\n\nxv\n\nMedical Detention and Hospitalization Most people passed this medical scrutiny with no difficulty, for some, however, it was quite a different matter: their health seemed questionable. The doctors, using letters of the alphabet, created a code to indicate suspected health problems. Using a piece of chalk, a doctor wrote a letter or two on an alien’s coat, shirt, or blouse. Some of the letters used, along with what they meant, included the following: B was for back, Ct for trachoma, E for eyes, F for face, H for heart, K for hernia, L for legs, Pg for pregnant, S for senile, X suspected mental problems or insanity. This also identified those who had to undergo full medical scrutiny in the examining rooms. At the completion of a full examination, a medical certificate was issued and co-signed by three doctors. Messengers and immigrants then took the certificates to the Registry Room (also known as the Great Hall) and handed them over to the responsible clerk on the floor. These documents were kept in readiness to help the inspector make a decision to admit or reject the alien when it was time for the interrogation. Immigrants found to be very sick or dangerously ill were hospitalized at once. Only after receiving medical care would they be sent on to undergo the immigration inspection in the Registry Room. Primary Inspection In spite of its importance, the medical examination was not the centerpiece of the Ellis Island experience; the doctors—known as medical officers and surgeons—merely supplied medical facts enabling the immigrant inspectors in the Registry Room to make informed decisions in landing, detaining, or excluding an alien with health problems. The inspectors were officers of the U.S. Bureau of Immigration, which supervised all affairs at Ellis Island. To undergo immigrant inspection, aliens were herded up the staircase to the Registry Room, grouped according to the ship they had sailed on and their manifest number. They were then directed to one of the inspection lines to slowly wait their turn at the front of the line. Federal law required the immigrant inspector to exclude aliens suffering from any loathsome or dangerous contagious disease and all “morons, idiots, and lunatics.” Others excluded were convicted criminals, dangerous radicals and anarchists, polygamists, prostitutes, and those guilty of moral turpitude. He used all the evidence available before making a decision: this might include the evidence of the freshly written medical certificate, a testimonial of good character, or a warning telegram from a foreign police force. There was also a restriction barring all persons “liable to become a public charge,” a sweeping category that counted among its number vagabonds, professional beggars, unescorted women and girls, underage boys, and physically feeble persons, such as some elderly persons with no relatives or friends to take care of them. With these considerations in view, the inspector, sitting at a high desk at the front of the line, typically asked twenty-nine questions such as: What is your name? Age? Occupation or calling? Race? Country of origin? Do you understand English? Speak it? Read it? Write it? What is the name and address of your next of kin abroad? Ever been to the U.S. before? What is your destination? By whom was your fare paid? Are you a contract laborer? Polygamist? Anarchist? Convicted of any misdemeanor? Height? Color of skin? Eyes? Hair? Eighty percent of the immigrants passed both the immigrant inspection and the medical examinations and were released to the ground floor to wait for a ferry to transport them to Manhattan or the Jersey City railway terminal. Of the 20 percent who were not immediately accepted, half went to the hospital for medical treatment and the other half were detained for legal reasons. Most detainees had no more than an overnight stay, while some had to wait for money to be cabled to them; for husbands, fathers, or guardians to pick them up; or for information such as the\n\nxvi\n\nIntroduction\n\nconfirmation of an address before journeying to some far-off place in America. Immigrants who aroused suspicion, however, had to face more scrutiny, which could keep them at the island for weeks and lead to a long hearing before a board of special inquiry. Detention and Exclusion The immigrants detained on Ellis Island were typically fretful, unhappy, frustrated, or hostile. An incident at the station early on showed the disfavor directed at Italians. In the spring of 1896, inspectors freely detained and excluded large numbers of Italians, mostly penniless workingmen from the mezzogiorno (southern Italy), on the ground that they were paupers. This caused crowding in the detention quarters. To remedy this, officials had a temporary detention pen erected outside of the building. When 531 Italian aliens newly arrived on the steamers Alesia and Bolivia were ordered excluded and joined the throng in the pen, things began to turn nasty. Here is historian Thomas Pitkin’s description of the incident: One afternoon a crowd of them rushed the fence and began tearing off the pickets. The guards succeeded in beating them back with considerable difficulty. Senner [the commissioner], fearing more trouble, telegraphed Washington asking permission to employ armed constables on the island . . . the Washington office [then] appealed to the navy for protection at Ellis Island.5 Commissioner Joseph Senner received a promise that marines at the Brooklyn navy yard would be available to assist him, however, things began to simmered down on the hot little island. A reporter from the New York Tribune came over to have a look at the Italians. Surveying them with a cold eye he declared them A forlorn looking group, restless, depressed, degraded and penniless . . . it is pitiable indeed to watch their longing looks, hoping against hope as they do, for freedom. The most sympathetic, however, could but exclaim, as they look upon the groups, ‘we don’t want them; send them back!’6 Detention and Immigrant Aid Help came in many forms at Ellis Island. A kindly matron or a nurse or an interpreter or a messenger—anyone who looked like a fellow countryman (or even looked sympathetic)—might find himself buttonholed by a desperate immigrant anxious for someone to understand his problems and come to his aid or at least tell him what was going on. Detainees waited hours, days, and sometimes weeks before receiving a decision on whether they could stay in America. Men and women were assigned to separate quarters; the children remained with their mothers. These conditions made the work of missionaries, volunteers, and social workers especially welcome. Missionaries and port workers were permanently posted to Ellis Island, representing such groups as the YWCA, the Polish Society, the Methodist Church, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, the National Council of Jewish Women, the Dutch Reformed Church, the Belgian Bureau, the German and Scandinavian Lutheran Churches, the Episcopal Church, and the Salvation Army. The island’s most beloved Roman Catholic priests, Anthony Grogan (Irish) and Gaspare Moretti (Italian), were busy providing spiritual guidance every day—hearing confessions and singing mass. They also assisted immigrants in mundane affairs like getting sponsors or money and sometimes they wrote or read letters.\n\nIntroduction\n\nxvii\n\nThese and other missionaries and immigrant aid workers had their hands full with detainees and deportees who often did not understand U.S. regulations and were puzzled as to why they were detained. Others, especially the deportees, were usually better informed, since they had already lived in the United States for a while (from months to several years). They ended up at Ellis Island for deportation because they had violated the immigration laws of the country. Typical violations leading to arrest and deportation included illegal entry into the United States (usually by crossing the Canadian border without being inspected), committing a crime or moral offence, or becoming a public charge or vagrant. Detainees Relax Dull days in detention were made more bearable by special events such as concerts, religious services, and other activities. In 1909, the Austrian Society arranged a concert by soprano Madame Ernestine Schumann-Heink, and seven years later, the Italian Welfare Society sponsored a concert performed by famed opera star Enrico Caruso. Silent films were screened regularly; detainees could enjoy some of America’s most popular screen stars: Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin, Gloria Swanson, and William S. Hart. Immigrants also entertained themselves, the men played card games and soccer, while women sewed and kept an eye on their children. Christmas was a grand occasion at Ellis Island. Christian immigrants entering the Great Hall for the Christmas celebration saw an enormous Christmas tree with lovely ornaments, including a magnificent star on the topmost branch. They received presents such as apples, oranges, towels, and soap. In addition, men received shaving kits, ties, and tobacco, while the women received sewing materials and aprons. Boys received games and small toys, while girls were presented with dolls. Jewish immigrants celebrated Passover, Yom Kippur, Sukkoth, and other holidays. Beginning in 1911, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society and the U.S. Bureau of Immigration maintained a kosher kitchen at Ellis Island that was supervised by a rabbi. These conditions made the dreary, uncertain days in detention somewhat less unpleasant. In the end, most detainees were approved to enter the country. To the Immigrant Train Most immigrants leaving Ellis Island were ferried to the railroad terminals in nearby Jersey City or Hoboken. There, steerage passengers were taken to the immigrant waiting room to wait for the special immigrant train that usually departed around 9:00 p.m. Their destinations might be as close as Trenton, Philadelphia, or Scranton, or as far away as the West Coast. Weary after a long sea voyage and their experience at Ellis Island, the sleepy immigrants found themselves spending the night in dirty, crowded coaches. The travelers were usually full of cheer and hope and, regardless of nationality, were willing to help each other. Mistakes in destination, in which the names of American states, towns, and streets were spelled using the phonetics of foreign languages, caused problems for train conductors. Thus the Wabash Railroad was sometimes written as “Vabassa,” Jersey City as “Gersisi,” and Brooklyn as “Bruccolino.” This led to confusion, delays, and misdirection. Another problem arose when an immigrant gave the name of a relative or friend only to find, through the help of an immigrant aid society, that no such person existed; if the immigrant was lucky, he might learn that the relative or friend had changed his name. The Chicago Railway Station A major hub of railway transportation was Chicago, both as a destination and as a place to change trains. Immigrants found the depot of the Northwestern Railway Company remarkably\n\nxviii\n\nIntroduction\n\nwell prepared to receive them. In 1912, the special immigrant waiting room was well ventilated and furnished with four large sofas, as well as numerous chairs and writing tables. The bathing and washing facilities for women and men were furnished with bathtubs and porcelain washing tubs. The nearby lunchroom provided hot tea and coffee with rolls for ten cents, while a complete meal could be had for thirty cents.\n\nTHE LATER YEARS AT ELLIS ISLAND Southern and Eastern European immigration dropped sharply after the passage of the restrictive Immigration acts of 1921 and 1924 (laws that effectively halted the mass migration of these immigrants). The Kingdom of Italy, which had previously sent hundreds of thousands of immigrants each year, received a meager quota of 42,057 per annum under the 1921 law and, as if this were not enough of a blow, the regulation granted only 3,845 per year under the 1924 law. In addition, the Italian-speaking micronation of San Marino was given 100 per year. These immigrants, who were indistinguishable from Italians, followed the pattern of their resourceful cousins and settled in industrial cities like New York and Chicago. After this period, immigration through Ellis Island fell off drastically. Aside from the restrictive quotas, a new immigration policy provided for processing immigrants at American consulates in the country of origin, as well as permanently requiring the use of passports and visas, which had only been introduced on a selective basis at U.S. immigration stations after 1919. Over the next decades, Ellis Island was largely used for the detention and deportation of aliens. In the 1920s, the phenomenon of undocumented aliens began at Ellis Island, where thousands of such persons without passports were held and interrogated before their deportations. In the decades that followed, this policy hardened and became a common situation at Ellis Island. World War II brought a new crisis to Ellis Island: the arrival and interrogations of thousands of alien enemies arrested by the FBI. The alien enemies held at Ellis Island numbered in the low thousands and consisted of Germans, Italians, Japanese, as well as a few fascist Romanians and Hungarians. With the end of World War II, a rift between the Soviet Union and the United States and Western Europe brought about the Cold War. Thousands of aliens suspected of being communists were detained at Ellis Island. By the time Ellis Island was closed by the Immigration and Naturalization Service on November 12, 1954, its varied and sometimes controversial service to the nation was fully recognized. The Ellis Island Restoration Project After its closing, the station and its many buildings were left to decay. From 1956 to 1961, the General Services Administration made several unsuccessful attempts to sell the island to private investors. In 1965, responding to efforts by congressmen led by Senator Edmund S. Muskie, President Lyndon B. Johnson proclaimed Ellis Island a part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument and transferred it to the care of the National Park Service. But Congress provided no funds to care for the buildings, which were now in ruins. In addition, the National Park Service showed little interest in preserving the structures. It was not until the 1970s that the importance of the historic buildings as a public monument became clearer. This was largely due to the efforts of Peter Sammartino, chairman of the Restore Ellis Island Committee. His cleanup campaign attracted public attention and the island was opened to visitors in 1976. From that year through 1984, 545,000 people visited Ellis Island and were moved by the power of the old ruin.\n\nIntroduction\n\nxix\n\nIn the 1980s, a determined rehabilitation effort was at last launched. President Ronald Reagan was the force behind it and his plans to raise money though public donations were carried out with extraordinary success by Chrysler Chairman Lee A. Iacocca, who served as chairman of the Statue of Liberty–Ellis Island Foundation. The success of the fund-raising campaign and the restoration of the main building led to its dedication as the Ellis Island Immigration Museum in 1990. Further steps to rehabilitate the remaining buildings on the island were begun in the 1990s and continue today.\n\nHOW TO USE THE ENCYCLOPEDIA The various lists of entry terms in the book’s front matter will help readers identify the contents quickly. The index is key and should be used to locate the desired information. In addition, the A to Z enties have been cross-referenced through boldface type throughout the text. Convenient references have been included with many entries. There is also a separate selected bibliography. Three appendixes provide longer primary documents on the operation and rules of the immigration station as well as a personnel report.\n\nNOTES 1.

The English called the Lenni Lenape Delaware Indians.\n\nincludes Dyre’s Island as a part of the city to be now officially known as Bucking Island.\n\n1620s The Dutch found the colony of New Netherland and the city of New Amsterdam.\n\n1765 The notorious pirate Anderson is hanged on the island; other pirate hangings follow. This gives the isle new names, of which Anderson’s Island and Gibbet Island are the most enduring.\n\n1630 The Dutch West India Company, which owns the colony, buys the Oyster Islands from the Lenni Lenape. The first individual proprietor is Michael Paauw. 1664 England conquers New Netherland and renames it New York in honor of Prince James, the duke of York. August 1673 The Dutch navy conquers New York and renames it New Orange in honor of the Dutch Royal Family. February 1674 In the Treaty of Westminster, England regains New York and the Netherlands is given Surinam in South America. 1674–1679 Sir Edmund Andros, the English colonial governor of New York, grants Little Oyster Island to Captain William Dyre, the collector of customs. Dyre later served as mayor of New York from 1680 to 1682. April 23, 1686 Captain Dyre sells the isle, now called Dyre’s Island, to Thomas and Patience Lloyd. October 1, 1691 The New York colonial legislature passes an act that includes a confirmation that the three oyster islands are within the boundaries of New York County. 1730 Governor John Montgomerie of New York grants a charter to New York City that\n\n1757 New York City officials consider Bucking Island for use as the site of a pest house (i.e., quarantine station).\n\nNovember 18, 1774 Samuel Ellis, merchant, of 1 Greenwich Street, Manhattan, New York, buys the island. January 20, 1785 Samuel Ellis offers the island for sale in Loudon’s New-York Packet, a local newspaper printed by Samuel Loudon. 1794 Samuel Ellis dies. In his will he bequeaths the island to his daughter Catherine’s unborn child with the proviso that the child must be a boy and must be named “Samuel Ellis.” His daughter dutifully bears a son and names him after her father but the child dies in infancy. Meanwhile, New York City grants the deed of Ellis Island to the State of New York for the purposes of constructing a fortification. Charles Vincent, a French engineer, builds the first military earthworks on the island. 1798 Ebenezer Stevens, working for the U.S. War Department, supervises further fortification work on “Ellis’s Island.” Observing that the island is still privately held by the Ellis family, he recommends that it be purchased by New York State and ceded to the U.S. government.\n\nxxii\n\nChronology\n\nFebruary 15, 1800 The State of New York passes an act ceding the jurisdiction of Governor’s Island, Bedloe’s Island, and Ellis Island to the U.S. government. 1806 One of Samuel Ellis’s grandsons, Samuel Ellis Ryerson, deeds Ellis Island to John A. Berry in a questionable sale. June 30, 1808 New York State gains control of Ellis Island through condemnation proceedings carried out by Governor Daniel D. Tompkins. The Ellis family is paid $10,000 for Ellis Island and the state immediately transfers the jurisdiction of the island to the U.S. government. 1811 Colonel Jonathan Williams, U.S. Corps of Army Engineers, finishes construction of the land battery at Ellis Island for defense of the harbor. 1812 A magazine and barracks are completed on Ellis Island and a small garrison of troops is stationed there. This work is done in time for the War of 1812. 1814 Governor Daniel D. Tompkins assumes command of the battery at Ellis Island and promptly names it Fort Gibson in honor of Colonel James Gibson, who was fatally wounded by the British in the Battle of Fort Erie.\n\n1835 The U.S. Navy takes over the abandoned fortifications on Ellis Island and establishes a powder magazine. June 22, 1839 Convicted pirate and murderer Cornelius Wilhelms is hanged on Ellis Island. 1841 The army regains jurisdiction of Ellis Island but the navy is permitted to continue operating its powder magazine. 1843 The army rearms Fort Gibson. 1847 The War Department rejects a request by the New York State emigration commissioners to use Ellis Island as the site of a convalescent home for immigrants. 1865–1866 The army dismantles Battery Gibson and withdraws from Ellis Island. 1868 The New York City publication Harper’s Weekly warns that the navy’s powder magazine at Ellis Island poses a danger to New York City. 1876 The New York Sun publishes an alarming exposé about the navy’s explosives at Ellis Island. 1889 New stories about the Ellis Island explosives appear in the New York World and Jersey City newspapers.\n\n1833 The commissioners of New York and New Jersey meet in Manhattan and sign the Interstate Compact to resolve a boundary dispute over the Oyster Islands, New York harbor, and the Hudson River.\n\n1890 Congress passes a joint resolution ordering the removal of the navy’s powder magazine from Ellis Island. An amendment is attached appropriating $75,000 to enable the secretary of the treasury to improve the island and construct a federal immigrant station there. President Harrison signed the resolution into law on April 11. By May 24, the powder and personnel have completed their move to Fort Wadsworth on Staten Island.\n\n1834 The Interstate Compact is ratified by the two states’ legislatures and approved by an act of Congress. Among its provisions is the agreement that Ellis and Bedloe’s Islands remain a part of New York, but the submerged lands surrounding them belong to New Jersey.\n\n1891 Congress passes an immigration act creating the Office of the Superintendent of Immigration within the Department of the Treasury, taking effect on July 12. The Office of Immigration is authorized to control immigration at all ports at which foreigners entered\n\n1823 Fort Gibson is abandoned. April 1831 Two pirates are executed on Ellis Island.\n\nChronology the country. Colonel John B. Weber of Buffalo, New York, is appointed as commissioner of the Port of New York, with headquarters to be at Ellis Island. Meanwhile, the island has been slightly enlarged by landfill, and immigration buildings are being constructed there. January 1, 1892 Colonel Weber opens Ellis Island and welcomes the first immigrant, Annie Moore of Ireland. By the end of the year, more than 400,000 immigrants have been processed at the station. 1893 Colonel Weber improves administrative procedures by requiring all steamship companies to add new questions to their manifests. President Grover Cleveland appoints Joseph Senner to succeed Weber as commissioner. 1895 The name Office of Immigration is changed to Bureau of Immigration. 1897 On the morning of June 15, the wooden buildings on Ellis Island are destroyed by fire. Immigrants and staff are evacuated and Senner transfers the processing of aliens to the aboard steamships and at piers. The Barge Office in Manhattan becomes the temporary headquarters for the Immigration Bureau and detained aliens. President William McKinley appoints Thomas Fitchie to succeed Senner as commissioner. 1898 William Boring and Edward Tilton, New York City architects, win the contract to create the new fireproof immigrant station at the island. December 17, 1900 Ellis Island reopens; 2,251 immigrants are examined. 1901 The powerhouse and the kitchen and laundry building are constructed on Island 1. 1901–1902 Scandals and corruption under Commissioner Fitchie forces President Theodore Roosevelt to launch an investigation on Ellis Island. 1902 President Roosevelt forces Fitchie to resign and appoints William Williams in his\n\nxxiii\n\nstead. Commissioner Williams institutes major reforms and improves the treatment of immigrants. The hospital and laundry are built on Island 2. September 16, 1903 President Roosevelt visits Ellis Island. 1904 The rear of the Main Building is extended by the addition of a railroad ticket office. Williams welcomes the new ferryboat Ellis Island. 1905 William Williams resigns in a dispute and President Roosevelt appoints Robert Watchorn as the new commissioner. 1907 More than 1 million aliens pass through Ellis Island, making it the peak immigration year at the station. 1909 President William Howard Taft reappoints William Williams as commissioner. Contagious disease wards are completed on Island 3. 1910 President Taft visits Ellis Island. 1911 A dynamite blast in the harbor causes some minor damage at Ellis Island. 1913 President-elect Woodrow Wilson visits Ellis Island. 1914 President Wilson appoints Frederic Howe commissioner. World War I begins in Europe, causing a sharp decline in immigration over the next four years. 1916 German saboteurs destroy a munitions depot at Black Tom Island, Jersey City, New Jersey. The tremendous explosion shatters the windows at Ellis Island. Island evacuated; no injuries. 1917 The United States declares war on Germany and its allies.

Along with the bureaucratic red tape for which Ellis Island is duly famous, a system of abbreviations was used there over the years. Here are a few examples associated with the immigrant inspectors and clerks: A/R, no passport; CIV, consular immigrant visa; Crimson, convicted before entry into U.S. of moral turpitude; Do, ditto; EWI, entered without visa; IV, immigrant visa; LPC, liable to become a public charge; NoV, no visa; Rem Lon, remained too long; SI, special inquiry; Safekeeping, detained for personal safety or to prevent from getting away; Transit, bound for another country and only passing through; Vol. Dep., voluntary departure. See also Chalk Mark Code Adamic, Louis (b. Blato [Slovenia], AustriaHungary, March 23, 1899; d. Milford, New Jersey, September 4, 1951). Louis Adamic arrived at Ellis Island on December 30, 1913, as a steerage passenger on the SS Niagara, a steamship of the French line. The following is a personal description of his experiences as a newly arrived immigrant at Ellis Island, which he wrote nineteen years later, in 1932. Now and then I glanced at the noisy, picturesque, garlicky crowd on the steerage deck; people of perhaps a dozen nationalities milling around the capstans and steam-hissing winches, pushing toward the rails straining and stretching, catching a glimpse of the new country, of the city; lifting their children, even their infants, to give them a view of the Statue of Liberty; women weeping for joy, men falling on their knees in thanksgiving, and children screaming, wailing, dancing. We docked somewhere in the East River, and I began to hear the distant rumble of the city’s traffic.\n\nNear by, too, I saw the great span of the Brooklyn Bridge. It looked huge and superb against the clear winter sky, with vessels passing under it. Steel! There was steel all about. I had written Stefan [“Steve”] Radin, brother of my late friend Yanko, whose address in Brooklyn I happened to have, that I was due in New York on December 30, and would he meet me at Ellis Island, which Peter Molek had told me was the clearinghouse for immigrants? In my letter I explained that I had witnessed the killing of his brother and had, as a result of my participation in the demonstration with Yanko, been imprisoned and expelled from school. From the ship we were transferred on a lighter to Ellis Island, where I received a telegram from Steve that he was coming for me the next afternoon, when he had learned from the immigration authorities I was to be released, assuming I was found admissible. The day I spent on Ellis Island was an eternity. Rumors were current among immigrants of several nationalities that some of us would be refused admittance into the United States and sent back to Europe. For several hours I was in a cold seat on this account, although, so far as I knew, all my papers were in order and sewed away in the lining of my jacket were twenty-five dollars in American currency— the minimum amount required by law to be in the possession of every immigrant before entering the country. Then, having realized away some of these fears, I gradually worked up a panicky feeling that I might develop measles or smallpox, or some other such disease. I had heard that several hundred sick immigrants were quarantined on the island. The first night in America I spent with hundreds of other recently arrived immigrants in an immense hall with tiers of narrow iron-and-canvas bunks, four deep. I was assigned to top bunk. Unlike most of the steerage immigrants I had no bedding with me and, the blanket which someone threw at me, was too thin to be effective against the blasts of cold air that rushed through the open windows; so that I shivered, sleepless all night, listening to snores and dreammonologues in perhaps a dozen different languages.\n\n2\n\nAfrican Americans\n\nThe bunk immediately beneath mine was occupied by a Turk who slept with his turban wound around his head. He was tall, thin, dark, bearded hollowed-faced and hook-nosed. At peace with Allah, he snored all night, producing a thin wheezing sound which, occasionally, for a moment or two, took on a deeper note. I thought how curious it was that I should be spending a night in such proximity to a Turk, for Turks were traditional enemies of Balkan peoples, including my own nation. For centuries Turks had forayed into Slovenian territory, Now here I was trying to sleep directly above a Turk with only a sheet of canvas between us. (pp. 40–44) Reference: Adamic, Louis. 1932. Laughing in the Jungle. New York: Harper Brothers.\n\nAfrican Americans. Many African Americans were employed at Ellis Island. Solomon Johnson was an immigrant inspector from about 1908 until he retired in 1933; in 1926, Johnson earned the respectable salary of $2,300 per year. Another black official was Ernest Craigwell, a clerk in the Statistical Division from about 1903 through 1930. In 1909, he was listed as an underclerk at a salary of $900 per year. Over the years his income rose, though never as high as an immigrant inspector’s. In 1906, he was photographed with Commissioner-General Frank Sargent and members of the Statistical Division staff. But these men were exceptional, for most blacks occupied menial positions as common laborers and charwomen. They surprised Europeans that had never seen blacks. American, Sadie (b. Chicago, 1862; d. New York, 1944). Social reformer. A founder of the National Council of Jewish Women (NCJW), Sadie American was originally from Chicago but moved to New York in 1900 to supervise efforts to aid Jewish girls and young women between the ages of fourteen and thirty-five. She assigned Cecilia Greenstone, Cecilia Razofsky, and other NCJW workers and volunteers to Ellis Island and the Lower East Side of Manhattan. She strove to protect these young women from crime and immorality. As a tribute to her success, she was ap-\n\npointed the U.S. delegate to the International White Slave Traffic Convention. In the NCJW, she served as corresponding secretary (1893– 1905), executive secretary (1905–1914), and president of the New York section (from 1900 and many years thereafter). American Family Immigration History Center (AFIHC). Opened in April 2001 by the Statue of Liberty–Ellis Island Foundation, this section of the Ellis Island Immigration Museum has a computer database with the records of twenty-two million passengers who entered the port of New York aboard ships from 1892 through 1924. Foreigners made up 17 million passengers, while the remainder were American citizens. The database provides researchers with such information as the passenger’s complete name, his ethnicity, last residence, age at arrival, gender, marital status, the name of the vessel that brought him to America, and the port of departure. In addition, the database provides images of the original ship and manifest. The records of the computer database were copied from passenger lists held on microfilm in the U.S. National Archives by 12,000 volunteers from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormon Church). American Immigrant Wall of Honor. See Statue of Liberty–Ellis Island Foundation American Museum of Immigration. The American Museum of Immigration was located on Liberty Island and was in operation from September 1972 until the National Park Service closed it in January 1991. The museum was founded by a group that included William H. Baldwin, Pierre S. duPont III, Alexander Hamilton, and General Ulysses S. Grant III. In 1955, the group began raising funds for museum construction with endorsements from prominent figures such as Vice President Richard M. Nixon, AFL-CIO union president George Meany, motion picture actor Edward G. Robinson, Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation chief executive Spyros P. Skouras, televi-\n\nAmerican Museum of Immigration\n\n3\n\nPeople can do genealogical research in the American Family Immigration History Center.

Although numerous ethnic societies, schools, and clubs contributed to the effort, the fund-raising was not successful. Eventually the federal government paid for the construction of the museum within the walls of Fort Wood at the base of the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty. Expensive construction work was carried out in the early 1960s that involved excavation within the walls of the fort and resulted in the destruction of valuable portions of its history that dated to the War of 1812. The museum’s advisory board of historians included Theodore Blegan, Allan Nevins, Carl Wittke, Oscar Handlin, John Higham, Thomas M. Pitkin, Rudolph Vecoli, John A. Krout, Horace M. Albright, and John Hope Franklin. They played an important role in planning the museum and its exhibits. Finan-\n\ncial troubles and debates about the ethnic representations and the historic theme planned for the museum slowed its completion. It was opened by President Nixon during a formal ceremony on September 26, 1972. The museum showed the demographic growth of the United States through immigration from the founding of the European colonies through the later years of Castle Garden and Ellis Island. Exhibits included photography, graphic designs, maps, engravings, and a wide variety of artifacts representing different periods of American history. Life-size mannequins represented colonists, pioneers who went west, ethnic fighting brigades from the Civil War, and so forth. There were also recordings of different immigrant types (as one approached mannequins they seemed to speak) and short historic films and different types of lighting in the various sections of the exhibit.\n\n4\n\nAmerican Red Cross\n\nThematically and chronologically, the American Museum of Immigration explored emigrants’ reasons for leaving the Old World, such as advancing colonialism and land conquest, securing religious freedom, gaining wealth and prosperity, working as indentured servants, coming as criminals or slaves, or fleeing from poverty, famine, war, discrimination, and persecution. The museum showcased the achievements of ethnic groups and their gifts to America. Thus the English, Scots, Welsh, Scotch-Irish, French, Dutch, Africans, Germans, Irish, Scandinavians, Chinese, Japanese, Eastern European Christians, Jews, Greeks, and Italians each received some measure of praise. In addition, the Indian wars, the African slave trade, slavery, the Revolutionary and Civil Wars, and other forms of military, social, political, and economic conflict were discussed and displayed. Honored also were those who overcame hardship and struggle in the New World and created lasting settlements, developed agriculture, expanded trade and manufacturing, and waged war. Famous immigrants who were recognized include Baron Friedrich von Steuben, Tadeusz Kosciuszko, E. I. duPont, Alexander Graham Bell, Franz Siegel, Carl Schurz, Andrew Carnegie, Joseph Pulitzer, Nikola Tesla, Charles Proteus Steinmetz, Jacob Riis, Bert Williams, Al Jolson, Hideyo Noguchi, Wanda Landowska, and Rudolph Valentino. The American Museum of Immigration, which did not enjoy continuous financial support from its founders, was closed shortly after the opening of the Ellis Island Immigration Museum.

The Red Cross came to Ellis Island with the erection of the Red Cross house on Island 2 in 1915. It provided recreational and social services to U.S. servicemen and some immigrants from that year until 1924. These services included a library and\n\nreading room, performances, and lectures. The American Library Association donated books to the library. Religious services were offered including regular Roman Catholic masses given by Father Anthony J. Grogan. H. Edenborough was the director of the Red Cross activities at the island from 1919 until 1920. The Red Cross house was demolished in 1936 to make space for new constructions. American Tract Society. This Protestant organization, founded in 1825, sent immigrant aid workers to Ellis Island for many years. Its representatives distributed foreign language tracts, books, and pamphlets to immigrants and aided newly arrived Christian immigrants. These publications were mainly gospel tracts. Americanization Movement (c. 1917–1920s, 1930s–1950s). This nativist movement sought to compel foreigners living in the United States to learn English and American customs. At the height of its power, from 1917 through 1922, it was hostile toward Germany, Austria-Hungary, and German-speaking people throughout the United States. Following the end of World War I, it expanded into a vast patriotic movement that pressured immigrants of all nationalities to give up their foreign ways and traditions and become American. In the years 1918 through 1921, under its influence, twenty states passed laws creating Americanization programs. At Ellis Island, the Americanization activities were conducted by such organizations as the Daughters of the American Revolution and the YMCA. It was actively supported by various Protestant missionaries, especially those from the Episcopal and Presbyterian Churches. Their goal was to teach newcomers American values through civics, history, and the English language. American law and heroes were extolled such as the Constitution, Bill of Rights, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Abraham Lincoln. They also taught patriotic airs, including the National Anthem\n\nAnarchists\n\nThe Cleveland Americanization Committee and the local board of education put out this poster encouraging the city’s large immigrant population of Italians, Hungarians, Serbians, Croatians, and Jews to learn English.

While the movement’s popularity rose and fell at various times elsewhere in the nation, its influence on Ellis Island remained steady until the station closed in 1954.

Those who advocated the violent overthrow of government by any means were greatly feared between 1870 and 1930. The assassinations of the Empress Elisabeth of AustriaHungary (1897), and King Humbert I of Italy (1900) by avowed anarchists shocked Americans and people throughout the world. How-\n\n5\n\never, the real shock came when President William McKinley was killed in Buffalo in 1901 by Leon Czogolsz, a Slavic American who claimed to have become an anarchist after hearing the radical orator Emma Goldman give a speech. In the aftermath of the president’s assassination, Congress included anarchists for exclusion in the Immigration Act of 1903. The first alien detained and excluded from entering the country because of his political opinions was the English anarchist and trade union organizer John Turner, who arrived in New York in October 1903 to begin a speaking tour of the country. A fortnight earlier the Secret Service had advised Commissioner-General Frank P. Sargent of his sailing and arrival date. While in detention at Ellis Island, Turner was interviewed by a reporter from the New York World. The newspaperman found him to be a mild-mannered man. The exclusion of Turner sent out a warning to other well-known anarchists not to visit the United States. Previous to the Immigration Act of 1903, many prominent anarchists had visited the country on speaking engagements, the most famous of whom was Prince Peter Kropotkin, the Russian philosopher and author who had inspired no less an anarchist than Emma Goldman. In 1919, a group of 249 radicals and other undesirables—including Goldman and Alexander Berkman—were deported to Russia via Finland. The murder trial of the Italian immigrants Sacco and Vanzetti in the 1920s was the last great case involving anarchists. The powerful effects of the restrictive immigrant quota laws of 1920s and the Great Depression of the 1930s lessened the fear of foreign anarchists.

As the largest island in San Francisco Bay, Angel Island has been the headquarters of many federal government operations, from a Public Health Service quarantine hospital to an enemy alien prison camp during World War II. But its most famous role was that of San Francisco’s best-known U.S. immigrant inspection station, a place comparable to Ellis Island. The station was opened when European immigration was at its height. With the upcoming inauguration of the Panama Canal, Europeans bound for California expected to be able to sail there via the canal instead of passing through New York’s crowded Ellis Island Immigrant Station and traveling overland by train. During its thirty years of operation (1910– 1940), the portion of the island given over to the activities of the Bureau of Immigration saw some 175,000 Chinese detained there, the majority as “paper sons” and “paper daughters.” Since it was illegal for Chinese people to immigrate to the United States under the Chinese Exclusion Act, most would-be immigrants had to take advantage of a loophole in the law that permitted the offspring of Chinese Americans to enter the country. The boards of special inquiry at the station responded to these claims by instituting long and arduous interrogations to ensure that the immigrant was not lying. Thus life at Angel Island for the majority of immigrants was marked by long periods of detention, feelings of frustration and hopelessness. Immigrants carved beautiful Chinese poems on the walls of detention areas at Angel Island to express their unhappiness and their plight. In addition to the Chinese, about 25,000 Japanese as well as thousands of Indians, Koreans, Russians, Mexicans, Filipinos, Australians, New Zealanders, and others passed through Angel Island or were detained there. Many of the immigrant inspectors and other employees of the Bureau of Immigration posted to Angel Island had transferred there from the Ellis Island station.\n\nAngel Island was closed by the Immigration and Naturalization Service after a fire destroyed its administration building in 1940. In about 1970, Chinese graffiti was discovered on the walls of the barracks, prompting the California State Department of Parks and Recreation and the National Park Service (NPS) to preserve the site. In 1997, the NPS added Angel Island to the National Register of Historic Places. See also Chinese Division; New York Chinese Office References: Bamford, Mary. 1917.

The animal house was originally used as a mortuary (c. 1911–1930s). It was designed in the neo-Renaissance style by federal architect James Knox Taylor in 1908 and constructed in 1908–1909 but was not opened until 1911. It is a one-story building and is linked to the buildings of the contagious disease wards on Island 3 by a central corridor. As the center for certain types of bacteriological studies at Ellis Island, experiments on animals were conducted in this building. Guinea pigs and monkeys were inoculated with mumps and scarlet fever in order to study these diseases more carefully. In 1935, thirty-six male and twelve female guinea pigs were bought for experimentation there. See also Office Building and Laboratory Appeals. Appeals against excluding an alien could be made in writing by the dissenting member of the three-man board of special inquiry and sent to the commissioner. With certain exceptions, aliens themselves could file appeals against a board’s decision to exclude the alien. According to Bureau of Immigration regulations:\n\nArmy\n\n7\n\nCommissioner Robert Watchorn (seated left, holding document) presides over an appeal case, ca 1906.

The immigration officer in charge may refuse to accept an appeal filed after the alien has been removed from an immigration station for deportation, provided the alien had a reasonable opportunity of appeal before such removal. Any appeal filed more than fortyeight hours after the time of an excluding decision may be rejected by the immigration officer in charge in his discretion.\n\nSee also Exclusion Reference: Herring, H.G., and D.H.

During World War I, the U.S. Army was assigned an extensive portion of Ellis Island, in effect twenty-one buildings. In a memorandum of understanding between the Departments of Labor, War, and Navy, dated February 17, 1918, the army received the general hospital buildings on Island 2, the contagious disease wards buildings on Island 3, and space in the Main Building and the kitchen and laundry building on Island 1. In the\n\nMain Building, the army occupied the Registry Division on the second floor and stairway two in the northeast tower leading to the third floor; all Special Inquiry Division board rooms and witness rooms on the north side, special inquiry detention rooms and the immigrants’ dining room, kitchen and corridor, which formed a part of the kitchen and laundry building. On the third floor of the Main Building in the west wing, they received the upper special inquiry rooms, including the janitors’ dormitory. On the same floor, in the east wing, was the Statistical Division’s bookbindery room. The army assigned the station the name “United States Debarkation Hospital Number 1,” for it was the nation’s first and foremost hospital to serve wounded soldiers returning from the battlefields of France; Major Chester R. Haig was its commanding officer. It opened on March 8, 1918, and the medical detachment eventually exceeded 100 personnel. The army doctors and nurses also treated a large number of influenza cases. A total of 250\n\n8\n\nArrival\n\nbeds were assigned to the Debarkation Hospital. The detachment included surgeons and ward men and maintained separate surgical rooms. Surgical, ambulatory, and psychopathic cases were among the ailments treated. Many of the first patients to be shipped in from France that March were shell shock cases and those who had lost limbs or were otherwise maimed. An Ellis Island official later said that it “was horrible to hear them scream and moan” (Crookston et al. 1918). The women and men of the American Red Cross began operating at the hospital in May 1918 and distributed books, games, writing materials, sweets, tobacco, fruit, and occasionally tickets to vaudeville shows and theater plays in New York. The Red Cross also operated a boat plying the waters between Ellis Island and Manhattan. In addition, the Reverend Father Anthony Grogan, the priest in charge of the Mission of Our Lady of the Rosary, gave spiritual guidance to the military personnel of the Roman Catholic faith. He was a favorite with the detachment, just as he had long been with the immigrants. The YMCA set up a reading room furnished with a Victrola\n\ngramophone, billiard tables, a piano, a motion picture machine, and a stage that ensured many an amusing evening for the detachment and the patients. After Christmas 1918, the detachment began preparing for evacuation and bidding good-bye to Ellis Isle. References: Crookston, Harry N., Floyd P. Bixler, and Walter O. Given, eds. 1918. The pill box.

Immigrants were transported to Ellis Island by barges and ferries from steamships docked at the piers of New York City and Hoboken, New Jersey. The steamship companies and the inspectors of the Boarding Division ensured that foreign passengers were safely brought to Ellis Island. In inclement weather, aliens stood under a majes"
