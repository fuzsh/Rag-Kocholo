        "text": "The University of Primorska successfully continued its path of pursuing excellence in all areas in 2023, consistent with the objectives of the UP Medium-Term Development Strategy 2021-2027. In July 2023, both the Senate and the UP Management Board adopted the updated Action Plan 21-27. The year was marked by the celebration of the 20th anniversary of UP, which started on 29 January 2023, the anniversary of the Founding Decree of UP, adopted by the National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia on 29 January 2003. As UP birthday, 17 March, the date of its entry in the Court Register, is celebrated.\n\nThe culmination of the celebrations were the events during the UP Week, which traditionally takes place on the occasion of UP's birthday - this year it was the Solemn Academy, UP 2.0, which took place the day before UP's birthday, 16 March. It was the occasion of the award of the title of Honorary Doctor of UP to Academician Prof. Jean-Pierre Bourguignon for his outstanding achievements in the field of science and for his significant contribution to the image and development of UP, and the inaugural lecture was delivered on UP's birthday. The Academy was also honoured by a visit from the keynote speaker, Mariya Gabriel, European Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, who stressed that \"Strong links between your university and innovation and a focus on interdisciplinary challenges based on challenging teaching and research have been and will continue to be the key to your success.\"\n\nOne of the most festive events of the year is the inauguration of the Rector of UP - after the elections in May, the current Rector, Prof. Klavdija Kutnar, took over the second term of office and thus started a new, four-year term of office on 23 November 2023.\n\nAmong the achievements of the year we would like to highlight:\n\nAs of 1 November 2023, UP became a full member of the European Transform4Europe University (T4EU), one of the 41 European Universities, an initiative of the European Commission, which aims to increase the attractiveness and competitiveness of the European Higher Education Area in the world. On 3 July, the European Commission also approved a follow-up proposal to the Transform4Europe Alliance, which will support the European University for another four years with a budget of €14.4 million from the Erasmus+ programme. Within the programme, UP will be responsible for extra-curricular activities and will have a strong presence in the field of cultural heritage studies.\n\nActive participation in ENIHEI, the European Network of Innovative Higher Education Institutions (ENIHEI), which brings together 35 institutions - one of the most important meetings was the ONI 2.0 (Open to New Ideas) conference, attended by 33 representatives of the 22 universities participating in the ENIHEI network of European Innovative Higher Education Institutions (ENIHEI) and 14 representatives of the eight universities participating in Transform4Europe (T4EU), alongside the EU Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, the Minister of Higher Education, Science and Innovation of the Republic of Slovenia and the former ERC President, Academic Prof. Jean-Pierre Bourguignon, who was awarded an honorary doctorate.\n\nThe European Commission has accepted UP as a partner of the New European Bauhaus initiative and the UP GDI project NOO has established the UP University Centre New European Bauhaus Academy Hub for a Sustainable Built Environment with Renewable Materials (NEBAP Hub) as of 14 June 2023, which will focus on regenerative and inclusive spaces that reduce environmental impacts through decarbonisation and lead to positive social and economic impacts, including health and well-being. The efforts culminated in December when the European Commission announced a pan-European consortium NEBA Alliance (New European Bauhaus Academy - NEBA), led by UP and composed of 14 partners from Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Sweden and the Netherlands, as the sole winner of the call for proposals for the establishment of a New European Bauhaus Academy (NEBA).\n\nIn the area of investments, UP has provided 55 new student beds in the new student dormitory Barka and 82 in the building Prisoje 9b, as well as a modern UP University Library, which offers study and reading spaces alongside the collections of all UP faculties - except for the UP FTS Turistica, which operates in a dislocated unit.\n\nIn October, the UP Clinic was opened in the Koper Health Centre, established on the basis of a Letter of Intent between UP and the Koper Health Centre.\n\nIn May, UP was awarded the HRS4R HR Excellence in Research award.\n\nThe following sections summarise the key highlights for 2023:\n\nUP in numbers\n\nIn the academic year 2023/2024, 5,744 students are enrolled at UP. Of these, 1,296 are international students, representing 22.56% of the total enrolment.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, there were 783 employees at UP, 314 of whom were male and 469 female. There are 503 higher education teachers and researchers, 13 are part of the leadership and 267 are administrative employees.\n\nIn 2023, until 30 December 2023, 1,120 students graduated at UP, of whom 811 graduated from bachelor's degree programmes, 287 from master's degree programmes and 22 from doctoral degree programmes.\n\n33 scholarships were awarded within the UP Scholarship Fund for the academic year 2023/2024.\n\nMore information on employees, students, and graduates can be found here.\n\nIn 2023, the UP Science Centre received more than 54,000 visitors, including more than 1,500 at the Simon's Bay Archaeological Park and more than 52,500 at the Piran Aquarium.\n\nStudy programmes\n\nIn the 2023/2024 academic year, 81 study programmes are offered at all levels of study, including 7 professional higher education programmes, 25 university programmes, 34 master's programmes and 15 doctoral programmes. There are 18 study programmes in English. At dislocated units in Ljubljana, Maribor, Novo mesto, Slovenske Konjice, Škofja Loka, Vipava and Ptuj, 6 study programmes are offered.\n\nNew Study programmes\n\nAt the first level, the call for applications was new in the study programmes implemented by UP FHŠ:\n\nGeography and History study programmes introduced single and double subject courses. This means that the candidate chooses his/her major (single or double) when applying;\n\nthe Bachelor's degree programme in Italian Studies has been converted from a 4-year programme to a 3-year programme;\n\na new course in English-Chinese is offered for the Bachelor's degree programme in Intercultural Linguistic Mediation;\n\nafter a few years, the university's two-subject study programme Anthropology and the university's two-subject study programme Cultural Heritage are again open for applications (in both English and Slovenian).\n\nAt the second level, for the first time, an innovative Master's degree programme in Data Science was offered in English at UP Famnit, which is being implemented within the framework of the GDI UP - Green, Digital and Inclusive UP project. The special feature is the replacement of traditional contact hours with other forms of study, in which students will actively participate in work at UP as lab technicians or technical assistants, thus obtaining references for the title of development associate in salary group H and the possibility of being employed as development associates.\n\nNew for the academic year 2023/2024 is a new PhD programme in Conservation Biology at UP Famnit.\n\nInternationalisation\n\nThe University is a member of 7 national and 12 international associations or networks. It is an active member of ENIHEI (European Network of Higher Education Institutions).\n\nAs of 31. 12. 2023, UP employed 72 researchers and teaching assistants from abroad, representing 13,95% of its professional staff. They come from 31 countries from all inhabited continents and are employed in all levels of posts.\n\nIn May, the new website welcome.upr.si was launched, providing mobile and international students with all the information they need for a successful study journey, including advice on how to overcome the daily challenges of moving abroad and studying at UP.\n\nA special event aimed at promoting mobility participation was the joining of the pan-European #erasmusdays campaign: the Erasmus+ World Café mini fair and the My Erasmus+ Experience exhibition.\n\nUP was actively involved both in the strategic meeting \"Networking in the field of Higher Education between Southeast European Countries aiming priorities of Erasmus+ 2021-2027\", where it was represented by Prof. Michaël Mrissa, Vice-Rector for Internationalisation of UP, and in the discussions with CMEPIUS, as two representatives of CMEPIUS visited UP.\n\nUP was also invited to participate in the international conference \"Will Central Asia be the next hub for higher education?\" (July, Uzbekistan), which is a recognition of UP's past work and cooperation in the region, as it has assisted partners in Central Asia with the renewal and design of new Master's degree programmes, the delivery of courses, and has also educated doctoral students from the region through Erasmus+ projects, carried out peer-to-peer mobility of students and staff, and collaborated in research.\n\nUP was again present at the 33rd EAIE International Fair and Conference in Rotterdam, one of the most prestigious events in the international education sector, where it was active in both the Study in Slovenia and Transform4Europe presentations. It was also active at Study in Slovenia events, both in nearby countries and at the presentation in Argentina.\n\nMajor research consortia in which UP is involved\n\nUP is involved in 19 consortia, among which we highlight: T4EU consortium - Transform4Europe - The European University for Knowledge Entrepreneurs, B-RIN consortium for the implementation of the B-RIN project, Development of basic content and skills in computer science and informatics in kindergartens and primary schools, KRPAN for the implementation of the project Strengthening Research Support and Activities for the Advancement of European Research Projects, the NOO PSS for the implementation of the project Modernisation of Pedagogical Study Programmes - Modernisation of the NOO PSS and the NOO SPOZNAJ for the implementation of the project Support for the Introduction of the Principles of Open Science in Slovenia Support for the Implementation of the Principles of Open Science in Slovenia.\n\nIn December, the European Commission announced the New European Bauhaus Academy (NEBA), a pan-European consortium led by UP under the umbrella of the NEBAP HUB and composed of 14 partners from Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Sweden and the Netherlands, as the sole winner of the call for proposals for the establishment of a New European Bauhaus Academy (NEB). This is the flagship initiative of the European Year of Skills, which highlights the importance of training and lifelong learning to develop the necessary skills, including for the green and digital transition. It brings together not only the expertise of a geographically large part of Europe, which will facilitate regional and national impact on the construction sector, but also diverse partners, at different levels of research, teaching, decision-making and influencing opinion - academic institutions, research centres, public authorities and European networks. UP has a special link in the consortium with the Estonian Academy of Art (EKA, Tallinn), as they are members of the European University Transform 4 Europe, thus promoting involvement and partnership in the international network.\n\nConnecting with the environment is an important pillar of the University's work, both in education and in research and project work. Every year, UP expands its network of local, national and international partners in the fields of education, culture, research, business, and cooperation with NGOs and the local community is also important. Here we would like to highlight the excellent cooperation with the P.I.K.A. Coordination, which brings together all four Istrian municipalities and with which we aim to create a student- and researcher-friendly environment - an excellent cooperation that is also reflected in the joint opening of the academic year, which takes place in a different host municipality each year.\n\nA special event of cooperation with the environment is the StartUP event, which on the first Saturday after the beginning of the academic year in Žusterna introduces to new and current students not only UP members and centres (and units), but also associations from the local (and national) environment, which have again this year identified cooperation with UP as an excellent opportunity to recruit new members or to spread information about their activities.\n\nAn important contribution to the quality of the environment is the establishment of a research and development unit for pre-school education (RA-RA unit), which was set up by UP PEF in cooperation with the Koper Kindergarten and the Municipality of Koper, the specificity of which is that it is the first multilingual kindergarten unit in Koper. Within this framework, the Council of the UP PEF Research and Development Unit of Early Childhood Education (RA-RA) was also constituted, bringing together researchers and practitioners, parents' representatives, representatives of the local community, kindergarten directors and the management of the Faculty.\n\nUP has introduced the UPerspective section on the website, which gives UP experts the opportunity to respond to current developments and provide both expert commentary and opinions, and has already received an increased number of contributions in 2023.\n\nThis year, for the first time, the Slovenian Science Festival, from 26 to 28 September, also included events for all three grades of primary school in Koper, and on 29 September, UP opened the door to research at the traditional European Researchers' Night, held with the associated Science for All - ZATE event.\n\nAnother special event organised by UP was the Encounters at the Border event series on the theme of migrant routes, migrants and people along the route, conceived by Prof. Michael Mrissa and Assoc. Prof. Katja Hrobat Virloget. It brought together not only stakeholders in the most vulnerable areas, but also experts in the cross-border field.\n\nFor the first time, UP organised Wings for life - a group run with an app, organised by SportUP, which provides recreational activities for students and staff at UP, and invited charity runners who do not have an organised charity run in the region. The run was held under the ambassadorship of UP FVZ alumnus Aljosa Habjan - a graduate of Applied Kinesiology who was seriously injured during his studies and became a tetraplegic.\n\nVisits\n\nAlso in 2023 (on the occasion of a major visit to celebrate the 20th anniversary of UP), there were a number of visits by prominent scientists as well as representatives of international institutions, embassies and ministries.\n\nIn February, UP welcomed a delegation from the University of Silesia, a member of T4EU, to explore with the guests the possibilities for internationalisation and research cooperation, and in October, representatives from the Portuguese Polytechnic Institute of Tomar to benchmark UP's activities in the areas of lifelong learning, knowledge transfer, digital skills and the development of a micro evidence system. UP was also visited by delegations from two Chinese universities - a delegation from Shandong Agricultural University in China (a Letter of Intent for cooperation was signed at the meeting) and representatives from Shanghai University of International Business and Economics (SUIBE). In September, a delegation from UP visited the Jožef Stefan Institute - representatives of the management as well as researchers and employees of professional services in the field. Visit of the UP delegation to the T4EU Strategic Council, for the first time as a full member of the Alliance.\n\nIn November, UP also hosted Prof. Dr. Petros Pashiardis, Professor of Educational Leadership and Rector of the Open University of Cyprus (Cyprus), and Prof. Dr. Stefan Brauckmann-Sajkiewicz, Professor of Quality Development and Quality Assurance in Education at the Alpe-Adriatic University (AAU) of Klagenfurt (Austria), who met with the UP management and the Head of the School for Principals.\n\nThe University of Primorska was visited by: the First Lady of the Republic of Albania, Mrs. Amanda Begaj, Ambassador of France, H.E. Florence Levy, Ambassador of Poland, H.E. Krzysztof Olendzki, Director of the Slovenian Science Foundation, Dr. Edvard Kobal, Honorary Consul of the Republic of Slovenia in Colombia, Juan Carlos Yepes, and Honorary Consul of the Republic of Slovenia in Brazil, Rainier Michael Herbert de Souza. The University was also visited by a group of Members of the National Assembly elected in the municipalities where the University operates.\n\nAmong the visits that foreshadow activities in the coming year is the visit of the International University Sports Union (FISU), as the World University Sport Climbing Championships will be held in Koper in September 2024, in which UP will also participate.\n\nThe University has built on its cultural and artistic work, either on its own or in collaboration with other institutions in the local area. It now regularly hosts exhibitions at the Armerija Hall. On the occasion of the UP Week, the academic painter Assoc. Prof. Tilen Žbona exhibited his exhibition Homage to the Blue Rider in the UP Armerija Hall. Dr. Žbona also curates the research, cultural and artistic events of the SPEKULA Manifesto (in its fifth edition this year), aimed at promoting cultural and artistic production and specialised professions alongside the strategy for the development of new artistic study programmes.\n\nThe exhibition space of the UP FTŠ Turistica in Portorož also completed the year with a renewed concept, and in 2023 regularly hosted exhibitions, including Wood in Tourism of Portorož: yesterday, today, tomorrow (within the framework of the project WOOD IN TOURISM (LesTur)), Blue Investments for Green Tourism (prepared on the occasion of the World Tourism Day) and Tourism on the Blockchain: Innovation or a New Illusion of User Experience (after the first, pioneering use of this type of tokens).\n\nIn June 2023, the second exhibition of selected works by Visual Arts and Design students opened, showcasing important works from a full year of work in the second year of the first year of the programme. The exhibition of works of traditional Chinese painting by Master Li Qinghao and his students, created during the workshop of the Confucius Classroom Koper (UP) and installed in the lobby of the UP Armerija Hall during the summer months, was also visited by representatives of the Chinese Shandong Agricultural University and the Shanghai SUIBE - Shanghai University of International Business and Economics during their visits to UP.\n\nThe two autumn exhibitions were dedicated to presenting some of the areas of UP's activities - international exchanges with the exhibition My Erasmus+ Experience, which brought together thoughts and photos of past Erasmus+ mobility of UP staff and students (created in the framework of the #erasmusdays event), and innovation with the exhibition Innovation in Pika, created on the occasion of the consultation of the same name.\n\nIn cooperation with InnoRenew CoE and the public agency Spirit Slovenia, UP produced two educational documentaries, Knocking on Wood and Living for Wood, which were also broadcast on RTV Slovenia. The aim of both is to raise awareness among the Slovenian public about Slovenia's wealth in wood, the use of wood for high added value products and its enormous social and environmental benefits. In addition, wood is also important for the development of the Slovenian economy and the creation of green jobs.\n\nThe Career Centre of the University of Primorska, Centre for Lifelong Learning and Career Orientation (KC UP) organised 37 different events and 853 participants within the framework of the integrated personal career management programme. In May, it organised the UP Career Fair, which brought together employers of UP students and graduates.\n\nIn 2023, UP completed the project \"UP Integrated Personal and Professional Growth Programme (UP Personal Growth)\", which aimed to build on the Integrated Personal Career Management Programme, specifically addressed specific groups of students and their support needs, and was managed within the framework of the UP KC.\n\nIn 2023, the Alumni UP activities were strengthened through the activities carried out within the GDI UP project. In order to provide free education and training to the Alumni UP members, a Questionnaire on Lifelong Learning Content was developed and submitted for completion in August 2023, and focus groups were launched in December to reinforce the results obtained. In April, the UP Alumni Week took place, bringing together more than 170 members for 19 training sessions and the annual MeetUP meeting. The first Alumni video, Career Stories of UP Alumni, was also produced. A series of free training sessions aimed at professional development of human resources were held throughout the year and will continue in 2024.\n\nThe aim of the GDI UP pilot projects is to equip students, graduates, employees and other stakeholders with the competences for a green and digital transition to Society 5.0. In 2023, more than 2,500 participants from different target groups were involved in lifelong learning."
