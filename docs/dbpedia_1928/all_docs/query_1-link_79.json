        "text": "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIt doesn't exactly matter if you were raped before or after you lost your virginity. Regardless of when, the trauma contorts the way you feel about yourself and your body. Additionally, it confuses your sense of being a sexual being. People who have a good understanding of their sexuality tend to have healthier sex lives. Having good self-esteem and confidence enables them to feel sexually empowered, a mental sphere that is very difficult to reach after surviving rape. Rape is a humiliation that stays with you long after the actual crime has been committed.\n\nAfter what happened to me, I wanted to hide from anything overtly sexual. Through eating disorders and addiction, I pushed away reality and ignored my developing sexuality. I couldn't embrace womanhood, it did not feel safe for me. It felt safer to push away the very thought of sexual intimacy and hide behind addictions and unhealthy behavior. I could only equate sex with all things horrific and felt uncomfortable receiving that type of attention from men. I never felt sexy and I didn't want to be viewed as sexy either.\n\nIt was either coerced sex or sex to keep the boyfriend happy, and that was it. They weren't good situations but they were more predictable than what I feared, possible date rape, or even being overpowered by a date while conscious. These were fears that constantly filled my head, things that most people, including myself, do not worry about until it is already too late to prevent it from happening.\n\nI never was sexually empowered or felt sexy -- until now. Perhaps it is normal for victims of rape to lose this sense of empowerment because when you are raped, in that moment your power is taken away from you. For years I struggled with addiction, eating disorders and unhealthy relationships. I was afraid to let go of the control I had by isolating myself in these addictive behaviors. Caught up in my addictions, I felt safe from being raped again.\n\nA decade passed. I spent ten years in arrested development, trying to avoid the inevitable: having to go out there and be on my own as a woman, a sexual being. Finally, I took a deep breath and went out into the world. I worked, dated and went out with friends. I was able to survive out in the very world I'd feared for so long. Empowerment came naturally when I finally stepped out on my own and found that I was not raped or attacked. I became more self-assured and confident each time I challenged myself by leaving my comfort zone. Eating issues and addictions were replaced by self-esteem and joy. Problems that I thought I could never get rid of, even cycles of addiction, seemed to effortlessly melt away when I faced my biggest fears. And eventually I felt comfortable in my body. I finally was able to define myself as a sexual being and acknowledge my sexual power in a healthy and natural way.\n\nJacob Wetterling: Remains of missing Minnesota boy found, authorities say\n\nby Ralph Ellis and Ray Sanchez\n\nThe remains of Jacob Wetterling, a Minnesota boy abducted from a rural road 27 years ago, have been found, the Stearns County Sheriff's Office said Saturday in a news release.\n\n\"The Ramsey County Medical Examiner and a forensic odontologist identified the remains as Wetterling's earlier today,\" the release said.\n\nThe release didn't say if anybody has been charged. The sheriff's office said investigators will evaluate new evidence and \"expect to be in a position to provide more detailed information early next week.\"\n\nThe abduction of the 11-year-old boy led to the 1994 Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act, which requires states to maintain sex offender registries and guidelines.\n\nUnnamed sources told CNN affiliate WCCO and the Minneapolis Star Tribune newspaper that a suspect in Wetterling's disappearance led the FBI to remains that are now being tested for DNA.\n\nPatty Wetterling, Jacob's mother who became an advocate for families of missing children, told CNN in a text, \"Our hearts are broken. There are no words.\" She declined further comment.\n\nAbductor wore stocking mask\n\nJacob disappeared on a dark road in central Minnesota on the night of October 22, 1989.\n\nJacob had been at home with his two younger siblings, Trevor, 10, and Carmen, 8, and Jacob's friend Aaron Larsen, 11, while Patty and Jerry Wetterling attended a dinner party about 20 minutes away.\n\nWetterling, who lived in rural St. Joseph, his brother and a friend were coming home from a convenience store on bikes and a scooter when a man wearing a stocking mask and holding a gun approached.\n\nThe man asked the boys their ages, grabbed Jacob and told the others to run into the woods or else he'd shoot, Jacob's father has said, recounting what his other son told police.\n\nThe case garnered worldwide attention and was recently featured on the CNN series \"The Hunt with John Walsh.\"\n\nWidespread search\n\nAs news of the disappearance spread, FBI agents and National Guard troops descended on St. Joseph to aid in the search.\n\nTens of thousands of tips surfaced in the weeks that followed, but none led to an arrest or, until now, discovery of the boy's remains.\n\nIn October 2015, authorities announced a development: Child pornography suspect Danny James Heinrich, 52, was questioned in the abduction.\n\nInvestigators interviewed Heinrich about Jacob's disappearance, according to Andrew M. Luger, the U.S. attorney for Minnesota. Heinrich denied any involvement in the disappearance, authorities said.\n\nAt that time, no charges were filed in the Wetterling case.\n\nMother becomes advocate\n\nSince her son's kidnapping, Patty Wetterling helped create the sex offender registry for Minnesota and subsequently for the nation.\n\nShe also helped build Team HOPE -- Help Offering Parents Empowerment -- a parent-to-parent mentoring program for mothers and fathers in similar situations.\n\n\"Most parents know nothing about child abduction, so when it happens you just scramble for what's out there,\" Wetterling said in 2014.\n\nJacob would have turned 38 in February.\n\n\"Jacob was a fun, active, athletic, kind, 11-year-old boy who loved peanut butter and football,\" his mother wrote in 2014. \"He was most known for his sense of fairness.\"\n\nMinnesota Gov. Mark Dayton issued a statement saying, \"Today, we continue to offer our love and support, as the Wetterling family finally brings their son home to rest.\"\n\nThe Jacob Wetterling Resource Center, a foundation that provides education on the exploitation of children, said Saturday: \"We are in deep grief. We didn't want Jacob's story to end this way.\"\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2016/09/03/us/jacob-wetterling-remains-found/\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nReports of clowns in SC woods put citizens on edge\n\nPolice held a press conference today to address the growing reports of people dressed up as clowns and standing in the woods\n\nby The Associated Press\n\nGREENVILLE, S.C. Â— Deputies in South Carolina have increased patrols after getting new reports of people dressed as clowns trying to lure children into the woods.\n\nNews outlets report that Greenville County sheriff's deputies were called to an apartment complex about 8:20 p.m. Monday that is about 20 minutes from a complex where people reporting seeing clowns last week.\n\nDeputies responding to the report last week said they found no evidence of anyone in the woods behind Fleetwood Manor Apartments.\n\nA family who called Monday night from Emerald Commons apartments said a child saw a man wearing a clown mask in woods near the complex.\n\nDeputies said there was a third report of someone dressed as a clown about 10 p.m. at Shemwood Apartments.\n\nA 12-year-old told deputies that two clowns were in the backyard area.\n\nhttp://www.policeone.com/bizarre/articles/217773006-Reports-of-clowns-in-SC-woods-put-citizens-on-edge/\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAustralia\n\nSexual assault among young people is on the rise. But why?\n\nby Antoinette Lattouf\n\nParents across the country felt a familiar wave of nausea this week after news broke of an alleged sexual assault of a child at a Sydney school.\n\nIn this case, two 12-year-old boys were charged with sexually assaulting a six-year-old girl in a toilet block.\n\nPre-teen boys allegedly raping children in what is meant to be a safe environment is indisputably alarming, but how widespread is the problem?\n\nAustralian Bureau of Statistics data showed the number of young people under 20 who had committed sexual assaults had increased by more than 20 per cent from 2008/09 to 2013/14.\n\nIn 2014, a quarter of sexual offenders under the age of 20 were 10 to 14 years old.\n\nOver the past decade in New South Wales, the rate of juvenile offenders of sexual assault as well as young victims has risen.\n\nPut simply, this means more young people are being sexually assaulted at the hands of other children.\n\n\"It doesn't surprise me that if child/juvenile victims are increasing, that child/juvenile offenders are too,\" director of NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research Don Weatherburn said.\n\n\"The media stereotype of a child sex assault offender is of an adult assaulting a child, but there are plenty of cases where victim and offender are not that different in age.\"\n\nWhat is driving aggressive sexual behaviour in children?\n\nCatharine Lumby, a professor of media studies at Macquarie University, said: \"We do know that consensual sexual play among children of the same age is not new and is part of development.\"\n\nBut she stressed that consent and respect was pivotal.\n\nEarlier this year, instances of inappropriate sexualised behaviour among Year 1 students at Sydney's Trinity Grammar School were investigated by the NSW Department of Family and Community Services.\n\nWhile pornography is not a new phenomenon, the ease of access a young person has to it has changed with nine out of 10 teenagers owning a mobile phone.\n\nChild welfare experts said pornography was inextricably linked to the growing number of young sexual offenders in Australia.\n\n\"We run programs for young people who have engaged in problematic sexual behaviours and have done so for 15 years,\" said Joe Tucci, head of the Childhood Foundation.\n\nMr Tucci said most kids had watched pornography before becoming a teenager.\n\n\"Sex can be really confusing for a young person,\" he said.\n\n\"A lot of pornography often positions women in less powerful positions, things like aggression and rough sex is commonly shown in porn.\n\n\"Those messages are sexualising violence.\"\n\nProfessor Lumby said the tendency to focus immediately and solely on the proliferation of pornography was too simplistic.\n\n\"We know that children who are inclined to be abusive are often from dysfunctional homes, they are likely to have been exposed to abuse themselves, either physical or sexual, and could be in an environment of drug and alcohol abuse,\" she said.\n\nThe media and judicial attention on sexual abuse is also thought to be contributing to increasing crime statistics.\n\n\"A significant factor is growing willingness to disclose child sexual assault and growing determination on the part of government agencies to uncover it,\" Mr Weatherburn said\n\n\"The royal commission has probably given further impetus to reporting.\"\n\nSchools not doing enough, but the conversation starts at home\n\nMr Tucci believes parents do not want to believe how much porn their kids see from a young age.\n\n\"We want to put our heads in the sand instead of doing something about it,\" he said.\n\nJenny Ackland is the co-founder of Sex Education Australia and has been running programs in Melbourne schools for eight years and said parents needed to equip their children with tools to manage the messages porn sends.\n\n\"And they need to know that they won't get in trouble for asking those sorts of questions.\"\n\nMs Ackland, whose team runs programs in 60 primary and secondary schools across Melbourne, said young people had become increasingly sexually aware in the past couple of years.\n\n\"We used to be asked questions like 'what is a condom?' and now we get asked by children who are 10 years old, 'what is rimming?' and 'how do you have anal sex?',\" she said.\n\n\"So it's more about how you do something rather than what it is.\"\n\nIn Australia, students are expected to start formally learning about sex, relationships and sexuality from Year 3.\n\nBut Professor Lumby said Australian schools had an \"Anglo approach\" which coats the body and sex in shame and denial.\n\n\"The focus of sex education in Australia is about plumbing and diseases in upper primary,\" she said.\n\n\"It's about mechanics and how babies are made. The conservative and religious lobby ensure that it's just about biology.\"\n\nSexual education in the Netherlands begins when students are four years old. The system allows for flexibility in how it is taught, but it must address certain core principles, including sexual diversity and sexual assertiveness.\n\nFor example, in educating kindergarten students, fiction books are often used. Picture books show animals hugging and a teacher explains the animals are hugging \"because they want to\" and \"because it feels good\".\n\nThis paves the way for an educator to explain what an animal can say to his friend if the hugging makes them feel uncomfortable.\n\nPornography is also discussed in sex education in Denmark and there is even a push to have it shown and deconstructed in classrooms.\n\nSocieties which are open about sex and start education young, like the Netherlands and Denmark, have well documented results including lower rates of STIs and unwanted teen pregnancies.\n\nProfessor Lumby has called for the Federal Government to coordinate a national sex education program that is centred on respect and consent and deals with uncomfortable topics like pornography.\n\nShe said waiting until Year 3 was too late.\n\n\"We need age-appropriate education teaching kids to say no,\" Professor Lumby said.\n\n\"This is about children feeling they have a right to say no, but at the same time not to feel ashamed about their sexual curiosity.\"\n\nhttp://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-03/sexual-assault-among-young-people-is-on-the-rise.-but-why/7810866\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOhio\n\nClark County mom fights for stricter child abuse laws\n\nby Katherine Collins\n\nTen years after her daughter was rushed to the hospital with shaken baby syndrome, Clark County resident Randi Shepherd continues to fight for harsher sentences for child abusers.\n\nHer daughter Destiny, 11-years-old now, suffered permanent brain damage from an incident in 2006 when Shepherd's then-boyfriend, Terrance King, shook the then-16-month-old and threw her against a wall. King was convicted of felonious assault and child endangering and sentenced to eight years in prison.\n\nÂ“He took a life,Â” Shepherd said. Â“Even though she's still here, her heart is still beating Â— she is forever changed.Â”\n\nShepherd believes King should have spent more time in prison for the crime so she's been fighting to pass Â“Destiny's LawÂ” since 2007.\n\nÂ“For the rest of her life she will have brain damage and seizures,Â” she said.\n\nThe law would increase the penalty for people convicted of assaulting a child, Shepherd said. A previous draft of the bill that would have increased the penalty to 18 years was passed in the Ohio House of Representatives last session, Shepherd said, but wasn't voted on by the Senate before the session expired.\n\nState Rep. Kyle Koehler, R-Springfield, said the bill may have failed because its language couldn't be agreed on.\n\nÂ“It's possible that it's going to come up in the (next) General Assembly,Â” Koehler said.\n\nHe believes the bill should pass, he said, if the wording is the most effective.\n\nÂ“We need to make sure it's a good law that prosecutors can get convictions on,Â” he said, Â“and it will help people and not hurt other people that it didn't intend to hurt.Â”\n\nShepherd will begin a new effort to get a similar bill passed when the state session begins later this year.\n\nÂ“It means everything to me,Â” she said.\n\nhttp://www.whio.com/news/crime--law/clark-county-mom-fights-for-stricter-child-abuse-laws/kKqYAe8vIyO18iuXTHH1KM/\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNew Mexico\n\nTherapist authors children's book on sexual abuse\n\nby James Fenton\n\nFARMINGTON Â— When Alisha Hawthorne-Martinez went looking for child- and family-friendly literature to help her clients find solutions to sexual abuse, the 32-year-old clinical social worker said she became frustrated with the lack of quality titles available.\n\nSo Hawthorne-Martinez began writing one herself. The result is \"This Is My Body and It Belongs To Me,\" a 32-page book she self-published last month. It is available in paperback from Lulu.com ($15.99) and as an e-book at Amazon.com ($3.99). In three weeks, it will be available in paperback from Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble retailers, she said.\n\nAlthough the subtitle is \"An introduction to sexual abuse prevention and response for children ages 3 and up,\" the book is also for other age groups and for parents, guardians, teachers, doctors and other therapists like herself, she said.\n\nHawthorne-Martinez said the book is part of her effort to turn the tide on the rate of sexual abuse in San Juan Count and to orient the community's focus on prevention, rather than merely treating the problem.\n\nShe currently juggles a caseload of more than 60 children she treats each month, she said.\n\nIn 2015, Hawthorne-Martinez established her private practice, Second Chance Counseling, which is now located on Apache Street.\n\nMany of the families she sees lack the basics Â— the money or the confidence, most often Â— to address sexual abuse, she said.\n\n\"I was searching, trying to find literature on sexual abuse on kids, age-appropriate stuff. There were only a couple of things out there, and it's not like they were bad, but they skirted around the idea,\" she said. \"Nobody went right for the throat. And we have to. Our caseload is incredibly high.\"\n\nHawthorne-Martinez is one of the only therapists in San Juan County who treats people 18 and younger who commit sexual harm to others as well as victims of abuse. She said the book is a needed resource to help her clients and their families tackle an uncomfortable issue that is loaded with stigma and misinformation.\n\nOne is \"stranger danger,\" the popular concept that harm to children comes from people the minor doesn't know personally. Hawthorne-Martinez said the majority of sexual abuse cases she sees involve victims whose abusers are the opposite Â— often trusted relatives, many who live in the same home as the victim.\n\nOn Friday, she pitched the book over lunch to a group of pediatricians at San Juan Health Partners Pediatrics on Schwartz Avenue.\n\n\"I think this fills a void we might have not known we had,\" Dr. Brad Scoggins said after her pitch.\n\nDr. N. Vivian Nnebe said she would like to purchase copies of the book but suggested it be available in gender-specific covers. Though the story features both a boy and girl, the current cover only features an illustration of a girl, which Hawthorne-Martinez said she would change.\n\nErin Hourihan, CEO for Childhaven, said she would like to secure enough money to purchase at least 300 copies of the book to provide one for each of the nonprofit's clients. Because of the economic downturn, Hourihan said she would only be able to earmark enough money in the organization's waning budget to purchase 10 copies.\n\nFor 20 years, Hourihan has worked at the organization, which cares for children caught in difficult situations, often abuse or neglect.\n\nBetween July 2014 and June 2015, Childhaven handled 254 cases of child abuse, including 104 cases of sexual abuse, in San Juan County.\n\nWithin the last year, the rate of cases the nonprofit have taken were stubbornly similar. Between July 2015 and this July, Childhaven treated 104 sexual abuse cases out of a total of 263 child abuse cases that received forensic interviews.\n\nThe cases begin with forensic interviews at Childhaven's Child Advocacy Center on Airport Drive. They are led by advocates and involve multiple specialists and law enforcement listening in remotely from a separate room.\n\nThose interviews sometimes occur at a rate of four or five a day, Hourihan said.\n\nHawthorne-Martinez said the book is another way to raise awareness of the problem of child sexual abuse, which she said can often be \"extremely traumatizing for really for every member of the family.\"\n\n\"Sex abuse can really harm, destroy, families. ... Some cases, the kids have held onto it for so many years,\" she said.\n\nhttp://www.daily-times.com/story/news/local/farmington/2016/09/03/therapist-authors-childrens-book-sexual-abuse/89766622/\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSexual misconduct in schools is troubling, but not epidemic, say experts\n\nby Caitlin Walsh\n\nANDOVER Â– Phillips Academy announced in a letter to the community last week that an independent investigation, which began in the spring, found five cases of sexual misconduct involving faculty members and students in the 1970s and '80s.\n\nThree ex-faculty members were named: H. Schuyler Royce (now deceased), Stephen Wicks and Alexander Theroux.\n\nIt was just one in a string of private school sexual misconduct cases in the past few years. St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, Deerfield Academy in Deerfield, Massachusetts, and most recently St. George's School in Middletown, Rhode Island, have had sexual misconduct cases emerge.\n\nEven Phillips Academy itself is no stranger to trouble: In 2014, Richard Keller, the former school medical director, was sentenced to six and a half years in prison for child pornography.\n\nIn their 2004 study \"Educator Sexual Misconduct: A Synthesis of Existing Literature,\" the Department of Education cited data collected by the American Association of University Women (AAUW) in 2000.\n\n\"Based on the assumption that the AAUW surveys accurately represent the experiences of all K-12 students, more than 4.5 million students are subject to sexual misconduct by an employee of a school sometime between kindergarten and 12th grade,\" the study reported.\n\nFurthermore, according to the Department of Education report, the AAUW also concluded that \"nearly 9.6 percent of students are targets of educator sexual misconduct sometime during their school career.\"\n\nOf those offenses, the AAUW broke down the percentage of student targets by job titles of the offenders. It found 18 percent were by teachers, the highest number by job title, followed by 15 percent by coaches. Among victims, 57.2 percent were male students and 42.8 percent females.\n\n'Not a high rate'\n\nBut sexual misconduct at private schools is not necessarily an epidemic, say those who study the problem.\n\nDavid Finkelhor, professor of sociology, director of the Crimes against Children Research Center and co-director of the Family Research Laboratory at the University of New Hampshire, says that, while troubling, there is no evidence that crimes like these are more common at private boarding schools than they are at public schools.\n\n\"If you look back at a 40-year period, in any environment where thousands of young people have had contact with a variety of adults and older youth, you will find cases of sexual abuse. It's just that common,\" he said. \"These are long periods of time that we are aggregating over in these investigations, when these schools have asked all the alumni to report on possible examples of abuse. There are undoubtedly many cases that they're not hearing about as well, but five, 10 or a dozen cases over a period of 40 or 50 years is not a high rate.\"\n\nIn the grand scheme of sexual abuse cases, Finklehor went on to explain that while concerning, abuse at the hands of school teachers and staff are less common than other offenders.\n\n\"Teachers are not the highest risk offenders,\" he said. \"You have the highest risk for teenagers at the hands of other students and peers. There's just an enormous amount of peer sexual assault that occurs in this dating environment. Also, a great deal is in the family, in the neighborhood, and a recent study that we did suggested that at least in recent years, sexual abuse at schools is quite small in comparison to other kinds of abuse.\"\n\nAnother note made by Finklehor was the timing of many of the crimes. The recent Phillips allegations occurred during the 1970s and 1980s. The recent revelations from St. George's School spanned four decades, reaching back to alumni in their 40s, 50s and even 60s now.\n\nThe difference, Finklehor said, was not just about the schools -- it was about society then and now.\n\n\"I think that there was a clarification of the norms and standards,\" he explained. \"I think that there was a little bit of a romanticization of these teacher-student sexual relationships which had occurred in the 1960s and '70s, and people did not really understand the damaging nature of it and the fact that it was a breach of responsibility. I think schools and other institutions became more alert to this and began to educate both students and their staff about these issues.\"\n\nLooking ahead\n\nTo truly address the problem, Finklehor could think of a number of solutions.\n\n\"I do think we haven't done enough in a couple of ways,\" he said. \"I don't think we've educated everybody enough about what's wrong with these relationships, with what's wrong between teachers and students. Some occur as a result of abuse or coercion, some of them don't. We need to educate people why someone who is in that position really has a responsibility not to let those relationships develop, because they are exploiting the special authority and status that they have and these relationships are not really healthy.\"\n\nThe solution, he said, would be to perhaps train educators more than they are now, and to make that education occur early on in graduate programs, as well as every so often throughout their careers.\n\n\"A lot more attention needs to go into teaching teachers to anticipate that these kinds of situations, of what will occur, where they will need to exert some self control, be able to set boundaries,\" he said.\n\nPhillips Academy, going forward, is trying to do just that, with efforts to educate and inform both students and staff on healthy relationships, boundaries, and consent, school officials said.\n\nHead of School John Palfrey and Dean of Students Jenny Elliott just last year produced a short video outlining the school's affirmative consent policy, something that Elliott says was discussed at length with students in the year prior.\n\n\"The affirmative consent policy strengthens our policy by adding more language to student relationships and intimacy,\" she said. \"We had clear expectations around harassment policies, but this was changed by students who wanted Andover to be progressive what, at the time, colleges and universities were doing.\"\n\nThe major change, Elliott said, was a clear \"yes means yes, instead of the absence of a no\" policy among students in intimate situations with their peers. It went into the school's handbook -- The Blue Book -- in the fall of 2015.\n\nFurthermore, Elliott said, the school addresses consent and healthy relationships at their All School assemblies, in small group conversations, in health counseling groups in dormitories and in advising groups.\n\nAs far as the staff and faculty go, Elliott said, \"We have trainings every year for faculty and staff in terms of boundaries and our specific policies. Faculty and staff are both trained in how they would respond to a situation, we are very clear about our rules. We work with all our new faculty in our new faculty orientation on physical and emotional boundaries.\"\n\nhttp://www.eagletribune.com/news/sexual-misconduct-in-schools-is-troubling-but-not-epidemic-say/article_8160604d-a0ae-54d4-a2d2-38c9f8f37570.html\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIowa\n\n7 Iowa teachers guilty of sex abuse get no prison time\n\nby Jason Clayworth\n\nSome Iowa teachers convicted of sexually abusing students have been placed on probation rather than sentenced to prison, despite a state law requiring they spend time behind bars, a Des Moines Register investigation has found.\n\nThe law, passed in 1997, specifically prohibits anyone who is a \"mandatory reporter\" of child abuse Â— such as a teacher, social worker or psychologist Â— from eligibility for probation.\n\nIt was passed to hold educators and others in positions of power and influence over children to higher standards of accountability.\n\nBut the Register's review of such cases over the past five years revealed at least seven instances in which teachers served no prison time after being convicted of sex crimes involving children attending their schools. Some judges, prosecutors and defense attorneys acknowledged the mistakes, which they said resulted from misunderstandings involving the sentencing requirements for such cases.\n\nLegal experts said discovery of the mistakes could prompt courts to set aside the sentencing agreements or retry the cases.\n\nThe most recent cases:\n\nÂ• Cherokee physical education teacher Chad Osler was accused of having sex with a student over a three-year period before his arrest in 2015. In July, a judge waived his 10-year prison term for third-degree sex abuse and instead ordered him to serve five years of probation. The victim was no more than 15 years old in 2013 when the conduct began, according to court documents.\n\nÂ• A Floyd County judge waived 10 years of prison and sentenced Pella band instructor Ben Thompson to five years of probation in April. Thompson was accused of sexually abusing a student 14 or 15 years old, court records show.\n\nÂ• Remsen-Union teacher Samantha Kohls in April was sentenced to one year of probation after pleading guilty to lascivious conduct with a minor. The case involved sex with a 17-year-old student. After probation, her conviction could be expunged.\n\nState Court Administrator David Boyd recently alerted county attorneys and chief judges in all eight Iowa judicial districts about the sentencing errors the Register identified and reminded them of the requirements.\n\nMandatory reporters are generally licensed professionals in education or health care who have frequent contact with children or dependent adults in the course of their work. The law requires they notify the Iowa Department of Human Services within 24 hours after learning of potential abuse.\n\nAll of the cases examined during the review involved victims under 18 years old and educators convicted under Chapter 709, the state's sex abuse law. That statute, passed in 1997, states that mandatory reporters who are themselves convicted of sex abuse are not eligible for so-called Â“deferredÂ” or Â“suspendedÂ” sentences.\n\nÂ“How they get by that, I have no idea,Â” said Nancy Wells, director of the Iowa Chapter of Children's Advocacy Centers, a group associated with Iowa health providers that helps provide training and advocacy against abuse.\n\nConfusion and oversight\n\nThe Register attempted to reach prosecutors, judges and defense attorneys involved in each case it reviewed.\n\nDuring Kohls' sentencing in April, District Court Judge Jeffrey Neary said, Â“ There's not much more that I can do as far as a penalty,Â” a court transcript shows.\n\nNeary told the Register in August that he wasn't aware of the nuances of the law as it pertains to mandatory reporters. He said he largely relies on the recommendations of prosecutors and discussed sentencing options for Kohls with Plymouth County Attorney Darin Raymond in a parking lot.\n\nÂ“Legitimately, I have not studied or looked at that specific statute as to that mandatory versus discretionary reporter,Â” Neary said. Â“Frankly, I don't think I was probably aware of that distinction or that nuance until probably after that.Â”\n\nIn a separate interview, Raymond told the Register he didn't believe Kohls should be considered a mandatory reporter because the victim was not her direct student.\n\nÂ“She was a middle school teacher, and he was a high school honors student. He never had her as teacher,Â” Raymond said.\n\nHowever, Scott Brown, an assistant Iowa attorney general, said the sentencing requirement for mandatory reporters is not predicated on whether the victim is directly under the educator's supervision.\n\nRaymond also said the male victim asked that Kohls receive the lightest possible sentence, and that, too, factored into the sentencing recommendation.\n\nDes Moines defense attorney F. Montgomery Brown represented two former teachers whose cases were among those the Register reviewed. He acknowledged the sentencing errors.\n\nÂ“I think there was a mistake on all three parts: the attorney general's office, me and the judge. None of us knew about it, frankly,Â” Brown said when discussing Drew Lipovac, a former Winterset teacher convicted in 2012 of sexual exploitation by a school employee and sentenced to two years of probation.\n\nAfter probation, public records erased\n\nThe Register's review also revealed multiple instances in which educators accused of sexually assaulting students were granted deferred judgments, something that's also prohibited under Chapter 709.\n\nOffenders receiving such sentences are placed on probation. Those who complete probation without further violations can then petition the courts to have the charges dismissed and the records sealed from public view.\n\nCarlisle High School band teacher Alex Dyer, for example, is eligible to ask the court to remove from his criminal record any mention that he sexually assaulted a 17-year-old student. Dyer was sentenced to five years of probation and a deferred judgment after pleading guilty in September 2011.\n\nDoug Eichholz, an assistant Warren County attorney, said his lack of awareness of Chapter 709 sentencing requirements contributed to the error. But he also said a sentencing chart published by the state's judicial branch suggested that offenders such as Dyer were eligible for no prison time.\n\nThe chart's footnotes, however, warn prosecutors to check Chapter 709 for exceptions to the guide.\n\nEichholz also noted that statutes pertaining to sexual assaults are in a different chapter than the one that discusses sentencing restrictions for mandatory reporters.\n\n\"That doesn't excuse me,\" he said. \"I'm not trying to throw anyone under the bus. But that's some of the confusion of what I relied on.Â”\n\nLaw's author: Intent is clear\n\nWayne Ford, a former state representative from Des Moines, sponsored the 1997 legislation after a female teacher avoided prison despite being convicted of having sex with a male student.\n\nHe believes the Legislature should consider whether there are ways to simplify Â— but not weaken Â— the mandatory reporter law to avoid mistakes such as those uncovered by the Register.\n\nÂ“This is emotional,Â” Ford said during a recent interview. Â“That was my first bill, and it was a good bill. It means that if you're a teacher, you can't have sex with children or you're going to prison. Period. And that's not being enforced? Give me a break!Â”\n\nThe Iowa Attorney General's Office declined to discuss specific cases, but said if the victim was a juvenile when the act took place, those convicted of such crimes must face prison time and are ineligible for deferred judgments allowing the charges to be dismissed after serving probation.\n\nBrown, the assistant attorney general, made that point publicly in 2013 when Ashley Nicole Anderson, a teacher at Aplington-Parkersburg High School, was sentenced to five years in prison for having sex with three students. There is no way a school employee convicted of sexually exploiting a student can avoid prison under Iowa law, he said.\n\nBrown reiterated that position during an interview last month. He said the cases reviewed by the Register are likely the result of errors by prosecutors or judges.\n\nÂ“It's not like you sit down and memorize a code book,Â” he said. Â“I think there are some prosecutors who don't know it and that may be why you're seeing some of these sentences.Â”\n\nSentences could be vacated\n\nThe legal implications behind the state's failure to follow the law are murky.\n\nBrown said anyone with Â“standingÂ” in the case can ask the court to correct what is believed to be an illegal sentence. That could include a judge, the Iowa Department of Corrections, prosecutors or the defense.\n\nIf that were to happen, it's likely that the defendant's plea would be rescinded, and the case could essentially be prosecuted anew, Brown said.\n\nBut Brown said he believes the issue falls under the so-called Â“law of the caseÂ” principle. That's where a court's actions Â— even if wrong Â— would stand.\n\nBob Rigg, criminal law professor at Drake University, said several things could factor into what might happen next in the seven cases identified by the Register and any others that prosecutors might later determine were the result of similar sentencing errors.\n\nDefendants must be informed about the possible consequences of agreeing to a plea deal, which likely didn't occur in all or some of those cases. That could mean the original pleas would be vacated and could result in new trials, he said.\n\nÂ“I've been looking at case law, and I just don't think this specific issue has been raised,Â” Rigg said.\n\nNo prison, but no teaching license, either\n\nNone of the teachers benefiting from sentencing errors that allowed them to avoid prison sentences after being convicted of sexually abusing students is back in an Iowa classroom, records show.\n\nState rules mandate a teacher's license must be permanently revoked if he or she is convicted of sex abuse. The license generally remains on hold until the conclusion of a criminal case. The board's final action can lag months after a conviction, noted Ann Lebo, director of the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners.\n\nAll but two of the teachers' licenses have been revoked.\n\nTeachers are technically allowed to continue teaching while an ethics complaint associated with a criminal charge is pending. However, once convicted of sex abuse, the teachers are generally added to the Iowa Sex Offender Registry. That means they are legally prohibited from teaching immediately following conviction regardless of the board's final action, Lebo noted.\n\nThe license of Ben Thompson, the former Pella band instructor who was sentenced in April, is good until August 2018. And the license of former Cherokee physical education teacher Chad Osler expired in March. Both are on the sex offender registry, which would preclude them from teaching again.\n\nSentencing errors in other teacher cases\n\nAt least two other Iowa teachers were placed on probation after being convicted of sex crimes involving students in recent years, records show, despite an Iowa law requiring prison sentences for teachers and other mandatory reporters convicted of such offenses.\n\nWaterloo West High School teacher Brett Messenger was convicted in 2012 of sexual exploitation by a school employee after he was accused of having sex with a student. District Court Judge Andrea Dryer waived his five-year prison term and instead sentenced him to five years of probation. The victim was described in court records as being between the ages of 14 and 17. Dryer did not return phone calls seeking comment.\n\nWilliam Foulkes, a teacher at C.A.M. High School, pleaded guilty in 2012 to two counts of sexual exploitation by a school employee. The school is part of a unified school district serving the Cass County communities of Cumberland, Anita and Messina in southwest Iowa. District Court Judge Greg Steensland dismissed 48 of 50 sex abuse charges against Foulkes, waived two years of prison time and ordered two years of probation on each of the two counts, which were to run consecutively. The victim was 13 or younger, records show. Steensland said he is not certain what the mandatory reporter law required in such cases and would need to review the issue further.\n\nhttp://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/investigations/2016/09/03/7-iowa-teachers-guilty-sex-abuse-get-no-prison-time/89099598/\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nGeorgia\n\nCombating the bullying problem\n\nby Judy Gilreath\n\nParents have the right to expect their children will be safe at school.\n\nIn recent years, we have installed cameras, locked outside doors, employed school resource officers and practiced what to do in case an intruder intends to harm our students and teachers. As educators, we take keeping our students safe very seriously! However, there is one threat to students in our schools we may not even realize is there.\n\nThis dangerous threat is bullying. It is difficult to catch the offender in the act, and teachers often have to rely on conflicting information from two students. These \"he said, she said\" situations make it hard for teachers to get the facts. Bullying is especially dangerous because all children involved may have lasting and serious problems.\n\nBullies are not always stronger or bigger than their victims. They are not always the student who misbehaves. In fact, they may be so well behaved the teacher doesn't realize they are even capable of bullying. Most bullies do not practice their craft when adults are present, choosing instead to wait until there are no witnesses.\n\nSome forms of bullying such as pushing and shoving are easy to detect and correct, while other types are notoriously difficult to catch.\n\nEmotional bullying is more common than physical bullying today, mostly in the form of threats, spreading rumors or deliberately excluding a student from a group of his peers. Cyber-bullying, which is using the computer to say hurtful things or post threats or rumors online through outlets such as Facebook or Twitter, may happen outside of school hours but still have a dramatic impact on children at school.\n\nYou may think bullying would diminish as a child matures, but research studies show there is noticeably more bullying in middle school than in elementary or high school. The bully may believe that bullying other students will boost his own social status and make him popular. Research indicates bullies may continue the trend of abuse and violence as adults. By the age of 30, approximately 40 percent of boys identified as bullies in middle school have been arrested three times or more.\n\nParents are usually the first to notice signs their child is being bullied at school. Symptoms may include changes in appetite, complaints of being too sick to go to school, declining grades and inability to sleep at night. If your child is skipping classes, missing the bus on purpose or asking to change schools, there may be an issue with bullying.\n\nListen to your children. If you think they're being bullied, schedule a conference with the teacher, your best ally to ensure the bullying is stopped. Support your children, but do not tell them to solve the problem themselves or just to walk away. They often don't know why they are being bullied, and if they could handle it themselves, they would have already done so. Tell your children it is important and safe to let the teacher know when it happens. Some students hesitate because they don't want to be accused of tattling, but bullying cannot be stopped by ignoring it.\n\nWe begin teaching students in elementary school about the effects of bullying and how they can make a difference and stop bullying in their schools. Twelve Whitfield County Schools have implemented Olweus, a research-based approach proven to be effective in combating bullying. Children learn why bullying is wrong and how to effectively speak up against it.\n\nWe also use a state promoted program called PBIS (Positive Behavior Intervention Strategies), which emphasizes the need for respecting others and their differences.\n\nIn spite of the school's best efforts, bullying can take place.\n\nSchools need parents to report suspicions of bullying whether it be physical, emotional or cyber-bullying. Discuss bullying with your children and ask if they have ever experienced it or have seen it happen to another student. Also, remember that children are children and at times, any child can act as a bully under the right circumstances, even yours.\n\nJudy Gilreath is superintendent of Whitfield County Schools.\n\nhttp://www.daltondailycitizen.com/opinion/columns/combating-the-bullying-problem/article_c375b5b9-4b1b-5c11-9c72-20262116d111.html\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFlorida\n\n(Video on site)\n\nJudge who berated and jailed a domestic abuse victim gets her day in courtÂ—and it's not pretty\n\nby Leslie Salzillo\n\nAppointed to the bench in 2005 by then-Governor Jeb Bush, the Florida County Judge Jerri Collins found herself in front of the Florida Supreme Court on Wednesday, being publicly reprimandedÂ—live on TV. This was Judge Collins' penalty for her repugnant treatment of a domestic abuse victim who failed to show up to her abuser's trial. Josie Duffy with Daily Kos reported on this story in October of 2015:\n\nThe woman [domestic violence victim] called for help in April 2015, stating that the father of her child choked her and threatened her with a knife. After he was arrested, the woman began having serious anxiety about the incident. According to recently uncovered video evidence obtained by WFTV, \"she told the state's victim's advocate that she wanted to drop the charges and move on with her life rather than testify, but she was still called in to court.\"\n\nDuffy notes many domestic violence victims are often afraid and anxious about attending the trial of their abusers. The victim in this case said it was anxiety that caused her not to show up. In response, Judge Jerri Collins told the victim:\n\n\"You think you're going to have anxiety now? You haven't even seen anxiety.\"\n\nThe victim replied:\n\n\"I'm just not in a good place right now.\"\n\nÂ“I'm homeless now. I'm living at my parents' house,Â” the woman said as she sobbed. Â“Everything has been shut off. I just sold everything I own.Â”\n\nCollins responded with veracious scorn:\n\n\"And violating your court order did not do anything for you. I find you in contempt of court. I hereby sentence you to three days in the county jail,\" said the judge.\n\n?While being taken into custody the victim cried out:\n\nÂ“Judge, I'll do anything. Please, please!Â” the woman begged. Â“I have a 1-year-old son and I'm trying to take care of him by myself. I'm begging you, please, please!Â”\n\nCollins was unmoved. The victim was sentenced to three days in jail. Her abuser got 16 days.\n\nThe Washington post reports a plea deal was reached earlier this year with a state agency that Â“policesÂ” judges and Collins agreed to a public reprimand, but in July, the state Supreme Court issued an order stating a public reprimand was not a sufficient punishment. Collins was ordered to complete a courses in anger management and a course in domestic violence, even though as a judge, she had legal authority to jail the domestic violence.\n\nCollins was told her behavior was Â“intolerable.Â” Some excerpts from the public reprimand include:\n\n\"You found the victim in contempt of court and send her to spend three days in jail even though the victim pleaded with you that she needed to take care of a one-year-old child.Â”\n\n\"The victim apologized for failing to appear, citing anxiety, depression and a desire to move on from contact with her abuser as reasons why she did not appear for trial. Meanwhile, Judge Collins, you raised your voice, used sarcasm, spoke harshly and interrupted the victim.Â”\n\n\"We order you to complete and anger management course and attend a domestic violence course provided by the Florida Judicial College. We further ordered you appear hear today to be publicly reprimanded, on live television, so that the people of Florida know and understand that conduct such as yours will not be tolerated.\"\n\n\"Judge Collins, this is indeed a sad day for you, a sad day for the people of Florida and a sad day for the judiciary upon which our people depend for justice. I cannot emphasize enough how intolerable your behavior was in this case.Â”\n\nGood. More of this, please. It's too bad former Florida District Attorney Angela Corey wan't publicly reprimanded for her treatment of single mother and domestic violence victim Marissa Alexander, who fired a shot into the air to keep her serial abuser husband from attacking her and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Florida has a long way to go. This is hopefully the start of new direction. No victim of domestic violence should ever be treated so cruel and disrespectfully. Ever.\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: Please see the original article for the video of Judge Jerri Collins being publicly reprimanded for berating a domestic violence victim.\n\nIf you are being abused, or know someone who is, there is help.

We visited her in her Utah home to learn more about her advocacy.\n\n\"I didn't talk about being raped; I didn't talk about being sexually abused,\" says Elizabeth Smart, nestled into a large outdoor sofa on the sun-soaked patio of her spacious home in Park City, Utah. \"It's hard to come forward. That's probably one of the hardest things that I've ever had to do: to say, 'I was raped.'\"\n\nIt's been 14 years since Elizabeth Smart, then 14 years old, was kidnapped from the bedroom she shared with her younger sister in their childhood home, in the posh Federal Heights neighborhood of Salt Lake City. Fourteen years since she was awakened by a familiar-seeming stranger, with cold metal pressed to her neck and the following words: \"I have a knife at your neck. Don't say a word. Get out of bed and come with me.\" Fourteen years since she was led away into the night, forced to hike miles up into the mountains behind her home, not to be seen again until just over nine months later, when an alert citizen recognized the face of her captor, Brian David Mitchell, from a recently aired segment of the television show America ' s Most Wanted and made the 911 call that would end her \"nine months of hell.\"\n\nThe particulars of Elizabeth's captivity have been the subject of much media fascination since the moment that her safe return was announced on breaking news: the metal cable bolted around her ankle that kept her chained to a tree in the hills behind her house for months before Mitchell began allowing her to accompany him down into the city; the white linen robes and head coverings she was forced to wear as a disguise; the polygamous marriage ceremony Mitchell performed, sealing Elizabeth to him as a wife for all eternity; the biblical name he insisted on calling herÂ—Shear-Jashub, meaning the remnant who will return.\n\nIn the infrequent interviews she gave during those initial years back homeÂ—years when she was still just a teenager trying to make it through high schoolÂ—Elizabeth did not discuss the specifics of what she'd endured, focusing instead on her early work advocating for other missing children. In perhaps her most notorious television appearance from those early years, Elizabeth appeared on Headline News with Nancy Grace in 2006 to speak about a national sex offender registry bill that she was championing, and instead was ambushed by Grace's inane and invasive questions about the burqa Elizabeth's captors made her wear in public and whether she ever wanted to scream for help.\n\nIn 2013, seven years after the Nancy Grace interview and two years after her captor was sentenced to life in prison, Elizabeth published her first book, a memoir called My Story, which was co-written with Chris Stewart, a Republican congressman from her home state. In the book, Elizabeth reveals in her own words, for the first time, every painful detail of her abduction and captivity: extended periods of starvation and thirst, threats of death for herself and her family, and daily rape.\n\nThe trauma of the sexual violence that Elizabeth endured was made even worse, she says, by the fact that she was raised in a deeply religious household that prioritized abstinence.\n\n\"I was raised that way,\" says Elizabeth, who will be 29 this November, referring to her Mormon upbringing. \"I did make that promise to myself that I was going to wait until marriage before I had sex... Well, then I was kidnapped and I was raped, and one of the first thoughts I had was, No one is ever going to want to marry me now: I'm worthless, I'm filthy, I'm dirty. I think every rape survivor feels those same feelings, but having that with the pressure of faith compounded on topÂ—it was almost crippling.\"\n\nElizabeth regularly travels across the country, speaking at universities and lecture series, to share the story of her kidnapping, sexual abuse, and survival. It is fascinating to watch past interviews and speechesÂ–Â–many of them have been uploaded to YouTubeÂ–Â–because as Elizabeth has matured, so, too, has her message.\n\n\"Sometimes when I tell [my story], and I'm thinking about it, it just feels like a different life... Almost like faraway dream,\" she tells me. \"I know it happened to me, but part of me is like, Did that really happen to me? Just because I think I've come so far since then, and I've just done so much. Sometimes it feels like it's a completely different life.\"\n\nMost surprising for those who have come to see her as the poster girl for Mormon modesty is that she is taking the church to task on some of its more sexist teachings. \"I think the power of faith is amazing, the hope and the healing that it can bring to people,\" says Elizabeth, who credits her everlasting faith for the strength she had to survive Mitchell's abuse. \"But I also think there's another side of it that can be potentially very harmful, especially when a lot of religions teach that sexual relations are meant for marriage... It's so stressed that girls in particular tie their worth to their virginity, or, for lack of a better word, purity.\"\n\nShe often shares, as an example of what not to teach young girls, an analogy that she learned as a young child in Sunday school: \"You're like this stick of gum, and if you have sex before you're married, it's like someone chews up that piece of gum, and then when you're done, who wants a piece of gum that's already chewed up? No one.\" That was the first thing she thought of after Mitchell raped her on the night of her kidnapping.\n\nUnbelievably, ever after Elizabeth was rescued, she was still made to sit through these lessons a few times a year, as a high-schooler in religious seminary classes. \"You're like this beautiful fence,\" she remembers being told in class after she'd returned home. \"And you hammer these nails in, and then every time you have sex with someone else, it's like you're hammering in another nail. And you can take them out, you can repent of them, but the holes are still there.\"\n\nElizabeth shakes her head. \"I just remember thinking, This is terrible. Do they not realize I'm sitting in class? Do they not realize that I'm listening to what they're saying? Those are terrible analogies. No one should use them, period,\" she says. \"Especially for someone who's been raped, they've already felt these feelings of worthlessness, of filth, of justÂ—\" she lets out an exasperated sigh \"Â—of just being so crushed, and then to hear a teacher come back and say, 'Nobody wants you now'... You just think, I should just die right now. \"\n\nShe says she knows that her teachers never meant any of this with malice, but \"statistically speaking, I'm not the only girl that's ever been raped. And those kinds of analogies, they stick with people.\" At that time, though, she still wasn't speaking up about her own rapeÂ—and wouldn't for several more years, until she testified at the trial of her kidnappers.\n\n\"The way we talk about [sex and abstinence] needs to change,\" she continues. \"People need to realize there is nothing that can detract from your worth. When it comes to rape and sexual violence and abuse, that can never detract from who you are.\"\n\nIn writing and talking about sexual violence, people must make a linguistic choice in describing someone who has endured an assault: victim or survivor. Elizabeth uses both terms seemingly interchangeably, as in \"rape victim\" or \"survivor of sexual assault.\" Though she uses both words, Elizabeth maintains that they're not synonymous. \"I don't think they're the same thing; I think they are different stages, actually,\" she says. \"A victim is someone who is still going through the abuse, and a survivor is someone who survived it. I'm not saying that they don't have hard moments still, or things to work through, but it's more about making that choice: that they want to survive, that they no longer want to remain the victim and they're taking the steps to move on in their life.\"\n\n\"I'm not saying it's easy,\" she adds, careful not to minimize anyone's path to recovery.\n\nIt should be noted that Elizabeth's Instagram bio is, rather poignantly, \"Survivor. Mother. Wife.\" She met a Mormon Scotsman, Matthew Gilmour, while serving an 18-month LDS Mission in Paris; the two later married. Their February 2012 wedding, at the BYU-Hawaii Mormon temple, made the cover of People magazine. Three years later, their daughter Chloe Rose was born.\n\nIn 2013, when My Story came out, the New Yorker published a profile of Elizabeth by Margaret Talbot, then the most thorough update on her life. Buried down several thousand words in was one of the most surprising elements in this piece about a champion of women; it's a quote from a women named Kristine Haglund, who is the editor of a journal on Mormonism. She says of Elizabeth, \"She's entirely faithful. And while she's not part of the feminist ferment in Mormonism, and I doubt she'd call herself a feminist, she is strong in a way that feminists can admire.\"\n\nAnyone who is familiar with the Mormon church knows that it has an interesting relationship with the concept of feminism. As Kate Kelly, a feminist activist who was excommunicated from the faith in 2014 for advocating for the ordination of women into the LDS priesthood, puts it, \"The primary reason that Mormon women are very reluctant to identify as feminist is that it is explicitly taboo in the culture. The church explicitly considers feminists to be enemies.\"\n\nThis puts Elizabeth Smart in a very strange position. She is a champion of victims of sexual violence, a hero for so many survivors, and an outspoken critic of religious purity culture. By all accounts, she is a feminist in the truest sense of the term.\n\n\"What I see in feminism is people like Elizabeth, who stand up for women and women's rights,\" says Bre Lasley, 27, a Mormon woman who survived a brutal attack in her own home and founded the organization Fight Like Girls to empower girls and women to fight back, physically and emotionally, against any struggle they're faced with. Bre says she thought of Elizabeth and her kidnapping during the six-minute attack, which left her with five separate four-inch deep stab wounds to her lower abdomen and leg. The two women have recently teamed up and begun to work together. \"For a long time I thought feminism was a negative thing, and I don't know why,\" Bre tells me over Skype.\n\nLater, I ask Elizabeth whether she identifies with the term or rejects it, as the New Yorker piece would suggest. At first, she equivocates. \"I think there are so many different kinds of feminismÂ—some good, some maybe too extremeÂ—it's a wonderful thing for women to come together, to be strong, to be independent, to have equal rights as human beings... There shouldn't be a glass ceiling,\" she says, sort of talking around the question. \"At the same time, I like it when a man holds the door open for me, and I like it when I'm treated like a lady. I mean... I'm married, I have a husband, I have a family.\"\n\nGiven the Mormon church's antagonistic view of the movement, her discomfort with the label makes sense; still, believing inÂ—and actively campaigning forÂ—equality between men and women is pretty much the definition of feminism. When I tell her this, Elizabeth seems to casually change her position. \"I've never thought of myself as a feminist before... Sure, call me a feminist,\" she says.\n\nAlthough she may not have previously aligned herself with the feminist movement, Elizabeth has devoted a great deal of time to speaking out about how women suffer under hardline religious rules. In her first episode since being named a correspondent on the syndicated TV news program Crime Watch Daily , Elizabeth sat down with two of the women who reported being raped at Brigham Young UniversityÂ—where Elizabeth studied harp performance before being called away on the Paris missionÂ—and were punished for violating an honor code that prohibits students from having sex.\n\n\"I don't have a problem with [the honor code],\" Elizabeth tells me, reasoning that if you decide to go to a particular school, you are agreeing to abide by their rules, and there's nothing wrong with electing to live by a certain level of standards. \"But I do think there are situations that happen that are outside of a person's control. And because of the honor code, [these rape victims] are scared to come forward because it can jeopardize their status at school... Plus, then it goes back to the religious stigma, because BYU is a church-owned school.\" These situations should be handled gently, she believes, and on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe Crime Watch episode, and her interviews with the women who came forward, received a considerable amount of attention, as is often the case when Elizabeth speaks out against, well, just about anything. As Margaret Talbot suggested in her New Yorker profile, Elizabeth really is universally admired. When she speaks, people listen, Mormon or not.\n\nAs Elizabeth pauses to eat her lunch (a Smucker's Uncrustables peanut butter and grape jelly sandwich) we talk about how it isn't just BYU that has a campus rape problem. \"It makes me so mad,\" she says of all of the stories that have been in the news lately, like at Stanford and the University of Colorado. \"It just makes me so angry. I guess it's a good thing I'm not a judge, because I don't think any of them would ever see the light of day.\" She tells me she read the now famous letter that the Stanford rape victim wrote to her rapist, Brock Turner: \"It broke my heart, made me angry, made me sick.\"\n\nWhen I meet Elizabeth for lunch the next day, at a Park City barbecue restaurant, she is accompanied by her 18-month-old daughter and looks every bit the casual young mother, in a teal V-neck tee shirt, knee-length grey shorts, black slip-on sneakers, and a backpack full of baby things. There are blue and red crayons on the table, and Elizabeth draws a flower on a paper napkin, hoping to entice Chloe with a kid-friendly distraction so that we can pick up where we left off the day before. It works a little bit, but Chloe, who is \"just full of wiggles,\" is more interested in the other booths, so we both keep one eye on the toddler while we talk.\n\n\"I'm not going to hide anything from her,\" says Elizabeth. \"Of course, I want to maintain and protect her innocence as long as possible, but with that being said, I think it's a disservice to not talk to children [about sex].\"\n\nElizabeth wants to ensure that Chloe never struggles with the sense of shame she did. \"I don't want her to be scared; I want her to be prepared, and to know that she has options, and if she wants to talk about what happened to me, that's fine,\" she affirms. \"I'll be happy to talk about it with her.\"\n\nAfter lunch we go to a nearby park, so that Chloe can play while we talk some more. It's the most public place that we've visited together (the restaurant was fairly empty, and we sat inside on a sunny day, avoiding pedestrian traffic). I wonder aloud whether Elizabeth still gets recognized, and how often.\n\n\"All the time,\" she says. \"A lot of times people won't know where they recognize me fromÂ—like, they'll recognize me, but they can't always place me. And then there are people who know immediately, right away, who I am... They come up and they'll say something like, 'I'm not going to bother you, but I appreciate what you're doing,' or 'I appreciate all that you talk about.'\"\n\nShe has moved on, it would seem, from being recognized for what happened to her to being recognized for the advocacy work that she does. \"I've become so much more than just my kidnapping and what happened,\" she says. Victim, survivor.\n\n\"It's nice to hear that you're appreciated,\" she tells me. \"That's certainly not why I do it, but it is nice.\"\n\nThe park is full of children and adults, and Chloe runs off often, to various play structures, to the slides, to a set of steps which lead her to a bridge that is fairly high for someone who is only about two feet tall. Elizabeth keeps her eye on Chloe and grabs her when she goes too far out of sight, but less frequently than you might imagine for someone who survived a childhood kidnapping. On one of these retrieval missions, she is stopped by a group of young mothers and stands talking to them for a few minutes at the edge of the park. \"Well, speak of the devil,\" she says to me, as she walks back with Chloe in tow: These women had recognized her and wanted to express their admiration.\n\n\"A lot of victims or survivors, they want to go back to being normal,\" she says, pushing her daughter gently in a swing.

Murphy excoriates the private Episcopal boarding school in Middletown for allowing unchecked abuse in the past, primarily in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nThe systemic abuse first came to light in December.\n\nThough \"some concrete steps\" were taken to protect students, \"in the 1970s and 1980s, St. George's leaders did little, and certainly not enough,\" Murphy's report states. \"Fortunately, the school \"is certainly a very different place now,\" one that promotes a culture of respect,\" and reports abuse to authorities.\n\n\"Many of these students remember St. George's as a place where their abusers created a kind of private hell for them Â— a place where they suffered trauma and emotional wounds that for many, remain unhealed,\" Murphy wrote.\n\n\"The abuse they experienced involved not only physical acts of sexual assault (as horrible as those were), but something that, for many, was even worse: betrayal at the hands of an adult entrusted with their care, at a school where they saw few, if any places to turn for help.\"\n\nMurphy, partner at the law firm of Foley Hoag in Boston, was hired jointly in late January by St. George's and SGS for Healing, an alumni survivors group.\n\nThey hired him after SGS for Healing contested the independence of Will Hannum, whom the school hired to conduct its own investigation in 2015: Hannum was married to a lawyer who was simultaneously \"advising the school about how to respond to demands relating to past sexual abuse.\"\n\nMurphy noted that \"under those circumstances, calling Hannum's investigation 'independent' without further explanation was seriously misleading.\"\n\nMurphy and a team of lawyers interviewed more than 150 witnesses, including 128 former students, and reviewed \"thousands of pages of documents.\" They covered a time frame from 1960 to the present.\n\nIt said most of the abuse took place under three administrators who served during the period 1961-1989: Archer Harman Jr., Anthony (\"Tony\") Zane and the Rev. George Andrews II.\n\nThe report credits outgoing headmaster Eric F. Peterson with trying to push an investigation in 2011 that met with push-back by board members and legal counsel.\n\nIt also exonerated Robert Weston, the school's director of external affairs, who was put on leave in January based on allegations of inappropriate conduct.\n\nMurphy wrote: \"We have found no evidence suggesting Weston engaged in any inappropriate physical conduct with students.\" He added, \"We see no reason why Robert Weston should not be returned to St. George's as a faculty member in good standing,\" but noted that ultimately, the question of Weston's future \"is a decision for the school.\"\n\nThe abusers\n\nBased on multiple first-hand accounts and corroborated single-hand accounts, the report identifies six faculty or staff members who committed sexual abuse on students between 1970 and 1989. Investigators received \"nine credible first-hand accounts of student-on-student sexual assault\" during that time frame.\n\nThe six staff and faculty are: William Anthony Lydgate Jr. and Timothy H. Tefft, both former English teachers; the Rev. Howard \"Howdy\" White Jr., former associate chaplain, teacher, dorm parent and coach; former athletic trainer Alphonse \"Al\" Gibbs, now deceased; former choir director Franklin Coleman, and Susan Goddard, a part-time nurse. (Three were previously identified).\n\nOne in five female students who attended the school between 1972 and 1979 Â— 31 altogether Â— reported abuse by Gibbs alone.\n\nIt tells of the Â“bullyingÂ” of Anne Scott, co-founder of SGS for Healing, after Gibbs raped her in the 1970s, and she brought charges against the school.\n\nIt reveals that after former Headmaster Tony Zane discovered that Gibbs had been molesting girls and terminated him, Zane and the St. George's Board gave Gibbs a favorable letter of recommendation and a distinguished service $1,200 annual award that continued until Gibbs' death 16 years later.\n\nZane terminated White in 1974 after he said White admitted \"sexually abusing a sophomore boy and attempting to sexually abuse at least two and likely three others.\" (White remains under criminal investigation in North Carolina based on allegations from two people against him).\n\nColeman, like Gibbs, \"sexually abused at least one student in each year of his tenure at the school,\" between 1980-1988, Murphy's report states.\n\nGoddard \"engaged in sexual misconduct with a male St. George's student when the boy was a junior and a senior.\"\n\nTefft was dismissed after only four months in 1971, \"evidently for supplying alcohol to the hockey team over winter break,\" and sexually abusing a sophomore boy. He is in prison in New Jersey on child pornography charges.\n\nLydgate \"sexually assaulted and orally raped at least one student and likely at least one other.\"\n\n'Private hell'\n\nThe report details each victim's experience with their abusers. Some victims were identified by name, others by their \"Witness\" number. Student perpetrators were unnamed.\n\nMany reported \"victim-shaming\" by school authorities.\n\nSome of Gibbs' victims recounted times where the athletic trainer, dressed in a lab coat with the embroidery Â“Doc Gibbs,Â” taught them how to Â“properly dry their breastsÂ” and performed exams, sometimes sticking fingers in their vaginas.\n\nOthers reported that White forced students to share a bed with him and warned that he would \"make ... life here miserable\" if they told; that Coleman took a student out of state on college visits and rubbed the child's genitals while he slept in the car's passenger seat.\n\nAround 2004, multiple students reported that Charles Thompson, an English teacher, displayed a fetish for boys' knees. Thompson often stroked and commented on what he referred to as the boys' \"sailor's knees.\"\n\n(The report suggests that \"it would have been more prudent\" for then-headmaster Peterson to fire Thompson instead of putting him on suspension because his conduct \"was sufficiently far enough outside the bounds of acceptable conduct as to call into question his fitness to serve as a teacher or staff member at a school where he would regularly interact with adolescent boys\").\n\nPeterson also neglected to look at Thompson's personnel file, which revealed he'd been reprimanded previously for wrestling with boys at the school, Murphy's report found. Nor did he ask to see Thompson's computer to see whether it Â“contained images, taken from a webcam, of the Wheeler dorm boys.\"\n\nStudent-on-student hazing assaults included the experience of \"Witness 78, Class of 1976.\"\n\nWitness 78 described how she was walking through the boy's dormitory on her way home, when a boy shouted \"Hey there, Little Red Riding Hood. I'm the Big Bad Wolf, and I'm going to eat you up.\" She ignored him, then later that night, he climbed through her window, smelling of alcohol, pulled off her pajamas and then raped her. He then bragged about it to girls in her dorm, her boyfriend and best friends.\n\nAnother student-on-student victim, one of a small group of female students of color, was attacked twice by other girls as she came out of the shower, including once when they wrote profanities on her body in permanent marker.\n\nThe following year, \"she was attacked by a group of approximately six girls, who pulled off her towel and attempted to insert the hose of a vacuum cleaner between her legs.\"\n\nThe report notes that one of the perpetrators \"took a photograph of the incident\" that she shared with the student, who in turn shared it with investigators. \"It contains a graphic depiction of [her] humiliation.\"\n\nReaction\n\nÂ“When one considers the ripple effects of sexual abuse Â— the corollary damage to parents, siblings, friends and other family members close to the victim Â— the amount of trauma inflicted on human beings is measured in the hundreds of years,Â” Scott said.\n\nEric MacLeish, co-counsel with Carmen L. Durso for the victims, called the report \"the most comprehensive account of sexual abuse in an American boarding school to date. It describes a trail of human carnage perpetrated by monsters posing as teachers and staff and, in some cases, by upper level students.\"\n\nMacLeish, who is a St. George's alumnus, said the school \"is a very different place than the way that it was in the 1970s and '80s, or even the way that it was in December before the [Boston] Globe's first story.\"\n\nHe noted that trustees \"could have buried their heads in the sand,\" but instead came together, listened to survivors, offered them therapy \"and included them in critical discussions about the school's future.\"\n\nBoard of Trustees Chair Leslie B. Heaney said Murphy's report was a Â“vital step for the communityÂ” but acknowledged there is still much work and reflecting to do in the coming months and years.\n\nZane, and his wife, Eusie, requested their names be removed from the girl's dormitory.\n\nÂ“My wife, Eusie, and I are deeply sorry to have learned that so many of our former students were put in harm's way on my watch, and I personally apologize for the harms inflicted during my tenure as Headmaster at St. George's,\" Zane wrote in a statement he issued Thursday.\n\nMurphy's report followed an undisclosed financial settlement, announced Aug. 3, that St. George's reached with at least 30 alumni whose abuse claims reach back to the 1970s.\n\nAnd in June, Rhode Island State Police announced that their criminal investigation found \"no prosecutable criminal misconduct,\" largely owing to statutes of limitations.\n\nShortly thereafter, Peterson announced he would not renew his contract next year.\n\nTo read the full report, go to: sgsinvestigation.com\n\nhttp://www.providencejournal.com/news/20160901/st-georges-sex-abuse-scandal-report-excoriates-school-for-decades-of-unchecked-abuse\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAlaska\n\nLetter to the Editor\n\nIn response to 'It takes a village to abuse a child'\n\nby Sheri Williams\n\nThe letters written by various community members in support of Thomas Jack Jr. and Mary Chessica Hauge shocked and dismayed me. The Juneau Empire Editorial Â“It takes a village to abuse a childÂ” compelled me, a victim of child sexual abuse, to share my thoughts on this matter.\n\nThe prison sentence of 50 years (40 to be served) for Thomas Jack Jr. is a long jail sentence. But, consider the fact that Thomas promoted himself to the Office of Children Services as a safe foster placement for the children and then proceeded to abuse the older child. And consider that since Jack is not repentant for his crime, he needs a long time to contemplate his wrongdoing. Unless Jack admits to his crime and seeks treatment, he would likely re-offend if released to society. I applaud the judge for wanting to protect children from Jack for a very long time.\n\nI want to recognize the courage of Mrs. Thomas Jack Jr. for calling the authorities and reporting this abuse. Sadly, sometimes the spouse in these circumstances fears the breakup of their home, public scrutiny (and sometimes scorn) and doesn't report the abuse. Mrs. Jack's instinct was to protect these children at great cost to herself. She's my hero in this case.\n\nThe prison sentence of 30 months in the case of Mary Chessica Hauge seems very short in comparison to the felony that she committed by leaving her children in the care of her husband, a known sex offender, who abused and filmed the children. Her conviction of eight felony counts of child endangerment surely should include a longer sentence on each count. This woman knew the children would be abused. It sounds more like she was an accessory to the crime.\n\nChildren who are sexually abused get a life sentence. They spend their entire lives with the knowledge of their abuse.\n\nChildren have a great need for security and they look to the adults in their lives to provide that. When they are abused by an adult, the child often feels shame and wonders why it is happening to them. Their need to make sense of it causes them to create compensatory explanations for the abuse: Â“I must have done something wrong for that to happen,Â” Â“I brought it on myself,Â” Â“I was bad.Â” With that narrative the child takes on the guilt for the abuse. And until and unless they get help to understand their vulnerability, they carry that guilt with them for years and sometimes to their graves. The guilt has toxic effects on their psyche and their self-esteem. They are much more likely to make poor choices in life, such as drug and alcohol addiction, teen pregnancy, homelessness, depression, suicide, and often, further victimization as adults by their partners.\n\nI volunteered as a Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) for 12 years representing the interests of children in state of Alaska custody. Often these children were removed from their homes due to neglect and abuse and placed in foster care until a final resolution of their future safety and well-being was ensured. I found that in many of my cases the mother of the abused children was the victim of sexual (and other) abuse as a child, as well. These mothers were experiencing the trauma of the unresolved grief from their abuse and carrying it forward with their children.\n\nWith all the horror sexual abuse wreaks on a victim, I ask you, Â“What kind of society do we want?Â” Do we support shorter sentences for unrepentant perpetrators? Or do we support a no-tolerance policy for sexually abusing children. And instead, do we as a society throw our collective arms around these innocent young victims and get them all the help they need to recover from this heinous crime?\n\nIn closing, I applaud the Juneau Empire for its reporting on this issue. In the mid-1980s, you published a series of articles about sexual abuse survivors. As I read them, I realized that my depression in adulthood was linked to my childhood experience of sexual assault. I finally sought help to heal from the deep wounds it caused. The articles changed my life for the better.\n\nThank you,\n\nSheri Williams\n\nhttp://juneauempire.com/letters/2016-09-02/letter-response-it-takes-village-abuse-child\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOhio\n\nHero or Murderer? 15-Year-Old Bresha Meadows Faces Life in Prison for Killing Abusive Father\n\nby Amy Goodman\n\nOn July 28, 14-year-old Bresha Meadows allegedly killed her father, Jonathan Meadows, with a bullet to his head as he slept. Only two months earlier, Bresha had run away from home, telling relatives that she was scared for her life Â”because her father was beating her mother and threatening to kill the whole family.\" Bresha's father reportedly made life for his family a living hell, routinely attacking his wifeÂ—Bresha's motherÂ—breaking her ribs, puncturing her blood vessels, blackening her eyes and slashing her body. Jonathan Meadows' siblings have denied allegations of domestic violence. His brother told Fox 8 News, \"This has nothing to do with abuse,\" and his sister Lena Cooper called his death \"cold and calculated.\" For more, we speak with freelance journalist Victoria Law, whose recent article for Rewire is \"What Bresha Meadows, Arrested for Shooting Her Father After Reported Abuse, Faces Next.\" And we speak with Bresha Meadows's aunt, Martina Latessa, and Bresha's lawyer Ian Friedman.\n\nThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: A young girl who shot dead her abusive father now may face life in prison, sparking national outcry over the treatment of domestic violence survivors. On July 28th, 14-year-old Bresha Meadows allegedly killed her father, Jonathan Meadows, with a bullet to his head as he slept. Only two months earlier, Bresha had run away from home, telling relatives she was scared for her life, quote, \"because her father was beating her mother and threatening to kill the whole family,\" unquote. This is Bresha's aunt, Sheri Latessa, speaking to WKBN in Cleveland.\n\nSHERI LATESSA: He controlled her, and it was like she was in jail. They've all been through it. And nobody in that county that we called would do anything for those kids. She told on him. You tell the kids to tell. And then, what happened? Nobody did anything. She told. She did what she was supposed to do. That this was wrongÂ—she even knew it was going wrong, what was going on her whole life, and nobody helped her. DAVE SESS: There is a murder charge against the child.\n\nSHERI LATESSA: Yeah, and that's ridiculous. She, if anything, did it for her mother. She definitely did it for her mother. She said, \"Now, mom, you're free.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Bresha's father, John Meadows, reportedly made life for his family a living hell, routinely attacking his wife, Bresha's mother, by breaking her ribs, puncturing her blood vessels, blackening her eyes and slashing her body. Meadows reportedly once punched his wife so hard that she heard her teeth crack. Later, she had to have those teeth removed. He also apparently slammed her head into the wall, stomped on her and kicked her in the face. Jonathan Meadows' siblings have denied allegations of domestic violence. His brother told Fox 8 News, \"This has nothing to do with abuse,\" and his sister Lena Cooper called his death \"cold and calculated.\" JAMES BLOUNT: He drank a little bit. He had the ways he did things. But my brother wouldÂ—I'll literally say, he would have given his life.\n\nLENA COOPER: This was cold and calculated. My brother was murdered. It was cold and calculated. He was murdered in his sleep. There was no signs of abuse.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: On Tuesday morning, supporters and family members gathered for Bresha's first pretrial hearing. Over 6,000 people have signed a petition calling on Trumbull County prosecutors to drop charges against the child. Bresha is being held in a juvenile detention center in Warren, Ohio, where she faces aggravated murder chargesÂ—a charge that could carry a life sentence if she's tried and convicted in adult court. Bresha just spent her 15th birthday behind bars. Well, for more, we're joined right now by three guests. In Cleveland, Ohio, we're joined by Martina Latessa, Bresha Meadows' aunt and a Cleveland police officer in the Domestic Violence Unit. We're also joined by Ian Friedman, a criminal defense attorney representing Bresha Meadows. He's an adjunct law professor at Cleveland-Marshall College of Law. And here in New York City we're joined by Victoria Law, freelance journalist, author of Resistance Behind Bars: The Struggles of Incarcerated Women. Her recent article for Rewire is headlined \"What Bresha Meadows, Arrested for Shooting Her Father After Reported Abuse, Faces Next.\" We welcome you all to Democracy Now! Victoria, just lay out this story for us. When did this happen? How old was Bresha? And talk about what's happened since.\n\nVICTORIA LAW: So, on July 28th, Bresha Meadows, who was then 14 years old, so a child, was arrested for allegedly shooting her abusive father in the head with a gun that he had used to threaten his family numerous times. So, she had endured years and years of abuse. According to Bresha's mother, the abuse had started when she was pregnant with her first child, who is now 21 years old, so she had endured decades of abuse. And this was aÂ—violence and threats and belittlement and ridicule were a constant in Bresha's house. She had run away twice. Her aunt had reported the abuse to child services. Nothing ever came of that. Her mother had tried to leave once before, and had even filed for an order of protection. As many of your viewers may know, in situations involving domestic violence, it often takes somebody seven to 10 times to leave before they are able to successfully leave their abuser. And as we've seen in many cases, leaving is often the most dangerous time, for a survivor and her family to leave an abuser.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And so, then explain the night that Bresha killed her father.\n\nVICTORIA LAW: So, Bresha's father was sleeping. He had come home earlier that day. She had gone into her room to avoid the abuse, from what I understand. And heÂ—when he went to sleepÂ—nobody is sure, and I don't know if her lawyer can give more details or wants to give more details at this time, since she is still pretrialÂ—he was sleeping, and she shot him with the gun that he used to threaten his family. And again, this isÂ—if you put yourself in the eyesÂ—in the shoes of a 14-year-old, she saw this as a last resort. Nobody else was helping her. The police weren't helping her. Child Protective Services weren't helping her. None of the adults in her life seemed to be able to help her and her family.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Ian Friedman, you're her criminal defense attorney. Can you talk about what happened in Tuesday's pretrial hearing? And how long has Bresha now been held in prison, in jail?\n\nIAN FRIEDMAN: Good morning, Amy, and thank you for having me on. But more than thatÂ—excuse meÂ—thank you for finding this issue to be so important. As we talk about it, it really is just such a tragedy. And what I have learned, even just in the short time I've been involved, is just how widespread this sort of violence is out there. So, I'm really glad we're talking about it this morning. Yesterday at the pretrial, what we did was we just exchanged evidenceÂ—the defense, the prosecution. We talk about where we're going with the case, potential resolutions. We set future dates. And we really are just discussing kind of the beginning of the procedure. So, Bresha has been in the juvenile detention center since that night, the night of the incident. She will remain in there at least until the next pretrial, which will be October 6th. And at that time, we'll revisit whether or not there is cause to have her released while the rest of the case remains pending.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: So how long has she been jailed at this point?\n\nIAN FRIEDMAN: She's been jailed now over a month; since the night of the incident, she's been in there.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Martina Latessa, you are Bresha's aunt. Can you talk about what you understood before that night?\n\nMARTINA LATESSA: I understand that there were mental abuse, physical abuse, psychological abuse, emotional abuse. The kids didn't get, you know, hitÂ—that was my sister Brandi who got thatÂ—but those kids had to watch that, including Bresha. They had to sit there, and he did cuss at them and call them names. From my understanding, Bresha wasn't even allowed to be in the same room as her father, once she ran away the second time. He would tell her, \"Get out of here. Go up in your room. Get out of my face. You know, you disgust me.\" My sister Brandi was abused, pushed around and punched and smacked and kicked, while all of her children watched. And it did take a toll on her. She did run away. And she, you know, told me about it, and she expressed great fear for herself and her family.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: I want to turn to your sister for a moment, to Brandi Meadows, Bresha's mother, who spoke to Fox 8 Cleveland. She called Bresha her hero.\n\nBRANDI MEADOWS: I'm sorry, Bresha. I love her. You're my hero. She helped us all. And she's my hero, our hero. And now we need to move forward and have us a better life.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: So, that's Brandi Meadows, who was beaten for a long time. Latessa, did you know aboutÂ—Martina, did you know about your sister, the abuse of your sister?\n\nMARTINA LATESSA: I found out about it in 2011, so around five years ago. She did go back, and that is normal for victims of domestic violence, to go back. You know, she loved him, and she wanted her family to be together. And she's told me in conversations he has told her, \"I'm not going to hit you anymore. We're going to be better.\" And she went back. And, you know, like, that's normal for domestic violence victims to do and experience. And it's hard for people who don't understand domestic violence, who don't live in it, who's never grown up in it, that that is where she's going toÂ—she's going to do that. And I'd explain that even to my own mom and my family, that, you know, it's normal. Even though it's hard for us to understand, it is normal in domestic violence.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: So, you're an expert in this. You're a police detective who deals with domestic violence?\n\nMARTINA LATESSA: I'm not an expert, but I doÂ—I am a detective in our Cleveland Police Domestic Violence Unit. I handle cases every day. I deal with victims every day, and advocates and, you know, prosecutors and judges every day.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Have you seen a case like this before?\n\nMARTINA LATESSA: No. Even in almost 17 years of being a police officer, I have never seen anything like this.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Can you tell us a little about Bresha? M\n\nARTINA LATESSA: You know, I don'tÂ—they were so isolated that I barely know them. I barely know my sister and her family. So, in 2011, when she ran away, we see them. And probably seven years before that, you know, we've seen them around Christmas time, when I went down there. But they were so isolated that I don't know them. But I do know, you know, the two times that Bresha ran away, and she came to me. She was a little girl. She was scared. She was asking me for help. You know, I took her thingsÂ—she came with no coat. I even remember I got her a little North Face jacket that she wanted. And then, when she got home, her father took it from her, told her he can't have anything that came from me. When she ran away the second time, I, you know, took her again. She didn't have anything. And we bought her stuff. And when she was told she had to go back, she was terrified. And she wouldn't even take hair conditioner back with her that I bought her, because she was afraid her dadÂ—what he would do if he found out she had something like that.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Did you know that at the time? Were you concerned?\n\nMARTINA LATESSA: Oh, I was very concerned. I didn't know that, like the jacket incident and how he felt, until she ran away again in May ofÂ—the end of May of 2016, this year, just a couple months ago. And that's when I got a little bit more light, you know, on the situation. And she told me, you know, he's hitting her again. He just put her up against the wall. He, you know, they say choked, but he strangled her. He threatened to kill them. She said he's, you know, bashed her head into a wall, and, you know, \"I just can't take it anymore.\" You know, \"Please help me. I'm afraid.\" You know? And I do believe her. I said, like, you know, Johnny Meadows kept that family in a box. And I believe and I still say it. If this didn't happen, my sister would have been in a box, which is a casket being put in the ground, if this incident didn't happen.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Is there anything you could do, not just as her aunt, but as a Cleveland police detective specializing in domestic violence, when you learned what was happening to the family?\n\nMARTINA LATESSA: Yeah, you know, I went down there the very first time she ran away in 2015. You know, I got the phone calls from the police, like, \"Bring her back.\" And I went and got her, and I took her back. And I talked to an officer there and a female sergeant, and I let them know, you know, what's going on. And I understand, like as a policeman, if the victim's going to not cooperate, you know, there's almost like nothing we can do. As a human, as her aunt, as my sister's sister, even as a police officer, there's no way I can knock on that door, go in that house and do that. And people don't understand. \"Oh, she's a policeman.\" I can't. I might as well went in that backyard and dug my sister's grave, if I ever got involved like that. Like, I knew, especially me, he did not like me. He didn't like me because I was a policeman. He did not like police officers. I just truly believe ifÂ—I couldn't go in there. I would make it worse, if not deadly, for her.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Victoria, you wrote a long piece about this, Victoria Law. How did the system fail Bresha?\n\nVICTORIA LAW: The system failed Bresha in so many different ways. When herÂ—when her mother filed for an order of protection, I mean, there are no resources for domestic violence survivors and their families. I mean, there are battered women shelters, there are abuse hotlines, but there are no safe places to go, there's no counseling. You need things like affordable housing and ways for people to be able to get out and stay out. When her aunt called child services the second time that Bresha ran away, they didn'tÂ—they didn't do anything to make sure that she was safe, that her family life was safe. According to her aunt, when they interviewed Bresha's parents, they interviewed them together, which means that her mother is not going to say that there is abuse in the house.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: They interviewed her mother and her abuser together.\n\nVICTORIA LAW: Yes, from what I understand, they were interviewed together. They didn't separate them so that they could find out what was going on. And they returned Bresha to the house. So, there are so many different ways in which the system could have intervened and done something, before Bresha, as a 14-year-old, as a very scared 14-year-old, felt that she had to do what she did to protect her family.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Ian Friedman, can you talk about the outpouring of support, but also the fact that the father's family, Jonathan Meadows' family, denies that there was domestic violence?\n\nIAN FRIEDMAN: I'll speak to the family first. It's not unusual, even forÂ—when I stand before judges and I'm representing someone who really did murder someone, there's always family behind them saying, \"But he's a good person, and please go easy on him.\" So, this doesn't surprise me at all. And they're mourning. And they may not know the full story, in all fairness to them. But I think that the evidence is going to be impossible to refute. And at some point, they're going to have to face it and accept it. Now, as far as the outpouring of support, it has been coming literally from across the globe. My office has just been flooded with mail and emails and calls from people, you know, that want her to know that she's being supported and prayed for. Gifts are being sent. Even a group of women sent a big box of painted rocks to my office, which was very nice, you know, with little sayings of encouragement. Of course, I can't bring that to the jail, but she can certainly see a photo of it. The petition that we received yesterday, now over 7,000 people who are calling for Bresha's release. So, it really is incredible. But the one area that has surprised me in the mail that I've received is that I have received no less than probably a half-dozen letters from other people who were in similar sorts of situations, and some of them had to take the same sort of action against their spousesÂ—or, I'm sorry, against their parents. And so, it reallyÂ—when I first read the first one, I was really shocked by it. And I've just gotten more and more. This is really touching people and having them kind of come out and to let her knowÂ—they're asking to let her know that, hey, you're not alone, I had to go to this also.
