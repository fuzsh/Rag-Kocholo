        "text": "The Maltese boys had to struggle against a physically very strong Swedish team from the very first minute of the match when they conceded the first goal. Notwithstanding this they played their hearts out and challenged for every ball on the field of play. Yet this was not enough and the Swedes scored regularly mostly from set pieces. The score punishes Wayne Attardâ€™s boys very harshly as with some more attention they should have registered a more honourable score considering that they were never outclassed by the very strong Swedes."
