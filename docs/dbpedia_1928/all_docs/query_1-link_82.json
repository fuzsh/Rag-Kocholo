        "text": "Three stages of the Digital Revolution including the rise of the Hardware-related Economy Era of the 50s, the Software-related Economy Era of the 80s and the Industrial Internet of Things Revolution of the 2000s have accelerated the obsolescence of the ‘ Routinized Industrial Economy ’ while stimulating the move towards Personalized, Flexible, Clean Green, Service-oriented, Knowledge-intensive, Smart, Connected and Advanced Manufacturing Economy ’. This change has simultaneously included the shift away of : - The Routinized, Downstream and Middlestream Corporates to the Upstream Corporates featured by emergence of Personalized, Flexible, Clean Green, Safe, Service-oriented, Knowledge-intensive, Smart, Connected and Advanced Manufacturing Corporates . - The Routinized, Downstream and Middlestream Cities to the Upstream Cities featured by the rise of the Personalized, Flexible, Clean, Green, Safe, Service-oriented, Knowledge-intensive, Smart, Connected and Advanced Manufacturing Cities . - The Routinized, Downstream and Middlestream Nations to the Upstream Nations featured by the rise of the Personalized, Flexible, Clean, Green, Safe, Service-oriented, Knowledge-intensive, Smart, Connected and Advanced Manufacturing Nations. Fortunately, the US has started to lead the race to Upstream Economy. In fact, pioneering the IT revolution did help the US become the most ‘Powerful Upstream and High-income Nation of the world ’. Furthermore, the three stages of IT have had significant transversal implications. For example, they’ve accelerated the obsolescence of the Routinized Industrial Educational Model mainly featured by the ‘Verticalized, Homogenized and Standardized Learning Process ’ while stimulating the emergence of an Upstream Educational Model featured by the ‘ Horizontal, Differentiated and Student-centric Education and Training Model ’ where students become effective owners, producers and actors of their ‘ Learning and Training processes ’. Furthermore, while the major goal of the Routinized Industrial Educational Model was about building the Routinized Industrial Competencies and Skills of the 18th and 19th centuries till the mid of 20th century, the goal of the Upstream Educational Model was about building the ‘ Personalized, Flexible, Agile, Creative, Clean, Safe, Green, Smart, Connected, Cooperative, Collaborative , Open-minded, Motivated and Highly-skilled Workforce ’ of the 21st century. Moreover, while the Routinized Industrial Educational Model was mainly nourished and inspired by the Newtonian Sciences, the Upstream Educational Model was shaped, structured and supported simultaneously by the New Scientific Revolution and Newtonian, Cognitive, Complexity and Behavioral Sciences. However and unfortunately, many cities and nations where their existing Educational Systems were locked into Downstream and Middlestream Stages as they remained Routinized Industrial Educational System did put themselves at a greater risk of Educational Crisis. As a result, among others, this Educational Crisis is currently seen throughout the Skills gap and mismtach on the one hand and the lack of ability to win the race with technology on the second hand. Furthermore, those nations and their obsolete Educational Systems were unable to fix the Attention Deficit of their students on the one hand and build the required skills and competencies of the 21st century. Furthermore, the obsolescence of their Educational Systems prevents them from increasing and improving the STEM preference, competencies and skills of their students while such abilities were needed to accelerate the move towards Sustainability. Empirically, according to Craig Ryan (2019), at the start of 2019, 7 million U.S. jobs remained unfilled, and American employers consistently cite trouble finding qualified workers. While some liberals insist a ‘ skills gap’ doesn’t exist, all evidence points to the contrary. And for Craig Ryan (2019), these gaps are moreover made worse by a higher education system that ill-equips graduates for the workforce. America’s economy has digitized over the past decade and the nation’s legacy infrastructure—post-secondary education institutions and workforce development boards-- have not come close to keeping up. Unfortunately, by worsening the already existing Educational Crisis (James Michael Walker, 2023), the COVID-19 pandemic also has done the same with the Skill gap and mismatch. Unfortunately, the rise of the Maturity stage of IT with its associated Technologies such as ‘ Virtual Relity (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), Machine Learning (ML), Blockchain, 3D Printing, Artificial Intelligence including ChatGPT have worsened the situation of their already existing obsolete Routinized Educational Systems. However and fortunately, despite this impact of the Destructive Effects of AI on their Educational System, AI has started to provide significant Capitalisation Effects that could help upgrade their Educational System in order to build the required Skills and Competencies of the 21st century. In fact, James Michael Walker (2023) finds that 80 % of the future jobs does not exist yet. Furthermore, while focusing on the Sustainability-driven Educational Model, he found that most of the Sustainability-driven Jobs that will accelerate the move towards Sustainability will be STEM-ICT-Analytics-Intensive ones. Of course, it does not mean that the activists will be excluded neither the societal watchdogs or experts in Strategy, Markeking, Leadership among others. Moreover, he did focus as well on the Top 10 Soft Skills that will be needed during the 21st century. They include : - Listening Skill. - Leadership Skill. - Communication Skill. - Delegation Skill. - Trustworthy Skill. - Critical Thinking Skill. - Problem-solving Skill. - Motivation Skill. - Time Management Skill. - Self-discipline Management Skill. Fortunately, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has started to help build the Upstream Educational System that will help achieve the above goal. Furthermore, AI can also improve and increase the Student’s Attention span. Moreover, recently as well, studies found that AI applied to the STEM can improve the STEM preference and education and training (Weiqi Xu and Fan Ouyang, 2022). In fact, Automated AI technologies, e.g., intelligence tutoring, automated assessment, data mining and learning analytics have been used in STEM education to enhance the instruction and learning quality (Chen et al., 2020 ; Hwang et al., 2020 and McLaren et al., 2010). However, OECD (2023) finds that it becomes relevant to understand how to tap its (AI) potential and address its multiple challenges, including the potential for bias, cheating and plagiarism, privacy and data security issues.
