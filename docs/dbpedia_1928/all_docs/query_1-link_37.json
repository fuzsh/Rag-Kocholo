The diagnosis of GT depends on identifying the dysfunction of the platelets. The aim of this study was to compare a whole blood impedance Multiplate analyzer (MEA) with the standard method, light transmission aggregometry (LTA) in diagnosis of GT. Fifteen patients with GT were assessed on MEA and LTA using arachidonic acid (ASPI: 15 mm), (TRAP: 1 mm), collagen (100 Î¼g/mL), ADP (0.2 mm), and ristocetin (Risto: 10 mg/mL). Whole blood samples were collected in sodium citrate and hirudin vacuum, blood collection tubes and tested within 4 h. Platelet-rich plasma was used for LTA using platelet agonists (ristocetin 1.5 mg/mL) (arachidonic acid 0.5 mg/mL) (ADP 2.5 mg/mL) and (collagen 1 mg/mL). The platelet count and PFA-100 results were (average and SD) 319 Â± 93 Ã 10(9) L and 252 Â± 34 s, respectively. Flow cytometry analysis showed that all samples are positive for CD42a and CD42b, whereas 9/15 samples were negative for CD61 and CD41. The other six patients had either partial or full expression of CD61/CD41. Aggregation analysis using both methods showed that all samples had no aggregation response to any of the agonists used apart from six samples which, using only the MEA, showed minimal aggregation in response to collagen (average = 14.3 Â± 7 Î¼g, which may suggest ability to detect qualitative abnormality of GPIIb/IIIa). These results suggest that the MEA is sensitive for the detection of Glanzmann thrombasthenia. Furthermore, MEA may also be able to differentiate between the subtypes of Glanzmann thrombasthenia.

GT is characterized by spontaneous mucocutaneous bleeding and an exaggerated response to trauma due to platelets that fail to aggregate when stimulated by physiologic agonists. GT is caused by quantitative or qualitative deficiencies of Î±IIbÎ²3, an integrin coded by the ITGA2B and ITGB3 genes and which by binding fibrinogen and other adhesive proteins joins platelets together in the aggregate. Widespread genotyping has revealed mutations spread across both genes, yet the reason for the extensive variation in both the severity and intensity of bleeding between affected individuals remains poorly understood. Furthermore, while genetic defects of ITGB3 affect other tissues with Î²3 present as Î±vÎ²3 (the vitronectin receptor), the bleeding phenotype continues to dominate. Here, we look in detail at mutations that affect (i) the Î²-propeller region of the Î±IIb head domain and (ii) the membrane proximal disulfide-rich EGF domains of Î²3 and which often result in spontaneous integrin activation. We also examine deep vein thrombosis as an unexpected complication of GT and look at curative procedures for the disease including allogeneic stem cell transfer and the potential for gene therapy.

Although thrombasthenia is a rare disorder, its occurrence is increased in some regions of the world where intracommunity marriage and consanguinity are commonplace, resulting in increased expression of autosomal recessive traits. The authors have been studying two populations having an unusually high frequency of Glanzmann disease, Iraqi Jews and Arabs living in Israel, and were able to distinguish the populations on the basis of immunodetectable GPIIIa and populations on the basis of immunodetectable GPIIIa andmoreÂ Â» platelet surface vitronectin receptor ({alpha}{sub v}{beta}{sub 3}) expression. In this article, they describe molecular genetic studies based on use of the PCR that have allowed us to characterize platelet mRNA sequences encoding GPIIb and GPIIIa from patients in these populations. These studies demonstrate the heterogeneity of Glanzmann thrombasthenia in different populations, and its homogeneity within geographically restricted populations, and offer insight into the requirements for integrin surface expression.Â«Â less\n\nA systematic review of the management and outcomes of pregnancy in Glanzmann thrombasthenia.\n\nPubMed\n\nSiddiq, S; Clark, A; Mumford, A\n\n2011-09-01\n\nGlanzmann Thrombasthenia (GT) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder which usually manifests as severe mucocutaneous bleeding and is caused by deficiency of the platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa. Pregnancy in women with GT presents particular challenges as there is increased risk of both maternal and foetal bleeding. To improve understanding and clarify the optimum management of pregnancy in this disorder, we performed a systematic review of the world literature of pregnancy and GT. This identified three single-centre case series of patients with GT that included brief descriptions of women in pregnancy and 31 detailed case reports of 40 pregnancies in 35 women that resulted in 38 live births. Among the detailed case reports, ante-natal bleeding was described in 50% of pregnancies but was usually mild and occurred at mucocutaneous sites. Primary postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) was reported in 34% of pregnancies and secondary PPH in 24%. PPH was frequently severe and occurred up to 20 days after delivery. There was a wide variation in approach to prevention and treatment of PPH but most women received platelet transfusion, sometimes with additional recombinant FVIIa and anti-fibrinolytics. Maternal alloimmunization against platelet antigens was reported in 73% of pregnancies and was associated with four neonatal deaths. These data emphasize the need for multidisciplinary management of pregnancy in women with GT. Delivery plans should recognize the need for prevention and aggressive treatment of PPH and should minimize foetal bleeding risk in pregnancies complicated by alloimmunization.

Following platelet transfusion, affected patients may develop antiplatelet antibodies (to human leukocyte antigen [HLA], and/or Î±IIbÎ²3 in GT or GPIb-IX in BSS), which may render future platelet transfusion ineffective. Anti-Î±IIbÎ²3 and anti-GPIb-IX may also cross the placenta during pregnancy to cause thrombocytopenia and bleeding in the fetus/neonate. This review will focus particularly on the better studied GT to illustrate the natural history and complications of platelet alloimmunization. BSS will be more briefly discussed. Platelet transfusion, if unavoidable, should be given judiciously with good indications. Patients following platelet transfusion, and women during and after pregnancy, should be monitored for the development of platelet antibodies. There is now a collection of data suggesting the safety and effectiveness of recombinant activated factor VII in the management of affected patients with platelet antibodies.

Severe bleeding is controlled by transfusion of normal platelets, leading in some cases to the occurrence of anti-GPIIb-IIIa isoantibodies, which induces a loss of transfused platelet efficacy. We used immunoadsorption on protein A Sepharose (IA-PA), which has been shown to be efficient in decreasing the titre of antibodies in several immune diseases, in three patients with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia and anti-GPIIb-IIIa isoantibodies on five different occasions. IA-PA was well tolerated with no deleterious side-effects reported. It induced a dramatic decrease of total immunoglobulin (Ig)G, including anti-GPIIb-IIIa isoantibody levels, as assessed by the monoclonal antibody-specific immobilization of platelet antigens test and the ex vivo inhibition of normal platelet aggregation induced by the patient's platelet-rich or platelet-poor plasma. Elimination of the antibody was associated with a correction of the bleeding time following platelet transfusion. IA-PA combined with platelet transfusion made it possible to control two life-threatening haemorrhages, and allowed two surgical procedures and one bone marrow transplantation to be performed safely. Our experience suggests that IA-PA, which restores the haemostatic efficacy of platelet transfusion, is a valuable therapeutic strategy in patients with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia and anti-GPIIb-IIIa isoantibodies.\n\nThe inÂ vivo effect of fibrinogen and factor XIII on clot formation and fibrinolysis in Glanzmann's thrombasthenia.\n\nPubMed\n\nShenkman, Boris; Livnat, Tami; Misgav, Mudi; Budnik, Ivan; Einav, Yulia; Martinowitz, Uriel\n\n2012-01-01\n\nGlanzmann's thrombasthenia (GT) is characterized by increased bleeding risk. The treatment options in GT are limited. The aim of this study was to test the effect of GT blood supplementation with fibrinogen and factor XIII on thrombin generation, blood clotting, and fibrinolysis. Whole blood samples of GT patients and normal donors treated with eptifibatide (GT model) were subjected to clotting by CaCl(2) and tissue factor. Thrombin generation was measured in platelet-rich plasma. Clot formation and tPA-induced fibrinolysis were evaluated in whole blood by rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM). Blood was supplemented with fibrinogen (3âg/L) and/or FXIII (2âIU/mL). Thrombin generation analysis of blood derived from GT model and GT patients revealed decreased endogenous thrombin potential and peak height and extended lag time compared to control. However, this method was not sensitive to blood spiking with fibrinogen and FXIII. ROTEM revealed lower maximum clot firmness (MCF) and area under curve (AUC) in the blood of GT model and GT patients. In the absence of exogenous tPA, blood spiking with fibrinogen markedly enhanced clot quality while FXIII had no effect. Combination of fibrinogen and FXIII did not add to the effect of fibrinogen. In contrast, by the addition of tPA, both fibrinogen and FXIII separately and, to more extent, in combination enhanced clot quality as well as resistance against tPA-induced fibrinolysis (increasing MCF, AUC, and lysis onset time). In conclusion, fibrinogen and FXIII exerted stimulation of blood clotting and inhibition of fibrinolysis. Treating normal blood with eptifibatide mimics the changes of coagulopathy in GT blood.\n\nÎ±IIbÎ²3 variants defined by next-generation sequencing: Predicting variants likely to cause Glanzmann thrombasthenia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBuitrago, Lorena; Rendon, Augusto; Liang, Yupu; Simeoni, Ilenia; Negri, Ana; Filizola, Marta; Ouwehand, Willem H.; Coller, Barry S.; Alessi, Marie-Christine; Ballmaier, Matthias; Bariana, Tadbir; Bellissimo, Daniel; Bertoli, Marta; Bray, Paul; Bury, Loredana; Carrell, Robin; Cattaneo, Marco; Collins, Peter; French, Deborah; Favier, Remi; Freson, Kathleen; Furie, Bruce; Germeshausen, Manuela; Ghevaert, Cedric; Gomez, Keith; Goodeve, Anne; Gresele, Paolo; Guerrero, Jose; Hampshire, Dan J.; Hadinnapola, Charaka; Heemskerk, Johan; Henskens, Yvonne; Hill, Marian; Hogg, Nancy; Johnsen, Jill; Kahr, Walter; Kerr, Ron; Kunishima, Shinji; Laffan, Michael; Natwani, Amit; Neerman-Arbez, Marguerite; Nurden, Paquita; Nurden, Alan; Ormiston, Mark; Othman, Maha; Ouwehand, Willem; Perry, David; Vilk, Shoshana Ravel; Reitsma, Pieter; Rondina, Matthew; Simeoni, Ilenia; Smethurst, Peter; Stephens, Jonathan; Stevenson, William; Szkotak, Artur; Turro, Ernest; Van Geet, Christel; Vries, Minka; Ward, June; Waye, John; Westbury, Sarah; Whiteheart, Sidney; Wilcox, David; Zhang, Bi\n\n2015-01-01\n\nNext-generation sequencing is transforming our understanding of human genetic variation but assessing the functional impact of novel variants presents challenges. We analyzed missense variants in the integrin Î±IIbÎ²3 receptor subunit genes ITGA2B and ITGB3 identified by whole-exome or -genome sequencing in the ThromboGenomics project, comprising â¼32,000 alleles from 16,108 individuals. We analyzed the results in comparison with 111 missense variants in these genes previously reported as being associated with Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT), 20 associated with alloimmune thrombocytopenia, and 5 associated with aniso/macrothrombocytopenia. We identified 114 novel missense variants in ITGA2B (affecting â¼11% of the amino acids) and 68 novel missense variants in ITGB3 (affecting â¼9% of the amino acids). Of the variants, 96% had minor allele frequencies (MAF) < 0.1%, indicating their rarity. Based on sequence conservation, MAF, and location on a complete model of Î±IIbÎ²3, we selected three novel variants that affect amino acids previously associated with GT for expression in HEK293 cells. Î±IIb P176H and Î²3 C547G severely reduced Î±IIbÎ²3 expression, whereas Î±IIb P943A partially reduced Î±IIbÎ²3 expression and had no effect on fibrinogen binding. We used receiver operating characteristic curves of combined annotation-dependent depletion, Polyphen 2-HDIV, and sorting intolerant from tolerant to estimate the percentage of novel variants likely to be deleterious. At optimal cut-off values, which had 69â98% sensitivity in detecting GT mutations, between 27% and 71% of the novel Î±IIb or Î²3 missense variants were predicted to be deleterious. Our data have implications for understanding the evolutionary pressure on Î±IIbÎ²3 and highlight the challenges in predicting the clinical significance of novel missense variants.

This study arrived to report within a Congolese family five cases of Glanzmann's thromboasthenia. 5 cases of the congenital form of Glanzmann's thromboasthenia were depicted in a Congolese family. The disease was first discovered with a young student who was transferred in France, who had shown a tendency to develop hemorrhages since childhood. This tendency was enhanced following abdominal surgery to treat peritonitis. Like the other 3 cases, she had a prolonged bleeding time, albeit with normal von Willebrand factor plasma values. A 7 year old girl died following appendectomy from post-surgery hemorrhages. In this young patient, platelet aggregation could be induced only by ristocetine, all other conventional agonists failed. Flow cytometric analysis showed the total absence of GPIIbIIIa. The hemorrhages in the girls could be managed by cyclic administration of oestrogens and iron supplementation. Serologic analysis showed this patient to be positive for hepatitis C virus antibodies. This first description of Glanzmann's thrombo-asthenia in Blacks in sub-Saharan Africa shows the necessity of establish inter-hospital cooperation for the improvement of the management of constitutive hemorrhagic diseases in the Hematology wards.\n\nThe effect of platelets on fibrin gel structure formed in the presence of recombinant factor VIIa in hemophilia plasma and in plasma from a patient with Glanzmann thrombasthenia.\n\nPubMed\n\nHe, S; Ekman, G Jacobsson; Hedner, U\n\n2005-02-01\n\nFibrin gel structure has been shown to be dependent on the thrombin concentration as well as the rate of thrombin generation. Accordingly, factor VIII (FVIII)- and FIX-deficient plasma (hemophilia A and B) form loose fibrin clots with high permeability constants. By adding rFVIIa in vitro to FVIII-deficient plasma containing platelets (frozen and thawed), the fibrin gel permeability constant normalized, indicating that extra rFVIIa (1.2 microg mL(-1) or higher) induced a tight fibrin structure. Thrombin generation is highly dependent on the number of platelets, and in this study it was demonstrated that the addition of rFVIIa (5 microg mL(-1)) normalizes the fibrin gel permeability in samples containing platelets (frozen-thawed) in numbers of at least down to 20 x 10(6) mL(-1). The effect of rFVIIa was not observed when unfrozen platelets instead of frozen-thawed platelets were added. Neither was any effect on the fibrin permeability seen, in the presence of annexin V, known to block the effect of phospholipids on the platelet surface. This indicates an important role of platelet phospholipids for the effect of rFVIIa. A similar effect on the fibrin permeability of rFVIIa was observed when added to platelet-rich plasma from a patient with Glanzmann thrombasthenia. Recombinant FVIIa has been found to induce hemostasis in patients with hemophilia and inhibitors against FVIII/FIX as well as in patients with Glanzmann thrombasthenia, indicating the importance of the formation of a tight fibrin gel structure, more resistant against premature proteolysis, for maintaining hemostasis. In conclusion, the addition of rFVIIa (5 microg mL(-1)) also substantially decreased the permeability constant of fibrin gels formed in FVIII-deficient plasma in the presence of low numbers of frozen-thawed platelets (down to 20 x 10(6) mL(-1)). A similar pattern was obtained in plasma from a Glanzmann patient. No effect was found in the presence of unfrozen instead of frozen-thawed platelets\n\nFormation of obstructing blood clot in the ureter in a patient with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia.\n\nPubMed\n\nKilincaslan, Huseyin; Leblebisatan, Goksel; Tepeler, Abdulkadir; Karakus, Suleyman C\n\n2011-12-01\n\nGlanzman thrombasthenia is a rare hematologic disorder characterized by qualitative thrombocyte abnormality. Patients present with episodic mucocutaneous bleeding. Thrombosis is a paradox phenomenon observed in patients with Glanzman thrombasthenia and generally considered as a treatment complication. We present a 16-year-old girl referred for severe flank pain beginning after treatment of hematuria due to Glanzman thrombasthenia. The patient underwent endoscopy for further diagnosis and treatment because of the failure of radiologic evaluation. Although the resolution of the large clots was obtained with streptokinase instillation via the ureteral catheter, clot was mobilized with gentle insertion of ureteral catheter in the present case.\n\nAssociation of Factor V Secretion with Protein Kinase B Signaling in Platelets from Horses with Atypical Equine Thrombasthenia.\n\nPubMed\n\nNorris, J W; Pombo, M; Shirley, E; Blevins, G; Tablin, F\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTwo congenital bleeding diatheses have been identified in Thoroughbred horses: Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) and a second, novel diathesis associated with abnormal platelet function in response to collagen and thrombin stimulation. Platelet dysfunction in horses with this second thrombasthenia results from a secretory defect. Two affected and 6 clinically normal horses. Ex vivo study. Washed platelets were examined for (1) expression of the Î±IIb-Î²3 integrin; (2) fibrinogen binding capacity in response to ADP and thrombin; (3) secretion of dense and Î±-granules; (4) activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway; and (5) cellular distribution of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate-3-kinase, class 2B (PIK3C2B) and SH2 containing inositol-5'-phosphatase 1 (SHIP1). Platelets from affected horses expressed normal amounts of Î±IIb-Î²3 integrin and bound fibrinogen normally in response to ADP, but bound 80% less fibrinogen in response to thrombin. Î±-granules only released 50% as much Factor V as control platelets, but dense granules released their contents normally. Protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation was reduced after thrombin activation, but mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2) and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) signaling were normal. SH2-containing inositol-5'-phosphatase 1 (SHIP1) did not localize to the cytoskeleton of affected platelets and was decreased overall consistent with reduced AKT phosphorylation. Defects in fibrinogen binding, granule secretion, and signal transduction are unique to this thrombasthenia, which we designate as atypical equine thrombasthenia. Copyright Â© The Authors.

A Systematic Review on its Use in Surgical Procedures.\n\nPubMed\n\nDi Minno, Matteo Nicola Dario; Ambrosino, Pasquale; Myasoedova, Veronika; Amato, Manuela; Ventre, Itala; Tremoli, Elena; Minno, Alessandro Di\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIn the absence of definite guidelines in the area, we have carried a systemic review to provide a thorough overview concerning the efficacy and safety of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa, NovoSevenÂ®, Novo Nordisk A/S, BagsvÃ¦rd, Denmark) in patients with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia (GT) and FVII deficiency, undergoing surgical procedures. PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and EMBASE databases was employed for the search. Three multicenter registries were identified: the Glanzmann's Thrombasthenia Registry (GTR), the Seven Treatment Evaluation Registry (STER), and a German post-marketing surveillance registry (the WIRK study). In addition, data from 10 case-series and/or single-center experiences have been summarized. We have found that the following; perioperatively, the hemostatic effectiveness of rFVIIa was high in GT patients and in those with FVII deficiency undergoing both minor and major surgical procedures. Moreover, in all studies, rFVIIa was well tolerated. Thus, the current evidence shows an optimal perioperative safety/efficacy profile of rFVIIa in the setting of these rare bleeding disorders, and provides the rationale for further studies aimed at evaluating the optimal perioperative anti-hemorrhagic prophylaxis with rFVIIa in GT and in FVII deficient patients.

Flow cytometry analysis revealed undetectable levels of platelet glycoproteins alphaIIb and beta3, although residual amounts of both proteins were detectable in immunoblotting analysis. Sequence analysis of reversely transcribed platelet beta3 mRNA showed a 100-base pair deletion in the 3'-boundary of exon 11, that results in a frame shift and appearance of a premature STOP codon. Analysis of the corresponding genomic DNA fragment revealed the presence of a homozygous C1815T transition in exon 11. The mutation does not change the amino acid residue but it creates an ectopic consensus splice donor site that is used preferentially, causing splicing out of part of exon 11. The parents of the proband, heterozygous for this mutation, were asymptomatic and had reduced platelet content of alphaIIbbeta3. PCR-based relative quantification of beta3 mRNA failed to detect the mutant transcript in the parents and showed a marked reduction in the patient. The results suggest that the thrombasthenic phenotype is, mainly, the result of the reduced availability of beta3-mRNA, most probably due to activation of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay mechanism. They also show the convenience of analyzing both genomic DNA and mRNA, in order to ascertain the functional consequences of single nucleotide substitutions.\n\nGlanzmann Thrombasthenia\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... and Women with Hemophilia Inheritance of Hemophilia Definitions & Terminology Bleeding Symptoms Carrier Diagnosis When to Test for ... and Women with Hemophilia Inheritance of Hemophilia Definitions & Terminology Bleeding Symptoms Carrier Diagnosis When to Test for ...\n\nFunctional Comparison of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell- and Blood-Derived GPIIbIIIa Deficient Platelets\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHaas, Jessica; Sandrock-Lang, Kirstin; GÃ¤rtner, Florian; Jung, Christian Billy; Zieger, Barbara; Parrotta, Elvira; Kurnik, Karin; Sinnecker, Daniel; Wanner, Gerhard; Laugwitz, Karl-Ludwig; Massberg, Steffen; Moretti, Alessandra\n\n2015-01-01\n\nHuman induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) represent a versatile tool to model genetic diseases and are a potential source for cell transfusion therapies. However, it remains elusive to which extent patient-specific hiPSC-derived cells functionally resemble their native counterparts. Here, we generated a hiPSC model of the primary platelet disease Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT), characterized by dysfunction of the integrin receptor GPIIbIIIa, and compared side-by-side healthy and diseased hiPSC-derived platelets with peripheral blood platelets. Both GT-hiPSC-derived platelets and their peripheral blood equivalents showed absence of membrane expression of GPIIbIIIa, a reduction of PAC-1 binding, surface spreading and adherence to fibrinogen. We demonstrated that GT-hiPSC-derived platelets recapitulate molecular and functional aspects of the disease and show comparable behavior to their native counterparts encouraging the further use of hiPSC-based disease models as well as the transition towards a clinical application.

Most inherited platelet function disorders (IPFDs) are mild to moderate bleeding disorders that can never experience a severe bleeding as in ICH; however, Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, a common and severe inherited platelet function disorder, can lead to ICH and occasional death. This bleeding feature can also be observed in grey platelet syndrome, though less frequently than in Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. In hemophilia, intracerebral hemorrhage is affected by various risk factors one of which is the severity of the disease. The precise prevalence of ICH in these patients is not clear but an estimated incidence of 3.5-4% among newborns with hemophilia is largely ascertained. Although ICH is a rare phenomenon in CBDs, it can be experienced by every patient with severe hemophilia A and B, FXIII deficiency (FXIIID), FVIID, FXD, FVD, FIID, and afibrinogenemia. Upon observing the general signs and symptoms of ICH such as vomiting, seizure, unconsciousness, and headache, appropriate replacement therapies and cranial ultrasound scans must be done to decrease ICH-related morbidity and mortality.\n\nSafety update on the use of recombinant activated factor VII in approved indications.\n\nPubMed\n\nNeufeld, Ellis J; NÃ©grier, Claude; Arkhammar, Per; Benchikh el Fegoun, Soraya; Simonsen, Mette Duelund; Rosholm, Anders; Seremetis, Stephanie\n\n2015-06-01\n\nThis updated safety review summarises the large body of safety data available on the use of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) in approved indications: haemophilia with inhibitors, congenital factor VII (FVII) deficiency, acquired haemophilia and Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. Accumulated data up to 31 December 2013 from clinical trials as well as post-marketing data (registries, literature reports and spontaneous reports) were included. Overall, rFVIIa has shown a consistently favourable safety profile, with no unexpected safety concerns, in all approved indications. No confirmed cases of neutralising antibodies against rFVIIa have been reported in patients with congenital haemophilia, acquired haemophilia or Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. The favourable safety profile of rFVIIa can be attributed to the recombinant nature of rFVIIa and its localised mechanism of action at the site of vascular injury. Recombinant FVIIa activates factor X directly on the surface of activated platelets, which are present only at the site of injury, meaning that systemic activation of coagulation is avoided and the risk of thrombotic events (TEs) thus reduced. Nonetheless, close monitoring for signs and symptoms of TE is warranted in all patients treated with any pro-haemostatic agent, including rFVIIa, especially the elderly and any other patients with concomitant conditions and/or predisposing risk factors to thrombosis.

Although molecular abnormalities of platelet proteins occur infrequently, taken collectively, an inherited platelet defect accounts for a bleeding diathesis in â1:20,000 individuals. One rare example of a platelet disorder, Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT), is characterized by life-long morbidity and mortality due to molecular abnormalities in a major platelet adhesion receptor, integrin Î±IIbÎ²3. Transfusion therapy is frequently inadequate because patients often generate antibodies to Î±IIbÎ²3, leading to immune-mediated destruction of healthy platelets. In the most severe cases allogeneic bone marrow transplantation has been used, yet because of the risk of the procedure it has been limited to few patients. Thus, hematopoietic stem cell gene transfer was explored as a strategy to improve platelet function within a canine model for GT. Bleeding complications necessitated the use of a mild pretransplant conditioning regimen; therefore, in vivo drug selection was used to improve engraftment of autologously transplanted cells. Approximately 5,000 Î±IIbÎ²3 receptors formed on 10% of platelets. These modest levels allowed platelets to adhere to Î±IIbÎ²3âs major ligand (fibrinogen), form aggregates, and mediate retraction of a fibrin clot. Remarkably, improved hemostatic function was evident, with â¤135-fold reduced blood loss, and improved buccal bleeding times decreased to 4 min for up to 5 y after transplant. One of four transplanted dogs developed a significant antibody response to Î±IIbÎ²3 that was attenuated effectively with transient immune suppression. These results indicate that gene therapy could become a practical approach for treating inherited platelet defects.

Recombinant factor VIIa interacts with thrombin-activated platelets to produce a thrombin burst leading to accelerated fibrin clot formation localized to the site of vascular injury. It is approved in many countries for use as an intravenous hemostatic agent in patients with congenital hemophilia with inhibitors, and also for acquired hemophilia, factor VII deficiency, and Glanzmann thrombasthenia in some countries. Studies have shown it to be effective and generally well tolerated when used intravenously to treat bleeding episodes or provide hemostatic cover during surgery in patients with congenital hemophilia with inhibitors, acquired hemophilia, factor VII deficiency or Glanzmann thrombasthenia. Based on available data, its efficacy in terms of patient-assessed response may be similar to that of activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC), but treatment with a single 270 microg/kg dose of recombinant factor VIIa might reduce the need for rescue therapy compared with aPCC. Recombinant factor VIIa is not immunogenic in patients with hemophilia, does not produce an anamnestic response in hemophilia patients with inhibitors, and has very low thrombogenicity. It is recommended in guidelines as the treatment of choice for bleeds in patients with hemophilia B with high-responding inhibitors and for patients with factor VII deficiency, and is also a first-line therapeutic option for high-responder hemophilia A patients with inhibitors and those with acquired hemophilia. Cost data from pharmacoeconomic analyses support its use in hemophilia patients with inhibitors. Thus, recombinant factor VIIa is a valuable treatment option for patients with these rare, but potentially serious, bleeding disorders.\n\n[Construction of rAAV2-GPIIb/IIIa vector and test of its expression and function in vitro].\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Kai; Peng, Jian-Qiang; Chen, Fang-Ping; Wu, Xiao-Bin\n\n2006-04-01\n\nThis study was aimed to explore the possibility of rAAV2 vector-mediating gene therapy for Glanzmann' s thrombasthenia. The rAAV2-GPIIb/IIIa vector was constructed. The GPIIb/IIIa gene expression in mammal cell were examined by different methods, such as: detection of mRNA expression in BHK-21 cells after 24 hours of infection (MOI = 1 x 10(5) v.g/cell) was performed by RT-PCR; the relation between MOI and quantity of GPII6/IIIa gene expression was detected by FACS after 48 hours of infection; GPIIb/IIIa protein expression in BHK-21 cells after 48 hours of infection (MOI = 10(5) v x g/cell) was assayed by Western blot, GPIIb/IIIa protein expression on cell surface was detected by immunofluorescence, and the biological function of expressing product was determined by PAC-1 conjunct experiments. The results showed that GPIIb/IIIa gene expression in mRNA level could be detected in BHK-21 cells after 24 hours of infection at MOI = 1 x 10(5) v x g/cell and the GPIIb/IIIa gene expression in protein level could be detected in BHK-21 cells after 48 hours of infection at MOI = 1 x 10(5) v x g/cell. In certain range, quantity of GPIIb/IIIa gene expression increased with MOI, but overdose of MOI decreased quantity of GPIIb/IIIa gene expression. Activated product of GPIIb/IIIa gene expression could combined with PAC-I, and possesed normal biological function. In conclusion, rAAV2 vactor can effectively mediate GPIIb and GPIIIa gene expressing in mammal cells, and the products of these genes exhibit biological function. This result may provide a basis for application of rAAV2 vector in Glanzmann's thrombasthenia gene therapy in furture.\n\nFludarabine Phosphate, Cyclophosphamide, Total Body Irradiation, and Donor Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Blood Cancer\n\nClinicalTrials.gov\n\n2018-06-13\n\nAccelerated Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, BCR-ABL1 Positive; Acute Leukemia in Remission; Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia; Acute Myeloid Leukemia; Acute Myeloid Leukemia With FLT3/ITD Mutation; Acute Myeloid Leukemia With Gene Mutations; Aplastic Anemia; B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma; CD40 Ligand Deficiency; Chronic Granulomatous Disease; Chronic Leukemia in Remission; Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia; Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, BCR-ABL1 Positive; Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia; Chronic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, BCR-ABL1 Positive; Congenital Amegakaryocytic Thrombocytopenia; Congenital Neutropenia; Congenital Pure Red Cell Aplasia; Glanzmann Thrombasthenia; Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Myelodysplastic Syndrome; Myelofibrosis; Myeloproliferative Neoplasm; Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria; Plasma Cell Myeloma; Polycythemia Vera; Recurrent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma; Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma; Secondary Acute Myeloid Leukemia; Secondary Myelodysplastic Syndrome; Severe Aplastic Anemia; Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome; Sickle Cell Disease; T-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma; Thalassemia; Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia; Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome\n\nThe Poplar GT8E and GT8F Glycosyltransferases are Functional Orthologs of Arabidopsis PARVUS Involved in Gulcuronoxylan Biosynthesis\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nThe poplar GT8E and GT8F glycosyltransferases have previously been shown to be associated with wood formation, but their roles in the biosynthesis of wood components are not known.

A. H.; Kondo, K.; Deans, J. R.; Crispini, L.; Takazawa, E.; Coggon, J. A.; Kelemen, P. B.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nHydrothermal circulation is a fundamental Earth process that is responsible for the cooling of newly formed ocean crust at mid ocean ridges and imparts a chemical signature on both the crust and the oceans. Despite decades of study, the critical samples necessary to resolve the role of hydrothermal circulation during the formation of the lower ocean crust have remained poorly sampled in the ocean basins. The Oman Drilling Project successfully cored 3 boreholes into the lower crust of the Semail ophiolite (Holes GT1A layered gabbros, GT2A foliated gabbros and GT3A dike/gabbro transition). These boreholes have exceptionally high recovery ( 100%) compared to rotary coring in the oceans and provide an unrivalled opportunity to quantitatively characterise the hydrothermal system in the lower oceanic crust. Hydrothermal alteration in Holes GT1A and GT2A is ubiquitous and manifests as secondary minerals replacing primary igneous phases and secondary minerals precipitated in hydrothermal veins and hydrothermal fault zones. Hole GT1A is characterised by total alteration intensities between 10 -100%, with a mean alteration intensity of 60%, and shows no overall trend downhole. However, there are discrete depth intervals (on the scale of 30 -100 m) where the total alteration intensity increases with depth. Alteration assemblages are dominated by chlorite + albite + amphibole, with variable abundances of epidote, clinozoisite and quartz. Hole GT1A intersected several hydrothermal fault zones, these range from 2-3 cm up to >1m in size and are associated with more complex secondary mineral assemblages. Hydrothermal veins are abundant throughout Hole GT1A, with a mean density of 37 vein/m. Hole GT2A is characterised by total alteration intensities between 6-100%, with a mean alteration intensity of 45%, and is highly variable downhole. Alteration halos and patches are slightly more abundant than in Hole GT1A. The secondary mineral assemblage is similar to Hole GT1A, but Hole GT2A\n\nInitial report of the physical property measurement, ChikyuOman core description Phase I: sheeted dike and gabbro boundary from ICDP Holes GT1A, GT2A and GT3A\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAbe, N.; Okazaki, K.; Hatakeyama, K.; Ildefonse, B.; Leong, J. A. M.; Tateishi, Y.; Teagle, D. A. H.; Takazawa, E.; Kelemen, P. B.; Michibayashi, K.; Coggon, J. A.; Harris, M.; de Obeso, J. C.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nWe report results on the physical property measurements of the core samples from ICDP Holes GT1A, GT2A and GT3A drilled at Samail Ophiolite, Sultanate of Oman. Cores from Holes GT1A and GT2A in the lower crust section are mainly composed of gabbros (gabbro and olivine gabbro), and small amounts of ultramafic rocks (wehrlite and dunite), while cores from Hole GT3A at the boundary between sheeted dikes and gabbro are mainly composed of basalt and diabase, followed by gabbros (gabbro, olivine gabbro and oxide gabbro), and less common felsic dikes, trondhjemite and tonalite, intrude the mafic rocks. Measurements of physical properties were undertaken to characterize recovered core material. Onboard the Drilling Vessel Chikyu, whole-round measurements included X-ray CT image, natural gamma radiation, and magnetic susceptibility for Leg 1, and additional P-wave velocity, gamma ray attenuation density, and electrical resistivity during Leg 2. Split-core point magnetic susceptibility and color spectroscopy were measured for all core sections. P-wave velocity, bulk/grain density and porosity of more than 500 discrete cube samples, and thermal conductivity on more than 240 pieces from the working half of the split core sections were also measured. Physical Properties of gabbroic rocks from Holes GT1A and GT2A are similar to typical oceanic gabbros from ODP and IODP expeditions at Atlantis Bank, Southwestern Indian Ridge (ODP Legs 118, 176 and 179; IODP Exp 360) and at Hess Deep, Eastern Pacific (ODP Leg 147 and IODP Exp. 345). Average P-wave velocity, bulk density, grain density, porosity and thermal conductivity are 6.7 km/s, 2.92 g/cm^3, 2.93 g/cm^3, 0.98% and 2.46 W/m/K, respectively. P-wave velocity of samples from all three holes is inversely correlated with porosity. No clear correlation between the original lithology and physical properties is observed. GT3A cores show a wider range (e.g., Vp from 2.2 to 7.1 km/s) of values for the measured physical properties\n\nRecombinant activated factor VII: 30 years of research and innovation.\n\nPubMed\n\nHedner, Ulla\n\n2015-06-01\n\nRecombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) was initially developed to treat bleeding episodes in patients with congenital haemophilia and inhibitors. The story of its development began in the 1970s, when FVIIa was identified as one of the activated coagulation factors that has minimal potential for inducing thromboembolic side-effects. Extensive research over the last 30 years has greatly increased our knowledge of the characteristics of FVII, its activation, and the mechanisms by which rFVIIa restores haemostasis. In haemophilia, the haemostatic effect of rFVIIa is mediated via binding to thrombin-activated platelets at the site of injury, thereby enhancing thrombin generation also in the absence of factor (F) VIII or FIX. The mechanism of action of rFVIIa has also allowed its successful use in other clinical scenarios characterised by impaired thrombin generation, and its licensed uses have now been extended to acquired haemophilia, congenital FVII deficiency and Glanzmann's thrombasthenia.

The gene has an open reading frame of 4,965 bp that encodes a protein of 1,655 amino acids with molecular mass of 182 kDa. The six conserved regions, characteristic of GH13 family, have been detected in gt-apu. The recombinant enzyme has only one active site for Î±-amylase and pullulanase activities based on the enzyme kinetic analyses in a system that contains starch as well as pullulan as competing substrates and response to inhibitors. The end-product analysis confirmed that this is an endoacting enzyme. The specific enzyme activities for Î±-amylase and pullulanase of the truncated amylopullulanase (gt-apuT) are higher than gt-apu. Both enzymes exhibited similar temperature (60 Â°C) and pH (7.0) optima, although gt-apuT possessed a higher thermostability than gt-apu. The overall catalytic efficiency (K(cat)/K(m)) of gt-apuT is greater than that of gt-apu, with almost similar substrate specificities. The C-terminal region of gt-apu appeared to be non-essential, and furthermore, it negatively affects the substrate binding and stability of the enzyme.\n\nMulti-color lightcurve observation of the asteroid (163249) 2002 GT\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOshima, M.; Abe, S.\n\n2014-07-01\n\nNASA's Deep Impact/EPOXI spacecraft plans to encounter the asteroid (163249) 2002 GT, classified as a PHA (Potentially Hazardous Asteroid), on January 4, 2020. However, the taxonomic type and spin state of 2002 GT remain to be determined. We have carried out ground-based multi-color (B-V-R-I) lightcurve observations taking advantage of the 2002 GT Characterization Campaign by NASA. Multi-color lightcurve measurements allow us to estimate the rotation period and obtain strong constraints on the shape and pole orientation. Here we found that the rotation period of 2002 GT is estimated to be 3.7248 Â± 0.1664 h. In mid-2013, 2002 GT passed at 0.015 au from the Earth, resulting an exceptional opportunity for ground-based characterization. Using the 0.81-m telescope of the Tenagra Observatory (110Â°52'44.8''W, +31Â°27'44.4''N, 1312 m) in Arizona, USA, and the Johnson-Cousins BVRI filters, we have found lightcurves of 2002 GT (Figure). The Tenagra II 0.81-m telescope is used for research of the Hayabusa2 target Asteroid (162173) 1999 JU_3. The lightcurves (relative magnitude) show that the rotation period of 2002 GT, the target of NASA's Deep Impact/EPOXI spacecraft, is estimated to be 3.7248 Â± 0.1664 hr. On June 9, 2013, we had 7 hours of ground-based observations on 2002 GT from 4:00 to 11:00 UTC. The number of comparison stars for differential photometry was 34. Because of tracking the fast-moving asteroid, it was necessary to have the same comparison star among the fields of vision. We have also obtained absolute photometry of 2002 GT on June 13, 2013.\n\nMalignant pericytes expressing GT198 give rise to tumor cells through angiogenesis.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Liyong; Wang, Yan; Rashid, Mohammad H; Liu, Min; Angara, Kartik; Mivechi, Nahid F; Maihle, Nita J; Arbab, Ali S; Ko, Lan\n\n2017-08-01\n\nAngiogenesis promotes tumor development. Understanding the crucial factors regulating tumor angiogenesis may reveal new therapeutic targets. Human GT198 ( PSMC3IP or Hop2) is an oncoprotein encoded by a DNA repair gene that is overexpressed in tumor stromal vasculature to stimulate the expression of angiogenic factors. Here we show that pericytes expressing GT198 give rise to tumor cells through angiogenesis. GT198 + pericytes and perivascular cells are commonly present in the stromal compartment of various human solid tumors and rodent xenograft tumor models. In human oral cancer, GT198 + pericytes proliferate into GT198 + tumor cells, which migrate into lymph nodes. Increased GT198 expression is associated with increased lymph node metastasis and decreased progression-free survival in oral cancer patients. In rat brain U-251 glioblastoma xenografts, GT198 + pericytes of human tumor origin encase endothelial cells of rat origin to form mosaic angiogenic blood vessels, and differentiate into pericyte-derived tumor cells. The net effect is continued production of glioblastoma tumor cells from malignant pericytes via angiogenesis. In addition, activation of GT198 induces the expression of VEGF and promotes tube formation in cultured U251 cells. Furthermore, vaccination using GT198 protein as an antigen in mouse xenograft of GL261 glioma delayed tumor growth and prolonged mouse survival. Together, these findings suggest that GT198-expressing malignant pericytes can give rise to tumor cells through angiogenesis, and serve as a potential source of cells for distant metastasis. Hence, the oncoprotein GT198 has the potential to be a new target in anti-angiogenic therapies in human cancer.\n\nEXTRAVEHICULAR ACTIVITY (EVA) - GEMINI-TITAN (GT)-4\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n1965-06-03\n\nS65-29766 (3 June 1965) --- Astronaut Edward H.

One remedy is to develop intelligent aiding systems that can provide operators with context-sensitive advice and reminders. The research reported herein proposes, implements, and evaluates a methodology for activity tracking, a form of intent inferencing that can supply the knowledge required for an intelligent aid by constructing and maintaining a representation of operator activities in real time. The methodology was implemented in the Georgia Tech Crew Activity Tracking System (GT-CATS), which predicts and interprets the actions performed by Boeing 757/767 pilots navigating using autopilot flight modes. This report first describes research on intent inferencing and complex modes of automation. It then provides a detailed description of the GT-CATS methodology, knowledge structures, and processing scheme. The results of an experimental evaluation using airline pilots are given. The results show that GT-CATS was effective in predicting and interpreting pilot actions in real time.\n\nMirror asymmetry for B(GT) of {sup 24}Si induced by Thomas-Ehrman shift\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nIchikawa, Y.; Kubo, T.; Aoi, N.\n\nWe carried out the beta-decay spectroscopy on {sup 24}Si in order to investigate a change in configuration in the wave function induced by Thomas-Ehrman shift from a perspective of mirror asymmetry of B(GT). We observed two beta transitions to low-lying bound states in {sup 24}Al for the first time. In this proceeding, the B(GT) of {sup 24}Si is compared with that of the mirror nucleus {sup 24}Ne, and the mirror asymmetry of B(GT) is determined.

Mice were given ad libitum isoprotein diets: (1) standard diet; (2) high-fat diet rich in lard, high-fat diet enriched with 30% of (3) isogenic flax Linola seed cake; and (4) GM GT#4 flaxseed cake; for 96 days. Administration of transgenic and isogenic seed cake lowered body weight gain, of transgenic to the standard diet level. Serum total antioxidant status was statistically significantly improved in GT#4 flaxseed cake group and did not differ from Linola. Serum thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, lipid profile and the liver concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-Î± were ameliorated by GM and isogenic flaxseed cake consumption. The level of pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-Î³ did not differ between mice obtaining GM GT#4 and non-GM flaxseed cakes. The C-reactive protein concentration was reduced in animals fed GT#4 flaxseed cake and did not differ from those fed non-GM flaxseed cake-based diet. Similarly, the liver structure of mice consuming diets enriched in flaxseed cake was improved. Dietetic enrichment with GM GT#4 and non-GM flaxseed cakes may be a promising solution for health problems resulting from improper diet.

A ground truth (GT) catalogue, which contains the locations and sizes of known craters, is important for the evaluation of CDAs in a wide range of CDA applications. Unfortunately, previous catalogues of craters by other authors cannot be easily used as GT. In this paper, we propose a method for integration of several existing catalogues to obtain a new craters catalogue. The methods developed and used during this work on the GT catalogue are: (1) initial screening of used catalogues; (2) evaluation of self-consistency of used catalogues; (3) initial registration from three different catalogues; (4) cross-evaluation of used catalogues; (5) additional registrations and registrations from additional catalogues; and (6) fine-tuning and registration with additional data-sets. During this process, all craters from all major currently available manually assembled catalogues were processed, including catalogues by Barlow, Rodionova, Boyce, Kuzmin, and our previous work. Each crater from the GT catalogue contains references to crater(s) that are used for its registration. This provides direct access to all properties assigned to craters from the used catalogues, which can be of interest even to those scientists that are not directly interested in CDAs. Having all these craters in a single catalogue also provides a good starting point for searching for craters still not catalogued manually, which is also expected to be one of the challenges of CDAs. The resulting new GT catalogue contains 57,633 craters, significantly more than any previous catalogue. From this point of view, GT-57633 catalogue is currently the most complete catalogue of large Martian impact craters. Additionally, each crater from the resulting GT-57633 catalogue is aligned with MOLA topography and, during the final review phase, additionally registered/aligned with 1/256Â° THEMIS-DIR, 1/256Â° MDIM and 1/256Â° MOC\n\n[NRC/GT: Six Year One Research Studies.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nGubbins, E.

The EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) was detected in all cells of both cell lines. The EBV immediate-early BZLF 1 protein (ZEBRA), the early antigen diffuse component (EA-D), and one of the EBV envelope proteins (gp350/220) were expressed spontaneously in small proportions in the cells. EBNA 1, EBNA2, latent membrane protein 1, ZEBRA, and EA-D molecules were then observed by Western blotting in the cells. The lytic cycle was enhanced with treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or n-butyrate. The virus particles were observed in the TPA treated GT38 cells by electron microscopy. Infectious EBV was detected with the transformation of cord blood lymphocytes and also with the induction of early antigen to Raji cells by the supernatants of both cells lines. A major single and minor multiple fused terminal fragments and a ladder of smaller fragments of the EBV genome were detected with a Xhol probe in both cell lines. These epithelial cells lines and viruses will be useful in studying their association with EBV in gastric epithelial cells.\n\nGEMINI-TITAN (GT)-4 - EARTH-SKY - OUTER SPACE\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n1965-06-03\n\nS65-34776 (3-7 June 1965) --- This photograph shows the Nile Delta, Egypt, the Suez Canal, Israel, Jordan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq as seen from the Gemini-Titan 4 (GT-4) spacecraft during its 12th revolution of Earth.\n\nLU60645GT and MA132843GT Catalogues of Lunar and Martian Impact Craters Developed Using a Crater Shape-based Interpolation Crater Detection Algorithm for Topography Data\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSalamuniccar, Goran; Loncaric, Sven; Mazarico, Erwan Matias\n\n2012-01-01\n\nFor Mars, 57,633 craters from the manually assembled catalogues and 72,668 additional craters identified using several crater detection algorithms (CDAs) have been merged into the MA130301GT catalogue. By contrast, for the Moon the most complete previous catalogue contains only 14,923 craters. Two recent missions provided higher-quality digital elevation maps (DEMs): SELENE (in 1/16Â° resolution) and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (we used up to 1/512Â°). This was the main motivation for work on the new Crater Shape-based interpolation module, which improves previous CDA as follows: (1) it decreases the number of false-detections for the required number of true detections; (2) it improves detection capabilities for very small craters; and (3) it provides more accurate automated measurements of craters' properties. The results are: (1) LU60645GT, which is currently the most complete (up to D>=8 km) catalogue of Lunar craters; and (2) MA132843GT catalogue of Martian craters complete up to D>=2 km, which is the extension of the previous MA130301GT catalogue. As previously achieved for Mars, LU60645GT provides all properties that were provided by the previous Lunar catalogues, plus: (1) correlation between morphological descriptors from used catalogues; (2) correlation between manually assigned attributes and automated measurements; (3) average errors and their standard deviations for manually and automatically assigned attributes such as position coordinates, diameter, depth/diameter ratio, etc; and (4) a review of positional accuracy of used datasets. Additionally, surface dating could potentially be improved with the exhaustiveness of this new catalogue. The accompanying results are: (1) the possibility of comparing a large number of Lunar and Martian craters, of e.g. depth/diameter ratio and 2D profiles; (2) utilisation of a method for re-projection of datasets and catalogues, which is very useful for craters that are very close to poles; and (3) the extension of the\n\nA technique for measurement of earth station antenna G/T by radio stars and Applications Technology Satellites.\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKochevar, H. J.\n\n1972-01-01\n\nA new technique has been developed to accurately measure the G/T of a small aperture antenna using geostationary satellites and the well established radio star method. A large aperture antenna having the capability of accurately measuring its G/T by using a radio star of known power density is used to obtain an accurate G/T to use as a reference. The CNR of both the large and small aperture antennas are then measured using an Applications Technology Satellite (ATS). After normalizing the two C/N ratios to the large antenna system noise temperature the G/T or the gain G of the small aperture antenna can then be determined.\n\n78 FR 29810 - Receipt of Petition for Decision That Nonconforming 2003 BMW K 1200 GT Motorcycles Are Eligible...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2013-05-21\n\n...-0061; Notice 1] Receipt of Petition for Decision That Nonconforming 2003 BMW K 1200 GT Motorcycles Are...

The adiponectin gene contains a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position 276 (G/T). The GG genotype of SNP276 (G/T) is associated with lower plasma adiponectin levels and a higher insulin resistance index. Therefore, we examined the influence of SNP276 (G/T) on the plasma level of adiponectin in response to exercise training. Thirty healthy Japanese (M12/F18; 56 to 79 years old) performed both resistance and endurance training, 5 times a week for 6 months. The work rate per kg of weight at double-product break-point (DPBP) was measured. Blood samples were obtained before and after the experiment. Plasma concentrations of adiponectin, HbA1c, insulin, glucose, total, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride were measured. Genotypes of SNP276 were specified. Student's t-test for paired values and unpaired values was used. After the 6-month training period, the work rate per kg of weight at DPBP and the plasma HDL-cholesterol level were significantly improved (P<0.05), while no change was observed in the total plasma adiponectin level. However, the plasma adiponectin level in those with the GT + TT genotype had significantly increased (P<0.05). Additionally, the degree of the decrease in the HOMA-R level was significantly greater in the subjects with the GT + TT genotype than those with the GG genotype (p<0.05). Our results suggest that subjects with the genotype GT + TT at SNP276 (G/T) have a greater adiponectin-related response to exercise training than those with the GG genotype.\n\nGanglioside GT1b protects human spermatozoa from hydrogen peroxide-induced DNA and membrane damage.\n\nPubMed\n\nGavella, Mirjana; Garaj-Vrhovac, Verica; Lipovac, Vaskresenija; Antica, Mariastefania; Gajski, Goran; Car, Nikica\n\n2010-06-01\n\nWe have reported previously that various gangliosides, the sialic acid containing glycosphingolipids, provide protection against sperm injury caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, we investigated the effect of treatment of human spermatozoa with ganglioside GT1b on hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-induced DNA fragmentation and plasma membrane damage. Single-cell gel electrophoresis (Comet assay) used in the assessment of sperm DNA integrity showed that in vitro supplemented GT1b (100 microm) significantly reduced DNA damage induced by H(2)O(2) (200 microm) (p < 0.05). Measurements of Annexin V binding in combination with the propidium iodide vital dye labelling demonstrated that the spermatozoa pre-treated with GT1b exhibited a significant increase (p < 0.05) in the percentage of live cells with intact membrane and decreased phosphatidylserine translocation after exposure to H(2)O(2). Flow cytometry using the intracellular ROS-sensitive fluorescence dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate dye employed to investigate the transport of the extracellularly supplied H(2)O(2) into the cell interior revealed that ganglioside GT1b completely inhibited the passage of H(2)O(2) through the sperm membrane. These results suggest that ganglioside GT1b may protect human spermatozoa from H(2)O(2)-induced damage by rendering sperm membrane more hydrophobic, thus inhibiting the diffusion of H(2)O(2) across the membrane.\n\nTurbomachinery design considerations for the nuclear HTGR-GT power plant\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMcDonald, C.F.; Smith, M.J.\n\n1979-11-01\n\nFor several years, design studies have been under way in the USA on a nuclear closed-cycle gas turbine plant (HTGR-GT).

R.; Abell, P. A.; Benner, L. A. M.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe Deep Impact spacecraft is currently on course for a Jan. 4, 2020 flyby of the sub-kilometer near-Earth asteroid 163249 (2002 GT). The re-targeting will be complete with a final small maneuver scheduled for Oct. 4, 2012. 2002 GT, which is also designated as a Potentially Hazardous Asteroid (PHA), has a well-determined orbit and is approx 800 m in diameter (H=18.3). Little more is known about the nature of this object, but in mid-2013 it will pass near the Earth, affording an exceptional opportunity for ground-based characterization. At this apparition 2002 GT will be in range of Arecibo. In addition to Doppler measurements, radar delay observations with precisions of a few microseconds are expected and have a good chance of revealing whether the system is binary or not. The asteroid will be brighter than 16th mag., which will facilitate a host of observations at a variety of wavelengths. Light curve measurements across a wide range of viewing perspectives will reveal the rotation rate and ultimately lead to strong constraints on the shape and pole orientation. Visible and infrared spectra will constrain the mineralogy, taxonomy, albedo and size. Along with the radar observations, optical astrometry will further constrain the orbit, both to facilitate terminal guidance operations and to potentially reveal nongravitational forces acting on the asteroid. Coordinating all of these observations will be a significant task and we encourage interested observers to collaborate in this effort. The 2013 apparition of 2002 GT represents a unique opportunity to characterize a potential flyby target, which will aid interpretation of the high-resolution flyby imagery and aid planning and development of the flyby imaging sequence. The knowledge gained from this flyby will be highly relevant to the human exploration program at NASA, which desires more information on the physical characteristics of sub-kilometer near-Earth asteroids.\n\nAsymmetric GT of social networks\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSzu, Harold\n\n2010-04-01\n\nWeb citation indexes are computed according to a data vector X collected from the frequency of user accesses, citations weighted by other sites' popularities, and modified by the financial sponsorship in a proprietary manner.

The Gemini launch vehicle is a two-stage modified Titan II ICBM. The major modifications are the addition of a malfunction detection system and a secondary flight controls system. The Gemini spacecraft, designed to carry a crew of two men on earth orbital and rendezvous missions, was unmanned for the flight reported herein (GT-1). There were no complete Gemini flight systems on board; however, the C-band transponder and telemetry transmitters were Gemini flight subsystems. Dummy equipment, having a mass and moment of inertia equal to flight system equipment, was installed in the spacecraft. The Spacecraft was instrumented to obtain data on spacecraft heating, structural loading, vibration, sound pressure levels, and temperature and pressure during the launch phase.\n\nThe National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented (NRC/GT) Newsletter, June 1991-Winter 1997.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nGubbins, E.

White II, pilot for the Gemini-Titan 4 (GT-4) spaceflight, floats in the zero-gravity of space during the third revolution of the GT-4 spacecraft. White wears a specially designed spacesuit. His face is shaded by a gold-plated visor to protect him from unfiltered rays of the sun. In his right hand he carries a Hand-Held Self-Maneuvering Unit (HHSMU) that gives him control over his movements in space. White also wears an emergency oxygen chest pack; and he carries a camera mounted on the HHSMU for taking pictures of the sky, Earth and the GT-4 spacecraft. He is secured to the spacecraft by a 25-feet umbilical line and a 23-feet tether line. Both lines are wrapped together in gold tape to form one cord. Astronaut James A.

Fifteen older adults (61-82 yr) wore a GT3X+ (24 hr/day) and an NL-1000 (waking hours) for 7 d. Day was the unit of analysis (n = 86 valid days) comparing (a) GT3X+ DF and NL-1000 steps/d and (b) GT3X+ LFX and NL-1000 steps/d. DF was highly correlated with NL-1000 (r = .80), but there was a significant mean difference (-769 steps/d). LFX and NL-1000 were highly correlated (r = .90), but there also was a significant mean difference (8,140 steps/d). Percent difference and absolute percent difference between DF and NL-1000 were -7.4% and 16.0%, respectively, and for LFX and NL-1000 both were 121.9%. Regardless of filter used, GT3X+ did not provide comparable pedometer estimates of steps/d in this older adult sample.\n\nConformational analysis of GT1B ganglioside and its interaction with botulinum neurotoxin type B: a study by molecular modeling and molecular dynamics.\n\nPubMed\n\nVenkateshwari, Sureshkumar; Veluraja, Kasinadar\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe conformational property of oligosaccharide GT1B in aqueous environment was studied by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation using all-atom model. Based on the trajectory analysis, three prominent conformational models were proposed for GT1B. Direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonding interactions stabilize these structures. The molecular modeling and 15 ns MD simulation of the Botulinum Neuro Toxin/B (BoNT/B) - GT1B complex revealed that BoNT/B can accommodate the GT1B in the single binding mode. Least mobility was seen for oligo-GT1B in the binding pocket. The bound conformation of GT1B obtained from the MD simulation of the BoNT/B-GT1B complex bear a close conformational similarity with the crystal structure of BoNT/A-GT1B complex. The mobility noticed for Arg 1268 in the dynamics was accounted for its favorable interaction with terminal NeuNAc. The internal NeuNAc1 tends to form 10 hydrogen bonds with BoNT/B, hence specifying this particular site as a crucial space for the therapeutic design that can restrict the pathogenic activity of BoNT/B.\n\nDesigning Ground Antennas for Maximum G/T: Cassegrain or Gregorian?\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nImbriale, William A.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nFor optimum performance, a ground antenna system must maximize the ratio of received signal to the receiving system noise power, defined as the ratio of antenna gain to system-noise temperature (G/T). The total system noise temperature is the linear combination of the receiver noise temperature (including the feed system losses) and the antenna noise contribution. Hence, for very low noise cryogenic receiver systems, antenna noise-temperature properties are very significant contributors to G/T.It is well known that, for dual reflector systems designed for maximum gain, the gain performance of the antenna system is the same for both Cassegrain and Gregorian configurations. For a12-meter antenna designed to be part of the large array based Deep Space Network, a Cassegrain configuration designed for maximum G/T at X-band was 0.7 dB higher than the equivalent Gregorian configuration. This study demonstrates that, for maximum GIT, the dual shaped Cassegrain design is always better than the Gregorian.\n\nKey role of integrin Î±(IIb)Î² (3) signaling to Syk kinase in tissue factor-induced thrombin generation.\n\nPubMed\n\nvan der Meijden, Paola E J; Feijge, Marion A H; Swieringa, Frauke; Gilio, Karen; Nergiz-Unal, Reyhan; HamulyÃ¡k, Karly; Heemskerk, Johan W M\n\n2012-10-01\n\nThe fibrin(ogen) receptor, integrin Î±(IIb)Î²(3), has a well-established role in platelet spreading, aggregation and clot retraction. How Î±(IIb)Î²(3) contributes to platelet-dependent coagulation is less well resolved. Here, we demonstrate that the potent suppressing effect of clinically used Î±(IIb)Î²(3) blockers on tissue factor-induced thrombin generation is linked to diminished platelet Ca(2+) responses and phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure. The same blockers suppress these responses in platelets stimulated with collagen and thrombin receptor agonists, whereas added fibrinogen potentiates these responses. In platelets spreading on fibrinogen, outside-in Î±(IIb)Î²(3) signaling similarly enhances thrombin-induced Ca(2+) rises and PS exposure. These responses are reduced in Î±(IIb)Î²(3)-deficient platelets from patients with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. Furthermore, the contribution of Î±(IIb)Î²(3) to tissue factor-induced platelet Ca(2+) rises, PS exposure and thrombin generation in plasma are fully dependent on Syk kinase activity. Tyrosine phosphorylation analysis confirms a key role of Syk activation, which is largely but not exclusively dependent on Î±(IIb)Î²(3) activation. It is concluded that the majority of tissue factor-induced procoagulant activity of platelets relies on Syk activation and ensuing Ca(2+) signal generation, and furthermore that a considerable part of Syk activation relies on Î±(IIb)Î²(3) signaling. These results hence point to a novel role of Syk in integrin-dependent thrombin generation.\n\nGT-WGS: an efficient and economic tool for large-scale WGS analyses based on the AWS cloud service.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Yiqi; Li, Gen; Ma, Mark; He, Fazhong; Song, Zhuo; Zhang, Wei; Wu, Chengkun\n\n2018-01-19\n\nWhole-genome sequencing (WGS) plays an increasingly important role in clinical practice and public health. Due to the big data size, WGS data analysis is usually compute-intensive and IO-intensive. Currently it usually takes 30 to 40Â h to finish a 50Ã WGS analysis task, which is far from the ideal speed required by the industry. Furthermore, the high-end infrastructure required by WGS computing is costly in terms of time and money. In this paper, we aim to improve the time efficiency of WGS analysis and minimize the cost by elastic cloud computing. We developed a distributed system, GT-WGS, for large-scale WGS analyses utilizing the Amazon Web Services (AWS). Our system won the first prize on the Wind and Cloud challenge held by Genomics and Cloud Technology Alliance conference (GCTA) committee. The system makes full use of the dynamic pricing mechanism of AWS. We evaluate the performance of GT-WGS with a 55Ã WGS dataset (400GB fastq) provided by the GCTA 2017 competition. In the best case, it only took 18.4Â min to finish the analysis and the AWS cost of the whole process is only 16.5 US dollars. The accuracy of GT-WGS is 99.9% consistent with that of the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) best practice. We also evaluated the performance of GT-WGS performance on a real-world dataset provided by the XiangYa hospital, which consists of 5Ã whole-genome dataset with 500 samples, and on average GT-WGS managed to finish one 5Ã WGS analysis task in 2.4Â min at a cost of $3.6. WGS is already playing an important role in guiding therapeutic intervention. However, its application is limited by the time cost and computing cost. GT-WGS excelled as an efficient and affordable WGS analyses tool to address this problem. The demo video and supplementary materials of GT-WGS can be accessed at https://github.com/Genetalks/wgs_analysis_demo .\n\nStructural Characterization of the Foliated-Layered Gabbro Transition in Wadi Tayin of the Samail Ophiolite, Oman; Oman Drilling Project Holes GT1A and GT2A\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDeans, J.

Here we report the structural history of the gabbros reflecting formation at the ridge to later obduction. Magmatic and high temperature history- 1) Both cores exhibit a pervasive, commonly well-defined magmatic foliation delineated by plagioclase, olivine and in places clinopyroxene. Minor magmatic deformation is present. 2) The dip of the magmatic foliation varies cyclically, gradually changing dip by 30o from gentle to moderate over a 50 m wavelength. 3) Layering is present throughout both cores, is defined by changes in mode and grain size ranging in thickness from 2 cm to 3 m and is commonly sub-parallel to the foliation. 4) There are no high temperature crystal-plastic shear zones in the core. Key observations include: no simple, systematic shallowing of dip with depth across the foliated-layered gabbro transition and layering is continuous across this transition. Cyclic variation of magmatic foliation dip most likely reflects the process of plate separation at the ridge axis. Near-axis faulting- i) On or near-axis structures consist of epidote-amphibole bearing hydraulic breccias and some zones of intense cataclasis with intensely deformed epidote and seams of clay and chlorite accompanied by syntectonic alteration of the wall rock. Early veins are filled with amphibole, chlorite, epidote, and anhydrite. ii) The deformation ranges from brittle-ductile, causing local deflection of the magmatic foliation, to brittle offset of the foliation and core and mantle structures in anhydrite veins. iii) The prevalent sense of shear is normal and slickenfibers\n\nSelective propagation of mouse-passaged scrapie prions with long incubation period from a mixed prion population using GT1-7 cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nMiyazawa, Kohtaro; Masujin, Kentaro; Okada, Hiroyuki; Ushiki-Kaku, Yuko; Matsuura, Yuichi; Yokoyama, Takashi\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIn our previous study, we demonstrated the propagation of mouse-passaged scrapie isolates with long incubation periods (L-type) derived from natural Japanese sheep scrapie cases in murine hypothalamic GT1-7 cells, along with disease-associated prion protein (PrPSc) accumulation. We here analyzed the susceptibility of GT1-7 cells to scrapie prions by exposure to infected mouse brains at different passages, following interspecies transmission. Wild-type mice challenged with a natural sheep scrapie case (Kanagawa) exhibited heterogeneity of transmitted scrapie prions in early passages, and this mixed population converged upon one with a short incubation period (S-type) following subsequent passages. However, when GT1-7 cells were challenged with these heterologous samples, L-type prions became dominant. This study demonstrated that the susceptibility of GT1-7 cells to L-type prions was at least 105 times higher than that to S-type prions and that L-type prion-specific biological characteristics remained unchanged after serial passages in GT1-7 cells. This suggests that a GT1-7 cell culture model would be more useful for the economical and stable amplification of L-type prions at the laboratory level. Furthermore, this cell culture model might be used to selectively propagate L-type scrapie prions from a mixed prion population.\n\nOverview of Hole GT2A: Drilling middle gabbro in Wadi Tayin massif, Oman ophiolite\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTakazawa, E.; Kelemen, P. B.; Teagle, D. A. H.; Coggon, J. A.; Harris, M.; Matter, J. M.; Michibayashi, K.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nHole GT2A (UTM: 40Q 655960.7E / 2529193.5N) was drilled by the Oman Drilling Project (OmDP) into Wadi Gideah of Wadi Tayin massif in the Samail ophiolite, Oman. OmDP is an international collaboration supported by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program, the Deep Carbon Observatory, NSF, IODP, JAMSTEC, and the European, Japanese, German and Swiss Science Foundations, with in-kind support in Oman from the Ministry of Regional Municipalities and Water Resources, Public Authority of Mining, Sultan Qaboos University, and the German University of Technology. Hole GT2A was diamond cored in 25 Dec 2016 to 18 Jan 2017 to a total depth of 406.77 m. The outer surfaces of the cores were imaged and described on site before being curated, boxed and shipped to the IODP drill ship Chikyu, where they underwent comprehensive visual and instrumental analysis. 33 shipboard scientists were divided into six teams (Igneous, Alteration, Structural, Geochem, Physical Properties, Paleomag) to describe and analyze the cores. Hole GT2A drilled through the transition between foliated and layered gabbro. The transition zone occurs between 50 and 150 m curation corrected depth (CCD). The top 50 m of Hole GT2A is foliated gabbro whereas the bottom 250 m consists of layered gabbro. Brittle fracture is observed throughout the core. Intensity of alteration vein decreases from the top to the bottom of the hole. On the basis of changes in grain size and/or modal abundance and/or appearance/disappearance of igneous primary mineral(s) five lithological units are defined in Hole GT2A (Unit I to V). The uppermost part of Hole GT2A (Unit I) is dominated by fine-grained granular olivine gabbro intercalated with less dominant medium-grained granular olivine gabbro and rare coarse-grained varitextured gabbro. The lower part of the Hole (Units II, III and V) is dominated by medium-grained olivine gabbro, olivine melagabbro and olivine-bearing gabbro.

Crystal structures of the enzymes in complex with a nonhydrolyzable nucleotide-sugar analogue revealed that there is a conformational transition to create the binding sites for the aglycon substrate. This induced-fit transition was explored by molecular docking experiments with various aglycon substrates. Â© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

A total of 54 canals from 27 mesial roots of mandibular molar teeth were prepared using one of two methods by novice dental students. One canal in each root was prepared by a crown-down approach. utilizing stainless steel Flexofiles and Gates Glidden burs. The other canal was prepared using nickel-titanium GT rotary files in a crown-down fashion as recommended by the manufacturer. Preoperative CT scans of each root were recorded and 50 canal specimens were available for postoperative comparisons. Following canal shaping, postoperative scans were superimposed on the original images. Changes in canal area, canal transportation and thickness of remaining root structure at strategic levels of the root were analyzed. The time taken for each method was also noted. At the coronal and mid-root coronal one-third sections, the rotary GT files produced a significantly smaller postoperative canal area (P < 0.05). In the mid-root sections there was significantly less transportation of the root canal toward the furcation, and less thinning of the root structure with GT files compared to the stainless steel files (P < 0.05). Overall, there was greater conservation of structure coronally and more adequate shape in the mid-root level. The GT rotary technique was significantly faster than the stainless steel hand-held file technique (P < 0.0001). Two GT instruments fractured during the study. Under the conditions of this study, novice dental students were "
