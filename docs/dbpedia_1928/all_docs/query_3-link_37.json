        "text": "Here in New Jersey, it is hot. It is humid. It may even be stormy. Most of all, there is a distinct lack of competitive ice hockey in North America right now. With over a month away before someone wearing the best logo in sports, I can understand if you just want something, anything meaningful in ice hockey to watch. And there is. No, the New Jersey Devils are not doing anything. But there is an international tourney with two New Jersey Devils connections that will make you feel real old (and one that will not). It is time for the 2024 Hlinka-Gretzky Cup.\n\nThe Hlinka-Gretzky Cup is an annual international under-18 ice hockey tournament held in early August. It has been held, albeit under different names, since 1991. It is also not an IIHF tournament; it is run by Hockey Canada, the Czech Ice Hockey Federation, and the Slovak Ice Hockey Federation. It is effectively the start of the draft year as some of the top prospects for the 2025 NHL Draft will compete against each other. It is also where there are even a few underage players, set for the drafts in 2026 and 2027. Some nations use it as an opportunity for some players to shine ahead of their regular season. Others use it to get an idea of what their under-18 team may look like and who to follow through to the season’s end when the World Under-18 Championships come about. And the United States in particular uses it to deepen their pool as they tend to not bring a USNTDP roster. You know those amateur scouts the Devils just hired? They are likely going to pay attention to what is going on in this year’s tournament. As are every other team in the NHL and even outside of the NHL given the European representation.\n\nFor those who want adults playing competitive ice hockey, you will have to wait until the end of August for the final Olympic qualifying groups. In the meantime, let us go over what is happening in this year’s Hlinka-Gretzky Cup.\n\nThe 2024 Hlinka-Gretzky Cup Main Details\n\nThis year’s Hlinka-Gretzky Cup will be held in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Eight countries will be participating in the week-long tournament. Here is a link to the countries and rosters by group. In Group A, there is Canada, Switzerland, Slovakia, and Sweden. In Group B, there is Finland, Germany, Czechia, and the United States. Preliminary games will run from August 5 through August 7 to determine the standings in each group. The schedule of those games is here. Yes, you can spend all afternoon and evening watching hockey for half of next week.\n\nAfter August 7, there is a modified playoff. Fourth place in each group will play for seventh place on August 9. Third place in each group will play for fifth place on August 9. The top two teams in each group will compete in a semifinal. Given that Canada is in Group A, Slovakia, Sweden, and Switzerland will be a dogfight for second place. B may be a bit more open. Losers will play for third place on August 10 and the winners will play for the championship later that day.\n\nFor those in Canada, TSN and RDS will provide full tournament coverage. Here is TSN’s schedule. For those in the United States, NHL Network will broadcast all United States games.\n\nRather than going through all rosters in some kind of depth, I want to highlight a couple of players for each nation. Starting first with the United States because that is who I represent and it has one of the two Devils-related players that will age quite a few of the People Who Matter. (And one that likely will not age you.)\n\nThe United States\n\nBrief History: The USNTDP U-17 team is not this team. The USNTDP U-18 team is not this team either. USA Hockey opts for players outside of the program to give others a chance to represent. Seven players from last year’s roster did get drafted so it is an opportunity to increase your profile. Historically, they have won this tournament exactly once way back in 2003. They do have 9 silvers and 4 bronze medals, including a third place finish in 2023.\n\nSome Players to Know: Because this is a New Jersey Devils site, let me introduce you to the one New Jersey based player on the roster: forward Nicolas Sykora of Roseland, New Jersey. The 17-year old is indeed the son of A-Line alumnus Petr Sykora. Nicolas split his youth hockey between the North Jersey Avalanche and Montclair Kimberly before jumping from the Avalanche to the Long Island Gulls for the 2022-23 season. As a 16-year old last season, he switched out of both Long Island and Montclair to play for Omaha of the USHL. It was an experience for him - especially given how bad the team was - but he figures to play a larger role next season. In addition to being draft eligible, he is committed to Quinnipac for 2026-27.\n\nJesse Orlowsky of Brooklyn, New York was a teammate of Sykora for part of the 2022-23 season. Orlowsky came up through Long Island in his youth hockey and got an early taste of USHL hockey with Waterloo last season. Orlowsky is already big at 6’3” and 205 pounds with a right-handed shot as a winger. He is also smart as he has committed to Harvard University for 2026-27. He even has experience representing the country as he was part of the 2023 U-17 Five Nations team that finished second.\n\nHow about another player with NHL bloodlines? Vernon Fiddler’s son Blake Fiddler is a large 17 year old defenseman who already played a season of WHL hockey with the Edmonton Oil Kings. The Nashville-born Fiddler came up through Okanagan Hockey Academy and Dallas Stars Elite before the Oil Kings brought him in last season. Blake Fiddler did represent Canada at the World Hockey Challenge as a U-17. That he is on this roster suggests he may switch to America full-time.\n\nLastly, forward Travis Hayes deserves your attention. He is 16 until September 3 which will make him one of the youngest draft eligibles for 2025. The right winger is also the other CHL based player on this roster as he suited up for the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds. Major junior hockey for a 16 year old is tough. Hayes put up 14 goals and 35 points which is impressive. Enough to warrant selection to the OHL’s First All-Rookie Team, a group that features some serious talent from Canada (and in this tourney).\n\nCanada\n\nBrief History: Canada has dominated this tournament. Dominated. They have won this 24 times. They won it last year. It is rare that they do not win it all and even rarer that they do not finish with a medal. You cannot go wrong expecting Canada to win this tourney.\n\nSome Players to Know: Canada’s most skilled player on their roster is expected to go first overall in 2026. Yes, 2026. It is the starlet Gavin McKenna. The next Connor Bedard? The next Connor McDavid? The next...well, himself? He has already exploded onto the scene. He put up 97 points as a 16 year old in his rookie season with Medicine Hat of the WHL. Forget Rookie of the Year (which he won), he was named to the main First All-Star team in the WHL. He absolutely torched the 2024 World Under-18 Tournament with 10 goals and 20 points in 7 games, leading Canada to a gold medal while being a double-underager. McKenna may have his first and only Hlinka-Gretzky experience. Expect a show from him.\n\nGoing back to 2025 eligible players, one of the players already being discussed for a first round selection is center Caleb Desnoyers. He made the jump to major junior hockey very well as he put up 20 goals and 56 points as a rookie last season with Moncton. Desnoyers earned that QMJHL All-Rookie Team nod. He was also on the 2024 World Under-18 team with five points in five games. Desnoyers could be someone to stand out even outside of McKenna’s spotlight.\n\nAdditionally, those interested in the higher end of the 2025 draft class should get familiar with defenseman Matthew Schaefer. He also made the OHL All-Rookie team with Travis Hayes last season. Schaefer is a fast defenseman with the Erie Otters. While 17 points in 56 games may not seem like much, that is not bad for a 16 year old defender. Likewise, he showed up more productive when representing Canada at both the World Hockey Challenge, where he captained team White and the World Under-18 Championship. If he breaks out with Erie this season, then it will likely start here.\n\nAnother OHL All-Rookie Team selection from last year is center Jake O’Brien. More than that, he was named the OHL Rookie of the Season with an impressive 13 goals and 51 assists for 64 points in 61 games for Brantford. Outside of a Canada Red representation at the World Hockey Challenge, the Hlinka-Gretzky Cup will be O’Brien’s first chance to represent the country. Between this tourney and a sophomore campaign with Brantford, O’Brien may make a lot more noise for the 2025 NHL Draft.\n\nLastly, Canadian goaltending has been an issue at this level for quite some time. Without getting into the potential reasons why Canada has ceased being a goalie factory, allow me to highlight a potential oasis amid this desert: Jack Ivankovic. The Mississauga-born goalie jumped into the OHL last season and posted a very fine 91.5% save percentage in 25 games. He also backstopped Canada White at the World Hockey Challenge with a 92.3% save percentage in eight games. Ivakovic was even selected, but did not play, in the World U-18 Championships. Provided he outdoes Lucas Beckman, this tournament could show he is not just a potential goalie for the 2025 NHL Draft but someone the nation can rely on in this youth tournaments.\n\nSweden\n\nBrief History: Do you like finishing third? Sweden has done it the most out of the nations in this year’s tournament with eight bronzes, most recently in 2021. They have finished second four times and won it all only once way back in 2007.\n\nSome Players to Know: Here is the second Devils connection in this tournament. Defenseman Sascha Boumedienne has made the Swedish roster. His dad is former Devils draft pick (1996, fourth round), Albany River Rat player, and very well traveled defenseman Josef Boumedienne. Sascha was born in Oulu, Finland, played all of his youth hockey in Ohio, set for Boston College next season, and has represented the Tre Kronor in between. He has a very solid USHL season with Youngstown last season and showed up well for the Swedish U-17 team. Boston College will definitely be a jump up in competition. Should he do well, his early draft hype will persist.\n\nSweden looks to get back into the first round for 2025’s NHL Draft and forwards like Viktor Klingsell will likely be a part of it. He has worked his way up the youth levels with Skelleftea AIK with appearances at the U-18 and U-20 teams last season. Keep in mind that he turned 17 in February 2024 so he was very much underage on both rosters. Klingsell was productive at the World Hockey Challenge last season as well as in Sweden’s U-18 league. Should he do well at the U-20 level, even get a look in the SHL, and progress with Sweden, Klingsell will be a name to get familiar with. This tourney may very well be the start of it.\n\nHere is another player with a NHL bloodline: Eric Nilson. His dad was former Flame and Panther forward Marcus Nilson. Eric was born in Calgary but he has been all about Swedish hockey. He has been with Orebro HK at the U-16, U-18, and U-20 levels lasts season with strong production in those latter two categories already. Like Klingsell, a strong 2024-25 campaign could see his name rise up the draft rankings and have his name called out.\n\nWant a third one to get familiar with before he potentially rises up draft rankings? How about one with the second most exotic nationality combos in the tournament? Right winger Jakob Ihs-Wozniak was born in Adelaide, Australia. Like Eric Nilson, his hockey has been all in Sweden. He is already quite large at 6’3” and he put up a stunning 22 goals and 50 points with Lulea HF in the U-20 league. He even got two appearances with the main team in the SHL. Not to mention making and playing in seven games for Sweden at the World Under-18 Championships. He could take another step forward and potentially be a first rounder. A good H-G performance will help him start that effort for the Aussie-Swede (Auswedie?) winger.\n\nOne of the best names that will appear in this tourney is goaltender Love Harenstam. Harenstam has come up though Lulea HF’s system and did OK at the U-20 level with a 90.5% save percentage in 11 games. Where he impressed some would be at the World Under-18 Championships. He played in all 7 games for Sweden and posted a 91% save percentage. In a short tourney, any experience helps and the Swedes may, er, love having Love in the net.\n\nOne last name and this one is for 2026. Someone to potentially compete with Gavin McKenna. The name is Viggo Bjorck. He turned 16 in March. He also dominated the U-18 Region league that IFK Taby played in. Viggo dropped 33 goals and 98 points in just 36 games. No one in the region leagues put up more points; he led his squad to the championship, and his U-17 appearances have been loaded with points. Djurgardens will have him in 2024-25. Should he play like a star in Edmonton next week, the 2026 draft class could get a whole lot more interesting at the top. Canada-Sweden on August 7 could be one to watch for these two starlets alone.\n\nCzechia\n\nBrief History: While they have been involved in hosting and running the tournament, they do not always have the best history. They won this tournament just once back in 2016. They did finish second nine times, including last year’s tournament. As Czechia’s youth movement grows, perhaps they will obtain more success in years to come.\n\nSome Players to Know: One of the early hopes for the first Czech drafted in 2025 is center Adam Benak. Benak is a product of HC Plzen’s youth system and has represented Czechia at the U-17 and U-18 levels before he turned 17 in April 2024. He even played in 18 games for Plzen’s main team in the top Czech league last season. Curiously, he has made a switch to Youngstown of the USHL for 2024-25. That would normally indicate a willingness to go to the NCAA. Given his 18 games with HC Plzen, I am not sure if he remains eligible. Then again, with NIL, I’m not sure what the rules will even be after 2025. He may be small and slight, but the fact that he has played above his age many times already should suggest he has the skills to hang.\n\nSpeaking of players who played above his age level, check out left winger Tomas Poletin. After two seasons in HC Slavia Praha’s system, he made a switch to Lahti Pelicans in Finland. He was productive enough at the U-18 level with 12 points in 10 games to get 21 games with the U-20 team. He put up 14 points in 21 games, which is quite nice. Also, he turned 17 at the end of April so he did a lot of that as a 16-year old. All the while he was productive at the World Hockey Challenge and appeared in five games with the World U-18 Championship team. Poletin could get more attention should he thrive with the U-20 Pelicans team and even get to see some of the Liiga. This tournament could set that tone.\n\nSince big defenseman are back in style and right-hand shooting defenseman are always in demand, I would expect scouts to want to see how Radim Mrtka does. Mrtka turned 17 back in June and he is already 6’6” and just shy of 200 pounds. He has been with HC Ocelari Trinec over the last two seasons. I would say 2023-24 was a major step forward as he played 18 games with the U-17 team, 19 with the U-20 team, and made three appearances with the main team in the Czech league. What is more is that he represented the nation at both the World Hockey Challenge and World Under-18 Championships. This season will show if the growth will continue. But if he can continue to produce and show he moves well for his size, do not be shocked if he gets a lot of attention from scouts throughout 2024-25.\n\nSwitching back to smaller, potentially flashier forwards, Czechia’s Vit Zahejsky will be one to look for just to see how he handles it. He will turn 17 by the time the tournament ends, which makes him one of the multiple 16 year olds on this Czech roster. Like Benak, Zahejsky broke out at the U-20 level last season with HC Energie Karlovy Vary. Clearly too good for U-17 play with 12 points in 5 games (and 67 points as a 15 year old in 2022-23), the U-20 team benefitted from Zahejsky putting up 19 goals and 39 points in 42 games. The production continued into the postseason with 7 points in 7 games. He was good enough to get two looks with the main team. He did not make the World Under-18 Championship roster. I would like to think he will make a point of it to show he belongs for 2025. This tournament is the place to begin that effort.\n\nSlovakia\n\nBrief History: Despite being involved in the tournament and often hosting it, Slovakia has often finished outside of the podium. They have one silver medal, won in 2021 and two bronze medals, won in 1997 and 1998. Only Japan has fewer medals than Slovakia in this tourney’s history. Yes, Japan was where this tournament began and that was back in the 1990s. At least Slovak hockey is improving.\n\nSome Players to Know: Let me get this out of the way. Ihs-Wozniak of Sweden has the second most exotic nationality combo in this tournament. The first easily belongs to Bratislava-born goaltender Roberto Leonardo Henriquez. Yes, that is not really a name you would expect in Slovakia. Per his EP profile, he has a Dominican Republic nationality - which helps explain the name. He also may have a fair shot of some attention for 2025’s draft too. He has been tending the crease for HC Slovan Bratislava’s youth teams and his numbers are great. In 2022-23, he put up a 93.3% save percentage with 32 games at the U-16 level. Last season, he split time between the U-18 and U-20 teams with a 94.7% and 93.9% save percentages, respectively. RLH is not that big at 6’1” and just shy of 160 pounds. But the save percentages suggest he knows what to do. They are better than his fellow and bigger goalies on this roster, Patrik Brezani and Michal Pradel. If he can get some action in this tournament and even play up further with HC Slovan Bratislava, then do not be shocked if the Dominican-Slovak ends up on someone’s draft board.\n\nHere is another player to get out of the way. Forget 2025 or 2026. Slovakia is providing a 2027 draft eligible player in 15-year old Timothy Kazda. Already 6’0” and 181 pounds, the forward has been plying his trade with the Seacoast Performance Academy in America as opposed to a Slovak or another European team. I do not know if this is meant to keep his eligibility for college, make a move to the USHL in the future (Chicago Steel has his rights), get the attention of a major junior team. Or if it is something to get him prepared before going back to Slovakia or another country. That Slovakia is bringing him to this tournament at all is worth noticing.\n\nGoing back to a 17 year old, center Jan Chovan is a bit of a rarity in this tournament. He has actual experience. He was on Slovakia’s team last season. He put up a goal and three assists in four games. He proceeded to go back to Barkov City Tappara and blossom. He put up 31 points in 20 games with the U-18 squad and earned 30 games with the U-20 team. There, seven goals and 13 points is not bad for an underage player. His play warranted inclusion on the Slovak World Under-18 Championship team where he got into 7 games. Chovan should be expected to be a leader on this roster given his experience. Further development will only help his cause to have his name called in June 2025.\n\nOn the blueline, look for Polish-Slovak defenseman Patryk Zubek. Born in Poland, he actually started his youth hockey with Podhale Nowy Targ. But he switched to Slovakia for his club hockey in 2022-23 and never looked back. He put up a heap of ponts with the U-18 team of Barani Banska Bystrica; 38 points in 38 games. Last season, he stayed with the U-20 team for a massive 51 points in 45 games featuring 42 assists. Coming close to averaging an assist per game is quite impressive. While held pointless at the World Under-18 Championships, the large defender (he’s 6’3” and 201 pounds at age 17) will likely get another shot. If the last two seasons are any indication, he could very well take another step forward.\n\nLastly, a third Devils connection. And this one will not age you all that much either. It is Simon Nemec’s younger brother, forward Adam Nemec. With an October 18, 2007 birthdate, Adam is a 2026 draft eligible player. Still, there is a lot of potential on hand. The 16 year old absolutely crushed it with the HK Nitra U-20 team with 28 goals and 57 points in 43 season games along with four goals and eight points in 11 playoff games. Adam Nemec made 3 appearances with HK Nitra’s main team, got a brief loan for 3 games with HC Toplcany’s main team in Slovakia’s second tier, and made some appearances for Team Slovakia’s team. All while suiting up for the Slovak U-17 and U-18 national teams including seven games at the World Under-18 Championships. Adam Nemec did a lot already. What he will do as a follow up could continue to impress. You know his brother will support him. You may look for him as well.\n\nGermany\n\nBrief History: Germany has not appeared all that much in this tourney. They have also never won anything. Any medal they earn will be the first. Germany is still in a secondary tier of European hockey. But they are trying to make strides to be competitive. Tournaments like this one only help them understand how far they have come and what they need to do to get where they want to go.\n\nSome Players to Know: Among the German roster, one player will get real familiar with Canadian major junior hockey. 17-year old defenseman Max Bleicher is making the move to the OHL for Owen Sound in 2024-25. He has been a standout for EV Fussen. He scored a ton at the U-17 level, briefly played in the U-20 level, and played most of 2023-24 for their main team. Which is in the third tier of German hockey. But it is still pro hockey to some level. Bleicher has represented Germany at the U-16, U-17, and U-18 levels with the latter coming mostly from Division 1A of the World Under-18 Championships. Should Bleicher take well to OHL hockey, he will get attention from the hockey world.\n\nThe leading scorer from that German team that won World Under-18 Championships Division 1A was 5’7” and, I almost do not believe this, 128 pound winger Dustin Willhoft. He was named the best forward of that tournament and put up two goals and six assists in five games to help Germany move up to the main World Under-18 Championships. Willhoft has done most of his development outside of Germany. He was with Rogle BK’s youth teams from 2021-22 to a part of 2023-24. He switched back to Germany and played primarily for Jungadler Mannheim’s U-20 team. He did quite well with 23 points in 16 season games and 14 points in five playoff games. Again, he showed out at the international level. I am not sure what his next step is but a strong performance here can only help that out.\n\nThere may be some attention paid to left winger David Lewandowski. He has been all about Dusseldorf EG. He played there in his youth. He played for their U-15, U-17, and U-20 teams over the last five seasons. Last season, he was a standout at the U-20 level with 15 goals and 48 points. He even got a loan to play for ESC Moskitos Essen of the German third tier. 10 points in 13 games is not at all shabby for pro hockey, even if it is third tier hockey in Germany. Like Willhoft, Lewandowski was a standout at the Division 1A tournament last year with 2 goals and 7 points in five games. With a larger frame than Willhoft, he may get a bit more notice. Even more if he ends up playing for Dusseldorf EG’s main team in the DEL in 2024-25.\n\nAdditionally, there is the Spanish-German forward Mateu Spath. He has come through EC Bad Tolz up through this past season. The forward put up nearly a point per game with their U-20 team in 17 games. Then he ended up with their main team, Tolzer Lowen, in the German third tier. No, do not ask me why the badge has EC Bad Tolz but the team is called Tolzer Lowen. There, he stuck with them in 37 games and put up 12 goals and 23 points. Not bad to finish outside of the top ten in team scoring for a 17 year old player in a pro league. While he di dnot have the most amazing time in division 1A’s tourney, EP has him set to play for Kolner Haie of the DEL next season. Should that work out, Mateu Spath could be a darkhorse selection out of Germany.\n\nLastly, there is a surprise (to me) New Jersey connection on this team. Not a Devils one, but a youth hockey one. German-American goaltender Nikita Kluev made the roster after appearing for New Jersey Rockets last season. This is more of a footnote but every little bit helps.\n\nSwitzerland\n\nBrief History: See Germany, except Switzerland has a better league and has had more success with developing prospects for the pro game beyond the National League.\n\nSome Players to Know: Swiss-Dutch defenseman Guus van der Kaaij will finally get to play in a major tournament. After three seasons in St. Moritz, he switched to Davos and started playing his way up. He even represented the Swiss U-16 national team and later U-17 and U-18 teams, albeit outside of tournaments like this one, the World Hockey Challenge, and the World Under-18 Championships. Last season saw van der Kaaij captain the Davos U-17 team, be an assistant captain on the Davos U-20 team, and set him up for a potential debut at the National League level in 2024-25. Onward and potentially upward for van der Kaaij.\n\nIt is a similar story for center Florian Schenk. Schenk’s pathway has been with Bern. Productive at each youth level, he captained the U-17 team in 2022-23 and primarily moved up to the U-20 team in 2023-24. He has appeared for Switzerland on the international level but not in any specific tourney. He has done quite well on the scoresheet, with 17 points in 22 games in all U-17 competitions. He is still listed as having a junior contract. Let us see if HC Bern (or someone else) changes that. A good showing here would not hurt that cause.\n\nOne of my favorite names in this tournament is Canadian-Swiss left winger Jeremiah Mundy. Also known as Jeremiah Justice Mundy. You have to use that name. It is too good. His EP profile lists he has a brother named Shawn Liberty Mundy. I like it. Very likely to be far better than Liberty Buchanan. Wasteland references aside, Mundy is 6’2”, nearly 200 pounds, and has been on the rise in the Swiss youth ranks. After plying his time with Davos, he switched to Rapperswil for the last two seasons. He followed up an 18 points in 22 games campaign with the U-17 team in 2022-23 with a 26 goals, 44 points in 38 game campaign with that team in 2023-24. He also just turned 17 in February. He appears to be back with Davos and expected to suit up for their U-20 team next season. This tourney could be a place for him to show what he could to there as a start.\n\nRounding out the players to know for the Swiss team, check out 2026 draft eligible forward Lars Steiner. Like van der Kaaij, he has come up through the HC Davos system. Unlike him, he is a forward and has actually made appearance for HC Davos’ main team last season. In the playoffs, actually. This followed a rather successful season with their U-17 and U-20 teams. Keep in mind that he is 16 until November 2024. I would expect he spends more time with the U-20s in 2024-25 but a couple of more tastes of the NL could be in store for Steiner. He is someone to keep in the back of your mind.\n\nFinland\n\nBrief History: Finland’s narrative in international play seems to be icing rosters that do not seem as good as possible on paper but overperform. This has not been in the case in this tourney. They have earned just five medals all time: two silvers (most recent: 2012) and three bronzes. They did take bronze in 2022 and finished fourth in 2023 so they will compete to a point.\n\nSome Players to Know: Finnish defenseman Jesper Kotajarvi could be among the earliest Finnish names called at the 2025 NHL Draft. Kotajarvi has come up through Hermes’ youth teams and even played four games for the main team back in 2022-23. They are a Mestis team and not a Liiga team. Tappara, who is in Liiga, took notice, signed him, and put the 17-year old with their U-20 team. He put up 23 points in 37 games in U-20 season play and six points in eight games in the postseason. Kotajarvi also represented Finland at the U-17 World Hockey Challenge, putting up five points in seven games. He is someone to keep an eye on for sure.\n\nLikewise, look to forward Max Westergard. With a September 3, 2007 birthdate, he is one of the youngest draft eligible players for 2025. But the skill is real. He played for Lukko’s U-16 and U-18 teams in 2021-22 and 2022-23 before moving over to play for Frolunda HC last season. With 17 goals and 29 points in U-18 regional play, 12 goals and 33 points in 14 games at U-18 national play, and four points in six U-20 national games, I would say he fit in Swedish hockey like a glove. He is still very much in the mix for Finland as he played a bit in the World Hockey Challenge and played 18 total games with the national U-17 team last season. A strong season and possible SHL look could only elevate his profile.\n\nFinland’s top scorer at the WHC last season was forward Rasmus Kamarainen with four goals and six points. It was a highlight among a productive set of international appearances. He is a product of Jokerit, crushing it at the U-16 level in 2022-23 with 40 points in 22 games and the U-18 level last season with 22 points in 20 games. Kamarainen also played in 14 games at the U-20 level with a more modest five points. Still, playing in multiple games as a 16-year old (he turned 17 in June) in an age group filled with players three or four years older is impressive. He signed with Assat for next season. How he does here and with his new team could add him as another potential Finnish pick in 2025.\n\nRounding out this group, look to goaltender Patrik Kerkola. The KalPa product has consistently played above his age group since his EP profile started in 2021-22. The numbers are a bit modest. 22 games with the U-18s as a 15-16 year old yielded an 89.7% save percentage in 2022-23. Last season, he primarily played with the U-20 team with an 88.6% in 23 games. However, there are signs that Kerkola has a future. He got a brief debut with KalPa’s Liiga team last season and even appeared on loan to IPK for two playoff games. This also included four games at the WHC and inclusion (but did not play) on the World Under-18 Championship roster. He split his net at the WHC with Jooa Sammalniemi last season and shares the crease with him for this tournament, so he has a bit or work to do. But Kerkola can only help his cause by doing well, something Finland may need.\n\nA Prediction and Your Take\n\nMy Be Strong, Be Wrong Prediction: History will continue to repeat and Canada will win the whole thing. Gavin McKenna will likely do some amazing things to continue to put the hockey world on notice for 2026.\n\nThe real benefit will be for those who scout prospects for 2025. The biggest names for 2025’s draft are not here since James Hagens is a USNTDP player, Porter Martone and Michael Misa are not here, and Anton Frondell and Luka Radiovojevic are also absent. This means players who standout will get a boost to their profile for the draft. Not to mention a boost for potential selection for future U-18 tournaments, the big one being the Worlds next Spring.\n\nMost of all, it’s competitive hockey in early August. It starts Monday. If you have access to TSN, you can watch the whole thing. If you have access to the NHL Network, you can at least see the Group B teams play as well as the semifinals and medal games. I recommend checking it out instead of constantly refreshing X to see if Dawson Mercer has been signed.\n\nNow I want to know your takes. Who else should people pay attention to in this tournament? Will you be checking it out amid this desert of meaningful North American hockey? Will anyone stop Canada in Edmonton this year? Please leave your answers in the comments. Thank you for reading."
