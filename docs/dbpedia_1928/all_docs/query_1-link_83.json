It is a way to highlight their achievements, let the ACBS community know important work students are doing, and provides a platform for mentoring/collaboration/professional development/conversations around highlighted areas.\n\nDeveloping Nations World Conference Scholars:\n\nACBS is an international society but in many corners of the world it is difficult for professionals to attend ACBS conferences and trainings due simply to cost. The Developing Nations Fund helps disseminate CBS in the developing world and provides scholarships for attendees and presenters from developing nations to attend the world conference.\n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion World Conference Scholars:\n\nThe Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee is aiming to bring increased diversity to our annual conferences by providing funds for individuals who come from diverse backgrounds and who would not be able to attend an ACBS conference without this added financial support. Both trainees and professionals are eligible for this competitive award.\n\nEarly Career Research Paper Award:\n\nThe Award recognizes an outstanding empirical research abstract from an early career researcher, with the goal of stimulating that person’s long term participation in the ACBS conference as an outlet for presenting empirical science within the broad domain of CBS.\n\nMichael J. Asher Student Dissertation Award:\n\nThis award is given to students based on their doctoral dissertation proposal related to the use of Contextual Behavioral Science with children/adolescents. Michael J. Asher, Ph.D., ABPP passed away in 2016 and was a clinical psychologist at Behavior Therapy Associates, P.A. since 1988. He was passionate about his work, loved psychology, cognitive behavior therapy, and especially enjoyed learning about and practicing Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT).\n\nACBS Foundation Student Scholarship:\n\nA goal of the ACBS Foundation is to support existing activities within ACBS. The ACBS Foundation Student Scholarship will enable students to attend the annual ACBS World Conference. The scholarship will cover the full student conference registration fee.\n\nStudent World Conference Scholars:\n\nThe mission of the ACBS Student Special Interest Group is to work to support students of contextual behavioral science by advocating for their professional and personal development and facilitating their contribution to ACBS and the larger community. One step in moving towards this mission has been to create a Student World Conference Scholarship that will help subsidize the costs of attending the annual ACBS World Conference.\n\nAwards for Special Services to ACBS/CBS\n\nACBS Diversity Award:\n\nThe ACBS Awards Committee has established an annual award focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion. This Diversity Award is given to one qualifying ACBS member each year who disseminates CBS work aimed at advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion.\n\nOutreach and Impact Award:\n\nThis award acknowledges individuals for their unique contributions to the development and dissemination of Contextual Behavioral Science.\n\nFellowships\n\nACBS Fellows:\n\nFellowship in the Association for Contextual Behavioral Science is meant to recognize professionals with a terminal degree who have made strong and positive contributions to Contextual Behavioral Science. Our focus is deliberately broad. Fellowship can be awarded early, mid, or late career; contributions may be in research, scholarship, training, public information, policy, prevention, organizational work, practice, or any other area of CBS and of the Association; substantive areas include philosophy of science, basic, and applied domains. Fellowship is a membership status in ACBS, but may be offered contingently to those who are not yet members.\n\nGrants\n\nACBS Research Development Grant:\n\nThe ACBS Research Development Grant provides financial support for research that advances the field of Contextual Behavioral Science (CBS). The purpose of this grant is to provide financial support for high quality, innovative original research projects.\n\nACBS staff January 29, 2018 - 3:15pm\n\nACBS Diversity Award\n\nACBS Diversity Award\n\nThe ACBS Awards Committee invites nominations and applications to this annual award focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion. This Diversity Award will be given to one qualifying ACBS member each year who disseminates CBS work aimed at advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion. Specifically, the award focuses on dissemination of work across categories including gender, race, ethnicity, language, income, sexual/gender identity, religion, neurodiversity, and disability. This work can be disseminated through research publications, teaching, clinical work, and/or community service.\n\nRequirements:\n\n1. Candidates must be a member of ACBS.\n\n2.

Self-nominations and nominations of others are encouraged.\n\nApply here by 30 September!\n\nAward Recipients:\n\n2023 Awardee - Khamisi Musanje\n\n2022 Awardee - Brian Middleton\n\n2021 Awardee - Yiyi Wang, University of Toronto\n\noffice_1 June 3, 2021 - 1:47pm\n\n2021 Diversity Award\n\n2021 Diversity Award\n\nSelected for the 2021 Diversity Award is Yiyi Wang, University of Toronto (she was nominated by Jonathan Tarbox)\n\nI am a multilingual international PhD student and I am passionately pursuing my program of research, which has combined applied behavior analysis (ABA) and Acceptance and Commitment Training (ACT), inside a contextual behavioral framework, for expanding behavioral science into more diverse populations that have traditionally been under-addressed by contextual behavioral science research. Children with autism from multicultural backgrounds are often diagnosed at a later age compared to white and English-speaking children. As a result, parents with diverse cultural backgrounds face more challenges given the lack of behavior therapists who understand or speak their native languages in the United States. Despite substantial research validating ABA approaches to supporting individuals with autism, little attention is paid to the role of cultural diversity and multilingualism in treatment. To address this gap in the field of ABA, I led the team that published the article “Multilingual Diversity in the Field of Applied Behavior Analysis and Autism: A Brief Review and Discussion of Future Directions” in the journal, Behavior Analysis in Practice. In this article, we discussed the ways in which cultural diversity, equity, and multilingualism might be better addressed within the field of ABA. Instead of recommending families receive service in English only (as is still common), we recommended that clinicians ask families about their values and cultural preferences. We recommended that a child’s treatment plan be based on culturally appropriate goals, positive reinforcers, first language, and otherwise be customized to the family’s culture. Additionally, we proposed future directions to promote diversity in ABA, including recruiting more international students in graduate programs, enhancing diversity curricula, and initiatives by professional associations. The paper was presented and won the poster competition at the California Association for Behavior Analysis Annual Convention.\n\nIn addition to autism, I continue to pursue the importance of diversity and equity in other populations and domains. Under the supervision of Dr. Jonathan Tarbox, I completed my master’s thesis, “The Effects of Multilingual Acceptance and Commitment Training (ACT) on Exercise in Bilingual University Students.” I used a multiple baseline to evaluate the effects of a multilingual ACT program for bilingual international college students who valued increasing their physical activity. The study demonstrated that ACT was effective when delivered in a combination of both English and Chinese in helping all participants to substantially increase their daily steps taken, frequency of gym visits, and work out duration. No previous research, of which we are aware, evaluated bilingual ACT for increasing physical activity in a culturally diverse population. This paper has been presented at several conferences and was published in the Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science in August 2020.\n\nIn sum, using contextual behavioral science to promote diversity and equity in behavioral research is my passion and I believe this award will help me share my successful programs of research with more individuals on how to combine applied behavior analysis and ACT, inside a contextual behavioral framework, for more fully addressing topics of diversity, equity, and inclusion.\n\noffice_1 November 10, 2021 - 12:12pm\n\n2022 Diversity Award\n\n2022 Diversity Award\n\nSelected for the 2022 Diversity Award is Brian Middleton, Bearded Behaviorist (he was nominated by Summer Mingo & Clinton Fuller)\n\nIn the last year I have been working to further awareness of and inclusion of neurodivergent populations in human services, most specifically ABA. I have been fighting for disability rights, for trauma-informed and neurodivergent affirming practices, and disseminating ACT.\n\nBrian has generously donated his free conference registration to a DEI scholarship applicant to be selected by the ACBS Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee.\n\noffice_1 October 28, 2022 - 10:53am\n\n2023 Diversity Award\n\n2023 Diversity Award\n\nSelected for the 2023 Diversity Award is Khamisi Musanje (he was nominated by Rosco Kasujja)\n\nWhile ACT and other related mindfulness and acceptance based therapies have enjoyed a great breakthrough in the developed world, the developing world has lagged behind on this experience. An automatic copy and paste approach would quicken the spread of such therapies in the developing contexts (where they are needed most), however, the realization that contexts affect the effectiveness of psychotherapy puts a caution on such a simplistic approach. Besides, there is strong evidence that most psychotherapies coming from the developed West, fall short of expectations when used in completely different settings.\n\nMy colleagues and I, out of passion for extending the use of ACT to a developing context (Uganda), embarked on a journey to culturally translate ACT materials for use with adolescents living with HIV in Uganda. We engaged local mental health experts and others stakeholders involved in HIV care services to produce materials with cultural relevance. We further tested acceptability of the adapted materials among adolescents and health care providers in Uganda (materials were perceived to be acceptable, relevant and usable). We are currently evaluating effectiveness of the adapted materials in supporting the mental health of adolescents in a low resource context (Uganda) through a randomized trial.\n\nI have disseminated the adaptation process and results on social validity of the material in two scientific publications; PLOS Global health journal; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0001605, and the Journal of Contextual Behavioral Sciences; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2023.07.002. I have presented the work in the 16th and 17th Joint Annual Scientific and Health Conferences-JASHC 2022 and 2023 organized in Uganda and presented at the Association of Contextual Behavioral Scientists world conference in Nicosia- Cyprus. Besides, I have held stakeholder feedback workshops with both healthcare providers and adolescents and also held one online meeting with the Ministry of Health in Uganda to kick start conversations regarding inclusion of mindfulness and acceptance strategies into standard of care services offered to adolescents living with HIV in Uganda.\n\noffice_1 November 13, 2023 - 9:13am\n\nACBS Fellows\n\nACBS Fellows\n\nFellowship in the Association for Contextual Behavioral Science is meant to recognize professionals with a terminal degree who have made strong and positive contributions to Contextual Behavioral Science. Election as an ACBS Fellow is an honor and all Fellows are expected to meet the standards of professional ethics and scientific integrity.\n\nOur focus is deliberately broad. Fellowship can be awarded early, mid, or late career; contributions may be in research, scholarship, training, public information, policy, prevention, organizational work, practice, or any other area of CBS and of the Association; substantive areas include philosophy of science, basic, and applied domains. Fellowship is a membership status in ACBS, but may be offered contingently to those who are not yet members.\n\nThe first few years of the Fellowship determination resulted, purposefully, in some large classes of Fellows. That number was not intended to set a precedent for future years. In more recent years we have settled into the more sustainable tradition of 4-6 Fellows. This is the class size that is seemingly appropriate to our Association size. No more than 6 Fellows will be awarded each year.\n\nCurrent Fellows of ACBS can nominate new candidates. The nomination period is approximately early January through mid-February, each year. The ACBS Membership Committee facilitates the process of identifying ACBS Fellows. The Fellows Timeline, Fellows rubric information and Fellow Qualification Policy are attached at the bottom of this page.\n\nInducted in 2024\n\nDayna Lee-Baggley, Ph.D.\n\nRichard Bennett, Psy.D.\n\nClaudia Drossel, Ph.D.\n\nShuanghu Fang, Ph.D.\n\nRamona Houmanfar, Ph.D.\n\nJason Lillis, Ph.D.\n\nInducted in 2023\n\nMark R Dixon, Ph.D.\n\nEvelyn Gould, Ph.D.\n\nRosco Kasujja, Ph.D.\n\nAnthi Loutsiou, Psy.D.\n\nJennifer Shepard Payne, Ph.D.\n\nKoa Whittingham, Ph.D.\n\nInducted in 2022\n\nGeorg Eifert, Ph.D.\n\nValerie Kiel, MSc.\n\nChristopher McCurry, Ph.D.\n\nSusan McCurry, Ph.D.\n\nRuth Anne Rehfeldt, Ph.D.\n\nMatthew Skinta, Ph.D.\n\nRoger Vilardaga, Ph.D.\n\nRobert Zettle, Ph.D.\n\nInducted in 2021\n\nMegan Kelly, Ph.D.\n\nRhonda Merwin, Ph.D.\n\nJean-Louis Monestès, Ph.D.\n\nJoe Oliver, Ph.D.\n\nKenneth I.

My thesis aimed to develop a body image-related cognitive fusion questionnaire and analyse the impact of this construct on eating psychopathology. During this time I was a clinical psychology intern at the Psychiatric Unit of the Coimbra University Hospital, where I was trained in CBS clinical practise. After my MSc I did a professional voluntary internship where I applied ACT in women with eating difficulties. At this time, I became a collaborator at CINEICC (University of Coimbra), a research centre with a strong focus on CBS, and later a PhD student at the same centre. My PhD studies have two main focuses. The first is the analysis of the impact of processes such as experiential avoidance, cognitive fusion, and shame on psychological and physical outcomes in chronic illness, which has provided interesting findings on the importance of these processes in several chronic health conditions. The most relevant published paper from my PhD studies to date has longitudinally demonstrated that cognitive fusion predicts the evolution of psychological as well as physical health among inflammatory bowel disease patients. The second focus of my PhD was to integrate acceptance, mindfulness and compassion-based psychotherapies in one intervention adapted to cancer patients, the MIND (as in “mentality” and “care”) programme. I applied this intervention to groups of breast cancer patients as principal therapist. The feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the intervention have been demonstrated (paper under review).\n\nAutobiography:\n\nI was born and raised in Coimbra, a city in the centre of Portugal. I’m a 4th year PhD student in Clinical Psychology at CINEICC, University of Coimbra, Portugal, working with Dr. José Pinto-Gouveia and Dr. Cláudia Ferreira. I discovered mindfulness meditation in my adolescence and have stuck with it almost ever since. In my master’s I started professional training in contemplative practices and CBS. Choosing to study CBS in chronic illness came from a personal motivation. Having been diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease at 15, my late adolescence was marked by the adaptation to the illness, which now, after 12 years, I can say will probably never be over. This is my motivation to study chronic illness (and in particular inflammatory bowel disease) in my PhD studies, and I hope I am able to continue to do so. In my spare time I love to read and travel to places I’ve never been to. I’m also passionate about vegan cooking, interior design, and photography.\n\nFuture goals:\n\nAfter my PhD, I have two main goals. The first is to adapt the MIND programme to inflammatory bowel disease and to test its efficacy on psychosocial outcomes on this population; the second (and more far away) goal is to test the effects of mindfulness and related processes on inflammation and other disease markers in inflammatory bowel disease patients.\n\nRelevant publications:\n\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjhp.12280/abstract\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00384-017-2774-z\n\nhttp://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1359105315587142\n\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2035/abstract\n\nhttp://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1359105317718925\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10620-015-3786-6\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10862-015-9509-7\n\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2125/abstract\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11136-016-1378-3\n\nhttp://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03630242.2016.1267688\n\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/papt.12047/full\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019566631400227X\n\nhttp://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1359105315573438\n\noffice_1 February 11, 2020 - 3:56pm\n\nStudent Spotlight Award Recipient - Adam Kuczynski\n\nStudent Spotlight Award Recipient - Adam Kuczynski\n\nCongratulations to Adam Kuczynskion being selected as the Student Spotlight Award winner for September 2020!\n\nThe purpose of this award is to highlight students who are doing important work in the CBS community whether for research, clinical, and/or volunteer-humanitarian efforts. This is a way to highlight their achievements, let the ACBS community know important work students are doing, and possibly provide a platform for mentoring/collaboration/professional development/conversations around highlighted areas.\n\nLearn more about Adam:\n\nBackground of CBS Research/Clinical/Volunteering efforts/achievements:\n\nI am, at my core, a functional contextualist. My first experience in research was with Dr. Marsha Linehan, where I workid on a federally funded randomized trial of DBT for suicidal and self-harming adolescents. It was there where I was trained to view behavior from a functional perspective, influenced greatly by other third-wave therapies such as ACT and FAP. Shortly thereafter, I began working with Drs. Kohlenberg and Tsai in their efforts to establish a stronger empirical literature for FAP. Fast forward several years and I am now a fifth year graduate student at the University of Washington, where I have continued to pursue contextual-behavioral research agenda. For my master’s thesis, I led a multi-site scale development project aimed at measuring intimate relational functioning for use in FAP outcomes research. Since then, I have worked to develop CBS-informed interventions for couples and therapists at high risk of burnout, evaluated the current state of empirical research on FAP, and pursued research that aims to reduce the perpetration of racial microaggressions. Now, I am a lead researcher and study therapist on the largest-to-date randomized trial of FAP. My clinical work is also heavily influenced by CBS. I have worked with several clients in both inpatient and outpatient settings using ACT, FAP, and comprehensive DBT. I have reviewed several manuscript submissions for JCBS and served as the student representative for the FAP special interest group of ACBS since 2015. Last year, I served as a reviewer for the ACBS student spotlight awards.\n\nAutobiography:\n\nI am incredibly fortunate for the opportunities offered to me throughout my lifetime. As an undergraduate at the University of Washington, I worked with Dr. Marsha Linehan on a federally funded trial of DBT for adolescents who, despite their best efforts, struggled to build worth living. Shortly thereafter, Drs. Robert Kohlenberg and Mavis Tsai took me into their lab and trained me in the fundamental principles of FAP and contextual behavioral science. When Dr. Jonathan Kanter moved to the University of Washington, he hired me as his first research coordinator and then graduate student, we we have worked together on a variety of research projects aimed at improving social functioning and decreasing the perpetration of racial microaggressions. I am truly a product of my social environment and have worked diligently in my graduate career to pass my fortune along, particularly for underrepresented individuals in psychological science (e.g., students of color, first-generation students). For my dissertation, I am using idiographic research methods to understand how momentary feelings of loneliness are associated with changes in depressive symptomatology and hope to inform contextual-behavioral treatment efforts aimed at reducing the burden of these afflictions.\n\nFuture goals:\n\nAfter graduate school, I hope to continue pursuing a research agenda focused on the ways in which social functioning outcomes can be improved by bridging the gap between CBS and relationship science.\n\nPublications:\n\nKuczynski, A.

My undergraduate thesis (in press in JCBS) examined the relationships between health values directed behavior and engagement in health-related behaviors. My first PhD study, examining adaptive correlates of adolescents’ generalized pliance, was also recently published in JCBS. I am currently extending this line of research, doing much-needed work to consolidate theoretical perspectives on rule-governed behavior, and using text-based conversational agents (chatbots) to promote flexible rule-following. Beyond my PhD research, I am the lead on a systematic review examining the use of metaphor in ACT and on a project evaluating brief ACT interventions for academic procrastination (funded by the Higher Education Authority). I recently contributed to a paper using the Functional Self-Discrimination Measure with members of the homeless population and I am coordinating a large cross-cultural study with CBS labs around the world. I am passionate about dissemination and making CBS accessible. In addition to publishing manuscripts and presenting CBS research at national and international conferences, I produce CBS videos and blog posts with an abundance of pop culture references to facilitate effective and engaging knowledge transfer. I am also currently contributing to outreach programs that aim to provide the public with CBS skills to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., the #FEELINGBetter initiative and Power of Small Workshops). I truly believe CBS can alleviate human suffering if we strive to collaborate, engage in effective knowledge transfer, and produce high-quality research, all practices I am committed to.\n\nAutobiography:\n\nI’m from Dublin, Ireland, and was the first in my family to attend university, graduating from University College Dublin with a BA in Psychology. I was introduced to CBS by my BA thesis supervisor, Professor Louise McHugh, who then took me on for my PhD. Now in the second year of my PhD, I realize how exceptionally lucky I’ve been. Being able to work and grow within the CBS community, while having an exemplary mentor who truly cares about my development, is an absolute privilege. CBS has completely changed my life, from the philosophical approach I adopt in my research, to the ACT techniques I use to manage everyday living. Through the CBS community, I have met amazing friends and collaborators who have been instrumental in supporting my research. Being able to conduct cross-cultural research within a range of contexts has been invaluable, allowing me to start making a serious contribution to the CBS literature. My main topic of interest is rule-following with regard to cultural context, gender, and socio-economic status. I am currently trying to enhance our understanding of rule-following in accordance with RFT and developing interventions to enhance adolescents’ flexible rule-following. When I am not stressing about my PhD, you can find me crying over the “purple book” and justifying my Netflix binging by saying it facilitates me living in line with my value of “Connection”. I still have a lot to learn, but I am beyond grateful for the opportunity to do so within our CBS community.\n\nFuture goals:\n\nI want to continue increasing accessibility to CBS and engaging in collaborative projects alongside CBS labs around the world to stay in academia and make a meaningful contribution to the ACBS community.\n\nRelevant publications:\n\nStapleton, A.

After becoming completely captivated by what Relational Frame Theory and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy had to offer, I worked to expand my understanding of the relationship between complex verbal behavior and our environment, in generating and refining tools such as ACT to more systematically and efficiently support individuals, and in closing the gap between research and practice within complex verbal behavior and psychological well-being.\n\nI volunteered at the University of Southern California, where I worked with the students and faculty to develop and conduct research in ACT. Examples of projects include the effects of ACT on staff burnout in ABA, physical health of college students, ACT for individuals with developmental disabilities, and studying the effects of components of ACT on delay discounting. I have also worked with a team of scientist-practitioners in the development of the ACT Functional Analysis.\n\nDuring my time as a Clinician/BCBA, I was given many opportunities to train others in my field on how to incorporate RFT and ACT into their programming. Simultaneously, I was a co-author of an article outlining how ACT may be useful in promoting psychological flexibility at the beginning of the pandemic, and for the chapter on ACT in ABA in the Oxford Handbook of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. I regularly present at conferences in the form of posters and symposia, in addition to the occasional workshop or invited talk for ABA and ACT organizations.\n\nAutobiography:\n\nI completed my master’s degree in Psychology (Applied Behavior Analysis) at California State University, Sacramento, where I studied verbal behavior and stimulus equivalence. Through evaluating verbal behavior around my own struggles, I realized that it plays an important role in psychological well-being and the way that we experience the world around us, leading to my obsession with ACT and RFT.\n\nRealizing then that my lifelong academic journey was just beginning, I moved to Los Angeles to receive training and supervision in ACT. During this time, I worked as a Senior Research Associate at the University of Southern California under the supervision of Dr. Jonathan Tarbox and as a Lab Manager for the ACT/Prosocial lab with Dr. Thomas Szabo. With the support of my mentors, I worked to build upon my existing knowledge in verbal behavior, relational frame theory, and ACT, while participating in several publications and conference presentations along the way. As a result of my mentors’ ongoing support, I have also been invited to give additional trainings for BCBAs to do my part in closing the gap between research and practice.\n\nI am currently working on my PhD in Rehabilitation Sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago, under the co-supervision of Dr. Mark Dixon and Dr. Tamar Heller. This has allowed me the opportunity to continue basic, translational, and applied research in complex verbal behavior and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, while also working towards making a career out of my greatest passion by becoming a professor.\n\nFuture goals:\n\nI hope to contribute to our understanding of complex verbal behavior at the group and individual levels for the purpose of refining current interventions (e.g., ACT, Prosocial) to make them more individualized, systematic, effective, and efficient.\n\nRelevant publications:\n\nTarbox, J., Chastain, A.

I began my journey by researching psychological flexibility and emotion regulation in undergraduate students. In addition, my interest in CBS sparked my applied ACT work with clinical populations. In the past few years, I have expanded my use of ACT and other mindfulness-based approaches (ERT) to in clinical populations including college students, adult outpatient, adult inpatient, and medical populations. Through my doctoral work, I have become increasingly interested in co-occurring psychological and physiological difficulties. My doctoral dissertation examined how risk of opioid misuse is affected by pain severity, pain interference, and early aversive histories in patients with noncancerous chronic pain. My data analysis suggested that psychological flexibility (examined by the AAQ-II) plays a significant and specific role in many of these pathways, providing important information on the developing opioid crisis in the United States and around the world. I look forward to presenting this data in an accepted symposium at ACBS World Conference 16 titled “ACT for People with Pain: What We Still Have to Learn.” Next year, I am continuing my CBS journey through an APA-accredited internship at Brattleboro Retreat (Vermont, US) rolling out ACT for trauma in uniformed service personnel and a Mind-Body Pain Management program.\n\nAutobiography:\n\nI was born and raised in the suburbs of New York City. I am currently a 4th doctoral candidate in Combined Clinical and School Psychology at Kean University. Before my doctoral studies, I received a Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology from Lehigh University in Bethlehem, PA. I’ve been developing my theoretical orientation in contextual behavioral science my whole life, but just didn’t know it. Long hikes with my dad to remote mountain peaks were exercises in mindfulness -- tuning into the beauty of nature while observing, with curiosity, variations in my inner human experience. Growing up with the freedom to pursue my dreams and take responsibility for my own life was existentialism before I even knew how to spell it. Ultimately, I was drawn instantly to ACT with its blend of mindfulness- and acceptance-based behaviorism and values-based existentialism. I have been studying, exploring, and applying ACT since the day it was introduced to me and I look forward to a life time of inquiry and curiosity in the CBS community. Now that my dissertation is defended, I have been able to shift my attention towards other important life values like yoga, hiking with my dog, Karl, and spending time with family, friends, and husband.\n\nFuture goals:\n\nIn the near future, I have two main goals. The first is to conduct more research on the underlying mechanisms influencing the subjective experience of physical pain and become certified in Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) in order to expand my applied clinical work with pain populations. My second goal (value) is to lean in to the 'full catastrophe' of everything that life as to offer and the many challenges ahead as I develop my professional identity as a future clinical health psychologist.\n\noffice_1 February 12, 2020 - 9:07am\n\nStudent Spotlight Award Recipient - Anne I. Roche\n\nStudent Spotlight Award Recipient - Anne I. Roche\n\nCongratulations to Anne I. Roche on being selected as the Student Spotlight Award winner for March 2021!\n\nThe purpose of this award is to highlight students who are doing important work in the CBS community whether for research, clinical, and/or volunteer-humanitarian efforts.\n\nThis is a way to highlight their achievements, let the ACBS community know important work students are doing, and possibly provide a platform for mentoring, collaboration, professional development, and conversations around highlighted areas.\n\nLearn more about Anne I. Roche:\n\nBackground of CBS Research/Clinical/Volunteering efforts/achievements:\n\nMy research as a graduate student has focused on the association between acceptance and mindfulness processes and behavioral, physical, and psychological outcomes. I have studied acceptance and mindfulness across the lifespan, from adolescence to older adulthood. My principal aim is to contribute to the identification of modifiable targets for psychological intervention. My dissertation project, mentored by my wonderful advisor Dr. Natalie Denburg, is a randomized controlled trial examining the impact of group ACT on psychological outcomes (e.g., well-being) in community-dwelling older adults. Older adults inevitably experience a variety of life changes, and the limited research focused on promoting well-being in this population is a diversity issue at both an individual and societal level. I am hopeful that my dissertation will provide useful insights into the potential utility of acceptance- and mindfulness-based interventions in this growing proportion of our population. Concurrently, our group is working to validate existing ACT measures this population. Most recently, I have contributed to research examining mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and how ACT processes may serve as protective factors during this time period.\n\nClinically, I have had strong training in ACT and other CBS-based interventions from mentors such as Dr. James Marchman and Dr. Emily Kroska at the University of Iowa. Beyond the excellent training in my graduate program, I have sought additional in-person and online training workshops from CBS practitioners. I have had the opportunity to deliver CBS-based interventions in a variety of different settings and with both individuals and groups with diverse presenting concerns. I have delivered ACT interventions with domestic violence victims (group setting), with domestic violence offenders (individually), and with community-dwelling older adults (group setting). Additionally, I have had the opportunity to provide tiered teaching and supervision to junior clinical psychology students in delivering evidence-based behavioral interventions.\n\nAutobiography:\n\nI am a sixth-year graduate student at the University of Iowa, where I am mentored by Dr. Natalie Denburg. I am currently completing my clinical internship at the University of Kansas Medical Center. I was introduced to ACT during my first year of graduate school, and I was immediately hooked. I have had the opportunity to be trained in functional contextualism by exceptional teachers such as Dr. James Marchman and Dr. Emily Kroska who have instilled in me a passion for learning, delivering, sharing, teaching, and living ACT. I have now had the chance to attend three ACBS World Conferences which have inspired and fed my curiosity and desire to learn. I hope to pursue a career that allows me to combine clinical, research, teaching, and supervision activities that will contribute to the CBS community and help to impact lives with CBS approaches.\n\nOutside of my graduate training, my values include my amazing and loving family and my dear friends. Years ago, I played college basketball, and I still very much enjoy following sports, being active, and spending time outdoors.\n\nFuture goals:\n\nI hope to pursue a career that allows me to explore, deliver, teach/supervise, and disseminate ACT and other CBS-based interventions.\n\nRelevant publications:\n\nKroska, E.B., Roche, A.

It changed the course of my life professionally and personally. I was working in the fine arts field at the time, and decided to switch careers and eventually pursue a PhD in Clinical Psychology. This was because I saw the potential of CBS to help so many people who were suffering deeply. It also expanded my own worldview in a way that has brought me so much joy. Professionally, I worked full time in an ACT for psychosis lab with Brandon Gaudiano at Brown University for two years. Brandon taught me how to be a scientist. I then entered grad school where I have been conducting research for four years with Michael Levin and Michael Twohig in the ACT Research Group at Utah State University. My research focuses on widespread dissemination of ACT through accessible self-help means in order to fill critical caps in public health. For instance, my dissertation project is a clinical trial of antidepressants versus a storytelling-based ACT intervention for individuals who are not currently working with a mental health professional. I also work as a therapist in an ACT speciality clinic where I treat both community members as well as Division I student-athletes at Utah State.\n\nAutobiography:\n\nI relate strongly to the notion of the wounded healer. A number of my family members struggled with addictions or mental health challenges when I was growing up. Embracing ACT has helped me, years later, to view their stories as complicated and courageous. I was raised in New York City, where I was fortunate to “grow up fast” and encounter cultures from all around the world. As early as I can remember, I wanted to be an artist, and I went on to study printmaking at the Rhode Island School of Design. I worked in a handful of fine arts printing presses and fell in love with the beauty and tradition of this discipline. However, an opportunity to volunteer to teach art at a psychiatric hospital nearly ten years ago changed the course of my career. I am now a 4th-year PhD student in Clinical Psychology at Utah State University. I have completely fallen for the beauty and spaciousness of the Mountain West and how it compares to my urban upbringing. I recently started painting after many years, and it has been very meaningful to awaken this part of myself again. I also lead occasional meditation groups in my city, which I see as an important means of building wellness and community.\n\nFuture goals:\n\nI hope to become a clinical psychologist who both provides treatment and conducts research so that CBS can touch even more areas where there is suffering.\n\nRelevant publications:\n\nDavis, C.H., Gaudiano, B.A., McHugh, L., & Levin, M.E.

My research in ACT initially focused on obsessive-compulsive and related presentations, especially hoarding, and broadened to functionally defined presentations like clinical perfectionism. My dissertation examined the effect of ACT on clinical perfectionism and, more broadly, tested the feasibility of using a process-based approach to treat a functionally defined concern. Currently, my research focuses on evaluating interventions and assessments through the lens of process-based therapy and using theory and data to make treatments more parsimonious, effective, and accessible to those who need them. I have also used ACT in my clinical practicums in various formats including individual therapy in a community clinic and group therapy in a residential eating disorder treatment center. While ACT is a central piece of my work, I see clinical RFT, functional contextualism, and the model of process-based therapy as comprising the theoretical backdrop for my research and clinical endeavors. Thus, I strive to actively incorporate scientific principles, empirical evidence, and considerations of individual characteristics in my case conceptualizations and study designs. Given my value of supporting others in their pursuit of fulfilling lives, I hope to use my knowledge and skills to develop effective, efficient, and accessible treatments so the mental health field can maximize the positive impact of available resources.\n\nAutobiography:\n\nI spent the first 18 years of my life in Singapore and attended college in Massachusetts where I grew to value social consciousness and activism. My value of equity has driven me to investigate ways to make helpful treatments more accessible and to consider how intersecting identities influence the people with whom I work including clients and colleagues. I have been living in Utah for the past 4.5 years attending graduate school at Utah State University. This is where I fell in love with the mountains and rock climbing, which is what you will find me doing when I am not working or sleeping. Besides climbing, I like reading, watching The Great British Bakeoff, scrolling through dog adoption webpages, and learning how to make downward-facing dog a resting pose in yoga.\n\nFuture goals:\n\nMy goal is to use my knowledge and skills to develop effective, efficient, and accessible treatments that will empower people to move toward the life they freely choose for themselves.\n\nRelevant publications:\n\nOng, C.

This basic work has previously been used to develop theories about clinical communication (i.e. how clinicians should talk to their clients to maximise treatment effectiveness), such as the use of metaphors in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. My PhD is seeking to understand the precise contribution that rule-governed behaviour plays in this process. Additionally, I am working on a rule-governed behaviour study looking at the role that generalised pliance plays within educational choice in low-income communities, as in Ireland, many individuals from underprivileged communities do not attend college despite it being free. Coming from a similar low-income background, I believe that my basic research can go on to produce better outcomes in these communities. I have published research around rule-governed behaviour and COVID-19 public health adherence in the past. I have also volunteered in a number of roles for the Association for Contextual Behavioral Science (ACBS), most notably as the incoming President of the Contextual Philosophy of Science Special Interest Group within ACBS, as well as a number of smaller roles such as a member of the EvoSci Special Interest Group Sprint Group, in which we set out to better clarify the purpose of the group. Overall, I am a passionate CBS researcher and an engaged member of ACBS.\n\nAutobiography:\n\nI recall being interested in psychology from a very young age, primarily stemming from a will to understand why people act badly when there is so much good in the world. This interest guided me very gradually to a to a lecture on relational frame theory (RFT) that I attended as a second year undergraduate student. The elegance of the theory instantly captured my interest more than anything I had ever come across prior to that, and since then I have spent countless hours studying RFT in order to better understand it and to understand how I can contribute to it. This passion brought me to the University College Dublin Contextual Behavioural Science lab, where I conduct research under the supervision of Professor Louise McHugh and with the guidance of the other lab members. The level of brilliance that emanates from this lab is like nothing I have ever witnessed, and I believe that the support and kindness of its coordinator and members, past and present, is the key to the research that comes out from it.\n\nOutside of my research I am a keen reader with a particular fondness for the Irish writer James Joyce. I have written about Joyce and CBS principles for public readership in the past. I am also a keen musician – when I was younger I knew I wanted to be a famous musician if I couldn’t be a psychologist.\n\nFuture goals:\n\nI aim to continue to work a basic RFT researcher and to explore the philosophical foundations of CBS and the developmental account of derived relational responding.\n\nRelevant publications:\n\nMcCloskey, C., Stapleton, A., Collins, S., Hagshenas, P., Kelly, J., Kenny, S., Rodin, C., & McHugh, L.

Though my traditional cognitive behavioral therapy knowledge was useful in this setting, I noticed that my patients, many of whom had been living with their chronic illness for years, responded positively to Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). This informed my decision to gain more intensive ACT training by working with Miranda Morris and Evan Marks at their ACT-focused private practice, True North, so I could better understand the theoretical underpinnings of this orientation. At True North, I became familiar with how functional contextualism, relational frame theory, and CBS inform ACT, which has greatly enhanced my clinical practice. After training at True North, I continued my CBS-informed training at NIH to learn how to better tailor my ACT interventions to diverse patient populations living with chronic illness and undergoing stem cell transplants. At NIH, I am developing a project focused on how illness identity is informed by principles of CBS and how the medical and psychological communities can better support individuals affected by lifelong chronic illness. I am also involved on a novel research protocol investigating the feasibility and efficacy of ACT for sleep disturbance in patients with sickle cell disease. For this project, I am providing sleep training from an ACT perspective to sickle cell patients. Furthermore, I regularly attend CBS workshops hosted by ACBS practitioners in my geographic area and across the country.\n\nAutobiography:\n\nMy first experience with chronic disease was when my father was diagnosed with medullary thyroid cancer. As a young girl, I did not fully grasp the intensity of his cancer treatment and how it impacted his physical and mental health. It was only years later when he shared a diary he kept of his treatment experiences that I began to understand what he went through. This diary not only opened my eyes to the pain and isolation he experienced as a cancer patient, but also his resilience in a time of great adversity. My reflections upon his cancer journey and the lasting impact it had on me and my family drove me to pursue a career dedicated to supporting the emotional needs of medical patients navigating challenging diagnoses.\n\nWhen I started graduate school, learning therapy filled me with excitement as my professional dreams were becoming fully realized. Beneath my enthusiasm, I had questions about how certain therapeutic techniques would generalize to medical patient populations. How would I use cognitive restructuring with a cancer patient who has concerns about remission? How would I adapt behavioral activation for someone with a disability status due to their chronic condition? These questions lead me to learning ACT and I immediately felt at home in its theoretical orientation. ACT helps me conceptualize my chronic illness patients from a more humanistic perspective and less diagnostically. As I look towards my future career, I hope to continue helping patients improve their quality of life through values-based living.\n\nFuture goals:\n\nMy career goal is to clinically and empirically apply principles of contextual behavioral science to improve the quality of life of individuals and caregivers impacted by chronic illness.\n\nPEER-REVIEWED BOOK CHAPTERS\n\nCox, D.

In joining a research lab devoted to optimizing ACT for individuals with obesity and eating disorders, I have had the opportunity to receive extensive research and clinical training in these interventions. As my interest in ACT – and CBS more broadly – has grown, I have begun pursuing an independent line of research devoted to identifying and evaluating mechanistic factors that influence ACT treatment outcomes for individuals with obesity. Recently, I completed my CBS-driven Master’s thesis project, in which I dismantled and isolated the values component of ACT for weight control, developed an analog values-based weight loss intervention, and evaluated target engagement of theorized mechanisms inherent in the valuing process. I have also developed of the field’s first measure of values clarity and values awareness, presented my independent CBS-based research at four national conferences, and co-authored two manuscripts and book chapters on innovations in ACT for obesity and physical activity. In tandem with my research, my clinical interests have grown to center around CBS interventions for individuals with weight and eating disorders, anxiety disorders, and mood disorders. In my current practicum placement and study therapist roles, I have been able to deliver ACT in both group and individual treatments. I have also had the opportunity to receive supervision in the application of CBS principles for weight and eating disorders, and to provide didactic training to my peers.\n\nAutobiography:\n\nI am a native Californian who was born and raised in Los Angeles. After receiving my Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from the University of California, Los Angeles, I worked as a research coordinator at the UCLA Anxiety and Depression Research Center. Currently, I am a third year Clinical Psychology doctoral student at Drexel University working under the mentorship of Evan Forman, Ph.D., where my clinical and research interests center around developing and improving treatments for individuals with obesity and eating disorders. In particular, I am interested in the use of mindfulness and acceptance-based treatments to understand and intervene on cognitive and affective mechanisms that maintain unhealthy eating. Upon completion of my doctoral training, I hope to continue integrating ACT into my research and practice as a clinical psychologist for individuals struggling with behavioral health disorders. I believe my continued efforts to grow as an ACT practitioner will aid in my ability to help individuals build lives in line with the values that drive them. In pursuit of a values-driven life of my own, I enjoy reading, performing at open mic nights, watching musical theater, and spending quality time with loved ones (and their dogs).\n\nFuture goals:\n\nUpon completion of my doctoral training, I hope to continue integrating ACT into my research and practice as a clinical psychologist for individuals struggling with behavioral health disorders.\n\nPublications:\n\nLillis, J., Dallal, D.H., & Forman, E.M.

My research program focuses on three key strategic areas. First, my research has centered on understanding the process of change within the CBS. Over the past few years, I have concentrated on assessing the conceptual and psychometric validity of various measures within the CBS. I have applied both traditional and modern test theory techniques to establish validity evidence for recently developed measures. Furthermore, I have investigated the roles of each process in various contexts, such as eating disorders and mood disorders. Second, I have examined potential risk and protective factors for mental health within diverse populations. Hawai‘i, due to its racial diversity, has provided an ideal environment for my research, and I have recently expanded the understanding of this population within the framework of the CBS. Finally, my interest extends to the application of innovative modalities in intervention sciences. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, novel forms of psychotherapy have gained widespread adoption, and I have conducted research on the effectiveness of metaverse psychotherapy. My ultimate goal is to explore the effects of psychotherapies informed by CBS within newly developed platforms, such as the metaverse or virtual reality.\n\nAutobiography:\n\nI am currently a fourth-year doctoral student pursuing clinical psychology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. My academic focus centers on understanding the intricate, dynamic, and transdiagnostic aspects of psychological flexibility. To achieve this, I am keen on employing diverse methodologies, including item response theory, network analysis, and mixed-effect modeling. My educational background includes a bachelor's degree in Psychology and a master's degree in Clinical and Counseling Psychology, both earned from Korea University. Additionally, I have accumulated over five years of experience in Sri Lanka, Laos, and Thailand, actively contributing to international development initiatives aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Outside my academic pursuits, I relish spending quality time with my family, exploring the beautiful landscapes of Hawaii, particularly its picturesque mountains and beaches.\n\nFuture goals:\n\nI aspire to pursue a career as a clinical researcher in an academic setting to contribute to the advancement of scientific knowledge in the field of CBS.\n\nPublications:\n\n11.
