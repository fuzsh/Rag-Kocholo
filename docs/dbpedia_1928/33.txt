West Ham are giving a trial to Swedish striker Robert Lipovac.

The 18-year-old plays for BK Hacken but his club have given him permission to visit West Ham this week where he is training with the club's U21 squad.

His representative Linus Jacobsson said: 'West Ham sent an official invitation to Hacken, who thought it was good timing and a good experience for Robert, so they released him for a week.

'He has just completed his second training session with West Ham U21 and stays until Sunday.

'Obviously, the interest from West Ham is flattering and we'll see what it leads to after this week.'

The Hammers are currently short up front following injuries to Andy Carroll and Carlton Cole, which could see new signing Nene fast tracked into action against Crystal Palace.

The 33-year-old Brazilian forward arrived last week on a free transfer and manager Sam Allardyce admits recent injuries have forced his hand in Saturday's team selection.
