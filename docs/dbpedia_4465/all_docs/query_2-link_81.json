        "text": "Conversations With My #2 Son\n\nLast weekend when we were driving in San Antonio, we, of course, were listening to our Sirius XM radio. Specifically, channel 23, which had become the all-Neil Diamond station in honor of the singer-songwriter’s new album.\n\nDiamond’s new CD, “Dreams,” features him singing covers of his favorite songs. One of them is Elton John’s “Can You Feel the Love Tonight.” One good thing about Neil is that he really enunciates every word, which, according to my younger son, Sir Elton never did.\n\nMy #2 son: “Did he just say ‘wild-eyed wanderer?'”\n\nMe: “Yes, he did. Those are the lyrics.”\n\n#2: “Oh. I thought it was ‘one-eyed unicorn.'”\n\nSure, that makes so much sense!\n\nDriving With an Old Fogie\n\nI truly love satellite radio. To me it’s worth it to pay extra for no commercials. However, I’d consider going back to FM if it meant I could control the radio when the Mister is driving. Why? His choice of stations.\n\nThree years might not seem like a long time, but it’s enough of a span that it means the Mister, who is 60, loves 50s music and the 50s on 5 XM channel. Which I do not. Slow and boring just doesn’t suit me. I much prefer the 60s on 6 and even the 70s on 7; I believe that the best music produced was from 1964 (e.g., the British Invasion) to about 1975.\n\nI control the radio in my car, while the Mister rules the airwaves in his as I fume not so silently (as in, “Isn’t it about time to get hip, Grandpa?”). Meanwhile, our #2 son is oblivious to this musical warfare as he silently sits in the back with his earbuds firmly in place.\n\nMust be nice to be plugged into your iPhone’s iPod, listening to music about one-eyed unicorns!"
