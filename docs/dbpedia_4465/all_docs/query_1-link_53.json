        "text": "Please be careful when selecting the carpet color. We have many color options to choose from, and some shades are very similar. Do not rely on the name of your existing carpet to match a color we offer. The color of the samples below may vary, depending on the calibration of your monitor. If you are not 100% certain of the correct color, please allow us to send you samples by .\n\nStock Interiors is proud to offer the highest quality aftermarket Pontiac Astre carpet kits and floor mats available to the industry. All flat carpet is cut from the same high quality carpet that our molded carpet and cut and sewn carpet kits are made from. If you purchase your extra yardage at the same time as your Pontiac Astre molded carpet, then your flat carpet will be cut from the same roll, assuring you of a perfect color match. All yardage will come in a length of 1 yard, and if you order multiple yards, they will come as one piece."
