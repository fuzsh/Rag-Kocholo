        "text": "Disclosure: This site may receive compensation from some link clicks and purchases.\n\nMe too, me too, is sometimes how Pontiac’s relationship with Chevrolet went. There was the Camaro-Firebird competition, then the Nova-Ventura cousins, the Vega-Astre relationship, and even a Chevette-T1000 why bother deal. Now why one would want a brand engineered Vega or Chevette is beyond me but marketers seemed to have a way of making things come together, whether they should have or not. We’ve covered plenty of Vegas but not too many Pontiac Astres so today, we’ll turn our attention to a 1976 version that is harboring a surprise. This diminutive Poncho is located in Nampa, Idaho, and is available, here on craigslist for $10,500.\n\nEverything you know about a Vega, you know about an Astre. It was offered from ’73 to ’77 and came in the same Vega body styles with the only notable differences being the grille and taillights. On measurable Vega departure was the inclusion of Pontiac’s 2.5 liter “Iron Duke” (“new sizzle” according to Pontiac’s sales brochure) as an alternate Astre powerplant for 1977.\n\nBut forget all of that, as this Astre is LS-powered! Now GM’s “LS” series of engines cover a wide variety and which one this car possesses is not disclosed. It could be a hindside kicker 6.2 or a mild 4.8, or something in between. Regardless, it’s a huge improvement over lump A or lump B with which this car was originally straddled. A 4L60 automatic transmission, and “all the components to support it” backs up the small block. We’re told that it has an “Ultimate EFI” system and a fuel cell and it, “Runs and drives fine but will need more driving tuning time. It is (a) pretty quick light car“. The engine room is certainly impressive looking!\n\nThe car has a series sleeper vibe about it, it looks like a forlorn stocker that has been sitting out on the street for a long time. The finish is faded and nicked, and the paint is peeling but there is no sign of crash damage or rot – and it’s still wearing its simple, argent finished steel wheels. The most distinctive trait of an Astre, separating it from a Vega, is the trademark split Pontiac grille but in this case, the grill pieces are missing – I wonder how difficult it would be to source replacements?\n\nThe interior is a surprise, at least what can be seen of it, as the seating upholstery looks pretty good, and in keeping with the racecar vibe, the rear seat has been removed (dead weight on the dragstrip, right?) and has been carpeted over. Unfortunately, there is no image of the instrument panel, I would be curious to see what, if anything there has been modified; standard Astre dashboards were no great shakes.\n\nThis Pontiac is definitely an odd one, it’s the first of this nature that I have stumbled upon, and I like it! Imagine how much fun you could have with this innocuous-looking compact leaving some typical high-dollar muscle car in the dust. Hubba, Hubba, right?"
