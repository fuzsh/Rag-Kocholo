        "text": "Advertisement 1\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nDuring his tenure as General Motors’ Vice President of Styling, Bill Mitchell built a reputation as a sports- and muscle-car enthusiast. The man oversaw the design of the second- and third-generation Corvettes – the former was directly inspired by Mitchell’s own 1959 Stingray race car – and when he retired in 1977, he asked the automaker to gift him just one car, his 1970 Pontiac Firebird-based “Pegasus” concept.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nDon't navigate the car buying road alone!\n\nJoin our thriving community on social media and connect with other car searchers and enthusiasts.\n\nArticle content\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\n1956X Buick Century ‘factory hot rod’ features 225 custom touches Back to video\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nBut there’s more to Mitchell than sporty cars and racy roadsters. Mitchell’s father was a Buick dealer in Pennsylvania, and it’s obvious GM’s premium marque made quite the impression on him from a young age. His fondness for the tri-shield brand would manifest most famously in his steering the development of the Buick Riviera, but it was perhaps earliest made apparent when, after being appointed GM Director of Styling in 1954, he made one of his first design concepts the 1956X Buick Century.\n\nThe 1956X – the ‘X’ is, of course, for “experimental” – is based on a production Buick Century convertible, but was treated to some 225 or so tweaks by GM stylists, making “special order 90022” something of a factory custom. Most of those modifications probably aren’t jumping out at you, and that’s in part because many of these subtle changes eventually made their way to mass-market General Motors vehicle lines — the 1956X Century just got ’em first.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAll 5 Photos for Gallery\n\nFunction Not Available\n\nFull Screen is not supported on this browser version.\n\nYou may use a different browser or device to view this in full screen.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWe’ll spare you running down all 225, but call your attention to, for example, the lower rocker panels. From the factory, they weren’t set off at all from the rest of the bodyside, but the ’56X sees them covered in a piece of stainless trim; the section under the door is ribbed, and, just ahead of the rear wheel, you’ll find an exhaust outlet poking through. If that sounds familiar, it’s ’cause a similar aesthetic wound up on later Corvettes, a half-decade-plus after debuting on this Buick.\n\nOpen the door and you’re greeted by a puddle light shining out from behind that trick rocker panel, a feature most consumers only started seeing splashed onto their driveways in the past 25 years. Tilt your chin up and you’ll find a cabin trimmed in metallic five-shades-of-blue upholstery, broken up by a pair of red stripes on the door cards. The steering wheel is wrapped with then-novel padding; and the gas and brake pedal see a chrome finish, a Bill Mitchell signature.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nCanada’s largest outdoor classic car show is like a time machine to the 1960s\n\nArt deco Cadillac collection kept in replica 1930s ballroom\n\nBut the highlight of the cockpit is the eight-way power swivel front seats, which pivot out to welcome you to the driver’s chair; or, in the case of the passenger, can rotate a full 180 degrees to chat face-to-face with the folks in the back. They’re capped off by a pair of power-telescoping headrests, as is the rear bench—if their going up and down via switch doesn’t impress you, we’ll remind you that no North-American-market car in 1956 had headrests at all, never mind power ones, and wouldn’t until roughly 1967.\n\nThere are another 200-odd features we can mention – among them Seminole-Red-painted inner fender liners, another Mitchell signature; and a unique Corvette-inspired intake manifold with four side-draft Carter YH carburetors, recreated from scratch by the car’s restorers – but we’ll let the 1956X Century’s owner, Steve Plunkett, run them down in our attached video, here.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nPlunkett is known as a Cadillac collector, but, like Mitchell with his sporty-car reputation, there’s more to the London, Ontario enthusiast than just pre-war V16s and ’60s luxo-barges. Just a decade ago, Plunkett would swear his 90-car collection would never shrink, but that changed some time in the past few years; he sold off almost two dozen vehicles and pivoted his focus to acquiring and preserving some of GM’s most important prototypes.\n\nHis ‘Fleetwood Auto Salon’ – modelled after the art-deco-style Waldorf-Astoria ballroom in New York, which played host to many GM ‘Motorama’ car shows through the 1950s – now houses such landmark General Motors cars as the 1941 limousine known as ‘The Duchess’; the 1949 prototype for the Cadillac Coupe de Ville; and the 1949 prototype Cadillac Fleetwood 60 Special. “I love cars with a history, and this is a well-storied car,” Plunkett says of the Mitchell ‘X’, which marks the 11th Buick in his collection, now numbering 82 cars.\n\nAdvertisement 8\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAll 6 Photos for Gallery\n\nFunction Not Available\n\nFull Screen is not supported on this browser version.\n\nYou may use a different browser or device to view this in full screen.\n\nAdvertisement 9\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nUnlike its prototype Cadillac stablemates, the 1956X Buick was not a Motorama show car, and it’s thought Mitchell raced it more than he ever displayed it in public. Plunkett’s aiming to take the opposite tact, and put as many eyeballs as possible on this ahead-of-its-time car and its 225 features.\n\nAfter picking up the car fresh off an eight-year restoration by its prior owner – they’d met through Plunkett’s annual Fleetwood Country Cruize-In, which was one of Canada’s largest classic-car shows, before it was shuttered in 2019 – Plunkett gave the Buick a debut at the Amelia Island Concours d’Elegance, in March 2020.\n\nWhen the Cobble Beach Concours d’Elegance spotlighted “120 Years of Buick” in September 2023, it graced the lawn, there, too. It was most recently shown at the 2024 Arizona Concours d’Elegance in January, and don’t expect that to be the end of its tour, either; Plunkett says when it comes to the 1956X Buick Century, “we’re going to show it as much as we can.”\n\nSign up for our newsletter Blind-Spot Monitor and follow our social channels on X, Tiktok and LinkedIn to stay up to date on the latest automotive news, reviews, car culture, and vehicle shopping advice.\n\nMore in Vintage & Collectible\n\nWhat was the 1980s' worst year for cars?\n\nRearview Mirror: Looking back on a century of Chrysler's most iconic cars\n\nThis San Fran art university owns 150 rare classic cars—here’s why it’s selling them off\n\nWedge Play: Why the door-stop design trend was spotlighted at the 2024 Pebble Beach Concours\n\nThe weathered survivor cars of the 2024 Pebble Beach Concours\n\nSee more\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nNicholas Maronese\n\nNicholas has been part of the Driving.ca team since 2018, and writes specifically about classic cars – like his first and currently only car, his 1971 Plymouth Valiant Scamp – whenever possible, though he also enjoys exploring vehicular history, automotive design, and car culture.
