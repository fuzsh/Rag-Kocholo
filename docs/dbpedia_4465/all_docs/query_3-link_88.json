Beside him was a Ford Thunderbird driven by a young designer GM had recently hired and who had quickly made a name for himself with interesting ideas for the 1959 Pontiac and Chevrolet models.\n\nMitchell admired the work of the young designer, but was not pleased that he had had the temerity to drive a Ford car onto the GM campus, so he decided to show the kid a little GM muscle. He revved the engine in his bright red supercharged Pontiac and shot off as soon as the light turned.\n\nBig mistake."
