After one year, he attended the Art Student's League in New York City while working for the Barron Collier Advertising Agency. The Collier family encouraged him to sketch and design automobiles, especially racers. In 1935, Mitchell was hired by General Motors as a designer. In 1959, when Harley Earl retired, Mitchell was named head of the Styling Section. He is best known for the 1938 Cadillac Sixty Special, the 1963 Buick Riviera, the 1963 Chevrolet Corvette, the 1967 Cadillac Eldorado and the 1977 Chevrolet Impala. After retiring from General Motors in 1977, Mitchell organized his own design company.
