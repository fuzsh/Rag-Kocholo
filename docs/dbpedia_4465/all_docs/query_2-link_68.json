        "text": "Ringo\n\nDoes anybody remember the '75 Pontiac Astre? Does anyboy have one here?\n\nHudson\n\nThere's a reason why the Astre has been \"forgotten.\" Pontiac's Vega featured Pontiac's trademark split grille and slotted taillights and the Chevrolet subcompact's quality. The Astre was facelifted and renamed Sunbird, which lasted until it was replaced by the FWD J-body J2000.\n\nScott 02\n\nI have never heard of one of those pontiacs before. Be interesting to get some information on them though.\n\nRingo\n\nThe only thing I know is that it came with a 2.5 liter 4cylinder engine, two barrel Holley carburetor with catalitic converters in 76, and automatic transmission. The styling reminded me of a mini Camaro of the same year, and the handling also felt the same through the steering wheel, it had a cool creamy white interior that lasted to the very end. My friend had it for 20 years until the engine block cracked. This car has much potential to be turned into a great \"sleeper\". There is plenty of room under the hood to fit a much larger motor, and it is sleek.\n\nScott 02\n\nI'll look some information up on it. Do you know how many were produced in 75 Ringo?\n\nRingo\n\nHonestly I have only seen one Astre my whole life Scott. Everyone I talk to has never heard of one. The only thing I could find was a recall website, this model only had 32 recalls. I wonder if their rarity could make them valuable. Lets see what else I find...\n\nHudson\n\nDon't bet on any value to an Astre. Like I said before, they're nothing more than a Pontiac-ized Vega. I remember they weren't rare when they were new...I'd have to look it up to see exactly how many they sold. You don't see many Vegas today either...which doesn't help their value.\n\nMisundaztood\n\nI'd roll in that.:coolguy:\n\nSuPeRcAr_MaN\n\nOriginally posted by Misundaztood\n\nI'd roll in that.:coolguy:\n\nI wouldn't :bloated:\n\nbowtiebandit\n\nNow a Cosworth Vega might be a different story.................\n\nShortbus\n\nOriginally posted by bowtiebandit\n\nNow a Cosworth Vega might be a different story.................\n\nFor those of you scratching your heads...\n\nIn 1970, Chevrolet engineers began working closely with a now famous engine development company in England, Cosworth Engineering Ltd., to design a new European Formula 2 engine based on GM's innovative aluminum silicon alloy four cylinder block.\n\nIn 1971, when it was apparent that the four valve per cylinder head design was a viable product, word was given by the then General Manager of Chevrolet, Mr. John Z. Delorean, to develop a Vega \"image\" model. This new model would utilize a detuned version of the engine as well as other high performance/sport options such as 3.73 posi-traction rear axle, aluminum sport wheels, and full instrumentation.\n\nIn later press releases Chevrolet would state; \"The Cosworth Vega is a highly sophisticated sports concept designed to generate excitement and bolster interest in the GM domestic small car market\" It also added \"another marketing objective is to establish the design superiority and engineering excellence of (this) Vega option in the minds of knowledgeable enthusiasts\".\n\nChevrolet, after a three year development program and a one year delay associated with a failure to achieve EPA certification in 1974, began building the first of approximately 2,061 1975 1/2 Cosworth Twin Cam Vegas (RPO Z09) in March, 1975.\n\nThe unique engines were hand assembled in a special area at the Tonawanda Engine Plant in New York, tested, and shipped to the Lordstown, Ohio vehicle assembly facility were Vegas were being built at rates approaching 100 units per hour.\n\nThe Cosworths were assembled on the same line as other Vegas. All 1975 Cosworths were black with gold striping and gold painted aluminum wheels, each of the vehicles carried a serial numbered plaque on a gold tinted engine turned dash bezel. The 1975 Cosworth model also utilized the new Monza torque arm rear suspension (not used on the standard Vega till 1976), special tachometer, and exclusive transmission and final drive gear ratios. The interior was the same as the GT model custom interior.\n\nIn 1976, a five speed transmission with a 4.10 final drive ratio was added to the option list. A mid model year revision (January 1976) added a sunroof, 8 track tape, and eight additional colors to the option list.\n\nUnfortunately, even these changes did not help the sagging sales of the Cosworth Vega and 1976 production ended in July, 1976 with approximately 1446 produced.\n\nWhy didn't the Cosworth sell? Most knowledgeable people feel it was a combination of many factors; high unit costs, (over $6000 dollars in 1976, nearly the cost of a new Corvette!) less than expected performance, and a general disinterest in the Vega due to it's previous bad reputation which by 1975 was greatly undeserved.\n\nNow, most surviving Cosworths are owned by people who understand how unique an automobile it was. The Cosworth Vega included many firsts: the first double overhead cam sixteen valve engine to be domestically produced and sold by General Motors; the first use of electronic fuel injection by Chevrolet; the first use of a factory installed stainless steel exhaust header; the first use of pressure cast aluminum road wheels.\n\nAs many of you know, these items are commonplace on today's vehicles! It was these firsts that led Car & Driver magazine to name the Cosworth Twin Cam Vega one of worlds ten best collector cars built since 1974 in their January, 1986 issue. The well respected magazine Automobile Quarterly completed a significant color photograph story on the Cosworth Vega in Volume 27-3 issued in September 1989. It appears that this milestone car is finally getting the respect it rightfully deserves.\n\nScott 02\n\npicture\n\nI found this station wagon picture on the net....\n\nkaoru-tochiro\n\nThose cars are so dangerous, my sister had one as a first car,$100, sold it in 6 months. It can't eve do 50 mph because the rear end floats in the air and it fishtails easilly, tractor style handling didn't give much of a warnig you were about to spin. Pretty much the same abomination as the Corvairs.:mad:\n\nHudson\n\nThe Corvair didn't have a problem with the rear end floating and the Astre has nothing in common with the Corvair (from parts to problems).\n\nkaoru-tochiro\n\nUnsafe at any speed-\n\nThe fact is, no matter how much we try to deny it, there was a definite problem with the 1960-1963 Corvair. And that problem, a weakness in the rear suspension, as the original designs for the Corvair in fact took this into account. The problem was clearly that marketing and cost-cutting won out over intelligent engineering. The designers that planned the Corvair knew that anti-sway bars would be needed to support the added weight of the rear-mounted engine. But to save a measly $4 per car, those bars were not included in the final product, and the inevitable disaster struck.\n\nPretty much the same abomination as the Astres.:mad: (I'm talkin roadmanners not parts)\n\nHudson\n\nOriginally posted by kaoru-tochiro\n\n...Pretty much the same abomination as the Astres.:mad: (I'm talkin roadmanners not parts)\n\nAgain, no. The problem with the Corvair wasn't a light (or floating) rear suspension. The problem was when the rear end got light (hard cornering, for example), the independent suspension tended to fold. The Astre was a light front-engined/rear-wheel drive car and would probably have been quite light in the rear end. These are two completely different problems, in roadmanners or in effect.\n\nBlue02R6\n\nYup the Corvair used a swing axle(well transaxle) which tends to tuck the outside wheel under the car. There was a Benz (one of the 60s SLs) that used the same set-up. I believe it had the same handling problems but not as bad due to the lighter rearend. Oh please don't quote Nader, he said that CJ-5s were dangerous because you couldn't take a right hand corner at 25-35 mph. Thats not unsafe, your just a idiot if you fly around corners in a truck.\n\nRingo\n\nThe Astre was not as bad as a Corvair!:mad:\n\nSexy beast\n\nThe Astre was one of the best sporstcars of all time, it never got the recognition it deserved.\n\nMisundaztood\n\nTrue dat! The Aspire got the same treatment...\n\ntrouble66002\n\nRecently bought a 1982 Pontiac J2000 (Mary Kay) car. It's not in too bad shape needs motor work can't find vacuum leak. Stalls when take out of park.\n\nAdd your comment to this topic!\n\nAutomotive Network, Inc., Copyright Â©2024"
