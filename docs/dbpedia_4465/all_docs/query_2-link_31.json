        "text": "Most American cars of the 1970s were underpowered, unfortunate-looking four-wheeled lumps of disappointment, but this 1975 Pontiac Astre has one, maybe two redeeming qualities. It’s currently listed on Bring A Trailer for auction, and despite hiding a little 140 cubic-inch inline four cylinder that produced a paltry Pontiac-claimed 87 horsepower when new, this little hatchback has go-faster stickers on the side so that’s got to add at least 20 horsepower. This example’s three-speed automatic transmission further relegates it to the economy car doldrums rather than the hot hatchback fun zone.\n\nAside from the anemic engine and three-speed slushbox transmission, this Astre is fitted with the “Li’l Wide Track” equipment package that includes those oh-so-seventies graphics on the side, a rear spoiler with its own graphics, and a front air dam, though this example is missing the quarter-window louvers. The graphic on the hood even has the words, “Li’l Wide Track” proudly on display. The Bring A Trailer ad claims that approximately 3,000 Pontiac Astres were built with the Li’l Wide Track equipment package, and considering that I’ve never seen or heard of the Pontiac Astre let alone the Li’l Wide Track package, whomever buys this li’l looker will have one rare car on their hands.\n\nAs far as performance goes, this li’l Pontiac is not going to blow anyone away. It sits on 13-inch cast aluminum cross-laced alloys that are laughably small, and despite its 120-mph speedometer, its two-digit power numbers ain’t gonna scare anybody. It does come with Pontiac Historic Services documents and the current owner replaced the belts and hoses, and the engine was re-sealed about two years ago so it should run well.\n\nThis Pontiac has an adorable interior with l’il bucket seats up front and some snazzy looking wood inserts to liven up the dash. This particular Astre Li’l Wide Track indicates 64,000 miles on the odometer which is quite low for a 50-year-old car. Unfortunately the audience for an automotive misfit like this is pretty small, so even if the buyer gets it for a great price it’s not likely to appreciate very much. Its rarity should help keep this li’l cutie’s value higher than most Chevrolet Vegas and Pontiac Astres though, so any quirky car collectors looking for something adorable, check out this L’il Wide Track."
