        "text": "“Oh, he was powerful. God, I admired [him]. He just knocked the tar out of anybody. He’d get it fixed. If he couldn’t, he’d call New York and say, ‘Fix these…[.]’ Then, I inherited some of that.\n\nI believe this, and I still do: I think what’s wrong with the G.M. [products], the new ones I see coming out, it’s hard to tailor a dwarf, so you’re going to have these cars that aren’t exotic. But, there should be style leaders. There should be prestige cars, like the Eldorados, Toronados, Rivieras — there’s not gonna be — the new ones are vanilla. I didn’t go to the proving ground [last] Monday because I didn’t want to blow my top, and I’d seen them, and I said, ‘I’m busy. I can’t go.’ It’s not my way of life.\n\nNow, a good friend of Earl’s and Sloan’s, I don’t know whether you know him or not, he’s Fred Cody. I was at a party a couple of weeks ago over here, and Murphy was there, and all the G.M. people, and he turned to a group we were talking to and said, ‘Now, Harley Earl turned this all over to you, didn’t he?’ I said, ‘Yeah.’ ‘Who did you turn it over to? Who is he?’ Irv [Rybicki] has been in seven years, and nobody knows him. He won’t speak up, and they’re just taking it away from him. You’ve got to fight for what you want.\n\nI had a general manager once that wanted to put, I won’t name him, but he wanted to put a grille in the Toronado, and I wanted it like a Cord, you know. I said, ‘Look, I don’t tell you how to make your car, or run your plant, [but] keep your damn nose out of design. I’m helping you. You don’t go to your tailor and tell him how to make your suit.’ I said, ‘You have no business in design.’ I said, ‘That suit you’ve got on, my wife’s got better linoleum on our kitchen floor than that God damn suit you’re wearing.’ Right in front of his whole people.”"
