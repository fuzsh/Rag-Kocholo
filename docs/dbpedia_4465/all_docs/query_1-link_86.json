        "text": "Every Sunday in the Driving Section, The Plain Dealer features a My First Car story from one of our readers.\n\nMy first car was an Astre, Pontiac's less-than-eloquent answer to the modest Ford Pinto.\n\nIt was a 1975, with a manual transmission. The color was orange, factory paint almost too ugly not to be custom.\n\nI drove that car to Texas, Arizona, Maine, New York and other locales. I ate in it, slept it in it and suffered in it.\n\nIt was not what you'd call a luxury car, but it was transportation. It was slow and the seats seemed engineered to produce back spasms.\n\nThen there was the clutch. I kept blowing it. After a while, it would stick to the floor when you tried to let it out. It got so bad that to lift it I had to get the toe of my right foot under the pedal and peel it off the floorboard. At the same time I had to keep my left foot on top of the pedal to keep the car from stalling or hopping away at stoplights.\n\nThe remedy I finally came up with was to tie a long rope around the clutch pedal and hold it in my left hand like the reins to a buggy. Then all I had to do was tug on it and it came right up.\n\nOne day my Astre was towed for a parking violation. When I got to the impound lot to pick it up, I was an instant celebrity. \"Hey, look!\" the receptionist yelled to anyone within earshot. \"This is the guy with the rope!\"\n\n-- Ron Friedman, Pepper Pike\n\nTo read more My First Car stories or submit your own (300 words or less, plus photo) go to cleveland.com/autoshow."
