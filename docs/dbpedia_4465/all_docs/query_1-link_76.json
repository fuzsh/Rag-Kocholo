        "text": "The Pontiac Astre was a subcompact class car that was offered by Pontiac as a badge-engineered model of the Chevy Vega. Originally offered only in Canada for model years 1973-1974, the Astre was brought to the U.S. during 1975 as a concurrent to the other foreign and domestic subcompacts alike to the Toyota Corolla and Mercury Bobcat. The Astre was sharing the aluminum 2.3L I4 engine with the Chevy Vega until 1976, while its last 1977 models were built with Pontiac's iron 2.5L I4 engines. The production run of the Astre was ended together with the Vega during 1977, the wagon version was still manufactured for 1978 and 1979, as one of the Pontiac Sunbird line models.\n\nWe spend a considerable amount of time in our cars.
