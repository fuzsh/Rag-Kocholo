        "text": "Come hell or high water.\n\nDefying the naysaying voices from High School, my decision to attend college was never in question, apart from the choice of University. Weighing my options, I elected to attend Michigan State University and pursue a curriculum in Industrial Design / Product Design, thinking that would forge a pathway to automotive design. Our studies included a gamut of products — almost everything apart from automobiles. I was still searching for that magical bullet that would direct me to the car design profession, which proved a misguided assumption. Graduating after four years with my portfolio in hand, I assumed I was ready for the big leagues as a professional car designer. Needless to say it didn’t work out the way I had envisioned.\n\nArmed with my product resume, I set my sights upon General Motors Design and was scheduled for an interview. The campus of the General Motors Tech Center was an Eero Saarinen architectural tour-de-force with a rather large man-made lake in the centre surrounded by Engineering, Manufacturing, Research and Design Buildings. Patiently waiting for the interviewer to arrive, I was awestruck by the grandeur and imposing facilities that housed the world’s most talented design staff. With that, a gentleman entered the room and said, “John, do you see that lake out there?”, to which I sprung up and looked out over the expanse of water and nodded in the affirmative. He continued, “Unless you can Continue reading “Never a Dull Moment — Part 2”\n\nBill Mitchell’s other forms of transport\n\nGifted automotive designer, taskmaster, motorcyclist — Bill Mitchell was many things. Some people found him impossible to work with (never mind for), but those he did allow closer often found him a benevolent soul who, with all that corporate clout, would encourage those select artisans to work for him, after hours.\n\nGM Vice President of Design by day, surrounded by Corvettes, Silver Rivieras and the like, Mitchell’s downtime was often spent astride two wheels. Motorcycle devotees should Continue reading “Balm and Nourishment”\n\nBoaty McBoat Tail\n\nAn almost mythical aura surrounds the second of the Silver Arrow concepts, which is more than can be said of the car itself – now vanished without trace. Hype and overall interest for 1967 was considerably lower when compared to the first Silver Arrow; no chassis number, no documented dates, no confirmed photos, zilch.\n\nAfter extensive research with limited resources[1], Silver Arrow II appears to have barely differed from a 1970 model year Riviera – the grille perhaps receiving the most noticeable change – 74 teeth opposed to only 60. The side chromed spear overlaid onto bodywork. An interior again in silver leather. Other small details differing from that of later production models include side view mirrors, the hub caps (not seen on any other Riviera) and the rear side reflectors. What is known as the Rocker Moulding[2], was also chromed. Continue reading “Silver Car For Mr Mitchell (Part Two)”\n\nSilver Arrows from Flint, Michigan.\n\nIn the realms of car design, chances must be taken. Regardless of the ever-building pressure generated from all quarters as to the next sure-fire sales wonder, calculated risk taking is part of the game. Such incontrovertible weights require shoulders of strength, astute vision, alongside the ego of a vain, mirror-devoted individual, obsessed with appearances. Praise be that a certain William Mitchell was in possession of all of the above qualities, along with a marked penchant for items of an argentine nature.\n\nIt seems as natural today as it did sixty years ago that prior to the October 4th 1962 Riviera reveal, Mitchell would wish to Continue reading “Silver Car For Mr. Mitchell (Part One)”\n\nWhere magic happened.\n\nPhilibert Le Roy is credited with turning a backwater shooting lodge into a chateau fit for a king. Then, through a succession of architects along with an army of builders, the Sun King’s dream of the most opulent palace was made real. From small beginnings to a lavish labyrinth, the Palace of Versailles has borne witness to history.\n\nMetaphorically and literally distanced from such overt flourishes lies an altogether different theatre of dreams. A place that too has borne change, seen careers grow to unprecedented heights, scarred many by its inner machinations and created millions of objects idolised the world over. Enter architect, Eero Saarinen (1910-61), creative inspiration for the somewhat bland sounding 1956 GM Technical Center in Warren, Michigan.\n\nWhereas Louis’ gaff had (amongst others) Salons to Abundance, Mars and Apollo (with a few added mirrors for good measure) the the GMTC had to Continue reading “The Palace Of Versailles, Michigan”\n\nYesterday’s tomorrows – from the studios of Bill Mitchell.\n\nSometimes it is necessary to go wildly overboard before one finds the precise quantum of sufficiency. Somewhat akin to party-going children having run amok; gorging on fizzy pop and cream buns, the American motor industry exited the 1950s with a decidedly queasy sense of untempered excess. A new decade would precipitate a fresh creative approach, and a wholesale shift from the baroque flights of jet-age fancy to a more sober, less mannered visual sensibility.\n\nThe 1960s would go on to Continue reading “Under the Knife – That Riviera Touch”\n\nToday, we’re pleased to introduce DTW reader, Bruno Vijverman, who poses a question which has been bothering him of late.\n\nBill Mitchell considered the 1965 GM cars to be his best work. And he may very well have been correct: The already beautiful Buick Riviera’s styling was cleaned up with the hidden headlights it was always supposed to have, the Chevrolet Corvair was restyled in a faintly Italianate fashion, while the regular Chevrolets had a more dynamic and flowing look if compared to the somewhat boxy 1964 models.\n\nThe same could be said of the other full-size offerings from Oldsmobile, Buick and especially Pontiac. The GM flagship Cadillac was of course also fully restyled for 1965, and is generally regarded as a handsome, and in view of the era and fashion, relatively uncluttered and cleanly styled car.\n\nI also like the 1965 Cadillac. Apart from one thing: the weird trajectory of the shutline between the front and the rear door on the four-door models. Since this caught my eye I cannot Continue reading “Unsightly Shutline Syndrome”\n\nThere might even be one of these cars in the United Kingdom. A GM concessionaire in Manchester provided this brochure by post one day in 1998.\n\nAfter this iteration, Buick gave up on the personal two-door coupe in 1999, ending a line that had existed since 1963. It began with Bill Mitchell’s hallowed car that supposedly blended the power of a Ferrari with the presence of a Bentley.\n\nAfter the first version only the 1971 “Boat-tail” which lasted a mere three years, had any further claim to fame. My entrée to the car is the re-styled seventh series which Bill Porter transformed from a car resembling a Buick Somerset Regal but costing much more, into something deserving of the name.
