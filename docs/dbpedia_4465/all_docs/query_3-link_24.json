        "text": "William L. \"Bill\" Mitchell (July 2, 1912 — September 12, 1988) was an important General Motors designer from the late 1930s to the late 1970s. He succeeded Harley Earl as Vice President for Styling in the late 1950s. He was particularly identified with the Chevrolet Corvette and the Buick Riviera.\n\nEarly Career[]\n\nMitchell's father owned a Buick dealership when he was a kid, and was in awe at some of the Stutzs and Mercers that his father brought home as trade-ins. He started engineering studies at Carnegie Tech, but during his summers he attended the Art Students League and worked at Barron Collier Advertising Agency. While at Collier a friend of Mitchell's suggested that he show some of his automobile drawings to Harley Earl, then head of General Motors Art and Colour Section. In 1935, he became an employee working under Harley Earl. At the age of 24, he was promoted to the head of styling for Cadillac.\n\nVice President for Styling[]\n\nAfter Harley Earl retired in 1958, Mitchell was ready to step into his shoes as Vice President for Styling. Mitchell felt that cars needed to look fast sitting still, and many General Motors cars made after he became Vice President reflect the motion in design that he was fond of. In 1977, Mitchell retired from his design post and often didn't like the design of later cars becaues they didn't have the same drama that he had been making his entire career.\n\nPrinciple Designs[]\n\n1938 Cadillac 60 Special\n\n1959 Mitchell Stingray\n\n1959 Cadillac Eldorado\n\n1960 Corvette concept\n\n1962 Mako Shark (concept)\n\n1963 Chevrolet Corvette\n\n1963 Buick Riviera\n\n1967 Cadillac Eldorado\n\n1970 Chevrolet Camaro\n\n1975 Cadillac Seville\n\nReferences[]"
