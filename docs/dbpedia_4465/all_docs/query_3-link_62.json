        "text": "In 1970, Road America hosted its very first Trans-Am SCCA race. The double-header featured two Continental Championship races on Saturday. The first was 20 laps (80 miles) for Formula B/C cars, followed by Formula A cars in a 25 lap (100 mile) race.\n\nOn Sunday, there were two Trans-Am sedan races. The first was for Under-2-Litre class sedans and the other for \"Over-2-Litre\" cars, which typically included Mustang, Challenger, Camaro and Firebird sport sedans. The race was won by Mark Donohue #6 driving a Sunoco sponsored Javelin for Roger Penske Racing. Second position went to Swede Savage, and Sam Posey finished third despite spinning twice.\n\nOn the previous day, early Saturday afternoon, there was a bad wreck halfway through a 1-hour long qualifying for Trans-Am, Over-2-Litre. Apparently, there was an announcement suddenly made over loudspeaker, \"Ladies and gentlemen, there has been a serious accident on the course...\" The announcer repeated several times, \"There's been an accident at Turn 13.\" The crash involved one of racing's whole-hearted best, Jerry Titus, SCCA championship driver and automotive journalist.\n\nTitus was approaching a slower car at a tricky uphill left between turns 12 and 13, in the stretch known as Thunder Valley. It is said; one ordinarily doesn't have to use brakes there. But, Titus apparently braked hard because his wheels locked up while entering turn 13. Unable to steer at that point, his Firebird skidded headlong into the concrete abutment at Mitchell Bridge. Located halfway through Turn 13, his car hit at the outer corner of the bridge's concrete stem and wing walls. The smoldering wreck caught fire, but was immediately extinguished by well-trained corner workers. Titus sustained injuries to head and arm but was revived by the track doctor who quickly arrived. Minutes afterward, he was whisked away by ambulance crew enroute to a Milwaukee hospital. After two weeks of critical care and some progress, doctors had expressed real hope of an eventual recovery, but Titus passed away shortly after.\n\nFrom the beginning and into the 1970s, sports car road racing was a high-risk business for many drivers as well as some spectators and workers. The sport has seen great improvements and has become very safety conscious, perhaps fanatical to some. There is definitely an attitude of safety first. Road racing circuits are statically safer than driving on public roads, which is where this whole thing began."
