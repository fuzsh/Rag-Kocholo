        "text": "Not too shabby, but it must be murder getting body parts for these things. Even back in the '80s, the pull-your-part yards had signs- \"No Vegas or Mazdas\". I think it was one particular model of Mazda. One of my sisters had a Monza coupe with 305 from the factory, bought new. That thing would really move out. The other size V8 was the 262, as has been mentioned. Even the V6 cars went pretty well. Back in the '80s I used to buy fix and flip Vegas. Good times (=good money).\n\nOh come on now they never came with a 305! Cause the factory lit said so!\n\nLOL I got told this on here when I know damn well a friend had a 305 factory Monza wagon!\n\nThat was me, most probably.....\n\nAll I know is what the brochures say........\n\nThe Vega wagon became the Monza wagon in '78, continued for '79 as well. The Monza was still around for the '80 model year, but the wagon version was killed. Chevy wagon brochures show various versions of the 151 cu in. 4 cylinder, 196 cu in (3.2L) V6 and 231 cu in. (3.8) V6 being available.\n\nThe Monza hatch and formal coupe models were built on a modified Vega platform, while the wagon was (obviously) not a modified platform, You could get the V8's in the hatch and coupe models. I wonder if the wagons were not assembled in the same place? Could that be one reason why the V8 wasn't offered in them?\n\nPages from '78 and '79 Chevy wagon brochures:\n\nhttp://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/chevy/78cv9.html\n\nhttp://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/chevy/79cv10.html"
