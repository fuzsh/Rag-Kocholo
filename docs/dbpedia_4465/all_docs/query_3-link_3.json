        "text": "Authenticity: My celebration of Bill Mitchell\n\nBill Mitchell was the most authentic man I ever met. The secret to his success was that his focus never changed, his design vision was laser clear, and he always communicated what he thought. He demanded excellence. He championed innovation. He encouraged good work. He charged young designers with complete responsibility to design a car. He delegated responsibility, but never abdicated his own. You always knew where you stood with Mitchell, because he would tell you.\n\nThe inside truth has not been written, until now. During the almost fifty years since I worked for him up close and personal during the 1960s in his famous Studio-X, Warehouse Studio, and Chevy-2 studios, I have been amazed that the real story of the man has not been told. For the last three years, I have made it my mission to seek out the facts, tell the unvarnished truth, and to celebrate Bill Mitchell as the man, corporate design manager, a skilled leader of creative types, and perhaps the greatest American automobile designer.\n\nMy passion for writing the book is to tell the story of my interaction with Mitchell (and my part in designing a number of cars for him), in my own words (as if I were directly talking with you over a dinner table). I have tried my best to achieve the highest design quality to portray the designer illustrations. I have also endeavored to design the book in the Swiss Style of graphic design which characterized the Mitchell Era during the 1960s. My objective was to design the definitive book about Bill Mitchell and GM Styling that would appeal to a handful of automobile enthusiasts, designers, students, and historians. It is an important story that needs to be told."
