This is a 1973 issue Pontiac Astre brochure for Canada. I have never ever seen an astre with this grill and tail lights, I assume they were built. When I did a web search for 1973 Astre, not one image comes up. My folks bought a new 1975 Astre in Kansas when I was a kid, so I like them and pay close attention to them.\"\n\nClick on a thumbnail image to view the brochure.
