        "text": "Cavaliers legend Austin Carr shed tears of joy, and Gordon Gund posed for photographs with the jersey the longtime owner had worried could spoil his team's chances of hitting the LeBron James jackpot.\n\nThe 20-year anniversary of the Cavs winning the James sweepstakes in the NBA Draft Lottery has arrived, evoking memories a monumental day in Cleveland sports history.\n\n“It was a very emotional time for me 'cause I knew if we got the No. 1 pick, I knew fortunes were about to change,” former Cavs player and longtime team broadcaster Carr told the Beacon Journal in a recent phone interview.\n\nOn May 22, 2003, the Cavs prevailed in the lottery and thereby gained the right to draft James first overall. At the time, James was on the cusp of graduating from St. Vincent-St. Mary High School.\n\nLooking back at LeBron James at STVM: Mom Gloria, former coaches and teammates reflect on a legendary high school career\n\nThere was no suspense atop the June 26 draft because Cavs brass had stated the obvious while celebrating its lottery victory — Cleveland would use the top pick on the kid from Akron.\n\n“For lots of reasons, we knew [James] was terrific. I used to say, 'I think if we hadn't drafted him once we had the lottery pick, I think we would've been hung in effigy,'” Gund, majority owner of the Cavs from 1983-2005, said with a laugh earlier this month.\n\nJames not only represented a no-brainer of a draft decision from a basketball standpoint, but he also possessed the appeal of a hometown hero in Northeast Ohio.\n\nJubilant Cleveland fans partied into the night when the lottery went their way.\n\nThe No. 1 overall pick of the Cavs in 1971, Carr joined in the revelry at a Champps restaurant in Valley View, where the franchise hosted a lottery viewing party for its loyal followers. TV cameras captured Carr's reaction to the news James would become the face of the Cavs.\n\n“I started crying when we got the pick because I just knew what it meant to our franchise,” Carr said.\n\nLeBron's latest movie has Akron flavor: Loyalty to hometown and former St. Vincent-St. Mary teammates evident in 'Shooting Stars' premiere\n\nMore on the 'Shooting Stars' movie: LeBron James brings Hollywood to Akron again with special premiere\n\nAs former NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik opened envelopes and read the lottery results, Gund was among 12 team representatives on stage at NBA Entertainment Studios in Secaucus, New Jersey. Moments after the world learned James would be staying home to begin his professional career, Gund could hardly stop grinning while Mike Tirico interviewed him for ABC's telecast. Gund even started the exchange by joking the Cavs didn't know who they would draft.\n\n“I couldn't help but have fun with it,” Gund said.\n\nAbout a month before the lottery, the Cavs had unveiled a new logo and wine and gold uniforms. But what wasn't public knowledge is the team had a No. 23 James jersey made, and its former head of communications, Tad Carper, took the uniform to the lottery in a briefcase.\n\n“I was nervous when he said he wanted to bring it,” Gund said. “I said, 'Well, don't even let me know you've got it. I don't want to jinx this thing.'”\n\nWhat could have been for Akron Buchtel: Griffins legends ponder LeBron James halting state title drought if not for switch to STVM\n\nHow the Cavs won the NBA Draft Lottery and the right to pick LeBron James first overall in 2003\n\nAt long last, the wrath of a Cleveland sports curse didn't come to pass. There were reasons for Gund to be anxious, though.\n\nIn the previous 12 lotteries, the team with the best odds didn't claim the top pick.\n\nOf the 13 non-playoff teams in 2003, the Cavs and Denver Nuggets were tied with the greatest chances to win the lottery — at 22.5% apiece.\n\nAkron Public Schools honor LeBron James: Why NBA superstar will be inducted into the APS Athletics Hall of Fame, even though he didn't attend an APS high school\n\nThe Cavs and Nuggets finished in the basement of the league standings with records of 17-65. The Cavs would have owned sole possession of the worst record and the best odds of securing the No. 1 overall pick — a 25% chance — if they had lost their season finale to the Toronto Raptors. However, the Cavs beat the Raptors 96-86 at home on April 16, 2003. Later the same night, the Nuggets fell 89-84 to the visiting Houston Rockets, resulting in the tie between Cleveland and Denver.\n\n“There were people who said, 'Well, we ought to tank this,'” Gund said of the finale. “And I said, 'No, you can't do that. If you go down that road one time, it'll always be with you. If you start doing business like that, then when does it end? I said, 'No, we've got to play that last game to win,' and we did.”\n\nIn the end, the Cavs were rewarded for declining to lose their last game on purpose.\n\nFormer president of Gund Investment Corp. Warren Thaler represented the Cavs in the room where pingpong balls were drawn to determine the lottery results 90 minutes before the outcomes were unveiled on live TV.\n\n“He was not allowed out of the room, and he wasn't allowed to use his cellphone till after they had the lottery on TV,” Gund said of Thaler. “He was just dying to tell me, but he couldn't.”\n\nThe numbers 6, 2, 3, 12 were the winning combination, one of the 225 sets the Cavs had been given out of 1,001.\n\nWith a nod to childhood idol Michael Jordan, James wore No. 23 during his final three seasons at St. Vincent-St. Mary. File this under you can't make this up: The sum of 6, 2, 3, 12 is 23.\n\n“And they have 2 and 3 in the middle,” Gund noted.\n\nAs it turned out, the Cavs would not have received the winning combo if they had tanked their season finale and finished with a worse record than the Nuggets, Gund said Thaler told him.\n\n“They had the numbers on the wall that each team had been assigned,” Gund said. “[Thaler] could tell if we had not won that [last] game and it hadn't shifted around, the way the numbers that were up there were assigned, we wouldn't have gotten it.”\n\nAfter Granik revealed the first 10 lottery results, the Cavs, Nuggets and Memphis Grizzlies were the last three teams standing.\n\nThe Nuggets wound up with the No. 3 overall pick, which they would use on Carmelo Anthony.\n\nThe Grizzlies had a 6.4% chance to nab the top selection, but they landed in the second spot instead of receiving a minor miracle. A 1997 trade for power forward Otis Thorpe stipulated the Grizzlies were required to ship any pick other than the No. 1 overall choice to the Detroit Pistons. At No. 2, the Pistons would select Darko Milicic.\n\nHow LeBron James reacted to learning the Cavs would draft him No. 1 overall in 2003 during a lottery party in his hometown of Akron\n\nA night after James had agreed to an endorsement deal with Nike for seven years and worth more than $90 million, the 18-year-old star watched the lottery with family and friends at the former Radisson Hotel in downtown Akron.\n\nSurrounded by STVM teammates during a news conference, James acknowledged there were some groans among partygoers at the hotel when the Cavs triumphed in the lottery, but he declared, “I'm excited to be a Cavalier. … I hope I can put a lot of smiles back on the faces of the people of Cleveland.”\n\nCavs had playoff exit vs. Knicks: 'No sweeping changes': Franchise throws support behind core roster and coach J.B. Bickerstaff\n\nThe Cavs knew James well and vice versa. Gund said members of Cleveland's front office and coaching staff had been discussing James for a couple of years before he became eligible for the draft.\n\nFormer Cavs coach John Lucas gathered firsthand intel about how James would fare against NBA competition by allowing the teenage phenom to participate in a voluntary offseason workout.\n\nLooking back to 2003: Cavs get LeBron - Lottery keeps star near home\n\nOn May 22, 2002 — yes, the lottery occurred exactly one year later — James seized control of a scrimmage against some Cavs players at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse, which was then named Gund Arena.\n\nAsked if he had heard about James dominating the session, Gund said, “I heard. Yeah, I heard something pretty enthusiastic. Believe me.”\n\nBecause James was a high school junior and not eligible for the draft, NBA rules prohibited the league's teams from having contact with him. The NBA fined the Cavs $150,000 and suspended Lucas for the first two games of the 2002-03 season. The following January, the Cavs fired Lucas after an 8-34 start to the season. They hired the late Paul Silas in early June, between the lottery and draft.\n\nCarr began tracking James closely during his junior season at STVM and realized then he would be a special NBA player. Carr later became convinced James would be one of the sport's all-time greats during his rookie season.\n\n“He was unflappable,” Carr said. “He could do it all, and the one thing I was impressed with was his understanding of team ball, how to get the job done as a unit as opposed to individual. As good as he was as an individual, he looked at it more in a team concept way, and he still plays that way.”\n\nYears after LeBron James won a championship with the Cavs, he's still going strong with the Lakers\n\nWhen Carr cried during the lottery party, it wasn't because he immediately assumed the Cavs would capture their first NBA championship with James aboard.\n\n“Everybody wants that,” Carr said, “but as far as coming right out the chute thinking about that, I don't think I was in that mode at that moment.”\n\nLeBron James crowned NBA's scoring king: Akron native sets record with the support of Northeast Ohio basketball stars\n\nAlthough James didn't guarantee a title the night the Cavs had their envelope opened last, he eventually delivered them one, but, of course, only after taking his talents to the Miami Heat in 2010. He won two rings in four seasons with the Heat — all culminating in Finals appearances — and then returned to the Cavs.\n\n\"That's a sign of the times because he was right in the middle of the AAU rise, and that's how AAU ball is,\" Carr said of James bouncing around the NBA. \"I mean, these guys, they know each other from kindergarten. I didn't know anybody I played against unless I read about them in Street & Smith's magazine.”\n\nIn his second Cleveland tour, James took the Cavs to four consecutive Finals, too, and led the burial of a nearly 52-year title drought among major Cleveland pro sports teams. The Cavs rallied from a 3-1 deficit in their best-of-seven series against the Golden State Warriors and became NBA champions with a 93-89 victory in Game 7 on June 19, 2016, at Oracle Arena in Oakland, California.\n\n“As a native Clevelander, I was really, really excited about that 'cause I'd suffered with a lot of the other fans,” Gund said.\n\nAfter selling the Cavs to Dan Gilbert in 2005, Gund retained a 15% ownership stake until he sold his remaining shares to Gilbert in 2021. Gund maintained a presence at Cavs home games during the title run and was in the championship parade in downtown Cleveland, riding in a convertible with his two sons who described the scenes to their blind father.\n\n“People just piled up between where the car could go through and the buildings,” Gund said. “There was no room — none — and it was fabulous. There were people from every walk of life, and they were all just happy as could be.”\n\nCavs 2023 offseason: 'No roster is perfect': Better shooting at top of Cleveland's priorities\n\nNow 38 years old, James faces a 3-0 series deficit against the Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference Finals during his fifth season with the Los Angeles Lakers, with whom he won a championship in 2020 after leaving the Cavs for a second time in 2018.\n\nOn Feb. 7, James became the NBA's all-time leading scorer. On May 10, he was named to an All-NBA team for the 19th consecutive year, this time with a third-team selection.\n\nNothing about James' success, even at this late stage of his career, surprises Carr nowadays.\n\n“He takes care of himself. I've seen him take some falls and some spills, and he just shook them off and kept going,” Carr said. “That's because he prepares his body and his mind for what he has to do.\n\n“That's just the way he functions. He spends more on taking care of himself than anybody I've ever seen and probably anybody ever in the game. He understands that's where longevity comes from.”\n\nGund used the word “remarkable” to characterize the stellar performance of James 20 years after the Cavs first acquired him.\n\n“And he ain't done yet,” Gund added."
