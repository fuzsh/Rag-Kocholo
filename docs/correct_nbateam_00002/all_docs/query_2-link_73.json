        "text": "Basketball superstar LeBron James has opted out of the final season of his contract with the Los Angeles Lakers as he looks to secure a lucrative new deal.\n\nThe Lakers and James plan to work out a new three-year contract, with the 39-year-old eligible for a three-year, $US162 million ($A242 million) package.\n\nJames's agent - Rich Paul of Klutch Sports - said his client would consider taking less money if it meant the Lakers could gain a $US12.9 million mid-level exception to add a significant player.\n\n\"He is prioritising a roster improvement,\" Paul told ESPN.\n\n\"He's been adamant about exuding all efforts to improve the roster.\"\n\nJames would have received $US51.4 million for the 2024/25 season if he hadn't opted out by the deadline at close of business on Saturday.\n\nLos Angeles remain keen to ensure James finishes his legendary career with the franchise.\n\nThe Lakers selected LeBron's son Bronny James in the second round (55th overall) of Thursday's NBA draft.\n\nJames senior, who turns 40 in December, has expressed multiple times that he wants to play with his son before ending his career.\n\nA four-time MVP, James in March became the first player to top 40,000 career points.\n\nHe is a 20-time All-Star and has career averages of 27.1 points, 7.5 rebounds and 7.4 assists across 1492 regular-season games."
