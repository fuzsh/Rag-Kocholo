        "text": "At the Shooting Stars basketball camp—summer 1997—I’m pushing my thin, 13-year-old frame against some 12-year-old, almost six feet tall, as he backs me down through the paint, methodically dribbles the ball, turns, shoots over me and scores. It’s five-on-five. Sixth and seventh graders. We’re in a small rec gym off the main court of Western Reserve Academy, a boarding school in Hudson, Ohio. I run down the court with the offense and the kid backpedals—on his feet the beautiful 1997 Kobes look like clown shoes, long and jutting out with the kid’s open-toed steps. Big-eared, still growing into his body, LeBron James almost looks bored.\n\nTwo years later, I run into the future all-time total points leader in NBA history again. I’m in another Shooting Stars league in Twinsburg, Ohio. This Sunday league gives high school players a chance to warm up before the season begins later in the fall. When I look across the court at the other team, I don’t recognize LeBron. He’s grown about three inches, and has a short afro. His body seems somehow wider.\n\nWhen the game starts, I line up to guard him.\n\nI know it seems strange that I remember a meaningless Sunday camp-league game from over twenty years ago. But if you’ve played enough basketball, you know that most games blend together, are mostly unremarkable. Until—like this one—they’re not.\n\nAs I guard LeBron, I notice how he only plays at half speed. He probably could score every time down the court, but instead seems intent on throwing difficult passes. In one play, on a fast break, rather than dribble it by himself to get an easier shot or pass, he stalls at our three-point line, stares at a teammate jogging to his left, and then throws a no-look one-handed dart above my outstretched arms, between two running defenders, across the entirety of the court. The ball bullets into its recipient’s chest. He catches it like a football, hugging it to his body. Slowly, he throws it in for an uncontested lay-up. On another play, LeBron—gazing straight into the paint—flicks his wrist and the ball shoots over the defense to a wide-open kid in the corner.\n\nMonths before his first high school game, hardly out of eighth grade, he’s almost 6’3”, drilling these absurd passes with minimal movement, minimal eye contact. I still see it in his game today.\n\nThere’s an unwritten rule in competitive athletics: never act impressed or excited by an opposing player’s skills. Show apathy. Indifference. Pretend as if it’s common to see a kid just out of eighth grade gracefully steal a pass, glide up the court, and dunk the ball with one hand, as he would later in the game—cocking it back, tomahawk-style—in a dim, humid, shitty basketball court wedged between two others.\n\nThis is greater Cleveland, northeast Ohio—Rust Belt, Mistake on the Lake, Factory of Sadness, burning rivers, deindustrialization, my Polish grandfather’s long shifts at Lorain’s steel mill, the National Tube. But LeBron doing something beautiful, triumphant. Bigger than Ohio, but of it, somehow. You can feel it.\n\nI run up and down the court, holding tightly to my own dreams of heroism. I run the plays my coach wants. But all I think about is how I want to see a replay of that dunk. That pass.\n\nAfter the game—I did, for the record, score four points on LeBron James—my dad asks the camp director where LeBron is going to high school.\n\n“St. V’s,” he says.\n\nI’d gone to basketball camps at St. Vincent-St. Mary and had almost enrolled there. My dad worked in an office in downtown Akron.\n\n“We should go watch him play,” my dad says. (And we would, for twenty-five years and counting.)\n\nI respond—filtered through my own denial of what I’d seen, my own desire to play varsity—with what in retrospect was one of the most asinine comments in my life. “Yeah, he’s a freshman, but he’ll probably play JV.”\n\nBut the next week, after a few nights of sleep, I’m convinced. During lunch at Trinity High School, miles from downtown Cleveland, I argue with my friend, Bryan, who played with me on the JV team.\n\n“The best you’ve ever seen?” he says, mockingly.\n\n“The best I’ve ever seen.”\n\n“Coming out of 8th grade?” He laughs.\n\n“He’s already the best player in Ohio,” I insist.\n\nBryan laughs again. As a retort, he mentions other well-known high school players from the area. Brian Swift. Roy Hall. Tony Stockman.\n\n“No, no, no,” I say. For the remainder of our sophomore year, I spend a lot of time trying to convince my high school friends that this kid from Akron is something different. I’m a Polish-Irish Catholic at Trinity High School and I rave about what I’d seen like someone claiming to have met the Virgin Mary.\n\nAfter LeBron wins States his freshman year, I drive the twenty minutes to St. V’s, where the team is autographing posters in the Student Center. Always an avid collector, I think the signed team posters would be a great addition to my growing stock of Ohio sports memorabilia. At eight bucks apiece—the money going to the school “Spirit Store” and the athletic department—I buy four.\n\nI drive home, up 77 North, with the posters neatly stacked in the back seat of my mom’s Dodge Neon. Another Ohio fan, looking for other ways to fill the upcoming void left from my dying basketball life. In a little over a year, three months before 9/11, I’ll join the Army National Guard for the minimum six-year enlistment.\n\nOn May 15, 1941, Joe DiMaggio cracked the first hit in what would become a still-record 56-game hit streak. When it happened, Richard Ben Cramer wrote, it “gave America what it needed: something apart from woe and war to talk about.”\n\nSoon after the hit streak, DiMaggio, like many professional athletes at the time, enlisted in the Army Air Forces. Joltin’ Joe had easy tours in California, Hawaii, and New Jersey, but he still lost three seasons of his career. World War II was a total war, essentially involving every American civilian and every economic sector. And many other professional American athletes also served during World War II: Bob Feller, Ted Williams, Jackie Robinson.\n\nIn that sense, World War II was not comparable to our recent American wars, fought by an all-volunteer military; LeBron isn’t Joe DiMaggio for many reasons. Still, I can’t help but associate LeBron’s rise and inevitable denouement with the predominant conflicts of his time: 9/11 and America’s subsequent wars. On a historical timeline, these two seemingly disparate events line up neatly—LeBron rose onto the Ohio scene when he led his team as a freshman to the 1999-2000 state title. To me, the narrative arc of his career—Rookie of the Year, the Decision to Miami, the Return to Cleveland, the 2016 Championship, the current autumn years in Los Angeles—will always be framed by the backdrop of our forever wars.\n\nPerhaps I dwell on my time with LeBron because of what those years were preparing us for. I know that during those games with LeBron, he was—rightly so, thankfully so—training his body for what he’d become. In a way, so was I. Even if I didn’t realize it at the time, I was training my body not for a career in professional sports but for the State, for basic combat training and later, like so many boys wanting to get out of Ohio—wanting to take their talents elsewhere—for a war. If our personal lives, whether we ask for it or not, are interwoven with historical events, I will never be able to disassociate the bloody narrative of America’s post-9/11 wars, the explosive beginning of this century, with this other local wholesome narrative: the kid who would wow so many, who would dominate an international sport, who would become—no matter how reductive—a symbol of American self-determination and capitalism, a purveyor of Nike sneakers, Blaze pizza, Kia motors, Samsung phones, and, yes, all three: Sprite, Coke, and Pepsi.\n\nSo why has LeBron’s career been such a meaningful marker in my own life?\n\nIs it because of his feel-good, rags-to-riches story—a billionaire before his 40th birthday who was born in poverty to a 16-year-old mother? Is it because LeBron’s career—and it means more to anyone who had an up-close seat when he was just a tall, talented kid—feels morally and ethically satisfying against the complicated, messy, wasteful wars I spent years of my life witnessing? Do I latch onto his narrative, along with our tenuous connection as boys on the same court, because with his greatness, talent, and power, I feel, briefly, a hint of immortality and comfort in contributing—I did help him practice, right?—to his growth? Is his career—mythic, ongoing, ineffable—an escape from a disconnected, war-torn, divisive 21st century? Is he like a local band I saw, when no one else was paying attention? Or, as Ohio writer James Wright put it in his famous poem, “Autumn Begins in Martin’s Ferry, Ohio”—which captures economic despair against the backdrop of a high school football game—am I just another Ohio everyman “Dreaming of heroes”?\n\nWhile my adolescent basketball life drifted more into the past, military life was blurry with the constant travel, the post-9/11 drum beats for war. As a deployment overseas became more expected, I found myself latching onto LeBron’s rising career as a way to stay emotionally connected to Ohio and all people and places I’d left behind.\n\nOn June 26, 2003, in a rec room at Camp Ripley, a military base in Minnesota, I watched LeBron get drafted. Hours later, we went out for a two-week field training exercise. I was ecstatic about the pick, about the Cavs’ future, and the thrill stayed with me while I sweated and swatted mosquitos in the Minnesota woods. But I don’t remember anyone discussing it. All the talk was Iraq, Saddam, Bin Laden. Months later, during more training, I spent so much time in the forests of North Carolina, Louisiana and, for about eleven months, Iraq, that I missed LeBron’s rookie year. While overseas, with our limited, slow internet, I tried to keep up with the Cavs and LeBron’s stats when I had time.\n\nAlthough a deployment to Iraq—dozens of IEDs, indirect fire attacks, other close calls—gave me more than enough brushes with mortality, tracing LeBron’s very public career has also marked time, and mortality, in my own life. His very slow senectitude—though inevitable, expected—is all the more complicated and sad in contrast to the images, still rife with energy and awe in my memory, of his on-the-court feats during high school. Like Ali, Jordan, Tiger, Ruth, his career, though brilliant—he may be the “best” ever to play basketball—will succumb to his own mortal, though very well taken-care of, body. He is still, with the more frequent injuries over the last few years, subjected unfortunately to the same laws as anyone. No one, sports commentators love to proclaim, defeats Father Time. Recently, in an interview after losing to the Denver Nuggets in the western conference finals, LeBron teased retirement for the first time. He might’ve meant it sincerely or he might’ve been redirecting the narrative away from his loss; regardless, it’s clearly on his mind as he approaches age 40.\n\nDuring my deployment, 2003-04, which aligned with LeBron’s rookie year, I guess I was learning privately, and intimately, about mortality. In contrast, LeBron’s very slow and gradual demise has been very public, the talk of the sports world. Similar to the ways the American government prefers to keep the maimed or killed soldier’s body away from the public eye—consider the Pentagon, until 2009, banning coverage of flag-draped coffins—so, too, does the sports world prefer to hide or remove an athlete’s body when it can no longer perform on the court or field. Consider how, during a 2014 Team USA scrimmage, workers held up towels to screen us from Paul George’s broken leg. Or Willis McGahee’s twisted leg in the 2003 Fiesta Bowl. Joe Theismann. Moises Alou. Kevin Durant. The list could go on forever. Generally though, we prefer to look away when an athlete reminds us that their body, too, is mortal.\n\nFor years I have thought, sometimes with panic, how I would watch the game after he retires; but more existentially, I’ve thought many times, though not with fear or trepidation, about his death—which seems, because of his mythic, indestructible, near-invincible god-like physique, impossible. I’m a year older, and there are many reasons I’ll probably go before LeBron, but it’s given me a mysterious, bittersweet solace to know that we happened to share the planet, and a few courts, at the same time in this tumultuous start of the 21st-century.\n\nSome of these more morbid thoughts probably come from my time in service, especially after twenty years of reflection. I think of another kid from Ohio, Nicholaus Zimmer, who served beside me during basic training. While I was in Iraq, a few hours north of Zimmer’s location, the Mahdi army killed him during the summer of 2004. Now his name is memorialized on a highway in southeast Columbus. While my entire platoon, luckily, came home, we still had many close calls with IEDs and indirect fire attacks. On the second night at our base, FOB Cobra, seconds after an RPG-attack, I found myself face down in the gravel, my body wedged against a HESCO wall of dirt and a dozen other platoon-mates in the pitch black—all for light discipline, to make it harder to aim at us. We waited there, trying to crawl deeper into the earth, until it was all clear. I remember thinking with certainty that I would probably die, if not that day, then very soon. While this is a lot for a twenty year-old to consider, it’s also typical since wars are often fought by young boys like me. “All wars are boyish, and are fought by boys,” Herman Meville wrote, in 1866, after the American Civil War.\n\nThere is all that, sure, but also the decades of joy—well, not all the time, as I will always be from Cleveland. But a joy that, sometimes at an actual game or even through a TV screen, his basketball artisanship instantaneously conjured, in a way that’s beyond language, a sublime, sudden rush of feeling and electricity that momentarily staved off any hint of mortality and made me—collectively with others, jumping, throwing hands and legs in unnatural directions, emitting sounds of shrieking, incoherent babel blathering from our mouths—alive.\n\nAfter leaving the military, I went to college and started writing about my war experience. Eventually I started teaching while in graduate school. All of this—teaching and writing—helped me to acclimate to civilian life. The study of literature, specifically, provided me a lens through which to reckon with my military experiences. While on a writing fellowship at Stanford University, I met a writer and college athlete from Ohio, Christopher Kempf. He’d be next to me in a dive bar in downtown Cleveland when the Cavs won the finals in 2016. Kempf introduced me to a poem that helped me understand my own relationship with watching pro basketball, particularly LeBron.\n\nIn Quan Barry’s poem, “Doug Flutie’s 1984 Orange Bowl Hail Mary as Water into Fire,” Barry describes the awesome, nearly divine moment when Doug Flutie wins a game with a “Hail Mary.” Specifically, she discusses the ineffable tension during those final six seconds and what that time meant: “Did the child-me know it would be all right, that the next six seconds would represent / human existence?” The moment, Barry suggests, speaks to not only the joy of sport but also to its analogous shadow: the teams, the games themselves, the ball in the air—these are all symbolic locums for death. Barry writes: “We are the ball. We are the arc through the air. We are the no time left on the clock…”\n\nTo emphasize the transformative, life-affirming power of this moment when the ball is an “object / churning toward a predetermined end,” Barry suggests to the reader how these moments, fleeting as they are, can temporarily stave off mortality. “Read this to me,” she pleads, “when I’m dying, when I’m neither here / nor there.”\n\nWhen I read that poem now, I think more about the tiny moments—the images and scenes—that have stayed with me after watching LeBron for over twenty-five years.\n\nI don’t remember which game it was. I went to at least a dozen with friends and family, especially during LeBron’s sophomore and junior seasons. We were at the Canton Fieldhouse sitting on bleachers, a few rows up from the court. LeBron stood out on the wing, his back to us. Dru—my old teammate, and now his—passed him the ball. Standing at the three-point line, protecting the ball, he turned to the crowd. The defender stayed low, crouched in a wide defensive position between LeBron and the basket. Just feet from the stands, LeBron looked at all of us, left and right. His team moved. Fans shouted. Shoes squeaked on the floor. And then, as if on cue, he looked straight into the crowd—his eyes above where I sat—and he threw, with two hands, the ball directly over his head toward the basket. It hit Sian Cotton—it was so fast I couldn’t tell where he’d appeared from—and Cotton turned, took a dribble, and put it in for a lay-up. The entire time, LeBron kept his eyes on the crowd. Everyone stood. The place roared.\n\nHugh Martin, the author of In Country and The Stick Soldiers, teaches at the United States Air Force Academy."
