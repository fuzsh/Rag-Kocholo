        "text": "Kenny Atkinson is taking over as head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers reportedly with “big plans” for his backcourt of Donovan Mitchell and Darius Garland.\n\nAtkinson and Garland recently had dinner on the Las Vegas Strip to talk about his usage, according to Cleveland.com.\n\n“The next afternoon, Cleveland held a brief practice at nearby Palo Verde High School,” wrote Chris Fedor. “Part of that session was for the summer leaguers, going over things before Sunday’s second game. The other was intended for current Cavs to get work in with Atkinson and the new staff before Atkinson heads back overseas to continue his Olympic duties with the French National Team.\n\n“During that practice, Garland and Atkinson went over more intricate details about how the offense will function this coming season and the importance of Garland’s role in the team’s success.\n\n“‘It sounds really good,’ Garland said. ‘A lot of spacing and a lot of room for me and Don and all of the other guys to be able to thrive.'”\n\nThe new head coach then relayed some of the things he talked to Garland about and his plans for him and Mitchell as a duo.\n\n“Atkinson, who has urged Garland to be aggressive and take command of the offense, reiterated that belief during a midgame interview with NBA TV on Sunday,” wrote Fedor.\n\n“He has big plans for Garland and Mitchell. Together.\n\n“‘I can’t wait to work with them,’ Atkinson said. ‘I was a point guard and that’s the quarterback. Those guys are running the show and it’s such a huge position in this league.\n\n“‘I [identify] with them. Huge fan of Darius. Always been a fan. Underrated. Underrated passer. I don’t think he gets enough credit for the feel. Then, Donovan we all know, he’s the real deal. The great ones have a different type of work ethic. He’s wired a little bit differently.’”\n\nIt looks like Mitchell and Garland will be together for the foreseeable future after their long-term future as a pair has been in doubt almost ever since Mitchell arrived in a trade with the Utah Jazz prior to the 2022-23 NBA season.\n\nThis offseason, Mitchell finally agreed to a contract extension with Cleveland, getting a three-year, $150 million deal that has a player option for the 2027-28 season.\n\nFor his part, Garland has denied the perception that he wants to be traded now that Mitchell has gotten his new deal, with a report saying he was “pissed” at that idea being put forth.\n\nMitchell has been named to the NBA All-Star Game in both of his seasons with the Cavs, and Garland was a selection for the 2021-22 contest.\n\nLast season, Garland missed significant time after the 24-year-old suffered a fractured jaw and also had to deal with the death of his grandmother. Mitchell’s campaign also was hindered by various injuries suffered by the 27-year-old.\n\nGarland was able to appear in just 57 regular season games, with Mitchell playing in just 55.\n\nDespite that, the Cavs were able to make the NBA Playoffs for a second straight season. As the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference, they won a playoff series for the first time since 2018 with a seven-game, first-round victory against the Orlando Magic. However, they again fell short of reaching the NBA Finals when they were eliminated by the eventual champion Boston Celtics in the second round in five games.\n\nNow, with Atkinson leading the way, the Cavs will try to take the next step with plans centered around their talented backcourt of Mitchell and Garland."
