        "text": "The Cleveland Cavaliers enjoyed a good season in 2023/24, but \"good\" apparently will not cut it in the Land.\n\nThe Cavaliers have dismissed head coach JB Bickerstaff following a second-round playoff exit to the Boston Celtics, and Cleveland will soon make its fourth different hire at the position in six years. The Cavs have found stability hard to come by since franchise icon LeBron James departed for a second time six years ago -- but their next head coaching hire could offer fans some insight into whether team owner Dan Gilbert believes another reunion with the King is possible this summer, when he opts out of his contract with the Lakers.\n\nThe coaches the Cavs could hire\n\nBickerstaff's dismissal caught some in the NBA by surprise. Cleveland had just wrapped up a season in which they were in contention for a top-three seed in the East until early April, and the Cavaliers won a playoff series for the first time since James left for Los Angeles in 2018. However, the Cavs are aiming much higher than the second round and hope to continue building around a core of Jarrett Allen, Evan Mobley, and one of Donovan Mitchell or Darius Garland.\n\nNBA insiders Brian Windhorst and Shams Charania reported that Cleveland will consider Golden State assistant Kenny Atkinson and New Orleans assistant James Borrego for Bickerstaff's old job, while Windhorst also added Minnesota assistant Micah Nori to the mix. Atkinson and Borrego both have head coaching experience, but no direct link to James. Nori is a native of Middletown, Ohio -- roughly a three-hour drive from James' hometown of Akron."
