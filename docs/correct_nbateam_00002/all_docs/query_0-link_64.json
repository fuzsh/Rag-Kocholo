        "text": "It's always going to be a big deal when LeBron James visits Northeast Ohio. The two are forever linked because of the legacy LeBron left here both on and off the floor. That was made clear on Saturday night even though the Cleveland Cavaliers lost to the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nLeBron took a minute after the game to reflect on what's like coming back to the city and taking the court even as an away player.\n\n\"It's always special to come back here ... I spent 11 years here and being able to come back from the Miami stint and win a championship here for this franchise, for this city, I think it was like a 52-year drought or something like that. You know, for the city of Cleveland, for any sports team, something I will never forget, you know no matter how old I get I'll always remember that moment. So, stepping back on this floor is always a pretty cool feeling.\"\n\nEvery Clevelander will remember where they were when the Cavaliers officially ended that drought on June 19, 2016. It was a moment bigger than sports and one that will live in the city's history forever.\n\nIt's cool that LeBron feels that same way about this moment and to see him talk so highly about playing in front of Cleveland and their fans.\n\nThe city will always have a soft spot for LeBron, no matter what team he's playing for. That was evident on Saturday night as he received a standing ovation and a video tribute when his name was announced in the starting lineup.\n\nLeBron is playing in his 21st season and this run of dominance can't last forever. Some day he'll retire so it's important that James and fans cherish what's happened in the city of Cleveland while he visits as a player."
