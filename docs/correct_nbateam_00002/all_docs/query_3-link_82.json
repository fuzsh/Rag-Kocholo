        "text": "Move over Father Time, you just were handed another loss from the King.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers forward, LeBron James, currently the oldest player in the NBA, set yet another milestone on Saturday night when he became the first and only player in history to score 40,000 career points.\n\nJames entered Saturday's matchup against the Denver Nuggets, a rematch of last season's Western Conference Finals, just nine points shy of reaching 40,000 points.\n\nJames scored five points in the first half and then recorded back-to-back layups early in the second quarter to reach the milestone.\n\nThe 39-year-old surpassed Lakers' legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's scoring record last season and has continued to score at an elite level in his 21st NBA season.\n\n“No one has done it,” James told reporters after the team's overtime victory over the Washington Wizards on Thursday. “And for me to be in this position at this point and time in my career, I think it’s pretty cool. But is it one of the top things I’ve done in my career? No. Does it mean something? Of course. Why wouldn’t it?”\n\nJames didn't set out to break the record early, instead deferring to his teammates recording five assists in the first half.\n\nHowever, for the four-time NBA Champion, it was only a matter of time before he broke the record.\n\nLeBron and scoring go together like peanut butter and jelly. So nine points was only inevitable. James is currently averaging 25.3 points per game this season.\n\nAfter eclipsing 40,000 career points, the Lakers played a video tribute to the King on the jumbotron with highlights of his 21-year career. James' family, including his wife Savannah and his daughter Zhuri were in attendance for the historic achievement.\n\nJames waved to the crowd and his family after the video was played, and then all focus was back on the game.\n\n“To hit feats and have milestones throughout my career, they all mean something to me. Absolutely,” James added. “Obviously, there’s a pecking order of which ones are higher than others. But I would be lying to you if I said no, it doesn’t mean anything. It absolutely does.”\n\nThe Lakers entered Saturday's contest as two-point underdogs to the reigning champion Nuggets.\n\nDenver currently finds themselves in third place in the Western Conference, and just a game out of the top overall seed.\n\nMeanwhile, the Lakers are in 10th place in the West, and fighting for their playoff lives.\n\n“We just want to get better,” James said Thursday night.\n\nThe Lakers occupy the final spot in the NBA's Play-In Tournament but are just three games shy of the 5th seed in the Western Conference.\n\nThis likely won't be LeBron's last milestone or record before he ultimately decides to retire, but just the next accomplishment in a long line of accolades for the King.\n\nWhat's next? LeBron hopes its another championship, only this time with a parade down Chick Hearn Blvd."
