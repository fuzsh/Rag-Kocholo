Widely considered as the greatest Small Forward and one of the greatest players in NBA history, James is frequently compared to Michael Jordan and sometimes Kobe Bryant in debates over the greatest basketball player of all time. James has been nicknamed \"LBJ\", \"King James\", \"L-Train\", and \"The Akron Hammer\".\n\nDuring his 21-year NBA career, James has played for the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Miami Heat, and currently, the Lakers. His accomplishments include four NBA championships, four NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, four NBA Finals MVP Awards, three NBA All-Star MVP Awards, an NBA scoring title, an NBA Rookie of the Year Award, an assist title, an NBA Cup, and two Olympic gold medals. He is the first player in NBA history to have been named the Finals MVP with three different franchises. James is the all-time leading scorer in NBA history and ranks fourth in career career assists. He has been named an All-Star a record 20 times, selected to the All-NBA Team a record 20 times (including 13 All-First Team selections, also a record), and to the All-Defensive Team six times (including five All-First Teams), and was a runner-up for the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award twice in his career. He has competed in ten NBA Finals, the third most all time, including eight consecutive with the Heat and Cavaliers from 2011 through 2018. In 2021, James was selected to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team, and in 2022 became the first and only player in NBA history to accumulate over 10,000 career points, rebounds, and assists. Noted for his longevity, James is currently the oldest player in the NBA.\n\nJames grew up playing high school basketball at St. Vincent–St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio, where he was highly promoted in the national media as a future NBA superstar for his all-around scoring, passing, athleticism, rebounding, defense, and playmaking abilities. After graduating, he was selected with the first overall pick in the 2003 NBA Draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers. Named the 2004 NBA Rookie of the Year, he soon established himself as one of the league's premier players, leading the Cavaliers to their first NBA Finals appearance in 2007 and winning the NBA MVP Award in 2009 and 2010. After failing to win a championship with Cleveland, James left in 2010 as a free agent to join the Heat; this was announced in the television special The Decision and is among the most controversial free-agent decisions in sports history.\n\nJames won his first two NBA championships while playing for the Heat in 2012 and 2013 over the Oklahoma City Thunder and San Antonio Spurs, respectively; in both of these years, he also earned the league's MVP and Finals MVP Awards. After his fourth season with the Heat in 2014, James opted out of his contract and returned to the Cavaliers. In 2016, he led the Cavaliers to victory over the Golden State Warriors in the Finals by coming back from a 3–1 deficit, delivering the team's first championship (his third) and ending the Cleveland sports curse. In 2018, James exercised his contract option to leave the Cavaliers and signed with the Lakers, where he won the championship in 2020 over his former team, the Heat and his fourth Finals MVP. James is also the first player in NBA history to accumulate $1 billion in earnings as an active player. On February 7, 2023, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the all-time leading scorer in NBA history.\n\nOff the court, James has accumulated more wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. He has been featured in books, documentaries (including winning three Sports Emmy Awards as an executive producer), and television commercials. James was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2005, 2013, 2017, and 2019, the most selections by a professional athlete. He has won 20 ESPY Awards, hosted Saturday Night Live, and appeared in films such as Trainwreck and Space Jam: A New Legacy. James has been a part-owner of Liverpool F.C. since 2011, with the club winning the 2018–2019 UEFA Champions League and 2019–2020 Premier League. Having become more involved in philanthropic and activist pursuits later in his career, James's charitable organization, the LeBron James Family Foundation, helped open an elementary school, housing complex, and community center/retail plaza in his hometown of Akron.\n\nEarly life\n\nJames was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio, to Gloria Marie James, who was 16 at the time of his birth. His father, Anthony McClelland, has an extensive criminal record and was not involved in his life. When James was growing up, life was often a struggle for the family, as they moved from apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled to find steady work. Realizing that her son would be better off in a more stable family environment, Gloria allowed him to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach who introduced James to basketball when he was nine years old.\n\nJames began playing organized basketball in the fifth grade. He later played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars. The team enjoyed success on a local and national level, led by James and his friends Sian Cotton, Dru Joyce III, and Willie McGee. The group dubbed themselves the \"Fab Four\" and promised each other that they would attend high school together. In a move that stirred local controversy, they chose to attend St. Vincent–St. Mary High School, a private Catholic school with predominantly white students.\n\nHigh school\n\nFreshman year\n\nAs a 6-foot-2-inch (1.88 m) tall freshman, James averaged 21 points and 6 rebounds per game for the St. Vincent–St. Mary varsity basketball team.[1]. The Fighting Irish went 27–0 en route to the Division III state title, making them the only boys high school team in Ohio to finish the season undefeated. Keith Dambrot, now head coach at the University of Akron, was the head coach at St. Vincent - St. Mary. Coach Dambrot started working with James doing $1 clinics at a local recreation center.[2]\n\nSophomore year\n\nIn his sophomore year, James averaged 25.2 points, 7.2 rebounds, 5.8 assists, and 3.8 steals.[2] For some home games during the season, St. Vincent–St. Mary played at the University of Akron's 5,492-seat Rhodes Arena to satisfy ticket demand from alumni, fans, as well as college and NBA scouts who wanted to see James play. The Fighting Irish finished the season 26–1 and repeated as state champions.[3] He was the first sophomore to be named Ohio Mr. Basketball and also became the first sophomore player ever selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team for his outstanding play.[3]\n\nJunior year\n\nIn 2001, during the summer before his junior year, James was the subject of a feature article in SLAM Magazine in which writer Ryan Jones lauded the 16-year-old James, who had grown to 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m), as \"[possibly] the best high school basketball player in America right now\".[3] During the season, James also appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated, becoming the first high school basketball underclassman to do so. With averages of 29 points, 8.3 rebounds, 5.7 assists, and 3.3 steals per game, he was again named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team, and became the first junior to be named male basketball Gatorade National Player of the Year. St. Vincent–St. Mary finished the year with a 23–4 record, ending their season with a loss in the Division II championship game. Following the loss, James unsuccessfully petitioned for a change to the NBA's Draft eligibility rules in an attempt to enter the 2002 NBA Draft. During this time, he used marijuana, which he said was to help cope with the stress that resulted from the constant media attention that he was receiving. His popularity forced his team to move their practices from the school gym to the nearby James A. Rhodes Arena at the University of Akron. NBA stars such as Shaquille O'Neal attended the games, and a few of James' high school games were even televised nationally on ESPN2 and regionally on pay-per-view. Although his mother feared a football injury could hurt his chances in the NBA, James played his junior year of football and had 52 receptions for more than 1,000 yards and 15 touchdowns. James fractured the index finger on his left hand in the first game of the post-season, but did not reveal the injury until after the state finals, where his team lost.\n\nSenior year\n\nThroughout his senior year, James and the Fighting Irish traveled around the country to play a number of nationally ranked teams, including a game on December 12, 2002, against Oak Hill Academy that was nationally televised on ESPN2. Time Warner Cable, looking to capitalize on James's popularity, offered St. Vincent–St. Mary's games to subscribers on a pay-per-view basis throughout the season. For the year, James averaged 31.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.6 assists, and 3.4 steals per game, was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team for an unprecedented third consecutive year, and was named Gatorade National Player of the Year for the second consecutive year. He participated in three year-end high school basketball all-star games—the EA Sports Roundball Classic, the Jordan Capital Classic, and the McDonald's All-American Game—losing his National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) eligibility and making it official that he would enter the 2003 NBA Draft.\n\nAlso during his senior year, James was the centerpiece of several controversies. For his 18th birthday, he skirted state amateur bylaws by accepting a Hummer H2 as a gift from his mother, who had secured a loan for the vehicle by utilizing James's future earning power as an NBA superstar. This prompted an investigation by the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) because its guidelines stated that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance.[4]\n\nLater in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys of Wes Unseld and Gale Sayers worth $845 from NEXT, an urban clothing store in Shaker Square, in exchange for his posing for pictures to be displayed on the store's walls, OHSAA stripped him of his eligibility.[5] James appealed and a judge blocked the ruling, reducing the penalty to a two-game suspension and allowing him to play the remainder of the season. However, James's team was forced to forfeit one of their wins as a result.[6]That forfeit loss was the team's only official loss that season. Despite the distractions, James scored a career-high 52 points in his first game back after the suspension. St. Vincent–St. Mary went on to win the Division II championship, marking their third division title in four years, with James averaging 31.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.6 assists and 3.4 steals on the season.[3] James was named to the All-USA First Team for an unprecedented third time, and was selected as Mr. Basketball of Ohio.[3]\n\nJames finished his high school career with 2,657 points, 892 rebounds, and 523 assists.[3]\n\nAs LeBron was an avid football player, James was also named First-Team All-State as a wide receiver.[7] He was recruited by some Division I programs, including Notre Dame. At the conclusion of his second year, he was named first team All-State, and as a junior, he helped lead the Fighting Irish to the State Semifinals. He did not play during his senior year because of a wrist injury that he sustained in an AAU basketball game. Some sports analysts, football critics, high school coaches, former and current players have speculated that James could have played in the National Football League.[8]\n\nProfessional career\n\nCleveland Cavaliers (2003–2010)\n\n2003–2004: Rookie of the Year\n\nJames was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall pick in the 2003 NBA Draft. In his first professional game, he recorded 25 points against the Sacramento Kings, setting an NBA record for most points scored by a prep-to-pro player in his debut outing.[34] In a late season match-up with the New Jersey Nets, he scored a season-high 41 points, becoming the youngest player in league history to score at least 40 points in a game at 19 years of age.[35] He was eventually named the Rookie of the Year, finishing with averages of 20.9 points, 5.9 assists, and 5.5 rebounds per game.[36] He became the first Cavalier to receive the honor and joined Oscar Robertson and Michael Jordan as the only players in NBA history to average at least 20 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists per game in their rookie year (Tyreke Evans has since joined this group).[37] The Cavaliers finished the season 35–47, failing to make the playoffs despite an 18-game improvement over the previous year.[38]\n\n2004–2008: Rise to superstardom\n\nJames recorded his first career triple-double on January 19 of the 2004–05 NBA season, becoming the youngest player in league history to record a triple-double at 20 years.[36][39] His play earned him his first All-Star Game selection, where he added 13 points, 8 rebounds, and 6 assists in a winning effort for the Eastern Conference.[40] Around the league, teams took note of his rapid development, and Denver Nuggets coach George Karl told Sports Illustrated: \"It's weird talking about a 20-year-old kid being a great player, but he is a great player ... He's the exception to almost every rule.\" On March 20, he scored a career-high 56 points against the Toronto Raptors, setting Cleveland's new single game points record.[41] With averages of 27.2 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 2.2 steals per game to finish the season, he became the youngest player in NBA history to be named to an All-NBA Team, being selected to the All-NBA Second Team.[10] Despite a 30–20 record to start the year,[41] Cleveland again failed to make the playoffs, finishing the season at 42-40.[42]\n\nAt the 2006 All-Star Game, James led the East to victory with a 29 point and 6 rebound performance, becoming the youngest ever winner of the All-Star Game MVP Award at 21 years, 51 days.[43] For the season, he averaged 31.4 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.6 assists per game, becoming the youngest player in league history to average at least 30 points per game.[36][44] He was considered a strong candidate for the Most Valuable Player Award, but eventually finished second in the voting to Steve Nash; however, he was awarded co-MVP honors with Nash by The Sporting News,[45] and was named to the All-NBA First Team for the first time in his career.[46] Under James' leadership, the Cavaliers qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 1998,[47] improving their record by 33 wins from the year before he was drafted.[48] In his playoff debut, he recorded a triple-double in a winning effort versus the Washington Wizards.[49] In Game 3 of the series, he made the first game-winning shot of his career, making another in Game 5.[50] Cleveland would go on to defeat the Wizards in six games before being ousted by the defending Eastern Conference champion Detroit Pistons in the second round in seven games.[51][52]\n\nAfter the 2006 Playoffs, James and the Cavaliers negotiated a three-year, $60 million contract extension with a player option for a fourth year.[53] Although it was for fewer years and less money than the maximum he could sign, it allotted him the option of seeking a new contract worth more money as an unrestricted free agent following the 2009–10 season.[53] He discussed this decision with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, fellow members of his 2003 Draft class, who also re-signed with their respective teams while allowing them to be unrestricted agents in 2010.[54]\n\nFor the 2006–07 season, James' averages declined to 27.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 6.0 assists, and 1.6 steals per game.[10] Some analysts attributed the fall to a regression in his passing skills and shot selection, which stemmed from a lack of effort and focus. The Cavaliers finished the year with 50 wins for the second consecutive year and entered the playoffs as the East's second seed.[55][56] In the first round, Cleveland swept the Wizards, and in the second round, they defeated the New Jersey Nets en route to a rematch with the Pistons from the year before.[57] In Game 5 of the Conference Finals, James notched a playoff franchise record 48 points with 9 rebounds and 7 assists, and scored 29 of the Cavaliers' last 30 points including the game-winning lay-up with two seconds left in double-overtime.[58] After the game, play-by-play announcer Marv Albert called the performance \"one of the greatest moments in postseason history\" and color commentator Steve Kerr called it \"Jordan-esque.\"[59] In 2012, ESPN ranked the performance the fourth greatest in modern NBA playoff history.[60] Cleveland won the series to advance to the Finals for the first time in history versus the San Antonio Spurs, losing in four games.[57] For the postseason, James averaged 25.1 points, 8.0 assists, and 8.1 rebounds per game, although his Finals averages dropped to 22.0 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on just 35.6 percent shooting mostly due to the fact that he had very little talent supporting him and was facing a more deeper and experienced team.[10][36]\n\nDuring the 2007–08 season, James was named the All-Star Game MVP for the second time behind a 27 point, 8 rebound, 9 assist, 2 steal, and 2 block performance.[61][62] On March 21, he moved past Brad Daugherty as the Cavaliers' all-time leading scorer in a game against the Raptors, doing so in over 100 less games than Daugherty.[63] With seven triple-doubles to finish the year, James set a new personal and team record for triple-doubles in a season.[64] His 30 points per game were also the highest in the league, representing his first and thus far only scoring title.[65] Despite his individual accomplishments, Cleveland's record fell from the year before to 45–37.[66] Seeded fourth in the East entering the playoffs, the Cavaliers were matched up with the Wizards in the first round for the third consecutive season.[67] In a pre-series interview, Washington Guard DeShawn Stevenson stirred up controversy when he called James \"overrated\".[68] James answered by saying that responding to Stevenson would be like rap icon Jay Z feuding with one-hit wonder Soulja Boy.[68] In the series, Cleveland defeated the Wizards in six games (like in 2006) before being eliminated in seven games by the newly-formed and eventual champion Boston Celtics in the next round.[69] During the decisive seventh game in Boston, James scored 45 points and Paul Pierce scored 41 in a game the Associated Press described as a \"shootout\".[70]\n\n2008–2010: MVP seasons\n\nIn the 2008–09 season, James finished second in Defensive Player of the Year voting and made his first NBA All-Defensive Team Selection behind 23 chase-down blocks and a career-high 93 total blocks.[71][72] He also became only the fourth post-merger player to lead his team in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks in a single season. Behind his play and the acquisition of All-Star Mo Williams, the Cavaliers went a franchise record 66–16 and fell one game short of matching the best home record in league history.[73] With final averages of 28.4 points, 7.6 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 1.7 steals, and a career-high 1.2 blocks per game, James became the first Cavalier to win the NBA MVP Award.[74] Reflecting on James's performance for ESPN, John Hollinger later wrote: \"He's having what is arguably the greatest individual season in history, and it's time we gave him his due for it.\" In the playoffs, Cleveland swept the Detroit Pistons and Atlanta Hawks to earn a match-up with the Orlando Magic in the Conference Finals.[75] In Game 1 of the series, James scored 49 points, 3 rebounds, and 8 assists with a 66 percent shooting rate in a losing effort for the Cavaliers.[60] In Game 2, Magic's Hedo Türkoğlu shot a 12-foot jumper to give the Magic a 2-point lead with 1 second left. Following a Cleveland timeout, Mo Williams inbounded the ball to James, but heavy defense by Türkoğlu denied James a chance at a tying layup. James then attempted and successfully made a three-point shot over Türkoğlu, Dwight Howard, and Rashard Lewis (the first buzzer-beater of his career), giving the Cavs a 96–95 victory to tie the series at 1–1.[76] Following losses in both Games 3 and 4, James and the rest of the Cavs scored a victory in Game 5, making it 3–2, to send the series back to Orlando. In Game 6, he scored a playoff low 25 points and the Cavaliers lost the series to Orlando, and following the loss, James immediately left the floor without shaking hands with his opponents, an act that many media members viewed as unsportsmanlike.[77] Jalen Rose, a former NBA player and current ESPN commentator, said that James' actions were \"immature and ingracious\". James later told reporters: \"It's hard for me to congratulate somebody after you just lose to them, I'm a winner. It's not being a poor sport or anything like that. If somebody beats you up, you're not going to congratulate them. ... I'm a competitor. That's what I do. It doesn't make sense for me to go over and shake somebody's hand.\"[78] For the series, he averaged 38.5 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 8 assists per game,[79] finishing the postseason with a career playoff-high 35.3 points per game.[46]\n\nTo address their lack of an inside presence against the Magic, the Cavaliers traded for four-time champion and Center Shaquille O'Neal before the 2009–10 season; however, Shaq at this point was out of his prime and a shell of his former self.[80] To give James more scoring help, Cleveland also added All-Star Antawn Jamison to their roster at the trading deadline.[81] In February of the season, James was forced into a temporary Point Guard role following a series of injuries to players in the Cavaliers' backcourt. Behind his leadership and with the additions of O'Neal and Jamison, Cleveland lost no momentum, finishing the year with the best record in the league for the second consecutive season. Due in part to his increased minutes as the Cavaliers' primary ball handler, James increased his statistical production, averaging 29.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, career-high 8.6 assists, 1.6 steals, and 1 block per game on 50 percent shooting en route to another MVP Award.[82] In the playoffs, Cleveland beat the Chicago Bulls in five games in the first round, but fell to the eventual Conference champion Boston Celtics in the second round in six games.[84] James was heavily criticized for not playing well in the series, particularly in Game 5 when he shot only 20 percent on 14 shots, scoring 15 points. This lackadaisical performance caused team owner Dan Gilbert and many fans to accuse LeBron of quitting during this game.[85] At the conclusion of the game, he walked off the court to a smattering of boos from the Cavaliers' home crowd, the team having just suffered their worst home playoff loss ever as well as worst loss in franchise history.[86] Cleveland was officially eliminated from the postseason in Game 6, with James recording 27 points, 19 rebounds, and 10 assists, but on just 38 percent shooting with 9 turnovers.[84]\n\nMiami Heat (2010–2014)\n\nThe Decision\n\nJames became an unrestricted free agent at 12:01 am EDT on July 1, 2010.[87] During his free agency, he was courted by several teams including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers.[88] On July 8, he announced on a live ESPN special titled The Decision that he would sign with the Heat.[89] The telecast, broadcast from the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut, have raised $2.5 million for the charity. An additional $3.5 million from advertisement revenue that was donated to other charities.[90][91] The day before the special, fellow free agents Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh had also announced that they would sign with Miami; reports later arose that back in 2006 the trio had discussed among themselves their upcoming 2010 free agencies.[92][93] James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part so that he could shoulder less load offensively, thinking that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning a championship than had he stayed in Cleveland.[94][95] Heat president Pat Riley played a major role in selling James on the idea of playing with Wade and Bosh.[96] Relieved of the burden of scoring, James thought that he could be the first player to average a triple-double in a season since Oscar Robertson.[94]\n\nUpon leaving the Cavaliers, James drew immense criticism from sports analysts, executives, fans, and current and former players for leaving the Cavaliers. The Decision itself was also scrutinized and viewed as unnecessary. Many thought that the prolonged wait for James' choice was unprofessional as not even the teams courting him were aware of his decision until moments before the show.[97] Upon learning that James would not be returning to Cleveland, Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert published an open letter to fans in which he aggressively denounced James' actions.[98] Some angry fans of the team recorded videos of themselves burning his jersey.[99] Former NBA players including Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson were also critical of James, condemning him for joining with Wade and Bosh in Miami and not trying to win a championship as \"the guy\".[100][101][102] James drew further criticism in a September interview with CNN when he claimed that race might have been a factor in the fallout from The Decision.[103][104] As a result of his actions during the 2010 free agency period, James quickly gained a reputation as one of America's most disliked athletes, which was a radical change from years prior.[105][106] The phrase \"taking my talents to South Beach\" became a punch line for critics.[107][108]\n\nImmediately following The Decision, James claimed that there was nothing he would change about the handling of his free agency despite all the criticism.[109] Since then, he has expressed remorse over his actions. During the 2010–11 season, he said he \"probably would do it a little bit different ... But I'm happy with my decision.\"[110] James relented about the special before the 2011–12 season: \"... if the shoe was on the other foot and I was a fan, and I was very passionate about one player, and he decided to leave, I would be upset too about the way he handled it.\"[106]\n\n2010–2011: Debut season, year of media, and fan of scrutiny\n\nJames officially became a member of the Heat on July 10, completing a sign-and-trade six-year contract with the team.[111] which sent two second- and two first-round draft picks to the Cavaliers and gave the team the option to swap first round picks with the Heat in 2012. As part of the first modern player-created NBA superteam, he became only the third reigning MVP to change teams and the first since Moses Malone in 1982.[112] Although his contract would have allowed him to earn the maximum salary under the collective bargaining agreement, he took less money in order for Miami to be able to afford Bosh and Wade as well as further roster support.[113] That evening, the Heat threw a welcome party for their new \"Big Three\" at the American Airlines Arena, an event that took on a rock concert atmosphere.[114] During the gathering, James predicted a dynasty for the Heat and alluded to multiple championships.[115][116] Outside of Miami, the spectacle was not well-received, furthering the negative public perception of James.[117][118]\n\nThroughout the 2010–11 season, James embraced the villain role bestowed upon him by the media. He later said that the negativity surrounding him as a result of his actions during the 2010 free agency \"basically turned me into somebody I wasn't ... You start to hear 'the villain,' now you have to be the villain, you know, and I started to buy into it. I started to play the game of basketball at a level, or at a mind state that I've never played at before ... meaning, angry. And that's mentally. That's not the way I play the game.\"[119] He often played the Point Guard role that Pat Riley sold to him during free agency,[120] and in an early season victory versus the Minnesota Timberwolves, he was Miami's primary ball handler and registered a game-high 12 assists, the most ever by a Heat Forward.[121] To begin the year, they struggled to adjust to these new circumstances, going only 9–8 after 17 games. James later admitted that the constant negativity surrounding the team made him play with an angrier demeanor than in years past. On December 2, he returned to Cleveland for the first time since departing as a free agent, scoring 38 points and leading Miami to a 118-90 win while being booed every time he touched the ball.[122][123] The Heat eventually turned their season around, with James averaging 26.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, 7 assists, and 1.6 steals per game on 51 percent shooting.[46] Entering the playoffs as the East's second seed, Miami defeated the 76ers, the Celtics, and the first-seeded Bulls each in five games. In the Conference Semifinals, James and his teammates found themselves matched up with the Celtics for the second consecutive year. In Game 5, he scored Miami's last ten points to help seal a series-clinching win, including two clutch threes over Paul Pierce. After the final buzzer, he famously knelt on the court in an emotional moment, later telling reporters that it was an extremely personal victory for him and the team. The Heat eventually advanced to the Finals, where they were defeated by the Dallas Mavericks in six games.[124] James received the brunt of the criticism for the loss, averaging only three points in fourth quarters in the series and scored just eight points Game 4, a game that Miami lost by just three.[125] His scoring average of 17.8 points per game signified an 8.9-point drop from the regular season, the lowest such drop-off in league history.[126]\n\nHe also averaged less points than both Bosh and Wade despite being regarded as the best player on the team, and shot very inefficiently from the field during the series.\n\n2011–2013: Back–to–back championships and second MVP reign\n\nThe 2011–2012 season was delayed by a lockout, and during that extended summer,[127] James worked with Hakeem Olajuwon on his post game.[128] Humbled by the Heat's loss to the Mavericks, James spent the offseason attempting to improve himself as a basketball player and a person. The experience inspired James to leave behind the villain role that he had been embracing, which helped him regain a sense of joy on the court. His work with Olajuwon paid off, fueling what writer Kirk Goldsberry called \"one of the greatest and most important transformations in recent sports history\".[129] Behind James' more post-oriented play and expanded skillset,[129] Miami matched their best start to a season in franchise history at 18-6,[130] and at the conclusion of the lockout-shortened 2011–12 campaign, James was named the MVP for the third time, finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 7.9 rebounds, 6.2 assists, and 1.9 steals per game on 53 percent shooting.[131]\n\nThe Heat entered the 2012 Playoffs with the second seed in the East.[132] They defeated the Knicks in five games in the first round. In the second round, Miami temporarily lost Bosh to an abdominal injury and found themselves trailing the Indiana Pacers 2–1.[132] In Game 4, James turned in one of the best all-around performances of his career, registering 40 points, 18 rebounds, and 9 assists in a winning effort on the road to help even the series.[133] Miami eventually won the series in six games.[132] In the Conference Finals, the Heat again faced the Celtics, winning the first two games before dropping the next three.[132] To compensate for Bosh's absence, the Heat embraced a small-ball lineup with James at Power Forward, which they retained even after Bosh's return in the Conference Finals. Facing elimination, James led Miami to 98-79 victory by scoring 45 points and 15 rebounds in Game 6, making 19 of 26 shot attempts for a 73 percent shooting rate in what The New York Times called a \"career-defining performance\".[134][135] The Heat won Game 7 101-88 to advance to the Finals, earning them a matchup with the Oklahoma City Thunder and James's budding rival Kevin Durant.[132] Despite holding a 13-point first half lead in Game 1, Miami lost the first game of the series, but rebounded to win the next two games and go up 2–1.[136][137][138] Game 4 proved to be a memorable one for James. With five minutes left in the game, he started experiencing leg cramps and was carried off the floor. He returned soon after and hit a three-pointer with 2:51 left to give the Heat a three point lead they did not relinquish.[139] In Game 5, James registered his only triple-double of the season as Miami defeated Oklahoma City for their second ever championship and James' first championship.[140] James was unanimously voted the Finals MVP with averages of 28.6 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game.[141] His final playoff averages were 30.3 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per game which was later ranked the second best in modern NBA history by ESPN.[142]\n\nIn February of the 2012–13 season, James had a \"month for the ages\",[143] averaging 29.7 points and 7.8 assists per game while setting multiple shooting efficiency records and becoming the first player since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in March 1983 to take more than 200 shots in a calendar month and make at least 64 percent of them.[144][145] During this period, the Heat began a 27–game winning streak, the third longest in NBA history.[146] Based on these accomplishments, James's performance was described as a \"month for the ages\" by Sports Illustrated. Behind his play, Miami finished the year with a franchise and league best 66–16 record (similar to Cleveland's best record in the 2008–09 season),[147] and James was named MVP for the fourth time, falling just one vote shy of becoming the first player in NBA history to win the award unanimously.[148] His final season averages were 26.8 points, 8 rebounds, 7.3 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 56.5 percent shooting.[46]\n\nTo start the 2013 Playoffs, the Heat swept the Milwaukee Bucks and defeated the Bulls in five games en route to a Conference Finals match-up versus the Pacers.[149] In Game 1 against Indiana, James scored a buzzer-beating layup in overtime to give Miami a one point victory.[150] Throughout the series, James' supporting cast struggled significantly, and his added scoring load prompted him to compare his responsibilities to those of his \"Cleveland days\".[151] Despite these struggles, the Heat won the series in seven games, advancing to the Finals for a meeting with the San Antonio Spurs,[149] signifying a rematch for James from his first Finals six years earlier.[152] At the beginning of the series, James was criticized for his lack of aggressiveness and poor shot selection as Miami fell behind 2-3.[79][149][153] In Game 6, James recorded his second triple-double of the series, including 16 fourth quarter points to lead the Heat to a comeback victory.[154] In Game 7, Miami defeated San Antonio for their second consecutive championship.[149] James notched 37 points in the deciding game, including five three-pointers (along with a 17-foot clutch dagger over Kawhi Leonard), tying Celtics legend Tom Heinsohn in the 1957 Finals against the St. Louis Hawks for the record of most points scored in an NBA Finals Game 7 victory.[155] He was named Finals MVP for the second straight season, averaging 25.3 points, 10.9 rebounds, 7 assists, and 2.3 steals per game for the series and 25.9 points, 8.4 rebounds, and 6.6 assists per game for the playoffs.[46][156]\n\n2013–2014: Final season in Miami and three–peat chase\n\nOn March 3 of the 2013–14 season, James scored a career-high and franchise-record 61 points in a game against the Charlotte Bobcats. James converted on his first eight three-point field goal attempts through three quarters, setting a new record for the most three-point field goals made in a 60-point game. James also set the record for most points in a single game while wearing a mask. Throughout the year, he was one of the few staples for a Heat roster that used 20 different starting lineups due to injuries, finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 6.4 assists per game on 56.7 percent shooting. In the second round of the playoffs, he tied a career postseason-high by scoring 49 points in Game 4 against the Brooklyn Nets.[147] In the next round, Miami defeated the Pacers for the third straight year to earn their fourth consecutive Finals berth, becoming the first Eastern Conference team and one of the only four teams in NBA history to do so. They once again faced the Spurs in a rematch from 2013. In Game 1 of the Finals, James missed most of the fourth quarter because of leg cramps, helping the Spurs take an early series lead. In Game 2, he led the Heat to a series-tying victory with 35 points on a 64 percent shooting rate. San Antonio eventually eliminated the Heat in five games, ending Miami's quest for a three-peat. For the Finals, James has averaged 28.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, a Finals-low 4.0 assists, and 2.0 steals per game on 57% shooting.\n\nReturn to the Cavaliers (2014–2018)\n\nOn June 25, 2014, James opted out of his contract with the Heat, and on July 1, he officially became an unrestricted free agent. On July 11, he revealed via a first-person essay in Sports Illustrated that he intended to return to the Cavaliers to bring his hometown a championship. In contrast to The Decision, his announcement to return to Cleveland was well-received. On July 12, he officially signed with the team, who had compiled a league-worst 97–215 record in the four seasons following his departure. A month after James's signing, the Cavaliers had acquired Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves, forming a new star trio along with Kyrie Irving.\n\n2014–2016: Third championship and breaking the Cleveland sports curse\n\nIn January of the 2014–15 season, James missed two weeks due to left knee and lower back strains, which at the time represented the longest stretch of missed games in his career. In total, he played a career-low 69 games and his final averages were 25.3 points, 6 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game. In the second round of the playoffs, he hit a baseline jumper over Jimmy Butler at the buzzer to give Cleveland a 2–2 series tie with the Bulls, eventually winning the series in six. In the Conference Finals, the Cavaliers defeated the top-seeded Hawks four games to zero to advance to the Finals, making James the first player since the 1960s to play in five consecutive Finals.[165] For most of the Finals against the Golden State Warriors, Irving and Love were sidelined due to injury, giving James more offensive responsibilities. Behind his leadership, the Cavaliers opened the series with a 2–1 lead before being eliminated in six games. Despite the loss, he received serious consideration for the Finals MVP Award, averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game for the championship round and surpassed Rick Barry's 122 in 1967 for the most points scored through the the first three Finals games at 123. However, he shot less than 40% from the field during the whole series, which was quite bad for his standards.\n\nDuring the 2015–16 season, James was criticized for his role in several off-court controversies, including the midseason firing of Cavaliers' coach David Blatt. Despite these distractions, Cleveland finished the year with 57 wins, the best record in the East, and third-best overall. James's final averages were 25.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on 52 percent shooting. In the playoffs, the Cavaliers advanced comfortably to the Finals, sweeping Detroit and Atlanta losing only two games against Toronto en route to a rematch with the Warriors, who were coming off a record-setting 73-win season. To begin the series, Cleveland fell behind 3–1, including two blowout losses. James responded by registering back-to-back 41 point games in Games 5 and 6 (becoming the first player since Shaquille O'Neal in 2000 to score more than 40 points in back-to-back Finals games), leading the Cavaliers to two consecutive wins to stave off elimination. In Game 7, he posted a triple-double and made a number of key plays, including \"The Block\" on Andre Iguodala, as Cleveland emerged victorious, winning the city's first professional sports title in 52 years and becoming the first team in NBA history to come back from a 3–1 series deficit in the Finals. James became just the third player to record a triple-double in an NBA Finals Game 7, and behind series averages of 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.3 blocks, and 2.6 steals per game, he also became the first player in league history to lead both teams in all five statistical categories for a playoff round, culminating in a unanimous Finals MVP selection.\n\n2016–2018: End of second stint in Cleveland\n\nThe 2016–17 season was marred by injuries and unexpected losses for the Cavaliers; James later described it as one of the \"strangest\" years of his career. Following a January defeat to the New Orleans Pelicans, he publicly criticized Cleveland's front office for constructing a team that he felt was too \"top heavy\", for which he received countercriticism. The Cavaliers finished the season as the East's second seed, with James averaging 26.4 points and career highs in rebounds (8.6), assists (8.7), and turnovers (4.1) per game. In Game 3 of the first round of the postseason, he registered 41 points, 13 rebounds, and 12 assists against the Indiana Pacers, leading Cleveland to a comeback victory after trailing by 25 points at halftime, representing the largest halftime deficit overcome in NBA Playoff history. In Game 5 of the Conference Finals against the Celtics, James scored 35 points and surpassed Michael Jordan as the league's all-time postseason scoring leader. The Cavaliers won the game and the series, advancing to their third consecutive Finals against the Warriors, who had signed James' rival Kevin Durant during the offseason. Behind averages of 33.6 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists per game, James became the first player to average a triple-double in the Finals, but Cleveland was defeated in five games by the superteam Warriors.\n\nPrior to the start of the 2017–18 season, the Cavaliers overhauled their roster by trading Kyrie Irving to the Celtics, who requested a trade in part because he no longer wanted to play with James and wanted more responsibility on the offensive side of the ball. After a slow start to the year, Cleveland rebounded by winning 18 of 19 games in December. Their turnaround began with a victory over the Wizards where James scored 57 points, which represented the second-highest point total of his career and tied a franchise record. On November 28, James was ejected for the first time in his career in a game against the Heat when he rushed over to argue with referee Kane Fitzgerald about a no-call on his drive to the basket. Fitzgerald gave James an immediate technical foul before ejecting him with 1:56 remaining in the quarter and the Cavs leading by 23. When asked about the situation, James stated, \"I got fouled and showed my frustration to the ref, and he sent me to the locker room. That particular play, I got fouled all the way up the court. That's what it was about. I said what I had to say and I moved on, but he decided I should get (ejected). We got the win, that's what's most important.\" In January, the Cavaliers had a losing record, and James was criticized for his lackluster effort. The next month, James won his third All-Star Game MVP Award, after posting 29 points, 10 rebounds, 8 assists, and several key plays to help Team LeBron win over Team Curry. Following another round of trades in February, Cleveland returned to form and James reached a number of historical milestones; for example, on March 30, he set an NBA record with 867 straight games scoring in double digits. James eventually finished the season with averages of 27.5 points, 8.6 rebounds, a then career-high 9.2 assists, and 4.2 turnovers per game.\n\nIn the playoffs, he guided the Cavaliers to another Finals rematch with the Warriors. Along the way, he had some of the most memorable moments of his career, including a game-winning shot against the Pacers and another against the Raptors. In the first game of the Finals, James scored a playoff career-high 51 points, but Cleveland was defeated in overtime. Following the defeat, James injured his hand after punching a wall in frustration in the locker room, which hindered his effectiveness for the remainder of the series. The Cavaliers lost the series in four games, with James averaging 34 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 10 assists per game for the Finals, being swept for the second time in his career, making him the fifth player to get swept in the Finals twice, joining Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wes Unseld, and Michael Cooper as well as the first player to be swept in the Finals in two different decades.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers (2018–present)\n\n2018–2019: Injury and playoff miss\n\nOn June 29, 2018, James opted out of his contract with the Cavaliers and became an unrestricted free agent. On July 1, his management company, Klutch Sports, announced that he would sign with the Los Angeles Lakers; the deal was officially completed on July 9. In an interview with Sports Illustrated, James's agent, Rich Paul, explained, \"In 2010, when he went to Miami, it was about championships. In 2014, when he went back to Cleveland, it was about delivering on a promise. In 2018, it was just about doing what he wants to do.\" Reaction to the move was more positive than his original departure from the Cavaliers due to him leading the team to four straight Finals and winning in 2016, ending the city's drought, albeit still mixed, as some onlookers felt that Los Angeles was not his optimal destination.\n\nThe Lakers expected James to immediately transform them into a championship contender and create a new dynasty after having missed the playoffs since 2014 and not appearing in the Finals since 2010. Following his signing, the Lakers rounded out their roster with a controversial collection of playmakers and veterans. As a result, to begin the 2018–19 season, the team struggled to find effective lineups and recorded only two wins through their first seven games. In November, they began a turnaround, which included two of James's strongest performances of the season. On November 14, he registered 44 points, 10 rebounds, and nine assists in a 126–117 victory against the Portland Trail Blazers, passing Wilt Chamberlain, and four days later he scored a season-high 51 points in a 113–97 win over the Miami Heat. After blowing out the two-time defending NBA champion Golden State Warriors 127–101 on Christmas Day, Los Angeles improved their record to 20–14, but James suffered a groin injury in the process, the first major injury of his career. He ultimately missed a then career-high 17 consecutive games, and the Lakers fell out of playoff contention without him. The team was unable to recover and failed to qualify for the postseason, marking the first time since 2005 that James missed the playoffs as well as the first time since 2010 that he had failed to reach the Finals and the sixth straight year that Lakers have missed the playoffs, overall. On March 7, the Lakers announced that James would begin a minutes restriction, and on March 30, he was officially ruled out for the remainder of the season. James's final averages were 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game. Despite his inconsistent campaign, he was ultimately named to the All-NBA Third Team, marking the first time in twelve years that he did not make the All-NBA First Team.\n\n2019–2020: Fourth NBA championship\n\nDuring the offseason, the Lakers had hired Frank Vogel as their new head coach, and traded the majority of their young core to the New Orleans Pelicans for All-Star big man Anthony Davis. James immediately embraced Los Angeles's much-improved roster by transforming his playing style, moving to full-time point guard and competing with a more consistent defensive effort. Behind James's leadership, the Lakers opened the 2019–20 season with a 17–2 record, matching the best start in franchise history. On January 25 in a 91–108 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers, James passed team legend Kobe Bryant for third on the all-time regular-season scoring list, the day before Bryant's death in a helicopter crash.\n\nIn early March, James led Los Angeles to a victory over the Milwaukee Bucks in a matchup of conference leaders, followed by a streak-breaking win against the Los Angeles Clippers, before the season was suspended due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. With play set to resume in the confined NBA Bubble, he referred to the situation as a prison sentence. Regular season play resumed in July and concluded in August within the confined NBA Bubble, where James ended the season as the league leader in assists for the first time in his career after averaging 10.2 assists per game. James earned a record 16th All-NBA Team selection as part of the First Team, extending his record First Team selections to 13.\n\nThe Lakers entered the playoffs as the number one seed in the West and advanced to the Finals convincingly, with only three total losses along the way. In Game 5 of the Conference Finals against the Denver Nuggets, James helped clinch the conference championship by scoring a game-high 38 points, including 16 in the fourth quarter. In the Finals, James and his teammates found themselves matched up with his former team, the Miami Heat, and quickly took control of the series with a 2–0 lead. In Game 5, James had his best statistical performance of the Finals with 40 points, 13 rebounds, and 7 assists in a memorable duel with Miami's Jimmy Butler, but Los Angeles was ultimately defeated in a three-point game. The Lakers finally eliminated the Heat in Game 6, which earned James, who averaged 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds, and 8.5 assists per game during the series, his fourth NBA championship and fourth Finals MVP Award. At 35 years and 287 days old, James became the second-oldest player in NBA history to win the award behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who was 38 years and 54 days old when he won his last Finals MVP Award back in 1985. He also became the first player in NBA history to win the award on three different teams. James and teammate Danny Green also became the third and fourth players in NBA history to win at least one championship with three different teams each.\n\n2020–21 NBA season: Back–to–back title chase, injury woes, play–in appearance, and early playoff exit\n\nThe 2020–21 season, reduced to 72 games for each team and starting on December 22, 2020, due to the COVID–19 pandemic, began after the shortest offseason in NBA history with a 109–116 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. On December 31, 2020, James became the first player in NBA history to score 10 points or more in 1,000 consecutive games in a 121–107 win against the San Antonio Spurs. On February 13, 2021, James recorded 28 points, 9 rebounds, and 8 assists in a 115–105 win, the Lakers' seventh consecutive victory, over the Grizzlies. In a 109–98 loss to the Nets on February 18, James became the third player in NBA history with 35,000 career points, joining Hall of Famers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone; at 36 years and 50 days, he was the youngest player to reach the milestone. On March 20, 2021, James sprained his ankle against the Hawks in a 94–99 loss, but was able to hit a three-point shot afterwards to keep his 10-points streak alive before exiting the game. By March, the Lakers were No. 2, two games behind the top-seeded Utah Jazz, but then went 14–16 without Davis and 6–10 without James, falling to No. 5. James returned on April 30, 2021 in a 110-106 loss to the Sacramento Kings, after missing 20 games, the longest absence of his career.\n\nIn May, James was sidelined again after leaving a game against the Raptors, but returned for the final two games to finish with averages of 25.0 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 7.8 assists on 51.3% shooting in 45 out of 72 games; this was his 17th consecutive season averaging at least 25 points per game, the most in NBA history. In an injury-laden season, the Lakers ended with a 42–30 record, finishing No. 7 due to tiebreakers and facing the No. 8-seed Warriors in the Play–In Tournament. The Lakers won 103–100 after James scored the go-ahead, three-point shot over Stephen Curry in the final minute, posting a triple-double with 22 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists, along with 2 steals and 1 block. His 34–foot (10 m) shot before the shot clock buzzer was his longest basket of the season as well as his longest go-ahead shot in the closing three minutes of a game in his career.\n\nIn the first round of the playoffs, the Lakers faced the No. 2 Phoenix Suns, the first time in James's career that he did not have home court advantage in the opening series. The Lakers were up 2–1 in the series before Davis suffered a strained groin in Game 4, in which James finished with a game-high 25 points on 10–for–21 shooting, 12 rebounds, and 6 assists. The Lakers would then drop the next three games (all double digit losses), ultimately losing to the Suns in six games, marking the end of their title defense and season. It also marked it the first time that James lost in the first round playoffs in his career. James finished the series averaging 23.3 points, his fourth-lowest scoring output for a series over his career and his lowest mark since averaging 22.8 in the 2014 Eastern Conference Finals against the Indiana Pacers. He made his 17th consecutive All-NBA Team selection, extending the record for most selections in NBA history, being named for the third time to the All-NBA Second Team.\n\n2021–2022: First in the 10K–10K–10K club, 37,000 points, 10,000 rebounds, and 10,000 assists, more injury woes, and play–in/playoff miss\n\nFor the 2021–22 season, James was joined by 2003 fellow draftee Carmelo Anthony and Russell Westbrook. In a game against the Detroit Pistons on November 21, 2021, James was ejected for the second time in his career in the third quarter after getting into a scuffle with Isaiah Stewart during the 121-116 win. The next day, it was announced that James would be suspended one game for his actions during the 100-106 loss against the New York Knicks. On November 26, 2021, James was fined $15,000 for an obscene gesture that he made on November 24 after making a shot late in the Lakers' overtime victory against the Pacers at their homecourt in which the Lakers won 124-116. He was also warned by the NBA for using profane language during an interview with ESPN after the victory against the Pacers when discussing his previous suspension. In his next 16 games, James averaged 30.4 points, 8.9 rebounds, 6.3 assists, 1.6 steals, and 1.4 blocks on 54 percent shooting, also achieving his 100th triple-double, while becoming the third player in NBA history to surpass 36,000 career points; during this period, he played 35 percent of his minutes at Center. From December 19 to February 26, 2022, playing 23 out of 27 games, he had a streak of 23 consecutive 25-point games.\n\nIn December, James became the second player in NBA history (after Michael Jordan) to post 40 points and zero turnovers at age 35 or older. In January, James met the minimum criteria for points per game by playing at least 70 percent of his team's games, averaging 28.6 points, and became the oldest player to average 25+ points per game, having already been the youngest to do so, as he averaged 27.6 points per game in his sophomore season at 20 years old. He also became the oldest player in NBA history to record at least 25 points in ten straight games, doing so at 37 years old. By January 20, James became the fifth player in NBA history to record at least 30,000 career points and 10,000 career rebounds; he is the first player to record at least 30,000 career points, 10,000 career rebounds, and 9,000 career assists. In the same period, he surpassed Oscar Robertson for 4th all-time free throws made, and Alvin Robertson for 10th all-time in career steals. On February 12, in a 115–117 loss to the Golden State Warriors, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the most points scored in both the regular season and playoffs combined. He received praise from Lakers head coach Frank Vogel as well as opponents Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Warriors head coach Steve Kerr. On March 19 in a 119–127 loss to the Washington Wizards, he passed Karl Malone for second in the all-time minutes and regular season scoring lists. At the 2022 NBA All-Star Game held in Cleveland, James was celebrated among the other 75 players for the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. James led all players in fan votes with his 18th All-Star selection, tying Kobe Bryant and just one behind Abdul-Jabbar; his team achieved its fifth consecutive All-Star win, defeating Team Durant 163–161, with James hitting the game-winning dagger shot over Zach LaVine and Joel Embiid in front of his hometown crowd.\n\nIn March, James recorded two 50-point games, which were also his Lakers' career-high, becoming the oldest player to have multiple 50-point games in a season, as well as the first Lakers player since Bryant in 2008 to have back-to-back 50-point home games; it was James's 15th 50-point game in his 19-year career, including the postseason. He also recorded his 10,000th career assist, becoming the only player in NBA history to record at least 10,000 points, 10,000 rebounds, and 10,000 assists. On March 27, in a 108–116 loss to the New Orleans Pelicans, LeBron became just the second player in NBA history to score 37,000 points. Due to an ankle injury in that game, James missed out on a close three-players run for the NBA scoring title, having only played 56 games, two less than the necessary to qualify; aged 37, he would have broken Jordan's record of oldest scoring leader at 35. For The Athletic, Bill Oram wrote that James's ankle injury felt like \"the moment that might signal the end of the Lakers season\". On April 5, the Lakers were eliminated from both playoff and play-in contention for the first time since 2019 (James's first season with the Lakers) after a 121–110 loss to the Phoenix Suns. It marked the fourth time in James's career and second time in four seasons as a Laker that he missed the playoffs. James was ruled out the rest of the season due to soreness in his left ankle. He finished the season with a 7.6 box plus–minus (first among players in his age group) and averages of 30.3 points (first by 6.9 points among players in his age range), 8.2 rebounds, 6.2 assists, 2.9 threes, 1.3 steals, and 1.1 blocks per game on 52–35–75 shooting ranges. On May 24, he was named to the All-NBA Third Team for the second time; it was his 18th consecutive All-NBA Team selection, extending the record for most selections in NBA history.\n\n2022–2023: Continued injury woes, climb to the all-time scoring record, second play–in appearance, and return to Conference Finals\n\nOn August 18, 2022, James re-signed with the Los Angeles Lakers on a two-year, $97.1M deal. The contract extension made James the highest-paid athlete in NBA history at $528.9M, surpassing Kevin Durant in all-time earnings. On October 20, James made his 2,144th three-pointer in a game against the Los Angeles Clippers in a 97–103 loss, surpassing Paul Pierce for tenth in total NBA career three-pointers made.

The next game, on his 38th birthday, James had a then season-high 47 points on 18-for-27 shooting from the field, along with 10 rebounds and 9 assists in a 130–121 come-from-behind victory over the Atlanta Hawks. On January 2, 2023, James recorded 43 points, 11 rebounds and 6 assists in a 121–115 win over the Charlotte Hornets. He joined Michael Jordan as the only two players with back-to-back 40-point games at 38 years of age or older. On January 9, James received his 66th Player of the Week Award, doubling the career total of runner-up Kobe Bryant. On January 13, in a 113–112 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers, he scored his 38,000th career point, becoming the second player in NBA history to do so. On January 16, James had a season–high 48 points, eight rebounds, and nine assists in a 140–132 win over the Houston Rockets. It was his 100th career game with 40 or more points – including the postseason. On January 23, he scored 46 points, including a career-high nine 3-pointers, in a 133–115 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers, becoming the first player in NBA history to score at least 40 points in a game against all NBA franchises. Two days later, James made his 2,222nd three-pointer in a 113–104 win over the San Antonio Spurs, surpassing Jamal Crawford for ninth in total NBA career three-pointers made. On January 19, James was named as a starter at the 2023 NBA All-Star Game, tying Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's record for the most All-Star selections (19). It was also James's 19th consecutive All-Star appearance, surpassing Bryant's previous mark. On January 31, James put up a triple-double with 28 points, 10 rebounds, and 11 assists in a 129–123 overtime win over the New York Knicks, becoming the first player in NBA history to put up a triple-double in his 20th season. He also surpassed Mark Jackson and Steve Nash for fourth on the NBA all-time career assists list.\n\nOn February 7, James scored his 38,388th career point in a 133–130 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder, surpassing Abdul-Jabbar, the record-holder for almost 39 years, to become the all-time leading scorer in NBA history. Abdul-Jabbar had previously set the record on April 5, 1984, eight months before James was born. After James broke the record, the NBA stopped the game for an on-court ceremony, where he gave a speech and then embraced Abdul-Jabbar, as well as his family. James missed the following three games due to left ankle soreness.\n\nOn February 19, when Team LeBron lost the 2023 NBA All-Star Game 184–175 to Team Giannis, captained by Giannis Antetokounmpo, marking the first time that LeBron lost an All-Star Game as a captain. Prior to the game, he had been undefeated (5–0) as a captain, and since the format was changed in 2018. During the game, he suffered a right hand contusion and was ruled out for the entire second half. He ended the game with 13 points, 4 assists, and one rebound.\n\nOn February 26, James sustained a right foot injury during a game against the Dallas Mavericks after bumping into Dwight Powell. Despite the injury, James was able to finish the game and helped the Lakers pull off the then-biggest comeback victory of the season winning 111-108 after trailing by 27 points late in the first half. He scored 26 points on 10–for–23 shooting, eight rebounds, and three assists in 37 minutes. However, following an examination by team medical staff on March 2, James was diagnosed with a tendon injury in his right foot and would be reevaluated in three weeks. After missing the previous 13 games, James made his return on March 26 in a 118-108 loss against the Chicago Bulls. He came off the bench for just the second time in his career; the other being on December 11, 2007 with the Cavaliers in a 118-105 win over the Indiana Pacers. On April 2, James put up a triple-double with 18 points, 10 rebounds, and 11 assists in a 134–109 win over the Houston Rockets. He also tied Jason Kidd for fourth place on the all-time career triple-doubles list. On April 4, James put up 37 points, five rebounds, six assists, one steal, one block, and a game–winning layup in a 135–133 overtime win over the Utah Jazz. On April 9, in the final game of the 2022–23 season, James posted 36 points, six rebounds, and six assists to lead the Lakers to a 128–117 win over the Jazz, earning the seventh seed in the Western Conference play–in tournament with a 43–39 record. James finished the regular season with averages of 28.9 points per game, 8.3 rebounds per game, 6.8 assists per game, becoming the oldest player in NBA history to average at least 25 points, five rebounds, and five assists in a season. In Game 4 of the Lakers' first–round series against the Memphis Grizzlies, James had 22 points, a playoff career–high 20 rebounds, and seven assists, including a game–winning layup over Dillon Brooks in a 117–111 overtime win, marking his first 20–20 game of his career. He became the first Laker player with a 20-20 game in the postseason since Shaquille O'Neal in Game 4 of the 2004 NBA Finals and also the oldest player in league history with at least 20 points and 20 rebounds in a playoff game. In Game 6 of the Semifinals, James put up 30 points, nine rebounds, nine assists, two steals, and one block in a 122–101 win over the defending champion Golden State Warriors to lead the Lakers to the Conference Finals, their second Conference Finals appearance in four seasons and James' 12th. He also won his 41st playoff series, surpassing Derek Fisher for the most all-time playoff series wins in NBA history. In the Conference Finals, the Lakers eventually lost the series to the top-seeded Denver Nuggets in a four-game sweep, despite James' 40-point, 9-rebound, and 10-assist outing in the 113–111 close-out loss in Game 4. He also set his personal playoff record with 31 points in the first half.\n\n2023–2024: NBA Cup MVP, All-Star record, 39K/40K points, and second first-round exit\n\nEntering the 2023–24 season, James was the oldest player in the league, following the retirements of former Heat teammate Udonis Haslem and Andre Iguodala. In the season opener against the defending champion Nuggets, James put up 21 points, eight rebounds, and five assists in a 119–107 loss. On November 1, James put up 35 points in a 130–125 overtime win over the Los Angeles Clippers. His 35 points were his 81st 30-point game since turning 35, surpassing Karl Malone for the most 30-point games by any player since turning 35 in NBA history. On November 15, he logged 28 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists in a 125–110 loss to the Sacramento Kings. He became the second-oldest player to have recorded a triple-double. He also moved up to the 5th and 8th places (passing Jason Kidd and Jason Terry, respectively) in the all-time triple-doubles and three-pointers lists, respectively. On November 19, James scored a season-high 37 points in a 105–104 win against the Houston Rockets. He also tied Vince Carter for seventh on the All-Time 3-pointers list with 2,290, and moved past Clyde Drexler for eighth on the all-time steals list at 2,208.\n\nOn November 21, in a 131–99 blowout victory against the Utah Jazz, he became the first player in league history to reach 39,000 career points. He also broke a tie with Vince Carter, and moved to the 7th place in the league's all-time three-pointers made list. On November 27, in a 138–94 blowout loss to the Philadelphia 76ers, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's record of 66,300 minutes to become the player with the most minutes played in NBA games during the regular season and playoffs. The Lakers' 44-point loss was also the worst loss of LeBron's career. On December 9, James and the Lakers won the inaugural NBA In-Season Tournament with a 123–109 victory over the Pacers, with James receiving the Tournament MVP Award and being selected to the All-Tournament Team.\n\nOn January 25, 2024, James was named an All-Star starter for the 2024 NBA All-Star Game, marking his 20th NBA All-Star selection, surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the most All-Star selections in NBA history. On January 27, James put up a triple-double with 36 points, a career-high 20 rebounds, and 12 assists, including a pair of game-winning free throws, in a 145–144 double overtime win against the Golden State Warriors, becoming the first player in Lakers franchise history since Abdul-Jabbar in 1976 to put up at least 30 points, 20 rebounds, and 10 assists in a game. On February 28, James spearheaded a 21-point fourth-quarter comeback by the Lakers to beat the Clippers 116–112, marking the largest fourth-quarter comeback of James' career and the Lakers' biggest comeback since 2003. He outscored the Clippers by himself 19–16 in the final quarter, going 5-for-8 from three-point range and dishing out four assists. On March 2, James became the first player in NBA history to reach 40,000 career points in a 124–114 loss to the Nuggets. On March 16, James scored a season-high 40 points on 15-of-23 shooting with eight rebounds and nine assists in a 128–121 loss to the Warriors. On March 31, James put up 40 points on a career-high nine three-pointers made along with seven rebounds and five assists in a 116–104 win over the Brooklyn Nets. He also surpassed Michael Jordan for the most 30-point games (across the regular season and playoffs) in NBA history with 672. On April 9 and 12, James put up 33 and 37 points respectively; and in the season finale on April 14 against the New Orleans Pelicans, James scored 28 points, brought down 11 rebounds, and his 17 assists pushed his career total over the 11k mark.\n\nJames finished his 21st season in the NBA averaging 25.7 points, 8.3 assists, and 7.3 rebounds a game. He also shot 54% from the field and a career-high 41.0% from 3-point range, making him the first player to average over 25 points and eight assists while shooting at least 50% overall and 40% from beyond the arc for an entire season. On the road against the Pelicans in the play-in game, James had 23 points, nine rebounds, and nine assists to win 110–106 and clinch his 17th career playoff appearance. After the Lakers fell into a 3–0 series deficit in the first round against the Denver Nuggets, James scored 14 of his 30 points in the fourth quarter in Game 4 as the Lakers won 119–108 to stave off elimination. In the process, James recorded his 19th career 30-point game when facing elimination and improved to 15–12 in 27 career elimination games. The Lakers lost the series in five games, despite James's 30-point and 11-rebound outing in a 108–106 closeout loss in Game 5; this marked the second time that James was eliminated in the first round.\n\nInternational career\n\nJames made his debut for the United States national team at the 2004 Olympics in Athens.[157] U.S. Olympic coach Larry Brown said that James, accustomed to being a star, was not 100% receptive to a reduced role.[158] James spent the Olympics mostly on the bench without quality playing time,[159][160] averaging 14.6 minutes per game with 5.8 points and 2.6 rebounds per game in eight games.[157] Team USA finished the competition with a bronze medal, becoming the first U.S. basketball team to return home without a gold medal since adding professionals to their line-up.[157][161] James felt his limited playing time was a \"lowlight\" and believed he was not given \"a fair opportunity to play\".[162] His attitude during the Olympics was described as \"disrespectful\" and \"distasteful\" by columnists Adrian Wojnarowski and Peter Vecsey, respectively.[163][164]At the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan, James took on a greater role for Team USA, averaging 13.9 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game as co-captain.[165][166] The team finished the tournament with an 8–1 record, winning another bronze medal.[165] James' behavior was again questioned, this time by teammate Bruce Bowen, who confronted James during tryouts regarding his treatment of staff members.[163][167] Before naming James to the 2008 Olympic team, Team USA managing director Jerry Colangelo and coach Mike Krzyzewski gave James an ultimatum to improve his attitude, and he heeded their advice.[163][168] At the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship, he averaged 18.1 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 4.7 assists per game, including a 31-point performance against Argentina in the championship game, the most ever by an American in an Olympic qualifier.[169][170] Team USA went 10–0, winning the gold medal and qualifying for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.[157] James credited the team's attitude and experience for their improvement, saying: \"I don't think we understood what it meant to put on a USA uniform and all the people that we were representing in 2004. We definitely know that now.\"[160] At the Olympics, Team USA went unbeaten, winning their first gold medal since 2000.[171]In the final game, James turned in 14 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 assists against Spain.[171]\n\nJames did not play at the 2010 FIBA World Championship, but rejoined Team USA for the 2012 Olympics in London.[172][173] He became the leader of the team with Kobe Bryant, who would soon be 34, stepping back.[174][175][176] James facilitated the offense from the post and perimeter, called the defensive sets, and provided scoring when needed.[103][177][178][179] During a game against Australia, he recorded the first triple-double in U.S. Olympic basketball history with 11 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assist.[a] Team USA went on to win their second straight gold medal, again defeating Spain in the final game.[181] James contributed 19 points in the win, becoming the all-time leading scorer in U.S. men's basketball history.[157][181] He also joined Michael Jordan as the only players to win an NBA MVP award, NBA championship, and Olympic gold medal in the same year.[182] Afterwards, Krzyzewski said James \"is the best player, he is the best leader and he is as smart as anybody playing the game right now.\"[183]\n\nPlayer profile\n\nStanding at six feet, nine inches tall and weighing in at 250 pounds, James has been called the best physical specimen in sports by some sports analysts.[184][185] He has started at Small Forward and Power Forward, but can also play the other three positions.[142] With career averages of 27.6 points, 7.3 rebounds, 6.9 assists, and 1.7 steals per game,[46] he is considered one of the most versatile players in the NBA,[129] and has been compared to Hall of Famers like Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, and Oscar Robertson.[36][186] Through the 2021–22 season, James's career averages are 27.1 points, 7.5 rebounds, 7.4 assists, 1.6 steals, and 0.8 blocks per game. Throughout the 2010s, he was usually ranked as the best player in the NBA each season by ESPN and Sports Illustrated.\n\nOffense\n\nAs an 18-year-old rookie, James led the Cavaliers in scoring. He holds numerous \"youngest to\" distinctions, including being the youngest player to score 30,000 career points. During his first stint in Cleveland, James was used as an on-ball Point Forward.[129] Although his shooting tendencies were perimeter-oriented,[129] he established himself as one of the best slashers and finishers in basketball, leading the NBA in three point plays in 2006.[193] His combination of speed, quickness, and size often created matchup problems for opposing teams because he was capable of blowing by larger defenders and overpowering smaller ones. These qualities became more apparent in transition, where he developed a reputation for grabbing defensive rebounds and then beating the defense downcourt for highlight reel baskets. Around this time, he was frequently criticized for not having developed a reliable jump shot or post game.[194] Teams would try to exploit these weaknesses by giving him space in the half court and forcing him to settle for three-pointers and long two-pointers, a strategy famously used by Spurs coach Gregg Popovich in the 2007 Finals, where James converted on only 36 percent of his field goals in four games.\n\nIn Miami, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra changed James' role to a more unconventional one.[129] James began spending more time in the post and shooting fewer three pointers, attempting a career-low 149 in 2012.[46][129] He improved his shot selection and accuracy on jump shots, finishing second in the league in catch-and-shoot field goal percentage in 2013.[195] He also learned how to work as an off-ball cutter in the Heat's \"pass-happy\" offense.[196] Behind these improvements, James's overall scoring efficiency rose to historically great levels. During this time, ESPN's Tom Haberstroh called James's free-throw shooting his biggest weakness, describing it as \"average\". Upon returning to the Cavaliers, James began to experience subtle age-related declines in productivity, posting his lowest scoring averages since his rookie season in the 2014–15 and 2015–16 seasons (as well as in the 2019–20 and 2020–21 seasons with the Lakers). His shooting also temporarily regressed, and he briefly ranked as the NBA's worst high-volume shooter from outside the paint. Despite these changes, he remained an elite offensive player who beat defenses with body control, strength, and varying attacking speeds.\n\nThroughout his career, James has controlled the offense as the primary ball handler on his team. His playmaking ability has been praised; in one article, writer Rob Mahoney described him as a \"fantastic passer\".[197] His playmaking ability is generally considered one of his premier skills, and some analysts rank him among the greatest passers in NBA history. By using his size, vision, and the attention that he garners from opposing defenses to his advantage,[198] James is able to create easy points for his teammates with accurate assists, manufacturing a league leading 2.6 three pointers per game by way of his passing alone in 2013.[197]\n\nHe executes unconventional passes, including after leaving his feet and through defensive traffic. His uncanny tendency to find the open man has helped force NBA teams to incorporate some elements of zone into their schemes to better cover the weak side of the court and prevent James from passing to open shooters. James's clutch play has been the subject of much scrutiny throughout his career (especially early). He has been repeatedly criticized by the media for his play in pressure situations; specifically, for overpassing instead of shooting in the waning seconds of close games.[203][204] However, as his career progressed, James's clutch performance was viewed more favorably. In a 2011 interview, teammate Chris Bosh stated that he would rather have Dwyane Wade take a last-second shot than James.[205] On the other hand, a 2011 article by Henry Abbott revealed that James had a better shooting percentage with the game on the line than such notables as Ray Allen and Kobe Bryant.[206]Additionally, a 2012 feature by ESPN ranked three of James' playoff performances as some of the greatest in NBA history.[60]\n\nDefense\n\nAt the beginning of James' NBA career, he was considered a poor defensive player,[199] but he improved steadily through the years. Near the end of his first tenure in Cleveland in 2009, he became proficient at the chase-down block; coming in from behind the opposition in transition to block their shot and finished second in Defensive Player of the Year voting.[71] In Miami, he developed into a more versatile defender, and the Heat relied on him to guard all five positions.[200] This allowed him to make several All-Defensive Selections and come second in Defensive Player of the Year voting in 2013. Paired with teammates Dwyane Wade and Shane Battier, Miami used James in an ultra-aggressive defensive scheme,[201] with James cheating off the ball to help out inside or get into rebounding position.[202]\n\nBeginning in 2014, some analysts have noted a regression in James' defensive impact, stemming from a lack of effort and expected age-related declines. During his second stint in Cleveland, his defense progressively declined. After missed drives on offense, he often dawdled back on defense while complaining to the referees; he provided less help off the ball, and was less aggressive in switching. James himself admitted to taking plays off at times, referring to this approach as \"chill mode\". He eventually developed a reputation for raising his defensive level in the playoffs, which some analysts referred to as \"Playoff LeBron\".\n\nLegacy\n\nJames left high school as one of the most hyped prospects in NBA history. Upon entering the NBA, he made an immediate impact and was voted Rookie of the Year in his debut season. As of May 2023, he has been named to 19 All-NBA Teams, including 13 times to the First Team, which are both NBA records.[46] With four MVP Awards, he is part of a select group of players who have won the award four times, including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill Russell; James and Russell are the only players to win four MVP awards in a five-year span.[187] James is one of the only three players to have won a championship, Finals MVP Award, and MVP Award in the same season multiple times. James has also won four Finals MVP Awards, which is the second-most all-time, and earned All-Defensive honors every season from 2009 to 2014.[188] While he has never won the Defensive Player of the Year Award, he has finished second in the voting twice and lists it as one of his main goals.[72][189] His teams have appeared in the Finals ten times and won four championships; his ten Finals appearances are tied for third all-time. Some analysts have criticized him for not having a better Finals record, while others have defended him, arguing that James usually performed well, but his teams were mostly defeated by better competition. From 2010 to 2020, he has been ranked the best player in the NBA by ESPN's #NBArank project.[190][191][192]\n\nOn the basis of his career longevity and on-court performances, sports publications have consistently included James in rankings of the best basketball players in history, and he was named the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Decade for the 2010s. In addition to praising James's on-court accomplishments, analysts have also noted James's influence on player empowerment throughout the NBA, which stemmed from his willingness to change teams during free agency. Ben Golliver of The Washington Post opined that James's move to the Heat in 2010 \"defined a decade of player movement\", and that he \"fundamentally flipped the power balance between stars and their organizations.\" James's fellow players have also remarked on his influence, such as Warriors Forward Draymond Green, who reflected: \"We've taken control of our destiny. And I think a lot of people hate that ... . I think the doors that he's opened for athletes and especially basketball players is his biggest accomplishment.\"\n\nJames is widely considered to be one of the greatest basketball players of all-time. In February 2016, he was ranked fifth by Sports Illustrated; in March 2016, he was ranked third by ESPN; in February 2017, he was ranked second by CBS Sports; in December 2017, he was ranked second by Fox Sports; and in February 2018, he was ranked second by Slam Magazine. He is sometimes mentioned as the greatest player ever, which has resulted in frequent comparisons to Michael Jordan. In a 2016 interview with Sports Illustrated, James acknowledged that his motivation was surpassing Jordan as the greatest. In February 2018, Bill Simmons' website, The Ringer, spent an entire week devoted to both players, with Simmons ultimately concluding that Jordan was still ahead. Coaches and players have also debated James's status, such as Steve Kerr, who posited that James and Jordan are the two best players in history. In polls, James has ranked second behind Jordan. The results strongly correlate with age, with older voters more commonly choosing Jordan. Davis et al. of Business Insider stated: \"The data would suggest that younger, more-engaged NBA fans lean toward James, as he's still playing. Older generations who watched Jordan play and tune in less today lean toward Jordan.\" Referring to James as the best challenger to Jordan's status as the greatest basketball player of all time, Sam Quinn of CBS Sports stated that \"the margin for error where Jordan is involved is overwhelmingly slim\" and that \"in the rings-obsessed basketball discourse\", Jordan having more titles and an \"unblemished Finals record holds significant weight\". In 2022, to commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary, The Athletic ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named James as the second greatest player in NBA history, behind only Jordan, but stated that \"Jordan can feel James' breath on the back of his neck.\"\n\nJames is considered one of United States men's national basketball teams best players winning two Gold medals.\n\nJames has voiced his desire to play basketball into his forties, potentially alongside or against his sons Bronny and Bryce.\n\nOff the court\n\nPersonal life\n\nJames has three children with his high school sweetheart, Savannah Brinson on September 14, 2013, in San Diego, California.[60] The first, LeBron James, Jr., was born on October 6, 2004, the second, Bryce Maximus James, born on June 14, 2007, and the third, Zhuri Nova James, born on October 22, 2014.[207] Bronny was named a McDonald's All-American in 2023, 20 years after James's selection. During his stint with the Heat, James resided in Coconut Grove, where he bought a $9 million three-story mansion overlooking Biscayne Bay. In November 2015, James bought a 9,350 square-foot (870 m2) East Coast-style mansion in Brentwood, Los Angeles for about $21 million. James owns another home in Brentwood, which he purchased for $23 million in December 2017.[208] James became engaged to Brinson on December 31, 2011, proposing to her at a party to celebrate New Year's Eve and his 27th birthday.[209]\n\nHealth\n\nJames invests heavily in his health, reportedly having spent $1.5 million a year to pay for personal chefs and athletic trainers, as well as physical therapies of recovery. He has a heavy exercise regimen and dietary habits that some consider atypical for a top athlete. Tristan Thompson has stated that James eats desserts with every meal, and Kyle Korver says James's that fitness routine is unrivaled. However, James's routine is not perfectly clean; he drinks wine every night, believing it to be good for his heart, while Tristan Thompson has stated that James eats desserts with every meal.\n\nIn January 2009, doctors at the Cleveland Clinic discovered a growth in the right side of James's jaw. Biopsy results showed that James developed a benign jaw tumor, specifically in his parotid gland, which required a five-hour surgery to remove on June 2 after the end of the Cavaliers' run in the 2009 Playoffs. During the COVID-19 pandemic, James received a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nPublic image\n\nJames is considered by many people, including his fellow NBA players, media tabloids, and popular culture, to be the \"face of the NBA\" often alongside Warriors superstar Stephen Curry. His opinions have yielded significant influence on people who make important league decisions; for example in 2014, he asked commissioner Adam Silver to increase the duration of the All-Star break, and the request was granted the following season. On February 13, 2015, James was elected the first vice president of the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA).\n\nThroughout his career, James has been ranked by Forbes as one of the world's most influential athletes. In 2010, James was ranked as the second most influential athlete behind Lance Armstrong,[228] and in 2017, he was listed by Time as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. During his first stint with the Cavaliers, he was adored by local fans, with Sherwin-Williams displaying a giant Nike-produced banner of James on their world headquarters throughout his tenure with the team.[229] Despite their affection for James, Cleveland fans and critics were frequently annoyed when he attended Cleveland Indians baseball games against the New York Yankees dressed in a Yankees hat.[230] Following his actions during the 2010 free agency period and, more specifically, The Decision, he has been listed as one of the most disliked athletes in the United States.[231][232] By 2013, his image had mostly recovered and he was reported by ESPN as the most popular player in the NBA for the second time in his career. In 2014, he was named the most popular male athlete in America by the Harris Poll. He has led the league in jersey sales six times.\n\nMemorabilia associated with James is highly sought after; two of James's rookie cards are among the most expensive basketball cards ever sold at auction, and one of those cards also briefly held the record for the most expensive modern-day sports card when it sold for $1.8 million at auction in July 2020. A Mike Trout rookie card broke the record for a modern-day card the following month. All jerseys worn in the 2020 NBA All-Star Game were auctioned by the NBA and NBPA to raise funds for charity; James's jersey sold for $630,000, setting a record for a modern-day sports jersey.\n\nIn March 2008, James became the first black man—and third man overall after Richard Gere and George Clooney—to appear on the cover of Vogue, posing with Gisele Bündchen.[238] Some sports bloggers and columnists considered the cover offensive and \"memorable for the wrong reasons\", describing the demeanor of James and his holding Bündchen as a reference to classic imagery of the movie monster King Kong, a dark savage capturing his light-skinned love interest.[236][237]\n\nActivism\n\nCharities\n\nJames has maintained close ties to his hometown of Akron, Ohio, which is also where his charity foundation, the LeBron James Family Foundation (LJFF), is based. While James has largely avoided political issues, he drew criticism in 2007 when he declined to sign a petition started by his Cavaliers teammate Ira Newble regarding the Chinese government's alleged involvement in the ongoing conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan, stating that he did not know enough about the issue.[239][240] A year later, James did talk publicly about the issue, saying, \"At the end of the day we're talking about human rights. And people should understand that human rights and people's lives are in jeopardy. We're not talking about contracts here. We're not talking about money. We're talking about people's lives being lost and that means a lot more to me than some money or a contract.\"[241][242] Since 2005, the foundation has held an annual bike-a-thon in Akron to raise money for various causes. In 2015, James announced a partnership with the University of Akron to provide scholarships for as many as 2,300 children beginning in 2021. In 2017, he received the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award from the NBA for his \"outstanding service and dedication to the community.\"\n\nIn November of that same year, the Akron School Board approved the I Promise School, a public elementary school created in a partnership with the LeBron James Family Foundation to help struggling elementary school students stay in school. James later reflected that it was his most important professional accomplishment of his life. The school officially opened on July 30, 2018.\n\nA philanthropist, James is also an active supporter of non-profit organizations, including After-School All-Stars, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, Children's Defense Fund, and ONEXONE.[233] He has also established his own charity foundation called the LeBron James Family Foundation (LJFF), based out of Akron.[234] In 2016, he donated $2.5 million to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture to support an exhibit on Muhammad Ali.\n\nPolitics\n\nThroughout his career, James has taken stances on controversial issues. On several occasions, he mentioned a feeling of obligation to effect change using his status. Those include the War in Darfur, the killing of Trayvon Martin, the now-former NBA owner Donald Sterling's racist comments in 2014, the Michael Brown verdict, the death of Eric Garner, the U.S. national anthem kneeling protests, the shooting of Breonna Taylor, the death of Ma'Khia Bryant, Kyle Rittenhouse, and the ruling of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization that overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. James has supported Colin Kaepernick in the aftermath of his participation in the U.S. national anthem kneeling protests, saying that he was being blackballed from a new contract in the National Football League and he would hire him if he owned a football team. He has worn his clothing in a show of support several times.\n\nOn August 27, 2020, James and his Lakers teammates, as well as the Milwaukee Bucks, began boycotting the 2020 NBA Playoffs to protest the shooting of Jacob Blake. In response, senior White House advisor Jared Kushner stated that he was planning to reach out to James regarding the boycott. Following a players' committee to discuss the boycott, James and others reached out to former President Barack Obama, who reportedly advised them to continue playing and finish that year's NBA season.\n\nDuring the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, a statement James made about a since-deleted tweet by Daryl Morey, in which Morey expressed support for the anti-China movement in Hong Kong, became the subject of controversy. James said Morey was \"misinformed\". His statement racist backlash from protesters in the movement (some of whom called him slurs like \"Orangutan\" on internet forums) and in February 2022, right wing political commentator Bill Maher called James \"hypocritical\" for not taking a critical stance towards the Chinese government's human rights abuses. James has taken various other stands on issues regarding sports, such as the Kaepernick controversy and the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal.\n\nIn August 2020, James wore a modified MAGA hat that called for the arrest of the police officers involved in the shooting of Breonna Taylor. On August 19, 2020, he announced his intentions to support the Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign and that of his running-mate Kamala Harris in advance of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. James spoke in support of the More Than a Vote movement and encouraged members of the African-American community to vote. He said: \"People in our community have been just lied to for so many years. We have people that have had convictions in the past, that've been told they cannot vote because they got a conviction. That is voter suppression.\"\n\nOn April 21, 2021, in response to the death of Ma'Khia Bryant, James took to Twitter and posted a picture of the police officer who is believed to have fatally shot Bryant, saying: \"YOU'RE NEXT #ACCOUNTABILITY.\" He later deleted the post, explaining: \"I'm so damn tired of seeing Black people killed by police. I took the tweet down because its being used to create more hate -This isn't about one officer. it's about the entire system and they always use our words to create more racism. I am so desperate for more ACCOUNTABILITY.\"\n\nOn November 10, 2021, in response to Kyle Rittenhouse having an emotional break down in court, James tweeted \"What tears????? I didn't see one. Man knock it off! That boy ate some lemon heads before walking into court.\" On December 6, 2021, Rittenhouse said in response that \"I was a Lakers fan too before he said that. I was really pissed off when he said that, because I liked LeBron and then I'm like, you know what f*ck you LeBron.\"\n\nIn June 2022, James condemned the ruling of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization that overturned Roe v. Wade, saying that the decision is about \"power and control\".\n\nIn October 2023, in response to the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, James voiced his support for Israel on Instagram. His statement drew backlash for its omission of the Palestinians affected by the crisis, including from Palestinian-American leader and activist Omar Suleiman.\n\nPresidential elections\n\nIn June 2008, James donated $20,000 to a committee to elect Barack Obama for the 2008 U.S. presidential election.[243] On October 29, 2008, James gathered almost 20,000 people at the Quicken Loans Arena for a viewing of Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama's 30-minute American Stories, American Solutions television advertisement.[244] It was shown on a large screen above the stage, where Jay-Z later held a free concert.[244]\n\nIn November 2016, James endorsed and campaigned for Hillary Clinton for the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nFollowing a racist incident at his Los Angeles home in 2017, James expressed that \"being black in America is tough. We got a long way to go for us as a society and for us as African Americans until we feel equal in America.\" Later on that year, in the aftermath of the Unite the Right rally, James questioned the \"Make America Great Again\" slogan and said: \"It's sad what's going on in Charlottesvi"
