        "text": "A win over the visiting Houston Rockets (108-91) back at the end of March meant that the Cleveland Cavaliers secured a top-6 spot in the NBA Eastern Conference. This achievement was a huge step forward for the side that had not qualified for the playoffs in the entire 21st century without a certain LeBron James in their side.\n\nIt was back in 1998 when the Cavs last played postseason basketball without LeBron; the last time the Cavs managed to get a win in the postseason without LeBron was way back in 1993, the year Bill Clinton was sworn into office, Czechoslovakia officially spilt into the Czech Republic and Slovakia and 90 million Americans tuned in to watch Michael Jackson Talks To Oprah Winfrey.\n\nWhen was the last time the Cavs made the playoffs?\n\nThe statistics continue to compound: prior to this season, the Cavs hadn’t made the playoffs at all since 2018 - the third-longest active drought in the league behind the Charlotte Hornets (seven seasons) and the Sacramento Kings (17 seasons).\n\n“Organizationally, this is a big deal,” Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff said upon qualification. “To come from where we came from and every year continue to take steps in the right direction and positive direction. All the hard work that people in this organization put in to help get us here should be acknowledged.”\n\nWhat is the best Cleveland Cavaliers playoff appearance without Lebron James?\n\nSince the Cavs’ establishment in 1970 until James joined in 2003, the side had only secured victory in four playoff series. However, by James’ fourth season, they managed to double that number. James’s departure in 2011 saw the team struggle, winning 97 games over the next four seasons without him.\n\nBut upon The King’s return in 2015, they soared to four consecutive Finals appearances, even clinching the championship in 2016. After James left the side for the second time, in 2018, the Cavaliers managed 104 total wins in the subsequent four seasons."
