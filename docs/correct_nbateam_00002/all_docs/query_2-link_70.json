        "text": "It quickly became clear that the American has an extraordinary talent in basketball. Already in his school days, LeBron became the most successful high school basketball player in the USA. Due to his early success, he was photographed on magazine covers such as \"SLAM Magazine\" and \"Sports Illustrated\", after which NBA experts such as Shaquille O'Neal were attracted to his high school games.\n\nIn 2003, the basketball talent was then acquired by his home NBA club Cleveland Cavaliers. In his first year, LeBron already impressed as a professional player and was named Rookie (Newcomer) of the Year. He quickly developed as a leading player and became an integral part of the American national team.\n\nIn 2007, LeBron reached the NBA Finals for the first time, with his team losing to the San Antonio Spurs. In 2009, he was named the league's Most Valuable Player for the first time.\n\nAfter the end of the contract with his home club in 2010, the star became the most sought-after basketball player in the entire NBA. In the specially broadcast television show \"The Decision\" LeBron announced that he was moving to the Miami Heat. There was much criticism of this decision.\n\nAt the Miami Heat then developed the \"Big Three\" consisting of LeBron, Cris Bosh and Dwyane Wade, who were considered the most important athletes of the team. With the same club, James won his first championship in 2012. Two years later, LeBron caused a stir with his return to the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nTogether with his home club, LeBron managed to win the NBM title again in 2016. In the same season, LeBron scored a mean of at least 25 points per game for the twelfth time in a row, setting a record.\n\nIn 2019, the professional basketball player moved to the Los Angeles Lakers. In the fall of the year, he beat his former club from Miami with this club and once again won the NBA title.\n\nIn January 2020, LeBron scored 29 points in the game against the Philadelphia 76ers, becoming the most successful player in the NBA with a total of 33,655 points.\n\nThings could hardly be better for the basketball player. According to estimates, his fortune is 415 million euros. The athlete is currently under contract with the LA Lakers, where he receives a salary of 37.44 million US dollars. All of LeBron's NBA salaries since 2003 add up to a total of just under 344 million US dollars. His annual income is at least 80 million euros.\n\nIn addition, the athlete has a lifetime advertising contract with Nike. LeBron is the first person to date to receive such a deal from the sporting goods manufacturer. Annually, he is paid millions for being a representative of the brand. In addition, the athlete has lucrative advertising contracts with numerous other brands (see Sponsors), which gave him about $ 700 million career income.\n\nThis means that in July 2021, according to the sports business website \"Sportico\", James will be the first active basketball player to break the one billion US dollar (850 million euro) career earnings mark."
