        "text": "Brian Rothmuller/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n\nThe James household has a lot of decisions to make this summer.\n\nLeBron can play out the 2024-25 season on a $51.4 million player option in Los Angeles or extend off it to create a three-year deal. He can also turn down the money and become an unrestricted free agent for the first time since 2018. Bronny is eligible to declare for the 2024 draft or transfer from USC to another university.\n\nThe dream of teaming up is alive and well, although ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reports that Bronny finding the right developmental system or organization is more of a priority than father and son playing together right now.\n\nThe following five teams would make the most sense for a Bronny and LeBron duo, offering a combination of win-now opportunity, a history of developing players, an existing connection for James and/or cap space and 2024 draft picks to make this a reality.\n\nSalary information via Spotrac.com.\n\nAndrew D. Bernsteini/NBAE via Getty Images\n\nProjected Cap Space: $27.3 million\n\n2024 Draft Pick(s): Nos. 5 (projected), 35 and 48 overall\n\nDon't be fooled by San Antonio's 22 wins or the fact that this projects to be the youngest team in the NBA next season (23.6). The Spurs have arguably the greatest coach of all time, the greatest prospect since LeBron James himself and a huge collection of draft picks moving forward.\n\nThe Spurs could pivot from a rebuild to a contender at any time. This is a team that might possess two top-10 picks depending on how the lottery shakes out, with a 10.5 percent chance at winning the No. 1 overall selection again.\n\nSan Antonio also has 22 extra picks and swaps over the next seven years without a single draft pick owed to another team. It could use these to bring in win-now help around James and Victor Wembanyama and build a title contender almost overnight.\n\nPopovich would be a huge recruiting voice to help land James, a player he's always been extremely complimentary of. There's perhaps no better coach for Bronny to learn under, especially with all of the Hall of Fame players that have developed in San Antonio over the past 27 years.\n\nThe Spurs have the capability of creating max cap space for James, trading for another star and selecting Bronny with either of their second-round picks.\n\nSet Number: SI146 TK1\n\nProjected Cap Space: None, non-taxpayer mid-level exception ($12.9 million)\n\n2024 Draft Pick(s): No. 20 overall\n\nIt's been exactly 10 years since LeBron James announced he was returning to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Bronny was just nine years old at the time, coming home to the city where he was born.\n\nWhat better place for father and son to play together?\n\nThe Cavs could use both, as even if Cleveland makes it past the Orlando Magic in the first round, this team doesn't look championship-ready. Adding LeBron to a core of Donovan Mitchell, Darius Garland, Evan Mobley, Jarrett Allen and others would certainly change that.\n\nGetting LeBron on board would make it far more likely that Mitchell signs an extension with the Cavs, a team that already has Garland (also a Klutch client) under contract until 2028.\n\nEven if Bronny needs to spend the majority of his 2024-25 season in the G League, he won't be far away. The Cleveland Charge are just a three-minute drive from Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse, giving LeBron plenty of chances to take in his son's games.\n\nThis certainly has some storybook ending potential for James' career, playing out his final few seasons in his backyard while his son begins his own career where LeBron's started.\n\nBronny used to be a regular in the Cavs locker room after games. Now, he could have his own.\n\nJesse D. Garrabrant/NBAE via Getty Images\n\nProjected Cap Space: None, taxpayer mid-level exception of $5.2 million\n\n2024 Draft Pick(s): Nos. 15 and 43 overall\n\nIgnoring finances for a minute, James going back to Miami to finish his career with the Heat (this time without the fanfare) would make a lot of sense.\n\nErik Spoelstra has grown from a rookie on the sidelines to the best coach in the NBA. LeBron has gone through eight head coaches in his 21 seasons and will likely play for a ninth if he stays with the Lakers. Joining Miami would finally mean some stability on the sideline for James.\n\nSpoelstra just signed an eight-year, $120 million contract and would see over Bronny's development long after LeBron retires. Perhaps no franchise finds and develops undrafted players and second-round picks better than Miami.\n\nThe Heat should still be in the title hunt next season with Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, Tyler Herro, Terry Rozier, Jaime Jaquez Jr., Duncan Robinson and others all under contract. Getting James to agree to turn down $50 million with the Los Angeles Lakers next year to play for just over $5 million with the Heat may be a non-starter, however.\n\nMiami could always try to dump some contracts and offer James a little bit more, but this is a team already flirting with the second tax apron. Still, if James commits, Pat Riley and company would likely find a way.\n\nJesse D. Garrabrant/NBAE via Getty Images\n\nProjected Cap Space: $55.5 million\n\n2024 Draft Pick(s): Nos. 16 and 41 overall\n\nThe 76ers are the best team that possesses max cap space this summer, making them an intriguing fit for both LeBron and Bronny.\n\nWith just four players on the roster for next season (and only one with a guaranteed contract), Bronny may end up in the starting lineup out of necessity (just kidding, we think).\n\nA trio of LeBron, Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey may be the best in the NBA if the MVP center can stay healthy. Maxey is quickly making the superstar leap in these playoffs and will almost certainly sign a five-year, max contract with the 76ers this summer.\n\nThe Sixers have already shown interest in signing Paul George to fill their vacant wing spot. LeBron would be an upgrade at the position and could slide into a second- or even third-scorer role for Philly as he approaches age 40.\n\nSelecting Bronny at pick No. 41 is well worth the price if LeBron commits to join the 76ers, and James should be thrilled to leave a loaded West and join an established contender in a far weaker conference.\n\nFilling out the roster will be tricky, but landing LeBron and Bronny would be worth the lack of depth.\n\nJim Poorten/NBAE via Getty Images\n\nProjected Cap Space: $36.5 million*\n\n2024 Draft Pick(s): Nos. 17* and 55 overall\n\nAlthough James would fit with a number of teams, no franchise needs LeBron more than the Lakers.\n\nLos Angeles is also \"very open to the prospect of helping LeBron fulfill his dream of playing with his son Bronny by potentially drafting him,\" according to The Athletic's Shams Charania, Jovan Buha and Sam Amick.\n\nThe Lakers technically have cap space if James doesn't opt in to his contract for 2024-25 and D'Angelo Russell turns down his $18.7 million contract as well. This quickly becomes a $5.2 million taxpayer mid-level exception if they return.\n\nJames can make the most money by staying in L.A. by picking up his player option and extending off it for a total of $164.3 million over the next three years. This could be his last big NBA payday, important for someone who wants to own a team someday.\n\nRe-signing LeBron, drafting Bronny and looking to acquire a third star along with Anthony Davis is the Lakers' best path this summer."
