LeBron was also the only player to win the award at 20 years old. In this season, the player averaged 20 points per game. His performance in this season placed him in the company of stars such as Michael Jordan and Oscar Robertson.\n\nLeBron James became the first African American to appear on the cover of the Vogue magazine. The magazine was published on March 1, 2008. The player could be seen on the cover with Gisele Bündchen. Not only way LeBron the first black man to appear on the cover of the Vogue, but he was also the third man overall to ever appear on the magazine’s cover. The player’s appearance on the cover was met with much criticism and controversies.\n\nOn May 4, 2009, LeBron James was named the 2009 NBA MVP. It was reported that LeBron won the award in a landslide on the same floor on which he became a star.\n\nThis was historic NBA finals. The Cavaliers came back from a 3-1 series to defeat the Golden State Warriors 93-89 in Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Championship finals. James gets a unanimous vote for MVA after the victory."
