        "text": "On Sunday evening, the2024 NBA All-Star Game will take place in Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James will become the first player to ever play in 20 All-Star Games.\n\nIn addition, James needs just three defensive rebounds to pass Hall of Famer Tim Duncan (98) for the most in All-Star Game history.\n\nThe 39-year-old has All-Star Game career averages of 22.4 points, 5.8 rebounds and 5.8 assists per contest, so he should be able to move ahead of Duncan during Sunday's game.\n\nJames is also the all-time leader in field goals (178) and points (426).\n\nDespite his age, James still remains a top-ten player in the NBA and is averaging 24.8 points, 7.2 rebounds, 7.8 assists and 1.3 steals per contest while shooting 52.0% from the field and 39.5% from the three-point range in 49 games.\n\nHe looks like he could play at this level for several more years and has been able to remain healthy for a large portion of the season (he's only missed seven games).\n\nIn addition to the Lakers, James has also spent time with the Cleveland Cavaliers (twice) and Miami Heat.\n\nHis career averages are 27.1 points, 7.5 rebounds, 7.3 assists and 1.5 steals per contest while shooting 50.5% from the field and 34.6% from the three-point range in 1,470 regular season games.\n\nHe's also appeared in 282 NBA playoff games and won four titles (two with Miami, one with Cleveland and one with Los Angeles).\n\nRight now, the Lakers are the ninth seed in the Western Conference with a 30-26 record."
