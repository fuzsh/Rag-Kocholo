        "text": "Naturally, game two of the NBA Finals had people talking, but the on-court drama between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors was not the only thing up for discussion. When LeBron James and his teammates walked into Oakland’s Oracle Arena, they did so in style thanks to their coordinating Thom Browne suits. King James set the mood by wearing Browne’s signature shorts and striped socks combination—and carrying a custom alligator version of the Mr. Thom bag—then adding a casual touch with a black hoodie beneath his tailored jacket. Clearly, James was ready for business.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of their fearless leader, the entire group got in on the act. Jordan Clarkson went for grayscale in a slate jumper with a black tie, while Tristan Thompson kept things classic with trousers cropped at the ankles, instead of shorts. Kevin Love committed to the power suit with a dark gray version, and George Hill accessorized his Browne wares with a pair of oversize headphones. Though each man put his own spin on the look, they were united by their sleek style sensibility. Athletes may be having more fun with fashion than ever before, but rarely do they make a statement as a team. Browne’s designs have served as a good luck charm for the Cavs: James, a longtime fan, has made the brand a key part of his wardrobe and brought his teammates into the fun for every away game this season."
