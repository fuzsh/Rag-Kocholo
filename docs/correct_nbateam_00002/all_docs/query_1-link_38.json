        "text": "The Lakers' superstar isn't out the door, but he is on the (odds) board.\n\nLeBron James has a player option this offseason, meaning it's up to him whether he chooses to pick up his option with the Lakers, opt out and re-sign with L.A. or opt out and enter free agency.\n\nAnd just last week, James' agent Rich Paul had this to say to Bleacher Report's Chris B. Haynes:\n\n\"I don't know what [LeBron is] gonna do. We're gonna do what we do every year. We're gonna evaluate the situation and we're gonna make the best decision.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSo where will \"The King\" take his talents next season?\n\nLet's check out the odds at DraftKings Sportsbook as of May 29.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers: -450 (bet $10 to win $12.22 total)\n\nCleveland Cavaliers: +700 (bet $10 to win $80 total)\n\nGolden State Warriors: +1200 (bet $10 to win $130 total)\n\nPhoenix Suns: +1600 (bet $10 to win $170 total)\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers: +2000 (bet $10 to win $210 total)\n\nMiami Heat: +2500 (bet $10 to win $260 total)\n\nNew York Knicks: +2500 (bet $10 to win $260 total)\n\nDallas Mavericks: +2500 (bet $10 to win $260 total)\n\nJames is no stranger to movement.\n\nHe spent the first seven years of his career in Cleveland before famously taking his talents to South Beach and joining the Heat for four seasons, before returning to Cleveland for four more years.\n\nJames then joined the Lakers in 2018, and has since spent the past six years in Tinseltown.\n\nRELATED: Could Suns select Bronny at No. 22?\n\nWhile the Lakers are heavy favorites to retain James, they are also favored to select his son Bronny in the 2024 NBA Draft.\n\nAt DraftKings, L.A. is the current favorite to draft LeBron's namesake at +180.\n\nWhy LeBron James will remain a Laker next season and beyond\n\nHowever, in another twist, it was revealed this week by The Athletic's Shams Charania that Bronny plans to work out for only a few teams, including the Lakers and Suns — and potentially, just those two.\n\nWith that, the Suns' odds of signing James moved drastically overnight, from +3000 on Tuesday to +1600 on Wednesday morning.\n\nFollow along with FOX Sports for the latest news on the NBA and other sports.\n\nWant great stories delivered right to your inbox?
