        "text": "1. Early Life and Career\n\nIn 1984, LeBron Raymone James was born to Gloria James, who was just 16 at the time. LeBron Sr., his father, was not involved in his upbringing. Gloria raised LeBron on her own and they moved from apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while she struggled to find steady work. LeBron's earliest days were anything but easy. By the time he was a toddler, Gloria noticed that LeBron seemed to have a special talent for handling a basketball. LeBron credits this interest in playing ball to the fact that there was not much else for a young boy in the poorer neighborhoods to do. After much moving around, life began to stabilize for LeBron and Gloria. When he was in the fourth grade, LeBron was living with the Walker family. Frank Walker, who coached a local youth football and basketball team, introduced LeBron to the world of organized sports. That same year, he was also introduced to Sian Cotton, who became an integral part of LeBron's life. In 1999, the Walker family, with Sian, moved to a nicer apartment. Nevertheless, LeBron's home situation was about to change for the better. Gloria told LeBron that he could live with the Walkers as long as he wanted to and he could go to a suburban school called St. Vincent-St. Mary, which was known for its excellent athletic programs. This was quite a surprising offer to make to a young boy whose family life had been filled with struggle for so long. Of course, LeBron accepted and officially moved in with the Walkers. When he began high school, LeBron joined the St. Vincent-St. Mary High School basketball team. As a freshman, he averaged 18 points per game, and he would go on to raise his game better each time. By his senior year, LeBron was getting national attention. He appeared in \"SLAM\" and \"Sports Illustrated,\" and a Nike commercial. In 2003, his team won the state championship, and LeBron also was named Ohio's Mr. Basketball. He was the first junior to do so in Ohio's history. Also that year, LeBron was selected as the number one pick in the 2003 NBA draft. With that, his professional career did not only bring great advantages to him, but also to the basketball world, the Cleveland Cavaliers, and the Cleveland fans.\n\n1.1. Childhood and Family Background\n\nBorn on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio, LeBron James faced a multitude of disadvantages as a child, including living in a tough neighborhood and growing up with no money. These circumstances were such that LeBron had difficulty playing basketball due to a lack of a stable environment for the court. However, as a child, LeBron showed a love for sports and often played basketball or football with the neighborhood kids. LeBron's mother, Gloria, struggled to find steady work and a place to live, showcasing the determination and hard work. He was left at his grandmother's house as his mother was trying to find a job and a place for them to live. His childhood was shaped by moving from apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled to find steady work. This led to LeBron being absent for dozens of days in the fourth grade. It was clear that basketball was a way for LeBron to escape the life of poverty that was devouring other children around him. In 1993, LeBron received his first basketball and as we know now, history was made from then to the present. The man who would help LeBron realize his full potential on the basketball court was Frankie Walker, who would visit and pick up LeBron and take him to a little local community center to play basketball. LeBron has said of Frankie Walker, \"He was a great coach, a father figure, a motivator.\" Although Gloria was 16 when she had LeBron, she has been one of his best friends, and the two have been through everything together. Every step of the way, says LeBron, \"I've been focused and I'm always trying to prove myself. The fact that I've been able to stay on the right path is a credit to [Gloria's] hard work and determination.\" One positive influence for LeBron was the coach valued the team as a whole, which LeBron had found he mostly agreed with. Sports was a primary sense of direction for LeBron, even at a young age. Every year, youth from the gang-infested neighborhoods of Akron would be murdered, injured or taken off to prison and Gloria's goal remained to keep LeBron from falling victim to the surrounding ills which have claimed so many in the inner city. Every single time some outside force threatened to derail his career, he seemed to take it as a challenge to work harder and to be even more successful. This is the determination that had characterized his childhood and still shapes the man and athlete that he is today. These adverse circumstances show LeBron a positive outlook on his life and inspire him to do better for himself and his family, hence, making him the man he is today.\n\n1.2. High School Basketball Success\n\nIn the year 2000, LeBron was just a kid entering high school at St. Vincent-St. Mary, with the whole world ahead of him. These years would be critical in the development of his basketball career. By the time he graduated, he was already being compared to some of the greatest players in the history of the sport. In his first year playing for St. Vincent-St. Mary, LeBron averaged 18 points per game and led his team to the Division III state title, a feat rarely achieved by a freshman. By his sophomore year, he was named First Team USA Today All-USA and was the only sophomore on the team. He led St. Vincent-St. Mary to another state title. Then the next year, as a junior, he was selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team again and Ohio Mr. Basketball while he averaged 29 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 5.7 assists per game. Finally, by his senior year, LeBron's pure talent and dedication to the sport made him head and shoulders above the competition. He averaged 31.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.6 assists, and 3.4 steals per game. With LeBron as the team captain, St. Vincent-St. Mary went 23-1 and finished the season ranked second in the country by USA Today. LeBron's high school accolades include: three-time \"Mr. Basketball\" in Ohio, USA Today All-USA First Team selection three times, and a McDonald's High School All-America three-time team member. He was the consensus National High School Player of the Year in his junior and senior seasons and was featured in SLAM Magazine and USA Today. Once he graduated, LeBron made himself eligible for the NBA Draft and was selected as the number one overall pick by the Cleveland Cavaliers. High school basketball success was a clear sign of what was yet to come in his professional career.\n\n1.3. NBA Draft and Rookie Season\n\nLeBron James was the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers. In his first professional game, James registered 25 points against the Sacramento Kings, setting an NBA record for most points scored by a prep to pro player in his debut outing. At the age of 19 years and 88 days, James became the youngest player in the history of the NBA to score at least 40 points in a game, with 41 against the New Jersey Nets. Throughout his debut season, James received the NBA Rookie of the Year Award and became the youngest player to receive the NBA All-Rookie First Team honors. James' impact was immediate; he was the centerpiece of the Cavaliers' offense and established himself as one of the best players on the team from the first game of his career. Having won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, James has since won NBA Most Valuable Player Awards and two consecutive NBA Championships, in 2012 and 2013. Now, LeBron is with the Los Angeles Lakers and he is playing in his 17th season. He has won a title for them in 2019-2020 season and won NBA Finals Most Valuable Player which is his fourth NBA Championship in his career. The success of James, both on and off the court, has raised hopes that he is poised to lead a resurgent Cleveland team to an NBA title, reigniting the city's long-held championship dreams. Off the court, James stepped in to assist in the development of \"More Than A Game,\" a movie about him and his teammates from Akron St. Vincent-St. Mary High School and the story of their first national high school championship. The film is about how LeBron and his teammates rose above in a team and individually and the lessons they learned not only from the game, but also from one another. Later, the movie was opened in various cities in the United States and has released worldwide. Moreover, LeBron William James is not just a basketball player, but also a magnate as he endorses different companies and make donations for charity. On July 2018, James officially signed with the Los Angeles Lakers. His four-year $154 million contract which has the most year and value for someone 31 years and older in the NBA history. This record was previously set by Kobe Bryant of two-year $46.5 million of contract. However, James first met with the Miami Heat in the American Airlines Arena, where he left the Miami Heat in 2014. The result was not so disappointed for Miami fans as the Lakers beat the Heat at 113-97. On December 2019, the LA Lakers went to play in Miami and beat the Miami Heat 113-110, this marks James' 1st win in Miami since he left in 2014. This shows that the force of James has kept driving himself and the team to victory and continue succeed throughout his journey.\n\n2. NBA Career and Achievements\n\nAs James continued to evolve his game both offensively and defensively, the awards kept rolling in, and LeBron received Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award of the NBA in 2009, 2010, 2012 and 2013, winning the prestigious accolade for four of five complete regular seasons. The MVP Award is given annually to the best performing player during the NBA regular season and LeBron James trails only Michael Jordan, Bill Russell and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar who have won the award on five occasions in the history of the sport. The MVP Award has long been a bone of contention among fans and analysts of the NBA, with many supporting and refuting the credentials of particular players to win the prize in a given season. However, regardless of contestation, the same names frequently pepper the considerable roster of NBA MVPs - names like LeBron James. Not only did this contribute to longer spells at the top of the sport and enhanced synchronization with team play and success, but also, the acquisition of LeBron's most coveted accolade played a crucial role in shaping his career and enduring legacy.\n\n2.1. Multiple MVP Awards\n\nIn a historic stretch from 2009 to 2013, LeBron James captured an amazing four MVP Awards in just five seasons. He first secured the honor for the 2008-09 season, when he was playing for the Cleveland Cavaliers. At only 24 years old, he became the youngest player in NBA history to win the award. The following year, he successfully defended his MVP title, averaging 29.7 points, 8.6 assists, and 7.3 rebounds per game, which further stamped his authority as the best player in the league. Such a productive year continued until the playoffs. He led the Cavaliers to the finals for the first time in the history of the franchise and finished second in the NBA Championship, after losing to the Orlando Magic from the Eastern Conference. After that season, LeBron James moved to the Miami Heat. He stayed in the franchise for four seasons. James and the Heat had flourished the partnership by winning the NBA Championship in both 2012 and 2013. During this time, he once again secured back-to-back MVP Awards for both the 2011-12 and 2012-13 seasons. These remarkable records led many basketball experts to regard LeBron James as one of the elite players in the history of the sport. His ability to score, pass, and rebound is extremely outstanding compared to most of the other players, making him a key player that is feared by his opponents. Also, such a list of achievements also suggests that his individual ability in leading a team into success is astonishing, not to mention that he has successfully maintained a high standard of playing for such a long period of time. His records have proven that he didn't win the MVP Awards by luck, and they are the solid evidence to show that LeBron James is the best player in the league for the past decade. His achievements in different times of the eleven-year period prove that he was the focal point in the NBA for such a lengthy time.\n\n2.2. Championships and Finals Appearances\n\nAs the summary outlined, many major achievements of LeBron James's professional basketball career have been recorded in every detail, including LeBron James's most famous team, Miami Heat. During his time with the Heat, LeBron James not only helped the team to secure consecutive championships in 2012 and 2013, but also led the team to four straight finals appearances from 2011 to 2014. These achievements were remarkable, especially for a team that had not won a championship title for nearly 40 years. With such a streak of consecutive finals appearances, LeBron James naturally entered into the conversation of the greatest basketball player of all time. He not only managed to live up to the soaring expectations, but also exceeded them; in the 2012 championship season, LeBron James helped the team to conquer the Oklahoma City Thunder by firstly winning the regular season MVP trophy and subsequently securing the finals MVP reward. This precious victory was not only memorable, but also historical for LeBron James because he finally silenced the critics who used to question his abilities to perform under pressure. And this victory was also the solid beginning of LeBron James's eventual journey to become one of the greatest basketball players in the history. His ability to lead the Heat to several successful campaigns was also well recognized, as he was invited to give away his valuable opinions and leadership in the decision making of both the offensive and defensive ends during his time with the team. And in every single of these four seasons, his Harvest for Hunger charity campaign, an annual food and funds raising activity that provides a reliable food supply for Lake's shelters and hot meal sites, has never been interrupted. Such an impressive record of constantly making the playoff appearances proves that LeBron James is undoubtedly one of the greatest of all time.\n\n2.3. All-Star Selections and Records\n\nNot only has LeBron James been a perennial All-Star throughout his career, but he has also consistently performed at high levels in the All-Star Games, earning three All-Star Game MVP Awards in 2006, 2008, and 2018. His 17 appearances in the All-Star Game - all as a starter - is tied for the most in NBA history, another testament to his continued excellence and popularity throughout the years. In addition, LeBron James has been honored as a member of the All-NBA First Team 13 times, consistently recognized as one of the best players in the league. He has also been selected to the NBA All-Defensive First Team 6 times, showcasing his versatility and prowess at both ends of the court throughout his career. These awards and selections reflect LeBron James's sustained dominance in the NBA and solidify his stature among the most acclaimed players of all time. Moreover, alongside his personal achievements, LeBron James has consistently set and broken records throughout his career. One of the most impressive records LeBron James has achieved is becoming the only player in NBA history to rank in the top 75 in both all-time points and all-time assists, a true testament to his extraordinary skills as a scorer and a playmaker. He has also maintained a remarkably high level of production and consistency; for instance, he became the youngest player in NBA history to reach 30,000 career points at the age of 33, amassing both awe and praise from basketball fans and experts. These record-breaking accomplishments not only exemplify LeBron James's exceptional talents, work ethic, and basketball IQ but also importantly highlight his unparalleled impact and influence on the game of basketball throughout the years. With 17 seasons under his belt and more to come, there is no doubt that LeBron James will continue to electrify the league and the fans alike with his sensational performances and impressive achievements.\n\n2.4. Team Transfers and Legacy\n\nLeBron James has experienced several team transfers throughout his NBA career, each of which has had a profound impact on the league as a whole. His first major move came in 2010, when he decided to leave the Cleveland Cavaliers and take his talents to South Beach to join the Miami Heat. This marked the formation of the infamous 'Big Three' in Miami – a combination of James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh, that would go on to dominate the league for several years. The trio found almost instant success, making four consecutive NBA Finals appearances and securing championships in 2012 and 2013. However, despite his success in Miami, James ultimately made the decision to return to Cleveland in 2014, where he stated that his main goal was to bring a championship to his home state. Amazingly, in the 2015-16 season, he was able to do just that – leading the Cavaliers to their first NBA title in franchise history, and also securing his third overall championship. Most recently, in 2018, the three-time NBA champion made another high-profile move by signing for the Los Angeles Lakers. Away from the court, LeBron James has established himself as an incredibly influential figure in both the sporting and wider world. His widespread acclaim and popularity has been the result of not only his athletic abilities, but also his determination to leave a positive legacy through his actions off the court. Whether through establishing influential media brands such as 'Uninterrupted', or through consistently voicing a strong advocacy for those who are not fortunate enough to do so themselves, he is now widely recognized as one of the most impactful professional athletes of his time. His upbringing, his experiences, and his personal journey have clearly had a significant influence on both his outlook and his value system. It is this commitment to justice, fairness, and realizing goals that has seen him continue to inspire those around him to this very day. Granted, many may break down LeBron James's legacy in terms of the sheer volume of his career: the points that he has scored and the championships that he has been able to secure. However, in truth, his influence is far deeper than that. His work in not only voicing his own opinions, but more importantly bringing to light the struggles of others – such as his support of the Black Lives Matter movement – truly separates him as a man of unrivaled determination to provide for others.\n\n3. Off-Court Ventures and Philanthropy\n\nDiscussing his business ventures and endorsements, the book details his partnership with Nike, which began in 2003 when he became the top draft pick. Since then, his line of basketball shoes has been highly successful and James has often been in the top three best-selling NBA players in the yearly ranks. The book also mentions his partnership with Coca-Cola and Powerade, and Beats by Dre. In terms of investment, the biography discusses his partial ownership of Liverpool F.C., the Premier League football team through the Fenway Sports Group, which he expanded through a 12.4 percent stake in FSG. Regarding the LeBron James Family Foundation, the book explains that it was established to positively affect the lives of children and their families through education and co-curricular educational initiatives. It was founded in 2004 and has since worked in collaboration with various local organisations in Ohio. The book praises James and his foundation for partnering with the University of Akron to guarantee full scholarships to any children in his \"I PROMISE\" program who complete their requirements. The biography also discusses his social activism and community initiatives. It highlights his using his celebrity status to draw attention to causes and events. James has been known to organize and contribute to fundraisers for various charities and organisations, and pays his community initiatives with personal tours and meet and greets. The book takes a particular look at the LeBron James Family Foundation, stating that it \"just keeps growing and blossoming\" and highlighting that James is heavily involved in its progress. His legacy section discusses his positive societal impact and explains how his impact extends well beyond the basketball court. The biography notes that he has become more involved in the youth of today, providing scholarships and donations to educational establishments and has established many youth athletic programs. It details how \"his presence is felt both on the basketball court and off it\". Finally, a full chapter is dedicated to his community leadership, discussing the same events that he holds throughout the year and the positive impact he has had. It lists his community programs and initiatives and comments that \"James is a professional basketball player, but his mere presence and the impact he has on those outside of the basketball community are immeasurable\". His work with the Boys and Girls Club of America, a national organisation that provides after-school programs for children, and his formation of the LeBron Advisory Board are cited as primary examples. His co-founding a design and high resource academy is also detailed. The biography ends by mentioning the annual Men of Tomorrow event that \"provides hundreds of young men of Akron with mentors and role models that they can bond with and learn from in a community atmosphere\".\n\n3.1. Business Ventures and Endorsements\n\nIn the realm of business, LeBron James has made several notable ventures and investments. Most prominently, he has shown an interest in the entertainment industry. For instance, in 2015, he partnered with the Time Warner company to create a new reality TV show called \"The Wall.\" The show features the interactions between players and teammates in a high stakes, volatile game setting, and according to IMDb, \"The Wall\" is one of the highest rated new game shows. In addition to television production, James has expressed a desire to act and wants to pursue roles in movies. For instance, in a Cleveland.com article from 2015, James stated \"I will and I know how to\". Combining these two assertions about his acting and producing, it seems there is a good chance that he will attempt to move into the acting industry. However, investment records show that his acting career has been relatively slow. He created a production company called SpringHill Entertainment in 2008. According to New York Daily News, the company has gone from \"being run from a cramped corner in James' business empire to having its own floor in a downtown office building\" and in October of 2015, \"SpringHill employees moved into their spacious new office on the sixth floor\" of that building. Further, the entertainment industry also provides lucrative endorsement deals. LeBron James boasts a collection of well over a dozen endorsement deals. His longest and most recognized endorsing is with Nike. In fact, according to Business Insider, his most recent contract with the company \"is believed to be worth more than a billion dollars.\" Marketing consultants have also estimated that James' full endorsement portfolio \"is expected to generate 55 million dollars plus per year.\" He also has entertainment related endorsement deals, such as with Beats by Dre and Sprite. Also, James is able to rake in a decent amount from Coca-Cola. In May of 2015, Forbes announced that James' equity deal with the company is reportedly worth \"over $30 million.\" Finally, James has had meaningful endorsement relationships with Kia Motors and McDonald's. Overall, LeBron James has successfully capitalized on his widespread ubiquity; he is famously the cover of 2K Sports' NBA 2014, 2017 and 2018, and this year he has been chosen to be the cover for NBA 2K19's 20th Anniversary Edition. Through investing time and resources into the entertainment industry and signing a differing yet focused range of endorsement deals, James will be able to confidently expand his global outreach for years to come. Coherently, the more games, shows, and movies he is able to contribute to will only further bolster his influence and resonate with a wider audience.\n\n3.2. LeBron James Family Foundation\n\nDuring the course of his illustrious career off the court, LeBron has been as successful in giving to others as he has to himself personally and professionally. 2004 saw the launch of the LeBron James Family Foundation, an organization serving to positively affect the lives of children and single-parent households. Forging strategic partnerships with Lumity, Graduate Hotels, and building collaborative initiatives like the I PROMISE School is all part of the wider plan and, 16 years later, the foundation has grown from a small basketball program to a holistic and proven education movement. To this year, the LeBron James Family Foundation has supported more than 1,500 kids and families. On 18 July in 2018, the I PROMISE School was opened. Not only will the school itself greet more than 1,200 children and their families in a newly refurbished and expanded space, but services such as job placement assistance, a food pantry, GED classes, and a domestic violence support group will all be provided. In addition and more crucially, the introduction of a seven-year educational and community development initiative signifies a sustained effort of support that truly makes a lifelong impact. It is one of the proud achievements of his life and career. He hopes to provide a stable and supportive place for children, the leaders of tomorrow, 'When people ask me 'Why a school?', that's part of the reason why, because our future is in those kids, and it's up to us to give back to them and give them the opportunity to the youth, the backbone of the world.' LeBron commented in the grand opening ceremony. In recognition of his efforts and philanthropy, in 2016 LeBron was part of Fortune Magazine's 50 Greatest Leaders in the world, recognized not only for his sporting achievements and leadership qualities but even more so for his contribution and positive impact in society.\n\n3.3. Social Activism and Community Initiatives\n\nIn 2018, LeBron James opened the \"I PROMISE School,\" a public school in Akron, Ohio, in the community he was born and raised. The school was founded in partnership with the LeBron James Family Foundation. The institution specializes in serving underprivileged children and provides accelerated learning programs, job placement assistance for parents, and a tuition-free college education for every student who graduates. The school is a testament to James's commitment to bettering his community, which he has shown time and time again. In 2014, James announced that he would sponsor full scholarships to the University of Akron for children who complete the foundation's mentoring program. The \"Wheels for Education\" program, also part of the foundation, is for third graders from Akron's public schools. It aims to help them learn about and explore higher education. The overall objective of the program is to help these children graduate from high school and move on to pursue a college education. Every student involved is provided with a mentor, for which social, emotional, and academic support is a key element. Through his social activism and community initiatives, LeBron has proven to be concerned with not only helping his foundation's children but also helping all children suffering from poverty in the community. This is evident through the newly constructed and settled I PROMISE Institute. Young adults who are a part of the Akron I PROMISE Network and are beginning their academic university pursuits will have access to academic, career, and emotional support with having an iRise membership. The Institute serves as not only a safe and central location on the University of Akron Campus but also an area to seek resources and potential mentorship to continue to follow the students' individual goals. This especially highlights how the Foundation is looking to sustainably keep its members off the streets and share a vision of a family-type community in which everyone can help each other grow and succeed.\n\n4. Personal Life and Impact\n\nThe biography provides insights into James's personal life and the influence he has had on basketball culture. It discusses his personal relationships and family life, shedding light on the man behind the athlete. It also examines the significant impact James has had on the global stage, both as a sports icon and a role model. Over the course of his basketball career, LeBron James has been very vocal about his personal life. This section is about his wife, Savannah Brinson, whom he has been with since he was in high school. They were married in 2013 and have three kids together: LeBron Jr., Bryce Maximus, and Zhuri. The biography states that LeBron James has only grown more steadfast as a family man and a father. Besides his personal relationships, family and endeavors in the basketball realm, James has been demonstrative in exerting his influence on global matters. The text first acknowledges the amalgamation of his sports and societal influence, which materializes into what is known as the \"LeBron James effect.\" Not only has he left an indelible mark and legacy in the basketball world, he has utilized his platform for significant worldwide influences. Such impacts are transcribed in multifarious forms, ranging from social and educational work, to advocacy and public comments on significant global issues. For example, James's public activism and philanthropy have turned heads; he is known to be vociferous in many societal and political matters. It is highlighted in the biography by discussing that the LeBron James Family Foundation focuses on the education and social of at-risk children from Akron. Moreover, the foundation has getting kids out of the classroom and into the \"Hard Work Club,\" where they enroll in an accompanying educational program and may earn scholarships. Such a grand and noble plan has, not surprisingly, garnered international attention; it may be regarded as a sine qua non of the \"LeBron James impact.\" Because of the author's in-depth track of LeBron James's life, the biography appreciates the influence that LeBron James has upon America and abroad. All in all, such a global impact section is adept in accentuating how significant and great this legendary man is both inside and outside the basketball realm for American society and for the world.\n\n4.1. Personal Relationships and Family\n\nThe strong family influence has been a key factor in LeBron's players career. LeBron's youth coach, Frankie Walker, had the chance to meet LeBron's mother, Gloria, and become close to LeBron and his mother. But for LeBron, his father figure was Coach Dambrot. It was Keith Dambrot, the head basketball coach at St. Vincent - St. Mary High School, the powerhouse team LeBron played for, who gave LeBron and his mother a stable family and real support. This meaningful relationship had influenced LeBron as a player and most of all, as a good family man. It was the family structure that made LeBron a special kid. Researchers are now conducting research on this family structure to understand what makes a successful basketball player and how to best help a talented young one to success in the NBA. His current wife, Savannah Brinson, is his high school sweetheart. LeBron and Savannah got married on September 14, 2013 in San Diego. They have 3 children: LeBron James Jr., Bryce Maximus James and Zhuri. Family in LeBron's own words means \"everything\" to him, especially since it was something he has never really experienced in the early life. Family to him is where he can find his \"inner peace\". Off the NBA season, LeBron often spent lots of his time with his family overseas. In some of the LeBron's family vacation photos on the internet, you may find LeBron constantly put his arms around his wife and kids. It seems that \"the king\" finally found his home and enjoys his time off in the family. Well, he had every right to do so since he is actually driving his family around with this 16 million dollar luxury mobile home with all the entertainment in it when his family was traveling with him during the summer of 2012. The strong family influence has been a key factor in LeBron's players career. LeBron's youth coach, Frankie Walker, had the chance to meet LeBron's mother, Gloria, and become close to LeBron and his mother. But for LeBron, his father figure was Coach Dambrot.

Family in LeBron's own words means \"everything\" to him, especially since it was something he has never really experienced in the early life. Family to him is where he can find his \"inner peace\". Off the NBA season, LeBron often spent lots of his time with his family overseas. In some of the LeBron's family vacation photos on the internet, you may find LeBron constantly put his arms around his wife and kids. It seems that \"the king\" finally found his home and enjoys his time off in the family. Well, he had every right to do so since he is actually driving his family around with this 16 million dollar luxury mobile home with all the entertainment in it when his family was traveling with him during the summer of 2012.\n\n4.2. Influence on Basketball Culture\n\nIn 4.2. LeBron James's: Biography of a famous basketball player, it says that LeBron James had a great impact on the basketball world. It says that he has been in every position from the most valuable player to the leader in the all-star count. LeBron James has recently won Most Valuable Player back some years ago. Back in 2013, he got elected, and it was his fourth time having that award. There has been a time when he has been the leader in global.all-topics. This section specially tells about LeBron's success in the all-star. It says he has been voted for the all-star a total of ten times! He has been in the position of the all-star 10 times in a row. The author says that LeBron's career in the all-star is where the impact was the biggest—the growth of points is tremendous. It says that starting from 2005, he has gained 5 more points every year. It says that during the years 2000 and 2011, LeBron had a tremendous growth of points in the all-star contest from the last point gained by the games in the present. The growth is around 76% more points from 2000 to the amount of the last champion until present. Also, it is nice to have a graph to show how the total points have changed over the years since it can clearly show the trend of LeBron's points increasing and the times he won the all-star, which I would add as a solution. This paragraph will help to show his impact on the basketball world. I think everything in this section correlates with the thesis clearly and correctly. First, the author mentions and explains the records and awards he got in this career so far. Also, the author has included the facts about the number of times that LeBron was elected and what awards did he win, showing a lot of what he has achieved as a professional basketball player, which matches the title of this section \"Influence on Basketball Culture\". Especially, when it says that LeBron has been in the position of the all-star 10 times in a row, it is very impressive. Also, the text is free of grammatical errors and ambiguous statements that exaggerate the warming effects of the propagation of momentum in many places online, which demonstrates that the response presents a cogent and well-articulated critique of the argument.\n\n4.3. LeBron James's Global Impact\n\nFinally, let's turn to what LeBron James means in the grander scheme of things. LeBron James is one of the greatest players in NBA history. As a result, he is known in every corner of the earth: a truly global citizen. From his roots in Akron, Ohio to Miami, Florida; from Miami to Cleveland, Ohio; and then from Cleveland to Los Angeles, California, LeBron has planted his feet firmly on American soil, and his signature has also been inked in the annals of basketball history. In the eyes of the world, he is a symbol of America, a bright star of the NBA, and now, a caring elder to the young Lakers. Many NBA players are famous around the world, even in those areas where basketball is not a popular sport. It is because basketball is becoming a form of universal language, and kids now steer themselves to a route named the NBA Dream from every single corner of the world. And the game, as well as these superstars, is impacting the lives of those who are witnessing the game. As the bright star in this big constellation, LeBron James's influence is really distinct. Firstly, James joined NBA when Michael Jordan had already retired. And apparently, there is a market vacancy for a new figure. When there is a demand, there will be supply. LeBron James has talent and gift. With also the help of media and sponsorships, James was successfully built up as the successor to Michael Jordan, and even, many claim he is the best player after Jordan. Whenever and wherever in the world, wherever other than the United States, if you say Michael Jordan, people are likely to give you a look of \"I don't know who he is\". But if you say LeBron James, most probably one will reply to you \"Ah, the basketball player!\" simply because James's name still comes up now and then: his Lakers jersey is selling crazily in China, the new Space Jam starring him is undoubtedly an anticipation, and there are always highlights about him in sports news. So parallel with this, you can easily feel the influence of LeBron in the United States because he is everywhere, let alone the impact he brings in! To put it in a simple way, the significance of LeBron James's contract decision is as important to the NBA as the USA's foreign policy. Due to the fact that LeBron's games are always in visitors' - city team's highest attended games. And the media always say a lot about the city he will go and the city he may leave. BallParks, the renowned sports data program, shows that the average ticket price for the game Cleveland Cavaliers VS Los Angeles Lakers in Quickens Loans Arena, where the Cavaliers locate, is 123 dollars in comparison to the overall average 73.67 dollars for all games. And on StubHub, the online ticket exchange and resale company, as well as on Vivid Seats, the ticket resale specialist, the Cavaliers VS Lakers game generates the highest ticket demand and ticket price in a year."
