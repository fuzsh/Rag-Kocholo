        "text": "It was before he became the NBA's all-time leading scorer. It was before he won NBA titles with three different teams, including the Cavs. It was before he was a multi-time NBA MVP. It was even before he was the first overall pick in the 2003 NBA Draft.\n\nBefore all of that, LeBron James really was just a kid from Akron.\n\nAnd in Akron, James authored one of the all-time great high school basketball career at St. Vincent-St. Mary. Twenty years later, we look back on what was written about James in 2003.\n\nLeBron era at STVM ended 20 years ago: Mom Gloria, former coaches, teammates reflect\n\nLook out, LeBron:Imagine THIS Stark County basketball team in Ohio's state tournament. Look out, LeBron.\n\nTHE RISE OF A STAR - THROUGH THE FAME, HYPE AND CONTROVERSY, LEBRON JAMES HAS RISEN TO THE OCCASION\n\nAuthor: Tom Reed\n\nPublished: June 27, 2003\n\nThirty years from now the mania surrounding the high school career of LeBron James might seem tame by comparison. Like the haircuts of the Beatles or the story lines of All In The Family.\n\nThirty years from now ESPN might be conducting Sunday Night Conversations with prodigal fifth-graders, wondering if they can dominate on the middle-school level the way they did in grade school.\n\nFor now, however, the standard-bearer for generating sports hype and finding ways to live up to it is James, the St. Vincent-St. Mary graduate, the $90 million Nike pitchman, the King of Preps.\n\nAs fans look forward to his pro career with the Cavaliers -- which officially began Thursday when the franchise made him the first pick of the 2003 NBA Draft -- it only seems fitting to take one last glimpse at the past four years.\n\nTo recognize his accomplishments.\n\nTo acknowledge his talents.\n\nTo appreciate his legacy.\n\nWhether you like James or grow weary of reading about him, it's hard to deny that he changed the way the world looks at high school athletes.\n\nIt's one of the reasons the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame requested some of his St. Vincent-St. Mary gear to display in its Springfield, Mass., museum this spring.\n\nBefore LeBron, high school games were not featured on national cable networks. He made three appearances on ESPN, including the McDonald's All-American Game from Gund Arena in March. (The cable network rebroadcast last December's game between the Irish and Oak Hill [Va.] Academy as a lead-in to the draft.)\n\nBefore LeBron, the names of prep phenoms were rarely recognized outside of a state or region. Think people in California knew of the legend of Jerry Lucas when he was leading Middletown to state titles in the late 1950s?\n\nBefore LeBron, the actions of 18-year-old athletes were not discussed and debated on sports talk shows.\n\nSomewhere along the line, his 15 minutes of fame were extended exponentially, perhaps infinitely.\n\n\"He has been a marked guy for three years,\" Cavaliers General Manager Jim Paxson said.\n\n\"I have a 17- and 19-year-old son and I try to imagine them in that position. I'm very impressed with how he has handled the situation.\"\n\nForget for a moment the highlight-reel dunks and no-look passes. The Hummer and throwback jersey controversies. The bravado and the King James persona. The 2,646 career points (No. 3 in Ohio prep basketball history), the three state titles and the 2003 USA Today poll championship.\n\nForget all of it and just try to imagine having to carry around a steamer chest full of hype and expectations for more than two years.\n\nWorld's Strongest Men competitors don't shoulder loads as heavy.\n\nThink of the pressure. Consider the strain. Envision the endless interview and autograph requests.\n\nAll before you graduate from high school.\n\nMichael Jordan was just another high school player, not on the cover of Sports Illustrated when he was a junior.\n\nKobe Bryant didn't have his regular-season home games moved to a college arena to accommodate overflow crowds.\n\nDid anyone ever pay $50 for a $5 ticket to see Magic Johnson play a district tournament basketball game?\n\nJames has not just attracted average basketball fans to his performances.\n\nShaq (as in Shaquille O'Neal) came to Canton to watch him. Spike Lee sat courtside in Washington, D.C. If LeBron had left tickets for Elvis, there might have been a legitimate sighting.\n\nJames has been a miniature version of Muhammad Ali in the sense that he took us everywhere.\n\nMaybe not to destinations as exotic as Zaire or Manila, but who dreamed an 18-year-old from our own back yard would be playing to packed houses in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, North Carolina, New Jersey, Chicago and Washington?\n\nHe never seemed to tire of the spotlight. Never blamed a subpar outing on the fatigue of the nonstop carnival atmosphere.\n\nOh, there were missteps along the way, questionable decisions made by James and his family.\n\nBut no regrets. In his eyes, the adversity, self-inflicted or otherwise, has made him a stronger person, a better person.\n\nWhat James endured during a chaotic senior year is likely to pay dividends next season and beyond.\n\nThink the kid knows a thing or two about crisis management? About reading and hearing unflattering remarks regarding family members or friends?\n\nThere may not be a teen-ager in America who has been more second-guessed than LeBron James.\n\nHow many times have you heard that the people closest to James might represent a deterrent to his success at the next level? How would that make you feel?\n\nSeldom has he lashed out at his detractors. Not once has he said he felt as though he was being exploited.\n\nHe is not a martyr just as he is not an example of all that is wrong with prep sports.\n\nThe James phenomenon cannot be painted in absolutes. His story is complex, his character multilayered.\n\nPeople often condemn things they don't easily understand. Things that are so radically different from what they are accustomed to. Why would three shoe companies wage such a public and high-priced war over a teen-ager? Why does one athlete command this much attention?\n\nThere was no precedent here.\n\nNo dry run or starter kit.\n\nJames experienced the best (and sometimes, the worst) of what sports has to offer over the last few years. He experienced everything except normalcy, that is. The 6-foot-7, 238-pound man-child never spent a day within its reassuring embrace.\n\nHe accepted the fact he is special, gifted and unique, and he ran with it.\n\nHe ran with it, maximized it, never took it for granted.\n\nThe dunks.\n\nThe great passes.\n\nThe creativity.\n\nThe extraordinary vision and basketball IQ.\n\nThe ability to rise to the moment.\n\nThe competitive fire that sparked his team when it appeared to be running on empty.\n\nFour years, four state final appearances, one \"on-the-court\" loss to an Ohio opponent.\n\nThrough it all, he kept working to improve his game, to thicken and harden his body for the upcoming battles of the NBA.\n\nHe also found time for others.\n\nHe signed autographs, he visited hospitals, he enjoyed spending time with children -- maybe because he is still a kid himself. That's something we tend to forget.\n\nWhen James visited Nike headquarters last month, he and his advisers were invited to the home of shoe company executive Lynn Merritt for dinner. After the feast, his agent, Aaron Goodwin, talked money with Merritt while in the next room James played video games with Merritt's teen-age son.\n\nWho can predict how James will blossom as a pro? Will the big money dull his hunger and ambition? Certainly no player in NBA history has come into the league with more expectations, more endorsements, more pressure to succeed.\n\nAs he makes the crossover dribble into the professional ranks tonight, here is one last tribute to LeBron James. He didn't ask to become the most celebrated high school athlete in history, but he met every challenge and provided memories that will have Akron talking for the next 30 years.\n\n------------\n\nCORONATION COMPLETE â€” LEBRON CROWNED A CAVALIER\n\nAuthor: Tom Reed\n\nPublished: June 27, 2003\n\nThe moment belonged to LeBron James. It also belonged to Akron and Cleveland and really all of Northeastern Ohio.\n\nHe wasn't about to let anyone take it away him from him -- or the area he proudly has represented before the eyes of a nation these past few years.\n\nSo when the top pick of the NBA Draft and the Cavaliers was asked if he wouldn't rather play in a more \"glamorous\" market such as New York or Los Angeles, James never hesitated.\n\n\"You come (to Cleveland) next season and see how glamorous it is,\" James said, smiling. \"It's going to be a lot better. It will be lit up like Vegas.\"\n\nIt certainly was aglow Thursday night.\n\nOn the most memorable evening of his life -- the one it seems he has been destined to live out for more than two years -- James left no doubt where his heart lies.\n\nWith his family, with his friends, with his hometown and the one so eager to adopt him.\n\n\"I'm excited, I'm still excited, this dream has finally come (true) and the hard work has finally paid off,\" James said.\n\nDressed in a resplendent white suit, the St. Vincent-St. Mary graduate made it official by walking across the stage at Madison Square Garden Theater and shaking hands with NBA Commissioner David Stern to loud applause, and some boos, from the New York fans.\n\nMore than 50 family members, friends and St. V-M teammates made the trip from Akron to witness the event.\n\nGloria James sat with her son, agent Aaron Goodwin, LeBron's cousin and friend Maverick Carter and two of the player's uncles at a small table near the stage in an area reserved for the draft picks.\n\nJames' mother did not hide her pride. She hugged him right before he walked onto the stage before a national television audience.\n\n\"I'm very excited, very happy for him,\" said Gloria James, outfitted in a cream-colored pantsuit and a brown scarf. \"He is finally allowed to pursue the dream he has had since he was a child.\"\n\nWhile James will play in Cleveland, he might continue to live in Summit County.\n\nA source said James has found a Bath Township home that he likes, although no deal has been reached. Goodwin said the family is still looking at about five properties.\n\nThe most fashionable property at the Garden last night was a white No. 23 Cavaliers T-shirt. As soon as Stern made the announcement, the shirts were held up by some of his friends and his mother.\n\nSeveral replica St. V-M jerseys also could be spotted in the crowd by fans with no affiliation to the family.\n\n\"It's a great feeling that my game has been passed on to the younger kids,\" James said. \"It's also good for the city of Cleveland . . . because every time they see a LeBron James jersey they will see 'Cleveland Cavaliers' on it.\"\n\nJames said he is relieved to have the long buildup to the draft finally end.\n\nHe is anxious to participate in the Cavaliers' summer league games and cannot wait for the start of his rookie season.\n\nWith all of the hype, James said he knows opponents will be eager to test him.\n\n\"I'm one of the most highly publicized players in the country right now and I haven't even played one game of basketball in the NBA,\" James said. \"I know I'm a marked man, but I just have to go out there and play hard.\n\n\"I'm ready to play a game. I have been working out so long -- I'm getting tired of playing by myself. I look crazy out there.\"\n\nJames also wants to prove he's worthy of the top pick and all the commotion. His $90 million endorsement deal with Nike has made him a lightning rod. There were some chants of \"Overrated\" from the crowd -- taunts that James heard often during his senior season.\n\nOne fan held up a sign reading, \"LeBron, can I borrow 90 million?\"\n\n\"I'm not setting my goals for anyone but myself,\" James said. \"The hype is always going to be there because of my accomplishments. I'm setting goals for myself and nobody else.\"\n\nJames said his entourage is not about to swell. He's not worried about the prospects of playing before sellout crowds at Gund Arena.\n\n\"The crowds are not going to get any bigger,\" James said. \"Most of the time last year our (St. V-M) crowd was bigger than the Cavs' crowds.\"\n\nJames was quite proud of his white suit, which easily distinguished him from the other draftees. He selected it from six options presented to him.\n\n\"I just think I look pretty good in white, (don't) you think so?\" James said. \"My (Chicago tailor) made this for me and said, 'I can make the best suit in the draft.' So I said, 'You try, and I will wear it if it is.' I think it is.\"\n\nThe Cavs can sign James after Tuesday. Based on the collective bargaining agreement, James' salary is slotted to be $18.79 million for four years. He'll earn $4.02 million this season, $4.32 million next year, $4.62 million in 2007-08, and $5.8 million in his option year.\n\n------------\n\nLEBRON JAMES, FRIENDS, FANS ENJOY RIDE\n\nAuthor: Tom Reed\n\nPublished: June 27, 2003\n\nLeBron James realized a dream Thursday night.\n\nHe had a lot of family and friends -- and even a few strangers from the Akron area -- on hand to share in it.\n\nSummit County was well represented Thursday night at the NBA Draft in the Madison Square Garden Theater.\n\nSt. Vincent-St. Mary coach Dru Joyce and a handful of Irish teammates were among those packing about eight rows of prime seats set aside for family and friends to see James selected with the first pick.\n\n\"It's crazy, really crazy,\" said former St. Vincent-St. Mary teammate Travis Romeo. \"I've spent my life watching the draft on television and now here I am watching one of my best friends become the No. 1 pick. It's wild.\"\n\nIrish assistant Lee Cotton said about four busloads of James supporters made the short trip from their New York hotel over to the Garden. Fred Nance, an attorney for James, and Nike executive Lynn Merritt also were in attendance.\n\nThe James gang roared its approval when the top pick walked across the stage and shook hands with NBA Commissioner David Stern.\n\nThey spoke with pride. They talked about all the memories that led to this moment.\n\n\"It's so exciting,\" Joyce said. \"I have been around 'Bron for 10 or 11 years and watched him grow up.\n\n\"I'm just happy to be a part of this and watch all the hard work pay off.\"\n\nMany of James' family and friends knew they would be here months ago. Not Michael Dellosa, a recent graduate from Green High.\n\nDellosa is a big James fan, and his family surprised him with a trip to New York as a graduation present.\n\n\"I just found out about it last week,\" Dellosa said. \"I got a lot of money, but this is something really special.\"\n\nNew York resident Sal Brucculeri also was cheering for James while clutching a replica St. Vincent-St. Mary jersey that he purchased for $50 on eBay.\n\n\"I'm just a big basketball fan and I have been following his career,\" Brucculeri said.\n\nHe might be one of the followers eager to purchase James-related Nike gear.\n\nJames said he has not chosen a logo or name for his line of shoes. An authentic James No. 23 Cavaliers jersey will cost about $140.\n\nNone of his family and friends had to spend a dime Wednesday night for dinner at Justin's, a restaurant owned by Sean \"Puffy\" Combs.\n\nThe group was treated to a concert by D-Block and Lox.\n\n\"It has been a great ride,\" said former teammate Willie McGee.\n\n\"Tonight is how LeBron's storybook tale should end. This is the proper final chapter.\""
