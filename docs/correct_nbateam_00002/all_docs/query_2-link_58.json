        "text": "LeBron James says \"it just makes sense\" to own a potential NBA team in Las Vegas.\n\nJames was asked about his interest in an expansion franchise in the city after the Los Angeles Lakers' preseason win over Brooklyn at T-Mobile Arena on Monday.\n\nJames cited the growing sports profile in Las Vegas, including the Raiders, Golden Knights, Aces and Formula One, along with the NBA Summer League.\n\nRELATED |\n\n\"I mean, sports is here,\" he said. \"And I think adding an NBA franchise here would just add to the momentum going on in this town. It's an attraction.\"\n\nJames also recalled his experience playing with Team USA in Las Vegas ahead of RBIA and Olympic tournaments, saying the city has always treated him with respect and love.\n\nHe called it \"only a matter of time\" before Las Vegas landed an NBA team and said he hopes to be \"part of that time.\"\n\nJames has been steadfast in Las Vegas. He's already a partner in Fenway Sports Group, which owns the Boston Red Sox, and owns a small stake in the English Premier League's Liverpool FC.\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver said earlier this summer that the league would consider expansion once it completes a new media rights contract."
