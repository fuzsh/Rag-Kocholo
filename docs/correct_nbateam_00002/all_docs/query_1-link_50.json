        "text": "Introduction\n\nIt is the 20th year we have been fortunate enough to see LeBron James play basketball, and the 16th year we have seen James play playoff basketball. The Los Angeles Lakers so far have dominated the competition, with them running through Memphis in six in the first round, and being one game away from knocking the Golden State Warriors in the semifinals. This entire Los Angeles Lakers has come through in the playoffs so far, with amazing games from people such as Anthony Davis, DLO, Austin Reeves, Rui Hachimura, and most recently Lonnie Walker IV. The Lakers have one of the deepest teams in the NBA, and this has led many people to say that this is the first time in LeBron James’s career that he has had “help.” I found that statement a little hard to believe, seeing how many elite teams LeBron has been on, so today, we are going to dive into the roster of every team James has brought a championship, and see whether or not LeBron never had help.\n\nThe Miami Heat\n\nTo start things off, I want to look at LeBron’s first “real team” that he had in the league. Of course, the Cleveland Cavaliers were the first team LeBron James first played for from 2003–2011, but James had no real pieces around him shouldering some of his load in the later stages of the playoffs, this predicament being the main reason for LeBron James’s iconic and equally controversial decision to leave Cleveland and go to the Miami Heat in 2010. Starting things off, James joined Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami to form the first “Big 3” in the NBA (really the second if you count the 2008 Boston Celtics), forming the very first super team in the NBA. At the time of this union, Dwyane Wade was averaging approximately 26 PPG along with 6 RPG and 5 APG, and keep in mind that Wade at the time was vastly a top 5 shooting guard in the league. Chris Bosh also was averaging approximately 19 PPG along with 8 RPG, and while Chris was not considered a top 5 player in the league, was still in conversations for being one of the best PF’s in the league at the time. Just going off of this starting lineup, the three of them averaged 70.7 PPG in 2011, with only around 35% of the production falling on LeBron’s shoulders, which was completely different from what he had to do in Cleveland. Just for comparison one of the most prominent Big 3’s in the East today in Philadelphia, that being the trio of Tyrese Maxey, James Harden, and Joel Embiid, is averaging 74.4 PPG game, which makes the average of the Miami Heat trio fairly impressive considering most of their points were away from the three line. The Heat also had numerous role players on the Heat that provided solid offensive production such as Udonis Haslem, who averaged around 9 PPG and 9 RPG, Ray Allen, who averaged just under 11 PPG, and Mario Chalmers, who averaged just under 9 PPG. I will say that players such as Haslem and Chris Bosh had drop offs in their PPG averages post 2011, but from this season onward, the Heat got the addition of Ray Allen, who would naturally get shots that they used to get, limiting how many times those two got the ball during possessions. Also keep in mind that LeBron James became the focal point of this Miami Heat offense after losing the 2011 Finals, which would change the roles around for numerous players on this team. Dwyane would be a more clear second option on the team instead of being an equal to LeBron, Bosh and Haslem would become more focused on defensive and rebounding than scoring, and aforementioned, the Heat filled their roster up with more shooters such as Mike Miller and Shane Battier. My main point is, this Miami Heat roster was the best roster in the NBA from 2011 onward. They were also the better team in the 2011 Finals, but their lack of experience combined with a streak of bad games in the finals is what led to the Dallas Mavericks beating that Miami Heat team in five. The help in Miami showed up that time, but the stars, especially LeBron James, did not.\n\nThe Land, Round 2\n\nI specify this team as “Round 2” not only because this was LeBron’s second tenure with the Cavaliers, but the team was completely different from when he departed from the Cavs in 2010. This time around, the Cavs had a young superstar in Kyrie Irving, a great third option in Kevin Love, a good paint presence, and a great outside range thanks to key role players on this roster. Just to keep things consistent, I should mention that the big three of the Cavaliers between James, Irving, and Love averaged 63.4 PPG, which is over 10 points less than his trio on the Miami Heat in the 2011 season, but their role players more than made up for that ten point spread. Dion Waiters and Jr. Smith both averaged over 10 PPG (with Jr. being upwards of 12 PPG), their centers in Timofey Mozgov and Anderson Varejao both averaged approximately 10 PPG and 7 RPG, Tristan Thompson gave this Cavs team 8 PPG and 8 RPG per game, and guys like Iman Shumpert and Matthew Dellavedova were able to give the Cleveland Cavaliers a much needed spark off the bench. On paper, this team was one of the top 5 teams in the league, but we unfortunately did not get to see this team in action during their first season together. Kelly Olynyk decided to destroy Kevin Love’s shoulder in the very last game of the first round series between Boston and Cleveland, and Kyrie Irving would injure his knee in the 2015 NBA Finals 2 games into the series. What most people remember is LeBron James facing the Golden State Warriors by himself from games 3–6, leading people to believe that LeBron still had no help in the playoffs, but the truth is, the Cavaliers just got the injury bug at the worst time. They were also against 2015 Stephen Curry, so realistically, even with the rest of their roster, there was no stopping the start of a prime Stephen Curry. The 2016 NBA Finals also can help prove my point, with that Cavs team being able to comeback down 3–1 against the 73–9 Warriors with almost the exact same roster. Now, as a biased Golden State Warriors fan, there are some asterisks over the 2016 Finals win, such as the Draymond Green game 5 suspension and Harrison Barnes going 5–31 in games 5–7, but I also feel like the Cavaliers would have come back regardless based on the level they were playing. The Cavs also had a similar core team in 2017, but Kevin Durant was too much of a hurdle to make up even with having a top 5 roster in the league. The Cavaliers 2018 run was all LeBron James, and that year is one of the few times I completely agree with the narrative that LeBron James had no help. James took a team with George Hill, Kyle Korver, Tristan Thompson, and Jr. Smith to the NBA Finals in arguably James’s most impressive postseason run ever, but again, they came up short to the Kevin Durant lead Warriors. This Cavaliers team from 2014–2017 was a fairly good team, one of the best in the league in fact, but injuries and Kevin Durant are why this team never got a chance to fully shine.\n\nHollywood Bron\n\nWith the Miami Heat and the Cleveland Cavaliers out of the way, the last team we are going to look at today is of course the Los Angeles Lakers. The way I like to define the 2018–2019 Los Angeles Lakers is “right pieces, wrong place.” The 2018 Lakers had players like Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, Lonzo Ball, Kyle Kuzma, Ivica Zubac, and Reggie Bullock, but only finished with a 37–45 record, and missed the playoffs. Looking at these players now, this team + LeBron would be a sure lock for at least the Western Conference Semifinals (if Lonzo Ball stayed healthy), but failed to come close to that the short while this team was together. Truthfully, Ingram, Ball, and Hart all had to leave LA in order to become the players they are today, and players like Ivaca Zubac and Reggie Bullock just had to go to teams that could utilize them more. The 2019–20 Los Angeles Lakers are a completely different story however, with them not only having the first seed in the Western Conference before the shutdown, but winning the 2020 NBA Championship in the NBA bubble. This roster relied heavily on size, with guys like Anthony Davis, Dwight Howard, and Javale McGee all providing big minutes in the playoffs, and even running LeBron James at point guard for a majority of certain games. This LA team also had a great third option in Kyle Kuzma, and a solid bench with players such as KCP, Rajon Rondo, and Alex Caruso. This Lakers team tried to swap out a few pieces in the 2020–21 season to try and repeat with a similar squad, but they ended up getting bounced in the first round by Phoenix, primarily because Anthony Davis got injured in game 4 of the first round. The Los Angeles Lakers would then go on to trade Kyle Kuzma, KCP, and Montrezl Harrell and Russell Westbrook, which is a trade that would spell disaster for the Los Angeles Lakers. Not only did they trade away 2 of their elite shooting and defensive pieces, they also traded away a solid big off the bench in Harrell. Rob Pelinka tried to compensate for their losses by signing Carmelo Anthony and Malik Monk, but that was enough to make up for the fact that Russell Westbrook was a horrible fit for the Los Angeles Lakers. The Lakers wanted Russell Westbrook to be a Chris Paul type player, someone who can facilitate the offense while getting most of their points from the perimeter, but everyone knows that Russell Westbrook is one of the best in the league at scoring in the paint. A team with Anthony Davis and LeBron James getting most of their points in the paint would subsequently clog the paint for Russell Westbrook, which led to Russ being forced to take horrible perimeter shots night after night. While I do think Russell should have improved upon his perimeter game during his tenure at LA, the Lakers were setting themselves up for failure when they asked Russell Westbrook to be anything but. The Los Angeles Clippers allowed Russ to be Russ this past regular season, and as we can all see, Russell Westbrook is a tremendous fit for the Los Angeles Clippers. Westbrook was of course flipped for Malik Beasley, DLO, and Jarred Vanderbilt this past trade deadline, and Pelinka also signed high quality role players such as Rui Hachimura and Mo Bamba. As it stands, The Lakers went from a Play-In team to being up 3–1 against the Golden State Warriors, so it seems that this roster is working out quite well for LeBron James.\n\nThe Truth\n\nWith all three teams fully analyzed, I think it is safe to say that LeBron James has had a solid amount of help throughout the latter end of his career. Look, I am not saying that LeBron James did not take good teams into Championship contenders (because he did), but what I am saying is that it is clear that LeBron did have some help along the way. To me, it is almost an insane narrative to create that LeBron had no help, when he has played with guys like Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, Anthony Davis, Ray Allen, and so on. Being fair, the word help is up to interpretation, because some people could be talking about the performance of those around LeBron in the playoffs instead of just who was around LeBron. That conversation is completely different, and one that I feel would have a little more merit than just saying “James never had a good roster like he does now,” but that would still come down to analyzing the overall impact each of his teammates had in postseason runs with James. If anything, I think the argument is that this is the first time in James’s career that he does not have to be the best player on his team 24/7 in order to win.\n\nConclusion"
