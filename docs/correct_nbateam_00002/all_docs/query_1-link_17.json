        "text": "Jason Miller/Getty Images\n\nLeBron James will face some tough decisions regarding the remainder of his legendary NBA career.\n\nShould the 38-year-old ride out his final years with the Los Angeles Lakers? Look for a roster closer to winning a championship? Give in to Kyrie Irving's wishes and force a trade to the Dallas Mavericks? Join whatever team drafts Bronny next year?\n\nAnother option exists for James as he draws closer to retirement yet still wants to compete for championships: Coming home, again.\n\nA Mutually Beneficial Relationship at Last\n\nLauren Leigh Bacho/NBAE via Getty Images\n\nNearly a decade has passed since the Sports Illustrated article was released announcing James' decision to leave the Miami Heat to return to his hometown Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nIt was a day that rocked the NBA world and changed the Cavs franchise forever.\n\nThere was forgiveness, healing and hope all around, extinguishing a fire that had been raging for the past four years since that infamous July night in 2010. James rode in on a white horse, resuscitating a franchise that won an average of just 24 games per season in the four years he was in South Beach.\n\nThis time, James doesn't need to be a savior.\n\nThis time, coming back would simply be about basketball.\n\nMark Blinch/Getty Images\n\nThere's real star power on this Cavs roster, a group that includes All-Star starter Donovan Mitchell, a pair of 2022 All-Stars in Darius Garland and Jarrett Allen and one of the league's best young big men and third-place finisher for Defensive Player of the Year in Evan Mobley.\n\nThe Cavs just won 51 games and were the No. 1 defensive team in the NBA with a core four that averages 23.8 years in age. All that's missing? An upgrade at small forward, one who can generate some offense after they looked stuck in the mud during their first-round meeting with the New York Knicks.\n\nA starting five of Garland, Mitchell, James, Mobley and Allen would be the best in the East, if not the entire NBA. With the Boston Celtics taking a step back this season, the Philadelphia 76ers possibly losing James Harden to free agency and the Milwaukee Bucks' core growing older, the Cavaliers would quickly take over the conference once again by adding a talent like James to an already impressive young roster.\n\nPerhaps no team is better suited to cover for his weaknesses while elevating James' strengths as well.\n\nHaving two premier playmakers in Mitchell and Garland would ease the load on the veteran, as his usage rate of 33.3 percent was his highest in 14 years. As James becomes less mobile defensively, he'd now have two elite rim protectors behind him in Mobley and Allen.\n\nWhile this hypothetical roster looks great, how exactly would James get to Cleveland?\n\nThis may take some patience.\n\nOptions for James to Return to Cleveland\n\nJason Miller/Getty Images\n\nJames is under contract with the Lakers for one more year at $46.9 million and has a player option for 2024-25 valued at $50.6 million. The only way he is playing for another team this fall is through a trade, which seems incredibly unlikely (much to Irving's dismay).\n\nThe earliest James can leave Los Angeles is next June, or roughly a week after Bronny is likely drafted.\n\nWhen the Cavs traded for Mitchell last September, they agreed to send unprotected first-round picks in 2025, 2027 and 2029 while also including the right to swap first-rounders in 2026 and 2028. Cleveland already owed a first-rounder to the Indiana Pacers this summer.\n\nThis means the only year the Cavaliers didn't surrender full control over their first-round pick between now and the following decade is 2024, when Bronny is draft-eligible and James is free to pick his next team.\n\nCoincidence?\n\nPotentially selecting Bronny James to add to a roster featuring Mitchell, Mobley, Garland and Allen would be one hell of a recruitment, especially since James still owns his Bath Township home just 30 minutes south of downtown Cleveland.\n\nOne of James' closest friends and former high school teammate, Brandon Weems, was promoted to assistant GM of the Cavs last year as well.\n\nThe Cavaliers could attempt to trade for James this summer, although that would mean giving up at least one of the core four members.\n\nWaiting is the best option for Cleveland, letting this young roster soak up one more year of playoff experience.\n\nA Storybook Ending\n\nDavid Liam Kyle/NBAE via Getty Images\n\nJames should continue to play into his 40s, with what appears to be a few All-Star seasons left in him. Joining the Cavs would give him a chance to compete for championships until his final days in the league, whenever that may be.\n\nWhen he finally does decide to retire, he's made it clear what his next chapter will be: ownership.\n\n\"I will own a team someday,\" James said in 2017. \"That's my next thing.\"\n\nWhile he's shown interest in owning an expansion team in Las Vegas, this may be a bit aggressive, even for someone of James' financial status.\n\nThe Las Vegas Raiders' value jumped nearly 50 percent after moving from Oakland, up to $5.1 billion.\n\nJames would likely need to start smaller, perhaps in a market he's familiar with and an ownership group he could study for a few years.\n\nEzra Shaw/Getty Images\n\nThe Cavs are currently ranked a modest 17th in NBA franchise value, according to Forbes, coming in at $2.05 billion. Teams in bigger markets such as the Golden State Warriors, New York Knicks and Los Angeles Lakers are all valued at $5.9 billion or more.\n\nWhile current owner Dan Gilbert has shown no previous interest in selling the team, he's been far more hands-off in the organization the last few years following health concerns. If he did decide to sell in a few years, James could undoubtedly put together a willing ownership group.\n\nJames deserves a proper send-off and retirement tour when he does ultimately decide to hang up his size-15 sneakers. He also deserves to compete for titles until his final season, something not even Michael Jordan or Kobe Bryant could do.\n\nJames will one day go into the Hall of Fame as a Cavalier. It's only fitting he end his career as one, too."
