        "text": "New groups for the 2024 NBA Cup (formerly known as the In-Season Tournament) have been revealed. Chosen by random selection, the Cleveland Cavaliers join Boston, Atlanta, Chicago and Washington in Group C.\n\nIf you need a refresher, the NBA Cup takes place during the early stages of the season. It begins on Nov. 12 with the “Group Play” stage. During this phase, Cleveland will play regular season matches against each other team in Group C. The team with the best record from each group (eight teams) will advance to the Knockout Rounds with a single-elimination format setting the stage for semi-finals and finals in Las Vegas.\n\nThe tournament was a success last season with new stakes leading to highly competitive regular season games. A prize pool is allocated to every player that reaches the Knockout Round with increased incentives for the teams that advance the farthest.\n\nThe Cavaliers did not qualify for last year’s Knockout Round as the Indiana Pacers swept their group with a 4-0 record. Tyrese Haliburton enjoyed a breakout on this newly formed stage, leading his team to the tournament finals before being bested by LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers. The hype and popularity of the NBA Cup should only grow as we witness more coming-out parties for young stars across the league.\n\nCleveland’s current group is an interesting one. The Boston Celtics pose a clear threat but how much effort will the defending NBA champs exert when they are more focused on going back-to-back? Meanwhile the rest of the group is lacking in firepower. Chicago, Atlanta and Washington all missed the playoffs last year and will likely spend another season in the lottery.\n\nA 4-0 record is certainly on the table if the Cavs manage to defeat Boston during Group Play. From there, the Knockout Rounds would allow Cleveland to potentially taste a little more “postseason” success before running it back again in April. Opportunities like that are what the NBA Cup was made for."
