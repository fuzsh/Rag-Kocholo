        "text": "Nets 21 points on nine shots\n\nTyson was coming off a 2-of-6 shooting performance, but he got things back on track in this one, finishing 6-of-9 from the field and 8-of-9 at the stripe. Overall, Tyson has looked pretty good in Las Vegas, so it'll be interesting to see if the 21-year-old can immediately earn a sizable role in Cleveland. He'll be someone to keep an eye on over training camp and the preseason.\n\nStuffs stat sheet in SL\n\nPorter paced Cleveland in assists and trailed only Emoni Bates in points. Porter is entering his second NBA season, and figures to play a semi-regular role off the bench for the Cavs after averaging 5.6 points, 2.3 assists and 2.1 rebounds across 12.7 minutes in 51 games as a rookie.\n\nFully cleared to play\n\nPorter suffered a season-ending ankle injury back on April 14th, but he's been able to fully participate at practice with no complications. Porter played some key rotation minutes for the Cavaliers in 2023-24, and he's likely to be a featured player for them during the Summer League."
