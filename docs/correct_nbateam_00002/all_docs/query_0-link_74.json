        "text": "You certainly can't fault the 18-year-old's confidence.\n\nDonovan Mitchell trade rumors still swirling ahead of the NBA draft\n\nWhile the Cavs star guard is obviously not a prospect on the big board in this year's draft, Mitchell's name continues to crop up in trade rumors ahead of the draft as rival teams gauge what Cleveland wants to do with its roster.\n\nIf the Cavs can't come to terms on a long-term deal to keep \"Spida\" in town, the logical next step would be to trade Mitchell so he doesn't bolt in free agency for no return.\n\nScotto included in his breakdown of the Houston Rockets (who select third overall in this year's draft) that they've been seen as a possible trade suitor for Mitchell — perhaps including the aforementioned top-three selection in a possible deal.\n\nHouston could stand pat at No. 3 in an attempt to select a future star to keep building, but adding an established All-Star caliber talent via trade makes sense, too.\n\nWho is going to select Bronny James in the 2024 NBA draft?\n\nLeBron's son remains a bit of an enigma coming out of USC, where he didn't put up big numbers after first having to be cleared by doctors after suffering a cardiac health event last year. Bronny James is nothing if not polarizing in terms of a draft prospect.\n\nAs a freshman at USC, Bronny averaged 4.8 points, 2.8 rebounds and 2.1 assists. While those numbers leave a lot to be desired for an NBA hopeful, ESPN’s Brian Windhorst relayed on ESPN's “Get Up” that league scouts hold Bronny in higher esteem than his stats would otherwise indicate.\n\nSo, where is the son of arguably the sport's greatest player ever going to get selected?\n\nNBA rumors: Los Angeles Lakers willing to draft Bronny James to keep LeBron | Report\n\nAs the rumor mill continues to hint, HoopsHype's aggregate mock has Bronny getting taken at No. 55 overall in the second round by who else but the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nWhether the Lakers brass is serious about pairing LeBron with his son in southern California remains to be seen, but The Athletic's Shams Charania has reported that of the 10 workout invites Bronny received, he's only considering the Lakers and Phoenix Suns.\n\nHere's what Scotto wrote for HoopsHype:\n\n“I feel like this is a serious business, and I don’t feel like there would be a thought of, ‘I’m just drafting this kid just because I’m going to get his dad,’” Bronny said at the NBA Draft Combine. “I don’t think a GM would really allow that. I think I’ve put in the work, and I’d get drafted because of not only the player but the person that I am.”\n\nOnly time will tell if Bronny and his pops will suit up for the same NBA team next season but, again, it's always fun for fans to speculate."
