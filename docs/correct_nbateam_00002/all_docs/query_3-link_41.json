        "text": "Maverick Carter, the CEO of SpringHill Company, is a longtime friend, manager and business associate of LeBron James. He has shaped James’ business portfolio and international profile, helping the King become one of the world’s highest paid athletes (James ranked sixth on Sportico’s 2023 list of highest-paid athletes of all time).\n\nAll the while, Carter has proved himself as a capable businessman in his own right.\n\nWho is Maverick Carter?\n\nCarter is a media personality, executive producer and entrepreneur, and he co-founded production company SpringHill Company with James in 2020. The Hollywood-based entertainment development company was behind movies such as Netflix’s Hustle and Warner Bros.’ Space Jam: A New Legacy, among others.\n\nHe grew up in Atlanta and in Akron, Ohio, the same community as James; he also played basketball and football at St. Vincent-St. Mary High School. Carter and James led their basketball team to an undefeated season when Carter was a senior and LeBron was a freshman. Carter earned a scholarship to play hoops at Western Michigan but ultimately ended up transferring to the University of Akron.\n\nSoon after, Carter embarked on a journey assisting James to billionaire status.\n\nAfter interning and working for Nike during the early years of James’ NBA career, he later launched sports marketing firm LRMR Management Company in 2006 alongside agent Rich Paul and Randy Mims.\n\nWhat is Maverick Carter famous for?\n\nCarter, 43, is known for being James’ business manager since 2006. He has been involved in many marketing and investment deals for James over the years, establishing relationships with key brands from Nike to Coca-Cola. Carter was one of the key masterminds behind The Decision, an ESPN TV special which saw James, a free agent at the time, announce that he was leaving the Cleveland Cavaliers to sign with the Miami Heat in 2010. He also took a major role in the creation of The LeBrons, a series of Nike commercials for James’ shoes that featured caricatures of the future Hall of Fame player.\n\nCarter, who was nominated for Outstanding Unstructured Reality Program in 2011 for his role behind the Disney+ series Becoming, is the executive producer and co-host of talk show The Shop with Paul Rivera, which airs on HBO. Under SpringHill Entertainment, the Uninterrupted CEO has produced hit shows like ‘Survivor’s Remorse’ and ‘The Wall’.\n\nLast month, Carter launched a YouTube series called Mavericks with Mav Carter, which features one-on-one interviews with the biggest names in entertainment from rapper Jeezy to Kerry Washington.\n\nWhat is Maverick Carter’s net worth?\n\nCarter has a net worth of more than $60 million, according to multiple reports.\n\nHow did Maverick Carter make his money?\n\nCarter and James have been involved in a number of business ventures together through LRMR Ventures, which is James’ family office. LRMR has invested in Major League Pickleball, Canyon Bikes and Blaze Pizza, among other companies.\n\nNotably, Carter helped broker a deal in 2011 between LRMR and Fenway Sports Group that secured him and James a minority stake in English Premier League soccer club Liverpool. That 1% share increased heavily over the last decade to an estimated $7 million."
