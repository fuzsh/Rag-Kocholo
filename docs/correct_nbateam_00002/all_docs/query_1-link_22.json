        "text": "CLEVELAND – Tristan Thompson has been here before with the Cleveland Cavaliers post-LeBron James. And he’s here again.\n\nThe common theme: When James leaves the Cavaliers – as he did in 2010 and 2018 – the franchise is left in his wake facing serious issues.\n\nCleveland was 19-63, 21-45, 24-58 and 33-49 in the four seasons following his departure eight years ago, and Thompson was there for three of them, joining the Cavs as a rookie in 2011.\n\nThis season, after James left Cleveland for the Los Angeles Lakers in free agency, the Cavs started 0-6 and fired coach Tyronn Lue. Interim coach Larry Drew wanted to restructure his contract, All-Star forward Kevin Love is out long term with a toe injury, former assistant coach Jim Boylan filed an age discrimination lawsuit against the team, veterans bickered about rookie Collin Sexton, and JR Smith wants out. He may get his wish; the Cavs said Tuesday that Smith is no longer with the team as they try to move him.\n\nSo, things are not going well for the 2-13 Cavaliers, who have the worst record in the NBA and Wednesday play host to James and the Lakers.\n\n“I’ve been here long enough so I’ve seen it all,” Thompson said.\n\nCleveland is trying to find bright spots, all of them in the future. The team is going through a transformation. They are renovating Quicken Loans Arena and rebuilding the team, and the NBA just rewarded the franchise with the 2022 All-Star Game.\n\nThe Cavs hope to be in a much better place by then. They drafted Sexton with the No. 8 overall pick in June, and if they continue to play this way, they will have a good chance at drafting one of Duke’s trio of talented freshmen – R.J. Barrett, Cam Reddish and Zion Williamson. And with Love locked into a contract extension through the 2022-23 season, Cleveland may trade him at some point for another first-round pick.\n\nThis is Cleveland’s – and owner Dan Gilbert’s – chance to rebuild without the idea of in-his-prime James returning to guarantee a contending team.\n\n“Of course, it’s tough because you want to win every game,” Thompson said. “But this season, it’s bigger than wins and losses, and you want to see the development. You want to see guys getting better.”\n\nMORE:\n\nThe King returns: Remembering LeBron's vitriolic 2010 Heat game\n\nPay attention: Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks are the real deal\n\nBedlam in the Bay: Kevin Durant fined for hurling expletives at fan sitting courtside\n\nThompson was once the young player trying to find his way in the NBA. Now, he’s the veteran trying to help the young players, including Sexton, Cedi Osman and Ante Zizic.\n\n“You have to be patient,” Thompson said. “You look at it as baby steps trying to get better. That’s how I approach it. When you’re trying to figure it out or going through ruts, the most important (thing) is playing the game the right way and developing winning habits.”\n\n'We're going to take bumps and bruises'\n\nThat’s what Drew, 60, is here to do. He’s a veteran NBA coach, and combined with his playing days, is a basketball lifer. He’s not rattled by Cleveland’s chaotic situation.\n\n“I’ve been in this thing for a few years, and I can say I’ve seen it all,” Drew said. “I’ve been in this situation before. The most important thing is you understand this business side of it. As far as questioning why certain things happen, I learned years ago to stop doing that. Just try to move on as fast as you can. Given what our situation has been, that’s exactly what I did.”\n\nAt the heart of Smith’s disgruntlement is the playing time allocated to veterans, including Kyle Korver. Smith wants minutes, and that’s just not going to happen with any consistency.\n\n“We want to develop our younger guys,” Drew said. “How do you develop? By playing and we’re going to take some bumps and bruises with those guys as far as mistakes are concerned and we’re willing to do that.”\n\nStory continues below gallery\n\nSo, the Cavs are focused on the future. But that hasn’t stopped the hand-wringing about James’ second departure. In a story on The Athletic, James said he opposed the team’s decision to trade Kyrie Irving before the 2017-18 season. The Cavs’ front office wanted a long-term commitment from James before going in that direction, and James would not do that. Given that, Cavs general manager Koby Altman and Gilbert didn’t see a resolution to Irving’s adamant desire to get out.\n\nThe Cavs’ run of Finals appearances was bound to end. Was there a way to squeeze out one more title before it fell apart? That’s hard to argue considering how dominant the Golden State Warriors have been, with three titles in four years.\n\nRegardless, the walls started to crumble well before Irving wanted out and James decided to leave. Following Cleveland’s loss to Golden State in the 2017 Finals and just before the draft, Gilbert decided he wouldn’t bring back general manager David Griffin. At the time, Griffin was working to add another player who could potentially help the Cavs better compete with Golden State.\n\nIt never happened. James is gone. So is Irving, Smith and Griffin.\n\nThe Cavaliers are picking up the pieces once again.\n\nJames' departure hurts more than Cavs\n\nThe Cavaliers remain in the top 10 in NBA attendance, checking in at No. 8 with an average of 19,423 fans per game. The Cavs were No. 2 last season at 20,562 per game. Several NBA teams, including the Cavs, persuade fans to commit to the following season’s ticket plan in order to get the current season’s playoff tickets.\n\nIt will be interesting to see where the Cavs are next season -- and the season after that.\n\nThe Cavs dropped from second to third in James’ first season with Miami but fell to 19th in 2011-12 and 22nd in 2012-13. When he returned in 2014, the Cavs vaulted to No. 2.\n\nJames’ loss impacts more than the team, too. When a team is bad, there is a lack of interest. James was appointment viewing, and not only did he put fans in seats, he put fans in downtown bars and restaurants.\n\nWinking Lizard Tavern co-owner John Lane went through it when James left in 2010 and is going through it again. His place, which has a stellar beer selection and fun food options, is just steps from Quicken Loans Arena.\n\n“When you lose a player like that, there’s not really a substitute, and we’ve only won two games, so it’s going to have an impact,” Lane said.\n\nHe estimates the Winking Lizard is seeing a 25 percent decrease on game nights without James playing for the Cavs.\n\n“When we first went downtown, we always figured events were icing on that cake,” he said. “You’ve got to have the cake first. You have to have that regular business first. When you have a great player like LeBron, that’s the icing.”\n\nDavid Gilbert is the president and CEO of the Greater Cleveland Sports Commission. Since 2000, the commission has brought more than 190 sporting events to northeast Ohio, which have generated nearly $670 million in economic impact, according to the commission.\n\nGilbert doesn’t deny the impact James has had on the identity of the city and region.\n\n“In a broad sense, LeBron’s identity for the past 12 or more years has a strong tie to Cleveland and northeast Ohio,” Gilbert said. “When you have one of, if not the most, recognizable and talented athletes on the planet, he’s tied to the community not just because he plays there but he’s from there. What LeBron may have done more than anything is help elevate local pride.”\n\nWhile the commission brings mostly amateur events to the area, it is working with the Cleveland Indians on the 2019 All-Star Game and the Cavs, which was just awarded the 2022 NBA All-Star Game.\n\nGilbert and his staff will continue to attract events regardless of where James plays. The area has the infrastructure (arenas, hotels, convention space) to accommodate.\n\n“The community rallies around these events in order to make them successful as any place in the country,\" Gilbert said. \"... In the NCAA and Olympic worlds, Cleveland punches way above its weight in terms of quantity and quality of events.”\n\nLane said he’s making up for some lost business with a long-dormant revenue stream.\n\n“The positive is the Browns,” Lane said. “We have interest in football again so our Sunday business is way up.”"
