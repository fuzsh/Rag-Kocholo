        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio – What do DeSagana Diop and Peja Stojakovic have in common? When the Cleveland Cavaliers and Sacramento Kings opened the 2003 season, they had a front-row seat to watch 18-year-old LeBron James take the court in an NBA game for the first time.\n\nIt was Oct. 29, 2003, when Cleveland played Sacramento at Arco Arena. James started and led all scorers with 25 points. The rest of James’ line: Six rebounds, nine assists, four steals, two turnovers and three personal fouls. He was 12-of-20 shooting."
