Price fell to 2-6 with an 8.43 ERA in nine starts against New York.\n\nRead Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert’s statement on LeBron James leaving:\n\nThe last time LeBron James left Cleveland, Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert penned an incredible Comic Sans open letter to the team’s fans that denounced the “cowardly betrayal” and personally guaranteed the Cavs would win a championship before their former hero. The tone — and font — were very different this time around.\n\nJames agreed to a four-year, $153 million deal with the Los Angeles Lakers. In an Instagram story, the 33-year-old superstar thanked his hometown. He posted a picture from Cleveland’s 2016 NBA title parade, writing, “Thank you Northeast Ohio for an incredible 4 seasons. This will always be home.”\n\nThat title was the first thing Gilbert mentioned in his letter, as he thanked James for agreeing to “come back home and lead the Cavaliers to the promised land.” As James once again takes his talents to a sunnier locale, Gilbert wished him and his family “nothing but the best” and hinted at a jersey retirement ceremony in the future.\n\nHere’s the full statement from Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert:\n\n“We will always remember the evening of June 19, 2016 as the Cleveland Cavaliers, led by LeBron James, ended the 52-year drought delivering the long elusive championship that many thought they would never see… A championship that united generations of Clevelanders, both living and passed.\n\nVirtually anyone with roots in Northeast Ohio paused and felt the memories of the past and the utter joy that the burden of the so-called ‘curse’ was finally a thing of the past. Cleveland, Ohio was the home of a championship team for the first time since 1964. Words do not express the meaning and the feeling this accomplishment brought to the people of Northeast Ohio.\n\nNone of this would have happened if LeBron James did not agree to come back home and lead the Cavaliers to the promised land. The entire Cavaliers franchise thanks LeBron for that precious moment and for all of the excitement he delivered as he led our team to four straight NBA Finals appearances.\n\nLeBron is a family man, first. We wish his kids, his wife Savannah, his mother Gloria, and LeBron himself nothing but the best in the years and decades ahead. LeBron’s connection to Akron, Cleveland and all of Northeast Ohio will most certainly endure as his commitment to the region and his support of many important causes has been impactful to so many kids and families.\n\nLeBron, you came home and delivered the ultimate goal. Nothing but appreciation and gratitude for everything you put into every moment you spent in a Cavaliers uniform. We look forward to the retirement of the famous #23 Cavs jersey one day down the line…”\n\nDan Gilbert\n\nChairman\n\nCleveland Cavaliers\n\nRobert Williams misses flight, first summer league practice: The Celtics draft pick missed his flight from Louisiana to Boston and did not attend the team’s first summer league session. Williams, who fell to No. 27 due to concerns about his character, also overslept his introductory conference call.\n\n“Yeah, I think everyone’s disappointed,” Celtics summer league coach Jay Larranaga said. “You want to get everything off to a good start on the first day, but we’ll handle that internally and move forward.” (Boston.com)\n\nThe Celtics have reportedly made their first move in NBA free agency: Aron Baynes agreed to a two-year, $11 million contract that will keep him in Boston. On Sunday, the center tweeted that last season added fuel to the fire, writing,”Staying where I wanted to be!!” (Boston.com)\n\n5 things to know about Tuukka Rask’s new backup: The Bruins agreed to a two-year contract with journeyman goaltender Jaroslav Halak, who will likely assume Anton Khudobin’s former role as Tuukka Rask’s backup. Halak has twice finished in the top 10 in Vezina Trophy voting and this won’t be his first time playing alongside Zdeno Chara.
