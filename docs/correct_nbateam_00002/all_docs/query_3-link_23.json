        "text": "My memories of those days was -- you know, every day that you woke up, you knew it was going to be a struggle. For me, already being part of a single parent household and knowing it was just me and my mom, you'd would wake up times and hope that the next day you'd be able to be alongside your mother because she was out trying to make sure that I was taken care of. But all I cared about was her being home.\n\nThey made me get up every day and go to school. There were days I didn't want to go to school. Being part of a family, a mom-and-dad surrounding … you had a brother and you had two sisters … it was an unbelievable experience for me at a young age. It opened my eyes up to become what I am today, why I act the way I am today.\n\nThis year, he forgot about the critics and just played the game the way he's been taught to play it, the way he's enjoyed playing it. He understood what the team need from him and he made those changes. He did the kinds of things he did growing up and in high school -- he did whatever his team needed. That was big.\n\nWhen you stay focused on the things you can control -- your attitude and your effort -- and you let all that other stuff go, you can make those kinds of strides. You've seen him grow up a lot.\n\nI sat him down and I said, 'Look you can stop me anytime you want. If you think I'm overstepping my bounds, you can stop me.' I just hit him with going back to the beginning, going back to the basics, doing things that he didn't want to do -- like rebounding, playing in the post, moving without the ball. But mostly about just the mental side of handling the criticism and trying to play through misses and getting on to the next play, not letting plays bother him or games bother him or anything bother him and just playing again, having fun playing.\n\nHe was great. I talked to him about being coachable. I have a theory that people may wander off their course, but they are who they are. He's always been a coachable guy, a guy who wanted to win and play the right way. I knew that he could get back to where he wanted to get. But he had to look himself in the mirror. He agreed with me. I give him a lot of credit for that. He already knew.\n\n“I say, ‘Jimmy, let me get 15 pair.’ He’s like, ‘Mav, these aren’t on the market yet. I don’t even know if I have 15 in my office. I say, ‘Jimmy, let me get 15 pair and watch what I do with them.’ ”\n\nIovine obliges. Carter gives the headphones to James, instructs the two-time NBA MVP to gift them to his 2008 Olympic teammates as they board their flight to China. As he presents the headphones, James shares a short speech that touches on the significance of their journey and how the Beats symbolize the sincerity of their commitment to put team goals ahead of individual ones.\n\nWhen the Redeem Team deplaned in Beijing, the international press awaited LeBron, Kobe, D-Wade, ’Melo and D12. A paparazzi-like contingent of still and television cameras captured their arrival. Fifteen new pairs of Beats draped the heads and necks of the world’s most recognizable athletes as they conducted their initial, impromptu Olympic interviews.\n\nCarter engineered the ultimate product placement, a genius, massive, free advertising campaign.\n\nHe'd accompany James to hoop camps and tournaments. They'd spend hours doing pushups and talking about everything from being considered just another inner-city kid to the importance of respecting your mother regardless of her past. \"I was always picking his mind, and he was always picking mine,\" James says.\n\nShortly after James was drafted, he called Paul one afternoon and asked for his Social Security number. Paul had no idea what James was up to, but about a week later he received a check from King James Inc. It was his first two weeks' pay. There was no plan -- certainly no business plan -- in place then, but James was confident they'd figure it out along the way. \"I just felt like Rich was someone I wanted to grow with,\" James says. \"He'd always kept it real with me, and I wanted him to be down with my team.\"\n\n“I just thought he'd be a hometown hero for his era and it would be over. He was a normal high school senior,\" she says, though he was featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated before he even graduated. Then, during her senior year—and James's rookie year in the NBA—she discovered she was pregnant. It was not planned, she says. \"I was thinking, 'What am I going to tell my parents? What's going to happen to his career?'\"\n\nMike Brown is a great coach. He gave us success that we hadn’t had before in that city. It just started with his defensive concepts. He brought in a defensive mindset that we didn’t have. … We were competitive year after year because of him and his coaching staff. I respect him and I’m grateful to have him as a coach throughout the years that I had him. He definitely helped me to become who I am today.\n\nThe same declaration from almost any other man would mean little to most. Everyone has opinions about who the true G.O.A.T is and most of them are framed by a generational bias that is hard to shake. But when a man with a breadth of experience that travels through time, or at least the past 46 years, points a finger at someone, it wakes you up.\n\nWhen it seems like the world is crashing down on us, he's always like, 'We're gonna get through it. It starts with me and we're all going to get through it. Let's just stay focused and continue to grind, James says. Then things would get better. You respect that. When your general doesn't panic, no matter what the situation is, then the rest of the soldiers don't panic either.\n\nAnd that’s why, to go through this journey, and he had to get out of his comfort zone, to leave the place where he grew up, start fresh with a new team and many people would not have had the courage to go through that, and then to go through all those trials and tribulations to get to this point—he’s earned it and we’re so proud of him.\n\nIt’s not a bed of roses with me and (Wade) and (Chris Bosh). We get on each other if we feel like they’re not doing their job. We feel like it is constructive criticism that we need to have for one another to have a productive team. Anytime you have new teammates, it doesn’t matter if you’re friends or not, you have to realize certain people react to certain situations. Some people can be yelled at and still play, some people you have to do it in a certain way."
