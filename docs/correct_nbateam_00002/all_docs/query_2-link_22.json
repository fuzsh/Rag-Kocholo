        "text": "NBA superstar LeBron James and his longtime business partner Maverick Carter will be part-owners of the Boston Red Sox, a person familiar with the details told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nThe person requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly until the deal is official.\n\nJames and Carter became partners in Fenway Sports Group, which owns the Red Sox, Liverpool FC of the English Premier League, Roush Fenway Racing, regional sports network NESN, Fenway Sports Management and FSG Real Estate.\n\nThe Red Sox portion of the deal is subject to Major League Baseball approval. John Henry is the principal owner and Thomas Werner the chairman of Fenway Sports Group.\n\nPrior to this investment, James owned a small share of Liverpool FC.\n\nJames, who has worn a New York Yankees hat before, and Carter will be FSG’s first Black partners, The Boston Globe reported.\n\nWhile James stars for the Los Angeles Lakers – he won his fourth NBA championship and fourth Finals MVP last season – he continues to expand his business and media relationships.\n\nHe has a lifetime deal with Nike that could exceed $1 billion, is prepping for the summer release of \"Space Jam: A New Legacy\" and his SpringHill Entertainment develops and produces other entertainment. He owns Blaze Pizza franchises and has partnerships with AT&T and a recently reached an agreement with Pepsi.\n\nAccording to Forbes, James is the fifth high-paid athlete in the world at nearly $95 million a year -- $64 million of which comes from endorsement deals, the magazine said.\n\nJames has said it’s an aspiration to own an NBA team one day. League rules prohibit from any ownership while he’s still playing.\n\n“I believe if I wanted to, I could own a team or be part of a basketball team,” James said at the 2019 All-Star Weekend in Charlotte, North Carolina. “I know I got so much knowledge of the game that I don't want to – once I stop playing – get away from the game.”\n\nMichael Jordan is the owner of the Charlotte Hornets, and Magic Johnson once owned a small percentage of the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n“It would have to be the right fit,” James said two years ago. “It'd have to be the right city. It'd have to be the right situation. It's not like it's a dream of mine. It's more of an aspiration. See if it happens. If it don't, I won't be disappointed in anything I've done off the floor. We'll see what happens.”"
