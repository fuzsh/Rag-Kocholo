        "text": "It’s no secret the Sixers want to make some big moves over the summer and one of the team’s potential targets looks to be LeBron James.\n\nIf Philly can’t land Clippers All-Star veteran Paul George, then LeBron is one of the names on the franchise’s list, Sixers insider Keith Pompey reports.\n\n“The Sixers do have their eyes on other lucrative-salary impact players just in case they don’t get George,” Pompey said. “That’s why they also are looking at potential free agents like the Los Angeles Lakers’ LeBron James and New York Knicks forward OG Anunoby. If not in free agency, the Sixers believe they can use their draft assets and available cap space to acquire a difference-maker via a trade. That has led to Miami Heat forward Jimmy Butler, Chicago Bulls guard Zach LaVine, and New Orleans Pelicans forward Brandon Ingram being among trade interests.”\n\nNBA personality Bill Simmons proposed a scenario that involves both LeBron and PG-13 switching teams essentially, during a recent episode of his podcast.\n\n“Here’s the solution for all of us with Paul George: a double sign-and-trade with the Lakers,” Simmons said on The Bill Simmons Show. “LeBron gets to stay in L.A. but he goes to the Clippers to open the new stadium and finish his career there. Paul George gets to finally play with the Lakers after it was blocked by Adam Silver a couple years ago, and finally he gets to be a Laker. And it gets to be him and A.D. (Anthony Davis) and JJ Redick and we’re off. It’s a new era for the Lakers. Kind of fun.”\n\nLeBron’s agent Rich Paul recently declared that the league’s all-time greatest scorer will become a free agent this summer.\n\nSo, expect the LeBron trade rumors to be constant this offseason."
