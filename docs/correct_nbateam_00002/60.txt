This item is final sale and not eligible for return.

LeBron James fulfilled his promise to the city of Cleveland by leading the Cavaliers to the 2016 NBA championship. After James infamously left Cleveland for Miami in free agency in 2010, the Cavaliers struggled for the next four years. But King James’ triumphant return catapulted the team back into relevancy. In 2017, James and the Cavs sought to defend the city’s first major sports championship in 52 years.

Following a 51–31 regular season, the 2nd-seeded Cavs faced the 7th-seeded Indiana Pacers in the first round. James wore this navy Adidas jersey in Game 4, which took place on April 23, 2017. LeBron scored 33 points and added 10 rebounds and 4 assists in a 106–102 Cavaliers victory.

James and the Cavs swept the Pacers in four games. They went on to reach their third consecutive NBA Finals before falling to the Golden State Warriors.

The jersey is accompanied by a photomatch letter from The MeiGray Group.
