Pictures\n\nThe Vitaphone Corporation\n\nRelease date\n\nRunning time\n\n7 minutesLanguageEnglish\n\nBirth of a Notion is a 1947 Warner Bros. Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Bob Clampett and Robert McKimson.[3] The cartoon was released on April 12, 1947, and stars Daffy Duck.[4]\n\nDaffy, unlike his avian counterparts, declines migration southward for winter and orchestrates his winter stay with Leopold, a credulous dog, by feigning a life-saving act. However, complications arise when confronted with Leopold's master, a scientist fixated on acquiring a duck's furcula for an experiment.\n\nDaffy's disdain for the scientist's demand leads to a failed assassination endeavor, prompting the scientist to retaliate with lethal traps. Meanwhile, Leopold experiences alienation amidst the chaos. Ultimately, Daffy departs, but the scientist settles for a dog's wishbone, prompting Leopold's departure as well. Daffy's attempt at infiltrating another abode is thwarted by a Joe Besser-esque grey duck, resulting in Daffy's inadvertent flight southward, where he discovers Leopold, equipped with a makeshift flying apparatus, accompanying him.\n\nDirector Robert McKimson employs his character design of \"Barnyard Dawg\" to portray Leopold, the canine companion of the mad scientist, with the scientist himself rendered as a caricature, visually and vocally reminiscent of Peter Lorre.\n\nThe title, Birth of a Notion, alludes to The Birth of a Nation, though no thematic connection exists between the two films.\n\nThis short was initially slated for direction by Bob Clampett, alongside Bacall to Arms and The Goofy Gophers, both of which were ultimately completed by Arthur Davis following Clampett's departure from Warner Bros."
