        "text": "Yesterday, Max subscribers received their monthly email announcing what’s coming to the platform—and what’s leaving. Fans of Looney Tunes—already smarting over Warner Bros.’ recent decision to shelve the completed feature Coyote vs. Acme; the film’s now seeking distribution elsewhere—were dismayed to see that the classic cartoon was listed under December’s departing titles.\n\nToday, however, the streamer sent out a revised email with the series restored, noting at the top “Looney Tunes was included in error as a title leaving the platform. This is not the case and the show will continue streaming on Max.”\n\nMax subscribers can currently access 15 seasons of Looney Tunes, featuring cartoons dating back to the 1930s, as part of the streamer’s library, which also includes another show that was mistakenly on the departure list: The Looney Tunes Show, circa 2011-2012. If you’re a fan of 2003’s Looney Tunes: Back in Action, the 2003 heist comedy in which Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck co-star with Brendan Fraser and Jenna Elfman, you’d better watch it before December; it’s the only Looney Tunes-adjacent project now slated to leave the streamer."
