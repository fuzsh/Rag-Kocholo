        "text": "I'm a huge fan of the classic Looney Tunes animated series, but Warner Bros. has yet to make a decent feature film adaptation of it that combines live-action and animation. The last Looney Tunes movie they made was Back in Action made in 2003, before that there was Space Jam in 1996. I wasn't a big fan of either of these films, but they're going to give it yet another try. Once again it will be a hybrid live-action/CG film.\n\nThe studio has hired former SNL cast member Jenny Slate to write the script, and they've also brought on David Katzenberg and Seth Grahame-Smith, the author of Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter, and Tim Burton's Dark Shadows script. Harry Potter producer David Heyman is also on board the project.\n\nThere seems to be some solid talent attached to the project, but I'm not going to hold my breath for a good movie. They just can't seem to get it right. As of right now no plot details have been released, but it's sure to include several characters from the animated series that include Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd and several other characters."
