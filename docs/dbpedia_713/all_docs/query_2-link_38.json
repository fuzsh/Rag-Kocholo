        "text": "In what was one of the most anticipated presentations of the week, Warner Bros. Animation (WBA) today unveiled the first batch of finished shorts from the upcoming series Looney Tunes Cartoons in front of a standing-room only crowd at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival. One of the shorts screened during the presentation was “Dynamite Dance,” directed by David Gemmill. Warner’s released a special excerpt of that film today:\n\nIn addition to screening multiple shorts, executive producer Pete Browngardt and supervising producer Alex Kirwan gave Annecy attendees a behind-the-scenes look inside the program’s production process.\n\nLooney Tunes Cartoons kicked off its week at Annecy as part of the Opening Ceremony festivities, with shorts screening in front of the festival’s opening night film, Playmobil: The Movie, as well as during the festival’s open-air screenings.\n\nAbout Looney Tunes Cartoons\n\nLooney Tunes Cartoons is a series of new short form cartoons starring the iconic and beloved Looney Tunes characters. With a crew of some of the premier artists working in animation today, each “season” will produce 1,000 minutes of all-new Looney Tunes animation that will be distributed across multiple platforms — including digital, mobile and broadcast.\n\nLooney Tunes Cartoons echoes the high production value and process of the original Looney Tunes theatrical shorts, with a cartoonist-driven approach to storytelling. Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig and other marquee Looney Tunes characters will be featured in their classic pairings in simple, gag-driven and visually vibrant stories. Each cartoon will vary from one to six minutes in length and, from the premise on through to the jokes, will be “written” and drawn by the cartoonists, allowing their own personality and style to come through in each cartoon."
