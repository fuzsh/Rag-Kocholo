        "text": "Since Looney Tunes is big around around here, I decided to have this as its own thread, rather than always having to use the \"News & Discussion\" thread. These are mostly in alphabetical order, so here's this week's schedule of rarely aired Looney Tunes shorts:\n\nAugust 1st, 7:30 AM EST: 3 Ring Wing-Ding, Ali Baba Bunny, Acrobatty Bunny, A-Haunting We Will Go, Ain't We Got Fun, Aloha Hooey, Along Came Daffy, Along Flirtation Walk\n\nAugust 2nd, 7:30 AM EST: Baby Bottleneck, Aqua Duck, Aristo Cat, Alpine Antics, Aviation Vacation, At Your Service Madame\n\nAugust 3rd, 7:30 AM EST: Bashful Buzzard, Beanstalk Bunny, Bars and Stripes Forever, Bartholomew Versus the Wheel, Backwoods Bunny, A Bear for Punishment\n\nAugust 4th, 7:30 AM EST: Bee-Deviled Bruin, Bear's Tale, Behind the Meatball, Beauty and the Beast, Believe It or Else, Bedtime for Sniffles\n\nAugust 5th, 7:30 AM EST: Big House Bunny, Big Game Haunt, Bingo Crosbyana, Bird Came C.O.D., Billboard Frolics\n\nAugust 6th, 6:00 AM EST: Boyhood Daze, Booby Hatched, A Broken Leghorn, Brother Brat, Brave Little Bat, Boulevardier from the Bronx, Book Revue\n\nAugust 7th, 6:00 AM EST: Bushy Hare, Calling Dr. Porky, Bugs Bunny Gets the Boid, Busy Bakers, Cagey Canary, Bugs Bunny and the Three Bears, Bugsy and Mugsy, Buckaroo Bugs, Bug Parade\n\nIf I missed anything, or made any mistakes, please let me know. I'll post next week's schedule later.\n\nI think \"Acrobatty Bunny\" which has already played this morning could still be added to Monday's rare cartoons -- there was one circus cartoon with Bugs and Bruno (a bear into the cartoon \"Big Top Bunny\") - but this cartoon was with a lion. I know that one at least wasn't part of the endless rotation - Don't know if that's why you didn't mention it or if you may have thought it was another cartoon. --- In any case, of 10 cartoons today to begin this ABC order fun, only 2 of which have been part of the regular rotation which is a great start for this.\n\nI also did a count of 73 total cartoons airing this week. 10 today, 9 tomorrow, 10 Wednesday, 8 Thursday, 10 Friday, 13 Saturday and 13 Sunday. So after 73 cartoons for the whole week we'll only be 2 cartoons into the letter \"C\". Good stuff.\n\nThese are the first couple day's titles next week -- the ones with an * after them indicate that they've been with us a while that I could tell apart - which is only 2 on Monday. Someone can help confirm. I typed them in ABC order off the boom backdoor.\n\nMonday August 8th\n\nBirdy and the Beast\n\nBirth of a Notion\n\nBlooper Bunny *\n\nBlow Out\n\nA Bone for a Bone\n\nMad as a Mars Hare *\n\nMartian Through Georgia\n\nMeatless Friday\n\nMerlin the Magic Mouse\n\nMerry Old Soul\n\nTuesday August 9th\n\nA Message to Gracias\n\nMexicali Shmoes\n\nMexican Borders\n\nMexican Cat Dance\n\nMexican Joyride\n\nMexican Mousepiece\n\nMice Will Play\n\nMilk and Honey\n\nMixed Master\n\nYes, I'm pretty sure out of those shorts, \"Blooper Bunny\" and \"Mad as a Mars Hare\" are the only ones that already regularly air on Boomerang. I believe \"A Bone for a Bone\" is the only short with the Goofy Gophers that never aired as part of the current rotation, so that will be nice to see. And wow, they will be playing quite a few Speedy shorts soon.\n\nYes, I'm pretty sure out of those shorts, \"Blooper Bunny\" and \"Mad as a Mars Hare\" are the only ones that already regularly air on Boomerang.

And wow, they will be playing quite a few Speedy shorts soon.\n\nI'm honestly surprised that they're airing Mexican Joyride and Milk and Honey.\n\nAlso, A Bone for a Bone has played on the channel more than once. I've seen it tons of times.\n\nThese are the first couple day's titles next week -- the ones with an * after them indicate that they've been with us a while that I could tell apart - which is only 2 on Monday.

This aired this morning. I must have been confusing it with another Foghorn Leghorn short. Anyway, here's next week's schedule:\n\nAugust 8th, 7:30 AM EST: Birdy and the Beast, Birth of a Notion, Blow Out, A Bone for a Bone, *Mad as a Mars Hare, Martian Through Georgia, Meatless Flyday, Merlin the Magic Mouse, Merry Old Soul\n\nAugust 9th, 7:30 AM EST: Mexicali Shmoes, Mexican Boarders, Mexican Cat Dance, Mexican Joyride, Mexican Mousepiece, A Message to Gracias, Mice Will Play, Milk and Money, Miss Glory, Mixed Master\n\nAugust 10th, 7:30 AM EST: Mr. and Mrs. is the Name, Moby Duck, Moonlight for Two, Mouse Mazurka, Mouse Menace, Mouse-Merized Cat, Mouse on 57th Street, Mouse-Placed Kitten, Mouse Warming, *Mother was a Rooster\n\nAugust 11th, 7:30 AM EST: Much Ado About Nutting, Mucho Locos, Music Mice-Tro, *Mutt in a Rut, *Muzzle Tough, My Green Fedora, My Little Duckaroo, My Favorite Duck, Nasty Quacks, Naughty But Mice\n\nAugust 12th, 7:30 AM EST: Naughty Neighbors, Nelly's Folly, Night of the Living Duck, Night Watchman, *No Barking, *No Parking Hare, Notes To You, *Now Hare This, Nutty News, Odor-Able Kitty\n\nThe star before the name indicates shorts that already regularly air as part of the rotation.\n\nSo, it seems this will be something of a mouse-themed week, with several Speedy Gonzales shorts (including 5 of them in one day on the 9th), a Sniffles short, a Merlin the Magic Mouse short, and several other miscellaneous mouse shorts. I will update this to include the weekend shorts once they are all revealed. I'm very much looking forward to next week.\n\nStill a lot of Cs out there! Not to mention others of the letters we've been getting not in the mix. We did get some Bs after just a couple Cs. This could be going on awhile -- That's the hope anyway. I still like that the regulars are still in the mix too. Still waiting to see a 'rare' cartoon eventually - had to do with a (maybe) one-time character as he was looking for a statue I think and kept looking all over. Called it by a female's name which I don't remember. Will be on the lookout\n\nAs for the Ds, there's one not listed there that could be which is \"Dog Gone Modern\". I remember that plus a related one with Hubie and Bertie (House Hunting Mice) and these hosekeeping robots (part of a Toon Heads theme) - Hoping those both get played in the mix. Don't know what it is but always enjoyed the robots.\n\nWell, I can imagine it's going to be shorts they'll now probably run within the air.. I hope at least since these shorts do need something to expand upon for Boomerang.\n\nI actually hope that they could get the Horton Hatches the Egg short when they ever get to the \"H\" section. It would be nice since they are keeping Horton Hears the Who around the holidays.\n\nAll the rare shorts were replaced by the common shorts this week, unfortunately.\n\nWell, I had a feeling this wasn't going to last. But I'm hoping the rare shorts that already aired will become part of the regular rotation, just for a little more variety.\n\nBut let's see hat happens next week first before fully concluding that they are going to stop airing the rare shorts again first. Some of them still appear on the Boomerang schedule for next week."
