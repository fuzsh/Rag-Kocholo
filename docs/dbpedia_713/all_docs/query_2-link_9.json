Coyote as the source of a time machine Bugs had acquired.\n\nAnother all-star special (albeit not all cartoons) from that year was The Earth Day Special, which included Bugs, Porky and Tweety. Both specials had Jeff Bergman voicing all the LT characters, having been made shortly after the death of Mel Blanc.\n\nElijah Abrams\n\nJust deal with it!\n\nJoined\n\nJul 29, 2017\n\nMessages\n\n2,798\n\nMar 9, 2024\n\n#11\n\nBugs Bunny appeared in a dream sequence in two movies: “Two Guys from Texas”, (1948), and “My Dream is Yours” (1949).\n\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk\n\nWhich were both made by Warner Bros.!\n\nI think there are a few Cartoon Network promos and bumpers where the Looney Tunes interacted with other characters.

The Batman version appears on the original home video release of the movie from 1989.\n\nThere is also a series of PSAs called \"An Ounce of Prevention\", which talk about being safe around the house. For instance, Bugs reminds everyone to \"keep those pot handles turned in\", while Daffy talks to a boy and a girl about fire safety.\n\nSent from my SM-T220 using Tapatalk\n\nSilverstar\n\nKooky Spooky\n\nJoined\n\nJun 4, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n30,682\n\nLocation\n\nCartoonland\n\nMar 10, 2024\n\n#15\n\nIn Lethal Weapon (1987) Det.

Tuck Pendelton (Dennis Quaid); among the items in Pendleton's home is a Bugs Bunny plushie.\n\nPeter Bogdanovich's screwball comedy What's Up, Doc? (1972) ends with a clip of the Looney Tunes short of the same name playing on a TV.\n\nAll of these movies were produced by Warner Bros.\n\nAlso, in The Cure's music video for their song \"Lovecats\", one scene features a bunch of people in cat costumes; one of them is wearing a Sylvester costume.\n\nClassic Speedy\n\nBe vewy twippy\n\nJoined\n\nMay 13, 2003\n\nMessages\n\n42,510\n\nMar 10, 2024\n\n#16\n\nI was quite surprised to see Devil's Feud Cake (1963) playing in an episode of Supernatural.

Several other LT/MM characters also appear in it, although like the post-1964 shorts Bugs was off limits.\n\nWe do have a previous thread about clips of cartoons appearing in movies, but while we're on it I'll mention the Road Runner clips (from Beep Beep on a TV and Woah, Be-Gone! at a Drive-In) in Steven Spielberg's first theatrical film (Duel was made for TV) The Sugarland Express; he notes how important securing these clips was for him in his Foreword to Chuck Jones' first book Chuck Amuck.\n\nAllenJ\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nJoined\n\nAug 7, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n292\n\nMar 10, 2024\n\n#18\n\nWe do have a previous thread about clips of cartoons appearing in movies, but while we're on it I'll mention the Road Runner clips (from Beep Beep on a TV and Woah, Be-Gone! at a Drive-In) in Steven Spielberg's first theatrical film (Duel was made for TV) The Sugarland Express; he notes how important securing these clips was for him in his Foreword to Chuck Jones' first book Chuck Amuck.\n\nSpeaking of which, I didn't mention it in that thread because it's technically not a movie, but the pilot episode of Sue Thomas: F.B.Eye features clips from Tweety's first cartoon, \"A Tale of Two Kitties\" (I only know this because I happened to walk in on my mom watching it once).\n\nI was quite surprised to see Devil's Feud Cake (1963) playing in an episode of Supernatural.
