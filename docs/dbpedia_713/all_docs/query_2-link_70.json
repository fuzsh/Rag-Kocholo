        "text": "While you were gorging yourself on turkey this Thanksgiving weekend, I was consuming a steady diet of rabbit. And duck, pig, and coyote. Thanks to the Brooklyn Academy of Music’s three-day Chuck Amuck series, saluting the centenary of Academy Award-winning animator Charles M. Jones, I got a chance to see 29 Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons on the big screen in good quality, 35 mm prints with enthusiastic, capacity crowds. Short of the sainted Mr. Jones (who died in 2002 at the age of 89) being there with us, I can’t imagine a better way to revisit some of my most beloved childhood memories.\n\nOn Friday, Saturday and Sunday, the BAM Rose Cinemas screened twice-daily programs featuring ten shorts (nine on Friday) directed by Jones between 1949 and 1961, with one from Friz Freleng – the 1956 backstage satire A STAR IS BORED – thrown in for good measure. Each installment featured a deftly programmed mix of marquee headliners like Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, and “Brooklyn’s own” Bugs Bunny, and lesser-known supporting players like Claude Cat, Junyer Bear, and Marvin the Martian. All three screenings I attended were jam-packed with kids, who didn’t seem to mind that these films were not made in 3-D or on a computer. They were funny, and that was all that mattered.\n\nThey were also violent, and delightfully so. And that seemed to please the kids to no end, while occasionally inspiring some of the parents to bury their faces in their politically correct hands. Many of these shorts have been sanitized extensively over the years for TV broadcasts, but BAM had the good sense to present them unedited– complete with hilariously extensive (and obviously satirical) gun violence. Jones was the director of the infamous “Hunting Trilogy,” the three shorts in which Elmer Fudd encounters Bugs and Daffy in the woods and proceeds to repeatedly rearrange Daffy’s beak with his shotgun, and all three were screened this weekend: RABBIT FIRE (1951) on Friday; DUCK! RABBIT, DUCK! (1953) on Saturday; and RABBIT SEASONING (1952) on Sunday. For the record, I grew up watching these films unexpurgated, as God and Chuck Jones intended, and I didn’t end up shooting my little sister in the face, so I’m not particularly worried that Brooklyn will see an outbreak of firearm violence perpetrated by 8-year-olds.\n\nThe biggest shock of the weekend for me was how much the kids preferred Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote to any other characters in the Warner Bros. canon. While all the shorts were accompanied by giggles and applause at the end (which I love), the Road Runner cartoons were met with roars of approval and a steady stream of screaming, infectious laughter. Ironically, these were among my least favorite of the Warner Bros. cartoons growing up. As a bookish smartass, I found the predictable physical slapstick of Road Runner somehow less evolved than the sharp sarcasm of Bugs. But now, as an adult with a deep admiration for silent film comedy, I see how these shorts function as an homage to both the violently funny Keystone comedies and the highly physical, deadpan antics of Buster Keaton. Plus, the laugh per minute ratio is way higher than just about any piece of classic animation I can think of. Watching with a group of kids hopped up on caffeine and carbs, I developed a new appreciation for these characters, created by Jones himself for 1949’s FAST AND FURRY-OUS. Each daily program featured two Road Runner shorts, and my favorite among these was READY SET ZOOM! (1955), which featured some truly inventive demises for the hapless Wile E. My least favorite was OPERATION RABBIT (1952) in which the Coyote pursues Bugs for the first time and talks (also for the first time, courtesy of Mel Blanc) in a voice that resembles Ronald Coleman on helium. My response to the speaking Coyote is similar to my reaction to Keaton in early talkies: it just doesn’t feel right.\n\nA note about voices in Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies: although BAM was saluting Chuck Jones, the series paid equal tribute to Mel Blanc, who’s vocal characterizations were featured prominently in 23 of the 29 cartoons (he didn’t appear in the non-talking Road Runner episodes). The Man of 1,000 voices (actually 1,500 by his son Noel’s count) began voicing Warner Bros. shorts in 1937 (when they were still produced by Leon Schlesinger Productions) and continued performing the iconic characters he created until his death in 1989 at age 81. Blanc (who was a longtime cast member of The Jack Benny Program and also had his own radio show) never received an Oscar for his work, which is one of the great travesties in movie history. (You can listen to episodes of The Mel Blanc Show for free here.)\n\nAnother artist who’s work was on prominent display at BAM this weekend was Michael Maltese, who wrote all but four of the shorts in the Chuck Amuck series. Maltese, who joined the Warners cartoon unit in 1941 and remained for two decades, was frequently paired with Jones, and their best work was on display this weekend: THE RABBIT OF SEVILLE (1949), a parody of Rossini’s overture to The Barber of Seville; ONE FROGGY EVENING (1955) starring Michigan J. Frog, which Steven Spielberg called “the CITIZEN KANE of animated film;” and WHAT’S OPERA, DOC? (1957) and DUCK AMUCK (1953), voted the two best cartoons in history in Jerry Beck’s seminal book, The 50 Greatest Cartoons.\n\nThere was one minor drawback to the weekend, however: the auditorium in which BAM screened the Chuck Amuck series was their second smallest (of four screens), seating only 150 people. Tickets for the Sunday 2 p.m. show were sold out before noon, and it pained me to witness adorable little kids excited to see these films I love turned away at the door. But this is easily rectified. BAM should schedule an additional Looney Tunes program, perhaps over the Christmas break, and screen in it in the beautiful 265-seat auditorium that is home to the BAMcinématek events. It would be a setting befitting these iconic classic films, and an opportunity for which we all would be thankful.\n\nA complete list of all shorts screened at BAM, in order of their initial theatrical release, follows after the picture.\n\nFriday 11/23/12 Program #1 – 9 shorts (1949- 1960)\n\nFOR SCENT-I-MENTAL REASONS (1949)\n\nDirector: Chuck Jones • Writer: Michael Maltese\n\nCast: Mel Blanc (Pepe Le Pew)\n\nRelease Date: November 12, 1949\n\nRABBIT FIRE (1951)\n\nDirector: Chuck Jones • Writer: Michael Maltese\n\nCast: Mel Blanc (Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck) Arthur Q.
