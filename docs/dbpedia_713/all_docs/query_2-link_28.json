        "text": "On April 4, 1923, Warner Bros. was founded. To celebrate the centennial of this iconic studio, Turner Classic Movies (TCM) is devoting its entire April 2023 schedule to nothing but Warner titles.\n\nMuch of what is airing will naturally be a number of the great live-action feature films produced by the studio from its beginnings in the silent era, to Hollywood’s mid-century golden age, through the New Hollywood and into modern times.\n\nBut, of course, no look at Warner Bros.’ history would be complete without pointing out the classic cartoons the studio produced via its Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes film series. Those will be featured all month long on TCM as well, with at least one cartoon, usually two or three, airing each day in April.\n\nThe Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies shorts spotlighted on TCM come from legendary animators like Chuck Jones, Fred “Tex” Avery, Isadore “Friz” Freleng, Robert McKimson and Michael Maltese, are often accompanied by wonderfully manic musical scores from Carl Stalling and feature the inimitable Mel Blanc providing many of the vocal characterizations.\n\nA number of the featured titles appear on most short lists of greatest cartoons ever, and a couple have even been selected for preservation in the National Film Registry due to their artistic, historical and cultural importance. (And beside all that, they are still utterly hilarious.)\n\nYou’ll see a lot of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam and the like, as well as cartoons featuring the first appearances of beloved characters such as Foghorn Leghorn and Cecil Turtle, and more.\n\nJust as you used to be able to see a cartoon before a movie back in the day, so, here, TCM is scheduling these shorts before a movie title that often shares a theme with it (so you’ll see a Bugs Bunny Western parody before an actual Western, for one example).\n\nWe’ve got the list of Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes titles TCM is airing each day in April below. But before you dive in, please read this programming notice for a little clarification on the scheduling:\n\nScheduling/DVR Notice\n\nThe Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes shorts airing on TCM in April are interstitial programming and will probably not appear in your DVR or onscreen guide. TCM’s schedule gave approximate ending times for the cartoons, as they will be airing just ahead of the movies with which they are associated.\n\nWe’ve followed TCM’s example in our listings, giving the approximate end times for the cartoons. To give you some sense of when the cartoons will begin, considering that these shorts usually run seven or eight minutes, you might want to start tuning in at least 10 minutes before the listed end time to ensure you don’t miss any of the looniness!\n\nMerrie Melodies & Looney Tunes Airing During TCM’s Warner Bros. Centennial Celebration April 2023 (All Times ET)\n\nSaturday, April 1\n\nHollywood Steps Out (1941) — ends approximately 8pm, just ahead of the documentary The Brothers Warner.\n\nTex Avery directed this Merrie Melodies short set at a Hollywood nightclub and featuring caricatures of dozens of legendary stars from the era, including Cary Grant, Claudette Colbert, Norma Shearer, Humphrey Bogart and many more.\n\nSunday, April 2\n\nRacketeer Rabbit (1946) — ends approximately 6pm, just ahead of film Larceny, Inc. (1942)\n\nOn a day that TCM is devoting to some of Warner Bros.’ classic gangster films, it’s fitting that they will also be airing a couple of cartoons with the same theme. In the Looney Tunes short Racketeer Rabbit, directed by Friz Freleng, Bugs Bunny gives the business to two bank robbers modeled after Edward G. Robinson and Peter Lorre, and who were forerunners of Freleng’s Rocky and Mugsy characters.\n\nBugsy and Mugsy (1957) — ends approximately 8pm, just ahead of film The Public Enemy (1931)\n\nFreleng also helmed this Looney Tunes short featuring the now-established Rocky and Mugsy gangster characters, who tangle with Bugs Bunny.\n\nThe Scarlet Pumpernickel (1950) — ends approximately 9:45pm, just ahead of documentary Jack L. Warner: The Last Mogul(1993)\n\nChuck Jones directed this Looney Tunes entry that often ends up on lists of the greatest cartoons ever. With its title a play on The Scarlet Pimpernel, the story-within-a-story finds Daffy Duck pitching a dramatic role for himself to Warner Bros. chief Jack L. Warner. Daffy’s story is a swashbuckler set in “Merry Old England,” and also features the likes of Sylvester the Cat, Porky Pig and Melissa Duck in her first appearance.\n\nMonday, April 3\n\nRhapsody Rabbit (1947) — ends approximately 3:15pm, just ahead of film Rhapsody in Blue (1945)\n\nThis Freleng-helmed Merrie Melodies short finds concert pianist Bugs Bunny attempting to overcome various hilarious gags and interruptions as he performs Liszt’s “Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2.”\n\nBig House Bunny (1950) — ends approximately 8pm, just ahead of film Safe in Hell (1931)\n\nAnother Freleng Looney Tunes short, this one finds Bugs Bunny getting lost while tunneling and accidentally ending up in “Sing Song Prison,” where prison guard Yosemite Sam tries to keep him from getting out.\n\nPage Miss Glory (1936) — ends approximately 11pm, just ahead of film Page Miss Glory (1935)\n\nMerrie Melodies short directed by Avery.\n\nTuesday, April 4\n\nStage Door Cartoon (1944) — ends approximately 8pm, just ahead of film 42nd Street (1933)\n\nMerrie Melodies short directed by Freleng, starring Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd, who take their feud onto a vaudeville stage.\n\nWednesday, April 5\n\nPorky’s Baseball Broadcast (1940) — ends approximately 11am, just ahead of film Elmer, the Great (1933)\n\nPorky Pig leads this Freleng-directed Looney Tunes entry.\n\nBuccaneer Bunny (1948) — ends approximately 8pm, just ahead of film The Sea Wolf (1941)\n\nBugs Bunny messes with pirate Yosemite Sam in this Looney Tunes short directed by Freleng.\n\nThursday, April 6\n\nBaseball Bugs (1946) — ends approximately 2:15pm, just ahead of film The Winning Team (1952)\n\nThis hilarious Looney Tunes entry directed by Freleng finds Bugs Bunny single-handedly taking on the thuggish players of the Gas-House Gorillas baseball team. The gags are funny, and many of the references to the sport are still timely; the famous “conga line” scene continues to live on in online memes posted by frustrated fans when their team’s pitcher is giving up too many bases.\n\nRabbit Hood (1949) — ends approximately 8pm, just ahead of film The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938)\n\nThis Jones-directed Merrie Melodies title parodies Robin Hood, with Bugs Bunny facing off with the Sheriff of Nottingham. There is even a cameo from Errol Flynn courtesy of live-action footage from Warner Bros.’ The Adventures of Robin Hood, which follows the cartoon.\n\nFriday, April 7\n\nWhat’s Opera, Doc? (1957) — ends approximately 8pm, just ahead of film They Won’t Forget (1937)\n\nAnother Jones-directed classic, this Merrie Melodies title might have been where a lot of people got their first exposure to opera; specifically, the music from Richard Wagner’s operas. Elmer Fudd famously sings “Kill the Wabbit!” to the melody of “The Ride of the Valkyries” as he pursues Bugs Bunny across a brilliantly designed operatic landscape. Often ranked among the greatest cartoons ever, it was the first animated short to be selected for preservation by the National Film Registry for its artistic and cultural significance; the two other Jones shorts selected for the Registry will also air later this month.\n\nSaturday, April 8\n\nA Mutt in a Rut (1959) — ends approximately 10am, just ahead of film Good-Bye, My Lady (1956)\n\nLooney Tunes short directed by Robert McKimson, featuring Elmer Fudd and his dog Rover.\n\nCarrotblanca (1995) — ends approximately 8pm, just ahead of film Casablanca (1942)\n\nThe most recently produced Looney Tunes title airing this month, Carrotblanca was produced by the Animaniacs writing team and, as its title suggests, is a parody of the classic Warner Bros. drama Casablanca, which follows. A number of favorite characters take on roles from the film, including Bugs Bunny as Rick, Penelope Pussycat as Ilsa, Daffy Duck as Sam, Sylvester as Victor Lazlo, Pepé Le Pew as Captain Renault, Yosemite Sam as Major Strasser and Tweety as Ugarte.\n\nSunday, April 9\n\nEaster Yeggs (1947) — ends approximately 11:30am, just ahead of film One Foot in Heaven (1941)\n\nA Looney Tunes short directed by McKimson that is fitting to show on Easter Sunday. It stars Bugs Bunny, Elmer Fudd and the Easter Bunny, who gets Bugs to deliver eggs for him.\n\nA Star Is Bored (1956) — ends approximately 8pm, just ahead of film A Star Is Born (1954)\n\nFreleng directed this Looney Tunes title that expands the rivalry between Bugs and Daffy.\n\nMonday, April 10\n\nHair-Raising Hare (1946) — ends approximately 4:30pm, just ahead of film Dracula Has Risen From the Grave (1969)\n\nMerrie Melodies short directed by Jones that introduces the big orange monster, Gossamer.\n\n14 Carrot Rabbit (1952) — ends approximately 8pm, just ahead of film The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948)\n\nBugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam go at it again in this Looney Tunes short directed by Freleng.\n\nTuesday, April 11\n\nTweety’s S.O.S. (1951) — ends approximately 8pm, just ahead of film Now, Voyager (1942)\n\nMerrie Melodies short directed by Freleng finds Sylvester the Cat stowing away aboard the cruise ship on which Tweety Bird and Granny are passengers.\n\nWednesday, April 12\n\nBugs and Thugs (1954) — ends approximately 8pm, just ahead of film White Heat (1949)\n\nBugs Bunny tangles once again with bank robbers Rocky and Mugsy in this Looney Tunes short directed by Freleng.\n\nYankee Doodle Daffy (1943) — ends approximately 10:30pm, just ahead of film Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942)\n\nThis Looney Tunes short directed by Freleng was the second one to pair Daffy Duck and Porky Pig, and is one of the few classic Warner Bros. cartoons to now be in the public domain.\n\nThursday, April 13\n\nThere Auto Be a Law (1953) — ends approximately 11:30am, just ahead of film Greased Lightning (1977)\n\nMcKimson-directed Looney Tunes short poking fun at various aspects of automobiles.\n\nGo Fly a Kit (1957) — ends approximately 5:30pm, just ahead of film The Spirit of St. Louis (1957)\n\nLooney Tunes short directed by Jones.\n\nDrip-Along Daffy (1951) — ends approximately 8pm, just ahead of film The Searchers (1956)\n\nA Merrie Melodies parody of Westerns led by Daffy Duck and Porky Pig, directed by Jones.\n\nFriday, April 14\n\nBallot Box Bunny (1951) — ends approximately 5:30pm, just ahead of film A Face in the Crowd (1957)\n\nFreleng helmed this Merrie Melodies short that finds Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam running against each other for mayor of a small town.\n\nSahara Hare (1955) — ends approximately 8pm, just ahead of film The Land of the Pharaohs (1955, a newly remastered version)\n\nBugs and Yosemite Sam go at it again in this Freleng-directed Looney Tunes title, this time in the Sahara Desert, where Bugs accidentally winds up after once again “not making that left turn at Albuquerque.”\n\nSaturday, April 15\n\nAnt-Pasted (1953) — ends approximately 9am, just ahead of film Them!
