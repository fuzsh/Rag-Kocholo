        "text": "That’s not all, folks! The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie will finally release in theaters this Fall. The first fully animated feature of the franchise, set in the same world and style as the Looney Tunes Cartoons HBO Max shorts, was previously expected to debut on HBO Max and Cartoon Network. Director Pete Browngardt recently took to X to reveal the exciting news.\n\nIn the sci-fi buddy action comedy penned by Kevin Costello, Porky Pig and Daffy Duck turn into unlikely heroes when their antics at the local bubble gum factory uncover a secret alien mind control plot. Against all odds, the two are determined to save their town (and the world!)...that is if they don't drive each other crazy in the process.\n\nEric Bauza (Looney Tunes Cartoons) voices Porky and Daffy alongside Candi Milo (Tiny Toons Looniversity) as Petunia Pig and Peter MacNicol (Numb3rs) as the alien Invader. Browngardt executive produces for Warner Bros. Animation, while Alex Kirwan (Looney Tunes Cartoons) acts as supervising producer.\n\nA firm release date for The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie is still TBD. GFM Animation is handling distribution."
