        "text": "Re: Larry Doyle: Guessing he's one of the current/recent seasons' \"Simpsons\" writers?\n\nYeah. It's funny, the name has allus stuck in my head, because he and Neal Sternecky co-authored the 1980s revival of Walt Kelly's classic \"Pogo,\" which first introduced me to what is probably now my favorite comic strip of all time (even if their version of it was pretty mediocre, in retrospect). According to SNPP.com, he wrote some of the more decent Scully-era episodes (\"Girly Edition,\" \"Worst Episode Ever,\" the Bart-and-Lisa-get-sucked-into-an-Itchy-&-Scratchy-cartoon segment of the ninth Halloween special), as well as some of the less decent ones (\"Wild Barts Can't Be Broken,\" \"It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad Marge\")--no really terrible ones, though. The IMDB also credits him with an episode of Daria the I've never seen, and the Duplex thing mentioned in the article (apparently an upcoming live action flick with Drew Barrymore). Only in America could a small-time comic strip writer make it all the way to Tinsel Town...\n\nThe movie's plot sounds kind of cliche / kiddie movie-ish, and I honestly don't understand why a recognized live action star has to appear in the thing--aren't the Tunes themselves a big enough box office draw? Couldn't these characters, recognized as some of the strongest in cartoon history, carry a feature all by themselves? They've never really been given the chance (no, I don't count the compilation films as being \"features,\" considering how little new material was actually created for them). Ah, well...hope for the best, expect the worst, I guess.\n\nOriginally posted by Craig\n\nYeah.

They've never really been given the chance (no, I don't count the compilation films as being \"features,\" considering how little new material was actually created for them). Ah, well...hope for the best, expect the worst, I guess.\n\nThought \"Girly Edition\" was an OK episode (along with \"Terror of Tiny Toon\"---the name of that Halloween episode segment). Never read that revival of \"Pogo\" back in the 80's, but did recall reading the \"Bloom County\" strip that made fun of the idea of reviving dead strips by someone other than their original creators...\n\nStill, we'll have to wait and see I guess re: this film...my guess is a big name star would ensure in Hollyweird execs' minds that someone over the age of six will sit through a \"cartoon\"...esp. someone who carried action movie stuff like \"The Mummy\" (presumably why Fraser's been recruited, vs. such better-received-by-critics-but-non-explosion-filled stuff like \"Gods and Monsters\"), *and* is a big-name star (thus avoiding \"Space Jam\"'s use of a pro athlete I guess)...\n\n-B.\n\nSlightly wonders if Lola Bunny's going to be in this thing...seeing as she's even been included in \"Baby Looney Tunes\" merchandise I've seen on sale at my part time job and all...\n\nOriginally posted by Looney\n\nWell this certainly stirs up some mixed emotions. On the one hand it is great to hear that these classic cartoon characters are not being left in oblivion, but can they pull it off? I certainly hope so. The looney tunes franchise is rich in history and certainly deserves just treatment. Here's to the powers that be to get it right! Long live Bugs and the gang!\n\nPersonally, I think preserving the rich history of the cartoons would be the best way to give the Looney Tunes just treatment. The cartoons that have made generations of people laugh have never gotten the respect they deserve from the company that owns them.\n\nI really hope Lola isn't in the film, she's the worst thing to happen to Looney Tunes in the last decade. I agree with the other posters here that they don't need a big name actor to pull the film off. Bugs and company are stars in their own right. The problem I see with the film is making all the characters interact as if they live in the same universe like Tiny Toons or something. I don't think it works well with Looney Tunes.\n\nJack\n\nI have mixed feelings about this. On the one hand, I'm glad that Warner Bros. is making another Looney Tunes movie as well as some new shorts. On the other hand, Brendan Fraiser seems like an Odd choice to headline this project. The compolation films from the 80's arent' exactley real Looney Tune movies in my opinion since they use footage from the old cartoons, and have A small amount of new footage wrapped around them, but they were fun to watch when nothing better was on. It would be nice if they made an all animated Looney Tunes movie with an original storyline in the same way as \"How I Spend My Vacation\", \"Wakko's Wish\", and \"Tweety's High Flying Adventure\", but that kind of A film will only go straight to video. What they could've done with this new film is just have celeberties have cameos, or supporting roles like in The Muppet films (If the right people are involved.) As for the new shorts, they better put them infront of movies I might want to see. The Harry Potter sequles are an obviouse choice, but I'm not A big Harry Potter fan. When Warners released \"Box Office Bunny, they put that infront of \"The Never Ending Story 2\", and when Disney released \"Runaway Brain\", they put it infront of \"A Kid In King Arthur's Court\". Not exactly the kinds of films I'd ever wat to see. I could've just went in to see the shorts, and walked out like when people paied to see \"The Phantom Menace\" trailer.\n\nOriginally posted by mbaker\n\nAs for the new shorts, they better put them infront of movies I might want to see.

(The only reason the Mummy Returns made money is becasue of the Rock.) Besides, he is not a popular actor now, you need someone who everyone knows. (Michael Jordan in Space Jam is a prime example.)\n\nI saw Harry Potter at work. Except for a few parts that were a little hard to understand. (Like the game they played, which the rules don't make sense.) I thought it was a good movie. It was better than most of the movies that were out that year.\n\n>>>>As for the new shorts, they better put them infront of movies I might want to see.

Though admittedly, this film isn't an action-adventure movie example (or even a non-R-rated movie example)...\n\nAnd while Jordan may be popular, I'm quite certain that Fraser can easily act rings around him any day of the week ;-)\n\n>>\n\nI saw Harry Potter at work.
