        "text": "More than a year after the Warner Bros. Discovery merger ushered in the removal and scrapping of multiple HBO Max TV series and original films, including a $90 million Batgirl movie, the company is pulling the plug on yet another completed project. On Thursday, it was confirmed that Warner Bros. has canceled plans to release Coyote vs. Acme, a live-action and CG animation hybrid film starring John Cena that completed filming last year, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n“With the relaunch of Warner Bros. Pictures Animation in June, the studio has shifted its global strategy to focus on theatrical releases,” a WB Motion Picture Group spokesperson said in a statement to the outlet. “With this new direction, we have made the difficult decision not to move forward with Coyote vs Acme. We have tremendous respect for the filmmakers, casts, and crew, and are grateful for their contributions to the film.”\n\nBased on the 1990 New Yorker humor piece written by Ian Frazier and adapted by Samy Burch— who also wrote Todd Haynes’s upcoming awards contender, May December—the film centers on Looney Tunes character Wile E. Coyote as he seeks legal action against Acme after the company’s products fail in his pursuit of the Road Runner. Costarring Will Forte and Lana Condor, the project was announced in 2020 and dated for theatrical release on July 21, 2023, before it was wiped from the calendar and replaced by Barbie.\n\nWhen Batgirl was shelved last year after advance test screenings, a Warner Bros. Pictures spokesperson blamed the move on “our leadership’s strategic shift as it relates to the DC universe and HBO Max.” But sources told Variety that Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav intended to take a tax write-down from the film, rather than spend an additional $30 million to $50 million to market it domestically. Coyote vs. Acme reportedly came with a $72 million price tag and had begun receiving high audience scores at early test screenings. Yet Warner Bros. leadership has apparently similarly balked at pouring any money into promoting the project for release. According to Deadline, the company is taking an estimated $30 million write-down on the production.\n\nWhile cutting losses by canceling projects is not a new strategy for Zaslav’s company, it’s surprising that Warner Bros. would choose to shelve a film that involves so much marquee talent. DC Studios cohead James Gunn produced the film and worked on its story; director Dave Green, who previously helmed 2016’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows, is developing a project at the company’s New Line Cinema division; and Cena stars in Max’s DC show Peacemaker, which is due to return for a second season. (Vanity Fair has reached out to a rep for the actor for comment.)\n\n“For three years, I was lucky enough to make a movie about Wile E. Coyote, the most persistent, passionate, and resilient character of all time,” Green posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. “I was surrounded by a brilliant team, who poured their souls into this project for years. We were all determined to honor the legacies of these historic characters and actually get them right. Along the ride, we were embraced by test audiences who rewarded us with fantastic scores. I am beyond proud of the final product, and beyond devastated by WB’s decision. But in the spirit of Wile E. Coyote, resilience and persistence win the day.”\n\nComposer Steven Price shared a snippet of the film’s score to social media, “as no-one will be able to hear it now, due to bizarre anti-art studio financial shenanigans I will never understand.”\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nStyle\n\nRadhika Jones on Jenna Ortega’s Rise to Stardom\n\nThe VF editor in chief charts the September cover star’s trajectory from nine-year-old working actor to global name—and now a producer on Wednesday.\n\nMovies\n\nLiza Minnelli Is Writing a Memoir Because She’s “Mad as Hell”\n\nIn a statement to People, Minnelli expressed disappointment with other representations of her life and revealed that she’s releasing a memoir set to hit stands in spring of 2026: “It’s my own damn story.”\n\nHollywood\n\nDan Stevens Is Down to Get Weird\n\nMore than a decade after leaving Downton Abbey, the Cuckoo star reflects on what he’s learned—and passed on to costar Hunter Schafer: “I think it was refreshing and delightful for her to realize that not every job needs to be like Euphoria.”\n\nTelevision\n\nIn The Day of the Jackal, Eddie Redmayne’s Shape-Shifting Assassin Meets His Match\n\nLashana Lynch faces off against Redmayne in Peacock’s bold reimagining of the classic cat-and-mouse novel, a thrilling escape with unsettling political parallels.\n\nAward Season\n\nHow Will the Presidential Election Affect This Year’s Oscar Race?\n\nThe outcome of the 2016 election was ever present at the Academy Awards that followed four months later.
