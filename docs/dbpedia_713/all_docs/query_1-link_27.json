        "text": "The Birth of a Notion Review\n\nThe Birth of a Notion is a 1947 animated short film from the Looney Tunes series. It is a very funny cartoon.\n\nDaffy Duck wants to overstay in a house for a winter, but there a Peter Lorre-mad scientist chases him for his experiment. There is also a hilarious dog in the picture and Daffy’s cousin who is so funny in that one scene that he got. I loved that scene and I really liked the ending as well, but the moment where this movie reached greatness is the one where Leopold the dog complained about his small part in the picture.\n\nThat was a perfect example of Looney Tunes’ meta-humor at its highest power. It was hilarious and so inventive and true. Daffy is also amusing throughout. However, this is one of those movies which have many instantly memorable moments spread throughout, but overall it’s not great as the Lorre scientist is overly familiar by now and the chases in the middle felt dull.\n\nThe Birth of a Notion is a problematic cartoon in its middle, but there are some moments here which are downright hilarious in their inventiveness."
