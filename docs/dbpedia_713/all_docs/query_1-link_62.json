A Celebration on Records\n\nSince the maladjusted mallard was mere albumen and yolk and 81 years ago today, we salute some of his records in a post that’s surely worth more than a million box.\n\nAnimation History posted by Jerry Beck\n\n“The Return of Duck Dodgers” Storyboard by Michael Maltese – Part 1\n\nAs a Holiday Gift to you, we present (in two parts) the original 1979 Michael Maltese storyboards for the cartoon intended to be a sequel to the 1953 classic, “Duck Dodgers”.\n\nANIMATION ANECDOTES posted by\n\nAnimation Anecdotes #326\n\n“I wasn’t recognized on the street.

Clever gags, aided by sharp timing and witty dialogue, make this an overlooked classic.\n\nBAXTER'S BREAKDOWNS posted by\n\n“Birth Of A Notion” (1947)\n\nNow here’s a bona-fide laugh riot from the McKimson unit!
