Following the pattern of one release each year of the previous volumes, it was released on October 21, 2008.[1] It is the final release in the Golden Collection series.[2] Succeeding the Golden Collection series would be the Looney Tunes Platinum Collection series on Blu-ray, first released November 2011. On July 3, 2012, a two-disc DVD version of Volume 1 of the Platinum Collection was released.[3]\n\nVolume 6 is less child-friendly than previous releases. Like Volumes 3–5, it has a warning before each disc about the shorts containing content that some viewers would not consider to be \"politically correct\" by today's standards (but will be shown uncut and uncensored for historical reasons), and as such, is \"intended for the adult collector\". However, Volume 6's box art disclaimer says that it \"is not suitable for children\", as opposed to Volumes 3-5, stating that they might not be suitable for younger audiences.\n\nThis is due to the fact that, in addition to containing cartoons that have racial and/or ethnic stereotypes (like in Volumes 3–5), and references to sexism in Robert McKimson's Wild Wife, Volume 6 also contains many cartoons that pertain to World War II, most of them containing depictions or references to Nazi Fuehrer Adolf Hitler and Hideki Tojo, or to Nazi Germans and Imperial Japan in general. While Volumes 4 and 5 each had a couple World War II-themed cartoons (Plane Daffy and Scrap Happy Daffy, respectively), Volume 6 is notable for having an entire disc dedicated to the subject (Disc 2: Patriotic Pals), including several of its bonus cartoons.\n\nVolume 6 was originally only released in North America due to the poor sales of the previous volume. However, the discs in this volume were not region-coded, making it easy for collectors outside of North America to import and play this set. The set was released in the UK on 12 September 2011.[4]\n\nDisc 1: Looney Tunes All-Stars\n\n[edit]\n\n# Title Characters Director Year Series 1 Hare Trigger Bugs, Sam Friz Freleng May 5, 1945 MM 2 To Duck or Not to Duck Daffy, Elmer Chuck Jones March 6, 1943 LT 3 Birth of a Notion Daffy Robert McKimson April 12, 1947 LT 4 My Little Duckaroo Daffy, Porky, Nasty Canasta Chuck Jones November 27, 1954 MM 5 Crowing Pains Foghorn, Henery, Sylvester, Barnyard Robert McKimson July 12, 1947 LT 6 Raw!
