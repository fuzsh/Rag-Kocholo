        "text": "Porky Pig and Daffy Duck probably won’t be heading for a career in real estate, as seen in a new preview clip from the forthcoming theatrical release The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie.\n\nDirector Pete Browngardt’s sci-fi comedy from Warner Bros. Animation is set to hit theaters domestically later this year but does not yet have an announced release date. The project focuses on Porky and Daffy (both voiced by Eric Bauza) learning that aliens are plotting to overtake the planet, which leads the pair to put their differences aside and help save the world.\n\nThe sequence shows the Looney Tunes mainstays cutting countless corners while attempting to prepare their home ahead of an inspection. “Well, Porky, we’re all finished,” Daffy says triumphantly. “Here’s to passing this inspection and living another year just the way we like it.”\n\nThis leads a conflicted Porky to hesitantly respond, “Yeah, just the way we like it.”\n\nToward the end of the clip, Daffy attempts to assuage Porky as the inspector arrives. “Don’t worry, chum,” Daffy says. “I’ll handle thus middle-aged busybody.”\n\nThe Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie is set to premiere Tuesday at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival. The film marks the first fully animated Looney Tunes feature to debut with a theatrical run."
