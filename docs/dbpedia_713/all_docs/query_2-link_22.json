        "text": "Porky Pig and Daffy Duck, one of the most beloved comedic duos in showbiz history, are set to make their return to the big screen in the sci-fi comedy adventure “The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie.”\n\nGFM Animation will launch worldwide sales on the Warner Bros. Animation-produced theatrical feature at the American Film Market (Oct. 31 – Nov. 5) and will share first-look footage. “The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie” is the first-ever fully animated Looney Tunes feature-length movie created for a movie theater audience.\n\nDirected by Pete Browngardt and the creative team behind the “Looney Tunes Cartoons,” “The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie” stars Porky Pig and Daffy Duck as unlikely heroes and Earth’s only hope when facing the threat of alien invasion. In this buddy comedy, the heroes race to save the world, delivering all the laugh-out-loud gags and vibrant visuals that made the Looney Tunes so iconic, but on an epic scale not seen in the franchise before.\n\nSam Register, president, Warner Bros. Animation and Cartoon Network Studios, said: “Our artists have created an incredible Looney Tunes film that follows in the cinematic tradition of when audiences first fell in love with these characters. GFM Animation are the perfect partners to help us bring Porky and Daffy back to their rightful place on the big screen.”\n\nGuy Collins, chairman of GFM Animation, said: “It’s thrilling for the team here at GFM Animation to be handling the worldwide distribution sales on a movie with such an iconic IP, working with the terrific team at Warner Bros. Animation. It is great to see all their hard work in progress at this advanced stage of production. Independents rarely get to work on movies with such affinity awareness from fans worldwide and we know they are going to love Porky and Daffy’s sci-fi adventure just as much as we do.”\n\nProduced by Warner Bros. Animation, the film is currently in production with delivery set for Q2 2024. Browngardt also serves as an executive producer. Alex Kirwan (“Looney Tunes Cartoons”) is supervising producer. Sam Register (“Teen Titans Go!”) is also an executive producer."
