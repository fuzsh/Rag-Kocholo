        "text": "Emma Goldman, The Social Significance of the Modern Drama\n\n(Boston: Richard G. Badger, 1914; The Gorham Press, Boston, U.S.A.)\n\nTHE GERMAN DRAMA: GERHART HAUPTMANN\n\nTHE SUNKEN BELL\n\nThe great versatility of Gerhart Hauptmann is perhaps nowhere so apparent as in \" The Sunken Bell,\" the poetic fairy tale of the tragedy of Man, a tragedy as rich in symbolism as it is realistically true-a tragedy as old as mankind, as elemental as man's ceaseless struggle to cut loose from the rock of ages.\n\nHeinrich, the master bell founder, is an idealist consumed by the fire of a great purpose. He has already set a hundred bells ringing in a hundred different towns, all singing his praises. But his restless spirit is not appeased. Ever it soars to loftier heights, always yearning to reach the sun.\n\nNow once more he has tried his powers, and the new bell, the great Master Bell, is raised aloft, - only to sink into the mere, carrying its maker with it.\n\nHis old ideals are broken, and Heinrich is lost in the wilderness of life.\n\nWeak and faint with long groping in the dark woods, and bleeding, Heinrich reaches the mountain top and there beholds Rautendelein, the spirit of freedom, that has allured him on in the work which he strove-\" in one grand Bell, to weld the silver music of thy voice with the warm gold of a Sun- holiday. It should have been a master work I failed, then wept I tears of blood.\" Heinrich returns to his faithful wife Magda, his children, and his village friends - to die. The bell that sank into the mere was not made for the heights -it was not fit to wake the answering echoes of the peaks!\n\nHeinrich.\n\n. . . . . . . . . . .\n\n'Twas for the valley - not the mountain-top!\n\nI choose to die. The service of the valleys\n\nCharms me no longer. . . . since on the peak I stood.\n\nYouth - a new youth - I'd need, if I should live:\n\nOut of some rare and magic mountain flower\n\nMarvelous juices I should need to press --\n\nHeart-health, and strength, and the mad lust of triumph,\n\nSteeling my hand to work none yet have dreamed of!\n\nRautendelein, the symbol of youth and freedom, the vision of new strength and expression, wakes Heinrich from his troubled sleep, kisses him back to life, and inspires him with faith and courage to work toward greater heights.\n\nHeinrich leaves his wife, his hearth, his native place, and rises to the summit of his ideal, there to create, to fashion a marvel bell whose iron throat shall send forth\n\nThe first waking peal\n\nShall shake the skies-when, from the somber clouds\n\nThat weighed upon us through the winter night,\n\nRivers of jewels shall go rushing down\n\nInto a million hands outstretched to clutch!\n\nThen all who drooped, with sudden Power inflamed,\n\nShall bear their treasure homeward to their huts,\n\nThere to unfurl, at last, the silken banners,\n\nWaiting - so long, so long - to be upraised.\n\n. . . . . . . . . . .\n\nAnd now the wondrous chime again rings out,\n\nFilling the air with such sweet, passionate sound\n\nAs makes each breast to sob with rapturous pain.\n\nIt sings a song, long lost and long forgotten,\n\nA song of home -a childlike song of Love,\n\nBorn in the waters of some fairy well --\n\nKnown to all mortals, and yet heard of none!\n\nAnd as it rises, softly first, and low,\n\nThe nightingale and dove seem singing, too;\n\nAnd all the ice in every human breast\n\nIs melted, and the hate, and pain, and woe,\n\nStream out in tears.\n\nIndeed a wondrous bell, as only those can forge who have reached the mountain top,- they who can soar upon the wings of their imagination high above the valley of the commonplace, above the dismal gray of petty consideration, beyond the reach of the cold, stifling grip of reality,- higher, ever higher, to kiss the sun-lit sky.\n\nHeinrich spreads his wings. Inspired by the divine fire of Rautendelein, he all but reaches the pinnacle. But there is the Vicar, ready to wrestle with the devil for a poor human soul; to buy it free, if need be, to drag it back to its cage that it may never rise again in rebellion to the will of God.\n\nThe Vicar.\n\nYou shun the church, take refuge in the mountains;\n\nThis many a month you have not seen the home\n\nWhere your poor wife sits sighing, while, each day,\n\nYour children drink their lonely mother's tears!\n\nFor this there is no name but madness,\n\nAnd wicked madness. Yes. I speak the truth.\n\nHere stand I, Master, overcome with horror\n\nAt the relentless cruelty of your heart.\n\nNow Satan, aping God, hath dealt a blow\n\nYes, I must speak my mind - a blow so dread\n\nThat even he must marvel at his triumph.\n\n. . . Now - I have done.\n\nToo deep, yea to the neck, you are sunk in sin!\n\nYour Hell, decked out in beauty as high Heaven,\n\nShall hold you fast. I will not waste more words.\n\nYet mark this, Master: witches make good fuel,\n\nEven as heretics, for funeral-pyres.\n\n. . . Your ill deeds,\n\nHeathen, and secret once, are now laid bare.\n\nHorror they wake, and soon there shall come hate.\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\nThen, go your way! Farewell! My task is done.\n\nThe hemlock Of your sin no man may hope\n\nTo rid your soul of. May God pity you!\n\nBut this remember! There's a word named rue!\n\nAnd some day, some day, as your dreams You dream,\n\nA sudden arrow, shot from out the blue,\n\nShall pierce your breast! And yet\n\nYou shall not die, Nor shall You live.\n\nIn that dread day you'll Curse\n\nAll you now cherish -God, the world, your work,\n\nYour wretched self you'll curse. Then . . . think of me!\n\nThat bell shall ring again! Then think of me!\n\nBarely does Heinrich escape the deadly clutch of outlived creeds, superstitions, and conventions embodied in the Vicar, than he is in the throes of other foes who conspire his doom.\n\nNature herself has decreed the death of Heinrich. For has not man turned his back upon her, has he not cast her off, scorned her beneficial of. ferings, robbed her of her beauty, devastated her charms and betrayed her trust-all for the ephemeral glow of artifice and sham? Hence Nature, too, is Heinrich's foe. Thus the Spirit of the Earth, with all its passions and lusts, symbolized in the Wood Sprite, and gross materialism in the person of the Nickelmann, drive the in. truder back.\n\nThe Wood Sprite.\n\nHe crowds us from our hills. He hacks and hews,\n\nDigs up our metals, sweats, and smelts, and brews.\n\nThe earth-man and the water-sprite he takes\n\nTo drag his burdens, and, to harness, breaks.\n\nShe steals my cherished flowers, my red-brown ores,\n\nMy gold, my Precious stones, my resinous stores.\n\nShe serves him like a slave, by night and day.\n\n'Tis he she kisses--us she keeps at bay.\n\nNaught stands against him. Ancient trees he fells.\n\nThe earth quakes at his tread, and all the dells\n\nRing with the echo of his thunderous blows.\n\nHis Crimson smithy furnace glows and shines\n\nInto the depths Of my most secret mines.\n\nWhat he is up to, only Satan knows!\n\nThe Nickelmann\n\nBrekekekex! Hadst thou the creature slain,\n\nA-rotting in the mere long since he had lain --\n\nThe maker of the bell, beside the bell.\n\nAnd so when next I had wished to throw the stones,\n\nThe bell had been my box--the dice, his bones!\n\nBut even they are powerless to stern the tide of the Ideal: they are helpless in the face of Heinrich's new-born faith, of his burning passion to complete his task, and give voice to the thousand throated golden peal.\n\nHeinrich works and toils, and when doubt casts its black shadow athwart his path, Rautendelein charms back hope. She alone has boundless faith in her Balder,-- god of the joy of Life -- for he is part of her, of the great glowing force her spirit breathed into the Heinrichs since Time was born -- Liberty, redeemer of man.\n\nHeinrich.\n\nI am thy Balder?\n\nMake me believe it-make me know it, child!\n\nGive my faint soul the rapturous joy it needs,\n\nTo nerve it to its task. For, as the hand,\n\nToiling with tong and hammer, on and on,\n\nTo hew the marble and to guide the chisel,\n\nNow bungles here, now there, yet may not halt\n\n. . . . But - enough of this,\n\nStill straight and steady doth the smoke ascend\n\nFrom my poor human sacrifice to heaven.\n\nShould now a Hand on high reject my gift,\n\nWhy, it may do so. Then the priestly robe\n\nFalls from my shoulder-by no act of mine;\n\nWhile I, who erst upon the heights was set,\n\nMust look my last on Horeb, and be dumb!\n\nBut now bring torches! Lights! And show thine Art!\n\nEnchantress! Fill the wine-cup! We will drink!\n\nAy, like the common herd of mortal men,\n\nWith resolute hands our fleeting joy we'll grip!\n\nOur unsought leisure we will fill with life,\n\nNot waste it, as the herd, in indolence.\n\nWe will have music!\n\nWhile Heinrich and Rautendelein are in the ecstasy of their love and work, the spirits weave their treacherous web - they threaten, they plead, they cling,- spirits whose pain and grief are harder to bear than the enmity or menace of a thousand foes. Spirits that entwine one's heartstrings with tender touch, yet are heavier fetters, more oppressive than leaden weights. Heinrich's children, symbolizing regret that paralyzes one's creative powers, bring their mother's tears and with them a thousand hands to pull Heinrich down from his heights, back to the valley.\n\n\"The bell! The bell!\" The old, long buried bell again ringing and tolling. Is it not the echo from the past? The superstitions instilled from birth, the prejudices that cling to man with cruel persistence, the conventions which fetter the wings of the idealist: the Old wrestling with the New for the control of man.\n\n\" The Sunken Bell \" is a fairy tale in its poetic beauty and glow of radiant color. But stripped 'of the legendary and symbolic, it is the life story of every seeker for truth, of the restless spirit of rebellion ever striving onward, ever reaching out toward the sun-tipped mountain, ever yearning for a new-born light.\n\nToo long had Heinrich lived in the valley. It has sapped his strength, has clipped his wings. \" Too late! Thy heavy burdens weigh thee down; thy dead ones are too mighty for thee.\" Heinrich has to die. \" He who has flown so high into the very Light, as thou hast flown, must per. ish, if he once fall back to earth.\"\n\nThus speak the worldly wise. As if death could still the burning thirst for light; as if the hunger for the ideal could ever be appeased by the thought of destruction! The worldly wise never feel the irresistible urge to dare the cruel fates. With the adder in Maxim Gorki's \" Song of the Falcon\" they sneer, \"What is the sky? An empty place. . . . Why disturb the soul with the desire to soar into the sky? . . . Queer birds,\" they laugh at the falcons. \" Not knowing the earth and grieving on it, they yearn for the sky, seeking for light in the sultry desert. For it is only a desert, with no food and no supporting place for a living body.\"\n\nThe Heinrichs are the social falcons, and though they perish when they fall to earth, they die in the triumphant glory of having beheld the sun, of having braved the storm, defied the clouds and mastered the air.\n\nThe sea sparkles in the glowing light, the waves dash against the shore. In their lion-like roar a song resounds about the proud falcons: \" 0 daring Falcon, in the battle with sinister forces you lose your life. But the time will come when your precious blood will illumine, like the burning torch of truth, the dark horizon of man; when your blood shall inflame many brave hearts with a burning desire for freedom.\"\n\nThe time when the peals of Heinrich's Bell will call the strong and daring to battle for light and joy. \" Hark I . . . 'Tis the music of the Sunbells' song! The Sun . . . the Sun . . . draws near! \" . . . and though \"the night is long,\" dawn breaks, its first rays falling on the dying Heinrichs.\n\nTo Next Essay: Frank Wedekind: The Awakening of Spring\n\nReturn to Table of Contents"
