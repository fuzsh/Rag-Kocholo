Comment:

Said to have originated in hobo camps in the depression era, mulligan stew is a catch-all of whatever is available, with meat, potatoes and vegetables in some combination. The name could be a reference to the golfing term for a “do-over” as a hobo stew might originally have been made from leftovers.
