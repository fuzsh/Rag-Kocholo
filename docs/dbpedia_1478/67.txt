Mulligan Stew aka Hobo Stew Recipe

June 3, 2022

Like many recipes, the naming origins of Mulligan Stew are a bit murky. Mulligan stew is defined as “a stew made from whatever ingredients are available” and its first-known use dates to 1894. It’s essentially a combination of meat, potatoes, and vegetables, in any and all combinations. That means there’s a ton of variety in the recipes from family to family.

It is also believed that the stew actually originated in Ireland. ‘Mulligan’ is a stand-in term referring to any Irishman or person. Mulligan Stew is essentially a classic Irish stew that is now typically made with beef not mutton. Mulligan’s stew, also known as community stew, was often eaten during the Great Depression, and in camps of migratory workers (hobos).

Mulligan stew is a family friendly easy stew made with tender beef stew meat, potatoes, corn, carrots, peas, green beans and a perfect blend of Italian spices. It is easily made in a Dutch oven or can be adapted for a slow cooker. You can also use frozen vegetables to save money & time.
