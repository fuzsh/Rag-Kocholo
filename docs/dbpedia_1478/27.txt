A fan of popular music, Terry David Mulligan is well known all across Canada for his television work with MuchMusic, CBC’s Good Rockin’ Tonight, while also working on an acting career in film, stage and television. He has been producing and hosting Mulligan Stew since 1995. It’s jazz, blues, rock, folk, roots and world music, all in one glorious mix. That’s why it’s called a Stew – all the ingredients find their place in the pot. For every classic track that’s stood the harsh test of time, there’s a new artist you may never had heard of, one with something special to offer. Just like a great wine, the blend is everything. Try a spoonful of Mulligan Stew for yourself.
