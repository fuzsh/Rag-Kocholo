But, by combining more than one of the topics into one episode, there is plenty to cover in a weekly episode. \nSo, this week, I'm talking about how to safely and practically circle a Tom that is uncooperative. I also am talking about things that we can do to minimize our presence on the turkeys that we hunt while in the woods. \nThis is a turkey mulligan stew. Listen in! I hope you enjoy it!",
