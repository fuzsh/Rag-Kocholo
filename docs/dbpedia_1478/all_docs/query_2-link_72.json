        "text": "If I owned my own golf course like Willie Nelson — maybe the IRS owns it now — I wouldn’t have needed to hit one.\n\nPlaying his own course one day Willie was asked by a writer accompanying him what the par was on the hole they were playing. He said, “It’s whatever I say and today it looks like 17.”\n\nEven though I’m not very good, I keep score when I play golf so when digging divots with the CEO near SWMW one day I chose to hit a “Mulligan” after my drive was miserable. It gave me pause to consider who was the first golfer to hit a “Mulligan.”\n\nIt’s a 20th century story in the time frame when my Dad was playing golf (had he been the first it might have been called a “Willard” instead of a “Mulligan”).\n\nHowever, there was a real Mulligan; he was a Canadian golfer who at one time managed the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City.\n\nAs the story goes — and the United States Golf Association cites three of them — David Mulligan was playing the Country Club of Montreal golf course with three friends in the 1920s. Dave hit a particularly poor tee shot, re-teed and hit again. He called it a “correction shot” (I have more of those than regular shots) but his friends thought it more appropriate to name it after him.\n\nMulligan then brought the practice to the fabled U.S. golf club Winged Foot. That’s version one.\n\nThe second explanation says that Mulligan was so jumpy after making a difficult drive over the Victoria Bridge to the course that he requested a second shot because his arms were still weak.\n\nThe third, less believable attempt, is that he overslept and was rushing to get ready for the tee time.\n\nThe USGA is content with those, but there’s another Mulligan.\n\nJohn A. “Buddy” Mulligan was a locker room attendant at Essex Fells Country Club in New Jersey. When he finished cleaning the locker room the assistant pro would let him play a round with him and another member, a reporter. One day Buddy’s first shot was so bad and he beseeched his playing partners for another try. When they said yes he told members in the locker room of his “free” second shot and they called it a “Mulligan” after him.\n\nThe USGA prefers their version(s) and I don’t care as long as I can have a “Mulligan” (or several) after one of my errant shots.\n\n• My efforts contribute a few. Approximately 25 million tennis balls are used each year worldwide.\n\n• Early 20th century gangster Pretty Boy Floyd had an unusual way of keeping score. For each person he killed he put a notch on his pocket watch. After his death law officers counted 10 notches."
