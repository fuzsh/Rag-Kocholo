Daylight saving Sunday morning is one.\n\nWe’ve got early flowers on Vancouver Island.\n\n(What’s your first sign you watch for?)\n\nI found lots of Spring songs. Most were ballads, which is not exactly Saturday night music.\n\nBut I did find Bahamas, Vampire Weekend, 2 Beatle tracks, Ron Sexsmith, and Nathaniel Rateliff.\n\nLive tracks from Van Morrison, Traffic, and Fred Eaglesmith.\n\nThere are great new songs from Kasey Musgrave and the amazing Teddy Swims.\n\nClassic tracks from U2, Beach Boys, Clash, Johnny Cash, and Waterboys.\n\nTwo songs with the same title but very different songs – Deeper Well.\n\nAnd because they’re being remembered on stages in Edmonton on Saturday night got some Linda Ronstadt and Everly Brothers.\n\nWe remember the release of John Wesley Harding by Bob Dylan. Acoustic Nashville music right in the middle of the Beatles/Stones British Invasion.\n\nWe play Bob, Kris Kristofferson and Duke Robillard.\n\nJust a last-minute addition to the weekend..\n\nGrant Lawrence (The Smugglers, CBC Podcast, multiple best-selling books) is on the road with his Stories and Song LIve.\n\nGrant and Joel Plaskett, Ashleigh Ball, played Mary Winspear Centre in Sidney by the Sea north of Victoria Thursday night.\n\nFriday on Galiano Island and Saturday in Maple Ridge with his love Jill Barber added.\n\nWe met at The Five and Dime Diner across from the venue and talked for 20 or so minutes about EVERYTHING.\n\nHe told the story of two teens, Grant and Nardwuar knocking on my front door Halloween night to ask questions about their favourite bands. I did the best I could and sent them along with extra promo records. Grant still has his.\n\nWe’ve been friends for 36 years. That’s the kind of podcast this will be. Corey Woods (Associate Producer) shot it on video as well..so it’s also on terrydavidmulligan YouTube channel.\n\nDo the clock thang!!!\n\nPLAYLIST:\n\nMulligan Stew Terry David Mulligan Donor supported tumbling dice Linda Ronstadt Simple Dreams when will will I be loved Everly Brothers Hey Doll Baby More than a love song Black Pumas Chronicles of a Diamond Running Norah Jones Visions The Stew – Year 28 Coming up – Spring Songs NEXT Johnny Cash and Aretha In my life Johnny Cash CASH A change is going to come Aretha Franklin I never loved a man (way i loved you) Mulligan Stew Celebrating John Wesley Harding Bob Dylan All along the Watchtower Bob Dylan John Wesley Harding I’ll be your baby, tonight (live) Kris Kristopherson and Willie Nelson Extras Down along the Cove Duke Robillard Guitar Groove-a-Rama Deane House River Cafe Mulligan Stew with or without you U2 The Joshua Tree Once were brothers The Waterboys All Souls Hill Blue Moon Drive Iskwe.

The day he lost his battle with cancer.\n\nBlind almost at birth, Jeff learned the secrets of playing guitar when he decided to lay his guitar down on his lap and literally attack the strings with all fingers.\n\nOur guest is Roger Costa who’s the co-administrator and archivist of the Estate of Jeff Healey.\n\nCurrently, he’s producing See the Light. The Jeff Healey Story. All these years later, still an amazing story.\n\nWe surround the brief interview with new music from Dan Mangan, Corb Lund, and former Carolina Chocolate Drops bandmates Dom Flemons and Rhiannon Giddens.\n\nWe start The Stew with All Over Now by Rod Stewart and Faces and 2 hours later finish The Stew with the same guys. Both tracks live and both on vinyl.\n\nArt Bergmann\n\nLou Reed,\n\nTaj Mahal\n\nTower of Power with Huey Lewis\n\nTedeschi Trucks\n\nBonnie Raitt\n\nPaul Butterfield Blues Band,\n\nBob Marley and the Wailers\n\nRobert Plant/Allison Krauss\n\nEtta James\n\nHumble Pie\n\nHappy March ALL!\n\nPLAYLIST:\n\nMulligan Stew March 2 Terry David Mulligan Remembering Jeff Healey All over now (live) Rod Stewart/Faces Live – Coast to Coast.

I completely agree.\n\nHe brings memories of Ian and their time together. Corb also shares his thoughts on how his audiences are different depending on where he’s playing and how the songs of Alberta and cowboy life are received in the rest of Canada, The US and Japan.\n\nFor El Viejo Corb and the Hurtin’ Albertans played live, letting the songs reveal themselves. It was all captured by CKUA Alumni Scott Franchuk.\n\nCorby describes it as “organic”.\n\nWe talked about his name “is that the name of the band?”\n\nTouched on his time with The Smalls and how this music connects to those days. “half urban/indy and half cowboys/ranchers”\n\nWe touched on Hearts on Fire Michael Barclay’s book on “6 years that changed Canadian music” which in its promo mentioned cowboys who used to play speed metal.\n\n“the alt-country music in the late 90’s and 2000’s was littered with x-punks who suddenly discovered acoustic guitar.”\n\nThat’s Corb. The Poet Laureate of the Albertan people.\n\nMarch 5 Corb is in Vancouver at The Orpheum\n\nMarch 7 Grey Eagle Calgary\n\nMarch 9 Midway Edmonton\n\nMarch 22 Zankel Hall / Carnegie Hall NYC\n\nMay 28 Amsterdam\n\nAnd multiple dates in Europe with The Dead South.\n\nFYI – The MS Podcast is the whole conversation – it has some very interesting exchanges, opinions and storytelling.\n\nAnd the video version can be seen and heard on the Terry david Mulligan YouTube Channel.\n\nHour Two in this week’s Stew is actually only 30 minutes long.\n\nI’m going to be talking to singer/songwriter Wyatt C Louis.\n\nWyatt then takes the Cold Bones Stage at 6:30.\n\nThere is so much promise in his music and voice. His songs are thoughtful but best of all memorable.\n\nThe most interesting music I’ve heard in a while. See if you don’t agree.\n\nWyatt’s new album “Chandler” is released on May 24. He’s touring with William Prince on\n\nMonday, Feb 26 N/Jube\n\nTuesday, Feb 27 S/Jube\n\nWyatt is nehiyaw (Plains Cree)\n\nFrom Montana First Nation in Maskwacis (Treaty 6 Territory)\n\nBy the way the C in Wyatt’s name is “Chandler” and thus the album title.\n\n-TDM\n\nPLAYLIST:\n\nMulligan Stew with TDM Guests Corb Lund & Wyatt C Louis CKUA at Cold Bones Festival if i had a boat The Bros.

They had played the night before in Clear Lake Iowa.\n\nFor those who know the name but not the story behind Buddy and Ritchie both these CKUA shows will be a primer.\n\nIf you are a fan..all those memories will come flooding back.\n\nBuddy especially wrote about love and romance. He wasn’t as scary as Little Richard and Jerry Lee and had none of the sexy swagger of Elvis but he HAD the songs. The early hits he recorded at the Norman Petty Studios in Clovis New Mexico.\n\n(Barry Allen and Wes Dakus and the Rebels recorded their early hits at Norman Petty’s studio in Clovis New Mexico and came back with tales of amazing Buddy and producer Norman)\n\nIn the late 50’s and early 60’s Buddy’s songs were heard all over the World..\n\nWhich is why on their first records, The Beatles and The Stones included Buddy Holly covers.\n\nBuddy was 22\n\nBopper 28.\n\nRitchie was only 17\n\nRitchie Valens was the first star to make Chicano rock music. He had only been releasing hits for less than a year but would be huge. Driving the hit bus was La Bamba. Another was the Leiber-Stoller song Framed with Carol Kaye on bass and Earl Palmer on drums.\n\nThe Stew is going to play tracks from Ritchie and Buddy plus bands influenced by these artists.\n\n*Footnote…\n\nBuddy’s bassist gave up his seat on the plane to a sick Big Bopper. His name is Waylon Jennings.\n\nAnd the night Buddy sang in Clear Lake, standing right in front of him watching his every move and listening to every note was a very young Bob Dylan. Dylan still talks about that night and that singer.\n\nAlso on Saturdays “Stew” The first-hour donor had a short but fine wish list. Taj Mahal, Susan Tedeschi and Los Lobos.\n\nThey are fully covered. Including Taj and Los Lobos together plus Susan and Tedeschi Trucks jamming with Taj in a dressing room – Taj was teaching TTB his version of Leaving Trunk. It’s simply electric.\n\nNew Music from\n\nMark Knopfler\n\nThe Strumbellas\n\nPretenders\n\nCeleigh Cardinal\n\nAdrian Sutherland\n\nBahamas\n\nThe Black Keys\n\nRobbie Robertson\n\nCome on – turn it UP\n\nINTERVIEW Next week – Alan Doyle\n\nPLAYLIST:\n\nThe February Stews Terry David Mulligan CKUA – Donor Supported almost 100 years West LA Fadeaway Los Lobos Tin Can Trust Angel from Montgomery Susan Tedeschi Just won’t burn Queen Bee Taj Mahal Swinging Sextet Live at The Church in Tulsa I’m so proud Boz Scaggs A fool to care It’s all right Curtis Mayfield and The Impressions Get Ready Mulligan Stew – TDM coming up new Mark Knopfler playlist – mulliganstewdotca Ahead of the game Mark Knopfler One Deep River Rehab – Live on Jools Holland Amy Winehouse AMY Soundtrack My home is you The Strumbellas Holster This is The February Stew Year 28 TDMulligan NEXT – Mavis – also a wild ‘leaving trunk’ What you gonna do?
