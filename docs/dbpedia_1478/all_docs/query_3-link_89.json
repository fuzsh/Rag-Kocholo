We had an Arthur Godfrey album of patriotic songs for children (with children's chorus), an record made by Miss Jean of \"Romper Room\" (something about manners and etiquette), HR Puffenstuff, featuring Mama Cass, just to mention a few.\n\nQuoting:\n\nBy the by, I would pay much $$ for the Mulligans Stew, Romper Room (did she ever look through the mirror and say your name?), & HR Puffn'Stuff albums if you ever want to sell! ;D\n\nEnd Quote\n\nI'd sell 'em if I had 'em, but they vanished with the rest of my childhood. I often think back on individual toys and possessions I had as a kid, and wonder exactly when they disappeared and where they went. That's why Puffn'Stuff and Captain Kangaroo records are so valuable. We never gave them a second thought as we careened into adolescence. They ended up rotting in some attic or sold for pennies at a tag sale.\n\nIf I had only kept all my Star Wars toys in their factory packages and hermetically sealed, I could now pay off all my debts!! ;)"
