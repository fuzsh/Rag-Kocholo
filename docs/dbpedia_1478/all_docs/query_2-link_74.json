        "text": "Hailing from my home state of Kentucky, Burgoo is a rich and hearty, stick-to-your-ribs stew that will keep you full for no less than 3 days. It packs a major punch, as it is absolutely filled with meat and veggies and is served piping hot with fresh cornbread, biscuits or rolls alongside. My Kentucky Burgoo Recipe here is pretty classic, except that I opt for EITHER pork or beef when making it, as opposed to using both. This is primarily to keep things budget-friendly and a bit more weeknight friendly as well. But please know that if you want to use both beef chuck and pork shoulder in yours … you should GO FOR IT.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nToggle\n\nKentucky Burgoo Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is Burgoo?\n\nOriginating from Kentucky, Burgoo is a rich and hearty stew that is filled with vegetables and at least three different types of meat. Similar to a Brunswick Stew, Irish stew, or Mulligan stew, Burgoo is often served outdoors and at large gatherings or fundraisers since it feeds so many people, so very well.\n\nWhat meats are traditionally used in Burgoo?\n\nThe rule of thumb when making Burgoo, is to use no less than three different meats. You’ll typically see pork, beef, and chicken used. In my recipe here, I opt for bacon, pork shoulder, and boneless/skinless chicken thighs. But you can swap meats in and out for the three I’ve listed, as that’s really the point here. Traditionally, a Burgoo was meant to be a meal to help use up any “roadside odds and ends” you’d find outside, or from hunting, etc. Oh, how I love my Appalachian roots, y’all.\n\nWhere did Burgoo originate?\n\nWhile Burgoo recipes can be found all across central Appalachia – from Virginia and West Virginia to Indiana and Ohio, Kentucky lays claim to its origin story, murky thought it may be.\n\nWhat does Burgoo taste like?\n\nThis Kentucky Burgoo Recipe tastes like vegetable beef/pork stew, but the most insanely delicious one you’ve ever tried. The fact that we’re building everything on bacon drippings and using SO many different vegetables, aromatics, and seasonings means that we’re in for one wild ride in one single pot.\n\nCan Burgoo be made in a slow cooker?\n\nBurgoo can absolutely be made in a slow cooker. In fact, it might be the perfect recipe for a slow cooker, because it just gets better and more tender the longer it simmers. To prepare Burgoo in a slow cooker, just follow the recipe through the meat browning steps (on the stovetop). So, you will cook the bacon, pork, and chicken in a pan on the stove, to give them a nice crust and really seal in the flavors. Technically, you could skip this and just put everything in your slow cooker and call it good. But your stew will be better for it, if you take the time to brown everything first.\n\nAfter the meat is all browned, you can transfer everything directly into a slow cooker. Give it all a stir to mix it well, taste for seasoning, and then slow cook on low for 8 hours, or on high for 4 to 5 hours, just until the meat is pull-apart tender.\n\nWhat is the difference between Burgoo and Brunswick Stew?\n\nThere is very little difference between the two recipes, as they contain many of the same ingredients and the cooking method applied is essentially the same as well. However, sometimes the ingredients will vary a little bit, and reflect the location of their origin. For example, traditional Kentucky burgoo recipes will contain mutton and lamb, whereas a Brunswick Stew would never contain either one of those.\n\nBut there is major crossover between the two dishes, that is for sure. If you happen to have my second cookbook, Southern Lights, there is a healthier take on a Brunswick Stew that I always enjoy and have made SO many times. Whatever you want to call it, this hearty and substantial combination of simple ingredients is always a hit.\n\nWhat is Burgoo served with?\n\nKentucky Burgoo is typically served with cornbread or biscuits, or just warm bread. This is to help sop and soak up all of the delicious stew juices, so as to not waste a single drop. Liquid gold I tell you.\n\nHow to Make My Ultimate Kentucky Burgoo Recipe\n\nMy Kentucky Burgoo Recipe is mostly traditional, save for the fact that I do not employ both pork shoulder and beef chuck roast together in one pot. Sometimes I will use beef, and sometimes I will use pork. But I find that using them together, along with the bacon or chicken, creates such an expensive pot of food that it almost deters me from making it, or sharing the recipe with others to do the same. To me, this recipe was born from humble beginnings, and is meant to reflect that in its makeup. But that’s just me.\n\nYou should use whatever combination of meats you like, as this pot is your playground. Just follow the recipe as it’s written, browning off your cuts of meat and then putting them back in the stew to simmer away in the oven.\n\nDIRECTIONS\n\nPreheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Adjust the rack to the middle position.\n\nHeat a large oven-proof (lidded) pot or Dutch Oven over medium heat. Cook the bacon until browned and crispy, about 6 to 8 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the bacon to a paper towel lined plate and set aside now, leaving the drippings behind.\n\nSeason the pork and chicken with salt and pepper and, working in batches as needed, brown it all in the hot bacon grease for a few minutes per side. You can add a little oil to the pan, if necessary. When each batch is browned, transfer to a large plate or tray for now.\n\nDrain off any excess liquid and oil from the pot. Still working over medium heat, add a couple tablespoons of oil to the pot and when it’s hot, add the onion, bell pepper, and potatoes. Season lightly with salt and pepper, along with the poultry seasoning. Cook until the veggies have had a chance to tenderize, about 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the okra, corn, Lima beans, and garlic and cook for a couple of minutes. Add the stock concentrate and tomatoes to the pot, along with the browned pork and chicken. Add about 3 cups of the stock (really just enough to fully submerge everything) and the Worcestershire sauce, stirring to blend everything.\n\nPut the lid on the pot, and put it in the oven to stew for three hours or until the pork is super tender and easily sliced or shredded with a fork. You can add a little more of the remaining stock, if needed, to achieve the body and consistency you’d like. Serve in bowls, topped with chopped chives or scallions to taste and warm bread for dipping.\n\nWhat You’ll Need to Make This Ultimate Kentucky Burgoo Recipe\n\nIt’s the ingredients that really define a Burgoo, separating it from other stews of similar nature such as Mulligan, Irish, or Brunswick. You must use at least three meats to claim it is a burgo, though I like to encourage people to use whatever meats they see fit. Traditionally, you’ll see people using pork shoulder, bone-in and skin-on chicken thighs, and beef chuck roast. For my money, I typically use bacon, boneless skinless chicken thighs, and pork shoulder. This keeps the cost lower and more reasonable, and it creates a truly wonderful flavor in the end.\n\nThe addition of stock concentrate is optional, though it definitely contributes to a greater depth of flavor in the end and I highly recommend using it. Any variety you like should work beautifully.\n\nAs I always say, the number of garlic cloves I suggest is really flexible. This recipe has a lot going on, so it can carry a ton of garlic and it is all the better for those cloves. Trust me.\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\n8 slices bacon\n\nOlive oil or cooking oil, as needed\n\n3 to 3.5 pounds pork shoulder, cut into 1 to 2-inch pieces\n\n3 or 4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs\n\nSalt and pepper, as needed\n\n1 small to medium yellow onion, diced (see note)\n\n1 green bell pepper, diced\n\n24 ounces small gold or red potatoes, quartered (or halved if very small)\n\n1 tablespoon poultry seasoning\n\n10 to 12 ounces frozen sliced okra\n\n10 to 12 ounces frozen corn (canned is fine)\n\n10 to 12 ounces frozen lima beans (canned is fine)\n\n6 garlic cloves, minced or grated\n\n2 heaping teaspoons stock concentrate (any variety/flavor you like)\n\n28-ounce can crushed tomatoes\n\n32-ounces chicken stock\n\n1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce\n\nServing Suggestions: fresh warm bread, cornbread, or biscuits for dipping, chopped chives or scallions\n\nDirections for Storing this Kentucky Burgoo Recipe\n\nAllow the stew to come all the way down to room temperature before transferring it to your storage container. A lidded plastic container or a zip-top plastic bag will do the trick. To freeze it, I like to put it in a freezer-safe bag. It will keep in the fridge for you for up to 5 days amd in the freezer for 3 months.\n\nTo reheat, just thaw your frozen burgoo in the refrigerator. Transfer it to a pot and gently reheat over medium low, and then medium until bubbling and piping hot.\n\nWhat to serve with this Kentucky Burgoo Recipe\n\nBurgoo is typically served with cornbread or biscuits, and it really requires some sort of bready thing to sop and soak up all of that delicious stew juice (that’s a thing). Even a boring slice of sandwich bread would do the trick, if I’m being completely honest with you.\n\nI often make my favorite angel biscuits for this Kentucky Burgoo Recipe occasion, as they perfectly walk the line between roll and biscuit. This helps an indecisive gal like myself, when I just can’t choose. But, my cream cheese dinner rolls or sweet potato rolls would be really nice, too. Heck, my super decadent giant salted maple butter parker house rolls would be PERFECT with this ultra savory pot of food.\n\nIf you like the looks of my Kentucky Burgoo Recipe, you might also enjoy:\n\nCarne Guisada Inspired Vegetable Beef Stew\n\nColombian Chicken Stew\n\nWest African Peanut Stew\n\nEthiopian Doro Wat Recipe\n\nOur Favorite Easy Mughlai Chicken\n\nPrint\n\nThe Ultimate Kentucky Burgoo Recipe (one-pot and easy)\n\nI follow the diehard rule of using (at least) three meats in my Kentucky Burgoo recipe, opting for tender pork, smoky bacon, and affordable, juicy boneless/skinless chicken thighs. Traditionally you might also see beef in the mix, along with bone-in/skin on chicken pieces. But for my time and money, choosing between pork and beef is usually the best way to go.\n\nAuthor: Lauren McDuffie\n\nYield: Serves 6 to 8 1x\n\nCategory: Stew\n\n8 slices bacon\n\nOlive oil or cooking oil, as needed\n\n3 to 3.5 pounds pork shoulder, cut into 1 to 2-inch pieces\n\n3 or 4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs\n\nSalt and pepper, as needed\n\n1 small to medium yellow onion, diced (see note)\n\n1 green bell pepper, diced\n\n24 ounces small gold or red potatoes, quartered (or halved if very small)\n\n1 tablespoon poultry seasoning\n\n10 to 12 ounces frozen sliced okra\n\n10 to 12 ounces frozen corn (canned is fine)\n\n10 to 12 ounces frozen lima beans (canned is fine)\n\n6 garlic cloves, minced or grated\n\n2 heaping teaspoons stock concentrate (any variety/flavor you like)\n\n28-ounce can crushed tomatoes\n\n32–ounces chicken stock\n\n1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce\n\nServing Suggestions: fresh warm bread for dipping, chopped chives or scallions\n\nCook Mode Prevent your screen from going dark\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat the oven to 325 degrees F.

But this is usually only done when an exact amount is not required. Your onion may be bigger than my onion here, and it’s perfectly fine. The amount is approximate, and can be whatever you think looks right. Exactness need not apply here.\n\nKeywords: Kentucky Burgoo Recipe\n\nShare via:"
