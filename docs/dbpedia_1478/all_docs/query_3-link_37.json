        "text": "“ This is a hobo. I found him on the way to school. ” — Sharie\n\n\"Another Story About Socks\" is the fifth chapter of Wayside School Is Falling Down.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nSharie brings in a sock-hating hobo for show-and-tell.\n\nPlot[]\n\nThis chapter opens with Sharie bringing in a hobo for show-and-tell. She introduces him, saying that she found him on the way to school. A brief description of the hobo is given, showing that he has long dirty hair, and a scraggly beard. He wears a coat too large for him, but not as large as Sharie's coat. He wears jeans covered in colorful patches, and shoes that look too big for his feet, though this may be due to the fact he doesn't wear socks. Mrs. Jewls asks Sharie to tell the class about her hobo, so she introduces him, telling the class his name is Bob, and that he tried to ask a lady for spare change, but the lady told him to take a bath. Sharie tried giving him a quarter, but he refused because he doesn't take money from kids. He likes kids, because he too was a kid once.\n\nMrs. Jewls asks if anyone wants to ask a question to Hobo Bob, and everyone in class raises their hand. Jason asks Bob when the last time he took a bath was, but Hobo Bob remarks that he never takes baths, and only gets showers whenever it rains, which Myron finds unfair, because each time it rains, he has to go inside. Joe asks where he lives, and Hobo Bob remarks that he lives wherever he can, going south when it gets too cold, and going north when it gets too hot. Leslie asks why he isn't wearing socks, and Hobo Bob remarks that he doesn't believe in socks. Todd asks if he ever gets in trouble, and Bob notes that he didn't because he was a good kid. Paul asks if he likes to pull girls' pigtails, and Bob asks who doesn't. Maurecia asks if Bob likes ice cream, and Bob states that he loves it. Jenny asks him about his favorite subject, and Hobo Bob notes that he likes spelling, and once he got first place in a spelling bee. Dameon asks why he doesn't have a job despite the fact he's a good speller, and Hobo Bob notes no one would hire him because he doesn't wear socks. Eric Fry asks why he doesn't wear socks, but Hobo Bob once again states he doesn't believe in socks.\n\nHobo Bob calls on Rondi, who asks what he eats, and Hobo Bob notes that he eats Mulligan stew. Stephen asks why it's called that, and Bob remarks that there was a hobo named Mulligan that made the first Mulligan stew. Todd asks if he was a good cook, but Hobo Bob notes he wasn't because he was eaten by cannibals, much to the class's (minus Dana who thought he said \"cannonballs\") disgust. Allison asks why he can't wear socks, even if he doesn't believe in them, but this sends Hobo Bob into a fury. He asks why the class keeps asking him about socks and why he doesn't wear them, and notes that Albert Einstein never wore socks so he shouldn't either. Eric Ovens and D.J. wonder who Albert Einstein is, which Mrs. Jewls answers. Joy asks why he never wore socks, and Hobo Bob notes that it's because socks make you stupid. Mrs. Jewls thinks Albert Einstein was just so busy, he never bothered to wear socks, but Hobo Bob notes that on the day he won the spelling bee, he also forgot his socks. Mac tells Hobo Bob about one time he lost his sock and couldn't find it, and is surprised when Hobo Bob was able to know it'd be in the refrigerator.\n\nAlthough the students in Mrs. Jewls's class had many more questions for Hobo Bob, Mrs. Jewls rings her cowbell, because show-and-tell is over. The class thanks Bob for his excellent presentation. Sharie helps Bob find his way out of the school and after getting instructions, waves to the class while Sharie takes her seat. After he leaves, the students take his notion about not believing in socks to heart and remove their own socks right before their weekly spelling test.\n\nCharacters[]\n\nSharie\n\nHobo Bob (debut)\n\nMaurecia\n\nMrs. Jewls\n\nJason\n\nMyron\n\nJoe\n\nLeslie\n\nTodd\n\nPaul\n\nJenny\n\nDameon\n\nCalvin\n\nEric Fry\n\nRondi\n\nMulligan (mentioned)\n\nStephen\n\nDana\n\nAlbert Einstein (mentioned)\n\nEric Ovens\n\nD.J.\n\nJoy\n\nMac\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe chapter's title is reference to \"Homework\", which was also at least partly about socks.\n\nEric Fry and Eric Ovens appear in this chapter, but not Eric Bacon.\n\nThis is Hobo Bob's only physical appearance, though he is mentioned later in \"The Lost Ear\".\n\nBob mentioning going south when it gets too cold may be a nod to how birds and other animals migrate south for the winter.\n\nContrary to what Hobo Bob said, Mulligan stew wasn't actually invented by someone named Mulligan. The stew is simply Irish stew that hobos make using whatever food they can find. \"Mulligan\" is a term used for Irishmen.\n\nBelieve it or not, Albert Einstein actually did prefer not to wear to socks.\n\nGallery[]"
