        "text": "hello\n\nKevin Kane and The Hooper Brothers Chris and Tommy have been an original Canadian band for over 40 years.\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath.\n\nSame three guys. Still making music.\n\nThis podcast is their first complete band interview in over 10 years.\n\nLike many, I had presumed that the guys had moved on to solo efforts or other bands or other dreams.\n\nWhen I saw that they were playing and selling out The Carleton in Halifax I started to dig and found – amazed – that they were in fact playing the Filberg Festival in Comox, Vancouver Island on August 3.\n\nAlso Edmonton, The Maritimes, Vernon and The Dream Café in Penticton.\n\nBringing with them songs containing people’s memories, whole lifetimes.\n\nPeace of Mind\n\nYou may be right\n\nThese days\n\nAnd the still brilliant…\n\nAll the things I wasn’t.\n\nPlatinum records, multiple tours of Canada, the USA and Europe.\n\nIn 1992 they went separate ways only to rediscover the power of their friendship and music in 2010 at a festival in Surrey, BC.\n\nThe same three guys…Let’s celebrate The Grapes of Wrath. Enjoy the stories and the music.\n\nTour Dates:\n\nwww.grapesofwrath.ca\n\nhello\n\nIt all started as a single interview about the Edmonton Folk Festival. We seemed to be talking about the “other“ festivals and could they survive the Covid years.\n\nThat conversation turned into the first group interview with the artistic directors of Calgary, Winnipeg, Canmore and Vancouver Folk Festivals.\n\nIt was fun and informative, so I’m hoping to make it a yearly gathering.\n\nHere’s the guest lineup this year.\n\nThey each bring with them stories of the artists they booked and why.\n\nDoug Cox – July 12-14 Vancouver Island Music Festival (Courtney)\n\nChris Frayer – July 11-14 Winnipeg Folk Festival\n\nFiona Black – July 19-21 Vancouver Folk Festival\n\nKerry Clark – July 25-28 Calgary Folk Festival\n\nJenna Klein Waller – Aug 3-5 Canmore Folk Festival\n\nTerry Wickham – Aug 8-11 Edmonton Folk Festival\n\nThis week our interview guests are…\n\nArtistic Directors of Vancouver Island Music Festival (Doug Cox) & Winnipeg Folk Festival\n\n(Chris Frayer)\n\nBoth festivals start next weekend. Next Saturday it’s Fiona Black from Vancouver FF and Kerry Clark from Calgary FF. Bringing insights into their artist guest list and special events.\n\nThe complete interviews can be seen on the terrydavidmulligan YouTube Channel\n\nhello\n\nThey are Canadian music royalty. Who better to have joined us on the Canada Day weekend than Greg Keelor and Jim Cuddy from Blue Rodeo?\n\nAND Jim brings his 6th solo album All the World Fades Away.\n\nThere is much to talk about. In the first half of the Podcast Greg and Jim take us through Blue Rodeo’s plans for their 40th year together in 2025.\n\nTaking part in the Lightfoot celebration at Massey Hall. Being inducted into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame.. Then Greg bugs out and Jim and I talk about his 6th solo album with The Jim Cuddy band.\n\nIt’s called All the world fades away and it’s a beauty.\n\nStories about his Father, our friend the late John Mann and his family, his early years on The Yukon, and his duet with Greg on the solo album. The dialogue between the two of them on the meaning of the song is WILD!\n\nWe talk tours and plans for the year. Comments about playing the Canmore and Edmonton Folk Festivals this summer. Our thanks to the boys…\n\nEnjoy – Happy Canada Day\n\nhello\n\nTwo remarkable guests this week\n\nCeleigh Cardinal and her new album Boundless Possibilities and Bridget Kearney – Bassist and songwriter for Lake Street Dive\n\nBoth guests have albums that came out Friday.\n\nCeleigh Cardinal has her latest dropping Friday – Boundless Possibilities.\n\nPersonally written songs that describe the feelings of losing her son’s Father in a murder and the death of a friend by suicide. Also surviving the pain and loss and changing her life forever.\n\nIt’s not your average album and certainly not your average interview. Open, bare and loving.\n\nThe second guest is Bridget Kearney. Bassist, vocalist and songwriter for Lake Street Dive. The album is Good Together and after 20 years together, they’ve decided to write songs and play together in the same room. It shows in the exceptional songs.\n\nThey appeared this week on Colbert and they’re on tour. One of the dates is Madison Square Garden.\n\nhello\n\nThe Stew is Bruce Cockburn..bringing stories of his 35th album O Sun O Moon. Plus memories of Gordon Lightfoot and his place in the music of the World and especially Canada.\n\nAnswers the question: Was/is Gord the Sound of Canada?\n\nCould you hear the space and place in his songs?\n\nThe Podcast is the complete interview with Bruce Cockburn on the release of his 35th album O Sun O Moon. And his thoughts on the music of and the loss of Gordon Lightfoot.\n\nThe YouTube this week is the video version of both conversations.\n\nhello\n\nFor years, there have been multiple wine competitions no matter what country or region.\n\nThe BC wine industry is no exception.\n\nThe latest wine awards are The BC Top 50 wines and Wine of the Year as part of the 2024 Okanagan Spring Wine Festival, which is on now.\n\nFriday night the results were announced at the Penticton Trade and Convention Centre and then hundreds descended on the trade floor to do their own judging.\n\nKimberly Hundertmark, the GM of The Wine Fests said on Tasting Room Radio last week that wineries were asked to send their very best releases.\n\nWe have two guests and dear friends on this Podcast. Both are wine stars and both were judges at this event\n\nDJ Kearney. A Global wine authority, educator and Director of Wine at Terminal City Club. Black Belt.\n\nRhys Pender – Master of Wine. Co-owner of Little Farm Wine in Cawston and owner of Wine Plus. World’s greatest fisherman.\n\nWe can now include here who made the Top 50 wines list and which winery won Wine of the Year\n\nWINE OF THE YEAR\n\nDirty Laundry Vineyard\n\nCellar Series Gamay\n\n2022\n\nBC TOP 50 Winery Name Brand Name Vintage 3Benches Estate Winery Hillside White 2022 Bench 1775 Winery Blanc de Blanc 2020 Black Swift Vineyards Hans Estate Malbec 2018 Bordertown Vineyard & Estate Winery Merlot 2019 Chaberton Estate Winery Cabernet Franc Reserve 2019 Chaberton Estate Winery La Fleur de Chaberton 2023 Crown & Thieves Chenin Blanc 2022 Culmina Family Estate Winery Unicus 2022 Culmina Family Estate Winery Cabernet Sauvignon 2020 Deep Roots Winery Syrah 2021 Evolve Cellars Brut Rose 2018 Four Shadows Winery Riesling Classic 2023 French Door Estate Winery Malbec 2022 Gidda Family Estates One Block Zweigelt 2020 Gneiss Wines The Chief Reserve 2020 Hester Creek Estate Winery GSM 2022 Hester Creek Estate Winery Viognier 2023 Hillside Winery & Bistro Cabernet Franc 2020 Hillside Winery & Bistro Chef’s Whites 2023 Inniskillin Okanagan Estate Winery Estate Riesling Icewine 2022 JoieFarm Winery Secrest Mountain Pinot Noir 2022 Kismet Estate Winery Syrah Family Select 2021 Lakeside Cellars Rose 2022 Moon Curser Vineyards Touriga Nacional 2022 Moraine Estate Winery Estate Pinot Noir 2022 Mt.

So it all feels like three steps forward and two back\n\nKimberly Hundertmark, the GM of Okanagan Wine Festivals brings great news. Right now, they are kicking off the Spring Wine Festival all over the Okanagan Valley. It’s an amazing collection of events. Huge gatherings like 2024 BC Top 50 and the Wine of the Year. The TASTE series, carefully curated in locations North and South, the Naramata Bench this Sunday, June 2 and the District Wine Village in Oliver Sat-Sun June 8/9 and Saturday, June 8th at the Summer Sips at Spirit Ridge Osoyoos. Kimberly brings all the news and tips for making plans.\n\nThe complete list of events can be found at www.thewinefestivals.com\n\nJohn Skinner is the co-owner/co-founder of Painted Rock Estate Winery, on the Skaha Bench in Okanagan Falls.\n\nIf you go to their website www.paintedrock.ca have a look at the wines but also the awards those wines have won over the years.\n\nPages and pages of awards and outstanding reviews.\n\nJohn’s comments about his wines and two new releases – Rose and Chardonnay can be found on Tasting Room Radio. www.tastingroomradio.com\n\nThese comments by John are about the state of the BC wine industry – the good and not-so-good.\n\nAbove all, it’s John’s belief in BC Wine. He shows leadership and well-thought-out decision-making.\n\nIf you’re interested in supporting the BC wine industry – and I truly hope you are – then John brings clarity and commitment to all of us.\n\nJohn Skinner reminds us that most of these wineries are owned by small farming families.\n\n“support the little wineries first. Find your favourites and support them when you can”"
