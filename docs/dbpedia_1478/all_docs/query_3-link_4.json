        "text": "The Feather and Father Gang\n\n'The Feather and Father Gang' was a crime drama that told the story of a female attorney who finds a way to get her con man father to help her solve crimes. The show aired between December 1976 to July 1977 but had its schedule changing almost every week, making it too hard to know when to tune in to watch the show.\n\nThe show was criticized for trying to imitate 'Switch' and not being very successful at it. The various schedule changes did not help the show take off, and it ended up being canceled after 14 episodes, with the last one airing in July 1977.\n\nThe Fantastic Journey\n\n'The Fantastic Journey' centered around a family that goes on an expedition to the Caribbean. When they reach the deadly Bermuda Triangle, they encounter a green cloud that leaves them shipwrecked and stranded on an island they can't escape. The island is stuck between different time zones.\n\nThe show had a weird plotline to start with, and it didn't help that producers had different visions of where they wanted to take the show. 'The Fantastic Journey' ended up being canceled mid-season with only 10 out of a total of 13 airing.\n\nThe Bob Crane Show\n\n'The Bob Crane Show' is an NBC sitcom that followed Bob, a man in his 40s who decides to quit his boring job as an insurance salesman and go back to med school. While in school, his wife, portrayed by Patricia Harty, has to support the family, which was uncommon at the time.\n\nThe show was a huge disappointment for the network; it had low ratings and only lasted for 13 weeks. The show's failure was blamed on a lack of chemistry between the actors, so NBC decided to cancel it.\n\nSonny Comedy Revue\n\nDespite having a big name attached to it, 'Sonny Comedy Revue' had a hard time getting the audience's attention. Its initial airdate was on September 22, 1974, the same year Sonny and Cher ended their marriage. Weirdly, that didn't stop them from having their own show that same year.\n\nThe show aired on ABC, but sadly the fact that it heavily featured Sonny and barely had Cher meant no one really wanted to watch. Critics said the show was not funny and almost unbearable to watch. No one could get over Cher's absence. The show had consistently low ratings, which led to it being canceled after 13 episodes, with the final episode in December of the same year.\n\nBig John, Little John\n\n'Big John, Little John' was a situational comedy about a 40-year-old teacher who drinks from a mysterious fountain of youth and turns into a 12-year-old boy. The change isn't permanent but occurs at inconvenient times. Despite this creative plot, the show didn't last for more than one season.\n\nIt first aired in September of 1976 on NBC and only ran 13 episodes. By December, the show was already canceled and pretty much forgotten. If for some reason, you still wish to try and watch it, you might be able to find its DVD, which was released in 2009.\n\nThe Associates\n\n'The Associates' was an American sitcom based on a novel written by John Jay Osborn Jr. The show was produced by the same producers of 'Taxi' and starred Wilfrid Hyde-White, Joe Regalbuto, and Shelley Smith. It ended up being nominated for two Golden Globes, but that didn't help it run past its ninth episode.\n\nThe show only survived from September 1979 to April 1980, which, you have to admit, is a pretty short run. Only nine out of thirteen episodes shot made it to air. The four unaired episodes were lost forever, and maybe that's a good thing.\n\nThe Eddie Capra Mysteries\n\nThe 70s brought much distinctive mystery shows to American television, including 'The Eddie Capra Mysteries.' The series starred Vincent Baggetta, who played an unconventional lawyer named Eddie. He tried to solve extremely complex murder cases.\n\nThe show aired on NBC from September to January 1979 and tried to keep Americans caring by challenging them to find out who the murderer was before Eddie Capra did. But, one mystery that is easy to solve is why the show was canceled after only 13 episodes — it just wasn't good enough.\n\nThe Kids From C.A.P.E.R.\n\n'The Kids From C.A.P.E.R.' only ran from September to November 1976. The series satirized popular shows of the time like 'Scooby-Doo Where Are You,' 'Shazam,' and 'Six Million Dollar Man.' It also featured original songs and had two albums released.\n\nDespite all of the efforts put into the show, the parodies just weren't funny enough to make viewers tune in. The show only lasted for 13 episodes and was never renewed for a second season.\n\nThe Great American Dream Machine\n\n'The Great American Dream Machine' premiered in 1971. The skit show featured both satirical and political sketches. Episodes, which were hosted by Marshall Efron, were 90 minutes long. 'The Great American Dream Machine' starred cast members like Chevy Chase, Andy Rooney, and Albert Brooks.\n\nThe show did manage to get a second season, but by then, it was reduced to only 60 minutes per episode. While trying to be the American version of 'Monty Python,' today the show is barely even remembered. Guess its 34 episodes just weren't good enough.\n\nCos\n\n'Cos,' named after famous host Bill Cosby first aired in September 1976. Each episode was 60 minutes long, featuring sketches acted out by an ensemble cast. Despite having Cosby as the show's host as well as his name in the title, the show was unsuccessful.\n\nThe ABC comedy had one season, which only lasted for nine episodes. By the end of November 1976, the production was already canceled due to low ratings. Despite its promising premise, audiences were just not tuning in.\n\nThe Chisholms\n\n'The Chisholms' was a western set in 1844. It followed a family's journey from Virginia to Wyoming. On their way, the family has to deal with Native Americans as well as family fights. It starred Robert Preston as a family patriarch, Rosemary Harris as his wife, and Ben Murphy as the firstborn.\n\nSadly, neither the exciting plot nor the talented actors could save this show. 'The Chisholms' aired on CBS from 1979 to 1980 and had a total of 13 episodes before it was finally canceled.\n\nThe Swiss Family Robinson\n\n'The Swiss Family Robinson' first aired on April 15, 1975. It was an adventure series that lasted for one season between 1975 to 1976. The show was based on a novel by the same name and starred Martin Milner as a man who was stranded on an island along with his wife and two young children.\n\nSadly, due to scheduling problems, some episodes aired as many as four times, which didn't really help keep viewers interested. The show only had 26 episodes, with the final one airing on April 4, 1976. 'The Swiss Family Robinson' was never renewed for a second season.\n\nAmy Prentiss\n\n'Amy Prentiss' starred Jessica Walter as the title character. The show followed Amy, a police investigator who is suddenly promoted to be Chief of Detectives after the death of the previous chief. Amy also had a teenage daughter played by the young Helen Hunt. The show was a spinoff of the show 'Ironside.'\n\nDespite its unique premise, the show was canceled after only three episodes airing between December 1974 and February 1975. Each episode lasted two whole hours, which might have been the reason audiences had a hard time following the show.\n\nVan Dyke & Company\n\nCasting the beloved Dick Van Dyke to star in a show of his own seemed like a sure bet. His show had it all — comedy sketches, singing, and even dancing. It seemed like there was no way this show would ever fail. But, the show had some pretty big competitors to beat, and even Dick Van Dyke wasn't enough to do that.\n\nThe production only lasted for 12 episodes, which was unexpected with such a big star attached. Despite only airing from September to December of 1976, the show won an Emmy, but audiences just did not connect, and the show was canceled.\n\nThe Snoop Sisters\n\n'The Snoop Sisters' only lasted for four 90-minute episodes. It starred Mildred Natwick and Helen Hayes as retired sisters who try to solve mysteries. Wistfully, the show's four episodes were aired over the span of two years, which made it difficult for audiences to follow or care about the show.\n\nThis NBC mystery program ended up being canceled, partly because of a controversy that it sparked when Alice Cooper, the popular rock star, appeared on the show. The episode he appeared in was titled 'The Devil Made Me Do It,' and you can guess audiences didn't like that one bit.\n\nThe Sixth Sense\n\n'The Sixth Sense' was a 1972 ABC show that followed bizarre stories about ghosts and ESPs. The show did last longer than many others on this list, with two seasons — the first one had 13 episodes, and the second one had 12.\n\nBut, despite its spooky premise, the show just didn't hold up. Even guest appearances from stars like Joan Crawford, Stephanie Powers, and Steve Forrest couldn't really save the show. It ran for two months and was canceled in December of 1972.\n\nRoll Out\n\n'Roll Out' was a CBS show that was set in World War II; it was based on a true story. It followed drivers who were working for the 5050th Trucking Company, a unit that had to deliver supplies to soldiers. During their off time, the drivers would frequent nightclubs near their base.\n\nThe idea behind the show was to try and emulate the successful 'M*A*S*H,' but that didn't really work. 'Roll Out' first aired on October 3, 1973, but only made it till January 4, 1974. The show was canceled mid-season with only 12 episodes out of a total of 24 airing.\n\nProject UFO\n\n1778's 'Project UFO' sounds like a show that would draw viewers in, but sadly it just couldn't captivate its audience. The show's debut was on February 19th, and its mission was to try and delve into the mysteries of UFO sightings across the US.\n\nMost of the sightings turned out to be fake, which could be part of the reason the show never really took off. Sure, the show had two seasons but was easily forgotten by the nation after its cancelation in 1979. The concept of uncovering mysteries and giving them a rational explanation just isn't fun.\n\nParis\n\n'Paris' was a police drama that ran on CBS in 1979 and starred James Earl Jones as a police captain named Woody Paris. Woody taught Criminology and sought to solve extremely difficult cases. Paris' home life was also portrayed on the show, but that wasn't enough to keep viewers engaged.\n\nThis was partly due to the fact that the show had one of CBS's worst timeslots — Saturdays at 10 p.m. The show was moved to Tuesdays in order to try and save it, but that didn't help improve ratings. In January 1980 the show was canceled with two episodes left unaired.\n\n3 Girls 3\n\n'3 Girls 3' was a 1977 TV show that, sadly, only lasted four episodes. The idea behind the show was to cast three anonymous women to play...three anonymous women and to highlight what happens to people when they experience overnight stardom. These unknown women were Debbie Allen, Ellen Foley, and Mimi Kennedy.\n\nUnfortunately, the writers and producers had a hard time pitching the show, and many networks wanted to cast established actors, which went against the concept of the show. Once the show actually made it to the air, the network, as well audiences, just didn't like it, and it was canceled after four episodes.\n\nMulligan's Stew\n\nThe 1977 sitcom 'Mulligan's Stew' was a comedy-drama series about a family that takes in four orphaned children. Obviously, there were several adjustments to be made, and the show portrayed the personal lives of the family as they grew closer together.\n\nHowever, good acting and a wholesome plot weren't enough to save 'Mulligan's Stew.' By December 1977, NBC canceled the show after just one season, with only 6 episodes having been aired.\n\nMr. T and Tina\n\nPat Morita and Susan Blanchard were the stars of the 1976 TV show, 'Mr. T and Tina'. ABC wanted to make a spin-off from one of the characters of 'Welcome Back, Kotter,' but it didn't go as planned, and the network had to cancel after just nine episodes.\n\nIt was one of the lowest-rated shows of the 1970s, and it followed the story of a Japanese inventor called Taro Takahashi, who lived with an American nanny called Tina Kelly. Unfortunately, the show's comedy was often criticized as too offensive and stereotypical, which is what eventually got it canceled.\n\nMe and the Chimp\n\nProduced by Thomas Miller and Garry Marshall, 'Me and the Chimp' was a comedy sitcom that aired on CBS in 1972. Even though the series' plot was quite original, since it followed a dentist whose daughter brings home a chimpanzee one day, it didn't become a hit show like its producers' other projects, such as 'Laverne and Shirley' and 'Happy Days.'\n\nJust 13 episodes were ever aired, and the dentist's relationship with Buttons the chimpanzee was very short-lived.\n\nThree’s a Crowd\n\n'Three's a Crowd' was an attempt to capitalize on the 'Three's Company' franchise success. The 1979 game show, 'Three's a Crowd,' featured a male participant who had to discover who knew him best: his wife or his secretary.\n\nHonestly, we're shocked that someone ever saw potential in a premise like this. The show caused problems in viewers' marriages and was a flop in general. There was no choice but to cancel it after just a few episodes.\n\nChopper One\n\n'Chopper One' was born in January of 1974. The show was about a police helicopter team in California, focusing on two chopper pilots called Don Burdick (Jim McMullan) and Gil Foley (Dirk Benedict).\n\nEven though producers and network execs spent about $140,000 to film each episode, the show tanked and was pulled off the air after 13 episodes in April of 1974.\n\nCarter Country\n\nABC's 1977 sitcom, 'Carter Country,' lasted for an impressive two years and 44 episodes. However, it's still not a success story since audiences still had their issues with the culturally sensitive show.\n\nStarring Victor French, Kene Holliday, Vernee Watson, Richard Paul, Harvey Vernon, and Barbara Cason, 'Carter Country' followed the lives of different police officers who came from different backgrounds and cultures and how they overcame their differences. Although it sounded great on paper, the show eventually got canceled due to low ratings.\n\nDavid Cassidy: Man Undercover\n\n'The Partridge Family' star, David Cassidy, became so famous back in the '70s that he even starred in his own series: 'David Cassidy: Man Undercover.' In the show, Cassidy played a police officer who was sent to investigate a high school drug ring.\n\nOther famous actors in the show included Simon Oakland and Ed Harris. Aired in 1978, the series was canceled after only 10 episodes, with many viewers and critics considering the show a cheap attempt to jumpstart Cassidy's career.\n\nSword of Justice\n\n'Sword of Justice' followed the story of a man that led the life of a playboy by day and turned into a ruthless mercenary by night. But, contrary to Batman or other superheroes of the like, Jack Cole let his enemies know he was coming for them by sending them three cards.\n\nAudiences didn't love the show and found the fact that this mercenary warned his victims just a little over-the-top. Producers only released nine episodes, and NBC decided to cancel it altogether.\n\nThe American Girls\n\nReleased by CBS in 1978, 'The American Girls' lasted for about six days, and it was basically another series in a long list of 'Charlie's Angels' copy TV shows. Many producers tried to come up with a hit TV show like the 70's 'Charlie's Angels,' but none made the cut.\n\nLead actresses Priscilla Barnes and Debra Clinger played two beautiful investigative reporters who worked on a news show called 'The American Report.' While it was an entertaining adventure drama, these girls never had a chance since their show was aired on the 9-10 pm time slot, the same as ABC's 'The Love Boat.'\n\nThe Manhunter\n\nThis detective drama aired on CBS in 1974 and managed to survive a whole seven months and 22 episodes. 'The Manhunter' starred the famous Ken Howard as the show's protagonist — an ex-marine named Dave Barrett, whose best friend dies during a bank robbery.\n\nThe series was set in the 1930s Depression Era, and viewers saw the heroic Dave Barrett give up his quiet farm life to become a private detective who wants to arrest as many criminals as possible. He travels across the country and only goes back home to visit family. Despite a great cast, a good plot, and star guests such as Sam Elliot, Mark Hamill, Claudia Jennings, and more, the show was canceled after just one season.\n\nThe Ropers\n\nThis show was created as a spin-off of a previous, highly popular show. ABC created 'The Ropers' as a spin-off to 'Three's Company,' but the new show just didn't cut it; the characters weren't interesting enough, and the production was lacking.\n\nThe plot was about two landlords, played by Norman Fell and Audra Lindley, who sold their building (which appeared in 'Three's Company'), and bought a new one. Unfortunately, after two short seasons, the show got pulled off the air.\n\nThree for the Road\n\nAired on CBS in 1975, 'Three for the Road' had a star-studded cast and an interesting plot, but it still didn't manage to save the show from being a flop.\n\nIncluding '70s teen celebrities Leif Garret and Vince Van Patten, the show was about a man who decides to sell his home and go on a road trip across the U.S. with his two teenage sons after his wife passes away. Unfortunately, audiences didn't respond too great, and the show was pulled off the air after only 12 episodes.\n\nDog and Cat\n\nThe name of this 1970's TV show wasn't the only bad thing about it. 'Dog and Cat' premiered in 1977 and lasted only six episodes after receiving bad ratings and negative reviews. It was another police series about a rookie detective, played by the gorgeous Kim Basinger, who was partnered with a veteran officer called Jack Ramsey.\n\n'Dog and Cat' was the first-ever TV role Kim Basinger had, as she'd been working as a model before that. Basinger played Officer J.Z. Kane, but even her stunning looks and cool little VW Bug couldn't keep viewers interested.\n\nAdam's Rib\n\nBased on a similar film from 1949, 'Adam's Rib' was a TV show that aired on ABC in 1973. The story followed a husband's affair with his lawyer's wife, whom he met in court. It featured talented performances from Ken Howard and Blythe Danner, but it still wasn't successful.\n\nAfter a short three months and 13 episodes, the show was canceled. Luckily, both Howard and Danner went on to have quite illustrious careers in film.\n\nMan From Atlantis\n\nProduced by NBC, 'Man From Atlantis' was a 1977 TV show that followed the story of Mark Harris, the last survivor of the sunken city of Atlantis. The famous Patrick Duffy plays Harris, who is recruited by a government agency for oceanic research once he is discovered.\n\nNBC was trying to capitalize on the very successful four films of the same name that had aired earlier that year. But the attempt was futile; the show was canceled less than a year after its release, with only 13 episodes aired.\n\nWe've Got Each Other\n\nAired in October 1977, on CBS, 'We've Got Each Other' was an American sitcom starring Oliver Clark and Beverly Archer. Clark plays Stuart Hibbard, a writer for a mail-order catalog, who is married to Judy, played by Archer, an office manager for a clumsy photographer.\n\nThe show tried to be unique by inverting the typical roles of the domestic wife and the working husband since Judy is the breadwinner of the family. But even that wasn't enough to keep it from being pulled off the air after just 13 episodes.\n\nLucas Tanner\n\nThe 1974 NBC drama series 'Lucas Tanner' had a pretty simple plot: a successful sportswriter and baseball player who loses his family in an accident and decides to start a new life. David Hartman, who plays Lucas Tanner, moves to St. Louis and starts teaching in the local high school.\n\nTanner has a fresh and friendly approach to teaching, which makes him beloved by students, but not so liked among teachers who have an old-fashioned way of teaching. Unfortunately, Hartman and his fellow talented co-stars, Robbie Rist and Rosemary Murphy, weren't enough to keep 'Lucas Tanner' on the air for more than 22 episodes. NBC canceled the series in under a year.\n\nNashville 99\n\n'Nashville 99' was an American crime drama series that was meant to be a replacement for the time slot occupied by the famous 'The Sonny and Cher Show' in 1977. The show featured famous singer/songwriter 'Smokey and the Bandit' star Jerry Reed. But even he wasn't able to turn the show into gold.\n\nReed played a detective, and co-star Claude Akins played a lieutenant. Reed, whose badge number was '99', was the comedic element in the duo, while Akins was the more serious, professional one. Unfortunately, only four episodes were filmed, and the show was canceled after three weeks.\n\nAll That Glitters\n\nReleased in April 1977, 'All That Glitters' was a soap opera spoof show that was on TV five times a week, during the late-night slot. In an effort to be different, the show's plot took place in a world where women were the head of the house and men worked as secretaries. Obviously, this was not a popular story back in the '70s.\n\nLasting barely three months, it's a miracle the show even lasted this long, especially after it was called \"embarrassingly amateurish\" by TIME magazine. Seems like a talented cast, including Gary Sandy, Eileen Brennan, Lois Nettleton, and Greg Evigan, wasn't enough to make this show a hit.\n\nFlatbush\n\n'Flatbush' aired on CBS in 1979, and it was about a group of high schoolers who lived in New York's Flatbush neighborhood. They called themselves \"The Fungos\" and were always finding new adventures to take part in. The storyline seemed promising, and the cast included a young group of actors who could've made it work, but it just didn't.\n\nApparently, there were a lot of offensive ethnic stereotypes portrayed in the series, and obviously, audiences didn't like it one bit. In fact, even Flatbush's neighborhood president criticized the show, making ratings drop even more. The network produced six episodes, but it was so badly received that it could only air three of them.\n\nA Year at the Top\n\nLasting only 5 episodes, 'A Year at the Top' was a 1977 TV show that aired on CBS. It featured a talented cast, including Greg Evigan, Paul Shaffer, Priscilla Lopez, Nedra Volz, Julie Cobb, and Mickey Rooney (who only appeared in the pilot episode).\n\nAlthough it had an interesting premise of two struggling musicians that make a pact with the devil's son, played by Gabriel Dell, in order to achieve success, viewers just didn't find it good enough.\n\nThe Texas Wheelers\n\nA very young Mark Hamill and Gary Busey were among the A-list cast in the 1974 TV show, 'The Texas Wheelers.' ABC thought it had itself a hit with this comedy sitcom, but bad production and low ratings got it canceled after just 11 episodes.\n\nJack Elam, a known '70s celebrity, played Zack Wheeler, a man who had to care for his four kids alone after his wife passed away. Even though eleven episodes were filmed for the show's first season, the network only aired four.\n\nSanford Arms\n\n'Sanford Arms' was a spin-off show released by NBC in an attempt to capitalize on its previous series, 'Sanford and Son.' The new series, released in 1977, followed the story of a widower and his two teenage children while they run a rooming house called the 'Sanford Arms.'\n\nOf course, this all happened after 'Sanford and Son' characters Fred and Lamont moved to Arizona at the end of the show. Unfortunately, 'Sanford Arms' didn't fare too well with audiences, and it got canceled after just 8 episodes, out of which only 4 were aired.\n\nGrady\n\nEven though this spin-off show was starred by famous American actor Whitman Mayo, it couldn't live up to its original show's wild success. 'Grady' was a spin-off of the famous TV show 'Sanford and Son', focusing solely on one of the show's characters, neighbor Grady Wilson.\n\nNBC aired the show in 1975, but low ratings and poor character development caused it to get canceled after just 10 episodes. Undoubtedly, casting wasn't one of the show's problems, as it included not only Whitman Mayo in the lead role but also Joe Morton and Carol Cole. Sadly, 'Grady' didn't make it in the TV world.\n\nThe Oregon Trail\n\nIn September of 1977, NBC released an American western TV series called 'The Oregon Trail,' which they thought would be critically acclaimed and wildly successful. However, the opposite was the case - the show was canceled after a month, with only 7 episodes out of the produced 13 being aired.\n\nThe show starred Rod Taylor, a widower who leaves his farm in Illinois in 1842 to reach the Pacific Northwest by taking the Oregon Trail. A cast that included Tony Becker, Darleen Carr, and Andrew Stevens, wasn't enough to save 'The Oregon Trail' from getting the axe.\n\nDoc Elliot\n\nLong before 'E.R.' and 'Grey's Anatomy,' there was 'Doc Elliot.' Released in 1973, this medical drama centered around Dr. Benjamin Elliot, played by James Franciscus, and his helper Mags Brimble, portrayed by Neva Patterson. Elliot was a famous New York doctor who decided to leave the city and move to the backwoods of Southern Colorado, where he made house calls by plane or off-road vehicles.\n\nThe extravagant cars and airplanes were supposed to draw more viewers to the show, but apparently, it wasn't enough to keep people interested. So, in August of 1974, the show was canceled altogether.\n\nHello, Larry\n\nMcLean Stevenson was a big celebrity back in the 1970s, mainly after starring on the hit TV show, 'M.A.S.H.' But his charisma and acting weren't enough to make the 1979 NBC show 'Hello, Larry' a hit story. The script and production weren't good enough, but the show still somehow managed to last for two seasons.\n\nThe main character, Larry Adler, is a radio talk show host who moves to Portland with two teenage daughters. It could've been great, but it was just boring and not funny enough for viewers.\n\nFlying High\n\nThe 1978 show, 'Flying High' was a 'Charlie's Angels' copycat. The story centered around the private lives of three gorgeous women who worked as stewardesses for Sunwest Airlines. With a beautiful cast that included Pat Clouse, Kathryn Witt, and Connie Sellecca, the show had all the ingredients to make it an entertaining story.\n\nHowever, viewers just weren't wowed by these ladies' adventures, and after much criticism of the show having stereotypical writing and production, it was canceled. It only ran for a few months.\n\nThe New Land\n\nReleased on ABC in 1974, 'The New Land' was a unique adventure series that was based on the 1971 Swedish film, 'The Emigrants.' The American adaptation cast Bonnie Bedelia and Scott Thomas as the leading roles, and even though the story was a hit as a film three years prior, the series didn't see the same success.\n\nThe acting was fine, including a good performance by the talented Donald Moffat as reverend Lundstrom, the wilderness landscapes were beautiful, and everything was in place to be a success. But after airing only six of the produced 13 episodes, the show got pulled off the air a month after its release.\n\nSupertrain\n\n'Supertrain' was released by NBC in 1979, and it included a talented cast that included Nita Talbot, Robert Alda, Aarika Wells, Michael Delano, Edward Andrews, and more. The story followed a modern, nuclear-powered bullet train that was so advanced it could travel from NYC to California in just 36 hours, which was incredible back in the '70s.\n\n'Supertrain' was one of the most costly American TV shows ever produced, but even that wasn't enough to keep the network from canceling it after just nine episodes.\n\nThe Fitzpatricks\n\n'The Fitzpatricks' was an American drama series that aired on CBS in 1977. The coming-of-age story followed a traditional, Irish-catholic family of six that lived in Michigan. But, despite its moral lessons and cheery actors, viewers weren't impressed.\n\nAfter just thirteen episodes, the show was pulled off the air in January 1978, proving a failure against its same time-slot competitors from other networks, 'Happy Days' and 'Laverne & Shirley.'\n\nHee Haw Honeys\n\nThe 1978 TV show 'Hee Haw Honeys' was released as a spin-off to the original and far more successful, 'Hee Haw.' The original show had featured star-studded guests like Loretta Lynn and Conway Twitty, but the show's permanent cast, which also included stars like Misty Rowe and Kathie Lee Gifford, wasn't enough to take the spin-off to hit status.\n\n'Hee Haw Honeys' was listed by TV Guide as one of the worst shows ever made and received plenty of bad reviews. However, a lot of viewers seemed to love it. That was clearly not enough, though, and the show was pulled off the air after just one season.\n\nFirehouse\n\n'Firehouse' was very unsuccessful. It was loosely based on NBC's very popular show, 'Emergency!'. Released in 1974, 'Firehouse' was an adventure drama TV show about a father-like firefighter veteran who takes younger, newly-recruited firefighters under his wing. The cast included James Drury, Brad David, Michael Delano, Richard Jaeckel, and more.\n\nEven though the spin-off was also inspired by the best-selling book, 'Report from Engine Co. 28', written by an actual veteran firefighter, it was extremely unsuccessful as a TV show. ABC canceled the show after 13 disastrous episodes.\n\nAnother Day\n\nProducers thought that a TV show about a middle-class family trying to make ends meet would hit it big with audiences, but they were wrong. In 1978, CBS released 'Another Day,' a series that told the story of Don Gardner, a young, hard-working businessman, his lovely wife Ginny (Joan Hackett), and their two kids.\n\nUnfortunately, the show got canceled after four episodes, even though it had a cast of known names, such as Hope Summers, Al Eisenmann, and Lisa Lindgren. The story just wasn't enticing enough, and the network had no option but to pull the plug.\n\nLanigan's Rabbi\n\nThe American crime drama series 'Lanigan's Rabbi' was more of a film series than a TV show, and it aired as part of NBC's Sunday Mystery Movies. It had a hilarious and talented cast that included Art Carney, Bruce Solomon, Janet Margolin, and Janis Paige, and it centered around a rabbi who helped the police solve several crimes.\n\nUnfortunately, only four episodes were ever aired since the plot, and the production just wasn't good enough to keep up with viewers. The original story was inspired by Harry Kemelman's mystery novels, which were a huge hit, contrarily to the show.\n\nThe Andros Targets\n\nThe CBS show 'The Andros Targets' premiered in January 1977, and it only lasted until July. Released as a midseason replacement for another show, the series told the story of Mike Andros (James Sutorius), a NY Times reporter seeking to expose corruption in New York. His assistant, Sandi Farrell (Pamela Reed), is his right hand and friend, but even the on-screen sidekick relationship wasn't enough to keep the show on the air.\n\nWith a cast that included Jordan Charney, Alan Mixon, Roy Poole, and Ted Beniades, many viewers liked the storyline, but the production just wasn't good enough. After a few episodes, production wasn't the only issue since many people started to criticize the show for its unrealistic portrayal of investigative reporting.\n\nMrs. Columbo\n\nKate Mulgrew played Kate Columbo in the 1979 TV series, 'Mrs. Clumbo'. Created as a spin-off of the earlier, far more popular show 'Columbo,' 'Mrs. Columbo' had a big budget and quite a decent production, but the characters just weren't good enough.\n\nNBC canceled the show after just 13 episodes, realizing the story wasn't interesting enough and receiving very low ratings coupled with intense criticism.\n\nGet Christie Love!\n\nThe beautiful Teresa Graves played detective Christie Love in ABC's 1974 show, 'Get Christie Love!'. The show might have not been a hit, but it is still a memorable show. Detective Love was a tough police officer who worked for the LAPD's Special Investigations Division.\n\nUnfortunately, the show was canceled after just one season, but Graves did a fine job nonetheless. Other cast members included Jack Kelly, Michael Pataki, Charles Cioffi, and more. Still, it wasn't enough to keep this crime-drama show from being canceled just a few short months after its release.\n\nThe Brady Bunch Hour\n\nThis one-of-a-kind, 1976 TV show was not only short-lived, but it also made TV Guide's list as one of the five worst TV shows ever created...many times. 'The Brady Bunch Hour' was basically a show about the Brady family starring in their own TV variety show, which ended up being a complete flop.\n\nApart from a weak storyline, the show featured a lot of song-and-dance routines that made it feel like more of a cheap musical and less of a show. With only 9 episodes being filmed, 'The Brady Bunch Hour' barely lasted a few months and received awful reviews before ABC pulled it off the air altogether.\n\nBearcats!\n\nCBS released 'Bearcats!' in 1971, in an attempt to get into the western TV show craze. The problem was that, by 1970, the interest in westerns had substantially gone down, and so the show was only on the air for thirteen episodes.\n\nIts lead actors, Dennis Cole and Rod Taylor, played two adventurers riding around in a Stutz Bearcat in the American Southwest in 1914. CBS spent a lot of money on marketing the show, but it was all for nothing since, clearly, viewers weren't interested in a story set in 1914 anymore.\n\nGibbsville\n\nReleased in 1976, the action-drama series 'Gibbsville' was about a cub reporter who worked for the Gibbsville Courier in Pennsylvania. It was based on a film that was written and directed by Frank D. Gilroy, called the 'The Turning Point of Jim Malloy.'\n\nThe show was set in the 1940s, and NBC had high hopes of it being a hit. Unfortunately, only six out of the 13 produced episodes were ever aired. A cast that included Gig Young and John Savage in the lead roles wasn't enough to save this boring show.\n\nKaren\n\nPremiering on ABC in January 1975, 'Karen' was a comedy series that followed the life of Karen Angelo, played by Karen Valentine. Angelo was a single, hard-working woman with a job at a Washington D.C.-based organization called 'Open America.' The organization sought to expose corrupt politicians and lobby for civil rights, and Angelo was at the forefront.\n\nUnfortunately, an interesting premise and good acting weren't enough to keep the audiences' interest, so just six months after its release, ABC pulled the show off the air. The star-studded cast included Denver Pyle, Dene Dietrich, Oliver Clark, Aldine King, and more.\n\nCo-Ed Fever\n\nThis CBS sitcom was such a disappointment that, out of the six episodes produced, only one ever aired. With a cast that included Alexa Kenin, Cathryn O’Neill, Heather Thomas, Tracy Phillips, and Jillian Kesner, 'Co-Ed Fever' followed the story of a group of young girls that lived in a dorm at Baxter College.\n\nWhat's worse is that 'Co-Ed Fever' was meant to be one part of a three-part \"frat house\" comedy series, but the plot and production were so disastrous that all three of them were a flop.\n\nThe San Pedro Beach Bums\n\nJust by its name, you can probably guess what 'The San Pedro Beach Bums' was about. That's right; it was about five young friends who shared a houseboat in Southern California. Released by ABC in 1977, the show had a decent cast, with names like Stuart Pankin, John Mark Robinson, and Christopher Murney.\n\nHowever, this story about a group of young, carefree men living it up in San Pedro, California, didn't have enough substance to keep audiences engaged. It was canceled in under three months, with just 10 episodes making it to air.\n\nYoung Dan'l Boone\n\n'Young Dan'l Boone' was a TV show that aired on CBS in 1977, and it followed the life of famous American frontiersman Daniel Boone before he got married. In his adventures as a young man, Daniel Boone is played by Rick Moses, but even a handsome actor like him couldn't save the show from abrupt cancellation.\n\nAfter only 8 episodes, of which only 4 were aired, CBS pulled the show off the air after low ratings and generally bad reviews.\n\nHolmes and Yoyo\n\nThe police show 'Holmes and Yoyo' barely lasted three months. Released by ABC in September 1976, it was pulled off the air in December of the same year. The story was about Detective Alexander Holmes and his robot partner, who was disguised as a detective called Gregory \"Yoyo\" Yonovich.\n\nThe catch was that only very few people actually knew that he was a robot. Unfortunately, TV Guide claimed it was one of the worst shows ever made, and that was it for 'Holmes and Yoyo.' Low ratings and viewership got the show canceled in no time.\n\nOn Our Own\n\nAmerican sitcom 'On Our Own' followed the lives of two roommates and co-workers who lived in New York and worked at a prestigious advertising agency. The show was shot at CBS studios in New York City, which was a rare occurrence back in the '70s since most shows were shot in Hollywood.\n\nThere was a good cast, including Bess Armstrong, Lynnie Greene, Gretchen Wyler, and Dixie Carter. Sadly, though, neither the cast nor the entertaining plot following the lives of single working women in New York were enough to guarantee this show a second season. This comedy series was canceled almost a year after its release.\n\nGemini Man\n\nBased on H.G. Wells' 'The Invisible Man,' NBC's 1976 TV show, 'Gemini Man,' had high hopes of success. The story revolves around Sam Casey (Ben Murphy), a secret agent who can become invisible at any time thanks to a special watch he wears. If Casey remained invisible for more than fifteen minutes within a 24-hour period, he would die.\n\nUnfortunately, though, out of 11 produced episodes, only 5 made it to air after the show was abruptly canceled. Viewers weren't impressed by the plot or Casey's lead role as a semi-superhero.\n\nLucan\n\nBased on a successful TV movie, 'Lucan' was an adventure series released in 1977 by ABC. A young and handsome Kevin Brophy played Lucan, a young man who had been raised by wolves during the first ten years of his life. After being rescued by a doctor, played by John Randolph, and taught how to live in modern society, Lucan is wrongly accused of a crime and runs away again.\n\nThe whole series, which lasted all of 11 episodes, was a cat-and-mouse game between Lucan and the cop that's chasing him, Prentiss. The fact that the boy was raised in the wild certainly gives him some edge to surviving on his own, but even with all that excitement and adventure, the show got dropped after a year.\n\nThe P.T.L Club\n\nBest known as 'The Jim and Tammy show' the 1974 TV show 'The P.T.L. Club' was a Christian program hosted by a religious couple; its name stood for \"Praise the Lord.\" Luckily, viewers quickly discovered this show had nothing to do with God and everything to do with scams and money.\n\nThe show was basically designed as a scam to steal people's money, and even though it lasted 14 seasons, mainly because it only aired on the Christian PTL satellite network, everything fell apart in the late 1980s. One of the show's hosts, Jim Bakker, was accused of abuse and convicted of fraud and conspiracy.\n\nHighcliffe Manor\n\nInspired by the 1966 Gothic soap opera 'Dark Shadows,' NBC's 'Highcliffe Manor' was released in 1979, and it definitely had promise. The show was a horror-themed sitcom that featured Shelley Fabares, Ernie Hudson, Audrey Landers, Jenny O'Hara, and Stephen McHattie. Each episode lasted 30 minutes.\n\nFabares played Helen Blacke, a widow who recently inherited a lavish mansion in Massachusetts that's filled with paranormal characters that want to get her out of the house. Even worse, the strange characters were also planning to take over the world and create chaos by cloning world leaders. As interesting and entertaining as this all sounds, the show was canceled after only six episodes due to low ratings. Guess some things are just better on paper.\n\nBig Hawaii\n\nAnother NBC show from the '70s that barely lasted two months was 'Big Hawaii.' Released in 1977, the show came out shortly after a pilot film, 'Danger in Paradise,' which aired in May of that same year.\n\nStarring Cliff Potts, John Dehner, and Lucia Stralser, 'Big Hawaii' followed the story of the wealthy Fears family, who owns the lavish Paradise Ranch in Hawaii. Drama ensued, but unfortunately, it wasn't exciting enough to keep the show from being canceled after just 12 episodes, out of which only 9 aired.\n\nThe Ernest Angley Hour\n\nErnest Angley is an American Christian pastor and televangelist who had a one-hour weekly show back in the '70s, called 'The Ernest Angley Hour.' Although it had a decent beginning, things started to take a wrong turn when Angley was accused of leading a cult and being abusive to its members.\n\nAngley claimed that he could heal any ailment by simply placing his hand on a person's forehead. But not many people believed it anymore once he was accused of inappropriate behavior and harassment. Finally, in 1996, Angley confessed to an assistant that he had had physical relations with a man who worked for his church in Ohio. Ironic, since Angley was openly vocal about homosexuality being the greatest sin known to man.\n\nWho's Watching the Kids?\n\nWanting to create a series based on the personal and professional lives of two Vegas showgirls, famous producer Gary Marshall just didn't make the cut with his 1978 show, 'Who's Watching the Kids?'. As you can probably guess by the title, the series was about two Vegas performers who tried their best to handle work and family responsibilities.\n\nLinda Goodfriend and Caren Kaye lived together in a small Las Vegas apartment and worked in the same club. Their co-stars, Jim Belushi and Scott Baio, added a comedy factor to the show. However, none of this was enough to keep the show running; viewers were not very impressed by the story, and NBC pulled it off the air after only eleven episodes.\n\nIn the Beginning\n\nNorman Lear became famous after producing hit TV shows like 'All in the Family' and 'The Jefferson's Fame.' Unfortunately, he didn't have the same success as a producer for 'In the Beginning.' It was a controversial show about a very conservative priest and a liberal nun, and out of 9 produced episodes, only five were ever aired.\n\nThe priest, played by McLean Stevenson, had a very odd relationship with Sister Agnes, portrayed by Priscilla Lopez. Despite their conversations being quite entertaining, the comedy wasn't enough to keep viewers' attention. Barely a month after it was released, CBS pulled it off the air.\n\nStruck by Lightning\n\nCBS released 'Struck by Lightning' in September 1979 and canceled it one month later. The series' plot was inspired by the Frankenstein story, and it followed Jeffrey Kramer, who played a science teacher who inherits an old, creepy-looking Victorian Inn. Right before selling it, Kramer discovers that Frank, the Inn's handyman, is actually Frankenstein's monster.\n\nOut of the eleven episodes produced, only 3 were aired since American audiences heavily disliked the show. In England, however, it was slightly more successful, with all eleven episodes being aired in 1980.\n\nThe Immortal\n\nAn ABC drama series from 1970, 'The Immortal' starred a handsome Christopher George as a hunky race car driver called Ben Richards. The reason why Richards looked 20 while being 42 was that he had a special type of blood that made him impervious to aging. Unfortunately, that changes after he donates blood to save his older and wealthy employer, who decides to use Richards as a \"fountain of youth\" once he realizes the young man's power.\n\nThe series lasted 15 episodes, and even though it evolved into a more thrilling cat-and-mouse game played by Richards and the wealthy man's bounty hunter, the show still wasn't good enough to keep it from being canceled. It was pulled off the air in January 1971.\n\nMobile One\n\nAn adventure show that aired on September 12, 1975, 'Mobile One' was a very short-lived ABC series. Lasting only until December of that same year, due to low ratings, 'Mobile One' starred Jackie Cooper, Julie Gregg, and Mark Wheeler. But even this highly talented cast wasn't enough to keep the show on the air.\n\nABC released the show as a competitor to NBC's 'Chico and the Man' and CBS's 'M.A.S.H', but clearly, there was never any competition. 'Mobile One' was axed after 13 episodes."
