        "text": "If you read my “How I beat the January blues” post, you’ll know this is not my favourite month of the year, however, I am determined to not let it bring me down and to keep some sort of spring in my step by following my trusted tips in said post. I’m proud to say I have been about 80% successful so far, with just the odd moment of “why is it so cold and dark and I’m sat here at my laptop with leggings under my tracksuit bottoms and a woollen beanie on indoors, whilst everybody on the internet is basking themselves on some kind of tropical island?”\n\nThe good news is, we have made it through the first week, which is arguably the hardest as you get into the groove of the new year. After a week at home post Christmas holidays visiting family, I am feeling a bit more settled back into our usual routine now. We had a lovely weekend and managed to fit a lot in as well as having quite a bit of cosy time at home (we watched Homeward Bound with our son, which was the ultimate childhood throwback for both of us and cleared out at least 5 random cupboards/drawers in the house - a fave Jan weekend activity). For out of the house activities, Saturday morning we visited the farmer’s market at Parliament Hill followed by a walk on the heath, then in the afternoon did another walk, this time in Battersea Park with a quick stop off at the HUGE sweet stall at Battersea Power Station (I was in marshmallow heaven with the metre long flumps). Then Sunday we stayed local in the morning and went to the swings for the baby, got coffee and pastries and just walked around enjoying the beautiful, blue skies and crisp, cold air. In the afternoon we went for a late lunch at Fifty Cheyne (quite fancy, but the perfect January treat) and had such a nice time. The roast was a 10/10, just wish we’d ordered a side of cauliflower cheese! Sage just loves going out to a restaurant and so it’s surprisingly easy for us as parents to have a pretty relaxed dining out experience with him. He’s so distracted by all the people and waiters and just finds the whole thing really exciting - yesterday he sat in a highchair during mains and then on my lap for pudding and was good as gold. In the evening once we put the baby to bed, we went to the cinema, which was VERY exciting. I think we might have been to the cinema twice since having him as we don’t often have evening childcare, but last night we did, so after putting him to bed we went to see The Boy and the Heron. We both absolutely loved it and would highly recommend. It’s a Japanese film, dubbed with some amazing voices like Gemma Chan and Robert Pattinson, that tells the story of a young boy dealing with the loss of his mother. It explores the way we cope with pain and grief and did it in such a beautiful, surreal, charming and touching way. Also, the score was wonderful.\n\nThe monthly round up\n\nTV show | I binge watched Fool Me Once last week. A woman is trying to overcome the death of her husband, but after installing a nanny-cam in her house, sees something that tips her over the edge. It’s totally not my usual kind of show, but it’s action packed, will have you on the edge of your seat and has a very good twist.\n\nFilm | Other than The Boy and the Heron, which I urge you to take a trip to the cinema to see, I finally watched Saltburn and thought it was utterly fabulous. It follows a young working-class Oxford student who befriends the richest boy at school and ends up having an extended stay at his family’s country estate/manor/castle. It’s an addictive watch as it turns very quickly from a fun, frivolous getaway to a complete nightmare series of events. I had heard reviews that the sex scenes were gratuitous and the plot weak, but honestly, I disagreed and I was completed engaged throughout, thought the performances were incredible (particularly Rosamund Pike, although really the whole cast were amazing - Carey Mulligan nails her character with about 5 minutes on screen in total) and the killer, nostalgic 00’s soundtrack didn’t leave my mind for days.\n\nBook | I recently finished Elizabeth Is Missing by Emma Healey, which I rated 4 stars on GoodReads (follow me there to see everything I have read lately), but if I was allowed half stars I would have rated it 4.5. I didn’t expect a lot from this book as I typically find thrillers just not very literarily satisfying, but it was a beautiful and unique story. The protagonist and narrator is a woman with dementia and I imagine this was a tricky one to write and get right/authentic, but it felt so honest and really surprised me how light and funny it felt given the very sad topic. It had moments that pulled my heart into two, don’t get me wrong, but the story was told so beautifully and I think the lightness made it really enjoyable. It’s about an elderly woman who believes her best friend is missing and on her quest to find her, gets taken decades back into her past. I would really recommend this one and the twist made my jaw drop.\n\nFashion | We are fully in cosy season, it actually snowed in London this morning! I have become obsessed with cashmere socks, these from Johnstons of Elgin are my favourite for keeping my feet warm, whilst also making me feel like Cameron Diaz in The Holiday. For clothes, it’s fully jeans (Agolde 90’s Pinch Waist are my everyday go-to) and knitwear season for me. This bright blue knit from Arket has been on my Wishlist for about a month and has just come back into stock, so is going straight in my basket. As a predominantly neutral girl, I like to have the odd thing in my wardrobe to brighten things up a bit, especially in this weather.\n\nBeauty | Beauty products are so important this time of year, as I find them to be completely transformative (for my mood and physical being). Let’s do a quick fire…Espa Life bath oil - you’ll come out of the bath feeling like you’ve just exited a spa, all hydrated, healthy looking and smelling incredible. Skin Ceuticals C E Feluric - this is best vitamin C product I have ever used and is essential for keeping my skin glowing in January. Olaplex No. 6 - the best product for dry, frizzy hair. Lip Liner - who would have guessed I would get back into lip liner?? Not me! Overall, I like a very natural look with my makeup and have always found lip liner makes me feel too “done”, but I have recently been wearing one a makeup artist gave me (Melkior in Brown - can’t find a link anywhere!) with this Armani lipstick in 109 over the top and then blotting LOTS and it lasts ALL day and I have been loving the look of it.\n\nFood | Other than going out for a very fancy roast at Fifty Cheyne, I have been cooking at home a lot and my favourite thing to make and eat this time of year is bowl food - something you can curl up under a blanket and eat whilst watching your favourite TV show (don’t judge me for not sitting at the table). Risotto, spaghetti bolognese, a white bean stew - anything hearty, filling and warming is a big thumbs up from me at this time of year.\n\nArt | We recently went to the Marina Abramovic exhibition at the RA and it was so good. She is a performance artist who is known for pushing her body and mind to the limit in her work and this exhibition displayed key moments in her career through video, sculpture, installation and performance. It was so interesting to read all about her work whilst taking it in and learning about such an acclaimed artist.\n\nI hope you enjoyed my first round-up style newsletter.
