        "text": "The title of Gilbert Sorrentino’s last novel comes from Henry James’s story “The Middle Years”: “It was the abyss of human illusion that was the real, the tideless deep.” Sorrentino, who died in 2006 at the age of 77, was a cleareyed observer of human illusion and the frailties and follies of the species. He was also a very funny writer. When asked in an interview about the apparent contradiction in his work between the hilarity of his style and the bleakness of his subject matter, he said, by way of explanation, “A writer ­seizes on a particular aspect of the culture, and I believe that life is basically ridiculous,” then went on to gloss this ridiculous quality as being potentially tragic or comic, light or dark, laughter- or sob-­provoking, or all of the foregoing, depending on circumstance.\n\nThese elements were present throughout his work, and all inform “The Abyss of Human Illusion,” his final take on life’s absurdity. The book, though short, is a powerful distillation of themes from Sorrentino’s earlier work; thematically, it’s a logical progression from “A Strange Commonplace” (2006) and “Lunar Follies” (2005), his two previous books, which it resembles in brevity, humor and unorthodox structure. This last was common in Sorrentino’s books: “Form not only determines content,” he once said, “but form invents content.” Accordingly, “The Abyss of Human Illusion,” with its 50 set pieces labeled by Roman numerals — the first a mere 130 words long, the last approximately 10 times that — is not so much a novel as a random collection of mini-narratives, some of them variations on previous Sorrentino themes, one a homage to Rimbaud, another a nod to Saul Bellow. They are very entertaining. A lesser writer, or one with less humor, would have allowed himself to wallow in contempt and schadenfreude, and those feelings are certainly present, but Sorrentino, like the great Roman satirists in his ancestry — Juvenal, Suetonius, Martial — has an antic disposition that rises above all that and makes us laugh, not cry:\n\n“He loves a girl, who, as it turns out, does not love him, and so he wastes years of his life trapped in a wretched cliché. This is, as everyone knows, the oldest of news. At the time that he met the unattainable girl, another girl, whom he treated with a distant, friendly formality, tinged with a benign contempt, adored him and would have done anything for him, had he but asked. She was, as they say, ‘the girl for him.’ This is but more old news.”\n\nNo one familiar with Sorrentino’s work will be surprised at the underlying bitterness in these passages. He was bitter — perhaps “disillusioned” is a better word — because he was a brilliant and original writer who never got the success he deserved, while lesser lights triumphed: more old news. Even his best-known ­novel, “Mulligan Stew,” named one of the best books of 1979 by The New York Times Book Review, has sold to date fewer than 25,000 copies. Sorrentino was a realist about this, as about most things. “It’s always been this way and probably always will be,” he said. “The novel has somehow been posited for us as a kind of ‘mass item,’ and if it sells only 1,500 copies is seen as a failure. I don’t know if that’s even a reasonably intelligent way of thinking.”\n\nIt’s not, and Sorrentino suffered from the consequences of such thinking more than most. His work was hard to sell because it was demanding and original, and because it — and he — were so hard to pigeonhole. An auto­didact from Brooklyn, he never earned a college degree, yet made a living as a tenured professor at Stanford for 20 years (and moved back to Brooklyn promptly upon retirement). He was a Brooklynite through and through, as well as a writer of limitless ­cosmopolitanism.\n\nWith his experimental “metafiction” — spoofing literary conventions, leaving sentences dangling, writing an entire novel (“Gold Fools”) in the form of questions — he seemed to place himself squarely in the postmodernist camp; but his ear for American, especially New York, speech, and his attention to the spirit of place and compassion for the average loser, all defined him as a kindred spirit of such great American humorists as Mark Twain and Peter De Vries. His true masters, however, were the black-humored Irish, notably Joyce, Beckett and Flann O’Brien. O’Brien’s “At Swim-Two-Birds,” in which the characters, borrowed from Irish history and legend, rebel against the author, heavily influenced “Mulligan Stew,” in which the characters, borrowed from Dashiell Hammett and Scott Fitzgerald, among others, do likewise.\n\nThe characters in “The Abyss of Human Illusion” wouldn’t have the energy. Life has worn them out. They’re mostly interchangeable drunks, failed writers, self-hating cuckolds and preening salesmen who seem to have wandered out of one of Edward Hopper’s haunted cityscapes, with fading memories of another, bolder age, one chronicled by Richard Yates, perhaps, or John Updike:\n\n“When he thought of his youth he could scarcely believe that his memories had anything at all to do with the absurd life he was now living, an observation, he knew, that was far from original. Somehow, he had thought that his old age would miraculously produce finer, subtler notions of — what? — life? But he was no better, no cleverer, no more insightful than any shuffling old bastard in the street, absurdly bundled against the slightest breeze.”\n\nHe’s “absurdly” bundled because it isn’t the breeze that will get him, it’s life itself, and he can’t do anything about that. Nor could Sorrentino. Shortly before he finished this book, doctors diagnosed the cancer that would kill him. This depressed him, of course, but above all, recalls his son, Christopher (also a novelist), it bored him: “In a sense,” Christopher writes in an afterword that wasn’t included in the finished book, “my father believed he was immortal, and when he discovered that he was not, I believe that he grew bored. There was, in his final days, an ineffable sense that came off him not of despair, but of ennui.”\n\nFortunately, none of this ennui settles on the reader of “The Abyss of Human Illusion,” in which Sorrentino is frequently hilarious, in a vein more Swiftian than postmodern. His tally of life’s achievements comes down heavily on the debit side, but his stock-taking is leavened by pity and humor:\n\n“In his old age, childless and thrice-divorced, with all of his old friends either dead, sick or gone to sunbaked funereal places that were beyond his wish even to imagine them, Arthur began, one day, with no plan to speak of, to tote up, idly, to be sure, his grievances: the slights he’d endured, the insults, the petty humiliations unanswered and unavenged. He listed the unreciprocated kindnesses he’d shown others, the unanswered letters, the snubs, hurts, bad manners revealed, the advantage taken of him by those he had considered friends, or, at the least, not enemies. The project, if it may be given such a name, overwhelmed him, and he began to recover incidents, long forgotten, that he added, painstakingly and precisely, to his cruel catalog. He felt as if driven before a wholly unexpected avalanche.”"
