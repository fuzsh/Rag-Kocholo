        "text": "Lentils are constantly being recommended as a good staple for the Slow Carb Diet, and are also appropriate for a Mediterranean Diet. Besides being a tasty base for all kinds of proteins and vegetables, lentils are cheap, nutritious and easy to work with. This lentil stew is both delicious and easy.\n\nJump to: RECIPE | What is “Mulligan” Stew? | A Mexican Version | Illustrated Step by Step\n\nThis post may contain affiliate links.

You can read our disclosure information here–\n\nWhat does Mulligan mean?\n\nSo in informal golf games a mulligan is “…..a second chance to perform an action, usually after the first chance went wrong through bad luck or a blunder.\n\nThe food dish of mulligan stew shares a few concepts of the golf definition, in that the stew is often made with odds and ends of leftover food scraps (hence “second chance”).\n\nMulligan stew is a sort of catch-all dish of whatever is available, and is said to have originated in hobo camps during the early 1900’s. It usually contains meat, potatoes and vegetables in just about any combination.\n\nI’m calling this lentil chorizo dish a “mulligan stew” because it’s kind of a stew, kind of a hash and kind of a soup. It’s really a mash-up of lentils and chorizo and whatever else is in your fridge or pantry. In my case that was chorizo and red lentils.\n\nI will be making this frequently, and I’m sure it will be slightly different each time – hence the beauty of a “mulligan stew”.\n\nThe Mexican Version of Lentil Chorizo Stew\n\nIn the central region of Mexico, chorizo is used in everything from eggs to tacos. The addition of chipotle chile is also characteristic of this area.\n\nI was inspired to make this stew with a Mexican flavor profile by an article about Mexican cooking focused on lentils which I found it on the website Mexconnect. My recipe below is similar to this one but modified to be more in line with a slow carb diet.\n\nIngredients for Mexican Lentil Chorizo Stew\n\nHere are the ingredients used in the recipe below, with ideas for substitutions following the photo:\n\nIllustrated Step by Step:\n\nOther Ways to Add Flavor to Lentils\n\nLentils can often be bland. This smoky lentil soup recipe adds smoked ingredients for a rich, comforting flavor profile."
