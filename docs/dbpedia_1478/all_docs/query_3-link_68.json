        "text": "Welcome to The Storied Recipe!\n\nMy podcast guest, Shauna Lawless, author of The Children of Gods and Fighting Men shared this authentic slow cooked Irish Beef Stew with us! As you prepare your stew on the stovetop or in the crock pot, I invite you to listen to her episode, History, Mythology, and Irish Stew.\n\nIrish Stew is, by definition, slow cooked.\n\nOnly through low, slow heat can the golden, floury potatoes absorb all that rich broth deep into their core. And only in the presence of steam and gentle heat can the rich beef (or lamb) become succulent and tender.\n\nShauna’s family used a large cast iron Dutch Oven to make their Irish Stew. Whether you use a slow cooker or the stovetop to make this hearty stew, it’s just the comforting meal you’ll want waiting for you after a long, slow ramble in the rainy woods or along windy peaks.\n\nTable of Contents (Jump To Section)\n\nWhen does an Irish stew stop being an authentic Irish stew?\n\nA simple Irish Stew is a hallmark of Irish cooking. But what defines an Irish stew? As an American (not an Irish) woman, I’m not fully qualified to comment on this. However, I have gathered quite a few experts who debate this question and I’ll share what they say here:\n\nAccording to my podcast guest Shauna, who shared this recipe, and this article from My Irish Culture traditional Irish Stew is comprised of exactly 4 ingredients: Beef (or Lamb), potatoes, carrots, and onions.\n\nAccording to this article from Mercury News, lamb is the more authentic and traditional choice of protein. If you choose lamb, choose a cut on the bone, like lamb shoulder or lamb shanks.\n\nBefore potatoes were introduced in the 16th century, the Irish depended on grains. Barley would have been included in the earliest versions of stew, over 600 years ago. Here’s a recipe from We Love Donegal that incorporates this ancient grain into their recipe.\n\nIf you must add more ingredients, add similar ingredients – root vegetables like parsnips. rutabagas. I did find cabbage in a variety of Irish recipes.\n\nSome recipes will call for parsley or thyme; others insist that herbs are too fussy for a traditional Irish Stew.\n\nMany American adaptations will add Guinness beer to the broth for a Guinness Beef Stew – but Shauna says that Guinness Stew is a popular, but completely separate, menu item from Irish Stew.\n\nPotatoes are not meant to be layered on top of the stew in fancy patterns.\n\nIn recipes for Irish Stew written by Americans, you’ll find a lot of tomato sauce or paste. I never found a single recipe from an Irish cook that called for tomato paste.\n\nAll in all, if the dish becomes too time-consuming to make – or if the list of ingredients becomes too long or too expensive – it’s no longer an authentic Irish Stew!\n\nHow to Thicken Stew in the Crock Pot\n\nThis simple, authentic Irish stew was first cooked slowly in a large pot over a hearth full of fire.\n\nWhile we have more modern devices now, like slow cookers or stoves (hobs), the important thing is to cook the stew slowly. While high heat may cook the potatoes and meat quickly, only low, slow cooking can create the tender morsels of meat and flavorful broth that we seek.\n\nThe stove (hob) will create a thicker broth/gravy for the stew because more liquid will escape during cooking in the form of steam. Either way, you can always thicken the gravy in the end with a variety of methods.\n\nSlow Cooker vs. Stovetop (Hob)\n\nThis simple, authentic Irish stew was first cooked slowly in a large pot over a hearth full of fire.\n\nWhile we have more modern devices now, like slow cookers or stoves (hobs), the important thing is to cook the stew slowly. While high heat may cook the potatoes and meat quickly, only low, slow cooking can create the tender morsels of meat and flavorful broth that we seek.\n\nThe stove (hob) will create a thicker broth/gravy for the stew because more liquid will escape during cooking in the form of steam. Either way, you can always thicken the gravy in the end with a variety of methods.\n\nSlow Cooker (Crock Pot) Instructions\n\nLayer the onions, carrots, potatoes, beef, and herbs in that order.\n\nPour 4-6 cups of water, broth, or Guinness in the crock pot. The vegetables and proteins will release plenty of water (and steam), so it's not necessary to completely submerge the meat. The liquid will rise during cooking.\n\nWhen finished cooking, thicken the gravy by allowing steam to escape from the pot OR make a roux/gravy from the broth OR mash a few of the potatoes to thicken the broth.\n\nStove Top (Hob) Instructions\n\nFill a pot 2/3 of the way with liquid (or broth/Guinness).\n\nPlace potatoes and meat into the liquid and bring to a boil.\n\nAdd carrots and onions. Set lid halfway on and allow to simmer. Depending on the size and cut of your beef/lamb it could take from 60 minutes to 2.5 hours.\n\nThicken if necessary.\n\nIngredients\n\nBest Choice of Potatoes\n\nShauna specifically recommends a floury potato\n\nIf you live in the US, Yukon Gold is the perfect match\n\nBest Choice of Beef\n\nThe easiest option is to look for beef stew meat, which is already chopped into bite-sized pieces.\n\nStew meat is generally cut from a chuck roast.\n\nYou actually want a tough cut from the neck/shoulder/arm with lots of connective tissue and collagen.\n\nDuring a long slow cook time, the collagen will melt, releasing collagen and resulting in perfectly tender beef.\n\nFor more details, I suggest this article from Steak School.\n\nBest Herbs and Spices for Beef Stew​\n\nWhile the most traditional Irish stew is super simple, the following herbs go well with beef. Just use sparingly or you'll be making something altogether different from Irish Beef Stew 😉\n\nRosemary holds up so well to both beef and lamb and is often paired with potatoes and carrots. However, several sources said it's not common to include rosemary in Irish Stew. If you choose to use rosemary, simply place a sprig on top of the beef in the slow cooker or toss it into your Dutch Oven with the rest of the ingredients. Before serving, make sure you fish out the woody stem.\n\nBay leaf gives a deep, slightly fruity flavor to your stews and casseroles. Make sure the bay leaf is submerged in the cooking liquid.\n\nThyme is another popular herb to pair with beef. You can painstakingly add fresh thyme leaves to the pot. Or, place several sprigs on top of the beef and take the stems out later.\n\nQuite a few Irish stew recipes call for parsley. Because this herb is more delicate than the others, chop and add this one for the last 15 minutes of cooking only - or simply chop and use it as a garnish on top of the bowls of stew.\n\nHow to Make Guinness Beef Stew\n\nAs mentioned before, Shauna (and others) say that Guinness Stew is quite common in Ireland and frequently found on menus. However, a Guinness Stew is really not a traditional Irish Stew. They would be separate items on a menu.\n\nThat doesn’t mean it’s not delicious, however! If you’d like to make slow cooker Guinness Beef Stew, simply follow the directions in this recipe but replace 2.5 cups of liquid with a dark Guinness Stout.\n\nIf you’re buying your Guinness in the US, make sure you buy the “Foreign Extra Stout” as pictured below. This is actually made and bottled in Ireland. It has a greater concentration of alcohol and will taste more like what you’ll find in the pubs there.\n\nOrigins of Irish Beef Stew & The History of Potatoes in Ireland\n\nIrish Beef Stew was a logical way to combine cheap and plentiful ingredients. This quintessential Irish food is first recognized as Irish Stew in European cookbooks in the 1800s.\n\nPotatoes, a staple of Irish stew, were introduced in Ireland in the 16th century.\n\nAs the English took more land and taxed more crops, the Irish became poorer and more dependent on potatoes.\n\nDuring The Great Potato Famine, there was actually plentiful food production in Ireland. Only the potatoes were affected by blight. The rest of the crops, however, were exported to England, leaving the Irish to starve.\n\nLearn more about the history of potatoes and this Irish Stew in my interview with Shauna Lawless: Ep. 149: Mythology, History, and Irish Stew with Shauna Lawless, Author of The Children of Gods and Fighting Men\n\nEquipment You May Need\n\nDutch Oven or Cast Iron Pot\n\nSlow Cooker\n\nTry this Recipe Using Irish Guinness\n\nIndividual Steak and Kidney Puddings\n\nThe kidney is chopped finely, cooked twice to soften its flavor, blended with steak, beef gravy, beer, onions, and carrots, and encased in a highly flavorful crust. It is truly delicious.\n\nHow to Freeze Irish Beef Stew with Potatoes\n\nFreeze leftover stew in an airtight container or – to save space – in a flat Ziploc bag for up to a month.\n\nThe flavors of broth will only intensify and deepen as it defrosts.\n\nKeep in mind that freezing/defrosting the potatoes will break them down into smaller, somewhat watery chunks.\n\nAlso, if you thickened the mixture with flour, it may separate in the freezing/defrosting process. If possible, wait to thicken until after reheating.\n\nIt's also a good idea to thicken the stew after reheating to counteract the extra water released by the potatoes. Make a quick roux (1/4 cup fat (oil or butter) and 1/4 cup flour) and add about 2 cups of broth from the stew to make a thick, creamy gravy. Once this is whisked smooth, add it to the reheated stew.\n\nA defrosted and reheated stew may benefit more than a fresh stew from fresh herbs.\n\nRead more about how to store and reheat beef stew in this article from Betty Crocker.\n\nRecipe Contributor:\n\nShauna Lawless\n\nAuthor of The Children of Gods and Fighting Men\n\nWhen Shauna turned 30, a relative challenged her to start writing again. Despite having two young children and working full time, Shauna and her husband Jared carved out just one hour every other day for her to write.\n\nSix years later, walking out of the library, my eye fell on her debut book, The Children of Gods and Fighting Men.\n\nWhen I finished reading the novel (quickly and quite late at night!) I was hungry to learn more about the three great conflicts she effortlessly wove together through compelling characters and a strong, fast-paced story line set in 1000AD.\n\nThe first conflict is between the mythological Tuatha Dé Danann and Formorians.\n\nThe second between the real-life Nordic warriors and historical Kings.\n\nThe third, between the pagan and Christian belief systems that battled for both hearts and power in Ireland.\n\nShauna's Memories of Irish Stew\n\nShauna's father took her on epic walks in the Mourne Mountains of Northern Ireland. He's put this stew on the stove before they set off for their hikes and they would return home to hot, steamy bowls of thick and rich beef, potatoes, carrots, and onions.\n\nListen to Shauna's Episode on The Storied Recipe Podcast:\n\n149: Mythology, History, and Irish Stew with Shauna Lawless, Author of The Children of Gods and Fighting Men\n\nFollow The Storied Recipe in Your Favorite Player\n\nRecipe\n\nSlow Cooked Irish Beef Stew (Crock Pot or Stove Top)\n\nSlow cooked traditional hearty Irish stew.

Cut each half into 3 or 4 crescents.\n\nPeel and quarter each potato. (Do the same for rutabagas and turnips.)\n\nChop carrots into 1/2-inch slices. (Do the same for parsnips.)\n\nCrock Pot Instructions\n\nLayer in a crockpot in this order: Onions on the bottom, then carrots, potatoes, and other root vegetables. Finally, place beef, lamb, or sausage on top. It is not necessary to brown the beef in advance.\n\nIf adding herbs, do this now.\n\nAdd 4-8 cups of liquid - water, vegetable or beef stock, or Guinness (not traditional). The meat does not need to be submerged as the vegetables will release liquid as they cook.\n\nCook on low for at least 8 hours, or until potatoes do not resist a spoon and the meat falls apart when prodded with a fork.\n\nStove Top (Hob) Instructions\n\nFill an 8-quart pot about 2/3 full with liquid - water, broth, or Guinness (not traditional).\n\nAdd potatoes and meat and bring to a boil.\n\nAdd carrots and onions.\n\nTurn the heat down to low. Place the lid on a little askew so some steam can escape.\n\nCook slowly for at least an hour, but as long as you'd like. Potatoes should be cut with no resistance and the meat should be fork tender.\n\nOptional: To Thicken the Gravy\n\nOption 1: Create a roux by melting about 1/4 cup butter and adding 1/2 cup flour (or more, if very little liquid escaped during cooking) while whisking. Add about 2 cups broth from the cooking pot, whisking constantly until the gravy is hot and bubbly.\n\nAdd to the cooking liquid. Stir and allow to cook about 30 minutes longer.\n\nOption Two: Use a fork or immersion blender to mash a couple of the potatoes and stir into the rest of the cooking liquid.\n\nSeason\n\nFinally, salt and pepper to taste.\n\nIf desired, garnish with fresh herbs.\n\nNotes\n\nMake sure to listen to Shauna's episode, 149: Mythology, History, and Irish Stew, Author of The Children of Gods and Fighting Men while you make your stew!\n\nServe with soft rolls, soda bread, or a loaf with fresh, creamy butter.\n\nNutrition\n\nCalories: 534kcalCarbohydrates: 56gProtein: 37gFat: 18gSaturated Fat: 8gPolyunsaturated Fat: 2gMonounsaturated Fat: 9gTrans Fat: 1gCholesterol: 104mgSodium: 772mgPotassium: 1.789mgFiber: 7gSugar: 6gVitamin A: 9.492IUVitamin C: 51mgCalcium: 91mgIron: 6mg\n\nKeyword Crock Pot Meals, Curry, easy, Irish Beef Stew, Stew\n\nTune into The Storied Recipe PodcastEvery recipe comes with a story!\n\nBefore You Go...
