        "text": "“When we were making the song ‘Wrecking Heart’, Adam and I looked at each other, blown away by this song that was like nothing we’d ever written. It began with a supercharged sonic fragment he made that became the foundation of an unapologetic banger of a song that possessed and moved through us. We blasted it on the stereo, danced and air-guitared to it. Unconsciously, our lyrics seemed to telegraph our separation. “It sounds like a break up song,” he said, much to our disbelief at a time when we were very much together. But life challenges ended up pushing us in different directions. Though separated, we remained best friends, holding out hope that we would make our way back to each other. Adam landed a job scoring a TV series and I worked on our album, incorporating his notes. He said that he looked forward to playing cathartic meltdown live shows with me.\n\nBut that was not to be. Adam is no longer here. I believe he exists on other planes, in those who love him, and in our music, in his music, drawings, and writing. With this album, ‘jooj two’, I pick up the pieces of this Wrecking Heart, honoured to share our music.”\n\n– Sook-Yin Lee"
