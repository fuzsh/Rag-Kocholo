We seemed to be talking about the âotherâ festivals and could they survive the Covid years.\n\nThat conversation turned into the first group interview with the artistic directorsÂ of Calgary, Winnipeg, Canmore and Vancouver Folk Festivals.\n\nIt was fun and informative, so weâve decided to make it a yearly gathering.\n\nHereâs the guest lineup this year.
