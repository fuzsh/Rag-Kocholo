        "text": "Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Pat beef dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add half of the beef and cook until well browned on all sides, about 8 minutes, reducing heat if pot bottom becomes too dark. Transfer meat to plate. Repeat with one tablespoon oil and remaining beef.\n\nAdd remaining 1 tablespoon oil, carrots, onion, and allspice to pot. Cook over medium heat, scraping up any browned bits, until onion is just softened, about 2 minutes. Add tomatoes and cook until nearly dry, about 8 minutes. Add water, ham hock, barley, thyme, beef and any accumulated juices, and 1 teaspoon salt. Increase heat to high and bring to a simmer. Cover, transfer to oven, and cook for 1-3/4 hours.\n\nRemove pot from oven; stir in potatoes, turnip, and green beans. Cover and return to oven, and cook until potatoes and turnips and potatoes are nearly tender, about 45 minutes. Remove pot from oven, then remove ham hock from stew and let cool for 5 minutes. Using 2 forks, shred meat from ham hock, discarding skin and bones.\n\nStir cabbage and ham hock meat into stew. Return to oven, and cook until all vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes longer. Season with salt and pepper to taste."
