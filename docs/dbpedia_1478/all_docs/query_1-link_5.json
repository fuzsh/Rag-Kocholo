        "text": "Post by Admin on\n\nMulligan's Stew (1977)\n\nMulligan's Stew was a comedy-drama series that began its run in October of 1977 and lasted until December of 1977. Lawrence Pressman played Michael Mulligan, a high school teacher and football coach married to Jane (played by Elinor Donahue).\n\nThey had three children of their own, but suddenly found themselves taking in Michael's sister's four children when she and her husband were killed. The Mulligan children and their new adopted siblings have a tough time adjusting to each other, as each family has raised their children with different values and morals.\n\nThe differences between the children—and the interactions and troubles that came about because of these differences—were what producers hoped would provide the comedic and dramatic elements.\n\nOpening Only"
