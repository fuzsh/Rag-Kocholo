        "text": "(Papaw Ludwig)\n\nFred Ludwig Sr. (Papaw) did not cook many meals. In fact, other than Mulligan\n\nStew, Pinto Beans and BBQ (especially mutton), I think he was forbidden into the\n\nkitchen. But his Mulligan stew was always one of my favorites. I watched him\n\nmake this numerous times as he painstakingly cut up a large chuck roast.\n\nThen it would simmer for hours until the meat was very tender.\n\nIngredients:\n\n4-5 lb. chuck roast\n\n1/4 cup Crisco shortening\n\n6 russet potatoes, cut into 3/4-1\" pieces\n\n1 large onion, cut into 1/2 inch pieces\n\n4-6 cups water\n\n2 tbl. All purpose flour\n\n3 tbl. Salt\n\n3 tbl. Fresh Black Pepper\n\nDirections:\n\nCut the chuck roast into pieces approx. 3/4-1\" in size, removing any excess\n\nfat. Put into a bowl and sprinkle the salt and pepper, then mix well to evenly\n\ncoat the meat. Into a preheated pot, add the Crisco and when melted and very\n\nhot, add the meat. Brown the meat quickly, increase the heat if the meat does\n\nnot sizzle. When brown, add the onion and cook for two minutes, stirring often.\n\nReduce the heat, add the 2 tbl . Flour cook for 1 minute. Add the water and\n\nreduce heat to low. Cook about 1 1/2 hour, then add the potato's and cook an\n\nadditional 1 hour uncovered. Taste and add salt and pepper if needed.\n\nA large bowl of this and saltine crackers are hard to beat on a cold, rainy day."
