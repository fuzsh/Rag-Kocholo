        "meta_description": "Mulligan Stew was a children's educational program, sponsored by the 4-H Council and shown both in schools and on television featured a multi-racial group of kids who make up the rock bank Mulligan Stew. The group promoted good nutrition using groovy slang and music that may have been hip in 1967 but wasn't in 1972...\r\n\r\n...and was completely out of style when our school inflicted the episodes on my fifth grade class in 1986...\r\n\r\nAlong for the ride is their painfully unfunny adult comic relief Wilbur Dooright. Who I'm actually not sure is supposed to be the kids manager. A secret agent. Or Jared Fogle. It's pretty unclear what Wilbur's role is besides being a dickweed.\r\n\r\nIt's sort of like watching an episode of the Monkees. Just not that funny. So it's like watching an episode of the New Monkees.\r\n\r\nThis episode I remember being the most excruciating to watch. Featuring the Flim Flam Man. A guy selling fad diets and outdated hippy lingo. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyMuUll-eRA",

        "text": "From Wiki:\n\nMulligan's Stew was an American comedy-drama television series that originally aired as a 90-minute NBC television movie on June 20, 1977, and later, as a 60-minute series from October 25, 1977 to December 13, 1977. The series focused on the lives of the Mulligan family, who live in the fictitious Southern California community of Birchfield; high school teacher and football coach, Michael (Lawrence Pressman), his wife, Jane (Elinor Donahue), who's a school nurse.[1]\n\nMichael and Jane have three children: Mark, Melinda and Jimmy. They find making ends meet difficult, but manageable. Things get tighter moneywise and spacewise when the Mulligans take in their nephew Adam (Moose) and nieces Polaris (Polly) and Starshine (Stevie) Freedman, after their parents (Michael's sister and brother-in-law) are killed in a plane crash in Hawaii while in the process of adopting the Vietnamese-born Kimmy, leaving the Mulligans to finalize the adoption. They deal with the changes and bond as a family."
